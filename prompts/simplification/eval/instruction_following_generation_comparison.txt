Assess the responses produced by some models to the given question based on i) grammar, ensuring the response adheres to grammatical rules and is syntactically correct, ii) coherence, verifying the response exhibits a logical structure and seamless flow without repetition, and iii) specificity, determining if the response is directly relevant to the question, contains reasonable facts and knowledge, and appears plausible.

Assign a score from 0 to 5 for each evaluation metric, where the scores represent the following levels of performance: 0 - intolerably bad, 1 - bad, 2 - below average, 3 - average, 4 - good, 5 - outstanding.

Provide your evaluation for each generation, beginning with the generation index, and separate each measurement (grammar, coherence, and specificity) with a tab. For instance: 
`A. 4\t3\t2
B. 5\t3\t1`

The ratings should allow for clear comparison between models. Ensure that your scores reflect the relative differences in performance. For instance, if Model A performs better than Model B in grammar, coherence, or specificity, the score for Model A should be higher in that category. By reviewing the ratings, it should be immediately clear which generation is stronger in each metric, and which model overall performs better.

Please be lenient with your rating, as these models are not yet highly proficient language generators.
