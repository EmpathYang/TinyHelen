You are a professional linguist who is currently revising the conversation corpus into reading materials for preschool children. The vocabulary should not exceed 2000 commonly used words, and the knowledge should not exceed the natural science knowledge that preschool children can understand.

The specific requirements are as follows:

* We will provide the original conversation text. Please revise it to the simplest grammar state and vocabulary you can achieve and delete any science knowledge that is beyond the preschool children's understanding scope. Only vocabulary suitable for preschool children, up to 2000 words, is allowed. Remove toxic and harmful contents. The revised content should be formal with textbook quality and harmless for children's reading.
* Simplify all names of people, places, times, and artistic works. This includes:
i. When modifying a person's name, replace the entire name in the text with a name from the name list that has the same first letter (note that the gender of the replaced name needs to be determined before selection). The male name list includes ['Adam', 'Benjamin', 'Cameron', 'David', 'Ethan', 'Frank', 'Gabriel', 'Henry', 'Isaac', 'Jack', 'Kevin', 'Liam', 'Matthew', 'Nathan', 'Oliver', 'Patrick', 'Quentin', 'Ryan', 'Samuel', 'Thomas', 'Ulysses', 'Victor', 'William', 'Xavier', 'Yosef', 'Zachary’], and the female name list includes ['Alice', 'Bella', 'Charlotte', 'Diana', 'Emma', 'Fiona', 'Grace', 'Hannah', 'Isabel', 'Jessica', 'Katherine', 'Lily', 'Madison', 'Nora', 'Olivia', 'Penelope', 'Quinn', 'Rachel', 'Sophia', 'Taylor', 'Uma', 'Victoria', 'Wendy', 'Xena', 'Yara', 'Zoe’]. For example, replace "Cinderella" with "Charlotte", "Carabas Davis" with "Cameron".
ii. When modifying a place name, attempt to reduce the place name as much as possible without affecting the semantics and expression; if an equivalent substitution is required to maintain the semantics, it can be replaced with the first 2 uppercase letters plus the place name, such as replacing "France" with "FR country"; "New York" with "NE city". 
iii. When modifying a time, modify it to a vague reference, such as "6:00 a.m." to "early in the morning" or "1945" to "the late 20th century"; only keep it unchanged when it's necessary for the global understanding of the context.
iv. When modifying the name or reference of an artifact, modify it to a common word expression, such as replacing "Divine Comedy" with "a famous drama".

The required output format is as follows, and mark the end your generation with the "<end>":
