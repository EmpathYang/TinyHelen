Mini bugs and their family are different from most other bugs because they live in ant homes. This means they live where ants live. There are more than 350 kinds of Mini bugs in the world. Some of these will be called different names later because Mini bug has been used for different bugs. Most Mini bugs live in very hot places; 30 kinds live in NA country.\\nAdult Mini bugs are very hairy and look like bees. They are not too big or too small. The feelers on their head are almost as long as the fly's face. These flies have black or light (white or golden) hairs, and their bodies are either black or shiny green or blue.\\nThe babies of Mini bugs look weird. They are very round and look like little fat bugs. At first, people who study animals thought they were snails or bugs that hide under scales. They move slowly.\\nGrown-up Mini bugs do not fly around flowers like many other hoverbugs; instead they stay close to the ant homes where they grew up.\\nThe babies can be found deep in ant homes. Some Mini bug babies eat baby ants; others eat dead plants or bugs in the ant home. Most \"MI bugs\" babies can only live with one kind of ant.", "hash": "5f693a556f754d8b8db16e970c8c0eb1a5e77555047eeb8dde5a9ef926b7a8ea"}

{"idx": 4681, "text": "Types of Living Things\\nA type of living thing is what we call a species. It is a simple way we group different animals and plants. A species is all the animals or plants that are the same kind. Like, wolves are one kind, and people are another kind. Usually, like cats have kittens, and we call this type of cat \"FE cat\". But, it is hard to say exactly what we mean by 'species', and many people have tried.\\nSpecies is just a word for a special kind of living thing, like a jackdaw. Jackdaws and ravens are alike, so they are in a bigger group called a genus, in this case, \"CO\". Then there is a family (like the crow family, which has crows, ravens, jays, and magpies). Families are put into groups like the songbirds, which includes many families of birds. The next group is the class; all birds are in the same class. After that is a bigger group, like animals with backbones. Last of all is the big group, like the animal group. This is a way to sort out all the different animals and plants.\nThere is a fun saying to help people remember the order of the groups which are listed again below: \"King Phillip Came Over For Great Spaghetti\".\nLet's look at a bird we call a Common Bird:\nThere is a long talk about whether types of animals and plants are real things, or if they are just names we give them. Those who think types are real point to things which 'good' types do. They look alike, and they have babies with their own kind, and their babies look the same.\nBut there are many times this is not true. There are types of animals and plants that slowly change into other types, and have babies with other types (see ring types). On the other hand, there are types which look exactly the same, but do not have babies together (sibling types).\nIt is quite clear that 'types' as used by people who study old things and 'types' as used by other people who study animals and plants cannot be the same. A person who studies old things can only use what they can see of an old thing, which is only a small part of the traits of a living type. Not only that, but many types which are very much alike can only be told apart by their DNA. This new finding of sibling types is very important, and their numbers are growing fast. We did not know how much alike different types could be.\nThe biggest change in the type idea was made by Cameron, for change over time meant that clear lines could not be drawn between types. Adam's idea\\nAdam had a new idea about how we group living things. He said that it's important to look at groups that can have babies together. This meant that, in his view, these groups were real, not just something a scientist made up. He explained that new groups can form when old groups get split up. Today, we think about groups of living things in a way that is closer to David's ideas.\nWe think there are about 8.7 million different groups of animals and plants on Earth. This does not include tiny things like bacteria and viruses.\nWe have not found and named all of these groups yet. At the speed we are going, it might take over 1000 years to find them all. Some might disappear before we can find them.", "hash": "cb7573e66786ab44c8c6480e85f105b3f19a8f346f3e640126e157f207f8dd4e"}

But the word \"big gun\" can also mean different kinds of weapons:\nBig guns were used by soldiers. A soldier with a big gun was called a big gun soldier. In old times, soldiers with a heavy old weapon, called a big gun, helped other soldiers. By the start of the 18th century, a lighter big gun replaced the old weapon. When a pointy thing was added, there was no need for other soldiers, and most soldiers became big gun soldiers. The first big gun made in the US country was the first big gun model. In the 19th century, better bullets and ways of shooting the gun, meant that the new type of gun became common. A few years later, people started using different types of bullets and could put them in the gun from the back. This made the old type of gun become a new type of gun, and people stopped using the old type of gun. \nThe old type of gun could go from this far to that far. If you shot it straight, it could only go about this far to that far. The new type of gun in the 1850's was much better and could hit something as big as a man from really far away. This was really helpful during a big fight, where the new type of guns could hurt the bad guys before they could get close enough with their old guns. But in another fight, the other side could beat the new guns by moving quickly and using a different type of weapon when they were very close.", "hash": "26a21ac52151f752ac11cca84a837057db7bc3263d36d7f30f8bce110a7c1aab"}

Each player takes turns. On their turn, a player moves one ghost friend one spot up, down, left or right. A ghost can take another player's ghost by moving to its spot. Only when a ghost is taken does the other player find out if it is good or bad.\nIf a player takes all four of the other player's good ghost friends, they have won the game. But if a player takes all four of the other player's bad ghost friends, they have lost the game. The game can also be won by moving one of the good ghost friends to one of the doors on the other side of the board.\nThe game is all about trying to guess which of the other player's ghost friends are good or bad by how they move and trying to trick the other player with tricky moves.", "hash": "535981a790855e443fec06fb988c6be575bb931c2b2b38061e21c02cf221703f"}

{"idx": 73070, "text": "The Story of a Bad Boy\nThe Story of a Bad Boy is a story by Thomas. It's about his life when he was a little boy in NH state. This story is the first one about a \"naughty boy\". The story was first shared bit by bit in 1869 in a magazine for kids. It was turned into a book in 1870.\nJames, Lord of Douglas\nSir James (also known as Good Sir James and James the Black Douglas), was a brave man from SC country. He is one of SC country's biggest heroes. He was a friend of King Robert I of SC country (also called Robert the Bruce).\nJames was the oldest son of William, Lord of Douglas and Elizabeth. His dad, William, didn't want to help King Edward I of EN country who was in charge of SC country in 1290. The EN King put William in a locked place and took his lands. This left young James with no land and no dad. Douglas then went to FR country where he lived a simple life for three years. When he heard that his dad had passed away, he went back to SC country and went to see William, a church leader. The church leader took James in and after some time took James to see King Edward I of EN country. When the church leader asked for the lands of Douglas to be given back to James, the king was not happy and said no. David's Land\\nDavid was given a big land by Robert Clifford and the king didn't want to hear more about it. David stayed with the bishop and didn't do anything against the king of EN country. He hoped to get his family's lands back. But in the early 14th century, a man named Robert claimed to be the king of SC country. Now David had to choose between two kings who might give him his lands back.\nIn the early 14th century, David joined king Robert against the king of EN country, Edward. That spring, David and some of his friends attacked his dad's castle and won over the EN soldiers there. David then burned his castle and destroyed all the food and drink. He made the water bad and punished the EN soldiers. This event became known as David's pantry. Even though David did not yet have his dad's lands, he had a lot of friends in that area. He and his friends troubled the EN forces all that summer. The tactics used by Bruce and his friends including David were just surprise attacks and quick runaways. They burned enemy lands and made the castles they won useless to the EN. When they heard that a big group of soldiers was coming into SC country, David went to warn Robert. Robert and David split up and agreed to meet at another place. When they joined their forces again, they attacked the EN and won.\nIn several trips in the early 14th century, David helped King Robert in the south of SC country. On a winter night, David and his friends, all wearing black coats over their armors, attacked RO castle. Ryan was the main EN stronghold in the middle of SC country. It was defended by 100 EN soldiers. The fall of Ryan Castle made many people in the area run back to EN country. Now held by David, it was the start of his nickname as \"the Black David\". To the people of SC country he was \"the Good Sir Ryan\". He was now one of the king's biggest friends and a model of good behavior. But Ryan had black hair and was so scary to the EN people they called him \"the Black David.\" They said his success against them was because he was a scary man himself. His son and grandson also used the scary name themselves, continuing the family reputation.\nEthan II of EN country had kept up the fights against the Bruce and his friends. He was getting more and more upset with each win of Robert the Bruce and his friends. Decided to stop Bruce once and for all he got together a very big group of soldiers. It was made of knights on horses, people who shoot arrows, crossbow-men, and foot soldiers led by Ethan himself. We don't know the exact size of his group, but it was a lot bigger than that of Robert the Bruce. King Robert picked the place for the upcoming battle at BA very carefully He picked a spot with many natural defenses many of which stopped heavy horses or big groups of soldiers to work. He put his group into four 'battles' or groups, three of which were made of 'hedgehog' or schiltrons Just before the fight started king Robert made Sir Ryan Douglas, his cousin Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of SC country, and many others knights. Jack and William were both leaders of the left group.\nWhen the EN country's army was getting close, king Robert sent David and Sir Ryan, the leader of SC country, to watch the EN country's army and tell him what they saw. David and Ryan told king Ethan that a very big army was coming. During the battle, most of the fighting was towards the other two groups. When the middle group led by Thomas was in trouble, David went to help his good friend. But the EN country's army went away before David could help. At last, the SC country's people won the battle and the EN country's army went away in a mess, king Ethan with 500 horse-riding knights ran away. Jack with a small group of horse riders chased after the EN country's king. They chased them all the way to DU town, but Ethan escaped back to EN country.\nAfter EN country's defeat at BA battle, the northern part of EN country was not very well protected. In a month of August, Jack, along with Ethan (the king's brother), and Jack led a big group into EN country. From the year after the BA battle to five years later, Jack was going into the northern part of EN country at least once a year. When Ethan left for IR country in the third year after the BA battle, Jack became the leader in the southern part of SC country. These trips were not just to scare the EN country's people but to get money from the king of SC country for not attacking that village. It was also to show the EN country's people that their king Ethan II could not keep them safe. Jack was one of the main leaders in the wars on the EN country's border until the final peace in the fourteenth year after the BA battle.\nTwo times, in a year long ago and then again, when David went into YE land, he tried to catch King Ethan II and his wife Queen Isabel of FR country. Even though he didn't catch them, people still thought he was very brave and they called him \"the Black David.\" On a winter day, the SC people and EN people agreed to stop fighting for two years. In a year following this, David agreed to a letter that said SC country was free. This letter was sent to a very important man named Pope Jack.\nDuring this time, David was given a lot of land many times. One time, he was given something even more special. It was called the Emerald Letter, and it let David and his family be free from many jobs they had to do for the king. It also let David and his family be the boss of their own lands. To give David this special letter, the king took a green ring from his finger and put it on David's finger. David was becoming more and more important to King Robert and to SC country as time went on.\nIn a year long ago, King Robert was very sick and was going to die. He had always wanted to go on a big journey, but he couldn't do it. He asked his friend Sir David to take his heart to a far away place. The king died on a summer day. After the king's death, David put the heart of King Robert in a silver box. He kept it safe on a chain around his neck. In a year following this, he and six brave men went on a ship with royal flags. This is so all who saw it would know the heart of Ryan, a king, was on its way to a holy place far away. The big boat waited at SL city for other brave men to join them before they kept going. They sailed to SP country where they stopped at SE city. They were welcomed by Adam, King of CA country and many brave men from EN country who had come to SP country to fight against the Moors. In a warm month outside the walls of a town, David and his brave men joined the king's army. King Adam asked David if he would lead the group and placed all the brave men from EN and SC country under his command. David told them to go ahead and the fighting began right away. When the Moors pretended to run away, David and ten of his brave men followed them. But it was a trick and the Moors turned and surrounded them. Trying to save a friend, David and all his brave men were hurt. Sir David was found with the silver box still around his neck. His body was made ready for the trip home. The silver box containing the heart of Bruce never reached the holy place. It was buried at the ME Abbey. Sir David was buried at the DO Church.", "hash": "df01486c38621154cae820fdcd4cd7077f76b3db9489cd023397b450069140e9"}
