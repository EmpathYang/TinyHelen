These bags come in different sizes, styles, and materials, making it tricky to pick the right one. In this lesson, we will talk about the things to think about when choosing a bag for baby diapers, including size, material, and style.\nSection 1: Things to Think About When Choosing a Bag for Baby Diapers\nSize:\n- The size of the bag for baby diapers depends on the number of diapers you want to keep. Most bags come in small, medium, and large sizes.\n- The small size is good for keeping 1-2 diapers, while the medium size can hold 2-3 diapers. The large size is good for keeping 4-6 diapers.\nMaterial:\n- Bags for baby diapers are made of different materials, including plastic, cloth, and a kind of cloth called nylon.\n- Plastic is a material that doesn't let water pass through, good for keeping wet diapers. But, it may not be safe when hot.\n- Cloth is a strong and water-resistant material that is good for keeping dry diapers.\n- Nylon is a light and breathable material that is good for keeping both wet and dry diapers.\nDesign:\n- Bags for baby diapers come in different styles, including backpacks, big handbags, and bags with strings to pull them closed.\n- Backpacks are good for traveling, while big handbags and bags with strings are good for use at home.\n- Some bags come with a special layer that doesn't let water pass through, while others have a special coating.\nSection 2: Real Examples \nExample 1:\n- If you have 3 cloth diapers, which size bag should you pick?\n- A medium-sized bag can hold 2-3 diapers, so it is the best choice.\nExample 2:\n- You want to buy a bag for baby diapers for a trip to the beach. Which material should you pick?\n- Plastic is a material that doesn't let water pass through, making it the best choice for keeping wet diapers on the beach.\nExample 3:\n- You need a bag for baby diapers for your baby's room. Which style should you pick?\n- A bag with strings is the best choice for use at home.\nSection 3: Thinking About Choices\nDebate 1:\n- Should you pick a bag with a special layer that doesn't let water pass through or a special coating?\n- A bag with a special layer is more strong and long-lasting than one with a special coating.\nDebate 2:\n- Is it worth spending more money on a good bag for baby diapers?\n- Yes, if you plan to use the bag for a long time and want a strong and waterproof bag.\nConclusion:\nPicking the right bag for baby diapers requires careful thought about size, material, and style.

{"text": "**Lesson: Fast Internet and Finding Good Deals**\n\n**Introduction:**\nHaving fast and good internet is important today. This lesson will help you find the best internet deals in your area.\n\n**Section 1: Understanding Fast Internet**\nFast internet lets you use the web quickly. It uses different ways to give data to your device. The speed of your internet is measured in how much data you can get and send every second. The more data you can get and send, the faster your internet is.\n\n**Section 2: Finding Internet Deals**\nThere are many ways to find internet deals in your area. You can use a website that shows you all the deals in your area. These websites let you see results based on how much money you have, how long you want the deal to last, and how fast you want your internet to be. Another way is to talk to the company that gives you internet now and see if they have any special deals.\n\n**Section 3: Checking How Fast Internet is**\nWhen checking how fast internet is, you need to think about a few things. First, check how fast the deal says your internet will be. This is how fast you should expect your internet to be. But remember, the real speed can change because of different things like how good your internet is, what time it is, and how many devices are using your internet.\n\nNext, think about how fast you can get and send data. Getting data is how fast data comes from the internet to your device. Sending data is how fast data goes from your device to the internet. Most people need to get data faster than they need to send data, but it depends on what you do with your internet.\n\n**Section 4: Checking Internet Packages**\nInternet packages have different things, and you need to check which one is best for you. Some common things include:\n\n- Unlimited usage: Most internet companies let you use the internet as much as you want without asking you for more money.\n- Phone included: Some internet packages include a phone, which can be useful if you don't have a cell phone or if you like using a phone for some calls.\n- TV services: Some companies offer TV services with their internet package, which can include TV shows you missed, content you can watch anytime, and live channels.\n- Mobile data: Some companies offer mobile data with their internet package, which can be useful if you have a cell phone and use a lot of data.\n\n**Section 5: Comparing Internet Companies**\nOnce you have looked at the deals and speeds, you need to compare internet companies. Look at things like:\n\n- Reputation: Look at online reviews and ratings to see how happy other people are with the company's service.\n- Coverage: Make sure the company covers your place, as not all companies offer service everywhere.\n- Customer help: Look at the company's help options, like phone, email, and chat, to make sure that they are there when you need them.\n\n**End thought:**\nIn the end, finding the best internet deal and speed in your place needs looking and thinking. Use websites that compare, look at speeds and packages, and compare companies to make sure that you get the best service for what you need. By doing these steps, you can enjoy quick and good internet service at a price that fits what you can pay.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 619, "idx": 155894, "original text": "Enter your postcode to see what broadband deals and speeds are available in your area..

{"text": "Lesson Title: Learning about Space Helpers\n\nIntroduction:\nSpace helpers are important for talking to people far away, finding our way, and knowing about the weather. They send messages from one place to another. In this lesson, we will learn about how space helpers work together.\n\nSection 1: What does it mean when space helpers work together?\n\nWorking together means helping each other to do something. For space helpers, working together means different groups or countries helping each other to make, send, and use space helpers. This can mean sharing things, knowing things, and helping each other to do better.\n\nWhy is working together important?\n\nWorking together is important for a few reasons:\n\n1. Saving money: By sharing things and helping each other, groups can spend less money to make and use space helpers.\n\n2. Doing better: Working together lets groups use everything they have to do better.\n\n3. Doing more: Working together lets groups use technology and know things they might not have known before.\n\nChapter 2: Working Together with Satellites\n\nThere are many times when satellites work together, like:\n\n1. Big Space House (BSH): The BSH is a big project between five space groups \u2013 NA (NO country), RO (RU country), JA (JA country), ES (EU country), and CA (CA country). It is the biggest space project ever, with more than 200 scientists from all over the world.\n\n2. StarWorld: StarWorld is a company that makes phones work in far away places. The company works with several other companies to provide service, including IronStar, which made the satellite for the SV-166.\n\n3. EUMETSAT: EUMETSAT is a group in EU country that works with weather satellites. It works with other groups, such as NO (NO country) and JM (JA country), to give data and services to its members.\n\nChapter 3: How to Work Well Together\n\nWorking together is not always easy, but there are some steps groups can take to work well together:\n\n1. Make clear goals: Before starting to work together, it is important to make clear goals. This makes sure that everyone is working towards the same thing.\n\n2. Pick the right friends: Pick friends who share your ideas and goals. This will help make sure that the work together is successful and that everyone is working towards the same goals.\n\n3. Talk well: Talking is key to any successful work together. Make sure that everyone is talking often and openly, sharing information and ideas freely.\n\n4. Be ready to change: Working together needs being ready to change. Be ready to change plans and ways as needed to reach the goals of the work together.\n\nThe End:\n\nIn the end, working together with satellites is a very important part of the satellite world. By working together, groups can do better work, save money, and get better at what they do.

In this story, we will learn about why it's not safe to walk when you're drunk and how to make smart choices about walking when you've had too much to drink.\n\nChapter 1: Learning About the Dangers\n\nQuestion: What can happen if you walk when you're drunk?\nAnswer: If you walk when you're drunk, you might fall, bump into cars or people, and other bad things can happen that can really hurt you or even kill you.\n\nQuestion: Is walking when you're drunk as dangerous as driving when you're drunk?\nAnswer: A lot of people think driving when you're drunk is very dangerous, but they might not know that walking when you're drunk is also very dangerous. In fact, some studies show that every year 100 people who have drunk too much are killed when they're walking in AU country, which is more than 5% of all people who die in car crashes.\n\nChapter 2: Why Do People Walk When They're Drunk?\n\nQuestion: Who makes young people want to walk when they're drunk?\nAnswer: Friends make young people want to walk when they're drunk the most, according to a study by the accident research center at QU school.\n\nQuestion: Why do people walk when they're drunk?\nAnswer: People might walk when they're drunk because their friends make them want to or because they don't think it's as dangerous as it really is.\n\nChapter 3: Making Smart Choices\n\nQuestion: How can you make smart choices about walking when you're drunk?\nAnswer: To make smart choices about walking when you're drunk, you should think about how dangerous it is and compare it to the good things about it. You should also think about other things to do that are safer and more fun.\n\nQuestion: What can you do instead of walking when you're drunk?\nAnswer: Some things you can do instead of walking when you're drunk are staying home or staying at the party, asking a friend who hasn't drunk anything to drive you or others home, or finding a service that can drive you home.\n\nConclusion:\nIn the end, knowing how dangerous it is to walk when you're drunk and making smart choices about it can help stop people from getting hurt or killed. By thinking about how your friends and other things affect you, and comparing the good things to the dangers, you can make safer choices and avoid the dangers of walking when you're drunk.", "source": "minipile", "s": 8, "len": 2318, "idx": 639886, "original text": "July 1, 2014\n\nDrink Walkers Do It Because Their Mates Think It\u2019s Okay\n\nFriends may be the key to stopping their mates drink walking, a risky behaviour that kills on average two Australians every week, a QUT study has found.\n\nResearcher Dr Ioni Lewis, from QUT's Centre for Accident Research & Road Safety - Queensland (CARRS-Q), said in a survey of young people aged 17 to 25, friends were the strongest influence on their intentions to drink walk.\n\n\"Drink walking, or walking while intoxicated in a public place, is linked to increased risk of injury and fatality,\" Dr Lewis said.\n\nIn a survey, published in Transportation Research, more than 50 per cent of participants said they had walked while intoxicated in the previous six months together with evidence that some young people intended to drink walk in the future.\n\n\"The study found that the risks associated with drink walking were seen to be less dangerous than drink driving, however, research shows that in Australia on average 100 alcohol-affected pedestrians are killed each year,\" Dr Lewis said.\n\n\"That equates to more than 5 per cent of all road crash fatalities.\"\n\nDr Lewis said the study looked at friends, parents and peers and found friends could significantly influence a young person's decision to drink walk.\n\n\"Drink walking may occur, for instance, when young people start drinking at home before heading out to pubs or clubs, or when they're walking between licensed venues,\" she said.\n\n\"We now know that when young people who perceive their friends approve of drink walking and believe their friends engage in drink walking, that these young people are more likely to drink walk in the next six months.\"\n\nShe said the study also identified young males as being most at risk, because they considered drink walking to be a low-risk activity.\n\n\"If we can turn around the perception of young people that drink walking is not a low-risk activity and it is dangerous, then we may be able to reduce the injuries and fatalities.\"\n\nDr Lewis said the next step, which was currently under way in another study, was to design and test safety messages aimed at discouraging drink walking among young people.\n\nThe study is looking for 18-25 year olds willing to provide their responses to some anti-drink walking advertising concepts via an online survey.", "hash": "6ccc8a0c72873ea37499b5a73465161e43f2de99b24f7b20af9f9f6b1f275215"}
{"text": "Story: Learning About Important Things in Business\nIntroduction:\nImportant things are parts of any successful business. They give a way to make decisions, guide behavior, and help businesses stay true to their mission. In this story, we will learn what important things are, why they're important, and how they can be used in a business.\nChapter 1: What are Important Things?\nImportant things are big ideas or rules that guide a business's actions and decisions. They show the business's identity and point it in the right direction. Important things can be big or small, but they should always match the business's mission and vision.\nChapter 2: Why are Important Things Important?\nImportant things are important because they give a sense of direction and purpose for the business. They help workers understand what's important and how to make decisions that match the business's goals. Good values help companies find and keep people who like the same things they do.\nPart 3: How can Good Values be Used in Work?\nGood values can be used in many ways at work. For example, a work that likes helping people may try to give great help to their people. Another work that likes new things may try to make new things and services. Works can also use their good values to find new workers, by looking for people who like the same things and will help make the work a nice place.\nPart 4: Real Examples\nLet's look at some real examples of how good values can be used at work.\nExample 1: Adam's Work\nAdam's work likes being kind to the earth. They use old things in their things, give 1% of their sales to earth groups, and ask their workers to take time off to help in their places. These things go with their good value of being kind to the earth and help them find people who like the same things.\nExample 2: Z's Work\nZ's work likes helping people. They give free sending and returns, have a all-time help line, and even pay for people's sending costs if they need to send something back. These things go with their good value of helping people and help them find people who like great service.\nPart 5: The End\nTo end, good values are very important parts of any successful work. They give a plan for making choices, guide behavior, and help works stay true to their goal. By using their good values in all parts of their work, works can find people who like the same things, make a positive work place, and be successful for a long time.\nWords:\nGood values: Big ideas or rules that guide a work's actions and choices.\nGoal: A statement of the purpose or aim of a work.\nDream: A clear and bright picture of what a work wants to do in the future.\nValues: Ideas or rules that are considered important and good.\nGoal statement: A statement that says a work's purpose and aims.\nDream statement: A statement that says what a work wants to do in the future.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 1001, "idx": 368349, "original text": "Amec Foster Wheeler UAE.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Talking Without Cords\n\n### Part 1: Fun Things to Know\n\nIn this lesson, we will learn about how we can talk to our friends without any cords or wires. We will learn about these things:\n\n1. What is talking without cords?\n2. Parts of a talking without cords system.\n3. How can we send words without cords?\n4. What is a Home Spot (HS)?\n5. Why do we use more than one Home Spot?\n6. What is a Service Help Point (SHP)?\n7. What is a Service Move Point (SMP)?\n8. What is Signal Way 7 (SW7)?\n9. What is number moving?\n\n### Part 2: Real Life and Fun Examples\n\nLet's think of how talking without cords works. Suppose a boy named Jack wants to call his friend Sarah. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Jack's cordless phone sends a hello to the nearest big phone house (BPH) to start the call.\n2. The BPH checks Jack's phone card to find his Home Spot (HS).\n3. The BPH sends a question to the HS to find where Sarah is.\n4. The HS checks its book and finds that Sarah is in a different BPH area.\n5. The HS sends a new spot note to the new BPH, which puts Sarah's new spot in its book.\n6. The BPH sends a ring sound to Sarah's cordless phone to tell her Jack is calling.\n7. Jack and Sarah start talking on their cordless phones.\n\n### Part 3: Questions to Think About\n\n1. Why do we use more than one Home Spot?\n   - We use more than one Home Spot because there are many people using cordless phones. If there are too many people for one Home Spot, it can't help everyone. So, by having more Home Spots, we can help more people talk without cords.\n\n2. What is number moving?\n   - Number moving is when you can keep your old phone number even when you get a new phone or change your phone company. This means that you don't have to tell your friends a new phone number if you change your phone or your phone company. This is done with a big book called the Number Moving Book House (NMBH), which has a list of who has which phone number.\n\n### Words to Remember\n\n- Talking without cords: When we can talk to each other without any wires or cords.\n- Big phone house (BPH): A big machine that helps us talk to each other on cordless phones.\n- Home Spot (HS): A book that has details about where you are and your phone details.\n- Service Help Point (SHP): A book that helps other parts of the system, like giving directions.\n- Message Passing Spot (MPS): A thing that sends signals between different areas of a phone network.\n- Signal Code 7 (SC7): A regular rule used for controlling phone networks.\n- Number keeping: A thing that lets cell phone users keep their old phone numbers when they change phone companies.\n\n### Wrapping up\n\nIn this lesson, we learned about the parts of a wireless chat network and how they work together to send data. We also talked about real examples and situations to show how these parts work. Finally, we had fun talks to learn how to think better. By knowing these things, we can use them for new problems and learn more about wireless chat networks.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1725, "idx": 253543, "original text": "Wireless or Personal Communication Service (PCS) providers have been, until recently, able to store and maintain subscriber information and current location data on only one home location register (HLR). However, due to the escalating number of subscribers and the rapid expansion of the wireless (PCS) communications networks, it has become necessary to employ multiple home location registers to accommodate the growth.\nBy using multiple home location registers in the wireless communications network, it becomes necessary to devise a system and method to route the query messages and location updates to the proper home location register. A proposed solution is to provide a database in the service control point (SCP) in the telecommunications network, which maintains routing information. However, a serious drawback with this solution is the additional traffic it may cause in the signaling system no. 7 (SS7) network by routing these additional queries from the mobile switching centers (MSCs) to the service transfer points (STPs) and then to the service control point. These queries add to the existing signaling traffic that accomplish toll-free calling, number portability, and other global title translation (GTT) queries to provide services such as line information database (LIDB) services, switch based services (SBS) such as certain Bellcore's CLASS (R) services, calling name (CNAM) delivery, and interswitch voice messaging (ISVM). Due to the anticipated large overall query volume, the SS7 link set between the service control point and signal transfer point becomes a troublesome bottleneck, creating a potentially substantial negative imp act to the network's ability to route calls and provide services.", "hash": "ea0b2306913e7413ea1e61ee74852323d8144654de0903b0b25383f380c8dc5e"}
{"text": "\n\nLesson: About Fast Car Racing\n\n### Part 1: What is Fast Car Racing?\nFast Car (FC) racing is a worldwide car sport that uses very fast single-seat racing cars. The cars are made to follow very clear rules, which are set by the Big Car Group (BCG). The aim of FC racing is to win the Best Driver Award and the Best Car Maker Award.\n\n### Part 2: Knowing the Rules and Rules\nThe rules of FC racing are made to make sure that the cars are as alike as possible, but still let for new things and growth. These rules cover everything from the size and shape of the cars to the kind of fuel they can use. The most key rule is that the cars must be able to race at high speeds, but still be safe for the drivers.\n\n### Part 3: Looking at the Starting Group\nThe starting group for this year's FC racing season is one of the strongest in recent years. The group includes the current world champion, Kevin, as well as many other good drivers. There are also several promising new drivers who are starting in the sport.\n\n### Part 4: Thinking about the Teams' Chances\nThinking about the teams' chances of winning the World Cup is hard because there are so many good teams. However, based on the BCG start list, there are several teams that have a good chance of winning the title. These teams include Fast Car 1, Fast Car 2, Fast Car 3, and Fast Car 4.\n\n### Part 5: Looking at the Drivers\nEach driver in this year's starting group brings their own good things and not so good things to the track. Some drivers are known for their speed and bold driving style, while others are more careful and think ahead. It is important for each driver to find a balance between these things in order to do well.\n\n### Word List:\n- Best Driver Award: The award given to the best driver in FC racing.\n- Best Car Maker Award: The award given to the best team in FC racing.\n- FIA: The group that makes the rules for car races all over the world.\n\n### The End:\nKnowing the rules of car racing, looking at who is racing, and guessing which teams might win are all important parts of guessing who will win the whole season.

{"text": "Story: Learning About Ink Boxes and Their Role in Big Printers\n\n## Starting Off\n\nIn this story, we will learn about ink boxes, their role in big printers, and how they help us get good-quality prints. We will also look at the different kinds of ink boxes and what they can do, as well as why we should use them.\n\n## Part 1: What are Ink Boxes?\n\nInk boxes are a very important part of big printers. They hold ink dust that is used to make pictures on paper. The ink dust is moved onto the paper by a bright light that is guided by the printer's boss.\n\n## Part 2: Kinds of Ink Boxes\n\nThere are two main kinds of ink boxes: first-made and redone. First-made ink boxes are made by the same maker as the printer and are made to work smoothly with it. Redone ink boxes, on the other hand, are made by other makers and may not always work with all printers.\n\n## Part 3: What Ink Boxes Can Do and Why They're Good\n\nInk boxes come with different things, like page amount, size, and use rate. Page amount means how many pages can be printed before the ink box is empty. Size means how much ink is in the box. Use rate means how much ink is used each time you print.\n\nUsing good ink boxes can give several good things, including:\n\n1. Better print quality: Good ink boxes make sharp, bright pictures with true colors.\n2. More trust: First-made ink boxes are made just for your printer kind, making sure it works well and lessening the chance of printer problems.\n3. Saving money: Using good ink boxes can save you money over time by lessening the need for new ones often.\n\n## Part 4: Using What We Learned\n\nThe things we learned from understanding ink boxes and their role in big printers can be used in several ways. For example, when buying ink boxes for your printer, you can use the knowledge of different kinds and things to make a smart choice. You can also use this knowledge when fixing printer issues related to ink boxes.\n\n## Ending\n\nIn the end, ink boxes are a very important part of big printers that play a big role in making good-quality prints.

Get More Things: This is where we can get more stuff.\n\nNow that we know the \"Shop\" button, let's do the next thing.\n\n## Getting Stuff\n\nTo get stuff from the big room, we need to do these things:\n\n1. Tap on the \"Get Stuff\" choice.\n2. Write new things into the New thing spots.\n3. Note that if the new things are more than what we have now (see in the Now things spots), then we will have to trade for more stuff in line with the trade per more thing set by Mr. Henry (see in the Trade per more thing spot).\n\nNow that we know how to get stuff, let's do the next thing.\n\n## Knowing the Trade Thing\n\nThe trade thing for more stuff is set by Mr. Henry. Here is how the trade thing works:\n\nLet's say that we want to make our thing bigger from 10 to 20. The now thing is 10, and the thing we have is 5. Since we want to make it bigger by 10 (20 - 10 = 10), we will have to trade for an extra 5 (10 - 5 = 5). According to the trade set by Mr. Henry, each extra thing costs 5 apples. Therefore, we will have to trade 25 apples for the extra 5 things.\n\nNow that we know the trade thing, let's do the last thing.\n\n## The End\n\nIn this time, we learned how to get stuff from the big room.

Then, you can use a tool to find out how far it is to drive from one place to the other.\n\nTopic 3: Example\nLet's say you want to drive from NE city to LA city. Using a tool, you will find that it is about 2,800 miles or 4,500 kilometers to drive from one city to the other.\n\nSection 2: Walking Distance\n\nTopic 1: What is walking distance?\nWalking distance is how far a person walks from one place to another. We usually say it in miles or kilometers.\n\nTopic 2: How to find out walking distance?\nTo find out walking distance, you need to know where you start and where you want to go. You can use a map or a GPS to find out the places. Then, you can use a tool to find out how far it is to walk from one place to the other.\n\nTopic 3: Example\nLet's say you want to walk from a park in NE city to a famous place in LA city. Using a tool, you will find that it is about 2,450 miles or 3,940 kilometers to walk from one place to the other.\n\nSection 3: Flight Distance\n\nTopic 1: What is flight distance?\nFlight distance is how far a plane flies from one place to another. We usually say it in miles or kilometers.\n\nTopic 2: How to find out flight distance?\nTo find out flight distance, you need to know where you start and where you want to go. You can use a map or a GPS to find out the places. Then, you can use a tool to find out how far it is to fly from one place to the other.\n\nTopic 3: Example\nLet's say you want to fly from LO country to TO city. Using a tool, you will find that it is about 5,700 miles or 9,170 kilometers to fly from one place to the other.\n\nSection 4: Changing Miles to Kilometers\n\nTopic 1: How to change miles to kilometers?\nTo change miles to kilometers, you need to times the number of miles by 1.60934. This is because 1 big step is like a small step.\n\nTopic 2: Example\nLet's say you want to change 100 small steps to big steps. Using the change rule, you will find that 100 small steps is like lots of big steps.\n\nSection 5: Using Pictures to Find the Best Path\n\nTopic 1: What is a picture?\nA picture is a drawing of the world's skin that shows the things you can see and the gifts of nature in a special space. It is used to help people find their way from one spot to another.\n\nTopic 2: How to use a picture to find the best path?\nTo find the best path, you need to use a picture that shows the paths, big paths, and small paths in the space. You can also use a talking box to get ways and find the quickest path. Make sure to check the cars and the sky's mood before you start your adventure.\n\nEnd:\nIn this story, we learned how to find out the space between two spots using different ways such as car space, foot space, and bird space. We also learned how to change small steps into big steps and use pictures to find the best path. By using these tricks, we can easily find out the space between any two spots and plan our trips in a fun way.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 465, "idx": 440131, "original text": "Distance from Wesley, ME to Gorham, ME.

{"text": "## Lesson: Making Art with Used Things\n\n### Say Hello!\nIn this lesson, we will learn about making art with used things. We will see the different types of things that can be used, why using old things is good, and the steps to make a piece of art.\n\n### Part 1: What is Using Old Things\nUsing old things again is when we change things we do not need anymore into new things. It is very important because it helps us use less new stuff. By doing this, we can make less trash, save stuff in nature, and make our air and water clean.\n\n### Part 2: What Can We Use to Make Art\nThere are many things that can be used to make art. Some of these things are:\n\n1. Paper - Paper is a favorite thing for making art. It can be used to make pictures, shape things, and even stick together pictures.\n\n2. Plastic - Plastic is another favorite thing for making art. It can be made soft and shaped into different forms or used to make shaped things.\n\n3. Glass - Glass can be broken into pieces and used to make pretty pictures or other types of art.\n\n4. Metal - Metal can be cut, bent, and shaped into different forms to make shaped things or other types of art.\n\n5. Cloth - Cloth can be used to make art with thread, like blankets or wall hangings.\n\n### Part 3: Making Art with Used Things\nMaking art with used things is a fun and creative way to show your ideas while also helping the world. Here are the steps to make a piece of art:\n\n1. Pick your things - Decide what kind of art you want to make and collect the things you need.\n\n2. Plan your art - Draw your art on paper before you start. This will help you see what you want your final piece to look like.\n\n3. Get your tools - You will need different tools depending on the kind of art you are making. For example, if you are painting on a pizza box, you will need brushes and paint.\n\n4. Start making - Start working on your art, following your plan and using your tools to make your art.\n\n5. Last touches - Once you have made your art, add any last touches that you think are needed.\n\n### Part 4: Saying Goodbye\nTo finish, making art with used things is a fun and creative way to show your ideas while also helping the world. By using old things, we can make less trash and save things in nature. So, go ahead and get creative with your old stuff!", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 707, "idx": 241218, "original text": "..

{"text": "**Lesson: Say Hello to Weather Changes**\n\n**What We Will Do:** We will learn about weather changes and why it's important to know how the weather will be later.\n\n**Words to Know:**\n- Weather picture: A way of showing the Earth's weather that can show how different things change the weather.\nLet's learn about weather! \n\n**Introduction:** Weather change is something that happens all over the world. As the weather keeps changing, we need to understand how these changes will affect us and the world around us. There's a special way scientists use to make better guesses about what the weather will be like in the future. This is called \"weather guessing\".\n\n**Section 1: All About Weather Guessing Tools**\n\n**Topic 1: What is a weather guessing tool?**\nA weather guessing tool is like a big puzzle of the world's weather that can show us what happens when different things change. These things include sunlight, air, water moving in the ocean, and land.\n\n**Topic 2: How do weather guessing tools work?**\nWeather guessing tools use rules, number guessing, and real information to show the world's weather. They are used on big computers that can do the hard number work to show how different parts of the world's weather work together.\n\n**Topic 3: Why are weather guessing tools important?**\nWeather guessing tools are important because they help us understand the world's weather and guess what the weather will be like in the future. They help scientists understand how weather change will affect our world, money, and people.\n\n**Section 2: Making Weather Guessing Better**\n\n**Topic 1: What is making weather guessing better?**\nMaking weather guessing better is taking the big picture of weather guessing and making it show smaller areas of weather. This uses number guessing to make the big picture of weather guessing match the small picture of local weather.\n\n**Topic 2: Why is making weather guessing better important?**\nMaking weather guessing better is important because it lets scientists make better and more right guesses about what the weather will be like in smaller areas. This information is important for people who need to get ready for how weather change will affect their places and the world around them.\n\n**Topic 3: What are the different ways to make weather guessing better?**\nThere are different ways to make weather guessing better, including different ways of number guessing. Each way has good parts and not so good parts, and the choice of way depends on what is needed.\n\n**Section 3: Using Better Weather Guessing**\n\n**Topic 1: How can better weather guessing be used?**\nBetter weather guessing can be used in many ways, like guessing changes in hot and cold, rain, wind, and rising water. It can also be used to see how weather change might affect growing food, water, and health.\n\n**Topic 2: What are some examples of using better weather guessing?**\nSome examples of using better weather guessing include seeing how fire risk might change in CA state, seeing how rising water might affect places by the sea, and guessing how changes in weather might affect how much food can be grown.\n\n**Topic 3: What is hard about learning about weather?** \nIt can be hard to learn about weather because sometimes we can't tell what the weather will be like in small places. Also, it can be hard to pick the best way to learn about weather and to understand all the things that make weather happen.\n\n**In the end:** Learning about weather is very important. It helps us know what the weather might be like later on. This can help us make choices and plans. As the weather keeps changing in ways that can be hard for our world, we need to keep learning more about it to make good choices for later.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 8, "len": 720, "idx": 174955, "original text": "Within the climate science community, a variety of techniques are used to \u201cdownscale\u201d information from global climate models and produce fine-scale projections of future climate, but the relative strengths and weaknesses of these techniques are not well-understood.

{"text": "Lesson: Using Phones to Buy Things\n\nIntroduction:\n\nPhones can be used to buy and sell things. This is called m-commerce. More people are using phones, so businesses are making their websites and apps better for phones. This helps them sell to more people and make people happy. In this lesson, we will learn about why using phones to buy things is important and how businesses can make their websites and apps better for phones.\n\nSection 1: Why Using Phones to Buy Things is Important\n\nPhones are a big part of our lives. We use them to go on the internet, check emails, use social media, and buy things online. More than half of the people who use the internet do it on phones, and this number will get bigger. So, businesses need to make their websites and apps better for phones to make their customers happy and do well in the market.\n\nSection 2: How Businesses Can Make Their Websites and Apps Better for Phones\n\nThere are several ways businesses can make their websites and apps better for phones, including:\n\n1. Good Design: A good design is a design that changes to fit the size of the phone. This makes sure that the website or app looks good and is easy to use on any device.\n\n2. Easy Checkout: When people buy things, it should be easy to do on a phone. This means that the form should be short, and paying should be safe and fast.\n\n3. Phone Deals: Businesses should make special deals for phone users. This could be special deals, coupons, and promotions.\n\n4. Phone Apps: Businesses can make phone apps that let customers buy things directly from their phones.\n\nSection 3: Real Examples\n\nLet's look at an example of a business that has made its website better for phones. Amazon, a big online store, has a good design that changes to fit the size of the phone. When you visit Amazon's website on your phone, the website knows you are using a phone and changes to make it easy to use and buy things. Amazon also has a phone app that lets customers buy things directly from their phones.\n\nIn the end, making phone shopping better is very important for shops that want to do well and help their customers. By making their websites and apps better for phone shopping, shops can make customers happy, sell more, and be known by more people.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1957, "idx": 103090, "original text": "Nearly three quarters of businesses are optimised for mobile commerce according to Sage Pay e-Business Benchmark Report\n\nAlmost three-quarters (73 per cent) of businesses are now optimised for mobile commerce with 18 per cent spending in excess of \u00a31000 on the transition into mobile, according to a survey by the UK\u2019s leading payment processor Sage Pay.\n\nBusinesses are getting more prepared for m-commerce\n\nThe survey of more than 1500 online businesses in the UK shows a steady rise in the past 12 months with more businesses championing mobile apps and optimisation.\n\nLarge e-businesses were found to be rapidly adapting to the rise in mobile, with 22 per cent building mobile apps in the last year and 73 per cent choosing to optimise their sites for mobile commerce.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning about Money - Money Rules\n\n#### Section 1: Ideas to Know\n\nIn this lesson, we will learn about money rules. This is what the people in charge do to help how everything works with money. We will look at rules that think about what will happen later. We will also talk about how different groups of people want different things.\n\n#### Part 2: Questions and Answers\n\n1. What is money rules?\nAnswer: Money rules are what the leaders do to change how things work.\n\n2. What is money rules that don't change?\nAnswer: Money rules that don't change are when leaders make choices thinking about what will happen later.\n\n3. What is being different?\nAnswer: Being different means that everyone is not the same and likes different things.\n\n#### Part 3: Fun Stories with Real Life and Pretend\n\nLet's think of a story where the leaders decide to take more money from the rich to give to the workers. This choice might make the rich have less money to start businesses. But, the workers might get more money, which could mean more people have jobs.\n\nIn a different story, the leaders might decide to take less money from the rich to make them start more businesses. This choice might make the rich get even richer, while the workers don't get much more money.\n\n#### Part 4: Talking to Ourselves\n\nTalk: Should the leaders care more about the rich or the workers when they make money rules?\n\nReason to care about the rich: The rich are the ones who start businesses and give people jobs. Without them, things might not work well.\n\nReason to care about the workers: The workers are the ones who buy things, which helps businesses. Also, workers should get enough money to live well.\n\nIn the end: Both the rich and the workers are important, and the leaders should think about both when they make money rules. They can do this by making rules that don't change and think about what will happen later.\n\nWords to remember:\n- Money rules: What the leaders do to change how things work.\n- Money rules that don't change: When leaders make choices thinking about what will happen later.\n- Being different: Everyone is not the same and likes different things.\n\n#### The End\n\nIn this fun time, we learned about money rules and how leaders use them.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning about Place and Work\n\n### Section 1: Big Ideas\n\nLearning about place and work is about understanding how the world around us influences where people work and what they do. This includes looking at how natural and human-made things shape how people work and how these jobs interact with the world. In this lesson, we will learn about some important ideas in place and work, including:\n\n1. Where Things Are: This idea explains why certain work happens in specific places. It considers things like natural stuff, weather, moving things around, and how much people get paid.\n\n2. Work Groups: These are groups of companies that work together and compete with each other. They often form in places with lots of natural stuff or skilled people.\n\n3. World Connections: This means that different countries' jobs are getting more and more connected through trade, talking, and travel. It has led to the growth of big companies and the rise of big cities.\n\n4. City Growth: As more jobs are created, more people move from country areas to cities to find better jobs. This leads to more people living in cities and the growth of super big cities.\n\n### Section 2: Real Examples\n\nLet's look at some real examples of how place and work affect our everyday lives:\n\n1. Natural Stuff: Countries with lots of natural stuff like oil, rocks, or wood often have strong jobs because they can sell these goods. For example, SA country's jobs depend a lot on its oil industry.\n\n2. Weather: Weather can also affect place and work. For instance, farming areas tend to have more people than those that rely on making things or services. CA valley, known for its good soil, supports a big farming industry that helps the state's jobs a lot.\n\n3. Moving Things Around: How much it costs and how easy it is to move things around can influence where businesses choose to set up. For example, many tech companies have chosen to set up in SV place because it's close to big roads and airports, making it easy for people and goods to move around.\n\n4. People: Having skilled people around can also affect place and work. For example, many companies have moved their making things jobs from NA place to AS place because people get paid less there.\n\n### Section 3: Questions for You\n\n1. How does place and work affect where your town or city is?\n2. Can you think of any other things that might influence where businesses choose to set up?\n3. How does world connections affect the jobs of different countries?\n\n### Word List\n- Natural Stuff: Things given by nature that can be used for jobs, such as rocks, water, and wood.\n- Work Groups: Groups of companies that work together and compete with each other.\n- World Connections: Different countries' jobs getting more and more connected through trade, talking, and travel.\n- City Growth: The process of more people living and moving from country areas to cities.\n\n### End\n\nIn this class, we learned about simple ideas of place and people topics, like where things are, groups of things, big world changes, and city changes. We also saw real examples of how these ideas change our everyday life. By knowing about place and people topics, we can understand how the world works and how to use these skills for new problems.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 822, "idx": 163826, "original text": "Best in Class on the Bay.

They used warm stones to make meat, and later they used pots made from mud. In very old EG city, people used bread as their main food, and it was made from grains like barley and wheat. They also used tasty things like cumin and coriander in their food.\n\nPart 2: Long Ago Times\nIn the long ago times, people in EU country used wood to make their fires, which helped them make the fireplace. This let them make a lot of food at once. Bread was the main food in EU country, and people started adding things like honey, milk, and butter to make it taste nice. In this time, tasty things like cinnamon, ginger, and cloves came to EU country from AS continent.\n\nPart 3: Old Times\nIn the old times, books with food ideas started to show up, and people started writing down food ideas. This let them share ideas and make new meals. Ways to make food also got better, with new tools like spoons and tongs. People started using sugar in their food, and it became a loved ingredient.\n\nPart 4: Now Times\nIn the now times, making food and sweet treats has become more like science, with cups and spoons to measure things. People started using ovens instead of fires to make their food. The making of the cold box let them keep food, which let them make new meals. Today, making food and sweet treats is a fun thing to do, and there are many shows and web places where people share their food ideas and ways.\n\nEnd:\nThrough the story of time, making food and sweet treats has changed a lot. From using warm stones to make meat to using science ways to make our food, we have grown a lot. By learning the story of food and sweet treats, we can enjoy how our food skills have grown and keep trying with new food ideas and ways.\n\nWord List:\n- Fireplace: A place in a house where a fire is kept for making food and keeping warm\n- Spoon: A tool used to mix and give out food\n- Tongs: A tool used to pick up and move things\n- Fridge: A thing used to keep food cold\n- Cups: Things used to measure stuff for cooking and making cookies\n- Small spoons: Things used to measure tiny bits of stuff for cooking and making cookies\n- Cooker: A thing used to make food hot at a just-right temperature\n- How-to: A list of steps to make a yummy dish\n- Everyday food: A food that we eat a lot and is the main part of our food\n- Flavor thing: A dried seed, fruit, root, or bark that is used to make food yummy.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 995, "idx": 422458, "original text": "Cook & Recipe Developer.

{"text": "## Lesson: Learning about Working Together\n### Part 1: What is Working Together?\nWorking together is when we use many helpers at the same time to solve big tasks. This can be done by sharing the work among many helpers, or by using many parts within one helper.\n### Part 2: Why Do We Work Together?\nWe work together to do big tasks faster and to save time. It is really helpful for tasks that can be split into smaller parts that can be done at the same time.\n### Part 3: How Does \"NE Tool\" Help with Working Together?\n\"NE Tool\" is a tool for working together that is part of a big computer program. It helps people to use many helpers at the same time to make their work faster and solve big tasks.\n### Part 4: Example\nLet's imagine we want to see how many tiny things move in water using computers. We can use working together to share the work among many helpers, which allows us to see more tiny things and get better results in less time.\n### Part 5: Ending\nWorking together is a strong tool that can make big tasks much faster. \"NE Tool\" is a tool that helps people to use many helpers at the same time to make their work faster and solve big tasks.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning about Wavy Lights and How We Use Them\n\n#### Part 1: What are Wavy Lights?\n\n**What are they:** Wavy lights are special waves that move at the edge between a shiny thing and a different thing. They are a special kind of waves that have the features of both light waves and wavy shiny things.\n\n**More about them:** Wavy lights are made when the tiny parts in a shiny thing move all together because of a light wave. This moving creates a wave that can move along the edge of the shiny thing and the different thing. The way wavy lights behave is controlled by the moving of the tiny parts in the shiny thing and the light wave's field.\n\n#### Part 2: Features of Wavy Lights\n\n**Feature 1: Staying at the Edge:** Wavy lights stay at the edge between the shiny thing and the different thing, meaning they do not move into the big part of the shiny thing. This feature makes wavy lights good for uses where keeping the wave at the edge is wanted.\n\n**Feature 2: Strong Field at the Edge:** The field of a wavy light is very strong at the edge between the shiny thing and the different thing. This feature lets the wavy light interact strongly with other tiny things or systems.\n\n**Feature 3: Changing:** The features of wavy lights can be changed by adjusting the things in the system, like the shiny thing used, the different thing, or the shape of the shiny tiny things. This story talks about very special tiny things that can do big jobs.\n\n#### Chapter 3: What can these special things do?\n\n**Job 1: Finding out things:** These tiny things can help us find out if something around them has changed. They can be used to sense if something has changed in their surroundings. This makes them useful for finding out things in science.\n\n**Job 2: Turning on and off lights:** These tiny things can help us make light switches that work very fast. These switches can be used for quick talking systems.\n\n**Job 3: Collecting sunlight:** These tiny things can help us catch more sunlight in small sun-catching devices. This can make our sun-catching devices work better.\n\n#### Chapter 4: The end\n\nIn this story, we learned about these special tiny things and what they can do. We also talked about some of the big jobs these tiny things can do. By learning about these tiny things, kids can think about how they can use them for their own big ideas.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 881, "idx": 254436, "original text": "MacDonald, K.F., Krasavin, A.V. and Zheludev, N.I.

We report on the use of a reversible nanoscale light-induced structural transformation in a new type of gallium/aluminium composite material interfaced with a dielectric to control the efficiency with which light is coupled to a surface plasmon-polariton wave at the interface, and thereby the optical reflectivity of the interface. An optical fluence of just a few mJ/cm is sufficient to significantly modulate the composite's dielectric properties and thereby to provide high-contrast nonlinear optical and plasmonic switching functionality on a nano- to microsecond timescale, for signals in the visible and near infrared wavelength ranges..", "hash": "45f742d0a482a77529572c6f764a44d0187ce42d70ac7380262147e25fb75070"}
{"text": "## Lesson: About Working Together and Being a Leader in Games \n\n### Starting\nIn this lesson, we will talk about how important it is to work together and be a leader in games. We will learn about the role of the game leader and how they can help their team win. We will also talk about how talking and working together as a team can help us do well.\n\n### Main Topic\n### Working Together and Being a Leader\nWorking together is very important in any game, including the games we play. Players need to work together to reach goals, like winning a game. The game leader has a very important job in making sure the team works together and everyone is trying to reach the same goal.\n\nAdam, a professional game player, knows how important it is to work together and be a leader. As the game leader for a team, he helped his team win every game for a whole year. His success shows us how important strong leadership and good communication among team members are.\n\n### Second Topic\n### Talking and Working Together\nGood communication is important for successful teamwork in games. Players need to talk to each other all the time to share information about the game, game plans, and tactics. They also need to work together to make sure everyone is doing their part.\n\nIn games, just like in any team sport, there are five important parts of communication:\n\n1. Clearness: What you say should be clear and easy to understand.\n2. Shortness: What you say should be short and straight to the point.\n3. Being Specific: What you say should be specific and something others can do.\n4. Politeness: What you say should be polite and respectful.\n5. Consistency: What you say should be the same as what you have said before.\n\nBy following these rules, players can make sure they are communicating well and the team is working together well.\n\n### Second Topic\n### Jobs and Duties\nEvery member of a game team has a specific job and duties. The game leader, like Adam, is responsible for making important decisions during the game and making sure the team is working together. Other players may have different jobs, like dealing damage or helping their teammates.\n\nIt is very important that each player knows their job and duties and works together with their teammates to reach common goals. By doing this, they can create a team that works well together.\n\n### Ending\nIn the end, working together and being a leader are very important in games, just like they are in any other game. By working together and talking well, players can do very well, just like Adam did with his team. By understanding the importance of working together and being a leader, players can learn the skills they need to lead their own teams to win.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 317, "idx": 385586, "original text": "Wed October 10 2018.

{"text": "Lesson: About Using Your Brain to Solve Problems\n\nStarting:\nUsing your brain is a very important skill that helps us look at information, check arguments, and make smart decisions. In this lesson, we will learn about why thinking carefully is important for solving problems.\n\nPart 1: What is Thinking Carefully?\nThinking carefully means we take time to think about things before making a decision. It means we check if something is true, look at all sides of a story, and think about other ideas.\n\nPart 2: Why is Thinking Carefully Important for Solving Problems?\nThinking carefully is important for solving problems because it helps us find out what is causing the problem and how to fix it. By thinking about things carefully, we can make better choices.\n\nPart 3: How can we Get Better at Thinking Carefully?\nTo get better at thinking carefully, we need to listen well, ask questions, and check if things are true. We should also try to understand different ideas and question our own thoughts.\n\nPart 4: When do we Use Thinking Carefully?\nWe use thinking carefully in many things we do. For example, scientists use thinking carefully to plan tests, check results, and make guesses based on what they find. Doctors use thinking carefully to figure out what is making a person sick and what is the best way to help them. Lawyers use thinking carefully to understand old court cases and make strong arguments.\n\nPart 5: Ending\nThinking carefully is a helpful skill that helps us understand things, look at different sides of a story, and make good choices.

Maybe they do it closer then last time, say 25 miles out. How do they intend to get it back? Have another crane barge with a cradle bolted to the deck standing by to lift it off the landing barge and lay it down on the cradle?\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah, this barge strategy doesn't make a lot of sense to me other than as a demo.\n\n\n\nWe should remember that if SpaceX is not immediately bringing a 1st stage back to the launch site, that there must be a reason why they are landing out on the ocean - they are not doing water landings to generate YouTube revenue. And if they are going to the bother (and risk) of a barge landing, then there must be something they need to see on the stage before they attempt to fly it back to land.\n\n\n\nMaybe they want to verify the condition of the center engine? Or the insulation around the engine area, especially if it's going to be traveling further? Or maybe they need to validate how much propellant is left?\n\n\n\nI don't know, but they sure seem to think it's important before they attempt a landing back at the launch site.\n\nI think it's much simpler than that. SpaceX has said that getting permission to land on land is lagging behind their reusability efforts and so a landing on a barge out at sea is the next best thing to landing at a landing site that isn't ready yet. It also helps make plainly clear that they have can accurately land on a small target. Landing on a spot in the ocean, even if they claim it's right on the money down to a square foot, isn't as believable. They would also recover the first stage intact and could demonstrate gas and go by transporting the recovered stage to McGregor and reusing it there. That's 2 out of 2 really big things they would prove just by recovering the stage intact, by landing it on a barge. If nothing else, maybe they get valuable data out of it.", "hash": "091f96a3bdbe5f7061e423818fffa197fdb9f4fa47080c7765b20dfcef4fad7c"}

{"text": "Story: Learning about Power Makers and What They Do\n\nBeginning:\nA power maker is a thing that changes moving energy into power. Power makers are used in homes, big places, and other places where power is needed for different things. In this story, we will learn about different kinds of power makers, what they do, and how they work.\n\nPart 1: Kinds of Power Makers\n\nThere are two main kinds of power makers: big power makers and small power makers.\n\n1.1 Big Power Makers:\nBig power makers are always put in a home or big place. They are made to give power when there is no power. They are usually bigger and stronger than small power makers and can use gas, a kind of gas, or a kind of oil.\n\n1.2 Small Moving Power Makers:\nSmall moving power makers are little and can be picked up and moved easily. They work with gas or fuel and are used a lot when people go camping, have parties outside, or are building things.\n\nPart 2: Using Power Makers\n\n2.1 Houses and Shops:\nPower makers are used a lot in houses and shops. They give extra power when there is no power because of storms, or other reasons. They can also power things like tools, machines, and other things that need electricity.\n\n2.2 Outside Fun:\nSmall moving power makers are used a lot when people are outside doing things like camping, having parties, or building where there isn't any power. They give power to things like lights, fridges, heaters, and other machines.\n\nPart 3: How Power Makers Work\n\n3.1 Simple Idea:\nPower makers work by making power when things move and change.\n\n3.2 How it Works:\nInside a power maker, there is a thing that moves (we'll call it a spinner) and a thing that doesn't move (we'll call it a wrapper). When the spinner moves, it makes power in the wrapper. This power is then changed into a power that can be used and sent to other things.\n\nPart 4: Real Life Power Makers\n\n4.1 Home Power Maker by GA:\nThe Home Power Maker by GA is a well-liked model that gives power when there is no power. It is made to start on its own when the power goes out and can work for up to 50 hours with one tank of gas.\n\n4.2 GE Engine:\nThe GE Engine is a special engine made by GA. It is made to handle the hard work of a power maker, which makes it more reliable and easier to take care of.\n\nWords to Know:\n- Power Maker: A machine that makes electricity by using movement.\n- Making Power: The making of power when things move and change.\n- Law of Faraday: A basic rule that tells us how movement and change can make power.\n- Spinner: A moving part in a power maker that helps make power.\n- Wrapper: A part that doesn't move in a power maker that helps change the power into a power that can be used.\n- Power Level: The amount of power between two points in a circuit, measured in \"volts\".\n- Current: The flow of power, measured in \"amps\".\n- Difficulty: The thing that makes it hard for something to move, measured in ohms. \n\nEnd:\nIn this story, we learned about different types of machines that make power, what they do, and how they work. We also looked at real examples like the big house power maker and the strong engine. By knowing how these power makers work, we can use this knowledge in other fun science things.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 838, "idx": 615634, "original text": "Generac\u00ae Guardian Series Home Standby Generator..

They can prove to be a source of immense comfort and encouragement.\n\nA number of Bible quotes and verses can be of great importance in this regard as they offer strength and solace to the grieving loved ones as they speak of the love of God and an eternal life full of bliss.\n\nSome such soothing and encouraging Bible verses are discussed below.\n\n\u201cPraise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from God. For just as the sufferings of Christ flow over into our lives, so also through Christ our comfort overflows.\u201d~ 2 Corinthians 1:3-5\n\nThe sudden loss of a loved one tends to leave the bereaved family and friends devastated. At such a difficult time, reading the Holy Bible or even a few meaningful verses can be quite comforting. It can prove to be a great source of strength, guidance, and encouragement to help you cope with the loss.\n\nAfter all, the Lord cares about all His children and being omniscient and omnipotent, provides strength to them, especially when they need it the most. Continue reading\u2026\n\nLord Jesus Christ commissioned the 12 Apostles in order to spread His teachings. Thus, the twelve apostles were the closest followers or disciples of Jesus. Basically, the word apostle refers to \u2018one who is sent out\u2019.\n\nThey travelled with Jesus Christ and learned from Him. Plus, they shared the final meal, that is, the Last Supper with Jesus the night before He was executed. They were sent out by Jesus to be His witnesses after His resurrection and ascension.\n\nThe names of the 12 apostles are listed in Matthew 10:2-4, Mark 3:14-19, and Luke 6:13-16.\n\n\u201cThese are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon (who is called Peter) and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother Jack; Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.\u201d~ Matthew 10:2-4\n\nFallen angels and demons are evil entities. They have the ability to deceive people. Both these entities are usually considered the same but there is a difference between the two.\n\nTo begin with, fallen angels are more powerful than demons. Basically, they are the sons of God, or you can say the angels who rebelled against God and as a result, they were banished from Heaven. Demons, on the other hand, are disembodied spirits.\n\nFallen angels have their own celestial bodies. Hence, unlike demons, they need not possess other bodies. Demons, on the other hand, are wicked and unclean spirits and seek the possession of a human or animal body.\n\nThe concept of angelic beings is quite common in Christianity, along with Judaism and Islam. It is believed that these spiritual beings were created by God, before the creation of the world.\n\nThey are also referred to as God\u2019s messengers but are different from spirit guides as angels do not incarnate but the latter can take a human form. The angels glorify God and the ministers of God, that is, His representatives.\n\nChristian symbols depict important aspects associated with Christianity and Christian ideas. Given below are some symbols that are considered important in this regard.\n\nAlpha and Omega: These are the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet. As Christ was called the \u201cFirst and the Last\u201d, it is considered as a symbol for Christ. These letters are often combined with other Christian symbols like the Cross and Chi-rho, too.\n\n\u201cI am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.\u201d~ Revelation 22:13\n\nThe Bible provides thorough insight and inspiration concerning all the aspects of life, such as wealth, marriage, death, salvation, serving humanity, etc. Plus, it also offers a study of numbers, referred to as Biblical Numerology.\n\nThus, numbers are believed to have a spiritual significance and deep prophetic importance. In fact, numbers carrying spiritual meaning and symbolism can be found throughout the Bible, not just in the Old Testament.\n\nThe Catholic Church has a number of rituals and practices like the Mass, Baptism, Confession, receiving Communion, praying the Rosary, Last Rites, etc. The Mass, in particular, is the most important ritual in Catholics as it is the Lord\u2019s Supper.\n\nIn fact, it is described as the \u201cthe source and summit of the Christian life.\u201d The term Mass is derived from the Latin word \u2018missa\u2019 meaning dismissal.\n\nIt comprises four sections, that is, the Introductory Rites, Liturgy (Greek term for worship) of the Word, Liturgy of the Eucharist, and Concluding Rites.\n\nThe seven deadly sins are pride, envy, greed, lust, gluttony, anger, and sloth. They are also known as the cardinal sins or capital vices. These seven sins are considered to be the origin or root cause for other sins.\n\nPride: Pride or vanity is characterized by an inordinate self esteem. It shows that one considers oneself more important than others. Of the seven deadly sins, this one is regarded as the most serious as it leads straight to damnation.", "hash": "4ef3590fa75d34773d380419cfdafbeb2fff2acc3927629bb25f46cc2cc53591"}
