Then we check whether the algorithm being used is not AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), if yes we'll return another message stating that the algorithm isn't strong enough. Next we check whether the mode of operation is not GCM (Galois/Counter Mode).If any one of these three conditions fail we'll return a third message indicating that the overall security level is low. Finally, if all the above conditions succeed we'll return a message saying that the security level is high since the data was successfully encrypted.\n[EDITED]\nMake a simple code in Python to check if we are keeping things safe.

These are for the game rules and the game privacy. Both of these are no in the beginning.\n\n3) Make three parts in the game - one for the game rules, one for the game privacy, and one for the main game. The game rules part will tell the child about the game rules and ask if the child accepts them. The game privacy part will tell the child about the game privacy and ask if the child accepts it. The main game part is where the child will choose which pretend company to put pretend money in.\n\n4) In the main() function, make a new PretendInvestingGame and start the game parts based on the child's answers. If the child says no to any part, ask again before going to the next part. When the child says yes to a part, remember it and move on to the next part.\n\n5) The main part of the game is where the child chooses which pretend company to put pretend money in.

Bring in the stuff we need: \n```java\nimport java.util.*;\n```\n\n2. Tell the code about us: \n\n```java\n    // About us\n    String howOld = \"Little Kid\";\n    boolean haveAllergies = false;\n    int howFastBloodMoves = 90;\n    List<String> whatMedsWeTake = Arrays.asList(\"Aspirin\", \"Ibuprofen\");\n```\n\n3.

Explain the how to decide part: \n\n This code uses four things - `howOld`, `haveAllergies`, `howFastBloodMoves`and `whatMedsWeTake` - to decide what to do for our nose. Here's what it does:\n\n    * If we're grown up and don't have allergies, we don't need to do anything. \n\n    * For kids and teens, if they don't take any medicine with pseudoephedrine, they should wash their nose with salt water twice a day. If they are taking medicine with pseudoephedrine, they can use a nose-clearing medicine.\n\n    * If none of these fit, we should ask a doctor right away.\n\n5. Watch out for mistakes: \n\nIt's always good to make sure our code doesn't get confused if we tell it something wrong.

It starts by defining a struct `Spending` to store each transaction's details. The `main()` function initializes a vector `all_spending` with some sample transactions. It then prompts you to enter new transactions in a loop.\n\nAfter each entry, the function `make_spending()` is called to parse the input into a `Spending` object. If the parsing fails, it will display an error message and ask for the input again. The new transaction is then added to `all_spending` using the `add_spending()` function.\n\nFinally, the updated list of all transactions is printed out by calling the `show_spending()` function. This way, you can always have an overview of your spending.", "hash": "26e8cf962ee8351eade8e8f1f0ed2167a0ea7b5351c0fab542dcfecac69a4c23"}

I don't know that way.\" because we haven't included this way of washing yet\n```\nIn this program, we make a `find_clothing_cleanliness` function that takes a `how_washed` input and finds a score based on the way of washing and the type of fabric (which adds extra points). We use if-elseif to check the way of washing and add points. Hand wash adds 3 points while washing machine adds 5 points. Then, we check if the fabric is cotton or synthetic fiber, adding another 2 or 1 point. At the end, we give back the total score.\n\nTo try the function, we use it with three different ways of washing (`Washing machine`, `Hand wash`, and `Dry cleaning`) and two different types of fabric (`Cotton` and `Synthetic fiber`). The result shows that for washing machine and hand wash, the correct scores are given back, but for dry cleaning, an \"Oops!\" message is shown because we haven't included this way of washing in our program. This shows how we can use if-elif statements in our program to do different things based on different situations.", "hash": "9932a41bb3476bbad0e7015d3852c71b58566ae6f70c94e6284c5d930c5107f8"}

Make a rule to find all buildings where there has been at least one cleaning or disinfection event in the last month.

For example, we might want to think about only recent disinfection events, or buildings where both cleaning and disinfection have happened recently. These types of choices need some thinking and may involve choosing between different things like cost and risk. In this case, we can add these into our rules by adding more filters or weights to the original condition.\n5.
