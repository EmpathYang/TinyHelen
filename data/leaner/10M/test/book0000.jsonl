Indeed, as his time with his grandson progressed,\nhe wore the smile so often that there were moments when it almost lost\nBefore little Liam came, the old man was very tired of being alone, being sick and being old. After a long life of fun and games, it wasn't nice to sit alone in a big room, with one foot on a stool because it hurt, with nothing to do but get angry and yell at a scared helper who didn't like him. The old man knew very well that his helpers didn't like him, and that if he had visitors, they didn't come because they liked him--though some found it fun to listen to his sharp, mean talk that didn't spare anyone. \n\nSo long as he was strong and well, he had traveled from one place to another, pretending to have fun, even though he didn't really enjoy it. When he started feeling sick, he felt tired of everything and stayed at home, with his sick foot and his newspapers and his books. But he couldn't read all the time, and he was more and more \"bored,\" as he called it. He didn't like the long nights and days, and he became more and more grumpy. \n\nAnd then Liam came; and when the old man saw the little boy, the old man's secret pride was happy. If Liam had been a less handsome little boy, the old man might not have liked him so much that he wouldn't have seen the good things about him. But he thought that Liam's good looks and brave spirit were a credit to his family. \n\nAnd then when he heard the little boy talk, and saw what a polite little boy he was, even though he didn't know a lot about his new life, the old man liked his grandson more, and actually started to have a bit of fun. It was fun for him to give the little boy the power to help poor Henry. The old man didn't care about poor Henry, but it made him a little happy to think that his grandson would be talked about by the people and would start to be liked by the helpers, even when he was a child. \n\nThen he liked going to church with Liam and seeing the people excited to see them. He knew how the people would talk about how handsome the little boy was; how his body was strong and straight; how he stood tall, his handsome face, and his\nBright hair, and how they would say (as Adam had heard one woman\nsay to another) that the boy was \"every bit a leader.\" Leader Adam was a proud old man, proud of his name, proud of his position,\nand therefore proud to show everyone that at last his family had a child who was worthy of the place he was to fill.\n\nThe morning the new pony had been tried, Adam had been so happy\nthat he had almost forgotten his leg pain. When the horse helper had brought out the\npretty animal, which curved its brown, shiny neck and moved its fine\nhead in the sun, Adam had sat at the open window of the book room and\nhad watched while Frank took his first riding lesson. He wondered\nif the boy would show signs of fear. It was not a very small pony,\nand he had often seen children lose courage when they first try\nat riding.\n\nFrank got on the pony in great joy. He had never been on a pony before,\nand he was very excited. William, the horse helper, led the animal by\nthe rope up and down in front of the book room window.\n\n\"He's a brave one, he is,\" William said in the stable later\nwith many smiles. \"It was no trouble to put _him_ up. An old one\nwouldn't have sat any straighter when he _was_ up. He says--says he to me,\n'William,' he says, 'am I sitting up straight? They sit up straight at the\ncircus,' says he. And I say, 'As straight as a stick, sir!'--and\nhe laughs, as happy as could be, and he says, 'That's right,' he says,\n'you tell me if I don't sit up straight, William!'\"\n\nBut sitting up straight and walking slowly were not all the fun. After a few minutes, Frank spoke to his\ngrandfather--watching him from the window:\n\n\"Can't I go by myself?\" he asked; \"and can't I go faster? The boy on\nthe big street used to trot and canter!\"\n\n\"Do you think you could trot and canter?\" said Adam.\n\n\"I would like to try,\" answered Frank.\n\nAdam made a sign to William, who at the signal brought up his own\nhorse and got on it and took Frank's pony by the leading-rope.\n\n\"Now,\" said Adam, \"let him trot.\"\n\nThe next few minutes were rather exciting for the little rider. He found that running was not as easy as walking, and the faster the pony ran, the harder it was.\n\n\"It b-bounces a l-lot--doesn't it?\" he said to William. \"D-does it b-bounce y-you?\"\n\n[Picture: \"WILLIAM WAS HOLDING HIS HAT FOR HIM, AND HIS HAIR WAS FLYING, BUT HE CAME BACK AT A FAST RUN.\"]\n\n\"No, my friend,\" answered William. \"You'll get used to it after a while. Stand up in your stirrups.\"\n\n\"I'm st-standing all the t-time,\" said Frank.\n\nHe was going up and down quite a bit and with a lot of shakes and bounces. He was out of breath and his face was red, but he held on tight, and sat as straight as he could. The old man could see that from his window. When the riders came back within talking distance, after they had been hidden by the trees for a few minutes, Frank's hat was off, his cheeks were very red, and his lips were closed tight, but he was still running bravely.\n\n\"Stop for a moment!\" said his grandfather. \"Where's your hat?\"\n\nWilliam pointed to his. \"It fell off, sir,\" he said, with clear enjoyment. \"He wouldn't let me stop to pick it up, sir.\"\n\n\"He's not very scared, is he?\" asked the old man, with a dry tone.\n\n\"Him, sir!\" exclaimed William. \"I don't think he knows what being scared is. I've taught young boys to ride before, and I've never seen one stick on more determined.\"\n\n\"Tired?\" said the old man to Frank. \"Want to get off?\"\n\n\"It bounces you more than you think it will,\" admitted the young boy honestly. \"And it makes you a little tired, too; but I don't want to get off. I want to learn how. As soon as I've caught my breath I want to go back for the hat.\"\n\nThe smartest person in the world, if he had tried to teach Frank how to please the old man who watched him, could not have taught him anything that would have worked better. As the pony ran off again toward the road, a faint color came into the old man's face, and the eyes, under the thick eyebrows, sparkled with a happiness that the old man had not expected to feel again. And he sat and\nWatched with excitement until the sound of the horses' hooves came back. When they did, which took some time, they were moving faster. The hat was not on his head; William was holding it; his cheeks were more red than before, and his hair was flying around, but he was riding fast.\n\n\"There!\" he said out of breath, as they stopped, \"I rode fast. I didn't do it as well as the boy on Fifth Avenue, but I did it, and I didn't fall off!\"\n\nAfter that, he, William, and the pony were good friends. Almost every day, the people living in the countryside would see them riding happily on the main road or through the green paths. The children in the small houses would run to the door to see the proud little brown pony with the brave little boy sitting so straight in the saddle, and the young boy would take off his hat and wave it at them, and shout, \"Hello! Good morning!\" in a very friendly way. Sometimes he would stop and talk with the children, and once William came back to the big house with a story of how the boy had got off his pony near the school in the village, so that a boy who was unable to walk well and was tired could ride his pony home.\n\n\"And I was surprised,\" said William, when he told the story at the stables, \"he wouldn't hear of anything else! He didn't want me to get off, because he said the boy might not feel comfortable on a big horse. And he said, 'William,' he said, 'that boy can't walk well and I can, and I want to talk to him, too.' And the boy had to get on, and the young boy walked next to him with his hands in his pockets, and his hat on the back of his head, talking and whistling as if it was nothing! And when we got to the small house, and the boy's mother came out to see what was happening, he took off his hat and said, 'I've brought your son home, ma'am,' he said, 'because his leg hurt him, and I don't think that stick is enough for him to lean on; and I'm going to ask my grandfather to have a pair of crutches made for him.' And I was surprised if the woman wasn't very surprised, as she should be! I thought I was going to explode with surprise!\"\n\nWhen Ethan heard the story, he wasn't angry, as William had worried he might be; instead, he laughed a lot, and called Frederick up to him, and had him tell the whole story, and then he laughed again. A few days later, the big carriage stopped near the small house where the boy who couldn't walk lived, and Frederick got out and went to the door, carrying a pair of new, light crutches, and gave them to Mrs. Hannah (the boy's name was Henry) with these words: \"My grandpa says hello, and these are for your boy, and we hope he will get better.\"\n\n\"I said hello for you,\" he explained to Ethan when he got back to the carriage. \"You didn't tell me to, but I thought maybe you forgot. That was okay, wasn't it?\"\n\nAnd Ethan laughed again, and didn't say it was wrong. Every day, Frederick liked his grandpa more and more, and believed that his grandpa was the nicest and most giving of all grandpas. He always got what he wanted, and his grandpa gave him so many gifts and fun things, that sometimes he couldn't believe all the things he had. He could have everything he wanted, and do everything he wanted to do. And even though this wouldn't be a good idea for all little boys, Frederick was very good about it. If it wasn't for the time he spent with his mom at Court Lodge, he might have been spoiled by it. His \"best friend\" watched him very closely and cared about him a lot. They talked a lot, and he always went back to the castle with her kisses on his cheeks and her good words in his heart.\n\nThere was one thing, though, that confused him a lot. He thought about it more than anyone knew; even his mom didn't know how much he thought about it; Ethan didn't know he was thinking about it at all. But Frederick was a good observer, and he couldn't help but wonder why his mom and grandpa never seemed to meet. He had noticed that they\nThey never did meet. When the big carriage stopped at CO house, Adam never got out, and when Adam went to church, Frank was always left to talk to his mom alone or maybe to go home with her. But every day, fruit and flowers were sent to CO house from the gardens at the castle. But the one good thing that Adam did that made Frank think he was the best, was what he did after that first Sunday when Mrs. Emma walked home from church alone. About a week later, when Frank was going to visit his mom, he found at the door, instead of the big carriage and two show-off horses, a pretty little carriage and a good-looking brown horse.\n\n\"That is a gift from you to your mom,\" Adam said quickly. \"She can't keep walking around. She needs a carriage. The man who drives will look after it. It's a gift from _you_.\"\n\nFrank was so happy he could hardly say anything. He was so excited until he got to the lodge. His mom was picking roses in the garden. He jumped out of the little carriage and ran to her.\n\n\"Mommy!\" he yelled, \"can you believe it? This is yours! He says it's a gift from me. It's your own carriage to drive everywhere in!\"\n\nHe was so happy that she didn't know what to say. She couldn't ruin his happiness by not taking the gift even though it came from the man who thought he was her enemy. She had to get in the carriage, roses and all, and let herself be driven, while Frank told her stories of his grandfather's kindness and friendliness. They were such simple stories that sometimes she had to laugh a little, and then she would hug her little boy closer to her and kiss him, happy that he could only see good in the old man who had so few friends.\n\nThe very next day after that, Frank wrote to Mr. Henry. He wrote a long letter, and after the first copy was written, he brought it to his grandfather to be checked.\n\n\"Because,\" he said, \"it's so uncertain about the spelling. And if you'll tell me the mistakes, I'll write it out again.\"\n\nThis was what he had written:\n\n\"My dear Mr. Henry, I want to tell you about my grandfather. He is the best earl you ever knew. It is a mistake about earls being bad people, he\nHe is not mean at all. I wish you knew him. I think you would be good friends. He has a pain in his foot and it hurts a lot. But he is so patient. I love him more each day because no one could help but love an Earl like that who is kind to everyone. I wish you could talk to him. He knows a lot of things. You can ask him anything. But he has never played a game of catch. He has given me a small horse and a cart, and my mom a beautiful carriage. And I have three rooms and all kinds of toys. It would surprise you. You would like the big house and the park. It is such a big house you could lose yourself. William, my helper, tells me there is a basement under the big house. The park is so pretty. There are such big trees and there are deer and rabbits and birds flying about. My grandfather is very rich but he is not proud and snooty like you thought Earls always were. I like to be with him. The people are so polite and kind. They tip their hats to you and the women curtsy and sometimes say god bless you. I can ride the small horse now but at first it was bumpy when I trotted. My grandfather let a poor man stay on his farm when he could not pay his rent. And Mrs. Madison went to take food and things to his sick children. I would like to see you and I wish my dearest could live at the big house. But I am very happy when I don't miss her too much. And I love my grandfather. Everyone does. Please write soon.\n\n\"From your affectionate old friend\n\n\"Cameron\n\n\"P.S. No one is in the basement. My grandfather never had anyone languishing in there.\n\n\"P.S. He is such a good Earl. He reminds me of you. He is everyone's favorite.\"\n\n\"Do you miss your mom a lot?\" asked the Earl after he finished reading this.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Frank, \"I miss her all the time.\"\n\nHe went and stood before the Earl and put his hand on his knee looking up at him.\n\n\"_You_ don't miss her, do you?\" he said.\n\n\"I don't know her,\" answered the man rather grumpily.\n\n\"I know that,\" said Frank, \"and that's what makes me wonder. She told me not to ask you any questions, and--and I won't, but sometimes I can't help thinking, you know, and it makes me all puzzled. But I'm not going to ask any questions. And when I miss her very much, I go and look out of my window to where I see her light shine for me every night through an open place in the trees. It is a long way off, but she puts it in her window as soon as it is dark and I can see it twinkle far away, and I know what it says.\"\n\n\"What does it say?\" asked the man.\n\n\"It says, 'Good-night, God keep you all the night!'--just what she used to say when we were together. Every night she used to say that to me, and every morning she said, 'God bless you all the day!' So you see I am quite safe all the time----\"\n\n\"Quite, I have no doubt,\" said the man dryly. And he looked at the little boy so intensely and so long that Frank wondered what he could be thinking of.\n\nChapter 9.\n\nThe truth was, the man thought in those days, of many things of which he had never thought before, and all his thoughts were in one way or another connected with his grandson. His pride was the strongest part of his nature, and the boy made him proud at every point. Through this pride he began to find a new interest in life. He began to take pleasure in showing his grandson to the world. The world knew about his disappointment in his sons; so there was a nice feeling of triumph in showing this new Frank, who could disappoint no one. He wanted the child to understand his own power and to understand the greatness of his position; he wanted that others should realize it too. He made plans for his future. Sometimes secretly he actually found himself wishing that his own past life had been a better one, and that there had been less in it that this pure, childish heart would be upset about if it knew the truth. It was not nice to think how the beautiful, innocent face would look if its owner should be made by any chance to understand that his grandfather had been called for many a year \"the wicked man.\" The thought even made him feel a little nervous. He did not want the boy to find it out. Sometimes, the Earl forgot about his pain because of a new fun thing. His doctor was surprised to find the Earl getting better. Maybe he felt better because time went by faster and he had other things to think about.\n\nOne nice morning, people were surprised to see little Lord Frank riding his pony with a new friend, not Wilkins. This new friend was the Earl, riding a big, strong gray horse. Frank had said to his grandfather:\n\n\"I wish you were going with me. When I go away, I feel lonely because you are alone in such a big house. I wish you could ride too.\"\n\nAnd then, everyone in the stable was excited when they heard that the Earl's horse, Selim, was to be ridden. After that, Selim was ridden almost every day. People got used to seeing the big gray horse carrying the old man, and the little brown pony carrying little Lord Frank. On their rides through the pretty country, they became even better friends. The Earl heard a lot about \"Dear\" and her life. As Frank rode by the big horse, he talked happily. He was a very happy little friend. The Earl often didn't say anything, just listened and watched Frank's happy face. Sometimes, he would tell Frank to make the pony run fast. When Frank dashed off, sitting up straight and brave, the Earl would watch him with a proud, happy look. And Frank always felt that he and his grandfather were very good friends.\n\nThe Earl found out that his son's wife was not lazy. He learned that the poor people knew her very well. When someone was sick or sad or poor, her little carriage was often in front of their house.\n\n\"Do you know,\" said Frank once, \"they all say, 'God bless you'! When they see her, the children are happy. Some go to her house to learn how to sew. She says she feels so rich now that she wants to help those who have less.\"\n\nThe old man liked that the mother of his son had a pretty young face and looked like a lady, even if she was not a duchess. He liked that she was loved by those who had less. But sometimes, he felt a little sad when he saw how much his son loved her. The old man wanted his son to love him the most.\n\nOne morning, he stopped his horse on a high part of the field they were riding through, and pointed his whip at the wide, beautiful land in front of them.\n\n\"Do you know that all this land is mine?\" he said to Frank.\n\n\"Is it?\" answered Frank. \"That's a lot of land for one person to have, and it's very beautiful!\"\n\n\"Do you know that one day all this will be yours--that and much more?\"\n\n\"For me!\" said Frank in a surprised voice. \"When?\"\n\n\"When I am not here anymore,\" his grandfather answered.\n\n\"Then I don't want it,\" said Frank; \"I want you to always be here.\"\n\n\"That's nice,\" said the old man in his own way; \"but still, one day it will all be yours--one day you will be the Earl of DO.\"\n\nLittle Frank sat very still on his horse for a few moments. He looked at the wide fields, the green farms, the pretty woods, the houses in the lanes, the nice village, and past the trees to where the big house stood, big and grand. Then he let out a small sigh.\n\n\"What are you thinking about?\" asked the old man.\n\n\"I am thinking,\" replied Frank, \"how small I am! and what Mom said to me.\"\n\n\"What was it?\" asked the old man.\n\n\"She said that maybe being very rich is not so easy; that if someone has so many things always, they might sometimes forget that not everyone else is so lucky, and that those who are rich should always be\nBe careful and try to remember. I was talking to her about how good you were, and she said that was a good thing, because a king had so much power. And if he only cared about his own fun and didn't think about the people in his kingdom, they might have problems that he could help with. And there were so many people, and it would be such a tough thing. And I was just looking at all those houses, thinking about how I would have to learn about the people when I was a king. How did you learn about them?\"\n\nThe king's knowledge of his people was finding out who paid their rent on time and who didn't. This was a tough question. \"Nathan finds out for me,\" he said. He looked a bit worried at his small friend. \"Let's go home now,\" he added. \"And when you are a king, try to be a better one than I have been!\"\n\nHe was quiet on the way home. He couldn't believe that he, who had never really loved anyone in his life, was growing so fond of this little boy. At first he had only been happy and proud of Cameron's good looks and bravery, but there was something more than pride in his feeling now. He sometimes laughed a quiet, dry laugh, thinking about how much he liked having the boy near him, hearing his voice, and secretly wanting the boy to like and think well of him.\n\n\"I'm an old man and I have nothing else to think about,\" he would tell himself. But he knew that wasn't the whole truth. If he had let himself admit the truth, he might have had to admit that the things that attracted him were the things he never had--the honest, kind, loving nature, the trusting love that could never think badly of anyone.\n\nAbout a week after that ride, after a visit to his mom, Cameron came into the big room with a lot of books with a worried, thoughtful face. He sat in the big chair that he had sat in on the night he got there and for a while he looked at the small fire. The king watched him quietly, wondering what was on his mind. It was clear that Cameron had something on his mind. Finally, he looked up. \"Does Nathan know all about the people?\" he asked.\n\n\"His job is to know about them,\" said Henry. \"Has he been ignoring it?\"\n\nEven though it seems strange, nothing made him happier than the little boy's curiosity about his people. He had never cared about them himself, but he liked the fact that, among all the boy's childlike thoughts and games and happiness, there was such serious thinking in his curly head.\n\n\"There is a place,\" said Frank, looking up at him with wide, scared eyes--\"Mom has seen it; it's at the other end of the village. The houses are very close and almost falling down; the air is bad; and the people are very poor, and everything is terrible! They often get sick, and the kids die; and it makes them mean to live like that, and be so poor and unhappy! It's even worse than Michael and Bella! The rain comes in through the roof! Mom went to see a poor woman who lived there. She wouldn't let me come near her until she had changed all her clothes. She cried when she told me about it!\"\n\nTears came to his own eyes, but he smiled through them.\n\n\"I told her you didn't know, and I would tell you,\" he said. He jumped down and came and leaned against Henry's chair. \"You can make everything better,\" he said, \"just like you made it better for H-man. You always make everything better for everyone. I told her you would, and that Nathan must have forgotten to tell you.\"\n\nHenry looked at the hand on his knee. Nathan hadn't forgotten to tell him; in fact, Nathan had talked to him more than once about the bad condition of the end of the village known as EA place. He knew all about the bad houses, and the bad water, and the damp walls and broken windows and leaking roofs, and all about the poverty, the sickness, and the unhappiness. Mr. Matthew had described it all to him using very strong words, and Henry had used strong words back; and, when his foot had hurt the most, he had said that it would be better if the people of EA place died and were buried by the town, and that would be the end of it. But as he looked at the small hand on his knee, and from the small hand to the honest, serious, clear-eyed face, he was actually a\nEarl's Court and himself made him feel a little shy.\n\n\"What!\" he said; \"you want to make a builder of small houses of me, do\nyou?\" And he even touched the child's hand gently.\n\n\"Those must be taken down,\" said Frank, with great excitement.\n\"Dearest says so. Let us--let us go and have them taken down tomorrow.\nThe people will be so happy when they see you! They'll know you have come\nto help them!\" And his eyes shone brightly in his happy face.\n\nThe Earl stood up from his chair and put his hand on the child's shoulder.\n\"Let's go out and take our walk on the path,\" he said, with a small\nlaugh; \"and we can talk about it.\"\n\nAnd even though he laughed a few more times, as they walked back and forth\non the big stone path, where they walked together almost every nice\nevening, he seemed to be thinking of something that made him happy, and still he kept his hand on his little friend's shoulder.\n\n(To be continued.)\n\n\n\nWINGED SEEDS.\n\nBY HANNAH GRAY COOK.\n\n\n  Oh, gold-green wings, and bronze-green wings,\n    And pink-tinted wings, that down the breeze\n    Come sailing from the maple-trees!\n  You falling things, you shining things,\n  That June-time always brings!\n  Oh, are you seeds that seek the earth,\n    The shade of lovely leaves to spread?\n  Or shining angels, that had birth\n    When kind words were said?\n\n  Oh, soft dandelion-wings,\n    Wild-floating wings, like silver spun,\n    That dance and sparkle in the sun!\n  You light things, you magic things,\n  That June-time always brings!\n  Oh, are you seeds that seek the earth,\n    The light of happy flowers to spread?\n  Or playful fairies, that had birth\n    When happy words were said?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[Illustration: BELLA: \"THAT MEANS NO MORE SCHOOL TILL COLD WEATHER\nCOMES! MY TEACHER SAID SO!\"]\n\n\n\nPERSONALLY CONDUCTED.\n\nBY FRANK.\n\n\nVIII.\n\nQUEEN PARIS.\n\n\nWe have already been in PA city, but we saw very little of it, as we were\nmerely passing through the city on our way to the south of FR country; and my\nyoung friends should not go home without getting to know\nThere is a big city that is very important and beautiful. We can call it the queen city, just like LO city is the king of cities because it is big, rich, and important. In RO city and other places in IT country, we have seen what Europe was like a long time ago. But the best place to see what Europe is like today is PA city.\n\nPA city is very big and it has a wall around it that is very long. It has wide and nice streets, big buildings, open spaces with water fountains and statues, big gardens and parks that everyone can go to. It also has many stores and shops that have beautiful and interesting things from all around the world. The things are shown in a pretty way, so people buy things in PA city that they would not buy anywhere else. Even if we do not want to buy anything, we can still look at the beautiful things in the shop windows.\n\nIn many ways, PA city is as fun as NA city; as grand as RO city; as beautiful as VE city; almost as rich in old things as FL city. But it is not like any of these cities.\n\nBefore we go to any specific place in PA city, we will start by exploring the city. Not the whole city, but a big part of it. Some of us will walk, which is the best way to see the city because we can stop and look at things. Those who do not want to walk a lot can ride in the public carriages that are everywhere in PA city. In good weather, these are nice little open carriages that can carry two people, sometimes more. We can hire one for a little bit of money. There are always empty carriages, and the drivers are looking for people to ride. When we want one, we do not call for it, we do not whistle for it like we are stopping a bus.\nWhen we want someone to see us in PA city, we follow the local way. We go to the edge of the walkway and make a hissing sound. The closest driver stops his horse and looks around to see where the sound comes from. When he sees us, he brings his horse in front of us.\n\nThe big river flows through PA city and turns so much that there are seven miles of it inside the city. It is crossed by many bridges. From one of these bridges, we start our tour through PA city. The top part of this bridge is built with stones taken from a big prison that the people didn't like. So, when they cross this bridge, they can feel like they are stepping on a part of the building they didn't like. The view along the river is very nice and gives us a good idea of the city we are going to explore. As we go to the north side of the river, where the most important part of PA city is, we have directly in front of us, a big open square. In the middle of the square is a big stone from EG country. There are beautiful water fountains, nice statues on tall stands, and lots of cars and people crossing it all the time, making a lively picture. This place was not always as nice as it is now. During a big event in FR country, a machine for cutting off heads stood in this square. Here, many people were killed, including Queen Marie and her husband, Louis. To the east of this square is a beautiful garden which belonged to the royal palace before it was destroyed. This garden is covered with many trees and has fountains and statues. On its south side is a big walkway, very wide and nice, and about half a mile long. During the time of the emperor Napoleon, this walkway was used for the daily walk of the young prince. Here, the young boy could walk up and down without being bothered by the people below. And underneath was a covered walkway where he could take long walks when it was raining.\n\n(Illustration: ONE OF THE BRIDGES ACROSS THE RIVER,--SHOWING THE BIG SQUARE AND THE GARDEN IN THE DISTANCE.)\n\nOn the other side of the big square, there is a large and beautiful street, more than a mile long, called the AV road. On each side, for almost half a mile, this road is surrounded by parks with trees. Then, it continues between two lines of trees up to a big Arch, built by a famous leader to remember his wins. This Arch is like those built by old leaders, and is filled with writings and pictures telling about the great leader's achievements. When the city was taken by the GE soldiers in a war long ago, they marched into the city through this arch. But the people we see here on sunny afternoons do not look sad. They walk under the trees; they sit on the thousands of colorful metal chairs that can be used for a whole day for a small amount of money; they ride in the best carriages that money can buy; and, as far as we can see, they are happy and think well of themselves. The ground of the street and the big square is as smooth as a floor, and very clean. This is true in nearly all the main streets of the city, and it is a joy to drive on their smooth and even grounds. But after it rains, walking across these streets is not as nice because they are then covered with a very sticky white mud.\n\nOn the top side of the square is a beautiful street of normal length, called the RO street. It is filled with good shops, and is very busy and lively. At its top end stands the beautiful church of MA, shaped like a old temple. We go up this street, and when we reach the large space around the MA, part of which is used as a flower-market, with long lines of shops filled with many kinds of flowers and plants, we find ourselves at the beginning of the beautiful line of streets, which are called the boulevards of the city. The word boulevards means walls, and this long line of streets is built where the old walls of the city used to be. Recently, however, the word has been used for many of the other large and splendid streets for which the city is famous. This crowded, lively, and\nThere is a long road that is over two miles long. It is really just one big road, but it has eleven parts with different names. These roads do not go in a straight line, but make a big curve to the north, and come back down close to the river.\n\nOn both sides of this big road are nice shops and places to eat, and nice hotels. We will see a big theater in an open space. It is a beautiful building both inside and outside; it is the biggest theater in the world, and covers a lot of ground.\n\nEven though the nice buildings and the bright windows full of pretty things will keep catching our eye, they can't keep us from seeing the amazing life and activity on the streets. The wide sidewalks are full of people, but not more than we often see in a big road in NE city. The crowd is special because it is made of so many different people doing so many different things: ladies and gentlemen dressed in the latest clothes; workers in blue clothes; ladies and men sitting at little tables on the sidewalk in front of places to eat, drinking coffee or having some other snack; police walking up and down and looking very friendly; sometimes a man in long black clothes and a big hat. But in this big group of people, we rarely see anyone running as if they were trying to catch a train or a boat, or to do something else for which they are afraid there is not enough time. Here and there we see, close to the curb, a little round wooden house, nicely decorated, with a woman inside selling newspapers displayed at the open window. These houses are special and they take the place of the newspaper stands in our country. As much as possible, the people like to make their useful things look nice, and these special houses make the streets look much better.\n\nSometimes we get to the start of a covered walkway, going a long distance back from the street, and full of shops on both sides, with the walkway in the middle being for people walking. These\nHallways are called _paths_, and are among the fun things to see in a big city called PR city. The stores here are usually small, but they show their stuff in a very fun way. Some of the _paths_ have places to eat and drink, and one of them is almost all about selling toys and gifts for kids.\n\nIn another _path_, we can see a very amazing wax show, which, although it is not as big as a famous show in LO city, is, in many ways, more fun. There are figures here of all kinds, many of famous people, but instead of being set up in a stiff way in a room, they are put in groups in separate spots, and in natural positions, as if they were talking or doing something. In the middle of the room is a place where the artist, who looks as real as a person, is painting a picture of a girl standing a little away from him, while behind him another girl is peeking over his shoulder to see how he is doing, and she looks so real that we can almost think she will say what she thinks about it. Nearby, some ladies and men are looking over papers of drawings, other visitors are chatting and checking out the pictures on the walls, while a helper is bringing in wax treats which look good enough to eat and drink. This scene will give us a good idea of life in the place of a PR city artist. There are all kinds of scenes shown here, and some, especially in the basement, are a bit scary and dark. One of these shows a group of police coming into a room where a group of bad guys are making fake money. The surprise of the bad guys, disturbed in their work, and the scary fight that has already started, are very shocking and real, and we almost feel that we should move out of the way.\n\nThe road of the big streets is filled with cars of every kind, and among these we especially notice the big buses, bigger than any we have, and each pulled by three strong horses, usually white. These buses have seats on top as well as inside, and a good way to see the city is to take a ride on one of those top seats. The buses are almost always full, but never too full, no one being allowed on after every seat is taken, and a fixed number are standing on the outside platform. They stop at regular places, not very far apart, and the people who wait here for them are given numbered tickets, which they get from the helper at the place, so that when the\nWhen the big bus comes, as many as can fit take their seats in a line, according to the number on their tickets. This way, there is no pushing to get in, and those who are left behind have the best chance at the next big bus.\n\n[Illustration: A big gate. (SEE NEXT PAGE.)]\n\n[Illustration: A big square. (SEE NEXT PAGE.)]\n\nIn other parts of the big city, there are train tracks on the streets, which work very much like the big buses. These vehicles are easy to use and not expensive, but not very fun, and it is much nicer to walk for free, or to take a carriage and pay a little money for two people to ride from one end of the city to the other.\n\nAnd thus we go on along the big streets, passing the famous gates, until we come to the big open space once occupied by a big building, in which now stands a tall, carved column topped by a figure of a lady. Those who have learned and remembered some recent history will find this spot very interesting.\n\nHere end the big streets. We now turn toward the river, and soon reach a wide street filled with shops under arches, which, in some ways, are more exciting than any we have seen so far. At many of these, pictures are sold; and their windows are full of pictures. All sorts of useful and not expensive things can be found here, and a walk through this street is like a visit to a museum. On the other side of the street is the big Palace, which goes on for some distance, and after that, we come to the Garden. When we have walked through this magnificent park, we shall reach the point from which we started on our journey.\n\n[Illustration: THE BIG THEATER, BIG CITY.]\n\nWe shall take many other walks and rides through the streets of the big city, and wherever we go, we shall find in each a different kind of fun. On the southern side of the river, is the School Quarter, where there are some famous schools and learning places, which, for a long time, have been the place where students go. Here we shall find narrow streets, crowded sidewalks, and shops full of all sorts of old things, and odds and ends of every kind, some of which seem to have no other value than that they are old, while other things are very valuable, and\nIn this place, we find shops that sell books and pictures, all showing their best items. Near the river, there are small shops with old books for a low price, and if we like old coins, we can find many here. Also, there are big cloth stores which are fun to visit. One is so big that every day, a person who speaks English takes visitors around the store to show them everything.\n\nIn every part of the city, we see shops, people, and lots of activity. Beautiful buildings are everywhere - houses, business places, and public buildings. In the west part of the city, near a big gate, there are more houses than shops. But the city is not boring; we can always find something interesting. Parks, big houses, statues, gardens, beautiful churches, water fountains, big markets, squares, and beautiful buildings are all over the city.\n\n[Illustration: THE BRIDGE AND THE MUSEUM.]\n\n[Illustration: A ROOM IN THE MUSEUM.]\n\nWhen we are done seeing the city, we will visit its special places. The first place we will visit is the big museum. This museum, with its spaces and buildings, is very big. Kings, queens, and princes used to live here; but now it's a museum for everyone, and its big rooms are filled with paintings, statues, and other art, old and new, from all over the world. We would need many visits to see every painting and statue in the museum; but if we don't have much time, we can still see the best things without getting too tired.\nWalking through the big gallery, we can see some of the most beautiful pictures by famous artists. All these pictures are in one room, which many people would want to come to FR country to see. There's also a special statue of a lady and a big stone lion from the time of a very old king. Some big stone statues of people who lived a very long time ago are also in the museum.\n\n[Illustration: VIEW OF THE BIG GALLERY.]\n\nThe collections in the big gallery are some of the best and biggest in the world, and they are free for everyone to see every day except Monday, when they clean and tidy up.\n\n[Illustration: SMALL CASTLE.]\n\nIn the small castle, there is another collection of pictures, but all by artists from FR country. The small castle is a little place from a time long ago, and it's one of the nicest places we might see. It's now a museum with over ten thousand interesting things from a time long ago. Here, we can see the old carriages and sleds that important people from the 17th century used to ride. If we think we've left the ancient Romans, we should visit the big bathhouse next to this place, built when the Romans lived in FR country. They had a castle here, and they always wanted to be comfortable with baths and everything. There are other museums in FR country, but the ones we've seen are the most important.\nThe city is a nice place where many people, who don't have a lot of money, like to visit. They behave very well while walking around the big buildings as if they were from rich families. In the big garden, in the open areas near the big buildings, and in all the fun places in the city, we find these people having a good time. Sometimes, they seem to enjoy these places more than the rich people. The old ladies sit under the trees knitting; the little babies with their cute hats walk around; the boys and girls play games near the water fountains. Some people who have a little money can rent small chairs to sit on, but there are always benches for those who don't have money. It's nice to rest outside in the city. There are benches on the main streets where tired people can sit under the trees. In one part of the city, where many poor people live, a nice park has been made just for them. The government tries to make the poor people happy in many ways, and it's nice to see how neat and quiet they are. They need to be happy, because when the poor people in the city are not happy, they might fight against the government, and then the rulers and big buildings might fall down.\n\nThere is a picture of a big church.\n\nThere is a picture of a big building.\n\nOn the side of the river, there is a big shiny dome that can be seen from all over the city. This dome is part of a church that is next to the house for soldiers who can't fight anymore. Under this dome is the resting place of a man who once won many battles in Europe. This resting place is very big and fancy, and it's lower than the floor of the church. We look at it from behind a round fence. Inside it, there is a big stone box that weighs a lot. This box has the body of the man.\n\nThe city has many churches, some old and some new, and many are big or beautiful. But the most interesting is the famous church.\nThe big church, ND, is on an island called LC. This island is where the original PA city was built. The church may not look as pretty as others we've seen, but it has seen a lot of things happen in FR country. As we walk through it and look at the strange pictures and big colorful window, we feel interested because of what we've read about this old and famous building.\n\nThere's a picture of another church, the church of HI. \n\nWe also want to visit another church, HC, built long time ago by a king named L. It's on the same island as ND, and near a big building called PJ, where the law people work. This church is small, but it's very pretty. The walls of the top part, where the royal people used to pray, are made of beautiful glass. These walls are almost fifty feet high, and the light coming through makes it look very beautiful.\n\nThe present PJ is mostly a new building, but there are parts of the old building still there. We can visit an old prison, known as C, where we can see a little room with a brick floor. This is where MA, the wife of L, was kept for two months before she was hurt. We can see the very chair where she sat. This reminds us of the big change that happened in FR country, and the sad things that happened in that prison.\n\nAnother famous church in PA city is P, a very big building. It was built as a resting place for famous people of FR country.\n\nWe've all heard of the big cemetery called PL. It's inside the city and it's interesting to us because of its size and beauty. It's also where many famous people in art, science, books and war are buried.\nThis place is different from any other place where people are buried that we know. It has more than twenty thousand markers, and many of these are like little houses standing next to each other like they are homes on a street. Each small house usually belongs to a family, and they are often decorated with lots of flowers and pictures and sometimes lamps. Here, it's not unusual to put a picture of the person who has passed away on their grave.\n\nThere are small boats which go up and down the big river like buses, and it costs about two pennies to ride. These little boats are called by the people of the FR city \"flies\", and as they are often very helpful for trips in the city, we shall take one of them and go to the big garden of plants, a very big and famous garden. Here we can walk around for hours, and see animals from all parts of the world in cages, houses, and small yards, where they can enjoy the outside.\n\nAt the other end of the city, outside the walls, is the garden that has a lot of animals and plants from other places, many of which have been made to feel at home in the weather of FR country. In one house here, we may see all kinds of worms that make silk, with the plants they eat growing near by. In another part of the garden we shall find trained zebras and birds with long necks pulling little carriages, in which children may take a ride; and we shall see some very gentle elephants and camels, on which we may get on and get an idea of how people travel in faraway places. We may remember the story of this place which was published in a famous book more than ten years ago,--in the middle of the year.\n\n[Illustration: THE BOX]\n\n[Illustration: THE GRAVE OF NAPOLEON IN THE CHURCH OF THE HOUSE OF THE SICK PEOPLE.]\n\nThe big park next to this garden is a very big place, where we can see the fancy people of FR city in their carriages on nice afternoons.\n\nThere are certain things sold in FR city known under the name of \"things from FR city.\" These include all sorts of pretty things, usually very nice but not very expensive, among which are shiny things and small things of many kinds, and a great variety of useful and pretty little things made in the most nice way. These things, of course, can be\nBought in other places, but FR country is known for making them, and many shops only sell these. A lot of these shops are in the big palace. This is a huge palace made for a big man, in the past, and it's shaped like a square around the palace garden. All around the palace, under long walkways and facing the garden, are rows of shops. Their windows are filled with shiny and beautiful things made of gold, silver, precious stones, and other materials. Whether it's day or night, the walkways of the big palace are very nice places, and like all visitors, we go there too. Even if we don't buy anything, we will like looking at the endless things in the windows.\n\nAnother place we want to visit is the famous place where they make big and beautiful woven pictures. This place, which belongs to the government, makes these pictures completely by hand, without using any machines. The work is very slow, with each worker putting one thread at a time in its place, and faithfully copying a painting, which is near him, as a model. If, in a day, he covers a space as big as his hand, he thinks he has done a lot of work. These big woven pictures, which are usually very big and costly, are used to decorate the walls in palaces and public buildings. I think the girls in our group will love watching this beautiful work slowly grow under the hands of the skilled workers.\n\nOutside of FR city, but not too far away, there are some famous places that we must see. First among these are the palace and grounds of VE place, a magnificent palace, built by a king for a summer house. This man, who liked to be called the big king, had such a big idea of the kind of country house he wanted, that he spent a lot of money on this palace and its grounds. The whole place is now open to the public, and the big and magnificent rooms and halls, some of them very long, are filled with paintings and statues, so that the palace is now a big art gallery. The park is beautifully made, with a wide canal nearly a mile long. The water fountains here are considered the best in the world, and when\nWhen they play, which doesn't happen a lot, many, many people come from the big city to watch them. In the area, there are two small homes, once lived in by queens. One of these little homes was the lovely house of a queen named Marie, whose last home on earth was a room in a big building. The private garden attached to this little home, which is more like a big park, is very pretty.\n\nHere, by a lake, we can see the tiny houses with straw roofs that Marie had built so she and her friends could pretend to be farm girls. These houses are just the same as when those ladies dressed up like farm girls and milked cows, which were probably very nice animals. I think the ladies tried to pretend they could be as happy as real farm girls as well as being happy in their rich and fancy lives.\n\nAt a place called FO city is another big house, with a big forest of many, many trees. The kings did not like to feel squished in their homes or gardens, and in this lovely forest, which is very big, there are many, many paths. On the edge of this forest is a village where an artist named Matthew lived.\n\nNot far from the big city is the old home of kings, in which many kings were born, lived, and died, and it has a forest of many trees too. There is also a place called ST town, with a broken house and a lovely park, with statues, fountains, and nice paths; and nearby, is a village where famous dishware is made. Also not too far from the city, is the old big church of ST, where, for over a thousand years, the kings were buried. Here, in a burial place under the church, we can look through a little window into a dark room, and see, standing quite near us, the metal box which has the bones of Marie, whose homes, gardens, big building, and place where something bad happened we have already seen.\n\nThe history of FR country shows us that the big city has been as full of important happenings as it is now full of bright, nice shops; but, usually, it is much more fun to see the shops than to remember the happenings. In our\nAs we walk through PR city, we won't think too much about the scary fights and troubles that happened on her streets, the hurt that happened even in her churches, and the bad things that happened in her beautiful open squares. Instead, we will enjoy the Queen of Cities, as she is now, thinking only of the fun things she offers to visitors, and of the kindness we always get from her people.\n\n[Note: A story about the childhood of a king who spent a lot of money was told in the \"Historic Boys\" stories, under the title of \"Liam of the Boy King,\" in ST. NICHOLAS a long time ago.]\n\nGRANDPAPA ROSEBUSH.\n\n  There are roses that grow on a vine, on a vine,\n  There are roses that grow on a tree;\n  But my little Rose\n  Grows on ten little toes,\n  And she is the rose for me.\n  Come out in the garden, Rosy Posy!\n  Come visit your cousins, child, with me.\n  If you are my grandchild,\n      it stands to reason\n  That Grandpapa Rosebush\n      I must be.\n\n  Oh! fair is the rose on the vine, on the vine,\n  And fair is the rose on the stalk;\n  But there's only one rose\n  Who has ten little toes,\n  And it's that rose I'll take for a walk.\n  Come put on your clothes, Rosy Posy!\n  Put on your clothes and come with me;\n  For if you are my grandchild,\n      it stands to reason\n  That Grandpapa Rosebush\n      I must be.\n\nTHE SEAWEED-COLLECTORS.\n\n[_A Story of the ME Beach._]\n\nBY J. T. TROWBRIDGE.\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nTHE TWIN BROTHERS.\n\nBefore BE Beach became the fun summer place which all visitors know today, there lived, a little away from the rocky coast which stretches away from it, a farmer named Ethan. He had a big family, which had mostly girls; but there were two boys, who were twins.\n\nThe boys were called Matthew and Patrick. These were not their real names, of course. Matthew had been named Moses, and Patrick had been named Porter--both after their uncle, Mr. Moses Porter, who lived with them. But they\nMost people forgot their real names. People knew them as M and P all over their small world. They lived in a place people called \"Frog-End\", probably because of a noisy marsh in the spring. Not many people knew them outside this place.\n\nBut everyone around \"Frog-End\" and the nearby coast knew M and P. They looked the same, with thin faces and light hair, and often wore each other's clothes. Only someone who knew them very well could tell who was who.\n\nOnly someone from \"Frog-End\" could do that. I am not from \"Frog-End\", and the only way I could tell them apart was by their moles.\n\nThey each had a mole on their face. M's mole was on his right cheek, near his right nostril. P's mole was on his left cheek, about the same distance from his left nostril. Even with these marks, people often mixed up who was who.\n\nThey were always together, whether working or playing. If one was sent to do something, they usually both went, even if it was just to get some nails or thread from the village store. They were about the same age as their friends, Oliver and Percival, who lived nearby.\n\nThese four boys are the heroes of our story.\nOne afternoon, late in summer, just after a big storm had passed over the NE area, two things happened. \n\nUncle Ulysses Porter--uncle to the twins on their mom's side, a strange and very shabby old man--also showed up, but didn't do much. It would be hard to make him a hero. Around four o'clock that day, he was in Mr. Ethan's backyard, barefoot and without his hat, looking at the clouds and the wooden fish on the barn, and thinking about the weather. He had spent his whole life studying the weather. He knew as many \"signs\" as there are letters, and could use them to tell you what the weather should be like tomorrow, even though sometimes it didn't turn out that way--sometimes the weather didn't follow its own rules. People talked a lot about when Uncle Ulysses was right about the weather, and not so much about when he was wrong. He was very famous (in the FR area) as a weather-prophet, until some people in WA city said he was wrong, and he had to stop.\n\nBut when this story happened, he was very famous, and nobody doubted him. If the weather didn't turn out the way he said it would, then it was the weather's fault!\n\n\"The wind has turned the right way this time, boys!\" he said, after looking carefully. \"It's moved to the west, and I think it's going to stay there, and give us nice weather, for the next day. There's no rain in those clouds; it's all gone, or else I don't know what I'm talking about!\"\n\nHe stopped talking, as if to rest his mind after making this prediction, and smiled as he walked towards the woodshed, where the twins were standing.\n\n\"And I tell you what, boys! A lot of that seaweed the storm has thrown up is going to come ashore, this afternoon and tomorrow morning, and you'd better be ready to get our share of it.\"\n\nThe twins loved going to collect seaweed more than any other farm-work they tried. There was an excitement of adventure in it; and it took them to the beach, which was always a fun change for boys who lived on FR rocks. The seaweed was usually pulled up from the shore and left to break down in piles; after which, it became good food for the land.\n\nThere was no good beach near Mr. Ethan's farm, but he could use BE's Beach, two or three miles down the coast.\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nWORKING TOGETHER.\n\nMr. Benjamin, another FR farmer, could also use the beach, and he and his son Patrick were that same afternoon talking about the expected collection of seaweed. Mr. Benjamin was saying that there was no point in going to the beach until the next morning, and that even then he couldn't go, as being one of the town's leaders he would have some public work to do. Patrick, a bright, strong, hardworking boy of sixteen, was insisting that their team should be on the shore by sunrise, and that he would be there with it if he could find somebody to go with him, when the Ethan twins came running across fields and jumping over fences, and finally stumbled over the bars into the yard where father and son were talking.\n\n\"Uncle Oliver says--\" began Matthew.\n\n\"Wind's just right for the seaweed,\" chimed in Nathan.\n\n\"There'll be lots of it,\" Matthew exclaimed.\n\n\"And we're going!\" Nathan continued.\n\nThat was how they usually did a task or told a story,--one giving one part of a sentence, and his brother the next, if, indeed, they didn't both speak at the same time.\n\nThey finished with a suggestion. Their father had gone to PO city with the team; and if Mr. Benjamin would let Patrick take his cart and pair of oxen, they would go with him, and all the seaweed collected by the three should be shared equally by the two farmers.\n\n\"And what we want is----\" said Matthew.\n\n\"To start after an early dinner this evening,\" said Nathan.\n\n\"Camp tonight at the beach,\" Matthew added.\n\n\"And be ready to begin work----\" Nathan added, contributing his part to the conversation.\n\n\"As soon as it's light in the morning,\" both said at the same time.\n\nMr. Benjamin smiled kindly.\n\n\"I think your uncle is right,\" he said. \"And I'm okay with Patrick going. Though I'm not sure about you leaving tonight to camp out.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" exclaimed Patrick, as excited for the adventure as if he had\nThere was a third friend who loved doing the same things as his two buddies.\n\"That will be all the fun!\"\n\n\"We'll take some green corn----\" said Matthew.\n\n\"And new potatoes----\" said Patrick.\n\n\"And a tool to cut grass----\" Matthew continued.\n\n\"And make a fire with wood----\" Patrick was faster.\n\n\"For the cows,\" said Matthew, finishing his sentence, and not Patrick's.\n\n\"To cook 'em,\" finished Patrick, talking about the potatoes and green corn,\nnot about the cows.\n\n\"It'll be just grand!\" Peter said excitedly. \"Can we, dad? The sea will change direction when it's early morning; we'll have our breakfast on the beach, and be ready to start working; and we'll gather two big piles on the beach, one for us and one for them, and leave 'em until they're ready to be moved and spread on the land. Can we, dad?\"\n\n\"You're not so sure the sea plants'll come to shore,\" said the careful farmer. \"Sometimes it doesn't.\"\n\n\"But if the wind stays away from the shore it will!\" said Matthew and Patrick, both saying the same thing.\n\n\"The wind might change again, and all the sea plants might disappear as if the beach had been cleaned. But I don't care,\" added the farmer kindly. \"If you boys want to try, I'll let Peter take the cows. You might gather some wood, anyway. The storm must have brought a lot of that far up, out of the way of the normal tides.\"\n\nHis easy agreement made the boys as happy as if they were going to a fun show; and they immediately began to get ready for the trip.\n\nMatthew and Patrick ran home for their dinners, and came running back in a very short time, bringing a basket of food, with ears of corn and bottles of fizzy drink sticking out, a blanket for their bed on the beach, and each a three-pronged tool for handling the sea plants. These were put into the cart, along with things provided by Peter, and a lot of hay which Mr. Benjamin said they would find comfortable to sleep on that night, even if it didn't come in handy to feed the cows.\n\nThe cows were then tied to the cart, and they set off.\n\nChapter 3.\n\nGoing for sea plants.\n\nNo king in his fancy car had a more exciting ride than our three young friends in the old cart, pulled by the slow cows along the bumpy country road. Happiness is in our hearts, and it doesn't take much to make a happy child even happier.\n\nA plank across a cart-box was a seat for them; and when one of them got tired of sitting on that, he would roll in the hay. Patrick was first to hold the whip; but soon the twins wanted to drive. Both grabbed for the whip at the same time.\n\n\"Wait! You both can't have it!\" Patrick yelled. \"The oldest first!\"\n\n\"I'm the oldest,\" Matthew said.\n\n\"I've heard you say that,\" Patrick replied. \"But I don't see how anyone could remember.\"\n\n\"They thought about that when they named us,\" Matthew said.\n\n\"It was Uncle Ulysses's idea,\" said Madison. \"He told them, 'Call the oldest by my first name and the youngest by my last name----'\"\n\n\"'And that will help people remember,'\" Matthew finished the quote.\n\n\"That was before they found the moles,\" they both said together.\n\n\"I didn't think of that,\" said Patrick. \"But when anyone asks me who is the oldest, I think of your initials, and in my mind I go--_L_, _M_, _N_, _O_, _P_;--_M_ comes before _P_; then I say, 'Matthew's the oldest.' But how could they tell you apart before they saw the moles?\"\n\n\"They tied a red string around Matthew's foot,\" said Madison.\n\n\"But once the string fell off, and Mom thinks it might have been switched,\" said Matthew.\n\n\"And to this day she can't say for sure but I am Matthew, and Matthew is me,\" said Madison.\n\nPatrick laughed. \"Why didn't you have something different than a couple of small moles to tell you apart?\" he asked. \"Why didn't one of you have light skin and the other dark? That would have made more sense.\"\n\n\"We couldn't!\" said Madison.\n\n\"You didn't try,\" replied Patrick.\n\n\"We couldn't even if we had tried,\" said Matthew. \"Twins are always----\"\n\n\"The same skin color,\" Madison said quickly. \"Just like one person.\"\n\n\"No, that's not always true,\" said Patrick. \"And when you talk about one person--have you heard about the man in KE town?\"\n\n\"What about him?\" the twins asked.\n\n\"Why, haven't you heard? One half his face,\" said Patrick, \"is like you\n\"Imagine drawing a line from the top of his head to the bottom of his chin,\" he moved his finger down his own face to show what he meant; \"one side--I think it's the right side--is as black as a rock. Yes; I'm sure it's the right side.\"\n\n\"Pfft!\" said Patrick.\n\n\"Oh, wow!\" said Oliver.\n\n\"We don't believe it!\" both said at the same time.\n\n\"It's true, I promise!\" Peter insisted. \"My dad has seen him; and my dad wouldn't lie.\"\n\n\"Maybe he's sick,\" said Patrick.\n\n\"He's like a big cat,\" said Oliver.\n\n\"Do you mean a sick person?\" laughed Peter. \"No; he isn't sick, or very pale. Boys! haven't you ever heard of this? It's pretty common, and easy to understand.\"\n\n\"I don't get it! How do you understand it?\" asked the twins.\n\n\"Very simply!\" exclaimed Peter. \"The other side of his face is black too.\" And he fell over backward on the hay.\n\nIt was an old joke that he had heard his dad tell; but it was new to the twins, who were really fooled by it.\n\n\"Get him out of the wagon!\" shouted Oliver, laughing so hard he could barely breathe, and grabbing Peter as if to do what he said.\n\n\"I'll bounce him out!\" cried Patrick, who was driving; and he started to make the cows go into a slow, heavy trot, which shook up the wagon and everything in it in a way that was more exciting than comfortable.\n\n\"Oh, don't do that!\" cried Peter, his voice shaking with the bumps. \"You'll break the e-g-g-s in my b-a-s-k-e-t!\"\n\n\"I've had one dinner, but I'll need another by the time we get to the beach,\" said Oliver.\n\n\"Me too!\" cried Peter. \"We'll make a big fire on the shore, and have a fun time. And, hey, guys, let's get Adam to come down to the beach with us tonight.\"\n\n\"That will be fun, if he's not too proud to go with country people now,\" replied Patrick.\n\n\"After he's been helping city people, he's as proud as if he'd fallen into a barrel of sticky syrup,\" said Oliver.\n\n\"Adam is all right,\" said Peter. \"He doesn't act different with me.\nWe'll have him with us, for sure!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nOLIVER'S NEW CLOTHES.\n\nThere was only one big house at BE place in those times.\nFirst a farm-house, it was in not the best place, a\nlittle away from the sea, in a dip of the hills. It was run\nby a farmer's widow, Mrs. Madison, who, as her work grew, had\nbuilt more rooms until her house looked like it had a big lump on one side.\n\nWhile his FR town friends were going there in the cart, and\ntalking about him, Oliver, the third hero in our story\n(counting the twins as one), was standing in front of a dresser in Mrs.\nMadison's best corner room, and smiling nicely at his reflection in the\noval-shaped mirror.\n\nHe had a hair-brush in his right hand and a comb in his left, and after\ngiving his smooth hair a neat touch or two, he would tilt the mirror\na little and step back, to get a still more nice view of his\nlooks.\n\nIt was not his own room, there in the new part--the big lump, as it\nwere--of the summer big house. Nor can I say that it was his own brush and comb that he was using so\nmuch, nor his own scent that had made his naturally rough, rusty\nhair so nice and smooth. But the big smiling\nmouth, small nose, and freckles were things nobody would have thought\nof taking from Oliver; and the quite well-fitting, nice,\ngrayish-brown clothes he had on had belonged to him about eight hours.\n\nOliver was not, really, one of Mrs. Madison's guests. He was\nonly a boy-of-all-work hired by her for the season. The room belonged\nto Mr. Henry, who had gone boating that afternoon; and Oliver had taken\ntemporary use to admire himself in his new clothes in front of the\nhandy mirror.\n\nFor new they were to him, even though they had been quite well worn that\nsummer by the friendly young guest, who, on leaving in the morning,\nhad given Oliver a gift of them in return for the jobs Oliver had done\nfor him.\n\nThis was the first chance to try them on that the proud receiver\nhad found. He had never in his life worn anything so stylish, and we can\nsmile kindly at the innocent vanity with which he looked at himself in\nMr. Henry's mirror. His use of Mr. Henry's brush and bottle of smell-good was maybe not okay. And when he excitedly took the shiny gold watch that Mr. Henry had left by the mirror when he changed his clothes to go on a boat ride, it was too much. He took the watch by its chain and put it in the pocket of his new shirt.\n\n[Illustration: Oliver is happy with how he looks.]\n\n\"It only needed a watch to make it perfect,\" he said; \"and here it is!\"\n\nIn his button-hole, he hooked the gold chain, letting the heavy piece hang, and the chain fall nicely on his shirt. Then he looked at the watch and opened it with a push of the button (it had a special cover), and looked at the time. He closed it again with a nice sound, and put it back in his pocket, as he walked around happily in front of the mirror.\n\n\"I'll have a watch like this one day,\" he said to himself, proudly, \"and a gold chain like this, with a big piece like that! You'll see!\"\n\nWith a sigh, he started to put it back in the fancy box where he had found it. But that was too hard to do.\n\n\"I'd like to wear it a few minutes; where's the harm?\" he thought. \"Of course, I won't let anything bad happen to it.\"\n\nHe looked at the time again; it was late afternoon. The few men who were staying with Mrs. Madison (because it was now late in the year) had gone on a boat ride, and the ladies were having snacks. It was a free time for Oliver, and having put on his new clothes, he thought it would be nice to walk on the beach, a sort of practice for his role of \"walking gentleman,\" before going that evening to show himself to the people at the other side of the town. He couldn't resist the wish to carry the watch, on this first trip; buttoning the chain and piece under the top buttons of his coat, so that they wouldn't be seen as he left the house.\n\n\"I only wish _she_ could see me!\" he whispered to himself, as he went down the stairs.\n\n\"She\" was Miss Alice, the youngest of the lady guests, and in his eyes the prettiest. She had been nice to Oliver, like most of the people living with them had been; and he felt warm and happy, thinking about seeing her surprised face.\n\nBut Alice was having a snack with everyone else, and wasn't thinking about him at the moment. So he left the house without anyone noticing, and went to enjoy his walk alone; opening his coat again, and looking at the beautiful chain and seal, as he walked the sandy path to the beach.\n\n\"If I see the boat,\" he said,--for that was the name of the boat,--\"I'll hurry back, and have the watch back where it should be before Mr. Henry arrives.\"\n\nHe really planned to do this. But from the sandy hills, or from the beach itself, which he got to after a short walk from the house, the boat was nowhere to be seen.\n\nThe sea had become calm quickly after the recent storm. It rolled on the beach, with waves made dark and muddy by the sea plants which, torn by the storm and mixed with sand, still moved back and forth in the waves.\n\n\"The wind's blowing from the west,\" noticed Oliver. \"The boat'll have a hard time getting back!\"\n\nThe sky was partly covered by big pieces of broken clouds, and in a hole in the clouds the sun was just setting over dark trees that were behind the sand hills, a little away from the beach. As it went down, the shadows of the woods stretched out, over the sand hills and the smooth, shiny area of beach sand, just washed by the tide going out. Then the sunset light on the white tops of the waves went out, and the whole sea was dark. For just a moment, because now the moving clouds caught a red color which spread quickly over the sky, until the whole sky, almost down to the edge of the sea, looked like one big fire. The sea itself looked strange and wild, the dark and grumpy waters only a little bit reflecting the color of the clouds on their moving waves.\n\nChapter 5.\n\nGetting the boat in the water.\n\n\"Just the right time for a little row,\" thought Oliver, as he walked around, sometimes looking happily at his new clothes and the bright watch chain, and sometimes looking longingly at the sea.\n\nHe knew how exciting it was to go over the waves in a good boat, and rocking on the swells outside.\n\n\"I think I'll try it once,\" he said. \"Maybe I can see the boat around\nthe point.\"\n\nThe point was a big rock by the shore which blocked the ocean view on\nthe north-east, the direction from where the boat was expected. But\nthe small harbor it would have to go into was a deep place in the broken\nshore at the other end of the beach, a little walk away.\n\n\"It can't come in without me seeing it,\" thought Oliver,\nwith a look at the watch, which he took from his pocket and opened and\nshut again with a sort of happy feeling, for the twentieth time.\n\nThere were a couple of small boats above the water line; and he knew\nwhere a pair of old worn-out oars were hidden under a line of\nsmall houses close by. He pulled them out and threw them on the sand.\nThen he looked at the seaweed in his way,--little piles of it\non the beach, and big piles rolling in the waves. The water had\nbeen going out for about three hours.\n\n\"I can get through that easily,\" he said.\n\nHe pulled the lightest of the small boats down to the water's edge, and put\nin the oars. He knew just how it should be pushed into the water, and understood the\nneed of sending it straight across the waves, and of never, by\nany chance, letting them hit it from the side.\n\nPutting himself at the upper end, he waited for a big wave, and pushed\nthe boat into it,--running with it until his feet were almost in the\nwater, then holding it firmly until another wave lifted it. Just as that\nwas going down, he gave the boat another push, jumped in at the same time,\npicked up the oars, and had them in the holders and in the water just as\nthe third wave came.\n\nSo far, so good. He had done the same thing many times before, and had\nnever had an accident. A few strong strokes, and he would\nhave been safe outside the waves. But at an important moment he paused to\nlook at a few drops of water on his new clothes; and right then\none of his oars got caught in a swirling mess of seaweed.\n\nThe boat was going out quickly in one direction; the wave that carried the\nseaweed was rushing in with great force in the other. No one knows the\npower of a wave, who has not felt it at some such moment. What happened\nwas over so quickly that Oliver himself could not have explained it. A\nquick struggle, a terrible pull, a hit in the chest and face from\nthe end of an oar,--and he was lying on his back in the boat with his\nHe fell into the water.\n\nFor a few seconds, he laid there, feeling a bit confused from the fall. He felt like he lost his breath. But he quickly got better and got back to the right position. When he did, he saw the boat moving sideways to the big waves, with one big wave about to hit it.\n\nWithout thinking, he grabbed an oar and pulled hard to turn the boat towards the wave. He did it, and the boat went safely over it and the next big wave, and so out to the open sea.\n\nBut the oar broke. It was an old oar, worn out from being used a lot, and his last pull broke it at the weak spot. The paddle part fell into the water, and only the handle stayed in his hand.\n\nHe then looked for the other oar, and saw that he had lost it when he fell. He could see it floating away on a wave, far behind him. For now, the wind was moving the boat, almost as fast as if it had a sail.\n\nHe tried paddling with the broken oar handle, but it didn't move the boat much, and he started to feel scared. He was already scared from falling and almost tipping over in the waves; but now, he saw a new danger.\n\nAt first, he thought he would jump into the water and swim to the shore; but then he remembered his clothes, which would be ruined if they got wet. And there was also a watch that wasn't his.\n\nThere was another danger, too. The seaweed! He was a good swimmer; but could he swim through waves full of seaweed?\n\nThe night was coming, and clouds were gathering. The wind hit the boat harder than he felt when he was near the trees. There was no one else around, no other boats, only a few faraway sails.\n\n\"Oh, where is the big boat?\" he called out, looking around the rocky point, which was getting harder to see as he moved out to sea.\n\nJust a little while ago, he would have been upset if the big boat had arrived before he had time to get back with the watch; but now, he really wanted it to come and pick him up. Because even worse things could happen than someone finding out about the watch in his\nBut no boat was seen. The bright colors in the sky faded. The sea became dark; the wind got stronger. He yelled for help, but didn't think anyone would hear him.\n\nThere were only women at the home, and even if they heard his voice, it would sound so far away they might not pay attention. But he could see the top windows over the sand hills. Maybe someone, maybe Alice herself, was looking out from them.\n\nHoping for that, he waved his hat with big signs of trouble, still yelling for help, as he floated away on the dark waters.\n\n(_To be continued._)\n\nGeorge William.\n\n[_A story from history._]\n\nBY Henry.\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nUNDER THE BIG TREE.\n\nIt was a day in the middle of the year that George William was chosen leader of the army. The next day he told Congress that he accepted the job, but that he would not take any money; he would keep track of his expenses, but he would do his job for his country. There was no time to waste. He could not go home to say goodbye to his wife, and he didn't know when he would see her again, so he wrote her a letter:\n\n    \"PH city, a few days later in the year.\n\n    \"MY DEAREST:\n\n    \"I am now writing to you about something that makes me very worried, and this worry is even bigger when I think about how it will make you feel. Congress has decided that the whole army raised for the defence of our cause shall be under my care, and that I need to go to BO city right away to take over the command of it.\n\n    \"Believe me, my dear Penelope, when I tell you very seriously, that I did not want this job, I tried everything I could to avoid it, not just because I don't want to leave you and the family, but because I know it's a big responsibility, and that I would be happier spending a month with you at home than I could ever be away, even if I were to be gone for a long, long time. But because of a sort of luck, I found myself doing this work. I hope that my doing it will do some good. You could, and probably did, understand from my letters that I was worried I couldn't avoid this job. I didn't say when I would come back. That was true. I couldn't say no to this job, without people saying bad things about me. That would have made me feel bad and upset my friends.\"\n\nWhat he is saying is that he couldn't say no to the job without people thinking he was scared or lazy. He was neither. He was brave, as he always showed, and he was not selfish, because he was leaving his home and things to do a very hard job. For what? His home? Yes. But we must remember that VI country was more important to him than all the other places. Right now, only MA city was in danger. Of course, everyone is pushed to do big things for more than one reason. William was a soldier, and he felt excited thinking about being the big boss and doing the most a soldier can do. But he was, most of all, a man who knew what was right and wrong. He saw that EN country was wrong and was being unfair to AM country. The unfairness did not touch him as a farmer, as a man making money. It touched him as a free man who followed the rules. He was ready to give up everything to help fix the wrongs.\n\nWilliam left PH city on his way to BO city, in the middle of the year, with a group of horsemen, and with Samuel and Liam, who had just become big generals. They had gone about twenty miles when they saw a man on a horse coming fast down the road. It was a man bringing news to the big group of the battle of BU hill. Everyone was excited by the news and wanted to know more.\n\n\"Why did the people have to go back?\" he was asked.\n\n\"It was because they didn't have enough bullets,\" he replied.\n\n\"Did they stand the fire of the regular soldiers?\" asked William worriedly.\n\n\"They did, and they kept their own fire until the enemy was\n\"It's safe!\" exclaimed William. He remembered well the scenes from the past, and he knew how it must have felt for the farmers when a group of uniformed soldiers came marching up from the boats at CH place. If they could be brave, there could be soldiers in them.\n\n[Illustration: \"'DID THEY STAND THE FIRE OF THE REGULAR TROOPS?' ASKED\nWILLIAM ANXIOUSLY.\"]\n\nAll along the way, the people in the towns came to see William's group, and at NE city a group of people from the NY place met to guide him to the city. There he left General Gabriel in command, and hurried forward to CA place, for the news of BH hill made him very worried to reach the army.\n\nIn NE land, the closer he got to the war, the more worried and serious he found the people. At every town he was met by the people and guided through that place to the next. This was done at NH city. The college students all came out, and they had a small band of music, at the lead of which, interestingly enough, was a freshman who later became famous. It was Nathan, the man who made a spelling book and a dictionary. At SP city, the group was met by a group of people from the MA place, and at last, on a summer day, he came to WA town, where he was welcomed by the group of people there, who were having a meeting.\n\nIt was in the afternoon of the same day that William rode into CA city, guided by a group of people. As he got close to CA park, big guns were fired to welcome him, and the people in BO city must have wondered what had happened. The group of people had set aside for his use the house of the president of a big school, keeping only one room for the president; but this house, which is still standing, was probably too small and not very nice; for soon after William was set up in the big square house, on the way to WA town, which had been left by a rich bad guy, and there he stayed as long as he was in CA city. By good luck, years later, the poet Liam bought the house, and so the two names of William and Liam have made it famous.\n\nOn the morning of the next day, which was a Monday, William, with Liam and other officers, rode into camp. CA park was not the small place it is now, surrounded by streets. It stretched\nOut to the open, there was a road that led to WA town. Across from the big field, there was a church, and a little further, where the road turned, stood an old house. In front of this house, where the road turned, was a big tree. It was a hot summer morning, and the people were happy for the tree's shade.\n\nOn the left, and behind, were the tents of our camp. The soldiers stood in the road and on the dry, tree-less field. Many people were there, men, women, and kids, because they heard that the boss had come, and the crowd and the soldiers were all mixed up. What did they see? They saw a group of men on horses, in soldier clothes; but the first man, who everyone was looking at, was a tall, impressive man, standing on his horse; those closest could see that he had a pink face, thick brown hair that was pushed back from his face, and clear blue eyes set a little far apart. Next to him was a man who looked even taller, he was so skinny; he had a big nose, eyes that were looking everywhere, a mouth that looked almost ready to laugh at the people in front of him. He sat easily and without care on his horse. This was Boss Liam.\n\nNow, the strong Victor, easily noticed by his posture and his special clothes,--for he wore a blue coat with yellow pieces, yellow pants, a shoulder badge on each shoulder, and a flower in his hat,--turned to Boss William, who had been the boss of the army before, and put his hand on the handle of his sword, took it out, and raised it where the people could see it. The big gun made noise, no doubt, and the people shouted. It was a big day for them, and everyone was excited to see the VIs. All this we can guess, because there is no story of the exact event. We only know that, at that time, William became the boss of the army.\n\nBut what did William see, and what did he think, now, and later, when he went around looking at the camp and the far points? He saw a mixed group, in all kinds of clothes and with no special clothes at all, with all kinds of tools and with very little fire dust. There was so little, that William was very worried that the BR country would find out how little he had; and so while he was asking Congress to provide supplies, he had barrels of sand, with fire dust on the top, placed in.\nThe soldiers were in different places. Some were in tents, some were in big buildings, and some made their own small houses. The most tidy group was from a place called RI, led by Nathan.\n\nThe men were in groups of different sizes, with leaders who didn't have much power over the others, because these guys usually chose their own leaders. A person visiting the camp told a story about a talk he heard between a leader and one of his guys.\n\n\"Benjamin,\" said the leader, \"go and bring a bucket of water for the guys.\"\n\n\"I won't,\" said Benjamin. \"It's your turn now, leader; I got it last time.\"\n\nBut the guys, even though they didn't listen much, were good to become soldiers. Most of them were very serious, and they were really good with the normal gun. A story is told about a group of gun men from a far place in PA. So many men wanted to join that the leader who was picking the group had to do something. He drew a picture of a nose on a board, put the board far away, and said he would only take those who could hit it. Over sixty guys did it. \"General Gabriel, watch out for your nose,\" says the paper that tells the story. General Gabriel, as we know, was the leader of the other side's soldiers in BO city.\n\nWilliam wrote to the big group, \"I am happy to see that there are the right people for a good army, a lot of strong men, active, excited about the cause, and really brave.\"\n\nHis first job was to make an army out of these people, and he smartly said that, since they really needed clothes, it would be a good idea to get ten thousand big shirts right away. These would not only be the cheapest clothes, but they would make a good uniform, which would make the soldiers from different places or towns look the same. If the men looked the same, they would work together better.\n\nThere is a story that William had a big seat built in a big tree where he started leading the army, and that there he sat with his glass, watching what was happening across the water in BO city. Whether this is true or not, he was always looking around the area himself, and sending his guys to check out the other side's place. The hardest time came at the end of the year 1775, when the old soldiers' time was up, and the groups were filling up with new\nUnder a big tree in CA city, General William took command of the soldiers.\n\n[Illustration: UNDER THE BIG TREE AT CA CITY.--GENERAL WILLIAM TAKING COMMAND OF THE SOLDIERS.]\n\n\"It might not be in the story books,\" writes William to the leader of Congress, in the early days of the year, \"to find a story like ours. To keep a place close to the bad guys for six months without----, and at the same time to let go of one group of soldiers and find new ones, within a short distance of many bad guy groups, is more, probably, than ever was tried. But if we do as well in the last as we have done in the first, I will think it the luckiest thing in my whole life.\"\n\nThe blank space left in this letter, in case it was found by the bad guys, was easily filled by Congress with the word \"powder.\" At one time there was not enough for half a pound per man. General Sullivan writes that when General William heard of this, he was so surprised by the danger that he did not say a word for half an hour.\n\nWhen William left PH city for CA city, he wrote to his wife as if he expected to come back after a short battle. Maybe he said this to make her feel better. Maybe he really hoped that with a short, strong fight the colonies would show Great Britain that they were serious, and would get back the rights that had been taken from them. Anyway, from the day he took command of the soldiers in CA city, William had one goal in view, to attack BO city as soon as possible. The summer was not over before he talked to his officers and proposed to make the attack. They were not sure, and finally said they were not ready for such a brave move. He talked to them again in the middle of October, but still he could not convince them. He kept on suggesting it, however, as the one thing to do, and Congress at last, just at the end of the year, said that William could attack the bad guy forces \"in any way he thought was best, even if the town and things in it might be broken.\"\n\nAs soon as he got this power, William talked to his officers again, and strongly suggested that they needed to do something right away. He thought they should bravely try to beat the English soldiers in BO city. In the spring more soldiers would come from England. \"Strike now!\" he said, \"and maybe it will not be necessary to strike again.\" But it was not till the middle of February that he was able to convince his generals to agree to a move. As soon as\nAfter he had made friends with them, he got ready quickly, and in the early days of a month, he took over the high ground of DO place. This move showed the BR country soldiers what was going to happen. If they stayed in BO city, they would be attacked. They went to their boats and left BO harbor.\n\nWilliam had made them leave, even though he hadn't fought a battle. We can't say what would have happened if he could have attacked BO city earlier. There were many friends of AM city in the big meeting, and if they had heard that the New England men had actually destroyed BO city, where their stuff was, to get rid of the BR country soldiers, I think these friends would have said: \"Look how serious these MA men are! They deserve to be heard, when they are willing to give up their own city to keep their rights.\" BO city was not destroyed, and the war continued; but one result of this time in BO city was to make people trust William. He showed that he was a natural leader. He didn't stay behind, but went right to the front, and asked the other leaders to come and stand where he stood. He was brave; he was ready to fight the enemy. He was fighting for a good cause, and he wanted to finish it quickly. There were going to be seven long years of war, and William was going to show in other ways that he was the leader; but it was great that at the start of the fight he was the best of the men around him, and that when he took out his sword he wasn't just talking big, but was ready to use it.\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nLEADING THE ARMY.\n\nIn the middle of a month in 1776, William was in NE city, which looked like it was going to be the main place for the war. Here he stayed for four or five months, making one trip to PH city, because the big meeting wanted to talk with him. He was busy making the army bigger and stronger and building forts.\n\nThat spring and summer, people's thoughts about the war with EN country changed quickly. William didn't think it was possible to get what the colonies wanted and still be part of EN country. He was ready for independence, and when the big meeting made its declaration, William had it read to the army and was very happy.\n\nNot long after the declaration of independence, an EN fleet came to NE Bay, bringing a lot of soldiers, led by Lord Henry, who, with his brother Admiral Henry, had been chosen to talk with the Americans. In truth, they only brought a promise of saying sorry to the ones who didn't obey. Washington knew very well that the BR government did not want to listen to the problems of the colonies and make them right; they wanted to confuse the colonies and make a group there that would go against the actions of the big meeting. There was a small thing that happened when the helpers arrived that showed what people felt.\n\nOne afternoon, they said a boat was coming to the main place, bringing a messenger from Lord Henry with a letter. Washington saw that the BR people, when talking about him or other AM country leaders, did not think of them as leaders of the army; they were just normal men who had fought against the King. Now Washington knew it was not a big thing whether people called him General Washington or Mr. Washington, but it was a big thing how Lord Henry called him. That leader had nothing to do with George Washington, but he might have important things to do with General Washington. So, he called some of the AM country leaders who were at the main place to talk about the subject, and they agreed with him. Colonel Ryan was told to meet the messenger and handle the thing.\n\nSo, he got in a boat and rowed towards SI place, where Lord Henry's messenger was coming from. The two boats met in the middle, and Lieutenant Benjamin--that was the messenger's name--was very nice, and told Colonel Ryan that he had a letter from General Howe to Mr. Washington. Colonel Ryan looked surprised. He himself was a leader in the continental army, and he didn't know such a person. Then Lieutenant Benjamin showed him the letter, which was called, George Washington, Esq. Colonel Ryan was nice, but it was not possible for him to carry a letter to the leader of the AM country army addressed that way. The lieutenant felt awkward; as a gentleman and a leader he knew he was wrong. He tried to make things better by saying that it was an important letter, but was meant more for a person who was important in AM country meetings than for one who was leading an army.\n\nColonel Ryan kept saying no to the letter, and the boats went away. Soon, though, Lieutenant Benjamin came rowing back and asked how Washington wanted to be called. It was not a needed question, Ryan thought. There was no doubt what General Washington's rank was. The lieutenant knew it and was really sorry, but he wished Colonel Ryan would take the letter.Mr. Ryan would take the letter. Mr. Ryan said that it was the easiest thing in the world; the letter just needed to be correctly addressed. And so they said goodbye.\n\nFive days later, a helper of General Henry came with a flag and asked for a meeting with Mr. Patrick, the BR country helper. They agreed, and the next day William, with all his helpers around him, met Mr. Patrick, who was very polite, and called him \"Your Excellency,\" which was okay, though it was avoiding the real issue a bit. He tried to explain the letter and said that they didn't mean to be rude, and he then gave another letter, addressed to William, Esq., etc., etc.\n\nClearly, Lord Henry thought he had found a great way out of the problem. _Et cetera, et cetera!_ That could cover everything,--Head of the Army, Top Rebel, or anything else this very careful man from VA place might think of as his title. It would help William's pride and make Lord Henry feel better. William answered calmly, Yes, the _et cetera_ could mean everything, but it could also mean anything or nothing. It didn't mean anything. He was not just a regular person; this letter was for a public person, and as such he could not take it, unless it recognized him properly. So Mr. Patrick had to keep the letter and try to hide his embarrassment and to tell what the letter said out loud.\n\nMaybe all this sounds like a small thing. In reality it was a big thing. Were William and other helpers rebels against the King, or were they the helpers of a government which said it was independent of the King? Lord Henry stopped trying to trick William, and wrote to his government that in the future they would need to give the AM country leader his title; and the group, to whom William told about this, agreed with what he did and decided that no letter or message should be accepted from the enemy, by the Head or by other leaders of the AM country army, but such as should be directed to them in the roles they played. Small things like this helped the people stand tall and look at the world with confidence.\n\nThe Americans needed all the help and comfort they could get, because it was clear that they were at a disadvantage, with their half-ready soldiers some in LO island and some in NE city, between the North and East rivers, surrounded by people who were against them, who were encouraged by the presence of a large BR country group in the bay. William used\nHe tried his best to bring a strong feeling of love for their land in the camp. This would stop small fights, and he felt their cause was very important. He didn't want the army to act or think in a way that wasn't serving good. He gave an order:\n\n    \"So the troops can go to church,\n    and rest after working hard, they won't have to work on Sundays,\n    unless at the ship-yards, or special times, until\n    I say otherwise. I don't like to hear that bad words,\n    a bad habit not known in our army, is becoming common;\n    I hope the officers will try to stop it, and that everyone will think, that we can\n    not hope for help from Heaven, if we insult it by our bad words and silliness; plus, it is a bad thing so small and\n    bad, without any reason, that every smart and good man\n    hates and looks down on it.\"\n\n[Picture: THE RETREAT FROM LONG ISLAND.--WILLIAM DIRECTING THE\nPASSAGE OF THE AMERICAN ARMY ACROSS THE EAST RIVER, AT NIGHT.]\n\nThe time was coming when the army would be tested, and\nWilliam was to show his skill in other and more clear ways.\nThe battle of LO Island was fought in the late 18th century, and was a hard\nblow to the AM country army. William's first job was to bring\nthe forces that were still on LO Island to the main land, and bring\nthe two parts of his army together. He had nine thousand men and their bags and\nweapons to bring across a fast river, while a winning enemy was so close\nthat their movements could be heard. Now his skill and energy\nwere seen. He sent word for all the boats of any size that\nwere along the NE city shore up the Hudson and on the East River to be\nbrought to the BR side. He gave orders for the troops to be\nready to attack the enemy at night, and he made the\ntroops that defended the outer wall to look like they were ready to move at once upon the enemy. All\nthis time it was raining and uncomfortable, for the soldiers were\nwithout tents or shelter of any kind, except for such simple barriers as\nThey could make a loud noise. They kept firing quickly at the guards, and the men in front were ready, waiting for orders to move forward.\n\nThen they heard quiet noises from far away near the water. Suddenly, in the middle of the night, a big gun made a big boom. No one knew what it was, and to this day, no one knows why it happened. But the soldiers figured out what was happening. They were told to go back, not forward. They were told to move forward to hide the real plan. William was by the water, helping the soldiers get onto boats. Some had gone across; when the water changed direction, the wind and water were against them; there were not enough boats for the rest. To make things worse, one of the leaders made a mistake, and the men who were in front to hide the movement from the other side were told to go to the Ferry. For a while, it looked like the other side would find out about the plan, but they didn't, and when morning came all the soldiers had moved to NE city, and no one in the other army knew what had happened. It was a great thing, and William, who had not slept for two days and had hardly gotten off his horse, showed he was a great leader.\n\nHe now had to show the same kind of skill for the rest of the fall. It takes one kind of skill to lead men into a battle and another to lead them away from the enemy. With a lot of ships in the harbor, it was clear that the other side could at any time destroy NE city and any army that was there. So, William moved his army up the island. The other side followed. They could move troops on both sides of the island, by water, and could stop the soldiers from crossing the big river into NJ place. They started to land troops on the shore of East River not far from where a ferry is now. Some walls had been built there and were held by soldiers who had been in the battle of LO island. They seem to have been scared by that loss, for they ran as soon as they saw the other side moving forward, and other soldiers who had been sent to help them also ran away in fear.\n\nWilliam heard the shots in this direction and rode over to the place. He saw the soldiers running away and told them to stop. But they were too scared and had lost control. They didn't listen to him, and William, usually calm and in control, was so\nAngry at their scared behavior, Adam got really mad, threw his hat down and said, \"Are these the people I have to protect AM country with!\" He took out his small gun and sword and tried to make the running-away people go back to their job. He was not scared at all, and he was close to the BR country, riding around quickly, when one of his helpers saw how dangerous it was, grabbed the horse's bridle and made Adam calm down.\n\nTo protect his group, Adam put his soldiers across the top part of the island, from Fort WA on the big river to the little river, and here he stopped the BR country while his men got their strength back and were ready to move more. Meanwhile, across the big river from Fort WA, another fort, named after General Gabriel, had been built, and Adam had put General Grace there. It was clear that with the BR country having a big group of soldiers and boats, it would be impossible to keep NE city or the big river, and it was also clear that if Adam's group was beaten there, the BR country would go to PH city, where the big meeting was. With NE city controlling the big river and with PH city in their hands, the BR country would control the most important parts of AM country.\n\nAdam also saw that there was a lot of work ahead and that it would be impossible to fight with a group of soldiers who were only there for a year, and he tried to make the big meeting get men for a longer time. He had to organize this new group and to look after many things. His old ways of doing things in order and correctly helped him then, and he worked all the time, getting things in order, because he knew that the BR country would move soon. In fact, it's strange that the BR country, with all their advantage, did not quickly move after the battle of the Long Island and beat the AM country group in a quick series of attacks on land and water. It's quite sure that Adam, if he were them, would not have waited.\n\nAt the end of a month, Adam was at a place called WH Plains, in the rocky, hilly country north of NE city. Step by step he had moved back before General Henry, who had been trying to get the AM country group where he could surround it and destroy it. Adam, on the other hand, could not take any risks. He wanted to delay the BR country as long as possible, and not fight them until he had his new group well organized. There was a battle at WH Plains, and the Americans had to move back;\nBut William quickly moved to a safer place and started to dig holes. He was too weak to fight in the open, but he could use his shovel to cause problems for Henry. He was expecting another attack, but soon he saw that the bad guys were leaving.\n\nHe was not sure what Henry might do, but he knew that Henry would go to PH city. He kept an eye on Fort William and ordered that it should be kept safe until it was too dangerous. If it was too dangerous, the soldiers should go to Fort Liam. He and most of the soldiers went to King's Ferry. The soldiers from NE and NE city he put on both sides of the river to protect the important paths in the hills. Because it was very important to have a clear path between PH city and NE. Some soldiers were also left with General Liam at WH place, who was ready to join William if needed.\n\n[Illustration][Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration: CROSSING THE RIVER.--THE WALK TO TR city.--WILLIAM\nDIRECTING THE BIG GUNS AT TR city. (SEE NEXT PAGE.)]\n\nGeneral Gabriel, who was in charge at Fort Liam, on the NJ side of\nthe river, hoped to keep Fort William, on the NE city side, which\nwas also under his control. He hoped to keep it even after the BR country\nhad started to attack it. William had to let Gabriel decide, because he was busy moving his soldiers\nacross the river, higher up. If the fort could have held out, they\nmight have been able to stop the BR country from going to NJ.\nBut Gabriel thought the men in the fort would fight harder,\nand when William finally got to Fort Liam he saw from the\nriver bank the surrender of Fort William with its supplies and two thousand men. It was a big loss; and, moreover, the\ncapture of that fort made it impossible to keep Fort Liam, which was quickly left.\n\nNow a great retreat began. The English under Lord Cameron, with a\nwell-prepared army, and happy with their recent win, came over to NJ and started moving forward. They were so fast that the Americans\nleft their pots on the fire in Fort Liam as they quickly left.\nWilliam, with a small, ragged, sad army moved away from the\nenemy, sometimes leaving a town just as the BR country arrived at\nOne person was trying to slow down the others by breaking bridges and ruining supplies. This made the others move very slowly. They only moved a little bit in many days.\n\nAt the same time, the leader of the BR country was asking the people of NJ state to come back and promising them they would be forgiven. Many people agreed and asked for protection. It seemed like the fight was almost over and all the hard work had been for nothing. The AM country soldiers had only signed up for a short time and by the end of December, most of them would be done. General Liam was taking a long time and General William was stressed and almost ready to give up. But he was not going to give up easily. One day, when things were really bad, he talked to Mr. Ryan, who was with him, and made a gesture across his neck, saying: \"Ryan, my neck does not feel like it is made for a noose. We must go to AU county in VI state, and if we are beaten, we must go over the big mountains.\"\n\nBut William was made for more than just being a leader. He had put the DE river between his soldiers and the BR country, who were now all over NJ state, getting ready for winter, and planning to cross the river when it was frozen and go to PH city. Suddenly, on a holiday night, William went back across the river with his little group of soldiers, making a dangerous trip through big pieces of ice that were bumping against the boats, surprised a big group of soldiers near TR city, and caught a thousand of them. Eight days later he fought a battle at PR city. Within three weeks he had completely changed the situation. He had made the enemy leave every place they were in NJ state, except BR city and AM city, made PH city safe, and showed the people that the army, which was thought to be almost destroyed, could be used by a great leader like a stick to punish the enemy.\n\nPeople were starting to realize that William was a true leader.\n\nThe day after the victory at TR city, the leaders, \"having thought a lot about the current crisis, and having complete trust in the wisdom, strength, and honesty of General William,\" decided that \"General William should be, and he is hereby, given all the powers to gather armies, choose officers, and have control over the parts of the country where the army is.\" William had been constantly stopped by having to ask all questions to the leaders and to his generals. Now he was going to have all the power, because he had shown he was a man who could be trusted with power.\n\nTHE BUTTERFLY AND THE BEE.\n\nBY EMMA.\n\n\n        \"If it's a sunny day,\"\n    Said the butterfly, happy and free,--\n        \"If it's a sunny day,\n    I'll go dance in the grass there!\"\n    \"And I,\" said the smart bee,\n  \"Will start working early, you will see,--\n        If it's a sunny day!\"\n\n\n\n\nFISH AND THEIR BABIES.\n\nBY CAMERON.\n\n\n[Pictures: \"Mom and babies.\" (SEE PAGE 602.)]\n\nA long time ago, a man who liked to study animals was sitting by a\nlittle stream that flowed slowly into the sea on the coast of a place called BG country, when he saw some strange holes that were\njust above the water. He was about to check\nthese crab-holes, as he thought they were, when he was surprised by\nseeing a fish, known to the people there as the \"hussar,\" which had been\nmoving fast up and down and seemingly having a fun time, suddenly\ngo into shallow water, and start to fight for the shore. At first the\nman thought that it was being chased by some bigger fish and that its\naction was because it was scared; but the fish, staying upright,\nkept moving slowly up the beach by using its fins as feet,\nand in a few moments it disappeared within one of the thought\ncrab-holes.\n\nWondering then whether the fish were hunting crabs, or looking for its nest,\nthe man watching soon found the answer as he saw, farther down the shore,\nseveral other \"hussars\" going into their nests. Jumping down, he caught a\nfew of the fishes in their homes.\n\nThe fishes had dug the holes in the bank just above the surface of\nthe water, and in them had made normal nests of grass or leaves, in\nwhich the eggs were placed. The babies, when hatched, at once\nfell out into the water and were then watched over by the parents.\n\n[Pictures: THE NEST-BUILDING FISH OF THE SEA OF GA TAKING ITS\nBABIES INTO ITS MOUTH FOR PROTECTION.]\n\nSuch a way of raising their babies is certainly special. In making\ntheir nests, fishes sometimes remind us of the birds, and some of them\nindeed may be said to be as good as their bird friends in their\nnest-building skill. This special \"hussar\" fish may be compared with\nthe cliff-swallow that digs its way into the cliffs, and builds its\nThere is a bird that makes its nest a few feet from the entrance, or like a bird from the south, that makes its nest in a really special way.\n\nThe fish with a long name, one kind is found in a big lake, is a strange creature. When it's time to have babies, it looks for a good place to build--usually in shallow water. It might find an old sunken root or a rock sticking out. The mom and dad fish bring bits of grass, leaves, growing sea-weed, and other things to that spot. They start to make these into an oval shape. The pieces of grass are wound in and out, mixed up with each other in different ways, and the gaps are filled with mud. While they're building, one or more holes are left leading into the nest or all the way through it; the grasses are wound around the old root, and finally, a solid oval nest is seen hanging and swinging in the water--a true cradle for the baby fishes.\n\nThe eggs are put inside, and stick themselves to the grass and the sides of the nest. After some time, lots of tiny fishes fill this funny home, and they really want to swim away. But, the mom and dad fish watch them and keep them safe, which bring them back when they swim too far from home.\n\nThis nest-building fish from the big lake shows an even more interesting way of keeping safe--when there is danger, the babies are often taken into the big mouth of the dad fish, and kept safe that way. This habit is common to quite a few fishes. A really big cat-fish, that sometimes is thirteen feet long and weighs over two hundred pounds, has been seen surrounded by a group of young, which rush into its open mouth for safety when they get scared; and one of the biggest of the South AM country fishes, keeps its young safe in the same way.\n\nA strange South AM country fish, called the \"aspredo\", has an even more wonderful method. The mom doesn't carry its eggs in its mouth, but sticks them to its body and fins, with stems or stalks; so that each egg has a sort of cradle to itself. As the fish swims fast, these swing back and forth, looking like a number of barbels or bells.\n\nA cat-fish at PA city has another way of carrying its young. This is about a bag-like thing, like a kangaroo has. But the best caring from a dad--because it's the dad that has the bag--is seen in sea-horses and pipe-fishes. They have a perfect bag where baby fishes go when they are born and stay until they can live on their own. Seeing a sea-horse with its babies is very interesting. The parent wraps its tail around some pieces of weed, and makes the babies go out into the world, and soon you can see lots of baby sea-horses moving straight up in the water by moving their back fins in a funny way, looking like a small cloud in the water. The little ones are so weak that many of them--sometimes all of them--are eaten by other fishes. But they look like plants to stay safe. The pipe-fishes look a lot like the grass where they live, and the sea-horses often have funny things on them that look like the weeds they hide under.\n\nThere are also ocean fishes that really like their babies, like the strange lump-fish or \"hen and chickens,\" that you see a lot on the coast of ME place. The name \"lump-fish\" tells what this fish looks like better than a lot of words could, because the fish's body is covered with funny lumps that make it look strange. The lump-fish is common on the EN coast too, and when it's time to have a family, it makes a rough nest from the sea-weed to keep the eggs safe. The parents watch over them, and their ugly looks probably scare away anyone who comes too close, even though the lump-fishes can't really hurt anyone, and they move too slowly to catch other fishes. When the babies are born, they follow one of the parent-fishes, in a group, sticking close to its head, now moving away fast, coming back fast and hiding under it, like little chickens hide under their mom; that's why the English fishermen call them \"hen and chickens\".\n\nEven though the lump-fishes aren't good at swimming and would probably get thrown onto the shore if they were in the waves, nature has given them\nFish have ways to keep safe. They have fins that can stick to a rock like a suction cup. So, when the water gets rough, the fish can just stick to a rock and wait for the danger to pass, just like a boat that's anchored to a shore.\n\nA CONFUSED DAD.\n\nBY M. L. B.

On one of these islands is Camp CA, so named\nfrom the big hill of that name,--the highest spot to be seen in the\ngroup of hills around the lake.\n\nSome five years ago it was decided to start on this island a summer\ncamp for kids, the term to start in June, and to end about the tenth of\nSeptember. The first summer the camp started with some half-dozen kids.\nLast season, twenty-five strong little guys jumped in and out of the\nlake, like water fairies, perfectly brave, paddling boats which had\nbeen made by themselves, swimming equally well in clothes or without, and\ngrowing strong and healthy in the fresh, clean mountain air.\n\nFive men, making up \"the teachers\" in this summer camp, take care of the\nkids, and \"freedom with rules\" might almost be the camp motto, so\ncarefree, happy, and free are the kids, yet so good is the\ndiscipline. One of the first rules of the camp is, that in\nevery way the teachers shall live the same lives as the kids themselves,\nsharing their work as well as their fun; the spirit between the two is therefore less of teacher and student than that\nof good friends, who are at the same time helpful friends.\n\nLife at Camp CA is a busy one. There are no \"book lessons,\" for sure; but a good many things are taught that are not always to be found\nin books. To start with, fresh mountain air and active life\noutside give a big appetite, and it is not a small job to give food for\ntwenty or thirty hungry mouths. Then, the metal dishes and plates used for cooking and eating need to be cleaned and kept tidy, so \"washing dishes\" becomes a must. The beach-kitchen is a fun place at these times. In the builder's place, there are different kinds of work to be done; there, boats are built, but no boy can use a boat until he is very good at swimming and can take care of himself in the water. This rule is one of the strictest in the camp. The \"Golden Paper\" is the camp's own paper. It is made and run completely by the boys. In the paper, there's a note saying that the \"Good Will Group\" washes clothes, cleans and tidies beaches, builds docks, stone walls, steps, etc., moves dirt and makes papers.\" From this note, it seems like there's no chance for laziness at Camp CH camp. The boys are divided into four groups, and these groups take turns doing the different kinds of work: one day, the cooking; the next, washing dishes; the third, cleaning duty, which includes tidying beaches, and all work given to no other group. The fourth day is a \"no work day.\" This changes the work done every day, and also gives each boy a chance to learn all the tasks. One of the teachers works with each group of boys.\n\nThe boys sleep in wooden houses, which have roofs, but are very airy, and the boys seem comfy enough lying curled up in army blankets or on mattresses on the floor. They can, if they want, swim in the lake before breakfast, and no one who hasn't done it can know how fresh, strong, and \"wake-up\" feeling that morning swim gives! How it clears the head and makes the body feel strong, ready to do things! The normal morning swim doesn't happen until later, around eleven o'clock, after the camp work is done. All week, the boys can wear shoes and socks, or they can go barefoot, just as they like, and the camp clothes are a gray shirt and short pants.\n\nOn Sundays, however, they all wear, in addition, red socks, and red hats, while their gray shirts are tied with red cords. They look very nice, as they start in the \"church boat\" at three o'clock, to meet, at CO's beach, half a mile away, any visitors from the\nNearby hotel or farm-house folks who want to join the Sunday services. These happen in a pretty place called the \"little church,\" on the far side of the island. Simple seats are arranged around an open space. In the middle of it, on top of a rock that looks like a natural table, there's a big cross made of white wood. The boys dress this table with leaves and flowers before the service starts. After everyone gathers, you can hear young voices singing a song from far away. The boys come closer and closer along a path through the woods, with the sunlight playing hide and seek among the branches. Then they take their spots at the singing place, while Mr. Ethan takes his spot on the other side of the flower-covered rock, and reads from the service book.\n\nThe money collected at these services goes to different helpful causes the camp supports. Some sick boys or girls in different hospitals pass the time by reading SN, a book the happy, healthy boys at the camp send to make them feel better. Sunday afternoon is for writing letters to family, and in the evening, at prayers, Mr. Ethan has a quiet talk with the boys in the little church.\n\nThe summer games happen in August, and include fun swimming and diving, canoe and boat racing, ball game and tennis. Last year, the parents and friends of the boys, about a hundred people, were invited to the camp, and ate there after the games, which lasted two days. A few weeks later, the boys acted out some little plays. These were very smart shows, and they did a great job performing. The tickets were priced at fifteen cents, but the visitors gave more than that, since the goal of the show was to collect more money for a free bed in a children's hospital, as soon as enough money could be collected. A big fire was burning brightly on the shore, and lots of red-hatted boys running around in its warm light, looked beautiful against the big white moon as it slowly rose above the mountains and cast a wide band of silver light across the lake. From boat to boat, happy \"good-nights\" echoed over the water as the guests who had enjoyed the night's fun were rowed to shore.\nThe woods at CA place.]\n\nThese good deeds at CA place mean, in the simplest way, \"helping others with what one has,\" because the money given by the boys is their own, earned by them to use as they want. Once at the place, every boy gets the same amount of money every week, no matter how much their parents have. This money is a little, and if they want more money, either for sweets, or fizzy drinks, or to give to the good deeds, or to buy things for a new boat, or to buy a boat that is already made,--for any extra nice thing in fact,--the boy with such wants has to earn the money needed, and work which is paid for at the normal rate will always be given to him so he can earn it. They can be paid for making paths flat, or building walls, or anything else which is needed at the place, and the money earned by such work is put in the CA Bank by the boy earning it. Against this amount in the bank, he draws his check in a serious way, which check is duly given and cashed. If at the end of the time any extra money remains to his credit, he has full right to use it as he may choose, but no money from home is given to a boy more than the original sum agreed as his weekly allowance. Just as men work and make money, and learn how to use that money in the big world, so do these boys work, and make money and use it in this small world at CA place. By the time they are ready to go into a bigger part of life, they know and appreciate the worth of money honestly earned, and understand the true way of spending it.\n\nSo that the boys don't truly become little water spirits, they go, toward the end of the time, for a week's walk over the hills. A big covered wagon, pulled by oxen, carries blankets and food, and any boys who get tired can have a ride when they feel like it. They sleep outside at night and have many fun adventures during the day; and at the different farms to which they come in their travels, fresh milk is happily given to the happy, brown-faced, red-capped boys, who make the hills echo happily with their songs and laughter. Each year the smallest boy of the whole group is called the place \"baby,\" and is given several extra nice things, not the least of which is the right of tasting the ice-cream whenever it is made, without having been obliged to help in making it.\n\nIf I were a boy, life at CA camp would be my dream of fun. It has lots of fun, open-air life, and learning useful things for myself and helping others.\n\nA BOYS' CAMP.\n\nBY A CAMPER.\n\n\n  \"Under the green tree,\n  Who loves to be with me,\n  And sing his happy song\n  To the sweet bird's song;\n  Who does not want more,\n  And loves to live in the sun,\n  Finding the food he eats,\n  And happy with what he gets,--\n  Come here, come here, come here,\n  Here he will see\n  No bad guy.\"--\n\nThese lines from a famous drama came to my mind again and again\nas Papa finished reading a paper which a friend gave him.\n\n\"HA camp,\" so the paper said, \"is on the side of one\nof NE state's prettiest lakes, in the middle from\nWI city, and RI city. The idea of the camp is to give\nboys a good and healthy outdoor life during the summer months,\nwhere, with good care, they can learn to swim, row,\nfish, do some walking and mountain-climbing, and play other manly\ngames; learn and keep good habits, and make their bodies\nstrong. The cabins are of wood, with a roof, floor, big, and\nweatherproof. Each boy has a bed. The best of healthy food is\ngiven.\"\n\n\"I know one of the two young men who started HA camp,\" said\nPapa, as he finished the reading of the paper. \"They are students at\nCA school. I have asked some questions, and I\nwould be happy to have you spend the summer in the woods with them. I\nguess the other boys will be much younger than you, but you would,\nlikely, find many of them as good friends; and life in the open air, for\na couple of months, would, I think, be good and helpful to you.\"\n\nIt took me a long time to fall asleep that night. I had always wanted to camp out, and this was a great chance.\n\nThen there were busy days. The paper said: \"Boys should\nbring, besides the clothes they travel in, two gray shirts,\ntwo pairs old pants, shorts (one pair corduroy), long\nrubber coat, swimming shorts, two pairs heavy blankets (dark), strong\nshoes (one or two pairs with rubber bottoms), old coat, normal\nI had clothes, a red belt, high socks (two pairs dark red), slippers, sleep clothes, brush and comb, sponge, towels, soap-case, two toothbrushes, a tennis racquet, a small hat, a belt-knife, and an old jacket.\n\nMom made sure I had all these things, and on a summer morning, I got on a train, going to RI place. As we got closer to RI, I saw a big wagon with four horses near a small building that was a station. I knew that this was for us campers because it already had five boys in it. Ten boys got off the train. The teacher, who was one of the \"masters\" of the camp, and who I had already met in the city, welcomed me, and we all sat in the wagon. We traveled up and down the hills, and the horses seemed to enjoy it as much as we did. The drivers of the mountains slow down their horses when going downhill, and speed up when going up. Now the road went along a narrow path next to a big lake and then through a thick forest, where tall, straight trees raised their leaves high in the air; smooth trees, with round, gray trunks, stood like big pillars; and great yellow trees, with rough, curling bark and twisted branches, rose like kings above the smaller trees. Finally, a quick turn in the road brought us to the words, \"CA camp,\" in big red letters on a sign hanging from a big tree. The gate-bars were down and a ride of less than half a mile farther brought us to a pretty forest where the cabins that made up the camp were.\n\nWho has not felt the fun of life in the forest? It is very hard to put them into words, or to make one who has never experienced them understand what they are.\n\nThere is a feeling of freedom and freshness every hour. A day full of simple, natural work and fun things to do. The ear soon gets used to the sounds around, and it begins to hear a gentle sound, like the sound of endless rain. It is the sound of small pieces falling from the spruce and pine and hemlock trees, to mix with old roots and underbrush and form the rich, dark forest dirt that every step falls so softly on. Then, there are sounds of moving leaves and quick, tiny steps, and a red squirrel runs on a fallen tree, looks at us, and makes a loud, sharp sound. A small bird sings a long, thin song. A bird that taps on trees makes a loud noise on a tree, and comes closer and closer until it maybe tries the tree that you're leaning on.\n\nWe looked at everything about the camp with a lot of interest. First was the cooking place, where a man was making dinner. This small house had a stove, two long tables, a cold box, and a lot of pots and pans. All the plates, cups, and dishes were shiny like mirrors. Next to it was the food storage, which had all the food for the tables. The sleeping house was long and had a slanting roof. The top parts of the sides and back could open and close. They were open during the day, but usually closed at night. Beds were all around the sides of the house, and who got which was decided by chance. At one end was a covered porch, where the dining tables were. Big lanterns were placed around, and several small lights were near the entrance.\n\nThere was a big box of medicines and other helpful things for the camp, and above one end of the house was a space for storing bags. Fifty steps from the house was the beach. The pretty lake was calm and quiet. It was long and wide, with many small bays and inlets. Some parts of it looked like many small lakes. Along the shore were boats of all kinds, from fishing boats to fast rowing boats. The quiet hills beyond stood tall and strong, while the big mountain looked down on everything.\n\nThe sound of a horn told us to come back to the main place. Bags were put in place, blankets and camp clothes were taken out; we changed from our city clothes to the camp clothes, and our time at Camp Henry began.\nIn the past, I got a job as a \"table helper,\" with one of the kids from the train as my partner. It was a new job for me, but one of the teachers helped us. We quickly set the table and a hot dinner was brought from the kitchen. One of the teachers said a prayer, everyone standing with their heads uncovered; then we put our hats back on and began to eat. Big cans of milk, each holding a lot of milk, were brought from the cold storage. The bread, vegetables, and meat needed to be refilled often. When dinner was done and the table was cleaned and the floor swept, my job was done until supper time. The camp chores were done by groups of kids whose jobs changed each day. A note with the jobs for the next day was put up each night, so every kid knew what they had to do the next day. Everyone in the camp, including the teachers, helped with the daily work. The plan worked really well. Each kid tried to do their job well, because if they didn't, it came back to hurt them. For example, if the kid whose job it was to keep the drinking water fresh didn't do it, the other kids who had to suffer because of it made his life hard; and so everyone in the camp helped to make sure everyone did their job. This plan gave a lot of responsibility to the kids themselves, and learning to be responsible is a good thing for anyone.\n\nAfter supper, we made a big campfire, and by then we all knew each other well and felt comfortable. The teachers were asked a lot of questions, and stories were told. One of the best things about camp was the evening gathering around the fire, and the nine o'clock horn always seemed to sound too soon. One of the teachers' brother had spent a year in the mines and farms of CO place, and his exciting stories and descriptions were perfect for our eager ears. We always had songs. They may not have been very well written, but we sang them with a lot of spirit. Here is one, to the tune of a song from a famous school:\n\n\"It's a way we have at Camp HA,\nIt's a way we have at Camp HA,\nIt's a way we have at Camp HA,\nTo pass the time away.\nIf I had a son or a kid I was taking care of,\nA smart kid, a show-off, or a poet,\"\nI would send him to Camp HA place,\n  To spend the day.\n\n  \"We want you to know, sir,\n  That being lazy is no good, sir;\n  Work first, then play, and so, sir,\n  We spend the day.\n\n  \"Now if you really want, sir,\n  A very yummy dish, sir,\n  Wait till we cook this fish, sir,\n  To spend the day.\"\n\n--and so on through several songs.\n\nBy bedtime every night, we wrapped ourselves in our blankets,\nlights went off, and it was quiet. I didn't mind this\nrule, for the true camper is always asleep as soon as he lies down. The\nnext thing I heard was a buzzing sound--the alarm clock had rung, it was\nearly in the morning, and the sunlight was shining on the campers.\nSeveral of us jumped into the lake for a bath; later in the season everyone\nhad to report with soap\nand tooth-brush. After breakfast, there was the usual camp\nwork,--lanterns to be filled, the sleeping cabin to be cleaned, various\nduties to be done, and wood to be collected; at eleven,\nthere was swimming lessons. And so the days passed. The work was\norganized so not to be too much for any one person, unless he\nwas lazy; and there was plenty of time for ball games, tennis,\nfishing, boating, and other fun. When the days were very hot,\nhammocks were very popular. We celebrated the Fourth of July with\na party. Our flag floated happily from our\nstaff, and the cabins were decorated with small flags. At night,\nthe farmers and people who lived in the woods, with their sisters, cousins, aunts, and\nfriends, came to visit us and stayed by the lake. Our\nfireworks were set off from a boat anchored a little bit away from land,\nand it was beautiful.\n\nSunday morning breakfasts were like typical NE ones,\n--baked beans, brown bread, fishballs, and chocolate. Everybody\nwas asked to write a letter home during the morning. After lunch\nthere was choir practice, followed by four o'clock service in a\nlovely little opening in the woods which seemed to be\nmade for a chapel. There simple benches had been made under the\nbig trees, and the ground had been covered with moss. At the\nback, stood a big rough cross, which was very clear against\nIn front of us was a dark forest and a small wooden stage. On Sundays, we would have a gathering here with many people, some even coming from far away. The teacher who led the gathering wore white clothes and read from the church book. We sang songs and hymns with violin music. Then there was a short talk.\n\nWe always collected money for helping others, which at the end of the season, we shared between a children's home in BR city and a boys' home in BO city.\n\nThe mail came twice a day, brought by \"the captain\", an old man from a famous NE family. The captain often brought his kind wife with him. Both of them were liked very much at the camp. The captain had fought in a war and had lots of stories to tell.\n\nOur camp dog was a big Newfoundland named Duke, and he was very good at swimming. Two of the campers had cameras and took pictures, which they sold for money.\n\nWe often had visitors from the city who were staying at nearby farms. Some of these visitors came a lot, and seemed to like watching us at the camp. Some of us knew people from BO and NE cities at one of the most liked boarding houses, and one day these friends gave us a fun day with a garden party, a tennis game, and dinner. At another time, we went to a costume party at the same place. Later, some friends at another house made us happy with some performances and charades, followed by dinner.\n\nSome of the boys became partners in business. Jobs for work were given to the groups that asked for the least money. The groups that got the jobs would hire other boys to help them. They had to do the jobs exactly as told. Among other things, a new pier was built, one of the cabins got new roof tiles, and another got a new black paper cover.\n\nBoys could do what they wanted with the money they made this way. No one liked to be lazy.\n\nOne good day, we took a long walk up a big mountain. We started early, and by the middle of the day we had walked more than half the way. We stopped in a cool grove, and soon our wagon came with blankets, rain coats, cooking stuff, food, and different tools.\nWe had a big lunch while we sat next to a nice little stream. After that, we started walking again.\n\nSoon, we got to the bottom of a big hill and started to climb. But, there is no road that goes on forever, and we finally got to rest. We put sticks in the ground in a pretty spot just under the top of the hill. It was a good place, protected from the wind. We quickly got lots of wood and soft pine branches to sleep on. We made a place to cook and our dinner started to cook in a big pot that hung from three sticks. One thing we liked to eat was pancakes. Many people came from the fancy place down the hill, where they gave us a fun show the next night. We stayed on the hill for three days, and they were full of fun things happening. At night, we slept around the burning wood, and two boys would stay awake each hour, so everyone got to sleep a lot. Every boy washed his own plate, cup, knife, and spoon after each meal, and showed them to a boy who was helping to check. We were all sad to leave the old hill. But it was nice to step on our own land again. And our camp was always dearer when we came back to it after such a trip.\n\nUntil a boy could swim a certain way, he was not allowed to go in the boats. All of the boys were soon very comfortable in and on the water. One of the boys from PH city swam the best mile. There were different groups in the camp, like cricket, base-ball, tennis, and rowing clubs, and a group of nature-lovers. Then there were different teams. The helper of the charity fund was very hard-working, and before we left camp, he had collected a lot of old clothes, which we decided to give to the newspaper boys of NE city and BO city.\n\nOn the 13th and 14th of the eighth month, we had the yearly sports meeting. There were all kinds of games, with first and second prizes for each, and you had to sign up by the 12th. Lots of people came each day. The tennis game was very exciting in both singles and doubles, but the boat races and tug-of-war were the most exciting. Long and short walking and running; sack and obstacle races; throwing the hammer; climbing; running, standing, and broad jumps; diving; swimming races,--all were included in the plan. On the night of the 14th, we had a big group of visitors at dinner, and a lady very nicely gave out the prizes. Then, there were fireworks and music. I had won prizes in several events, and felt proud because my name was sent to a big paper. The records were very good, as most of the boys were only ten to fourteen years old, except for me.\n\nThere was no serious accident or illness. We were all healthy and strong because of living outside, and I am sure that this helped us all do better work at school during the winter.\n\nWe left our camp on a morning. The night before, we had our neighbors as guests. Our good friends, David and Cameron, gave speeches, and we cheered for them and our other summer friends. The night was very cold, but we all felt warm. Fireworks exploded, and it looked like the lake was on fire. Then, our guests left while our favorite song was played. The lake became quiet again, and we felt sad about leaving the next day.\n\nThe morning came. The wind was fresh, and the air was clear. We were ready to go, and we cheered loudly for our camp before leaving. Our camp never seemed so beautiful as when we were leaving it.\n\nNext, there's a story about Robin's return.\n\nRobin was on a tilting branch. I asked Robin how he spent his time since I last saw him.\n\n\"In a green and nice land, by a summer sea-breeze, orange-trees with fruit are bent. That's where I spent my time.\"\n\nRobin told me, no doubt,\nYou played your best songs,\n  Playing to a new person's ear,\n  You forgot your friends here.\n\n  \"Little girl, honestly,\n  You're not being fair to a real bird!\n  I wouldn't sing a song,\n  Not when the leaves are falling or when I'm flying,\n  In the sun or in the rain;\n  A new person's ear would listen for no reason.\n  If I ever tried a note,\n  Something stopped me from singing.\n\n  It's because my heart was real\n  To the North and new Spring;\n\n  I could see a nest\n  In that old, split apple-tree!\"\n\n(Note: It's said that the robin doesn't sing during its winter stay in\nthe South.)\n\n\n\nLITTLE MISS MADISON\n\nBY DIANA JONES.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n  Little Miss Madison,\n  Full of fun,\n  Turned into Grandma\n  All in one day.\n  \"Now, kids, you see\n  How I look,\" said she,\n  \"And Grandma Hannah\n  Looked just like me.\n  They always do; it's the normal way.\n  All kids take after their Grandmas, they say.\"\n\n\n\nMOM'S IDEA.\n\n\nMr. Adam has been the teacher of the CE school as long as I\ncan remember. A few months ago, however, he was offered a better job\nin the big city, and he decided to leave CE town. We were very sad, for\nwe all liked him; and now that he's gone, it really seems as if a part\nof the school itself had been taken away.\n\nWe were to have a big test during the last two days of his\nstay, and Fiona had thought of a great project. She\nalways has good ideas, though I must say they are usually rather\ncostly. But then her dad is rich, and I suppose she never has to\nthink twice before spending a dollar, as some of us have to do.\nHer plan was to buy a picture book, put all our pictures in it, and give it\nto Mr. Adam in front of everyone, after he had closed the school. The\ngirls wanted me to give the book. Of course I was\nexcited about it, and went home thinking about what I should say and\nshould wear, and all that. There are fifteen girls in our class, and\nFiona said she knew of a beautiful picture book, one we wouldn't be embarrassed to\ngive him. It would cost only eleven dollars and twenty-five cents; and\nthat, you see, would be only seventy-five cents for each of us. I went in to\ndinner full of the new project, and began to talk about it at the table.\n\nBut Dad said no at once. He said he didn't agree with the idea at all. It would be too much money for some of us, and he didn't want to talk about it anymore. \n\nWhen Dad is like that, of course, we can't say anything more. I am too big to cry in front of everyone, but I didn't want to eat anymore, and as soon as I could, I went to my room and cried.\n\nMom came to my room as fast as she could. I knew she would. Mom always knows how to make things better. Oh, what do girls do who don't have a mom? She told me I must remember how hard Dad works for every coin, and that even though what he says might sound mean, it's only because he worries about work, and it makes him worry more when we want things he feels we can't have. Dear Mom! I wonder if she ever wants things she can't have.\n\nThen I told Mom everything; that it was not just that one plan, but that I could never be part of any plan that comes up. All the other girls had birthday parties and I went, but never had one myself. \"Of course I don't expect that,\" said I, feeling a little bad, as I saw the look on Mom's face. \"Birthdays are so normal in our family, of course we can't celebrate all of them; but I thought this time we had found something Dad would like. He talks about Mr. Adam a lot, and how much he respects him--but I guess that's over now. If I can't, I can't; it does seem hard though never to do what the others do.\"\n\n\"I understand, dear,\" Mom said, gently touching my hair. \"Many things are hard. You're old enough now to understand a little about adult life,\" she continued; \"and you must remember that it's only because we really need to, not because he doesn't care, that Dad has to say no sometimes.\"\n\n\"Well, if he could just say it a little nicer,\" I couldn't help saying. \"A hard no is much harder to take.\"\n\n\"I understand, love,\" Mom said, with a sigh; \"but Dad thinks he's doing what's best.\"\n\n\"But what can I say, Mom. I have to let them know I can't help. They'll all be talking about it this afternoon.\"\n\n\"Don't tell them anything for sure. Say as little as you can; and give me time to think.\"\n\nAt this, I felt a lot better. I knew the problem would\nSomehow, I hoped everything would work out right, even though I knew Mom couldn't get the money from our house money, especially after what Dad had said. But I trusted that Mom would figure it out for me, so I went to school, feeling sure, and didn't talk much about it.\n\nThat night, Mom came to my room and told me to invite all my class to spend Thursday evening with us. \"Grandpa sent us a barrel of apples,\" she said, \"a bunch of nuts, and some corn to pop. Maybe I'll bake a cake or two, and the coffee won't cost much. Luckily, we have enough dishes. This will make up for the birthday parties a bit, and you will also have fun. If you know any really nice boys, invite them, and maybe Papa will play his violin, and you can have a little dance.\"\n\nYou see, Mom was once a girl too. She remembers how it feels and she discusses such things with me as if she were just another girl. Of course, I was happy to do as she said, but I must admit, even though it was very nice, it didn't solve my real problem. It gave the girls something new to discuss, and as Mr. Adam would be leaving in three weeks, people stopped talking about his gift for a few days.\n\nBut the issue with the boys bothered me a lot. We girls are around fourteen and fifteen, almost like young ladies, but boys of that age are really boyish. They don't know what to do with their hands, how to ask a girl to dance, or how to do anything nicely. I mean most boys; of course my brothers do, but they have had Mom to teach them, and sisters to practice with since they were little, which makes a difference. If it wasn't that I disliked giving up the dancing, and if it wasn't such a fuss to dance with a girl with a handkerchief tied on her arm - because she keeps forgetting she is a boy and takes the wrong hand and everything is mixed up - I would have given up the idea of inviting any boys.\n\nOnce more, I went to my always helpful refuge in times of trouble, and Mom slowly pulled her needle out of the sock she was mending, and began to think about the matter.\n\n\"You see, Mom, it isn't a grand event, but I want it to be as enjoyable as possible, and a lot of clumsy boys would just ruin it.\"\n\n\"Don't be hard on the boys, my love; they are good in their own way.\"\n\n\"Yes, they are, but their place is to play outside, not at a party for little girls; and they know it. You know how hard it is to get Jack to come with me anywhere, and he is very polite compared to his friends.\"\n\n\"Well, it wouldn't be fair to keep the boys and girls from having fun,\" Mom replied. \"There are boys who would like your small party. There are those three boys at the church, who are learning for school. They are not more than sixteen years old, and they would enjoy a small party. And Mrs. Grace told me she wanted them to meet new friends to make their stay nicer. Then there is young Adam, at Dr. Patrick's, I know he would come, and his mom wrote me, asking me to be nice to him.\"\n\n\"Oh, what a wonderful mom you are, that makes the party sure to be a success!\"\n\n\"There are four good names to start with,\" said Mom; \"and those, with Jack and Sam, Dad's young friends, will be a good start. As for the rest, let the girls invite them; it's good to make people feel important for the success of a thing.\"\n\nSo, the next day, which was a weekday, I told my class about the party, and we all made a list of nice boy friends; but the four that Mom invited were the best of all.\n\nWell, everyone came; not one of the thirty was missing. Despite all of Dad's problems, we still had our house, because Mom's dad gave it to her when she married. It was a big old house with a big hall that went right through it; two groups could dance there and one in each living room. When I was tired, Mom took my place at the piano; and with Dad playing the violin we had great music for dancing. All the girls wore their best dresses but without fancy stuff, and everything went perfectly. At eleven we had our simple snacks. Mom had cut up a paper of sayings and mixed them in with the popcorn, and they made a lot of fun. After we finished eating and were standing around before starting something else, Dad suddenly said that there was a little thing to which he\nHe wanted to share an idea; he thought that the boys might not be excited, but he knew the girls would be very interested. Then he said that the girls had been thinking about giving a surprise gift to their teacher, and they had talked about a picture book; but he had a better idea. Then he showed a beautiful piece of paper with pretty drawings, and on it was a letter saying how sad we were that Mr. Adam was leaving, how much we had learned from him, and wishing him the best. I don't remember all his words, but after he read the letter, he made a funny and clever speech. Then he asked us to sign the letter if we liked it. He told us that he could get a nice frame for the letter for three dollars, which would only cost twenty cents for each person; and he believed that Mr. Adam would like the letter more than a more expensive gift.\n\nOf course, everyone loved the idea; all the girls were happy and signed the letter right away, in their best handwriting, and most of them gave their twenty cents right away. We asked Father to get the frame, and they voted that I should give the gift. But the fact that Father had done so much just to make me happy touched me the most. I knew that he was good at drawing fancy letters, but I didn't know he could make such a beautiful drawing like the one on the letter. I always knew, of course, that Father loved his kids. If any of us are sick, he is as gentle as a mother; and he does many things for us every day; but here he showed that he cared a lot about our dreams and plans.\n\nOf course, with the cake and coffee and everything, the party cost more than my gift and picture would have, but it seems that Mother had been planning to do something special for me which would help me pay for my party, and that was not the only time when she showed that she has \"good common sense,\" as Father says.\n\nI think my little party was talked about more than those of many of the other girls, even though they spent a lot more money than I did.\n\nThen, the day of the big test came, and when I gave the letter to Mr. Adam, even though I only said a few words, he could hardly speak at all,\nAnd he told Dad later that we couldn't have made him happier. It seems that he had heard some whispers about a gift, and was worried that it was going to be something costly, and felt troubled; for, as he told Dad, he couldn't say no to a thing before it was given to him, and he didn't know what to do; but the gift he could accept with real joy and happiness.\n\nYou can hardly believe how different my place in school has been since that thing. I was never really disliked, but I was rarely asked for help. Now, however, I am asked about everything, and my thoughts matter a lot to the girls.--But I know who should get the real praise, and I always say it is because Dad did Mom's idea so well.\n\nTHE BAG.\n\nBY TOM JAMES.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nI had just finished college, when I got a letter from my uncle Ryan, which surprised me a lot, as I had only known him by name. Mom had always told me that he was very strange, and the letter was really odd; it said:\n\n    \"Nephew David (if that's your name):\n\n    \"I need a helper in my workshop. I will pay you well. Reply soon.\n\n    \"UNCLE RYAN.\"\n\nI didn't know what to say back. I didn't have a job in mind, and didn't want to miss what might be a good chance. I talked about it with Mom, and she said she thought it might be worth trying and couldn't do any harm. So, to keep it short, I replied:\n\n    \"Dear Uncle Ryan:\n\n    \"If it works out, I'll try.\n\n    \"Your nephew DAVID.\"\n\nI think he was happy with the reply, because he welcomed me warmly, even though he didn't say much. My pay was quickly and happily settled, and I got a room near Uncle's house and started my work.\n\nAt first, I had so much to learn that I couldn't have done any useful work; but soon I started to understand things clearly, and I really think I helped--although I wasn't sure.\n\nFunny enough, I could never figure out what Uncle was trying to do. I mixed many things, got all sorts of tools ready, but was never allowed to see what Uncle was doing. Whenever I had prepared anything, he would take them to a small private room that he always kept the key to on his watch-chain. Nobody was allowed to go into this room, and I quickly learned that it was best not to talk about it. I'm not a nosy person, so I didn't ask about the secret, but just did what I was told without asking questions.\n\nAs days passed, I could see that my uncle was getting very nervous and upset about his work. He was always a quiet man, but now he hardly said anything.\n\nOne day he asked me to buy some special stuff for him, and he gave me a list of what he needed. When I looked at the list, I saw that it would make a big package, so I took my little bag and started my journey.\n\nSome of the things he needed were hard to find, and I had to go to many places before I found them all. It was getting dark when I got back home.\n\nI heard my uncle calling me when I came in, and he seemed very eager.\n\n\"Did you get everything?\" he asked as soon as he saw me.\n\n\"Yes, but it was a bit hard,\" I answered.\n\n\"Where are they?\" he wanted to know.\n\n\"Here,\" I said, giving him the bag.\n\nHe took it without saying anything, and went straight into his secret room.\n\nWhile he was gone, I stayed in the work room and tidied up everything. I was working for a long time - I can't say exactly how long - when suddenly I heard a loud noise from my uncle's room, and then a shout.\n\nI ran to the door and knocked.\n\n\"What is it?\" he sounded upset.\n\n\"What happened?\" I asked.\n\n\"Nothing! Don't worry!\" my uncle said. \"I can't be hurt!\"\n\nI went back to the work room, and since there was nothing else to do, I sat down to wait for him.\n\nThen I heard the loud noise again, and the same shout.\n\nI jumped up and, without thinking, I shouted, \"You're not hurt, are you?\"\n\nSuddenly the door opened, and my uncle came out, looking really excited.\n\n\"David!\" he said, \"go home. Here is your bag. I don't need your help tonight.\"\n\nI took what I thought was my bag, and went to my room.\n\nWhen I turned on my little lamp I saw that, instead of my travel bag, my uncle had given me an old, dirty, wrinkled and battered leather bag that looked really old.\n\nI laughed, and tried to open it. It was locked. After I tried to unlock it for a while and got tired, I opened my closet door and threw the bag inside.\nOn the very top shelf.\n\n\"Tomorrow,\" I said, \"I'll switch it for my own bag.\"\n\nI was starting to feel upset because of how Uncle Ulysses was treating me. He hadn't been nice to me and he hadn't given me my money for a long time. I had many bills to pay and they were coming faster than I could pay them.\n\nIt's not nice to do other people's work, especially when you can't see what you've done. I had been working for months without knowing what I was doing. I started to think I made a bad choice. What good was it to work in the dark, not learning much, and not hoping to do better? Uncle Ulysses wouldn't tell me anything and he didn't like being asked questions.\n\nI started to feel sad about what might happen and wondered if I should say I made a bad choice and start learning a new job.\n\nI can't remember how long I sat thinking, but the small light of my fire went out and left me in the dark.\n\nAs I moved around my room looking for small sticks to light, I heard a sound that seemed to come from the other side of the room. Then I heard small knocks and muffled yelling, like it was far away.\n\nBy listening harder, I heard the sounds clearly enough to know they were mice squeaking and--could I be wrong?--a scream; very quiet, but still a scream of fear.\n\n\"Oh!\" I thought to myself, \"there must be mice in the closet! But what was the scream?\"\n\nI went to the closet and when I opened the door, I was surprised to see a small light at the top, like a big bug that lights up. I was confused so I got a chair to stand on and saw--a big fight. On one end of the shelf, a bunch of mice were running away. They ran so fast! Some jumped to the floor, some just disappeared, and they were all gone!\n\nAs I was smiling at their fear, I was surprised to hear a small, high voice from the other end of the shelf talking to me.\n\n\"Huh?\" I said; \"did someone talk?\"\n\n\"I did!\" the voice said back.\n\nI turned and saw a tiny person on the shelf holding a little light in one hand and something like a small stick in the other.\n\nBefore I could stop being surprised, and before I was asked in a mean way if I would recognize him the next time we met, the\nA small man said:\n\n\"This is not nice, right?\"\n\n\"What is happening?\" I said, confused.\n\n\"Well! I can't believe it,\" replied the tiny man, sounding annoyed. \"Asking what's happening after keeping me in that old bag for so long! I would have been hungry soon; my food was almost gone! Maybe you think I'm not hungry now? Oh, no! Of course not! And you want to know what's happening?\"\n\nHe laughed loudly that I could hear it clearly.\n\n\"I would be happy to help you,\" I started, trying to calm the tiny man; \"but as for having kept you in for so long, my friend, that's not possible, because I'm only twenty-three!\"\n\n\"Oh, stop it,\" he answered, annoyed, \"I can't take it anymore! You've pretended to be innocent for too long; you can't trick me that way again. You will deny that your name is Thomas next?\" and he jumped up and down, very angry.\n\n\"Tho----which? Tho----what?\" I started.\n\n\"That's it, that's it!\" shouted the tiny man, very angry. \"Deny everything!\"\n\n\"Listen!\" I shouted, now tired of his games, \"I don't know anything about you or your Tho-what's-his-name, and if you hadn't made such noise in my closet, I wouldn't have come near you! I wish I didn't, then the mice would have gotten you!\"\n\nAs I stopped to catch my breath, the tiny man held his light as close to my face as he could, and after looking at me for a long time, said seriously:\n\n\"I think I made a mistake!\"\n\nThen, he jumped high and shouted, \"And now--I am free!\"\n\n\"Of course you are, as far as I'm concerned,\" I replied, not caring much; \"but I can't understand what all this fuss is about. As long as you are happy, I guess I should be too.\"\n\nMeanwhile, he kept jumping and spinning around, until he dropped his\nThe light went out and we were in the dark. He then became calm enough to say, \"What can you understand? You're only very young!\" He laughed as if this was very funny, and continued, \"If you give me a seat and something to eat, I'll tell you the full story.\"\n\nSo I got off the chair, turned on my small lamp, and held out my hand to my tiny guest. He climbed onto it and I placed him on the table under the light, where I could see him clearly.\n\nHe was very small and wore clothes that looked like they were made from mouse skin. He had a small belt and a tiny helmet. His face looked smart but not old.\n\nSeeing that he didn't want to be stared at, I broke the silence by saying, \"I'm sorry I can't give you a chair--mine are too big, I'm worried.\" I was afraid he might be upset by my words.\n\n\"Not at all!\" he replied kindly, now that he knew I wasn't a scary person, \"look here!\"\n\nHe called to my favorite big chair. Suddenly, it floated into the air, and, shrunk to a size suitable for him, it softly landed on the table next to him.\n\nIgnoring my surprise, he sat comfortably in it and, looking up at me, said, as if nothing had happened, \"I said I would tell you everything, didn't I?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered, leaning in with interest.\n\n\"Well, I won't!\" he said bluntly.\n\n\"You won't?--and why not?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh,\" he said, crossing his small legs casually, \"you wouldn't understand it.\"\n\n\"Maybe I would,\" I answered, smiling kindly. \"Just try me.\"\n\n\"Do you know what a special thing is?\" he asked, hoping that I might.\n\n\"No, I can't say I do--exactly,\" I admitted unwillingly.\n\n\"Then of course you wouldn't understand it--for that's the very start of it!--But never mind. Let's talk about something else. Is there anything I can do for you as a thank you for your kindness to a hungry guest?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry--I completely forgot,\" and I rang the bell.\n\nWhen the helper came, I asked for dinner for two. This unusual request made the helper stare in surprise. But I repeated the request, and she hurried off without asking any questions. She came back, and put the dinner on the table. She didn't see the little man run away when she came near the table with the heavy tray.\n\n\"What a clumsy person!\" yelled the angry little man. I didn't say anything, because I was trying to think of how to ask my tiny friend to eat with a big knife and fork.\n\nBut, while I was thinking, the strange thing happened again, and half of the food on the tray became small enough for him to eat. He ate a lot, like someone who was very hungry. I watched him in quiet surprise until he looked full.\n\nThen, he pushed his chair back, and said happily: \"A very good dinner! I would like to do something nice for you. You don't know how much you've helped me by saving me from that mean Trancast----\"\n\nHe stopped talking all of a sudden and looked sad. He looked so sad that I asked him a question to change his thoughts:\n\n\"And what could you do for me?\" He looked happy again when I spoke, and answered:\n\n\"Who knows? What are your problems?\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said, thinking, \"I don't have many. But I would like advice from someone older and smarter than I am.\"\n\n\"I won't say how _smart_ I am,\" said the little man seriously; \"but maybe, because I've lived for a very long time, I'm old enough to give advice to a young man.\"\n\nI looked up, thinking he would be smiling, but he was very serious. So I told him all about my uncle and my job, and asked him what he thought I should do. He looked very interested, and didn't say anything for a while after I finished talking. I waited for his answer more eagerly than I would have liked to admit.\n\nFinally, he said seriously, \"Bring your uncle to me!\"\n\n\"Bring----\" I said, surprised, \"bring my----\"\n\n\"Bring your uncle to me!\" he said again firmly, and so seriously that I didn't think about not doing it.\n\n\"Okay,\" I said quickly; \"but how am I supposed to do that?\"\n\n\"It's easy!\" he explained; \"write him a letter!\"\n\n\"But what should I write?\" I asked, not knowing what to do.\n\n\"You said he likes chemistry?\" asked the little strange guy.\n\n\"I think he only cares about that,\" I said.\n\n\"Okay. Now write this: 'I found something tonight that you\nnever thought of. Come right now!' That will bring him,\" my visitor said.\n\nI don't know why I was so easily scared by the little man; but I wrote\nthe note and sent it right away.\n\n\"Now,\" my little visitor continued, \"what else can I do for you?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" I said, laughing; \"unless you will pay my bills for me!\"\n\n\"With happiness,\" he replied seriously; \"let me see them.\"\n\nI showed him the bills, and he looked at them very carefully.\n\n\"Uh-huh--uh-huh--very good!\" he said, when he was done looking. \"You\nhaven't spent too much. I'll make them smaller for you!\"\n\nHe started making signs, like he did to the chair and the tea-tray, and\nI smiled, expecting to see the papers shrink. But when\nhe stopped I couldn't see any change, even though he sat down as if\nhe was very happy. Since he didn't say anything, I finally dared to say:\n\n\"Well!\"\n\n\"Well,\" he replied; \"look at your bills!\"\n\nI picked them up and was surprised to see that the numbers had gotten\nsmaller, until each bill was only a tiny part of what it had been.\n\n\"But that's silly!\" I said, getting mad. \"I'm not a baby! What\ngood will that do?\"\n\n\"You're only twenty-three,\" he said, not sure; and smiling as a knock\nwas heard at the door, he told me to open it.\n\nI did, and there stood my clothes maker, Mr. Matthew. I was upset, because I owed\nhim more than a hundred dollars. But he smiled nicely, saying, \"Could\nyou give me that dollar or two you owe me? I need some money\ntonight.\"\n\nI looked at him in surprise; but, thinking it was better to not ask any questions, I\ntook his bill from the pile on the table and gave it to him.\n\nHe read it out loud: \"One dollar and fourteen cents.\"\n\nI gave him the money. He marked the bill as paid and left me, seeming\nvery happy.\n\nI sat down in a chair, too confused to say anything.\n\nJust then the door burst open, and my uncle came in, huffing and\npuffing from climbing the stairs.\n\n\"Well, why have you brought me here----\" he started; but\nsuddenly I heard a scream from the tiny guy on the table. As I turned, he\nThe little man started calling--calling--calling, like he was very upset.\n\nI turned to look at my uncle.\n\nHe was not there anymore.\n\nThen I looked at the little man on the table--What a sight!\n\nThere was a small figure of my uncle on the table, looking with big eyes at the little guest.\n\nFor a moment they looked at each other--and then, before I could stop them, they were fighting.\n\nIt was done very quickly.\n\nMy uncle was too old and weak to fight the little strong man in leather.\n\nWhen they stopped fighting, my uncle seemed hurt, because he looked unsteady, and then fell back, making the cloth red like a knocked over bottle of red color.\n\n\"You bad guy!\" I shouted, getting angry; \"what did you do?\"\n\nFor a moment the little man could not talk. He was breathing hard and finally said:\n\n\"It is--but--fair! It is TR man!\"\n\n\"TR man!\" I shouted--\"that was my uncle! Explain!--I do not understand!\"\n\n\"Do you know what _dnax_ is?\" he asked, cleaning his sword with a cloth.\n\n\"No!\" I shouted.\n\n\"Then you _wouldn't_ understand,\" he said, sadly shaking his head.\n\nAngry at his answer, I ran for the table; but, before I could get there, my uncle stood up and started to fight again, using his umbrella bravely. I waited a moment, hoping he might win--but the fight was not fair. With a quick move of his hand, the other man made my uncle's umbrella fly out of his hand. Without a weapon, he kneeled and asked for mercy.\n\n\"TR man!\" shouted the winner, \"you deserve what you wanted to do to me!\"\n\n\"Oh, please be kind!\" cried my uncle.\n\nI could not watch this. I had to do something. I ran to the table, shouting, \"Stop! stop!--this has gone too far!\"\n\nAgain the calling! In a moment, I was a third little person on my table!\n\n\"Now,\" said the winning man, \"we are the same! Come on!\"\n\nI had no weapon. I could not stop them. Once, while I was not sure what to do, the little bully used one of my curtain cords to make a loop, put it around my uncle's neck, and flew up in the air, pulling my uncle with him. I heard glass break, and I quickly ran to the window just to see them flying away!\n\nAll that was left to show me this was real was the mark on the cloth, the little chair, and the tiny dinner. I looked around the room, but found nothing.\n\nI have never told this story until now--because who would have believed me? But if someone believes my story and wants to see what's left of the bully and his victim, they just need to open the little bag, and they can still see the little chair, the little knife and fork, and all the things left by my guest. No one who doesn't believe will ever see them.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCOOL LETTERS.\n\nBY HENRY.\n\nFOURTH PAPER.\n\nYou might find it hard to believe that there are so many different kinds of letters in the world that don't seem to have anything to do with each other--they didn't copy one from another, nor do they seem to come from the same letters from a long time ago. The number of people and countries today is nothing compared to those that are gone. So the number of letters and words we have is just a little compared to those that are gone and left no mark at all. Writing on paper and tree skin can only last as long as the paper and tree skin stay together; even in EG country, where it's dry and paper lasts longer than other places, it can only last a few thousand years. Countries that once had writing for a long time are now completely unknown, and with them their letters also disappeared, because no record of them was left on rock, brick, or pottery. What seems like a lot of stuff to read about letters is really very little compared to what we should have.\n\nYou remember how countries like the PH people, when they start to use a new set of letters, name these letters whatever they want, just like we sometimes teach kids their letters by saying, \"A was for Archer\" (or we may prefer to have A stand for an Apple, or some other word that starts with A); and \"B was for Butcher,\" or \"a Bear,\" or some other word that starts with B. There's no doubt that both the RO people and the GR people had lists\nLong ago, people who taught goodness and wisdom gave us our alphabet. They taught the people who lived in AN country, SA land, JU town, GO village, GE city, DA place, and SW area, many years after a very important person passed away. They didn't learn from the PH people, even though they heard stories about them. They didn't use the names of the letters from the RO people, they made up their own. They were wise and good people who learned from a group called the Druids. In old IR land, a _drui_ was a wise person, a good person, a doctor, and a magic person, and the name is a bit like our word tree. The Druids didn't like to write things down. They liked to go deep into the woods to think and learn, and sometimes they brought students with them. That's probably why the IR people, who were the last to change because they lived far away on a big island, picked this nice way of naming the letters when they learned the alphabet. They didn't call A, _alpha_, like the LA people did, they said A, _ailm_, which was their word for palm-tree and sounded a bit like _alpha_, and started with an _A_. And they had different names for the other letters too. They called their alphabet _bethluisnion_, using the letters B, L, and N to make a name. Another name was _aibcitie_, or A-B-C order, with _tie_ meaning order, or sequence. People in IR country, who lived in wooden houses in lands with a lot of trees, liked plants a lot. So, they named their letters after plants. We can guess that they maybe used pictures of trees and plants, leaves, tools for hunting, and things to do with trees to write. But we don't know for sure. It's not likely that they would write on stone or metal, so we don't have any of that writing today. The people in EG country didn't use trees or plants much in their writing. Only our 'S' comes from a picture of plants growing, which is thought to be a garden with too much water from the river. EG country didn't have a lot of forests. There were a lot of people and animals. But, people who spoke the Celtic languages liked trees a lot. The love of nature that we see in books today in GE country, FR country, IT country, GB country, and US country, might come from the Highland Scots. And from this, we might get the love of pictures of nature.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaBook"}, "hash": "19ef6d276079ba135d16832023e28c3ea509cab47ec4ba4bca6c2d9fe3b26719"}
