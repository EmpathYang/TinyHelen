{"text": "There's a special type of tool on the internet that helps you understand more about how some special house plans work. These plans are for people who are not feeling well or have certain health conditions. To use this tool, you need to give more details than when you use regular tools for normal house plans.\n\nA long time ago, two big companies, let's call them HA company and PA company, had these special plans. But then the big boss of all companies made some changes and these plans stopped. \n\nBut don't worry! Nowadays, there are new companies that have these special plans. When we say new, we mean they are new to these special plans, but not new to the business. \n\nThese special plans work by looking at how healthy you are. The less healthy you are, the more you can get from these plans. This is where the special tool comes in. Remember, if someone is very sick, they can get more from these plans. \n\nThere are some companies that give you these tools.\nThere is a special tool that some people use to find out how much money they can get from their house. But this tool can be tricky. It asks a lot of questions about how you live and how healthy you are. These answers help it guess how long you might live. This tool also uses a chart that looks at your age and if you are sick to give a number. \nThis tool tries to guess the most money you might be able to get. It does this by thinking about the worst things that could happen. You might not be in this worst case, but the tool will still give you this number. Because of this, you should talk to a helper before you decide if this is the right choice for you.\nWhat can Helpers Do?\nOnce you have a starting number from this tool, you should talk to a special helper who knows a lot about this. This helper can ask more questions to see if there are other things that might let you get more money or if you might get less money. The helper uses a special note from companies that do this to help figure this out.\nA helper can talk to the companies that give this money. They can ask if there are other things that might let you get more money or see what choices are available to you.\nYou should know that even if you see something on TV, the Internet, radio, or from this tool, you might not be able to get the same thing. Here's how a helper can be very useful. They have things that you might not have.\nWhy Use the Counting Tool\nYou might be wondering why you should use the counting tool if you still have to talk to a helper. The main reason to use it is to see the biggest amount you can get. If the biggest amount is not what you hoped to get, it helps you understand if these kinds of plans are good for you.\nAlso, it tells you if your being sick can help you get more than the usual amount. It might just be a guide, but it shows if talking to a helper is worth your time.\nEven if the amount might become less, the first count gives you a start. There are times when the counting tool is not giving you a big enough number because you have many health issues. If you find a big amount that works for you based on what you put into a counting tool and a helper can get more for you, it might be better for you. But, as you use the counting tool, you need to remember it's only a guess. You always want to talk with a helper who knows a lot to make sure you are getting the best plan for you.\nUnderstanding How to Get Extra Money When You're Older\nSometimes, when people get older and stop working, they might not have enough money for the things they want to do or for taking care of themselves in the long run. This can make them worried. There is something called 'equity release' that can help. It can give them a big amount of money that they can use for any reason. But, many people want to know how much money they can get before they ask for professional help.\n\nHow to Use an Equity Release Tool\nIf you've thought about equity release, it's a good idea to find a tool that can help you understand how much money you can get. This tool will need information like how old you are, how much your house is worth, and how much money you owe on your house. Then, it can show you which plans might work best for you.\n\nExamples Just For You\nLots of these tools can not only show you how much money you can get but also give you examples of how you could get the money. For people who are 55 or older, equity release gives them tax-free money. Some plans let you decide if you want all the money at once or a little bit every month. When you get older, you might need some extra money. One way to get this is by using the money that's tied up in your house, without having to move out. This is like having a house loan that you don't have to pay back until you either pass away or move somewhere for long-term care. When that happens, your house is sold, the loan is paid back, and any leftover money goes to your family.\n\nWhy Tools Are Useful\n\nThere are lots of companies that help older people get money from their houses. But it can be hard to understand all the different plans they offer. That's why they have tools on their websites to help you. These tools can tell you how much money you could get and help you decide if it's a good idea. \n\nThere are lots of different tools out there. Some help you compare different plans so you can find the one that's best for you. You just have to click a button! There are also companies that let you use their tools to look at all the different plans, not just the ones they offer. Sometimes, you might want to know how much money you can get if you share your toys with friends. Just like you, grown-ups need to know how much they can get if they share their house with others. This is a big decision for them and they need a good tool to help them. This tool is like a toy calculator. It tells them if sharing their house is a good idea or not. It saves them time, and helps them make the right choice. \n\nNot everyone can share their house, so this tool tells them if they can or can't. If they can, it tells them how much they could get. This is very useful for grown-ups, especially the older ones who don't work anymore. They can use this money to live happily and comfortably. But, they need to know all the facts before they decide. \n\nSo, a tool like a toy calculator is very important. It helps them understand their choices and how much they can get. If you ever think about sharing your toys, wouldn't you want to use a toy calculator too?\nWhat Is Good and Not So Good About Sharing Your House Money\nOnce upon a time, no one knew you could share the money from your house. Now, lots of people are doing it to have a nice time when they're older. \n\nSharing your house money is not for everyone, but it can be a good idea for some. More people are starting to do it, and there are more ways to do it than ever before.\n\nYet, it can be hard to understand all the different ways to share your house money. How can someone find the best way for them? How can they know which way is the best deal?\n\nTalking to a person who knows a lot about sharing house money can help. They can explain the good and not-so-good things about each choice. But first, a person can use a tool to see how much money they could get from different ways of sharing house money.\n\nGood and Not-So-Good Things About Sharing Your House Money\nThese good and not-so-good things are very important to think about. They help a person decide if they are okay with the chance of something not going as planned. The person who knows a lot about sharing house money will use this to give the best advice. Learning about how to share your home's worth is a big choice, just like when you decided where to live for the first time. It's key to understand the good and not-so-good parts of this choice. \n\nIt helps to find a place that helps you compare all your choices fairly, and keeps you up to date with all the options. That way, you won't miss out on a better choice. Make sure they explain all the good and bad points so you understand everything before you decide.\n\nThere are helpful companies like one we'll call EQ website. They have a special tool that can quickly tell you how much you could share based on simple things like how old you are and how much your home is worth. They always give fair and up to date help to people who want to find the best way to share their home's worth.\n\nBut, not all these special tools are really free and fair. Some only show a part of what you need to know. Others might use your details for things you didn't ask for. While some places use these tools to get information from you, there are also companies who give honest information based on all the good options for sharing your home's worth.\nTo put it simply, it's very important to learn about something before you decide to do it. Always look for help from a good company that can give advice to everyone, just like a grocery store that everyone likes because of the good things people say about it. \n\nThis story was shared in a place and has many tags about getting help, different ways to get help, good and bad things about getting help, and so on. It was shared on a day by a man named Martin. \n\nCan a UK helper tool work for people who are younger than 55? \n\nHelping plans offer solutions for a big problem that many old people in the UK face today. Changes in the way we live have led to problems that we see more and more in our world today. People are living longer, things are getting more expensive, there is a chance of needing to pay for long-term care and pension funds are getting smaller. This means that many older people do not have enough money during their retirement. But, while there is a problem with money, many old people own houses with a lot of value that they have not used. Helping plans offer a way to use this value without selling the house or moving. \n\nToday, the UK helping sector has grown and offers more flexible and new plans than before. There's a special group that helps people understand how they can use the money from their house while they still live in it. They think we need more ways to do this. Now, it's safer to do because there are rules to follow. As more people want to do this, there are more ways to understand and do it.\n\nOne helpful thing is a tool that tells you how much money you can get from your house. This tool uses your age and how much your house is worth to tell you this. But this tool can only be used by people who are 55 years old or older. This means it can't be used by people younger than 55 or older than 100. Most places will start with the age of 55 to make sure everything is right.\nIs sharing your house a good idea for young people?\nIn the UK, people usually need to be 55 or older to share their house and get some money. This is because there are rules to make sure that the people who live in the house after you won't have to pay more than the house is worth. This rule makes things safer, but it also makes things a bit more expensive. If we didn't have this rule, then it might be cheaper for people to share their house. \n\nHowever, to make sure everything is fair and safe, all the companies that help people share their house have to follow the rules of a special group. They need to make sure that their plan is okay with this group, or else they can't do it. This is really important and it has made people feel better about sharing their house.\n\nSo, until these things change, there are no ways for people under 55 to share their house with the help of the usual companies that are checked by the special group. Sharing your house can be a good way to get some money if you need it, but it can also mean that you have less money saved up and less to leave to the people who live after you. So, it's really important to think carefully about it - especially if you're young and plan to live a long time. And we all hope to live a long time, don't we?\n\nThis story is about Will. Let's talk about a fun tool that helps you know if you can use certain plans. These plans are becoming very popular and many people want to use them. So, we have a tool to help them understand if they can use these plans. \n\nThese plans can change your life, so you should always ask a smart grown-up for advice before using them. But before you do that, let's learn about some helpful tools that can make it easier for you to understand these plans.\n\nThere are two main kinds of plans: plans for your house when you're very old, and plans for giving your house to someone else. Each kind of plan has different rules about who can use them. A special tool, like a number game, can help you find out if you can borrow money using your house. This tool works by using the information you give it. For example, a tool to check if you can get a special kind of loan, called a lifetime loan, can tell you if you can apply for it and how much money you can get from your house. This depends on your age and how much your house is worth. The longer the loan, the more your house needs to be worth. The shorter the loan, the less your house needs to be worth. So, usually, if you're younger, your house needs to be worth more.\n\nWho has this special tool?\nLet's talk about a big company, like AC company, for example. You have to be at least 55 years old to apply for their lifetime loan, and your house has to be worth at least 75,000. Their tool asks you to tell your age, how much your house is worth, if it's just you or someone else applying with you, some things about your house, and if you want to leave some money for your family when you're gone.\n\nThe tool can tell you if you can apply for this lifetime loan and also how much money you can get from your house. This tool is just a fast and easy way to find out if you can apply for a loan using your house and how much money you can get.\nA big company, let's call it \"HB Company,\" has a tool that can help people figure out if they can borrow money using their house. This tool can show not just how much one can borrow but also what they might owe in the future. This is helpful if you want to know how much you might owe when the house is sold one day.\nFor help to see if you can borrow money using your house from any company, call a special phone number.\nThere's a question, though. Will a tool that helps you figure out if you can borrow money using your house really be free to use?\nBorrowing money using your house has become popular lately. This has made more and more ways to do it show up. People used to have to visit money lending places to find out how much money they could borrow from their houses. But now, many websites have a tool that helps people figure out how much they can borrow. This tool is called a money borrowing calculator. It's easy to use and gives people an idea of how much money they could get. But, some places use this tool to get personal information from people, which is not good. Some people might use your personal info to send you stuff you didn't ask for! This is a way some people try to sell things, but they should tell you what they're doing. Not everyone does this, though.\nSo, tools that help you figure out how to use the money you have in your house can be helpful, but some people use them to get your info and try to sell you stuff. But don't worry, there are good ones out there too that are fair and free to use.\nThere are also some special calculators out there that do more than one thing. They can help you see how much money you could get from your house if you're healthy, or if you're not feeling so well. They can also help you see how much money you could get if you only pay the interest on your house loan. If you're older than 55 and want to know more about these options, you can visit their website or give them a call.\nA person named Martin wrote about something important. It's about how people can use the value of their homes for something useful. \n\nWhat is the way to figure out this plan? \nHow do we calculate this home plan?\n\nPeople have been using this home plan more and more. In 2013, the number kept going up. Until October of that year, more than 800 million had been used from these home plans, and it might reach 1 billion by the end of the year.\n\nThis is a big deal for the people who help others use their home value. They have worked hard to make it safe and helpful. More people have been using a certain type of home plan. But, the original home plan from the 1960s in the LE city is still very important.\n\nWhy are fewer people using the original home plan?\nThere was a time when people used something called home trading plans more often. But now, people don't use them as much. Why? Because there are new ways that are easier and safer to use. These new ways are liked by many people.\n\nHere's a simple way to understand it. If you have a toy you don't play with anymore, you might trade it with your friend for a toy you like. But what if your friend doesn't want to trade? Then you keep your old toy. This is like the old home trading plans.\n\nNow, imagine there is a toy store where you can choose any toy you want. You can even change your mind and choose a different toy later. This is like the new ways. They give you more choices. That's why people like them better.\n\nBefore, some companies had a tool to help people figure out how many toys they can trade. But now, these tools are not used much. This is because people don't want to trade their toys as much as before. Sometimes, people need extra money and they think about using their house to get it. A company called Bridgewater came up with a tool to help people figure out how to do this. But not everyone can use this tool, only people who know how to use it can.\n\nA few years ago, a lot of people were interested in this idea. But then, they weren't. Why? Well, this idea means you have to sell some of your house. Most people don't like that. They like keeping their whole house. Also, there are now other ways to borrow money using your house without having to sell any part of it.\n\nThere are good things and bad things about this idea. One bad thing is that when you sell part of your house, you don't get as much money as you could. And if your house's price goes up, you don't get any extra money from the part you sold.\n\nAnother bad thing is that if something happens to you, you might lose a lot of your house's value. But, there are some new ways to protect your house's value if something happens to you early.\n\nThis idea is still around, though. So, it must be good for some people. It can give you a big amount of money at once. You don't have to pay anything every month. And, if you only sell a little bit of your house, you can still leave something for your kids or grandkids. There are different ways to use your house to get some money when you are older. One way is called a 'lifetime mortgage'. This lets you keep your house and get some money too. Some companies used to offer another way called a 'home reversion plan'. But, it's hard to find these plans now because more people like lifetime mortgages better.\n\nIn the UK, the home reversion plan is not completely gone. It's still used sometimes. You can find more information about these plans on special websites.\n\nThis was written by someone named Martin.\nWhat Can We Do With Money from Our House Without Selling It?\nPeople have started to like the idea of getting money from their house without having to sell it. This is becoming more and more popular. The first reason is, it lets people use the money that their house is worth. The second reason is, there are no rules on how they can spend this money.\n\nDifferent people want to get money from their house for different reasons. Some might want a big amount at one time, while others might want smaller amounts over time. This makes it a good choice for many people. Some might need money for a trip, and others might need extra money when they are older.\n\nBut remember, there are some things you can't do. For example, you can't make big changes to your house that might make it worth less money. Also, if someone else moves into your house, you have to let the people who gave you the money know. If the main person passes away, the new person living in the house has to give up their rights.\n\nIf you want to do something, it's always good to ask first. If you don't, you might break the rules.\nLet's think about this:\nGetting money from your house can be a helpful way for people to reach their goals. But, it's important to think about all the other ways you could reach your goals too. This is something a money helper can help you with. They can talk to you about all the different choices you have before you decide to get money from your house.\n\nAfter you've thought about all the choices, then your money helper can help you understand if getting money from your house is the best way for you to reach your goals. Talking about your goals with your helper can also help you see if there might be a better way to reach them without taking the same chances.\n\nFor example, your money helper might ask you about these things:\n- Maybe you could move to a smaller house instead of getting money from your current house?\n- Do you have any money saved up or other things of value you could use first?\n- Could you get help from other places that look at how much money you have?\n- Could your kids or other family members help you with money?\n- If you're planning to fix up your house, are there any programs that could help pay for it?\n- Have you thought about other ways to borrow money, like from a bank, using a credit card, or renting something and paying for it over time?\n- Maybe you could have someone live with you to help bring in some extra money?\n- Could you spend less money on other things to have more left over?\n\nYour money helper can help you think about all the possible choices to find the best one for you.\nPeople sometimes choose to get money from their homes, called equity release, for different reasons. They can use this money in any way they like. Some people might give it to their kids or grandkids, use it for a vacation, to fix up their house, get a new car, pay off a house loan, or even buy a second house for holidays.\n\nGetting money from your house can help you do things you've always wanted to do. But remember, it's not the best choice for everyone and it means you will have less to leave behind for your family when you're gone.\n\nThe next part talks about how planning your money is very important when you're older. The cost of living is going up, care costs are getting higher, and there's less money from the government. So, it's smart to use your money in the best way to take care of yourself when you're retired. Many older people who own houses like the idea of getting money from their homes. This can be done through a plan that lets them take out some of the money their house is worth. This money can be given all at once, or a little at a time, and they can use it for whatever they want. They only have to pay the money back when they sell the house, usually when they pass away or need to live somewhere else for a long time. This plan lets them use the money from their house without having to sell it and move out. \n\nPeople can use the money for many different things. For example, they could use it for a vacation, fixing their house, or as a gift for their grandchildren. Sometimes, when people are older and not working anymore, they need extra money to live comfortably. \n\nThere are many plans to choose from that can help different people. By figuring out how much money they can take out from their house, they can decide how they want to receive it. They could get all the money at once, get a little each month, or only take out money when they need it.\nWhat is a way to get money every month?\nMany people use a special math problem to figure out how much money they can borrow. They do this to figure out the best way to use this money. Some people might want to borrow a little bit of money every month, but sadly, no current companies let them do that. The only company that used to let people do that doesn't exist anymore!\nSo, if people need money regularly, they will have to think of other ways. They might choose a plan that lets them borrow a little bit of money whenever they need it. Some people might choose to borrow all the money at once and use it to buy something that will give them more money in the future. But, this could be risky because the amount of money they get back might not be certain. In fact, except for keeping money aside for emergencies, these plans should never be used to invest in something. A person who knows a lot about these plans would never suggest that.\nA person who knows a lot about these plans can help you understand how to do the math problem to figure out how much money you can borrow and the best way to use it. The first step to understand how borrowing money could help you when you're older would be to use the special math problem to figure out how much money you can borrow through different plans, and how it could be used in the best way to plan for when you're older. Once you decide what you want and figure out how much it costs, you can start doing things to make your dreams come true and be happy when you're older. \n\nLet's pretend we have a magic tool that can help you with this. This magic tool is getting more and more popular because it's really helpful. It lets people have more choices and find the best way to make their dreams come true when they're older. \n\nThis magic tool is a special machine that tells you how much money you can get from all your stuff. At first, only some special websites had this magic tool. But now, a lot of places have it because it's really useful. There was a time when, if you wanted to find out something, you had to ask someone directly or talk to them in person. This was not always easy or quick. But then, some smart people made a helpful tool. This tool could tell you the answer to your question if you gave it some simple information. Many people found this tool very useful and began to use it a lot. \nNowadays, lots of websites have this tool. This is good because it helps people find out things quickly. But sometimes, some websites use this tool to make people like them more, or to make people only see some choices and not others. This is not good because the tool is meant to help everyone and give them all the information they need.\nUsing this tool in a way that is not fair is not right. It's not good to only give some information and not all of it. The tool is there to help, not to make things more difficult or confusing.\nThere's a special tool online that helps people figure out how much money they can borrow from a plan that lets you use the value of your house. This tool is really good for starting to understand these plans. If you want to learn more about this, you can call the people who know a lot about these plans at a toll-free number.\n\nThis story is about how to best use this tool. It also talks about how much money you might get if you use this kind of plan, and how to find the best plan using this tool. It also talks about how your age might change how much money you can get. It also talks about how much money you should borrow, and compares this tool to other ones. It also talks about how to calculate the maximum money you can get.\nWhere Can You Find Businesses That Help With Sharing House Value?\nWhere Can You Find a Better Tool to Figure Out How Much House Value to Share in the UK?\nWhere Can You Find a Tool for People Who Already Have a Plan to Share Their House Value?\nWhat are the Best 5 Tools to Figure Out How Much House Value to Share?\nWhat Happens if You Take Out the Most Money with a Tool That Helps You Figure Out How Much House Value to Share in the UK?\nWhat's Known About Tools That Help You Figure Out How Much House Value to Share, But Only Charge Interest?\nWhat Do You Need to Use a House Value Sharing Tool?\nWhat are Your Best Solutions for When You Retire?\nWhat is the Formula to Figure Out How Much House Value to Share and How Interest Adds Up?\nWill a Tool That Helps You Figure Out How Much House Value to Share or a Tool That Only Charges Interest Give You the Most Money?\nThese are plans to share your house value and lifetime mortgages.

{"text": "This is a story about being lucky and happy when things happen by chance. This is what happened to the project I'm going to tell you about. The name of our project was picked out of nowhere and it created so many fun side stories that I can't even count them all. This morning, another lucky surprise happened.\n\nPeople who follow this story will know about the main character. He didn't know he was the hero of the story. Let's call him Adam, who was working on a big project about a library and an art gallery. When he was almost finished with the project, he decided to take a break. Adam then went on a boat trip to a faraway place on the first day of a warm month, because he wanted to say thank you to the people who inspired his work.\n\nA man named William, who started the group that inspired Adam, had passed away many years ago. But there were still other important people in the group who were active, even though they were getting older. Let's call them Ethan and Cameron. Victor and others were creating wonderful things, but it was getting close to their bedtime. You know, the soft, gentle time before sleep, when we forget that it's soon time for dreams. Young Thomas didn't think about sleep when he hopped on the big boat for a trip. For Adam, the boat's sad trip started a new part of his life, but not for the 1,198 friends who didn't come back.\n\nNot just looking at the amazing things from the Arts & Crafts or talking with the people who made them, the trip itself was a special thing. Maybe Adam didn't know how special it was until it was too late. Think about the talks during dinner or in the sitting area; walking around the boat, even though some people had to stay in different parts because of old-time rules. For a friendly boy like Thomas, every meeting was fun; every new friend could be a pen pal and maybe even a customer.\n\nI didn't know how many chances there were, besides a few of the most well-known passengers. Think about a chat during lunch with Ethan and Alice, from EA town, who started \"The Crafters\" and its important papers. Or meeting Penelope, one of FR country's first lady builders, who came back from the sinking; she had learned in the office of Matthew, Michael, and William. There was a man named William who loved stories. One of his favorite characters was a kind man named Benjamin, who was from IR country and was very important among his friends. William thought Benjamin had a lot in common with his friend Adam and Adam's family. William had a feeling he needed to look more closely at a list he had.\n\nOne day, William remembered his old friend Fiona. Fiona was no longer with him, but he remembered her fondly. She used to take care of all the old stories and pictures for a newspaper in their town. People would always ask her about things that happened a long time ago. William thought that Fiona's collection was full of cut-out stories and pictures, all organized in a special way that made it easy to find anything.\n\nRecently, William saw some people selling old newspaper pictures. This made sense to him because people are now taking pictures on their computers and phones instead of using cameras with film. This gave William a new way to find pictures for his own stories. So, he spent some time looking through these pictures and picked a few that he could use. He thought of a story about a big accident right away.\nHow much change do you think is needed to make this picture fit a story? Sometimes bad things happen more often than we'd like. When they do, we have lots of questions. Why did this happen? Did people get hurt? Who's to blame? This big accident could have made the news. Or maybe someone spent a lot of time digging up the truth about it.\n\nNow, let's imagine this story is like a car, and it's starting to move.\n\nI also started reading a book that's been sitting on my shelf for a while. The book is about ideas and their history, and it seems like it might help with our story project. The book is made up of different stories. The first one is about how hard it is for people to really understand things that happened a long time ago. I've tried to do that, and I think I've learned a lot from it. I can understand why some people might not want to join in with my game. It can be hard to know if our project called \"A-town\" is successful or not. I guess I am like a young child, hoping that people who visit my project out of interest will want to come back again. But not many have so far. \nI'm still thinking about whether I can solve the problem we have. I know it's possible, but can I do it? \n\nIn our community, we had a big dinner last week at a church called \"AS church\". If you didn't come -- or even if you did -- it might be hard to believe what happened. But I bet those who were there trust people a lot more than they did before dessert was served.\n\nWe couldn't have some of our favorite foods this year, like HB's pork stuffing or the oyster stuffing that everyone loved last year. That's because this meal was for everyone in our town, maybe the first time ever. That night in the lower part of the AS church, everyone enjoyed the turkey dinner. This includes people from TE, the AC place, and many different Christian groups from our town. There was a big parking area between three buildings where people meet. Many people came there on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.\n\nMaking a big meal was tricky. They had to think about many things. Some foods were not allowed because of different food rules, allergies, and what people liked to eat. They had to make food that followed kosher and halal rules. They also had to think about people who could not eat dairy or gluten, people who were allergic to nuts, and people who didn't eat meat or any animal products. It was a big job to plan and make the meal.\n\nThere was no plan for where people would sit. The idea was for people to sit with others who were different from them. It was not like at Lake Wobegon, where people sit with others who are like them. The reason for this was different. We will see if this happens again and if it serves a bigger purpose.\n\nAnd how did they make pumpkin pies without cracks in the middle?\n\n- Written by \"William\"\n- Posted on a Monday afternoon\nA long time ago, in a place called AI town, two artists named William and Alfred created beautiful pictures. William made pictures of important people in AI town. His pictures were so loved by everyone that he made a second collection. He had a special way of making his pictures, using simple, clean lines and a touch of fancy style.\n\nWilliam also worked with his friend Patrick, and together they were known as \"The Art Brothers\". They made pictures for different things like food products and shows. These pictures are now considered treasures, just like William's earlier work.\n\nAlfred was another artist in AI town. He and William were both very popular for their art. They created many beautiful pictures that are still admired today.\n\"A Little House\"\nIt's a painting of a tiny house. It's made with paint on a board. People often wonder why life in the countryside is so interesting. A little house in the EN country might not look like a farm in the AM country. But, they are both simple and real, which makes them special. Some people think it's because they like to imagine a better life in these places.\n\nAdam was a painter, just like his dad, William. His dad was a very busy painter who moved to AU city when Adam wasn't even born. Adam was born in NE city, and when he was still very young, his family moved back to the EN country. His dad taught him how to paint. Adam liked to paint many things like people doing things, sports, dogs, horses, and donkeys. Some of his paintings were used to make special pictures called engravings.\n\nAdam got to show his paintings at the Royal Art Show. He also got to be a part of two important art groups. There were a lot of places where art was shown. Some of these places were the RB Society of Artists, WA Gallery, LS, MA of Fine Arts, RI of Painters in Water Colours, and the RI of Oil Painters. You can see some of this art in many museums in the UK. \n\nOne small piece of art might have been made to be bigger. \n\nThere was a big show in 1912. We're still working on making a list of all the art that was in the show. Here are some of the art pieces that were there for now:\n\nAdam made a piece called \"The Hug\". \nAnita made a piece called \"View of CH City from a Roof Top\". \nMay made a piece called \"Parade\". \nFrances made a piece called \"Ohio Landscape\". \nT. made a piece called \"Canal in FL Country\". \nBertha made a piece called \"NE City Bridge\". \nWilliam made a piece of \"The Queen\". \nAugust made a piece called \"Teacher and the End\".\nHere's a list of some artists and their works:\n- Artist 'A' made a painting called \"M Farmyard\".\n- Artist 'P' made a painting called \"Oddalisque\".\n- Another painting by an artist we don't know is called \"Dedication of the BB\".\n- Artist 'E' made a painting called \"Sentinel\".\n- Artist 'L' made a painting called \"Study of Three Lions\".\n- Artist 'A' made a painting called \"The Old Cottage\".\n- Artist 'C' made two paintings called \"Sunrise\" and \"Sunset\".\n- Artist 'C' made a painting called \"Barbizon\".\n- Artist 'E' made a painting called \"Sand Barges\".\n\nThen we have an artist named 'Bella'. Bella was born in a place called HN town a long time ago. She lived near the sea in a place called SE coast for most of her life. Bella loved to paint and she painted for her whole life, even when she was old. She was part of a group called AS and her paintings were shown in many places, including famous places in LL city.\nA lady named Diana had a very long life. She had a big party when she turned 100 years old. A couple of years after her big party, she passed away when she was 102 years old.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "49fc151e8c710e95eed3d9915e2fe8d7024790cdbed295d160936b1773df2344"}

{"text": "A big meeting happened where Adam talked about how money and goods are shared in our country. He said that in the next year, our country will be doing better and we will have more things. But, last year, there were some big changes in our country about how we share things. These changes made things slow down for a while. But now, things are getting better again.\nAdam shared some good news about a new rule that helps people pay their pocket money to their communities. This rule made things better by growing 12%!\n\nThis new rule, along with another rule, helped more people - about 1.8 million - to start paying their pocket money to their communities after a certain month in 2016. Besides the usual increase in people paying their pocket money every year, 1.8 million new people started doing this because of these new rules.\n\nEven though more people are paying pocket money to their communities because of the new rule, the amount of pocket money going to the community is still less compared to what it is in a place called CH country.\n\nThere's also good news for the community because the formal group of people, who pay their pocket money and are watched over by community helpers, is bigger than what people thought it was. When we don't count the people who work on farms, more than half of the people are part of this formal group because of the new rule.\nPeople in our IN country share a lot of things they make and use. This sharing is about 60% of all the things we make and use, which is more than what we thought last year.\n\nWe also looked at what our IN country shares with other countries for the first time. We found out that places in our country that share more things with other countries are usually happier. We also found out that not just a few, but many different people and places in our country share things with other countries. For example, only 1 out of 100 places in our country makes up 38% of all the things we share with other countries.\n\nBut we also need to be careful. We might have to spend more money to get oil from other countries. We also need to be ready in case the things that people buy and sell for money become worth less all of a sudden. This could make it harder for people to share things they make and use.\n\nBut overall, our IN country is doing well. Things are getting better because of new ways we have started to share things. Samuel also said that more people are starting to use their own money to make things. He also said that we are finding ways to solve a big problem we have. This problem is that some people owe a lot of money and some banks have lost a lot of money. But we are trying to solve this problem with new rules and by giving more money to banks.\n\nWe are now waiting to see what new plans Victor will announce in his speech on the next day.\nSomeone who helps at a website,\nDreams of creating a wonderful three-part story one day!\nImproving Numbers", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "f0b4df2df9723cb576297b7f2296beb2686d207536af600a2dde45e74bc535d3"}
{"text": "Important Rules for Giving Gifts to the Church by Kevin in Helpful Tips\n\nGiving gifts to the church is a kind thing to do. But there are rules to follow to make sure those gifts can be counted as part of tax deductions. This means that when people give gifts to their church, they can get a little bit of their money back when they pay their taxes. \n\nIn a recent case, a man and woman gave $6,548.27 to their church in TE state by writing 20 checks. Ten of these checks were for more than $250 each. But there was a problem. The tax people said the couple didn't follow the rules for these ten checks. \n\nThe rule says that if someone gives a gift of $250 or more to the church, they need a special note from the church. This note should tell how much money was given and what else was given if anything. It should also say if the church gave anything back to the person who gave the gift. And it should describe and give a good guess of the value of anything the church gave back, or say that the church only gave back something that can't be touched or seen. There are rules to follow when giving gifts to a church. One of these rules says that the church must give a written thank-you note to the person who gave the gift. The thank-you note should be given before the person has to tell the government about their money for the year. \n\nIn a story, a family named the \"Gabriel Family\" gave a lot of money to their church. But, the church did not give them a thank-you note in time. Because of this, the people who help decide about money problems said that the Gabriel family could not say they gave away money for gifts that were more than $250. Even though the Gabriel family showed that they gave money to the church, they still needed the thank-you note from the church for the big gifts. The money people did say it was okay for the Gabriel family to say they gave away money for gifts that were less than $250.\n\nThe money people reminded everyone that if you want to say you gave away money, you need to follow the rules. \n\nIn another story, Mr. & Mrs. \"David\" gave $22,517 to their church in a year long ago. Adam and Alice gave a lot of money to their church. The church said thank you and wrote them a letter. But the letter didn't say if Adam and Alice got anything back for their money. The people who look after the money for the country said this was not right. So, Adam and Alice got another letter from the church. This letter said they didn't get anything back for their money. But the money people still said this was not right because the second letter came too late.\n\nA man named Benjamin also gave money to his church. The same problem happened to him. This is a big problem when people give money to their church. So, it's very important that people who give money and the churches know the right way to do it.\n\nChurches should tell people to give money with checks instead of coins and paper money. This is because a check from the bank is a good way to show that they gave money. It also helps the church keep track of the money and say thank you in the right way.\nWhen people at the church give money, the church should give them a special envelope. They can write their name, the date, and how much money they gave on the envelope. The church keeps the envelope, and the person can use it to remember how much money they gave. \n\nEvery week, the church should write down how much money each person gave. \n\nAt the end of the year, the church should write a letter to each person who gave money. The letter should say how much money they gave, if the church gave them anything in return, and what the thing they got is worth. If the church gave them something that you can't touch, like a blessing, the letter should say so. If the church is late sending the letter, the person might not be able to use the money they gave as a deduction when they do their taxes.\n\nIf the church has more questions about how to keep track of the money people give, they can call us or use our contact form.\n\nSomething about your business...\nPeople helping each other with money...", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "59d52fada77aa68df3d41004651dde4d1a83ad63ae51fdd5c4fb934d1be9d7f8"}

It's about Benjamin meeting an older man at a place where people gather, and later learning from a paper that the older man was very rich. The rich man gave all his money to someone he didn't know very well. At the end of the song, Benjamin leaves a gift of six drinks at the rich man's resting place. The song reminds us that \"Goodness is great, drinks are nice, and people are silly.\"\n\nSomeone asked, \"Who is the older man in the video with Benjamin in 'People Are Silly'?\" Alice answered in the year 2010. \nThe older man in the video is a friend of Benjamin's family. The older man also lives in the same area as Benjamin. Benjamin has many friends in that area. - answered Diana in a later year.\n\nAnother question was, \"Where was the 'People Are Silly' video made?\" Charlotte asked this in the same year Alice did.\nIt's a wonderful song and video, but I'm not sure why it was filmed on an island when the song mentions a different place. I always thought it happened there.

{"text": "Let's talk about a big change in the motorcycle racing rules. In the past, riders had one hour to race as fast as they could to get a good starting spot. But starting this year, things are different. \n\nNow, the times from practice runs count too. These times help decide who gets to take part in two special races, QP1 and QP2. \n\nIn the QP1 race, the riders who were 11th or slower in the practice runs get to race for 15 minutes. The fastest two riders from this race get to join the top ten riders in another race, QP2. The QP2 race decides the top 12 starting spots. \n\nThere's also another practice run before the QP1 and QP2 races. This run doesn't count towards the starting spots. It's just a chance for the riders to get used to any changes and make any last-minute fixes.\nThe new way of doing things is making things more fun and safer. Race Leader David explains, \"We've made these changes for two reasons. One is to make it more fun to watch. We've split the racers into two groups, one fast, one slow. The other reason is for safety.\"\n\nDavid goes on to explain, \"Each group will have a clearer track and can try their best to get the fastest time. We used to have a one-hour qualifying session, but now we have 30 minutes of practice and two 15-minute sessions to see who's the fastest.\"\n\nHenry, a very experienced coach and a helper to Benjamin in the YR Team, thinks it's a good idea. \"I think it's going to be more fun for the watchers,\" he says. \"There will only be 12 bikes in the final session so it's going to be very exciting.\"\n\n\"We'll use the three practice sessions to get things right,\" Henry adds. \"We'll likely use the last practice to test a long lap, to get ready for the race.\" This isn't about who goes the farthest. A short time, maybe as long as a TV show, should be enough. After that, we'll get ready to keep an eye on the clock,\" says our friend, hinting that using our time wisely will be important.\n\nSplitting everyone into two groups will also be good for the smaller teams.

They were hoping to enjoy the book because it seemed like a fun made-up story and they like old, important stories a lot. But they did not like the book very much. The story was not strong and it was hard to get into it. The story moved very slowly and kept jumping around between different parts, which was confusing.\n\nAlso, there were parts in the book about Cannonbridge that tried to sound smart by talking about lots of other writers, but it just felt like it was trying to hide that it didn't have much to say. The story relied on very unlikely things happening and it didn't seem to matter what Cannonbridge did in the world of books. Even though he met lots of people, there was no real proof that he was a very important writer in the 19th century.The story here was not very fun. A man named Jack was in it, but he was not very interesting. He was just a man who felt something was not right. But we do not know why he felt this way.

The song is a remix, which means it has been changed a bit from the original version. Some people think that when spots appear on the bottom, it is a type of skin problem called acne. Bumps on your bottom aren't really spots. Spots happen when tiny holes in our skin get filled with too much oil, old skin, and germs. These holes are all over our body, but they are more in places like the face, neck, chest, and upper back, where we have lots of oil-making parts. Our bottom doesn't have many of these parts, so it's rare to get real spots there. \nMost of the time, the bumps on our bottoms are from two things called folliculitis or keratosis pilaris. Keratosis pilaris is when a hard skin protein blocks the part of the skin where hair, sweat, and oil are made, causing tiny bumps. Folliculitis is when the part of the skin that makes hair gets red and swollen. This can happen because of rubbing, wearing tight clothes, or shaving. These bumps can look like spots. Sometimes, skin can also break out because it is irritated or has been in contact with something that it doesn't like. \nKeratosis pilaris is very common and can run in families. We don't really know why it happens. Folliculitis happens when the part of the skin that makes hair gets hurt, which leads to redness or germs getting in. Sometimes, little bumps can pop up on your skin. They don't usually hurt or itch. These bumps might show up on your arms or legs too. After you take a bath, putting on lotion can help make your skin feel smoother. Using a special cream can also help your skin feel better.\n\nIf these bumps are caused by something irritating your skin, like tight clothes, it might help to stop wearing them. Putting a warm cloth and a soothing cream on the area can help calm it down.\n\nIf the bumps don't go away or bother you, you should talk to a doctor who knows a lot about skin.\n\nNow, let's ask a question: Have you ever found a bump on your skin and thought it was a pimple? It's okay, this happens to a lot of us! Don't worry, it's very common. But sometimes, it's not a pimple. That's why taking care of it can be a bit tricky.\nSometimes, little spots can appear on your bottom, but don't worry, they can be taken care of easily once you know what they are. We asked two skin doctors, who we'll call Miss Rachel and Miss Isabel, to tell us more about these spots. They told us how to tell the difference between spots on your bottom and spots somewhere else, told us some reasons why you might get these spots, and gave us some good advice on how to make them go away. So let's learn how to say goodbye to these spots!\n\nMiss Rachel told us that spots on your bottom are very common and normal. But guess what? These spots aren't the same as the spots you might find on your face. If we want to be really exact, what you're probably seeing on your bottom is something called \"folliculitis\". This is a big word, but all it means is that the little holes where your hair grows out of are a bit angry and they look like a spot. Miss Isabel told us that even though these spots on your bottom can look like the spots on your face, they're not the same thing and so we shouldn't try to make them go away in the same way.\n\nSo how can you tell if the spots on your bottom are folliculitis or the spots you get on your face? Here's how you can tell:\n\nWhat does folliculitis look like?\nFolliculitis and the spots you get on your face can look very similar and it can be hard to tell the difference, but a skin doctor can easily tell.\nAcne looks like this:\nAcne is small bumps on your skin. These bumps can be blackheads or whiteheads. Imagine a mix of small white and black bumps, sometimes even a bigger bump that hurts a bit.\n\nWhat about folliculitis? \nFolliculitis looks like a red bump with a hair in the middle. The bump may have white stuff around it, which is just dead skin and white blood cells. It often appears as several small, white bumps, about the same size. But unlike acne, it doesn't have blackheads.\n\nSometimes, people get real bumps on their bottoms, which is why it's important to see a doctor. They can tell you what's really happening and how to make it better.\n\nAnd remember, never try to pop, pick, or poke any bumps on your skin. This can make them worse and even leave a mark after they're gone. So, remember to say no to popping and picking.\nWhy do some kids get spots on their bottoms? \nWell, spots can appear when something rubs too much against your skin. Do you notice you get more spots in the summer, maybe when you're wearing your swimsuit or after a good run and jump in the park? That's because wet clothes can make these spots pop up. But don't worry! You don't have to stop swimming or playing. You just need to know the best way to live your life every day.\n\nHow can I stop getting spots on my bottom?\nThe first thing you need to do is go to a doctor, who can tell you why you're getting spots. Once you know why, you can stop them from coming back. Even small changes to your daily routine can help your skin get better. So, once you've planned a visit to your doctor, try the tips below.\n\nDr. Isaac says washing with a special soap that has a lot of a thing called benzoyl peroxide can help. This special soap can stop the spots and unclog your skin pores, while also making your skin less red and puffy. Rub it on your spots, then let it stay for a bit before washing it off. This gives the special soap time to work.\n\nBut be careful: benzoyl peroxide can make your towels lose their color, just like it can help your skin get better. So, if you don't want to risk your favorite bath towels, make sure to rinse your skin really well after washing.\nIf you have little red spots on your bottom, don't scratch or rub them hard! Instead, use a special skin cleaner that gently removes the stuff that clogs your skin. Here are some good ones we like:\n- a deep cleaning cream\n- a night cream\n- a daily body lotion\nIf you want to make these spots go away faster, you can visit a skin doctor. They can help you with special treatments. One of these treatments makes your old skin peel off to make way for new skin. But if you want something less strong, you can also use a special face peel at home that works the same way.\nThe skin doctor can also suggest a light lotion that won't make your clothes dirty. This lotion helps calm your skin and get rid of things that cause spots.\nWearing loose and light clothes can also help. The doctor suggests cotton underwear because it's less likely to cause more spots. When we play hard and get sweaty, or when our clothes rub against our skin a lot, it can cause our skin to feel sore or even make little bumps appear. Dr. Ryan sees many kids with these little bumps these days, and thinks it might be because they're wearing their comfy play clothes a lot while at home.\n\nIf your clothes are too tight and make you uncomfortable, maybe try wearing looser ones until your skin feels better. If you're going to play and know you'll get sweaty, try wearing clothes that don't keep the sweat on your skin. Sweat can make it easy for tiny bugs to grow on your skin and cause more little bumps. And remember, play clothes are not for lounging around.\n\nSo, after you finish playing and get sweaty, change out of those clothes as soon as you can. This is also true for your swimsuits or any other wet clothes. Who likes to stay in wet clothes anyway, right?\n\nI know it's hard when you're tired after playing, but it's important to change out of your sweaty clothes. Once you've done that, it's a good idea to hop into the shower and wash off all the sweat and tiny bugs. According to Dr. Ryan, a quick shower or a wash with soap is the best way to take care of these little bumps, and it also helps prevent them on other parts of your body, like your back.\nWe talked about a special kind of soap that helps smooth out bumps on your skin (it works by cleaning out the dirt and old skin). A doctor named Dr. Ryan suggested this soap also helps lighten dark spots on your skin. It's good to have this soap around.\n\nSometimes, your skin might need more help. In that case, you should go see a doctor who knows a lot about skin. They can tell if your skin is just bumpy or if it's something more. Dr. Ryan says doctors see this all the time, so it's nothing to be embarrassed about. Just remember, don't wear sweaty clothes for too long, okay?\n\nThis story was written by a person named Bella. Bella writes stories for a big website.\nWhen it gets warm outside, some kids might feel a little upset about wearing clothes that show more skin. They might worry about getting little red bumps on their skin. Don't worry, this is normal and happens to many people. \n\nHere's an easy way to understand it. Sometimes, your skin might feel a bit bumpy or you might see little red spots. This can happen if your clothes are too tight or you've been scratching your skin a lot. It's not really a problem, just something that happens sometimes. \n\nOur friend, a skin doctor from the NE city, says these little bumps aren't bad and they're not really spots like you get on your face. They're just a little irritation around the hairs on your skin or from your clothes rubbing against your skin too much. So, don't worry, you're doing just fine!\nHere is a way to know if your skin is bothered by something, just by how it feels or where it is on your body. Little itchy or hurtful lumps can show up. They can get bigger if they are irritated.\n\nHow can you help your skin feel better? The first thing is to keep it clean. Washing with a special soap can help keep away things that can make your skin upset. However, sometimes it's not just things like dirt or germs that make your skin upset, it could be something else, like a fungus. If that's the case, you'll need a different kind of medicine to help your skin feel better.\n\nAbout a place, it was made a long time ago and has 11 small areas with 37 places in them. It's in the southern part of a big region, between two rivers, and is a pretty big area. There is a big place called KA country. It's near the KT area, the RK country, the OR area, and the KZ area. This place is very special because it has people from many different backgrounds. There are people who come from RU, KA, TA, BA, UK, GE, BE, MO, and other places.\n\nThe main place in this area is a village named BR village. This village got its name a long time ago because of a special event that happened. People from RU won a big fight against people from FR in a place called BR in NL country.\n\nIn this big area, there's also a village named NA village. A long time ago, an important road passed through it and an old well is still there. There used to be a big fort there, built by the OR army on the 15th day of the 5th month a long time ago. Now, this fort has been changed into a church where people go to pray.\n\nThere is also a place called DE village in this area. This village has a special museum which tells the story of the local area and shows the beautiful work of people who live there. These people make beautiful things with beads, straw, clay, paint, wood, and fabric.\nBR area is a place where lots of food is grown. After they started using more land in 1954, it became the biggest place in the area for growing hard wheat, and for producing milk and meat.\n\nMost of the work done here is farming. There are 14 big farms, 39 smaller farms, and 8497 garden plots. Together, they use a lot of land.\n\nGrowing plants makes money in this area, but so does raising animals. Even though it's just a little bit, it's still good. Most of the money from raising animals comes from breeding them.\n\nThe main thing that the farms in BR area do is grow grains. This takes up most of the land. Out of all the grains, spring wheat is the most common, and it takes up a lot of space.\n\nThere are two farms that do a really good job at breeding and selling animals. These are called AF K company and A company.\n\nAt the end of 2015, the farms in BR area had a lot of cows. The big farms had 9150 animals, including 3687 cows. The smaller farms had 659 animals, including 305 cows. The garden plots had 12851 animals, including 5545 cows.\nIn the BR region, they grow two types of animals for milk and meat. This place is special because it has lots of minerals like gold and stones. It also has rivers, small ponds, and reservoirs which are very important for nature. \n\nThe BR region has a lot of trees covering 6% of the area, and some parts are protected because they are home to many ants. \n\nA long time ago, they found something very special in this region. It was the oldest cart in the world! Later, they also found a really old place where people used to live and pray. This place is like a big castle and a church, and it's very important to history. People from all over the world are interested in it. In a special place, there is a museum that teaches about old things and how people used to live long ago. There's also a big outdoor place where houses from a really, really long time ago have been built again. They even have a special hill where a king from a long time ago was buried.\n\nIn 2016, in a village called BR village, they built a new play area called \"Golden Ear\" for 39 village games. The play area has 5 running paths and green grass that isn't real, and it's really big. The play area has a place for running and jumping far, and a place for playing football. They also have places for running races. They had a big party when they opened the play area. They had games in 9 sports: running, boss games, football, small football, a ball game for men, a ball game for women, lifting heavy balls, pulling on a rope, and lifting heavy things. Lots of people from 22 places came to the village games (561 people), and there were 32 people to make sure everyone played fair and 22 more people. The BR village team did really well and came in 9th place.\n\nFrom one special day to another special day in a place called OS city, there was a football game called \"Cup of K\". Four teams from our school went to play in the game. The youngest team from the \"middle school football team\" was led by a man named Michael, two teams of little ones born in 2009. A little older team was led by a man named Andrew - 2008, and the oldest team - pupils of a man named Yuri , guys born in 2005.\nIn the year when Adam was born, William played with older kids born a year before him. \"Football Team\" was placed in Group B, and they played against teams from \"MO City\", \"VL City\", and \"NA City\". \n\n\"Football Team\" tied with \"MO City\" with no goals from either side. \"Football Team\" won against \"VL City\" with a score of 4:0. Goals were scored by Adam twice, Nathan, and Gabriel. \n\n\"Football Team\" won against \"NA City\" with a score of 9:2. Adam scored 3 goals, and so did Alice. The other goals were scored by Gabriel, Yosef, and Nathan.\n\nAfter these games, their team got to the final round. They had to compete against teams from \"ST City\" and \"DR Country\". But, honestly, they didn't do well in the final games. They didn't score any goals. They lost to \"ST City\" 0:8 and to \"DR Country\" 0:5.\n\nEven though they didn't win the final games, \"Football Team\" came home with a bronze medal from the tournament.\nAdam became the best player in the game. In this game, there were 16 teams made up of kids born in 2008. They were evenly divided into four groups.\n\nDavid's team played three games:\nTheir team played against \"FR team\" and the score was 1 to 5. The only goal was scored by Jack.\nNext, they played against \"NE team\" but lost 0 to 2.\nFinally, they played against \"MO team\" and again lost 0 to 1.\n\nAfter these games, David's team didn't get the chance to play for the top spots. But they continued to play in another cup with teams of younger kids.\n\nThey played against \"MO team\" and won 1 to 0. The goal was scored by Nathan.\nThen, they played against \"GA team\" and it was a tie, 1 to 1. Ethan scored a goal. \nNext, they played against \"LY team\" and won 3 to 0. The goals were scored by Ethan, Isaac, and Samuel.\nLastly, they played against \"KR team\" and lost 0 to 5.\n\nAt the end, David's team finished in 12th place.\nIn the year when a bunch of kids were born, 12 teams came together. Two of them were from our school, and were guided by a person named Matthew. Matthew's second team found it a bit hard.\nThey played a few games against other teams. The scores were close, but they didn't always win. In one game they scored 1 point, but the other team scored 2. In another game, they scored 1 point and the other team didn't score at all.\nAfter playing a few more games, Matthew's second team ended up in the 10th spot. The first team, though, did really well. They won all their games and scored many more points than the other teams. In one game, they even scored 11 points! The kids' soccer match had quite a few goals. Adam, Alex, Michael, Ethan, and Matthew were some of the players who scored. The kids from our school were able to beat the team from \"SO city\" with a score of 3:0. The goals were scored by Kevin and Matthew.\n\nIn the next match, our team played against the team from Sochi. We won that match too, with a score of 2:0. Matthew and Adam were the ones who scored the goals. We could have won by even more, but we missed a goal opportunity.\n\nIn the final match, we played against the team from ZH city. It was a very exciting game. We scored first, but the other team was able to tie the game. Michael's team managed to take the lead again, and we were able to keep that lead. Our goalkeeper, Oliver, even stopped a goal from the other team. At the end of the match, our team won with a score of 2:1. The goals were scored by Adam and Matthew.\n\nOur team, the \"2009-1 soccer school\", won the big soccer cup of 2018! Adam was chosen as the best player of the game. People in the world used to catch a lot of big sea animals like whales. But now, they catch fewer whales because they want to keep the whales safe. In a big country called RU, they noticed that there are more whales now, like the minke whale, fin whale, and humpback whale.\n\nThere is a special day called World Whale Day. It is celebrated on a day in the middle of the second month of the year. On this day many years ago, people all over the world agreed to stop catching whales for business. Only a few countries still catch a lot of whales. These countries include GL country, JA country, KO country, and NW country.\n\nPeople stopped catching so many whales in the year when the World Whale Day started. Before, they used to catch around 165 thousand whales every year. Now, they only catch around 8.5 thousand whales every year. In RU country, only some special people can catch whales. They catch whales to keep their old way of living.\n\nAccording to a big institute in RU country, they can only catch a certain number of whales each year. This number includes 140 gray whales and five bowhead whales. In RU country, people catch between 120 to 170 big fish-like animals every year. Some people watch these animals closely to learn about them. They watch from the shore, from boats, and from planes. They've noticed that certain kinds of these big fish-like animals are not decreasing in number. \n\nTo help these animals stay safe, people in RU country are making a system that makes noise to keep these animals away from boats.\n\nIn the AR region, they might start hunting a type of seal again. This type of hunting stopped in 2009 because it was not right and too costly. But now, there are many seals and people are thinking about starting to hunt them again, but only if it is safe for the seals.\n\nPeople are also taking a close look at other sea animals all over the country. They found that there are too many of some animals, which could cause problems for the environment. This is happening in places like BA lake, KA place, and the northwest areas of the country.\nPeople have been catching seals in the WS sea since a very long time ago. During a big war, these animals helped a place called AR city by providing food. In the middle of the last century, people started catching seals from helicopters because it was better than using boats. The fur of a baby seal was very popular.\nNear the end of the century, many people, including famous scientists and singers, started a big movement against catching seals. Catching seals was stopped ten years ago.\n\"Actually, by that time it had already become less popular,\" says Adam, the leader of the fishermen in AR city. Catching seals from helicopters was not good anymore, and people didn't want seal fur as much. But things change, and today it could be good to start catching sea animals again to make many different things. We could bring the seals to the shore when they're still young, like we used to do. Or, like in other places, catch grown-ups in the sea and work on them right on the boat. There would be almost no waste. This is shown by the experience of people in MA city.\nIt's important to say that people still catch seals today - but only a little bit, and only as much as scientists say is okay. The most important thing is not to hurt the seal population. In 2019, there were a lot of seals. People who live in certain places rely on hunting these seals. Sometimes, they are allowed to catch a lot of seals and other times, not so many. For many years, one country used to catch more seals than the other. But then, the rules changed and the other country began to catch more.\n\nLately, one country has stopped hunting seals as much. This is because of what people think, how much fuel costs, how hard it is to get to the seals, and how hard it is to sell the seal goods. The other country still hunts seals but not as much as they could. They face problems because there's less ice for the seals to live on and it's harder to sell seal goods in some places.\n\nAccording to a man who runs a hunting company in another country, the oil from the seals is mostly sold in far-off lands. He believes the future of his business lies in using more parts of the seal. For example, they are studying how to make medicine from seal blood.\nPeople who want to start fishing again in RU country have two questions. Is it good for money and is it kind? Some people, like our friend Samuel, think it might make money if we use everything from the fish. They also say they will only catch big fish, not the little seals. They remember a time when they caught a lot of fish and it was good for their town. Our friend Alice is not sure. She worries about the baby seals and the ships that might hurt them. Sometimes, seals can slip into cracks in the ice. This is very bad for them because the water is very cold. People are trying to keep the seals safe when big boats move through the icy waters. Later this year, people will talk about how many seals can be safely caught. \n\nOn a different note, there's going to be a big soccer game. One team, which usually doesn't get this far, has made it to a very important stage. This is exciting for everyone who likes soccer in their home country. This is the first time in many years that a team from their country has made it this far. They were able to get to this point thanks to a lucky draw. After a hard game, they won a spot in the main soccer tournament.\nThe team didn't do well in their last big game. They came in fourth place and lost a game with a score of 0 to 8 against a very good team. This tied them with another team for the biggest loss ever. People remember this game because of something a man named Adam said. He said it was like a big kid taking a toy from a little kid. \n\nA very good player scored 4 times in that game and helped his team win. \n\nIn the last five years, the team hasn't gotten much better. They're one of the least valuable teams in the league. Only one other team is worth less money. \n\nA man named Jack helped the team get to the big game by winning some other games.\nA TV channel talked about how much soccer teams are worth this season in a big soccer competition. The average price of these teams is a lot of money - fifteen times more than a team called Malm. When we look at all the soccer tournaments in Europe, the best match for Malm would be the Conference League. In this tournament, the average price of the teams is much less, and it's even less in another tournament called the Europa League. This price is close to what a team named Zenit is worth. \nLast year, a team called Club Brugge was thought to be a big challenge for Zenit in the big soccer tournament. People thought Zenit should have won easily. But, the Belgians played as well as the Russians, and even beat them. When we look at how much the players were bought for, Brugge was not much less than Zenit: it was a certain amount for Brussels.\nBrugge beat Zenit 3: 0 in a match.\nMalm is not as good as the other teams. In RU city, a team called Sochi is worth about the same as Malm, and Sochi has never won against Zenit yet.\nMalm doesn't have any famous players. Their best player is a young man who's 22 years old: a team called Atalanta has recently shown interest in him. There were some players who played really well. One of them was a striker from CR country named Adam. He used to play in a big league and scored lots of goals. His goals helped his team reach an important game. He scored two goals in the first round and two goals in the third round against a team led by Samuel.\n\nAdam's team was planning to send him to a team in SW country. Adam didn't play much this season and only scored one goal in 16 games after moving from another team.\n\nAt SW country team, the coach was very famous. His name was Jack. Jack used to play for a big team in the early years of the 21st century. He helped his team win an important competition. Jack scored a goal in a game against another team, which helped his team go to the semi-finals of the competition.\n\"Football is what I love. If I could, I would even eat football! I've had many wonderful teachers who helped me understand the game better and they always inspired me,\" says a top coach from a big team in NE city. \n\nHe used to be a big star player of his country's team. Recently, people have started to notice him as a great coach. From 2016 to 2020, he was helping coach Kevin, whose team played really well at a big football event in 2020. Now, he's seen as one of the new, exciting coaches from his country, along with Ben (from a team in MA city) and Thomas (from a team in BR city). Doing well in a big football tournament would be great for his work. In the SW league, he's been working all season and people think he's the best coach of the year. His team won the league for the first time in three years.\n\nHis team might not be the strongest in Europe, but they've done some great things before. There's one really special thing they did that everyone remembers! A long time ago, a club from the SW country went all the way to the final match of a big football tournament. They played against a team managed by Benjamin from the NE city. The game was very close but the team from NE city won by just one goal. \n\nSince then, no other team from the SW country has been able to make it to the final match of this big tournament. The club that reached the finals didn't even make it to the playoffs of the tournament anymore. Over many years, they only made it to the group stage three times. They only played against a team from the RU country one time, during the old times. \n\nBefore a new match at the GA place, it seems like the people from the SP city should be able to score three points against the team from the SW country. The team from SW country is not as strong as last year's BE team or even the CB team. Today was a big soccer game day. A small team from SW country played against a big team from IT country. The little team didn't win, but that's okay because sometimes, smaller teams do win against bigger teams. This happened in another game last week. The game shows that size doesn't always matter. \n\nIn another story, people thought a lake was hurting a big sea. The lake, called KB lake, is very special because it's close to a big sea. This looks very different on maps. There is a big sea and a little sea. They are connected by a thin strip of land. Behind the land is a small water path. It's as long as 10 soccer fields and not wider than 1 soccer field. \n\nFrom high above, we can see that the little sea is lower than the big sea. It's like the little sea is a bowl and the big sea is pouring water into it really fast. Because of this, the water can move very quickly, sometimes even making a small waterfall in the sea. \n\nThe little sea is in the middle of a rocky area. The name of the little sea means \"Black Throat Lake\". It used to scare people long ago. They thought the water was bad. \n\nThere's another name for it too. It means \"Bitter-Salty Water\". That's because the water in the little sea is really salty.\nA big lake is surrounded by the sands of the KA desert. It doesn't leak or connect to the sea. This lake gets water from the sea, but the water doesn't leave the lake. It simply disappears into the air. But when water disappears, the salt in it stays behind. This makes the lake water much saltier than the sea water. In fact, it's so salty that even fish can't live in it. \n\nThis saltiness can even damage things like the metal parts of ships. When the wind blows, it can carry the salty water into the air, and this can spoil fresh water. People used to be scared of this lake. They didn't understand why the water was disappearing. They thought there might be a hole in the lake where all the water was going. But now, scientists know the truth. The water isn't going into a hole. It's just disappearing into the air. People have been telling stories for a long time about why big boats can't float in certain waters anymore. Some say water from a big lake can flow secretly under the ground to a big sea or even to a place where it's very cold. \n\nThis big sea is a big puzzle because nobody knows where its water comes from. We talked about this before. People think this sea started to lose water because two big rivers were not bringing as much water as before. \n\nSome think that the rivers' water was just adding to the sea's water. When the rivers brought less water, the sea's water got less and became very salty. Of course, people who study nature say this is because water turns into vapor and goes up into the sky. That makes sense.\n\nBut maybe the old stories were right. Maybe the sea got extra salty water from a big lake. Maybe that's why the sea almost disappeared, not because people took too much water from the rivers. \n\nAlso, some people think that this sea and another big sea were connected a long time ago.\nThere was a big lake called SR Lake. It was connected to another lake called KB Lake. These two lakes were very special because they had lots of salt in them. This salt was good for people and they would collect it.\n\nThe salt in KB Lake was everywhere. It made the lake shores look like they were covered in snow. The plants near the lake had salt hanging from them, just like icicles hang from roofs when it's cold. The salt was easy to collect, just like picking up sand from a beach.\n\nThis salt was a type, which could dissolve in water if the water was warmer than 10 degrees. But during winter, the water could get as cold as 5 degrees. During this time, the salt would come out of the water and form a thick white mass on the shore. People would then move this salt away from the water so it wouldn't get washed back in. Then, they would just wait.\nLong ago, people from the RU country tried to use the salt from a big lake. But they couldn't do it. The first people from RU country to visit this lake came in the early 1700s. They made a map of the lake. But then, for about a hundred years, people stayed away from the lake because they thought it was dangerous. The next time people visited the lake was in the 1800s, but they were told not to go there. \n\nIn the 1980s, they decided to build a big wall between the sea and the lake. They did this because the sea was getting smaller and there was less water. They had many ideas about how to fix this problem. One idea was to bring water from the big rivers in SI place. They were also trying to save another lake that was drying up. They were worried that the same thing would happen to the sea. In the end, they decided to build the big wall to stop the water from leaving the sea and going into the lake.\nA big wall was built and it stopped water from flowing into a lake. Without water, the lake started to dry up. The wind blew sand into the lake, covering up the salt that was left behind. This caused a big problem. The salt was blown into the air and it made the water and ground dirty for a long distance around the lake. It was not good for the sheep to eat the grass there anymore. Many sheep got sick because of this. \n\nThen, they put tubes in the wall to let water from the big sea flow back into the lake. But soon after, the people in charge decided to take down the wall and let everything go back to how it was before. And it did! Water from the big sea started to flow into the lake again, even without the wall. The lake and the area around it got better.\n\nThe lake used to be deep, with boats sailing on it. The land around it was scary, and the water seemed to go on forever. But then, the water went away and you could walk on the bottom of the lake. But remember to wear good shoes! A big piece of land changed a lot. It looked like a desert and everything around it changed too.\n\nThere is a big company that takes gold from the ground. It is in a place called BO region. This company gets better every year because they use a special way of working. This way of working helps them do their job better and not waste anything.\n\nThis special way of working comes from how cars are made in AM and JP companies. These companies have done really well because of it. A long time ago, there was another way of doing things that helped companies do well.\n\nWhat we've learned is that companies do well when people like working there. The way this company works makes sure people are safe and the work is done well without wasting time or things. The company tries to make each job as good as it can be. They use a special way of planning work, which helps them do their job better. People at a big place called PJ company worked very hard, like the older folks did many years ago, to finish 46 important tasks. These tasks were tricky and needed lots of skill. The jobs were done outside, not in their usual work areas. All kinds of workers - handymen, machine experts, and engineers from different parts of PJ company - worked extra hours because they knew their work was important. They were really into their work and didn't plan on stopping.\n\nThe way the PG company works allows its people to think of new and better ways to do their jobs, find ways to waste less, and do more work efficiently. It also gives people a chance to earn more money if they come up with good ideas. One time, in the main engineer's department, they came up with a great idea that helped them fix a big machine faster, which saved a lot of time.\nThere was a big machine that wasn't working properly. It was tilted a little bit, which made it not work as well as it should. To fix it, they would have to take apart a lot of things, like the hard concrete base and some parts of the machine. This would take a long time, about 25 days, and they couldn't use the machine during that time. \n\nA group of workers, including Adam, Olivia, Benjamin, Victoria, Alice, David, Emma, Frank, and the project leader, David, came up with a plan. They decided to make the base of the machine a little thinner, about as thin as a pencil. This would help to make the machine straight again without taking apart everything. They checked with the people who made the machine to make sure this would work.This passage talks about different topics. First, it mentions a music download. Then, it talks about some things used in a game. After that, it talks about a headache on top of the head. It also mentions something about getting hurt, like a burn. This was written a long time ago.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "b1835e3dc6dbc8c3beff3a76b846f1b3d4ff3af82c06df6efa661438e1c2bce8"}
{"text": "There's a helpful new tool at the big school! This tool, named 'Course Profile', can help students learn more about their classes before they decide to take them. For example, one student wants to take many classes next term and wants to know how much work these classes will be. Another student wants to know if a certain class is good for what he wants to study. The 'Course Profile' tool can give them the information they need. \n\nThe big school, also known as 'DI school', introduced this tool on a special day for all students who take classes. In the past, students could only learn about their classes from their friends or from the internet, but this information might not be correct. \n\nThe person who made this tool, let's call him 'Adam', said that the goal is to show useful information that's easy to understand and trust. This tool is an improved version of an old tool at the school. The old tool gave teachers lots of information about their classes, like how many students signed up, the average grade, and how students did in other classes.\nThere's a special place that makes tools to help kids learn better using information. Two of their tools, named ECoach and GradeCraft, are already helping kids in many classes. They also made a new tool that gives everyone lots of new information about different classes. This includes who takes them, when, what they choose to learn more about, and what other classes they take. The hope is that kids will use this information to pick the classes that are just right for them.\nThis tool was made by a team of smart people who know a lot about technology. It started in one place in 2006 and got bigger to include another place two years later. Since then, it's helped a lot of teachers answer a lot of questions.\nAfter the special place was made in 2014, this tool and two others were chosen to be made even better. They were given a big award because they promised to make learning even more special for everyone.\nEthan mentioned that a new school program is focused on classes now. But, it uses a fun coloring book style that can also show different parts of school life, like subjects, teachers, and after-school activities. Ethan and his team are starting to work with student clubs, school advisors, and teacher leaders to make it better. They will have more talks about this in the next school year. \n\nThis new program gives a quick overview of each class in the database. It tells what the class is about, how many students really wanted to take it, how many learned a lot, and how hard the work was according to students who took the class before. \n\nBenjamin, a student studying information, helped the team by having weekly talks with the student council. He was the representative from the information study area. He said students who know about this tool are looking forward to it. \n\n\"Knowing about classes and how to choose them is very important for students. A big part of the new program's appeal is being able to see some responses from class evaluations,\" Benjamin said. He added that it might make students want to participate more in evaluations. \n\n\"Students have always wanted this information. By giving them what they want, we hope that students will keep using this tool every semester.\"\n\nDavid, the main developer, said student involvement through special groups, a design activity, and a small test run was very important for developing the new program.\n\"A lot of kids found it fun and useful.

{"text": "A group of writers discussed a serious topic about young people and health. They talked about how some kids can be unkind to others because of their weight. This unkind behavior can make the kids feel very bad and can also affect their health. \n\nThe writers studied a group of teenagers who were trying to lose weight at two different health camps. They asked these teenagers many questions about if, where, and how they experienced this unkind behavior. The goal of this study was to understand more about this problem and how it affects kids who are trying to get healthier.\nThe study tells us that many children who are bigger than others are not treated nicely at school. This is not nice and happens a lot. It can last a year or even five years. It is often other children and sometimes even adults like sports coaches or parents who are not nice. They might say mean words, not want to be friends, send mean messages online, or even push and hit.\n\nThis is not good and happens even if the child is not bigger anymore. Because of this, it is important for adults who work at schools and help children to know this. They can help children who are being treated badly.\nSomeone thought you might like to visit a special doctor's website for kids. To get there, you might need to sign in or make a new account.

{"text": "Sony's new game, Spider-Man: Miles Morales, is causing some confusion. First, people were told it wouldn't be a full game, but that was changed. Now, it's getting even more mixed up.\n\nSpider-Man: Miles Morales will cost $50. It's like another shorter game which was sold for $40. But, if you want to play the new and improved version of an older Spider-Man game on the new game console, you have to buy a special version of Spider-Man: Miles Morales that costs $70.\n\nYou can't buy the new and improved version of the old Spider-Man game by itself. Also, you can't change your old game into the new and improved one. The only way to get the new and improved game is to buy the special version of Spider-Man: Miles Morales.\n\nThis means you can't play the new and improved version of the old Spider-Man game on the new game console unless you pay $70.\n\nA big boss at Sony said they won't change this. Right now, there's no plan to give the updated version of the Super Hero Spider-Man game by itself. But if you buy the Spider-Man: Miles Morales game on one game console, you can get a better version on a newer console for free. If you have the basic version of Miles Morales, you can pay a bit more money to get a better version on the newer console. This way of doing things might be a bit hard to understand and could cause some problems. It's also been said that you can't move your game progress from the old console to the new one for the Super Hero Spider-Man game.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "09a958550cdbb82a1b0c8e697b0b4820bd4606fc64d8af7bf21d64d89767e730"}
{"text": "Victor, a big kid who loves hockey, is teaming up with a big hockey group to bring special hockey gear and a new sports program to his school's ice rink. \nHis school is planning a big sports event in the middle of summer. \nIn a town named GA town, Victor, who plays defense and leads his school's hockey team, is working with the big hockey group to get money for special hockey gear. This gear is for kids and young people who need help moving around. \nThe first event will happen in the middle of summer. Young athletes from a group called Youth Challenge will get to play special hockey and go ice skating at Victor's school's ice rink. There will be food, drinks, and giveaways at the event. Other kids from Victor's hockey team will be there to help out. \nVictor says, \"I'm happy to raise money and let people know we need new special hockey gear. I want to create a skating program for people who need help moving around, and share my love for hockey with these young athletes. Special hockey is a fun sport and activity, and my goal is to make this a long-term program at my school. This way, our community can use the new gear and have time on the ice.\"\nAdam had saved up $15,000 with the help of sponsors. This money was to buy special sleds for ice games, safety gear, and to pay for the time spent on the icy field. The main idea was to buy the gear and field time while letting everyone in the community know about it.\n\nThe head of Adam's school, Hannah, was very happy about this. She said, \"I am very proud of the way Adam is helping others with his love for ice games.\" She also said that Adam had earlier saved money for the 'Rainbow Kids' and now he had made it possible for teens who could not move their legs and arms well to play ice games. She felt Adam was a good leader in his team and school.\n\nA group called 'Young Challenge' helps young people who cannot move their legs and arms well to play sports and have fun. They were really looking forward to this new plan.\n\n\"We are really happy about this chance that Adam is giving us and our team,\" said Chris, the head of 'Young Challenge'. \"Our players are excited to play ice games on sleds and be part of this special plan.\"\n\nAdam, a top player of ice games at his school, was the first to have played at all levels in his school's ice games program. He started in the smallest team and moved up to the biggest team, the U-18 AAA Prep team, last year.\nA team of players from many parts of the country and even from far away places are part of a popular team. Benjamin has been chosen to be one of the leaders of the team for this year. \nEven with all the work of playing this sport, Benjamin always gets good grades and is part of the school's smart kids group.\n\"Benjamin is a leader in every way,\" says the team's coach. \"He is always looking for new ways to help others and create programs that offer great things. We are excited for a special kind of hockey to be part of our school now and in the future.\"\nA national hockey group is giving the special hockey tools for this first program. And Benjamin, through collecting money, will provide the things needed to buy these special hockey tools that will stay at the school. Benjamin also hopes to collect enough money to buy time on the ice for these athletes and community groups to really enjoy the game.\n\"I am thankful that this program could have a permanent place at our school,\" said a man who leads a national hockey program for people with disabilities. \"This kind of growth and attention will show people how important the sport is and the athletes, who have faced tough times, that they are just like all other players.\"\nThere's a big team called GA team. This team loves to play hockey and they're really good at it. Many of their players go on to play at the highest levels and they have a great reputation across the country. \n\nGA is also a school. It's a school for boys and girls. It's a special school where kids learn a lot and get ready for college. They even have a program for little kids starting at 18 months old. The school is in a place called GM city. If you want to learn more about the school, you can look it up.\n\nThere's another group called YC. They've been around since the late 20th century. They help kids and young people with physical disabilities play sports. They believe that everyone should be able to play and have fun. That's why they have lots of teen helpers who make sports easier and more fun for everyone. They really love hockey and many other sports. In a place called WE city and SH town, there's an organization called YC. YC organizes lots of fun activities related to art and sport for children. The best part? They don't charge any money for these activities or for the rides to the locations.\n\nIn another place, known as CO city, there's an organization that loves ice hockey. This organization is responsible for helping children learn about and play ice hockey. It even helps some of them become super good at it, like the players we see in big games on TV.\n\nThe organization focuses mainly on helping local ice hockey groups. It gives them a plan to follow so they can train players at different ages. It doesn't just focus on the young players though, it also has programs for older players and even players who might find playing a bit hard.\n\nThis ice hockey organization represents the sport in important meetings, even in international ones. It is in charge of creating and training teams for big games, like the world championships and games that you see on TV during winter. It also works with some big hockey organizations.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "9b572c80a9b8056ef4bc6d9b59232b9e5b6a0b34f8f9e88c5af210e90e1fd0ed"}
{"text": "The passage talks about a special type of powder used to make strong medicines. This powder is mostly made in CH country, and one of the main places it's made is HO city. \n\nHO city made so much of this powder that it became the main place where other countries in Asia got their powder from. But now, other countries in Asia are also making this powder. Countries like TH country, MY country, and MA country are now getting their powder from HO city.\n\nA big report in the late 20th century by some important world groups said that CH country makes the most of this special powder. The powder is made into a medicine called \"P\". \n\nBut the place that uses the most of this powder is CA country. They use lots and lots of it! \n\nThe US country also uses a lot of this powder, but it uses more than it brings into the country. They make a lot of the powder into strong medicines.\nA new report was done by a big group that works with traditional medicine in a far east country. The report says that this country is making the most PH in the world. PH is a key part in making medicine, and it's used a lot by medicine makers in the west. The biggest country in the west uses the most PH in the world. \n\nThis report also says that this far east country is making more than 1 million big boxes of PH every year. This means that PH is the second biggest medicine in the world, after the biggest country in the west. \n\nPeople who know a lot about this say that more than half of the PH that this far east country uses comes from the biggest country in the west. The biggest country in the west buys the most PH powder. \n\nIn a year not too long ago, the far east country decided that they would only make 1.1 million big boxes of PH. This means that they can make more than two times what they make right now. In a year a little after that, they brought in about 200,000 big boxes because of this rule. \n\nWhat's even more surprising is that the far east country seems to have been able to get a lot of PH in some parts of the country just by clearing land, which is not very good for the earth. \n\nMaking medicine can be done in many different ways in this far east country.\nA company called SL decided to stop making a certain medicine in the past because it was not good for people's health. They kept selling it as a medicine to help people lose weight, but it was no longer called a \"weight loss\" medicine.\n\nSome medicines, like the ones athletes use to get stronger or the ones given to pregnant women, can cause problems. They can make babies sick when they are born, and some people think they might make children act differently. These medicines also have side effects like making people feel sick, hurting their heart, and causing problems with their kidneys and lungs.\n\nIn the early years of the 21st century, scientists found new ways to make medicines that work like a hormone in our body called testosterone. This discovery could help people not to rely too much on testosterone. One of these new medicines is ND, and another one is called SP, which stops certain reactions in the body. You can find these substances in many everyday items, like pills to prevent pregnancy, devices that are put in the body to prevent pregnancy, and even in some lotions that people use to get a tan.\n\nOver time, more and more problems have been found with these products. In the past, some research showed that a certain medicine could make people more likely to get sick. A report from a long time ago said that this medicine, which you put into your body with a needle, might make people's hearts and blood not work right. They also found out that if you mix this medicine with other ones, it could make you really sick, especially in your kidneys and for girls, in their tummies.\n\nThese medicines, called strong medicines, are used a lot now to help people feel better. But, sometimes, they can make people feel bad too. Some people might think they are worse or better than they really are. And sometimes, they can make you sick. Using these strong medicines is tricky, and doctors don't always agree on how to use them. This can make people worry. But remember, this is a big topic and there's a lot more to learn. If you want to know more, you can ask your doctor or someone who knows about health.\n\nThere's another strong medicine called Dianabol that can make you stronger, but it can also make you feel bad. Some people might feel different when they take a certain kind of medicine. These feelings may go away after some time, or they can be fixed by changing how much medicine they take. But sometimes, these feelings don't go away. \n\nOne medicine can make some people's bodies change. They might notice they are getting bigger because they are eating more food or not moving around as much as they should. This medicine can also make you grow taller. But after a while, you won't get any bigger and you'll look healthier. This medicine can also make a kind of hormone in your body that helps you grow. This hormone is usually made by small things called bacteria. But taking this medicine can also make other things happen in your body that you should know about before you start taking it. \n\nAnother thing that can happen is that boys who take this medicine may notice changes. Because this medicine is usually taken to help you get bigger muscles, it can also change how you look. Most boys will keep growing and will look normal. Some boys will notice that they are getting much bigger and longer. It can take a long time for boys to notice these changes. You might get tired of hearing about it, but it's important to know. Sometimes, people may stop using a special kind of muscle growing medicine because it can have lasting, bad effects. These effects might change the way your skin and hair look. Even though this medicine isn't very good for our bodies, some people still use it to grow their muscles and make their hair grow when they are eating less food. I know a person who used this medicine and now has red and light brown hair all over. It doesn't surprise me how this bad effect shows up. I have friends who have very different results. When some people stop using the medicine, they get more hair or lighter hair. Some others get more chest hair or thicker eyebrows. They often say that after using the medicine, the hair gets much thicker. But in reality, it's thicker because all the hair is from the top of the head and not the front as some people might think. This is a story about a very special medicine. In the land of US, there was a group of scientists. They were studying two different versions of this special medicine. People had already said this medicine was the best option for helping the body become stronger. \n\nThe scientists were curious. They asked, \"Is this really the best medicine?\" So, they tested it to find out. They found that this special medicine could change the body in certain ways. It made some things grow and other things change.\n\nThere were many other places around the world that also made special medicines like this. But the scientists in US were very careful. If they saw something bad happening, they would stop using the medicine and take care of the problem.\n\nIn another place, called SP Land, people were also talking about the special medicine. They said it could make people stronger and faster. Even the fastest and strongest people in the world were using it. But the scientists in US weren't sure if this was a good thing or not.\n\nSo, they kept studying and learning more about this special medicine. They wanted to make sure it was safe and good for everyone. And that's how they spent their days, exploring and discovering new things about this special medicine.

{"text": "In this story, we learn about Benjamin who is trying to understand why everyone had to stay home for a long time. Benjamin used to live in a busy city, but he moved to a quieter place in the middle of the country. He was very curious about why everyone had to stay home and not go to school or play with friends. \n\nHe met a friend named Henry who makes movies. Henry was making a movie about why we all had to stay home. In his movie, Henry talks about how some people didn't want others to know everything about why we had to stay home. They were trying to control what people thought and felt. \n\nBut Benjamin and Henry want everyone to know the truth. They think it's important for everyone to think for themselves and not just do what they are told. They believe that the more people know, the less they can be controlled.\nDon't forget to listen to this important episode of The Benjamin Show, where we reveal the truth about the lockdowns during the big sickness! \n\nBenjamin 0:10\nDid we listen to the experts? Or did the lockdowns become a big topic? Let's discuss that. Instead of trying to win arguments, we're learning the basics of talking and sharing ideas, and how we can use these skills to understand the world better. Welcome to The Benjamin Show. Hi there, friends, Benjamin here on The Benjamin Show. And thank you for joining us for our top episode. As always, I'm your friendly host. Joining me in our special studio, we're talking about how to keep your business safe from bad internet things. Want to learn more? Check out The Benjamin Show website. \n\nBenjamin, why are you in the IN state? Weren't you in the PE city before? Yes, I was in the PE city for a long time, but when the big sickness hit our country, and new rules were made by the people in charge, I decided to move. Like many others, I left the big city because of the lockdowns, which some people say never happened. This is about why I moved to a new place. Something really big happened. Yes, it became very popular. I was working on a very cool project. I also helped them with their publicity. Now, we are ready to share our work with everyone. If you are interested, we will start sharing more about it in February. Now, let's welcome a friend from the Creative Group. His name is Henry. Thanks for coming, Henry.\n\nHenry 2:02\nIt's good to be here. Thank you for having me.\n\nYou're welcome, Henry. Thank you for joining us. You have been working very hard on this very important project. It's about following the science and lockdowns becoming popular. But before we talk about that, can you tell us a little bit more about yourself and the Creative Group?\n\nSure, my name is Henry. I've been making movies for all my life. I lived in CA state for many years. Like you, I moved to a new place in the beginning of last year. I was born in NH state. Like many clever people, I went back to NE city. There are a lot of wonderful people in NE city now. So, I'm back on the East Coast. A friend who also makes films called me when I was a bit older. He was worried about the things happening around us. We saw things change from trying to slow down the sickness to trying to stop it completely. This didn't make sense to us. Our thinking and our feelings as artists told us something was wrong. We wanted to make a film about it. At first, we thought about making a one-time film, but then we decided to make a five-part series. We've finished the first part, but we also knew we had to be careful because of how people might react. So, we started a group where we didn't use our real names, called the sound mind creative group. I'm one of the people who started the group, and it has grown to include many skilled professionals. We've been working hard, and I was chosen to be the director. I used to write for TV shows and then started making films about real things. At one point, I realized that I needed to be open about who I was to lead this big project. I have always worked on projects that encourage people to speak up. I never thought this would make me less liked by the big movie makers, but I had already decided to be true to myself. So, I decided to be open about who I am. We have a great team and we have been working really hard on this project. \n\nWe didn't just want to make a simple film. We wanted to make something that would last, something that is fun to watch, with interesting people and a great story. We also wanted to include some knowledgeable people talking about technology. So, we have this really great project that we are excited about. We decided to call it \"Follow the Signs\". \n\nIn the first part, we focus on how it all started, from the beginning of the year 2020 until the spring. A group of people had an idea about a sickness that seemed scary. They thought everyone should stay home to keep the sickness from spreading. This idea caused a lot of changes. The group never had a chance to discuss these changes again. This group, called the \"Sound Mind Creative Group\", created a special project about this. They were very excited because they were going to show a preview of their project on a special day. They invited people who helped with the project and new people to join them. They lived, ate, and breathed this project. It felt like they were stuck in the past year because they kept talking about it. They talked to 20 people for their project. One important person they talked to was a scientist who is getting more and more attention. So, you might be wondering what I've been doing. Well, my job of making movies had to change a lot, like everyone else's job, because of the big sickness that made everyone stay home. This made everyone have to think about how they do their job. \nAnd that's why what we are doing here is so important. We started a new short series, because on Monday, we spoke to a lady from a famous cake shop in an OR state. She told us how the rules for the big sickness affected her shop. She decided to say no and fight against the rules. But not every shop owner could do that. Some didn't have the strength to fight back. Can you blame them? It was hard, especially in places where most people agreed with the rules. It was hard to ask questions like, \"why do we have to wear masks outside?\" especially when your friends and neighbors looked at you in a strange way for asking. We were outside, enjoying our drinks. It was confusing for me. I wasn't a naughty person, but I realized that many people were scared to ask questions. This fear had a big impact on many people's lives. Now, let's talk about the past year. We will discuss the start of this big event and what I found out. It was surprising to learn new things that I didn't understand before, even when I was part of it. \n\nThat's an interesting question. It was very strange to see everyone around us start to worry. It was scary to see how people stopped thinking clearly. They just repeated what they heard from others, even if it didn't make sense or if it was different from before. Once upon a time, people didn't rely on the opinions of the crowd. But now, things have changed. Yes, things do matter. There was a big machine and people started to talk about it. They couldn't decide if it was important or not. They talked again and again. This is a big question. We have some smart friends to help us understand. We have our friend Adam and our friend David. David used to work at a famous school and he writes for a big newspaper in NE city. We tried to invite lots of different smart friends to help us understand. We wanted to know what was happening. Asking questions is fun. It's what makes us curious. But sometimes, if you ask too many questions, people think you are causing trouble. But I think asking questions is good. I like when people express themselves. I think it's important to be curious, because that's what makes us human. Even smart people like Adam are saying that things aren't going as they should. Why is that happening? Why don't we think about our rules again? The answers he got from the rule makers surprised him. Also, the people who work in the news were quick to question others, which was a big surprise. There were people everywhere who just wanted to follow the rules. They wanted to do their best for everyone around them. This meant they followed whatever the big topic was that day. Let's think about the time when everyone was talking about breathing machines. Do you remember that? There were two leaders, let's call them Cameron and David. Cameron had extra machines and offered to give some to David. Then, a man we'll call Ethan said he would change his work to make more machines. This talk lasted for a few weeks, and then it stopped. Nobody talked about it anymore. This happened with most topics. As soon as it was not useful for getting people to follow the rules, it was left out of the story. Let's say, there was a time when people felt left out if they were curious about certain things. Life started to get more challenging for these people. Their jobs became more difficult. Then, a very important health solution came along, but we will talk about it later. \n\nAt the beginning, many people had a tough time because they were not making enough money. One such person is Alice, who used to run a popular place in LA city called Pineapple Express Saloon. She made a video about her problems, and it got really popular.\n\nThen, there was another problem - health care. It seemed like all doctors and hospitals were only focused on one big health problem, and other health issues were not getting attention. This is causing more and more problems that could have been avoided if people got the usual health care.\n\nAnd then, it got really bad for the little ones. So many of them were feeling sad and lost, and some even got into bad habits. They had a hard time learning and many couldn't get enough food. This is something that Jack talks about a lot. \n\nWe want to talk about this because there were people who noticed these problems. They had good reasons and strong feelings that something was not right. Once, there was a boy named Brian who had a chat with his friend Robert. They talked about a big sickness that was making a lot of people feel unwell. Brian remembered a day in the middle of April when he had a talk with a smart man named Daniel. They wondered if having a lot of businesses close could make more people feel unwell than the big sickness itself.\n\nBrian was surprised when some of his friends got upset with him for having this talk. They asked him why he was not listening to the smart people who knew a lot about the big sickness. But Brian believed that it was important to ask questions and not just believe everything he was told.\n\nBrian and Robert also talked about a man named Jay who was a leader in the group of smart people. Jay and some other smart people had different ideas about how to make everyone feel better. But some people did not like these different ideas and tried to ignore them.\n\nBrian and Robert knew that it was not nice to ignore people just because their ideas were different. They had seen it happen and knew it was not fair. They wished everyone could listen to each other's ideas about how to make the big sickness go away. A person did something that made me a little scared. I noticed that some people I thought were logical could quickly change if they got scared enough by someone on TV.\nHenry talked next. He said, \"Yes, I think we can't ignore how much a few things have changed us. The internet, which we've used a lot in the last 20 years, and our smartphones have changed the way we think. We're not sure what it's done, but it's definitely changed us. If we don't use our thinking skills, we might lose them. Like with maps, nobody knows how to read them or understand them. They don't understand that a map is a picture of where I want to go. And I need to use that picture to help me move from one place to another.\" There was a way to travel - going left, right, or straight ahead. You could hop into a car and it could take you anywhere you wanted to go - just like magic! This is something we can see on TV and the internet. That's how we know what's happening around us. \n\nI have been involved in many projects, one of which aimed to change some rules about a certain plant. I also believe that we should talk more about this plant that is now found all over our country. There are some things we need to be careful about, especially if we use it a lot. \n\nI think many people believe things without asking questions or noticing things that don't make sense. Even when things change or go wrong, they still go along with it because they are scared. Adam worked a lot with people who thought differently than most. He made films about them and even thought of himself as one of them. These people are not afraid to share their ideas, even when others try to quiet them down. Some leaders of countries are afraid of these people because they don't like different ideas. They try to scare people so they will stop thinking for themselves and just do what they're told. Adam noticed this happening a lot. \n\nOne day, Adam heard about a sickness that sounded scary. But he noticed something more. He saw that this was a chance to change how people think and act. Adam is hopeful though. He believes that a lot of people are starting to see what's really going on. They're joining the movement to think freely and be themselves. Some people in our group really know who they are. But in places all over the world, there are people who don't know about our group or our ideas. They see what's happening and it doesn't make sense to them. This is when they start to question things. They start to realize that things don't make sense. This is when they start to think for themselves. I think and hope that a big change is coming. I think that the bad people in charge will be stopped. And then we will have a time of peace, happiness, learning and new things. This is how I think about the world. But we need a good story. We need to show what really happened. So, we made this show. This first episode is about science and being free. It was very popular. \n\nThere was a man who used to act in the big city. He had to leave because he didn't agree with what was happening. There is a curious boy named Clifton, who always wants to understand how things work. He has a friend named Nathan who helps him find out answers to his questions. Together, they learn and discover new things, and we get to join their fun journey of learning. \n\nSometimes, Clifton and Nathan show their discoveries to other people. These people don't just watch, they also start to remember their own journeys of finding out new things. They remember their thoughts, their questions, and the discoveries they made. They realize that they had a lot to share but were too shy to do so before. This project is about bringing an important talk to the front. We should have had this talk when certain things happened. Why they happened and why they didn't have to happen the way they did. \n\nThere's a big show happening soon. There's also a special early show on a special day for some people who gave us help. If others want to be part of the big show later, how can they do that?\n\nWell, if you go to a special web page, we're doing something nice. We're having an early show and we'd be happy if people could join. We just ask for a little help to get in. And I think we're going to have a special guest. We are still talking about this, but we will probably have a special person to show it. They might also give a free month of something special. But we're really looking forward to showing it and letting people tell us what they think. We want to use it as a chance to make things better. We're happy that people might see and connect with this. Will it show what they believe? What else do they want to see? We're also gathering money to finish the project. It was a big project, we aimed high. We've gathered a lot of money, but we need a little more to finish it properly. We're really looking forward to our first show in FL country with our friend 'Tom'. We'll have this show in a city called 'Orlando' on a special day in the second month. But there's a little preview on an earlier day in the same month at a website called 'followthescienceseries.com'. We'd love for people to join, be part of the crowd, join the talk, give us their thoughts to make the project better and stand up against unfairness.\n\nAnd I care about this a lot because I've worked with you all and because I live this. I think a lot of people listening might agree and say, yes, I've heard that too. Yes, I've had questions too. And you weren't allowed to ask the questions. If you did, maybe you were pushed away or ignored. So, it's important for us to be able to talk about these things. Our friend, Cameron, and we talked about the important job of writing down what happens now. This is because if we don't do it right, the people who know a lot will try to change the story. They will say they did their best and followed the science. But we are going to show how they didn't listen to the real science and didn't let others talk about it. Sometimes, they even stopped people from talking about it using rules. This is something that many people don't notice. But, we can't talk about this now because we don't have much time. So, we already told you what you can do. But what if you want to talk more with Cameron? Where can you find him? And where can you help the great team called SM group as they try to get more money for their work?\n\nWell, you can go to the website called SS.com. There, you will find a page where you can give some money. We really need it. We worked hard for this. We've worked hard on this. It has funny parts and great cartoon animations. We want to make something that kids, grown-ups, and people who like to learn about the world will enjoy over and over. Please come and watch our sneak peek and think about giving some support. We're grateful for your help.\n\nThank you, Hawk, for being here. And thank you all for being with us. If you've been with us this long, you must really care. If you do, share this episode. You might have a friend who cares just as much or even more. They might share it too, and who knows, we might reach millions of people who want to understand the real science of what's been happening these past few years.

He asked everyone to listen to this story from a woman named Jessica, who owned a business during this time. He also said, most people listen to his stories using sound, but they can also watch them on video. He asked everyone to sign up so they wouldn't miss any of his stories. Then, he said goodbye until the next day.\n\nAdam is a man who does lots of things. He's been making movies in LA city for over 20 years. He's won prizes for his work and he's done lots of different jobs like writing, teaching and helping people. He's made movies about people's rights and freedom. He started out doing jobs in businesses that make commercials and music videos. A man named Henry worked in many movie jobs in the early part of this century. He helped with different tasks on movie sets and even helped find places to film. He also got to help the movie director a couple of times.\n\nThen, Henry began working on bigger movies and TV shows. He helped the director again, worked on special effects, and even helped in a room full of writers.\n\nAs he kept working, Henry also started writing stories for movies with a friend. His stories were so good that a big movie company bought one, and he even won a prize for a funny story he wrote. In 2006, he decided to write stories all the time.\n\nBut Henry wanted his stories to be about important things, so he started making real-life stories into movies. He made many short movies about people fighting for their rights, and even won another award.\n\nIn 2012, Henry started his own movie company called \"SM\". With his company, he worked on a lot of projects for different groups. Some of the groups were about helping people, learning about people's rights, and remembering people who had been hurt by bad leaders. In a past year, Henry made and helped produce his first big movie, a film about brave soldiers, made by FM company. It got many awards and lots of people liked it. It was shown to a very big crowd, the biggest crowd ever for a movie!\n\nNEW PROJECTS\n\nHenry works with a group called VOC and he makes short movies that tell about brave people who stood up to bad leaders. These short movies have won awards.\n\nHenry also works with MPI to run a special class every year called The Mindful Editor. This class is now in its sixth year. It teaches movie makers how to stay calm and not get too tired. Some companies like DaVinci Resolve, Runway, and The Post Group have helped support this class.\n\nIn a recent year, Henry started his own company to keep making movies and music videos. He directed and helped produce a music video called Drive Through Fire for a band. Before that, he edited and helped produce a music video called Tornado for the same band.\n\nHenry also helped with a big movie about a man named Michael Brown. This movie had Shelby Steele in it and was directed by Eli Steele.\n\nHenry got some money from the Atlas Network to start working on a podcast called Chances Are. This podcast talks about making the justice system better.\nHenry and his friends made a group in 2021 named \"Sound and Mind Group\". They started making a new video series named \"Learning about Science: Staying Safe at Home\". Henry was the one who was leading. Henry, whose full name is Henry Adam, learned a lot about how countries work together and also a bit about the language spoken in GR country, while he was studying in a big school in CO city. They also learned about being free to talk and about science.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "9ca99cba3200664682c8ca37f0c579325376fc1286191a634299a535f4f1d0f7"}
{"text": "A big car-making company in the CA country and the people in charge made a promise. They said they would make fewer things that harm our air from their cars. They want to make 10 million fewer of these bad things between the years 2007 and 2010 and 5.3 million fewer in 2010. If they do this right, it will be like what was done first in the CA state's Clean Car Rule.\n\nThe big car-making group in CA country said, to do this, they have a big plan that will:\n* Make and tell people about many kinds of cars that don't need much fuel. These cars will have things like hybrid engines, cylinders that can turn off, really good diesel technology, and other new things.\n* Make cars better without making it less safe for people inside.\n* Use technologies that help save fuel like things that can tell you what's wrong with the car and systems that can check if your tires have enough air.\n* Help people in CA country know what they can do to make fewer bad things for the air. They will help people make good choices about buying, taking care of, and driving cars and small trucks all over CA country.\n* Say it's good to use different kinds of fuels like ethanol, clean diesel and bio diesel and will work with the people in charge and those who give us fuel in this.\n* Work with the people in charge to help research in CA country about new technologies that can make fewer bad things for the air after 2010. These new things might be like cells that use hydrogen fuel, places to get hydrogen in CA country, and other new things.\n\"An important agreement has been made that will help reduce the earth's warming in the CA country. This will also help other places like the US country make similar changes,\" said David, who works for a group that cares about our earth's health. \n\nRight now, the NE city and seven other places in the east have made or are making laws to have cleaner cars. Now that CA country is also doing this, one-third of the car sellers in North AM city will have to follow these tougher rules. \n\nThis new agreement will be watched closely by many groups in the US country. A group of car makers is trying to stop these new clean car rules. But they've also promised CA country that they will reduce the earth's warming. The car makers in the US country can no longer say they won't take action, says the earth-caring group.\n\nYou can read more about this agreement on a webpage. This story was first told in an earlier time in a book about protecting the environment.\n\nOther stories talk about more costs for running power plants in 2019, stopping oil pollution in the NE state, a group meeting about storage in Texas, a plan to clean more groundwater at a NJ site, and a legal case in Tennessee about coal waste ponds.\nA girl named Mary becomes the leader of the nature team in the IA park. The leader of the MD country makes a new rule about using energy the right way. There's talk about things that can hurt us if not thrown away properly. There's also talk about how we should handle these things. We learn about animals, plants, and their homes. A company called DY had to fix some problems at their OR place because they weren't following the rules. We hear about things that can be harmful to us. There's also talk about air that can make us sick. We learn about problems in big factories. We also learn how to make things safe again.

{"text": "A girl named Charlotte wrote about how hard it is to make movies. She said, it's like trying to tell a story with pictures, and it's important to think about what the characters are feeling. Charlotte moved to a new city to learn more about making movies at a special school. They make different kinds of movies there, and she wanted to learn about all of them. She said, a movie is like a story that is told three times. First, someone writes it, then someone else decides how to show it, and finally, someone else decides what parts to keep and what parts to take out. This is a good thing because it helps the story become something everyone can understand. When you write a story, you use what you know and feel. When we have a picture or a movie in our mind, it's not always easy to make it just like that in real life. It's like trying to change one thing into another thing. Sometimes, we lose a bit of the thing we started with, like when we try to make a toy car move, but some of the push we give it turns into heat instead. A man named Benjamin said he can only make his movies look 60% like the picture in his head. That's pretty good!\n\nSometimes, when you're telling a story, there are parts of it that are really important to you. They mean something special to you and you think about them a lot. But, it can be really sad when those parts don't end up in the final movie. It's like people didn't understand what you wanted. So, you have to make sure the parts that are important to you stay in the movie.\n\nFor example, I once had a big disagreement with a writer. He was upset because I wanted to change the color of a car in our movie. When I asked him why, he said the car had to be black because it was like a scary ghost. But, there were no other parts in the story that talked about scary ghosts or anything like that, so his idea didn't make sense to anyone else.\nThis is a great lesson for me, not only as a storyteller, but also as a guide. It reminds me that not everyone understands symbols the same way. Even something as big as the idea of saying goodbye can mean different things to different people. This depends on their life, where they come from, and what they believe in. We can't always think that others will understand our story the same way we do.\n\nAdam often talks about the role of pretending in two types of thinking. In one type, Adam says, pretending is like putting on a mask for a special role. The mask can be changed or taken off, but the person under the mask stays the same. In another type, the person is seen as always changing, so the pretending mask is seen as the real thing.\n\nThis shows how different groups see things differently. If we want everyone in the world to enjoy our story (which we should), it reminds us that we can't think that everyone will understand symbols the same way we do.\n\nSo, how do you avoid this problem? I believe that as soon as you start using your own symbols in your story, it won't make sense to others. Your characters see the story through their own eyes and their own symbols, and the audience should see the story the same way.\nTelling a story in a way that the characters see it helps to weave in special symbols as part of the tale. This makes the story and its special symbols closely linked, just like how all parts of a movie come together to form a whole. To put it simply, the story should be seen from the character's point of view, not from your own.\n-Nathan\nNathan is a student who sometimes writes and directs.\n\nDon't ever leave your car.\nStory comes from Characters (Rituals come from Tribe)\n\nA person named Nora commented:\nIt's funny, you've explained movie-making really well. I think that if a character doesn't feel real, then there's no story. And I have quite a story about that!

{"text": "There was a time when people in AM city used different kinds of coins. Some coins were shiny like gold and silver, but some were not. People from a place called BR country used to pay Americans with copper coins, not the shiny ones. Because of some rules, these copper coins became very valuable, even more than what they really were!\n\nPeople in AM city had to use the very shiny coins if they wanted to buy something from BR country. This wasn't fair, and it was one of the reasons why people in AM city decided to stand up for themselves.\n\nThe coins that the government made were always worth more than the metal they were made of. This helped the government make some profit. Look at the small coin we call a penny. It used to be heavier and made of copper, but not anymore. Now, it's made of a different metal called zinc and only looks like copper on the outside. Long ago, the cost of a special metal called copper became more than what people used it for. This made it hard for the people of CA country to keep making their smallest coins. So they decided to stop making these coins.\n\nIn very old times, even before there were cars and computers, the rulers of a big city owned all the mines. They used the metals from the mines to make their money. Most of their money was made this way. The rulers decided how much the coins were worth, and they always made sure the coins were worth more than the metal they were made from. This happened everywhere, no matter where you looked.\n\nA long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, people decided to fix the price of another special metal called gold. But they forgot to increase the price when they made more money, and this caused a big problem. This is similar to what happened with the small coins in CA country and with the silver coins in the old city.\n\nSo, anyone who says that only money made from paper is controlled by the rulers doesn't know much about how money works. All money, whether it's made from metal or paper, is controlled by the rulers. Even when a country tried to fix the value of their money at a high rate, it caused problems.\n\nThe only way to stop this control is to let the value of the money change on its own. This means that as long as the value of the \"paper\" dollar changes on its own on world markets, it's not actually controlled by the rulers any more than digital money like Bitcoin. Money is something we use to buy things. Long time ago, there was a rule that said how much a dollar was worth. It was like saying a dollar was the same as a small piece of gold. But now, that rule is gone, and a dollar's worth can change. \n\nSome people get confused and think that just because a dollar's worth can change, it's not real money. But that's not true. Money's worth changing is normal. It's like how the price of toys or candy can change. So even if a dollar's worth changes, it's still real money.\n\nThere are some people who wish that money's worth would never change. They wish that a dollar could always buy the same amount of toys or candy. But that's not how things work, and it's never been that way. \n\nSo, when you hear people say that money isn't real because its worth can change, remember that it's not true. Money is still real, and its worth can change just like the price of toys or candy.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "988c07ff831e1383427ff3962c732f8682a9abb65a44a7dbf8022e41f70b0ddd"}

{"text": "Fiona said, \"A minister will come with advisors\"\nFiona had many questions. Can Adam change the banks? Does the SA country need big airports? What if you're in the middle? Is there a long shadow over Patrick's new morning?\nFrank, the big bank boss, was once the head of the money department. He was a good worker, just like the super-worker talked about in the big plan for a better SA country.\nOn a day in the middle of the week, he showed why he is the perfect worker. He spoke at a big meeting about the problems in the government. He was very careful, followed the rules, and even made people laugh.\nMany times during his talk, he made people laugh with his calm way and funny jokes. He lightened the mood while sharing shocking stories about the troubles in the money department.\nA man, let's call him Adam, was sharing about all the things he knew and how he was learning to become a farmer. He talked about a confusing time when his boss, let's call him Nathan, was suddenly asked to leave his job. This happened on a winter day. Nathan sent a message to Adam saying, \"I have to go.\"\n\nThere was another man, let's call him Ethan. Ethan called Adam and told him, \"Now you will have a new boss who will have helpers.\" Ethan told Adam these helpers might be from a faraway land and they would be the ones really in charge.\n\nAdam didn't understand fully what Ethan meant. He was very surprised and confused.\n\nThe next day, when Adam went to work very early, he saw Nathan packing up his stuff in his office. Some friends were coming and going from the room. I can clearly remember that one friend, let's call him Mr. Nathan, stopped and spoke to us. He told us we should keep doing our work because the country needed a strong team. From that moment, a friend, let's call him 'Frank', did his work and showed himself to be a good helper, even when some others tried to take over the team. Even though another friend, we'll call him 'Victor', was coming and going quickly, it was clear what he was supposed to do. He came with a helper. \"When I got to the place, the first person I saw was a person who said his name was 'Mr. Bob'. He said he was 'Victor's helper'.\" Frank was surprised and his surprise showed that he liked to follow rules. \"As the head of the team, I had not given 'Mr. Bob' the job he said he had,\" said Frank. He also didn't like it when 'Victor' tried to bring in another helper, 'Mr. Matthew', especially when 'Victor' told Frank that 'Mr. Matthew' didn't need to be paid because he already had a job at another place.\nBenjamin, Matthew, and another friend, Isaac, we now understand, came directly from a big group to become helpers for a man named Victor, with the goal of giving important money tasks to firms connected to this big group. \n\nHenry shared in his story that Victor didn't even know his helpers well, as they only shared their contact information at the big money house; Victor also mixed up the titles and names of his new officials, showing that he didn't pick them.\n\n\"I was surprised that a man who was picked to become a big boss about a day ago, in the night, already had 'a helper'. In all my years working in the big house (about twenty years) I had never seen such quickness in picking a helper...Benjamin didn't worry about proper manners at all,\" Henry said.\n\nWhen Victor spoke to everyone for the first time as the Money Boss, Henry shares that he felt \"worried\" as the new boss didn't talk about money rules, buying big machines, or the problems with money for schools, all big problems at that time.\n\nAs a very smart person, he quickly understood that Victor didn't know about his job.\n\nHenry said that in his first public words, Victor talked about \"making the big money house easier to understand or opening it to the people, including in the countryside\" instead of trying to calm the people and the money markets.\nVictor was only the leader for two short days, but during that time, things didn't go well. So, Patrick came back to be the leader again on the next Monday after Victor was chosen. \n\nFrank is one of many helpers who started working when everyone was allowed to vote, and they are all very smart. The words of Patrick and Frank this week showed that they wouldn't let anyone break the rules, just like Frank didn't when he met a new helper during the weekend.\n\nThis week, Patrick told everyone how they stopped a plan that would have cost too much money, and also stopped the wastefulness during the time when the big leader was Jack.\n\nThere's more to learn about: Patrick, Fiona, Raymond, the helpers, Lungisa, Victor, and the big meeting. Fiona: 5 things businesses can learn from Jack's big meeting.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "dc4d8778d03364b1848d9c04264d4fc46ee00f7cd436903253e89903758218a0"}

He was interviewed as part of a special series about books. \n\nAnother man named Peter was there too. He works for a big TV station. Adam is a teacher at a big school of law.\n\nThey also talked about other things. They spoke about what it means to be a slave, about people who live in a city, about a sad event in our country's history, and about people who work in banks.\n\nA lady named Joan, who teaches history, also talked about her book. It's about a big fight that happened a long time ago. David talked about his book about changing how we think about skin color.

{"text": "This is a story about a funny and kind lady named Jessica. She had a tough time when she was a little girl, but she used those hard times to help her do well in her job today.\n\nJessica is not only funny, but she also makes movies and TV shows. She even owns two places where people can go to laugh and enjoy comedy shows. All of this is because of the hard times she had as a child.\n\nWhen Jessica was born, people were not happy because they wanted a boy. This made her feel sad. But as she grew up, she knew she had to work hard, stay healthy, and show everyone how good she can be. This made her stand out and be successful. Jessica chose to make people giggle and feel happy when she was 17! She discovered a new way to see herself when she went to a big school in a place called the KE state. Jessica said, \"In my home country, having dark skin and big lips is not liked. But in this new place, people liked how I looked. I realized that I could decide what kind of life I wanted to have!\" \n\nJessica created different funny characters that made people laugh a lot. One of her characters, 'Annoying Anna', is described by Jessica as not nice and silly. I wondered why this character was so important to her.\n\nJessica said, \"You can find people like Anna everywhere. People might think they are from one place, so I made Anna from a different place to show that it's not only people from one place who can be mean. My mom tells me to stop eating because I'll get big. She thinks if you are bigger than a thin stick, you are big! My mom is my hero because she took care of me!\"\nJessica wanted to share different thoughts with people, but in a way that makes them laugh, not worry. Many people don't feel good about themselves because of how they grew up. Jessica's jokes are quite bold, but she thinks it's important to be brave about our troubles. We should talk about them, and that's better for everyone. If we're feeling sad or if we remember something bad from when we were little, it can always hurt us! Going to a helper, like a counselor, can be a great support.\n\nMaking a path\n\nClearly, Jessica has decided to use her tough times in a helpful way! She's turned them into something that everyone else can understand and learn from.\n\nHer bravery to stand up for herself and chase her dream is a guide for others. She shared how being told \"no\" a lot when she was little helped her to keep going as a grown-up.\n\nJessica: \"As a woman from the CH country, I found it tough to get on stage because people who run joke clubs don't think women are funny. I knew they were wrong, so I started my own joke clubs!\n\nWorking in shows is tough, I'm not just a joker, but I have to be like a boss lady. I have to be brave to sell tickets because we can't put a great joker on stage if no one buys the tickets. I want to help people do their best and show them off when they're ready. I know they are funny, but some of them need to practice more.\" I know now why it was tough for me to step on a stage at first! I used to believe that people who ran the clubs were not nice, but most of them were just looking after their good name. I want to help more funny girls share their jokes with everyone.\n\nTurning tough times into something good\nJessica's strength is something to look up to; lots of the best people I know who start their own things are this strong and keep going no matter what gets in their way.\nMaybe you've had tough times when you were little, or have a great story that can help make your thing better?

{"text": "A group that gives out a big prize for people who help others and protect their rights has shared a list of people they might give the prize to this year:\n\nThere is a man from CH country called Isaac. He is very smart and has been trying to help two groups of people in his country understand each other better for more than 20 years. But in a month called September in 2014, he was sent to live in a place where people who break rules have to go for the rest of his life.\n\nThen, there is Benjamin from TA country. He is a lawyer who helps people who get in trouble because they think differently or want to change things. He has been doing this for nearly 20 years. Benjamin has said many times that the people who make the rules in his country do not treat others fairly. Because of this, he has been in the place where people who break rules go since 2015. \n\nThere is also a group called Youth Group for People's Rights (YGPR). They started in 2003. They try to help young people from different places and groups in the BA region become friends. This way, these young people can work together to make sure everyone's rights are protected and that the fights that hurt many people in the past do not happen again.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "59acbd0a6914e461d618f371cae9e9ead4f64ab5c187a1c37c14ea9364d0784a"}
{"text": "A short while ago, a lot of posts about the same report from a big group were all over my friend-sharing site. The report talked about how our planet is in danger and many types of animals could disappear forever. \n\nNews Headline: Our Planet is in Big Trouble\nLots of animals could go away forever\n\nAnother big report came out in late 2018 and was talked about all over the world. This report was about how the Earth is getting hotter and how that's really bad for people.\n\nBut to me, this new report is even sadder.\n\nThis new report says that our Earth is getting worse faster than ever before. We're losing so many animals and plants, and that's really bad for everyone. Our planet is getting sicker and sicker, and that's bad for our jobs, our food, our health, and our lives.\n\nBut the report also says that we can still help our planet, but we have to start right now and everyone has to help, from our neighborhoods to the whole wide world. If we make big changes, we can still save our nature, and that's also really important for everything else we want to achieve.\nOur planet is in danger. Lots of animals and plants are at risk of disappearing forever. A big report says that wild animals have lost 82% of their homes and half of the world's plants and animals could disappear. Lots of bugs are disappearing too. This is very worrying.\n\nSo, what can we do? We need to work together to protect our planet and all the wonderful creatures that live here.\n\nA doctor named Victor spoke at a big meeting called the Soil Not Oil International Conference. He cares very much about our planet and doesn't want to lose all the beautiful life on it.\n\nA photographer named Jack has made a special photo album. He has taken pictures of every kind of bird, frog, and animal he could find. His photos show us how important it is to protect all these creatures.\n\nA woman named Charlotte loves to write about and take pictures of nature. She even makes music about it. You can help her keep doing this by giving a small gift.\n\nRemember, it's important to take care of our planet. We all share it with so many wonderful creatures. Let's do our best to protect them!\nFor my sister Jessica | Animals Gathering at the Water Hole in AF Country\nToday, I made a new watercolor painting for my sister Jessica. I captured the journey of my painting by taking pictures at different times. I first made a small drawing based on 4 photos, then copied it onto my drawing pad.\nbeginning drawing based on several photos\nFor Jessica, Animals Gathering at the Water Hole in AF Country\nwhat the painting is based on\n1_long-necked animal, bird, big tree\nThis is about Animals, Art, Being Aware, Beauty, Being Creative, Watercolor Pencils, Happiness, and Nature. It has tags like AF Country, animals, ART, being creative, big animal, Watercolor Pencils, fun, long-necked animal, protecting where animals live, things you can do and see, life, Nature, painting, water, water hole\nA note to my sister | how special life is | Freedom through asking questions about the world | The Little Prince\nI was looking at my blog and saw someone read this, which I put up a few years ago. I decided to put it up again, because it's important. It talks about doing the right thing and being a leader - yes, I think, once upon a time, the two were part of the same thing. But wait, maybe doing the right thing and being a leader don't often go together, and it's rare when they do! I mean, when kings, bad leaders, and big companies are in charge, doing the right thing doesn't really matter to people who want to stay powerful, in control and make money.\nHello there,\nIt's so good to hear from you! Every time I step into the room, I see the beautiful paper lanterns you hung up for Mom's special day and the tent you made in the yard. I still need to clean up the leaves though! It's the little things we do and the stuff we leave behind that remind us of each other. Sometimes, we didn't talk so well, and I might have been too quick to get upset. But, I want to try to be kinder and understand better.\n\nAlice wrote a great book for kids and grown-ups called \"The Little Prince\". Alice used to fly planes! The Little Prince is a really special book. But, sometimes, even if someone says something clever, we might not like them if they're not nice!\n\nI spent some time with a friend from our family yesterday. After, I realized he knows just how special life is because he doesn't have his mom and dad anymore. If we could all remember that life is short, like in a story called \"The Wise Man's Lessons\", we would always be kind to everyone and every animal, all the time.\nLiving a life where every moment is precious might seem tough. But it's all about knowing that each moment is important. We all should let others be who they are and think how they want to think. Sometimes it can be hard to let go of feelings like wanting to win, being jealous, or judging others. But it's the best way for us all to get along. \n\nThere was a story about a writer named Carlos that wasn't very nice. But, his writings still had some good messages about life and spirit. \n\nIt can be a job that lasts your whole life to try not to judge others. It's something everyone does. We all have times when we are unhappy, expect too much, or get let down. And these feelings can even cause problems in our communities, and between different countries. \n\nOne of the biggest jobs for people is to try to understand each other, and be kind, even when we are different. When I see people not taking care of our world, it makes me upset. Especially when I hear about plans to dig for more gas in cold places. There was a man named Carl who spoke about understanding our world. He said that we have amazing tools and machines that can do extraordinary things. But, we still have trouble getting along with each other, even though we have all these wonderful tools. Carl also said that we should always ask questions about everything, especially from people who are in charge. This helps us from being easily fooled by others. He told a story about a wise man named Thomas who once said that people need to learn a lot so they can ask these questions. If we don't, then those in charge will be the ones controlling us, not the other way around. It's important to remember to always be kind, understanding, and loving to one another.\nA website talks about learning, talking and having fun. It also talks about cleaning up, reusing things, and planting new ones to help all creatures. The website also talks about a big meeting about how the weather is changing all over the world. In a place called IN country, a lot of people planted many trees in a short time. This shows that people everywhere could do something to help the environment. The website shows many words that are important to the website. \n\nAlice says she sits quietly every day and thinks about the earth, the wind, the water and a bright energy. She does this to help her feel calm and connected. She hopes to share her thoughts with others and to learn from them too. Alice believes that if you really want something, it can happen. She calls this magic. For the first time, Alice read information from a group she learned about when she was living in PE state. This group is made up of leaders from different faiths who talk about how the weather is changing all over the world. They all share their own thoughts on this. I found a helpful website about climate action. There's a big meeting about the Earth's climate in SF city during a week in September. Just before another big gathering.\n\nI think it's a great place to share my idea. I thought of this idea a while ago, just before a big climate meeting in PR city. I only had a little money when I went there for two weeks.\n\nI used to call my idea \"Eco Revolution,\" then \"EcoActivate,\" but I had to change it because someone else had already used the first name.\n\nMy idea is about giving information to people. We can use a computer and a moving unit that goes to places where people need help. Maybe they know they need help, or maybe they don't. Then, together, they can clean up, create energy that doesn't hurt the Earth, move in ways that are good for the Earth, and make gardens for the community. They can make paths for bees and butterflies, plant trees, and build bridges for animals.\nThe big idea is to get everyone together for a fun, hands-on experience. This will help them learn how to make their surroundings green and beautiful. Learning is the key and the people's energy is what makes it go.\n\nDon't forget, every living thing has feelings, not just people. We need to be kind and let other creatures live happily too. Love is not just for humans, but for every living thing on our planet.\nA scientist named Cameron talks about animals and people in a presentation. Listening to his words made me cry because I was sad about what people think is important. I was going to write a story about why people can't walk everywhere on Earth. But I think it's more important to talk about how we should care for all living things, not just people. We are hurting the world and other living things because there are too many of us, we are making the world dirty, making it too hot, and causing many animals to disappear. Cameron talks about this too. He says what we do to animals, we also do to each other.\nI wanted to share this story right away. I feel very sad for people who don't feel love and wonder for nature and all of life. My parents taught me to love all living things. We had magazines about the world and animals at home, and they made me think about more than just where we live.\n\nI want to thank my friends who always remind people to take care of animals and nature. This is tied to a new way of thinking where we see all living things as connected. We, as people, should think more about protecting all other living beings, instead of harming them and their homes without thinking about it. Some people think it's fun to hurt wolves, whales, and bulls. This is not good. We also need to stop eating so many cows, pigs, and chickens and using so much land to feed them. Some people think that eating certain special foods will keep them healthy, but this is not true. We should not treat animals badly or hurt them because of old traditions. Everyone needs to learn about this. We can start by talking to each other.\n\nWe all have a lot in common with other creatures, like our genes and the way our brains and bodies work. Maybe this will help us to feel more for them.\n\nA wise person once said that all life is closely connected.\nA man named Cameron, who knows a lot about nature and writes books, studied many different animals in their homes. He went with a group to see how the cold place at the top of the world and big boats catching fish were hurting the sea. \n\nDid you know, our brains are just like monkey brains, just bigger? And dolphin brains are even bigger than ours and have more wrinkles!\n\nCameron wondered, \"What do animals think and feel? I believe we can understand them. I have learned from studying whales, wolves, elephants, and birds that they think and feel like us, use tools and show feelings.\"\n\nBirds named albatrosses make homes on faraway islands. But their nests have lots of plastic, and young birds sometimes eat things like lighters and get sick. All types of albatrosses are in danger.\n\nWe like to put pictures of animals in baby's rooms. But now, all the animals that were safe on Noah's Ark are in danger. So, we shouldn't ask if animals love us, but rather, can we let other animals keep living?\nCameron says, \"From what I've seen, I think that nature and people need each other. When wild places are ruined, wild animals are gone, and the world is dirty, it is a big loss. For people living in such places, it is very hard to live a good life.\"\nA newspaper in the US country tells us that it is getting hotter each year and every year is hotter than the last one. \"Our report doesn't have information about the Arctic, but NASA's does,\" says a scientist. \"The Arctic is getting warmer faster than anywhere else.\"\n\"Everyone should know this,\" says Liam from the Animal Friends Club. \"The important thing is what we do about it. If we don't do anything, it will be very bad. The leaders in the US are not doing much. So, people in businesses, schools, cities, and states have to do something.\"\nElephants, like all other animals, become who they are.\nThis story is about animals, changes, talking, thinking, saving animals, being creative, learning, love, nature, science, and being kind to animals. It talks about many things like birds, chimpanzees, climate change, dolphins, earth, elephants, fish, global warming, love, nature, plastic, pollution, whales, and more.\nThis story is about a friend named Matthew, who was very sad and ended his life after his 22nd birthday. Matthew was from a family that had roots in many different countries. We all feel very sad about what happened to Matthew.\n\nWe held a special event for Matthew. He was a friend we sometimes saw at a place where people gather to listen to music. When he wasn't there, he would be busy working as a cook because he loved cooking so much.\n\nI once told Matthew that the way he dressed reminded me of workers in GE country who wear special clothes. They only walk from one place to another to learn their job. This is a very old tradition in GE country and some parts of FR country.\n\nThe last time I saw Matthew, I was surprised to see him carrying a real tool for protection. He told me it was okay to do that in our state. Not long after, I noticed a big group of people holding little lights in the center of town when the sun was setting.\nThere was a quiet gathering for a friend, Matthew. I wondered why everyone looked so sad. I moved closer and saw a picture. That's when I found out Matthew was very sad and hurt himself. He did this the day after his birthday. His family said that people shouldn't have dangerous things when they are upset, and they shouldn't be near dangerous things if they are not in a good mood. I read about this and felt it was something important to understand.\n\nHeidi Barr talked about being sad. She said there are many reasons why people can be sad. They can be upset about how people are treated, about hurting our planet, about being dishonest, or about feeling stuck. But she also talked about hope.\n\nShe said we don't need more anger or feeling helpless. We don't need to feel more bad about ourselves. But we do need to be sad for the things we've lost, the things we will never have, and the things that are going away right now. Samuel shares, \"When we feel very sad, we need to understand that it's okay to feel that way. We don't always need to be hopeful to keep going. Sometimes, it's our sadness that helps us move forward.\"\nMatthew's grandpa was a big boss at a nearby school, SJ. His other grandpa, who has Native AM country roots, was a super cook. He brought the family together with his cooking, and this is something Matthew loved to do as well.\nI think this shows something that's not right in our world.\nWe are all 'supposed' to be the same - who says - rules and regular reactions - to fit in. Like, in the jobs we have, the clothes we wear, the things we own, through the work we do, how we act, and even how we understand the world. It's like we're all following a big rule, that affects our daily habits, the 'weekend' fun, the time we get from our jobs to relax... if not - just keep quiet and don't ask questions. People from FR country, UA country...they ask questions. People in AM country are told what to think. A smart man named N said the news plays a big part in making everyone follow this big rule in his book. \"He said that the news in the U.S. helps make people think the same way, without forcing them, through advertising, what they believe, and what they don't say, and without anyone telling them what to do.\"\nFeeling so sad you want to end your life, or using drugs, these are signs that our culture is sick. People often think fighting is okay and normal. They believe tools for fighting and big groups of soldiers are part of loving their home place. Sometimes, this makes me sad about other people, and I like animals and plants more.\n\nThere was a young boy who liked to do things his own way, not like everyone else. Our world tells us we should all be the same. Buying things is more important than talking and working together. We judge each other by what we wear. What clothes do you have? What car do you drive? What do these things tell about you? What work do you do? How do you earn money for your home and clothes...so you have a place to sleep when you have free time to enjoy your home? We pass each other in our cars or meet at fun events that we usually pay for. Fun is something we watch, not something we join in. I have been feeling very strongly about this and wrote it down while waiting for an event...I feel very sad about a boy named Marshall's choice, I think it shows something is wrong with our world - not just his family.\n\nbeautiful orange sunset\n\nOn the same day I left the event for Marshall and saw a beautiful orange sunset that stayed pink on the horizon as I rode away, I later told a friend living in the NM state who also saw this sunset. A lady was reading a story about a sad event where many young people in a place called WA country were not happy and chose to hurt themselves. This strange event had happened more often lately, and it was not only in WA country but also in other places around the world. The story said that this kind of event was like a sad story in a famous book about a young man who was very sad because nobody loved him, and he felt he didn't belong. After this book was shared, many young men began to dress like the character in the book and also chose to hurt themselves. This is like a pattern - when one person does something, it makes it easier for others to do the same thing. The story also suggested that these sad events were signs of bigger problems in society. This made the lady think about how often such sad events happen around the world. She found out that it was happening more often in many different places. It's hard to believe that things were the same a long time ago. Lots of people all over the world are feeling worried, stressed, sad, scared, not eating right, hurting themselves, and feeling alone. This is a big problem, especially for kids. There are many reasons why people might feel this way, but it seems like a lot of it has to do with how we live. We are social beings - we need other people. But sometimes, things like changes in our world and the way we think about ourselves can make us feel isolated.\n\nWe are often told that we can do well if we only think about ourselves and compete with others. But really, our happiness is tied to the happiness of the people around us. \n\nRecently, another story talked about similar things. It said that people don't talk about power anymore. We're taught to think of ourselves as free, not controlled by anyone, and we don't think highly of leaders because they seem dishonest and out of ideas. But there's a big system that manages and controls lots of parts of our lives. We can't see it because we think about control in old ways--like leaders telling us what to do.\n\nThere's a film about this. It shows how this big system works. It talks about a huge computer in the mountains of a place called NE country. This computer keeps an eye on lots of the world's money. It also keeps an eye on what you do online. If it sees something bad happening, it moves its money to keep things okay. That's a lot of control. The computer also looks at what you like online and then shows you more of that. So, nothing changes and you don't learn anything new. That's also a lot of control.\n\nAt the same time, some people in a place called ND country are trying to protect their land.\nIn ND land, people are not just protesting against a big pipe project, they are protecting their water. I heard a story from a man who was part of a special family who taught about stories from the first people to live in this land. He told me that when the big paper of rules for this country was being written, a man named Thomas was inspired by a group called the Iroquois. This group, made up of six different tribes, were known for being very good at making decisions together. They built long houses and lived together as one big family.\n\nPeople like Benjamin and Thomas, who helped write our big rule book, learned a lot from these tribes. In fact, these tribes were some of the first people to practice democracy, which means everyone gets to help make decisions. This is a very important part of our history that many people don't know about.\n\nEven a man named Karl, who had big ideas about how people should live together, learned from the Iroquois. And every day, when kids say the pledge at school, they are reminded of these ideas.\n\nBut sometimes, I wonder if we are really all treated the same. Especially when the first people who inspired our big rule book are now living in places that are not very nice. These places are called sacrifice zones, because they are hurt by things like pollution or not having enough jobs. There are certain areas that are usually found in places where people don't have a lot of money. Sometimes, people think that everyone has a say in who becomes their leader. But, sometimes, big companies decide who will be the leaders even before the people vote. This was seen when a big company decided who would be the leaders even before the people had a chance to vote. \n\nThere was a man who worked at a big company. He made a list of who would be the leaders, even before the people voted. This company later got a lot of money from the government. \n\nSometimes, people think that being kind can help make things better. \n\nThere's also a man who writes about how the weather is changing and how some companies are hurting our world. His writing is always honest and brave.\n\"Let's talk about something simple: we should stop taking stuff from the ground. There's one way to keep bad stuff from going up into the air and it's easy: we just leave the stuff in the ground.\n\n\"People who decide things have a few choices. One, they can slowly stop taking stuff from the ground and use wind and sun instead. This can give a lot of people jobs. Two, they can keep taking stuff from the ground for a bit longer, but then they'll have to stop all of a sudden. This could be bad for jobs and where we live. Three, they can keep doing what they're doing now, but this could be bad for the world. Isn't it easy to decide what to do?\"\n\nMeanwhile,\nThe big underwater place, called GR reef, is not doing well after being here for a very, very long time.\nYou can read more about the GR reef here: http://www.blogwebsite.com/blog\n\nI'm sitting in the library with my computer. It's the only place I can go because I don't have extra money to spend at a coffee shop. There are other people here too, some who don't have homes. When I was in TU city, at the big school library, there were a lot of people without homes too. There are not many places to gather unless you have some coins to use. I hope to keep writing stories and doing my homework to finish my big project. I want to keep playing my big guitar and small piano and making music with my computer. I am not sure how to find a place where artists can stay and work.\n\nI make my own fun by learning and reading and doing all kinds of creative things. Except for the tools, which are free, all the time and effort I put into it make me happy and excited. It's about being active, not just about having things.\n\nI've had to leave many places over the past year. I had to leave my mom and dad's house, my friend's house, and other places because people need their own space. There are a lot of big houses here in SF town and some people have extra houses that they don't use. \n\nI now have even more things; a bag of clothes, my computer, big guitar, my favorite piano book, camera, and a few more round throwing discs because I've been playing games in each town I've lived in. But I'm almost without a home again. I'm living so high in the hills - so close to where the animals live - that my back is starting to hurt from carrying everything up and down the hill.\nToday, I'm going to a place where people talk about their ideas. Last time, I made a friend there. We talked a lot and I thought we could live together, but she didn't call me back. After that, I lived in a house on a hill with a man and his dog. I was supposed to move in with another friend, but she changed her mind at the last minute, after I had already stopped looking for a new home. Then, I started a new job helping at a school. But, the school didn't need my help after all and I found out from a note, not in person. If I hadn't seen the note, I would have woken up really early for nothing. Then, I wanted to play music with a group, but they played without me and didn't tell me. This was after I had tried to change the day to help one of them with his new job.\nSome people believe that a small group of people control everything. Sometimes, when you're looking for a place to live, you get strange messages or pictures from people. \n\nMeanwhile, a group of four people flew over forests in CA country that are not doing well. They were looking at the trees that are changing from green to brown. They found out that a lot of trees have died because there hasn't been enough rain. This is not good because it makes it easier for fires to start and it stops the forests from doing the good things they usually do, like cleaning water and taking in bad air. \n\nWhat I really want is to live in a place where I can help learn about and take care of the earth and animals. I dream of a group of people who want to do this too, and who also want to keep making new things. This work would help teach others about how we need to take care of our planet and everything that lives on it. Does anyone know where I can find a place like this? Do you want to join in without waiting? Sometimes, we have to make changes when things don't go our way. It's tough not just to dream, but to wake up from the dream. Charlotte, who is also known as a wandering music lover, is happy to receive gifts for her stories, pictures, drawings, online book and music. This story is about being active, caring for animals and our world, making a change, talking and understanding, learning about our world, not wanting too much, learning, feeling strong, being happy, staying healthy, knowing who we are, and drawing pictures. It's also about Adam, a man who talks about important things, a place in BR country where sad things happened, the trees in CA country that are not well, a big reef that is not alive anymore after being here for a very long time, feeling sad, feeling normal when things are not normal, a place where people decide things together, not having enough power, people who say no, being happy, a place that is not good, Thomas, a man who talked about important things, not being nice, people who protect water, and us, the people. This is a story about a girl named Hannah who was very curious and brave. She flew high because she didn't know what other people thought.\nThere was a brave girl named Hannah. She was different from others because she couldn't see, hear, or speak. But this didn't stop her from being bold and fearless. She didn't understand when people said she couldn't do something because she couldn't see their faces or hear their voices. This made her stronger and braver than many others who often feel scared or unsure because of what others say about them.\n\nHannah once said, \"Feeling safe is just a thought, not real.\" She also said, \"Life is a big adventure or it's nothing.\" She believed in living life bravely, not being afraid of what others might say or think.\n\nJust like Hannah, we should all try to be brave and not worry about what others might say. We should live our lives like a big adventure. This story makes us want to learn more about Hannah's brave life.\nI was looking at my writing and noticed that someone read this, one of my first stories. I chose to share it again because it talks about important things like being good and fair. Sometimes, people in charge don't always act good or fair, especially if they care more about power and money.\n\nThere was a man named Adam who wrote a book called \"The Little Friend\". This story is about being aware, feeling happy, and being kind to others. \n\nI found something interesting on a social media site and felt like sharing it. It's about a man named Jack sharing his secret to a good life.\nLook at the world with love, not fear. Make choices because of love, not fear. \n\nThere's a story about a man named Jack who had a big secret about life. We are not just watching life, we are part of it and we can shape it. Fear can make us think about the past or worry about the future. But remember, what's happening is right now, not in the past or the future. It's up to you to choose love or fear.\n\nA wise man named Henry once said there's no real world except the one inside us. Life doesn't just happen to us, it happens for us. Believe in your dreams, tell the universe what you want, work for it, and don't worry about how it will come true.\n\nRemember, you always have two choices: love or fear.\n\nOnce, as the sun was setting, Jack reached a big body of water. He decided to choose love over fear and watch a very special moonrise over the water. This started his \"Big Moon Adventure\". His goal was to explore two big bodies of water, the DE bay and the CH bay. But he didn't know how big the area was and he ended up staying in one place, CM city. He wanted to see the special moon rise over the big body of water, and he did. One day, I went on a trip to the NE city's big walkway by the sea, just as the sun was going down. The water of the big sea looked blue and beautiful under the setting sun. I have some pictures of the big, bright moon over the city. The setting sun made the water look like a pretty painting. The big moon was rising over the big sea. \n\nI started my trip early in the day. I had a bag with me, with a marker, toothbrush, swimsuit, sleeping bag, sun cream, and a camera. I didn't bring any cards or check if I had any money. But I found out I had five dollars and some coins. I brought some food like sweet potatoes, bread, cheese, fruit, and a water bottle. On the second night, I felt like having a drink, so I used my five dollars. \n\nMy trip cost just $1.57 in total. This included the drink I bought on the second day, the trip, a place to sleep, and running water (there were rest houses on the big walkway by the sea). I even saw some big machines cleaning the beach. I decided to sleep between the lifeboat and the fence at the dunes so I wouldn't be in their way. \n\nBecause I didn't have a lot of money, I had to find someone to ride with. One sunny day, I wanted to go on a trip. I checked the local city's message board and found a note from a person, let's call him Adam, who was going to NF waterfall. But, I was more interested in going to the ocean to see the fish and crabs in the CB and DB bays...Soon, I got a message on my toy phone. I didn't want to tell Adam exactly where I lived, so I just told him my street. Soon, my toy phone made a noise. I told Adam to meet me at the street corner.\nWhen I walked to the street corner, I saw a car parked far away and someone walking around it. As I got closer, I could tell it was Adam. The sun was bright and I saw a bunch of papers on the ground next to his car. I walked up to the open car window and asked Adam if those papers were his. He quickly said he'd pick them up. He told me he had driven from a nearby ST to give me a ride. Adam was a big, round man with a hat on his head. I saw a lot of mess in his car, even some coins on the floor by my seat. I helped Adam by picking up the papers from the ground and handing them to him through the window. He didn't seem nice, so I said, \"No, thank you\" and left. I didn't answer when he called me a little later because I was busy making a sign for my trip to the PE highway. The first person who stopped was a man who seemed scarier than the first, so I said, \"I want to go all the way there. Thanks anyway.\" I don't usually say no to rides, so this was strange. The next ride was a woman who knew my brother and sister when I told her more about me. She was very nice and even went out of her way to drop me off at my first stop. The other rides were just as good and the drivers were fun to talk to. \n\nThe sign was so small that people would have to be very close to see it.\n\nThe last man, who was from CA city, drove me right to the middle of the town near the big walkway by the beach. We both smiled and laughed when I got out of his car, carrying only my sleeping bag and not knowing where I would go next.\n\nWhen I got there, there was no wind at all. I climbed up on the tall chair that the beach watchers use (they leave at the end of the afternoon) and put my stuff down. There were two young couples sitting on a blanket not far from me. They were visiting for the day from the big city. The sea was calm and pretty, just like a soft blanket. The air was a bit wet, and the sound of the sea was like a soft drum. \n\nA very big moon was shining over the sea. \n\nWhat made me gasp was the color of the sea when I was swimming and looking at the setting sun. The sunlight was like a bright orange light on the blue sea, just like the sky. I wanted to remember this beautiful sea, but I couldn't take my camera with me into the water. \n\nAfter spending hours playing games on the beach with my cousins, I went to sit on the wooden path by the sea. I ended up sleeping there that night after chatting with a boy from BU country who I met there. He spoke in a different language on his phone, and it sounded a bit like RU language, but I found out it was actually BU language. \n\nThe next night, I knew about the tent-like things on the beach. They were helpful when I slept in a bag under the stars, and it started to rain early in the morning. I was close to some small, easy-to-set-up tents (not the big ones) where I could simply listen to the rain and the sound of the ocean. These tents became like my little house. \nI went to a bird park in the FR country. I also visited a big building in the town where I got a map. The map was to help me find my way to the local park. \nBut, the map wasn't very good. It was missing streets and it was hard to tell how far things were. It was really hot, and I had to walk down the street to the first place. But I turned around and decided to go to the park instead. \nOn my way back to town, a car with two people dressed like normal people told me that it's not okay to ask for rides in NE city. So, I had to walk. When I had to cross a road to go to the bird park, I looked far away and decided to ask for a ride again. A man with a board for riding waves in his car gave me a ride. I asked him what he does for work because his car was very nice. He told me he works on boats. \nMy visit to the park was very important, not just because of the birds, but because of the other people who were there too. I remember seeing two pairs of friends at the end of the path. One friend reminded me of a lady who drove the same car as I did on my way back to the PE state. They left and went to the pizza shop near the park where I had a short talk with a worker. They saw me and noticed how nice I was. The worker told them that I was going to the PE state, where they lived too. The next day, one of the friends was at a small shop when I walked up to ask if he had any cardboard. Thirty minutes later, he and his friend were the ones who gave me a ride after my first ride dropped me off at the edge of the city and at the entrance to the big bridge.\n\nI had been standing there under the sun and some rain with a sign that had the letters, PE. I saw many cars with NE, DE and PE license plates drive by, leaving the beach. When they stopped, they said that they had seen me twice over the weekend, and they planned to give me a ride if they saw me. I didn't know until later that they were going to a place 40 mi. from my city. We all talked happily about many things during the whole drive. It started to rain, and that made them leave too. Sometimes, there was heavy rain on the way. We had a wonderful time together, learning from each other. We saw a bright, orange moon in the sky, not long after the sun had gone to sleep. It was so beautiful that it took my breath away. You can look at the pictures of our adventure here.\n\nOn our last day, while I was eating on the beach, something unexpected happened. A seagull tapped me on the back of my head! It wanted the food I was holding. I tossed a small piece of bread into the air and in no time, there were a lot of seagulls fluttering around me. It was a bit scary.\n\nI managed to take some pictures of this.\n\nWe also saw something interesting when we were near the edge of LA town. We saw people from an old-fashioned community, who live simple lives on farms in the countryside, riding in a special carriage. They had a little baby cow with them in a trailer. I tried to take a picture, but I missed the trailer. It was really amazing to see their simple way of life in our modern world. After that, we said our goodbyes.\n\nHere are some more pictures:\n- A carriage on the road near LA town\n- A seagull through a clear roof\n- A picture I took in WI city through a glass roof.\n\nAnd here's a fun story from an old tribe to end our adventure.\nA big, powerful being wanted to hide a special secret from people. This secret was that people could make their own world. The eagle offered to hide it on the moon, but the big being said no, one day people will go there. The salmon wanted to hide it at the bottom of the ocean, but the big being said no, people will go there too. The buffalo wanted to hide it in the big fields, but the big being said no, they will dig into the earth and find it there. Grandmother Mole, who couldn't see with her eyes but could see with her heart, said, \"Put it inside them.\" And the big being said, \"It is done.\" \n\nThere are some other words here that don't make a lot of sense to us, so let's ignore them. \n\nThere is also a story about a woman named Diana. She did something unusual tonight. After a busy day, I relaxed in front of the TV late at night. Usually, I like to make music, play games, or write. But that day, I had spent time outside taking care of our yard, which is like a little forest. I made sure to give water and food to the animals and birds that live there. Afterward, I rode my bike to the library to work on my book. On my way back, I stopped by a farm where I often visit the animals. There are horses, a donkey, and three cats that I have given names. Sadly, one of the cats was hit by a car and is no longer with us. \n\nApart from music, games, writing, and exploring new things, I really love animals. \n\nWhen I turned on the TV, I ended up watching a movie about a lady who loved to study gorillas in their home in the forest. This movie helped me understand why I had wanted to watch TV that night. In 2008, a big decision was made to let AF country sell a lot of ivory to traders in JA and CH countries. This made the carving industry active again. \nSometimes, the things I see on TV from HO city make me upset. Every time an ad for a silly TV show comes on, I quickly turn the sound off and look at my computer. Even though I don't have a paying job, I am working hard on writing and selling my first eBook. \nEven though HO city makes some good movies, like this one, I still don't like a lot of the things they do. \nThe end of the movie didn't surprise me. Fiona was trying to protect the animals, but she was also getting in the way of how the people there lived. After the movie, I looked up more about Fiona, and I found out that no one ever figured out who hurt her.\nBut what's important is that I'm glad I learned about Fiona's life and about these animals. I had a really good day because I felt thankful, I loved being with nature and animals, and I was excited about the writing I'm doing. I also like riding my bike, being in nature, seeing animals, and meeting new people. I was feeling good when I decided to read an email that I usually ignore. I was trying to figure out why I stayed with a boy who wasn't nice to me, and didn't make me feel good. I was curious about why I didn't love myself enough. To understand this better, I started getting emails about feelings, how to be dependent on myself, and how to feel powerful and happy. I learned that I needed to take care of me first. I found out that some of these emails were trying to make me buy something, but some of them really helped me. I wanted to share one that I liked a lot. It was about how to enjoy life, from a group called \"It's All About Girls\".\nSometimes, we need a little nudge to remind us to enjoy every day. What fun thing will you do today? Don't wait for tomorrow to start working towards your dreams. Life is short, and we should make the most of it. \n\nBe brave! Try new things that might be a bit scary. Find the magic in every day, even in the simplest things. Work hard for your dreams, but don't forget to have fun. Life is like a roller coaster ride, with exciting ups and downs.\n\nEvery day gives us a chance to join in the fun of life, instead of just watching it pass by. Here are some thoughts about life:\n\n- \"Only brave people who take risks can find out how far they can go.\"\n- \"Life is either a bold adventure or it is nothing.\"\n- \"If someone wastes an hour, they haven't realized how precious life is.\"\n- \"There are only two ways to live life. One is as if nothing is special. The other is as if everything is special.\"\n- \"We don't stop having fun because we get old; we get old because we stop having fun.\"\n\"Having fun is important. Don't be too careful all the time, because you might miss out on exciting things,\" said Adam. Richard added, \"It's better to be busy than to sit around doing nothing.\" Gabriel reminded everyone, \"If you have a dream, go for it. Being brave can make great things happen.\" Another friend said, \"What we give is what we get in life.\" Benjamin said, \"Remember, it's not about how long you live, but how well you live.\" Life is all about making good choices. Sophia told us, \"You might regret the things you didn't do.\" \n\nI am just sharing my thoughts with you. I have many more things I want to share and I'm also working on a book and some music. But, it's hard because I don't have a lot of money. I am living in the BG country and sometimes, I can't even pay all my rent. So, I think I'm about to start a new adventure in life, even if I might not have a home soon. So, if you want to help, you can give a little. If you know someone who has a lot, you can ask them to give a little too. We're talking about caring for animals, being aware of them, keeping them safe, and making sure we're happy and healthy. We're also talking about people who study animals and nature, people who protect animals, and people who love nature. We're talking about big animals like elephants and small animals too. We're also talking about places far away, like the AS country and the JA country, where some people do things that are not good for animals. We're talking about a big park where animals live and people who care for them. We're also talking about things like horns and tusks that come from animals. We're talking about love, life, and nature.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "f36345b194ad87b4d1e5caa3423f630d4cdfc8b5747e4c3ce0a01cfedec092bd"}

Let's just say it's how they help people and the planet.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "de63d3878c715b9d817e6ab5e233671da47555a55644e809fca28f938ba1fbfc"}
{"text": "In a faraway place called TR city, there were some heroes dressed in red. They were very important because they helped people when they were hurt or in danger. This group was started by a man named Ryan. Ryan was a very smart doctor who wanted to help people.\n\nWhen Ryan was a young boy, he moved from his home and went to school in TR city. He learned a lot about how to take care of sick people. Now, everyone in TR city knows Ryan and thinks he is very important.\n\nEven though Ryan and his team do a lot of good work, Ryan thinks they can do even better. He says, \"We need more tools. We need to train more people to help. We need to make sure these people stay in TR city. Also, our hospitals are very old. We need to make them better.\"\n\nMany smart doctors and nurses have moved to other places like GE country and FR country where they can make more money. This is a big problem, especially in the small towns. Right now, TR city needs about 40,000 more doctors. They only spend a little bit of their money on healthcare, which is not a lot compared to other places.\n\nRyan says, \"We have a problem because we are not giving hospitals enough money. Sometimes, we pay them less than what they need, and this causes problems.\"\nWe once met Alice and her little girl, Ariana, in a big city. Alice shared a scary story about their time in a big hospital for children. Ariana got sick from a bad bug and had to stay in the hospital. Alice stayed with her all night, but she had to sleep on a hard, cold floor because there were no beds or soft places to sleep.\n\nMany people have said that this country's hospitals have big problems, and Alice agreed with them. She said, \"The nurses only cared about money. If you wanted to change the sheets on your child's bed, you had to give them money. If you didn't, they wouldn't help you. So every time I needed help from a nurse, I had to give her money.\"\n\nAlice also shared that, by luck, she noticed that Ariana was given the wrong medicine. But that wasn't the only problem. The bad bug made Ariana throw up a lot. This made her very weak and she needed to have a special tube put in to help her get better.\n\nAlice said, \"One nurse came to put in the special tube. But she didn't know what she was doing. I could tell because her hand was shaking. I got very, very worried when I saw that the tube she was going to put in Ariana's arm was broken. I couldn't believe she wanted to use a broken tube. That's not right!\"\nNot long after, Alice saw that the big tube in her daughter's arm was full of air. She took it out herself, just in time to keep Ariana safe. Ariana got better completely, but her mother was worried. She said we need to change things so this doesn't happen to anyone else. \n\nShe's not the only one who thinks this. Even a big international group has said that the FR country needs to make its doctor system better. Cameron, a big school teacher, said the system doesn't work: \"We can't keep the doctor system like it is. It doesn't help everyone in the same way, and it costs too much.\"\n\nAdam also works as a big doctor in the capital. He goes to the TE city to work on the weekends. After spending time with the fire helpers in the PA city, Adam wanted to make the doctor system in FR country like the one in PA city.\n\nHe has worked a lot to make things better, after seeing how bad they were a long time ago. \"We could see that sick people were coming to the hospital too late and they were not getting help. They were coming with more problems because they didn't get the right help until they got to the hospital,\" he said.\nAdam was on a TV show one day and he didn't like the idea of letting private companies compete with emergency services. This made the president of the RO country upset and he called Adam an \"enemy of health reform\" while the TV show was still on. Because of this, Adam decided to quit his job. When people heard about this, many of them went out on the streets to show their support for Adam.\n\nAdam believed that if private companies started to compete with emergency services, it would make the public system weaker. He said, \"When everyone starts fighting for their own piece of the pie, it can make things dangerous.\"\n\nBefore, the emergency services were all separate from each other. But Adam had a big idea to bring them all together under one emergency number. This made things less confusing and helped people get help faster.\n\nAdam was very proud of the call center in the TM city. He said, \"We have everyone here - the police, the medical team, the operators for the emergency number, and the fire service. This helps us use our resources and information better, especially when lots of people need help at once. It's more efficient and costs less.\"\n\nBut things got harder because of some problems in the government. In the past many years, the FR country has had lots of health helpers. This made it hard to have a good health plan. Adam showed us how the emergency room in a hospital got better. He hopes all hospitals can look like this one day: \"We need to make lots of hospitals better. This is why we need more money. We want to fix and make better all the health places in the FR country.\"\n\nThe biggest problems are in small towns, where there are not enough helpers and help comes slow. Not long ago, a help place was built in a small town because of Mayor Jack. He got money for water and electricity, but for the help services, he had to ask Adam.\n\nThe mayor told us about how hard this was: \"The problem was we didn't have enough money. One small town can't pay for everything. So we had to ask six other mayors from nearby towns to help. It took 10 years to agree, but we did it, and now we have help services.\"\n\nOn its first day, a farmer got hurt by a horse. The help service sent a helicopter and saved his life. This year, 20 more help places will be made in small towns.\nIn a place called RA town, we met a man who took care of goats. His name was Isaac and he liked a person named Adam very much. Isaac shared a story about his son who was hurt in the belly by a wooden stick. A red vehicle with helpers came quickly and took them to TA city. Soon, his boy was all better.\n\nThe helpers in the red vehicle flew away on another mission to help a baby who was not well. Adam hoped to make things better in the town's health care.\n\nThere are other stories too. Some people from UK country had to leave their homes but are now going back. In FR country, things have changed a lot since a big problem happened in 2015. In GE country, a big decision about energy is being made.\n\nHealth and help in RO city are important topics.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "b382974d1aa1d6ce8538835b5398b23e14e6b7fc7972bc7558d563bbeade2b23"}
{"text": "A big music event was held in a famous music place in TO city. The music band from CH city travelled up to TO city to play music in this newly improved place. A band called Bright Light Group, from AT city, began the evening with fun music that made people want to dance. The music place used to have seats like a theater, but those were taken out on the bottom level to make room for people to stand and dance. The floor is slanted, so everyone can see well. Just after it got dark, the band UM started to play their music. Their special kind of music made people want to move and dance right from the start. One song, called \"Ocean Billy,\" was especially good as UM played it really well with a long middle part of the song. UM is known for changing their music as they play. They use hand signs to change things in the music, which makes each show special and different. The two guitar players in the band, Jake and Brendan, play together very well, making a sound that is really good. There was a group of musicians playing a mix of new and old songs. They even played a song by a famous band. The last song they played had fun words about drinks and grilling food. The drummer, let's call him Kevin, and the percussionist, we'll name him Adam, kept the rhythm that made people want to dance. There was also a bass player, let's call him Ryan, who played cool low notes that made people want to move closer to the stage, like bugs drawn to a light. But the best parts were the guitar solos by two musicians, let's name them Cameron and Benjamin. These solos made the crowd really excited and they couldn't wait for more music. After a break, the band started playing again with a lot of energy. The crowd, with both young and old people, loved every bit of it. The keyboard player, let's name him Jack, played important parts in the songs that night. One of the songs had a bit of a darker mood, and was played between a rocking song. There was also a light show that was very impressive. There was a fun show one night with lots of lights and music. The band played a famous song at the end, and everyone was happy. The crowd was loud and full of energy, making the band feel loved. It felt like a weekend night, even though it was the middle of the week. The band played many songs, and everyone had a great time. After the show, they played another famous song as a bonus. There were also other events and shows mentioned, like a famous person's show in the OT city and a music festival that you can watch on your tablet or computer. Plus, there was a special event where you can be the star of the show.\nDavid, also known as Davey Boy 2.0, talked about a music event. It was in the city called ON and it happened on the fourth stage of a place people often go to enjoy music. The main singer of the event was Patrick. This event was interesting because the stage was not much higher than the floor. This made the singer feel close to the people who came to listen. Patrick was very friendly. He smiled a lot and talked with the people there. He told them that he was born in the MT city and had sung in many places in ON city. He even named all the places he had sung at, which were about 14. The event had a funny moment when Patrick said, \"I make sure my guitar sounds right because I want you to enjoy my music.\" He even sang some songs that people asked for. When you listen to Patrick, you feel like his voice is special but also familiar. There once was a boy named Ethan who loved making music. He had a knack for creating his own songs. Ethan enjoyed exploring different kinds of music and often met other musicians who helped him learn and grow.\n\nEthan had a special talent for writing songs that people loved to hear. His first songs were very catchy and made people want to sing along. Over time, Ethan learned to create different sounds with his music, and his songs kept getting better and better.\n\nEthan had a unique style. He liked to mix different sounds together. Sometimes he would play loud and energetic guitar, and other times he would play soft and gentle tunes. Ethan knew how to make music that was fun to listen to and easy to remember.\n\nEthan was not only a talented songwriter, but also a great performer. He knew how to play both the electric and acoustic guitars very well. He could also sing in a wide range of notes. When Ethan performed, he would often start with just him and his guitar, and then other musicians would join in. Everyone loved listening to Ethan's music. So, the songs by Nancy and Sunlight were pretty and had thoughtful words. They also let us hear how well Ethan could sing, using his voice in many different ways. Ethan then played on an electric guitar. He told us that his friend, Jeff, who usually plays the keyboard, couldn't be there as he was at a big music event in a faraway place; we'll hear more about that later. Ethan sang a song called \"Blue of You\" from his older music album, which had a strong beat and a loud guitar at the end. Some people in the room really liked the soft, gentle songs, while others liked the louder ones. Ethan had lots of songs to choose from and his music had different styles, like old-timey soul music, sounds like the Beatles, and songs like those by a famous singer. Later in the night, Ethan told stories about when he was a teenager and he went on a journey to meet his childhood hero, the famous singer, and how it finally happened after many years- more on that on a website. Jeremy and Gavin helped keep the music going, and they also helped sing some parts when Jeff wasn't there. Ethan and his friends were playing their music and everyone was having a great time. Everyone liked the music so much that they wanted to hear more. Ethan knew his music very well and knew how to make everyone happy. Even though one of Ethan's friends couldn't come, they still had a good time. Ethan made jokes and talked with everyone, and even changed his music a little to play what people asked for. They played a special song that everyone liked, and it made the first part of their music time very fun. They also played some songs about being naughty, and everyone liked that too. Ethan asked everyone to say they missed his friend Jeff, who couldn't come. When they started their music time again, Ethan played a special instrument and hoped he wouldn't make any mistakes. He played a song from a while ago and everyone liked it. Ethan also made everyone sing along with him during a fun and happy song. Adam and his friends played some fun music. They used different things to make sound like a little toy that sounds like a bee. They played many different songs, and everyone liked them a lot. They played a quiet song, a loud song, and even a song that sounded like it was from a very famous band. Adam also played a special instrument with buttons that make different sounds. Everyone thought Adam and his friends were really good and thought they would keep playing more and more music. They played two times, and each time they played different songs. Some of the songs were happy, some were sad, and some made people want to dance. After they finished playing, people talked about the music and how much they liked it. The event happened in a place called \"ON stage\". A person named \"Turd Ferguson\" wrote about it later.\nWhy You Shouldn't Miss Benjamin's Show at the OF Festival\nOF Festival\nImpromptu Jack's Surprise Music Session in CP Park\nNE City Music Festival Grand Final Weekend\nWritten by: Jack Photos by: Matthew\n\nThe final weekend of the Music Festival 2011 had a lot of exciting shows. One of the best was Benjamin's band, who played a fantastic set of their best songs. The crowd, who were mostly in their late 30s, loved it. Then there was David's band who played some really good music that made everyone feel like they were in the FR country. The crowd loved it, even though they were a bit tired.\n\nBut the biggest surprise was the weather on Sunday afternoon. It came without any warning and left everyone who had been at the festival for 12 days wet and scared. Some were even thankful they were still okay. If you haven't heard about the storm that ended the Music Festival early on Sunday night, let me tell you: A few songs into David's band's set, at early in the evening, some very dark clouds started to come in very fast from the north. People at a big music show, including me, were taking pictures of a very dark cloud coming. It was a hot day, and everyone thought a little rain would be nice. We were excited about the music we were going to hear that night. As we were watching a band play a song, the wind started to blow very hard. Big signs started to fall over, and the stage curtains were flapping in the wind. A big cloud of dust came up, and the loudspeakers stopped working. The musicians stopped playing and left the stage because it wasn't safe. I told my wife, 'We should go to the big tent, it might rain a lot..' But as we were going there, the wind got even stronger and people started to get scared. The wind was blowing harder and harder, and suddenly the tent didn't seem like a safe place. The tent's sides were blowing around a lot. I was about to ask my wife if we should go to the big building instead, when we both saw the big stage start to wobble and then fall over. A big stage fell down like a pile of blocks. It happened so fast, it was scary! Lots of people, like friends and family, were there. So, we thought some people might be hurt. We ran fast to the car park. The car park was like a safe place to hide. Inside, we saw people coming in. They didn't know what had happened. They were happy and shouting. I talked to a man. I told him what I saw. He asked if there will be music on the other stage. We stayed with our friends. We were worried about what might happen to people. We didn't know anything and we couldn't help. After the big storm, we came out to see helpers running around with boxes of money, grown-ups looking for their kids, guards either panicking or not caring, and the bosses shouting that it was all done to clear the park. They told us to go one way, but we went the other way to get to our bikes. We were surprised by how messy everything was. Things that were not heavy were thrown around, fences were knocked down, tables and chairs were everywhere, and some food stands were ruined. As we got to the exit, we saw a big stage leaning back, with fire trucks and ambulances all around. I tried to think about how it could have fallen like that. I saw a friend who makes music sitting in his truck with his family, probably thinking the same thing. We looked at each other and I knew it was best to go home. The helpers were there, so it was time to let them fix things and for us to stay out of the way. Riding our bikes home while it was still storming was not as scary, even though we had no power at our house until the next day. The next day, we were all very happy to find out that nobody was hurt badly from a message from the park bosses. Thank goodness! It was a big weekend full of music and fun. But, the last day, Sunday, was the most exciting of them all. Many people came to listen to the music. Some things were different this year and not everyone was happy. But, as the days went on, people figured out how to have a good time. Even though some things were hard, like finding clean places, everyone had a chance to have fun. You could find a good place to sit if you looked around. You could also avoid big crowds. Yes, there were a few moments when people sat down on the lawn to rest. Was everything perfect? No, but it was still a lot of fun. I don't! It was something fun to talk about. The big event was full of fun for those who had tickets, especially those who had tickets for the whole time. It was a wonderful time to be with friends, just like a big family gathering, every day for 2 weeks. What else could make us feel this way as we all change into regular people? Thanks again to the big music event. I can't wait for next year!\n\nThe main stage at the big music event fell down. \nA review of the big music event on July 14, 2011\nWritten by: A man named Jay \nPhoto by: A man named Andrew \nLooking at the schedule, Thursday night at the big music event didn't look as exciting as the rock show the night before. Many regular people thought it was a good night to rest. Early in the day, I was also thinking about not going. But I know that sometimes, the least expected days at the big music event can be the most talked about. Sometimes, a performer who nobody knows can put on a show that people remember forever. So, we quickly ate some burritos and rode our bikes to the park, not really expecting anything. But I thought it would be a good idea to go. Well, it wasn't the most surprising night, but it was at least a bit surprising. A sunny day left some light spots on my skin. I didn't mind when I heard that the band I was waiting for couldn't play because someone was sick. But, I was happy when I found out that a band from Hamilton got to play instead. The band played really well and the crowd liked them a lot. Their music was energetic and fun. I liked their music, but I also wanted to listen to some quieter music. So, we went to see some other shows at smaller stages. We started by watching a group of girls who were playing guitars. They played simple but good music. They also looked nice on stage and played really well. I hope they continue playing music and maybe think of a better name for their band. Then, we went to another stage and listened to a band playing blues music. The music was different and a bit messy but I started to like it after a while. After that, there was a break and no bands were playing for a while. We decided to wait at the stage for the next band to start playing. A band with a fun name, inspired by a popular movie, played on the stage in CA country. The band, with Benjamin as the lead singer, has been making music for many years. They have lots of fans who love their music. Benjamin sings in a unique way, and some people think he reminds them of a famous singer. There's also a guitar player who is great at playing tricky parts of the songs and singing too. Even though I don't really like their music, I think they play their instruments very well. Another band was also playing, so we moved to another stage. This band's music was different, kind of like the old rock music our parents like. Their lead singer, Jeff, really likes some famous old singers. And who doesn't, right? We saw a big crowd at the SU station stage, then we went to the HA rock place. There was a band playing with their leader, Thomas. Thomas was upset because there was a lot of noise coming from the Tea Party place. He talked about it and did a funny move that surprised everyone. Thomas began his song (he was looking at the words on a stand) and even though his band was very good, his singing was just okay. But, because he's a good performer, he still got everyone's attention. He sang some interesting words in his songs. It seemed like people were there to see the famous person more than to listen to the music. Did you hear that Thomas and Susan broke up? Wow, I didn't know that. It was fun to yell out things from his movies. The best part of the night was when 'LA-33' played at the NA Bank Stage. It felt like the fun times from before. This dancing music group from CO country is thought to be the best and they travel a lot in the summer, but they don't usually come to our city. Their fans were really happy to see them and they were chanting 'Co-lom-bia!' Ready to move to the music, there was an amazing band from BO city. They played Salsa music so well - the band had 14 members and even a pair of amazing dancers spinning and stepping on stage. Many people from the local community were dancing to the Salsa, Mambo, and fun Boogaloo beats. I'm starting to enjoy Salsa and Latin Jazz more and more as I hear it. One day, I hope to learn the steps to dance Salsa - maybe an easy version, but I'll learn how to do it. Trying to dance was a lot of fun tonight, and I'm always amazed by a pair of well-practiced dancers on the dance floor. There were a lot of happy faces having the best time showing off their moves.\n\nThis article is written by Jason and the photos are taken by Mike. It's hard to sit down and think about this experience because it's still making my heart beat fast. It feels like I've just eaten a really tasty meal and I'm full to bursting. Maybe it was a yummy steak, or even a Tofu steak, it doesn't matter! I just want to hold on to this happy feeling for as long as I can. Should I remember how yummy it was, and how much fun it was to eat? Maybe soon, but not right now. For now, I can think again about how a really great music night started. For me, and many others who got there on time for the hard-to-get-to early evening start, a band called T were the best way to start the show with fast, exciting, and exact modern music. They have been getting known in the AM country music world for a while, showing up at big festivals because of their old school skills and new thinking song making and plans. They can play music with the best of them, but can also make everyone really excited with perfect songs, like their last song 'W.S.L.', that could be played by a very popular band like the A.B. I was mad at myself (Oh no, M!) for missing the first half of the show and really hope to see them again soon. Once T finished (to a very big crowd for that time), we went up the hill to the Big Bank Stage to see a band called I.C. from a place called WI city, who were last here in the Spring, opening for the P. I liked the sweet songs I had heard in two-person style but was happy to hear they were playing with a full band, half of whom seemed to be having their birthday today. Adam and Bella made some very nice songs. These songs sound like folk music, but they also have a bit of a spooky vibe when performed live. Bella, who sings in a very natural way, has a beautiful voice that reminds people of other singers. Some people say she sounds like a mix of two famous singers, while others think she sounds like a few different singers. They also played a very nice version of a popular song called \"ME country song\", and played it just like the original. \n\nThen there was a little break before the next band. I checked out another band twice, but their music wasn't really what I was in the mood for that night. I think their music would sound better indoors, but that night it just seemed like their music wasn't really going anywhere. They had two drummers playing the same beat, which I didn't really understand. I think it's supposed to make the music sound fuller, but that night it just made me lose interest. \n\nThere was another band performing on a different stage, but I decided not to go see them because I could always see them next year. I also listened to a bit more blues music from two other musicians. There was a band dressed in white, maybe to keep cool in the evening. I was too excited and distracted, ready to find a good spot to watch the main band, \"MM\". We went to the festival square and found out the previous band had finished early. We were happy because \"MM\" was going to start early at bedtime. As the band started playing, we quickly moved closer to the stage, holding a drink and feeling the strong beats of the music. I asked my friend if we should move back to get some ear protectors, but she said, 'No, we'll get used to the loud sound!'. We did get used to it, and the band played really good music that felt amazing to hear, even if it was very loud. This was my first time seeing \"MM\" perform live, even though I have liked their music for many years. I am really happy I finally got to see them play. Thank you, music festival! There was a show where a group played music. They had two pretend bears next to the stage and a big green picture of an eye behind them. They played music that was really good, just like a very popular band does. The main singer, let's call him Jim, could sing in many different ways but he always sounded like himself. The band played lots of songs, some old and some new, and they were all very excited. Sometimes they played really loud and fast, and other times they played slow and soft. The drummer, let's call him Patrick, was very good at keeping the beat. They played many songs from their popular collections. There was also a funny moment when Jim put a towel on his head and acted like a character. During the show, there was a loud noise that they didn't want, but they kept playing until someone could stop the noise. The show was really good and everyone enjoyed it, just like when you eat a big tasty meal.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "c842021a39d026f8d2b10653d61203788c28861c90c53fdc0fe7678d9b0bc98d"}

{"text": "This is a story about a big health group in the US. They used to say that there was no link between a certain medical procedure and a serious illness. But then, they changed their website and didn't say anything for a while. Later, they said that it wasn't clear if there was a link or not. They also said that they would talk about it more in the future. A big health organization, let's call it HO, found out that having your first child at an older age and not having children at all can be risky. These two things can be linked to a medical procedure that women sometimes have, which can delay when they have a baby and sometimes makes it hard for them to have a baby later on. \n\nThere were many loud voices in the NE city newspaper and other places. They said the HO was just doing what a big group of people wanted them to do. Dr. Jack, a teacher who knows a lot about how the body works, said the HO used to not tell the truth, then they were silent, and now they are starting to tell the truth quietly. He thinks that's a little bit of progress. He wrote back to the loud voices in a newspaper on a winter day in 2003. \n\nDr. Jack said that since the year when he was a little older, the HO had information on their website about this medical procedure and a sickness women can get in their chest. They put this information up because a lot of people were talking about it, and there were even two big studies done by the HO itself that showed women who had this procedure had a higher chance of getting the sickness. \n\nDr. Jack thought it was clear that the HO was influenced by the loud voices. After all, shouldn't doctors tell their patients about any possible bad things that might happen from any procedure, especially one they don't have to have? But instead of being careful, the HO said the studies were not clear and didn't agree with each other.\nA long time ago, my friends and I from a big school wrote a very important paper. In our paper, we talked about the studies that people had done about a sickness. We found that in many studies, a certain action made the sickness more likely.\n\nWe thought that a body change that happens during growing a baby could make the sickness more likely if the baby-growing stops too soon. But, if the baby-growing stops because of a natural problem, it usually does not make the sickness more likely.\n\nThe big school's paper about the sickness and the action changed over time. But the biggest change happened when they said that the action does not make the sickness more likely. They believed a paper about women from a DE country.

{"text": "Charlotte, Cameron, Gabriel, Henry, Isaac, Jack, Kevin, Liam, Matthew, Nathan, Oliver, Patrick, Quentin, Ryan, Samuel, and Thomas looked at how a special juice (we'll call it Juice A) and another special juice (we'll call it Juice B) can help understand heart health. They did this in 27 people who had a long-term heart problem. They did four types of tests. They divided the heart into 11 parts and studied them. They decided that the part with the most activity during a test was the most important (activity=100%). They found that if the activity in the other parts was less than 50%, it meant something significant. In a big study, they looked at many parts of the heart. They used special ways to see how well each part was working. In some parts of the heart, they found things weren't working as well as they should. They found that the worse a part was working, the less of some special stuff it took in. But, all parts of the heart could still take in some of this special stuff, which means they were still alive and working a bit. This study helps us understand more about how the heart works and how we can help it when it's not doing so well.\nA group of people did a study. They looked at how hearts work when they are sick. They used special tools to see inside the heart. These tools use light particles to create a picture of the heart. They discovered important things about how hearts work. Their findings were written down in a book about medicine. A group of doctors, including Adam, Benjamin, and Gabriel among others, did a special study. They looked at how well hearts were working in people with a certain kind of heart problem. They used some special materials to help them see the hearts better. They tested these materials on 27 people who had this heart problem for a long time. Scientists did several tests. They looked at a heart and divided it into 11 parts. They took a part with the most activity as a reference. They found out that if a part of the heart didn't have enough activity, it could be seen as having a problem. They tested 33 parts of the heart and found that 21 parts had significant activity and 10 parts had less activity. They also found that more activity was found in the parts with lesser problems and less activity in the parts with bigger problems. From all these tests, they concluded that the amount of activity in a part of the heart can tell if that part has a problem or not.Some smart doctors wanted to see how well the heart works in people who have heart disease. They used special tools to look inside the heart. They compared two ways to see which one is better. They did this test on 27 people who have heart disease. The following tests were done: (1) a first test, (2) a second test, (3) a third test, (4) a fourth test. The heart was divided into 11 parts in the pictures from the tests. The part with the most activity during the first test was used as a guide (activity=100%). Areas that didn't show up well in the second test were labeled as very bad. Any areas that showed more than 50% activity in the fourth and third tests were thought to be important. In total, 33 parts showed very bad results in the second test. Out of these, 21 parts showed important results in the fourth test and 10 parts in the third test. As for the 37 parts with bad results, the fourth test was present in 29 and the third test in 31, while of the 134 parts with okay results, 128 showed the fourth test uptake, and 131, the third test uptake. In conclusion, the worse the second test results, the better the results of the third and fourth tests. Both the third and fourth tests are good markers of health in okay and bad results; in very bad results, the third test might not show the health as well as the fourth test.\nIn a study, Adam and Benjamin used special colors to see how well parts of the heart were working in 27 people. They used three types of colors: a bright one, a medium one, and a soft one. When they looked at the pictures of the heart, they divided it into 11 parts. They compared the brightest part to the others. If a part didn't show enough color, they said it was either really big, medium, or small. Among the parts that had really big color loss, most showed medium and some showed bright colors. For those with medium color loss, most showed both bright and soft colors. And for those with small color loss, almost all showed both bright and soft colors. In the end, it's like when you have a big, tough puzzle. Sometimes, the harder the puzzle, the harder it is to find the right pieces. This is the same for these special markers that doctors use. They work well when the problem is not too big. But when the problem is very big, one marker might not show everything that the other one can.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "0802b66c0dc3890d44cf581fac9dfd1d4f8776e6024876b9d07fd1d1c3912ae1"}
{"text": "***Is Your Perfect Friend The Right One to Be Your Forever Friend?\nLet's talk about a story about a perfect friend that we all know. It's a lovely story that makes us happy and gives young girls the hope that they will find a true friend forever.\nThis story really inspires - friendship is always inspiring! But the truth is, it's a dream-like version of making friends that doesn't always match the real-life or the truth of what friendship really means - what friendship might mean for a lifetime.\nWhen young girls hear this story, they want to believe that their perfect friend will come like a gust of wind. And for sure, every young boy wants to find his perfect friend - someone to share fun times with. But too many people look for this story-like version of friendship. Liking someone a lot and truly loving them may not always be the same thing. A handsome boy or a pretty girl can make each other feel very special. Many kids have felt this way. You may feel excited, your heart may beat fast, your cheeks may turn red, and you may feel nervous. Love is about feelings!\n\nBut here's the thing - liking someone a lot is easy, just like in the story about Charlotte - but making love last needs effort. You have to do nice things for each other every single day. Doing nice things is important! As we always say, successful love is about doing nice things over and over again.\n\nThis is where the story about Charlotte helps us understand. Liking someone a lot when the clock strikes twelve is easy. Wearing the glass shoe isn't that hard. But as most kids know, starting to like someone is easy, but keeping that love is the hard part.\n\nWhen you start to like someone, it's important to understand that this is the easy part. The rest needs effort. And because of this, our biggest challenge as people who have studied love for a long time is to convince those starting to like someone that the story about Charlotte is just the start of love, not the end.\n\nThe truth is, the love story like Charlotte's doesn't happen often. At some point, someone forgot to tell those who think they are in love that life isn't always fair, kind, and beautiful all the time. Sometimes, what we think love is and the \"Charlotte of love\" are different. Believe us!\nLove is a big deal. Falling in love is one of the biggest things we do in our life. Being in love is a great place to be. That's for sure!\nBut here is the real thing - to fall in love and be in love is not just having feelings for another person, it is a smart choice between two people who decide to love each other forever. And that's a big job!\nNow, let's talk about our idea of \"Charlotte love.\" What does this all mean? It's simple - real love is easy. Real love is a bunch of little things. Real love is, at the end of the day, about doing those things that make love last forever.\nNot seeing what love really means - tricking ourselves into thinking that short-term love is the same as real love - is a mistake that ends a lot of marriages.\nBeing really in love is not just for a little while! Letting our feelings control what we do right now about love and marriage, is a mistake. Real love takes time. Real love is not a Charlotte story; it is a story of promise and love that lasts forever. Loving someone is special. It makes you feel happy. But remember, love can sometimes be tricky. It's not always like the stories we read. For example, the story of Charlotte, where she worked hard to find a true love that would last forever. \n\nLoving someone is good, but be careful. Choosing the right person to marry is very important for a happy marriage. In our book, \"How to Choose the Right Person,\" we talk about the important things you should look for in the person you want to marry. \n\nIn love and marriage, it's the small things that count. Love well!\n\nThis advice comes from CH and ER, experts in love and marriage. They have spent a lot of time studying love and successful marriages all around the world. They even have a long, happy marriage of their own. \n\nIf you want to learn more about love and marriage, you can answer some questions in their Love Quiz or ask them any questions you have about marriage.\n\nThere are other resources about marriage you can find on different websites and books.

{"text": "On a website that helps people find jobs, a story is told about how those who look for workers are changing their methods. Instead of waiting for people to send in their job applications, these people are actively looking for potential workers themselves.\n\nA big company in the US has stopped posting jobs on other websites. They think that these websites don't bring in the right people for the jobs. This company, and others like it, are trying to find the right people for their jobs on professional networking sites before they even post an opening.\n\nBecause there are more and more people looking for jobs, these companies are hiring people who are good at finding and connecting with potential workers, rather than those who are good at dealing with paperwork.\n\nOne company in the US is planning to use fewer job boards in the future. This company wants its workers to find people for jobs like being an analyst or an engineer on professional social networks instead.\n\nThe lady in charge of this company says that they need to find potential workers earlier, before other companies start looking at them. This is a bit like the old way of finding workers, where you had to call lots of people to find the right one.\nAlmost one fourth of businesses want to use less of the websites that help them find workers this year, a survey in December said. At the same time, almost 80% said they want to use different ways to find workers this year, like asking their employees if they know someone or using websites like a popular social media site.\n\nA food company in FR country cut the number of jobs it put on the websites that help find workers by more than half since the time when many businesses were not doing well. The person in charge of finding new workers, called Alice, said the number of people who want to work for them increased a lot. But, many of these people were not right for the job.\n\nAlice said, \"We had to spend a lot of extra time looking at all these people who wanted to work for us, but it did not help us.\" Now, they are looking for different types of people who can help find new workers, like those who are good at finding people who are already working for other businesses.\n\nBusinesses are changing their plans as they start to hire more people again after the time when many businesses were not doing well. Between a time in one year and the same time in the next year, the number of jobs that were open increased by 32%.\n\nPeople who were scared to leave their jobs, and those who did not have a job, are starting to look for new jobs too. In a year, from one winter to the next, people looking for workers saw more and more people wanting to work. This was good news for job notice boards, even when some businesses didn't use them as much. Some of the biggest notice boards knew they had to work harder to keep people happy. \nA company called M company plans to use a new tool that helps pick the best people for the job, says the big boss, Thomas. They have been testing this tool since last year. \nA company from PE city, called P company, worries that depending too much on job notice boards might not be good. \nThere was a story in a big newspaper about this. \nSome people talked about this on a website.

{"text": "Story Time: A Long Time Ago\nMadison and William were helping their big boy get ready for a big step - going to school. The middle-aged parents wanted to help with school costs and have a few fun family trips before school time comes. \n\n\"We had a school savings jar but we lost some pennies because of the hard times,\" Madison said. \n\nThey also thought about paying their house loan with a home piggy bank, which had a little bit of growth. \n\nAnd the time when they don't have to work anymore? They hadn't really thought about it, they said. \n\nMadison and William had saved $21,688 in their retirement jars, $30,759 in their other retirement jars, $25,847 in their group savings jars, $4,357 in a special savings jar, $6,520 in special paper savings, $6,377 in regular savings, and $2,500 in their everyday jar. They also had school savings worth $19,881, and William will get a reward when he stops working.\n\nThey asked Benjamin, a wise money guide from the money castle in the MO town, to help Madison and William check their school plans, money choices, and savings for when they stop working.\n\n\"They want to help him with up to $20,000 a year for four years,\" Benjamin said. \"He will start school soon, and school costs more every year, so this $80,000 help might feel more like $100,000.\"\nAdam and Bella want to save money for school. They can put their money in a special place called a 529 plan. If they use the money for school, they don't have to pay extra money called tax.\n\nAdam said, \"They should put more money in the 529 plan to help pay for future school costs. It might be good to pay for the early years of school themselves so the money in the 529 plan can grow.\"\n\nAdam thinks the 529 plan should be used carefully because they might need the money in less than five years.\n\nBut saving for when they stop working is also important.\n\nAdam says there are three big things to think about for when they stop working: How much money will they get, how much will they spend and how much tax will they have to pay, and how long will they work?\n\n\"Adam and Bella are doing a great job with how they spend their money compared to how much they earn,\" he said.\n\nOne thing they don't know is what will happen to Bella's special work money called a pension because the NJ state is having money problems.\n\nAdam thought about different things that could happen to see how Adam and Bella could reach their goals and when they could stop working if they want to.\n\nAdam thinks the best plan is for Bella to work until she is 60 and Adam to work until he is 62. In this plan, they would get a little more money each year. When David turned a bit older, he could start getting money from his retirement fund. This was also the time when he could get money from a special fund for older people. \n\nIn this story, we imagine that David and his friends, Melanie and William, continue to buy the same things they always do. They also have to pay a lot of money every year for school.\n\nHOW TO SAVE MORE\n\nDavid and his friends need to save more money for when they stop working. Melanie should put money into her retirement fund. Since they don't pay a lot of money in taxes, Melanie should try to put as much money as she can into another retirement fund -- maybe $5,000 in a year if she can. They should also start a fund for William, said Mr. B.\n\nMr. B also said their savings should be split into two parts. One part should grow a lot, and the other part should be steady and safe. This would make them feel sure about reaching their goals.\n\n\"Making the safe part of their savings less affected by changes in money value would be a smart move,\" Mr. B said. \"Also adding a special kind of saving that keeps up with the cost of things would protect against prices going up.\"\n\nMr. B said they need to spread out the growing part of their savings, and should include different kinds of investments, making their savings less likely to go up and down a lot.\n\nUsing money from their house to pay off the house loan could be a bit risky.\n\"If we knew that things would stay cheap, then using the house savings would be smart as it is much cheaper, but it can change and has no set time,\" said Benjamin. \nAs time goes on, Benjamin thinks the cost of the house savings might go up, maybe a lot, compared to the house cost.\nThey need to figure out if they like a set cost or a cheaper cost that might change.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "5eaf4aff295d240f0b1dc94e0f787b85792e3ed5a36fbda6dd305fda3536e344"}

It's not just for Halloween anymore, and everyone's always eager to hear news about its sequel!\n\nA while back, we found out that the sequel to this popular movie is actually happening. At a big meeting for movie makers, it was shared that the sequel will be released on a very popular movie platform. The person chosen to direct the movie is known for directing other popular movies.\n\nAt the moment, a project with no name or date is listed as the director's most recent work. This might not be the sequel we are waiting for, but it is officially announced, which fits what we know about the sequel.\n\nAlice, who played a character in the first movie, talked about it on a radio show. She gave the fans the news they've been waiting for. It seems that Bella and Sarah, who were also in the first movie, are still involved. This is not a big surprise given the enthusiasm we've heard from the actors, especially Bella, about the project.\nA news website shared that Charlotte talked about having many phone chats with Bella and Beth. They talked a lot about a story they all liked. They still need to decide where and when they will tell this story. But they all agree that if everything goes well, they would love to do it.\n\nWhat we can understand from this is that they are still planning everything.

{"text": "Fun Facts about Movies\n\"Did you know? Kids watch a lot of movies in a year, but not all of them at the movie theater. Some they pay for, some they don't...\"\nWe had a chat with a man named Cameron, who works for a movie company and a magazine, both about movies. Cameron knows a lot of fun facts about movies because he's been studying how people watch movies in our country. He's been doing this for a long time, so he's full of interesting numbers and facts!\nCameron told us about his study and is very happy with what he found out.\nHe asked almost 20,000 people about how they watch movies and found out a lot of things. All these people really love movies, just like you and me.\nHere are some fun things he found out...\nOn average, people watch 120 movies a year. Not all of these movies are watched at the movie theater, though. Out of those 120, only 17 are seen at the theater and the rest are watched at home or somewhere else. And out of those rest, a lot of them are watched for free. This includes watching movies on TV that you don't have to pay for.\nPeople like watching things in different ways. Some people like to buy DVDs, some people like to watch things on special movie channels, and some people like to watch things on the internet. Sometimes, people also share movies using small things like USB sticks. \n\nPeople also like to talk about movies on the internet. Some people plan to go to the movies with their friends on a website called Facebook. They also like to say they enjoy movie pages on Facebook. Some people write about movies on a website called Twitter, and some people follow their favorite movie stars. \n\nPeople like different types of movies too. Some people only like big, exciting movies. They watch a lot of TV and think going to the movies is too expensive. Some people mostly like big, exciting movies, but they also like other kinds of movies. They use Facebook and the internet a lot. Some people mostly like smaller, different movies. They go to the movies a lot and watch a lot of DVDs. Some people only like smaller, different movies. They don't share movies with others and they don't watch a lot of DVDs. There were some groups of people who had interesting ideas about movies. For example, many people who liked big hit movies were willing to pay the same price or even more to watch a movie in a different way at the same time it came out in theaters. This number was a bit less for people who only liked big hit movies, and even less for people who mostly liked smaller movies or only liked smaller movies.\n\nThis study was trying to learn how movie fans feel about how they watch movies and the whole journey of a movie. It took a lot of time and money, but it's a very big and important study about movies.\n\nAfter spending a long time looking at the results of the study, they are going to use them for many things. They will share the results with other people who work in media. The results will help them understand how people make decisions about watching movies, how reviews and media influence people, and how to advertise and influence people in the best way.\n\nWith people who work in publicity, marketing, research, and digital, and also a main company that buys media, this big effort will help the company work together on its ideas and plans.\nA new magazine, called FM magazine, is here. It was made by a big company. The first two magazines were given away in stores. They printed 500,000 of them. A third one is coming soon. This magazine is special because it talks about movies.\n\nMr. William explains how they started this magazine. He says that things have changed. People are now using technology a lot. They use it to choose what they want and when they want it. They use things like tablets. Because of this, people who work in advertising had to change their way of thinking.\n\nBefore, they would make a good movie preview and wait for people to come and see it. But now, Mr. William says, that doesn't work anymore. They decided that they needed to talk more directly to the people. That's why they made FM magazine.\n\nThe magazine talks about movies from their company. It's like a display for good movies. People really liked it. It's very useful for them. The magazine is for people in the UK who distribute good independent movies. It talks about smart movies.\n\nWhat's really cool is that the magazine also talks about watching movies at home. It's just as important as watching movies in the theater. \"We try to help our friends with what they need. If they like to focus on fun at home, we are glad to do that. We want to help them share their things. Most of the time, we work with things you can see at the movie place, but fun at home is also a big part of what we do,\" he ends.\nThe next story is set to come out when the flowers start to bloom.\nNote: This story talks about things like movie places, sharing things, and having fun.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "b6015033e15987b0776bbf854ae7d69658d4eeefc9ab1ad768b3afb8c0d2b028"}

Many of the superheroes didn't make it in the first big fight. The remaining superheroes include \"Captain A\" played by Cameron, \"Big Green Guy\" played by Mark, \"Black W\" played by Sophia, \"War M\" played by David, and of course, \"Metal Man\" played by Ryan. \"Captain M\" played by Bella also joins the team.\nIn this movie \"Small Man\" and \"Flying Bug\" also join the team played by Patrick and Emma. The movie has lots of surprises. \"Blue Lady\" played by Katherine and \"Talking Raccoon\" voiced by Benjamin from The Galaxy Team also join the team.\nThe movie has many happy and sad moments but it's a good story with some surprising parts. Unfortunately, \"Kitty\" did not join \"Captain M\" in the movie. \"Talking Raccoon\" is cute, but it's not the same.\nThe film had fun highs and lows but the finish was fantastic. It had some amazing unexpected moments. Even if you don't like the team of superheroes, their big final adventure is something you should definitely see.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "7c09c2b9134c09f1fbfed7eeef70319a3be3c2996aa00ac1b12fd6d0fb28ef49"}
{"text": "Long ago, a man named Sam was a very important helper. Sam was a lawyer who helped people in trouble for many, many years. He was very good at his job. He helped a lot of people who didn't have a lot of money and were in very big trouble. \n\nThere were two important rules made by some very important people. One rule said that if someone finds something that can help the person in trouble, they must show it to the helper. The second rule said that if someone doesn't have a lot of money and is in big trouble, the people in charge must find a helper for them.\n\nOne day, another person wanted to know more about Sam. He asked Sam a lot of questions. He found out that Sam had been a helper for a very long time. He had helped people in more than 300 very big troubles. He saved 16 people from very bad punishment. He also helped make things fair for everyone and tried to make sure that all helpers did their job well.\n\nOne interesting thing about Sam was that he had a special mat outside his office. It said: \"Come back with a warrant.\" This made the person who was asking questions like Sam even more. This is the final piece I'm writing for this place. Starting next week, I will start writing every day for the WA newspaper about being fair and justice. I had a chat with David, who is a good way to finish my time here and the year.\n\nDavid is one of the few people still helping others with their legal problems, who was also helping before a big change happened in 1963. How did this big change affect the way we handle problems with the law in our country?\n\nThis big change made things a little better, at least at the beginning. The younger helpers tried to take it seriously and would try to do the right thing. But there was still a way of doing things that kept things hidden. So, they would keep it a secret from their bosses when they gave us evidence that helped our side.\n\nSo, doing what the big court said and giving evidence that helped the people they accused would get them in trouble?\n\nYes. You can't change the way things are done quickly. The decision gave us a way to fight when evidence was kept from us after someone was found guilty, but it didn't change the way things were done. Change has come slowly. Very slowly. And in some places, like the OR place, the ruling was just ignored. The problem of not giving evidence became really bad under a former and longtime boss named Cameron. Not giving evidence was normal, and it's silly to say he didn't know about it. There was a very good man who knew when things were going wrong. \n\nWhy is it hard to get people who decide if someone did something wrong to do their job right?\n\nWell, it's a mix of how things work and the type of people. First, the kind of person who wants to decide if others did wrong is usually someone who wants to be important. They want to have power, not money. Second, you need to see what is rewarded in this job. The best way for these people to get noticed is by deciding a lot of people did wrong. There's no reward for not accusing someone to be fair. No one gets praised for not accusing others, or being fair to those who may have done very bad things. When you mix these two things, you get an environment that doesn't care, especially when they've already accused someone publicly.\n\nThese problems seem tough to solve. Looking back, do you think things have gotten worse?\n\nWe have a nice and beautiful system for deciding who did wrong. But it has been misused by bad people who decide if others did wrong, bad police, and judges who don't care. We need to think about what type of person we want in these jobs, and we need to understand the type of people who really want these jobs. When you look at these two things, I think you'll often find that they don't match.\nImagine if I was in charge of an office and I had to pick my team. Instead of waiting for people to come to me, I would go out and find them. The people who really want the job might not always be the best for it. These are just my thoughts, not rules. But I think it's a good way to think about building a team. \n\nWhat if we had to pick between voting for people to be judges or just choosing them? Well, I don't really like either idea. \n\nWhy, you ask? I think judges should only work for a certain amount of time, like 10 years. It doesn't matter if they got the job because people voted for them or because they were chosen. The problem with voting for judges is that they need money for their campaigns. This can lead to tricky situations. \n\nNot everyone can pay for their own campaigns. But from what I've seen, those who can usually turn out to be good and fair judges. This is because they have other options and the job isn't just a stepping stone for them. They also don't owe anything to anyone else. \n\nChoosing judges, though, can also lead to problems. \n\nIs there anything else I would change? Well, I think judges should work on all types of cases, not just one kind. Sometimes, when people can't agree on how to use money, they argue. It's good for judges to handle different types of cases. This helps them learn about the world and understand people better. Sometimes, judges who only look at crime cases can forget to feel sad for people in trouble.\nIt's important to know that most judges used to be people who help make sure laws are followed. These judges and the people who help follow the laws can become friends. They go to the same parties.\nWhy aren't there more judges who used to help people who might have broken the law? Is it because they can't, or don't want to?\nSome people think that becoming a judge isn't an option for them. They believe it's hard for a person who helps those who might have broken the law to become a judge. This might be true. But it's also true that some people just don't want to be a judge. Judges and people who make sure laws are followed are very similar. But people who help those who might have broken the law are different.\nIt's important to say that we have some really good judges in LA state, and also some good people who help make sure laws are followed. But there are more not-so-good ones than good ones.\nSo what does a person need to be good at helping those who might have broken the law?\nBeing dedicated. I haven't been home for dinner in a long time. My friend should have stopped being my friend a long time ago. \nYou might think this job needs you to be okay with things not going your way a lot. Do lawyers who help people who might have done bad things always think things are not good?\nNo, I don't believe so. I think it's the other way round. I always think about a funny story about two 11-year-old brothers. One of the boys always saw the good in everything, which made his parents worry that others might trick him easily. His brother always saw the bad in people, which his parents worried would make him unhappy and lonely. So, they took the boys to a person who understands how people think and feel, who suggested a test. Following his advice, the next big gift-giving day, the parents bought the boy who often felt sad every toy he could possibly want. The boy who always felt happy woke up that morning to find several piles of horse dirt. A week later, they took the boys back to the person who understands feelings. He asked the boy who often felt sad if he had a good big gift-giving day. \n\"It was not good,\" he said. \"I got all of these new toys, but I can't play with any of them because I'm afraid they'll get broken.\"\nThe person then asked the happy boy the same question. \"It was amazing!\" he said excitedly. \"I got a horse! I just haven't found it yet!\"\nLawyers who help people who might have done bad things deal with a lot of not-so-nice things. I think the thing that keeps us going -- or at least the thing that keeps me going -- is knowing that with all those not-so-nice things, sooner or later you're going to find something good.\nWhat are these special things we're talking about? Finding mistakes in decisions? Helping a person who didn't do anything wrong?\nYes, those things matter. But they don't happen a lot. There are other, easier things to achieve. Like showing that someone didn't follow the rules, or proving that someone hid important information. Even in small cases, it feels good to make sure everyone plays fair.\nMost of the time, the people who need help from lawyers have done something wrong. And most of the time, they will have to face the consequences. Is it hard to know that you won't always win?\nI believe that winning isn't always about proving someone's innocence. It's about making sure everyone does their job properly and fairly.\nBut let's talk about being found guilty. It's important. And lawyers should help even those who have done wrong. Everyone should get a fair chance.\nHere's something else to think about: What happens when people are found guilty? It helps us learn and make better rules. When you're not found guilty, there's no need to challenge the decision. People only argue when they believe something is wrong. It's when they argue that they say their friends' rights weren't respected. This is how rules that protect everyone are made. Because someone didn't agree, we now have rules that make sure everyone is treated fairly. Isn't that interesting? Because someone disagreed, we now have rules that keep everyone safe.\n\nWhat do you think needs to be improved in how we decide who did wrong and who didn't?\n\nWe need to understand that it's a big deal. When someone is not allowed to be free, that's the biggest punishment we can give them, other than not letting them live. Everyone who helps decide who did wrong - the people in charge, the ones who say who did wrong, the police, the ones who defend those accused - can forget about this because they do it every day. They can forget what's really happening when they make these decisions.\n\nLet me explain. We've known for a long time that when someone says they saw something, they might be wrong. Very wrong. There's a lot of proof that says so. But until we could check if someone did wrong based on what people said they saw - sometimes four, five, six people - these sayings were thought to be the best proof. That should scare us. But those who decide who did wrong are very slow in changing how they use these sayings. They still think it's very important today. They're not very interested in looking at old cases again.\nThere's a big problem with the way we handle people who break rules. Our system is supposed to keep us safe from people who might harm us. But sometimes, it doesn't work that way.\n\nImagine this: someone is punished for a rule they didn't break, while the person who actually broke the rule is still out there. That's not right, is it? But there's an even bigger problem. We don't know the right way to punish people who break rules. \n\nLet's pretend we have two people who did the same wrong thing on the same night. The first person has four kids and his family might lose their home. Or maybe he needs money for something he shouldn't be buying. He's very scared and nervous. He goes up to someone, acts very mean, and takes their money. The person he takes the money from is very scared too.\n\nOn the other hand, the second person is very calm. He walks up to someone, puts his hand on their back, and calmly tells them he has a stick in his pocket. There were two mean men. One man asked another man to give him his money bag. The man gave it to him because he didn't want to get hurt. The mean man walked away. The man who lost his money bag was mad, but he was not very scared. He didn't think he was going to get hurt really bad.\n\nThe second mean man is more dangerous. He might hurt someone very badly. The first mean man is scared because he knows it's not good to take things that are not his. He feels bad for the man he took the money bag from. He took the money bag because he really needed it. That doesn't make it okay. But he did it because he was scared. The second mean man doesn't feel bad for other people. He doesn't care if he hurts them. \n\nWe decide to punish people because we are scared and want to get back at them, not because they are the most dangerous. \n\nIf you want to be a judge or a helper for the judge, remember to be kind and know that having a lot of power can make people act not nice. Power can sneak up on even the nicest people. Always remember that and watch out for it.\nHow can someone remember to stay humble? Well, I spoke with some people who used to be in charge of making big decisions. They told me that sometimes, they forgot to think of others because they were so focused on their jobs. This is something we all need to be careful about. \n\nI came up with an idea about this. It might sound funny, but I believe we need to be reminded every day about our responsibilities. I believe that when someone gets a higher position, they should lose some of their privileges. For example, the person with the most authority should park their car farthest from the building. This way, they will have to walk the longest distance to get to their office. This will remind them twice a day that they are just like everyone else.\n\nThink about the chairs in an office. The people in charge usually have the most comfortable ones. But as you go down the line, the chairs become less and less comfortable. When new leaders come in, they often change the seating arrangement. But a good leader should choose the least comfortable chair for themselves.\n\nThese might seem like small things, but they are very important. People with a lot of power sometimes forget to stay humble, not only in their jobs but also in their daily lives. It's especially crucial for them to remember this because their decisions can affect other people's lives.\nWhat if we could change the rules in places like parks and schools to make things better and fair? But, it's not that easy. The best leaders are often the ones who don't want to be leaders. So, how do we find these good leaders?\n\nThere will always be problems because of this. But we can try to make these problems happen less often. Maybe if we make sure people do their jobs well, it could help. But, it doesn't happen enough right now. We have to try to do better than this.\n\nSo, is there any good news?\nYes, I think things are slowly getting better. We've learned from our mistakes. So now, we don't just talk about if things are wrong, but how much they're wrong and how to make them right. This has made us more humble.\n\nAnd remember, our system of fairness is really good. Things aren't perfect yet, but they're much better than before. When I first started, things were not this good. There are still problems, like people doing bad things. But now, they have to hide when they do these things. That shows they know it's not right. Things are getting better, but not fast enough. \nSometimes, people who make rules can remind us of characters in stories. One person who makes rules and a funny hat-wearing character from a famous story book look alike.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "2c140511b0dc86dbfa1f1a154c5e4234a80c6aff6c92fd0c2814daab3f8f7578"}

{"text": "A company called SH is helping small shops send their items to customers easily. This service might attract small shops away from a big company like AM. Inside the office of SH, their goal is to compete with AM by providing a better system for selling things online. SH has grown so much that it is now worth more than two very old companies in CA country.\n\nSending items to customers on the same day they order is what most online shoppers expect. But for small shops, this can be very tricky. That's where SH comes in, says a man named Ryan. Ryan runs a company that makes natural skin care products. His company sends as many as 5,000 orders every day from their own warehouse in SJ city, CA country. This is fine for customers living on the West Coast but it can take up to a week to send their bamboo powder and coconut bath soap to other parts of the US. The company thought about setting up another warehouse on the East Coast but it seemed too hard.\n\nRyan explains that the toughest part is making sure the packages go the right way and the orders are sent based on what a customer buys and what items are available at each site. SH has made a system to figure this out. Ryan, who started his company in the early 21st century, says, \"This is something I've wanted for years.\"\nShopify had a big idea to help online sellers. They said they would store and send the sellers' things for them. This made people think Shopify could be as big as a very famous online store. \n\nEven if Shopify is not as big yet, people think their idea is good. It can help Shopify keep their customers, fight off other businesses, and make more money. This could even help small sellers who are not happy with the famous online store, which now likes big brands more.\n\n\"An online seller might be making a lot of money, but they are having trouble sending their things to buyers. This could stop them from doing well,\" says Thomas, who used to work at Shopify and now helps people start online businesses. \"This is a big chance for Shopify.\"\n\nShopify started in 2006 with a simple idea: give us 29 dollars a month and we'll give you everything you need to start an online business. Not all Shopify customers do well, but the better they do, the more money Shopify makes from fees and expensive subscriptions. Its top service, which has famous customers, can cost at least 2,000 dollars per month.\nThere's a big company called SH company that people really like. It was started in 2015 and has done very well, but it has also lost some money. The company helps other businesses sell things online. However, some people worry that SH company depends too much on a few big businesses. They also worry that smaller businesses come and go too often.\nTo help with this, SH company is working on a new way to deliver things. They want to help businesses send their products to customers more easily and cheaply. They're working with other companies to make this happen. They want to be able to send anything from 10 to 10,000 items from places in NV, CA, and TX. \nA man named Henry, who helps run SH company, says it's important to keep trying new things for the future.\nLots of shopkeepers like using Shopville because they can make their own shop on their website. This is different from being part of a big online marketplace like the one in AM city. The new delivery service also allows them to put their shop's logo on the delivery boxes. This is something not all delivery companies offer.\n\nDavid, who sells his things on the AM marketplace and uses their delivery network, says that the US company has a fast delivery service for beauty products. But, Shopville gives him more control. \"You can change your own website however you like,\" he says. \"You are in charge.\"\n\nRachel, who sells eco-friendly makeup through Shopville, says she will wait until Shopville fixes any problems before trying the delivery service. Others say it might be hard and costly to stop using the current delivery services they have contracts with.\n\nHappy Shopkeepers\n\nShopville says it might make its own delivery centers in the future. While Shopville's money manager, Alice, has said that the company will be able to pay for this with fees from the new service, some experts say they won't make much money at first because Shopville will need to offer discounts to attract shopkeepers.\n\nThe big marketplace in AM city might not be scared of Shopville right now. But Shopville is still a good alternative to the big company in SE city. \"The big marketplace in AM city is all about making the customer happy,\" says Adam, a top expert at BI place. \"Some people try to take a lot of money from shop owners to give to customers.

{"text": "In a place where people usually enjoy sweet treats and warm drinks, there's also a special type of service called Cloud CAFE provided by a company. This service helps businesses by offering a way to use and share applications that are stored in the cloud, which is a place on the internet where data can be stored and accessed.\n\nThe Cloud CAFE service makes it easier and faster to share these applications. It helps teams who work with computers and technology to manage and organize this sharing process. They can do all of this while making sure the applications are safe, fast, and reliable.\n\nThe boss of the company, let's call him Kevin, talks about how important this service is. He says that the people who create and manage these applications have a lot of responsibilities. They need to make sure the applications are always ready to use, work well for the people using them, and are safe from any harmful attacks. With the way technology is advancing, these applications are updated very often, and it's the job of the operations team to manage these updates and make sure everything is working properly.\n\nThe idea for Cloud CAFE came from the company's own research. They noticed many businesses were starting to use the cloud more, especially for creating new apps and services. Kevin noted that modern application development is more about using services rather than just creating products.\n\"Today, when you move stuff to the cloud, you don't have to worry about the hard parts like servers or storage, they are already available. The front part of the app comes from balancing, safety, and speed up. These things were not easy to get before.\"\n\nStarting CAFE has been helpful in creating a better bond between IT and DevOps teams. Says Adam, \"It is not just the IT people's job anymore, so we built something that connects that gap. It lets the app owner and DevOps use these services for their apps and control the rules in an easy way.\"\n\nIn the past, using the cloud was a little special. Only a few businesses used it, mostly to try it out. Since then, the cloud has become more common, and more users are joining each day. Seeing this, Appcito thought that it was time to start this new service.\n\n\"The cloud has become common,\" Adam says. \"A year and a half ago when we started (making CAFE), it was clear that most businesses had finally started using both the private and public cloud. If you look at the market, big companies like MA company, GC company and IB company saw that trend and started promoting the use of the public cloud.\"\n\nAs the cloud became more popular, many companies began to use it for making apps. Adam tells us that there are several ways that CAFE can help. First, it makes sure the app is always there if a business uses many computers for their work in the cloud. \"If you have an app, you need to make sure it's always there,\" Adam says. \"If you have many computers, you have to make sure you're talking with them and the users. Next, you have to make sure it is quick for the users.\" \n\nGiving apps to users is all about being fast and good. They will notice right away if an app doesn't work right. \"Different studies show that if your app doesn't start within two seconds, users have to switch to another device,\" Adam says. \"We have ways that let you give those apps to the device without the writer or developer having to do anything.\"\n\nIn the future, Appcito plans to keep giving businesses solutions for their work in the cloud, and look for chances to help their customers more during the entire app life. \"Our goal is to help business owners with their work in the cloud,\" Adam says. \"CAFE is our first product for the front part of work, but if you look at apps, there is a lot of changes happening. We see a lot of chances to help at different times in the work process, and we hope to become a much bigger part of the team's tools.\"\nLearning about buying things wisely\nStaying safe from sharing too much information\nTwo big companies team up to help in case of emergencies\nLearning from the story of a big tech company and a media company\nNew improvements to the tools we use to save information\nHouses in the future\nLearning about different types of clouds\nTwo companies work together for safe emails", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "a262f31fe4c623c4cdcf2ae57ce30f46d9bab4f48339752215badae84ab3261a"}
{"text": "A new rule about saving money for when you get older was made. It was made by a man named Sharif on a day in November 2020. He told us about a new law that was made at the end of 2019. This new law changes some things about how we can save money for when we get older:\n\n1. You can start getting some money from your savings when you are 72 years old, not 70.\n2. You can keep adding money to your savings even when you are older than 70.\n3. You can give money to help others and it will be counted as if you saved it, but there are some new rules about how this works.\n4. Before this new law, if someone left you their savings when they passed away, you could take out a little bit of money at a time for as long as you lived. Now, you have to take all the money out within 10 years.\n\nBecause of these new rules, some old ways of saving money are not useful anymore. So, we need to think of new ways to save money for when we get older.\nLet's talk about saving and giving in simple ways. One way is to change a type of saving called an IRA into another type called a Roth IRA. You can then give this to someone directly, or put it in a special trust.\n\nAnother way is to use a trust that gives to both people and charities. You can put the money you get from an IRA into this trust. This trust will give money to the people you choose and then give the rest to a charity.\n\nYou can also use trusts that can give to many people. This lets the people you choose benefit from the IRA you leave them.\n\nAnother way is to use life insurance. You can take some money out of your savings and use it to pay for life insurance. This insurance can then be given to your family without them having to pay taxes on it.\n\nSometimes, it's best to just keep things the same. This is because many people who get an IRA don't use it for a long time. And, those who do use it often use all of it within 10 years.\n\nNo matter what method you choose, it's good to talk to someone who knows about money to make sure your plan works for you.\n\nThe information here is given by a man who is an expert on money.

{"text": "Once there was a cat named Victor. Victor had a problem. He was living in a place that he rented from a man named Ethan. Victor and Ethan had agreed on how much Victor would pay to live there each year. But, one day, Ethan told Victor that he had to pay more every month. Victor didn't want to pay more, so he told Ethan he didn't agree to this.\n\nEthan then sent Victor a letter, saying Victor had to pay the new amount or leave. Victor was upset because he didn't think this was fair. He said there was a rule in the FR country that Ethan couldn't ask for more money like this. This rule was a part of a special law that was made to help people like Victor.\n\nThis law said that people who rented places to live couldn't ask for more money for a whole year after a certain date. Victor said this law protected him from Ethan's request for more money. The people who make the rules agreed with Victor. They said that Ethan couldn't ask for more money because of this special law. A long time ago, there was a rule about not raising the cost of living places. This rule started in the month when spring starts and lasted for a whole year. After that year, the rule didn't work anymore. The rule didn't say it would work for times before it started. When we make rules, we only talk about what the rule says. So, we can't say this rule worked for times before it started because it doesn't say so.\n\nThere is something called \"By necessary rule understanding.\" This means that every rule has everything it needs to do what it's supposed to do. Also, it has everything needed to make sure the things it gives, like rights or powers, work well. This includes everything we can understand from the rule. \n\nFor example, in the case of a soda company, a workers' group wanted to be the only group that could talk for the supervisors of the soda company. They asked someone who helps solve problems at work to let them be that group. The helper said yes and also said that the workers' group was part of a bigger group. There were also two other groups for workers at the soda company. A big company wanted to challenge the group of people who make decisions at their workplace. They said these people can't be part of a bigger group that also includes regular workers from the same company. They asked a big group of people who make rules about work to look into this. When their request was denied, they went to the highest court. \n\nThe group of decision-makers, on a day in the past, decided to leave the bigger group. The company also questioned why people who are in charge of money and collecting money are in the group of decision-makers. The court decided that people who are in charge of money and managing money are very important and they should not be allowed to join the group of decision-makers. \n\nThe court also said that while the work rules say that the people who make big decisions can't join or help any work groups, this also means that very important workers can't join too. According to a rule, what is suggested in a rule is as important as what is said directly.\n\nThe court also said something like this: \"Rules that help the person who is accused are applied even to things in the past.\" This means that we should encourage understanding that helps, and hold back comments or expressions that can hurt. In the story of two friends, Adam and Nicholas, they did something really bad. Nicholas then decided to marry the girl they hurt. This made him free from being punished. But Adam, who didn't marry the girl, had to keep being punished. He thought that he should also be free just like Nicholas. But the people who make the rules said \"no\". They explained that the rules say only the person who marries the girl can be free. This is because our rules are made to look forward, not backward. They are made for what will happen next, not what has happened before. This is also the same for our big rule book. A simple rule we all know is: Things we like should be increased, and things we don't like should be decreased. This rule was made because of kindness and understanding. So, the person asking was allowed to go free right away. \n\nHere's another rule we should remember: \"What we say generally, we mean generally.\" This means that the words we use in important rules should be understood in their usual and broadest sense, unless we show that we want the word to have a different or smaller meaning.\n\nFor example, in a very big case about voting rules, Judge Cameron used this rule. He agreed that the rules in the voting law should match the rules in the big law book, which means that only the winning Senators and the party representatives can be announced, not the President and Vice-president. This is what's written in Section 4 of the voting law. There was a rule about voting from far away. It said people could choose the big leader, the helper leader, and some important group members. But there was a problem. The rule also said that a group could say who won. However, the big paper of rules says that only a special group can say who the big leader and helper leader are. So, there was a lot of talking about this.\n\nThe person in charge said that the words in the rule were too big. They covered even the big leader and helper leader. But, we know that if a rule is for everyone, we should understand it that way. So, we can't change the meaning. If we say the group can tell who won, we give them a power that the big paper of rules says is for the special group only. That's not okay.\n\nThere's a saying - \"What is said for everyone should be understood by everyone.\" This means that if a word is for everyone, we shouldn't limit its meaning if there's no reason to. For example, there was a person who had children without being married. The children's father was a son from a proper family. There was a boy named Pablo. When he went away, two people, a lady and a man, started talking about who should get the things Pablo left behind. The lady said, \"Pablo's children should get his things.\" But the man said, \"No, I should get his things.\" They couldn't agree, so they asked some important people to help them decide. These important people said, \"It depends on whether Pablo's children are his real children or not. If they are, they can get his things. If they're not, they can't.\" A wise man named Ruben also said, \"When we say 'family', it means everyone related to Pablo, unless we're talking about specific people.\" So, \"family\" includes all of Pablo's relatives, not just some of them. A big, important group made a decision about who should get something special. There's a rule that says, \"A big rule does not change a small, special rule.\" This means that a big, general rule doesn't change the little, specific rules. \n\nIn a story about a man named Victor and a man named Samuel, Victor tried to give a job to a man named Liam. Victor said he could do this because of a rule from a long time ago that allows people like him to give jobs to others. But Samuel disagreed. He said that there was another rule, made even longer ago, that said only a very important person could give out that job. \n\nThe big, important group agreed with Samuel. They said that a new, general rule doesn't change an old, specific rule unless it's very clear that it's supposed to. So, Victor couldn't give the job to Liam.\n\nThere's another rule that says, \"Sometimes things are very tough, but that's how the rule is written.\"\nThere was a big problem in a town. A man named Marcelo did something very bad to his own daughter, Merly. Marcelo said he didn't do it, but later he said that he did. The judge decided that Marcelo had to go away forever because of his bad actions.\n\nMarcelo's friend, who was helping him, said that Marcelo should not be punished so much. He asked for kindness for Marcelo. But the big court in the city said that Marcelo should still be punished. They said that being kind is good, but only for those who deserve it.\n\nAnother man, Justice Jose, said that a father should always protect his family and not hurt them. He said that Marcelo was very wrong for what he did. He thought Marcelo should be punished a lot, so he won't hurt Merly's younger sisters. In simpler words, there's a saying that goes, \"The rule may seem really tough, but that's just how it is.\" So, the big court agreed with the smaller court, and told the person who did something wrong to make things right. There were many more topics talked about, but they're not really important. The main thing to remember is that sometimes, rules can be hard, but we all have to follow them.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "42beaca83cf7b3443f2aeeccfd4f45bd5b117c9bcf883d3f2598160d25564251"}

They can also get help if they need a new house, need money for school or if something bad happens. Frank explained this.\nDavid talked about how local leaders are important.

{"text": "This story is about a brave woman named Madison. Madison was not scared to be different. She believed in doing what was right, even if others didn't agree. She said, \"I do what I think is right. I don't worry about what others think of me. I believe in myself.\" \n\nSome people didn't like Madison because she was different. A man named Henry said she was like a loud and scary animal. But there was also a man named Robert, who didn't like to say nice things about people. Even Robert said that Madison was a good person. \n\nMadison is remembered for a special book she wrote. She wrote this book to say that women should be treated fairly, just like men. This was her reply to some changes made in FR country. But those changes were not fair because they only helped men. Long ago, in the FR country and many other places, ladies did not have as many rights as they do today. This happened in the old times, when many changes were happening. Even in the young US country, some rights of ladies were not recognized, because the rules were mainly about men.\n\nSome people might say that in the old times, ladies wrote because they were bored. But that's not true. A lady named Mary, who was a writer, wrote because she needed to. She chose what to write about.\n\nMany people liked Mary because she was a great writer. When she was in the capital of the UK country, she met with many other writers. She even learned new languages and visited the FR country.\n\nMary wanted to tell all the ladies to be strong, in their minds and bodies. She believed that being soft-hearted, sensitive, and having a good taste did not mean being weak. She wanted ladies to stop using words that made them seem weak.\n\nMary believed that when little girls are told that being pretty is the most important thing, they only focus on looking nice, not on their thoughts or ideas.\n\nMary was respected and played an important role among a group of writers in the capital of the UK country, which included a man named Thomas. A lady wrote many things about why boys and girls should be treated the same. She wanted them to have the same rules and chances to do things. She wrote a very famous book to argue against the idea that girls were not as good as boys. This idea was becoming very popular in the FR country.\n\nNot long after, some countries in Europe started making unfair rules. These rules gave boys more chances and took chances away from girls. For example, boys could decide how long a baby could be fed by their mom. Girls were not allowed to own things like houses and lands.\n\nWhen she was young, this lady saw her mean and always angry dad hurt her mom. She left home to help other people, but came back to take care of her sick mom. When she was almost thirty years old, she took care of her brothers and sisters and also helped her dad.\n\nShe had a daughter, Fiona, without getting married. Later, she got married to a man who was not Fiona's dad. She had another baby, but got very sick and went to heaven. Her second daughter, Mary, grew up and wrote a book about a scary monster. This lady loved everyone and everything in the world. She was not a mean person at all.\nA smart lady named Mary felt very strongly about her own life. She used to say, \"I can't imagine not being around anymore, I can't think of not being me. It seems impossible that I won't exist anymore.\" Sadly, she passed away when she was only 38 years old. But even though it's been a long time since she lived, many people still remember her. We read her letters, think about her ideas, and remember how she lived her life. We still hear her voice and feel her influence, even today.\n\nMary said some important things:\n\"If girls are only taught to depend on others, to do what someone else wants, and to accept whatever is decided for them, even if it's not right, where will it end?...\n\"Girls may have different jobs to do, but they are still people, and the way they do these jobs should be the same.\"\n\"Most of the silly things girls do come from boys treating them poorly. I get upset when I see a boy make a big deal about picking up a handkerchief or closing a door for a girl, when she could have done it herself...\" A smart person does not like to be pampered by someone who thinks they are better. They want to be respected because they deserve it...\n\"Let them be free... or the unfairness that half of people have to put up with will hurt the people who are doing it. Men's goodness will be spoiled by the people they don't respect.\"\n\"If girls are not taught to be as smart as boys, they will stop people from learning more, because truth should be for everyone.\"\n\"Don't girls see how much boys want to make them seem less important, even though they say that girls make them happy?\"\nIn a note to her mom, Victoria (born long ago) wrote, \"Every person should have their own space... a 'quiet place' where they can be alone and think without people who love them coming in and doing whatever they want. And do you know how happy I was to learn that William and Mary believed and did the same thing, a long time ago.\"\n\"As fast as light and as happy as a good idea was the thought that came to me. I found it! What scared me will scare others; and I just need to tell the scary story that kept me awake at night. The next day, I said that I had thought of a story.\"\n-- A woman named Madison created a very unique story: a tale about a strange creature. Madison's mom was also named Madison. Some people tried to say that Madison didn't really write the story, that her friend, a poem writer, did. But there's no real proof of this, only guesses because they didn't think Madison could write a story. \n\"I don't wait for people to give us freedom. No, girls, we won't be valued until we get it ourselves.\"\n-- A woman called Victoria (lived a long time ago).", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "7c7fa5788792fe4e5e7922e205589ee772ab27cbec8d95e97c09ad6749237bad"}

More older people means more jobs helping older people, like taking them to and from fun places -- great jobs for people who finished school.\nBut the problem comes when older people don't act their age. When they act young, they lose their specialness. Just think of any man over 25 wearing shorts with a chain for a wallet. Or any woman over 50 who looks too young. It's scary and sad.\nOlder people, as they get older, should enjoy the changes that come with getting older. You can do and say whatever you want. You can watch movies for less money. You eat dinners early. You can tell people off just for looking at your garden.\nSee, the thing with older people is their unwillingness to let go of the need to be cool -- which they might not have been to begin with. The wish to be young is the least cool thing ever.\nGrowing older, however, is about the coolest thing you can do. And it's the only thing you can do. So why not enjoy it?\nAnd if you don't agree with me, then you, my friend, are not very nice.\nGabriel hosts \"Late Night with Gabriel\" on weekdays. Gabriel works on a big TV channel.

{"text": "Have you ever wondered about tasty drinks that don't have alcohol? There are plenty of new drinks to try, whether you're having fun with friends or just relaxing at home.\n\nPeople's thoughts about alcohol are changing these days. Now, there are many different drinks that don't have alcohol but still taste great. This means you don't have to feel left out when you're at a party and don't want to drink alcohol. I've found lots of yummy and sometimes even healthy drinks in the two and a half years since I stopped drinking alcohol. \n\nLet's talk about a friend named Grace. Grace lives in a big city in BC and is a very creative person who makes art and special medicines. She hasn't had alcohol for about four years. She shared with me that when she stopped drinking, she noticed she wasn't going to see music shows as much.\n\nGrace, who used to work in places where people go to eat and drink, said, \"The money that places where we watch shows make is very connected to alcohol.\" But Grace went on a trip to another city in AB recently. There, she was able to have fun with her friends at different bars, drinking only drinks without alcohol. This was a new experience for her.\n\"Everywhere we went, I could have something different from fizzy drinks or fruit drinks. I didn't feel like I was missing out on the fun,\" she shares.\nHere are some tasty and enjoyable drinks without alcohol you can try, whether you're out with friends or at home.\n1. Drinks Without Alcohol\nAt home, Grace has changed from making drinks at a bar to making drinks without alcohol. These drinks have all the taste of a drink with alcohol, but without any.\n\"Part of enjoying a drink is tasting all the different parts of it, so it needs to have the right mix of taste and tartness,\" she shares. \"Alcoholic drinks have a specific taste and thickness, so if you take an alcoholic drink and take out the alcohol, it's not going to taste as good. I like to find different ways to make tasty drinks by looking at the character of the different ingredients, instead of the drink being about the alcohol.\" For Grace, a good drink maker can make a tasty drink without needing alcohol.\nIn the US, bars without alcohol like the SB bar in AT city and the AB bar in RN city, give people the fun of being in a bar and a list of drinks without alcohol to go with it.\nCompanies like 'L', 'A', 'F', 'E', and 'O' have a variety of drinks without alcohol. So, you can still enjoy a yummy drink even when you don't want alcohol. You can learn how to make your own special drinks with 'D'.\n\n1. Fizzy Waters\nSay goodbye to simple soda water: Fizzy water is becoming popular, and there are many without alcohol. These bubbly (and often without sugar) drinks are a different choice from hard fizzy waters and they are good for staying hydrated and tasty.\n\nNowadays, fizzy water is more than just water with a taste. 'S' adds real fruits like a green citrus fruit, a yellow citrus fruit, a tropical fruit, and a sweet fruit to their fizzy water. Some companies, like 'P', add good bacteria to flavors like spicy citrus and sweet and sour fruit, while others, like 'S', have a variety of fizzy waters with and without caffeine that mix things like tea, fruit juice, and plants to make natural, yummy drinks.\n\nFor most people, \"sober\" means not having anything that changes how you think. A person who is \"C sober\" (short for a sunny state sober) is usually someone who doesn't drink, but does use a plant called cannabis. If you want to stop drinking alcohol but you're still looking for a slightly different feeling, 'L's' type of Hi-Fi Sessions fizzy water has hops, tastes of citrus or berry, and between 2 and 10 tiny bits of a thing called THC -- the thing in cannabis that changes how you think -- per can. If you're trying something new like a special juice for the first time, it's a good idea to try a little bit first and drink it slowly. If you drink too much of it, you might feel worried, but if you have just the right amount, it can make many people feel calm and happy.\n\n3. Special Juice and Grape Juice\nThese days, there are many kinds of special juice and grape juice that don't have anything in them that might make you feel bad. Lots of companies are making sure their drinks are yummy and don't taste like watered-down juice. There are many types of these drinks, like bubbly juice and dark juice, and some companies only make these kinds of drinks. \n\nDavid, who talks on the radio and tells people news, started drinking this special juice instead of the old kind two years ago. He says that this was a big decision that made his life better. David, who used to like the old kind of juice, tells us it's easier to find good special juice than it used to be. \"The special juice is a lot tastier than before, and you can find it in more places now,\" he says.\nA man found some good and affordable non-alcoholic drinks that taste like beer. He enjoyed a drink that tasted like his favorite one from before, and another one that was nice for summer. There are also lots of stores on the internet that sell non-alcoholic wines. There's a place in CA country that makes wine without alcohol by using a special process. \n\nThere's another drink called Kombucha. It's made with tea, sugar, and some other things. People say it's good for you and helps with digestion, gives energy, and helps clean out bad stuff from your body. Because it's a little fizzy and sour, and looks like beer, many places serve it instead of beer. \n\nA man named Gabriel, who makes Kombucha, says more people are looking for drinks that are good for them. Gabriel wanted to make a special drink. This drink was like a popular healthy drink, but even better. He and his friends made a new kind of drink that stays good for a long time on the shelf. This drink was mixed with something that can help people feel less worried, sleep better, and not hurt so much. \n\nGabriel and his friends looked at all the good things about the healthy drink and thought, \"What if we add this thing that helps people feel better? It could be an amazing drink!\" They tried to make the drink 90 times until they found the right mix.\n\nGabriel says, \"We like to sip on things. If we have a drink that makes us feel good, we don't need to drink things like grown-up drinks. And we can have as much as we want.\" The \"good\" Gabriel talks about is how this drink can make people feel better. It can help people feel less worried.\n\nYou can find this drink in fun flavors like fruity, orange, and spicy, and each can has a good amount of this special thing. This drink doesn't make you feel funny like some grown-up drinks do. But, this special drink might be perfect for people who like to keep things simple.\n5. When You Like Warm Drinks: Special Milk Drinks\nOn cold days, you might want something warm to drink. One idea is a special milk drink. It's warm like your favorite winter drink, but it's made with good things like plants. These plants could be yellow turmeric, red beetroot, green spirulina, green matcha, or special mushrooms. These plants are good because they have things that keep us healthy, like vitamins and minerals.\n\nDepending on what's in them, these special milk drinks can be lots of fun colors. I once had a purple one! They're usually made with milk from plants like almonds, coconuts, or oats.\n\nYou can find these warm, good-for-you drinks in more and more places. But you can also make them at home. Some companies make mixes that you just add your favorite kind of milk to.\n\nEven if you don't drink alcohol, there are many fun drinks to try. They can be shaken, fizzy, sweet, or without sugar. You'll still get lots of flavor, even if you don't want any alcohol.\nAlice is a popular writer who likes to write about being healthy and the world around us.

{"text": "On a sunny day, Cameron from the CA country news talked about something important. He said that people who love cheese in this CA country, like his friend Marianne, find the cost of dairy food to be too high. Marianne often wishes for the good deals she used to get in Europe when she goes shopping for food here.\n\nSo why is food so costly in CA country?\n\nWell, there's a rule called supply management. This rule, which many people don't know about, controls the prices of everyday things like milk, cheese, yogurt, chicken, and eggs. These things can cost a lot more in CA country than in the US country. The difference in cost is getting bigger and bigger.\n\nThis rule is important for people living in the countryside. But lately, people have been arguing about it because of some big talks about trading freely with other countries. Some people are not so sure if this rule will stay in the future.\n\nThis rule has been around for many years. It was made to keep CA country farmers safe from big changes in market prices. It sets the lowest price for things made in CA country. It also controls how much foreign food can come into the country and how much local farmers can produce.\n\nSome people don't like this rule. They think it makes things cost too much and stops new ideas. But farmers like it. They believe it helps them live the way they want to. They also think that comparing prices with other countries doesn't tell the whole story.\nLast week, there was some talk about a big rule change. This change was about how things are bought and sold between different countries. This caused some arguments in OT city. \nFor now, nothing will change. So, people in CA country who often visit other countries can keep looking at what things cost in different places. \nLast week, some items were checked in big shops in WA city, LO city and MO city. \nA big piece of cheese cost different amounts in these cities. In WA city, it cost less than in LO city, and in MO city it cost the most. \nYogurt also had different prices. In MO city, a medium tub cost a little bit more. In LO city, it cost less. In WA city, a big tub cost a little bit more than in LO city. \n\"Many things cost more in EU country, like houses, clothes, and shoes. But not food,\" said Rachel, who visits BE country, EN country, FR country, and NE country a few times a year. \"I'm always surprised how much things cost when I come back home.\"\n\"Buying food costs a lot here.\"\nA long time ago, there were some rules made to protect people who make milk, eggs, and chicken from big changes in prices.\nIn a place far away, there is a rule about selling certain things. This rule is not only in CA country but also in other places. Since the rule started, many important people have said it's good for the farmers. The farmers are very important, and they want to keep the rule.\n\nChanging this rule is hard because it has been around for a long time. The rule has made a lot of money for the farmers. Some people think the rule is worth a lot of money and if it's not there anymore, the farmers would need something else instead.\n\nBut, not everyone likes the rule. Some people say it's time to think about changing it because it's making things too expensive. It's so pricey that cheese costs more than meat! An important man named Gabriel, who works with many restaurants, is one of these people.\n\nGabriel's group started a project called \"Let Milk Be Free\" to talk about this. They say restaurants are having a hard time because milk is too expensive. Gabriel doesn't want to hurt the farmers, but he says something needs to change.\n\"Let's sit and talk about this,\" said William. There's a big gap between the two sides of the argument. Controlling how much milk is made is very important. For example, if the US makes just a little more milk than needed, the price can fall a lot, said the big boss of the milk farmers in the CA country. \n\nRyan, who takes care of 100 milk cows near an ON city, said the system lets milk farmers here earn enough money. Ryan wonders if it's right to compare milk prices. Milk farmers in the US and EU countries get help from the government, but those in CA country don't, he said. \n\nRyan also said that with any new system, there's no promise that the savings would be given to the shoppers. \"People think that if making something costs less, the price for the buyers will also go down, but that's not always true,\" Ryan said.\n\nWhen it comes to trading deals, Ryan said CA country has agreed to many in the past, while keeping the milk system the same. He's sure the government will keep the system in its talks for the big trade deal. \n\nLast week, the government promised to do just that. But the other side said, to join these talks, CA country had to at least be ready to talk about the milk system.\nTwo big groups disagreed when a decision was made to stop something called the Wheat Club. They thought it might mean other important groups, like the dairy and chicken groups, might also stop. But for now, people who live in the CA country can keep trying yummy cheeses and might think the higher price is because of how the market works. \"Money is not as much as it used to be, but even back then, I thought things were more costly here,\" said Rachel, who gets good cheese in Europe without spending a lot of money. \"I'm always glad to go back there, especially for the yummy food.\"", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "fd186e881a696c9c961c51a71158304be20d2064c470ec63808dd06c0f2f7ec2"}

On a series of three shows, the next two airing soon, Matthew and Adam will talk about how different beliefs have become part of our culture, what that means, and what teachers and schools should know to respond properly.\n\"Samuel said that there's a big problem we need to learn about. There are people who don't like our country and are trying to cause trouble. Samuel wants to help us understand this problem better by sharing stories from people who know a lot about it. These people love our country very much, even though they used to be part of the group that's causing trouble. \n\nMatthew used to be part of this group too. He was born in CA city and was a leader when he was just 13. But when he was 25, he started to question what he had been taught. He felt that something wasn't right. For the next 10 years, he was looking for the truth, and finally, he found that in the story of Jesus.\n\nSamuel explained that this problem is growing quietly and we need to understand it better. He invited Matthew to share his knowledge and experiences. Matthew helps us understand the problem's history, its goals, and how it's different from what we believe in. He also talks about why our country is being targeted. Matthew knows a lot about this because he's studied it and lived it. He can tell us about the people in this group, what they believe, and why they're doing what they're doing.\"\nLearn about these three different ideas:\nThe first idea is about \"Answering Questions\" - This is about understanding new beliefs. You can learn more about it.\nThe second idea is about \"The Quiet Church\" - This talks about how new beliefs can change the way we think about things in our community. You can see a short video about it.\nThe third idea is about \"The Agreeing Society\" - This talks about how new beliefs can also change the way our society thinks. You can see a short video about this too.\n\"Our freedoms are important, and we need to talk about these changes,\" said Ryan. \"Some people might not want to talk about it because they don't want to be seen as mean. But we need to understand these new beliefs because they won't go away if we ignore them. We need to understand them quickly or else they might change our community and our freedoms too much.\"\nThere's also a small book called \"What All People Should Know About New Beliefs\". This book can help people understand why they should know about new beliefs in our community and what they can do about it.\n\"What All People Should Know About New Beliefs\" talks about a plan from a group, how leaders teach and promote new rules, what community leaders should teach about new beliefs, the things that are not true that are tricking people, what we can learn from history about changes, being careful about what we say about new beliefs, whether the leaders understand the new beliefs, people in the East dealing with new beliefs, the danger of being too careful with what we say to our nation's survival, and much more.\nThere's a TV show that comes on a big channel that a lot of people can watch. It comes on every Sunday afternoon and then again on Tuesday and Thursday evenings. You can find out when to watch by looking at the channel guide. This show is also on the radio and many people listen to it. You can hear it online too, right at lunchtime. If you want to learn more, you can go to their website or their social media pages.

{"text": "There's a helpful tool called LC MAP. It has lots of information about different places and how we can keep them safe. This tool was made by a group of people who work with the earth and nature. They use it to look at, change, study, and make plans about these places.\n\nThere's also another tool that has lots of important papers, facts, and plans about the land. It can show us details about a specific place in the US, CA city, and other areas. This tool was made by a team of people who work with information, the earth, and nature.\n\nThere's a third tool that shows us how the weather has changed over time in CA city.\nLong, long ago, in a far-off place, people learned about the weather by studying old things. These old things came from all over a big place we'll call CA country. They told us about the weather from 18,000 years ago. People collected all this information, put it together, and shared it so others could learn and plan for changes in the weather.\n\nIn a smaller place within CA country, called YU region, there were maps that showed where fires had been. These maps even had information about fires that happened from one year to another. The maps told us where the fire was, how big it was, how many fires were happening, and even if people had permission to start a fire. The maps also showed how dangerous it was for a fire to start. All this information was available for people to look at and learn from.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "7e549b590498258a3f622c2a0780247f2946716be83a2e61dddfcfcafceba987"}
{"text": "There was a big company called TR Group. This company had a tough time with money and people didn't think it was doing well. But now, things are looking better. The boss of the company, a man named Nathan, says they are ready to grow and do better. \n\nA little while ago, when things were really tough because of a big sickness going around, they thought about making the company private. But, they decided not to do that because the people who owned parts of the company wanted to put more money in it and help it grow. \n\nNow, they are giving these people a chance to be a bigger part of the company's future.\nIs removing from the list no longer an option?\nThe reason for removing from the list was to get more money. Right now we are getting more shares through a listed company.\nThe current price of the share in the open market has dropped below the price of the new shares. Do you think the lower price for the new shares is fair enough?\nWhen we were setting the price, we gave a lower price based on the average of the last three months.\nSure, the market has changed a bit and ... you can't change the price. But we thought that was a fair price.\nI think there might be some other problems around having enough money for some investors that could be causing some selling.\nBut we believe the price we set as we offer the new shares is a good price.\nAre you worried the current share price will affect how many of the new shares are taken?\nI think the demand for our share will go up as we give out information because people will see the value that they are getting. This is the business of the future.\nIt is a business that is in a special market. We will continue as we send information out there to make sure everybody understands. I believe there will be a demand for the new shares.\nOur company was until six or so years ago mostly seen as a success story of investment gathering. What do you think made our company go from an investment group to the company that is listed on the big market?\nOur company is a great business. Adam read about a special tool while he was in a different place working. This tool helped people work together to start big businesses and make them bigger. But then some problems happened, and the business slowed down. But Adam and his friends worked very hard to make things better, and now they are growing again. \n\nThey used to use this tool to help really good businesses. Then they tried to help really big projects. Some people think they tried to do too much. \n\nThe problems didn't come from the things they tried to help. What happened is that they owed some money and were supposed to pay it back. But then some bad things happened, and they couldn't pay the money back. A good business is one that can get through problems like this. \n\nWhen bad things happen, you have to look at what you can do yourself. Adam and his friends started to look for ways that they could make the business better. They wanted to show other people that they could trust them again.\n\nSometimes, to be very old, there are going to be times when things are hard. We're looking at this as one good thing in a long list of good things. Do you think it was a smart choice for our team to focus on building things? We thought we needed to make our plan clear by making sure our business was easy to understand instead of being in different areas. We saw that the future was going to be about building things and we believe we were right.\n\nSometimes, an idea might not work well. That's okay, because we have ways to handle it. How did we handle problems? We decided to organize our owe so it fit with what we have and can get. We did that by cutting our owe to the bank by 40 per cent and making our owe last between five and ten years.\n\nThis gives the business some room so when they get some money, they can use some of it for working stuff instead of paying all of it in owe. At the same time, we made good friends with lenders because now we have a plan we all agree on.\n\nWe also focused on doing things well so we don't make mistakes. And then the next step is this money collection to help us move from fixing to growing. Who do we thank for helping us during tough times? We have an amazing group of people here who have helped make the business stable out of tough times and we're starting to grow.\nWe are happy because we are doing better and better. All parts of our work are growing. We changed our work to make it better and to make sure we give good things to others. Because we all think the same way, we can make our work better even when it's a bit hard. \n\nWhy are we working hard to make things better? Because we have a great team and we like to make new things and work together. When there are hard things, we know it's our job to find answers. \n\nWe know that old ways can't solve new problems. When things are hard, it doesn't mean we look for easy work. Our job is to make things better when they are hard. \n\nWhat do we need to be good leaders? We need to want to solve problems. We need to care about our family and spend more time on our work. We need to understand that we have to give more time to our work. I am happy because I have experience in making things better.\nSo, I know some plans didn't work out well, and I've watched how some friends I've worked with reacted to those times. It's clear that you can't make anything if you don't join in. I don't care if I'm first or last, as long as we finish the job. \n\nDid you ever lose important friends from the teams you made to help the company get better? We've had friends move, but most of us stay. We've looked at the numbers of friends who have left, and it's not different from any regular group. \n\nWe're like a family here, we always listen to everyone's ideas, and we all have to do our best. When everyone's ideas are heard, people feel they're helping and making a difference.\n\nHow has the old 'friend connection' through some of your friends who own shares changed the business? These friends had a big dream and started doing amazing things that we all like. They also did well in other things. \n\nI don't know how connected they are, and the truth that won't change is, before 2016, we did less than five per cent of our work with the big group. So, even if there were connections, I can't connect them to our work. \n\nDoes the friend connection idea still affect decisions in our company? We will keep sharing our plan and telling truths about our work. We care about what we share because we get many questions and we answer them.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "e6b844da638959dacbc6fd0bca3bd649e33515094b4b83bbe534804f3d6c68a1"}
{"text": "Online Learning\nOur friends, Oliver and Benjamin, talk about learning big stuff online. They are like your teachers on the internet. They work for a company that helps people learn new things. They have a show where they talk about how they teach and what they teach. \n\nThis week, they talked about how they teach big stuff. They shared their special ways of teaching and what they like to teach. They also talked about what they think will happen in the future. Here are some things they said:\n\nLearning versus Picture Cards\nBenjamin said, \"When you start a new project and someone says, 'We need to learn,' usually one person who knows a lot will say, 'I can teach. I will make some picture cards.' But learning is not just about looking at picture cards. You also have to do things yourself.\" You need things you can touch and use in class to learn. You need to think, what are the ideas and things you need to do well in that project? It takes a lot of time and you need to know a lot and have done it before.\nDavid: \"In the beginning, you would get someone to go and talk about a project they were working on. If a company needed training, then they'd ask someone to help. But as things grew, that way didn't work anymore. It doesn't get bigger easily. You really need people who know how to plan lessons, who really know how to run a classroom. Especially when it's big, it's not just something an engineer can do easily.\"\nPlanning the lessons\nHenry: \"Companies are starting to look for, 'OK, we've learned a lot or we know a lot already, we want to start doing things quicker.' So, they're starting to look at quicker ways like Spark and, sometimes Flink, but what we're generally going to see is that a lot of these new things that are coming out that let us do big data processing quicker, this is what they're going after. A big tool we're talking about is called K. I worked with a group named C to teach about K. When I visited companies, they would show me how they work. It all begins with K and then goes into either H or S or sometimes both.\"\n\nNathan: \"People want to understand the bigger picture. What's happening in their work and which ways of doing things work best? Like Jesse said, maybe the people who make a certain tool aren't always the ones who show all the ways you can use it. That's where I come in. I find that people come to learn to find out more about what they can do, what makes sense. Like we talked about S and K, maybe add C into that. That's a way of doing things that we see in places like banks, and other places too. It's a good way to show the different things people really want to know.\"\n\nLearning for everyone\n\nAnderson: \"One big thing we're missing is that we've done a lot for people who build things and for people who look at numbers, but we haven't really helped the people who run things. I noticed this when I was teaching at a place called CL; I had bosses or even big bosses from companies that everyone knows about sitting through my whole four-day class. Some people love to learn a lot. Others, not so much. They could learn what they need in a day. But what's important is to know how to use what you learn to do good things. \n\nI made a class called \"The Business of Big Information.\" We talk a lot about technology. But what's more important is how we use it to make things better. How do we use information to make a choice? I call it a \"data-helped choice.\" I use information to help me make a choice. But how do you start? How do you make a successful big information project? Some companies find it hard. It's different from other projects. It needs more technology and more know-how. Some find it tough to get it done.\n\nNathan said, \"I've helped companies learn. Sometimes, it's hard to tell when the learning ends and the helping starts. That's okay. I think there's a need for that because people really want to understand before they start a project.\" In simple words, when a team joins a learning session, they can discover things they might want to ask an expert about later. Also, these learning sessions are great because you get to hear questions from others. This can be very helpful. You might hear about problems that other teams are having and how experts solve those problems. This could save your team a lot of time. \n\nThere was also a mention of a live online learning session with a teacher named Jack, which will be very interesting. It will help you understand how to make and use applications that can help you understand lots of information. \n\nPlease note, you can learn a lot from books, videos, and live training, and you can do it anywhere. You can also watch it on a big screen.\nWatch all of Oliver's videos, big events, and meet-the-teacher sessions on your home TV. If you want to say something, you can talk to us.

They talked about how to use creative ways like videos and pictures to teach. They also talked about how some ideas don't make sense when you think about them carefully.\n\nMs. Madison, a leader who works with kids and teenagers at a church, led a long talk afterwards.

Many people thought of him as the best musician who played old-style music. For many, many years, he shared the special music from his city with people all around the world. He learned to play this music from other great musicians and he taught it to many famous people. \n\nJack was also a piano player. He had a popular song called \"Right Song Wrong Time\" and he won many awards. He was even included in the Hall of Fame of Rock & Roll. \n\nJack's father owned a music store and so, Jack spent a lot of time in a famous studio as a child. This is where he learned to love music and where he started his journey to become a great musician. There was a teenage boy who loved playing music with his friends, Frankie and Lloyd. One day, he hurt his finger and had to switch from playing the guitar to playing the piano. He also had some trouble staying healthy, which he talked about in a book he wrote much later.\n\nIn the 1960s, he moved to a big city called LA, and played music for some famous people. When he wasn't busy, he would gather his friends from home to play music that reminded them of their hometown. He even made up a character for himself, calling himself \"Dr. J,\" after an old story about a man who healed people. His first album was a bit strange, but people liked it a lot. He even had a special song that other musicians liked to play.\n\nIn the next decade, he shared his unique music style with more people. He played songs that everyone in his hometown knew and loved. His music was full of fun rhythms and people loved to dance to it. He even inspired a big music party that happens every year.\n\nHe also played music with a popular band and performed his special song at a big concert. He became known as the person who could add a special flavor to any music project. A man named Ryan sang a song in a popular cartoon movie in 2009, made up a song for a chicken restaurant, and was the idea behind a puppet rock band. After some time, Ryan found his way back to the music from his home in NE city. His last music album, made while he was still alive, was a special one for another musician named Liam. \"The music from my home is a part of me, it's a big deal,\" he said.

Some people don't like these changes because they think it's not good for workers, the earth, and other things. These changes might also help big companies that were nice to George. They're making these changes quickly and quietly. People are more worried about cars and money right now. But these new rules are happening in the background and not many people are talking about it. The new team coming in might not like these changes.\nThere are lots of rules about different things like staying healthy, car safety, and being nice to each other. Some rules are about keeping our world clean. These rules try to stop things that make our air and water dirty, or things that are not good for our lands.\n\nSome people are not happy about changes in these rules.

People who were in charge before did this too, but this time it's happening a lot more.\n\nSome of the new rules are very different and seem to help big businesses. One rule will make it easier for companies that dig up coal to put the dirt and rocks they dig up into valleys and streams. This way of digging coal is not good for our world because it hurts our mountains. The new rule will make it easier to do this.\nBig companies might soon be able to build big factories that use coal, very close to big parks. They may also be able to let out more smoke without using new machines to clean it. \n\nThe \"Earth Care Club\" thinks this is like a big sale for coal. Other clubs that care about the Earth agree. They say, \"The only reason for these rules is to help the businesses that the ruler's team helps.\" A good example is a rule that lets people dig out a lot of oil from the ground, which can make our Earth dirty.\n\nThere are many more new rules. One rule lets truck drivers drive for longer without taking a break. Another rule lets the train companies decide how to move dangerous things around places where many people live. \n\nAnother rule reduces the safety of animals that could disappear. It's also easier to carry a hidden and loaded gun in big parks. Some health helpers may say no to doing some medical work because of their beliefs.\n\nA big idea is to let industries look after themselves, instead of the government looking after them. One rule lets the fishing people decide how fishing affects the ocean, instead of government people. There was a farm that took care of itself in the way it got rid of dirty water. The big house where the leader lives said it wasn't trying to make things hard for the new leader. They said people knew about these changes for a while. These rules might be hard for the new leader, Oliver, to change quickly. They were made early, so the time to change them is longer than 30 or 60 days. \n\nOliver's helpers will need to take a lot of time to change these rules because they have to talk to the public about them. This could take a long time, maybe even years, especially if big companies go to the courts to stop the changes.\n\nAt the same time, Oliver and his helpers have many other things to do because they're trying to fix the money problems. But, there are groups that don't like these new rules and they're talking to Oliver's helpers to make sure the new rules are changed as soon as they can be. \"They know about this. Oliver's helpers have a list of things they want to change,\" said Matthew.\nA story about a very important person, Benjamin\nBenjamin was a very important man who used to work in the army. He used to make big decisions and tell people what to do. After he retired, he started helping a company, called DS. DS was a small company, but they had big dreams. They wanted to make and sell lots of strong cars to another country, called IR country. But to do that, they needed someone who could talk to the most powerful people. That's why they asked Benjamin for help.\n\nDS hired Benjamin in the middle of a warm season. Very soon, Benjamin started doing his job. He wrote a letter and made a big presentation to send to his friend David, who was the big boss in IR country. In his letter, he said that DS could make strong cars quickly and without costing too much money. He also said that no one else could do a better job than DS.\n\nIn just a few days, DS's plan was with the big boss in IR country, all thanks to Benjamin. The boss of DS, a man called Timothy, was very happy. When someone asked him about Benjamin, he said, \"That's what I pay him for.\"\nThis passage contains many names, places, and topics. However, many of these are not necessary for a main storyline and are too complex for preschool children. Let's simplify it. A lot of people, places, and things were mentioned in this passage. For example, there were mentions of a man named Adam, a lady named Bella, and another man called Cameron. They talked about places like the NE city and FR country. They also discussed different topics like the market where people buy and sell things, the idea of fairness, and the practice of making rules and decisions for a group of people. They even talked about the idea of warming all over the world. It was a big mix of different topics!A new leader was chosen for our country. On December 1, 2008, this person spoke to everyone for the first time after being chosen. Many topics were discussed, such as money, healthcare, and how to keep people safe. It was a big day! This is a story about a lot of people and places. The people include Adam, Benjamin, Cameron, David, Ethan, Frank, Gabriel, Henry, Isaac, Jack, Kevin, Liam, Matthew, Nathan, Oliver, Patrick, Quentin, Ryan, Samuel, Thomas, Ulysses, Victor, William, Xavier, Yosef, and Zachary. The places are 'FR country', 'BR country', 'CA city', 'NE city', 'CO city', and 'K street'. There are also some important things involved such as a famous drama, healthcare, and the environment. This story talks about many things happening in the late 20th century and continues to the present day. Many famous people, places, and events were mentioned. They included big cities, famous newspapers, and important people. There was also talk about someone named Charlie Gibson who was going to meet President George. Charlie was going to take a boat to a special place with the president's family. This news was shared by a man named Paul. It was shared towards the end of November in 2008.\nIn a big city, a man named Benjamin interviewed the leader of the country and his wife during the holiday time. Benjamin traveled with the leader and his wife from their big house to a special place they like to visit. At this place, Benjamin asked them about their past experiences, what they plan to do next, and if they have any helpful tips for the new leader and his family. This talk will be shared on a news show, a morning show, and other places too.There are a lot of names and places being talked about here, like Adam, Benjamin, Cameron, and the NE city. There are also many different topics being discussed, from money matters to soldiers and the FR country. There's even a mention of a famous drama and the early morning. The story also talks about an important paper, a big building, and the late 20th century. This is all very interesting, but remember, it's just a story! A lot of people with different names were involved in many important events. These people include Adam, Benjamin, Charlotte, David, Ethan, Fiona, Grace, Henry, Isabel, Jack, Kevin, Liam, Madison, Nathan, Olivia, Patrick, Quinn, Rachel, Samuel, Thomas, Uma, Victoria, Wendy, Xavier, Yara, and Zachary. These events happened in places like NE city and WA city. They talked about a lot of things, like money, soldiers, and laws. They also talked about important things that happened in the past. But they also talked about new things like computers and videos on the internet. They also talked about other countries and big problems like the weather changing. They also talked about health, people moving from one place to another, and big disagreements. All of these people and places and things are part of how things work in our world.This is a list of many different things, like names, places, and ideas. Some people are named Adam, Bella, and Charlotte. There are places like the FR country and NE city. There are ideas about money, laws, and big decisions. There are also times of the year, like the warm months and the cold months. Some people do things like talking, deciding, and helping.

{"text": "Benjamin was looking at the price of oil. On a Tuesday, he noticed that the price was almost $80 a barrel, even though a new kind of sickness was spreading quickly. The price was going up because some places had problems making oil and people thought there was less oil in the U.S. than before. Benjamin learned that the price went up a little bit, to $79.15 a barrel. He also learned that another kind of oil got a little more expensive, going up to $76.30.\n\"Prices are going up because there are problems making oil in EC country, LI country and NI country and people think there will be even less oil in the U.S. soon,\" said oil helper, Gabriel.\nThe three places that make oil had to stop some of their work because of problems and having to fix things.\nAt the same time, people guessed on Monday that there is probably less oil in the U.S. for the fifth week, while the amount of gasoline stayed the same last week.\nIn EN country, there won't be any new rules about the sickness before the end of this year, said health helper, Sam. The people in charge are waiting to see if the doctors and nurses can help everyone who is sick. Boss man Jack promised to make more sickness tests available as a new type of sickness was making a lot of people unwell and changing travel plans. Because of this sickness, many flights had to be canceled during holiday time in the US country. In CH country, more people were getting sick every day and because of that, a big city had to be closed off. People who make big decisions about oil are meeting soon to decide if they will produce more oil next month. At their last meeting, they decided to produce more oil even though the sickness was spreading. RU country might not be able to produce as much oil as they want to because they don't have enough resources, but they might be able to do it later in the year. People who handle money decided to invest more in oil during the week of Dec. 21, according to a big group. This group invested more money in two big cities.\nSomeone had their clothes taken away and was tied up because of what a person whose name starts with 'U' said - The person's name that starts with 'U' is Uncle Ulysses.

{"text": "Let's look at a car that is different from the rest. This car is very comfortable, especially at the back where the extra seats are. We took this car for a ride to see how good it is. We wanted to know if the back seats are really as comfortable as they say. \n\nIn our country, we have many different types of cars. Some cars are big, some are small. Some cars are for just one or two people, and some are for a whole family. This car is for a family.\n\nFamily cars are usually big because they need space for everyone. And this car is no different. It has lots of room for everyone. But what makes it special is the extra seats at the back. They are very comfortable.\n\nMany family cars have extra seats at the back. But these seats are not always comfortable. Sometimes, they are very small and not nice to sit in for a long time. But in this car, the extra seats are very nice. After a long ride, people sitting in these seats won't feel tired or uncomfortable. This is what makes this car different from the rest.\nIn the big car, there are seats in the middle that can move forward and backward. You can also lean these seats back and they can flip forward. This flip forward part is very useful, especially for friends sitting in the very back. To get to the back, there's a special handle on the right seat that lets it flip forward. The left seat has a button that does the same thing. This is really helpful when friends in the back want more space. When the seats flip forward, there's a lot of space for grown-ups to walk to the back. Once in the back, there's lots of space. In fact, two grown-ups can sit in the back even when the middle seats are pushed all the way back. The back seats have a lot of space, even more than some big cars. This is very cool. But it gets even better. The back seats can lean back and they even have parts that you can adjust to rest your head on. Each friend in the back gets their own air vent that they can adjust. They also get a special slot to charge their toy phones and a holder for drinks. The chairs in the car can be moved and changed in many ways. This makes the car very useful for different needs. There is a video about this, but we can't watch it here. The car is very good and has many cool things. It looks big and strong, and has different engines and gears to choose from. But the best part of the car is how much room there is in the back. You need to sit in it to see how much space there is.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "d1fc0daa7a34e8f5476ad85ea840d2953b41a617ef9d48a301625df8cfed529a"}

{"text": "Scary movies can be very fun to watch. But some are not so good because they only try to scare you with sudden surprises. This is not the best way to make a scary movie. \n\nA good scary movie makes you feel scared with its mood. It's like when you walk into a dark room and you feel a little bit scared. This is not easy to do in a movie. The movie has to show you the right things, and the music has to be just right. It can't be too loud or too quiet. It has to make you feel scared, but not tell you to be scared.\n\nThe people in the movie also have to be good at showing how they feel. They can't just scream and run around. They have to make you believe they are really scared.\n\nThere are other ways to make a movie feel scary, too. But these are some of the most important ones. Some really good movie makers know how to do this. And sometimes, you can find these kinds of movies in places you wouldn't expect.\nIn these films, you can see more than just scary stuff. They mix in parts of other types of stories, like tales of wonder or future times, to make the films special. This kind of care and special touch is what makes them stand out.\n\nThis is about some really cool scary movies.\n\n1. The Scary Straw Guy (1973)\n\nIn this movie, you first see a place called SU country with music and pretty pictures. A man named Henry hears about a missing girl, so he flies to SU country to try and find her. But when he gets there, he finds something even scarier than a missing girl: people who believe in different things.\n\nThe people in SU country do things that Henry doesn't understand or agree with, and he has to try and make sense of it all to solve the mystery. The bad guy, played by a man named Cameron, is very good at pretending to be scary, and a lot of people think this movie is really good because of him.\n\nHenry also has to avoid being tricked by a girl, because he believes it's wrong to be with someone unless you're married to them. The actor who plays Henry is very good, and he and Cameron play off each other well. They show how different their characters' beliefs and ideas are.\nThere was a special movie called \"The Wicker Man\". It had beautiful music and made people feel like they were in a magic place called \"SU Island\". It also had some surprising pictures, a little bit of scary stuff, and a big surprise at the end. Many people didn't notice it at first, but later they found out it was really good and it inspired lots of other movies.\n\nNext, we have another movie from 1983. This one is made by a man named David. He is known for making movies that might make you feel a bit uneasy. Just like a man named Jack, David has made lots of movies. But the one we're talking about here is the best one. It's a bit like a mystery, and it makes you feel a bit worried.\n\nIn this movie, a man named Jack, who runs a TV station, is always looking for new and exciting shows. He likes shows with lots of action and excitement. One day, he finds a very intense and scary show called \"VE Show\". He can't stop watching it, even when he starts to feel strange and different, both inside and out.\n\nThis movie from the early 1980s is one of David's most thought-provoking movies. It has important messages that made people think and talk a lot. Some people didn't like it, but many others thought it was very smart and ahead of its time. TV can change how we think and feel. What if it controls our minds? Do we know about it? If we do, can we stop it? Can we even want to stop it? These are the questions that a story asks us, with a touch of humor, grown-up scenes, and scary moments.\n\nNow, let's talk about a famous film. It is a story that many people liked right away when it first came out. This is a tale about a young vampire, but it's not just about being scary. It has parts about growing up and finding love too. This story came out the same year as another vampire film, but it's not like that one. It doesn't have all the drama or boring characters. Instead, it digs deep into what it means to be a vampire and how it can change a person. It also looks at how the main characters feel.\n\nEven though it has a lot of scary and shocking parts, the person who made the film said he cared more about the friendships in the story. Maybe that's why the story feels so real and has a strong mood. The story is about a 12-year-old boy who becomes friends with a vampire kid in a place we'll call BL town, during a time long ago.\nIn a park, there were two kids who, instead of playing, were talking about big things like their place in the world. \n\nThere's a story about a kid who had a hard time growing up and wanted to be grown-up so he could live on his own.\n\nThere's another story called \"28 Days Later\". It didn't cost a lot of money to make, but it's a very exciting movie. This movie made people interested in zombie movies again. It's about very fast zombies in a world where everything has gone wrong.\n\nIn this story, some people who love animals let some monkeys free. But the monkeys were sick with a very bad sickness that made people very angry. This sickness made everything go wrong. The main character, a guy named Jim, wakes up from a long sleep to find out that everything has changed. He has to learn how to live in this new world, where he always has to be careful of zombies and other people who might want to take his stuff.\n\nThe movie has some really good actors and it's filmed in a really cool way. It's a scary movie, but it also makes you think about what people do when things get really hard. There is a spooky movie about a teacher and his students who go to a big old building to study a strange green thing. Weird things start to happen, like bugs everywhere and scary people outside. The movie is not just about being scared, but also makes us think about right and wrong. It's like looking at ourselves in a mirror and seeing something not very nice. Another scary movie is about a spine-chilling story that will make your hair stand on end.\nThere was a man named Gabriel who liked to make scary movies that were different from others. One of his first movies was made in 1993. Later, he made another movie with the help of his friend, Patrick. This movie was made in 2001. \n\nThe story of the movie is about a young boy named Carlos. Carlos is 10 years old and he lives in a place called SP country. This is a time when there was a big fight in the country. Carlos had to live in a home with other children without parents because his parent was lost in the big fight. Carlos started seeing things that he couldn't understand.\n\nGabriel's movies have a special way they look. This movie was more than just a pretty picture, it was a story close to Gabriel's heart.\n\nThere are other good scary movies out there too. And there are lots of good movies that didn't get a special prize. There are also movies with two main girls that are really good.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "6292e9546a33829955094ca4fbd9207a7d747fec17bcc165b2e01accf3e3ef96"}

{"text": "This is a tale about a brave woman named Bella and her husband, Benjamin. Bella and Benjamin went on a journey to a place with tall cliffs, a sky that went on forever, and lots of room to roam.\n\nDays turned into weeks, weeks into months, and months into years. Bella and Benjamin's little house near the very tall cliffs grew into a big place, just as big as the nearby town.\n\nOne day, Bella and Benjamin's car stopped working near a small creek while they were on their way to CU city. Bella loved the place so much, they decided to stay longer.\n\nTheir little house became a place where all their friends came to visit. Bella was really good at cooking, and her tasty food made many of her friends come over. Benjamin built more small houses around their home. People could live in these houses for a day, a week, or even a month. Their house became a big lodge. Their small place grew bigger and bigger every day.\n\nThere was a trail called HT trail very close to their house. Many couples would walk on this trail to SG city to get married. And Bella's house was a great place for them to rest. Some new families came to live in a tiny town. They built houses and wanted to stay in this beautiful land. They thought it would be a wonderful place to have children.\n\nA long time ago, the town was very cold. Everyone was happy because they had lots of food and they hoped next year would be even better. But they didn't know something bad was going to happen.\n\nOne winter day, a chilly wind came from the tall rocks. Dark clouds covered the valley where the buildings were. Big snowflakes started to fall in the afternoon. It got colder and the snow got deeper. When it was dark, everyone was at home. They knew it would be a long night because the wind was loud and the snow was getting higher.\n\nWhen the sun came up, a woman named Bella looked out her kitchen window. A lady looked outside and saw a scary sight. The heavy snowfall made it hard to see beyond their house. The snow had piled up almost to their window. She went to wake up Ben.\n\nBen had not slept well. He was very sick and his body was shaking with fever. When she woke him up, he started coughing badly. It had been a long time since Ben had been this sick. The lady was worried about Ben. She loved him very much and didn't want anything bad to happen to him.\n\nThree days after the snow started, the sun came up over the big cliffs. It shone bright and lit up the white snow. Some older folks in the area said they had never seen so much snow in their lives. The snow was three feet deep in the valley, and in some places, it was even 15 feet deep. Even though the sun was shining, it was still very cold. It was two more weeks before it got warmer. By then, the people in the small town didn't have much food or things to keep them warm. The only thing they had a lot of was the snow covering the ground, and the ice on the creek.\nBenjamin was having a tough time sleeping. He was very sick, and Bella was doing her best to help him. She made him yummy soup, kept his bed nice and clean, and took really good care of him. Bella wasn't going to let anything happen to her friend.\n\nWhen the flowers started to bloom and grass began to grow again, everyone in their little town started to feel hopeful. The snow had melted, and now there were beautiful flowers and fresh grass everywhere. The people who had cows were especially happy because their cows could eat the new grass. They thought this might be the year they could save a lot of money.\n\nBut Benjamin didn't get better as quickly as everyone had hoped. He was still feeling sick, and Bella was worried about him. He wasn't as happy as he used to be, and he was still very weak. Bella knew he was sicker than when they left NE city, but she believed in him. She wasn't going to stop hoping for her friend to get better. She helped him get better. When it became warm again, everyone forgot about the cold winter. Everything was normal again in the little town by the big cliffs. Everyone was hopeful. Then, the rainy season came. \n\nThe first big storm of the year happened on a summer day. The day before, everyone had a fun party at Benjamin and Bella's house for a special day. Their house and the buildings around it were full of people. Everyone at the Cliff Town had a good day. They did not know a storm was coming.\n\nJust before dinner, the first loud thunder sounded and big rocks fell from the cliffs. These rocks blocked the creek that the town needed for water. It rained so much that no one knew their water was gone. A small lake started to form behind the rocks and dirt. When the rain stopped, some men, including a still weak Benjamin, saw the growing lake. They decided not to blow up the blockage. Instead, they would make a pipe system to let the water go around the blockage and fill up the creek again. They planned to also bring water to all the houses near the lodge.\nFor a whole month, some men were busy with a big task. They were almost done with the first part when a day came that was different from the rest. On this day, dark clouds covered the sky earlier than usual. As the first drops of rain fell, the men decided to stop their work. In no time, the rain was pouring so hard that they couldn't see very far. There was also lightning and very loud thunder. \n\nSuddenly, a big wall made of earth and rocks, which was holding back a large amount of water, broke. The water rushed down, filling a small creek until it overflowed. This happened so fast and caused a lot of damage. It was over in a blink of an eye. \n\nFour houses that were near the creek vanished, as if they were never there. All the people and things inside were carried away to a far place. Benjamin and Bella lost six small buildings because of the flood. But their house and big building were safe. They were very lucky. Sadly, nine people were not as lucky and they could not escape the flood. \n\nPeople who had lived in the area for a long time said that it was the worst storm they had ever seen. They believed it was a storm that only happens every hundred years and hoped it wouldn't happen again while they were still alive. The nearby people believed a powerful being was unhappy because the growing community did not take care of the land. They said if people could not live nicely with nature, then nature would make them pay.\nBenjamin and Bella talked about moving somewhere else. But Benjamin was too tired to go far. They decided to wait for a better moment.\n(And so, Bella's story continues.)\nThis story is about art. The writer is Jack.

{"text": "A book by a man named Adam tells a story about a big city. The city is very cold and the people living there want to save energy. They want to go back to using less things, like they did a long time ago. \n\nIn another part of the story, it's a different time and place. There's a new group of people called \"Atoms For Peace.\" A woman named Evelyn is their leader. They are getting ready to fight.\n\nAdam, the man who wrote the story, was born in a place far away and moved to a sunny place near water when he was older. He lives happily with his wife and cat. He has written many stories that people really like.\nAdam loves drinking tea and reading comic books. He also enjoys spending a lot of time on a site called Twitter. Adam lives in a place called GB country. \n\nPeople say nice things about Adam's work. Someone said, \"Be careful, because Adam's story is so good it will take your breath away. It's even better than his first story.\"\n\nPeople also like his first book a lot. It's a story about heroes with superpowers. Someone said it was like looking at a kaleidoscope, full of fascinating, strange beauty. Another person thought it was sad and longing, but in a good way. They said Adam's writing makes the story move really fast, and the heroes in the story feel just right. The story about the big NE building is very fun to read! It's like starting a new world. A writer who makes stories for a famous TV show and comic books thinks so too. Another writer who won a special award for his stories about heroes thinks the story is like a dream. It's very exciting and plays with the idea of heroes in a fun way.\n\nThere's a part of the story about heroes who fly with rockets, brave girls, cool hats, old cars, and busy city streets. It's like an old story but new at the same time. A famous actor who played a rocket hero loves this part. He thinks the writer is very smart and funny. He says the story is so good, it's like the writer is taking your time and you are happy about it.\n\nFor the part called \"Seven Wonders\", it's about heroes but in a very different and fun way. It's exciting, magical, and lovely. Both people who know a lot about hero stories and those who don't will enjoy it.\n\"Adam, a great storyteller, caught everyone's eyes with his first book, Empire State. His next book, Seven Wonders, has made all his eager readers very happy. It's a fun, interesting, and lively superhero story.\"\n- Victor, a famous writer\n\"This story is a bundle of joy. It's like watching a superhero movie while your favorite cartoon characters pass by. It's full of action and shows Adam's love for exciting fiction and superheroes.\"\n- Philip, a book writer\n\"Adam's The Age Atomic is another great story. It's packed with action and surprises, and will keep you excited from the start to the end. It's a must-read!\"\n- A traveler from Daily Steampunk\n\"Adam's book is fast and exciting, mixing big problems and personal adventures really well. 8/10.\"\n- Paul, from Sci-Fi Bulletin\n\"Empire State loved old movies and adventure stories. [The Age Atomic], just as good as its predecessor, talks about the fear of red danger at the start of the nuclear times but keeps the same exciting storytelling and fun attitude that made Empire State so enjoyable.\"\nThis is a wonderful story about science and mystery. The story is full of surprises and keeps you guessing. It's about two friends, Ryan and Jessica, who are trying to find a robot king. They each have their own reasons for wanting to find him. Once they find him, they learn that a big boom could happen unless they do something quickly. The writer is really good at creating the world in the story. He makes the places in the story seem real and I like how the friends interact with the places. The story also has lots of different robots: big robots, small robots, half-human robots, robots that can go boom, and even robots that act like zombies. The friends in the story could have been more interesting, but the exciting story and amazing places make up for it. If you like robots, mystery, adventure, ghosts, big booms, good writing or science stories, you should read this book. The book is written by Adam. Other good books by Adam include \"Immortal Builders\" and \"Last God Still Standing\". There is also a good book by Joseph called \"Lace\".\nThis book is by a person named Matthew. In one story, our world is in big trouble. The air and water are not clean, and there are bad people causing problems. These bad people are special because they have two bodies but share one mind. \n\nIn another story, our world is very sick and it's a very dark time. But then comes a bright day when everyone is peaceful and happy. In both these times, a special child is chosen for an important job.\n\nThere's also a story about another place that's just like our NE city. This place is full of tough guys and detectives. It's like a twisted mirror reflection of our city, where scary people are around every corner. \n\nWe also meet a man named Cameron. Cameron used to work with numbers for an insurance company, but now he fights crime all the time. He tries to beat the bad guys and also keep his girlfriend, named Madison, happy. Something exciting is happening! Imagine a story about old heroes with amazing powers. They're part of a group that uses magic to keep things in order. But then, something unexpected happens. The biggest, most powerful being decides to become a regular person to see what life is like. This causes a lot of trouble because the other powerful beings want to take over. \n\nIn a busy city called 'SV city', there's a person named 'Thomas'. This city is always scared because of a villain who wears a hood called 'The Cowl'. But then, Thomas gets super powers and tries to stop 'The Cowl'. This leads to a lot of unexpected problems. \n\nIn another story, there's a person named 'Lucas'. He used to be very powerful but now, he's just resting in a quiet place. But then he hears about a plan by 'Gabriel', who is now in charge of a scary place, to use something humans made - let's call it a 'magic box' - against them. So, they create the most exciting game show ever!", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "9b845928a5dbbcb5b5cd77831bda046595f293777c816268fdcc88a3c88bcb77"}

{"text": "Long ago, there were soldiers from a faraway land known as CA country. People saw these soldiers as keepers of peace all over the world. But, something happened that changed how people saw them. This happened when they were in another land, the SE country in the big continent of Africa, trying to keep peace there.\n\nSomething very sad happened in the SE country. Two men from SE country were no longer alive because of what some soldiers did. This made people very upset and they stopped thinking of the soldiers from CA country as peacekeepers. This also made the entire group of soldiers feel very bad.\n\nThe soldiers from CA country had come to the SE country on a very important mission. The SE country was a hot, dry place where people were fighting a lot, and many people didn't have enough food. The soldiers came to help keep peace and make sure food and other good things could reach the people living there, who were very hungry.\n\nBut, not everyone in the SE country was happy that the soldiers from CA country were there. Some people, who were like leaders in the SE country, didn't like these foreign soldiers being there. And, because of this, they often caused trouble for the efforts to bring food and rebuild the land. A few days later, it was found that some papers and computer records had been changed to hide important details about what happened. Many people said the top leaders of the army were to blame for what happened, and lots of suggestions were made to fix things. In the end, four soldiers were found guilty, but only for small things.

{"text": "A video is shown of a man breaking his computer because he sees something he doesn't like. Instead of just closing the window or changing the screen, he chooses to break the computer. Could this mean he can't resist looking at the thing he doesn't like?\n\nThere's a funny story about some folks who can't be around goats unless they're wearing special clothes, because they might get too interested. And there's a rule in some places that women have to cover up and stay quiet, so they don't get too much attention from men.\n\nThis might seem funny, but it also shows how some people react strongly when they see things they don't like. A reader shares her thoughts:\n\nWatching this video as a girl, it's quite scary. What if instead of a man, a pretty lady had walked in? What would he do if he saw her after breaking the computer because of the pictures?\n\nSome people are really scared of making their own choices and can't deal with small changes. And this fear can sometimes make them react in a not-so-nice way when they're tempted. In a certain situation, some people felt upset because others were more comfortable and successful in the modern world. This caused some trouble. In a video about people who are very serious about their beliefs, it seems like no one is worried that a person has broken someone else's things.

{"text": "The story is about a girl named Sophia. Sophia likes to talk to people on a website called IG. She talks to people who make things themselves and sell them. These things are made in a way that does not harm our world. Sophia started liking these things when she was very young because her family made things at home or bought from people they trusted. When the time came when people had to stay at home, Sophia noticed a lot of people were talking online through videos. They did this because they still had to sell their things and let others know about them. Sophia thought this was a good chance to talk to these people and let others know their story. So, she started a series of talks on IG. She talks about the stories of these people, the problems they face, and how they keep going. These talks are very honest and powerful. Sophia is very good at understanding design, buildings, and how to protect our world. She started this as an experiment but now, she is having longer talks about the people she talks to. In a talk with a friend named Samira, Sophia talks about why she started this series, why she chose IG, and what she learned from these talks. In today's world, it can be hard to only use things made close to home. But I keep trying. When I was little, my mom, sister and I would look for cloth and other things made nearby at a big event in our city. We loved to find new things and people who were making cool stuff.\n\nNow, in my job, I get to work with small businesses. I like to help people who don't have a lot of money but are working hard to make good things and take care of their families.\n\nI like to tell people about the people who make the things we use at home. I use my social media to show pictures and tell stories about these people. I hope my stories will make more people want to help these businesses.\nWhen everything stopped because of the big sickness, lots of people started talking on the picture app. But some of it was not very helpful or interesting. It was hard for small shops and local businesses because they couldn't make or deliver their things. \nAfter talking to some of these shops, I decided to start a simple chat series. It was easy to watch and could help people who wanted to work together or learn from the people I talked to. The picture app was just the right place for this.\nI always wanted to make chats that got people talking, without only talking about myself. So why not share the stories of the people who need help, who could make their shop better with a new friend or special team-up?\nI started by talking about my hard-working friends who have small, special businesses and people I worked with who have unique things they do (and I try to learn about these things as much as I can). Now, I am starting to talk about people who see this as a chance to tell others about their shop, for free.\nWhy do you like to share your talks with others on a picture-sharing app?\nI decided to have my chat series on this app because of some important reasons:\nThis app is very easy to use and you can see pictures easily. To make it good, you need nice pictures and a good message. So, for the type of story I wanted to tell - a story in five parts - I had a job to do.\nNext, compared to making live videos or any kind of videos, making posts is easier to plan and do while also having a full-time job, and it doesn't take up much of the person's time who I am talking to.\nThird, it's a better, more handy way to get information than the app's video feature - to read what you want you can either see them in a special place on my profile or just move through my profile, whenever you want.\nFinally, the chat is either saved in an email or through a phone talk with me, because the questions are very clear it's easier for them to put their thoughts in these five posts.\nRight now, this is only on my profile on this app, but I'm open to making this into a bigger, more shared platform outside of it. I've only been doing this for two months, but I know it can grow into a group that can help each other in many ways - from plans to sell things and talk to people, to how things work, getting money and managing money.\nWhat is the usual way you talk to people and how do you get ready to show it online?\nI write about special shops and companies that fit these rules:\nThey have a real and unique story to tell and sell something one-of-a-kind.\nThey are new and could use some extra attention.\nThey started in the IN country and are careful about how they do things.\nThey help others, like by giving jobs to people who need them or by using things that can be used again or don't hurt the earth.\nI share a new story about a company two times a week, on the end of the week and on the first day of the week. After I write about them, I share it again with answers to questions people have asked. These can be seen any time.\nHaving a schedule and using the same style each time can be helpful. It can save time and help people remember your work. The more you share, the more people will see it and talk about it.\nAfter I share the story, I let people ask questions about the company. What is the best thing that has happened because of this?\nUp until now, it has helped the companies I write about get more people to look at their page. Some people who saw what I shared even talked to the companies to see if they could work together. When I chat about what people say or ask about stuff, it makes me happy. It tells me that the thing we made was worth it. It also makes me want to keep doing it. \nWhen you talk to these people who make things, what makes them different from the big ones?\nI think there are two things that make them special. First, they make something that's the only one like it. Second, they tell a true story about it. We like things that we can connect with and that talk with us. This is really important if you're in a place with a lot of competition.\nIt's also good for these people to share how they help their community and the world. More and more, people want to know that they're buying things in a good way. This way of thinking is small now, but it's getting bigger...\nWhat's the hardest thing for new people who make things and how do they usually fix it?\nFor the small, new ones, they might not always have enough money, or have trouble getting what they need to make their stuff. Each one has different ways to solve these problems.\nFrom talking and sharing stories, I've learned that new ones do better when they work with the right partners. They can do this with sellers, by making their stuff better, or even by working with others in the same (or very different) areas. At the end of a long day, it's important to learn how to be kind and help each other. \nImagine you are someone who helps others create their own brands. What do you think young brands are doing well? How can they do better?\nI like how they put a lot of thought and work into how their brand looks and what it stands for. Digital marketing is a great way to tell people about your brand, but it's the small things that really matter - like a special note with a package. This can be remembered more than a social media post, no matter how popular it is.\nWhat's your dream for #TheBrandStory?\nI'm not sure what the future holds. To start with, I want to change the name to something more unique (I'm open to ideas!). For now, I hope it encourages people to support small businesses, and think twice before not choosing a product made by a group with a good cause. And for those who want to start their own business, I hope this gives them courage to take the first step, and to always be open to work together, because that's what the future is about.\nLast question, but one we think is very important: how has #TheBrandStory changed you personally?\nSometimes, listening to their stories makes me think about my own work. To make myself feel better, I try to offer my professional services for free in return. I really admire people who create their own small businesses, charities, or projects from their homes. They have found their special place in the world, no matter what comes their way. It takes a lot of bravery and attention to make your dream come true. If I have even a little bit of both, then that's a good thing.\nWritten by Sophia\nAt home with Sophia\nRiding a Bike: Learning about self-made books during a big sickness around the world\nPaper books or Computer books?

He also mentioned that another person named Alice has chosen a man named Matthew to help with this big talk. \n\nAlice believes that opening a new office in the other country shows that they want to be better friends and do more business together.

These good things include letting more people work, allowing more things to move between places, and maybe even helping people who were caught to go free.\n\nThe person who takes care of money matters in one group decided to send a friend to TR country on the same day when peace happened between the two fighting groups.\n\nThey plan to have a big meeting about money in the fall. This will be their fifth time. The last time they did this was a long time ago.\n\nEven though they had problems, they still traded a lot of things.

{"text": "David, a soccer player from a team in NE city, might soon join a team from TR country. David helped his team do really well a few years ago, but his time with the team is almost over. The team from TR country wants David to join them without having to pay a lot for him. They are hoping David's team will agree to this.\n\nThe TR team was really good last year, but this year they are not doing as well. But, they have other players who can do what David does. So, the team leader might let David go to make room for new players.\n\nPeople think that instead of getting new players right away, the team might wait until the summer. They are also thinking about getting a young player from another team who can play in different positions. This might be a good choice if the young player is available.\n\nThe team might also have to get players from other teams. A former player from the team once did something wrong.\nYoung Yosef is thinking about leaving his team to join another one. Other team members like Cameron, Ryan, Henry and Adam are also planning to leave this winter. A big sports news says that Yosef has already been asked to join a team in TR country. His helper is looking at all the choices he has.\n\nBefore, Yosef was thought about by teams in GE country and a big sports league, where he first became famous with the SE city team. Since joining his current team in 2016, Yosef played 121 times and scored three goals. Even though people talked about a new plan, the 27-year-old Yosef and his team didn't agree on it. But his team leader, Bruce, didn't mind giving him a spot in the team last summer.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "a12c5aa173bc9edd8d6abb4517f00e305cd3ae0d2e2e80d6315385b2e40142d2"}
{"text": "There's a game where you can pick your own basketball team. The team from the city of OR in the FR country has had many good players. Here are five of the best players from that team that you can choose for your game team:\n\n1. T, who played in the year when you were 12 years old (Very good player)\n2. V, who played in the year when you were 98 years old (Good player)\n3. N, who is playing now (Good player)\n4. P, who played in the year when you were 94 years old (Good player)\n5. G, who played in the year when you were 05 years old (Good player)\n\nThe city of OR in the FR country is known for its magic. It's a place where a famous mouse lives, but it's also known for its basketball team. This team joined the basketball league when they were 1989 years old. They've had many good players since then.\n\nThe team's performance this year has been a mix of good and not so good. But they are still in the running for the final spot in the East side competition.\n\nWhen you play the game, you can pick these five players for your team. They have good skills like catching the ball well, not getting tired, and jumping high. They might be a bit expensive to get for your team. The very best player you can get is T, who many say is one of the best players the OR team has ever had.\nThere was a great player named Thomas. He was amazing when he played for the OR team. He even won two big scoring awards in a row (2003 & 2004) before he moved to the HO city team. Thomas was known for scoring a lot of points, so it's not a surprise that his player card in the game has a high score of 95 for scoring from far away and 89 for scoring up close. His card is a bit costly, but he can help you score a lot of points in the game.\n\nIn the same game, there's another player named Victor. People often use the word 'veteran' to describe him. Victor, who is 42 years old, has played for many teams. One special night, he became the first player ever to play in four different decades. Victor is known for his flashy moves and great skill at the hoop. To make the most of his player card in the game, you should try to score a lot of points with him! (92 points for layups & 94 points for dunks). His card in the game has some impressive scores: 98 for shot IQ, 98 for offensive consistency, and 97 for close shots, and it costs less.\nLet's talk about a popular basketball team and their star player, who we will call Victor. Victor is from a country called the SW country and he started playing in a big basketball league in 2011. A year later, he moved to this new team and he's been with them ever since. He even became a star player in 2019 and we think he will become a star player again in the future.\n\nVictor's job on the team is to guard the hoop and he's very good at it. He's also great at grabbing the ball (94 OVR), and his ability to play both offense (90 OVR) and defense (95 OVR) is really high. He guards the hoop as if it's the most important thing to him.\n\nThere are also other players like Patrick who might want to be known as the best guard of the team. Patrick is from a place called the ME city and he played for the team for the first six years of his career. He even became a star player four times during that time (in the late 20th century). Right now, he's a coach for another team in his hometown.\n\nPatrick's player card is very good. It has five out of six important attributes rated 80 or higher. There was a basketball player, let's call him \"Henry\", who was very good at catching the ball, even though he was not the tallest player. His position was SF, which means he was a forward, but not the tallest one. He was really good at making decisions and had lots of energy. He was also great at defending when the other team was trying to score. He played for the team from OR city for seven years, from the start to the middle of 2000s, and was chosen three times to play in the special game with all the best players. Just like another player, let's call him \"Adam\", Henry was good at many things. He had five skills that were rated 80 or above. The only thing he was not super good at was catching the ball, but he was still quite good at it. Isn't that interesting? There is a basketball game where you can play as Henry and Adam, and there are special codes and challenges you can try!", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "aeb9bab1cf846c505d72f508a9f44c8fa097e2f57505b1d92f8a230b8999de57"}

Adam likes to make art that makes people think about powerful people who do bad things and events that we forget about.\n\nThis project tells a story about a man named Enrique who is remembered in many places today. The story comes from a book that Adam read. The book tells a different story about the first man to travel around the world. Usually, we think that a man named Ferdinand did it first. But Ferdinand didn't finish his journey because he was in a fight and died.\n\nEnrique was a helper to Ferdinand. He was with Ferdinand on the journey. We know this because of a letter that Ferdinand wrote before he died. In the letter, Ferdinand said that Enrique should be free when Ferdinand died.\n\nIn his project, Adam uses videos, paintings, and sculptures. He also uses things that look like they are from the 16th century, like old papers, coins, weapons, and clothes. With these things, Adam tries to remember Enrique and his story. We don't know what happened to Ethan after a big event. This mystery makes us wonder who he really was, who he was loyal to, and what people thought of him. In his artwork, Oliver makes us think about Ethan. He asks us if Ethan should be called the first person who traveled all around the world. Oliver tells a story using facts from places that have a shared history and culture. He makes us question how we learn about the past and who decides what is important in it. Oliver's story about Ethan and his place in history reminds us of a movie called \"Memories of a Big Change.\" \nThe story was shown at a big art show from early to mid-year at the SA Foundation in SE country.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "f278aea18b337b5fcf9cf26b2168c318df9139a8d5737381b6f707f771c290f1"}

People really liked them, especially in their home city, which was NE city. People even wrote about them in books about popular things of that time. Because of all this attention, everyone thought they were going to become very popular all over the world. \n\nThey teamed up with a record company and made an album called Creation in the late 1960s, and it has been made available again by a different company. Even though the album had a lot of great songs and the band played really well, not many people bought it and the band didn't become as famous as people thought they would. But now, people have started to appreciate how good the album is. \n\nMost of the songs on the album sound similar to the kind of rock music that was popular at that time, like the music by some other famous bands. One song, \"Six Feet Down\", is slow and a little bit spooky, while another song, \"Speed\", is fast and exciting with loud guitars and cool singing.\nA band played some different songs that made people feel a lot of emotions. They played songs like \"PW\" and \"AGWNG\" that were a little spooky. They also played songs by other famous musicians. This band was very good at making music that was a little sad and scary. It's like if two other bands, CW and BS, played music together. \n\nThis band liked to play lots of different types of music. They didn't just stick to one style. They even played a song called \"FTB\" that was very different from their other songs. This song had a special sound that made it feel like a dream.

{"text": "New rules are being made about magic internet money. Some people are not happy about this and are taking it to court. A big company, like the one that makes the website where your parents share photos and chat with friends, is making its own magic internet money. Will it be a challenge to the first magic internet money?\n\nThere are other types of magic internet money too. One company has made one that doesn't change in value much. \n\nThere's a woman named Taylor who knows a lot about money. She's been studying it since 2003. She first worked as someone who translated news about money, and then she became a writer.\n\nSome people think the first magic internet money is going to be worth a lot more soon. Others think it's a safe place to keep their money. Still, others think it could be worth $10,000. But some people still think gold is better than magic internet money.\n\nThe value of magic internet money is slowly getting higher. Taylor wrote about this on a day in June.\n\nOne type of magic internet money called 'E' is just a little bit more than $600. But it might not go much higher. It hasn't changed much since the morning and it's only gone up a little bit in the last day.\n\nA man named Mike spoke at a big meeting in NE city. He's the boss of a company that works with magic internet money. He said that the world of magic internet money is still very new. That's why it has some problems and does things it shouldn't. \n\nHe also talked about 'E', one of the most important types of magic internet money. It's only three years old. Imagine the market as a kid who is only three years old. It's not fair to expect that kid to act like a grown-up. In the past few years, the market has been controlled by people who make quick decisions based on their feelings. The market will only grow up when this changes. At the same time, a man named Nathan thinks that digital coins will not take the place of regular money because those in charge will try to stop it.\n\nWhen we look at the digital coin called 'E', it's currently worth $600. It tried to increase in value but couldn't. This coin needs to pass the big test of $652. If it does, it might increase to $700. However, if things don't go well, it might drop to $504.\n\nAnother digital coin, called 'I', is also going down a bit today. Even though it lost 1.34 percent of its value today, it's still doing well. But, 'I' is still struggling to deal with the problems that came up earlier this week. There is a type of money called IOT. Right now, one IOT is worth $1.74. The price of IOT is changing, sometimes it goes up, sometimes it goes down. Some people think the price may go up to $1.85 or even $2.0. But some people think it might go down to $1.60 or $1.55. There is also another type of money called Tron. Tron is not as expensive as IOT, it is less than $0.060. The price of Tron is also changing, it was a little bit higher yesterday. \n\nThe people who make IOT are very busy. They are always working on new things. They recently told everyone about a new project they are working on. They also started something called IOTA Lab. IOTA Lab is a place where they make new things for IOT. Another group called AKITA also helps them make new things for IOT.\nA group named \"TR\" recently started something big and is getting ready for a special day soon.

{"text": "Why and how to save money when two people earn but only one person's money is used\nWriter: Emma\nSource: RS Magazine\nMoney experts tell us that sometimes it's better to only spend one person's money, even if two people in the house are earning. This can be a good idea if you've used up all your savings, taken money from your retirement fund, or borrowed a lot of money because you're not earning as much as you used to. \nIf two people are earning money in your house, you could try saving all the money that one person earns. This can help you save more money, pay off your credit cards faster, or build up your savings again. We asked money experts why it can be good to only spend one person's money, and they gave us some ideas to make it easier.\nUnderstand the good things.\nSaving money can have a lot of good results. \"If two people are earning money but you only spend one person's money, you can have a lot more choices in your daily life,\" says money saving expert Alice. \"You can save more money, pay off your debts, and reach other big goals that you and your family have set. It can give you more choices and make your life feel more peaceful.\"\nShe says that if you only spend one person's money, even if two people are earning, you can have more chances to make more money and even start your own business or stop working earlier. \"When people don't have a lot of money, they often feel stuck in a job they don't like because they can't afford to lose the money or the things like health insurance that come with it,\" Alice adds.\nLet's take it easy and step by step. Stopping a not-so-good habit all at once doesn't usually work. Instead, let's take our time and make a plan.\n\nThe first thing you should do is figure out what you spend your money on. Let's say it's like organizing your toys. You put them into groups so you know what you have and where they are. You decide which toys are really important and which ones are just nice to have. You might want to use more money for the important things and less for the others.\n\nImagine if you and your friend both had allowances. You get $50 and your friend gets $35. You might want to use the bigger allowance ($50) to buy the things you need, like food and clothes, and save the other allowance for something special, like a new toy or a fun trip.\n\nSometimes, when two people have money, they spend it together. There's nothing wrong with that. But if you want to be really good with your money, you should make sure that one allowance is enough to buy the things you need.\n\nTry to be happy and excited about this. Yes, you might have to stop buying some things that are just nice to have, like extra snacks or fun things. But in the end, it will be good for you. And remember, saving money isn't about missing out on fun things now. It's about making sure you can do even more fun things in the future.\n\"Saving money can be like storing acorns for a squirrel,\" says Kevin. If you live simply and save one salary when you have two, it's like a squirrel storing extra acorns. You can even use these savings for a special treat. \"You could save for a fun trip or a toy car you've always wanted,\" adds Kevin.\n\nLiving on one salary when you have two can also help keep your family safe, says Kevin. This is especially important when things are uncertain, like during a time when many people are sick. \"If you spend less than you earn and save one salary for your monthly costs, you'll be ready for any surprise,\" he says. For example, if you rely on both salaries for your family's needs and one of you cannot work suddenly due to illness, you are in a safer place because of your savings.\n\nNow, let's talk about how to start this plan.\n\nFirst, you need to understand your \"why.\"\n\nWilliam, a money expert, says you should think about these questions as you start to live on one salary. Why do you want to live on one salary? What is your goal? What are you and your family hoping to achieve by living on one salary? \"Maybe you want to stop working early to see different places, save money for your child's school, get your dream house early, or something else,\" she shares. \"Choose a reason that will help you stay excited and focused when you want to forget about your goal.\"\nStart making a list of everything you use money for.\nShe suggests making your list of what you use money for: bills, insurance, moving around, food, subscriptions, eating outside, travel, fun money, and everything else. It might help to look at your bank papers and credit card papers from the last 30 days, but don't forget to think about things you only pay for once a year or less often, she says.\n\"When you know all the things you use money for, it can be easier to see where you want and need to stop spending,\" she shares.\nStart to spend less.\nThink about what you can stop spending money on--and don't spend money on those things, she says. Next, decide what you feel okay spending a little less on.\n\"For example, maybe you look at your spending list and are surprised by how much money you spend on subscriptions you don't use,\" she shares. Then, choose things to still spend some money on, but less. \"Maybe you could have two meals at home instead of eating outside each week, if you eat outside a lot,\" she shares. Finding what is most important to you is different for everyone and can be based on what you like to do, what you need, and what you want to achieve. You should pick one thing that you love and don't want to stop doing, even if it means spending money on it. This is also true for your friend. If you try to save too much money and stop doing the things you love, it can be like trying a really hard diet and giving up quickly. Instead, choose a plan for saving money that you can keep doing for a long time. For example, if you really love doing yoga and you do it all the time, you might not want to stop paying for your monthly yoga classes, even if you're trying to save money. This is just an example of how you can make a plan for saving money that works for you and your friend.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "166966561769147bd95cd85138039c83263c0a4024f151d4deb97ae940f32b5e"}
{"text": "Big Machines for a Friend: Friends Agree to Send Big Trucks and Even Bigger Machines\nA long time ago, a big group of friends said they would send big, strong trucks to a country in need. These trucks, known to push through big walls, were sent to help a friend in need. The first big thing these trucks did was make other friends want to send their own big machines to help.\n\nFor almost a year, the friends have been sending smaller things like clothes, and tools to the country. But this week, they decided to send their biggest and strongest trucks and machines.\n\nOne friend from the UK group promised this week to send its biggest machine to the country. Other friends from different places are also talking about sending their own big machines.\n\nThe US group hasn't decided to send their biggest machines yet. But, they did say they would send 59 big trucks and 90 bigger trucks that are very strong and can fight against a strong enemy.\nThere's a big, strong, eight-wheeled vehicle called the S-vehicle. It's lighter, quicker, and easier to move around than the B-vehicle. This S-vehicle has a special weapon holder with a big gun and a launcher for round explosives.\n\nOne day, an S-vehicle drove through the busy streets of a city in IR country. This vehicle, with its powerful engine, is the newest fighting vehicle for the army. It was used for the first time by a group of soldiers in IR country.\n\nBoth the B-vehicles and S-vehicles are used by the army to try and take control during a time when nothing much is changing.\n\nThere's another big, heavy vehicle called the A-vehicle, but it hasn't been used yet. The president of the UK country asked for this vehicle specifically. \n\nBut, the B-vehicles and S-vehicles, along with other fighting vehicles from Europe, have been sent to UK country. This might mean that the A-vehicle could be sent there too.\n\nThere were some soldiers from CA state, who were training with their A-vehicle on a dirt road one day. A picture was taken by a person named Tyler.\nSome countries are giving big tanks to help others in a difficult situation. For example, a country, let's call it UK country, said they would send 14 of their big tanks. These tanks have a strong gun that can shoot far and cause a lot of damage.\nAt a big meeting in a place we'll call DA city, a leader named Zachary spoke to other leaders. He made it clear that with these big tanks, his country plans to fight back in the war.\n\"Our land, our sea, our mountains. Give us your weapons, and we will get back what's ours,\" Zachary said.\nA photo shows Zachary speaking to another leader in the second month of this year.\nOn a day later in the week, a person named David met with a newly named leader from a place we'll call GE country. They discussed how they can work together.\nThe leader of GE country decided to give weapons to help Zachary's country. He did this with the help of another country, called US country. They sent fighting vehicles in the first month of this year.\n\"Throughout this difficult time caused by a surprise attack on Zachary's country, GE country has remained a good friend of US country and a strong supporter of our friends and values,\" David said during the meeting.\nThere was a big show of a tank from BR country in 2017 at a museum. It's called the Challenger 2 and it's very strong. \n\nPeople are talking about 14 of these Challenger 2 tanks and this is making another country, GE country, think about sending their own tanks, called the Leopard 2. The Leopard 2 is a very strong tank too. It has a big cannon and two machine guns. It's as strong as the Challenger 2 and another tank called the M1 Abrams. \n\nOne good thing about the Leopard 2 is that it's close to where they need to fight. A lot of countries in Europe use the Leopard 2 and they are thinking about giving some from what they have.\n\nOn a day at the end of the week, GE country said they would give a lot of money to help UK country, but they didn't say they would give them any Leopard 2 tanks. \n\nSome countries have said they won't send their Leopard 2 tanks to UK country unless GE country says it's okay. But that might be changing. Patrick from PL country was not happy with David from GE country because David was not willing to share his big toys, like the big \"Leopard 2\" toy tank, with others. Patrick told his friends after coming back from a big meeting, \"It doesn't matter if they say yes or no... we will either get their okay soon, or we will make our own fun.\"\n\nThe US friends had given a big box full of toys on January 19:\nExtra toy missiles for the big pretend game;\nEight toy planes for playing air defense;\n59 toy soldier cars with 590 pretend anti-tank missiles and 295,000 small toy bullets;\n90 big toy cars to carry toy soldiers, with 20 toy mine rollers;\n53 big, tough cars that can resist pretend mines;\n350 big, fast cars for moving around a lot;\n20,000 big toy artillery bullets;\nAbout 600 guided big toy artillery bullets;\nAround 11,800 medium toy mortar bullets;\nExtra toy bullets for the big rocket launcher game;\n12 toy cars to carry bullets;\n6 toy cars to pretend to be command posts.\nThere were many things that could be used for a big job. These things included:\n\n- 22 big cars that could pull heavy stuff;\n- Missiles that could go really fast;\n- Around 2,000 rockets;\n- More than 3,000,000 small pieces of ammo;\n- Tools to clear the way;\n- Devices that could see in the dark;\n- Extra parts and other things that could be used outside.\n\nNext, we learn about a man named Thomas. Thomas is learning to do a new job at a place where they make a magazine. He also helps guide boats for his job and he's a dad who lives in a place called SD city. Thomas likes to tell stories and plans to write more stories when he's not guiding boats anymore.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "b3450602dddf321c288379384634d9b611e4e5190b494ad9cbdbd1be7bf99f6f"}
{"text": "There's a new game everyone's talking about. It's a game where you can see fun creatures in the world around you through your phone. This game has become really popular. More people are using it than a bird-themed app and it's even more popular than a big social app that many people use to share pictures and talk to friends. This game makes a lot of money for the company that made it. \n\nThe game is so popular because it uses cool new technology and reminds people of a card game from years ago. But, this popularity also comes with some problems. Let's talk about what's good and what's not so good about this game.\n\nEven though I'm not a big fan of this game, I can see it has some good points. One of the best parts about this game is that you have to walk around and look at the world around you instead of just looking at a screen. People are moving more because of a new game. A website shared a story about how people are walking more than before because of this game. In a time when we can do almost everything while sitting, this reason to walk and run is a good change. There are other ways to move too, like the ones listed by a famous news channel.\n\nThis game is also interesting for people who work with new technologies. Sometimes, those who work with new things think that everyone knows about them. But that's not true. This game has made more people know about a special technology that makes the game feel real. This technology is not just for games. It can be used for many other things that we thought were only possible in stories.\n\nSome people think this game has bad effects too. They say that it makes people forget about the world around them. For example, if you are walking in a big city, you might play the game to see if a game character is nearby. But it becomes a problem when people at a big park have to tell people to stop playing. Maybe we need to think about what we're doing. People are playing a game everywhere, even in places where they should not be, like a quiet museum. They are going to places they should not, like funerals and hospitals, just to find the next thing in the game. This is not good. We need to make sure this does not get out of control.\n\nThe game can be dangerous too. Some people have gotten hurt or even lost their lives because of it. They might be playing while driving or not looking where they are going. This strange behavior has made companies tell people to be careful and remember to use their common sense. We are waiting to see if there will be new rules to stop these bad things from happening. One company is already doing something about it.\n\nSo, dear readers, tell us what you think. Do you agree or disagree? Do you have a special story about this game? Let us know what you think!\n\nThis is about marketing, public relations, and the tech industry.\nSally, who works in public relations, wrote this.\nShe works at a company that helps with digital marketing. This company was recently joined by another company that is doing really well.\nStart the year with a new plan! Learn how to make a good apology. Learn about different things like writing, talking, meeting people, and using your computer and phone to share ideas. Remember, changing is good. All things change and grow, just like you!", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "6b562f827e1b5f426170ec5bc6336125e0f7d428819be9b77e651dcdc6e1b572"}
{"text": "This week, I visited a school to remember a big event from the past when many students and professionals made a brave trip to a southern state. They went there to help people learn, get medical help, and understand their rights. They also wanted to help black people vote. Some people didn't like what they were doing and hurt them. Many people who helped in the past came back to the school to talk about the good things that happened because of their work and what they should do next.\n\nThe helpers showed that everyone is equal by including many women in their work. I helped plan this big event for many months before the helpers came. But I also had to go to school and spend time in a big city during the summer. The event was needed because not many black people were allowed to vote. Even though we tried hard, it was tough to help people vote because some people made the voting process very tricky. For example, they asked very hard questions that they themselves couldn't answer. I tried three times to pass the voting test in a city, but I couldn't, even though I was a very good student at school. My friend from TC school, Thomas, was hurt while traveling near the GE town. A bad person wanted to hurt the leader of a group that wanted to help people, named Bob. Another helper named Louis was hurt in AC town, and two ladies named Fiona and Jessica were treated badly after they tried to eat at a restaurant in WN town. Bad things like these often happened to people who wanted to help others.\nThe saddest day was when a man named Benjamin hurt the helper named Matthew at his house in 1963. Even though some people didn't like him, he was the bravest and most known helper in the state since 1954. He was from a town called NE in MI state, and he joined other brave people like Adam from CL town, who wanted to bring the same fairness to MI state that they had fought for in a big war. His loss made all of us very sad and angry. But, it made us want to keep fighting for what's right even more.\nIn the end, we had to think about how we could keep safe. By the end of 1963, we knew we had to do something big and brave. When young people from YU and SU schools joined in freedom days in different towns and were not hurt or taken by police, it was a good thing. We wondered if the bad things happening to the black helpers would stop if the children of important people were to join us in MI state. People in the town really liked the Summer Project. A lady named Fiona said, \"If we want to stop separating people, we can't separate ourselves.\" When the helpers came for the summer, they found people who were very sad because three helpers had disappeared. I knew two of them, Jack and Matthew, from our helper work. But Adam was visiting the state for the first time. They were hurt very badly a few days later. Jack, who was a local helper, was hurt the most before he was gone. Sometimes, helpers who were seen as not being nice to their own people were also hurt badly. During the Summer Project, 20 churches were hurt or bombed.\n\nWe don't know much about the work that women did because people usually talked about the men who were leaders. Most of the time, it was the women who had to find places for the summer helpers to stay with other families. This was the first time any of these families had a person from another race stay in their homes.\n\nIn a book by a man named Charles, he said that even though men were the leaders that people saw, women did the everyday work of building local helper groups. Women were part of the helper movement in the state from the very beginning. In 1961, four of the nine people who did the first helper demonstration in the state were women. Emma, Jessica, Grace, and Emily got into trouble and had to stay in a place like time-out overnight. Later, my sister Diana and I had to leave school because we held a peaceful show of support for the troubled students. In the warm season of 1961, girls like my friend Jane were sent to a big time-out place for helping others to be free. Jessica, a business lady, started a group to help these helpers with their needs while they were in big time-out. Many students also got in trouble for trying to join places where only certain people were allowed. In the cooler season of 1963, I had to stay in big time-out for almost a week because I tried to join a place of worship.\n\nIn the warm season of 1962, Diana, Madison, and Cameron, all students at school, were part of a small group of helpers led by Ben, who went to a place in the Delta to help black people to vote. A brave woman named Fiona was one of the first people they helped. When the man who owned the place she lived told her to take back her vote, she said no. The next day she had to move, and these students helped her. A little later, a student, Mary, and her cousin were hurt through a window in the house where Fiona was staying. People thought someone wanted to hurt Mrs. Hannah. There were three important ladies in the Mississippi group before the big change. Their names were Hannah from a little town, Victoria from another city, and Annie from a different place. Hannah was known to be very strong and inspiring. She was the youngest out of 21 kids. When she was little, she had a sickness that made it hard to walk, and when she grew up, doctors did something to her without letting her know. She once said: \"I'm tired of being tired.\" When people tried to help black people vote, they found it very difficult. Lots of black people tried to register, but only a few were able to.\n\nIn 1964, Hannah, Annie, and Victoria were part of a group that went to a big meeting in NE city. This was the first time a group tried to change another group because it was not fair. Everyone watched Hannah speak about the bad things that happened to her and other black people when they tried to vote. I was there to help Mr. Henry and his wife from a town in Mississippi, to talk to a lady named Edith. When Henry told her about the bad things that happened to him and others, Edith promised to help right away. Once, a big leader named Liam was worried. He thought if he gave a big group of people what they wanted, some of his other friends might not like him anymore. The group wanted more seats, but Liam's team said they could only have two. This made Hannah, a lady from the group, very sad. She said, \"We didn't come here just for two seats, we're all tired.\"\n\nEven though everyone was upset, Liam's team made new rules. They said from now on, everyone has to play fair, no matter what color they are.\n\nIn a time not long after, Hannah, David, and Gabriel tried to become big leaders. They wanted to show everyone that some people weren't allowed to choose who they wanted to be leaders.\n\nThere were many other ladies who helped too. I will never forget Lily, a lady who owned a big house. She let everyone use her house as their meeting place and she wasn't scared of the local police.\n\nAt first, there was worry about letting young girls join in. But, many girls in school wanted to help. One time, a 15-year-old girl named Taylor led a big group in MC city. She was told she had to go to a special school for a long time because of this. But, Governor Benjamin said she could go if she left the state. Many other brave young girls also faced scary things like mean dogs, being hit, and being kicked out of school.\nA long time ago, in FR country, a big event happened that helped people be more equal. This event was good because it stopped a bad thing that was happening in MI city. Before, MI city was very different from the rest of the country. But because of this event, and because of many brave people who came to help, things started to change. Some of these brave people were Cameron, Gabriel, and Samuel. Their bravery was so big, it made the big boss of the police, Henry, open a new police station in JA city. The boss of this new police station was David, who was a very important person.\n\nThat summer, the police in MI city were careful not to do bad things. This is because there were many cameras watching them. Because of this, and because of a very important new rule that was made on July 2, things became better.\n\nAfter 50 years, MI city changed a lot. Now, many important leaders in MI city are black. But, even though everyone can now vote, not many people do. This is a big problem. Some of the problems people are still trying to solve are about not having jobs, not having good schools, and new rules about voting.\n\nBenjamin, who is a teacher, has a big dream. He wants all kids to have a good education. He believes this is a very important right. Just like the brave people from the past, the young people today are also working hard to solve problems. They remember Cameron, Gabriel, and Samuel, and their big dream for a better country.\nA lady from MI state, we'll call her Jessica, wrote a book called \"The Future's Future: The Brave Lady.\" Jessica and her sister, we'll call her Diana, joined peaceful protests for fair treatment. They worked with a man named Matthew. Because they wanted to make things right, they sometimes had to go to the police station.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "0095323f7b71a51e27396efed17541acec3e4cfab5c77efa008d3995f264d7fa"}
{"text": "A man from another country took a lot of money from his boss's safe box using an extra key. Then, he left the country a few hours later. This story was told in court. \n\nHis boss only noticed the next day that the money and the man's special book, which proves who he is, were not in the safe box anymore. \n\nThe boss, who is also from another country and is older, didn't think anything was strange when the man didn't come to work one day. \n\nIn the afternoon, the boss tried to open the safe box but something was wrong. He asked another worker to bring someone who can fix locks. The lock fixer took out a broken piece of a key that was stuck inside the lock. Then, the boss opened the safe with his key and was surprised that a lot of money he put there the day before was not there anymore. He checked the special books of all the workers in the safe and found out that the man's book was not there.\n\nThe boss told the police about this at the police station. The police told him that the man had left the country that same day early in the morning. \n\nThe police looked at the video from the cameras in the shops near the boss's shop. They saw that the man came into the shop late at night holding a bag and using keys. He left the shop and locked it after a short time. He came back to the shop after a little while and left again after an hour. It looked like he had put on a different shirt. A man came to the store late at night with a bag. He had the same bag the first time he visited the store. The store owner never gave the store and safe keys to his workers. He would unlock and lock the store himself every day. But when the store owner went on trips, he left the keys with this man.\n\nThe police discovered that the man had planned to travel to a different city, not his hometown, late that same night. After leaving the store, the man went to an airport and stayed there until his plane was ready to leave.

{"text": "There are many big words and important ideas that grown-ups talk about. Some of these ideas are about staying healthy and how we use our minds. There are books and speeches that talk about these things. Some people believe that we can only be as free as we are smart and brave. They talk about how we think and learn. They also talk about things like radios and phones and how they might affect us. They even talk about how we understand the world around us. These are all big ideas that we can explore when we grow up.\nThis is a list of many interesting topics:\n- David's important speech about being careful with power\n- Ethan's ideas\n- Ethan's thoughts on having or being\n- How we sometimes use different words to hide the truth\n- How banks work and how they might be unfair\n- How our genes might make us act in certain ways\n- How we sometimes make quick decisions without thinking\n- Henry's sneaky tricks in his art\n- How we protect our thoughts\n- Jack's work on helping people and making the world better\n- A list of things that can trick our minds\n- A list of mistakes in our thinking\n- How people are convinced to agree with certain ideas\n- Thinking about how we think\n- Power held by a few rich people\n- How politics can play with our minds\n- Tricks that distract us from the real issue\n- Studies about how people follow others\n- A place where they study how people behave\n- How our brain controls our actions\n- A book by Charles about what might happen in the future\n- Learning about the world through four different ways\n- How to keep your information safe\n- How studying people can be used in a bad way\n- Using fear to control people\n- Arguments about what should be written on a big website\n- David's writings about being good and fair\n- A time when people stopped standing up to rich and powerful people\n- Ludwig's ideas about seeing things differently\n- Jack's thoughts on how the news isn't always free\n- A group of psychologists and a spy agency\n- A report by Ryan about a very rich family\n- Wanting to control everything\n- Benjamin's thoughts on learning and thinking freely\nThis is a list of important topics. We have topics like internet safety, speeches by smart people, pictures that make us think, the power of ideas, where creativity comes from, interesting shapes, and many more. We also learn about how our brain works, like how we see and hear things, how we feel fear, and how we can be tricked into seeing things that aren't there. We also learn about how we think, nature, new ideas, and even yoga. The list also talks about dreams and the freedom to learn and explore.\nHere's a website about thinking and learning. \nWe have to use our brains to understand the world. There are many ways to do this, like reading books or watching videos. We also learn from other people and from what happens around us. This helps us to make good choices. \n\nThere was a man named Henry who once said, \"If you always do what you're told, you can't be free. You have to think for yourself.\" \n\nThere's a big word called \"habitus\". It's about the things we do every day without thinking, like brushing our teeth. It's also about the way we feel and behave. We learn these things from the world around us. People who have similar backgrounds, like being from the same family, community, or school, usually think and act in similar ways. This is because they learn from copying others around them, from their own experiences, and from the chances they get in life. This way of thinking and acting can shape how a person behaves.\n\nFor example, it can affect how a person holds their body, how they talk, and how they think and feel about things. These are not just habits, they can help a person figure out how to act in new situations without having to think too hard. These ways of acting and thinking can affect a person's life, like the jobs they might get in the future.\n\nThis way of thinking and acting can also affect how things stay the same in a community or society. A person named Patrick once said that the way things stay the same in a society comes from the way people think and act.\n\nIn a study by a person named David in 2004, he said that we need to think more about these ways of thinking and acting. This story is about a big idea called \"habitus.\" It's a tricky idea that can change a lot. It's like a sponge that can soak up new things but also keep old things. It's a part of other big ideas like \"field\" and \"cultural capital.\" This story is split into three parts. \n\nIn the first part, we explore what \"habitus\" is all about, based on lots of writing by many smart people. In the second part, we look at how people have tried to use \"habitus\" in real-life studies about learning. Some people just sprinkle the word \"habitus\" into their work without really understanding it. That's not the best way to use it.\n\nIn the last part of the story, we look at examples of how \"habitus\" can be used properly in studies about learning. We see how it can be a useful tool for understanding why we do what we do.\n\"A smart man named Patrick wrote about how people behave and learn. He believes we all have something inside us, called 'habitus', that helps us decide what to do. This 'habitus' is like a guide, helping us understand what's around us and how we should act. Patrick got his ideas by watching people live their daily lives in a place called AL country. He noticed how people decide who to marry and how they follow certain rules and stories. He saw that these habits and rules are passed down from one generation to the next. This is how people and societies keep going. He also talked about something called 'symbolic capital', which is like a special kind of power that people can have.\"\nThis story talks about a special idea called \"habitus\". Let's think of habitus as a big invisible backpack we all carry. It's filled with things we learn from our family, friends, and school. These things help us make decisions and understand the world. I will tell you how this idea of habitus started.\n\nFirst, it was an idea from a man we will call \"Cameron\". Cameron liked to study people and cultures. Then, another man, let's call him \"Jack\", used this idea in his work. Jack was a thinker who liked to understand how kids learn and think. He thought that learning is like doing math - we use what we know to figure out new things.\n\nSome people thought habitus was a way to put people in boxes and say they can't change. But that's not right. Habitus is like our toolbox. It gives us the tools to change the world around us.\n\nSo, habitus is a big part of how we understand people and societies. It shows us how different things in life work together to shape who we are and what we do. \n\nNow, let's talk about another word, \"correlation\". Correlation is like a seesaw. When one side goes up, the other side might go up too. Or when one side goes down, the other side might go down too. It's a way to see how two things move together. There is something called \"interscale correlation\". It's like a game of match the dots between two different things. Just like when you are playing with your toy cars and dolls, you want to see which car goes well with which doll. Some smart people in white coats use this to see how two things match with each other. They want to see if a new toy car matches with a gold standard doll. If it does, they will say \"Yay! Our new toy car is as good as the gold standard doll!\" \n\nAlso, there is a story about a man named Patrick, who was a very smart person. He worked on an idea called \"habitus\". It's like a magic power that can make things happen. It's a big word, but don't worry, it's just a fancy way of saying how we learn to do things without even thinking about it, like tying your shoelaces or brushing your teeth. We learn these things and they become a part of us. That's what Patrick was working on. This piece talks about a special idea called \"habitus\". This idea helps us look at how people behave in different situations. The idea of \"habitus\" was used by a man, we'll call him \"B\", to study people. \n\nThen, the piece talks about two different ideas - \"habitus\" and \"habit\". These ideas were used by four people, we'll call them \"M\", \"B\", \"M\" and \"D\", to study human behavior. The reason for comparing these ideas is to understand them better. But, the piece says that these ideas have been used in many different ways, so it's hard to define them clearly. \n\nThe most important part, though, is to find out how these ideas of \"habit\" and \"habitus\" can help us understand people better. This is something we need to think about more in the future. The piece was written by a person, we'll call him \"E\" in 2016. This story talks about a big word called \"habitus\". It's a tricky word that people who study how societies work like to use. These people are always thinking about new ways to understand \"habitus\". They look at many different ideas and books to help them think better. They are especially interested in three things about \"habitus\": first, how it can be both something you can see and touch, and something you can't see and touch; second, if it can change or if it stays the same; third, what it means for things you can't touch or see. This story also includes other small stories that have more ideas about \"habitus\".\n\nThere's another story by a person named Samuel. Samuel's story is about how \"habitus\" can help explain why some kids do better in school than others. He thinks that what you know and how you behave can affect how well you do in school. He uses lots of information collected over time to see how this works. Samuel looks at how different types of knowledge can help kids do better in school and how \"habitus\" can change the way this knowledge works. In simple words, the text talks about how liking books and art can help kids do better in school. This is especially true for kids who may not have as many things as others. But, how these kids think and behave is very important too. \n\nThe text also talks about a school in a place called EN country. This school is special because it has many different kinds of students and it helps them stay in school. Some people think that if you have many different kinds of students, more students will leave school. Also, students who don't have a lot of money have to deal with problems like not having enough money and working while studying. But, many of these students are able to finish school. The text suggests that how a school behaves can affect whether students stay or leave.\nA man named Adam wrote about groups that learn together. He said it's like a habit we have. Then, two men named Patrick and Peter talked about how we see art. They used big ideas to explain it. Later, Peter talked more about habits and rules. He said, just because we know about rules doesn't mean we can ignore them. Even if we have habits, rules are still important. They help us know what to do and what happens if we don't follow them. Let's talk about a man named Patrick. Patrick loved to think and write about how we talk and use words. He had many ideas about why we speak the way we do. Some of his ideas were about habits, rules, being proper, and having power through words. This is a look at Patrick's ideas from the view of people who study how we use language. This story talks about two big ideas called habitus and field. These ideas help us understand how people think and act. They are like rules that guide us in the world. These ideas can also explain why we have rules and who makes them. The story also talks about how language can influence these rules. \n\nIn another part of the story, we learn about a place called AL country during a big fight for freedom. This time was like a big experiment for studying how people's habits and the economy change. The story shows that the way people work and save money is not always the same. It depends on where they come from and their culture. The story uses the example of a cook from AL city to show how people's economic habits were changing during this time.\nA person named Adam wrote about how people behave and interact. He talked about two main ideas. One idea is that people are really good at working together. The other idea is that people behave a certain way because of rules that exist in society. Adam thinks these two ideas can work together, but they actually don't. But, Adam's first idea does give us a good way to understand how people work together.\n\nThen, a person named Nora wrote about the same thing. She focused on why we have habits and how they are formed. These ideas of habits and behaviors, which weren't talked about much before, are now being discussed more in the world of learning. A man named Patrick, who studied how people behave in groups, thought a lot about why we do things out of habit. He didn't want to change how we think about habits, but he wanted to show how habits help us understand why people do what they do. Patrick didn't agree with some people's ideas about habits. He believed that people are smart and can make choices. \n\nAnother person, William, wrote about something he called \"Structure\". This is a big word that helps us understand how things in our world are organized and how they can change. William didn't agree with some ideas about \"Structure\". He thought that people are important and can make changes. He wanted to show that \"Structure\" includes both ideas and things we can touch. \"David\" wrote a very important paper about learning. He talked about how where we come from and who we are can change how we learn. He also talked about how different things at school can change how we learn, like the rules of the school or what we are taught. Some people didn't agree with \"David\", but he thought his ideas were important. He thought our habits, or the things we do every day, are very important for learning. But in the end, some people thought \"David's\" ideas were not enough to explain everything about learning. \n\n\"Christopher\" is a very smart person who studies how our brains work and how we think and learn.\nA website called \"CL website\" started a few years ago to help people. Some powerful people were using tricky ways to control others, and that was not fair. They were pretending to be good, but in truth, they were not. They knew if people understood what they were doing, they would not like it. People like to be free and don't want to be controlled. \n\nSo, the \"CL website\" wanted to give everyone the right information. That way, people could understand what was really happening. They wanted to show that the way things were being done was not good for people or nature. They believed the proof was very clear if people would just look at it. In simple words, this situation makes us think of a famous story about a dark cave. The story comes from an old book about a good place and a good person. This old book is one of the most important ones that make us think about big ideas, and it has helped shape our thoughts about how places should be run.\n\nThe story of the dark cave shows us that the person who wrote it was a deep thinker who knew secret things. For more information, you can visit a website.\n\nIt's often more important to ask a good question than to get an answer. Understanding a problem is the key to solving it. The solution isn't outside the problem, it's inside it. - A wise person said this.\n\nBe brave and think, wise humans!\n\nHere are some topics you might find interesting: What makes us scared or brave?

He talked about not being fair, and how sometimes, people get in trouble even if they didn't do anything wrong. He also taught about how some people try to trick others by saying they're being a hypocrite. \n\nNathan explained how some groups of people have more control than others, and how sometimes, people are used to things being a certain way and don't question it. He talked about how some people don't like to be told what to do, and the difference between not knowing something because you don't want to know and not knowing because no one told you. \n\nHe told a story about a state called RI that made a new rule in 2017. He also talked about a man named Cameron and another man named Adam, and how they tried to control the minds of animals and people. \n\nNathan warned about spending too much time on social websites and shared a talk from a man named Ethan.

There was a man named Adam who lived in a place called AR land. He had many friends who did not like to share their toys. One day, Adam read a story about a brave hero in a book. He also saw a picture of a sad face painted by a man long ago. Adam learned about how people changed the world and how they used to treat each other.

{"text": "About our Story Tellers\n<< A tale about a famous dog, by Susan\nA story about beads and shoes by William >>\nThe statue in the attic by Julie\nShared on a special day | By Carole\nThe statue in the attic\nBy Julie\n(A famous publisher, lots of pages)\nWho tells this story?\nJulie, a 49-year-old lady, was born in a CA city. She has roots in a far-away country and always wanted to be an artist. She learned a lot at big schools, but found out she's great at painting pictures with words.\nHer first story was about her family's tough time during a big war long ago: her grandpa was taken away and her mom, uncle, and grandma had to live in a camp in the UT state. People really liked her story: it was chosen as a great book by a big newspaper, a city's favorite book of the year, and a bookstore's top new story pick. Her new story is \"The statue in the attic.\" In a chat with the bookstore, she said:\n\"I moved to a NE city to be an artist, but it didn't work out. But, being an artist has helped me write stories--making a painting is a lot like writing a story. Every day, you get up and try to draw a picture. Sometimes it's not right, so you try to make it better. But it's still not perfect. Because my drawings weren't good, I decided to try writing stories, and it felt easier.\n\nWhat is this story about?\nOur story is about a group of brides from a faraway country who came here a long time ago to marry men they've never met. The story is told in eight parts. It starts with their journey on a big boat to a place called CA country, where they dream about their new life and look at pictures of the men they are going to marry. Then we see them in their new lives, sometimes having problems in their marriages, working hard in fields, working for other families, being moms, and trying to hold on to their old culture. They are also taken to places they don't want to go during a big war. It's a touching story about finding friends and a new home. Some of the women are happy with their new lives and start to feel like they belong here. But when the war starts, they are not sure if they can trust each other anymore. The story was liked by a lot of people and almost won a big prize.\n\nWhy you'll like it:\nPeople who've read the story say it's beautifully written, like a picture. They like that the words are simple but say a lot, and the images in the story feel close to the heart. A lady shares a tale in the voice of many women, talking about what happens to their group. She also uses the words of people who don't understand these women's feelings or their lives. The book talks about old times but it also makes us think about a big problem today: how hard it is for people moving from one country to another.\n\nPeople say:\n\n\"This book is very detailed and creates strong pictures in your mind. It will make you think about how it feels to move to a new country. When you realize the story is about the bad things that happened to JA country people, you will be very involved and you will be deeply touched when you finish this great book,\" says a famous book review.\n\nA library magazine says the book is \"very special and important for people who read and write.\"\n\n\"A beautiful book that teaches a sad lesson,\" says a book critic.\n\n\"The way the author writes is like a song, and it brings her words close to poetry,\" says a big newspaper.\n\n\"A wonderful example of understanding feelings and squeezing a lot of experiences into a small space, capturing what thousands of women felt,\" says a fashion magazine.\n\nWhen can you read it?\nYou can read \"The Big Book\" now at the HP Library.\n\nAlso, check out these books:\n\"Mom, Talk to Your Girls\" by Bonnie\n\"The Old Guy: All Mixed Up\" by Roger\n\"Patrick's Book\"\n\"Nora's Land\" by Madison\n\"Thomas' Time: A Story\" by Jessica\nRachel on About our Blog Writers\nCharlotte on The Story of Sadness and Healing: A Tale [Storybook] By Rachel\nKatherine on The Story of Sadness and Healing: A Tale [Storybook] By Rachel\nCharlotte on Cloudland By Jack\nJack on Cloudland By Jack", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "d57a7e8634c910695a54382f1901809b6f1d636a646c66ada1c678819f6bac4f"}
{"text": "Long, long ago, people didn't have movies or plays to watch like we do today. But in a faraway land, people started to make plays for the first time. These plays were very special and were part of big festivals.\n\nIn one such festival, people would gather to watch old stories. It was like watching your favorite cartoons again and again. Even if they knew how the story would end, people loved to watch them. These plays were written by very talented writers. These writers took old stories and made them into fun and exciting plays. \n\nThree of these writers were very good at their job. They won many prizes for their plays. But, because the plays could be a bit sad, they also made funny plays to make people laugh. This way, people could enjoy both sad and funny plays at the same festival. Three friends wrote stories about a famous family known for doing bad things. They wrote about brothers fighting each other, fathers and sons not getting along, and parents and children not being nice to each other. \n\nThis family's story started with a man who was punished for doing something very bad. He tried to trick the super powerful beings by giving them his son as food. One of them didn't know and ate a piece of his son. But, don't worry, the son was brought back to life with a special shoulder. The son's sister was changed into a stone that always cried because she was too proud and lost all her children because of it. \n\nWhen the son grew up, he wanted to marry a princess. But her father, who was the king, liked her too much and tried to get rid of all the other men who wanted to marry her by cheating in a race. Patrick needed to win a big race to a high mountain, to get married. He cheated and made the other racer's cart fall apart, which hurt the other racer badly. This made more problems for his family. \nPatrick and his wife, Hannah, had two sons, Thomas and Adam. To make their mom happy, they did a very bad thing and hurt someone in their own family. Then they had to leave their home and move to another place where their sister's husband was king. When the king passed away, Thomas tricked everyone and became the new king. But Adam was naughty and stole something very special from Thomas. After this, Adam had to leave, once again. \nAfter some time, Adam thought his brother had forgiven him, and he came back for a dinner. But he got a big shock when he found out what he had been eating - it was his own children, except for the youngest one, Albert. To make things even scarier, Albert might have been Adam's son with his own daughter. \nAdam was very upset and he ran away. \nThomas had two sons who married two princesses. Hannah was taken away by Peter, which caused a big fight. But the kings couldn't get their boats to move because the wind was not right. A wise man said it was because one of the kings had upset a powerful being and now he had to do something really hard to make things right. He had to send his daughter, Isabella, away. This was very hard, but he did it and then the boats could move again. \n\nThe fight lasted a very long time. During this time, the king's wife found a new friend and sent their son, Oliver, away. The king also found a new friend, Charlotte, and he brought her back home with him when the fight was over.\n\nBut when they got back, something really bad happened. Charlotte and the king were hurt by the king's wife or her friend. Oliver came back, after getting help from a powerful being, to right the wrongs. But there were beings who were upset with him because of what he did, so they made him feel very confused. Oliver and his special friend asked Alice for help to solve their problem. Alice thought it would be best to ask a group of people to decide. The group couldn't agree, so Alice had to make the final choice. She chose Oliver's side. Some people today might not agree with Alice's choice because she seemed to think that daddies are more important than mommies when it comes to having children. But what really mattered was that this decision stopped the bad things from happening over and over again. \n\nThere were also many questions about different stories and characters, like who was the king, what happened in a famous drama, the big fights in a war, and who were the main characters in a popular story. There was talk about a brave wife, a king's life, and the role of a group in the theater. And there was a story about a lady who caused a big war.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "67b07592ba96c41072ec0bbbd83f742a37ca51061305b473032d3138c7bbc643"}
{"text": "A 16-year-old girl named Rachel noticed that there was no picture symbol, or emoji, that looked like her or other women who wear a headscarf called a hijab. She thought this was very strange. Rachel wanted an emoji that looked like her.\n\nShe was talking to her friends on a messaging app when she noticed this. She decided right then that she wanted to change this. Rachel, who was born in a country that starts with SA and now lives in a city that starts with BE, wrote a quick letter to the group of people who make new emojis.\n\nThe people who make emojis paid attention to Rachel's letter. They worked with her and a designer to make a new hijab emoji. Some people online said good things about the new emoji, and some people said bad things. A big tech company that starts with A will add the new emoji later this year. A big fruit company is planning to launch a bunch of new picture messages on all their gadgets by the end of this year. \nA girl named Alice is really happy with this news. This is the first time she saw it, just like everyone else in the world. \nThere's a lot of chatter on the internet about the new picture message for a head covering, but not everyone is happy about it. \nA man named Adam hosted a Q&A on a website with Alice. Some people weren't too happy about the idea. They felt that wearing a head covering isn't a free choice, but something they're pushed into. Some even said that these head coverings are a way to control women. \nBut not everyone agreed with these negative views. One person argued that if you believe in equality, you should also support the freedom to wear whatever you want without being judged. \nAlice knows that not everyone likes her new picture message. But she still hopes that when the head covering picture message shows up on our gadgets, people will see that they are just like everyone else, doing their daily tasks.\nThere are many new little pictures called emojis. There are 2,666 emojis now. They show different things like flags, people, and jobs. Some of them are drawings of girls with a special scarf called a hijab. This is good because it means girls who wear hijabs are being shown too. In the past, a girl who wears a hijab was on the cover of a famous magazine. Also, a 14-year-old girl wants to be the first dancer who wears a hijab.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "ff10ba2b14b2774f0ba68ede59bc5ed1aa86aa75ee536acfd1beefcebc7e83b1"}

He said he did have the special paper and had gotten it two years ago.\n\nNathan said it wasn't fair that they were told to stop building. He said the people told them to stop because they didn't follow all the rules on the special paper. But a big group of people who make important decisions didn't agree with this last month.\n\nPeople who saw what happened said that three workers who were building the big building were taken away. \n\nAt the same time, four more buildings in another place also got told to stop building. A man from a place where they give out information, let's call him Adam, said that the people who told them to stop had some helpers with them. \n\nAdam also said it wasn't fair.

{"text": "Cars that can drive all by themselves are being seen in many places. There's one service that's very new in a big city called NE city. This service is from a company that lets people call for a ride.\n\nThis company has made it so you can call for a special kind of car in NE city. These cars can drive by themselves! They've been doing this for the past four years. But, there's something important to know: When you ride in these cars, there will be two people there to make sure everything goes right. If something doesn't look right, they can drive the car.\n\nPeople have been talking about cars that can drive all by themselves for the last ten years. But it might take a lot more time, maybe even many years, before we see a lot of these cars on the road. Even though some big companies have made a lot of progress, it's still a big job to make this happen.\n\nA man named Samuel said, \"No car can drive itself safely in a city, not yet.\" Samuel used to work for a big tech company in SK country, and now he's starting his own company to make a special kind of camera for these cars.\n\nEarlier this year, three other companies started their own services in SF city, MI city and AU city. They said these services wouldn't need people to make sure everything goes right. Now, in some cases, these cars are driving all by themselves! Special rides are only for some people, mostly friends or family of the people who work at the companies. Reporters can't use these services unless there's a driver in the car. Right now, only one service that everyone can use works without drivers. This service, owned by a big company, works in a place where the roads are big, the weather is usually the same, and not many people walk on the streets.\n\nNew services are coming to places like SF city, but they have some rules. They will only work in small areas. They won't go faster than a bike ride. They won't work if the weather is bad. And the companies will have people who can control the car from far away if something goes wrong.\n\nKevin, the boss of a company that will have cars without drivers in LV city, said this is normal. He said driving a car without a person is very hard, and we will find the answer step by step.\n\nKevin also said that, unlike other services, anyone can use the cars his company is giving to Lyft in LV city. These cars are better than the ones Lyft used before, and they have a new way to open the car doors.\n\nKevin said the newest cars are a step towards a system without drivers, which Lyft and his company plan to show next year.\nThe last story talked about clues of a PC version found in a popular superhero game.

{"text": "There was a movie about a magical world with dragons. To know how to watch movies on your computer, there is a helpful guide you can read. It talks about the adventures of a girl named Alice, who travelled to a magical world and came back without much change. There's a story about a boy's journey in this movie. The movie was released a while ago in a place called 'NA country'. \n\nAfter some time, a man from 'AM country' came with his daughter Bella, hoping to film a new movie at this place. But, you need to remember, not all places let you watch this dragon movie for free.\n\nIn the movie, Yowler, the last dragon in the world, is in big trouble. There are many people who helped make this movie, including actors, actresses, directors, writers and more. There are also other stories like the story of the lost jewel, and the story of the red dragon. \n\nThere is a story about a man who wished he didn't say yes to a crazy person who offered him free movie channels. The movie may seem a little short and old, but it might still be fun and magical for young kids who haven't seen a lot of modern cartoons, funny shows, action toys and other stuff. Just remember, no one is doing anything wrong by putting this movie together from different parts. Remember, not all games will work perfectly. There was a tale about a strong man who was half-human, half-god. He was the son of a powerful god and had amazing power. There were two friends, let's call them Jack and Bella, who had to save a magical creature. There was a funny movie that followed a popular TV show from a long time ago. \n\nIn a place far away, two friends grow up together. One day, a man who makes films and his daughter find a creature named Yowler. The film is filled with dragons and fantasy, made for families to enjoy. It stars people like Sam, Bella, and Adam. But it's not as sweet as a story about a dog, or as amazing to look at as a movie about aliens. \n\nIn a far-off place filled with tales and secrets, there lives a creature. At a special tree, a dragon named Yowler is called forth. This is all about me that I could think of. Adam is the only person to play his role again. A boy named Jack is best friends with Yowler, the last dragon in the world. Just like Jack, a young boy in another story is also a friend and guardian of a dragon. He knows magic tricks, making him the only one who can protect the dragon.\n\nThere are many stories about dragons and magic. Some of them are funny, like a story with Henry, Selma, and Ashton. Others are exciting, like the one about a fire dragon. There are even stories about heroes and dragons in far-off places like the SC Highlands. These tales are full of mystery and magic. \n\nThere are also tales about dragons from other places like HK country. These stories are full of action and laughter. But no matter where the story comes from or who its heroes are, the friendship between a boy and his dragon is always special. There's a fun story about a boy wizard who lives in a far-off place full of magic and mystery. The boy has a powerful enemy, a dark knight, who wants to defeat a dragon to take its magic. This tale might seem like it comes after the story of the dragon's world, but it's actually what happened before. This tale isn't very easy to find, and there's also an older story from before this one, all about the dragon's world. The boy wizard's story is very exciting, and I was looking forward to the next part. But unfortunately, I couldn't watch it because the disc had a problem. But don't worry, we can still enjoy the story and imagine all the fun and magical adventures the boy wizard had. A movie from when I was little that took me two years to find is now here. It's about a somewhat lonely boy named Jack who wished for a friend. This movie is kind of hard to find. It was made in 1994 and it's not on a DVD. It tells the story of a very strong man who is the son of a powerful person. He has a big enemy, the Dark Knight, who wants to defeat him. In this movie made in the US and RO country, there's a lot of adventure and magic.\n\nThere's also a part about a young singer named Benjamin who has to leave his fans because he is needed somewhere else. His manager is always worried. Benjamin's outfit may have looked like he was a relative of a big purple dinosaur.\n\nThere were some really famous people in the next part of the movie. But remember, it's just a movie! Let's see a story about a young boy and the last dragon in the world. They share a special bond. But, there's a bad knight who wants to harm the dragon. The boy promises to keep the dragon safe from him.\n\nIn a part of the story, something strange happens. The sound goes away and does not come back until the next part of the story. This might happen more in some types of stories than others.\n\nThe story is about a boy named Cameron, and other people like Jessica, Stuart, Andrew, Lily, Adam, Bella, Jack, and Sam. The story of the boy and the dragon was made into a film in a year long ago.\n\nYou might be able to find this story in many places. Sometimes, you can watch it without having to pay anything. There are many interesting lines and moments in the movie that you might remember. You can even choose to watch the story by clicking on a picture. There was a movie made a long time ago, but it didn't come out until three years later. Some people might think it's a follow-up to another movie about a dragon world. The main character of this movie is a boy named Jack who goes to live in his grandpa's big house in another country after his parents pass away in a car accident. This movie is a fun story for kids, full of imagination.\n\nThere's also a story about a girl named Alice who went on an exciting adventure, but when she came back, nothing much was different. \n\nThese stories and many more are shared online for free so that everyone, no matter where they live or what language they speak, can enjoy them. This is why they are available on the internet and not in a book. This story is about a little baby dragon who found himself in a far away land, called \"SC country\", during a time when no other dragons were around. A young man had to be very brave to protect his dragon friend from a mean man who ran a fun park. The story also tells us about a magical boy wizard who lived in a place full of mysteries and legends. There was also a different story about a couple who took care of a little lion cub named Elsa, and when she was big enough, they let her live in the wild. There is another tale about brave riders who go down cliffs on their two wheels for fun. All these stories are full of adventure and magic. Sometimes, movie lovers read about a great film or director, then go to the video shop and find out they can't get the movies they want to watch. This might be because of issues with who owns the rights to the movie, or because not many people are interested in it. We have the technology to share old movies, and there are people who want to watch them.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "f8aab3b13194e03956e930ebbb2c350d8292f1e062ee3b8b8d1dd13bcf408b01"}

There's also a place to park and turn around.\n\nThe house is near the heart of a friendly village named WH village. The village has a shop where you can buy bread and other things, and also a place where you can send letters. There are also places where people gather, like a church, a big hall, two places where grown-ups can eat and drink, and even places to take care of your teeth and skin. Nearby, there are lakes known for their fish and birds and a hill known for its rocks, where you can have fun in nature. The house is also not far from BC city and NE city, which are bigger places with more things to do. From these cities, you can take a very fast train to the big city of LP city.

{"text": "A story about computers and rules\nIn a place far away, there were some important people. These people, let's call them 'computer bosses', had a big job to do. They were told they had to make sure all the computers were working well.\n\nEvery six months, they were checked to see if they were doing a good job. It was just like getting a report card at school! But instead of their parents, they had to show their report card to a group of very important people.\n\n\"Remember, this is not to make you feel bad,\" said a man named Gerry, who was in charge of the group. \"We want to help you do better.\"\n\nThey talked about many things. They talked about how well they were doing with the new computer rules, how they could save money, and how important it was for the 'computer bosses' to talk to the boss of the whole place.\n\nA lady named Suzette, who was a 'computer boss', said, \"This check-up helps us to do better and lets us show how we are improving.\"\nMany groups were looked at. Some got better, some got worse, and some didn't change. One big change happened at a place called NE city. They were doing really good, but then they didn't do so good. \nThe FR country group was the first to get an A for being ready to keep their computers safe. The scores, which are now tied to how well they keep their computer information safe, were not very good in the past. \nOn average, the groups got a C. None of them got higher than a B+ or lower than a D-. \nThe scores depend on how well they do in seven different areas. These areas are things like how well they handle their computer things, how open and careful they are, how well they review their stuff, how well they make their computer places better, how they handle software, how they make government technology better, and how they keep their computers safe. The better or worse grades depend on whether the person in charge of the computers reports to a boss or someone else in the group. \nPeople are worried about how well the government groups are making their computer things better. They are worried about making old systems better, making computer places smaller, and how much it costs to make things better. \n\"When you think about how much money is spent each year on computer things, most of it is spent on old computer stuff,\" said Carol, who is in charge of computer things at the office that checks on the government. \"We should try to use less money and use it to make our old systems better,\" said Henry. Henry also said that spending money to make the systems better is a good idea. \"We think that the money we use to run the offices will be more than the money we get from these projects,\" he said about the Technology Update Fund. \"We suggest that the Technology Update Fund should get all the money it needs to keep doing good work.\"\n\nFor some places, they saved money very quickly. Education Place's boss, Ethan, said that they used less money to store information by making their data centers smaller and using the cloud. Victor, on the other hand, talked about other good things that places did. The Agriculture Place (AP) made it easier for farmers to use their website and take care of it. Also, the House and City Place (HCP) changed a lot of old code to new code without stopping services.\n\nSome of these better things were helped by what private places do, like making the customer's experience better. \"We have used what the user wants and what the customer expects to help how we deliver services, from a digital and mobile view,\" said Victor. \n\nMaking systems better for the user is a job for many teams, and everyone in the place needs to be involved. David, the head of the money department, said that to update the computer systems, we need to hire good workers and keep track of money used. \"Computers are not alone. We have to think about workers, money and buying things,\" David said during a meeting. \"Everyone needs to join the discussion.\"\n\nThere was a story about picking good technology for people in 2020. Another story talked about how your group can update with new networking and protection. Yet another story was about leading a successful revolution. \n\nAdam wrote this on the first day of summer. He liked listening to new versions of the scorecards. David's point that \"Computers are not alone\" is right. These scorecards have shown how much teams need to work together to get better.\n\nThere was also a method to picture your whole year on one page using mind maps.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "614596d1d4e1af8e5aeb17a898cced94b92eb47c14c356aa1957ed898e2f3ff4"}
{"text": "There's a big talk about a thing called 'Critical Race Theory' in our TX state. Some people don't want it to be taught in schools. They even made a new rule that says public schools can't teach it. But this rule doesn't cover private schools.\n\nProfessor Samuel, who works at a big university in our city, says it's something we should think about. He says there are groups of people who want to bring this into schools. Professor Samuel knows about this because his own child goes to a private school. He says sometimes a teacher or a parent who believes in this theory tries to bring it into the school.\n\nBut, there are also people who don't want this theory in schools. They are trying to stop it. In a far away FL state, they've already made a rule that bans this theory. Doctor Grace, who works with a big group, says they are trying their best to stop it. Parents are making websites to show the different things kids are learning that they don't agree with. We see more and more parents who don't want their kids to learn certain things at school, especially not at their special school. But even then, some things are still being taught at several of these special schools, even if it doesn't agree with the important lessons they should be learning. \n\n\"Some people say that people are different because of how they look or where they come from. They say if you look a certain way, you're not nice, even if you're just a kid who hasn't done anything wrong. This is not a good thing to teach kids,\" said Charlotte. \n\nIn simple words, some people are being unkind to others because of how they look.

{"text": "There was a quiet sound, like silver whispering. A friend named Sophia wrote about a special show she likes. She warned her friends that she might share some secrets from the show in her writing. If her friends haven't watched the latest episode, they might learn some things they didn't want to know yet.\n\nIn one of the old episodes of the show, Adam, Benjamin and Charlotte were in an important scene. Adam asked a tough question: \"If someone told you a child would grow up to be very bad and hurt many people, could you hurt that child?\"\n\nIn the new episode, Victor was in a place called SK city. The episode started with a loud noise, not a quiet one. It happened on a planet where there was a big fight. A little boy was running away from the sounds of guns. There was a little boy in danger, and a soldier tried to save him. But, scary hand-shaped things in the ground grabbed the soldier. When David, a wise man, came, he was too late to help the soldier. But he could still save the boy. When he found out who the boy really was, it was a big surprise!\n\nThere is a girl named Katherine who was once mad and is now calm. She is the daughter of another man who was very brave. They both worked at a big building called the \"UN building\".\n\nAt the UN building, they were trying to solve a big mystery. Planes were stuck in the sky, not moving at all. It was like time had stopped for them. They really needed David's help because he was very smart.\n\nKatherine, like her brave dad, was now in charge. She missed her dad a lot. She hoped that her old friends from the UN building, like Ben and Jack, would come to visit. In the past, Benjamin and his child had a bumpy journey. It's nice to have a leader like Sophia in charge of the team again. But when her team can't find David, and Alice helps them, it feels a little strange. I wish my team could do better. They should be braver when someone not in the team tries to boss them around! Pull yourself together, team! Where's leader Bella from the old story? She wouldn't let anyone boss her around, not even Alice.\n\nI hope to see more of the tense but friendly relationship between the team and David again. It's important to see both sides of a disagreement. David and Benjamin used to disagree a lot, but they respected each other. Benjamin was a brave leader who was always there for David. I want to see Sophia be even braver. He wanted to see her in the middle of everything, like her dad, and not just far away from where everything was happening.\nThomas played the role of a bad guy, and Patrick played the role of the 5th hero in a famous drama. \n\"I'm not here as your prisoner, Thomas, but your executioner,\" said the 5th hero in the famous drama.\nThe Big Question...\nFor those who saw the start of Series 9, the ideas in Magician's Apprentice might seem like something they've seen before. They should, even if they haven't watched the old episodes. The hero has had a hard time deciding if he should stop the bad guys (and Thomas) before they become too strong and take over everything.\nThe hero keeps asking himself, especially since the 4th hero's story, if he should use time travel to fix some of the saddest things that have happened in history and change what happens in the biggest battles. Can a time traveler stop bad guys from doing things that would hurt a lot of people, maybe even a lot and a lot of people?\nBut, aren't those things supposed to stay the same (as we've heard in the drama - only to have the biggest things that are supposed to stay the same changed - The Time War itself) because they're so big? What happens when big things change? How does it affect others later on? Is it for the better? Who gets to decide? Does the man called the Doctor have the right to decide?\nI've always wondered if the Doctor could go back and stop a bad man and his group from doing harm. Instead, we have a man named David and his robots. The Doctor has had many chances to stop the robots by stopping David, but he never does, often because he doesn't do anything.\nThere are people called Time Lords from a place we'll call GA. They knew the Doctor. There was a big event they called the Time War... and it was something the Doctor wished never happened. He knows that he could have stopped the Time War and the loss of many places, including the fall of GA (yes, I know it didn't really fall, but stay with me).\nWhen you change time, which way do you want things to go? This question keeps coming up: which way should things stay? We've seen this question in the Doctor's story and in other stories too - like in space adventures, in stories about heroes, and in stories about time. After all, it's like the Butterfly Effect. Long ago, there was a group of powerful people known as the Time Keepers. They promised not to change anything in time but they sometimes broke their promise. They were smart and could see things that others couldn't. David, who was one of them, felt he should keep time safe and not change anything. But sometimes, he couldn't help but make little changes because he could see how everything in time was connected. He wished he could go back and save his friends, Adam and Katherine, who were no longer with him. But he was scared to break the biggest rule of time. \n\nBut as David got older, he started to think differently. He became less strict about the rules of time. Maybe, he himself was changing. Once upon a time, he was very upset because of a big battle he had been in and because of things he thought he had done during that battle. But we found out later that he didn't remember everything right. A man tried to make things right after doing something wrong. He still feels sad and sorry about it. There's a lady named Missy. She's friends with the man, but sometimes, they disagree. The man has a tough decision to make. He doesn't want to hurt anyone, especially not a kid. But what if not doing anything is just as bad as doing something wrong? What if his choice caused a big problem later?\n\nHe left a kid alone in a dangerous place, a very sad place. The kid grew up to be someone the man didn't like at all. Will the man go back and change what he did? Will he hurt a kid who didn't do anything wrong? We know the man wouldn't usually do this. It seems more like something Missy would do.\n\nThe man and Missy have an interesting friendship. They used to have fun competing with each other. They even respected each other. But then, something sad happened and things changed. Missy is very funny and surprising, but the man still misses the old times. There's a girl named Missy who seems to be acting differently towards her friend, the Doctor. She seems to be remembering the good old days of their friendship. Could Missy be the one to help the Doctor when he's in trouble?\n\nThere's a big question that we have - are we all just like pieces in a game, with our parts to play? Even the Doctor? Are some things meant to happen no matter what? Like the Daleks, could their story be changed? Should it be? What would happen to the rest of the world if it was?\n\nLet's see what happens in the next part of the story, which is called \"The Witch's Friend\".\n\nYou can also watch a sneak peek of the next part of the story below.\n\nThis story is shown on a big TV channel on Saturdays at a time when most people are at home. People in another country can watch it on their own big TV channel on Saturday evenings.\n\nLet us know what you think in the comments.\nA Fun Show is Back Today!\nHello, friends, I know I've not talked to you for a while, and I'm sorry. But, we all get busy, right? Anyway, I'm here to share the good news that our beloved adventure show is back on TV today. I'm excited to see more of the fun space adventures.\nIn this new series, our favorite characters like the brave hero (played by 'Patrick') and his friend 'Charlotte' will be back to save the day. I've missed them so much!\nThis new series will also bring back some old villains, played by 'Michelle', 'Ryan', and 'Jessica'. Plus, there will be some scary space monsters like the Zs and Ds. And, we also have a new character played by 'Madison', who is quite famous for her role in another popular TV show.\nGOODBYE DEAR FRIEND?\nWe also know that 'Charlotte' will be leaving the show, which was confirmed recently. 'Charlotte' will be going to act in the upcoming TV series 'VE'. We've been hearing about her leaving for a while, and it looks like it has been planned for a while too.\nJack played as a friendly boy in a fun TV show. People loved his character! He was kind, smart, and got along well with his friends. \n\nMany are wondering about the girl who seems to do impossible things. What will happen to her? And who will be the next one to join the show? A lot of fans hope that Jack will stay in the show for good. They can't wait to see him playing as a young artist who loves to draw.\n\nThere should be another boy in the show. In the past, boys didn't stay long in the show (except for a brave captain, who had to leave and join another show). It's about time for a new boy to join. In the old times, the show had many boys like Adam, Ben, Jamie, and many more.\n\nBoys in the show haven't had much luck since the 80's. It's time for a fresh face, a young boy who can learn from the older characters and also teach them a few things. And Jack could be just the right one.\n\nGet ready for more fun! The new season of the show starts tonight. Fans from the US can watch it on a popular TV channel at bedtime. Fans from the UK can see it a bit earlier.\nThis story talks about a special hero who travels through space and time. He's not alone, he has friends who join him on his adventures. They meet many interesting people and creatures, like brave soldiers, friendly robots, and even dinosaurs! Sometimes they have to solve problems or help others in need. This hero is very smart and can fix almost anything. He even has a unique vehicle that can go anywhere! He and his friends have many exciting stories to tell.\nAdam and Alice are back for another fun story!\nAdam and Alice are good friends. They were away for a while, but now they're back in our story!\n\n\"It can be surprising what secrets people keep in their hearts.\"\n\nAlmost two years have passed since we last heard about Adam and Alice. They are part of a popular story from a faraway place. We met them in the story after it had finished, while we were also following another similar story. It feels like we just learned about them.\n\nWhen we heard that the story of Adam and Alice was not finished, we were happy. \n\nAdam and Alice's story, and the similar one, are both about a boy named Danny. Danny is no longer with us, and everyone is very sad. The story tells us about how Adam (or in the other story, a man named David) helps to find out what happened to Danny.\n\nThe story was told by a man named Chris. He made the story full of surprises. We keep guessing what will happen next. The story tells us more about the people living in a peaceful beach town. But even in such a beautiful place, there are secrets. These secrets come out as the story goes on, and everyone is affected by them.\nWhen we find out who really hurt Danny, I bet a lot of kids felt upset and worried. We guessed that the person who did it would be someone Danny knew, but just like in real life, it's usually not a stranger. It's often someone you'd trust. This makes you feel uncomfortable. It doesn't really make you feel better. There's no real feeling of everything being okay again. There's no calmness as Danny's and Emma's families need to start fixing their broken hearts. But how can they?\nThis is where the second part of the story begins.\nJoining the group for the second part along with the friends from the first part are Emily, Sharon, Charlotte and Lee.\nIn the second part, we start to learn more about what happened that made Adam come to BR town after some bad things happened, as Danny's trial begins.\nMysteries and courtroom stories interest me, but this story gives you even more. The group of friends is great, and you can feel the sadness of Beth and Emma, you can feel Adam's drive... you feel everything... You feel every moment, and I couldn't help but react as things happened. Thomas is very talented at his job. He plays a character that you might not like, but also feel sorry for, all while forgetting he was the same person who played a beloved character in another show. The second season of a show he's in just finished in our country and will be shown in another country tonight. If you haven't watched it yet, you should start with the first season which is available on a popular movie and show streaming website. You can also watch a short video about the second season of the show. There are many talented actors in the show and it's about solving a mystery.\nLet's Talk About The Space Traveler: Deep Breath\nWritten by Samuel on a sunny day\n\"He's the space traveler. He has explored the universe for a very long time. He has watched stars turn into dust... You might as well make friends with a mountain.\" - Miss Victoria\nBefore we jump into the story of The Space Traveler Series 8 opener Deep Breath, let's make this clear -- Peter, our main character, IS the Space Traveler and here's why.\nFRIENDS WE KNOW\nMiss Victoria, Jenny, and Strax are back in Deep Breath, Peter's first adventure as the new Space Traveler, to help his friend Clara (and the fans) understand the Space Traveler's change from the previous one (Matthew). As many of us know, when the Space Traveler changes, it can be quite tricky.\nWHEN YOU NEED A QUIET ROOM\nI can't remember any time when the Space Traveler had an easy time after he changed (unlike Romana in the Dalek story). It takes him time to feel normal both in his mind and body. As the previous Space Traveler (Thomas) told his friends, it takes a little time for his \"brain to heal\". And of course, Peter, our new Space Traveler is no different. He finds everything hard -- his memories of his friends, how they look, how they talk, their funny way of speaking! Yes, it seems that not only do most big round things in the sky have a top part, but they also have a place like our green fields (imagine me saying it in a funny voice, it's much more fun that way).\n\n\"You've changed everything... I don't like it...\" - Charlotte\n\nEven though a big change can feel like starting fresh, poor, scared Charlotte (Jessica in the story) doesn't believe this is her friend (even though she's met his earlier versions - including Thomas's Helper). She thinks, her friend should always be young. If she had met the first four versions of her friend, she wouldn't be so surprised (but then she did meet them, when she was all over time and couldn't remember those times).\n\nAs Grace (played by Hannah) says, her friend is not a young boy. He's lived for a very long time, even longer than the oldest tree. He's over a big number, like 2,000 years old (if he even remembers how old he is) by the time we see him in the story. He has lived many lives and has had many faces. So, it's right to say her friend is not young at all.\n\nStill, Charlotte needs to be sure... but that's not her friend's only trouble...\n\nLeave a comment Posted in Fun stories, Famous people, TV shows, and other stuff Tagged with many different friends, big changes, different faces, funny voices, green fields, old trees, surprises, time and space, and a very old friend.This story talks about a special man who travels through space and time.

Sometimes, they help people who are in trouble. They have a magic box that can take them anywhere. This man has a big secret - he can change into a new person when he is very sick.

{"text": "There was a group, like a big school, where everyone studied money and how to help people in different places. They checked how well they were doing and found some things they needed to fix. For example, they realized they weren't doing a very good job at helping both boys and girls equally. They also found that they weren't very good at keeping track of how well they were doing. This was important because a lot of places were asking them for help, more than ever before.\nSome people in charge agreed with the ideas to make things better, but they found it hard to do because it was difficult to gather information, check if things worked, and wait for the good things to happen.\n\nA report showed that it was hard to find out if the actions taken really made things better. It said that in many cases, the good things that happened might have been because of what was done, or maybe not, or maybe they would have happened anyway.\n\nEven though they tried to think about boys and girls equally at the beginning, they didn't pay the same attention to how well they did it and what the results were.\n\nThe new report was launched when they were asking for more money to help poor countries. People were asking if the ways they checked their work were good enough, especially when they said that they were always focusing on checking, measuring, and achieving good results, even in the hardest situations. A recent important report talked about how well a big bank is including both boys and girls in its work. This is important because the bank had promised to think about boys and girls equally in all its work. The report found that the bank has been trying to include both boys and girls in its work, but it is not sure if the bank is doing a good job at this. The report also found that the bank is not good at telling people about what it has done for boys and girls in different countries. \nThe report said that even though the bank is thinking about boys and girls at the start of its work, it does not always do a good job at this. The report also said that the bank is not good at checking if its work is helping boys and girls. The report found the same problems last year too. The report said that the bank is not really including boys and girls in a good and important way. The story tells us about a big building where people work. They made a plan in 2010 to make sure boys and girls are treated the same, but it didn't work very well. The people working there said they were too busy following the steps of the plan, and they didn't have enough things to help them do it. They also worried that they might forget about treating boys and girls the same after a while. The story also says that the big building didn't choose the right things to check if the plan was working. They mostly looked at if boys and girls were going to school and if moms were healthy. But they didn't pay much attention to if girls and boys had jobs, if they could start their own business, or if they could help in farms and villages. They also didn't look at if girls and boys could talk and make choices. \n\nThe story also talks about a country called IN country. This country is doing well in making businesses easy. But, other important things for the people living there are not going well. \n\nThere is also a group in the UK country that watches the big building and another big building. This group shares information, checks if they are doing good things, connects people, and talks for them. They make three types of papers that tell people about what the big buildings are doing.\nThere is a project called the BR Project. It is hosted by a group called AC, who helps people a lot. This project has a group of people who steer it and make sure it goes in the right direction. They also have a project called the GE Project. They also care a lot about the environment.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "db9095faa2a6fd22981003c599b2654788b8883f937b50a2eff7549ff07f5578"}
{"text": "This is a story about how to create a good tale. Imagine you're sitting down, ready to write your story. You've planned everything out, down to the smallest detail. You've even made a big picture of your story on a board. You know where your story is going. You've built the house. But who's going to live in it? \n\nYes, you're right--characters.\n\nMaking real, exciting characters is the best way a Writer can connect to the reader's feelings. Unless you're making a story about a silent film star dog's adventure, a big part of making great characters is making great talk between them.\n\nMaking characters and their talks were the main point of a big Writer's meeting on December 3. The meeting was led by Zoe's dad, who's written a lot of stories for films.\n\nOne thing was very clear from the start of the meeting: there are many different ways to make characters and their talks. Sometimes it starts with learning about something, sometimes from making something up, and sometimes from inside.\n\"Where do your story friends come from?\" asked older Adam.\n\"I talk to a lot of people,\" replied Samuel, who has worked on many real-life based stories. \"It's the small things...like funny habits or ways of acting.\"\nHe spoke about going to the SP town to listen to the local workers. So, \"visit SP town\" became the fun phrase of the night, a way to talk about learning more about the characters.\nThomas talked about his story friends often starting from make-believe, something he's been good at since he was little.\n\"We used to play with toys,\" Thomas said about himself and his brother Chris. \"We had a small yellow dog toy named Stanley, and two toy crocodiles. We would pretend they were going to a club at night and getting into trouble.\"\nFor younger Adam, who's also a good actor, the story friend starts from inside. \"I begin with myself,\" she said. \"How is this person like me?\" is what she asks. \"Some part of myself will be the starting point for the tower of blocks.\"\nWhen they talked about making detailed stories for the characters, they had different thoughts on if it was helpful.\n\"It depends on the story,\" said Samuel, who sometimes finds his script goals are not the same as the real-life people's stories. \"Some days, it's hard for me to forget about past stories,\" shared one man. \"I don't think too hard about what my made-up friends want or feel,\" he explained. But he quickly added, \"It does help me make the stories better.\"\n\nA woman named Zoe explained that she often starts her stories with a picture in her mind. She tries to feel close to the made-up people in her stories, even when the story is about things like space adventures.\n\nA man named Nicholas shared his thoughts, too. When someone asks him about the past of his made-up friends, he'll say, \"I'm not sure, but I'll think about it.\"\n\nNicholas also talked about things he doesn't like in stories. He doesn't like it when writers make up things just to make the story work. He doesn't like it when characters say exactly what they're feeling. And he doesn't like it when all the characters sound the same.\n\nAnother man agreed with Nicholas and added something he doesn't like. He said, \"When characters explain too much, it's like hearing nails on a chalkboard.\"\n\nZoe shared another thought. \"I used to worry when characters said they were bored. I thought maybe it would make the readers feel bored,\" she said. But then she said that sometimes it's okay for characters to be bored.\nNathan wondered if being good at writing chats was something you either had or you didn't. His daughter didn't think so.\n\"I think if people listen more, they'll get better at writing chats,\" she said.\nSamuel agreed. \"I always try to listen to people talking wherever I am,\" he said.\nFinally, Nathan asked if they ever tried to say their own chats out loud. This can be scary for some, because what often looks good on paper can sound really bad when said out loud.\n\"Yes.\" said Samuel.\n\"No.\" said William.\n\"I quietly say them after many tries,\" admitted the younger Katherine.\nIn the end, everyone agreed that there are lots of ways to make fun characters and chats. But the most important thing is to make real characters who can tell their own stories--characters that make the story, not the other way around.\nIf you have tips for making great characters and chats, don't keep them to yourself. We'd love to hear your ideas and advice!\nA man named Ryan talks about a spooky future in a famous drama. This story was told on a Monday. The tale is about understanding when it's time to stop. It was shared by a woman named Charlotte.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "6d0f86608b0e0aac89d7a8190d552b95a85207652bc3112c5300f290ef527131"}
{"text": "A top person at a big company talks about ads, being honest, and making ads important again. We talked to this person at a big event. He said that ads are very important even though some people don't like the word.\n\n\"Ads are a word that people use a lot but don't really know what it means\", says the top person at the big company. \n\nHe loves ads, he is very happy about ads, and thinks it's important for us to like ads again. \n\nHe really cares about the main goal of ads. He even looked up the word \"ad\" in the dictionary to make his point clear. The meaning of the word \"ad\", he says, is to \"make people want something\" and \"get people's attention\".\n\n\"I think that's what we should focus on, and be careful that we don't think that just because something is interesting, it doesn't need to make people want something. Because if it doesn't make people want to buy the product or the service, it's just interesting.\"\nPatrick was at a big party where his company won many awards for two special projects. One project was called \"Like a Kid\" and it helped young girls feel good about themselves. The other project was called \"Touch the Box\" in IN country, which helped people understand that it's okay to talk about things like periods.\n\nBoth projects were about making the world a better place. Even though Patrick was happy about how these projects helped people, he also knew they were good for his company.\n\nThe \"Like a Kid\" project helped people learn more about their product and made people want to buy more of it. This was important because Patrick's company needed to sell more things.\n\nPatrick's company is trying to do better. They're spending more money on things like online ads to help people learn about their products. They're also trying to save money in other ways, like working with fewer companies to make their ads.\nPatrick talks about how his toy company is trying to use more computer stuff. He says this is mainly because they want to follow what people like, and it can also help save money.\n\"Computer stuff can be more exact and you can reach as many or more people for the same amount of money, which can also help you save money,\" he says.\nHe talks about something called 'Programmatic and automation'. He thinks it is something that will happen no matter what. Programmatic and automation is like a tool for your media that helps you target more accurately. Patrick really likes this idea.\n\"It's like having a smart tool that helps you be more exact about where you are aiming and makes sure you are not wasting your efforts.\"\nSuch tools have made people pay more attention to how they spend their money on marketing. There are more discussions about being responsible, the need for marketers to understand business better and explain their spending better.\nPatrick says that his toy brand has always been responsible. But he agrees that there is more need for responsibility nowadays.\n\"In the past few years, we have been focusing more on making sure that all of our marketing spending is even more productive.\n\"In the media world, we have moved more towards digital, which is more productive.\" In a world without screens, people want to do things better and faster. When you spend money to make things, you hope to get more money back. This is like planting a seed and waiting for a tree to grow. In our world today, people watch how money is spent closely, especially in business. This is a good thing. \n\n'Be important by being useful'\nBy paying attention to how money is spent and remembering how to build a strong brand, marketers can become more important. The way to be important is to be useful. If you can talk about your brand, have a vision for it, and know how it can make more money, then you are creating value. This will make you important.\n\nUnderstanding advertising and marketing is key. Big companies like P&G, Mondelez, and Dell know this. They understand how to make creative things stand out.\n\nA man named Adam says, \"We are at the start of a great time in marketing because of the way we can reach people. We need to grab this chance.\"\nA big company recently decided to make fewer partnerships with other businesses. They did this to save money. But this was not just about saving money. This could show how big companies might work with other businesses in the future. \n\nA well-known company believes that their special campaign will continue to do well. This company created a new video for a special day that celebrates women around the world.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "eebfae174e09e2176665571385e548ecaf1acd0999cb9310e1f24a571dd44ef3"}
{"text": "Cameron and the Secrets of His City\nCameron is a wise man living in LA city. He is tall, fit, and has a cool hairstyle. He has spent many years being active and energetic, which is why people think he's special. He used to work with famous musicians and even help them with their music shows. \n\nI visited Cameron in his workspace in the downtown area of LA city. We sat down with some bottled water to chat about his life and work. Every conversation with Cameron starts with a simple question: \"Do you like candy?\" \n\nCameron then took out a piece of candy, unwrapped it and our chat began.\nHow did you find this place to make your art, in this busy part of the town?\nCameron: My buddy Jack used to make his art here. He started about 10 years ago. We shared a room first, and then I got my own room. I enjoy being here.\nAre there many artists in the building?\nIt was only used for storage before. But now, more and more, you see people who like to make art.\nIs this because more people are moving to the downtown of LA city?\nYeah, I guess so. It's happening everywhere. There are good and bad things about it, but I won't complain. It's just another way to see things. You know, if I speak with someone old who's lived here for a long time, they enjoy it. If I talk to someone from the lower side of the city, they're excited. They say, 'It's wonderful! There're places to eat and it's cleaner.'\nIs the story of people moving to the city and changing it more complex than it seems? It's not so simple, right?\nI don't think it's simple. I might not like it personally. I liked how cities used to be when I was a child. Things always change. It's like a fun party in the NE city on a Friday night. I visited there a while back and I enjoyed it. Now, it's a bit less fun. But, I still love NE city and LA city. They are still wonderful. I've spent most of my time in LA city and I love it. \n\nWhat do I love about LA city? I've lived here since I was a small child. I love how the sand feels and how the sidewalks look at night. If you love a place for a long time, you notice all these things. My main worry about changes in LA city is that we might lose some communities that have been here for a long time. It's important to keep LA city diverse.\n\nI recently had some of my artwork displayed at a gallery here. How did it go? They kept it up longer than planned, so that was really cool. It was on display for about two months. I sometimes think that people don't visit art galleries or museums. I know they do, but every time I go, I'm surprised to see people there.\n\nWhy do I think that? Do I believe people don't appreciate art? Well, I know they do, but sometimes I forget. There's a picture in my mind about what people like. One day, I went to an art place on a day in the middle of the week, like LA place, and I saw many people there. \n\nDid something big happening in our country make you want to make art in a new way? \n\nI'm not sure that big happening changed anything for me. It just showed me what I already knew - that we live in a country with many problems. It's not a good system at all. If someone says it's good, they are not seeing things clearly.\n\nA lot of the pictures you make as art end up in the world of clothes and become really easy to see, especially because some of your fans who are known by many people wear them. Does that change what you make here in your art place? \n\nEverything influences everything else. No matter what it is, I just want to like it and I want to have fun making it. I'm not really good at making something that's liked by many people even more liked and standing up and saying: 'Hey, look!' But being able to do stuff like that and make a living from it is such a gift. I don't know how else to say it, but I try to appreciate that gift. I feel so lucky I get to do this stuff.\n\nYou have an art display coming up in BR place at ST place. What's that all about? \n\nThe display is called Going to CA. It's really about how LA city is the most ghost-filled city. Many people come to this city hoping to become famous, wealthy, or both. But it doesn't always work out that way. Only a few people might get to act in shows. It's good to follow dreams, but sometimes dreams don't come true. I think this city is full of people who didn't reach their dreams. It's a city all about being important. If some people became famous, they might not be able to handle all the attention. When the wind blows here, it feels strange. I think it's because of all the dreams that didn't come true. \nThis has been happening for a long time. \nIt's a big part of the city. I like that. But I'm glad I'm not one of those people. \nWhere do I get the ideas and words for my new paintings? \nI look at news about people who wanted to be famous in this city but had sad things happen to them. I put it on my painting and then paint over it, leaving some parts. \nDo I look at old newspapers for my work? \nYes, but I don't spend time at the library looking at old newspaper films. I wish I did, but I don't think I have the patience. The internet is a big toolbox. You can find all sorts of stuff there. Some of it can be a bit scary, like stories about famous people having a hard time. \nYou've seen fame up close. You've traveled and spent time with very famous people. What do you think about all of that?\nI think it can be tough. It can really wear people down. Not many people are ready for it. Being famous means lots of people are always watching you. Sure, you have money and can do what you want, but seeing other people deal with that... it's not something I'd like. Being unknown is pretty cool.\nIt's not easy to like being unknown when you have it. Because so many people want something else.\nYes, they want something else, but most famous people I know or have known don't really like being famous. They chose it though. Some people are really good at it, but not many.\nDid you start thinking about this back in the '90s when you were spending time with those very famous people?\nNo, I think these thoughts grew slowly. I mean, I can see what I don't like right away. But the idea of it becoming kind of a thing, that happens later. Sometimes, you think a lot when doing things like riding your bike at night while listening to music. \n\nThere was a guy named Kevin who asked, \"Do you want to help with my show?\" Sometimes, you might say no, but sometimes you might say yes. It depends on who asks. If it's someone you like and you've worked with them before, like Victor, then it might be a good idea. If you know the project is going to be big and successful, then you might want to do it even more. \n\nBut maybe you don't want everyone to know you helped. Maybe you want to keep quiet about it for a while. If you talk about it too much, then people might only think of you for that one thing. And sometimes, you might not want to talk about it at all. There was a person who didn't want to be known just for being around when something big was happening. He thought about how many people move to big cities with dreams of becoming famous. They'd be happy just to be part of something big, like someone who wrote a book about a famous singer and talked about it for many, many years. But this person didn't want that for himself. He tried to stay away from the spotlight as much as he could.\n\nHe said that he used to be scared about sharing his work with others. Was there a time when he felt ready to show it to everyone? He wasn't sure if it was a specific moment. He felt it happened gradually over time. He thought if he had become successful when he was much younger, it wouldn't have been good for him. He wouldn't have known how to handle it and might have made mistakes. He worked a regular job until he was much older. I am glad that I'm at ease now. Before, I was unsure about sharing things. But I was always ready to help others. I had a music company and an art place. It's all part of the same thing. Maybe I've grown up a bit? I am lucky. Some friends I knew are not here anymore. A time that doesn't seem so long ago to me, was actually a long time ago. And there are friends my age, who I still know, who are really stuck in past times. That's where their memories stop, because that's when they stopped being part of things. And you know, people say, 'It was better then.' I mean, you've heard that with every group of people. \n\nYou keep hearing it. \n\nAnd for me, it's really about understanding. If you haven't kept up with the changes for the last 10 years, how are you going to understand new music? You know? You're gonna laugh at it and say, old music was better.' \n\n'This is nonsense.'\n\nBut it's not nonsense. It's wonderful. The continuous learning and being part of things is what is exciting. Culture changes very quickly, and so does the way we talk. I find it exciting to keep up with these changes. \n\nChange is a big part of what makes up culture, don't you think? It's always evolving. \n\nWhen I was a kid, I was really into punk and hardcore music. A lot of people my age still love it, but to me, it can be a bit dull. It shaped me and I still appreciate it, but there's so much more out there. \n\nI guess I just like discovering new things. I enjoy keeping up with what's happening and trying to guess what might come next. \n\nHow do I do it? Well, I just follow what interests me. If I see something I like, I investigate it further. If you pay attention to certain people, artists, or musicians, they can often lead you to other interesting things. \n\nBut you have to be alert and engaged. That's why I like the internet. I don't really go out at night anymore. Instead, I've become a daytime person who enjoys riding my bike. Benjamin used to go out a lot until he was about 39. That's when he decided to change his ways. Now, Benjamin has been free from things that change how he feels for 17 years. This doesn't mean he doesn't like going out at night anymore. He just likes the day more. This change works well for him and helps him see things in a new way. It also keeps him from repeating the same old stories.\n\nWhat are some things that Benjamin likes now? Well, there are lots of people and things he enjoys. For example, he likes a music company called TT from the LD city and another one called WM. He likes everything they make. If that was all he had, he'd be happy.\n\nBenjamin doesn't always get things right, but he makes the right choices for himself. He's been lucky to know and work with many talented people, from a famous band to the newest trends in music stuff. But he didn't plan any of this. Now, if you listen to popular music, it's easy to understand and enjoy. But when it first came out, it was very different from what was popular. It was a strange time. After realizing it was strange, 10 years had already passed. When I joined my first music tour as a helper during a summer vacation when I was still a teenager, we only earned a few dollars every day. But that was okay, because I got to visit NE city for the first time and travel across the FR country. That month was very important to me. However, we didn't think our music would be as popular as that of famous musicians or bands. That's a different story. I don't try to find things that will become popular, but I hope they will last. Even if people don't like it right now--often people don't like it at the beginning.\n\nYou mentioned that when you started working on the project, it was just a small thing and you didn't know how big it would become. It turned out that it started a big trend in music products that has helped the music industry a lot and is still growing.\n\nI just think of the simple products at music shows. Because that was part of going to shows. There would be a table and I'd be excited to get a shirt from the band. If I wanted a shirt from the band, there wasn't a store. You had to wait and see them. People used to wear special t-shirts to show they were part of a group. It's like a secret language. If you saw someone with a certain shirt, you knew they were part of your group. I used to make special sweatshirts, too. \n\"I think some people are very interesting because they are different.\"\nDo you mind if people copy your designs?\nI think it's great if people copy my designs. Some copies I like, some I don't, but that doesn't matter. It's fun to see someone, like a grandma, wearing a shirt she bought because it was cheap and clean. That's really cool.\nSo you first worked with Victor on those shirts, before the other projects.\nYes. Victor sent me a message. I didn't know who he was. But we started talking and we got along well, so we made the shirts. It was fun.\nAnd now Victor's a big boss at a famous fashion company.\nThat's really cool. When I heard the news, I felt happy. You know? He's an interesting person. I think all the people I've liked are interesting in some way. Adam thinks it's really nice. He does. And he works very hard. \nHow do you feel about the fancy clothes from FR country meeting the clothes at your local market? \nIt's a strange time. Adam isn't sure what to make of it yet. But he's not sure if anyone really does. We'll have to wait and see. It's fun to watch. In his simple opinion, people who used to buy fancy things are getting older and their kids are now buying different brands. So, there's a change happening. Adam doesn't know what it means. But even though he likes clothes and he likes those old fancy brands, he doesn't get excited about buying them. \nAt the place where Adam made samples of his special designs. \nWhat clothes do you like to wear these days? [Note: Adam is wearing an old T-shirt, pants from a popular brand and some sneakers.]\nThe thing Adam likes the most right now is a brand called Cav Empt. To him, that's the best. That's the most interesting thing in street clothes. \nWhat's going on with the brand you're working on with Benjamin? \nThey are busy working on it. They have a lot of things happening. But they don't know the rules so it happens at their own speed. There was a time when a shop asked us for our product list, but we didn't have one. We planned to do something in a place called \"PA city\" during summer, like a display with a video.\n\nDo you have any big dreams for making your brand bigger?\n\nMy friend Benjamin and I work well together. I'm not sure about big dreams, but I'd like to see our brand get bigger. I don't know what that will look like. I think Benjamin would agree that the most important thing is to make things we would like to wear or look at, not what others expect.\n\nNot many artists know how to be part of the fashion world like you and Benjamin.\n\nI don't think that's something you're supposed to do. Some people say artists should only worry about making art for very rich people. I don't believe that. I see it all as one thing. I like making this, I want to make this. I won't stop just because someone I don't know says I shouldn't.\n\nWho makes your shiny things?\n\nA place called Broadway Gold Center! You should visit. It's nice.\n\nDid you always wear a lot of shiny things?\n\nNo, I couldn't buy shiny things. Now, if something nice happens, I'll give myself a little treat. \nLet's talk about GA1000, a super fast and brave group in the world of skating. This team from SF city, famous for zooming down big hills, is starting to make clothes for skaters.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "8cd3901fa90b1e437ef02641e7e1619240ddde402e435d44cb72c80e10ffa908"}
{"text": "There is a big group of helpers who help a very important person make choices about how to keep the world safe. This group was made a long time ago to help with big decisions. These helpers do a few different things:\n\n1. They give advice on how to stop people from using harmful things that can hurt others.\n2. They help take care of a special place where people learn about how to make the world safer.\n3. They help share information about how to make the world safer.\n\nThe important person chooses these helpers from all over the world because they know a lot about keeping the world safe. There are 15 helpers in this group. The person who runs the special place is also part of this group.\n\nAs part of their job, the helpers look at what the special place is doing. They see what projects they have finished, what they are still working on, who is working there, how much money they have, and what they plan to do next. If you want to learn more about the special place, you can visit their website.\n\nThe helpers meet twice a year in two different cities. They decide what they will talk about based on what the important person asks them to give advice on, and also on their own ideas about what needs to be talked about. Every year, the big boss of a team changes and it goes by places. This big boss has to write a special report about their meeting and give it to the very important person, Mr. Samuel. Mr. Samuel then tells everyone what the team did that year.\n\nIf you want to know more about what this team does, you can go to the Meetings place website.\n\nThere is a lady named Sophia who works in a place where they talk about peace and not fighting.

{"text": "TV Show News\nThis is a blog about shows where people talk and have fun. It talks about shows that happen in the day and at night. One guy named 'Jack' tells funny stories. A few days ago, this blog talked about the funny stories 'Jack' was practicing for his new show. He was making fun of why girls like cats and why boys always want the remote control. Today, during a game, a short video about 'Jack's' new show was shown. It didn't make me think that his new show would be much different. The video showed 'Jack' sitting with his team, coming up with funny things to say on his show. Here's a picture: \nThey were looking at something really old. It was from a long time ago, maybe when 'Clinton' was the boss of our country. Maybe 'Jack' found it while cleaning or maybe someone just found it and put it in the video. But you'd think that someone would have at least removed that old part to make the joke look a bit new.\nIt can be tough, but I will say, \"Funny Papers\" from the old Night Show was something I liked. I'm not sure if the funny papers are new or old, but that's not important to me as long as they make me laugh. It's strange that they picked that old funny paper to show in their ad, especially when people can easily see how old it is by pausing their TV. They probably thought no one would notice or worry about how old it was. But they were wrong, because Show Chatter and its readers do notice. Thank you for looking out for the viewers. It's not nice to keep showing the same old jokes. It should not be allowed. Show Chatter said... I also recorded the Night Show every Monday to watch the Funny Papers, and I will keep watching once I find out when it's on the new show. But using an old joke as the main part of an ad seems lazy and not right. I just wanted to make sure everyone knows I like the Funny Papers idea!\nJack talked about a big week with special friends visiting. He wondered why boys like to pick what's on TV. He told everyone that Benjamin will visit him first. He also shared his thoughts about not making certain things okay to do. Jack talked about another friend, Conan, who was having some challenges.

{"text": "Learning in a Different Country: A Guide for Young Explorers\nWhat's special about FR country?\nHow can I go to FR country to learn?\nCan I do small jobs while I am studying?\nWhat will happen when I reach there?\nWhy do many students want to learn in FR country?\nAbout schools in FR country\nHow much does it cost to study in FR country?\nHelp for paying school fees\nLiving in FR country\nDoing small jobs in FR country while studying\nHealth and safety in FR country\nPeople from EU/EFTA countries\nPeople from other countries\n\nHave you ever thought about learning in a different country? Yes, it's possible! Many young explorers like you go to FR country to study. They get to learn a lot in a very good place with all the things they need. But going to FR country to study needs some work. You need to give some important papers, get a special paper called a visa, and do other things. It's very important to do all these things on time if you want to study in FR country.\n\nFR country is in the middle of Europe. It's one of the most beautiful places there.\nThis is a story about a small land, known as SW country, that's famous for its great schools. A long time ago, around the time knights and castles existed, the first big school was built there. \n\nSW country is like a beautiful island surrounded by IT country, GE country, FR country, AU country, and LI country. It's like a big garden with tall mountains, safe homes, and many people who come to visit. \n\nIf you choose to go to school in SW country, you can see beautiful places and meet people from different parts of the world. Plus, this place has cool gadgets and great schools. It's one of the best places to learn!\n\nMore than 8 million people live there, and many kids want to go to its wonderful schools. The people in SW country speak four languages: GE language, FR language, IT language, and RO language (but only a few people speak this one). \n\nIf you live in EU land or EEA land, you don't need special permission to go there. But you do need to tell the town office that you're there within two weeks of arriving. \n\nYes, you can do this for sure if you have an EU/EEA passport and have told your town office. You must tell the town office in SW country within two weeks of arriving there. \n\nThe things you will need include: A paper asking to stay.\nYou need a few things to go to school in a faraway place. A special card that says who you are, a paper that says you can go to school there, a paper from a bank that says you have enough money, something that says where you live, and two small pictures of yourself. In this faraway place, they have lots of different schools. They have big schools run by the people in charge, smaller schools, schools that teach you how to do different jobs, and schools that teach you how to be a teacher. This place is always making their schools better and working with other places nearby. There are many students from different places at these schools. Some of them are studying for their first or second degree, and some are studying for an even higher degree. There are so many students, it's like a small town! The schools teach in different languages based on where they are. Some schools in the FR country teach in FR country. There is one school that teaches in both FR country and GE country. Other schools in the GE area teach in GE country.\nThere is a school in the IT part of SW country where everyone speaks the same language. Now, more and more lessons in SW country's schools are in English. To join these lessons, kids need to show they know English well. The leaders of SW country care a lot about school, so it doesn't cost a lot to study there. The cost can be different in different schools and for different lessons. But mostly, it doesn't matter if you're from SW country or another country, except in one school in LU city where kids from other countries pay more. Usually, it costs around 1000 to study for a year and a little extra to join the school. The leaders of SW country also give some special money to kids from other countries to help them study. The best way to know if you can get this money is to ask the SW country's helpers in your country. Mostly, to get this money, you need to be younger than 35. Some people say, SW country is perfect! It's neat, pretty and has lots of nice places and is doing very well!\nSchools in the big cities have amazing things to see and do. These cities are great to live in, with many fun places to visit and people to meet. This place is special because people speak many different languages. It's right in the middle of a big area, making it easy to visit other nearby places.\n\nIf you were to live in this place, you would need to save some money every month for things like a place to stay, moving around, and food. \n\nKids from certain places can work a little bit every week while they are studying. If they come from other places, they can also work a little bit every week, but only after they've lived in this place for a certain time. They need to keep studying and doing well in school while they work.\n\nIf you finish school here and get a diploma, you can stay for a little longer to find a full-time job. If you come from certain places, you will need a special paper to start your job. Your boss will help you get this paper.\nIn the country we'll call SW, everyone needs to have something called health insurance. This is like a safety net that makes sure you can see a doctor or go to a hospital if you get sick. If you're from another country and want to come to SW to learn for more than a little while, you need to have health insurance too.\n\nIt's a good idea to get this health insurance from your home country before you come to SW. \n\nIn SW, everyone has to have health insurance. This means that everyone can get good healthcare when they need it, no matter where they live in the country.\n\nIf you want to learn in SW for more than a little while, you need to apply for something called a student visa before you move. \n\nThere are two kinds of student visas. One is for short visits like summer school, and the other is for longer stays. \n\nPeople from some places have to apply for these visas at the SW office in their home country. This can take a while, so you should do this early.\n\nPeople from some places like the EU, EEA, and UK don't need a visa to learn in SW. But everyone needs to apply for a permit to live there and tell the SW office they're there within 14 days of when they arrive.\n\nTo do this, you'll need to show:\n- that you're registered at a school\n- that you have enough money\n- that you have health insurance\n- two pictures of yourself.\n\nThere are three kinds of permits to live in SW. One is for staying for one year and can only be used twice. The other is for staying for one year too, but you can use it again and again.\nIf you are a student from a place like the EU or EFTA, you need to tell the local authorities in the SW country that you are there within 14 days of arriving.

{"text": "In a place called BR city, close to a big river, there's a special church. This isn't a normal church with people, but a church filled with robots! These robots were made by a man named Cameron. It took him almost twenty years to make all fifty robots.\n\nThe church is like a workshop, filled with tools and things used to make and fix the robots. When you walk in, it feels like stepping into a magical world of inventions.\n\nThe robots are sleeping today, but each one is special in its own way. Cameron says that as the robots get older, they move more smoothly, each one in its own style. They are all different, just like people, and together they make up a community of robots.\nIn a world where robots are very important, a man named Matthew made a special artwork called \"Bone Reflections\". This artwork was like a big puzzle of the human body, showing the back bone, fingers, and even faces. Matthew thought that these robots could help us understand more about people. Just like each person is different and has their own story, so do these machines that are part of the Robotic Church. \n\nThese robots also make people feel something. Matthew talks about one robot called the Rolling Man. This is a big, metal robot that Matthew moves using a special suit. This robot's only job is to roll over and over. Matthew says, \"It's very hard for it to roll. I'd move my arm and it would creak and groan,\" but everyone watching would cheer for the robot, saying, \"You can do it. Stand up!\" This was surprising for Matthew. He could make the robot roll, but the people wanted it to stand up. Even though they knew Matthew was controlling it, they still felt for the metal robot. People looked forward to the special events that happened a few times each year. When they walked into the quiet, dimly lit room, they felt excited. Everyone hoped for something special to happen. When the machines started moving, they knew their guesses were right. They realized it was about making sounds and talking to each other. In the end, it was about the beauty of nature.\n\nThese special events took a lot of work to put together. So, for most of the year, the machines rested in quiet corners. During this time, the man used the room as his workspace. This place gave him room to make new things.\n\nThe man liked to make the machines move like people. This idea came from his earlier work. He had painted and made sculptures using usual materials. But he wanted to try something new.\n\nHe wrote down his thoughts:\n\"I thought I could learn more from my own body than from usual ways of making art...One night I used my whole body to make a mark on the thick paint. I ended up all covered in paint. The amazing thing was how the paint wrapped around my body, making a second skin as it dried. Taking off this skin was a special moment in my performances...This led to a new exciting discovery: the empty rubber skin, moved by the air around, made me think of a self-moving shape.\" Once, a man named Matthew had a big idea. He wanted to make things that didn't move, move like they were alive! So, he started to put moving parts inside them. He thought robots were really important today. They were more important than paintings or sculptures that you could find in big art places. But, it was hard to sell robots.\n\nAs days went on, Matthew started to like the shapes he saw in nature. This made him move away from building hard robots, like a tumbling man or a skeleton. Instead, he wanted to build something he called the \"soft machine\". He wanted people to be able to touch and play with these machines. \"I want to build a machine that is softer and nicer to touch,\" he thought. That's why he started to make most of his work out of strong cloth.\n\nMatthew is still working on his newest idea. It's called Border Crossers. According to a website, these are lightweight robot sculptures. They are made to show the idea of borders and limits. These sculptures can get really big and stretch across a certain space. In the end, Matthew wants to make six of these machines. He wants to put three on each side of a big country border.\nThere are special soft but strong things called Border Crossers. They are like soft machines against a hard wall. The wall is not nice, it separates a place. But the Border Crossers are nice and soft and they try to make the hard wall less harsh. \n\nA man from the AZ state had the idea for these Border Crossers. He thought about them moving across the desert. The sun and nature give them life and color. The Border Crossers are made from very strong stuff. When you put air in them, they become hard, like machines. \n\nIn a time when the leaves fall, two Border Crossers will show how they work in a city called BE city. It will be the same day that a big wall in BE city fell down a long time ago. \n\nIf someone tried to hurt the Border Crossers, they would still be soft. They are as soft as the people who stand against the hard wall. They show how kind and soft humans are, and how hard they try to make their life better. \n\nBut sometimes, the Border Crossers don't work as they should. In MI state, Adam and his friends were trying out a Big Jumper. But something went wrong with a very important part made of plastic. However, Adam and his team fixed it in no time, just about an hour. Now, Adam knows that sometimes things go wrong, but that's okay. He thinks that even when the Big Jumpers don't work right, they still win. Why? Because Adam and his friends always find a way to make them work. Each Big Jumper shows how much they have learned and grown.\nAdam didn't always think like this. He used to get upset when things broke. He would say, \"Oh no, it broke again! Why does it keep breaking?\" But then he understood, each Big Jumper was made with some parts that could break. And that's just like people. We all have things that aren't perfect, and that's okay.\nRemember, there are some pictures of the \"Funny Animal\" by Matthew, thanks to The Robot House. All the other pictures are thanks to Betty.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "eab17ca680aa8fd775ab41960889cf4975074b5ce61ca80e983ca82f2c8a57b2"}
{"text": "A big office called \"OF Office\" helps to make rules about keeping people safe from harmful things like drugs. In 2018, they were given new rules to follow. They did some things right, like choosing people for two new important jobs. But the office doesn't have everything it needs to do all the new things they are supposed to, like having a way to keep track of all the information about drug rules on their website. \n\nWe said that the \"OF Office\" should make a plan to do all the things they need to. \n\nThe \"OF Office\" is also supposed to make a big plan every year about how they will control drugs. But they didn't make this plan in 2017 or 2018 like they were supposed to. They also need to check if other offices have enough money to help control drugs. But without a plan, they couldn't do this the right way. In 2019, they made a plan, but it didn't have everything it was supposed to. A rule was made in 2018 that asked for some changes and new ideas from ONDCP. They did some of the things asked, like finding five helpers. But, they didn't do everything right. They were asked to make a plan that tells how they will reach their goals, check how well they are doing, and make a plan to help more people who have problems with using too much of something. ONDCP didn't write down or tell how they would do these things, what steps they would take, or how long it would take. They also had to make an online list of information about drugs, like how much there is and how often people use them. They made a list, but it didn't have all the information it was supposed to have. The people at ONDCP didn't know what to do next to finish everything they were asked to do. Making plans, writing them down, and doing what the plan says is a good way to reach a goal. This is true for a group of people who work together to stop people from getting sick because of bad medicines. A long time ago, many people got very sick because of these bad medicines. So, a group of people decided to do something about it. They came up with some rules that they had to follow.\n\nBut they need to do more. They need to make plans, write them down, and make sure everyone knows what to do. This will help them do a better job and follow the rules. \n\nWe looked at what this group has been doing over the past few years. We also talked to the people in the group. After that, we came up with 4 ideas to help them do a better job. These ideas include making plans, writing them down, and doing what the plan says. The office agreed to put in place 2 new rules about their Plan, but didn't like 2 others about the Data Board. They said that recent changes are good enough. But, the group who checked the office's work said they could do better. This group believes that adding important planning parts would help meet the rules in a better way. \nChanges for Leaders to Make\nOffice Affected\nThe leader of the office should make and write down important planning parts. This will help the office meet the SUPPORT Act rules for the 2020 Plan and future Plans. These planning parts should talk about how much resources are used, when things should happen, and any processes, policies, who does what, and what is needed to meet each rule. (Change 1)\nFinished - Put in place\nActions that do what the change wanted have been done.\nIn the middle of 2021, the office's people addressed this change by sharing several inside guidance papers with important planning parts. This will help the office meet the SUPPORT Act rules for future Plans. For example, the office's people shared a paper that talks about who does what and overall processes for making the Plan. Also, they shared two lists that included detailed times for completing each rule. As a result, the office will be in a better place to make sure it can meet its rules related to the Plan every year, and this change is closed as put in place.\nThe boss of a place that helps people stay away from drugs should make a plan to meet some rules. They should use this plan in 2020 and in the future. \n\nThere are some actions that need to happen for this to work, and they have not happened yet. \n\nIn the middle of 2021, the people at this place showed us a guide with important things to do. They need to use this guide to make future plans. In 2022, they showed us their 2022 plan. There are still some more things that need to be done. Once these things are done, we will check to see if they have done everything they need to do.\n\nThe boss of this place should also make a plan to help them meet some more rules. These rules are about making a board that shows information about drugs. The board should have descriptions of what they are doing, when they are doing it, and who is doing it. \n\nThey told us some things on a day in 2020 about what they have done, and we are waiting for more information. There's an important group named \"ON.\" They made a tool better in the early part of a year. Then, in the middle of a year, they told everyone they are making some rules for the tool. They think these rules will be ready in the fall season of the year.\n\nThe leader of \"ON\" needs to make a plan. They need to use this plan to make the tool better. This is what they need to do.\n\nThey told us some things they have done on a late summer day. We are waiting for more details. They made the tool better in the early part of a year. In the middle of the year, they said they are making rules for the tool. They think the rules will be ready in the fall season of the year.\n\nThere's a short version of this story and a long version. You can also read it in a way that's easy for everyone.\n\nAlice and Triana have more information. You can ask them for help. This is all about a big problem with people using things they shouldn't and how the group \"ON\" is trying to help.\nIn the past few days, lots of news stories talked about the increasing problem of people using medicines in a wrong way... \nThe story was told by a man named Cameron. \nc1@organization.org\nTalking about medicines that doctors give, how laws control them, how we can measure if they are used right or wrong, problems with using them too much, how communities are affected, how we report about the use of these medicines, how much money we spend to control this problem, when it becomes a very big problem, and how we check if hospitals and doctors are doing a good job.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "8cfd91857801406d5f4b9f028fe8874ba861b58e6d3f8916667757483a5e0b64"}

{"text": "This is about a place called NE state. NE state is a big part of a country. Long ago, it was one of the first places where people lived in this country. In 2018, a lot of people lived there, making it one of the places with the most people.\n\nNE state has a city also called NE city. This city has lots of people, more than any other city in the country. In fact, many people in NE state live in NE city or close by. Also, a big number of people live in a place called LO Island. Many years ago, NE state and NE city got their names from a king. \n\nNE city is a very important place. It's where a big group of countries meet, called the United Nations. People say that NE city is a place where you can find many things: culture, money, news, and power. NE state has other cities with many people too. Besides NE city, there are other cities like BU city, RO city, YO city, and SY city. The main city of NE state is AL city.\n\nNE state is big and has many different kinds of places. This place is surrounded by other areas. To the south, we have NJ land and PA land. To the east, there are CT land, MA land, and VT land. It also touches the water near RI island. It even has a border with a faraway land called QC land and ON land. The bottom part of this place is near the big sea and has LI island and a few smaller islands. It also includes NE city and a river valley. The big top part of this place has many hills and mountains. It also has two big river valleys. One goes from top to bottom and the other goes from left to right. The far left part of this place is near big lakes and a waterfall. The middle part of this place is known for its many beautiful lakes, which people love to visit. \n\nA long time ago, this place was home to many people who spoke different languages. Then, people from a faraway land came here for trade and to share their beliefs. One day, a man named Henry came here on a ship for a company. The people from the faraway land built a fort near the meeting point of two rivers. This is where a big city was later built. People from a faraway place came to live in NE city and the nearby valley. They made this place a busy hub for trading and welcoming new people. Later, this place was taken over by people from another place called EN country. During a big fight, the local people tried to take control from the newcomers and they finally managed to become independent. In the old days, NE city grew a lot because of a big canal that helped them in many ways.\n\nNE city has a big park in the middle that many people know about, even if they haven't been there. For a long time, there was a high rail line that connected different places in the city. There is a special place in the city that remembers two tall buildings that were once there. There's also a big statue which was a friendly gift from people of another place.\n\nIn NE city, there's a place full of beautiful art called the Museum of Art. This place started with a gift of some prints and a drawing. There's a big house by the river, just outside the city. It's in a place called TA town. NE city also has a big garden full of different plants, a calm place among tall buildings and houses. We used to love visiting the big zoo when we lived in the big city. When we decided to go back, we were very excited. \n\nIn another place, called the ND town, there is a big cow statue named Sue. She is very tall and long! \n\nIn a place called the AD mountains, there is a beautiful spot for families to visit. You can go for a lovely walk, which everyone can enjoy.\n\nIn a town called TI, there is an old fort. The fort has a long and interesting history. \n\nIn the same town, there is a tour set that looks like it's from a space show. If you are passing through, you might want to check it out.\n\nAlso in a town called CL, there is a nice place called the Wooden Boat Inn. If you are visiting the Thousand Islands area, you might want to stay there.\n\nSpeaking of the Thousand Islands, they are in the very north of the state, close to another country. While there, you can visit two beautiful castles.\n\nThere are also many fun things to do in the Finger Lakes area.

{"text": "At the Big Water Place, a dolphin friend was taken care of. She was a grown-up dolphin from the big ocean. She came to the Big Water Place on the last day of the pumpkin month. The dolphin friend stayed there for 90 days. After that, she returned to the big ocean.\n\nHer name was \"Sophia\". Sophia was found near the ST city in a place called FR country. She was taken to the Big Water Place because she needed help. People saw that Sophia was not feeling well. She had marks from shark bites and looked skinny. \n\nA man named Ryan from the Zoo Society was keeping an eye on Sophia. He made sure Sophia was doing okay after she went back to the big ocean. \n\nSophia was found by a man in a boat. He saw her near a big bridge in ST city. The Wildlife Helpers brought Sophia to the Big Water Place. It was the last day of the pumpkin month, and she got there just as the sun was going down. \n\nBecause Sophia was found on the day of Halloween, she was given a name that was special for that day. She seemed scared during her journey to the Big Water Place. She was bending her back, which is what animals do when they are not feeling well. She was also breathing fast and feeling sick. But the people at the Big Water Place took good care of her until she was ready to go back to the big ocean. A girl named Sophia was found in a place she shouldn't be, but we don't know why. The caring people at the Big Animal House took some of her blood to see if she was okay. They did this on a day when everyone was dressed up in costumes, and they also wanted to see if she had been around some bad water in the FL state. Sophia got some water to drink that night and was able to swim all by herself. But she was still very sick. The next day, the people at Big Animal House looked at her more closely. \n\nIn the afternoon, the person in charge of the Big Animal House said that Sophia was as long as a big car, weighed as much as a big piano, and she was awake and noticed things happening around her. But she was still very sick, and things might change very quickly. They gave Sophia medicine for her sickness and tiny bugs that were making her ill, and someone was always with her. \n\nThe people at Big Animal House kept checking on Sophia, even using a special machine to see inside her. They also checked her all over, listened to her breathing, and took some more blood. They found that Sophia had a bad cough and a sore tummy. They also noticed that her teeth were very worn down, which made them think she was an old girl. \n\nSophia was still very sick and needed someone with her all the time, but she was able to eat some fish, which made everyone happy.\nOn a Sunday, Sophia was not feeling well and needed lots of help from the helpers and volunteers. By the next day, she was feeling better and started eating again in the morning. \n\nSophia is eating by herself but is still fighting off sickness. The hospital team is happy for those who have wished her well! Sophia's health is still not completely stable, but it's good to say she's been swimming in slightly deeper water and eating all the food given to her.\n\nSophia keeps on swimming by herself in the deeper water and eats all the fish given to her. She is playing with special toys that help her think and stay active. \n\nTests show she is getting a little better with medicine but signs of sickness are still there. Her health could change at any time.\n\nSophia has gotten a bit better since she came on the last day of October. She has been swimming by herself, eating all the fish given, and her tests show some improvement, all thanks to great care from the hospital team. She is also playing with special toys that help keep her mind and body healthy.\n\nBut, Sophia is not all better yet. The helpers continue to work to help her gain weight and fight off the sickness. A special picture-taking machine spotted a worry spot in the heart of a dolphin named Sophia. Doctors will keep an eye on this and try to figure out why it's there. They're also trying to find out why Sophia ended up where she shouldn't be. They don't think it's because of the bad sea plants in FR country or the sickness that dolphins can get. It's still too soon to tell what will happen to Sophia, but she's doing a little better under the doctors' care.\nWe are very thankful to everyone who gives money to help. If you want to support, go to a website and choose \"Helping sea animals get better\" from the list.\nSophia's getting better and better. She's swimming in deeper water and playing with her toys. She doesn't need medicine anymore since Saturday. Doctors are still trying to find out why Sophia ended up where she shouldn't be. They're planning to check her hearing next.\nDoctors measured Sophia and found out she weighs as much as 319 toy blocks. She got a bit heavier by 22 toy blocks over 13 days - a good sign that the care and food she's getting is helping.\nSophia passed her hearing check, another good sign. The doctors have been talking to animal officials about how she's doing. Sophia keeps getting heavier and eats 28 toy blocks of fish every day. Our friend, Salem, is still being looked after all day and night by caring people. Taking care of just one dolphin like Salem can be very costly. At the same time, the team is also dealing with lots of nature problems, like the effects of a harmful red tide in FR country. Some helpful government assistance has come, but it's not enough. Help from people like you can make a big difference. \nWhen Salem was found, it taught us something important. Some people tried to push her back into the sea, but she came back to the beach. It's crucial that people don't try to push sea animals back into the water. Instead, they should let trained helpers know right away.\n\nIf you see a sea turtle, a big sea animal, or a dolphin like Salem that looks unwell, or not moving, in SR or MN counties in FR country, let the team know. You can call them anytime at a special phone number: 9-1-1-2. Try to tell them what the animal looks like and what it's doing. If you can, take pictures or a video. \n\nIf you see these animals looking unwell or not moving anywhere else in FR country, call the animal helpline: 8-8-8-2.\nIf you're in the SE part of our country, you can ring a special number to talk to people who help sea animals. \nDid you know? \nSpecial tools called motion sensors are helping scientists learn what sharks do all day in the ocean.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "47c2d66cb6b977513990b9d2518bd6d9fb47b00c7ae6f37e512aa9f53f43cde0"}
{"text": "A Story About a Very Rich Family\nOnce, there was a funny story about a very rich family. A lot of people were talking about this story because it was all about people who looked like them. But the story wasn't just about that. It was about how different it is to live in one place or another, even if you look the same.\n\nThis story is like many love stories you've heard before. There's even a part where a boy stops a girl from getting on a plane because he wants to tell her he loves her! But this story is special because it shows lots of things about a different way of life--things like buildings, ways of thinking, and most of all, food. For every time you see a person without a shirt in this story, you see food twice as much!\n\nThis story is based on a book by a man named Kevin. It's about a girl named Rachel who is AM country, but her family is from a place called CH country. She goes to SI country with her boyfriend Nick to go to a wedding. Nick is from SI country, and he's very good looking. This is the first time Rachel gets to meet Nick's family. But there's one thing Nick didn't tell Rachel--his family is almost like kings and queens because they have a lot of houses.\nThere was a movie made by a man named Jon. He made many movies before, some about dancing, some about singing, and some about magic. All of his movies are fun to watch and this new one is no different. It's filled with lots of bright colors and is very fast and fun to watch. It's like going to a big party.\n\nThe movie has a lot of people in it. The main person in the movie is a lady named Eleanor. She is played by an actress named Michelle. Michelle is really good at showing how her character is feeling without saying anything. Eleanor is a person who doesn't like to show what she's thinking or feeling, but Michelle plays her so well that you can tell what's going on in her mind.\n\nThere are many other people in the movie who are part of Eleanor's family. But there's another actress who stands out. Her name is Awkwafina and she does a great job in the movie too. In the story, there's a girl named Rachel who has a bubbly friend called Grace. Grace is funny and a bit quirky - she makes people laugh a lot. This story reminds me of another funny story, where a girl named Fiona was just as funny. But Grace is also very kind when she needs to be. There are other characters in the story too. Some of them might be familiar, like Kevin and Ronny, but there are many others from different places in the world.\n\nThis story, like many others, talks about some important things. It asks questions like should kids always follow in their family's footsteps? What happens when the family's past is something too big to handle? And at the end of the story, Rachel and her friend Nick have to answer a very important question: how much would you give up for someone you love?\n\nBut this story isn't just about that. It's also about a problem between Rachel and another character. This character doesn't think Rachel is the right wife for her son. And this problem is all about the differences between people from AS country and people from AM country. Rachel is different and not what Nick's mom had in mind for her son. She doesn't think Rachel can take care of their family's good name. Rachel has to face some tough people: Nick's old girlfriend and a group of ladies who do not like her, thinking she is only after Nick's wealth. There's also a man who teases Rachel because she's not from a rich family like theirs. \nThis story shows us many ways how having a lot of money can change things. We see big, fancy places all the time. There are also a few scenes that show the normal life in the city. Nick's family is spread all over the world, doing different jobs, all to make their family name stronger. Having a lot of money can make beautiful things happen, like a big fancy wedding. But, it can also make people act badly, like a party-loving man who is not nice. There are many small stories in this big story, but the most interesting one is about Nick's cousin. Her husband, like Rachel, worked hard to earn his money and is not from a rich family. Unlike Adam and Rachel, the problems between Alice and Michael are too big to fix. Some people might think this is just a love story they've seen before. That's because there's nothing very new or surprising about the movie. Plus, there are so many stories in the movie that it's hard to care about all of them.\n\nBut Crazy Rich Asians is more than just a love story. It has a lot of hidden messages about how different cultures can be, what it's like to be very rich, and how families work. Yes, the idea of giving up things for love is a bit silly, but it's told in a way that feels real and makes sense. I won't talk about why it's important to see different types of people in movies--other people can explain that better than me. But I will say this: having a love story with only Asian actors is what makes this movie special. It's something you don't see a lot in HW city. As someone who is also Asian-AM country, I really understood Rachel's problem of trying to fit into a place that is both hers and not hers at the same time. There was a girl who felt out of place in a new, strange country. There was a funny and quick movie about rich people who lived in Asia, and it made people very hungry because of all the yummy food it showed. A boy named Cameron watched this movie and thought it was worth spending time and money on, but it had a few things that could be better. Cameron also liked to write about other things like superheroes and video games. There were other stories about the movie, like how a lot of people went to see the good movies and didn't go to the bad ones. A boy named Matthew wrote about this. He also wrote about a movie about a scary nun and a big shark. The movie about the rich people in Asia was one of the stories he wrote about. He also wrote about how people could see this movie early and for free. This movie was about Asian people, it was funny, and it was a love story.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "512517de8ecec412c8f0ba2fb3bb172db3bd7bb80a0c61ab7543a8de8ebda0a7"}

This happened just a little while after she came back from a long time away from home. Her big house is where she will stay under the watch of some important people while she tries to make her business better again.\nBefore she had to leave her home, Madison was sad that she would miss her pets -- cats, dogs, horses, birds and chickens -- and she wanted to be back in time to take care of her garden in spring.\nOn that day, she came out of her house, wearing a light coat, dark pants and boots. Madison walked with a friend and a red, fluffy dog, to a place with snow where her horses were. She gave her horses treats and touched their noses, then she waved to people who were writing about her before going back into her house.\nMadison was taken to her big house far away from a big city after landing early in the morning at a nearby airport in a small plane. She was later seen walking around inside her house with her daughter, Alice.\nFor the next many days, Madison must wear a special bracelet so that important people can see where she is. She cannot have any drinks that grown-ups like, and can only leave for a short time to do a job.\nHer trip back home started late at night, when two big cars with dark windows left the gates of the place where she was staying in WA state, and drove to a nearby airport.\nA woman named Sophia was very happy.

{"text": "In a place called MP Park, many people spent a lot of time making a plan for a beautiful park. They wanted the park to be a great place for everyone, but the people in charge didn't make the park like they planned.\n\nA man named Kevin walked through MP Park. He saw things that reminded him of big ships. The park was made on a place where there used to be big flying ships.\n\nThe plan for MP Park was really good. People had lots of ideas and a very good park architect helped to make the plan. But the people in charge didn't follow the plan, even though other important people in the city said it was good.\n\nOver time, some things in the park got better. For example, there are now more places for people to do art and watch plays. But the park could have been even better if they had followed the original plan.\n\nTo understand what happened, it's helpful to think about what a very good park designer said. His name was Fredrick and he compared making a park to making a big theater. But what if, after the theater was built, they decided to use it for many other things like a church, a court house, a jail, a place to skate, and a place for circus and dog shows? Sorry if this is a lot; it's something I feel strongly about. \nDavid, who helped make lots of parks all over the world, thought that making parks was like painting a picture or creating music. He would probably say that we shouldn't change a beautiful painting or a great piece of music just to make it modern. He thought parks should be made by those who knew how to do it and that changing the plan was not a good thing. He knew his parks needed to work for the people who use them.\n\nThe building of MP park has suffered from changes to the original plan. One person who was part of the project said, \"Our way of doing things is not real!\" \nThat's a strong thing to say. But Wendy, who was on the city council for 20 years, knew a lot about how things work in government.\n\nMP park is a sad story of how plans can get messed up by too many people wanting different things. The story starts with a famous person named William, who the park is named after, and ends with local leaders and groups changing a plan they didn't really understand.\nAfter William moved on from his job, he saw a chance to change a big, 400-acre old air station site into a big park. He wanted this because of his good friend, Magnuson. William wanted the land to be a place everyone could use and enjoy, not just a place to build houses to make money.\n\nMagnuson also thought that the University should be able to use part of the land. The local MI people had a history and interest in the site, as did some big groups.\n\nNow, it's easy for us to forget that this place was a busy air base during a big war with lots of buildings, places for airplanes, a fuel station, a store, a laundry, and even a jail. When the city started to take over parts of it in the 1970s, it was not a clean beach with lots of nature.\n\nEven then, not everyone was happy with what might happen. The fact that this place was a fully working airport that could become a place for non-military planes caused worry. So did the idea that there was interest in a big housing project mostly for people who didn't have much money.\n\nFinally, in 1975 a deal was made with the big groups. The deal, in general, allowed the north part of the site to be saved for a big ocean and weather group. A long time ago, people decided to make low-cost homes using existing buildings. They also gave a big piece of land to the city. Not everyone got what they wanted. Much later, an important person made a deal to give the rest of the land to the city.\n\nThen, they had to figure out what to do with this place. Many people, like city workers, officials, famous people, and different groups, had ideas about what to do with the land. The city came up with some designs.\n\nAt the same time, a man named Matthew, who was friends with a woman named Wendy, thought that everyone should have a say in making the park. Instead of deciding everything from the top, why not ask people what they want in a park? This was a new idea. Wendy got a group of friends, including Thomas and Isabel, and others, to help. They asked many community groups what they wanted in a new park.\n\nThe group took all the ideas and, with help from some park lovers, hired a famous garden designer to make a design. They picked this designer because he was known all over the world for his great garden designs. He also helped a lot at a big school.\nIn a town, a man named Henry used a lot of important information from the people who lived there to make a big plan. He wanted to make a special space that could be used for lots of different things like playing, relaxing, and having fun. Henry was really good at making sure all these different things could happen in the same place without bothering each other. He knew that a park is more than just a place to play.\n\nHe didn't want people to say he was the only one who made the plan. He wanted it to be known as \"the people's plan.\" The group of people who helped him took the plan back to the bigger groups who had given ideas. In the end, they gave the plan to the leaders of the town.\n\nEveryone thought the plan was really good. A man named Patrick, who was the leader of the town a while back, talked to even more people about the plan and got them to like it too. After that, it was given to the town's leaders. They looked at all the different plans, but they liked the people's plan the best! They decided to make a few small changes and then said, \"Yes, let's do it!\" on the first day of November. The people who worked really hard on the plan were so happy. They were glad they lived in a town where the people could choose what they wanted.\n\nThe plan wasn't just about making a place for lots of activities. It was also about making the place beautiful again. The plan was simple, but it also thought about a lot of little things. It considered where people could see the best views, how good the beaches were for swimming, which way the wind usually blew, what kind of dirt was there, which trees to keep, and how to fix the wetlands. It also thought about the best places for parking, playing, open spaces, and where people could enjoy nature without getting hit by a baseball from the baseball fields.\nThe city liked the plan and gave it to the people who take care of parks. They sent the plan to a team of builders named Adam and Adam. These builders had to make the final plan and fix some problems. Some people thought that the man who made the first plan should finish the work, but Adam and Adam were already working with the city. Both teams were very good at their jobs and liked each other's work. Adam and Adam used the first plan to move forward with the project, even if they had other ideas.\n\nThe job of making the plan come to life was given to the city parks team. This team had made plans before that the city didn't like. In 2005, they asked 350 sports groups to share their ideas for the park. They didn't ask people who just liked to relax in the park or liked art or music.\n\nEric, a very important person in the parks team, was in charge of the park's development. As people in the city came and went, Eric became the person to talk to about the park. Eric hired seven people to help plan and design the park. These plans included more sports activities and changed the plan that was approved by the city.\n\nSoon, different groups started to ask for changes in the main plan. People sometimes wanted their part of a place to be bigger or put somewhere else. There were already plans to have ball fields, but people who liked sports asked for even more. They wanted more fields, bigger fields, and more lights for playing at night. But some other people didn't like this because they thought it would bring too many people from other places. \n\nThe original plan also had a role for groups that help other people. They made this happen with groups that like art, like Pottery Northwest. A school also needed a place. Clubs for bicycles, soccer, and mountain climbing found new places for their offices. Some plans seemed too big, like a huge new area for playing tennis, with six courts under a big plastic bubble.\n\nThe biggest push came from people who liked sports, especially soccer and baseball. One plan, liked a lot by soccer fans, had 15 fields with lights. But this would have changed the plan a lot, so in the end they decided to have fewer fields.\n\nAs more time passed, people started to forget the original plan. Some people who sell things thought they could put their shops in the park. Now, the people in charge have let someone turn Building 11 into shops, offices, and places to eat. This is something that people like Alice, Matthew, Henry, and Oliver would have said no to.\nThe story talks about a park that was changed by the people in charge. Oliver was a friend of the person who first thought of the park. But then, Benjamin became the new head of the park and he made some changes. Some of these changes were different from the first plan. \n\nBenjamin also made a group of park users to help make decisions. This group was a good idea and it helped to solve some problems. But then, some people wanted to make the park a \"historic place\". They hoped this would stop big companies and sports groups from using the park too much.\n\nAfter some time, Benjamin decided to stop being the head of the park. Then, Mayor Matthew chose Cameron as the new head. Cameron had a new job for his friend Frank. \n\nCameron had a plan to make money for the park. This plan could let the park get money from the people who live in SE city. The people in charge of the city liked this idea because it could help the park without having to spend less money or let go of workers. The town could use the money saved from parks to add more helpers for the mayor's new plans.\n\nA group that knows a lot about city parks shares some surprising facts. A big city, let's call it \"SE city\", was one of the top four cities in the country for how much each person pays for parks. This was based on information from 2007. And SE city was the top city in the country for the number of park helpers for each person in 2008.\n\nThe great idea for a park, let's call it \"M park\", is not as shiny as before. People in charge are busy finding ways to make money that would help keep city jobs safe. People in SE city have been kind in supporting the building of new parks and making parks better. People might have thought the city's leaders checked carefully what saying yes or no would do, only to find out now that the leaders did not think about how to take care of the growing parks.\n\nA writer for a newspaper in SE city wrote about the leaders and their support for asking people to pay more money for big parks a few years ago, before money became tight. The plan did not include money for taking care of the bigger parks system in the long run. A leader told the writer, \"We did not think ahead. You never sit and think of what could happen.\"\n\nWe don't know how long our money problems will last or if more are coming, but with plans being made for a park by the water when a big road comes down, it seems like a good idea to ask if our city's leaders might, as the leader says, sit and think about how this dream can be paid for and taken care of.\nA team imagines a large garden as a strong method for native people to become close again with friends, art, and the outdoors in a big city. This happened not too long ago in a place called SE city and KI county.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "4cb829d42eb1ff511ef253824728c8599b205a66fbf10da12cc2f59f8dcd8144"}
{"text": "Friendly Night\nIn the chilly month of November, a lady named Lucy began our gathering with a song about being friends. It went something like, 'If you ever need help, I'll be there... Even when other friendships fade away, ours will remain strong.'\n\nThe invite to this special night came with a friend certificate. This could be printed and given to a buddy to thank them for being a good friend. This idea came from a friend who realized it's important to tell our friends how much we care about them.\n\nThere were also songs and poems about friendship, and stories about friends from when we were kids. A lady named Madison remembered her first friend from when she was about 3 or 4 years old, just before starting school. She made this friend at her babysitter's place, and her friend's name was Jessica. A lady named Patricia still sends holiday cards every year to a friend from school. They live about 15 miles apart and always say they will meet but they never do. Many of us agreed that this was how we kept in touch with some friends, even though we didn't always have exciting news to share.\n\nAs well as real friends, there were lots of memories about toys that were like friends, and some toys that were only for looking at and not for playing with.\nJessica had a doll made of straw and cloth that she colored herself. Grace found a rabbit. Bella had a special doll from a long time ago named Rachel. Rachel was a gift during a holiday season, she still has all her clothes, but she can't talk anymore. \n\nJane showed us her paper containers that she could only look at, not touch, when she was little, just like Enid's pig toys that were in a picture book. Jane shared that she made new friends by playing and talking with them on her computer, and everyone agreed. They ended the day with a song about being friends and helping each other. It was a song about a boy named Rupert and a Frog.\n\nRemember, there are some important things happening soon. There is going to be a new helper at our group, and a museum in a place called BC country is going to show us something about a lady named Emma.

{"text": "There was a special dance event at the RO Opera House. It was called Dance 3. It was a show to help new choreographers. The show went to many places in the FR country. Each night, there were three dances. There was also a dreamy dance-film by Heather. But it was hard to hear the film on the first night.\n\nThere were some problems on the first night. But the audience was still happy. They cheered a lot. The show was a big success in the NE city.\n\nThe first dance of the night was Cabin Fever. It was a fast, 15-minute solo dance. Tom made up the dance, and Stephen danced it. The dance was about feeling trapped and wanting to get out. But it was not clear what Stephen was trying to get away from, or what the bright light offstage was.\n\nTom's dance was full of quick, nervous moves. Stephen moved his upper body a lot. The dance had a war-like feel: the green costume, the bright lighting. In a bright white light, Matthew moves in a way that seems like he's stuck in something. As the music gets faster and louder, it seems like he's being pulled away by things we can't see. Even when the light gets dimmer, Matthew keeps moving, as if he's having a hard time inside, making us wonder what will happen next.\n\nIn the story, \"Strange and Wonderful,\" it looks like it's talking about the difference between being in public and being private, and the idea of letting others in. There's a dance between Patrick and Lily that's full of strong feelings. This is made even stronger by the brave choice of the choreographer, Benjamin, to have no sound at all.\n\nIn another part of the story, about love and dislike, there's never any comfort. The couple moves in and out of a box of light in the middle of the stage. They pull each other in and out of the light, sometimes with passion, sometimes gently, but sometimes they're rough or just don't care. Their movements are quick, upset, and breathy. Does she want him? Does he care about her?\n\nIn the end, they do come together, and the couple briefly enjoys being together under the bright light. Then they disappear into the darkness on the edges, back into their private world, away from others watching them, but this time as a pair. This story talks about two great dancers, Charlotte and Jack, and their special dance called 4M2. This dance was inspired by stories of people feeling alone. When they danced, there were sounds of these stories and pictures on a screen that showed the same feeling of being alone.\n\nThere aren't many dances that use sounds, pictures, and dancing all together, and this was a good try. But, the sounds and pictures didn't really help the dance, and the dance didn't really help show what the sounds and pictures were about. So, they seemed a bit extra.

Even when they do the same dance, you can feel different things from each of them.

{"text": "A man named Thomas loved to draw pictures inspired by cartoons and comics. Thomas liked these things so much, he sometimes called himself a \"comic book fan\". It's hard to see Thomas as anything other than really cool. People all over the world know him for his special style of art, and because he's made a new kind of art all by himself. Thomas has worked with lots of important people, doing projects like designing clothes and making pictures for music albums. He even made a music video with a popular singer.\n\nThomas's first love was animation. He grew up in a big city and went to a famous art school there, where he learned about a traditional style of painting. But as he got older, Thomas became unhappy with the kind of art he was studying and the art being made in his home country, which he thought was just copying trends from other places. Thomas made lots of colorful art when he was young, and he created a special character named \"Mr. D.\" This character became very famous and people recognized it as Thomas's symbol.\n\nThomas saw lots of new art styles when he went to NE city in 1994. When he came back to his home in JP country, he used what he learned to make his art even better. He used cartoon characters and bright flowers and mushrooms in his pictures. \n\nIn the early 2000s, he put together a big art show in LA city. He showed everyone a new way to make art that he called \"Superflat.\" This style made everything look flat and mixed together, like high and low. After this show, everyone knew about his unique style and \"Superflat\" became very popular.\n\nThomas also used his art to talk about things in JP country that he thought should be different. Some of his art pieces, like a sculpture he made called \"My Lonely Cowboy,\" show these ideas. A very talented artist, known as \"M\", once made a picture that was bought for lots of money. M likes to try new things and has worked with many fashion designers, including those at LV, where he spent 13 years making beautiful designs for their bags. \n\nM really likes streetwear and has worked with some of the biggest names in the business, like a man named \"V\". M often works with a popular brand, S, making designs for things like skateboards and special t-shirts to help people without homes. In the last few years, M has started to do different types of art and even started his own company, KK, to help young artists. He has also started making music and videos. \n\nWhen asked how his work mixes old and new art, current culture, and ideas about the future, M had this to say.\nI loved watching space movies a lot when I was younger. Around that time, in a far-off land, there were some very exciting movies being made by a group of friends. They created movies about space adventures, close encounters with alien beings, and big battles. At the same time, some amazing animated space movies were also coming from JP country. These movies were so good that they blew my mind!\n\nFor a long time, I have loved creating my own animations and watching stories about space and make-believe worlds. I wondered why I liked these so much, and I realized it was because they let me imagine a world different from our own. When I watch a movie about space or a fantasy world, I can forget about my worries. Imagining about space beings or fun science ideas is something I find very exciting. As a youngster, I wanted to create entertainment for others. But I found that I was not very good at drawing in the style of the animated movies I loved, and I struggled to come up with interesting stories. So, I decided not to work in that field. Once, I tried to learn a special kind of art at the big school but I found it too hard. So, I decided to learn about new art instead. There was a big sculpture made by an artist in 2011 called \"Big Box\". It was very cool.\nPeople asked the artist, \"What things from the East and West helped you make your art?\" The artist said, \"I liked the clothes from a famous movie and clothes from different places like ME country and JA country. I think it's fun to mix things from different places to make something new, whether it's a fancy design or something simple.\"\nPeople then asked, \"How do people from different places see your art?\" The artist said, \"In JA country, some people don't like my art. They say it's not good that I show our culture as not important to people from other places. But I just want to show the beauty of our cartoon style to people outside JA country. I think it's right to show what I think is important about it.\" A long time ago, there was a man named Adam who had a special way of looking at things. He believed that everything could be as simple as a flat picture, even when they seemed to have many layers. Adam thought of this idea when he first saw a new kind of computer and cell phones that didn't work very well. \n\nAdam lived in a place called JA country, where after a big fight, people thought that having a lot of money was bad and being poor was good. This made it hard for anyone to be better than anyone else. Now, even though some people have more money than others, they try to act like they don't. Because of this, everything became simple, just like a flat picture. \n\nFor instance, there was a kind of art in JA country that made everything look flat and simple. This art came from CH country, where it looked more lifelike, but when it got to JA country, it turned flat, like a background for a play. Adam called this \"Superflat.\" Then, when the internet and social media came around, Adam saw that everything in the world became just like his idea of Superflat. People were really happy when they could all share things they know with each other. But then, some people started to share things that were not true. This has made some people have more than others. Just like how we have fun songs and fun pictures, we will always have things that are different from them. \nThere was a picture called \"Blue Flowers & Skulls\" made in 2012. \nHow did you start liking fashion so much?\n\"My first time working with clothes was with IM Men by NT. They used pictures of eyes and mushrooms I made. When I worked with LV, MJ asked me to join. His helper had seen my pictures at the CF and that's how we met. At that time, I didn't know anything about clothes or expensive things. I wondered what I could do best and what MJ was looking for. I thought maybe he wanted something like JA country cartoons, which are fun and for kids. So, I came up with many designs with that idea. MJ sent me a message saying that he liked the panda in my picture called Tan Tan Bo Puking--a.k.a. Gabriel and I had fun making the LV Panda and his friends, Onion Head and Flower Hatman. I'm surprised that Matthew and the LV team agreed to make these unusual characters. \n\nEmma shows off a Louis Vuitton X Takashi Murakami bag.\n\nI believe the boss of LVMH, Benjamin, had the last word. But when it came to new ideas, he seemed to like anything that he thought was fun. I've come to realize how special Mr. Benjamin is.\n\nI got to make a big balloon of the panda to float over the fashion show, and even a cartoon. He helped with a party for an art show. At that party, I sat next to Kevin for the first time, and we became good friends. He worked hard to bring art and fashion together.\n\nAfter working on many fashion projects, what do you enjoy most about the connection between fashion and art?\n\nAdam and Victor, who were probably young adults then, saw my project at the LV store in NE city. Victor shared a story from a long time ago. He said there weren't many art places in the city that made them feel welcome. Victor's first time seeing art was in a shop window. This was a big change in the world of fashion, even though I didn't know it at the time.\n\nVictor and Thomas worked together, but not everyone liked it. Some people didn't like that they put a shop in a big art place. I thought it was a good idea because it was new and different. I am grateful to Peter, the big boss of the art place, Jack, the person in charge, and two important people from the shop, Victor and Benjamin, for letting me do this. \n\nAfter that, I worked with Kevin to make a music video. This led to more work in fashion. I got to work with Victor again. Working with the shop had a big effect. I've been a part of many fun projects in the world of dressing up. How has new stuff and changes helped your art in 3D and moving pictures? \"New stuff is helping me more and more. When I was in school, I found it hard to learn in the normal way. Especially, I couldn't remember things well, which made learning history or doing math very hard. But at that time, I didn't know I was having trouble learning, so I tried hard and didn't give up. I would try to study for a very long time but couldn't remember much. I also found it hard to remember people's names, which made talking with people difficult. But now, as long as you know how to look up things online, you don't have to remember everything; on the internet, people's names and pictures show up right away. This has been very helpful for me as new stuff keeps coming up.\"\nYou said that you don't think a lot about your past work because you are more focused on the future. What are you working on now and what are your plans for the future? \"I wrote the words for a new song and had my friends [Yara and Zachary] make the music for it, and we even made a music video. The song's name is 'Let's Visit the Big Machine.' I also sang a different song from a long time ago called 'Cocoa Song.' I plan to share these songs this year. I don't want to be a singer, but I like to share my thoughts in different ways. I try to use ways I think I can do well.\nM's Art is Amazing and Wonderful\nV's Art Mixes Old and New\nSay Hello to K!\nFashion and Art Together Forever\nThe Story of Running Machines\nHow R Made Art Different\nChic Outfit of the Day", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "c0151111fab04467911ae35c8e5a189873032283c961a2fb8ddab31a470ffc2d"}
{"text": "Sunlight is helping to bring power to places where people don't have electricity. Imagine not being able to use phones or computers because there's no electricity. This is true for over 2 billion people in the world. But lots of these people live where the sun shines brightly, so sunlight power can help them a lot. \n\nSpecial companies have made sunlight power things that people can afford. They also help people to pay for them little by little. They're very happy because they've reached big goals. \n\nOne company sold 125,000 sunlight power systems for homes. These systems have two lamps and a light that can be carried around. The light can shine for up to 15 hours after being charged by the sun. The company thinks these systems can be very useful for homes and small businesses. \n\nEach system costs around $120 at first. But people can pay bit by bit, which makes the systems more affordable. They don't have to pay a big amount of money at once. People can take their things home, set them up, and then pay little by little until they fully own them. There's also a \"pay-as-you-go\" way, where people set up their things and pay whenever they can. With each payment, the thing works for a certain time until they fully own it. \"If they pay more often, they own the thing sooner,\" said Thomas. Payments are made with special cards, like adding time to a toy phone. A special number is put into the thing to make it work. Depending on where they are, owners can even pay through their toy phones and start the thing with a tiny chip. According to Thomas, the things cost around 150 to 160 pretend coins in the end.\n\nThere's also a big celebration for a group that helps others. They sold their one-millionth sun light in April. This group, which got a big pretend money award for its Global Helping Challenge last year, teaches people in small places to sell sun lights. This not only brings light to people, but also gives more jobs and helps the place they live in grow. According to the group, they went from selling 1,000 lights each month in 2010 to over 50,000 each month as of March 2014.\n\n\"The great sales of SunnyMoney is not the end. But it helps us show an alternative to the bad things that hurt our world and keep many in a circle of not having enough,\" said the group's leader, Jack, in a message. There are businesses that want to help our planet and the people living on it. They are like helpers who never forget their goal to do good things.\n\nSometimes, it's hard for these businesses to convince people to use new things, like solar energy, instead of old things, like fuels from the earth. People are used to the old ways and it's tough to change.\n\nIn the past year, these businesses have been working with teachers. The teachers help spread the word and show people how solar energy can be used in their homes. It's like when one friend sees another friend doing something cool, they want to do it too. Then, people in the community start selling these solar tools.\n\nOne of the helpers compared the growth of solar tools to cell phones in Africa. Just like cell phones became very popular there, he believes solar tools can too. The reasons are simple - the technology is affordable and easy to get. So, there's no reason why solar energy can't become popular quickly.\n\nThis story was told by a writer who used to work for a website about renewable energy. She has a lot of education in writing and English.\nThe last story talked about choosing teams for making wind energy in the sea. The next story asks if there will be a lot of wind energy in the future. It's not sure yet. The cost of making energy in a good way is going up because it's getting harder to do. Two groups are working together to store energy at a place where they make energy from the sun.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "192c251e486302f6a7ad7aa31c26cbeae19394c7df75f295145c882351c83561"}

{"text": "In a big competition, two people named Adam and Gretchen are trying to be the leader of their team. Adam is saying that Gretchen has a connection with a big group called \"BL group\" that takes care of people's health. Gretchen thinks a plan where everyone can get health care from one place won't work in their home, the MI state. \n\nWe don't know how much support the people from the BL group have given to Gretchen. There are other people also trying to be the leader like Shri and others. \n\nBL group has become something that Adam talks about a lot in his competition. He tries to say that Gretchen has a special connection with BL group because her father, Richard, was the big boss of BL group a long time ago. \n\nDuring a big talk in GR city last month, Adam said he is not influenced by big groups like BL group and made indirect comments about Gretchen. He mentioned that unlike Gretchen, he didn't attend a special event in spring that was organized by big bosses of BL group. \n\nAdam, who used to be a big boss in the health department of a city, said, \"I didn't have a special event organized for me by BL group -- and I will not.\" \"Speaking honestly, it's not good to take money from big companies that have influenced our decisions too much.\"\nIn a chat, Wendy said that setting up a health care system for everyone in MI state is \"not possible.\"\n\"I'm not against it, but it's not something we can do right now,\" Wendy said about health care for everyone. \"... The predictions say it's not possible in MI state right now.\"\nOn his journey, Ethan has based his hope for the Democratic choice on reaching out to people who may not trust big companies, especially really big ones like a large health insurance company in MI state, which has many members and has a big part of the state's private insurance market and takes care of plans in both the Medicare and Medicaid systems.\n\"My competition is taking a lot of money from companies like the big health insurance one,\" Ethan said last month in a chat for a Detroit podcast. \"I don't take their money -- so they don't control me.\"\nEthan's biggest fans have really liked his words about the big health insurance company.\n\"I think the only reason it's not possible for Wendy is because she needs money from the big health insurance company,\" said Taylor, a retired teacher from WB town who is supporting Ethan.\nA girl named Wendy and her friends got some help from people at the BC company. These people and their group gave a lot of gifts to friends of Wendy and others, too. But we don't know how many gifts they got or who got them.\n\nThere's a group in Michigan that likes Wendy a lot. They made TV ads to help Wendy, but we don't know who gave them money for this. \n\nAnd Wendy and other people who want to be leaders don't have to say who gave them gifts until the end of July, just before the big choice day.\n\n\"Craig\", who watches over things like this, says it's hard to keep track of all the gifts because of the rules.\n\nA boy named Adam said some things about the BC company. After a big change, Adam wants everyone to have the same kind of help when they're sick. But not everyone agrees with him.\n\nA long time ago, a big fight happened over how to help people when they're sick. A leader named Barry decided to let people buy help from private companies.\n\nSome people don't like Barry's idea and want to change it. But others like the idea of everyone having the same kind of help, like in CA country.\nSometimes, Ethan tries to ask Bella about her not talking about a certain kind of insurance and her seeming support from BR company. \n\"We're not saying words like 'certain kind of insurance' because too many people from our group have been influenced,\" Ethan said at a group meeting in DE city. \nBut until now, the older Bella from EL city hasn't responded to the younger Ethan from ST city. \nWhen asked about her support from BR company managers, Bella changes the topic to talk about the support she's got from other groups. \n\"I'm happy to have support from Emily's group. I'm happy to have support from the workers' group,\" Bella said. \"There are a lot of different groups -- the nature club joined us just recently.\"\nPeople at the BR company's group didn't want to say anything. \nBut a lady from the insurance company questioned if there's a need to change the insurance market for a government-run system. \n\"More people have insurance, more small businesses are offering coverage, and prices in the small group and individual markets are getting better. More people are joining Medicaid,\" the BR company lady said. \"There's good competition here. The private health insurance market is doing well in MI state, and we see no need to change it.\"\nCharlotte was always trying to help others. She had a big job where she made sure more people could go to the doctor when they were sick. She was very good at her job and proud of her work. \"I helped a lot of people get to see the doctor,\" Charlotte said. \"I didn't just talk about it, I did it.\"\n\nThen, there was a question everyone wanted to know. How can we make sure everyone gets to see a doctor and who will pay for it?\n\nAdam was always talking about this. He didn't like that some big companies seemed to like Charlotte more than him. He was still not the most popular, with Benjamin being more liked than him. Benjamin also wanted everyone to see the doctor.\n\n\"If you look at all the money we spend on doctors, a lot of it goes to the companies that help us pay the doctor,\" Benjamin said. \"If we all just paid together, it might be cheaper because we could get better prices.\"\n\nBut unlike Adam, Benjamin didn't have a plan for how to do this.\n\nAdam had an idea, though. He wanted to ask businesses to help pay. Little businesses would give a little, and big businesses would give a bit more. This would help everyone get to see the doctor.\nA man named Ethan said that the first big amount of money a business makes would not be taxed. This would help the owners of small businesses because they wouldn't have to pay for their workers' health care. Ethan's idea is also supported by a tax that changes based on how much money people make. The tax would be higher for people who make more money. \n\"Is it going to be hard to do? Yes,\" Ethan said. \"But is it the right thing to do? Absolutely.\"\nA man from DE city named Gabriel, who is 54 years old, wasn't sure about Ethan's idea. He wanted to know more about it, especially how it would be paid for. Gabriel, who helps people with politics, hasn't decided who he wants to be the leader yet. \"It's easy to say what you're going to do. But don't give me empty promises because I know it's all about the money -- and the votes,\" he said.\nAt a meeting on a summer day in DE city, Ethan tried to make everyone understand that health care for everyone is the most important thing for the job he wants. And he thinks that a big company is stopping it from happening.\n\"Right now, we are watching as people have been influenced by the insurance company that wants to keep things the same,\" he said. \"Ethan said, 'This isn't right. We need to be brave and say we don't need a helper for our health care, we can do it ourselves.' Ethan, William and Thomas are going to have a big talk on TV in a big city. \nSome helpers at the hospital say they might not work anymore, just like other health care helpers in our area. \nA company that helps with teeth bought another company. \nLots of helpers at a place where old people live might not work anymore, which would be hard for everyone. \nYou can get a letter every week that tells you about what's happening with health care where we live.\"", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "f74c9b59558c1629998029bf8027899c655b57e8520b9dbe963ffac291db19d2"}

I'm just sad I couldn't find the lost little things. I'm sure we could find more about Oliver's job if we looked really hard online. For example, here are the notes from a big meeting of movie people, held in BE city in 1963: And even better, a letter showing he lived in NE city while working for a big group, in 1960: Quite a guy, our Oliver.\nDavid started a chat in Southern European & Balkan Lands\nI'd like to show you some things that I just got and that belonged to Oliver, a diplomat from a big land. The story comes mainly from a 2004 online story (and a good one for those of you who speak the local language). Oliver was born in a city, on a day in September. His dad, Adam, was a teacher, and Oliver got his first name to remember his uncle, who got sick and passed away when he was 33, in the early 20th century. There was a smart man named Oliver who was known for writing beautiful poems and stories during a time when his home country, BR country, was taken over by another kingdom. He also wanted his country to be free and had friends from many different backgrounds. After finishing school, Oliver started learning about rules and laws at a big school in BE city. But when his country was invaded by another army, he quickly went back to his hometown, MO town.\n\nIn MO town, he joined a group of young people who were against the unfair rule. Later in the same year, he joined another group who were also against the unfair rule. During this time, people noticed that Oliver was very smart and knew a lot of things. He started helping with important work in many places where his group had set up their bases. There are some papers that tell us about what he did in the year 1941. But sadly, the original book and a special badge he got are lost. We only have his travel card and two more books from many years later. \n\nDuring the last days of the war, Oliver got a special badge for being very brave. But there was a mix-up with the numbers on the badge and the certificate. After the war, Oliver started working for a department that dealt with other countries. He got two more special badges for his good work and for bringing people together. Luckily, this time both the badges and their certificates were kept safe. A long time ago, a man named Oliver went on many adventures. He started his journey as a helper in FR country. Later, he moved to different places like BU city and then to FI country. During his time in BU city, he saw a big change happening. He saw one man, named Isaac, trying to hide in a big house, but sadly, Isaac couldn't escape. \n\nOliver also spent time in PA city and NE city, but we don't have any pictures or letters from that time. After many years of traveling, Oliver returned home and became a helper in his home country's big meeting place. He was very good at his job, and he got a silver medal for his work. \n\nHe continued to do this job for many years and also got to travel to other places like AL country and again to FI country. He had many special books that remembered his time in these places. In the end, Oliver got a golden medal for his wonderful work. But we only have the box and the papers for this medal, the medal itself is missing. This item doesn't have a number on it, so it should be easy to swap without causing any problems. Oliver was really good at speaking many languages. He could even speak some less common languages very well, like FI country. In fact, he was the first to change FI country poems and stories into another language. He was also very good at speaking AL country, and even helped two important people understand each other by translating for them. Here is a picture of Oliver with these two people, and two others: Here he is with his wife Victoria, who also changed poems and stories from one language to another. Oliver passed away in a city in the 90s. Victoria passed away much later. \n\nHere is a small picture of a special award with the wrong year (1882) on it. \n\nThank you, Adam. Yes, it's a little strange, and we all know that people who like to collect things love strange things. \n\nThanks, everyone! The thought that the date might have been mixed up with that of a white bird has been mentioned on another website, and right now, I think that's the best guess.\nHello friends! A friend from IT country found a small picture of an order with a wrong year on it. It says 1882 instead of 1883. Have you seen this before? Do you know why this could happen? Thank you! David\n\nHas anyone bought from this website before? David was talking to Markus about this. David said that he was only talking about orders and medals from a place far away. He doesn't know much about other places. He thinks people like Rusty and Samuel know more. The website is in a place near here, but David doesn't know where they get their special orders from. The website sells both real and pretend orders which isn't good. But David thinks if you buy things from this place you should be okay. He doesn't think you would get something different than what you see in the picture, or something broken, or nothing at all. The prices are higher on this website than on a big website where people sell things. It might be 20% more expensive. David has seen other places that sell things that are not as good but are still expensive. If you like special things and don't want to go to a big sale, you might like to shop here. This shop is run by a man named David. I've never ordered from his website, so I can't tell you how quickly he answers questions, but I think you can trust him.\n\nThere are different kinds of bravery awards from a place called YO country. A person named Adam replied to a discussion started by a person named Patrick. Adam doesn't like a seller who breaks up sets of documents and awards. He says it's sad because once they're sold separately, no one can put them back together. He thinks the seller could make the same money, or even more, by selling the sets all together.\n\nThere's a special medal from 1941 that people talk about. Adam replied to another person's discussion. He said that the person has a good collection of 50 medals. Adam has some of these, but he doesn't have the awards that go with them. He mentioned a common problem where sellers break up sets of papers and awards. He talked about a medal that a person named Ethan showed. Adam thinks it's real. He thinks the screw was attached at some point for some reason, and the marks on the left side are from being held tightly in a tool.\nDavid was talking about a special kind of medal. He said that usually, boys and girls have different ways to wear it. Boys use a light-blue triangle to hold it, and girls use a light-blue ribbon. He wasn't sure why they were different.\n\nDavid also talked about a box that held another kind of medal. He said the long or sharp ends of the medal sometimes poked the inside of the box to make room. He didn't think the ends were made shorter later on because the cut would be easy to see. He wasn't sure why the ends were different lengths.\n\nDavid once had another medal that was almost the same as the one above, but its end was much longer. He didn't know why it was like that. He saw this kind of thing sometimes with other medals. He thought it might not be very comfy to wear on the chest.\n\nDavid began to show more interest in these medals on a date in the late 2010s.\nGood job, friends. Talking about special numbers and giving out prizes, I want to show you a special badge with papers from my collection. It has the special number 15284 and was given out long ago to a man from SL country, we'll call him Benjamin. Luckily, we have more papers that tell us about this man, which doesn't happen often with prizes from SL country. The badge came with his paper saying he's done being a soldier: Benjamin was born in spring, a long time ago (so what else could he become if not a helper?), in a small village. He was a farmer. He joined the helpers on a fall day, when he was 18 years old. He helped until a spring day, leaving as a helper leader and with a thank you gift of 5,000 dinars. Later, he was in a place in SL country. Here he joined a club for people who used to be soldiers, and because of this we can see his picture: He kept being a member until a year not too long ago... Besides this, I can only add that I have my grandpa's paper (sadly the paper only, the badge is lost), saying that he got his badge on a fall day, order number 48447. A collector mentioned an order 93k given out long ago. As we know, prizes from SL country were not given out in a certain order, so without a paper showing the exact year, it's hard to guess... A long time ago, people thought the years around the late 20th century were important. In a country called YU land, there were shiny decorations that people talked about. One friend, named Adam, asked others about a special decoration he found on an online shop. He was curious about many things, not just how it was made. He said hello to his friend, Benjamin.\n\nIn YU land, there was also a special golden badge given to people who teach others how to use parachutes. Adam was chatting with his friend Cameron about this. Cameron thought there might be a connection between when the silver badges and golden badges were made. He wondered if the quality of the badges started to go down when they started making the golden ones in the late 20th century. He thought it would be exciting if they found out that they stopped making the silver badges before they started making the golden ones. Maybe this was true?\n\nThey were all part of a club for people who liked military things. This club was on a website made by a group called IV community.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "fe5464729c092f944fa06b577a872c84f742bd7e7c7f1f38d46dadc4dbe62cc1"}

Around 100 friends came together against unkindness at the old town building in SM town for two days. \n\nMadison, a big kid at school, told everyone that she planned the gathering on a sunny day with the help of picture sharing. At the meeting, people listened to Madison and other friends talk about their times facing unkindness in the country.\n\n\"It's really nice to have this chance to bring so many friends together and stand for something I care about a lot,\" Madison said.\n\nKatherine, another big kid at the same school, came to the gathering with her friend Emma, who is learning at the UN school. Katherine said she was sad that no helpers in blue had come to the event to talk with the friends.\n\nEven though she was sad, she said that she gets strong seeing friends from different places and ways of life show they care for being kind to everyone. \"Seeing friends here who are different from me, it makes me happy -- just to know that someone is with us,\" Katherine said.\n\nKatherine and Emma said they are both from HO town, where a big man's goodbye ceremony was held this week. Emma said she was inspired by the kind words she heard from the leaders who spoke at the big man's goodbye.\n\"Seeing people helping each other is really great, but it's important that they really mean it,\" said Ryan. \nThere have been many gatherings in SM city, arranged by students at a big school. These gatherings were because of two people, Fiona and Gabriel, who were hurt by police in different places. \nOn a day near the end of May, a group of students at the school had a rally near the courthouse in SM city. Also, a lot of people showed up for rallies in the area over a couple of days. \nEarlier this week, there was another rally.

{"text": "A doctor named Joseph found that a big website, much like a big library, was not sharing all kinds of information fairly. Instead, it seemed to favor stories that talked about medicines and shots that make a lot of money. \n\nJoseph was surprised when many of his most liked stories about health and wellness disappeared from the big website one day. He realized that his stories, which often talked about ways to stay healthy without needing medicines or shots, were not showing up anymore.\n\nHe noticed that the big website, which was now like a big medicine company, was changing the results people got when they looked up something. For example, if someone looked up \"sore joints,\" they would not find helpful stories like the one Joseph wrote long ago. Instead, they would find stories that talked about medicines and shots as the only way to feel better.\n\nJoseph shared a video on his own website to explain this. In the video, he said that some websites that the big website liked were owned by a big money company. This money company also owned a company that sold unhealthy food and smoking items. It seemed like the big website was choosing these websites over ones like Joseph's website.\n\"Once, there was a big website for health information. Many people trusted it. But, one day, a doctor named Dr. Matthew found out something surprising. The website was telling everyone who took a certain test that they were very sad and needed to talk to their doctor. This test was created by a big medicine company. It turns out, the test wasn't real, it was only a way to make people buy more medicine.\n\nThere was also a new kind of gel for boo-boos. This gel was special because it was made from silver and other plants like rosemary and cinnamon. It was made with only rain water from the TE state and power from the sun. There were no bad chemicals in it.\n\nSadly, the website's test was not really about helping people. It was just a way to make them buy more medicine. \n\nAnother big website, like the health website, also only cared about making money. In the year when little kids go to first grade, this website worked with a big group to make a test just like the health website's test. This test also tried to make people buy medicine for being very sad.\"\n\"David says that a big company, let's call it GB company, likes to share information about medicine. Surprisingly, GB company also puts ads for happy pills on a health website, making people think they are just what the doctor told them to get. These ads come from GB company and make GB company a lot of money.\n\nThere's another health website, let's call it HL website, owned by a company that also promotes fast food home delivery. When people search for health topics on GB company, these two health websites often show up first. They make a lot of money for GB company because they use GB company's ad service.\n\nDavid explains that these two health websites, even though they promote some unhealthy choices, show up first in search results because they use GB company's ads. When people visit these websites, GB company makes more money from ads.\n\nIf you look closely at GB company's rules, you'll see that this is not what they're supposed to do. But it seems like GB company is not following its own rules anymore. They are only interested in making more money.\"\nThis is about a big company that isn't always good.

It's for all types of people who want to learn more, including those who love playing with light, building things, and exploring maps. \n\nIn this version of the book, we keep the important stuff that helps us understand how we can use light to see things from far away. We talk about how light can bounce off things, how we can use special tools to see far away, and how we process what we see. We also talk about how we can use what we see to take care of the Earth.\n\nWe've added some new information to this book too! We talk about how we can use this way of seeing far away in cool jobs like treasure hunting and studying dry places. We also talk about a new topic called \"GNSS\", which is a fancy way of saying we use special tools in the sky to help us see things from far away.\n\nThis book is for everyone! If you're just starting to learn about seeing things from far away, this book will help you understand the basics. If you're already an expert, this book can help you learn even more! And if you're a teacher looking for more resources, we've included a list of places you can go to find more information. This book is like a one-window shop where you can learn all the basic things about the subject. Mr. Gabriel started his research work at a big science institute in a city called MU. Later, he moved to another science center in AH city in 1973. There, he created special tools for watching Earth, which were the first of its kind in his country. He was the head of this center from 1994 to 1998. He also helped a lot in planning and doing activities related to watching Earth from space for a big space organization. He was a part of many big groups in his country and around the world. One of them was a big photography and sensing society where he was the president from 1996 to 2000. He was also the head of a space science and technology education center in Asia and the Pacific, which is part of the UN, from 2006 to 2009. He is a member of many science groups and has won many awards, including a big one in 1999 for his amazing work in remote sensing in his country. You can learn more about him on a website.\n\nMr. Jack has been working in the area of studying Earth and space since 1993. He has a lot of experience in teaching and doing research. He started his science work at a remote sensing service center in 1993 and worked there until 1996. Then, he moved to another remote sensing institute and worked there until 2008. After that, he worked at a university in the UK from 2008 to 2011. Our friend 'Adam' loves to help make learning things easier for everyone. He worked on some really cool programs that help us understand our world better. He even made some computer programs that are used by big organizations. He became a teacher at a big school in IN country in 2011. He likes to study about nature, how plants grow, and how we can make better decisions using maps. He got some big awards for his work too! \n\nWe can learn about a lot of exciting things like:\n1. How light travels\n2. Basics of how we measure light\n3. Understanding what makes things look the way they do\n4. An overview of tools that help us see things from far away\n5. Tools that help us see things in different light\n6. Tools that help us see things using waves\n7. Different places from where we can see things\n8. How we get and use the data we collect\n9. Using this data to manage our resources\n10.

{"text": "A big energy company, we'll call it \"GE\", was given permission to sell an important power line to another city. This was a big step in a plan to stop using their huge coal plant in ND. GE, which is second in providing electricity in MN, is selling their plant to a company we'll call \"RE\". The sale still needs one more approval because things have changed a little bit.\n\nRecently, GE shared that they want to build a big wind farm near their power plant. This might help people worry less about the power line being used for coal. GE also will take care of the long power line for 20 years, which is twice as long as they first said.\n\nOne man, let's call him Jack, who works for a big group in MN, said that building a wind farm is a big deal. The big group all agreed to let RE have the power line after RE promised they had enough money to clean things up if the power line stops working.\n\nLast year, GE said they would close their big coal plant -- the biggest one in ND -- because they want to use more wind and natural gas. GE said their coal plant was losing so much money that they couldn't even sell it for $1.\nThe NE state helped save a very important area for digging and power making called Coal Creek. A company named Great River got many offers for Coal Creek and a power line. They decided to sell them to Rainbow for a lot of money. Great River is a company that sells power to many other smaller companies that give power to many people. Rainbow, which is part of a company in Bismarck, sells electricity to all parts of the US and has been doing so for a long time. They've run power plants but never owned one.\n\n\"Rainbow really wants to make this deal happen,\" said Rainbow's boss, Ryan. But he has to wait until at least May for the smaller power companies to decide.\n\nOnly one of the smaller power companies did not want to sell last year: a big company named Connexus. But many people complained about the sale, saying they did not know enough about it. \n\nMore people complained when changes were made to the Coal Creek deal. A new wind farm near the power plant makes the power line deal seem even better for Rainbow, said a customer named Samuel. \"We paid for a [power] line, but now it's being sold for a lot less money, and the price will keep going down.\"\nThe group that makes rules doesn't have as much control over deals made by co-ops as it does over deals made by big companies.\nSome people who are part of the co-op and others who want clean energy in our state think the deal is not good. They think the power line is being sold for too little money. They are also worried because the power line will keep carrying power made by burning coal, which is not good for the planet.\nThe new owners of the power line have a plan to cut down on how much they harm the planet. They want to catch the bad stuff that comes out when they burn coal and put it under the ground. But this plan will cost a lot of money and it might not work because it's a new idea.\nThe old owners will keep buying most of the power made at the coal plant until early in the next few years. After that, for eight years, they will buy about one-third of the power made at the coal plant.\nThe old owners and the new owners of the power line have agreed to let a new wind farm use some of the power line's ability to carry power. The wind farm is planned to be built near the coal plant and should start working by the end of a few years from now.\nThe old owners didn't say much about the wind farm, like where it will be. But it might be in the same place where the coal plant is, which is funny because of all the problems there have been with the coal plant in the past couple of years.\nA big river had a plan. They wanted to stop using the Coal Creek and make a big wind power project instead. But their plan changed. Why? Because the place where the power plant is, said no to new wind farms. They did this because they wanted to keep the coal plant. This plant gives jobs to many people. More than 240 people work at the plant and over 400 people at the coal mine nearby.\nNow, people know that the coal plant will stay. So, the place might say yes to wind farms again.\n\"We will work with everyone to start using more wind power,\" said LE, who works for the place. \"We were waiting for this to be done. I will talk with people who make wind power next week.\"\nMH writes about energy and other things for a newspaper. He has been working there since 2010. Before that, he worked at different newspapers in other cities.\nm@newspaper.com 612-673-7003\nThree planes from AU country brought food, water, medicine, and phone stuff to TO country on Saturday. TO country had a big water volcano and tsunami.\nAnother company that makes voting machines is saying that ML, the boss of a pillow company, said things that are not true - Business.\nA company from a big city made a rooftop setup in the VA country, which is exciting news for business. Some people are wondering why meat is so expensive in the US. They think maybe big companies, like the one that starts with C, are charging too much or maybe there's not enough to go around. This is important for farmers. A judge in the TX state said that workers don't have to get a vaccine, which is big news for business.

{"text": "There is a company called Z-Company that makes medicine. It uses money it borrowed, which is called debt, to grow bigger. But debt can be risky. If a company can't pay back the money it borrowed, it could be in big trouble. Sometimes, the company has to sell shares at a low price to get control of the debt. But not all companies that use debt have problems. It's important to look at a company's cash and debt together. \nZ-Company has a lot of debt. At the end of the winter season, Z-Company had a lot more debt than it did a year before. There's a big company that has a lot of money and owes some too. It has more money in the bank than it owes, so it's doing okay. \nThis company also makes a lot of medicine and it's important to keep an eye on how much money it has and how much it owes. It's like a big piggy bank. If the piggy bank has more money than what it owes, then it's all good. \nAlso, the company is making more money than before, which is really good. It's like if you get more allowance than before, you can buy more toys, right? But we still need to make sure the company can pay for the things it owes. Just like you have to make sure you have enough money to buy the toys you want. Let's talk about a company called 'Zachary's Helpers'. This company makes money and it's good to see how much it makes over time. \n\nCompanies need real money, not just numbers on paper, to pay their bills. Even though Zachary's Helpers has some money saved up, we should look at how good it is at turning its earnings into real cash. This tells us how fast it can grow its savings or use them up. In the last three years, Zachary's Helpers turned 22% of its earnings into cash, which is less than we'd hope for. This is not very good for paying off debts.\n\nInvestors might be worried about the company's bills, but the good news is that it has savings of ZH232.1m. Plus, it increased its earnings by 8.3% over the past year. So, we're not worried about Zachary's Helpers' bills. When looking at a company's money situation, it's good to start with its balance sheet. But not all risks can be seen there. Some risks are hidden and hard to find. Every company has these risks, and we've found 2 warning signs for Zachary's Helpers, one of which could be serious! It's good to think about businesses that don't owe money. We have a special list of these businesses, and they all have been making money. It doesn't cost anything to see this list.\nWhen you want to trade things like stocks, use a platform that many people think is the best. This platform lets you trade many things at a low cost.\nThis writing is just general advice. It's not telling you to buy or sell anything. It's important to think about what you want and what your money situation is. We try to give you information that will help you think long-term.

{"text": "My journey to become a long-distance swimmer: part 1\nI really like the ocean and enjoy swimming in it. A few years ago, I learned about a group of people who swim in the open water every Sunday in a place called HK city. The group was led by a man named Isaac. I tried to join them but I wasn't as fast as the others. This made me feel shy and I stopped going. Later, I learned about another group that swam on Saturdays, led by a man named Liam (now led by a man named Oliver), but I wasn't able to keep up with them either.\n\nI started looking for someone to teach me to swim better. I found out that the school I was going to, called HKU, had a program where they trained people to swim, bike, and run. They even had special classes for people who needed to get better at swimming. But, these classes weren't happening in the winter, and when they started again, they weren't at my school anymore, so I didn't join. Also, I wasn't fast enough to join the regular team. They needed people who could swim very fast.\n\nI finally took a class to become a better swimmer in the summer of 2016, but I still wasn't good enough to join the team. By then, I had finished my second time going to school at HKU and had moved away from the city. But, I eventually found a job back at HKU. This job would have been perfect for me to train with the team once a week on Tuesday evenings, which was good for people new to the team, but I still wasn't good enough at that time. I had a job that made me travel a lot and didn't let me exercise. This made me feel unhealthy after one year, so I stopped working there. Then, I took a break for a few months and found another job closer to my home. But, I couldn't find a good swimming club there, so I just swam by myself without any coach.\n\nDuring the summer, I thought I could join the B team of the weekend swimming group led by Oliver, even though I hadn't swam with them for 3 years. I was able to keep up with them, but I was still the slowest. But, this was good enough for me to join some of the triathlon training at the university.\n\nIn the fall, our weekend swimming group did a long swim. It was supposed to be 2.4 km, but they made it longer to 3 km without telling us first. I was able to finish it, but I was one of the last ones. Then, there was a big storm which changed the date of a big swimming race. I was not free on the original date, but I could join on the new date. This also gave me another month to train. I was excited and quickly joined a big race. I finished it too! \nAfter trying a new job that I didn't like, I decided to go back to my old job at a place we'll call \"HK University.\" I also moved closer to work to save time. The best part about working at \"HK University\" is that I get to use the sports areas for free. They even have two swimming pools, but they are very hot in the summer and very cold in the winter. \nI moved on a day in late October, got all my stuff ready, and started training with my team at the end of the month. I kept practicing with my team once or twice every week. \nAs the year was ending, I started thinking of doing something big. I set a goal for myself to train and be ready to swim a very long race before a time we'll call \"early 2020.\" \nMore of this story will come later. \nThis is a look back at a year we'll call \"Year 1.\"", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "98ad7ccea5710e08ba2196a33e9fe814a76b897d9f386d6281e42d798ce55cfe"}

He was very funny, could rap very fast, and was very good at interacting with the audience.\n\nBut David is not just good at acting and singing. He is also very good at dressing up in stylish clothes.\nDavid loves dressing up and playing with different styles. When he goes to big gatherings or appears on TV shows, he often wears clothes that are different from the usual grey suits. \nOne memorable time was when David went on a famous TV show in the middle of 2018. He wore a suit with many colors and patterns made by a famous designer, along with white shoes, patterned socks and a slim blue tie. Even though the suit had a lot of colors and patterns, David wore it in a fun and relaxed way.\nThe colorful suit David wore isn't made by the designer anymore. But if you want to add some fun colors and patterns to your clothes, there are many choices available. You can start with a pair of colorful earrings or choose pants with bright, wild prints.\nRemember to keep up with the latest styles, news, and people in the world of fashion. \nGreat outfits in fashion history.\nFun Clothes in History: Every Time Tim Wore a Mask Outside\nTim, a famous singer, has been making wearing masks seem fun for a while now.\nFun Clothes in History: Madison in Big Sleeves\nSome really fancy looks from a time long ago.\nFun Clothes in History: Jack's Much-Worn Green Coat\nThe person who wrote a famous drama has worn this special jacket many times.\nFun Clothes in History: The Matching Outfits of a Famous Singing Group\nThis is what stylish clothes looked like a while ago, shown in three different ways.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "f044ff8ff50feb74e3761257946a5574d46808e27bf307d6e61f83607f833289"}

This will help prevent a big argument about how much money the country owes. \nThey had a vote and most people agreed to let the country borrow money until the middle of March in the next year. This means the country can borrow more than the big amount it has already borrowed. \nSome people voted for it, like a man named Matthew.

{"text": "This story is about some friends who were part of a big group. They wanted to help other friends who were not being treated well at their work. This was happening in a place called JE city. \n\nOne day, some of the friends decided to stand with their other friends who were not being treated well. These friends worked for a big company and were not happy because the company wanted to send their jobs to faraway places. The friends were also upset because they were being asked to work in different cities for a long time. \n\nThe group of friends also invited a man named \"Flat Andy\" to visit their school. They invited him many times but he never came. So, they brought a picture of him to show what a good school they have. \n\nOne of the friends in the group also had a problem with how things were done at her work and decided to do something about it. She thought it was not fair and wanted to make things right.\nTeacher Charlotte\nCharlotte, a school teacher, was not happy with how her city was managing things. She thought it was not fair. So, she decided to do something about it. She wanted everyone to know, so she told the news about it. Some other people also talked about it. Come back to hear more about what's happening.\n\nTeacher Rachel's Story\nRachel was a strong teacher who believed in the power of working together. She thought they could face any challenge. But then, some changes happened. In WI state, a man named William took away some rights of the teachers. In CA state, a man named Henry said something wasn't fair for some students.\n\nRachel wished these things wouldn't happen in NE city, but she saw that they could. She saw two problems:\nThere was a rule that helped keep things fair when they were talking about work rules. It made sure that everything stayed the same until they agreed on a new plan. But, some people wanted to change this rule. Lots of people want the head of the state and the rule makers to change a certain rule. They think this rule makes it hard for groups to talk and agree on things. Right now, there is a plan to change the rule, but only a few people agree with it. Still, people keep asking for the change. \n\nThere are also some arguments about teachers' jobs. Two groups in NE city think that a rule protecting teachers' jobs stops students from learning well. These two groups have asked the court to look at this. \n\nWhat is happening with this? The group called N has used some money to support people who agree with them. They also want to talk to the rule makers. A judge named Patrick has allowed N to help defend the rule about teachers' jobs. Some people think that these groups won't win. But if they don't win, they will probably try to change the rules about teachers' jobs. \n\nWhat is the group G doing? For a long time, we've been taking part in important talks. Our team member, Jessica, has been our voice in a place we'll call \"AL city\". Michelle and Penelope have started many projects for our members in recent years. They also make friends with other groups and people in our community. As your leader, I've talked many times with our local helpers about things we care about as teachers.\n\nBut our group is nothing without our members. Our power depends on how much you show up when it comes to teacher issues. So, this year, we ask you to do at least one thing to let your voice be heard. You can find out about our \"Do One Thing\" project on a website. The future of our job and public schooling is very important, and we all have a part to play.\n\nThere's a report from the boss of another group about a big meeting.\nThe boss, Benjamin, spoke about the main idea of all the activities at a place we'll call \"LA city\". All the speakers were clever in linking the main idea to their talks. From the head of CA state, the mayor of LA city, a smart man named William, an actor named Cynthia, to the new boss of another group, Garcia, and many others, everyone was moved by the different ways they talked about the main idea. Rachel, a teacher's leader, talked to a big crowd about making things better for everyone in the country. She said some people with lots of money are not being nice to teachers and schools. This is making it hard for kids to learn and making it harder for everyone to have the same chances. Rachel thinks we should all work together to solve these problems. She said we should stand up for what is right and keep moving forward.\n\nThe crowd also had to talk about lots of ideas from teachers all over the country. They split into groups to talk about different things like school issues, helping each other, taking care of people, and making sure everyone is treated fairly.\n\nThey all agreed on some ideas about when teachers stop working. They talked about making sure older people can still get help from the country when they need it. They also talked about how to make sure this help keeps up with how much things cost. There was a big meeting where people talked a lot about how we learn at school. They had a long talk about the rules for learning. These rules are very important and can make learning better. But, the people at the meeting didn't like how the rules were made. They said there were too many tests and that the people who made the rules didn't ask teachers for their ideas. They also said that some people were trying to make money from the rules, which was not good for the kids. They came up with some good ideas to make things better and make sure the rules are all about helping the students learn. They said that the people who make the rules should do a better job.\n\nThey also talked about a man named Adam who had some ideas about school that they didn't like. They said his ideas were not good for teachers, schools, or students. They all agreed that he should stop being in charge. They stood up and said \"yes!\" together. This was their way of telling the people in charge that they didn't like what was happening at school.\n\nOne person said that this was one of the best meetings they had ever been to. They said everyone was smart, passionate, and respectful. They were very proud of all the people who came from all over the country to talk about how to make schools better. In 2014, there was a big meeting. This meeting happens every two years and is very important. Our friend, Sophia, went to this meeting in LA city. She was chosen to go there with two other people. The meeting lasted for five days. There was a lot to do and talk about, so they did not have much time to play. But Sophia said it was very interesting.\n\nAt the meeting, they talked about what they want to do for schools, people, and fairness. They argued about many things. The biggest argument was about a set of rules for schools. Many teachers think these rules are not good. They also think the way these rules were introduced was bad. They think linking these rules with tests is not good for learning. But they did not agree on how to fix these problems. Some people said to throw away these rules. Others said to make changes to these rules and deal with the problems separately. They had a long, excited, and sometimes silly debate. In the end, they decided to keep the promise of these rules.\nWe should stop using simple tests and instead use tests that match with what kids are learning;\nWe want to move away from too much testing and instead use a system that helps and improves;\nWe want to help teachers and schools make sure that those in charge do things right;\nWe want every state to have a group of teachers and other school professionals who can watch, check, and make the learning plans better;\nWe want to help teachers and schools to make sure that:\nteachers help make a plan to talk to and involve everyone;\nteachers play a big role in the ongoing creation, use, and improvement of the learning plans;\nthere is enough money from all levels of government to make sure the learning plans work well;\nWe want to start a big talk about the best way to measure what students learn and support teacher involvement in all parts of learning-related tests;\nWe want to make sure that the pause on big consequences of tests for students, teachers and schools goes on until all the important parts of a fair, standards-based system are in place.\nThere was also a long decision made to develop \"help-and-improve\" models to take the place of the current \"test-and-punish\" systems; another to support tests that are right for young learners; and another to change high-stakes testing. A decision against standardized tests for students getting special education services was sent to the Big Council for more study.\nThere was a big gathering I attended where people from different teacher groups had a lot of discussions. These groups included the one from CH city and the one from NE city. It was clear that these two groups play a big role in guiding the direction of the big teacher group. Some people, who were not at the gathering, talked about it online. They felt that there were still hard feelings after the elections and that the NE city group might have too much power over the big teacher group.\n\nLater, I went to another meeting in AL city. Here, we talked about who the teacher group should support in upcoming elections. Deciding this isn't easy, and there are a lot of steps. Four different groups share their ideas: the group that knows about laws, the group that knows about politics from each part of the state, the group that directs the big teacher group, and the local leaders of the big teacher group, which includes me. Some decisions had already been made before we got there. For example, we already knew that the big teacher group was not going to support anyone in the big leader's election. We weren't sure who made this decision, but it was clear from a previous meeting in May that supporting Andrew would have been hard for the local teacher groups, and there wouldn't have been much support for the other candidate, Rob. Some people were not happy because they thought that the big group should have supported two people who wanted to be leaders. But when the leaders from a place called LI asked for more talks about this, they were given reasons which made some of them okay, but others were still not happy because they didn't know enough about how the decision was made.\n\nThe other groups wanted to support the team called Democrats, especially in a place where there might be more Democrats this year. But some local leaders from LI thought that the team called Republicans was better for them. They thought this because Republicans seemed to help their cities more with money, and these leaders had good friendships with their Republican leaders. They felt that they were helping their Republican leaders understand their problems. They didn't always get their way, but at least they didn't have to support other people just because they were Democrats.\n\nTwo weeks after a big meeting, three people went to another big meeting to think about who they should support. In a big meeting, a group called \"NY group\" wanted many people to come so they could talk about important things. People thought the \"AF group\" would choose Cameron for the big leader role. But, some people talked before the meeting and decided it wasn't a good idea. So, they didn't talk about it in the meeting. In the \"AF group\", lots of smaller groups can say what they think, but the people at the meeting make the final choice. This made the meeting very long because they had to talk about many different choices.\n\nI was happy to go to all three meetings for the \"GN group\". I'll share a list of the \"NY group\" and \"AF group\" choices for all the important roles with our group members soon.\n\nThe \"GN group\" had a big meeting at the \"NE State\" big leader meeting. On a Wednesday, the \"GN group\", along with parents, kids, and other teachers went to the meeting in the \"ME city\" to tell people that they won't forget what happens. They're fighting to get back control of public schools, get back control of the \"NE State\", and tell Cameron that they've had enough!\n\nThat same Wednesday was a special day for the \"GN group\". All over our area, our members wore their pretty blue \"GN group\" shirts to show that they love public schools in the \"Great Neck\". Thank you, \"SO Middle School\"!\nA group of people were working hard to make changes to some rules. They held a big meeting in NE city, and lots of teachers came to share their thoughts. There were 3 special guests at the meeting - Adam, Michelle, and Lily. They were there to talk about a new idea called the \"Taxpayer and Bill\". This idea was about changing some old rules.\n\nThomas, who used to be an important person in FR country, led the meeting. He introduced some people who had lots of things to say about the new idea. One of these people, Ethan, explained some things about the old rules and why they thought the new idea was good. Another person, Matthew, said that the new idea would make it easier for the people in charge to change some agreements.\n\nAfter they finished talking, others in the meeting shared their thoughts too. Some people didn't agree with what had been said. Many people didn't like the new rule that was being talked about. They asked questions and said that what the group was saying was not true. A man named Matthew from the crowd was asked to join the group. Matthew talked well, gave real facts, and answered those who liked the new rule. As it got later, the group couldn't give good answers about how the rule would help.\n\nIt was clear the rule wanted to take away the rights of workers. Many teachers and other workers were at the meeting. They kept telling a man named Adam to work on other things instead of this rule. They also asked Adam to try to get more money back to their city to lower taxes. At first, the meeting was in favor of the rule, but as more and more people talked, they gave good ideas that didn't take away worker's rights. This shows the power of people sticking together and that teachers need to keep speaking up.\n\nAbout 3000 teachers, parents, and bosses said hello to the leader at a big dinner in HO city on a spring day. A big boss tried to stop a big gathering by asking for a meeting with the person who planned it, a man named Tony. Tony said no and the big boss had to walk past lots of people shouting because they were tired of his ideas about school. Some people from a group were there too: Jeff, Michelle, Luci, Jodi, Sheila, Bill, and Andrew with his whole family!\n\nShare Your Thoughts\nYou can follow the group on a place where you can share short messages for the newest news and things that matter to you:\nChanges and talks\nActions to make a difference\nThe battle to make school better\nWearing Blue to Show Love for School\nMany people in the group wore blue on a Monday to show they agreed with two big groups' Day of Action to make school better. It was a day to talk about:\nFair help for schools and places to learn\nA three-year break from big tests\nA focus on teaching and learning, not just tests\nHere are some pictures from different schools!\n\nTime for a Change\nOn a day in late November, our group all agreed to join others in New York to ask for a big school boss to leave. It's clear that he doesn't listen to the worries of parents, teachers, students and school bosses about tests and privacy in New York.\nLots of people gathered in a place called CE town. They came from many places, including LI island, to show that they all agree on something very important. They wanted to help the teachers in CE town get a fair agreement about their work and pay. They didn't want the teachers to get less money in the future. Some important people were there too, like Adam from AFT and David from NYSUT, and they talked about how important this is for schools.\n\nThere were also people who supported the teachers at the CE town school.\n\nThere was also some talk about rules, money help, budgets, and summer scholarships. The teachers from GN city were there too.\n\nYou could contact them by email at g@teachersmail.com or on social media.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "e345a5bcbffdfa675ce53bc08434e6d8b63cddbb84ed16fa8e28b0c9dc74053b"}

This map can help us guess where we might find new animals and plants. They wrote about this in a science book.\n\nThere are special places, like big forests in some countries, where we might find lots of new things. These places are very important for us to look at.\n\nBut the world is changing very fast, and some animals and plants might not be there anymore before we even know about them.

They looked at where these animals live, what kind of places they like, when they were found, and what they are like. This helped them guess where and what kinds of new animals might be found.\n\n\"It's important to find all the different kinds of living things on Earth. This helps us take better care of them,\" says a teacher named Matthew.

They give us clean water, help plants grow, and make the soil good for growing things.\n\nNature also helps keep the Earth from getting too hot. For example, big forests take in a gas that could make the Earth warm up.\n\nMany people's jobs depend on nature. If we lose too many kinds of plants and animals, people who work with food, trees, and nature tourism could lose a lot of money. \n\nThis story was first told at a big meeting about the world's economy.

{"text": "There's a group called CCMA that helps solve problems between workers and their bosses. They usually work in the SA country, but sometimes they can help even if the work happens in other places. For example, there was a man named Matthew who worked for a travel company in the LE city. He had some problems at work and asked the CCMA for help. The CCMA said they could help, but the travel company didn't think so because Matthew was working in LE city, not SA country.\n\nSo, they asked a bigger court to decide. The bigger court said that it doesn't matter where Matthew was working. What matters is whether the work in LE city is part of the work that the travel company does in SA country. If it is, then the CCMA can help. So, it's not always about where the work happens, but more about who the work is for.\nMr. Matthew had a job in the big city, but the people who gave him the job were in JO city. He got his pay in a special kind of coins and worked with special machines. But when he said he was not treated nicely at work, he could still ask for help from the right place. \n\nThe important thing was not where Matthew worked, but whether his office was really different from the one in JO city. \n\nThe people who gave him his job were in JO city, and they could give jobs to people in the big city too. This means Matthew's office in the big city was not really different, it was part of the one in JO city. \n\nSo, if Matthew thinks he was not treated nicely at work, the right place can help him. \n\nPeople who give jobs in other places should remember this. If their offices in other places are just like the one in JO city, they should follow the same rules for all their workers, no matter where they are. They should always be nice to their workers.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "3aa38da3c1a40f3045dd3f67151f41cd83db2720effa20f3ea21d432f5603878"}
{"text": "There was a big event where a man named Kevin had a tough job. Some people didn't like what he was doing and said mean things about him. Kevin used to be a teacher and once helped a student who was in a tricky situation. He told the student to be safe, which made some people upset. Then, a man named Justin from a big place that takes care of schools tried to help by saying good things about Kevin.\nKevin, a 24-year-old man, had a chat with a student named Benjamin. People from different groups admired Kevin's leadership. Even William, a leader from another group, chose Kevin for a special team. Kevin's good work earned him praise from many school groups. \n\nYears later, Kevin looked back and thought about how he could have done things differently. He wished he had asked for more details and talked to people who knew more about health and laws. He said that teachers back then didn't have much help or training for these situations. Kevin thinks all teachers should be ready to handle any situation. He hopes the big school office could do more to train teachers. \n\nBut not everyone is happy with Kevin, who works in a big school office. Some people still have reasons to not like him. And the people who support Kevin are asked to understand his past actions when he was a teacher, saying he didn't have enough training or guidance. But, they know if someone from another group had done the same thing, they would have been very upset.\nThere was a man named Benjamin who made a mistake when he was 24 years old, right after he finished school. This is not a big deal. Everyone makes mistakes, especially when they are young and just starting their careers. But some people are being unkind to Benjamin because he is different. He likes boys instead of girls. That's not a good reason to be unkind to someone. Benjamin has helped many kids who are also different. He has done a great job and it's not nice to be mean to him because of one mistake.\n\nBenjamin didn't tell the people in charge about his mistake. Maybe he was worried they wouldn't understand or they would be mean to him. That's not fair. People should be understanding and kind, no matter who you are or who you like.\n\nSometimes, people say you have to believe certain things or support certain ideas just because you are different. Like, if you like boys instead of girls, you have to support some ideas that might not be good for everyone. That's not right. Everyone should be allowed to have their own ideas and beliefs, no matter who they are or who they like.\nI was upset when someone said that because I liked boys, I had to agree with bad choices. Now, I'm hearing that I must support a person who didn't protect a child because I like boys. It's hard for me to understand this. How can we say we're good people when we act this way? Kevin is not someone I can support.\n\nThen, someone else said, \"While you are right, you shouldn't complain about how others talk or write.\"\n\nAnother person named Alice said, \"According to a trusted source, Kevin's lawyer said in a letter that the child was old enough to make their own choices. This matches what Kevin wrote in his book.\" And that was all Alice had to say on the matter.\n\nA third person, named Matthew, agreed with Alice. He said everyone is missing the main point. The child was old enough to make their own choices, so no rules were broken. He doesn't understand why people keep saying the child was too young.\nOn a certain day, Benjamin shared his thoughts about a teacher who did something very wrong. He was upset because this teacher did not help a student who was in trouble. Benjamin believed the teacher should have done more. He thought the teacher should not be allowed to teach anymore because he did not make good choices.\n\nBenjamin has friends and family who are different from him, but he knows that doesn't matter. What matters is how you behave and treat others. He thinks it's important for everyone to do the right thing.\n\nThen, Samuel shared his feelings. He thought Benjamin's words were not nice and asked him to say sorry. If not, people might not like their blog anymore.\n\nThere was also news about a man's wife who kept sharing videos of herself singing in unusual places, even though no one asked her to.\n\nMore information was shared about a lady who does not like certain performers.

{"text": "In a special room, we're talking about five big groups who are making big changes in how people see a certain plant. This plant was once seen as very bad, but that wasn't really true. Some people used to tell stories that weren't true about this plant to little children. \n\nBut now, things have changed. In some places, it's okay to use this plant and in some places, it's not so bad to use it. Lots of groups are now working with this plant and making really cool things with it. People who were once taught that this plant was bad, including their teachers, can now enjoy it in many different ways.\n\nWe still have a long way to go before everyone sees this plant as normal, but we can see that people are thinking differently about it. Here are some groups who've made cool things with this plant:\n\nThere's a special oil, made for people to take care of themselves. It's made from stuff found in nature, including a bit from this plant. There's a new way to introduce little ones to the world of pretend play. These tiny pretend \"Island Minis\" are just right for small hands. They might remind you of tiny pretend snacks. \n\nA company called Higgs makes these pretend playsets. They are very colorful and cool, like something you might see in a fun cartoon from the 80s. Higgs has two pretend playsets -- Black and White. Each set comes with six pretend items and a little pretend adventure. The Black set is for pretend quiet, peaceful, and happy play, while the White set is for pretend energetic, excited, and focused play. It's a \"choose your own adventure\" kind of thing. \n\nThere's also something called \"Kin Slips\" for those who don't like pretend smoking. These are pretend treats you can place under your tongue for a fun, make-believe experience. They are made from pretend ingredients, and are very easy to play with. Just put the pretend treat under your tongue, wait, and let the imaginary fun begin! Pretend play can be even more fun when you use your imagination in this way. Some snacks like sweet treats can change when eaten and not give you the same good feeling. There is a company that sells four kinds of fun snacks for people who want different things: Sky Zoom, Drift Away, Park Joy, and Close Eyes. We think Drift Away is good -- it helps you relax after a long day of playing. They taste yummy, work fast in just a little time, and are very sneaky if you need to hide them.\n\n\"I know a lot about science,\" says the boss of a special snack company, Mr. Jack. \"I learned a lot about nature and how things work at big schools in CA and CO.\"\nYes, that's true: a fun snack company started by a science man. The company, called Special Treat, sells yummy things like snacks mixed with milk chocolate, dark chocolate, green tea chocolate, salty nut, and coffee crunch. Each snack has a lot of fun in one chocolate bar size. This year, Special Treat started selling small, chewy snacks mixed with a little fun in each bite.\n\"Everyone gets to pick their own fun journey,\" shares Dr. Oliver, \"We're also famous for our yummy chocolates, made by our food team leader, Thomas. He's a great cook who has worked in kitchens all around the world.\"\nThis story was first shared by a friend at his email. Our pal, Matthew, said a lot of things we liked, so we're sharing his words. We're saying thank you to him -- hope that's alright.\nHow to Make Things Smooth Below Your Tummy: Shared With a Dad\nIf you're thinking about cleaning up where your swimsuit covers -- this story we worked on with a dad might make you say yuck -- and teach you the right things.\nHOW TO TAKE CARE OF SKIN & SHAVE FOR BOYS\nTaking care of skin and shaving can sometimes be hard for boys.

{"text": "What Do You Need to Make Hip Hop Music?\nby Ralph Heibutzki\n\nHip hop music makers love to find different sounds to make their music special. \n\nMaking hip hop music and using technology go hand in hand. The easy access to technology lets anyone make really good music from their own home. Even though hip hop is usually focused on strong beats, the use of digital recording and sampling lets music makers try new ways of making songs without losing the fast-paced lyrics that fans love.\n\nDigital Music Making Programs\nDigital music making programs let music makers create songs without needing to go to an expensive music studio. One of the popular choices is a program that lets music makers like our friend Liam download small parts of songs and special sounds from files on a laptop computer. In just a few minutes, the music maker can use the program to make a beat, and then add any other sounds or effects they want on top of it.\n\nDrums and Machines\nHip hop music became popular around the same time as programmable drum machines like the LM-1, and Roland TR-808. These machines made the unique beats that you can hear in some of the early classic hip hop albums. There are cool machines that make sounds and music. Some of these machines can make sounds longer or shorter, or even make sounds that people can't. They can also make different sounds at different times, which is really fun!\n\nOne fun machine is a big box with lots of buttons and knobs. You can make sounds with it alone, or you can connect it to a computer. On the computer, you can make the sounds ready for everyone to hear. But sometimes, this big box can't put the sounds on a CD, so you need another machine for that.\n\nIn the middle of the 1980s, a new machine came that could remember parts of songs that people liked. Depending on the machine, you could listen to these parts on a keyboard, a special music machine, or the machine that remembered the songs. This machine also lets you make different sounds and effects for each part of the song you want to use in your own song.\n\nHip hop music is all about the beat. It changed how people think about music. Instead of just using guitars, bass, and drums, hip hop uses machines to make sounds like bass lines, brass parts, and even strings. People who like the sounds from the 1970s and 1980s like to use old machines, like the Casio and DX7. To make modern sounds, you need special machines called digital synthesizers. These machines can also be used like small libraries of sounds and work spaces. \n\nThere's a story about the history of drum machines. Drum machines are machines that can make different drum sounds. \n\nThere's a guy who can write a popular song really fast. \n\nThere are also guides on how to choose a recorder for your home and how to make hip hop beats. \n\nA man named Ralph wrote articles about music and he went to a big university. He also wrote about what you need to make hip hop music. Ralph talks about the tools a music maker needs for hip hop songs. He also tells us about different jobs in music and film. There are jobs like music maker, sound helper, and movie maker. We also learn about what these jobs do and how much money they can make in a year.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "2cedc34ed892cf2a18027558757a6f02f2238259a6d3f5d7c57f849e3434eb6d"}
{"text": "Two good friends, Benjamin and Cameron, love to make country music. They grew up in a far-off part of CA country, where they only had three music records: one from a jolly man, one from two singing brothers, and one from a man named Ricky. Now, they are making their own music and Ricky even helped them make a new version of their song \"Single Man\" that sounds like the music they grew up listening to!\n\n\"Single Man\" is now a bluegrass song, which is a special kind of music they always liked. Benjamin told a music magazine, \"We were always around this kind of music when we were growing up. Ricky was our hero because of the records our parents had. When our town got a radio station, I was a DJ for a show that played this kind of music. Not long ago, Cameron and I asked some of our friends and the best musicians in NE city to play their best on our new song. Recording this new version of 'Single Man' felt really natural for us. When it was time to make sure everything sounded just right, Ricky was there to help us. It was really great.\" This is a story about a man who likes to have fun. He enjoys staying up late and doesn't worry about spending money. He doesn't have to ask anyone when he makes plans. But, there's one thing he doesn't understand - why would anyone choose anything over your sweet kiss? Why would anyone prefer a bright night over a peaceful one with you? He doesn't know why someone would choose to stay young forever instead of growing old with you. He doesn't know any man who wouldn't want what he has. Every time you enter a room, all the other guys look at you.

This is really good news. \nA man named Matthew wrote this on a winter day. \nEven though everyone's worried about the sickness, there's something really important: the number of sick people has dropped a lot in the past six weeks.

{"text": "A big group of churches in the US, including UCC, are all pitching in to help a far away country, the CH country, by sending them things doctors and nurses need to stay safe. These things are important because there is a sickness going around that started in a city called Wuhan. \n\nThere is another group in the CH country, the Amity Foundation, that is working with its government to make sure these things are going to where they are needed the most. \n\nThe sickness from Wuhan can make people have a bad cough, feel very hot, and have trouble breathing. In really bad cases, it can make people's organs stop working. The sickness is caused by a virus, which means medicines like antibiotics and flu shots can't stop it.\n\nSadly, over 100 people have not been able to get better from this virus and more than 4,600 people have gotten sick from it in the CH country. Most of these people are from Wuhan and the cities around it, but there are other cities where lots of people can't leave their homes because of the virus. News tells us that people working in a hospital in the HB area are finding it hard to help all the patients because they don't have enough things they need. Many more helpers have been sent to the area from another part of the big country.\n\nDavid mentioned that a lady named Sophia, who works for a big helping group, asked for help from a big group of churches in AM city. They all decided to work together to send important medical things that are needed very much.\n\n\"Two big boxes of medical things are being sent to Sophia's group,\" David said. \"Different church groups are giving money to help. They've given $15,000 and they have collected almost $100,000.\"\n\nSophia says that they need medical masks, clothes, and glasses the most. There aren't enough of these things in the big country and other parts of the world are also starting to need more.\n\nEven though other church groups in North AM city might be sending things on their own, some are working together with the big group of churches, including a big church group in AM city and a big church group in the CA country.\n\n\"The situation is very serious,\" said David. \"We hope that with lots of people working hard to help with the medical needs in the big country, the sickness won't spread and become a big problem all over the world.\" But if things get worse in other places, they will need more help too.\"\n\"We would be so happy if you could help,\" Henry wrote. \"Hoping things will get better soon.\"", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "294b5b9f6d43dd7a3ed1183bacdc1603df8bdcb3ccab7a2515bc32554c2e1fae"}
{"text": "Some people in the city are starting to like electric cars. They are learning that these cars are not just for showing off. Here's our list of the top ten best electric cars. \n\nIf you drive an electric car in a big city, it can help you save a lot of money. You can save as much as what you need to buy a slightly used small car. \n\nNot everyone knows this yet, but more and more people are understanding that electric cars are good. They are not just for people who want to show off.\n\nElectric cars are special because you don't have to pay some road fees and parking is free in many places. They also cost less to insure, and you don't have to spend money on gas. You can charge them at home for very little money.\n\nKeeping all this in mind, we want to share our thoughts on which electric cars are the best to buy. So, let's start our list of top ten electric cars. We will start with the one that is not the best, the TO car.\n\nThe first car on our list is a car that isn't only an electric car. It uses gas that is not good for the environment to power an engine, but it also has an electric motor that can work on its own.\nThe Prius is a very unique car. Some people say it looks like a triangle on wheels! It's made this way so it can move smoothly through the air. But, its unusual shape might not be liked by everyone.\n\nThe Prius has lots of cool features. It has power steering and air-conditioning to make the ride comfortable. It has stability control to keep the car steady. Some models even have a special screen that shows your speed on the windshield!\n\nThe Prius also has a plug-in option. It can run like a regular car, but it's also an electric car. This kind of car may not be as fast as some other cars, but it's not slow either. It might take a bit longer to speed up because of its big battery, but it still does a good job.\nA special car can go up to 62mph when using electricity, but it can't go very far. The older version of the car could only go about 1.2 miles at 30mph when using electricity. This new version can go 12.5 miles, but that's not very far either. So, you might need to use the gas engine after all.\nThis new car won't be ready to buy until next year. It might cost about 30,000. The car company is testing about 600 of these cars all over the world. You can check the company's website to learn more.\nIs this a good car to buy? The older model is a great car, but this new one has some problems. It can't go very far on electricity and it's quite expensive. We'll have to wait and see when it comes out next year.\nThis car got a 2 out of 5 rating. \nThere are 9 other electric cars that are better than this one. Click 'Continue' to see them.\nIf you spend 50 each week on gas and pay the usual taxes and fees, this car may not be the best choice. \nAnother famous electric car is very popular in a big city. This car has been around for nearly five years, helping the world by not making any pollution. Some people really like it, and some don't, but more and more people are starting to use it.\n\nThe folks who thought up this car didn't make it very pretty. In fact, it might be one of the least pretty cars to have four wheels. It seems like they were so focused on how it looked that they forgot to make it safe. The car isn't very strong, and it doesn't meet the safety rules that other cars have to follow. Because of this, it's called a \"four-wheeled motorcycle.\" Be careful if you decide to get in one.\n\nEven though this car uses fancy technology to move, it doesn't have a lot of extra features. It does have a music player that can play CDs and MP3s, and you can even listen to digital radio. You can choose to have air cooling, but it might not be a good idea because it uses a lot of the car's power. That's pretty much all it has, so if you like cars with a lot of tech, this might not be the one for you.\n\nIf you like fast cars, this one might not be for you either. It's not very quick. It works okay on city streets -- it can go up to 51 miles per hour -- but if you're around faster cars, you might feel a bit worried. The car isn't as strong as even a small lawnmower.\nThis car isn't the best for long drives, but it's okay for short trips in the city. You can drive up to 70 miles before you need to charge it again. Charging it takes about as long as your bedtime sleep using a regular plug at your house.\nThe car with the special battery is ready to be bought, but it's very expensive. The special battery makes it cost much more than the regular car.\nIf you don't mind people making fun of you, or being pushed around by bigger cars, or if you have a lot of money to spend on a tiny car, then you can buy this one. If not, maybe you should look at other cars.\nThere is a company that has been making cars that you charge with electricity for a while now. Their best-selling car has room for four people, but they have to be really good at squeezing into small spaces. They say it's the perfect car for going to work, going shopping, and driving your kids to school.\nThis car is more nice-looking than the first one we talked about. Even though it's not the prettiest, it has extra seats in the back. That means you can fit more stuff or more people in it.\nThere's a machine that can play both music from the air and from special music disks. You can also pay a little bit more to have other fun stuff. There's a better music player that can play different types of music disks and even let you plug in your music player. \n\nThen there's a funny-looking machine that's not as fast as some others. It can go about 60 miles before it needs to be charged again, which can take a long time. But, it's not too expensive compared to others. In fact, it's the least expensive one we're talking about. \n\nIf you're looking for a not-too-expensive machine that can carry a few people, you might want to think about this one. But, you'll need to use it a lot before it starts to save you money. \n\nThere's another machine that's a bit odd. It only uses electricity to move, but it's not like the usual electric machines. The power comes from a battery that can be charged in different ways.\nThe car called \"Adam\" looks nice. It's not like the other cars that look like a strange triangle shape. Instead, it's strong and cool. We don't know about the 'tears' coming from the lights, but overall, \"Adam\" looks bold but not too different.\n\nInside \"Adam\", there's a lot of cool stuff. It has two video screens that tell you everything you need to know about the car. One screen is behind the steering wheel and tells you all the same things as the normal car dials. The other one is a touch-screen that can show you lots of different things, like your music.\n\nWhen you charge \"Adam\" for a little while, it can run without using any gas for up to a short trip. After that, it will start using gas to keep the battery charged. It can go a very long way before you need to charge it again.\n\nEven though \"Adam\" has a big battery and a big engine, it's still very fast. It can go from standing still to fast in just a little bit of time and can go really fast if you let it.\nIn 2012, a new car called the Ampera will be available. This car is very special because it can go up to 40 miles using only electric power. This makes it a good choice for those who want an electric car but also want to be able to drive long distances.\n\nThere's another special car called the \"Evie\". This car was made by a group of people in the UK who took a regular car, took out the insides, and put in an electric motor and batteries. This made it the first electric car in the UK that can fit four people.\n\nThe \"Evie\" looks like a normal car, which is good because some people don't like the strange look of some electric cars. Even though it's not the most advanced car out there, it has some nice features. For example, it has electric windows, doors that lock themselves, and brakes that won't lock up. The car is safe with strong doors, special seat belts, and locks on the back doors. It also has places to put a child's seat. There's a music system that can play songs from the radio or CDs.\n\nThe car is good for an electric car. It can go fast or slow, depending on where you are driving. It can go really fast if the people inside aren't too heavy. The car uses a special battery that you can charge in just 6 hours.\n\nBut, this car with all these features isn't cheap. You can buy it now, but it costs a lot of money.\n\nSome people might think it's too expensive. But if you spend a lot of money on fuel every month, this car can save you money over time.\n\nThere's a special car that's perfect to change from using fuel to electricity. The company that makes it knows this, and they've been making a new version of this car for a few years.\n\nThis new version looks strange, but no stranger than the many other cars of the same type you see on the streets. There's a car everyone knows about. It doesn't matter if it uses gas or electricity, people won't look at it strangely. Some people might like that it's so common, others might not, but everyone agrees that it's not ugly. \n\nInside this car, called the Smart fortwo ED, there aren't a lot of fun things. It has a system that lets you listen to the radio, and you can even play a CD with songs on it. But that's all when it comes to things that make you comfortable.\n\nPeople sometimes worry about small cars not being safe, so the makers of the Smart fortwo ED have made sure it's very safe. It has all the safety things that a regular car using gas has, like controls to keep it stable, brakes that work really well, two safety bags, and seat belts that fit just right.\n\nThe Smart fortwo ED can go a long way before it needs to be recharged. It can travel up to 68 miles and go as fast as 75mph. Like the best electric cars that cost a lot, it takes about 8 hours to recharge this car because it uses special batteries.\n\nThe Smart fortwo ED has been tested for a while now in the UK. If you live in the LE city, you might have seen some being used by the city police, and some others being tested by companies and writers.\nThere's a special car that you can't buy yet. But you can ask to try it if you talk to the company. This might be the least expensive way to try an electric car. When this small car is finally available, it might cost around 20,000.\n\nAnother company gives its cars really cool names. They've made a fast race car and a tough truck. When they said they were making an electric car, we thought it would have a name like 'Super Robot' or 'Super Zap'. But they named it the iMiEV.\n\nThe iMiEV looks like it's from the future. If you like cars that are friendly and quiet, you might like it more than other small cars because it can fit four grown-ups comfortably.\n\nThe iMiEV website mentions a 'driver's footwell'. That's where you put your feet and the pedals are. You can also rest your feet there if you don't want to stick your legs out the window.\n\nThe car has other things too, like a system to keep you from sliding, points to attach a baby seat, a special brake system, a digital speed meter, and airbags on the side to keep you safe if there's an accident.\nThere is a funny looking car that can go fast and far. It uses a type of battery that lasts a long time. It can go 80 miles before it needs to be charged again. Charging is easy, you just need to plug it into a normal plug at home for about 6 hours. \nThis car is only available in JP country and HK city. It is quite expensive, but if you have a lot of money and plan to keep the car for a long time, it might be worth thinking about. \nThere is another car that is getting a lot of attention. It is special because it doesn't create any pollution and has a lot of cool features. The company that makes it is very famous. \nBut, this car isn't very pretty. It looks like a large, strange animal with wheels. Some people say it's because of the way it's built to move smoothly through the air, but that doesn't mean it has to look that way.\nThe Leaf is a wonderful car filled with cool technology. It can send messages to your phone when it's full of electricity from a charging station. It also has a special map that can find the nearest charging station when the battery is low. Plus, it has many safety features, like brakes that won't lock up, airbags, and something to help the car stay steady.\n\nThe Leaf is a fast car and can go 90 miles per hour. It can go 100 miles before needing more electricity. The battery takes about 8 hours to fill up at home, but there are special places that can do it in just 25 minutes.\n\nIn the UK, the Leaf costs a lot of money, but the government will pay some of it, so you have to pay less. People in the US pay less for it. You can buy it from the second month of 2013.\n\nThe Leaf is one of the best electric cars. If you have a lot of money, you should buy one. But if you don't, it might be a good idea to wait until it's cheaper.\nThe car company, known as 'B company', is taking the issue of changing weather very seriously. Unlike some other car makers, 'B company' has decided to make changes. They have taken the gasoline engine out of one of their most well-known small cars and replaced it with batteries and a motor to make it run on electricity.\n\nThis small electric car, called 'M car', looks good from all sides. 'B company' has put some funny stickers on the top, sides, front, and back of the car, but even with these, it still looks better than other funny-looking cars.\n\nBut the 'M car' is not as spacious as its friends. 'B company' has taken out the back seats and put a battery pack in their place. They think this makes the car go further and faster than other cars.\n\nAs far as we know, the 'M car' is the only one in this group to have large 16-inch metal wheels, so it should win by default. The wheels have pressure sensors to let you know if a tire is flat or if the tire pressure is too low for the best electric drive. The car also has air cooling, very bright headlights, and a music player.\n\nThe car also has lots of safety features. It has control to keep it stable and airbags, just like the usual small car from 'B company'.\nThere is a cool car called the Mini E. This car is special because it has a big battery and can go really fast. It can go up to 95 miles per hour! Also, it can travel 155 miles if everything is perfect, and 104 miles in normal situations. Charging this car takes about 4.5 hours, which is quicker than many other cars.\nRight now, you can't buy the Mini E, but it's tested often. They tested it for six months starting from the start of the school year in 2010. We don't know how much it will cost yet.\nWhen it's ready to buy, we think the Mini E will be one of the best electric cars you can get. There might be some changes needed, like where the battery is (so you can have more friends in the car), but everything else seems great.\nThere was another car, the Roadster, that people didn't think would work. How could a small company make an electric car that looked good, could travel far, and was faster than a very fast car? It was hard, but they did it.\nThe Roadster is a beautiful car. Some people think it's a lot like another car, the Lotus Elise. But the people who made the Roadster say that only a small part of it is like the Lotus Elise. Imagine you have a car named Elise and you want to change it into a car called Tesla. You would only keep a few parts like the front window, the part in front of the driver, and the safety cushions. You would also keep parts to help the car move and a removable roof.\nThe Tesla car has lots of cool things. It has a big screen in the middle that tells you about the car and lets you change things. It can tell you when to power up the car when it's cheaper at night and show you how much money you saved by using an electric car.\nThis car also has safety things like the safety cushions and brakes that work slowly. It also has a music player that can play CDs and MP3s. You can even play music from your phone without any wires.\nThe Tesla car is the fastest and strongest electric car you can get. It can go up to 125 miles per hour, which may not seem fast for a sports car, but it can go from 0 to 62 miles per hour very quickly.\nEven though it's so fast, it doesn't run out of power quickly. It has a big power storage made of 6,800 little power cells that let it go 236 miles before it needs to power up again. But powering up the car can take a long time. Using the regular power connector takes 6 hours, but you can make it 4 hours if you have a special home connector.\nThe toy car called \"TR car\" is not a cheap toy. The basic toy car costs a lot of pocket money, and the \"TR Sporty Car\" -- a bit faster, with bendy wheels and special tires -- costs even more pocket money. You can get them now.\nThe \"TR Car\" needs a lot of pocket money, but toy cars that go as fast usually need even more pocket money to get and keep. If you're looking for a fast toy car that needs less pocket money to keep and play than a little toy car, the \"TR Car\" is our favorite. \nLet's talk about: The top ten battery-powered toy cars.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "4b65f1b299480925bfd89ba46ed4c78ba4f27c8d27ff8658f528bdc7cc3f159d"}
{"text": "A man named Jonathan has been talking a lot about something called \"two sets of plates\". It's not a hard idea to understand, but since it's a new way to think about Church history, Jonathan did a lot of learning and thinking about it. He also talked to smart people to make sure he was right.\nRight now, Jonathan likes this topic a lot because it helps answer many questions about Church history.\nPeople who read his blogs know that this is important. The \"two sets of plates\" idea helps us understand what two men named Joseph and Oliver said about something called Cumorah.\nJonathan started learning about Church history from a time long ago, and then worked his way back to the very beginning. He has shared his learning in blogs, books, and talks.\nHe wrote a book to answer many questions that people have been asking him. The book is called \"What happened to the Golden Plates?\" and it's about as thick as your hand. Most people seem to like books that size. This book has many little notes. I made less notes in the book to make it shorter and cheaper, but you can find more stuff on the computer like the book says. \nYou can look at some pages on a website that sells books. The pages you can look at tell you why I made this book. \nWhy I Made this Book\nI made this book to tell you about a cool new thing I found out about Church history. People always thought that Jack got one box of special metal pages from a hill. But I think that Jack actually got two boxes: one box had shorter stories by Matthew and Michael, which Jack read in HP town, and the other box had the little pages of Nathan, which Jack read in FN city.\nIf this is right, it can help us understand things about Church history that seemed odd or weird.\nWe can't just believe everything we hear without thinking about it. But the things I'll talk about in this book make some hard-to-explain stories make sense and answer big questions we still wonder about today. Questions like:\n\"Where did Jack get Nathan's metal pages?\"\nImagine that there were two treasure chests filled with golden pieces. Some people believe there was only one chest. But what if there were two? This idea might seem strange at first. People might laugh or disagree. But after some time, they might start to believe it too. This simple idea can help us understand many things better. This page talks about a special book and some interesting pictures. If you already understand it, that's great! But if you're curious like me, let's learn more together. There's a great story I want to share with you.\n\nA long time ago, a paper was written about the first picture of two friends named Oliver and David. This paper was shared in a big book of stories. You can also find this paper on a website.\n\nThe paper is really good for anyone who wants to learn more about Oliver and David's story. The first time the picture was shown was in a book that came out during a special time of the year. \n\nIn the picture, there is an important detail. In the top right corner, there is an angel showing something special to three friends. This is how the friends first told the story. Later, David mentioned that there was a table with interesting things on it. I talk more about this in my own book called \"What Happened to the Special Things?\"\n\nYou can see the pictures in the book by going to a website.\nJack's story about the visit of a special messenger is quite short. Jack shares that the messenger told him about many things from old stories. After that, he says \"The messenger told me more things that I can't talk about here.\"\n\nThis story comes from a big book of history. You can find the book online. I've always wondered why Jack couldn't share more about what the messenger told him. Perhaps Jack and his helpers didn't have enough time. Maybe they wanted to give a better explanation later.\n\nBut I think the main reason Jack didn't share more is that Oliver already told us everything. In a few letters, Oliver gave us the most detailed explanation we have of what the messenger taught Jack.\nIn a special letter, Oliver tells us about a very special visitor from the sky. Oliver says that he can't describe the visitor perfectly, but he tries his best. The visitor from the sky talks about many important things.\nIn another letter, Oliver says that he had a hard time describing the visitor. The visitor had said things about gathering IS city which Oliver didn't understand fully. But Oliver promises that he will tell us more about this in his next letter.\nIn his next letter, Oliver keeps his promise. He tells us more about the message from the sky. He may not use the exact same words, but he makes sure to tell us all the important things.\nOliver then talks about many things that the visitor told him. He explains it all in his own way. One interesting thing he shares is about how IS city will come. He says that no place on earth will be left unvisited because just like the Lord has sent them to every corner of the earth, he will show his mercy in their gathering as he did in their scattering, until they are gathered according to the promise.\nAdam shared some important words from a book with his friend. He said, \"I told our friend everything I learned from the special book.\"\n\nA long time ago, when David and his friends started making their own book, Adam's letters were already well known. They were shared in a newsletter a few years ago. David's friends wrote them down in their book--the same book they were working on.\n\nI believe David wrote his book thinking about Adam's letters. When he talked about the important words from the book, I think he was adding to what Adam wrote, not changing it. David's book should be read with Adam's letters.\n\nIn one of his letters, Adam explained how he wrote:\n\n\"I might have mixed up some things, but the main idea is there, and you [he was writing to Benjamin] will find many other important words that support the subject of the good news and the gathering.\"\n\nWhen we understand that the teacher taught David about all the important words Adam included, other parts of our history make more sense. Other writers including Benjamin, Patrick, and Thomas were known for talking a lot about the old important words, but they learned everything from the teacher, who taught these things to David before David even got the special book.\nOur friend Oliver was sharing something very important. He said, \"Telling everyone about a long talk with a very special messenger is not easy. We need help to do this. And there's one more thing about seeing things in a special way. We can learn so much, even about deep things, when we are shown them. We can understand a lot in just a short time. But some people, who take all their life to learn a little, might not believe us.\"\n\nI believe Oliver was talking about something he had experienced. He and his friend had a special moment when they were baptized. As soon as they came out of the water, they felt very happy and blessed. Right after Oliver was baptized, he felt very inspired and shared things that would happen soon. The same thing happened to his friend when he was baptized by Oliver. He also felt inspired and shared things about the future of their group and many other things. We felt very happy and joyful. Our minds were clear, and we started to understand stories that used to confuse us. We learned what these stories really meant, and it was like seeing them in a new light.\n\nIn a letter, our friend Oliver shared more about this:\n\"Imagine that while we were talking about all these wonderful things, our friend could see and understand even more than I can write down. Writing can share a lot of amazing truths, but it's not the same as seeing and hearing things for yourself. If we knew everything, we'd find out that we only know a little bit, like knowing the alphabet but not all the words.\"\n\nSome people say Oliver talks too much and uses big words. I don't think so. I'm happy he shared more about what our friend told Joseph. There are some fun details that I will share later.\n\nAs I've talked about before on this blog, many people have not paid attention to the seventh letter because it makes them think about where the Book of Mormon took place. Some people don't believe what Oliver said. But as time goes on, more and more people might start to look at Oliver's letters again. They might find out that it was actually Moroni who made the rules for understanding the big book to explain the gathering of IS city and other things.\n\nThe special page at the start of the book is very important for understanding that Joseph read two separate sets of plates.\n\nFirst, it was the last page of the set of plates Joseph read in a peaceful place. If the small plates of Nephi were in that set of plates, Joseph would have read the small plates before leaving the peaceful place.\n\nSecond, the special page only talks about summaries and Moroni's final words. It doesn't say anything about the first writings of Nephi and his followers.\n\nThird, Joseph said the special page was part of the \"first big book,\" meaning the plates that Moroni put in the stone-and-cement box. We don't have the \"first\" big book, partly because we don't have the 116 pages (Book of Lehi) and partly because we do have the small plates of Nephi.\n\nThe two biggest talks about the special page that I know of are from David and Alan. Even though they talk a lot about the special page, neither one seems to have thought about the 3 points I mentioned above.\nJack was talking about a very old book. He said, \"The last page of this old book was translated word for word. It's not written like most old writings. It's not something that me or any other person from today could write. A lot of people are confused about this, so I'm going to tell you what's written on the last page of the English version of this old book. It's the same as the last page of the original old book.\" \nPeople don't really talk about what Jack meant by \"the original old book.\" As far as I know, nobody has ever really talked about this before, but I'm sure someone has. \nSamuel once wrote a helpful piece called \"Jack in Harmony.\" This was shared for everyone to read in connection with a special place. There's a helpful picture of a map and some interesting drawings on a website. A man named Jack wrote a helpful story about how long it took a man named Joseph to write a very important book. This story was shared a long time ago on the same website.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "103b22f16f0ff6f36e88081ab51325a46d66ab9a65872230511af8ba9730b2d5"}
{"text": "In a big city, there was a very special car from a movie that everyone loved. This car could do something amazing - it could pretend to travel through time! People of all ages knew about this car and the movie it came from.\n\nBut the car was more than just a prop in a movie. It was a star in its own right. People didn't just remember the actors in the movie, they remembered the car too.\n\nAfter many years, fans of the movie got a surprise. They could finally own a piece of their favorite movie! A company said they would make shoes just like the ones from the movie. And then, they heard that the actual car from the movie was being sold.\n\nThis wasn't just any car. It was one of the original cars used in the movie. There were only a few of these cars ever made, and only three are still around today.\n\nOne of these cars was sold to someone very lucky. Money from the sale was given to a big group that helps find a cure for a sickness. The car was sold for a lot of money, showing just how much people loved the movie and the car.\nIn the third movie, a special car was given new parts and a stronger engine. It was taken care of by someone for eight years, and now it looks like the picture above. There's also a fun car from a famous movie that you can buy. There are other interesting cars too, like an old but fast car, a very rare car, and a car from a funny movie.

{"text": "In a place called the \"NO area\", marked in green, there are many wolves. The big people there have decided to give more money to those who can find wolf fur. They are doing this to help the caribou, which is a type of deer, because there are fewer of them now. This is happening in a place called \"WE area\" and some other places too. \nThe big people said that they will start giving more money right away. The people who can find the wolf fur in the special green area will get a lot of money for each wolf. This is more than what they got before.\nIf the wolf fur is very good, they will get even more money. This has been happening since a long time ago to help the people there and to stop the deer from going away.\nThe big people also said that the place where they are giving more money is where the caribou like to stay in winter. They expect to find many wolves there because the wolves like to follow the deer.\nTwo groups of deer called caribou have been getting smaller over time. If more wolves are caught in the area where these caribou live, it might help the caribou numbers to grow again. This also means that more hunters might be successful in catching wolves.\n\nIn a month when the weather is warm, some people from the government talked to older and younger folks, and groups of native people to learn why they weren't catching wolves as much as before. They found out that it costs a lot to get the things they need and travel to the places where the caribou and wolves live.\n\nNot long after that, they found out that the numbers of caribou in both groups had gotten even smaller. The bodies of the wolves that are caught will be looked at to learn more about them, said the people from the government. The fur from the wolves can be sold by the person who caught them.\n\nPeople who want to catch wolves have to sign in at a special place before they start hunting, said the government people. These special places are at GL lake and WE town, and maybe at GA town too, depending on where the caribou can be found in the winter.\n\nThe government people also said that if someone catches a wolf, they have to bring it to one of these special places. They will get a note that they can trade in for money at a government office in NS city or BE town.\n\"Hunters can choose to either bring the wolf back for fur getting ready or leave it with the patrol team. The team will then take care of the fur and keep the wolf safe until it can be moved for checking and learning more about it,\" the team said. Only hunters who live here can get the new $900 prize for a wolf.\n\nHunting is not allowed\nThe team also said that the new prize area is in the same place as the Caribou Protection Area, where hunters are not allowed to hunt caribou.\n\n\"The patrol team will teach hunters more about the rules at the patrol stations and will also check the area more often to make sure everyone follows the rules,\" the team said.\n\nSamantha\nShe writes news stories about the South.

{"text": "This is a story about signs and feelings written by a person named L. It talks about seeing what's going to happen for other people and God, but only seeing what's happening now for themselves.\n\n\"Money can buy fun things and sometimes, it can make people feel embarrassed. People think of money as something used to pay for things or as a present. But when money is used to buy the love of a woman who gets paid for her company, it doesn't buy the embarrassment of the man paying her. This embarrassment makes the man want to hide, and he finds a great hiding place: money.\"\n\nA man named W wrote this in a book about a place called P.\n\nThe story of a man named H and his love song is very strong. It stands out in his strange story about getting married. His story is also a message for all people, and for us. It takes us into the night and beyond.\n\n\"Soon, I will make her fall in love with me. I will guide her to a quiet place and speak kindly to her... On that day,\" says the Lord, \"you will call me 'my husband'; you won't call me 'my boss' any more (...) On that day, I will make a promise to them. I will make a deal with the animals in the fields, the birds in the sky (...) I will make you my wife forever,\" (Words from H, 2,14-19).\nThere was a time when everyone was kind to each other, not like a boss and worker, but like friends. Even animals and the earth were part of this kindness. But this kindness was like a flower growing in a rocky place. Sometimes, when we only look for happy things, we miss the real story. We can only see the true beauty of life when we see both the happy and sad parts. Just like how the morning sun is beautiful because it follows a dark night. The most beautiful rainbow can only be seen when the sky is filled with dark clouds. If we try to read a happy story without understanding its sad parts, we miss out on its true beauty. This is like a story of a husband and wife who keep making the same mistakes. They keep needing to find each other again and again. The meeting with the husband is like a break between going away and coming back, between doing something wrong and making it right. This is a story about how people in families - moms, dads, daughters, sons, and friends - show love to each other. Sometimes, we might see someone being unkind to someone they love, and it makes us feel sad. But we also know that everyone makes mistakes, and it's important to forgive and keep loving each other.\n\nIn our story, there's a man named Henry who is told to show love to his wife, even though she has made some mistakes. We're not sure if his wife is the same woman we learned about before, or if this is a different woman. Some people think that this woman might be his wife Grace, who had made some wrong choices. Maybe after Henry decided he didn't want to be with Grace anymore, she found a new friend, or had to work in a place she didn't like. Maybe she kept making the same mistakes. But no matter what, Henry was asked to keep showing her love. There was a man named Matthew who wrote a lot about love. He said it's hard to tell someone to love, especially when they have to love a certain person. He used a special word for love, one that means the love between a boy and a girl. But he didn't use another word that means love mixed with kindness.\n\nWhat's important is that Matthew keeps writing about his own experiences. There's a girl he has to love again even after she did some wrong things. This is a real story from his life, something that everyone knew about. But even as Matthew does these hard things, he doesn't understand why. He just does them. It's his friends and those who write after him who explain what Matthew's actions mean to us. While he does these things, he doesn't know much. He only understands the Voice telling him what to do, and then what he feels in his heart. In a book filled with stories, there are words from wise people who told us about what might happen in the future. They would say things like, \"Be kind to your friends...\" and we would understand that it meant, \"Love your friends just like the big, kind leader loves all of us, even when we don't always do the right thing.\" These wise people could tell us about what's going to happen to others and the big, kind leader, but they themselves only knew what was happening right now. That's why we can still learn from their old words today; they make us think about how important now is.\n\nThere's a part in the book where one of the wise people, let's call him Henry, had to do something big. The book tells us how much it cost him: \"So, I paid with some silver coins and grains\" (Book 3,2). It's like when another wise person, let's call him Jack, bought a field in JA city. When they tell us about the money and stuff they used, it feels like we're really part of their life. For people who work with money and deals, like me, it's really special to see a wise person talk about those things when they're doing something really, really important. In the big book many of us read, there are surprising stories that make us think differently. We often believe that promises and money can't express really important things. Instead, we like to show our feelings with gifts. This big book also talks a lot about gifts, especially when telling us about the creator of everything. But when it comes to important actions by people - like when a man bought a place to remember his wife or when a kind person helped a stranger - it doesn't talk about gifts. It talks about promises and money. This way, the big book keeps teaching us about life.\n\nThere was a man, let's call him Henry. Henry paid something (we're not sure if it was to a woman or maybe to her friend). What he paid was similar to the price of a worker, the money to free a woman who had to work because she owed money, or the cost of a special kind of woman. But here's where things get different again. In old times, men and women would use money in close relationships through a gift given before marriage or in a not-so-nice job. But here, we learn that Henry wasn't giving a pre-marriage gift. His payment seems to have a very special reason: he told the woman, \"You will stay with me for a long time; you can't do that not-so-nice job or be with any other man, and I will be the same with you.\" So, Henry gave the lady some money so she wouldn't do bad things. Money can do a lot of things, it can even help people make good or bad choices. That's why, a long time ago, people thought money was very powerful, almost like magic. But Henry did something different: he used his money to help the lady make a good choice. Just like Henry, there are other people, both boys and girls, who use their energy and money to help others make good choices too.\n\nHenry gave his lady money so she wouldn't do anything wrong with anyone, not even with Henry. And then, a long time ago, someone explained why Henry did this. They said, \"The people will live many days without a king or a prince, without giving gifts or special stones, without any magic items or idols\" (Henry 3,4). This person was thinking about a time when people had to leave their homes and go to a different place. And then they ended by saying: \"Afterward the people will come back and look for their God and their king. There was a time when people were very scared and sad. They had lost their homes and their leaders. They didn't have a place to pray or anyone to guide them. But during this hard time, they found new hope and faith. They learned to believe in kindness and love again. \n\nSometimes, after something really bad happens, we need time to heal and learn. We might have to let go of old things to make room for new ones. It's like going on a journey where we learn to be strong again. On this journey, we don't have a lot of things or a big home, but we can still find hope and hear the kind words of love again. Big buildings, both for prayer and other things, get filled up very fast with special objects. These objects can take up so much space that we can't hear the quiet voice of silence. If big troubles didn't come to break things once in a while, we would always be busy with God's things and never hear or listen to God himself. Lots of problems are not solved because we are too quick to start over. This takes away the time for quiet, for feeling free and empty.\nWithout these hard times, we wouldn't have our special book, we wouldn't remember the wise people and without its darkness, we would never see or follow a star, any star. In hard times, you learn about special days like Christmas.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "7a390817119449fb9d3ec9f61c696259c3964eec69a7486866ab65add83ecf72"}
{"text": "Let's Do Something New!\nWe are happy to tell you some big news! A special new way to help children who have certain health problems has been given the green light to start testing. This is all thanks to a group of people who have been working very hard for almost three years.\n\nIn 2018, a team of people started working with Kevin's Lab at a big children's hospital. They wanted to find a way to help children with these health problems. Now, after three years of hard work, they are ready to share their exciting news.\n\nThe big group that checks all the new health treatments in the US thinks this is very important. They know there are not many ways to help children with these health problems right now. So, in the 10th month of 2021, they said it was okay for this new test to start.\n\nThis great news could not have happened without help from a lot of people. For example, Gabriel at The J Place, Doctor Ben's Lab and Doctor Adam's Lab at The O University, and Doctor Cameron's Lab at AC Place. Also, a big thank you to AB Place for making everything needed for the test in time. The big health group in the US helped a lot to make this happen very fast. Big thanks to our friend, Dr. Madison, from NA Hospital for caring about our community. We also found a good friend in AT Inc., who helped us a lot. They gave us money to test our ideas and make new things. They also helped us in other ways that didn't involve money, but were important for us to do our work.\n\nWe are most thankful for our many friends who believe in our mission. They help families who are dealing with a hard disease. Without them, we couldn't make this big announcement.\n\nWe are working hard to find a way to stop a very rare sickness called SM. SM makes it hard for people to breathe and move. Not many people know about this disease, but that doesn't make it any easier for the families who are dealing with it. So, we are building a group of friends who want to learn more about SM and help find a cure.\n\nYou can learn more about this rare disease and meet the families who deal with it every day. We're spreading the word and raising money to support exciting research. Right now, people are studying a special kind of treatment called Gene Therapy. You can learn more about it and how we're helping.\n\nThere are many fun ways you can help us find a cure for these disorders.\nA group named SmashSMARD is happy to tell everyone that they are helping a research program. This program is done by a scientist named Katherine at a big research institute. This scientist and her team have a lot of experience studying brain diseases. They have done a great job in the past, and they've even helped to start some tests in hospitals.\n\nThanks to the help from SmashSMARD, Katherine is now using her knowledge to study a disease called SMARD. Her team is working on something called Gene Therapies. This is a way to help people who have problems with their nerves and muscles. They do this by making the body produce more of a certain protein.\n\nEveryone at SmashSMARD is excited about Katherine's work. They hope that it will lead to a hospital test for SMARD in the next few months.\n\nGene therapy is a way to fix or replace a gene that's not working right. This kind of treatment has already been tested in animals and it works well. There's even a video that shows how gene therapy helped mice at a big university.\n\nRight now, SmashSMARD is raising money to help with research for SMARD and two other diseases. Our small SMARD community is working hard to spread the word and do everything we can to find a treatment for these amazing kids as soon as possible. When a child is very sick, every day is a special day. We want to make sure these kids have lots and lots of special days in the future.\nFind Out More About the Study\nInformation on the Study\nEmail: s@study.org\nLocation: A street in LI town\nJoin our Email Group!\nOur study group is accepted as a non-profit group.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "72bd73f054cb6553792f954a243931acef9b0314682732158b237c3930b8b6d4"}

Recently, they had to change their lunch get-togethers. Instead of meeting every Thursday, they will meet only after their main meetings. These main meetings usually happen on the first and third Tuesdays of each month. The lunch time is still the same, from when the sun is highest in the sky until a little after lunchtime. \n\nEveryone who is part of the group and is on duty during the day can eat for free. Others are asked to give what they can to help pay for the food. They hope that more people will start to come to these lunches, so they can go back to having them every week. They are thankful for everyone understanding why they had to make this change. \n\nAfter their meeting on a day in May, the group leaders talked with a member about something important. There are also three members who can't join activities right now because they got hurt. They want to remember those who are no longer with them.\nOne sunny day, everyone in our club will always remember. It was the day of the FR country Cops & Kids Programs, with a big chicken farm as the main supporter. Our club is in charge of two big events every year, one for going back to school and one for Christmas. These events help us to get to know the children in our town better.\n\nWe also have a special program to help students. This started a long time ago and has become very successful. The first money-raising event for this program was a golf tournament at a local golf club. We held it to remember a brave police officer, named Nelson, who had a dog partner and who bravely fought sickness but sadly passed away.\n\nBecause the program was doing so well, a group of people came together to make it even better. They decided to let more people have the chance to benefit from it. Most of our club members and their families are given first choice. Also, all older students at our local schools are asked to be part of choosing who gets help.\n\nFor more details, check out the rules and how to apply.\nHelp the Nathan Henry memorial learning program with your gifts.

{"text": "Henry spent his young years in a small island and got his early education in a big city. Even though he would later write many books about mysteries, as a young boy, he liked magic shows more than studying spirits. If it wasn't for his interest in some very strange mysteries, like those written about by a man named Fredric, he might have only wanted to show that people who talk to spirits are not real, like a famous magician named Harry did.\n\nWhen Henry was 20, he moved to a big city in the US, where he lived for the rest of his life. At first, he worked as a writer, but he started to spend more and more time studying mysteries. In 1905, he joined a group that studied these mysteries.\n\nHenry met many people who said they could talk to spirits, like Margery, Eusapia, and Eileen. He also met a man named William. William was an interesting person because he had trouble speaking clearly, but when he said he was talking in the voice of a spirit, he spoke very clearly, even though he mostly whispered. A man thought he could hear ladies speaking in a squeaky voice. Often, the voices sounded just like the man himself, but sometimes they said things that seemed to come from a mysterious place. This strange ability made him feel like he could talk to people who were no longer with us. The man, whose name starts with 'W' so we'll call him William, seemed to change his voice a lot and say things that made others believe he had a special power.\n\nWilliam talked a lot about a famous lady named Eileen (but we'll call her Emma). He wrote a whole book about how he studied her. He said that even though there wasn't a lot of proof that she could talk to spirits, she somehow knew things that she shouldn't know. He thought that believing in spirits helped her find out these secrets.\n\nHe also thought that a person who thinks they can talk to spirits needs a special spirit friend to help them. Even if this spirit friend is just something they made up in their minds, it seems to help them say things that are true and accurate. According to Cameron's thoughts, the main difference between people who act differently at different times and those who talk to spirits is that the second group can know things they shouldn't normally know. He said that in the first case, it's like the mind is divided into parts, while in the second case, it's like they are talking to a different world and getting real messages from there.\n\nIn his talks with Ulysses, Emma's spirit friend, Cameron learned that Ulysses said he didn't control Emma's thoughts or change how she normally thinks. But when Emma was in a dream-like state, Ulysses said he could make her mind work like playing music on a piano. When Cameron asked why Ulysses, who said he lived in Asia before, could speak English so well, Ulysses answered that he couldn't speak English, but as a spirit, he could share his thoughts with Emma, who then spoke the words.\nCameron did a lot of thinking and studying about how some people can talk to spirits. He thought there was a special kind of energy that could change things around it. Sometimes, this energy could be seen and sometimes it couldn't. Cameron saw that the energy came from different parts of the person's body. He thought this energy was a special kind of power that we don't fully understand yet, but it's being looked at by smart people who study special things in nature. Cameron was sure this energy had something to do with the person's body and could be controlled by the person's mind or by a spirit that we can't see.\n\nCameron had a lot of experience studying people who could talk to spirits and places where spirits were said to live. But sometimes, even Cameron felt scared and confused by what he saw. One summer night, Cameron, his wife, Marie, and their five friends were allowed to stay in a spooky house about 50 miles away from NE city. Cameron wrote in his book that the people who were living there had to leave in the middle of summer. They couldn't sleep well and their helpers had left because they were scared of the spooky things happening in the house.\n\nCameron wanted to look around the house by himself before hearing any stories about it. They turned on all the lights in the house and began to explore. On the second floor, some of them felt something odd in one of the rooms, especially near an old piece of furniture. The man who lived there, who Cameron called Mr. X, told them that he and his wife had heard strange sounds from that room.\n\nThey walked down a hallway until they reached a door that led to the rooms where the helpers used to stay. Cameron opened the door, looked up, and saw that the top floor was all lit up and a steep set of stairs was in front of them. Cameron led the group up the stairs and they found themselves in a bunch of small rooms. Cameron turned quickly to the right. Suddenly, he felt like someone had hit him in the belly. His forehead started to sweat a lot, his head felt dizzy, and he found it hard to swallow. \"I felt really strange,\" he said, \"It was like my body was reacting to something. I had never felt anything like that before.\"\nHe was so scared that he wanted to run away, but he used all his willpower to stay where he was. His wife, just a step or two behind him, was talking about the \"nice little rooms,\" when she suddenly screamed. She turned around and ran down the stairs. Both of them were used to all kinds of strange happenings, but they had never felt so scared before.\nCameron went to his wife, who he found outside on the porch, taking deep breaths of fresh air. Then he went back to the rest of the group. Each person had felt the same scary feeling and had gone downstairs. They were sitting in chairs or leaning against walls, crying.\nCameron noticed that two friends of the person living in the house were there too. They didn't believe in strange happenings and had only come to the house because they were bored. Two friends felt the same as the rest of their group--they had a hard time swallowing, tears kept coming out of their eyes, and their foreheads were sweaty and cold. \nA dog that one friend had brought along didn't want to go upstairs no matter how much they tried to get it to. It growled, it wouldn't move its feet, and the hair on its back stood up. In short, Benjamin, as we'll call our friend, said the dog was acting just like dogs do when they are scared. \nMuch later, Benjamin took the group upstairs again. This time, everything felt normal, and none of them felt scared like before. The dog ran up the stairs, sniffed around, and acted like it usually does. Benjamin wanted to come back to the house with special tools to record and test things, but he wasn't allowed. Someone had told a newspaper about the scary house, and the person who owned the house didn't want any more people knowing about it.\nBenjamin stopped being part of a group that studied these strange things because he didn't agree with them about something. He started his own group to study these things in 1933. Henry and his wife worked together at their school, where they liked to learn about people like Emma who could speak to spirits. In a certain year, they moved their school to a place in SC state, where they kept learning about ghost stories and people who could talk to spirits. Henry wrote many books, such as a book about ghost tricks (1907); a book about your special powers and how to make them stronger (1920); and a book about special science and life after we pass away (1947). Henry passed away in the late 20th century in LA city.\nPeople who Study Spirit Talking Club", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "225b4b4cbedff6bbc64c17e341bef4a876d634a3c72ca014d711d6d20dc387af"}

{"text": "Story: Ryan's Powerful Car\nRyan has a fast and strong car. It's not perfect, but it's pretty cool. His car has four doors and is very strong. It's as strong as a superhero! It has a special machine inside that makes it go super fast. Some cars are simple and others are fancy, but Ryan's car is both! It's very special.\n\nHis car can do amazing things. It has special wheels that can go everywhere and it can go very fast. It can even fly a little bit off the ground! It's also very comfortable to ride in. You can have it as a big car or a small car. But the most fun is to drive the biggest one!\n\nThe car is so fast, it can go from standing still to running really fast in just a few seconds. The machine inside is very strong and works very well. It's not just about being fast. The car is also very good at pulling heavy things. And it's very special, because even the fastest cars don't have a machine as strong as this one.\nThere's a fast car called the ME car. It has a really strong engine that works with gasoline. The car can change gears nine times all by itself. It's pretty heavy and can go really, really fast in just a few seconds. But don't worry, you don't have to be a super-fast race car driver like Liam to make it go fast. Just push a special button and the car will zoom off like a rocket! It's very exciting and can make you feel a little nervous. But don't worry, the car is not too wild to use every day. You can drive it slowly and still have lots of fun. People will want to buy this car just because it has a super cool engine. But they might not like how it turns and moves because it's a bit different from the old ME car. The car rides pretty hard and even if you try different settings, you might still feel the bumps on the road.\nThere's a fast car that can do some cool things. If you choose Race mode, the car can do special tricks. There's a 'Drift' setting that lets the car slide around like a toy on wheels. It's really fun to drive this car on a racetrack because it's very powerful, but you can still control it easily. \n\nBut it's not as fun to drive this car on the road. You might wonder why this fast car isn't more exciting to drive, and why it doesn't feel as special as when you're on the racetrack. \n\nThe car's engine is very good, but the way it drives isn't perfect. The new model of this car is better in a lot of ways, but it's also missing something. It's exciting to drive, but it's not really exciting to drive on our roads yet.

Sometimes, we might send you emails about your account. Do you want an essay that's just for you? We can change this essay and make it completely unique.This passage contains programming code and technical terms that are not suitable for preschool children. As such, it cannot be rewritten in a simpler language appropriate for their cognitive level.\nTwo stories written by an author named Adam, talk about how people sometimes can be unkind to each other. Both stories, even though they happen at different times, show how unkindness can hurt a person. This is shown through where the story happens and the problems that come up. The stories show how groups of people can be mean to each other, just like in one story where girls and townspeople are not nice to the older women. This also happens in the other story where people at a company are not nice.\n\nIn both stories, some characters are blamed for things they didn't do. This shows how sometimes people can be unfair. At the end, two characters have to make big choices to show they are good people. This is a way the author shows how being in a group can make things hard for a person, and he does this through his characters and how they talk to each other.\n\nThe two stories also show how groups of people can become enemies. For example, in one story, the townspeople and young girls are not nice to the older women. A family named the Patricks are the main grown-ups who are not nice in the town. They are scared of what they don't understand, so they are scared of magic and why their babies are not surviving. Because of where they are in the group, they are scared, so they are not nice to the wise people of the group who are not scared. Kids sometimes don't get along with older people in their group. This is because the older people are the ones who tell them what they can and can't do. The kids use their imaginations to deal with this.\n\nIn a well-known story, there's a man named William who has a hard time getting along with others. William has different ideas about how things should be done, and this causes problems. In the story, William loses his job because his boss doesn't think his ideas are good anymore. William misses the old days when people were more friendly and respectful to each other. Now, he feels like no one knows him.\nHenry and William are talking about how sometimes things change and it's hard for people. Just like when you have an old toy and get a new one, the old toy doesn't seem as fun anymore.\n\nIn some stories, like \"The Big Argument\" and \"The Sad Salesman,\" there are times when people blame others for their problems. Sometimes, a lot of people blame one person for something bad that happens. \n\nFor example, in a town called SA town, people were scared of things they didn't understand. So, when bad things happened, like a pet pig getting sick or babies not being well, they blamed it on magic. They thought someone called Rebecca, and her friend Sarah were using magic to cause these problems. They were so scared of this magic that they even blamed a woman from a faraway place called BA land. They thought she was making magic happen too.\n\nIn another story, called \"The Sad Salesman\", a boy named Benjamin blames his dad, William, for not teaching him about the real world. Benjamin thinks William is trying to protect him too much and not letting him grow up. He learns about something bad William did and it makes him see his dad differently. This helps Benjamin understand more about who he is. The story tells us about a man named William who got in trouble because of wrong ideas he had in his head. These wrong ideas came from another man, named Willy. Sometimes, when lots of people blame someone for something, that person can feel very sad and alone. \n\nThere's also a story about a man who cared a lot about being good and honest. His name was Jack, and he was a hero. He cared so much about being good that he was willing to give up his life for it. Jack had to say he did something bad to save his wife. But, his wife lied to save him, and it ended up hurting them both. He believed in being honest and good, and this is why he died. He chose to die rather than let his family name be bad. Jack said he couldn't teach his children to be good if he wasn't good himself.\n\nThere was a man named Danforth who wanted Jack to say he did something bad. But Jack didn't want to do it because he wanted to keep his good name. A man named Patrick gave everything he had, but wanted to keep his own name. He didn't listen to what others thought he should do. Unlike Patrick, William did something very sad to try and help his family. Even though this was a sad choice, some people might still think of William as a hero because he was willing to give everything for his family.\n\nThere are two important stories that show how sometimes the world can be very hard on people. In both stories, people get hurt because the world is sometimes unfair. These stories show us how the world can sometimes be a tough place and how it can hurt people.\n\nWe feel very sad for William. In a story about William and his family, he tries very hard to do well and be a good dad. But things don't work out for him, and he ends up making a very sad choice. Some people think that only important or famous people can be heroes in sad stories. But the person who wrote the story about William thinks that anyone can be a hero in a sad story, even regular people like William. This is something that one of the characters in the story says too.\nWilliam is just like any other person, not someone very important. This means many kids, especially those who see parts of their own life in William's, can understand him better. So, it's easier for them to feel sorry for him. The bad guy in this story is not a person, but the world William lives in. Saying that William is always very upset, though, is not true. We never meet any of William's family in the story except for Ben, and he's just in William's thoughts, so we can't really trust him. It's not because of his family that William is the way he is, but as David says, it's because the world has worn him out. People used to think that being rich and successful was always good, but this story shows that it can sometimes hurt a person. This was a new idea when the story was first told, and some people didn't understand it. They even thought that William was very sick in his mind. They couldn't believe that someone could find problems with being rich and successful. \nIn the story, we feel sorry for William but we also feel bad for him and sometimes get upset with him. Some things he does are hard to understand, and he's not like the big heroes in other stories. There was a man named William who was not very successful or famous, but he still made people feel for him because he was always changing his mood, he got upset easily, and he couldn't see the truth about himself. \n\nFrom the start of the story, the writer shows us that William is very tired. He's losing his mind, but he doesn't want to admit it. His caring wife, Linda, tries to tell him that nothing bad is happening: \"Maybe you just need new glasses,\" she suggests, and \"Your mind is just too busy.\" \n\nIn the beginning, the writer talks about how hard life is through William's words: \"They put us in a box\" and how his house looks: \"big pointy shapes...all around it,\" which makes him feel alone. This is especially true since William is a small man, both in size and compared to everyone else. The writer is saying that it's not really William's fault, but the stress of trying to be successful and the unfairness of life that is making William lose his mind. He's stuck in a world where everyone thinks money and fancy things are the most important, and William really believes that if people like you, it means you're successful. So, his craziness is not something he was born with, but something created by the world he lives in.\n\nBut when we think about what William can do, it's hard to say. Some might say he's not very good at many things, which is very different from what we usually think a hero should be. A hero is usually very good at what they do. William's job doesn't go well and he loses it. His boss says, \"We don't have a place for you here.\" Even before losing his job, he wasn't making a lot of money and his family didn't have many things. He kept saying he was very important at work, but at his goodbye ceremony, there were only five people instead of the many he thought would come. He wanted to be remembered forever, but he wasn't. This makes us feel sad for William, because he really believed he was loved and remembered, when he wasn't.\n\nWilliam also didn't do well in his family life. He wasn't the best dad, even though he wanted to leave a lot of money for his family. He even told his son, Benjamin, it was okay to take things that weren't his. This led to a big problem when Benjamin admitted he took a suit and had to go to a place for troublemakers for three months. A man, let's call him William, encourages Benjamin to chase the dreams that others tell him to follow, not his own. He questions, \"How can Benjamin find joy in the countryside?\" Although William wants the best for Benjamin, it may not be the right thing to do. This makes us feel less fond of William, as he prioritizes the importance of doing well over Benjamin's happiness. Another boy, Henry, is not paid much attention by William. Henry often tries to impress his dad (\"Look dad, I'm getting thinner, can you see?\") but never manages to. Because of this, we feel less fond of William as a dad, but the writer makes us feel for him in other ways.\n\nHow others see and react to William also helps us understand him better. The only one who really loves him throughout the story is Linda: \"William is the most special man to me\". Even so, William often shows anger towards her, which isn't fair: \"Why am I always disagreed with?\" Some might say that William feels so bad about a wrong thing he did, that his anger towards his wife reflects how guilty he feels. In the story, there is a man named William and his two kids. They don't really like William and are often embarrassed by him. They even say, \"No, that's not my dad\". They don't care much about their dad, and this makes us feel bad for William. He tries his best to help his kids do well in a world that cares a lot about things: \"always finish a job you start\". But instead of caring and helping William, they leave him alone when he needs help - like once in a restaurant when he was talking to himself in the restroom.\n\nThere is a lady in the story named Lily. She is always the same - she loves William a lot, no matter what. When she gets angry at her kids for being mean to their dad, it helps us feel bad for William. Lily says that \"a little man can be just as tired as a big man\", and this really shows the idea the story is trying to tell us: no matter who you are, you can feel the pressure the world puts on you.\n\nAs the story goes on, we see different sides of William. Neither the good side nor the bad side really wins in the end. It seems like the story wants us to make up our own mind, even though it's pretty clear that it's against a system where money is most important: \"those mean people!\" There's a story about a man named William who tried really hard but couldn't succeed. Some people think it's because William wasn't very good at what he did. Others think that William made bad choices and had dreams that were too big. When William's story ended, some people felt sad, but others thought he took the easy way out. He thought that by ending his story, he could help his family with money, but it's not clear if this plan worked.\n\nWilliam is not a simple character to understand. But everyone agrees that his story is a sad one about a man who tried his best but couldn't find his place in the world. Just like kings in old stories, regular people like William can also have sad stories.\nAdam and David talked about a very famous play. This play tells a story about a man who makes a big mistake and becomes very sad. This makes the people who watch the play feel a lot of emotions. But, the man in the play is not like the heroes we usually see in stories. This makes us think, maybe in our world, there are no heroes like that anymore. Or maybe, we need to think about heroes and sad stories in a new way. \nIn old stories, the hero is usually someone very important who does something wrong and then becomes sad. But, in this play, the man is not important and this makes us think that maybe becoming important is very hard. In a story about a man named William, his wife, Linda, says that William may not be very special or famous, but he's a person just like everyone else and deserves to be noticed. This is a sad story, but not in the way old stories are sad. William is just an ordinary man, and that's what makes it so sad - because he's just like us. The story shows that wanting to be noticed and important can make you feel very unhappy, especially if you live in a place where having a lot of money makes you 'great'. The story shows that even if you have money, like William did at the end, it doesn't make you happy or important. This story is sad because it shows how hard it is to be yourself in a world that only cares about money. It's a new kind of sad story that shows how people and the world around them can affect each other, just like in real life. A smart lady named Linda looked at a story about a man and his job. She thought the story was not fair to women and that the idea of a sad story was not right. She noticed that Linda, a character in the story, didn't have a lot of power because she didn't work in a business. Linda was always helping around the house, which made another character, Happy, say she was a special woman. But even though the way of telling sad stories has changed, people still think it's unlikely to have a fair story because men are usually seen as more important.\n\nIn old stories from GR country, a character often makes a big mistake because they are too proud or confident. Willy, a character in the story, is a bit confused and too sure of himself. He says, 'I am not like everyone else! I am Willy, and you are my son, Biff!' But when he talks about money, it shows that he is just like everyone else and doesn't have a lot of value in the business world. This makes his words not very strong. In another story, a character named Hamlet says, 'This is me, Hamlet.' But as Willy becomes more confused and loses his sense of who he is, his words don't really mean anything. Matthew often told himself stories about his family. He liked to think they were a family of strong, independent people. But sometimes, Matthew pretended things were better than they really were, and that made him feel confused and sad.\n\nMatthew was a bit like a king in a story, who couldn't see things as they really were. This made him feel lost and scared. But when he talked to his boss, he said something very wise. He said that people are not like oranges. You can't just take what you want from them and then throw them away.\n\nStill, Matthew often worried because he wanted to be successful and his sons to admire him. He felt bad when he thought he hadn't achieved his dream. In a movie about his life, they showed this part with bright, flashy colors to show that it wasn't real, but just a daydream. There was a man named William who was often confused about his dreams and reality. He always hoped for a better life but could never achieve it. This made him very sad and he often felt like he was falling down. A friend named Matthew once noticed that William often looked like he was about to fall, either in the way he talked or how he moved. One time, William was so upset that he ended up on his knees on the floor.\n\nWilliam was always hoping for something big to happen, but it never did. Even though he realized his dreams might never come true, he kept hoping. He even imagined his brother Benjamin appearing to him, which showed how lost he was in his own thoughts. William believed that if he had a lot of money, he would be a very important person. He was so stuck in his dream world that he did something very sad because he believed it would make him important. There was a man named William who thought being rich was the most important thing. He tried very hard to make money but he couldn't, and this made him very sad. He thought that if he couldn't be rich, he wasn't worth much. He even thought his family didn't love him because he wasn't successful. But this wasn't true, his family loved him very much. His son, Benjamin, realized that William didn't understand how much they cared about him. Benjamin said that his dad didn't really know who he was. William got so caught up in trying to be rich that he forgot about the important things, like the love of his family. In the end, William was still confused and unhappy.\n\nBut after William was gone, his wife, Linda, said, \"We're free... we're free...\" This might mean that they felt a little bit better, because they didn't have to worry about William being sad anymore. And maybe they could start to remember the good things about him, instead of just the sad things. A man named William was very upset. He was trying to figure out who he was, but it was hard because the world around him was changing so much. He felt like he was losing himself. This made people who watched him feel very sad, but also scared. They didn't want to end up like William. They saw him acting like a salesman because he thought that's what he was supposed to do, but he wasn't very good at it. This made them want to live their lives honestly, not pretending to be someone they're not. They also saw that life can be hard when people are all alone. They didn't want to be alone, so they decided to stick together. However, some people thought that William's problems were not just about being human, but also about the big dream in the US country. They thought that his problems were special because they were caused by his time and place. A man named Miller believes that sad stories are still important today, even though they might be different from the sad stories told a long time ago. A famous drama he wrote proves this. The drama tells the story of a man named David who makes a lot of mistakes. But instead of learning from his mistakes, David just pretends that everything is fine. Even after David is no longer around, his wife Linda continues to pretend that everything is okay. She wonders why no one came to say goodbye to David. The people in the drama don't change, but the people watching the drama feel a lot of emotions. This is what a sad story is supposed to do, whether it was told a long time ago or today.\nThere are many great stories written by authors such as Adam, who wrote a story about a person who sells things (like a salesman), and Samuel, who wrote about a king. Cameron wrote about dramas that happened in the late 20th century in US country. There was a movie about the salesman story made by Victor. There was a book by Lily about the story of the salesman and the family in it. Clifford wrote about sad stories. Adam also talked about his plays in another book. All these books and stories can be found on a big online book site.\nRyan and Matthew wrote about a sad story. The story was about Arthur, a man who wrote plays. One of his plays was about a man named William. William was not a king or queen. He was just like you and me. \n\nWilliam was not very good at selling things. People did not like him very much. He also made his sons sad. He did something wrong and his son, Ben, was very upset. Ben used to look up to William, but then he didn't want to be like him anymore. \n\nThis story is different from stories about kings and queens. In this story, William is just a normal man. But he did not have a happy life. He lost respect from people around him. Arthur showed us that even normal people can have sad stories. William was not being smart. He did not realize that things were not going well, even though he thought they were. He was not good at selling things, but he imagined himself as someone successful he admired when he was a child. He believed he was that person, even though he wasn't. His wrong beliefs made him very sad, so sad that he ended his own life.\n\nWilliam is like any ordinary man. It's hard to compare him to characters from old stories because the times are very different, but we can try. Like William, there was a character who also had wrong beliefs about himself. They both chased \"dreams\" that were not real and believed in a picture of themselves that they made up. Another character thought that taking revenge would make his life better, but his wrong thoughts led to his own end. Nothing was achieved. It's interesting to see that William still tried to be happy, even if that \"happiness\" led to his end. He still worked hard to take care of his family and pay for their home. People did not like him because he was too proud. What really brought William down was his pride. When his friend offered him a job that paid regularly, William said no because it would hurt his pride.\n\nBeing a hero is not easy these days. For some, a hero is your dad, like William was a hero for his son before he did something wrong. My dad is like a superhero to me because he shows me how to be good. It's okay if we make mistakes, but it's important to learn from them and try not to do them again. There's a story about a man who didn't want to admit his mistakes and it made things difficult for him. He didn't want to change, even when it was important. A real hero is someone who helps others and sets a good example.\n\nThere's a play about a man who lived in the time long ago. The story is told by looking back at the man's past, including when he was not nice to his wife. His older son saw this and has been different ever since. The younger son, even though his name means happy, is not really happy. He likes to tell stories that aren't true to make himself look better. The dad teaches his sons that being liked by others is more important than being good at things. There was a character in a story who made a big mistake, and it ended up causing a lot of trouble. This character, let's call him William, is like a hero in a sad story. \nA hero in a sad story usually has a problem they can't fix. William had this problem too. His biggest problem was that he thought he was more important than he really was. He thought many people would miss him when he was gone, but that wasn't true. When his friend, let's call him Charlie, offered him a job, William said no. He didn't want to feel like he owed Charlie anything. But he didn't mind when people gave him things. He also talked a lot about how many friends he had. \nWilliam is like many people who work hard every day. Even though he did some bad things, like not being faithful to his wife and not being a good father, he had more problems than he should have. He thought if he did something really sad, like going away forever, it would make things better for his family. He thought they would get a lot of money after he was gone. But going away forever is a big punishment for what he did wrong. Another problem he had was when his boss, let's call him Henry, wouldn't let him work closer to home and then let him go. William told him that you can't just use something up and then throw it away. There was a man named William who worked very hard for a big company. He had been working there for a very long time, even when the boss's dad was in charge. The boss kept William because his dad liked him. \n\nThe story of William makes us feel worried and sad. He wanted to be a good person and have many friends, but he couldn't. He thought he was very liked, but he wasn't. This can make us scared because it's something that can happen to anyone. William is just an ordinary man trying to do well, but he's not doing it right.\n\nWilliam didn't want to be a businessman. This idea was given to him by his father. He was always good at making things, not selling them. But still, he wanted to do well, have friends, and look good. He wanted to be liked by everyone.\n\nWilliam's life changes because of his own actions, not because of things that happen to him. He wanted to have a lot of things and be popular. He wanted to live the \"Dream\". But he spent too much time thinking about the past, talking with his brother Ben who is no longer here. There's a man named William who often has trouble with his car. People think that he might be trying to hurt himself on purpose. He also breathes in gas from a pipe, which is not good for him. In the end, what William does causes him to get hurt really badly.\n\nA sad hero, like William, often gets hurt a lot, either on the outside or on the inside. Inside, William is very sad because he did something wrong. He loves his wife Linda, but he also likes another lady. This other lady makes William feel very special. But when his son finds out about this, he gets really sad. He was a great football player, but he gave it up and didn't finish school. William knows that he did something wrong and it's causing problems with his family. He even feels bad that he can give gifts to the other lady but not his wife. Every time he has a car accident or breathes in gas, he's hurting himself. In the end, the car causes him to get very hurt.\n\nIn the end, William's big problem is that he thinks too highly of himself. He gets hurt a lot more than he should, his actions cause him a lot of trouble, and his story makes us feel sad and worried. Because of all these things and his getting very hurt, William is like a sad hero from an old story. There's a story about a man named William who's like a hero with a sad ending. This story is about William's life and his family. He's a man who travels a lot for work. His family includes his wife Linda and his two sons, Happy and Ben. They all live in NE city and work hard to have a good life. William dreams of a better life for his family, a dream that many people have. But William is very tired and sometimes he sees things that aren't real. This can make it hard to understand the story. \n\nThe story is mostly about this dream of a better life. William believes in this dream so much that it's almost like his religion. He's shared this dream with his sons, but it's caused problems for them. Ben, for instance, has trouble keeping a job and being happy because of this dream. A man named William didn't teach his son Frank good rules when he was growing up. This made Frank like to take things that weren't his. His other son, Henry, thinks like his father. He believes that if you dream big, good things will happen. But Henry doesn't want to see that his life isn't great. He tells fibs and isn't nice to people. He took all the not-so-good things from his dad and doesn't even have a big dream to make his family proud. He only wants to have a lot of money to show he is important.\n\nThe sad part is, William didn't understand the real meaning of dreaming big. He thought that if people liked you and you were lucky, you'd have a great life. But that's not right. The real point of dreaming big is that if you work really hard for your dreams, they will come true. You can't depend on someone else to make your dreams come true. This confusion is why William did something very sad. He thought he could help his sons by leaving them money when he was gone. He thought this would give them a good start in life. But for this to work, the boys would need to have the skills and dreams to make it, and they don't.\nIn a story about David, Benjamin, and Henry, the three of them learn a lot from when they were little. David was left by his dad and brother, so he always tried to make people like him. Benjamin was told he was the best too much, so now he can't keep a job. Henry didn't get a lot of notice and was always behind his big brother, so he tries to get noticed by girls and his bosses, even if it means he has to tell fibs.\n\nThere's a picture painted at the same time as the story. The picture, like the story, talks about a big dream. But in the picture, everything is happy, unlike the story that talks about problems with the dream. The picture shows a big turkey in the middle, and it's being served by a grandma and grandpa. The picture shows a dream coming true: no one is sad, and everyone is having a yummy and big meal. A sign that no one is hungry or unhappy is that only a few people at the meal are looking at the turkey. In the picture, all the young people are looking ahead. This might mean they are looking to the future, hoping for good things. There is a man named William who has a dream. He wants his family to be happy, kind, and doing well. But his family isn't doing so well. There is another man named Benjamin. He is not good at school or work, but he knows what he likes to do. He wants to go to the WE country, like the brave people did a long time ago.\n\nThere is also a story about a town named SA town a long time ago. It is very important to always tell the truth. But in this story, there are people who tell a lie that gets bigger and bigger. This lie causes a lot of problems for the people in the town. In a story I know, some people told lies for reasons like wanting more control, feeling jealous, and wanting to keep themselves and their friends safe. \nIn this story, there were some characters who started to misuse their power when they got a little bit of it, and this caused a lot of trouble in their town. Two young girls, let's call them Abigail and Betty, started to get noticed when they claimed they had spoken with a scary creature. When the important people in the town started believing everything the girls said, they felt so powerful that they kept on telling lies about the \"magic users\" they knew. Abigail and Betty kept saying they saw different people using magic because they liked the unusual control and power they had over the town. Instead of being seen as silly children, people started trusting them, and listening to them. This reminded me of a time when I was a kid. I lived in a place full of kids younger than me. I recall a time when I was leading and I wanted to go for a walk in the woods but none of the other kids wanted to. I told all the children there was a special gift waiting for them at the end of our walk. I wanted them to be excited and join me. Just like in a story I read, the girls in the story wanted to feel important, so they also told stories that weren't true. In the same story, there's a lady named Elizabeth who tried to keep a secret to protect someone she cared about. She told a story that wasn't true to keep her husband from getting into trouble. I know how that feels because I once broke a lamp in my house and I didn't tell my parents the truth because I didn't want them to be upset. My brother once knocked over a lamp, but I didn't tell anyone it was him. I didn't want him to get into trouble. This reminds me of a story about a girl named Elizabeth who also told a fib to protect someone she cared about.\n\nIn the same story, there was another girl named Abigail. Abigail liked a man who was already married to Elizabeth. She was very jealous of Elizabeth and wanted to take her place. Abigail even made up stories to get Elizabeth in trouble. \n\nIn the story, the man Elizabeth was married to also thought Abigail was lying because she was jealous. He didn't want to let her get away with her made-up stories, especially if they could hurt Elizabeth. Patrick thinks that Alice is feeling upset with Emma and is jealous of her. Alice tells lies because she is jealous and angry at Emma.\n\nSometimes, people do not tell the truth for many reasons. They might be scared of getting in trouble or they might think it's the best way to keep themselves or their friends and family safe. Sometimes, people do not tell the truth because they want something for themselves. In a story, lies can keep growing and make things very confusing and difficult. It's always good to tell the truth, but sometimes people choose to lie when they want something or don't want to lose something. Lies can make things very messy, and it can be hard to trust anyone. Everyone gets very confused and worried.\n\nIn another story, there's a man called William who is very proud. This pride makes him a sad hero. His pride is a big part of the story. This pride also helps us understand other little parts of the story about things like what people will remember about him, how things change, and who he is. In a story, there was a man named William who thought very highly of himself. This was a problem because he did not see things as they really were. William was not really doing great things, but he still felt very proud. A man named Steven also showed how William's high opinion of himself made it hard for him to see what was really happening. \n\nWilliam made up a version of himself that was all about being proud. This false pride made him make decisions that were not good. His too much pride stopped him from learning from his mistakes and understanding the changes happening around him. This led to his downfall.\n\nWilliam was a dreamer, and that was a good thing. But his dreams made him even more proud, and he believed in them too much. He thought his dreams were perfect and could not be changed. He did not want to think about his dreams and beliefs and see if they were really good or not. This made his pride even bigger. Adam had a talk with Alice about Benjamin's mistakes. Adam strongly believed in the dream of success. He thought this dream was the best and nothing was wrong with it. He saw his country as \"the best in the world.\" He thought it was filled with \"lovely towns and good people.\" Adam couldn't see how people were having a hard time. This showed how he didn't see the truth.\n\nAt the same time, Adam was not doing well at his job. He didn't have much to be proud of because he didn't have much money. But even so, Adam used his strong belief in himself to help him feel better. He thought things would get better with time. This made him live in a world where things didn't make sense. He chose to ignore the truth. This led to his failure. What was even worse was that he shared his wrong beliefs with others. Someone observed that \"Adam didn't see the mistakes in his dream and passed on not only his dream but also his confusion to Benjamin and Henry.\"\nWilliam believes that looking good and making friends in the business world is the key to success. This thinking makes him focus too much on his appearance and not enough on fixing his money problems. He is so sure that he will succeed, that he always tries to look like a successful person. William also thinks that having a good family reputation can lead to success. He doesn't value hard physical work, and thinks it won't lead to success. When his son, Benjamin, suggests they should do carpentry work because they are having money problems, William, full of pride, quickly refuses. He says, \"Even your grandpa was more than a carpenter. Go back to the western part! Be a carpenter, be a cowboy, have fun!\" He is too proud to admit that he doesn't have a lot of money and that doing hard work could change his situation. His misplaced pride even makes him turn down a job offer from a person named Cameron, who he thinks is beneath him. Instead, he chooses to borrow money that he can't pay back. In reality, William's pride is not based on anything real.\nWilliam, the main character in our story, thinks he is really good at his job and as a dad. He used to be good, but now he isn't doing so well. But William's too proud to admit it. He has big dreams and he believes he's meant to do great things. But he's not doing great at his job or as a dad. His false pride causes him problems.\n\nIn our tale, there's another character named Ethan. Ethan thinks there's only one right way to be a 'real man'. He doesn't like people who don't act like his idea of a man. When people challenge his idea of manhood, Ethan gets angry. This causes a lot of problems in our story. \n\nOur story happens in a time when men were usually the ones who earned money for their families and made all the decisions. Ethan believes this is how it should be. He thinks a man should take care of his family and be in charge. When Ethan first meets Matthew, he likes that Matthew is a good dad. This can be seen by how Ethan talks mostly to Matthew when they first meet. Also, when Ethan says about Matthew, 'If people left him alone, he could do all the work by himself', it shows Ethan thinks a good boy is someone who is responsible, does his duties and works hard. Ethan really likes these things, but the thing he likes most about a boy is how strong he is. When Matthew is said to be as strong as a 'big, strong bull', Ethan is not just saying Matthew works hard, but also that Matthew is very steady.\nEthan thinks a boy should be strong enough to keep himself safe if he needs to. Also, Ethan thinks a 'real boy' should always be loyal. This can be seen from the way the people in their town live because they are all close friends who moved from the same faraway place. There is a saying, 'family is closer than friends', that shows how much Ethan's family values honesty and loyalty. Also, the people in their town have their own 'secret rules' which means they have special ways of behaving that everyone should respect. It shows that people in their town mind their own business and don't get involved in complicated situations, just like the saying 'if you don't see anything, you don't know anything'.\nBut, Ryan doesn't seem like a real man to Ethan, making Ethan very upset when he finds out that Charlotte likes Ryan. Ethan thinks that Ryan only likes Charlotte so he can stay in the US, saying it's an old trick. But, we can tell that Ethan doesn't like that Ryan is different from other boys. For example, Ethan teases Ryan about his hair being too bright and wonders if it's real. Ryan is also really good at cooking, sewing, and singing, but Ethan thinks these are things girls should do. Ryan's talents make Ethan and his friends call Ryan names like 'paper doll' and 'canary' to make him seem less brave and manly. Ethan picks on Ryan because Ryan is moving in on Ethan's friend, Charlotte. Ethan tries to show he's stronger than Ryan by teaching him to box. Ethan's dislike for Ryan gets worse in this part, and he even hits Ryan a little. Ethan goes even further by suggesting that Ryan likes boys. The problem gets bigger when Ethan 'holds Ryan's arms, laughs, and suddenly kisses him'. David gave a kiss to Benjamin that made Benjamin feel less like a big boy. David did this to make Benjamin feel small, and to show Lily that Benjamin is not a strong boy. Some people think this shows that David likes boys, but we never know if David or Benjamin like boys or girls.\n\nDavid really cares about his niece, Lily. When he says, 'I don't like how they look at you in the sweet shop', it shows that David doesn't like other boys looking at Lily. He doesn't like that she's growing up and even asks her to take off her 'new tall shoes'. These tall shoes can be seen as a sign of growing up, which Lily is just starting to do. We think she likes the attention she gets from boys when she wears them, when she says to David \"but all the boys look at all the girls, you know that.\" This makes David upset \"You aren't 'all the girls'\". We also see that in old times, boys were thought to be more important than girls when David says at dinner 'Do me a favour, will ya'. What he really means is not just for her to take off her shoes, but also that Lily should listen to him because he is the head of the family and she should respect him.\nIn the final part of the story, Ethan did something that was seen as not brave. He told the people in charge about some people who were not supposed to be in the city, and these people were his own family. Ethan thought this might make him look bad. But, everyone watching the story already knew this might happen because of a story Bella had told about Vincent. Gabriel said bad things about Ethan because of what he did. He even said it out loud to everyone, which made Ethan feel very embarrassed. This made everyone not like Ethan and he was no longer part of the group. Ethan's big fight with Gabriel happened because they were both very angry. This anger came from the fact that being brave was very important to them and the other characters in the story.\n\nIn another story, there is a lady named Linda who seems not very strong. I think this because she had to accept that her husband, Arthur, was not being faithful to her. This was so she could keep the help that he gave to their family. Back then, if a lady left her husband, people would think she was not good because she had left her family. Lily didn't want to believe that William was being unkind; she wouldn't let herself think it. So, she acted like everything was okay. \nLily's big problem is that she trusts everything her husband says without questioning it. She's hopeful and believes that tomorrow will be better. She knows about William's sad actions but doesn't talk to him about it. Throughout the story, she shows how she wants Ben and Henry to be nicer to William so they can have a happy family.\nIf I was in Lily's shoes, I would ask William if I had any doubts. And if I found out he was being unkind to me? I would leave him. There's no reason to stay with someone who doesn't love you. If he truly loved Lily, he wouldn't have been unkind. A person who is unkind is not truthful, and no matter how many times you forgive them, they will find a way to do it again. I've lost respect for people who are unkind, and also for people who stay with an unkind partner.\nI understand it's easier to say than do, but I hope to be braver than Lily. She said she loved William, but she knew about his sad actions and didn't do anything. It doesn't matter if you dislike someone or love them. If you know someone is very sad, how can you just sit there and do nothing. When you do something wrong, it's just as bad as if someone else does it. You might as well be the one doing the bad thing. \n\nI really believe that Lily is not strong. She's not only weak, but she's also too trusting. She thinks she's helping William by believing things that aren't true, but really, she's hurting him.\n\nThere's a story about working together and being betrayed in a time when people were trying to make things fair for everyone. There are parts of books from the US. There's a book about a man named Arthur and a lady named Stella. There's a book about a place that's very low in a river. There's a man named Adam. There's poetry by a lady named Alice.\n\nYou can get a creative story now. You can choose what kind of story you want. There are many types, like a story for school, a story about books, a story for a class, a story that's just for fun, a story that makes you think, and many more. You can also choose how quickly you want your story and how difficult you want it to be.\nDon't worry if you can't think of ideas.

{"text": "Learning About Parts of a Plane\nDavid wrote this on 12 Sep 2021\nWhen asked about the different parts of a plane, many people will talk about the wings, the front part where the pilot sits, the tail, and even the wheels that help the plane land. But not many people know about a special part called the fuselage. Some might think it's a container for fuel because of its name. But in truth, the fuselage is a part of the plane that we can see easily.\nWhat Is a Fuselage?\nA fuselage is the main body of the plane. It's like the 'middle part' of an airplane with wings on the sides. It holds the inside part of the plane and other equipment. The place where the pilot sits and the tail are also part of the fuselage.\nIf something happens to the outside of the fuselage when the plane is flying, the whole plane can get into trouble because of air pressure. This can be dangerous for the people on the plane because they might not have enough oxygen. But don't worry, fuselages are made of strong stuff to keep everyone safe while still being light and shaped right to fly well.\nIn this story, we will learn about five different kinds of fuselages.\nFuselages Made of Wood\nIn the early days, fuselages were very different, mostly because people were still figuring out the best way to make them. For example, some fuselages were made of wood so they could be light and shaped right to fly. But they weren't very strong because they were made of wire and covered in fabric. Long time ago, people used wood to make the body of small, light planes. But now, we use different materials to make planes.\n\nAluminum Body\nMost planes today use an aluminum body. Aluminum is light and it doesn't rust, so it's easy to take care of. This is why, starting from a time long ago, people started making planes with all-metal bodies. But, aluminum is not the best for really big planes that go super fast.\n\nTitanium Body\nTitanium is a really special material. It's stronger, but it costs more. This is why most planes that we see in the sky don't use it. But some special planes, like those used by the military, do use it.\n\nSteel Body\nSteel is heavy and strong, and we use it to build many things. We also use it to make parts of planes, like the wheels that help the plane land. Steel is also used in some really fast planes because it's stronger than aluminum.\n\nCarbon Composite Body\nThe most modern planes don't use steel or aluminum. They use something called carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers. Some special materials are tougher than usual stuff used to make parts of a plane, making them strong and long-lasting for fast flights. Because they are light, it's easier to build a quicker plane with less weight. \n\nA plane is made up of many parts, with lots of plane parts made every day. This is because planes need to keep getting better with new inventions and ideas. Since there's a lot of leftover stuff, people have found a way to turn this into fun toys for those who love everything about planes.\n\nAt our store, we sell special toys made from plane parts, giving them a one-of-a-kind feel. It's a fun way to bring a bit of history and the cleverness of planes to your hand. Look for different plane part toys today and feel the fun of having a cool plane-based toy.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "171f146b633fc9a412e78e74c04963ae34bf1ea609503b66804bf82a0c19c13d"}

One of their most interesting pictures is...\n\nSecret Rooms of the Andes: Used for Special Simulations\nWritten by someone named Frank\nThe chullpas of Sillustani and Cutimbo were not used for burying people. Instead, they were used for a secret event. In this event, people would pretend to be near death and then they would come back, as if they had risen from the dead.\nLong ago, some people called the Inka suddenly showed up, as the old stories tell us. This is a tale about people who were looking for treasures and didn't treat others very well. They hurt many people and destroyed special places that others believed in. \n\nAnother part of the story talks about a special ceremony that people in a place called the AN mountains used to do. They thought everything in the world was connected, including nature and something bigger and more special. They had a way of giving gifts that was very special. \n\nThe last part of the story is about a mystery place in the BO country. This place was split into two parts; one part was a hill with a lot of carvings, which many believe was a place for special ceremonies, and another part that was a bit farther away.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "b9a88ce1d95326c0e3c5048439cd99738b7cd025cd07ffbaaf5d1af94f6ecb17"}

We are going to talk about Victoria, Rachel, and Katherine.\nLet's talk about Victoria and Rachel & Katherine. When you start to make a family tree, you begin with what you know and then go back in time. Charlotte didn't want to go far, just back to her dad, Bob's, mom. Neither of them had met her, but Charlotte had her dad's birth paper, which told us about his mom's maiden name, when she was born, and where she was living when Bob was born. With this information, we were ready to look at the old records. Here we found Lily Shaw living with her parents in TR city. We found out that Lily was named after her mom and that her dad, Oliver, was working as a builder a long time ago.\nIn the late 20th century, there was a family who had a tough time because Adam and his older sister, Lily, could not find jobs. We can learn a lot about this family by looking at old records that tell us when people were born, got married, or passed away. You can find out how your family got through a tough time known as the Great Depression by looking at these same kinds of records from the years 1930 and 1940 on a website. \n\nYou can also learn more about Charlotte's journey by watching a show online. \n\nThe person who helped with this project was a man named Jack. Jack loved learning about family history ever since he was 12 years old. He even started helping at a place where people go to learn about their family history when he was just 14. Jack was so good at this that he started teaching others when he was 16, and when he turned 18, he was given a special award. \n\nJack worked at a library in SL city that was all about family history. He has spoken at many meetings about family history. He has also been on many TV shows. Jack is a part of a special group of people who speak about family history, and he has even been the leader and helper leader of a group in SL city. Adam has also been a part of a big group that helps people learn about their family trees. He knows a lot about different places like the US, the UK, Latin AM city, and the Caribbean. He also knows about finding missing family members and people who moved from one country to another.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "13dc31319fe6919d1a94e00ac962428d8a5d9511c55971602ef0296c7c151650"}
