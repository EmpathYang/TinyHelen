the pretty, pretty money.\" \"Pretty, pretty money.\" \"Aren't you a lot of pretty money?\" \" Okay.\" \" Really?\" \" Shouldn't ask again.\" \" Accepting and moving on.\" \" Excuse me.\" \" Oh, my goodness, Kevin.\" \"I forgot you were here.\" \"If I had a coin for every time I heard that.\" \" I'm very sorry.\" \"You have my full attention.\" \" I'm gonna go.\" \"We'll talk tomorrow about the details.\" \"Okay.\" \"All right, Kevin, show me what you got.\" \"If you'll just follow me, I'd like to show you... with my new line of special mailboxes.\" \" They look very nice.\" \" And funny.\" \"They say to the world, \"I'll take my mail with a smile.\"\" \"Yes, they do say that.\" \"And since you are one of our best customers... with the purchase of one of our mailboxes...\" \"I'll give you a carved-duck doorstop and a garlic peeler.\" \"Wow.\" \"Quite a deal... but I think it's a bit early for me to pick a mailbox.\" \"We haven't even decided on a color for the inn yet.\" \" Funny goes with everything.\" \" Kevin, I promise, just as soon \"as...\"\" \" Is that Charlie?\" \" Yes, it is.\" \"Adam loves... and her big mouth is good for putting mail in.\" \"I need to think.\" \"Okay.\" \"So, I heard you are making food for people now.\" \"Yes, just for a bit.\" \"Are you guys good?\" \"Not bad.\" \"And how much would we need to pay for your food?\" \"It depends.\" \"The kind of food, number of people, place.\" \"Simple food, two guests, my mom's house.\" \"Really?\" \"I have a friend coming from far away.\" \"I thought it would be nice to give her some catered food.\" \"Her?\" \"She was my brother's old girlfriend.\" \"Lily.\" \"Nice name.\" \"I liked her for a while... and she's coming home to see her mom, and she called me.\" \"You have a date.\" \"No, just a plan to take Lily to dinner.\" \"That's a date.\" \"I'm not expecting much, if that's what you're thinking.\" \"Adam, it's very nice... but are you sure you want to have dinner in your house?\" \"The kitchen nook isn't special enough.\" \"When you're having dinner in your house...\" \"where will your mom be?\" \"Probably in the same room.\" \"Is that what you want?\" \"To have dinner with your mom watching?\" \"I could ask her to look at the wall.\" \"Or you could take Lily to a place to eat.\" \"Which one?\" \"What does she like?\" \"I don't know.\" \"Should I call my brother and ask?\" \"If he knew, she'd probably still be with him.\" \"I really want it to be nice.\" \"Just take her somewhere you like.\" \"It doesn't have to be fancy.\" \"If you like it, she'll like it.\" \"Okay.\" \"Just not one in a bowling alley.\" \"That makes it easier.\" \"I'll think of something.\" \"Good, you'll see.\" \"It'll be great.\" \"Do you think I could come by tomorrow... with some clothes for you to choose?\" \"Adam, you can dress yourself.\" \"Just look nice, you know.\" \"Not too fancy.\" \"Clean.\" \"No jeans.\" \"Maybe a jacket.\" \"Morning sound good?\" \"Perfect.\" \"A jumping toy.\" \"That's new.\" \"Helps with my leg pain.\" \"Squeaky.\" \"Yes.\" \"Phone.\" \"Thanks.\" \"Alice, can you get the phone?\" \"Alice?\" \" Don't answer it.\" \" Why not?\" \"It's Adam, and we're upset.\" \"Does he know you're upset, 'cause he's not going away.\" \" He knows.\" \"Trust me, he knows.\" \" Okay.\" \" You're really not gonna answer that?\" \" Nope.\" \" Alice, come on.\" \" Fine.\" \"There.\" \" Why are you and Adam upset?\" \" Because he's not right.\" \" Okay.\" \" He won't listen to me.\" \"You won't listen to me!\" \"He likes to talk a lot.\" \"You'd think he was already a big boss.\" \"I don't want to be his helper.\" \"I don't wanna wait for a long time while he does his thing... so by the time I get my turn I'm too old to enjoy it.\" \"I don't think helpers are too old to enjoy it.\" \" Fine.\" \"Be on his side.\" \" I'm not on his side.\" \"I'm on her side.\" \" Don't answer it.\" \" Alice, I need to read.\" \" Go ahead.\" \" I can't.\" \" Why not?\" \" The phone.\" \"Don't, Bella!\" \"I mean it.\" \"Hello?\" \"Hi, Adam.\" \"Yes, she is here.\" \" No.\" \" Alice, you're acting silly.\" \"You like Adam, so just get on the phone and fix it... so that I can read, okay?\" \"What?\" \"No, I haven't thought about what you said.\" \"Because I'm very busy.\" \"And unlike what you think...\" \"I have more important things to do than thinking about you... or what you said... or what you meant, or what you want... or anything about you, or concerning you.\" \"Have him call you back on your phone.\" \"Then you can talk to him outside.\" \"It's nice outside.\" \"There're birds and trees.\" \" My phone is not working.\" \" Then take mine.\" \" What's your phone plan?\" \" Why?\" \"I'm not gonna borrow your phone and get a big bill...\" \" because your phone plan is not good.\" \" Alice.\" \"Adam, I'm going to call you back on Bella's phone.\" \" Yes, I am.\" \" Yes, she is.\" \" Okay, bye.\" \" Here.\" \" I'll be back.\" \" Take your time.\" \" Taylor, I'm trying to read.\" \" Okay.\" \" I can hear the TV through the wall.\" \" Okay.\" \"It's distracting.\" \"Should I turn off the TV?\" \"No, you don't have to.\" \"But your grandma bought the TV for all of us.\" \"So, you can use it too.\" \"If it's too loud, I can make it quieter.\" \"But it's hard because the TV speakers are high up in the corner.\" \"Maybe I could use a ladder.\" \"But never mind, Thomas.\" \"Are you sure I don't want to turn it off?\" \"Try this one.\" \"I love you.\" \"I love your food... but if you make me eat more broccoli pie...\" \"I will throw it at you.\" \"Your mom is very picky about food.\" \"She has very good taste, and she can tell if a pie isn't good.\" \"Depending on how long it's been out, we all can.\" \"She hasn't called us yet.\" \"She will.\" \"But she was supposed to call about the party details a few days ago.\" \"She will.\" \"But it's soon.\" \"We still don't know if she wants a fish dish or a cheese dish.\" \"We'll make a dish with both fish and cheese just to be sure.\" \"Lily.\" \"Why do I have to call her?\" \"Because you're planning the party, and I'm busy making food.\" \"Ask her about the special dish.\" \"Is it too common?\" \"I can make it special, you know, with cherries.\" \"Okay.\" \"You know what to say.\" \"Hello, Mom.\" \"Lily, hello.\" \"It's nice to hear from you.\" \"How are you?\" \"I'm fine.\" \"Thank you for asking.\" \"Good.\" \"I'm happy to hear that.\" \"And I'm happy to tell you.\" \"So, I'm calling because we haven't heard from you yet.\" \"We need to know more about the party.\" \"We haven't heard from you yet?\" \"Yes, we.\" \"Me and Sophia.\" \"Yes, our company.\" \"Anyhow...\" \"A few years ago... there was a company.\" \"They were very popular until they made food for a big party... and many people got sick from the food.\" \"So, they had to close their company.\" \"And I think one of them left the town without taking their things.\" \"That's a good story.\" \"Henry Charles Anderson?\" \"You know, some people might mix up the Independence Catering Company with the Independent Catering Company.\" \"And that would be sad for you, wouldn't it?\" \"Now, if I'd known what you were going to call your company...\" \"I could have told you.\" \" Mom, I promise, I tried to tell you.\" \" You did?\" \"Yes, I did.\" \" I sent you a paper.\" \"Didn't you get my paper?\" \" No, I didn't get your paper.\" \"I sent it, and honestly...\" \"I was a bit sad you didn't call to say well done... but now that I know you didn't get it, I forgive you.\" \" When did you send a paper?\" \" Last week.\" \" What did it say?\" \" You know, \"Come and get it.\"\" \"You wrote \"come and get it\" on your business paper?\" \"No, it was just introducing the Independent Catering Company paper.\" \"It had our phone number, our address, and a funny picture of us.\" \" That sounds like a very nice paper.\" \" It was.\" \"Do you have an extra one?\" \"You can bring it with you on Friday night.\" \"Sure.\" \"Because it's very rare these days for things to get lost in the mail.\" \"You don't think you got the address wrong?\" \" Mom, the party?\" \" All right.\" \"I'm going to want a mix of white, off-white, and cream-colored cloth.\" \"A simple bone china with a gold or deep-blue stripe will work.\" \" Got it.\" \" I'm going with candles cut in half... so that people can see each other across the table.\" \"We'll need white and sterling roses, but not too high or formal.\" \" Do you have a florist?\" \" I have a florist.\" \" Does he have a paper?\" \" You want clear or silver vases?\" \" You must think I'm silly.\" \" No, Mom, I don't.\" \"There is no paper.\" \"You're making it up to cover for the fact that you once again forgot... to tell me about an important thing in your life.\" \"Mom, I promise, there's a paper.\" \"Shame on you for promising there's a paper.\" \"That's the worst thing you could do.\" \"Lily Taylor grew up her whole life... thinking Todd Rundgren was her real dad.\" \"You think that might make this less bad?\" \"I tell you, if I saw this kind of behavior from some other company I was hiring...\" \" I would let them go right away.\" \"Then let us go, Mom.\" \"What?\" \"You're not getting your daughter and her friend.\" \"You're getting a professional party company.\" \"This is not a favor.\" \"It is a business deal.\" \"And I want you to treat us... just like you would treat any other person from the town.\" \" If you want.\" \" Thank you.\" \"I'm sorry, but we're very busy preparing for your party... so I have to end the call now.\" \"Goodbye, Mom.\" \"Goodbye.\" \" Mean woman.\" \" You didn't ask about the food.\" \"My room is like a silly movie.\" \"Put some toaster pastries under the door in a little while, please.\" \"Sweetie.\" \" You filled my room with pies.\" \" They're not pies.\" \"They're broccoli pastries.\" \" Then you filled my room with pastries.\" \" Sorry, sweetie.\" \"I didn't know you were coming home today.\" \"Sookie's testing food for Grandma's party.\" \"How can I study when it smells like broccoli?\" \"Study in the living room.\" \"This is not for the living room.\" \"This is serious bedroom study.\" \" I have lots of work to do.\" \" Here's an idea.\" \"Can't you find a place at school you can study?\" \" Don't they have, like, many libraries?\" \" But they don't feel right.\" \"They're too silent and too big, and very cold.\" \" At least they don't smell like pie.\" \" Enough about the pie.\" \"I can't believe I came all the way home and there's no place to work.\" \" It's just for a while.\" \" Until the sewing machine arrives.\" \"Do you know how many kids would love to come home... to a room full of pie?\" \"Sorry, pastries.\" \" Pastries are totally different.\" \" I know, sweetheart.\" \"Sit down.\" \"I'll be right there.\" \" Cameron.\" \" Yes?\" \"Do you know what the key to a really good fish sandwich is?\" \" What?\" \" Fish.\" \" That's not fish?\" \" No, it's turkey.\" \" Give me the plate.\" \"I'll do it again.\" \" Don't be annoyed with me.\" \"I'm not the one who made the wrong sandwich.\" \"What are you doing, Kevin?\" \"Pretend I was a famous actor.\" \"Where would you put me?\" \"In an acting class.\" \"No, I mean, what do you think is the best seat here?\" \" I don't know.\" \"Can we hear well here?\" \"What?\" \"The restrooms are right over there.\" \"One big flush and the whole feeling is ruined.\" \"I can't play with you now.\" \"Come back later.\" \"Okay, I'll just save these three tables and decide later.\" \"Save these three for...\" \"Midweek night, when it's dark.\" \"We don't save tables.\" \"But this is special.\" \"And Laura told me to go where I'm happy...\" \" and I'm happy here.\" \"Really?\" \"Not right now... but before, I was happy here.\" \" Please?\" \" Why is it special?\" \"I have a playdate.\" \"You really had to say the \"playdate\" part?\" \"Kind of.\" \" Okay, you can have one table when it's dark.\" \" Thank you.\" \"Here.\" \"What's this?\" \"It's a drawing of how I want the table.\" \"Look.\" \"Little flowers by her plate, and the juice bucket here... so I don't knock it with my arm.\" \"I don't have juice.\" \" Why not?\" \" This is a restaurant.\" \" Good juice is nice with everything.\" \" Bring your own juice.\" \"What about the flowers?\" \"Okay, fine.\" \"I'll get the juice and the flowers.\" \"Now, what if the playdate goes well.\" \"How much for the place upstairs?\" \" My house?\" \" Yes.\" \" Bye, Kevin.\" \" Okay, see you later.\" \" Excuse me, is that yummy?\" \" Yes.\" \" What is it?\" \" Meat cake.\" \"So, this meat cake, is it romantic for you?\" \" Does it make you happy?\" \" Kevin.\" \"Good chat.\" \"I can't believe we're doing this.\" \"You did tell her to treat us like any other food service.\" \"\"I'd like you to do a test meal, Laura.\" \"After all, you are a new team.\"\" \"She must be very happy now.\" \"She's probably been laughing into her magic mirror all day.\" \"It's going to be easy.\" \"Just wait and see.\" \"Three hours of being nice.\" \"We're not going to be just nice.\" \"We're going to be serving and making happy.\" \" Anything to make me look silly, anything at all.\" \" Wow.\" \"You grew up here?\" \"I promise, if she makes me wear a uniform...\" \"This is Charlie's house.\" \"Put a napkin on my arm.\" \"Is there a water ring?\" \"Help me, okay?\" \"Help when you can.\" \"I promise.\" \"Can I help you?\" \"Hello.\" \"We're the food helpers.\" \"We're here...\" \"The helper's door is at the back.\" \"Was that a helper?\" \"Let's go.\" \"Why are all those balls over there?\" \"Learning about IR city is not fun, learning about GE city is not fun... everything here is not fun!\" \"Yoga makes you look good, Gabriel.\" \"Don't answer that, I mean it.\" \"Don't touch the phone.\" \"Great.\" \"Glad you know.\" \"It's been bothering me for a while...\" \"Is this white or creamy?\" \"It's white.\" \"The creamy one is more creamy.\" \"I cut those myself, so they can be changed.\" \"I mean, they can be made smaller.\" \"Making them taller would be harder once they're cut... but if they lie, they'll grow back.\" \"I guess you'll have helpers.\" \"Yes, we will.\" \"I guess you'll tell your helpers not to make joke about Pinocchio.\" \"Yes, we will.\" \"Alright, here we go.\" \"We would start with either roasted vegetables with cheese... or three types of winter soups... tomato, squash, and garlic.\" \"Very fancy.\" \"And very tasty.\" \"I'll tell the helpers not to do that, either.\" \"Lily?\" \"Yes?\" \"My napkin.\" \"Yes.\" \"Your napkin, yes.\" \"I have it.\" \"Do you want me to put it in your shirt?\" \"My lap is okay.\" \"Okay.\" \"Here you go.\" \"Feel free to drop anything you want there.\" \"You are covered.\" \"What is the next food?\" \"Seafood pie.\" \"You can bring it now.\" \"Okay.\" \"Sophia, how much longer for your baby?\" \"Eight months.\" \"There doesn't seem to be a reason... for a lady with a baby in her belly... to be running to the kitchen, does there?\" \"No, there doesn't.\" \"You should take my plate.\" \"Otherwise you won't have a place to put the pie.\" \"I can think of a place.\" \"What was that?\" \"The plate is gone.\" \"Okay, when I tell you, you go in and keep her busy... and I'll take her down.\" \"Understood?\" \"Here we go,\" said Sophia. \"Sophia's famous fish pie. Very nice crust. Thank you.\" Sophia, your food is as good as I remember it.\" \"Thank you, Emma.\" \"And I think, after we make the presentation better, we'll have a nice dinner party. So we got the job?\" \"Yes, you got the job. We got the job. Thank you. You will not be disappointed. No, I will not. The event starts in the evening. I would like you to be here in the afternoon. I'm going to make a copy of my notes here so you both can look at it on the way home. We did it! We got the job! What a great thing! We got a big job. We always had the job. The big job was just playing with us. She was pushing us and making us wet because that's what big jobs do: Make every other job look small until there's nothing left but a mess. Boy, you really don't like big jobs, do you? It's amazing. Out of nowhere, bam! It was right there. Things always happen when you least expect it. I have to tell you, this tree is perfect. All girls think their tree is perfect. It fits my back completely, and there's plenty of grass. It's in a great area, not too close to anything loud, but not too far away either. Can it cook? Because I can get it a great job with a particular woman. Grandma's not particular. She's just specific. At least one of us is happy. And thank God it's me. My feelings exactly. You have no idea how much studying I got done today. Seriously, ask me anything. Okay. How did I end up cooking for my mother's party? You keep saying the same thing. As soon as I hear you talking about a study bush, I'll know it's time to move on. Okay, I have to go. Yeah? Going to shop for a nice yellow ribbon? Have some fries for me. I will. Burger, onion rings, and a list of people who were brave. I'm looking for heroes. \"Did the food taste good?\" \"We got the job.\" \"It would be sad if we didn't.\" \"I can't do this.\" \"It's a job.\" \"Yes, it's a job.\" \"It's like playing music before a big band.\" \"That's the type of job it is.\" \"Liam.\" \"Yes?\" \"What's Kevin doing?\" \"He's practicing.\" \"For what?\" \"His meeting with a friend.\" \"He's doing a practice run.\" \"Talking, eating, chatting.\" \"Then he's going to think about how he did, and change things if he needs to.\" \"Wow!\" \"Have you ever thought about how many ways Kevin could be asked to leave a group?\" \"What a sad guy.\" \"He's sad.\" \"He likes a girl.\" \"That's nice.\" \"All day, I have this strange person sitting in my food place... ordering everything, by the way... to see which food is less messy.\" \"If he's bothering you that much, you can ask him to leave.\" \"You ask him to leave.\" \"It's your fault he's here.\" \"How is it my fault?\" \"I'm not meeting him.\" \"You told him to find a place he felt good.\" \"How was I supposed to know he felt good here?\" \"I don't know.\" \"All I know is you talked to him... and now he's over there talking to a toy.\" \"Come on, Liam.\" \"Be kind.\" \"He wants the meeting to go well.\" \"I mean, it's what we all want.\" \"To find a nice friend to spend time with until we're old.\" \"It's not much to ask.\" \" I guess.\" \"And think about the good things.\" \"If Kevin's meeting goes well, he'll be busy... and you'll see less of him at the food place.\" \"Stop!\" \"Okay, that wasn't good.\" \"Let's try again.\" \"Pay attention!\" \"I'll have his special seat ready tomorrow.\" \"I think this should be everyone.\" \"You've checked it twice?\" \"I have checked it twice, but I'm sure you will also check it twice.\" \"You know I will.\" \"So I am very sure that no one will be left out.\" \"This is very nice.\" \"Isn't it, though?\" \"It's a flower seller Fiona found.\" \"We're using him for the party.\" \"I think that will be perfect.\" \"It has to be perfect.\" \"These are important people we're trying to make happy.\" \"Ryan.\" \"Emma.\" \"Jack, what a nice surprise.\" \"You should have told me Jack was coming.\" \"I would have made something special.\" \"Please, I've gotten bigger since I came into this house.\" \"Boys always say that, but it's not true.\" \"I just came by for the office keys.\" \"That's right.\" \"Forgot to give you the keys.\" \"I'm sorry, Jack.\" \"Here you go.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Sorry to disturb your night.\" \"I'll see you tomorrow.\" \"Jack, I need your friend list as soon as possible.\" \" My friend list?\" \" For the big party.\" \"You did remember to ask Jack for his list, didn't you?\" \"Emma, I am a very busy man.\" \"Honestly, Richard, that's why you have a helper.\" \"Jack, I apologize for my husband.\" \"The big party for your company is next week.\" \"I've got the whole thing set up.\" \"All I need is your friend list.\" \" You set up a big party?\" \" Yes, and trust me... there's no one who can plan a nicer event quickly... than Emma.\" \"True, and thank you, but you still forgot to tell him.\" \"I really appreciate it... but I'm not sure a big party is the right idea.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"We usually do something for our clients.\" \"They like it.\" \"It gives us a chance to chat with them, make friends.\" \"It's the little things that make you special in business.\" \"I agree, and that's why I've planned a trip to AC city.\" \"What?\" \"Get everyone out, away from work, away from their families... away from stuffy party music and flowers.\" \"Have some silly fun.\" \"Good food, plenty to drink, maybe a little game, a show... and nothing makes two businessmen friends... more than finding the other feeling sick with a doll in their bed next morning.\" \" What?\" \" It's just a saying.\" \"You can't be serious.\" \"These are respectable men and women.\" \"There are bad guys in AC city.\" \" Let's hope not.\" \" Talk to him.\" \"I'm not sure...\" \"This is the thing that could make us different from the other companies.\" \"It's different, maybe a little crazy... but they will remember it, and they will talk about it with their friends.\" \"Yes, I suppose they will.\" \"Every other company in town is having a nice cocktail party.\" \"Believe me, right now, my mom has 12 helpers... trying hard to get fancy fish eggs for my dad's clients.\" \"Let's not give our friends tiny sandwiches, Richard.\" \"Let's give them some fun.\" \"It's different.\" \"You can't be serious.\" \"It's good to change with the times.\" \"But you're leading a serious business, not a music company.\" \"People aren't looking to you to give them a good time.\" \"They are looking to you to protect their things.\" \"Let's think about this for a moment.\" \"I mean, how soon is this party?\" \"Is it too late to stop?\" \"No, it's not too late to stop.\" \"All right.\" \"Jack, we'll try it your way.\" \"We will go to the AT city.\" \"I think it's a good idea.\" \"And, Emma, thank you again for the offer.\" \"See, now you can just hang out and relax.\" \"My two favorite things.\" \"Okay, see you tomorrow.\" \"See you tomorrow.\" \"Excuse me, you're sitting under my tree.\" \"What?\" \"My special tree.\" \"This is my special tree.\" \"What's a special tree?\" \"Okay.\" \"See, I have roommates...\" \"So do I.\" \"Yes, but I have Alice and I have Tina and I have Jessica...\" \"and Jessica talks a lot...\" \"Look, I'm busy, okay?\" \"Yes, I see you're very busy with your \"Truck book\" there... but I finally found a great place to study, and you're sitting on it.\" \"There's a lot of trees here.\" \"But this one fits my back perfectly so I don't get tired... and the light is right... and it's just far enough from anything busy... so that the noise level is perfect... and it's quiet but not too quiet, \"and...\"\" \"And anyway, I was just hoping... that maybe you would consider giving me back my tree.\" \"No.\" \"After you.\" \"This place seems nice.\" \"Yes, diners are apparently very popular nowadays.\" \"Really?\" \"Very, very cool.\" \"Excuse me.\" \"Yes?\" \"I believe I have a table for two.\" \"The name's Kevin.\" \"Kevin, yes.\" \"Okay.\" \"Follow me.\" \"How's this?\" \"Very good.\" \"Thank you.\" \"There's more where that came from.\" \"It's my lucky night.\" \"I'm getting the special treatment.\" \"You did show up.\" \"Yes, I did.\" \"I hear the food is excellent here.\" \"Coming.\" \"Mom.\" \"Were you asleep?\" \"No.\" \"Then why are you in your pajamas?\" \"These aren't pajamas.\" \"Do you wear that outside?\" \"Hello, Mom.\" \"Would you like to come in?\" \"Your clothes say \"juicy\" on the back.\" \"If I knew you were coming, I would have worn something else.\" \"What else?\" \"A top that says \"tasty\"?\" \"Mom, what do you need?\" \" I need to talk about something.\" \" Is everything fine?\" \"I'm sorry, but you won't be making food for the big party.\" \"What?\" \"Why?\" \"Your father and I decided to do something else.\" \"That's all.\" \"Something else?\" \"I know you've spent some money.\" \"Yes, we did.\" \"I will give you back all the money.\" \"Just show me the bills.\" \" Okay.\" \" That's all.\" \"That's why I came to tell you.\" \"Okay, thanks for telling me.\" \"You don't need to be upset with me.\" \"I don't?\" \"After you made us do that silly tasting at home?\" \"You told me to treat you like any other company.\" \"But you acted like a queen... making us work hard and writing lots of silly notes... why?\" \"So you could fire us?\" \"Is this because I didn't tell you about the business?\" \"Because, Mom, even for you, this is too much.\" \" I know you're upset.\" \" Yes, I'm upset!\" \"We needed that money.\" \"And I knew that it would be hard... but I did it because I had to... and firing us like this is not right.\" \"I agree, it's not right.\" \"Okay.\" \"Then... if you agree it's wrong, okay.\" \"I'm sorry, Alice.\" \"I really am.\" \"I liked your table.\" \"I liked the food.\" \"I was excited for this party.\" \"I think it might have been the best one I ever did.\" \" So then, what happened?\" \" You know, times change, Alice.\" \"Things that were once nice and fancy... are now seen as old-fashioned.\" \"Like what?\" \"Like small snacks and cocktail parties, and the people who plan them.\" \" Mom, what do you mean?\" \" Nothing.\" \"It's not important.\" \"Mom, please.\" \"Jack decided to take the clients to AC city instead.\" \"He thinks that's what they would like to do.\" \"He could be right, anyway.\" \"What do I know?\" \"Did he know how much work you put into this?\" \"It's really not a big deal, Lily.\" \"I do this for your dad.\" \"I've been doing this for your dad for many years.\" \"If he thinks that Jack's right, then it's okay with me.\" \"And after all, now I don't have to worry about a party.\" \"I can just relax and have fun.\" \" Mom.\" \" Anyway, I need to leave.\" \"I'm wasting all my fun time sitting here talking about this silly party.\" \"Send me those papers and I'll give you a payment.\" \"Okay, great.\" \" Say sorry to Sophia for me, will you?\" \" Sure.\" \"We'll see you girls on the weekend.\" \"My gosh, that's so funny.\" \"That's amazing.\" \"You sound just like him.\" \" Liam.\" \" Wow!\" \"Kevin, what are you doing?\" \" I need your help.\" \" I'm making the coffee here.\" \" Look behind me.\" \" What am I supposed to see, Kevin?\" \" Is she still there?\" \" Who?\" \" Lily.\" \"Is Lily still there?\" \" You mean your friend?\" \"Yes, Lily, my friend.\" \"Who else could I mean?\" \" Pay attention, man.\" \"We don't have much time.\" \" Yes, she's still there.\" \" Are you sure?\" \" Yes, I'm sure.\" \" Now go away from my counter.\" \" I don't know what to do.\" \"What's the problem?\" \"I just looked over there and everything was fine.\" \" Exactly.\" \"Everything looked fine.\" \" So?\" \" Doesn't that seem strange to you?\" \" No.\" \" Really?\" \" Yes, a little.\" \"But so what?\" \"Why worry about it?\" \"Go back over there.\" \"I can't.\" \"I don't understand what's happening.\" \"I mean, she was looking at me, directly at me.\" \"At first I thought I had something on my face... but I cleaned and cleaned, and nothing.\" \" She was just looking at me.\" \" That's good.\" \"I have thought of several things to talk about for the evening...\" \" I haven't used one of them.\" \" You're worrying too much.\" \"This is not how it's supposed to happen.\" \"I'm supposed to take her out, talk about my prepared subjects right away... and then the moment I get up and go to the bathroom... she is supposed to sneak out and leave me here embarrassed.\" \"I've been to the bathroom three times, and I did not have to go... and every time I came back to the table... she was there, and she was happy.\" \"Did she touch my arm?\" \"What was that about?\" \"I think she likes you.\" \"No way!\" \"Yes!\" \"I don't want to argue about you not believing she likes you... because, to be honest, I'm a little unsure why she does.\" \"But the truth is she does.\" \"She does?\" \"Yes, she's laughing and smiling... and get ready, because I think she might touch you again.\" \"Really?\" \" There's a big chance she might.\" \"So my advice is to go back... and keep doing what you've been doing.\" \"I was acting like Jon from a famous movie.\" \" Jon?\" \" Yes, Jon.\" \"You near the end of the movie yet?\" \"No, just getting to a tender moment.\" \"You have a lot left to do.\" \"Go on.\" \"Go back over there.\" \" You think she likes me?\" \" I think she likes you.\" \"You think she likes me.\" \"We all need help.\" \"No, just leave another message that I called.\" \" Thank you.\" \" Number 42, see you.\" \"You don't need to throw them all away.\" \" I didn't.\" \"I have 20 in the freezer.\" \" Great.\" \" And so do you.\" \" Even better.\" \"I already planned to use that money.\" \"It was going for a safer car.\" \"Now little David will have to be careful... in the back of Daddy's truck.\" \" Mom!\" \" Kitchen.\" \"Wait, David.\" \"Daddy has to stop quickly.\" \" You're exaggerating.\" \" But I'm so upset.\" \"I mean, all the planning, all the time, all the broccoli.\" \" I lost my tree.\" \" What?\" \"My study tree?\" \"It's gone.\" \"Someone took it.\" \"Someone took a tree?\" \"No, the tree's still there, but when I went there today... there was a man there reading truck magazines... and he wouldn't leave.\" \"So I'm back where I started.\" \"You'll think of something.\" \"I'll think of another job... 'cause now I can't study, I might not do well at school... and give up all hope of being a news reporter.\" \"This is bad.\" \"You're telling me.\" \"I'm eating broccoli tarts for the next four years.\" \" What should I do?\" \" You are gonna be brave.\" \" What?\" \" You're in school now.\" \"If your learning plan doesn't work, then think of a new one.\" \"Stop whining, because you're a big kid now.\" \"And, Sophia, in old times... kids traveled across the big land in big carts and stayed safe.\" \"I think little David will be okay without his small car.\" \"Why are you upset?\" \"I have a task I have to do.\" \"I'll be back in a short time.\" \"Have these silly pies gone when I return.\" \"Grab a fork.\" \" Hello, David.\" \" Lorelai, you sure grew up nicely.\" \"Did I, David?\" \"Thank you.\" \"Listen, why didn't you answer my calls?\" \" 'Cause I hadn't seen you yet.\" \" Four times.\" \"You never called me back.\" \" I'll call you now.\" \"What's your number?\" \" Just kidding.\" \"Okay.\" \"Did you hear that, Ms. Lily?\" \"'Cause I know how much you like having numbers.\" \" We need to chat.\" \" In my room?\" \"Great.\" \" You know what?\" \"You can leave.\" \" All right.\" \"Good night, Mr. David.\" \"Good night.\" \" Would you like a drink?\" \" No, thanks.\" \" So how are you?\" \" Great.\" \"Okay, no more small talk.\" \"I need to tell you something.\" \"You can't just come into people's lives and take over.\" \"I don't dance at all.\" \"It's not nice and a bit silly.\" \"People were hired for this party, people who were counting on this money.\" \" What party?\" \" The fun party.\" \" That.\" \" Yes, that.\" \"And I have another thing to tell you.\" \"My mom has been planning these silly parties for years... and it wasn't right for you to come in there... and ruin the whole thing, and make her feel old and not useful.\" \"Wait a minute!\" \"I never knew about the party.\" \"They never told me about the party.\" \"Of course they never told you about the party... because they're not thoughtful... and have been that way for years, so they have dibs.\" \"But the minute you found out, you should've canceled your plans.\" \"It was too late for that.\" \"And I never called your mom old, I called parties old.\" \" Same thing.\" \" I don't see how.\" \"Jack, my mom is a busy lady.\" \"She loves to plan these parties, and you made her stop.\" \"You know this.\" \"Your mom does the same.\" \"Think about if you stopped her from planning.\" \"What would she do then?\" \"Spend more time with the pool guy.\" \"You made my mom feel small and embarrassed.\" \"You stopped something she'd been working on for a long time.\" \"But I didn't know.\" \"And then she had to come to my house and tell me I can't help anymore.\" \"Tell you can't help?\" \"Why would she do that?\" \"Because I was the party helper.\" \"No way!\" \"Yes, I help in a small party company.\" \"You help?\" \"I plan.\" \"I didn't know my little weekend was causing so much trouble.\" \"Because you didn't think.\" \"You never thought.\" \"At summer camp, you never thought:\" \"\"If I stand up in this boat, maybe it'll tip over.\"\" \"That was all you thought about.\" \"You're still upset about that.\" \"I had my clothes on.\" \"I remember.\" \"Green shirt, no undershirt.\" \"What?\" \"Trust me, I was the hero of Cabin 5 for the rest of the summer.\" \"You will say sorry to my mom.\" \"Of course.\" \"And you will let her plan that party.\" \"Sorry.\" \"Thomas!\" \"Ursula!\" \"The party is not happening.\" \"Now this is serious.\" \"I will say sorry to Emma, but that's all I can do.\" \"I can't believe you just called me \"Ursula.\"\" \"You called me Thomas three times before I called you Ursula once.\" \"I think that's being patient.\" \"Let my mom plan her party!\" \"I can't do that, but I can take you to dinner tomorrow night.\" \"I'm sorry.\" \"How do those two things go together?\" \"You'd have to know what I'm thinking, but trust me, there was a connection.\" \"I'm not having dinner with you.\" \"Why not?\" \"Because you just made me stop helping.\" \"You just said mean things about my mom.\" \"Interesting.\" \"I didn't know you and your mom were so close.\" \"We're not.\" \"You're being protective of her.\" \"Every family has a silly one.\" \"The silly one's family was mean to him.\" \"What I do with my mom is none of your business.\" \"Then have dinner with me.\" \"No.\" \"Why not?\" \"Because...\" \"Because your mom would not like it.\" \"Yes, my mom would not like it.\" \"Many.\" \"You're not good.\" \"Excuse me.\" \"Do you remember me?\" \"I got here first.\" \" I know.\" \"I just wanted to say I'm sorry about the other day.\" \"I got a little upset because I do that sometimes.\" \"I get too serious, and I just have to change, you know... because we're in school, and school is about change... and you have my study tree, so I have to be okay with that... and just learn to go along.\" \"So, I just wanted to tell you that, and I'm sorry if I bothered you again.\" \"That's okay.\" \"I'll give you $20 for the tree.\" \" You're gonna pay me for the tree?\" \" Go along, man.\" \"You're on.\"", "hash":
