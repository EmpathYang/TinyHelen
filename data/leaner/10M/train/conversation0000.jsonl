want to spend a whole weekend with it.\" \" That makes me feel strange.\" \"Say in your chart, Mars is in a place.\" \"Well, what about when people are born on Mars?\" \"Their Mars isn't in anything

problem is I smell a bit like a sweet food.\" \"Thank you.\" \"We make milk the same way we sweat.\" \"And I hardly ever sweat.\" \"Maybe that's why it was so hard for me at first.\" \"I wish I got

\"Maybe you have some feelings you want to share?\" \"Yes.\" \"I don't like my job.\" \"I feel like a loser driving around in a safety uniform, answering alarms set off by little dogs, and being nice to rich people who earn more in one day than I do in a whole year.\" \"I should be able to relax when I get home without you thinking it's about you because it's very rarely about you.\" \" David?\" \" I don't think that's fair.\" \"You don't want me to have any feelings.\" \"No, I just want us to have fun sometimes like we used to.\" \" We don't have fun?\" \" Not much.\" \"Not much?\" \"Sometimes.\" \"How's your love life?\" \"It's really good.\" \"Yes, that part is fine.\" \"So it seems being passionate is easy in that area but not in others.\" \"What other things do the two of you like to do together?\" \"We sometimes go to see movies.\" \"We go out to eat.\" \"We used to play a game with a ball and a racket.\" \"He was so much better than me it was funny.\" \"I wasn't challenging enough.\" \" I never said that.\" \" It made me feel not good enough.\" \"What kinds of things do you do by yourself?\" \" Besides work, I exercise.\" \" Yes.\" \"My job kind of stops me from doing much else.\" \"Friends?\" \"Most of my friends are police officers.\" \"But I don't see them any more since I left the job.\" \" David didn't really have many close friends.\" \" That's not true.\" \"There's a group of people who run their own funeral homes that I meet with every month.\" \"You don't like those guys.\" \"We're out of time.\" \"This week, if any problems come up, try to

is my special girl today?\" \"She has the hiccups again.\" \"She gets that from her daddy.\" \"He was a very burpy baby.\" \"Yes, he was.\" \"I'll get her some water.\" \" Do you burp her often when she's eating?\" \" Of course.\" \"What's wrong with you?\" \"Uh, I don't know.\" \"I think I just had the strangest feeling of something happening again.\" \"Hello!\" \"Every time I come by, there are more people here.\" \"Hi.\" \"I'm Charlotte, Lily's boss.\" \"I'm Rachel, Nathan's mom.\" \"We've met a few times.\" \"You're not living here now too, are you?\" \"I'm joking.\" \"Relax.\" \"I don't like to keep saying this.\" \"I parked in the driveway again.\" \"There are two cars today.\" \"Sorry, I didn't know.\" \"Oh, please, it's okay.\" \"I'm sure you didn't know.\" \"What's your reason?\" \"I was just dropping off...\" \"I could get a sign made.\" \"\"Nathan, back it up.\" \"Put it on the street.\"\" \"I'm joking.\" \"If you want, I'll move it right now.\" \"Don't be silly.\" \"Whenever.\" \"Doesn't matter.\" \"Sooner is better.\" \"Lily, I'm having dinner with Penelope tonight so I want you to cook.\" \"OK.\" \"But I'm having some friends over tomorrow.\" \"I'm trying a new idea on friends.\" \"Shouldn't be more than... 30.\" \"OK.\" \"Do you have time to go over a menu with me?\" \"Now?\" \"Yes!\" \"Take your time, dear.\" \"I've got all afternoon.\" \"Nice to meet you, Nathan's mom!\" \"She's energetic.\" \"She's a bit crazy.\" \"Hey, Ryan.\" \"Nathan, hey.\" \"How's it going?\" \"Good.\" \"Good, good, I'm glad to hear it.\" \"Listen, I don't know if you're aware, but we have two viewings tonight.\" \"One in the evening, and one a bit later.\" \"Yeah, I'm on my way.\" \"Good.\" \"Because your brother is nowhere to be found.\" \"And he's not answering his phone.\" \"And there's only so much I can do.\" \"Sure.\" \"I can't be in two places at once.\" \"I get it, Ryan, OK?\" \"Stop the lecturing.\" \"I'm not your kid.\" \"I'm not your worker, I'm your partner.\" \"I am a funeral director now.\" \"OK?\" \"You guys took my money, you made me a partner, it's time you treated me like one.\" \"Goodbye.\" \"So, Charlotte, how's school?\" \"It's OK.\" \"What kind of stuff are you doing?\" \"Well, yesterday, we had to draw this man in a short time.\" \"Well, that sounds fun.\" \"Not really.\" \"It's tough.\" \"And, I don't want to be a drawer or painter.\" \"But they say we need to learn all, like an artist named Patrick.\" \"It's a lot.\" \"But you can make new things every day.\" \"Good morning.\" \"Hey!\" \"Hello, friend.\" \"How are you?\" \"I'm very happy.\" \"Look at this little girl!\" \"Isn't she lovely?\" \"She has a little runny nose.\" \"Who's adorable, is it you?\" \"Yes, it is.\" \"Can you help with her today?\" \"Lisa has to help Charlotte.\" \"Charlotte's having a big dinner.\" \"Of course.\" \"Guys, she made a funny poop this morning.\" \"Who, Lisa?\" \"Really.\" \"It was so well formed, so healthy.\" \"It seemed like a grown-up poop.\" \"It made me so happy.\" \"When you live with a baby you see the world as being completely new again.\" \"They're so pure.\" \"It's a joy.\" \"Why haven't any of you visited recently?\" \"Because being a dad has made you silly.\" \"Wow.\" \"You're so strong and cool.\" \"I wish I was you.\" \"Does anybody want the last piece?\" \"Oh, Adam.\" \"Can you take Mrs. Fiona to the place where they burn bodies this afternoon?\" \"No.\" \"I have to go to the funeral of a person named Patrick.\" \"Well, I have the funeral of a person named Benjamin.\" \"Can't Ryan do it?\" \"He said, \"No way, I'm not your helper anymore.\"\" \"Charlotte, can you help us?\" \"Sorry, I have homework.\" \"I'll give you 50 dollars.\" \"You'd pay a delivery service more than that.\" \"All right.\" \"As long as I don't have to touch any dead skin.\" \"She's all packed up.\" \"I can't do it till later, because I have to practice drawing a circle.\" \"That takes a long time?\" \"I have to be able to do it any time in class tomorrow.\" \"It's not as easy as it sounds.\" \"Is that the box that needs to go to the place where they burn bodies?\" \"The box?\" \"Yes.\" \"Well, I can take it now.\" \"You're taking it?\" \"Yes.\" \"They asked me to do it since nobody else wants to.\" \"Really?\" \"Sure, for 50 toys.\" \"But you'll need to help me put that in my car.\" \"What kind of songs do you play?\" \"It's like the early songs of Patrick meets Thomas.\" \"Just like Sophia's Day but aware, like Patrick's Friends.\" \"We're still making it better.\" \"Let me know when you play.\" \"I'll come.\" \"Why not stay, while we practice?\" \"I don't think I can.\" \"I have a thing, I'm supposed to...\" \"Ok.\" \"I'm Patrick.\" \"I'm Charlotte.\" \"Do you want a drink?\" \"Sure.\" \"You're amazing, Lisa.\" \"Why?\" \"Your energy.\" \"It's endless.\" \"You could be like a sun.\" \"You'd light up the world.\" \"That's funny because...\" \"I feel tired all the time.\" \"Really?\" \"Yes.\" \"I think it's because I'm a mom.\" \"Yes.\" \"But I don't mind.\" \"I mean, Madison has changed my life.\" \"I can't even think about how things were before.\" \"Wow.\" \"So what if I have to work a bit more?\" \"I want to.\" \"It's worth it.\" \"It is so worth it.\" \"Charlotte?\" \"Don't mind me.\" \"I'm just a bit scared.\" \"Scared about this meeting next week.\" \"I have to talk to Matthew in person.\" \"Oh, he is scary.\" \"Can I make you some tea?\" \"For goodness sake, I'm not your grandma.\" \"I'm your boss.\" \"Stop looking at me, Lisa.\" \"Charlotte, I'm always here for you.\" \"Also, I swim in the morning.\" \"I used to be able to do that without clothes.\" \"Which was a good way to start the day.\" \"Like I was Alice.\" \"I went out feeling like a warrior, a hunter, which is what you have to do in my work.\" \"Now I can't do that any more because there's a man here.\" \"I'm sure Nathan wouldn't mind.\" \"I would.\" \"I don't like the way he parks in the driveway.\" \"I'm sorry.\" \"I will talk to him about it.\" \"I'm going to swim some laps.\" \"Are you ready for the food?\" \"Yes.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"Adding pepper.\" \"I already put pepper.\" \"OK, I feel silly.\" \"What?\" \"When you said, \"I put some pepper.\"\" \"I thought you were upset with me for not knowing, and you were cross with me. I shouldn't have done it.\" \"Why would I be cross with you?\" \"Perhaps you don't want me to help cook.\" \"Maybe you just want me to get the food ready, you want to be the only one cooking.\" \"So we put a bit more pepper in the pan - it's not a big thing.\" \"I know it's not a big thing.\" \"OK.\" \"I heard you.\" \"I didn't want to make you feel bad.\" \"I know.\" \"Good.\" \"I love you.\" \"Are the carrots ready?\" \"In my home, people would show they were upset all the time.\" \"So that's what closeness feels like to me.\" \"In your home, nobody showed their feelings.\" \"We also never hit each other.\" \"So when I'm a little upset, it scares you?\" \"Yes.\" \"It just means I'm at ease with you.\" \"It doesn't mean I don't love you.\" \"Did you get the cleaning today?\" \"Yes, it's in the cupboard.\" \"There.\" \"Isn't it yummy?\" \"Your daddy liked peanut butter too.\" \"Yes, he did.\" \"So did your uncle David.\" \"But not your aunt Charlotte.\" \"She really didn't like it, always didn't.\" \"Still doesn't.\" \"Isn't it funny?\" \"They were all little babies once too.\" \"But their daddy's mommy didn't like spending time with them like I enjoy spending time with you.\" \"She never really liked me, and she didn't like my children.\" \"She thought I had a baby on purpose to make Nathan marry me.\" \"Which wasn't true at all.\" \"I didn't want that to happen.\" \"Especially when I was so young.\" \"I was scared when your daddy was born.\" \"Really scared.\" \"Hello, Mom.\" \" Oh, you scared me.\" \" Did she cause any problems?\" \"No way.\" \"She's an angel.\" \"Ready to go home, angel?\" \"I cooked a chicken for you.\" \"No, thanks, I need to go home.\" \"But... put it in the fridge.\" \"I'll eat it tomorrow.\" \"If you and Lily want a break, I'd be happy to watch her.\" \"You could go out, watch a movie.\" \"I could keep her here overnight.\" \"Thanks, but Lily's working tonight and Maya hasn't slept outside our bed yet.\" \"Maybe it would be good for her to try sleeping by herself at night.\" \"Mom, we know what you think.\" \"You've made it very clear.\" \"We feel differently.\" \"She's almost nine months old.\" \"She needs to start sleeping alone sometime.\" \"Madison will tell us when she's ready to leave, okay?\" \"Good night.\" \"Good night, Grandma.\" \"Good night.\" \"Are we going to hug?\" \"Okay.\" \"Let me take a bath first.\" \"Morning.\" \"What time is it?\" \"Just before ten, I think.\" \"How do you like your drink?\" \"Plain.\" \"What do you have to do today?\" \"Class.\" \"What class?\" \"Drawing class.\" \"We're learning how to draw a perfect circle.\" \"That sounds fun.\" \"It's not.\" \"It's boring and hard.\" \"And pointless.\" \"I went to art school to be creative, not to do some pointless task like a mouse.\" \"Do you want to skip class?\" \"Yes.\" \"Nathan, I need you to help me with a big task and cover the FR funeral today.\" \"Who's Frank?\" \"Frank who?\" \"Frank.\" \"He's in the date book every Wednesday at two.\" \"I have no idea.\" \"Must be someone Ryan added.\" \"There's a phone number.\" \"I'm gonna call and find out.\" \"Okay, no.\" \"Kevin and I are getting help.\" \"Really?\" \"It's not a big deal.\" \"Are you guys okay?\" \"Of course we're okay.\" \"We're just getting advice from a professional to help us set rules and boundaries for our relationship.\" \"What happened?\" \"Nothing happened.\" \"Kevin has anger problems he got from his dad and I have issues I got from Mom.\" \"Can we never talk about this again?\" \"Sure.\" \"You're okay though?\" \"Can we never talk about this again?\" \"Got it.\" \"And how are you and Lily?\" \"We're great.\" \"It's still a little strange to me.\" \"All the ways my life could have gone.\" \"I mean, just about a year ago I got engaged.\" \"Do you remember that?\" \"I thought I loved Bella.\" \"Maybe I thought I could make it work just by trying really hard.\" \"But... you just never know.\" \"You have no idea what life will bring.\" \"So can you cover the FR funeral for me or not?\" \"Are you sure you're okay?\" \"I'm okay.\" \"I'm going to sing for a group in LA.\" \"Really?\" \"That sounds fun.\" \"I want to do something new besides work and my friends.\" \"I hope you'll support me.\" \"Okay.\" \"Don't worry.\" \"The Folger thing's easy.\" \"You just do your best.\" \"No joke intended.\" \"I'm very nervous.\" \"David, you'll do well.\" \"I hope so.\" \"Okay.\" \"Thank you, Nathan.\" \"Anytime.\" \"Hello.\" \"Hi, it's Lisa.\" \"Hello.\" \"Rachel, did you give Maya peanut butter?\" \"Yes, and she liked it.\" \"Nathan...\" \"You shouldn't give babies peanut butter if they're under one year old.\" \"They can get bad allergies.\" \"Didn't you know that?\" \"No, I didn't.\" \"Is she okay?\" \"Yes, but that's not what matters.\" \"You should never give her peanut butter.\" \"Or honey, or strawberries, or egg whites.\" \"I see.\" \"Of course.\" \"I'm sorry if I'm being too direct.\" \"No, I'm sorry.\" \"I didn't know.\" \"Peanut butter was never a problem when my children were little.\" \"Are you sure she's okay?\" \"She's okay.\" \"Do you need any help with her today?\" \"I could visit.\" \"Rachel, no.\" \"You come here a lot.\" \"I feel bad.\" \"It's okay, I like...\" \"Really, take some time for yourself.\" \"I barely saw Maya yesterday.\" \"I really wanted it to be just us two today.\" \"Okay.\" \"But thank you.\" \"I'll talk to you later.\" \"Thank goodness.\" \"It's very scary.\" \"I didn't know who to call.\" \"Ma'am, calm down and tell me what happened.\" \"Come.\" \"I'll show you.\" \"It's strange when you learn things like that when you're older.\" \"I mean, I had no idea that I was unexpected.\" \"I'm not sure what difference it makes.\" \"I mean, we didn't plan for Maya and we couldn't love her more.\" \"It's just...\" \"I don't know.\" \"What?\" \"I don't like knowing that I'm here by accident.\" \"It's just too... unpredictable.\" \"Yes, but that's what happened.\" \"Things happen for a reason, Nathan.\" \"See, that's a kind of belief that I don't agree with.\" \"What if we choose differently?\" \"We always choose.\" \"What if your parents didn't want to get married because of you?\" \"Then you, Charlotte and David wouldn't be here.\" \"That's not supposed to happen.\" \"But aren't we more than just things that happen?\" \"Maybe we are, maybe we're not.\" \"I like it when she does that.\" \"When she moves a little.\" \"Just before she sleeps.\" \"She wakes up.\" \"You were scared the first time she did it.\" \"I remember feeling like I was falling when I was little.\" \"Like I was falling from my bed.\" \"It always woke me up.\" \"Like I was scared of what...\" \"You were going to fall into?\" \"Yes.\" \"It doesn't happen to me now.\" \"Don't be too sure.\" \"What's happening with you?\" \"I think I dreamed this.\" \"What?\" \"This moment.\" \"Just this.\" \"The life we have.\" \"You and me, Madison.\" \"Here.\" \"Now.\"

shouldn't be too hard.\" \"Actually, Agent Jack, that's what I wanted to talk with you about.\" \"This is one of the messiest cases I've worked.\" \"And believe me, Judge knows it.\" \"Your Agent Taylor messed up the search paper.\" \"The taking of those pictures from his house was not good.\" \"I hope you and Frank didn't mess up that talk... because if he puts those words away, we're done.\" \"I am telling you that he did not ask for a lawyer in that car.\" \"No disrespect, but given your past with this judge...\" \"I'd prefer if Martin was the one to say that.\" \"I'm okay with that.\" \"Both of you, leave!\" \"There's a danger in the building!\" \" Drop the gun!\" \" It's your choice, Jack.\" \"Okay.\" \"I didn't do anything bad.\" \"I know.\" \"Okay?\" \"I was just trying... to get everyone out of the building.\" \"Come on, friend.\" \"Please put down your toy gun.\" \"No, don't do that!\" \"Agent Adam.\" \"In your opinion... could we have stopped Anwar's bad thing from happening?\" \"With what we knew... that this man had done bad things before... that there might be a scary thing at the home...\" \"I think that the team acted right.\" \"Yes.\" \"Once you were stuck in that room, it was the end.\" \"But I'm thinking if you've thought... about why things went that far.\" \"I try not to think again.\" \"Really?\" \"As I read the story of this case you've thought a lot again.\" \"And that's good, I think.\" \"I don't understand what you mean.\" \"In his note, Ben suggests... that you and Agent David... didn't agree about why Agent David wasn't helping more... with the team.\" \"There was a small thing over a picture.\" \"I showed the picture to Ben before I showed it to Agent David.\" \"That was not right.\" \"He told me that.\" \"We talked about it.\" \"Did Agent David think he was the only one good enough to look at that clue?\" \"He thought we shouldn't quickly think that Dr. Samir was a bad man.\" \"This wasn't about who's in charge.\" \"It was about how we tell things.\" \"Really?\" \"If anyone thought too quickly in the Samir case, it was me.\" \"I did some things wrong.\" \"Mistakes which may have caused Dr. Samir to go away.\" \"And I'm gonna have to think about that.\" \"You've got nothing to worry about from me.\" \"That's not what I meant.\" \"I think I have everything I need now.\" \"Thanks for helping.\" \"How did it go?\" \"It went okay.\" \"Jack is a very good agent... and I understand why you like him, son.\" \"But he's a risk taker.\" \"Sometimes risk takers do great things.\" \"But a lot of the time, they fail.\" \"So what are you telling me?\" \"Jack has done some things wrong lately... and people have noticed.\" \"I just want you to know what I think.\" \"And I want you to be careful, Matthew.\" \"Hi, Madison, is my dad in?\" \"Okay.\" \"No, tell him to call me when he returns.\" \"Yes.\" \"Thank you.\" \"He's trying to make it seem like you were hiding information... so you could be the hero.\" \"That's silly.\" \"What's silly is you telling me... about your secret talk with an investigator.\" \"He was trying to trick me, taking things out of context, changing facts.\" \"That's his job.\" \"This isn't about the team.\" \"It's about you.\" \"I appreciate you trying to help, but I can take care of myself.\" \"You look good.\" \"I wish I could say the same for you.\" \"I heard they don't like people who hurt children in jail.\" \"I thought we agreed.\" \"We did.\" \"We were in the car.\" \"And it was raining a lot.\" \"I could hardly see out the window.\" \"After a little while...\" \"I realized we were not going to NE city.\" \"Matthew, turn left here.\" \"That's not the way to the big road.\" \"What did you do when you knew the men weren't taking you to the city?\" \"Of course, I was worried.\" \"I told them right away that I wanted a lawyer.\" \"And I would only answer questions when I had one.\" \"Did they stop asking you questions?\" \"No.\" \"They kept asking me for the next two hours.\" \"I get you, Gabriel, I do.\" \"I've been to that school.\" \"I've seen those lovely boys.\" \"Their lovely bodies.\" \"To hold all that goodness in your arms.\" \"But here's what I'm going to do.\" \"I'm going to let you have 15 minutes with him, if you tell me where he is.\" \"You can do whatever you want.\" \"Mr. Samuel, before getting in the car with Agents Matthew and Frank... had you asked for a lawyer?\" \"Yes.\" \"When I was in jail in a place... they told me that I was going to be given to the big officers.\" \"I thought to myself, \"I've done my best to help, but this is too much.\"\" \"There was a police officer there.\" \"I told him I wanted a lawyer.\" \"Like I said... since I was not at the hospital the day Dr. Samuel was hurt...\" \"I don't feel good... talking about what happened that day.\" \"Yes, you did say that.\" \"Thank you.\" \"But I'm wondering, Agent Taylor... during your looking into things... did you personally believe that Dr. Samuel was a bad person?\" \"Personally believe?\" \"No.\" \"Did we think about it?\" \"Yes.\" \"Did Adam believe it?\" \"Maybe you should ask Adam.\" \"Alice, on a different topic... do you remember someone named...\" \"Gabriel, a small helper, I think.\" \"Is it Gabriel?\" \"Yes, it's Gabriel.\" \"He was not nice.\" \"He did bad things.\" \"And I caught him.\" \"Sadly, this Mr. Gabriel complained about you.\" \"In detail.\" \"You never met him.\" \"Did Adam agree with this way of asking questions?\" \"The complaint was thrown away.\" \"Nothing's ever really gone in the office, Alice.\" \"Let me see.\" \"We have another story here... about a man named Robert.\" \"You don't mind if I take a piece of your hair, do you?\" \"You touching my hair, man!\" \"I got it.\" \"Are you ready to tell me the truth?\" \"I didn't do it, man!\" \"He deserved it, too?\" \"What is this about?\" \"This is about making things better here, Alice.\" \"I want you to think hard about that, go home come back tomorrow... we'll talk some more about the Samuel story... and Adam.\" \"Could you hear the talk between Mr. Sam and Adam...\" \" during your entire ride?\" \" Yes, I could.\" \"And at any time during the ride did Mr. Sam ask for a helper?\" \"No, he did not.\" \"Did he ever talk about a helper, someone to speak for him, a representative of any kind?\" \" No, he did not.\" \" Your turn.\" \"Frank, when you say he never asked for a helper during the ride... are you saying it's possible he could have asked for a helper at some other time?\" \"I'm saying he never asked for a helper at any time.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Nothing else.\" \"Your Honor, at this time... we'd like to call Officer Thomas of the city police.\" \"Who is that?\" \"I have no idea.\" \"I just got a call from Charlotte's parents.\" \"They heard a story on the radio that we had found their daughter.\" \" But we don't know that yet?\" \" I know.\" \" What did you tell them?\" \" Pretty much that.\" \"I said we were still checking.\" \" We didn't know anything for sure.\" \" Oh, jeez.\" \"How'd it go?\" \"We're not supposed to talk about it, so let's not talk about it, okay?\" \"If the big rule is after Jack, we all need to wait our turn.\" \"You should tell that to Matthew.\" \"What?\" \"What does that mean?\" \"It means that Frank asked me lots of questions for a long time... and didn't mention Agent Fitzgerald once.\" \"So?\" \"You forgot Matthew was the leader of the \"Anwar is a bad person\" group?\" \"Okay, David, he was just doing his work.\" \"You know, guys, we need to stick together.\" \"That's exactly what I mean.\" \"We don't have Dad protecting us from far away.\" \"We don't.\" \"I'm not going to tell on anyone, okay?\" \"I hope Matthew can do the same.\" \"But that mean person is searching for trouble, and I won't get in trouble for this.\" \"Officer Henry, have you ever seen the person, Gabriel?\" \"Yes, last autumn.\" \"I worked at our holding place in WE town.\" \"They had him for a few wrong things with a young person.\" \"During that time, did Mr. Gabriel ever ask for a lawyer?\" \" Yes, he did.\" \" Can you tell more?\" \"When he knew that the big officers were going to take him to NE city... he told me if the big officers were going to be involved... he thought he should have a lawyer.\" \"Did you tell anyone at the big officer's place about Mr. Gabriel's request for a lawyer?\" \"Yes, I called the NE city office, spoke with an Agent Victoria.\" \"I told her that the person was ready to move... and that he asked for a lawyer.\" \"Officer Henry, other than Agent Victoria... did you ever tell anyone else at the big officer's place... about Mr. Gabriel's request for a lawyer?\" \" Yes, I did.\" \" And who was that?\" \"Agent Matthew Fitzgerald.\" \"Please tell when and how you let...\" \"Agent Matthew know about Mr. Gabriel's request?\" \"When I spoke with Agent Victoria... she told me I needed to plan the person's move... with Agent Matthew who was going to take him.\" \"She gave me his phone number, asked me to call him and plan it.\" \" And did you call Agent Matthew?\" \" Yes, I did.\" \"Yes, we got him.\" \"He's in the holding place all tidy.\" \"You're not getting anything from him.\" \"The person asked for a lawyer as soon as he knew you were coming.\" \"What did Agent Matthew say... when you told him about Mr. Gabriel's request?\" \"He said, \"Okay,\" and stopped the call.\" \"A little later, they came and put him in the car.\" \"Thank you, helper.\" \"Ms. Rachel?\" \"For the leaders?\" \"Nothing now, your Honor.\" \"So your words are... you think Officer Matthew's work on the Sam case...\" \" was both good and professional.\" \" Yes.\" \"And that you two had no disagreements...\" \" about how to handle things.\" \" Not really, no.\" \"Well, according to Officer Matthew's own report... you talked to him about your worry... about being too quick to think that Sam was a bad guy.\" \"We might have talked about it.\" \"Could you tell me about your talk, please?\" \"I think you're making a mistake.\" \"I think that you were too quick to call in the JT group.\" \"That's my decision.\" \"But just think about it.\" \"After this... do you think Anwar will be able to work in his field?\" \"It's not my problem.\" \"If this is making you upset, I can move you to another case.\" \"Threatening to move you... because you questioned one of his choices?\" \"In cases like this, feelings can be quite strong, Officer Fiona.\" \"I'm sure they are.\" \"One more thing, Officer Sam.\" \"Have you and Officer Matthew ever been more than friends?\" \"Excuse me?\" \"Unless you'll avoid the question, it's a simple question.\" \" You don't have the right to ask me that.\" \" Actually, I do.\" \"Rules of the helpers...\" \"Section 23:\" \"\"A leading helper,\" that would be Officer Matthew...\" \"\"is not allowed to be more than friends...\" \"\"with a helper who works directly for him.\"\" \" That'd be you.\" \" I won't answer this.\" \"We are not finished!\" \" Sophia\" \" Officer Sam.\" \"Officer Sam.\" \"I don't mean to be rude... when I say I think we can all understand the pressures of this job.\" \"Especially the challenges a new helper might face, say... if she were talked to by a boss... a man in a very sad marriage... longing for the closeness he wasn't getting at home.\" \"In this light, the helper's actions would be understandable.\" \"However, not answering, or lying about such a relationship... would not be okay.\" \"I don't know who that helper is.\" \"I promise he never called me.\" \"I know.\" \"I'm glad you believe me, because I don't think Judge Alice does.\" \"I mean, really, Jack, I don't know what happened in there.\" \"That guy never called me.\" \"I know he didn't.\" \"He called me.\" \"What?\" \"He called me.\" \"When?\" \"When we were in NE city.\" \"We were waiting to do something.\" \"I was talking with Victoria... and you went to get a drink or something.\" \"Just wait a moment.\" \"Matthew, your phone.\" \"Wait a moment, Victoria, I just need to get this.\" \"Yes.\" \"I have your person ready for you.\" \"He's in the room all tidy and nice.\" \"You're not getting anything out of him.\" \"Guy got a lawyer as soon as he heard you were coming.\" \"Okay?\" \"Okay.\" \"Thanks.\" \"Why didn't you tell me this before?\" \"It wouldn't change anything for you or the problem.\" \"Are you joking?\" \"It seems like I lied.\" \"I was hoping that they wouldn't find that man.\" \"I'm sorry, there was no other way.\" \"Even if I knew the truth, I'd have come to help the boy.\" \"That wasn't enough.\" \"I needed to know that you would tell.\" \"What, by lying to me?\" \"Was there a choice?\" \"Lie or let the problem go.\" \"That should've been my choice.\" \"You had no right to hide things from me.\" \"We're supposed to be a team!\" \"I just couldn't take the risk.\" \"Don't you understand?\" \"I put myself at risk for you with Frank.\" \"You just can't make up the rules as you go along, Jack.\" \"He asked me about us.\" \"He had all this stuff.\" \"Records of nights that we left together.\" \"Phone logs.\" \"What did you say?\" \"I told him it wasn't true.\" \"You have no idea of what he knows or doesn't know.\" \"That's his advantage.\" \"That's how he wins.\" \"I was trying to protect you.\" \"But you didn't have to lie.\" \"Even if he had proof, there's nothing he could do.\" \"We broke at least a few rules.\" \"And lying to a man could get you in trouble.\" \"And being with a person under your command... could get you in trouble.\" \"I'm sorry I lied.\" \"I was just trying to help you.\" \"You want to get me in trouble, fine.\" \"Give it your best try.\" \"We weren't supposed to meet.\" \"You come into my home and bother my people...\" \"you better not miss, you little bug.\" \"Leave now.\" \"This is where I work, you little bug.\" \"This is where I work!\" \"And not the nice things that you do!\" \"I don't look at people's trash!\" \"Are you being mean to me?\" \"You take it any way you want.\" \"Officer Frank.\" \"Are you ready?\" \"I think now is a good time for me.\" \"We couldn't find a match with Charlotte's teeth.\" \"So we're gonna check her hair.\" \"Tough day in school?\" \"Yeah, thanks to Jack.\" \"That's nice.\" \"Is that what you told Frank?\" \"You should be careful what you say.\" \"That's good advice.\" \"Maybe you should've listened to it before you went into Frank's room... and told on me.\" \"Told on me?\" \"How did he find out that I was mean to Roger?\" \"I didn't say anything about that.\" \"Right.\" \"Come on, you only bragged to half the class about it.\" \"How do you think he heard?\" \"By the way, if we don't find Sam...\" \"you can take some credit for that.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"If you hadn't taken those pictures without asking... we wouldn't be in trouble.\" \"Why don't you ask your dad about it?\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"The easy time you get here.\" \"Give me a break.\" \"Everybody knows the school doesn't just randomly pick its kids.\" \"Someone told that dog to chase Jack.\" \"If you ask me... there's a big boss in WA city that knows exactly why.\" \"Would you say Officer Matthew was not nice...\" \" with Adam and the group?\" \"No.\" \"Did you see any disagreement between Adam and Officer Matthew?\" \"I did not.\" \"You're very loyal, aren't you, Officer Jessica?\" \"Is that a question?\" \"It's an observation.\" \"You've done very well at school.\" \"I've done okay.\" \"You're being humble.\" \"Four good behavior awards, several certificates of achievement\" \"Officer Frank, if this is the time when you suggest... that I could do better in school if I agree with you... don't even go there.\" \"I'm very happy where I am.\" \"Well, that's not so true, is it?\" \"I see a number of applications for team leader positions... inquiry letters of unit heads at several places.\" \"Truth is, you do want to do better, don't you?\" \"I was looking for opportunities.\" \"And you should.\" \"There's nothing wrong with wanting to do better.\" \"Now, Taylor and Samuel... they're young, still happy to be students.\" \"They get excited every time they show the badge.\" \"It's easy stuff.\" \"But you.\" \"You have a family to think about.\" \"And I want you to know, WA city's very aware...\" \" and should a job open up\" \" Agent Frank... there is no way I'm gonna help you take down Jack.\" \"Agent Adam...\" \"Jack is going down, with you or without you.\" \"It's your choice.\" \"I'm telling you, Jack, Matthew's story is not trusted.\" \"You have the word of a big-city officer against a little-town officer.\" \"How could it not be trusted?\" \"A little-town officer with no reason to lie... before a judge who is just about at his limit, that's how.\" \"Okay.\" \"Here's what we do.\" \"We say Frank might have known of the ask... but according to the record, he never questioned Sam.\" \"You did the whole question, right?\" \"Yes.\" \"So, we put you up there.\" \"You say you didn't know about the ask for a helper.\" \"Even that officer doesn't say you knew.\" \"Jack, we have no choice.\" \"Either you get up there and you say... you had no idea Sam asked for the helper, or he goes.\" \"You can say that, right?\" \"Yes, I can do that.\" \"Thanks a lot, guys.\" \"I know these are boring, but early morning tea time tomorrow.\" \"See you then.\" \"I hope this is not another one of your surprise questions.\" \" Why're you doing this?\" \" Excuse me?\" \"You know what I'm talking about.\" \"This big investigation has your prints all over it, Dad.\" \"Is that how it works in your world?\" \"Somebody has to be the bad guy?\" \"Or do you not like Jack?\" \"I want you to be quiet now, and listen to me.\" \"Yes, I was told that the NE city office... was gonna be held accountable for the passing of Anwar.\" \"I did not agree with that, but that's what the big guys wanted.\" \"I also did not agree... with the officer they had chosen to blame in this process.\" \"The young officer who, by all accounts...\" \"led the charge to have Dr. Anwar considered a bad guy.\" \"I was the target.\" \"Luckily, there was something I could do about it.\" \"So I suggested they refocus the investigation\" \"Refocus the investigation onto Jack.\" \"Given what's happened in the past few months, Matthew... it wasn't that hard.\" \"You're wrong about Jack.\" \"He's a great officer, and you're gonna ruin his career.\" \"I'm keeping you safe.\" \"When will you understand that I don't need your help?\" \"Just stay away from me.\" \"Jack, you must not.\" \"Yeah, you just watch me.\" \"You can't tell lies.\" \"You think I'm gonna let Samuel go?\" \"He hurts and scares kids.\" \"He's done it twice, he'll do it again.\" \"So could you be okay with that?\" \"I can be okay with one less scary person on the street.\" \"You lose your sense of good, and there's one less good person.\" \"I think there'll be one less of me anyway.\" \"If I'm going down, I'm taking Samuel with me.\" \"Okay, we know that Frank's not nice.\" \"But he can't win unless you let him.\" \"What do you want me to do, Victoria?\" \"I am in trouble either way.\" \"I know.\" \" I gotta go home.\" \" So go.\" \"Agent Matthew... are you the only one who talked to Mr. Samuel during that ride?\" \"Yes.\" \" Did you ever hear him ask for a lawyer?\" \" No.\" \" Did he ever talk about a lawyer?\" \" No, he did not.\" \" Did you mention a lawyer to him?\" \" No, I didn't.\" \"You know, Agent Matthew, that Mr. Samuel has said... that he asked for a lawyer many times during the ride?\" \"I would say that Mr. Samuel's words are not true.\" \"Thank you.\" \"No more questions.\" \"Your witness.\" \"Actually, Ms. Rachel, I am not done talking.\" \"I'm sorry, I said no more questions.\" \" There is something else I need to talk about.\" \" Thank you\" \"Phone talk between Officer Henry and Agent Frank... about Mr. Samuel's asking for a lawyer.\" \"Your Honor, I've finished my questions.\" \"Then I'll continue.\" \" Your Honor, if I\" \" Ms. Rachel, thank you.\" \"Go on, Agent Matthew.\" \"Do you have any reason to not believe Officer Henry's words?\" \" Yes, Your Honor, I do.\" \" And why is that?\" \"Because I'm the one who took the call from Officer Henry.\" \"Please continue, Agent Matthew.\" \"You have my full attention.\" \" Mr. Frank.\" \" Yes.\" \"You suggested I come back today if I thought again?\" \" And you did?\" \" I did.\" \"So did my friends.\" \"We think we understand your Rights form now.\" \"You have the right to be unhappy.\" \"And we have the right to tell you to stop.\" \"Have you lost your common sense?\" \"You should go home now.\" \"I'll leave when I am done with my job.\" \"Go ahead.\" \"And that was all.\" \"Adam was exactly where Mr. Sam had pointed.\" \"He's not well, but he will be okay.\" \"Agent Matthew.\" \"Is it my turn now?\" \"Your turn is over.\" \"You broke this man's right to be questioned... with a lawyer.\" \"What were you thinking?\" \"I can tell you exactly what I thought.\" \"I thought it was very cold in the CO Caves... and that there was a scared young man in one of them... treated badly and given bad medicine... so that Mr. Sam could do bad things to him.\" \"I thought if I returned to NE city... so Mr. Sam could talk to his lawyer...\" \"Adam would be gone by the time I came back.\" \"I can also tell you what I did not think about.\" \"I did not think about his rights.\" \"I did not think about hiding evidence, or even this trial.\" \"That's the job of this place.\" \"And this place will decide what it will decide.\" \"But I can say this, without a doubt:\" \"Given the same situation, I would do exactly the same thing.\" \"Because my main job was to save Adam.\" \"That's my job.\" \"So you guys just destroyed them?\" \"Frank had the original ones.\" \"We destroyed copies.\" \"It was more of a sign.\" \"I appreciate the sign and the meaning.\" \" You were right, you know.\" \" About what?\" \"It was wrong to lie to Frank.\" \"Not as wrong as what I just did in there.\" \"I think I let a bad guy go free, and I lost my job, all at once.\" \"When Frank asked me about us... my first thought was to tell him the truth.\" \"Because it's been really hard for me... not telling anyone.\" \"Being around you all the time... and pretending like nothing ever happened, you know?\" \"I know.\" \"I don't think I was lying to protect you.\" \"I think, in that moment, I thought:\" \"\"Maybe if I say this, if everybody knows...\" \"\"then it really will be over.\"\" \"It is over, isn't it?\" \"Yes, it's over.\" \"Do you have a moment?\" \"Yes.\" \" Any news from the place?\" \"No way,\" said Jack. \"You should've told me about the officer.\" \"You should've told me you were taking David to the caves.\" \"I couldn't let him get hurt.\" \"This is your responsibility, Jack.\" \"I thought this job was important.\" \"I gave up my time with family and friends.\" \"But today, I almost did something bad, and guess what?\" \"It's not worth it.\" \"I quit my job.\" \"Good luck, friend.\" \"Thank you.\" \"When everything is over, and we are looking for something new to do...\" \"I think we would work well together.\" \"Selling shoes?\" \"Shoes, boots, high-heels.\" \"Sounds good to me.\" \"Dad?\" \"Where's Fred?\" \"Officer Fred is going back to WA city.\" \"He had some other things to do.\" \"What does that mean?\" \"It means I've been thinking about what you said... about what I just heard Jack say.\" \"Or maybe he was harder to catch than you thought.\" \"Believe what you want.\" \"So just like that, it's over.\" \"I guess there will be a note in your file.\" \"But I think you can handle that without any help from me.\" \"I'll tell your mom you're looking good.\" \"Should I say thank you?\" \"He's a good boy.\" \"Take care of him.\" \"Jack, Adam has made a decision.\" \"About the case of our country v. Gabriel... it is the judgment of this court... that what Gabriel said... to Officers Malone and Frank of the Federal Agency... were said without a lawyer... and are not allowed as proof.\" \"I also agree with the defendant's request... to dismiss the charges against Mr. Gabriel.\" \"Case dismissed.\" \"I guess my time in the spotlight isn't over.\" \"I just talked to Victoria.\" \"You're not joking.\" \"You better believe it.\" \"Jack, we know who that girl they found in JE city is.\" \"It's Charlotte.\" \"You've got a job to do.\" \"They found skin and paint pieces under her nails.\" \"Let's see if they can find where they came from.\" \"Didn't one of the people we were looking at work at a car repair place?\" \"The neighbor.\" \"In WO town.\" \"I'm doing it.\" \"Any signs of bad touch?\" \"I'm waiting for the science people to tell me.\" \"What about the head hurt?\" \"It looks like something round and not sharp did it.\" \" A toy bat.\" \" Maybe.\" \" Has anyone told the mom and dad?\" \" No, not yet.\" \"Matthew and Sophia, I want you to stay with the person who is not moving.\" \"David, stay with the science people.\" \"Victoria, work together with the JE police.\" \"I'm going to talk to the mom and dad.\"", "hash": "6b496249bbab998e73cf9f8969fc69b8c1a291b98eb344f1f29091d27e8b70f2"}

from the noise of life.\" \"Walk slowly\" \"Watch out for steps.\" \"That's how I started thinking about our team's work,\" \"Sitting in quiet places\" \"Here we are.\" \"This is my quiet place.\" \"This box is for anyone, be it a rich man or a worker to bring a problem at any mess or disorder to the eyes of his king.\" \"It will be me, the RU king, who will read this problem and who will know what my people think.\" \"I'll make all decisions myself, quickly and fairly!\" \"It is smart, but all this must be tiring for you, your king!\" \"It is not important, please read today's letters to me.\" \"Which letters should I start with?\" \"The ones on the top.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Well...\" \"These are simple requests and problems at each other.\" \"the poems for your becoming the king.\" \"The poems again.\" \"Silly.\" \"Read aloud!\" \"Your king!\" \"Read!\" \"The king must know everything!\" \"Not all the actions of the kings are good, what silly things did Yara leave behind?\" \"Her son who's not smart.\" \"Not clean people.\" \"Upset by your quick actions, your king.\" \"Not clean people.\" \"Stop being upset, Boss.\" \"The people like to laugh at the strange ones.\" \"I remember that since I was small.\" \"Now look here.\" \"Please pay extra attention to that.\" \"You as the boss should study this closely.\" \"SP city in all its details is in front of you.\" \"All this has been made with your king's hands.\" \"with my hands.\" \"I like working during the night, yes, this place is so quiet and peaceful for thinking.\" \"Where should the big church be?\" \"Here it is.\" \"Where should the jails be?\" \"Here they are.\" \"Let's start with the big things.\" \"The first one is to make the city look and act the best.\" \"The city is an example for all RU country.\" \"Here are my thoughts on this.\" \"on all things big and small.\" \"All houses and street signs in NE city are to be painted only in the color that the King likes.\" \"There is to be no fast riding on the city streets and small roads\" \"Young people are to take off their hats in front of older people.\" \"The dogs are not to be let go in the streets; the windows\" \"are not to be decorated with flowers.\" \"Are you surprised?\" \"No, sir.\" \"The big leader did not ignore small things while fixing the Roman ways.\" \"I'm glad you understand me.\" \"I'm happy with you, David!\" \"I'm a lord, your Majesty.\" \"No, from now on you are a count.\" \"You are the boss of the city, count Patrick, but I think you should also be the head of the police.\" \"Your Majesty...\" \"Do not argue with me!\" \"Your Majesty, it is a big sign of trust and honor.\" \"Here are the keys for you.\" \"When I need you - I'll call you.\" \"Fantastic.\" \"Well, enough of this.\" \"Calm down, Alice, my dear...\" \"The King is somewhere close.\" \"Stop it...\" \"Who's that?\" \"The daughter of Liam, the wise man from MO city.\" \"Let her introduce herself.\" \"It is my daughter, your Majesty.\" \"Sit down.\" \"What's your name, young lady?\" \"Alice.\" \"Why are you crying?\" \"The music is so nice.\" \"I feel sad for the fairy.\" \"Let us listen about the fairy.\" \"When did you arrive?\" \"Yesterday, sir.\" \"I did not want to come to the castle.\" \"I do not have nice dresses.\" \"My aunt made me come here.\" \"My aunt made me come here.\" \"My aunt made me come here.\" \"Do you know anyone here?\" \"The proud lady over there is the queen.\" \"The Queen?\" \"!\" \"and the cute boy next to her is the prince.\" \"When the King is not here anymore, he'll be the new King.\" \"Now he sits and waits.\" \"Your Majesty, the news from FR country...\" \"Stop the music!\" \"Bonaparte, the First Leader of FR country, is being nice\" \"General Nathan did a good thing.\" \"Our soldiers can go home!\" \"Servants, bring some juice!\" \"Everybody, let's dance!\" \"You are so funny!\" \"You do not look like a King.\" \"I do not even trust you.\" \"Adam, little ones, dance!\" \"Be happy!\" \"We have a fun day today!\" \"Now back to the fairy.\" \"Do you still feel sad for her?\" \"Just a little.\" \"For you to trust I'm the King, I make you a helper in my daughter's team.\" \"Be gentle, gentle!\" \"Thank you, Benjamin, you helped me today.\" \"Let me introduce Captain Cameron.\" \"Our captain of battles and the builder of a big city.\" \"was asked by a dream of our King to the forest team.\" \"I'll see you later, friends.\" \"We'll talk more.\" \"Your highness, I ask for a quiet and quick talk.\" \"Your Highness, Count Benjamin to see you.\" \"What's the big rush, Benjamin?\" \"\" You break the rules;\" \"the King will not be happy.\"\" \"I risk making you upset, but I have to say that\" \"My job makes me know what the people in the city think and talk about.\" \" I'm not interested in whispers.\" \"I'm sorry, your Highness, but the King trusts in me,\" \"and my job is to truly help him.\" \"Take a seat.\" \"Your Highness, the King is known to thank a big man for the release of our friends, but in reality it is a trick.\" \"The big man wants to break our friendship with a far country.\" \"Go on.\" \"I ask for your wisdom and your love for our King\" \"Only you can slowly stop him from quick decisions in the matters of city rule.\" \"You'd better go back to your city watch duties.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Lady, you must have heard about some palace hidden room, haven't you?\" \"Some weird things are happening.\" \"Which ones?\" \"The King has a long-time hobby of building paper castles and houses, what is strange about that?\" \"It is his way of thinking about city matters.\" \"Maybe.\" \"A big load of city jobs made him tired and his mind messy.\" \"Yes, yes he is tired.\" \"He is tired.\" \"Your Highness...\" \"Shouldn't Doctor David be called?\" \"I have already sent this David away.\" \"There is no need for this man.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"I'm happy to see you, Mr. David.\" \"I'm not the palace doctor anymore and I can clearly say that\" \"King Peter is sick.\" \"Take a seat, Benjamin.\" \"The talk is going to be about careful matters.\" \"Sorry for the mess.\" \"I'm tidying up because I have to go soon.\" \"So, the first thing is his bad family.\" \"The boy is the son of a not nice person, Peter.\" \"And a not good lady, the gone Yara.\" \"Mr. Ryan...\" \"Excuse me...\" \"I'm sorry.\" \"A not nice person and a not good lady.\" \"The second thing is how our boy lived.\" \"He spent almost thirty years away from home.\" \"in a make-believe place, in a toy kingdom, that he made up.\" \"Now this small world meets real life.\" \"And our boy... our boy is full of action.\" \"and he is ready to make changes.\" \"I cannot listen to all this about my king.\" \"But you wanted the truth, count.\" \"And here's another truth.\" \"No one in your country will stand against the King.\" \"And I'm going to EN country.\" \"I'm happy.\" \"According to your King's big plan...\" \"Well this is the front side - Come on.\" \" The garden side, your King.\" \"And this is the side with the nearby church.\" \"And what about the big hall?\" \"Big hall!\" \"Your King, the big hall will be decorated with red cloth with gold.\" \"What's behind?\" \"The symbol of RU country and of the kingdoms of AS, KZ and...\" \"And the marble faces of the famous men\" \"Your King, this is a bit...\" \"And the statue of fairness, peace and freedom.\" \"Your King, if we follow the usual rules...\" \"I'm the one who decides here!\" \"They will be right.\" \"Your King, here is your castle.\" \"Count Patrick!\" \"I trust your thoughts.\" \"How is it?\" \"This castle will be a symbol of your time, Sire.\" \"Alice!\"\"Alice!\" \"Alice!\" \"Why didn't you go out to play yesterday?\" \"My dad felt unwell.\" \"Oh!\" \"Look, you've hurt your little shoulder, and it is my shoulder,\" \"Here is a fine for that -your kiss.\" \"She is jealous.\" \"My dad and I love you a lot.\" \"But he is about to go to MO city.\" \"Why?\" \"He says he can't work at the court and lie to the King like everybody does.\" \"Like everybody?\" \"Yes, they all are laughing at your castle.\" \"Kevin!\" \"Get the horses ready!\" \"Sire!\" \"Your Highness!\" \"Sir, where are you going?\" \"You'll get hurt!\" \"Everyone tells lies.\" \"The King has arrived!\" \" Sir!\" \"Sir!\" \"Bad person!\" \"There is nothing here!\" \"Your Highness!\" \"Only holes!\" \"Your Highness, the rocks are being brought from far places!\" \"Really far places!\" \"Where are the walls?\" \"Where are the towers?\" \"Thieves everywhere?\" \"!\" \"Send everyone to SI land!\" \"Your Highness, everyone steals.\" \"Everyone steals!\" \"Your Highness, we didn't see that .\" \" Didn't see?\" \"!\" \"And what about the rule about work?\" \"We are sorry, your Highness!\" \" Sorry?\" \"!\" \"Sir...\" \"Punish everyone!\" \"Everyone to hard work in SI land!\" \"Punish everyone!\" \"Start building the castle right away!\" \"The rule!\" \"To tell everyone every day like a prayer!\" \"General Benjamin is dismissed right away!\" \"Thieves!\" \"Your Highness, your nose is bleeding!\" \"Here, here you are!\" \"Listen!\" \"Get ready!\" \"Everyone is lying!\"\"Everyone is lying!\" \"Everyone is lying!\" \"Sorry, miss.\" \"Eh?\" \"What's that?\" \"\"BU\" -the drama written by a famous writer.\" \"Killing a king, isn't it?\" \"And who marked some parts?\" \"I do not know, Sir, it is one of grandma's books.\" \"Grandma seems to have given everything to you!\" \"The letter.\" \"I always keep it with me.\" \"\"All my love will not be enough to thank for everything that you've done for me and\"... plan to do\".\" \"What is this about?\" \" Dad, dad, I\" \"It means you have always known about grandma's will.\" \"No, dad, no...\" \"You knew about it, Adam, and kept quiet and did not stop it.\" \"No, Dad...\" \"And everyone knows that and is waiting for that.\" \"Dad...\" \"And everyone is against my will!\" \"Dad, I've never wanted that, can't you see that, and I do not want it now...\" \"I beg you, please, don't make me a king!\" \"You are lying, bad person!\" \"Shame on you!\" \"What?\" \"!\" \"A brave girl!\" \"An example to all!\" \"Do you remember the story of Prince Adam?\" \"The son was against his father and the father punished his son!\" \"I'm sorry, miss.\" \"And the castle has to be built.\" \"A silly man.\" \"A silly man?\" \"No.\" \"Oh dear, what's wrong with him, Lizkhen?\" \"Friends\" \"I ask you\" \"I kindly ask you to come in...\" \"Do you want a glass of juice?\" \"I've invited you here trusting your honor and common sense.\" \"Well, RU country now looks like a ship with a confused person at the helm.\" \"The country is filled with confusion.\" \"He suspects everyone.\" \"He is dangerous.\" \"At the same time Prince Adam has been brought up in a good way.\" \"But he is just the next in line, not the ruler.\" \"May be we should convince his Majesty to step down for Adam?\" \"No. we shouldn't.\" \"No.\" \"A sharp object or a bad drink.\" \"Friends, this talk is impossible.\" \"We are close to a time long ago.\" \"What about that?\" \"Just a drop on a glove and a cloth.\" \"Then a sudden feeling of not being able to breathe and all is over.\" \"Do you always carry this around?\" \"Hand it over to me.\" \"You act without thinking.\" \"Our talks do not make any sense until we get the Prince's approval.\" \"But how?\" \"It is risky.\" \"OK, I'll go and see him.\" \"Come in, your Excellency, his Highness will see you.\" \"I'm glad to see you, count.\" \"Come on.\" \"Your Highness, I'm a man of simple words.\" \"So I'll say everything directly and honestly.\" \"Come on, come on.\" \"You are well aware of the way your father rules the country.\" \"It is high time for everyone to see you the supreme ruler of all RU country.\" \"Your Highness, there is a plan to capture the Emperor, say he is sick,\" \"force him to step down in your favor.\" \"How do you dare, Sir!\" \"Your Highness, any delay now is crazy and wrong.\" \"I'll never do anything against my ruler.\" \"You are a traitor, Patrick.\" \"I'm at your disposal, sir.\" \"I spoke simply and I'll simply go to the punishment.\" \"My best regards.\" \"Have you heard this?\" \"Yes, I have.\" \"What should we do, Lizkhen?\" \"What if there is some hurt?\" \"Any hurt is better than anything we have right now.\" \"Ok, it means our hurt.\" \"Not ours.\" \"What about Adam, your Excellency?\" \" He is unsure, but finally he'll step back.\" \"Does it mean the helpers?\" \"We don't have anyone else to rely on.\" \"We need to find those who feel upset and bring them together.\" \"Yes, sadly, the helpers.\" \"My best wishes.\" \"Let the good be with us.\" \"The King asked for the castle to be built quickly, day and night.\" \"To be strict with those who don't work!\" \"To praise those who work hard!\" \"Our King asked for the castle to be built quickly, day and night.\" \"To be strict with those who don't work!\" \"To praise those who work hard!\" \"Clear shadows, softer clouds!\" \"More gold and brighter colors!\" \"Take it!\" \"You've made a promise to me!\" \"You really made a promise to me!\" \"Everything needs to dry!\" \"To get dry!\" \"You made a promise in the spring!\" \"To check in every week!\" \"Oh no, oh no\" \"No!\" \"To check in every day!\" \"Your Majesty.\"\"Your Majesty.\" \"Your Majesty.\" \"Did you call me?\" \"This is RU country where the King doesn't know what's happening in its regions,\" \"what's happening in its minds.\" \"Help me.\" \"Should I make you the Mailman too?\" \"King, this is too much for me to handle.\" \"I get it.\" \"I trust you, David, and I want to ask you a question.\" \"Am I scary?\" \"Well, the King naturally makes all his people a bit scared.\" \"Stop playing tricks, David.\" \"My orders are not being followed properly.\" \"The helpers just say yes to everything.\" \"This is RU country.\" \"No, it's not.\" \"It's fear.\" \"My plan is to make my people trust me.\" \"I may be quick to anger.\" \"But I'm not hard on people.\" \"You, King, you are kind.\" \"Prepare a message, David.\" \"All those who were sent away and lost their homes and titles\" \"All those, even my biggest enemies, will be forgiven and rewarded.\" \"All of them.\" \"That's smart, King.\" \"All this should have been done before spring.\" \"This is very hard, King.\" \"We need to make lists, tell people - it's a lot of work.\" \"Too much.\" \"I'm counting on you, David.\" \"I'll be waiting for news.\" \"Our King asked for the castle to be built quickly, day and night.\" \"To be strict with those who don't work!\" \"Let's give lots of presents to the hardworking people!\" \"King!\" \"The SE soldiers are all on our side, some of the PR soldiers are still not sure\" \"All the IZ soldiers

All RU country, the King of KZ, the King of AS, the King of SI, the Ruler of PS and the Big Prince of SM and LI...\" \"What is that?\" \"The people whom you kindly forgave by your order, are making camps at night\" \"They stay here all day and all night hoping for more kindness from you, King.\" \"How many people are there?\" \" The list is ready, but it will take a long time to read it.\" \"Your ruling, King, has caused seven marshals, three hundred generals, two thousand and two hundred officers\" \"and many other people - priests, farmers and shopkeepers.\" \"People are signing up all the time.\" \"Stay in line, Don't push!\" \"Your name and job!\" \"I'm Isaac, my job is a soldier!\" \"Be quiet, calm down!\" \"Oh no!\" \"A thousand hits!\"\"A thousand hits!\" \"A thousand hits!\" \"Patrick!\"\"Patrick!\" \"Patrick!\" \"Samuel!\" \"He is in his office.\" \"Come here.\" \"Where is he?\"\"Where is he?\" \"Where is he?\" \"Why doesn't he come out?\" \"We don't know.\" \"We can't leave.\" \"But why?\" \"Only God knows, by the order of the King.\" \"Oh, no.\" \"Why doesn't he come out?\" \"He is lying with his face down.\" \"Does he eat anything?\" \"No, he doesn't.\"

walking in the town square near a big statue.\" \"I suddenly saw a tall man in black clothes.\" \"His hat was low.\" \"I couldn't see his face.\" \"I asked who he was.\" \"He took off his hat\" \"And I knew him.\" \"My great-grandfather King Peter.\" \"He looked at me sadly and kindly, shook his head and said\" \"Poor, poor Patrick.\" \"Don't think about that.\" \"I'm not thinking about it at all\" \"And it's okay.\" \"Think about when you were young.\" \"Think about the cardboard castles you made.\" \"It's all okay.\" \"I remember so clearly - cutting them out and building, cutting them out and building.\" \"It's all okay.\" \"A wonderful castle.\" \"A wonderful one.\" \"The king is happy and calm.\" \"He is about to come out.\" \"I'm sorry for my headache,\" \"Miss.\" \"I thought about it again and decided that instead of waiting for Benjamin to finish building, we'll celebrate the new house today.\" \"Friend Patrick!\" \"I trust you.\" \"Plan it properly.\" \"And have a fun party tonight.\" \"My love, children, see you tonight.\" \"Do you feel upset about your dad?\" \"No, I don't!\" \"You can start dancing now.\" \"I made a mistake.\" \"The string broke.\" \"Then RU

land.\" \"The King of another land.\" \"Do you have strange dreams?\" \"I had such a dream yesterday.\" \"What did you dream about?\" \"Very silly, as if I were a toy...\" \"A kind of toy that doesn't move.\" \"The king of the other land is ordered to take his people to the land of GA city...\" \"Ryan, could you tell me about a long time ago when my father was hurt?\" \"Where were you then?\" \"Here in ST city, your Majesty.\" \"What did you do then?\" \"I was young and had a small job as a helper in the hills.\" \"I did not know anything about the bad plan.\" \"You didn't know anything.\" \"Well.\" \"Do you know that I'm in danger?\" \"The leader of all of RU land?\" \"I know, Sire.\" \"You know?\" \"And you didn't tell me about this?\" \"King, I know the secret plan.\" \"You...\" \"King, it's so clear, it doesn't need talking.\" \"I know the secret people's plan, I watch everyone, to keep you safe, King.\" \"What about David?\" \"Well, the secret people didn't make a plan and that's good\" \"Now I control everything, they can't do anything without me knowing.\" \"You are smart, sir.\" \"A doll.\" \"Why didn't you tell me right away?\" \"Sorry, King.\" \"I wanted to tell you so many times, I almost said it but I didn't have clear proof and I wanted to be kind to you, to save my dad's feelings\" \"I kept waiting and that's my only mistake.\" \"Adam.\" \"Yes.\"\"Yes.\"

to a far away place to work hard, and Adam\" \"will be punished\" \"King, sending the whole royal family away based on unclear proof is impossible.\" \"What should I do then?\" \"Trust me.\" \"Fully trust me.\" \"Isn't that too much to ask, sir?\" \"King, you have two choices:\" \"you can punish me right away for being bad or trust me fully.\" \"Well, sorry, I trust you.\" \"Tell me what I should do.\" \"This is the paper I wrote for this case.\" \"Please sign\" \" Sign\" \"and I'm ready to do what needs to be done.\" \"Wait, Patrick.\" \"Patrick, do you love me?\" \"I do, King.\" \"You do.\"

is that?\" \"A paper about the king stepping down and the new king coming in.\" \"Do I need to sign it?\" \"You do.\" \"With my red stuff?\" \"Why red stuff, black stuff will work.\" \"I can't.\"

don't look like any Patrick I've seen.\" \"Ever heard of different looking IR country?\" \"Different looking IR country?\" \"That's right.\" \"Who do you think made a famous sandwich, a breakfast meal, huh?\" \"A special drink?\" \"That's ours.\" \"Give me your papers.\" \"What?\" \"Your papers.\" \"Let me tell you, you got nerve to ask me about my papers.\" \"My family had hard times, man, because there were no potatoes.\" \"A bad disease.\" \"Mouth sores.\" \"A medical procedure.\" \"A medical procedure?\" \"Right, my wife just had twins.\" \"Both little fairies.\" \"Fairies?\" \"Smell this.\" \"It's like a forest.\" \"If you don't believe that, find a four-leaf clover.\" \"Matthew!\" \"Put this stuff on the boat.\" \"Tough, huh?\" \"That was heavy.\" \"I think we should rest a bit.\" \"Wait a bit.\" \"I sense something's wrong.\" \"This ring is very shiny.\" \"The big rings are strong.\" \"Big data chips should be light with a hole in the middle that stops them from getting hot.\" \"If something is lighter than the water it's in...\" \"It floats.\" \"There they are.\" \"I'm sure Hannah was great, but I can't imagine life without David.\" \"Let's leave this place.\" \"I agree with that.\" \"Why are you in a hurry, Hannah?\" \"You've only been here a little while.\" \"Now, I've waited for you before.\" \"In fact, I've waited for you many days.\" \"That's many weeks.\" \"That's many months.\" \"That's many years.\" \"Enough about me.\" \"How about you, Hannah?\" \"How have you been?\" \"Matthew.\" \"I see you still look good.\" \"You're bold to take from me.\" \"Taking back is more like it.\" \"Give us the rings.\" \"Give us the rings.\" \"Give us the rings!\" \"Don't lose them.\" \"We'll be taking them back in a moment.\" \"I've hoped one day I'd see you again and watch you lose.\" \"Keep hoping.\" \"Lights.\" \"Someone get the lights!\" \"Matthew.\" \"Matthew!\" \"Matthew!\" \"Matthew!\" \"You know I always like it with the light on.\" \"You don't know me now.\" \"I'm the only one here who knows you.\" \"Wait, wait, wait!\" \"I have to say, Hannah, I've always liked you.\" \"Always wanting what you can't get.\" \"Really?\" \"I'll get you any way I want.\" \"I have the rings.\" \"Let's leave!\" \"Don't let them leave!\" \"Understood?\" \"Let's go, now!\" \"Let's go.\" \"David, let's go.\" \"You can't hurt me anymore, Hannah.\" \"I'm going to show you and your friends what hurt is.\" \"I'm going to scare them just so you can hear them yell.\"  \"I'm very sorry, Daddy, I didn't tell you.\" \"I didn't think you'd be happy.\" \"I know you wanted me to be a doctor.\" \"But I've found a new way to help people that makes me feel so good.\" \"Whatever makes you happy.\" \"I am so happy!\" \"It's been hard, you not knowing all these years.\" \"D...\" \"Daddy, Nora, David and I are a team.\" \"And we just helped 12 sailors.\" \"You can't even think of the things we do.\" \"Daddy, I wish you could see us work.\" \"You'd be so proud.\" \"I'm gonna clean up because I am dirty...\" \"Well, you can only guess what from.\" \"And then when I'm clean, I am gonna tell you all about it.\" \"Ferret.\" \" Nora?\" \" What, Patrick?\" \" I've been thinking.\" \" Yeah?\" \" About what?\" \" Well, look I know we just started living together.\" \" Yeah?\" \" Yeah.\" \"And I know we agreed to take this slow.\" \" But...\" \" Yeah?\" \"There's just something I gotta ask.\" \" Oh, boy.\" \" Yeah. \"Oh, boy\" is right.\" \"So here it goes.\" \" Dance with me first.\" \" Okay.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Hey!\" \" About that question, Patrick?\" \" Let's talk about it later.\" \"\"Here's all your stuff back.\"\" \"What's up with that?\" \"She's gone.\" \"She's not coming back.\" \"She loved these shoes.\" \"She doesn't want us to get hurt.\" \"Wait a minute, you girls are brave every day.\" \"Yeah.\" \"\"I'll be so sad if anything happens to you.\"\" \"What do we do now, Charlie?\" \"Nora, Alice.\" \"You need to stay happy.\" \"Any news about the O'Gradys, Charlie?\" \"Any news on how Seamus left jail?\" \"He didn't leave, Nora.\" \"He was let go.\" \"What?\" \"Who would be able to do something like that?\" \"Jacknie Cochran.\" \"The Justice Department, the DA's office, the FBI.\" \"U.S. Marshal.\" \"That's Cameron.\" \"I never gave rings to a guy before.\" \"The rings are safe, sir.\" \"And we can all feel a little safer.\" \" Well done, Angels.\" \" Thanks, Charlie.\" \"HALO is safe, thanks to you.\" \"It's been a pleasure.\" \"I hope to play with you girls again.\" \"But not too quickly.\" \"Wish you all the best.\" \"Your keys.\" \" What is that?\" \" My side hurts.\" \"These aren't mine.\" \"That was good for a boy with a hurt side.\" \"Well done, Ben.\" \" We caught him.\" \" We caught who?\" \"Of course, he already had one ring.\" \"He just needed the other.\" \"He wanted to pretend to go away so he wouldn't be thought of.\" \"Who are you all talking about?\" \"He needed time for his plan, so he tricked Sam.\" \"Then let him go after David.\" \"I think you're right, Alice.\" \"Oh no!\" \"So Charlie's the naughty one!\" \"It's just a guess at this point, Ben.\" \"We need to know for sure.\" \" Keys, Ben.\" \" Let's go.\" \"Naughty boy.\" \"Road's clear.\" \"You're good to go.\" \"Almost there.\" \"Watch out.\" \"Good job, Adam.\" \" Can we leave yet?\" \" No, you can't, son.\" \"I gotta make sure it's safe.\" \" We're gonna be late.\" \" You're not gonna be late, young m...\" \"You silly bear!\" \"Son, please listen to me, young man.\" \"A few more minutes and you'll be in school.\" \"You'll never see me again.\" \"Man, you do not mess with a boy's hair!\" \"I got the phone.\" \"I'm calling from my car.\" \"Go safe.\" \"My part of the deal's done.\" \"The Angels are off the case.\" \"I have the rings.\" \"David.\" \"Adam!\"\"Adam!\" \"Adam!\" \"Call friend one.\" \"Adam, are you okay?\" \"Nathan, the handle's broken.\" \"I can't unlock it.\" \"The deal's on.\" \"In the evening, just as we talked.\" \" Nathan, plan B!\" \" I'm calling in Ben.\" \"We'll get you out of there, Adam.\" \"Hang on.\" \"Follow the stars beyond the sky.\" \"Go towards hope.\" \"Stop on a step.\" \"A step?\" \"Find a man with a map.\" \"Ben, can you hear me?\" \"Ben, we're going to Plan B right away.\" \"I'm on it.\"\"I'm on it.\" \"I'm on it.\" \"Okay?\" \"Now, get back.\" \"We're going to Plan B.\" \"Get back!\" \"Stop!\"\"Stop!\" \"Stop!\" \" Come on.\" \"Okay.\" \"Hurry up.\" \"Jump.\" \"Run.\" \"Go away.\" \"Hurry up.\" \"Go away.\" \" Good job, Ben.\" \" Yeah, sure.\" \"Charlie works with a friend.\" \"They're giving away the list tonight.\" \"We'll stop them and then find David.\" \" See you, Ben.\" \" Yeah, okay, okay.\" \"This is silly.\" \" Katherine.\" \" Hello, David.\" \"Don't you have a problem to solve?\" \"Well, I tried to forget my past, but it found me yesterday.\" \"And I put my friends in trouble.\" \"They're in more trouble now without you.\" \"Nora and Alice are going to find someone else.\" \"A real helper.\" \"Not someone who's pretending to be something she's not.\" \"Your past is what makes you who you are, David.\" \"Don't forget that Charlie picked you for a reason.\" \"Helpers are like stars.\" \"They can't be made.\" \"You have to find them.\" \"Each one is special.\" \"Sometimes we look too hard for answers that are right in front of us.\" \"The people getting the list are ready.\" \"We did it, friend!\" \"You know, I never really understood that friend thing.\" \"Hello, helpers.\" \"Madison.\" \"Why?\" \"Why be a helper when I can be in charge?\" \"Looks like one of the three friends has gone away.\" \"Welcome back, David.\" \"You're such a typical playful Pisces.\" \"Always trying to show how strong you are and you couldn't make it one day by yourself, could you?\" \"Someone reminded me that every helper is special.\" \"And I knew it was you.\" \"Who else had friends in MO country could change the safe system and hire a swimmer as a helper?\" \"Same star sign friend who would call a bike rider with a lion on his hat as \"Leo\".\" \"Very well done.\" \"Very good, really.\" \"You've figured it all out.\" \"And now I'm going to enjoy stopping you.\" \"But you're a helper.\" \"No.\" \"You just don't understand.\" \"I don't listen to a box anymore.\" \"I work for myself.\" \"Well, your boss is not nice.\" \"The helpers' strong pose.\" \"Seeing the three of you like that makes me remember the old days.\" \"But back then, it was a little bit different.\" \"You see, when I was a helper we used toys.\" \"Sorry, Charlie.\" \"Hello, friends.\" \"Good evening, Charlie.\" \"I love our new place.\" \"Is that you, Madison?\" \"Where are the friends?\" \"I'm sure there's three more friends around.\" \"Madison, what did you do?\" \"We're just having fun.\" \"You shouldn't worry, Charlie.\" \"You've always had no trouble finding friends.\" \"Hurting friends doesn't prove you're the best.\" \"You know that.\" \"Do I?\" \"Madison, you couldn't accept that we are all about teamwork.\" \"We're a family.\" \"We do...\" \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.\" \"Friends forever.\" \"I've heard that before.\" \"It was very nice once.\" \"Madison, you went off on your own and put your friends in danger.\" \"When we finally found you, you were so hurt, we thought we might lose you.\" \"You did lose me.\" \"You see, being a friend wasn't my destiny.\" \"It was keeping me from it.\" \"Your destiny is yet to be written.\" \"Don't do this, Madison.\" \"Hurting people is not the answer.\" \"There must be something in you that's still good.\" \"I was never good.\" \"I was great.\" \"Oh no.\" \"What a mean person!\" \"Friends, we have to outsmart Madison.\" \"No matter what we do, she's always ahead of us.\" \" She's doing something tonight, evening time.\" \" But where?\" \" What else did you hear?\" \" Okay.\" \"\"Look at the stars beyond the sky.\"\" \"It's safe to say it's here.\" \"\"Go to Hope Street and stop at a stair.\"\" \" There's a Hope Street in town.\" \" But no beach for miles.\" \"A stair.\" \"A stair?\" \"A stair!\" \" Maybe you bumped your head.\" \" I'm worried.\" \"Friends, the stars.\" \"Stars on the ground.\" \"Beyond the big theatre.\" \"There's a shore, a hope and a stair.\" \" Good job.\" \" Yeah!\" \"I think she's trying to hurt us.\" \"I can't believe it.\" \"We are here in Hollywood.\" \" Friends?\" \" I knew we would do it...\" \" Be quiet, please!\" \" What?\" \"I mean, not you, Mom.\" \"Sorry.\" \" Have you gone crazy?\" \" Yeah.\" \"No, we'll talk about it later. There are some bad groups. Welcome to a big world of... Stop. Give us the picture. Surprise! Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack! I love you! I heard the next part is crazy. The first one was great.

I have something you'll never have. And what's that? Friends. Enjoy the nice place. Go to the bad place. She won't work here anymore. Party time. Friends! Benjamin! Friends! Did you all see that flying lady? Yes! Did you touch her? Yes! Did you kick her? Did you win the fight? Mom, I told you! I knew it! We couldn't have done it without you. Never!

Do you want some bread?\" asked Adam. \"I don't eat meat,\" said Ben. \"I made you chicken,\" said Adam. \"Adam, if you didn't want Bush in the WH, why did you vote for another?\" asked Ben. \"Sorry I'm late. The cars were too many,\" said Cameron. \"Hello, Alice. Merry Christmas,\" greeted Adam. \"You don't look well, Alice. I think I have a cold,\" said Cameron. \"Can I check your temperature?\" asked Alice. \"It's okay. People get sick,\" said Cameron. \"Does anyone want some bread? Adam?\" asked Alice. \"Sure, I'll take it,\" said Adam. \"Everyone, save some room for dessert,\" said Alice. \"Mom, are you trying to ruin my diet?\" asked Taylor. \"Of course not, Taylor. I support your goal of staying fit,\" said Alice. \"Why do you have to be so rude?\" asked Taylor. \"Because I'm just joking,\" said Alice. \"Fisher Funeral Home. This is Adam speaking,\" said Adam on the phone. \"I'm so sorry. Yes, we are open today. Any time before eleven,\" said Adam. \"I wish we could have Christmas dinner without someone passing away,\" said Alice. \"We'll be waiting for you. A heart problem. Thank God for small miracles,\" said Adam. \"Oh no,\" said Alice. \"I've seen this show before. That was Dr. Sam. Kitty... didn't make it.\" \"What are we watching this for?\" asked Ben. \"Because it's the only thing on,\" said Adam. \"Stop talking.

The flowers in bloom,\" said Ben. \"You just keep telling yourself, everything that can happen does happen. Somewhere,\" said Alice. \"Uh oh.\" \"I've seen this one before.\" \"Tell me what's happening.\" \"I need you to answer some questions.\" \"Do you believe your thoughts can change how tiny things behave?\" \"Am I awake or am I sleeping?\" \"Do you believe that tiny things can be in all places at once?\" \"And if I am sleeping, is this a dream or a nightmare?\" \"Do you believe there are many different worlds?\" \"Why should I worry about that?\" \"You can only pick one answer.\" \"Think about it.\" \"Just tell me.\" \"Am I sleeping?\" \"Yes or no?\" \"Yes.\" \"And no.\" \"In some places

quick.\" \"We've actually been together eight years.\" \"You know, sometimes here, sometimes there.\" \"Between here and a city far away.\" \"Well, you look really happy.\" \"I am really happy.\" \"Good.\" \"My sister-in-law likes stars.\" \"And she drinks too much.\" \"And she was telling me about this strange thing her hobby is facing.\" \"When did liking stars become a job?\" \"You know, with the whole possibility of travelling to other planets.\" \"This pasta salad is so tasty.\" \"I want to spend a whole weekend alone with it.\" \"That makes me feel strange.\" \"Say in your chart, Mars is in a certain place.\" \"Well, what about when people are born on Mars?\" \"Their Mars isn't in anything but their earth, it's in a different place.\" \"Sweetheart, no one's listening.\" \"I know.\" \"I'm not having fun.\" \"Oh, I made some noodle salad without fish in it for you.\" \"No, I'm feeding the baby.\" \"I need the protein.\" \"Samuel!\" \"Put the cat down.\" \" So the baby-feeding thing is better now?\" \" Yes.\" \" I'm taking fenugreek.\" \" Fenugreek.\" \" Oh, I've heard of that.\" \"How?\" \" It's amazing.\" \"Feeding was so hard for me at first.\" \"I could never make enough milk.\" \"Put the cat down!\" \"But now there's always enough.\" \"The only odd thing is I smell a little like maple syrup.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Our bodies are really amazing.\" \"And I hardly ever sweat.\" \"Which is maybe why it was so hard for me at first.\" \"I wish I got more of those round ones.\" \"They're better for your knees.\" \"But I'm sure I wouldn't be using that one either.\" \" Thomas, thanks for having us.\" \" Leaving so soon?\" \" I have to work tonight.\" \" Want a snack for the road?\" \" I'd better not.\" \" All right.\" \"I think I know someone who wants

criticised.\" \"I feel like nothing I do is good enough.\" \"I feel bad about who I am, like I'll never be the person you want me to be.\" \"I don't want you to be anyone but you.\" \"Kevin, now is about you listening.\" \"You'll get your turn in a moment.\" \"Yeah, OK.\" \"I feel like I'm walking on eggshells.\" \"Sometimes.\" \"Your anger is so sudden and random.\" \"Let's try to avoid making judgments about Kevin's actions right now and really focus on what you feel.\" \"I'm afraid of making you angry, so...\" \"I'm always watching what I say.\" \"I guess I'm confused.\" \"I don't even know who I am any more.\" \"I'm done.\" \"Now, Kevin.\" \"What did you hear?\" \"There's a lot of complaining.\" \"Maybe you have some feelings you want to tell?\" \"Yes.\" \"I don't like my job.\" \"I feel like a sad person driving in a Safety Uniform, responding to alarms set off by small dogs, and being nice to wealthy people who earn more in a day than I do in a year.\" \"I should be able to complain when I come home without you taking it personally because it's almost never about you.\" \" David?\" \" I don't think that's fair.\" \"You don't want me to have any feelings.\" \"No, I'd like to have fun sometimes like we used to.\" \" We don't have fun?\" \" Not often.\" \"Not often?\" \"Sometimes.\" \"How's your relationship?\" \"It's kind of great.\" \"Yes, that part works.\" \"So it seems being excited is comfortable in that area but not so in other areas.\" \"What other things do you two like to do together?\" \"We watch movies sometimes.\" \"We have dinner.\" \"We used to play ball game.\" \"He was so much better than me it was a joke.\" \"I wasn't challenging enough.\" \" I never said that.\" \" It made me feel inadequate.\" \"What things do you do by yourself?\" \" Besides work, exercise.\" \" Yes.\" \"My job keeps me from doing much else.\" \"Friends?\" \"Most of my friends are policemen.\" \"But I don't see them any more since I left the job.\" \" David never really had any close friends.\" \" That's not true.\" \"There's a group of people I meet with every month.\" \"You don't like those guys.\" \"We're out of time.\" \"This week, if any problems happen, try to focus on saying what you're feeling instead of criticising and blaming, OK?\" \"Change.\" \"Good, Ryan.\" \"Change.\" \"Oh, it's almost evening.\" \"Rico's gonna be mad.\" \" Mom.\" \" Hello.\" \"How is my sweet girl today?\" \"She has hiccups again.\" \"She gets that from her dad.\" \"He was a very gassy baby.\" \"Yes, he was.\" \"I'll get her some water.\" \" Do you burp her often when she's feeding?\" \" Of course.\" \"What's wrong with you?\" \"Uh, I don't know.\" \"I think I just had the weirdest feeling.\" \"Hello!\" \"Every time I come by, there are more people here.\" \"Hi.\" \"I'm Charlotte Ward, Lily's boss.\" \"I'm Rachel Fisher, Nathan's mother.\" \"We've met a few times.\" \"You're not staying here now too, are you?\" \"I'm joking.\" \"Calm down.\" \" I keep talking about this.\" \" I parked in the driveway again.\" \" There are two cars today.\" \" Sorry, I didn't know.\" \"Oh, please, it's not a big deal.\" \"I'm sure you didn't know.\" \" What's your reason?\" \" I was just dropping off...\" \"I could make a sign.\" \"\"Nathan, move it back.\" \"Put it on the street.\"\" \" I'm joking.\" \" If you want, I'll move it now.\" \"Don't be silly.\" \"Whenever.\" \"Doesn't matter.\" \"Sooner is better.\" \"Lily, I'm having dinner with Penelope tonight so I want you to cook.\" \"OK.\" \"But I'm having a small party tomorrow.\" \"I'm trying a new idea on friends.\" \"Shouldn't be more than... 30.\" \" OK.\" \" Do you have time to talk about a menu with me?\" \" Now?\" \" Yes!\" \" Take your time, dear.\" \"I've got all afternoon.\" \" Nice to meet you, Nathan's mother!\" \"She's full of energy.\" \"She's a bit crazy.\" \" Hey, Ryan.\" \" Nathan, hey.\" \" How are you?\" \" Good.\" \"Good, good, I'm happy to hear it.\" \"Listen, I don't know if you know, or if you even care, but we have two viewings tonight.\" \" Early in the evening, and one later.\" \" Yeah, I'm on my way.\" \"Good.\" \"Because your brother is nowhere to be found.\" \"And he's not answering his phone.\" \" And there's only so much I can do.\" \" Sure.\" \"I can't be in two places at the same time.\" \"I understand, Ryan, OK?\" \"Stop the lecturing.\" \"I'm not your kid.\" \"I'm not your worker, I'm your partner.\" \"I am a funeral director now.\" \"OK?\" \"You guys took my money, you made me a partner, it's time you treated me like one.\" \"Goodbye.\" \"So, Claire, how's art class?\" \"It's OK.\" \"What kind of stuff are you doing?\" \"Well, yesterday, we had to draw this naked guy very quickly.\" \" Well, that sounds fun.\" \" Not really.\" \"It's tough.\" \"And, like, I don't even want to be a drawer or colorer or whatever.\" \"But they say we need to know how to do everything, like a famous artist.\" \"It's a lot.\" \"But you get to use your imagination every day.\" \"Hello.\" \"Hey!\" \"Hi, little one.\" \"How are you?\" \"I couldn't be any better.\" \"Do you see this little girl?\" \"Is that a lovely face or what?\" \"There's something coming out of her nose.\" \"Who's special, is it you?\" \"Yes, it is.\" \"Can you help with her today?\" \"Lily's got to help Charlotte.\" \"Charlotte's having a big friendly dinner.\" \"Of course.\" \"Guys, she did a big poop this morning.\" \"Who, Lily?\" \"Truly.\" \"It was just so well formed, so healthy.\" \"It was like a grown-up poop.\" \"It made me happy.\" \"When you live with a baby, you see the world as being all new again.\" \"They're just so innocent.\" \"It's a privilege.\" \"Why haven't either of you visited recently?\" \"Because being a father has made you very silly.\" \"Wow.\" \"You're so strong and cool and relaxed.\" \"I wish I was you.\" \"Does anyone want the last piece?\" \"Oh, Adam.\" \"Can you drop Mrs. FR at the goodbye place this afternoon?\" \"No.\" \"I've got to do something important.\" \"Well, I've got to do something else important.\" \"Can't Ryan do it?\" \"He said, \"No way, I'm not doing your jobs.\"\" \"Charlotte, can you help us?\" \"Sorry, I have school work.\" \"We'll give you 50 coins.\" \"You'd pay more than that to a delivery person.\" \"Okay.\" \"As long as I don't have to touch something yucky.\" \"She's all packed.\" \"I can't do it until later, because I have to practice drawing a perfect circle.\" \"That takes a long time?\" \"I have to be able to do it right away in class tomorrow.\" \"It's not as easy as it sounds.\" \"Is that the box that needs to go to the goodbye place?\" \"The...?\" \"Yes.\" \"Well, I can take it now.\" \"You're taking it?\" \"Yes.\" \"They asked me to do runs since nobody else wants to do it.\" \"Really?\" \"Alright, you can get it for 50 coins.\" \"But you'll need to help me put that in my car.\" \"What kind of songs do you guys sing?\" \"It's a bit like early songs from a person named Peter meets a group named Tool.\" \"It's emotional like Sunny Day Songs but political, like Public Songs.\" \"We're still making it.\" \"Let me know when you guys sing, I'll come.\" \"Why don't you stay, while we practice?\" \"I don't think I can.\" \"I have to go to this event...\" \"OK.\" \"I'm Patrick.\" \"I'm Charlotte.\" \"Would you like some juice?\" \"Sure.\" \"You're really amazing, Lisa.\" \"Why?\" \"You're always full of energy.\" \"It's endless.\" \"You could be used as a new type of energy.\" \"You'd save the world.\" \"That's funny because...\" \"I feel tired all the time.\" \"Really?\" \"Yes.\" \"I think it's because I'm a mom.\" \"Yes.\" \"Not that I'm complaining.\" \"Having Maya has totally changed my life.\" \"I can't even think of how life was before.\" \"Wow.\" \"So what if I have to work harder?\" \"I want to.\" \"It's worth it.\" \"It's so worth it.\" \"Carol?\" \"Don't listen to me.\" \"I'm just worried.\" \"Worried about this meeting next week.\" \"I have to talk to a person named McG in person.\" \"Wow, he's scary.\" \"Can I make you some tea?\" \"Please, I'm not your grandma.\" \"I'm your boss.\" \"Stop looking at me, Lisa.\" \"Carol, I'm always here for you.\" \"Also, I swim in the morning.\" \"I used to be able to do that without clothes.\" \"Which was a great way to start the day.\" \"Like I was a brave woman.\" \"I went out feeling brave, which is what you have to do in my work.\" \"Now I can't do that anymore because there's a man here.\" \"I'm sure a person named Nate wouldn't mind.\" \"I would.\" \"I don't like the way he parks in the driveway.\" \"I'm sorry.\" \"I will talk to him about it.\" \"I'm going to swim.\" \"Are you ready for the vegetable?\" \"Yes.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"Adding pepper.\" \"I already added pepper.\" \"OK, I feel bad.\" \"What?\" \"When you said, \"I put pepper.\" \"I thought you were upset with me for not knowing and you were mad at me, that I shouldn't have done it.\" \"Why would I be mad at you?\" \"Maybe you don't want me to help with the cooking.\" \"Maybe you just want me to get the food ready, maybe you want to do everything in the pan.\" \"So we have a bit more pepper in the pan - it's not a big thing.\" \"I know it's not a big thing.\" \"OK.\" \"I heard you.\" \"I didn't want to upset you.\" \"I know.\" \"Good.\" \"I love you.\" \"Are the carrots done?\" \"I lived in a family where people got mad all the time.\" \"So that's how being close feels to me.\" \"You lived in a family where no one showed feelings.\" \"We also never hit each other.\" \"So when I'm a little upset, it scares you?\" \"Yes.\" \"It just means I'm comfortable with you.\" \"It doesn't mean I don't love you.\" \"Did you get the clothes today?\" \"Yes, it's in the closet.\" \"There.\" \"Isn't it yummy?\" \"Your dad used to like peanut butter too.\" \"Yes, he did.\" \"So did your uncle David.\" \"Not your aunt Charlotte.\" \"She really didn't like it, always didn't.\" \"Still doesn't.\" \"Isn't it funny?\" \"They were all little babies once too.\" \"But their dad's mom never liked being with them the way I like being with you.\" \"She never really liked me, and she never liked my kids.\" \"She thought I had a baby on purpose to make Nathan marry me.\" \"Which wasn't true at all.\" \"I never wanted that to happen.\" \"Especially when I was so young.\" \"I was scared when your dad was born.\" \"Really scared.\" \"Hey, Mom.\" \"Oh, you surprised me.\" \"Did she give you any trouble?\" \"No, not at all.\" \"She's an angel.\" \"Are you ready to go home, angel?\" \"I made you chicken.\" \"No, thank you, I have to go home.\" \"But... put it in the fridge.\" \"I'll eat it tomorrow.\" \"If you and Lily want a night off, I'd be happy to watch her.\" \"You could go out to eat, see a movie.\" \"I could keep her here overnight.\" \"Thanks, but Lily's working tonight and Maya hasn't slept outside the family bed yet.\" \"Maybe it would be good if she tried to sleep by herself at night.\" \"Mom, we know how you feel.\" \"You've told us.\" \"We don't agree.\" \"She's almost nine months old.\" \"She can't always sleep with us.\" \"Charlotte will tell us when she's ready to sleep alone, okay?\" \"Good night.\" \" Good night, Grandma.\" \" Good night.\" \"Are we going to hug?\" \"Okay.\" \"Let me clean myself first.\" \"Morning.\" \"What time is it?\" \"A bit before ten, I think.\" \"How do you like your drink?\" \"Plain.\" \"What are you doing today?\" \"Class.\" \"What class?\" \" Drawing class.\" \"We're learning to draw a round shape.\" \" That sounds fun.\" \" It's not.\" \"It's boring and hard.\" \"And not important.\" \"I went to art school to be creative, not to do some unimportant task like a mouse.\" \"Do you want to skip class?\" \"Yes.\" \"Adam, I need your help with the Folger goodbye event today.\" \" Who's Frank?\" \" Frank who?\" \"He's on the schedule every Wednesday at two.\" \"I don't know.\" \"It must be someone Benjamin put there.\" \"There's a phone number.\" \"I'm going to call and ask.\" \"Okay, no.\" \"Kevin and I are talking with a helper.\" \" Really?\" \" It's not a big thing.\" \" Are you guys OK?\" \" Yes, we're OK.\" \"We're just talking with a helper to make our relationship better.\" \" What happened?\" \" Nothing happened.\" \"Kevin gets angry easily, and I let people do what they want too much.\" \" Can we not talk about this anymore?\" \" Sure.\" \"You're OK though?\" \" Can we not talk about this anymore?\" \" Okay.\" \"And how are you and Lily?\" \"We're good.\" \"It's still a little strange to me.\" \"All the different ways my life could have been.\" \"I mean, about a year ago I asked someone to marry me.\" \"Do you remember?\" \"I thought I loved Bella.\" \"Maybe I thought I could make it work just because I wanted it to.\" \"But... you just never know.\" \"You don't know what life will be like.\" \"So can you help with the Folger goodbye event or not?\" \"Are you sure you're okay?\" \"I'm okay.\" \"I've got a test for the Happy Men's Song group of LA city.\" \" What?\" \" That sounds good.\" \"I'm trying to make something for myself outside of my work and my friendship.\" \" I could use your help.\" \" All right.\" \"Don't worry.\" \"The park thing's easy.\" \"You just do your best.\" \"No joke intended.\" \" I'm so nervous.\" \" David, you'll be good.\" \"From your words to God's ears.\" \"All right.\" \" Thanks, Nathan.\" \" Any time.\" \" Hello.\" \" Hi, it's Lily.\" \" Hello.\" \" Rachel, did you give Maya peanut butter?\" \"Yes, and she liked it.\" \"Nathan...\" \"You never give babies peanut butter before they are one.\" \"They can get bad allergies.\" \"Didn't you know that?\" \"No, I didn't.\" \"Is she okay?\" \"Yes, but that's not the point.\" \"You should never give her peanut butter.\" \"Or honey, or strawberries, or egg whites.\" \" Please.\" \" Of course.\" \" I'm sorry to be so straight with you.\" \" No, I'm sorry.\" \"I had no idea.\" \"Peanut butter was never a problem when my kids were young.\" \" Are you sure she's okay?\" \" She's fine.\" \"Do you need any help with her today?\" \"I could come over.\" \"Rachel, no.\" \"You spend so much time over here.\" \"I feel bad.\" \" It's no problem, I like...\" \" Seriously, take some time for yourself.\" \"I hardly saw Maya at all yesterday.\" \"I really just wanted it to be the two of us today.\" \" OK.\" \" But thanks.\" \"I'll talk to you later.\" \"Thank Goodness.\" \"It's very scary.\" \"I didn't know who to call.\" \"Ma'am, calm down and tell me what happened.\" \"Come.\" \"I'll show you.\" \"It's strange when you find stuff like that out later in life.\" \"I mean, I had no idea that I wasn't planned.\" \"I'm not sure what difference it makes.\" \"I mean, Maya wasn't planned and we couldn't love her any more.\" \"It's just...\" \"I don't know.\" \"What?\" \"I don't like knowing that my whole life is an accident.\" \"It's just too... random.\" \"Yeah, but that's the way it happened.\" \"Things happen the way they're supposed to, Nathan.\" \"See, that's a kind of belief that I just don't agree with.\" \"Well, what other choice do we have?\" \"We make choices.\" \"But maybe your mom and dad would not have chosen to marry if you were not born.\" \"And then you, Charlotte and David would not be here.\" \"It's not what was supposed to happen.\" \"But surely we're more than just things that happen, right?\" \"Maybe we are, maybe we're not.\" \"I like it when she does that.\" \"When she sort of twitches.\" \"Right before she falls asleep.\" \"She wakes herself up.\" \"You were worried the first time she ever did it.\" \"I remember feeling like I was falling when I was little.\" \"Like I was falling from the bed.\" \"It always woke me up.\" \"Like I was scared of what...\" \"You were going to fall into?\" \"Yes.\" \"It doesn't happen to me now.\" \"Don't be so sure.\" \"What's happening with you?\" \"I think I dreamed this.\" \"What?\" \"This time.\" \"Just this.\" \"This life we share.\" \"You and me, Madison.\" \"Here.\" \"Now.\"", "hash": "221186ec493c428844fc93ef0e907a50a69a4bc332f961ce7d3e3c94c52af313"}

it.\" \"The O's must have a toy.\" \"This is our one clue.\" \"The Thin Man.\" \"Our favorite stranger.\" \"That's right.\" \"This needs to go get looked at.\" \"Yes, let's go there and do that.\" \"Let me see it.\" \"Yeah, I know exactly what this is.\" \"I have one.\" \"The sisters gave it to us at the home.\" \"Home.\" \"Good job.\" \"Matthew is in our safe place now.\" \"It's up to us to keep him safe.\" \"Hey, I know the safest place in town.\" \"Listen, don't you worry about a thing.\" \"No O ever set foot in SO place.\" \"Can you understand it?\" \"Yeah.\" \"This is my mama house.\" \"Rule number one:\" \"Don't look her in the eye.\" \"Understand?\" \"Or she'll be upset.\" \"Can you understand it?\" \"Benjamin.\" \"Yes, ma'am?\" \"You come here.\" \"Hey, Mama.\" \"What kind of problem you in now?\" \"I'm not in any problem\" \" Yes, ma'am.\" \"Come on.\" \"Yes, ma'am.\" \"Look at those toys.\" \"Boys!\" \"Look at those toys.\" \"Boys!\" \"Mother will see you now.\" \"Mother, do you know this man?\" \"Of course I know who he is.\" \"We called him Anthony, after St. A of P, helper of the quiet.\" \"Please come forward.\" \"Please, girls.\" \"But his real name, like so much about him, was a secret.\" \"He came to us when he was 7.\" \"He was found in the hills, living off roots and bugs.\" \"We think his family was in a circus who had a bad fire.\" \"Although the doctors could find nothing wrong he never spoke a word.\" \"And there were other odd things.\" \"He was a very shy child until it was time for his monthly haircut.\" \"...until it was time for his monthly haircut.\" \"Then one morning, he was simply gone.\" \"The Thin Man was keeping Matthew safe.\" \"So you're saying this man is the only helper of your home?\" \"Yes, he really is an angel.\" \"Mother, have you seen him since?\" \"Well, not really that much except for the odd haircut now and then.\" \"But he does send gifts.\" \"Like this morning.\" \"Emma's car.\" \"That is a nice car.\" \"An old car.\" \"A famous drama.\" \"I know.\" \"Bird poo.\" \"What group did you girls say you were from again?\" \"A kind of gull.\" \"A bird from CA state.\" \"Bird poo is mostly made of hard scales.\" \"Fish that ate big brown plants, I'd guess.\" \"There's also bits of boat fuel and rain water in it too.\" \"Sea birds, boats, rain water.\" \"SA city's port.\" \"Who are you?\"

'And the woman?' 'What's it to you?' 'That's between her and me.' 'I should mind.' 'That lady is mine.' 'I don't think she would agree.' 'I don't mind.' 'She'll change her mind.' 'You're so sure.' 'Because I'm always right.' 'I've always been right.' 'We'll see.' 'Don't forget my warning.' 'You want me to sing a song you wrote for her?' 'I won't sing it.' 'It's a show.' 'You have to sing what's on the album.' 'I recorded it, but I won't sing it at the show.' 'Why not?' 'I don't want to.' 'Please.' 'Sing it for me, OK?' 'Hey.' 'Do you know how I feel?' 'I do.' 'You'll sing it?' 'You're mean.' 'Only because it's a good song.' 'I'm a singer after all.' 'Miss.' 'You're not eating.' 'I don't feel good.' 'Please excuse me.' 'A man should know when to act.' 'Yes?' 'It's a small binoculars.' 'I want you to have it.' 'Let's eat out tomorrow night.' 'You promised.' 'Good night.' 'Ivy.' 'You have to go somewhere with me.' 'Where?' 'Olivia's show.' 'Ivy.' 'Wait.' 'It's not about Olivia, OK?' 'Listen to me.' 'It's something important to us.' 'Understood?' 'It's something important to us.' 'Ivy.' 'Ivy!' 'She's a nice girl.' 'We know her well.' 'She's pretty, and she's successful.' 'That ring will get you any girl.' 'Going to Olivia's show, sir?' 'Of course.' 'Good luck.' \"Thank you.\" \"Let's go.\" \"Why did you take me here?\" \"Listen to the words.\" \"Did you make up this song?\" \"I wanted to play a musical instrument.\" \"But I wanted to be with you.\" \"I'll play it for you another time.\" \"Sorry for being silly.\" \"That's fine.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Do you like it?\" \"Yes.\" \"I love it.\" \"What?\" \"I have a present.\" \"What is it?\" \"Does it look nice?\" \"Thank you.\" \"For what?\" \"For being born.\" \"For meeting me.\" \"And for being with me.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Hello.\" \"You sang very well.\" \"Such a fun party.\" \"Isabel.\" \"Hello, sir.\" \"What are you doing here?\" \"Shouldn't you be with my Samuel?\" \"He said he had some information for you.\" \"He might still be waiting for you.\" \"I need to leave.\" \"I'll explain everything later.\" \"Sorry.\" \"Sir.\" \"That boy.\" \"I know.\" \"It's the boy we saw on the street.\" \"I have a bad feeling about him.\" \" Investigate.\" \" Yes, sir.\" \"A place\" \"Adam\" \"Liam\" \"Jessica\" \"Henry\" \"Chapter 2\" \"Will you tell me why?\" \"I thought all night.\" \"About why you said no.\" \"But I don't understand.\" \"I can't understand.\" \"That's why...\" \"I can't accept it.\" \"I told you.\" \"I love someone else.\" \"That's what I don't understand.\" \"You're a very nice person.\" \"But love is very different from feeling sorry.\" \"It's not feeling sorry.\" \"Gabriel doesn't need anyone's pity.\" \"You didn't know how I felt about you?\" \"I knew.\" \"You knew?\" \"You really knew?\" \"You can't imagine how much I love you.\" \"Until now, I've always had my way.\" \"You might say I was lucky, but I worked hard too.\" \"I wasn't raised as some rich man's spoiled son.\" \"I know you're a good person.\" \"And I always thought I'd end up marrying you one day.\" \"I really did.\" \"What made you change your mind?\" \"On the day of my wedding, I realized that wasn't the life for me.\" \"So I ran away.\" \"A few years with your family made me think this was my place.\" \"But then I saw him and understood... that my spot is with him.\" \"You're wrong.\" \"I'm not.\" \"So he's... the issue.\" \"I'm sure you'll find someone better than me.\" \"There's no one better.\" \"You'll change your mind.\" \"I won't.\" \"It tastes good.\" \"It does?\" \"Gabriel!\" \"Come have breakfast!\" \"Why are you here?\" \"This girl here, she's good in the kitchen.\" \"The perfect wife, I think.\" \"Come and eat, Isaac.\" \"OK.\" \"Isabel, you cooked all this?\" \"Gabriel.\" \"I'm jealous.\" \"What should I eat first?\" \"Good, huh?\" \"It's yummy.\" \"(\"It's not good?\")\" \"Come on, look at me.\" \"Something's troubling you?\" \"Nah.\" \"Nice weather.\" \"Isabel.\" \"Yes?\" \"What if we move somewhere else?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Like go to another land.\" \"Another land?\" \"Many people go.\" \"To HA land or the ST land.\" \"We'll have to start from scratch though.\" \"But I like my work here.\" \"I like it that people laugh and cry with me.\" \"I like being able to talk with them.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Not everyone can do your job.\" \"The boss is waiting for you.\" \"Is he?\" \"You keep missing the rhythm.\" \"Sorry for disturbing you.\" \"It's OK.\" \" He's the boss.\" \" And Officer Adam's dad.\" \" Nice to meet you.\" \" Hi.\" \"I should say who I am first.\" \"My name is Isaac Henry.\" \"What's yours?\" \"Mr. Yoo.\" \"Gabriel.\" \"What's up with you?\" \"What instrument is this?\" \"Hello, sir.\" \"Ah, Isabel.\" \"Keep doing well.\" \" It's time.\" \" Let's go.\" \"Gabriel.\" \"What's up?\" \"You should try to be nice to him.\" \"Gabriel.\" \"What's up?\" \"Is it about Boss Adam?\" \"Cheer up.\" \"Play me that song again.\" \"Isabel.\" \"Let's stop.\" \"What?\" \"Stop what?\" \"You and I... we aren't a good match.\" \"Gabriel.\" \"Go home.\" \"What's up with you?\" \"You really want to move away?\" \"I thought you were joking.\" \"Did you mean it?\" \"Do you want to learn songs?\" \"We're not the same, you and I.\" \"We'll find a way to be okay.\" \"We can't.\" \"I can't do what you do.\" \"And you can't do what I do.\" \"That's not right.\" \"Find someone else.\" \"Someone who can give you everything you need.\" \"Someone much better.\" \"Just yesterday you wanted to move.\" \"Was it fun?\" \"I'm not good enough for you.\" \"Yesterday I was and today I'm not?\" \"Yes.\" \"Things changed.\" \"So just go.\" \"Catching animals is the best game ever.\" \"Does it have to be Isabel?\" \"Yes.\" \"I decided on the day we met.\" \"OK.\" \"If that's what you want.\" \"So what will you do now?\" \"Out of sight, out of mind.\" \"I'll send him away.\" \"Good.\" \"All we need is for him to leave.\" \"Be happy.\" \"Do you want to go to the US?\" \"Yes.\" \"Is something wrong?\" \"I'm just after the coins, so you don't have to tell me.\" \"But you have to get to SH city first.\" \"I'll need a gift.\" \"I'll get it for you.\" \"We'll have to put a lot in the next song, now that you're with us.\" \"Here.\" \"Thank you.\" \" I'm going, then.\" \" OK, bye.\" \"Let him be.\" \"We have to know what the coins are for.\" \"Watch him and see if he has a stick.\" \"OK.\" \"Nothing came up when we looked at his past.\" \"His dad fixes radios.\" \"That's not possible.\" \"There must be something else.\" \"Talk to the Security man.\" \"You're so sweet.\" \"Eat this.\" \" Eat.\" \" He's that sweet?\" \"Isn't he?\" \"I think he is.\" \"Why is dad so late today?\" \"He's just busy.\" \"What's wrong with you?\" \"This is where you work.\" \"We have rules here.\" \"Away for two days...\" \"Why are you here?\" \"At yesterday's talk, the boss decided to... make less song shows.\" \"We're still talking about what to do with the music group.\" \"Is he in the group too?\" \"Yes.\" \"Do you come and go as you want?\" \"He stays up at night to practice, so...\" \"Tell why you were away for two days.\" \"I want a sorry and a reason.\" \"Then I'll think about your music group's next step,\" said Adam. \"Your friends might not have work soon because of you.\" \"Let go!\" \"Let go!\" \"Let go of me!\" \"Let go!\" \"Let go of me!\" \"Let go!\" \"Let go of me!\" \"Calm down,\" he said. \"Let go!\" \"Let go of me!\" \"Gabriel!\" \"Let go!\" \"Gabriel!\" \"Gabriel!\" \"Gabriel!\" \"I'll stop him!\" \"Gabriel!\" \"Have you lost your senses?\" \"Gabriel.\" \"Gabriel.\" \"Gabriel.\" \"Gabriel.\" \"Gabriel.\" \"Gabriel.\" \"Gabriel.\" \"Gabriel.\" \"Gabriel.\" \"Gabriel!\" \"Gabriel...\" \"Are you OK?\" \"Yes.\" \"It won't hurt me.\" \"That's good.\" \"Why were you fighting?\" \"It seemed like he just started it.\" \"He did this in front of everyone.\" \"What if it had just been us two?\" \"He's not usually like this.\" \"Musicians can be tough.\" \"They're not always nice.\" \"They don't know how to keep quiet.\" \"And they react when they're in a tough spot.\" \"They act nice at first, but in the end, they show their true selves.\" \"I can't follow your life's path.\" \"And you can't follow mine.\" \"Should we move somewhere else?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Not anyone can do your job.\" \"Gabriel!\" \"Gabriel!\" \"Gabriel!\" \"I'll stop him!\" \"Gabriel!\" \"Have you lost your senses?\" \"Isabel.\" \"Where are you going?\" \"Just somewhere.\" \"No.\" \"I'll be back in a few days.\" \"Go ask for Mr. Sam.\" \"Give him this letter and the money.\" \"Then he'll help you get past the problem.\" \"It's safe from there to SH city.\" \"Mr. Victor...\" \"He went to AN town today.\" \"He'll be back tomorrow.\" \"If things don't work out, I'll say you paid me to look for a place to stay.\" \"Understand?\" \"I have nowhere to go.\" \"Let me stay for a while.\" \"Go.\"\"Go.\" \"Go.\" \"Get moving.\" \"Hear me out.\" \"I've been thinking.\" \"You changed suddenly.\" \"I wondered if this is the real you.\" \"Then I decided not to think about it.\" \"Gabriel that I know isn't in my head, but in my heart.\" \"It's not what I know, but what I feel.\" \"You're telling me to leave, but your eyes want me to stay.\" \"Don't be stubborn.\" \"I have nowhere to go.\" \"I'll sleep outside if you make me leave.\" \"Are you asleep?\" \"I know you're not.\" \"I heard you sigh.\" \"I want to see everything.\" \"Your good and bad.\" \"Cry when you're sad.\" \"Shout when you're mad.\" \"Just don't hit anyone again.\" \"Should I just get hit?\" \"See, you're awake.\" \"I'm not mean enough to hurt anyone smaller than me.\" \"But he did something to me, to hurt me.\" \"And so I'll make him pay.\" \"For the poor innocent beings he hurt.\" \"That's what I must do.\" \"Do you know what you did?\" \"Tell me and you'll be okay.\" \"I got the J country people to hurt people.\" \"You're wrong!\" \"You ignored everyone's pain.\" \"Got that?\" \"I didn't.\" \"I'm a good, kind person.\" \" Don't you agree?\" \" Stop that.\" \" Don't you?\" \" Stop that!\" \"Don't you all think I'm a good person?\" \"!\" \"You hurt my dad!\" \"You bad person!\" \"No...\" \"Isabel.\" \"Isabel!\" \"No!\"\"No!\"\"No!\"\"No!\" \"No!\" \"No!\" \"No!\" \"No...\" \"Dad.\" \"Oh, hello there.\" \"Why are you still up?\" \"I woke up to study for my lesson tomorrow.\" \"Did you?\" \"I told you not to come out when it's dark.\" \"Go back to your books, then.\" \" OK, fine.\" \" Dear one.\" \"Who's there?\" \"That's just silly!\" \"What if he DID aim right?\" \"!\" \"My daughter was there!\" \"It's from the head of safety.\" \"Shouldn't we just stop him?\" \"Will you hug me?\" \"I'm such a silly.\" \"I can't do anything right.\" \"Good job.\" \"Good job what?\" \"I don't know.\" \"But everything you do is always right.\" \"Always.\" \"She called to say she'll take a few days off.\" \"Dear fellow K country people, in K country and far away.\" \"This is Kevin speaking.\" \"The J country people who came to our land... have begun to leave.\" \"If we're to be free, we must...\" \"Who's William?\" \"To the brave friends... who fought so bravely,\" \"I say that their work was not for nothing.\" \"This is a very touching time for us all.\" \"The JN people are going back.\" \"As some countries disappear, other countries are sure to come up.\" \"I think it's our turn to...\" \" Hello, sir.\" \" Hey, it's you.\" \"Why are you here?\" \"A friend of William stays here.\" \"I need to talk to him.\" \"About what?\" \"I heard he makes and fixes radios.\" \"People making radios at home...\" \"I'm sure they're listening to those secret brave friend broadcasts.\" \"Really?\" \"Then we need to bring him in.\" \"If we can find who Sophia and Yosef's contact is, we can bring the whole group in.\" \"Yeah?\" \"The tricky...\" \"Hey, let's talk.\" \"Let's chat.\" \"Who was it?\" \"The son of a man I hurt.\" \"I should've stopped him when I could.\" \"Kevin should've, more like.\" \"If you were still Kevin, I bet you'd do it yourself.\" \"But as you're now Isaac, boss of three big companies, you'll need my help.\" \"Please.\" \"This might help.\" \"We found this in his room.\" \"[Radios, Music players]\" \"Mister.\" \"Gabriel.\" \"He looks just fine on the outside, but he is sad on the inside.\" \"Why?\" \"He plays the trumpet with more than just his breath.\" \"He plays it with his whole self.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"He saw... someone hurt his dad right in front of him.\" \"I'll help, guard, and take care of you.\" \"I will.\" \"I will, I promise.\" \"Me too.\" \"Promise.\" \" It's night, go home.\" \" OK.\" \" Come with us.\" \" Quietly.\" \"Gabriel.\" \" What's happening?\" \" Stand back.\" \"What's this about?\" \"I'm sure it's nothing.\" \"Don't worry.\" \"Gabriel.\" \"Walk.\" \"What's happening?\" \"They're bringing people in for listening to secret broadcasts.\" \"Some local radio stations were even closed.\" \"What?\" \"You may work here, but secret broadcasts are still not allowed.\" \"What did I do wrong?\" \"Sir.\"\"Sir.\" \"Sir.\" \"Officer.\" \"You know what you did.\" \"Sir...\" \"Offi...\" \"Get out.\" \"I'm friends with the boss!\" \"I'm going to call him.\" \"Oh dear,\" they say I have a book that I didn't write. Mr. Liam from our place got hurt really bad and he isn't with us anymore. It's so scary. You can help him. So please do it. I CAN help him. If you were in trouble, I'd do everything... to help and save you. Help him. I can only say one thing. I'm sorry. Samuel. I'll do anything to help him get out. You'll give something to help him? OK, then. What should I ask? I wonder what you can give. I'll help. But not for him. It's you I'm helping. Thank you. All I want... is for you to give me more chance. A little more time than you do now. I'll stop him as soon as he's out. No. Don't hurt him. What? Let him be. Give him time to make some happy times with her. Does it hurt? It's OK. It's not. You're hurt all over. One look at you and I'm all better. That's silly. Going somewhere? To get some food. The lady says it's a rule. \"Thomas!\"\"Thomas!\" \"Thomas!\" Stop the music a bit. Sir. Is this about Mr. Thomas? Give him his work back. Or he'll be taken to JA country. This came today. It's not possible. Why? We let all the music people go. The others all found other work, but Thomas was in a bad place. Many, many have been taken to work in JA country. It's our job as people who live here. I know how you feel, but there's nothing we can do. I don't know about fights, living here, or jobs. All I know is that a good man... has to go work hard with a hurt body. Every other man on the street is taken for work. It's not like he'll fight for his life in a bad place. We have to win a fight. He's just doing his part. Why don't YOU go to JA country, then? Women go too. Want me to tell them about you? Don't worry. He'll come back not moving. Good, thank you. \"Thank you.\" \"Don't you feel he's not the type we need?\" \"We need all the help we can get.\" \"We want our friends to win.\" \"Oh, are things very bad?\" \"Let's go away.\" \"Deep into a big hill.\" \"To where no one can find us.\" \"You're not going.\" \"You won't last in the work.\" \"I won't let you go.\" \"I'll be back.\" \"I'm not going to fight.\" \"I promise I'll be back.\" \"I'll keep all my money, so think of something you want.\" \"OK?\" \"A place with water and trees\" \"How do you make songs?\" \"Do they just come to you?\" \"Close your eyes.\" \"What's the first thing you see?\" \"From when you were a kid.\" \"My dad's eyes.\" \"Think harder.\" \"Do you hear anything?\" \"A sound?\" \"Sleep, sleep...\" \"Sleep, my precious little one.\" \"Oh, you can remember sounds too.\" \"Write that down and it becomes a song.\" \"Your face, voice, how you look.\" \"I'm writing the Isabel I remember.\" \" Patrick.\" \" Here.\" \" Katherine.\" \" Here.\" \"Thomas.\" \"Yosef.\" \"Here.\" \"Yosef!\" \"Kevin.\" \"Here.\" \"Why are you late?\" \" Let's go inside.\" \" Yosef, you too?\" \" Dad.\" \" Sophia.\" \"Go home.\" \"Write to me.\" \"Just being strong doesn't work.\" \"Use some skill.\" \"Kevin.\" \"You know how to use fireworks?\" \"Yes.\" \"Why?\" \"Yosef.\" \"No letters yet?\" \"She'll write.\" \"I heard NE city's winters are very cold.\" \"Is that why?\" \"Is the work really hard?\" \"Why won't you write to me?\" \"(Dear Isabel) Are you still there?\" \"I can't feel you anymore.\" \"I'm scared.\" \"It feels like you're not here anymore.\" \"(To Thomas Isabel)\" \"I hope you're doing fine.\" \"I won't be mad at you, so please send me a letter.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"I'll do that, sir.\" \"Yes.\" \"(To Thomas Isabel) OK.\" \"Sure.\" \"Yeah, him.\" \"Place 16 is our best chance, right?\" \"Yeah.\" \"It's the place with the weakest part.\" \"If only he'd go away.\" \"\"Say hello to Mr. Gabriel for me.\"\" \"\"He gave me some sweets.\" \"I still have them.\" \"I taste them once per day.\"\" \"\"And I thank him all the time.\"\" \"You visited often while I was away?\" \"My Sophia said you told her you were helping me.\" \"She talked about you all the time.\" \"We'd play a game and she'd suddenly say she missed you.\" \"I wasn't around to see her when she was born.\" \"We moved to the big city to start fresh...\" \"What happened to your wife?\" \"There was this man who hurt her family when she was little.\" \"She saw him on the street one day.\" \"She went to see him and didn't come back.\" \"Good night.\" \"You're going to see him?\" \"Yes.\" \"You can't go that far alone.\" \"I can.\" \"It's been a long time already.\" \"I can't keep doing this.\" \"JA town\" \"I want to see Yara Gabriel.\" \"No.\" \"Why not?\" \" Jack Isaac.\" \" Here.\" \" Nathan Gabriel.\" \" Here.\" \"Be quiet.\" \"Don't cough.\" \" Hannah.\" \" Here.\" \"You silly.\" \"Come here.\" \"Be quiet!\" \"Don't cough!\" \"What are you looking at?\" \"You silly!\" \"Silly.\" \"Stop it.\" \"You can't just stop coughing if you want.\" \"Isn't this too hard?\" \"Why don't you stop?\" \"Back to work.\" \"Go!\" \"Yosef.\" \"You have a special job today.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"You have to prepare.\" \"Help your leader.\" \"OK.\" \"Please.\" \"You silly!\" \"We came all the way from KR country.\" \"Let her in.\" \"Careful.\" \"Gabriel.\"\"Gabriel.\"\"Gabriel.\" \"Gabriel.\" \"Gabriel.\" \" Gabriel.\" \" Isabel.\" \"Don't fall behind.\" \"I'll wait here.\" \"I'll wait for you.\" \"Later, I'll see you later.\" \"Come here!\" \"Later, see you later.\" \"Wait for us, Isabel.\" \"Hurry.\" \"How can they sleep here?\" \"We're in trouble.\" \"We all have to help.\" \"OK, good job, everyone.\" \"Leave all your things here today.\" \"OK.\" \"Isabel.\" \"Gabriel.\" \"Hello, friend.\" \"Where are your toys?\" \"We were told to leave them.\" \"You two, go back and get them.\" \"Go back.\" \"Wait for us.\" \"Yosef, see you.\" \"Follow me.\" \"Let's hurry.\" \"How long have you two been apart?\" \"Why do we have to get all these toys anyway?\" \"Gabriel.\" \"Gabriel, no.\" \"Let me in.\" \" Move.\" \" Isabel.\" \"Isabel!\" \" Isabel.\" \" He's inside.\" \" Isabel.\" \" He's inside.\" \"Save us!\" \"Someone's in there, help him.\" \"Gabriel's still in there!\" \"Isabel.\"\"Isabel.\" \"Isabel.\" \"He'll be OK.\" \"He'll come out.\" \"Playland\" \"Samuel\" \"Liam\" \"Jack\" \"David\" \"Story 3 There it goes again.\" \"Let's turn off the lights.\" \"Victory\" \"We have a special announcement for all

collapsed.\" \"We dug ourselves out.\" \"We were on the run.\" \"Gabriel.\" \"I have to see Isabel.\" \"You know what she'll do if she thinks I'm gone.\" \"He went to a post office to send you a letter.\" \"I told him it was too dangerous, but he insisted.\" \"We ran into some soldiers.\" \"And then?\" \"That's the last I saw of him.\" \"Did you get married?\" \"To that officer?\" \"Things are bad enough without you breaking things.\" \"(Blue Note)\" \"Juice tastes better now that we're free.\" \"Yeah, I agree.\" \"Let's go home.\" \"All that smoke was bothering me.\" \"You're...\" \"It's you...\" \"It IS you...\" \"I knew you'd come back alive.\" \"Guess we really are free now.\" \"Gabriel...\" \"Gabriel...\" \"Gabriel...\" \"Isabel...\" \"Where is she?\" \"Everyone at the radio place had already gone home.\" \"You don't know?\" \"That lady...\" \"She got married.\" \"We all thought you were not here anymore.\" \"To that man?\" \"Where are you going?\" \"What will you do?\" \"You think they will welcome you back happily?\" \"Gabriel.\" \"Hey, Gabriel.\" \"I can't believe it.\" \"I thought those soldiers made you go away forever.\" \"It's nice to see you.\" \"The bad time is over.\" \"Stay here with me tonight.\" \"Oh, and Yosef's here too.\" \"That room...\" \"Mister!\" \"Sophia!\" \"Have you been fine?\" \"Yes.\" \"Yosef!\" \"I knew you would be okay.\" \"Did he come back?\" \"Thank you.\"\"Thank you.\" \"Thank you.\" \"I didn't do anything.\" \"You're here.\" \"You really are...\" \"Yes.\" \"I'm here.\" \"I waited for you outside the big hole in the ground for many days.\" \"During that time, I was making a tunnel back to you.\" \"I lit a lamp for you at a special place.\" \"I went there every day, but then...\" \"I thought you wouldn't be here to think of me.\" \"So I stopped thinking of you I tried to move on.\" \"I always thought of you.\" \"And I didn't go away.\" \"I thought you did.\" \"You should've told me that you were okay.\" \"You should've told me.\" \"You didn't get my note?\" \"Someone destroyed it.\" \"Who did?\" \"The man who tried to hurt me.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"The big boom.\" \"It wasn't just a mistake?\" \"It was made to look like a mistake.\" \"What?\" \"Listen to me.\" \"Just hear me out.\" \"The man who made my dad go away wants me to go away.\" \"The time I was taken, the hard work, everything...\" \"He's behind it all.\" \"Who?\" \"Mister Patrick.\" \"Mister Patrick?\" \"My father-in-law?\" \"Gabriel...\" \"Someone made this go boom on purpose.\" \"Gabriel.\" \"You two, go back and get them.\" \"Isabel.\" \"That man...\" \"He must not know that I'm here.\" \"I slept in fields and on piles of hay.\" \"I ate whatever I could find.\" \"I walked around like some wild animal.\" \"But I didn't worry.\" \"Because I thought of you...\" \"I sometimes forgot about you...\" \"That's OK.\" \"Thinking of you kept me going.\" \"So...\" \"What now?\" \"What did your dad do before he became a worker?\" \"Why do you ask?\" \"I'm just wondering.\" \"I just know he moved a lot...\" \"He met many people.\" \"He wasn't a helper?\" \"I would have known.\" \"I would have seen his outfit.\" \"Sorry.\" \"It's been strange since JA country lost the fight.\" \"Let's start our family.\" \"A letter...\" \"I never got an important letter.\" \"We were in a fight.\" \"Letters often got lost.\" \"I didn't say it was during the fight.\" \"Letters seldom get lost now, so I thought.\" \"Is that so?\" \"Yes.\" \"Do you go see them often?\" \"Thank you for your hard work.\" \"We became free thanks to those brave people.\" \"Sure, I'll talk again soon.\" \"Goodbye.\" \"They owe me a lot.\" \"I gave them the money from the JA government.\" \"We should do something too.\" \"I agree.\" \"We need to find work.\" \"I've been making plans.\" \"I'm going to make a newspaper.\" \"The big clouds are covering the sun...\" \"This is the day we must say goodbye...\" \"Until we see each other again...\" \"Until we see each other again...\" \"Goodbye...\" \"Goodbye...\" \"We'll see each other again when the flowers bloom...\" \"Look who's here.\" \"Where have you been?\" \"You should know BL place pays a lot.\" \"Can you pay me first?\" \"First?\" \"Sure.\" \"If you take care of all our shows.\" \"Look at all these lines I used to love your head.\" \"Forget about love and payback.\" \"Just have some fun.\" \"That's the right thing to do.\" \"OK?\" \"Well?\" \"It looks good.\" \"The helpers called to say they need some workers.\" \"Isabel's dad thinks I'll help them.\" \"As a helper...\" \"I'm sure... we'll soon find enough things to stop President Patrick.\" \"A letter.\" \"I never got an important letter.\" \"From Yosef\" \"How are you?\" \"I'm doing OK.\" \"I'm just happy I can see you again.\" \"You don't make songs anymore?\" \"It's much harder now.\" \"But you're a song maker and a saxophone player.\" \"And you're nice enough to give a stranger who took your saxophone a lot of money for school.\" \"I said something when we said goodbye.\" \"We are not the same anymore.\" \"Look, we are living different lives.\" \"It's strange that we live in the same town now.\" \"I like being with you.\" \"I hope we can meet often.\" \"I don't want to lose you again.\" \"If only I hadn't seen the cave fall.\" \"I'm sure I wouldn't have married then.\" \"I understand.\" \"So your marriage should end.\" \"Hey.\" \"Where were you?\" \"I got a call.\" \"You can go back to your job.\" \"Job?\" \"Yes They're asking all you workers to come back.\" \"Oh, and another thing.\" \"Someone who talks English called.\" \"But I didn't understand.\" \"English?\" \"Excuse me, sir.\" \"I want you to meet my friend, Sam.\" \"We studied together in school.\" \" He studied Law.\" \" Law?\" \"Interesting.\" \"My job is related to laws and police work.\" \"In fact, we need someone to help with translating.\" \"If there is anything I can do, I'd be happy to help,

ago.\" \"It wasn't me.\" \"You better leave before.\" \"What do you?\" \"There was a man with a toy gun.\" \"Was any one hurt?\" \"Just one of my friends.\" \"But he'll be okay.\" \"Why?\" \"Are you happy?\" \"Because the man with the toy gun wasn't found?\" \"Were you ever a police officer?\" \"Is that what the music player told you?\" \"He said you did something to his dad.\" \"That silly boy...\" \"How did he know me?\" \"Your mark...\" \"It's just by chance.\" \"I was never a police officer or did anything bad.\" \"I heard that silly boy came back with someone from a work place.\"

\"Don't worry We'll find those guys.\" \"I'm sure you will.\" \"I feel bad for all those dads who don't have a son like you.\" \"So...\" \"Are you okay?\" \"We should have just scared him.\" \"A toy won't work.\" \"Then what?\" \"A big bang toy?\" \"Yes.\" \"Yosef.\" \"There are guards everywhere.\" \"Do they know it's us?\" \"I think so.\" \"My Sophia...\" \"Sophia, are you drawing?\" \"Drawing and singing too.\" \"It's the pretty lady.\" \"Gabriel is always looking at your picture.\" \"Is he?\" \"He sometimes holds it close to his heart.\" \"Really?\" \"Don't you miss your dad?\" \"I don't have a choice.\" \"He's always really busy.\" \"I just play alone, then go to bed.\" \"But he always comes back.\" \"Good girl.\" \"You're good.\" \"Oh, I have a picture too.\" \"Want to see it?\" \"Sure, who's in it?\" \"It was my mom's.\" \"I don't see your mom.\" \"That's my mom's dad.\" \"Is Gabriel doing OK?\" \"I need your help.\" \"Someone's following me.\" \"I know you.\" \"You're not capable of hurting someone, then acting like it never happened.\" \"I know you too well.\" \"I have no choice.\" \"One of us has to go away.\" \"You have to run.\" \"You're a wanted man.\" \"Go hide. I'm not saying it'll be forever.\" \"Only until we find the Boss.\" \"We just need proof.\" \"Just a little more time and...\" \"I have the proof.\" \"That's Sophia's grandpa...\" \"They both played tricks on the freedom fighters.\" \"He hurt his friend's family to keep the secret.\" \"And Sophia's mom, who recognized him...\" \"There was this guy who hurt her whole family when she was young.\" \"She saw him on the street one day.\" \"She went to see him and didn't come back.\" \"You think so?\" \"You just don't know how bad that man is.\" \"Don't worry.\" \"How can I not worry?\" \"Part of me went away the day the big hole blew up.\" \"If something happens again...\" \"I won't survive.\" \"It's OK.\" \"Don't come here again.\" \"Don't say that.\" \"That man...\" \"He might hurt you too.\" \"I don't want to put you in danger too.\" \"Let's run away.\" \"Go somewhere really far.\" \"Let's go.\" \"I can leave everything behind for you.\" \"I can't do that.\" \"You can make a car go boom with this.\" \"Are you alright?\" \"Yes, I am.\" \"Samuel.\" \"Let's have food outside today.\" \"(a famous jazz club)\" \"I'm really happy today.\" \"You asking me to have food outside.\" \"Have some more.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Do you like your work?\" \"Yes.\" \"Now I can talk to you.\" \"It felt like we were far away until now.\" \"You've been a great friend to me.\" \"I won't forget all you've done.\" \"You'll have a lot of happy memories, then...\" \"Why are you here?\" \"Leave him alone.\" \"What are you saying?\" \"I'll act as if I know nothing about your past.\" \"So I want you to stop too.\" \"I've had enough.\" \"Think about what he's faced.\" \"I'm sure you'll want to stop all this.\" \"Why should I think about him?\" \"I didn't do anything bad.\" \"I'm not guilty.\"

enough!\" \"Calm down Calm down?\" \"!\" \"Are you OK?\" \"I wanted to get back at him.\" \"I really wanted to get back at him!\" \"You're awake.\" \"Dad.\" \"How do you feel?\" \"Dear...\" \"I thought you were going to get hurt.\" \"I won't get hurt.\"\"I won't get hurt.\" \"I won't get hurt.\" \"About the case of the leader...\" \"Look into every one who knows Gabriel.\" \"Is Adam not here yet?\" \"About him, sir.\" \"He's Henry's friend...\" \"Don't tell him about this game, then...\" \"Understand?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Hey, you.\" \"Your zipper.\" \"I just said that so you'd bow to me.\" \"Hello.\" \"How are you?\" \"I'm glad you're not badly hurt.\" \"You're glad?\" \"Pardon?\" \"Is this what I get for playing with the kids?\" \"That's not what I meant.\" \"Sorry if I upset you.\" \"I did what I had to do.\" \"There's no point in talking about what happened.\" \"Fighting is wrong, whatever the game.\" \"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth is only fair.\" \"And offense is the best defense.\" \"Take care of yourself.\" \"Sure, I will.\" \"You should do the same too.\" \"Alice.\" \"Is he doing well?\" \"I think my dad's right.\" \"It was those two who tried to scare him.\"

\"Thank you.\" \"For being born.\" \"For meeting me.\" \"And for being with me.\" \"There are things you just know...\" \"Such as?\" \"That you're pretty.\" \"Your forehead, nose, hands, hair, even your neck.\" \"They're all pretty.\" \"It's not what I know, but what I feel...\" \"Cry when you're upset.\" \"Shout when you're angry.\" \"Just don't hit anyone again.\" \"I can leave everything behind for you.\" \"I'm silly I helped the boy I wanted to scare.\" \"That's why you're special.\" \"That's why I like you.\" \"I'll help, protect, and care for you.\" \"I will.\" \"I will, I promise.\" \"Me too.\" \"Promise.\" \"You look tired.\" \"It's nothing compared to what my dad went through.\" \"I don't know who's behind this, but the teacher will find him.\" \"And he'll be in trouble.\" \"You think?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Samuel.\" \"Listen to me carefully.\" \"It can't be.\"\"It can't be.\" \"It can't be.\" \"You must be mistaken.\" \"Your dad scared Henry's dad, then tried to scare Henry.\" \"Do you know how I feel?\" \"No way.\" \"No.\" \"Ask Mr. Jack to get two more toys.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Isabel asked me something.\" \"If you were a helper...\" \"Her and that silly person.\" \"They got it wrong.\" \"Samuel.\" \"I'm your dad.\" \"I promise I was never a helper and I never hurt anyone.\" \"That silly boy thinks he knows something about me.\" \"Right?\" \"Yes.\" \"You're big enough to understand.\" \"It's a big world for a boy...\" \"It's hard to run a toy shop.\" \"People might not like you and want to be mean.\" \"Sometimes you feel really sad...\" \"I did what I had to, what I thought was right.\" \"Are you OK?\" \"I'm sorry.\" \"Sorry, Dad.\" \"Show them that you did nothing wrong.\" \"That man and Isabel, they need to know the truth.\" \"They must say sorry.\" \"And that man, he must learn his lesson.\" \"Jack.\" \"I need a favor.\" \"I want to know everything my dad does.\" \"Do you understand?\" \"The trouble with Mr. Gabriel was because he was mean.\" \"Really?\" \"Why do you think that?\" \"I know he was not nice.\" \"I'm sure he was mean to many people.\" \"They wanted to teach him a lesson.\" \"To understand this, we have to look at what he did before.\" \"You're right.\" \"But try not to upset anyone.\" \"OK, sir.\" \"I'll keep this for now.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Hey, you.\" \"Do you know anything?\" \"Why is the Boss so worried about Mr. Gabriel's trouble?\" \"We have other troubles too.\" \"The Boss and Mr. Gabriel are old friends.\" \"We have to solve this trouble soon.\" \"One day, his friend Matthew told the truth.\" \"They both got a prize for helping stop 24 naughty people.\" \"Speak.\" \"Go ahead, Gabriel.\" \"My dad came here even though he was hurt.\" \"You're wrong.\" \"Kids sometimes remember things wrong.\" \"I remember everything.\" \"I'm not confused.\" \"A car stopped.\" \"A man ran.\" \"You ran after him and caught him.\" \"Then you caught my dad who saw everything.\" \"Why would he catch that man and your dad?\" \"Exactly I'm curious too.\" \"That was a long time ago.\" \"The year you built your toy shop.\" \"You wanted the money for the brave helpers.\" \"That's what the man was carrying.\" \"You have a mark on your right hand, between your fingers\" \"Why did you give me that note?\" \"Why?\" \"No.\" \"Samuel.\" \"He's wrong, Samuel.\" \"Dad.\" \"The strong always win over the weak.\" \"You think the brave helpers even had a chance to free us?\" \"The US country freed us because they were strong.\" \"You got to finish school because I was strong.\" \"I even paid for Isabel's school too.\" \"Dad.\" \"Yes.\" \"I'm your dad.\" \"Aren't you really strong when you can live without hurting the weak?\" \"I kept my family safe.\" \"You did?\" \"Yes.\" \"I am a good dad.\" \"Please don't.\" \"Do you have to do this?\" \"I wouldn't have married you if I knew he was still here.\" \"The years we spent together mean nothing to you?\" \"How do you think he feels about me living here?\" \"Him, him, him!\" \"Is he all you think about?\" \"I don't want to live here.\" \"I don't like living with your dad.\" \"It's my dad you don't like. It's not me, right?\" \"So we're not done, right?\" \"Your dad will never say he was wrong.\" \"But what you did to Gabriel...\" \"I know...\" \"I know...\" \"If something happens to him, I'll think it's your dad.\" \"Nothing will happen to him.\" \"You're not like your dad, right?\" \"I hope you're not.\" \"Gabriel's the one who helped you.\" \"Please stop hurting us all.\" \"Please.\" \"I want the boss.\" \"Catch that mean guy.\" \"I'll give you anything if you catch him.\" \"Get him here!\" \"So I can deal with him myself\" \"So you saw \"Kevin,\"\" \"the man who is now Boss Ben?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then...\" \"They're after the mean people.\" \"And also those who agree with the mean guys.\" \"They let us down.\" \"And helped the mean guys to scare us.\" \"Those who had any part in hunting, hurting, or getting rid of brave helpers must answer for what they did.\" \"Let's go north.\" \"We have no other place to go.\" \"We can't just hide in some room.\" \"Run first, then...\" \"What about Sophia?\" \"I bet he took it.\" \"You kept all that stuff?\" \"Why didn't you get rid of everything?\" \"Who would've thought he'd come in?\" \"Let it go.\" \"He took my stuff too.\" \"He's looking at us right under my nose.\" \"We'll find him.\" \"How?\" \"He's with the police.\" \"Let's think.\" \"A way to solve all our problems.\" \"Let's blame Gabriel, and his group as being bad people.\" \"You mean, changed teams?\" \"Catch Isaac the minute you see him.\" \" OK?\" \" Yes, sir.\" \"Something's wrong?\" \"We have a problem.\" \"William went far away.\" \"The police are saying Gabriel and I are bad people.\" \"You mean, \"for the bad team?\"\" \"Any one they dislike is \"for the bad team\"\" \"And your work?\" \"I have to be quiet.\" \"Don't worry though.\" \"I have all the proof I need.\" \"I'll wait.\" \"But Gabriel...\" \"It's OK, you can go.\" \"Sir.\" \"I can do this alone.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"The JA police made a special team.\" \"Its main job was to catch members of a group.\" \"Better known as the National Team for Freedom.\" \"Your dad and the Chief of Police worked together on this.\" \"So what did they do, really?\" \"They found and caught members.\" \"And eventually stopped them.\" \"Your dad's a smart man.\" \"He even got a special award from the team's leader in GD place.\" \"Hello?\" \"He stopped you from following her?\" \"He's following her?\" \"Gabriel.\" \"Gabriel?\" \"Sophia Yes?\" \"Do you like the city or the country?\" \"The country What about you?\" \"Me?\" \"I like the country too.\" \"Which part?\" \"I lived in the village next to yours.\" \"You did?\" \"I'd love to visit.\" \" Let's go together one day\" \" OK.\" \"What is it?\" \"Is something wrong?\" \"Isaac's in trouble.\" \"William, him, and you are wanted as bad people.\" \"You're not safe here.\" \"Who should I stop first?\" \"Sophia...\" \"Leave Sophia alone.\" \"I learned I must leave no one.\" \"Thanks to you.\" \"What's my daughter in law doing here?\" \"You love him so?\" \"More than my son?\" \"Samuel asked me not to do anything to him\" \"The silly one who insulted me in front of my son\" \"Have you forgotten what you did?\" \"You hurt this man's daddy!\" \"I did!\" \"I hurt him!\" \"For coins!\" \"And now I'll hurt you all!\" \"Daddy, no!\" \"No, Daddy.\" \"Let go!\" \"Daddy...\" \"Daddy...\" \"Isabel!\" \"Run away!\" \"Daddy!\" \"Isabel, run!\" \"Samuel!\" \"Go, now!\" \"You\" \"Daddy!\" \"Please stop.\" \"Samuel.\"\"Samuel.\"\"Samuel.\"\"Samuel.\" \"Samuel.\" \"Samuel.\" \"Samuel.\" \"Samuel!\" \"Sam...\" \"No...\" \"Not you, no...!\" \"Samuel!\"\"Samuel!\" \"Samuel!\" \"The people, names, and groups, in this story are all make-believe\" \"Any same things are just by chance\" \"Thank you for listening\"", "hash": "9064e61aa6787e7d5e8338aa6a0d65c5dcfb92e00564e1cdc6f9106a940fff2f"}

everyone in chains and send them to a far, cold place to work hard, and Adam\" \"will be in big trouble\" \"King, the whole royal family can't be arrested just like that.\" \"What should I do then?\" \"Trust me.\" \"Trust me completely.\" \"Don't you want too much from me, sir?\" \"King, you have two choices:\" \"you either punish me right away or trust me fully.\" \"Well, excuse me, I trust you.\" \"Tell me what I should do.\" \"This is the paper I prepared for this case.\" \"Please sign\" \" Sign\" \"and I'm ready to go.\" \"Hold on, Patrick.\" \"Patrick, do you care for me?\" \"I do,

trip\" \"Better?\" \"You are not alone.\" \"Your wife, your mother, your sisters and brothers\" \"What can I do?\" \"You can save yourself and everyone.\" \"How?\" \"Prince,\" \"this night is ours.\" \"I told the King that I knew about the plot to warn and stop it.\" \"He trusted me like a kid.\" \"You've been mean to him.\" \"Yes, I have.\" \"I did that to help you.\" \"You've been mean to me and him.\" \"Who will you be mean to in the end, sir?\" \"Will it be me, him or both of us?\" \"Who are you helping, sir?\" \"For RU country.\" \"A crazy king is very scary.\" \"A crazy man with a sharp thing.\" \"Why don't you like him?\" \"No, I don't dislike him\" \" I don't like being unfair.\" \"You used to say, sir that you want to be nice to RU country.\" \"I believed you then.\" \"But you

first.\" \"Really?\" \"But you told me you never did it.\" \"My first time telling on someone.\" \"Yes.\" \"Who was this boy?\" \"Samuel.\" \"The same Samuel?\" \"I had to tell on him.\" \"Now\"

kids without parents live.\" \"Good job.\" \"Matthew is safe with us now.\" \"It's our job to keep him safe.\" \"Hey, I know the safest place in town.\" \"Listen, don't worry about anything.\" \"No Samuel has ever been to the south part of town.\" \"Do you understand?\" \"Yes.\" \"This is my mom's house.\" \"First rule:\" \"Don't look her in the eyes.\" \"Got it?\" \"Or she'll burst.\" \"Do you understand?\" \" Ben.\" \" Yes, ma'am?\" \"You come here.\" \"Hello, Mama.\" \" What trouble are you in now?\" \" I'm not in any trou...\" \"Yes, ma'am.\" \" Let's go.\" \" Yes, ma'am.\" \" Look at those doors.\" \" Boys!\" \"The head lady will see you now.\" \"Mother, do you know this man?\" \"Of course I know who he is.\" \"We named him Adam, after a kind helper.\" \"Please come forward.\" \"Please, girls.\" \"But his real name, like so much about him, was unknown.\" \"He came to us when he was 7.\" \"He was found walking in the hills, eating roots and bugs.\" \"We think his family was in a circus group who passed away in a big fire.\" \"Although the doctors found nothing wrong, he never spoke.\" \"And there were other strange things.\" \"He was a very shy kid until it was time for his monthly haircut.\" \"Then one morning, he was simply gone.\" \"The Thin Man was protecting Max.\" \"So you're saying this man is the only helper of your home?\" \"Yes, he really is like an angel.\" \"Mother, have you talked with him since?\" \"Well, not really that much except for the occasional haircut now and then.\" \"But he does send gifts.\" \"Like this morning.\" \" Ethan's car.\"

before.\" \"Never heard of a different kind of IR country?\" \" Different IR country?\" \" Yes, that's right.\" \"Who do you think made the famous sandwich, lucky cereal, huh?\" \" Tasty shake?\" \"That's ours.\" \" Give me your papers.\" \" What?\" \" Your papers.\" \"You have the courage to ask me for my papers.\" \"My family had a hard time, because there were no potatoes.\" \"Sick cows.\"

that, try the four-leaf clover.\" \"McGinty!\" \"Put this stuff on the ship.\" \" Tough, eh?\" \" That was heavy.\" \"I think we should rest.\" \"Wait a moment.\" \"I think something is wrong.\" \"This ring is made of a precious metal.\" \"The toy rings are made of a strong metal.\" \"Toy chips should be light with a hole in the middle that keeps them cool.\" \"If something is lighter than the liquid it is in...\" \"It floats.\" \"There they are.\" \"I'm sure Hannah was great, but I can't imagine life without David.\" \" Let's go, friends.\" \" Cheers to that.\" \"Why are you in a hurry, Hannah?\" \"You've been here for a little while.\" \"I've waited for you before.\" \"In fact, I've waited for you for many, many days.\" \"That's a lot of weeks.\" \"That's many months.\" \"That's a bunch of years.\" \"Let's talk about you now.\" \"How are you, Hannah?\" \"How have you been?\" \"Samuel.\" \"I see you're still looking good.\" \"You're brave to take from me.\" \" It's more like taking back.\" \" Give us the rings.\" \"Give us the rings.\" \"Give us the rings!\" \"Don't lose those.\" \"We'll be taking them back soon\" \"In a little while.\" \"I've been dreaming I'd see you again and watch something bad happen to you.\" \"Keep dreaming.\" \"Lights.\" \"Somebody turn on the lights!\" \"Samuel.\" \"Samuel!\"\"Samuel!\" \"Samuel!\" \"You know I always like it when the light is on.\" \" You don't know me anymore.\" \" I'm the only one here who knows you.\" \"Wait, wait, wait!\" \"I've got to say, Hannah, I've always liked you a lot.\" \" Always wanting what you can't have.\" \" Yeah?\" \"I'll have you any way I want.\" \"I got the rings.\" \"Let's leave!\" \"Don't let them leave!\" \"Understand?\" \"Let's go, now!\" \"Let's go.\" \"David, let's go.\" \"You can't hurt me anymore, Hannah.\" \"I'm gonna teach you and your friends a lesson.\" \"I'm gonna hurt them just so you can hear them yell.\" \"David!\" \"I got the rings.\" \" Are you okay?\" \" Yeah, I'm okay.\" \"Let's go.\" \"I know who did it.\" \"I really know who did it.\" \"Mr. Mustard, in the dining room, with a stick.\" \" Mr. Mustard?\" \" Give me that.\" \" Mr. Mustard?\" \" I said, Mr. Mustard in the dining room, with a stick.\" \" Go ahead and look in there.\" \" Why don't you look.\" \"Mr. Must...\" \" Mr. Mustard?\" \" Right.\" \"Mr. Mustard?\" \"Mr. Mustard?\" \"It's Mr. Plum in the garden room, with a candle.\" \"That's right.\" \"You got it right.\" \" Oh!\" \" How did you know that?\" \"We had one just like him a long time ago, remember?\"  \"About what?\" \"Just look.\" \"I know we just moved in together.\" \"Really?\" \"Yes.\" \"And we agreed to take things slow.\" \"But...\" \"Yes?\" \"There's something I have to ask.\" \"Oh, no.\" \"Yes. 'Oh, no' is right.\" \"Here goes.\" \"Spin me around first.\" \"Alright.\" \"Hey!\" \"That question, Peter?\" \"Let's discuss it later.\" \"Here are all your things.\" \"What happened?\" \"She left.\" \"She isn't coming back.\" \"She really liked these boots.\" \"She doesn't want us to get hurt.\" \"Wait, you girls take risks every day.\" \"Yes.\" \"I'll never forgive myself if something happens to you.\" \"What's next, Charles?\" \"Natalie, Alice.\" \"You need to stay positive.\" \"Any updates on the O'Grady family, Charles?\" \"Any news on how Sam escaped from jail?\" \"He didn't escape,

you.\" \"It was a pleasure.\" \"I hope to work with you girls again.\" \"But not too soon.\" \"Good luck with everything.\" \"Your keys.\" \"What's wrong?\" \"My side hurts.\" \"These aren't mine.\" \"That was a good stretch for a boy with a hurt side.\" \"Well done, Ben.\" \"We got him.\" \"We got who?\" \"Of course, he already had one ring.\" \"He just needed the other one.\" \"He wanted to pretend to die so he wouldn't be suspected.\" \"Who are you talking about?\" \"He needed time for his plan, so he tricked Sam.\" \"Then he sent him after Diana.\" \"I think you're right, girls.\" \"Oh no!\" \"So Cameron's the bad one!\" \"It's just a guess right now, Ben.\" \"We need proof.\" \"Keys, Ben.\" \"Let's go.\" \"Rude.\" \"Path is open.\" \"You can go now.\" \"Almost there.\" \"Careful.\" \"Well done, Adam.\" \"Can we leave now?\" \"No, you can't, little one.\" \"I have to check if it's safe.\" \"We might be late.\" \"You won't be late, child...\" \"You silly old bear!\" \"Little one,

handle's broken.\" \"I can't turn it off.\" \"We're still trading.\" \"Early in the morning, just as we talked about.\" \"Nora, change of plans!\" \"I'm calling for Ben.\" \"We'll help you, Adam.\" \"Hold on.\" \"Follow the stars beyond the sky.\" \"Go to the shore to find hope.\" \"Stop at a step.\" \"A step?\" \"Find a man with a map.\" \"Ben, can you hear me?\" \"Ben, we need to change plans immediately.\" \"I'm ready.\"\"I'm ready.\" \"I'm ready.\" \"Okay?\" \"Now, move away.\" \"We're changing plans.\" \"Move away!\" \"Stop!\"\"Stop!\" \"Stop!\" \" Let's go.\" \" Okay.\" \"Hurry up.\"

David.\" \" See you, Ben.\" \" Yeah, okay, okay.\" \"This isn't fair.\" \" Katherine.\" \" Hello, David.\" \"Don't you have a problem to solve?\" \"Well, I tried to run from my past, but it found me yesterday.\" \"And I put my friends in danger.\" \"They're in more danger now without you.\" \"Natalie and Adam are going to find someone else.\" \"A real Angel.\" \"Not someone who's pretending to be something she's not.\" \"Your past is what makes you who you are, David.\" \"Don't forget that Cameron chose you for a reason.\" \"Angels are like diamonds.\" \"They can't be made.\" \"You have to find them.\" \"Each one is different.\" \"Sometimes we look too hard for answers that are right in front of us.\" \"The buyers are ready.\" \"We did it, friend!\" \"You know, I never really got that friend thing.\" \"Hello, Angels.\" \"Madison.\" \"Why?\" \"Why be an Angel when I can play a game?\" \"Looks like one of the three friends has gone away.\" \"Welcome back, David.\" \"You're such a normal stubborn Fish.\" \"Always trying to show how tough you are and you couldn't make it one day by yourself, could you?\" \"Someone reminded me that every Angel is different.\" \"And I knew it was you.\" \"Who else had friends in MO country could stop the big jump fail-safe and hire a surfer as a helper?\" \"Same star sign person who would call a bike rider with a lion on his helmet as \"Leo.\"\" \"Very well done.\" \"Very impressive, really.\" \"You've figured it all out.\" \"And now I'm gonna enjoy knocking those halos off your heads.\" \"But you're an Angel.\" \"No.\" \"You just don't understand.\" \"I don't listen to a speaker box anymore.\" \"I work for myself.\" \"Well, your boss is not nice.\" \"The Angels strong pose.\" \"Seeing the three of you like that makes me remember the old days.\" \"But back then, it was different.\" \"You see, when I was an Angel we used toys.\" \"Sorry, Cameron.\" \"Hello, Angels.\" \"Good evening, Cameron.\" \"I love the new room.\" \"Madison, is that you?\" \"Where are the Angels?\" \"I'm sure there are three more where they came from.\" \"Madison, what did you do?\" \"We're just having a little fun.\" \"You shouldn't worry, Cameron.\" \"You've never had trouble finding someone to help you.\" \"Hurting the Angels doesn't show you're the best.\" \"You know that.\" \"Do I?\" \"Madison, you never liked that this group is about teamwork.\" \"We're a family.\" \"We do...\" \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.\" \"Angels forever.\" \"I've heard the talk.\" \"It was very nice once.\" \"Madison, you went on your own on the car case and put your fellow Angels in danger.\" \"When we finally took you away, you were so hurt, we thought we might lose you.\" \"You did lose me.\" \"Being an Angel wasn't what I was supposed to do.\" \"It was stopping me from it.\" \"Your path is not decided yet.\" \"Don't do this, Madison.\" \"Hurting people is not the answer.\" \"There must be something in you that's still good.\" \"I was never good.\" \"I was great.\" \"Oh no.\" \"She's not nice!\" \"Friends, we have to outsmart Madison.\" \"No matter what we try, she's always ahead of us.\" \"She's selling the list tonight, when it's dark.\" \"But where?\" \"Nora, what else did Cameron say?\" \"Okay.\" \"\"Look at the stars beyond the sky.\"\" \"It's safe to say it's on this planet.\" \"\"Go to hope and stop on a step.\"\" \"There's a Hope Street in the city.\" \"But no beach for miles.\" \"A step.\" \"A step?\" \"A step!\" \"Maybe a bump on the head.\" \"I'm worried.\" \"Friends, the stars.\" \"Hollywood Walk of Fame.\" \"Beyond the Galaxy Theatre.\" \"There's DS, BH and FA.\" \"Good job, Nora.\" \"Yeah!\" \"I think she's trying to hurt us.\" \"I can't believe it.\" \"We are here in Hollywood.\" \"Angels?\" \"I knew we could do it...\" \"Quiet, please!\" \"What?\" \"I mean, not you, Mom.\" \"Sorry.\" \"Have you lost your senses?\" \"Yeah.\" \"I mean, no.\" \"We'll talk about this later.\" \"DC\" \"TY\" \"ACF\" \"Welcome to the GW of...\" \"Quiet.\" \"Give us the map.\" \"Yay!\" \"Jack!\"\"Jack!\"\"Jack!\" \"Jack!\" \"Jack!\" \"I love you!\" \"I hear the next one's crazy.\" \"The first one was great.\" \"Button your coat.\" \"What?\" \"Button your coat.\" \"The special meeting is at the top.\" \"You're in trouble for trying to block justice.\" \"Stop!\" \"The KG trick.\" \"Classic.\" \"And still works.\" \"We didn't wear safety gear until I got hurt.\" \"On the DS case!\" \"We know!\" \"Don't tell me you forgot about plan B.\" \"I'd know that backside anywhere, you naughty...\" \"Let's do this.\" \"Speak up.\" \"Can I join in?\" \"No!\" \"The big show will be fun.\" \"Benjamin, plan two!\" \"There are many girls!\" \"Plan two means 'plan Benjamin'.\" \"Yes!\" \"Get her!\" \"Get her!\" \"Get her!\" \"Amazing.\" \"They put a lot of effort into this.\" \"Alright!\" \"David!\" \"Alice!\" \"This is the moment.\" \"Are you ready?\" \"Are you?\" \"Fight or lose.\" \"Thrilling, isn't it?\" \"Who are you?\" \"You want to know who I am, Nora?\" \"Then you look inside your heart.\" \"No, Madison.\" \"I'm not like you.\" \"I have something you don't.\" \"And what's that?\" \"Friends.\" \" Enjoy the good place.\" \" Go to the bad place.\" \"She won't have a job anymore.\" \"Party time.\" \" Angels!\" \" Benjamin!\" \"Angels!\" \" Did you all get that flying girl?\" \" Yes!\" \" Did you touch her?\" \" Yes!\" \"Did you kick her?\" \"Did you kick her?\" \"Mom, I told you!\" \"I know it!\" \" We couldn't have done it without you.\" \" Never!\" \" You hear that, Mom?\"

\"Be careful with that, Ben.\" \"I'm all right.\" \"And I also see y'all being tricked.\" \"Five G's for a safety vest?\" \"We need those.\" \"They're made especially for us.\" \"What?\" \"Y'all are nice, but you're crazy.\" \"What?\" \"Benjamin, come here.\" \"Have a seat, Ben.\" \"Okay.\" \"Ben.\" \"What?\" \"B.\" \"Your brother didn't worry about the details.\" \"We do what it takes.\"

friends.\" \"Good morning, Charlie.\" \"Good morning, friends.\" \"Good morning, Charlie.\" \"Bosley, I hope the friends aren't being too hard on you.\" \"Man, please.\" \"I date big women.\" \"What are you saying?\" \"Good job in MO country, friends but I'm afraid there is a new problem.\" \"Oh no!\" \"What the?\" \"Look!\" \"Look!\" \"I know where I'm watching the game tonight.\" \"Look at that.\" \"Friends, I'd like to introduce Roger, a top person from the police.\" \"Nice to meet you.\" \"Nice to meet you too.\" \"Hi.\" \"Hello.\" \"Over time, the Townsend Agency has worked on things for the police but never one with so many people in danger.\" \"Hey, I'm busy watching that screen.\" \"Good job, Bos.\" \"Friends, you know about the program that helps people who tell on bad guys.\" \"People who tell on big bad guys are moved and given new names.\" \"These people's new names are protected by a program called HALO.\" \"HALO helps hide these new names.\" \"The names are kept safe on two strong rings.\" \"The information on each ring can't be understood alone but when they are read together, they make sense.\" \"Who has the rings?\" \"The head of the police had one.\" \"Ray.\" \"Good morning.\" \"Hey, how do you feel?\" \"Some hurt ribs, but I'll be okay.\" \"Who has the other ring?\" \"The top safety person for the Justice Department, William.\" \"Sadly, he was hurt this morning.\" \"Now both rings are not safe.\" \"So the names are not safe.\" \"Someone's told the big bad families they can sell the names.\" \"Some bad families want to buy.\" \"One of our protected people, Alan, was found hurt at home.\" \"Friends, we need to get the HALO rings back before the names are sold.\" \"We'll start at Alan's house.\" \"See if that helps us find HALO.\" \"Hey, Charlie, we could really use Bosley's help on this one.\" \"Get to drive the racecar?\" \"Not today.\" \"Do you need to break a big house?\" \"No, Ben.\" \"So, what do you need me to do?\" \"Understand some actions.\" \"Yes, of course.\" \"Finding clues person\" \"Taking pictures person\" \"Team leader\" \"Doctor\" \"I don't want to go near someone who is not alive.\" \"Stop, girls.\" \"If you are not

believe it or not, we have another big problem, and it's not nice.\" \"A big problem?\" \"Did you find a place with too many small animals on the place?\" \"A big problem?\" \"Did you find a place with too many small animals on the place?\" \"It's a place with lots of small animals.\" \"But you're good.\" \"Don't move from here.\" \"Be careful with what you see, we'll go inside the house with you.\" \"Well, I don't understand.\" \"Again, I don't understand.\" \"I have to ask my boss.\" \"Your boss is here.\" \"Don't touch.\" \"If you were good at the learning place, you should figure this out.\" \"Just a heart stop.\" \"A strange person stopped breathing.\" \"Just a heart stop.\" \"A strange person stopped breathing.\" \"Questions?\" \"Looking at the mouth shows food stuck in the mouth.\" \"Okay, let's do this.\" \"Let's go, friend.\" \"David shows no signs of hurt to the throat.\" \"His actions show that he didn't stop breathing.\" \"He was not allowed to breathe.\" \"Girls, we found some sticky stuff.\" \"Fruit.\" \"Oh, it's a special wax.\" \"Best for your wooden board.\" \"Excuse me?\" \"The person who did this is a sea player.\" \"How do you know?\" \"He used the card he uses to clean his board to get into the house.\" \"Bad sea players.\" \"Stop!\" \"I found a different mark.\" \"He was wearing special shoes.\" \"A special version sold only in one shop, in the summer of a long time ago.\" \"There's a difference in weight between the left and right sides.\" \"A leg that was fixed in the last year.\" \"Okay, who did it?\" \"A bad guy with a mark on his leg who likes to surf.\" \"Did he smell bad?\" \"There's a big wind near the sea.\" \"That means big waves at the south beaches.\" \"Was there a lot of red liquid?\" \"Windy weather, Third Point.\" \"The beach is busy.\" \"Adam, the surfboards are at your house.\" \"Share it with me, friends.\" \"Stop!\" \"Daddy?\" \"Daddy!\" \"sweetie!\" \"I was going to meet your mom in BA place, and they stopped

waiting games.\" \"I know.\" \"Aren't they fun?\" \"Let's play!\" \"Only one toy left.\" \"Wait a moment.\" \"He has a mark on his knee.\" \"Look at it.\" \"Brown pants, red board, it's time.\" \"What do you think?\" \"Nice.\" \"That's what I thought.\" \"Game over.\" \"Nathan, move in.\" \"David thinks he's cool.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"You always like the naughty boy.\" \"Then this boy must be very naughty.\" \"You should see the new playhouse.\" \"It's beautiful.\" \"Maybe I will.\" \"Say hi to Charlie for me when you see him.\" \"You know.\" \"There she goes.\" \"Who do you think will be the first of us to leave?\" \"You, me or Nathan?\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"I think it'll be Nathan.\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"I think it'll be Nathan.\" \"Why?\" \"Did he say something?\" \"Nathan and Peter live together now.\" \"Soon they'll be best friends and you and I will wear pink dresses at their play date.\" \"Yeah, but even if she got married, she'd never leave

first time--?\" \"Cameron's at the finish line.\" \"I was thinking maybe\" \"You and Peter moving in together is a big step.\" \"Yes, it's great, isn't it?\" \"So where do you think this is going?\" \"Going?\" \"I'm confused.\" \"Okay, let's say someone asked me:\" \"\"Hey, David, do you think Nora wants to get married?\"\" \"What?\" \"Did Peter ask you to ask me if I wanted to get married?\" \"No.\" \"Because we just moved in together.\" \"Watch out, I've seen Ryan.\" \"I'm following him.\" \"Red bike, red helmet.\" \"Nora, number 25.\" \"Look at this.\" \"The big cat.\" \"That's Liam.\" \"I see it.\" \"The guy in blue.\" \"I missed it.\" \"What was that?\" \"He's chasing Liam.\" \"He just pushed a guy at the front end.\" \"He's getting closer to Liam.\" \"I'm going to catch him.\"

man.\" \"He's not alive anymore.\" \"What is happening?\" \"Hey, you're just a little one.\" \"I'm 15 and a half.\" \"Pictures.\" \"Alan.\" \"Matthew.\" \"How did you know my real name?\" \"What's this?\" \"Hey, this is a picture of David.\" \"The name on the back is Hannah.\" \"Hannah.\" \"My name before I changed it 8 years ago.\" \"And then I became David.\" \"When the important people realized the young girl's potential they contacted me.\" \"Okay, wait.\" \"Hannah?\" \"Yes.\" \"That's your name?\" \"Yes.\" \"Hannah.\" \"So where does that name come from originally?\" \"Is that from AU country?\" \"Yes.\" \"Oh, my goodness, you must have been the subject of every joke.\" \"Did you drive a fancy car?\" \"Adam, we're being silly.\" \"Yes, you are.\" \"Don't worry, David.\" \"We're still gonna be your best friends.\" \"Now, friends, a rose by any other name still smells as sweet.\" \"Thank you, Charlie.\" \"It's not that funny.\" \"Yes, it is.\" \"Ben, can I get an opinion on this one?\" \"You sure can.\" \"You know what?\" \"Personally, I'm not interested in Hannah.\" \"I'm more concerned about yours.\" \"No matter what, you're still gonna be our David.\" \"Thank you, Ben.\" \"You're welcome.\" \"Let me guess, you fell for the bad boy.\" \"I fell for the worst boy.\" \"But he was so cute, and I liked him so much.\" \"We had so much fun together just driving around, listening to loud music and.... 8 years ago\" \"And then one night, things got really bad.\" \"I love you!\" \"I would do anything for you, Sam!\" \"O.\" \"You are brave.\" \"He said he'd hurt me if I told anyone, but I had to report him.\" \"Of course you did.\" \"You did the right thing.\" \"He was my first.\" \"Really?\" \"But you told me you never did it.\" \"My first report.\" \"Yes.\" \"Who was this boy?\" \"Sam O.\" \"O?\" \"Like in a bad group of people?\" \"I made sure he went to jail.\" \"Right now\" \"Oliver.\" \"You have to leave.\" \"Oliver, what about your stuff?\" \"So if I have these, she will find me?\" \"The Oliver family hurt my mom and dad.\" \"What?\" \"I'm sorry, Matthew.\" \"I told the truth about them.\" \"Hold on a moment.\" \"Adam.\" \"He told the truth about the Oliver family.\" \"That's all.\" \"The Oliver family must have something valuable.\" \"This is our only clue.\" \"The Thin Man.\" \"Our tricky enemy.\" \"That's true.\" \"This should be looked at by someone smart.\" \"Yes, let's go and do that.\" \"Let me look at it.\" \"Yes, I know exactly what this is.\" \"I have one.\" \"The nice ladies gave it to us at the children's home.\" \"Children's home.\" \"Good job.\" \"Matthew is safe with us now.\" \"It's our job to keep him safe.\" \"Hey, I know the safest place in town.\" \"Listen, don't you worry about anything.\" \"No Oliver family member ever came to the South part of town.\" \"Do you understand?\" \"Yes.\" \"This is my mom's house.\" \"Rule number one:\" \"Don't look her in the eyes.\" \"Got it?\" \"Or she will be upset.\" \"Do you understand?\" \"Benjamin.\" \"Yes, ma'am?\" \"Come here.\" \"Hi, Mom.\" \"What kind of problem are you in now?\" \"I'm not in any trouble.\" \" Yes, ma'am.\" \"Let's go.\" \"Yes, ma'am.\" \"Look at those big doors.\" \"Boys!\" \"Look at those big doors.\" \"Boys!\" \"The head lady will see you now.\" \"Head lady, do you know this man?\" \"Of course I know who he is.\" \"We called him Adam, after a kind man.\" \"please come forward.\" \"please, girls.\" \"But his real name, like so much about him, was unknown.\" \"He came to us when he was 7.\" \"He was found alone in the hills, living off plants and bugs.\" \"We think his family was in a traveling show who had a bad accident.\" \"Even though doctors said he was healthy, he never said a word.\" \"And he was a bit different.\" \"He was a very shy boy until it was time for his monthly haircut.\" \"...until it was time for his monthly haircut.\" \"Then one morning, he was simply not there anymore.\" \"The thin man was protecting Matthew.\" \"So you're saying this man is the only one who supports your children's home?\" \"Yes, he really is a helper.\" \"Mom, have you spoken with him lately?\" \"Well, not really that much except for the occasional haircut.\" \"But he does send presents.\" \"Like this morning.\" \"Ethan's car.\" \"That is a nice vehicle.\" \"An old car.\" \"A famous drama.\" \"I know.\" \"Bird droppings.\" \"What group did you girls say you were from again?\" \"A type of bird.\" \"A kind of bird.\" \"Droppings are mostly made of fish scales.\" \"Small fish that eat big brown plants, I'd say.\" \"There's also some tanker fuel and rainwater in there as well.\" \"Sea birds, tankers, rainwater.\" \"SP city.\" \"Who are you?\" \"What?\" \"!\" \"Wait.\" \"What?\" \"Who are you?\" \"Oh, Jack.\" \"The actor.\" \"Maybe you've seen a big movie.\" \"No.\" \"It was a very popular movie.\" \"What are you doing here?\" \"I'm Alice's boyfriend.\" \"Alice's boyfriend.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Well, technically, we're on what she calls a break.\" \"What does that mean?\" \"Exactly.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Yeah.\" \"I have to say, you must be the world's most understanding dad.\" \"Why?\" \"All the wild things she does.\" \"When I first met Alice, I thought she was a waxer.\" \"It took months before I knew about Charlotte.\" \"Who's Charlotte?\" \"SP city\" \"A kind of hat.\"

information incoming.\" \"Got you, baby.\" \"Yeah, check the photo.\" \"That's our guy.\" \"The big box.\" \"Do a little dance.\" \"Give a little love.\" \"Get down tonight.\" \"There he is, first table on the right.\" \"Yeah, baby!\" \"Wait.\" \"Patrick?\" \"Good morning to you.\" \"You know, you just don't look like any Patrick I've ever seen before.\" \"Ever heard of a dark IR country?\" \"Dark IR country?\" \"That's right.\" \"Who do you think made the meat sandwich, lucky cereal, huh?\" \"Green shake?\" \"That's ours.\" \"Give me your papers.\" \"What?\" \"Your papers.\" \"You've got nerve to ask me about my papers.\" \"My family had a hard time, man, because there were no potatoes.\" \"Foot and mouth disease.\" \"Mouth sores.\" \"Circumcision.\" \"Circumcision?\" \"Right, my wife just had twins.\" \"Both little people.\" \"Little people?\" \"Take a sniff.\" \"IR country soap.\" \"If you don't believe that, clean yourself with a lucky plant.\" \"Matthew!\" \"Get this stuff on the ship.\" \"Tough, huh?\" \"That was heavy.\" \"I think we should take a break.\" \"Wait a second.\" \"I smell a rat.\" \"This ring is pure shiny metal.\" \"The ring toys are another type of metal.\" \"The toy data chips should be light with a hollow core that keeps them from getting hot.\" \"If the thing is lighter than what it's in....\" \"It floats.\" \"There they are.\" \"I'm sure Isabel was great, but I can't imagine life without David.\" \"Come on, let's leave.\" \"Cheers to that.\" \"What's the hurry, Isabel?\" \"You've only been here a little while.\" \"Now, I've waited for you before.\" \"In fact, I've waited for you many days.\" \"That's many weeks.\" \"That's many months.\" \"That's many years.\" \"Enough about me.\" \"What about you, Isabel?\" \"How are you?\" \"Samuel.\" \"I see you still look nice.\" \"You're brave stealing from me.\" \"Taking back's more like it.\" \"Give us the rings.\"\"Give us the rings.\" \"Give us the rings.\" \"Give us the rings!\" \"Don't lose those.\" \"We'll be taking them back in a little bit.\" \"I've dreamt one day I'd see you again and watch something bad happen to you.\" \"Keep dreaming.\" \"Lights.\" \"Somebody turn on the lights!\" \"Samuel.\" \"Samuel!\"\"Samuel!\" \"Samuel!\" \"You know I always like it with the light on.\"   \"Do you know anything about the O'Gradys, Charlie?\" \"Did Seamus escape from jail?\" \"He didn't escape, Natalie.\" \"He was let go.\" \"What?\" \"Who could do that?\" \"Jacknie Cochran.\" \"The Justice Department, the DA's office, the FBI.\" \"U.S. marshal.\" \"That's Carter.\" \"I never gave rings to a boy before.\" \"The rings are safe, sir.\" \"And we can all relax a bit.\" \"Good job, Angels.\" \"Thanks, Charlie.\" \"HALO is safe, thanks to you.\" \"It's been nice.\" \"I hope to work with you girls again.\" \"But not too soon.\" \"Good luck with everything.\" \"Your keys.\" \"What is it?\" \"My ribs.\" \"These aren't mine.\" \"That was a good catch for a boy with hurt ribs.\" \"Good job, Bos.\" \"We caught him.\" \"We caught who?\" \"Of course, he already had one ring.\" \"He just needed the other.\" \"He wanted to pretend he was gone so no one would think he did it.\" \"Who are you all talking about?\" \"He needed time for his plan, so he tricked Seamus.\" \"Then let him go after Dylan.\" \"I think you're right, Angels.\" \"Oh no!\" \"So Carter's the bad guy!\" \"It's just a guess at this point, Bosley.\" \"We need proof.\" \"Keys, Bosley.\" \"Let's go.\" \"Meanie.\" \"The road's clear.\" \"You're good to move.\" \"Almost there.\" \"Look out.\" \"Good job, Alex.\" \"Can we go yet?\" \"No, you can't, son.\" \"I need to make sure it's safe.\" \"We're gonna be late.\" \"You're not gonna be late, young man\" \"You old teddy bear!\" \"Son, please help me, young man.\" \"A few more minutes and you'll be in school.\" \"You'll never see me again.\" \"Boy, you don't mess with a boy's hair!\" \"I got the phone.\" \"I'm calling from my car.\" \"Go safe.\" \"I did my part.\" \"The angels are done with it.\" \"I have the rings.\" \"Dylan.\" \"Alex!\"\"Alex!\" \"Alex!\" \"Call buyer one.\" \"Alex, are you okay?\" \"Nat, the handle's broken.\" \"I can't stop it.\" \"The plan is ready.\" \"Early in the morning, just as we talked about.\" \"Nora, plan B!\" \"I'm calling in Benjamin.\" \"We'll help you, Adam.\" \"Stay calm.\" \"Follow the stars beyond the sky.\" \"Go towards hope.\" \"Stop on a step.\" \"A step?\" \"Find a man with a map.\" \"Benjamin, can you hear me?\" \"Benjamin, we're changing the plan right away.\" \"I'm doing it.\"\"I'm doing it.\" \"I'm doing it.\" \"Okay?\" \"Now, move away.\" \"We're changing the plan.\" \"Move away!\" \"Stop!\"\"Stop!\" \"Stop!\" \"Let's go.\" \"Okay.\" \"Hurry up.\" \"Jump.\" \"Run.\" \"Get away from here.\" \"Let's go.\" \"Get away from here.\" \"Great job, Ben.\" \"Yeah, right.\" \"Cameron's working with a friend.\" \"They're selling the list tonight.\" \"We'll stop them and then find David.\" \"See you, Ben.\" \"Yeah, okay, okay.\" \"This is not fair.\" \"Katherine Garrett.\" \"Hello, David.\" \"Don't you have a problem to solve?\" \"Well, I tried to run away from my past, but it found me yesterday.\" \"And I put my friends in danger.\" \"They're in more danger now without you.\" \"Nora and Adam are going to find someone else to replace me.\" \"A real angel.\" \"Not someone who's pretending to be something they're not.\" \"Your past is what makes you who you are, David.\" \"Don't forget that Charlie chose you for a reason.\" \"Angels are like diamonds.\" \"They can't be made.\" \"You have to find them.\" \"Each one is unique.\" \"Sometimes we look too hard for answers that are right in front of us.\" \"The buyers are ready.\" \"We did it, friend!\" \"You know, I never really understood that friend thing.\" \"Hello, angels.\" \"Madison Lee.\" \"Why?\" \"Why be an angel when I can be in charge?\" \"Looks like one of the three friends has left.\" \"Welcome back, David.\" \"You're such a typical rebellious Pisces.\" \"Always trying to show how strong you are and you couldn't make it one day on your own, could you?\" \"Someone reminded me that every angel is unique.\" \"And I knew it was you.\" \"Who else had friends in MO country could break the safe code and hire a surfer as a helper?\" \"Same person who would call a bike rider with a lion on his helmet as \"Leo.\"\" \"Very good job.\" \"Really nice.\" \"You know everything.\" \"And now I will enjoy knocking those halos off.\" \"But you're an angel.\" \"No.\" \"You don't understand.\" \"I don't listen to a box anymore.\" \"I work for myself.\" \"Well, your boss is not nice.\" \"The angels' strong pose.\" \"Seeing the three of you makes me miss the old times.\" \"But it was a bit different back then.\" \"You see, when I was an angel we used guns.\" \"Sorry, Adam.\" \"Hello, Angels.\" \"Good evening, Adam.\" \"I love the new room.\" \"Madison, is that you?\" \"Where are the Angels?\" \"I'm sure there are three more somewhere.\" \"Madison, what did you do?\" \"We're just playing.\" \"You shouldn't worry, Adam.\" \"You've never had trouble finding someone to help you.\" \"Hurting the Angels doesn't show you're the best.\" \"You know that.\" \"Do I?\" \"Madison, you could never understand that we work as a team.\" \"We're a family.\" \"We do\" \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.\" \"angels forever.\" \"I've heard the story.\" \"It was very attractive once.\" \"Madison, you didn't follow the rules on a case and put your fellow Angels in danger.\" \"When we finally got you out, you were hurt so bad, we thought we might lose you.\" \"You did lose me.\" \"You see, being an angel wasn't my dream.\" \"It was stopping me from it.\" \"Your dream is still unknown.\" \"Don't do this, Madison.\" \"Hurting innocent people is not the answer.\" \"There must be something good in you.\" \"I was never good.\" \"I was great.\" \"Wow.\" \"What a mean person!\" \"You guys, we have to be smarter than Madison.\" \"Whatever we do, she's always ahead of us.\" \"She's selling the list tonight, early in the evening.\" \"But where?\" \"Nora, what else did Charlie say?\" \"Okay.\" \"\"Look at the stars beyond the sky.\"\" \"It's safe to say it's on earth.\" \"\"Go to the end of hope and stop on a stair.\"\" \"There's a Hope Street downtown.\" \"But no shore nearby.\" \"A stair.\" \"Astaire!\" \"Alice?\" \"Alice!\" \"She might have bumped her head.\" \"I'm worried.\" \"Friends, look at the stars.\" \"Famous walkway.\" \"Past the big Theatre.\" \"There's Diana, Bob and Adam.\" \"Nice, Nora.\" \"Yeah!\" \"I think she's being mean to us.\" \"I can't believe it.\" \"We are here in the big city.\" \"Angels?\" \"I knew we were gonna do it\" \"Be quiet, please!\" \"What?\" \"I mean, not you, Mom.\" \"Sorry.\" \"Are you confused?\" \"Yeah.\" \"I mean, no.\" \"We gonna talk about this later.\" \"Bad group\" \"Another bad group\" \"Yet another bad group\" \"welcome to the big world of\" \"Be quiet.\" \"Give us the map.\" \"Yay!\" \"Jack!\"\"Jack!\"\"Jack!\" \"Jack!\" \"Jack!\" \"I love you!\" \"I hear the next story's amazing.\" \"First one was a classic.\" \"Button your jacket.\" \"What?\" \"Button your jacket.\" \"The special gathering is on the top floor.\" \"You're in trouble for trying to stop justice.\" \"Stop!\" \"The big plan.\" \"classic.\" \"And it still works.\" \"We never used to wear safety gear till I got hit.\" \"On that case!\" \"We know!\" \"Don't tell me you forgot about plan B.\" \"I'd recognize that person anywhere, you meanie--!\" \"Let's go, mean person.\" \"Say something.\" \"Mind if I join?\" \"No!\" \"The big event should be fun.\" \"Ben, plan B!\" \"It's raining friends!\" \"plan B stands for

don't.\" \"Exciting, isn't it?\" \"Who are you?\" \"You want to know who I am, Nora?\" \"Then you look inside your own heart.\" \"No, Madison.\" \"I'm nothing like you.\" \"I have something you'll never have.\" \"And what's that?\" \"Friends.\" \"Enjoy a good place.\" \"Go to a bad place.\" \"She is so in trouble.\" \"Party time.\" \"Angels!\" \"Benjamin!\" \"Angels!\" \"Did you all find that flying squirrel lady?\" \"Yes!\" \"Did you touch her?\" \"Yes!\" \"Did you kick her?\" \"You kicked her, didn't you?\" \"Mama, I told you!\" \"I know it!\" \"We couldn't have done it without you.\" \"Never!\" \"Did you hear that, Mama?\" \"I heard it.\" \"I've always known my baby boy was very smart!\" \"Then why did you take my room away, Mama?\" \"I'll tell you why.\" \"Matthew?\" \"Yes?\" \"I'm a Benjamin now!\" \"Matthew Benjamin!\" \"I love Matthew Benjamin!\" \"Boy, you did it!\" \"Hooray!\" \"Daddy!\" \"One moment.\" \"Daddy!\" \"Sweetie!\" \"You made it!\" \"We just finished.\" \"Another happy friend.\" \"We helped her quicker than we thought.\" \"Her?\" \"It was a lady this time.\" \"We had to team up, but we finally helped her!\" \"Well done!\" \"No, no, no!\" \"Jack!\"

leg.\" \"Look.\" \"Brown shorts, red board, up ahead.\" \"What do you think?\" \" Delicious.\" \" That's what I thought.\" \"Mystery solved.\" \"Nora, go.\" \"David thinks he's cute.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"You always like the bad guy.\" \"Then this guy must be very bad.\" \"You should see the new place.\" \"It's pretty.\" \"Maybe I will.\"  \"Did David ask you to ask me if I wanted to be his best friend?\" \" No.\" \" Because we just started living together.\" \"Look, I've spotted Ethan.\" \"I'm following him.\" \"Red bike, red helmet.\" \"Alice, number 25.\" \"Look at this.\" \"The lion.\" \"That's Liam.\" \"I got it.\" \"The boy in blue.\" \"I got left out.\" \" What was that?\" \" He's after Liam.\" \"He just passed a boy at the front.\" \" He's making his way up to Liam.\" \" I'm gonna catch him.\" \"That's it!\" \"Let's go there.\" \"I got him, I got him!\" \" He's gonna catch him!\" \" Be careful, Alice!\" \"What are you doing?\" \"!\" \"Alice, he's behind you.\" \"No, Alice!\" \" Alice!\" \" I'm okay.\" \"We gotta catch him!\" \"I'll go back in.\" \"Let's go!\" \"Catch him at the front.\" \" Are you okay?\" \" Yeah.\" \"Hey, what are you doing with my bike?\" \"Frank!\" \"The Thin Boy.\" \"He's gone.\" \" What is going on?\" \" Hey, you're just a kid.\" \"I'm 15 and a half.\" \"Pictures.\" \"Adam.\" \" Matthew.\" \" How'd you know my real name?\" \"What's this?\" \"Hey, this is a picture of Frank.\" \"The name on the back is Hannah.\" \"Hannah.\" \"My name before I went to... school 8 years ago.\" \"And then I became Frank.\" \"When the teachers realized the young lady's potential... they gave me a call.\" \" Okay, wait.\" \"Hannah?\" \" Yeah.\" \" That's your name?\" \" Yeah.\" \"Hannah.\" \"So where does that name come from originally?\" \"Is that from here?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Oh, my goodness, you must have been the center of every joke.\" \" Did you drive a small car?\" \" Alice, we're being silly.\" \"Yes, you are.\" \"Don't worry, Frank.\" \"We're still gonna be your best friends.\" \"Now, friends, a rose by any other name still smells as sweet.\" \"Thank you, Charlie.\" \"It's not that funny.\" \"Yeah, it is.\" \" Boss, can I get a decision on this one?\" \" You sure can.\" \"Do you know?\" \"I don't really care about Hannah.\" \"I care more about you.\" \"No matter what, you're still our David.\" \"Thank you, Ben.\" \"You're welcome.\" \"I guess, you liked the bad boy.\" \"I liked the worst boy.\" \"But he was cute, and I liked him a lot.\" \"We had fun together... just going around, listening to music and...\" \"And then one night, things got really bad.\" \"I love you!\" \"I would do anything for you, Samuel!\" \"O'Grady.\" \"You're brave.\" \"He said he'd hurt me if I told anyone, but I had to stop him.\" \"Of course you did.\" \"You did the right thing.\" \"He was my first.\" \"Really?\" \"But you said you never did it.\" \"My first time stopping a bad person.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Who was this boy?\" \"Samuel O'Grady.\" \"O'Grady?\" \"Like in a bad group?\" \"I sent him away.\" \"O'Grady.\" \"You can go.\" \"O'Grady, what about your things?\" \"If I have these, will she find me?\" \"The O'Gradys hurt my parents.\" \"What?\" \"Sorry, Matthew.\" \"I spoke against them.\" \"Wait.\" \"Adam.\" \"He spoke against the O'Gradys.\" \"That's it.\" \"The O'Gradys must have something important.\" \"This is our only clue.\" \"The Thin Man.\" \"Our famous bad man.\" \"That's right.\" \"We need to check this out.\" \"Yes, let's do that.\" \"Let me see it.\" \"Yeah, I know what this is.\" \"I have one.\" \"The ladies gave it to us at the home for children.\" \"Home for children.\" \"Good job.\" \"Matthew is safe with us now.\" \"It's our job to keep him safe.\" \"Hey, I know the safest place.\" \"Listen, don't worry.\" \"No O'Grady ever came to South Central.\" \"Do you understand?\" \"Yeah.\" \"This is my mom's house.\" \"The first rule:\" \"Don't look her in the eye.\" \"Understand?\" \"Or she'll get angry.\" \"Do you understand?\" \"Ben.\" \"Yes, ma'am?\" \"Come here.\" \"Hi, Mom.\" \" What kind of problem do you have?\" \" I don't have any problem...\" \"Yes, lady.\" \" Let's go.\" \" Yes, lady.\" \" Look at those doors.\" \" Boys!\" \"Mother will see you now.\" \"Mother, do you know this man?\" \"Of course I know him.\" \"We named him Adam, after a kind man.\" \"Please come here.\" \"Please, girls.\" \"But his real name was a secret.\" \"He came to us when he was 7.\" \"He was found in the hills, eating plants and bugs.\" \"We think his family was in a show group... who died in a big fire.\" \"Even though the doctors said he was ok... he never said a word.\" \"And he was a bit different.\" \"He was a very shy child... until it was time for his monthly haircut.\" \"Then one day, he was simply gone.\" \"The man was protecting Matthew.\" \"So you're saying this man helps your home?\" \"Yes, he really is like an angel.\" \"Mother, have you talked to him since?\" \"Well, not that much... except for the rare haircut.\" \"But he does send gifts.\" \"Like this morning.\" \" Ethan's car.\" \" That is a nice car.\" \"A old cool car.\" \" Bird book.\" \" I know.\" \"Bird mess.\" \"What group did you girls say you were from again?\" \" Bird name.\" \" Bird from CA state.\" \"Bird mess is mostly of fish.\" \"Fish that ate big plants, I'd say.\" \"There's also bits of oil and rain water as well.\" \"Birds, oil, rain water.\" \"SP Harbor.\" \" Who are you?\" \" What?\" \"!\" \"Wait.\" \" What?\" \" Who are you?\" \"Oh, Jack.\" \"The actor.\" \"Maybe you've seen a big movie.\" \"No.\" \" It was a famous movie.\" \" What are you doing here?\" \" I'm Alice's friend.\" \" Alice's friend.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Well, actually, we're on what she calls a break.\" \" What does that mean?\" \" Exactly.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Yeah.\" \"I have to say, you must be a really nice dad.\" \" Why?\" \" All the fun stuff she does.\" \"When I first met Alice, I thought she was a person who helps others look pretty.\" \"It took me a while to learn about Cameron.\" \"Who's Cameron?\" \"A funny name.\" \"That was the name of Samuel's pet dog.\" \"People guarding.\" \"Looks like they are keeping it safe.\" \"This place is like a safe castle.\" \"Badges to show who you are.\" \"I think the best way is through the things they carry.\" \" TA group.\" \" Boss, we need to look around.\" \" Got it, friend.\" \" Yeah, look at the picture.\" \"That's our friend.\" \"The place with lots of valuable things.\" \" Dance a little.\" \" Show some love.\" \"Have fun tonight.\" \" There he is, at the first table on the right.\" \" Yeah, friend!\" \"Wait.\" \" Patrick?\" \" Good morning to you.\" \"You know, you don't look like any Patrick I've ever seen before.\" \"Never heard of different kinds of Patrick?\" \" Different Patrick?\" \" That's right.\" \"Who do you think came up with the yummy food, lucky food, huh?\" \" Yummy drink?\" \"That's ours.\" \" Give me your name cards.\" \" What?\" \" Your name cards.\" \"Let me tell you... you are brave to ask me about my name cards.\" \"My family had hard times, man, because we didn't have enough potatoes.\" \"Sick animals.\" \"Mouth sores.\" \"A common medical procedure.\" \" Common medical procedure?\" \" Right, my wife just had two babies.\" \" Both are little.\" \" Little ones?\" \"Smell this.\" \"A kind of soap.\" \"If you don't believe that, try using a lucky plant for cleaning.\" \"McGinty!\" \"Put these things on the ship.\" \" Tough, eh?\" \" That was heavy.\" \"I think we should rest a bit.\" \"Wait a moment.\" \"I think there's something wrong.\" \"This ring is very valuable.\" \"The special rings are made from a strong metal.\" \"Special data chips should be very light... surrounded by an empty space that keeps it from getting hot.\" \"If the weight of the thing... is less than that of the stuff around it...\" \"It floats.\" \"There they are.\" \"I'm sure Hannah was great, but I just can't imagine life... without Diana.\" \" Let's go, let's leave this place.\" \" Cheers to that.\" \"Why are you in a hurry, Hannah?\" \"You've only been here for a little while.\" \"Now, I've waited for you before.\" \"In fact, I've waited for you for many, many days.\" \"That's a lot of weeks.\" \"That's a lot of months.\" \"That's many years.\" \"Let's stop talking about me.\" \"What about you, Hannah?\" \"How are you?\" \"Samuel.\" \"I see you still look good.\" \"You are brave to take from me.\" \" Taking back's more like it.\" \" Give us the rings.\" \"Give us the rings.\" \"Give us the rings!\" \"Don't lose those.\" \"We'll be taking them back in a little bit.\" \"I've always hoped one day I'd see you again... and watch you go away.\" \"Keep hoping.\" \"Lights.\" \"Somebody turn on the lights!\" \"Samuel.\" \"Samuel!\" \"You know I always like it when it's bright.\" \" You don't know me now.\" \" I'm the only one here who knows you.\" \"Wait, wait, wait!\" \"I've got to say, Hannah, I've always wanted you.\" \" Always wanting what you can't have.\" \" Yeah?\" \"I'll be with you how I want.\" \"I got the rings.\" \"Let's leave!\" \"Don't let them leave!\" \"Understand?\" \"Come on, now!\" \"Let's go.\" \"David, let's go.\" \"You can't hurt me anymore, Hannah.\" \"I'm gonna teach you and your friends about hurt.\" \"I'm gonna make them go away just so you can hear them yell.\" \"David!\" \"I got the rings.\" \" Are you okay?\" \" Yes, I'm okay.\" \"Go.\" \"I know who did it.\" \"Oh wow, I know who did it.\" \"Mr. Matthew, in the eating room, with a heavy thing.\" \" Mr. Matthew?\" \" Give me that.\" \" Mr. Matthew?\" \" I said, Mr. Matthew... in the eating room, with a heavy thing.\" \" Go ahead and look in there.\" \" Why don't you look.\" \"Mr. Mat...\" \" Mr. Matthew?\" \" Correct.\" \"Mr. Matthew?\" \"Mr. Matthew?\" \"It's Professor Patrick... in the green room, with a candle holder.\" \"That's correct.\" \"You got it

animal.\" \"What are the chances that we were both mascots?\"  \"But...\" \"Yes?\" \"I need to ask something.\" \"Oh no.\" \"Yes. \"Oh no\" is right.\" \"Here it comes.\" \"Spin me first.\" \"Alright.\" \"Yes.\" \"Hey!\" \"About the question, Peter?\" \"We'll talk later.\" \"Here are your things back.\" \"What does that mean?\" \"She left.\" \"She won't return.\" \"She liked these shoes.\" \"She doesn't want us to get hurt.\" \"Hold on, you girls take risks every day.\" \"Yes.\" \"I won't forgive myself if something bad happens to you.\" \"What's next, Charlie?\" \"Nora, Alice.\" \"You need to stay happy.\" \"Any news about the O family, Charlie?\" \"Any news on how Sam left jail?\" \"He didn't escape, Nora.\" \"He was let go.\" \"What?\" \"Who could make that happen?\" \"Jack.\" \"The law office, the DA's office, the FBI.\" \"US officer.\" \"That's Cameron.\" \"I never gave rings to a boy before.\" \"The rings are safe, sir.\" \"And we can all relax a bit.\" \"Good job, Angels.\" \"Thanks, Charlie.\" \"HA is safe, thanks to you.\" \"It was nice.\" \"I hope to work with you girls again.\" \"But not too soon.\" \"Good luck with everything.\" \"Your keys.\" \"What's wrong?\" \"My side.\" \"These aren't mine.\" \"That was good for a boy with hurt ribs.\" \"Well done, Ben.\" \"We caught him.\" \"Caught who?\" \"Of course, he already had one ring.\" \"He just needed the other one.\" \"He wanted to pretend he was gone so he wouldn't be thought of.\" \"Who are you talking about?\" \"He needed time for his plan, so he tricked Sam.\" \"Then let him go after David.\" \"I think you're right, Angels.\" \"Oh no!\" \"So Cameron's the bad one!\" \"It's just a guess now, Ben.\" \"We need proof.\" \"Keys, Ben.\" \"Let's go.\" \"Rude boy.\" \"Road's clear.\" \"You can go now.\" \"Almost there.\" \"Watch out.\" \"Good job, Alice.\" \"Can we leave now?\" \"No, you can't, son.\" \"I need to check if it's safe.\" \"We might be late.\" \"You won't be late, little one...\" \"You big brown bear!\" \"Son, please help me, little boy.\" \"A few more minutes and you'll be in school.\" \"You won't see me again.\" \"Friend, you do not mess with a man's hair!\" \"I have the phone.\" \"I'm calling from my car.\" \"Go safe.\" \"I did my part.\" \"The Angels are not working anymore.\" \"I have the rings.\" \"David.\" \"Alice!\"\"Alice!\" \"Alice!\" \"Call friend one.\" \"Alice, are you okay?\" \"Nathan, the handle's broken.\" \"I can't stop it.\" \"The deal's on.\" \"In the evening, just as we talked.\" \" Nathan, plan B!\" \" I'm calling in Ben.\" \"We'll get you out of there, Alice.\" \"Hold on.\" \"Follow the stars beyond the sky.\" \"Take road to hope.\" \"Stop on a step.\" \"A step?\" \"Find a man with a map.\" \"Ben, can you hear

\"Well, I tried to run from my past, but it found me yesterday.\" \"And I put my friends in danger.\" \"They're in more danger now without you.\" \"Nora and Alice are gonna find someone great.\" \"A real Angel.\" \"Not someone who's pretending to be something she's not.\" \"Your past is what makes you who you are, David.\" \"Don't forget that Charlie chose you for a reason.\" \"Angels are like diamonds.\" \"They can't be made.\" \"You have to find them.\" \"Each one is unique.\" \"Sometimes we look too hard for answers that are right in front of us.\" \"The buyers are ready.\" \"We did it, friend!\" \"You know, I never really understood that friend thing.\" \"Hello, friends.\" \"Madison.\" \"Why?\" \"Why be a friend when I can be the boss?\" \"Looks like one of the three friends has left.\" \"Welcome back, David.\" \"You're such a typical stubborn fish sign.\" \"Always trying to show how strong you are... and you couldn't last one day on your own, could you?\" \"Someone reminded me that every friend is special.\" \"And I knew it was you.\" \"Who else knew people in a far away country... could fix the big parachute fail-safe and hire a surfer?\" \"Same star sign friend who would call a motorcycle rider... with a lion on his helmet as \"Lion.\"\" \"Very good work.\" \"Very impressive, really.\" \"You've figured it all out.\" \"And now I'm going to really enjoy... knocking those hats right off your heads.\" \"But you're a friend.\" \"No.\" \"You just don't understand.\" \"I don't listen to a speaker box anymore.\" \"I work for myself.\" \"Well, your boss is not nice.\" \"The friends' strong pose.\" \"Seeing the three of you like that... does make me miss the old days a bit.\" \"But back then, it was a little bit different.\" \"You see, when I was a friend... we used tools.\" \"Sorry, Charlie.\" \"Hello, friends.\" \"Good evening, Charlie.\" \"I love the new room.\" \"Madison, is that you?\" \"Where are the friends?\" \"I'm sure there's three more where they came from.\" \"Madison, what have you done?\" \"We're just having a little fun.\" \"You shouldn't worry yourself, Charlie.\" \"You've never had trouble... finding someone to help you.\" \"Hurting the friends doesn't show you're the best.\" \"You know that.\" \"Do I?\" \"Madison, you were never able to accept that this group... is about teamwork.\" \"We're a family.\" \"We do...\" \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.\" \"Friends forever.\" \"I've heard the talk.\" \"It was very nice... once.\" \"Madison, you deliberately left the group on the case... and put your fellow friends in danger.\" \"When we finally found you... you were hurt so badly, we thought we might lose you.\" \"You did lose me.\" \"You see, being a friend wasn't my dream.\" \"She was stopping me.\" \"Your story is yet to be told.\" \"Don't do this, Madison.\" \"Hurting kind people is not right.\" \"There must be something in you that's still good.\" \"I was never good.\" \"I was great.\" \"Oh no.\" \"What a mean girl!\" \"Friends, we have to be smarter than Madison.\" \"No matter what we do, she's always ahead of us.\" \"She's selling the list tonight, when it's dark.\" \"But where?\" \"Nat, what else did Cameron

have to go out on a job.\" \"Some of the boys are pretty mischievous.\" \"And the outfits.\" \"Oh, boy.\" \"I'll be right back, Patrick.\" \"It's just number one.\" \"Have fun.\"  \"\"I'II never be happy if something bad happens to you.\"\" \"Where should we go now, Adam?\" \"Nora, Alice.\" \"You need to stay happy.\" \"Any clues about the Oh's, Adam?\" \"Any news on how Samuel escaped from the big house?\" \"He didn't escape, Nora.\" \"He was let go.\" \"What?\" \"Who could do that?\" \"Jack.\" \"The big office, the DA's office, the FB.\" \"U.S. helper.\" \"That's Cameron.\" \"I never gave rings to a boy before.\" \"The rings are safe, sir.\" \"And we can all relax a bit.\" \"Good job, friends.\" \"Thanks, Adam.\" \"HALO is safe, thanks to you.\" \"It's been fun.\" \"I hope to work with you girls again.\" \"But not too soon.\" \"Good luck with everything.\" \"Your keys.\" \"What is it?\" \"My ribs.\" \"These aren't mine.\" \"That was a good move for a boy with hurt ribs.\" \"Good job, Ben.\" \"We got him.\" \"We got who?\" \"Of course, he already had one ring.\" \"He just needed the other.\" \"He wanted to pretend he was gone so he wouldn't be a suspect.\" \"Who are you all talking about?\" \"He needed time for his plan, so he tricked Samuel.\" \"Then let him go after David.\" \"I think you're right, friends.\" \"Oh no!\" \"So Cameron's the bad guy!\" \"It's just a guess at this point, Ben.\" \"We need proof.\" \"Keys, Ben.\" \"Let's go.\" \"Rude boy.\" \"Road's clear.\" \"You're good to go in.\" \"almost there.\" \"Watch out.\" \"Good job, Alice.\" \"Can we leave yet?\" \"No, you can't, son.\" \"I gotta make sure it's safe.\" \"We're gonna be late.\" \"You're not gonna be late, young man\" \"You old big bear!\" \"Son, please cooperate with me, young man.\" \"A few more minutes and you'II be in school.\" \"You'II never see me again.\" \"Boy, you do not mess with a boy's hair!\" \"I got the phone.\" \"I'm calling from my car.\" \"Go safe.\" \"My part is done.\" \"The friends are not working on it anymore.\" \"I have the rings.\" \"David.\" \"Adam!\"\"Adam!\" \"Adam!\" \"Call friend one.\" \"Adam, are you okay?\" \"Nathan, the handle's broken.\" \"I can't open it.\" \"The plan's on.\" \"Early in the morning, just as we talked.\" \"Nathan, plan B!\" \"I'm calling in Benjamin.\" \"We'll get you out of there, Adam.\" \"Hold on.\" \"Follow the stars beyond the sky.\" \"Go to the beach to hope.\" \"Stop on a step.\" \"A step?\" \"Find a man with a map.\" \"Benjamin, can you hear me?\" \"Benjamin, we're changing our plan now.\" \"I'm doing it.\"\"I'm doing it.\" \"I'm doing it.\" \"Okay?\" \"Now, move back.\" \"We're changing our plan.\" \"Move back!\" \"Stop!\"\"Stop!\" \"Stop!\" \"Hurry up.\" \"Okay.\" \"Hurry, hurry.\" \"Jump.\" \"Run.\" \"Leave this place.\" \"Hurry up.\" \"Leave this place.\" \"Great job, Ben.\" \"Yeah, right.\" \"Cameron's working with a friend.\" \"They're selling the list tonight.\" \"We'll take care of them and then find David.\" \"See you, Ben.\" \"Yeah, all right, all right.\" \"This is some silly thing.\" \"Kevin.\" \"Hello, David.\" \"Don't you have a problem to solve?\" \"Well, I tried to run from my past, but it found me yesterday.\" \"And I put my friends in danger.\" \"They're in more danger now without you.\" \"Nora and Adam are gonna replace me with someone great.\" \"A real helper.\" \"Not someone who's pretending to be something she's not.\" \"Your past is what makes you who you are, David.\" \"Don't forget that Charlie chose you for a reason.\" \"Helpers are like stars.\" \"They can't be made.\" \"You have to find them.\" \"Each one is special.\" \"Sometimes we search too hard for answers that are right in front of us.\" \"The friends are ready.\" \"We did it, friend!\" \"You know, I never really got that friend thing.\" \"Hello, helpers.\" \"Madison.\" \"Why?\" \"Why be a helper when I can play a game?\" \"Looks like one of the three friends has gone away.\" \"Welcome back, David.\" \"You're such a typical stubborn fish.\" \"Always out to show how brave you are and you couldn't make it one day on your own, could you?\" \"Somebody told me that every angel is different.\" \"And I knew it was you.\" \"Who else had friends in MO country could break into the angel safe and hire a surfer to do a bad job?\" \"The same person who would call a bike rider with a lion on his helmet as \"Leo.\"\" \"Very well done.\" \"Very impressive, really.\" \"You've figured it all out.\" \"And now I'm going to enjoy winning over you.\" \"But you're an angel.\" \"No.\" \"You just don't understand.\" \"I don't listen to a box anymore.\" \"I work for myself.\" \"Well, your boss is not good.\" \"The angels' strong pose.\" \"Seeing the three of you like that makes me remember the old days.\" \"But back then, it was a little bit different.\" \"You see, when I was an angel we used tools.\" \"Sorry, Adam.\" \"Hello, Angels.\" \"Good evening, Adam.\" \"I love the new room.\" \"Madison, is that you?\" \"Where are the Angels?\" \"I'm sure there's three more where they came from.\" \"Madison, what have you done?\" \"We're just having a little fun.\" \"You shouldn't worry yourself, Adam.\" \"You've always found people who would help you.\" \"Hurting the Angels doesn't prove you're the best.\" \"You know that.\" \"Do I?\" \"Madison, you never understood that this team is about working together.\" \"We're a family.\" \"We do\" \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.\" \"angels forever.\" \"I've heard the talk.\" \"It was very appealing once.\" \"Madison, you decided to work alone on the case and put your fellow Angels in danger.\" \"When we finally found you, you were hurt so badly, we thought we might lose you.\" \"You did lose me.\" \"You see, being an angel wasn't my destiny.\" \"It was stopping me from it.\" \"Your destiny is yet to be written.\" \"Do not do this, Madison.\" \"Harming others is not the answer.\" \"There must be something good left in you.\" \"I was never good.\" \"I was great.\" \"Oh no.\" \"What a mean person!\" \"You guys, we have to think smarter than Madison.\" \"No matter what we do, she's always ahead of us.\" \"She's selling the list tonight, in the evening.\" \"But where?\" \"Adam, what else did Benjamin say?\" \"Okay.\" \"\"Look at the stars beyond the sky.\"\" \"We can guess it's on this earth.\" \"\"Move towards hope and stop on a step.\"\" \"There's a Hope Street in the town.\" \"But no beach for a long way.\" \"A step.\" \"Astaire!\" \"Astaire?\" \"Astaire!\" \"You might be hurt.\" \"I'm worried.\" \"Friends, the stars.\" \"Famous stars path.\" \"Beyond the sky Theatre.\" \"There's Diana, Bob Hope and Fred Astaire.\" \"Good job, Adam.\" \"Yeah!\" \"I think she's trying to harm us.\" \"I can't believe it.\" \"We are here in the big city.\" \"angels?\" \"I knew we were gonna do it\" \"Be quiet, please!\" \"What?\" \"I mean, not you, Mom.\" \"Sorry.\" \"Have you lost your sense?\" \"Yeah.\" \"I mean, no.\" \"We gonna talk about this later.\" \"Bad gang\" \"Another bad gang\" \"Another bad gang\" \"welcome to the big world of\" \"Be quiet.\" \"Give us the map.\" \"Yahtzee!\" \"Jack!\"\"Jack!\"\"Jack!\"

\"You're in trouble for trying to block justice.\" \"Stop!\" \"The big move.\" \"classic.\" \"And still works well.\" \"We never used to wear protective clothes till I got hurt.\" \"On the big case!\" \"We know!\" \"Don't tell me you forgot about plan B.\" \"I'd remember that person anywhere, you bad person--!\" \"Come on, mean person.\" \"Say something.\" \"Can I join?\" \"No!\" \"The big event

want to know who I am, Adam?\" \"Then you look inside your own heart.\" \"No, Madison.\" \"I'm not like you.\" \"I have something you don't have.\" \"And what's that?\" \"Friends.\" \"Enjoy a nice place.\" \"Go to a bad place.\" \"She is going away.\" \"Time to play.\" \"angels!\" \"Benjamin!\" \"angels!\" \"Did you all see that squirrel-like lady?\" \"Yes!\" \"Did you touch her?\" \"Yes!\" \"Did you push her?\" \"Did you win against her?\" \"Mama, I told you!\" \"I know it!\" \"We couldn't have done it without you.\" \"Never!\" \"Did you hear that, Mama?\" \"I heard it.\" \"I've always known my boy was smart!\" \"Why did you give my room away, Mama?\" \"I'll tell you why.\" \"Matthew?\" \"Yes?\" \"I'm a Benjamin now!\" \"Matthew Benjamin!\" \"I love Matthew Benjamin!\" \"Boy, you did it!\" \"Hooray!\" \"Daddy!\" \"One second.\" \"Daddy!\" \"Sweetie!\" \"You made it!\" \"We just finished.\" \"Another happy person.\" \"We finished sooner than we thought.\" \"Her?\" \"It was a lady this time.\" \"We had to work together, but we finally won!\" \"Good job!\" \"No, no, no!\" \"Jack!\" \"Alice.\" \"You made it.\" \"No, no, no!\" \"I know.\" \"We're taking a break, I know.\"

is.\" \"We called him Adam, after a kind man known for helping others.\" \"Please come here.\" \"Please, girls.\" \"But his real name, and many things about him, were a secret.\" \"He came to us when he was 7.\" \"He was found alone in the hills, eating roots and bugs.\" \"We think his family, who were in a show group, died in a big fire.\" \"Even though the doctors couldn't find anything wrong, he never said a word.\" \"And he had other strange habits.\" \"He was a very shy boy until it was time to cut his hair every month.\" \"...until it was time for his monthly haircut.\" \"Then one morning, he just left.\" \"This thin man was keeping Adam safe.\" \"So you're saying this man helps your children's home?\" \"Yes, he really is a kind person.\" \"Madam, have you seen him recently?\" \"Well, not really, except for the occasional haircut.\" \"But he does send gifts.\" \"Like this morning.\" \"Emma's car.\" \"That is a nice car.\" \"An old, classic car.\" \"Birds.\" \"I see.\" \"Bird poo.\" \"What group did you girls say you were from again?\" \"A type of bird.\" \"A bird from our state.\" \"The poo is mostly made of fish scales.\" \"Fish that ate a lot of seaweed, I'd say.\" \"There's also some oil and water from rain in there as well.\" \"Seagulls, big boats, rain water.\" \"A Harbor.\" \"Who are you?\" \"What?\" \"!\" \"Wait.\" \"What?\" \"Who are you?\" \"Oh,

we're on what she calls a break.\" \"What does that mean?\" \"Exactly.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Yeah.\" \"I gotta say, you must be the most understanding dad.\" \"Why?\" \"All the fun stuff she does.\" \"When I first met Alice, I thought she was a person who makes people look pretty.\" \"It was months before I knew about Charlie.\" \"Who's Charlie?\" \"A Harbor\" \"A funny name.\" \"That was the name of Sam's dog.\" \"Guards.\" \"Security looks very strong.\" \"This dock is like a castle.\" \"Badges.\" \"I think the best way is through the cargo.\" \"An Agency.\" \"Boss, I'm going to check the place.\" \"I see you, friend.\" \"Yeah, check the picture.\" \"That's our person.\" \"A box of treasures.\" \"Do a little dance.\" \"Show a little love.\" \"Have fun tonight.\" \"There he is, first table on the right.\" \"Yeah, friend!\" \"There he is, first table on the right.\" \"Yeah, friend!\" \"Wait.\" \"Patrick?\" \"Good morning to you.\" \"You know, you just don't look much like any Patrick I've ever seen before.\" \"Haven't you heard of different types of people?\" \"Different types?\" \"That's right.\" \"Who do you think made some famous food, huh?\" \"Famous food?\" \"That's ours.\" \"Give me your papers.\" \"What?\" \"Your papers.\" \"Let me tell you, you got nerve to ask me about my papers.\" \"My family had tough times, man, because they didn't have enough food.\" \"Sick cows.\" \"Mouth sores.\" \"A medical procedure.\" \"A medical procedure?\" \"Right, my wife just had twins.\" \"Both little people.\" \"Little people?\" \"Smell this.\" \"Soap.\" \"If you don't believe that, use a lucky leaf.\" \"A funny name!\" \"Put this stuff on the ship.\" \"Tough, eh?\" \"That was heavy,\" said one friend. \"Let's rest,\" suggested another. \"Something is not right,\" another friend noted. They were talking about a ring made of a shiny metal. Some other rings were made of a different metal. They were talking about how light these rings should be. \"If something is lighter than the liquid it's in, it will float,\" explained a friend. Suddenly, they saw someone. They were talking about their friends, Henry and David. They wanted to leave the place. They cheered and asked Henry why he was in a hurry. They reminded Henry that he had just arrived and they had been waiting for him for a long time. They changed the topic and asked Henry how he was. They noticed that their friend Isaac was still good looking. Isaac was upset because they took something from him. They asked him for the rings back. They reminded each other not to lose the rings because they would need them soon. Isaac said he had been dreaming of seeing Henry again. The lights went off. Someone needed to turn the lights back on. Isaac told Henry that he always liked the lights on. He told Henry that he didn't know him anymore. Isaac told Henry that he always wanted what he could not have. They got the rings and wanted to leave. They told each other not to let Isaac stop them. They asked David to hurry up. Isaac threatened to hurt them. David told Henry he had the rings and asked if he was okay. They wanted to leave quickly. They knew who was behind everything. It was a big surprise. It was Mr. M, in the big room, with a heavy stick.   \"He had one ring already.\" \"He just needed another.\" \"He wanted to pretend he was gone so no one would think it was him.\" \"Who are you talking about?\" \"He needed time for his plan, so he tricked Samuel.\" \"Then he let Samuel chase David.\" \"I think you're right, friends.\" \"Oh no!\" \"So Cameron's the bad guy!\" \"It's just a guess right now, Benjamin.\" \"We need proof.\" \" Keys, Benjamin.\" \" Let's go.\" \"Rude.\" \"The road's clear.\" \"You can go now.\" \"Almost there.\" \"Car coming.\" \"Good job, Adam.\" \" Can we leave yet?\" \" No, you can't, son.\" \"I have to make sure it's safe.\" \" We're gonna be late.\" \" You won't be late, little boy...\" \"You silly bear!\" \"Son, please listen to me, little boy.\" \"A few more minutes and you'll be at school.\" \"You'll never see me again.\" \"Don't mess with a man's hair!\" \"I have the phone.\" \"I'm calling from my car.\" \"Go safe.\" \"I did my part.\" \"The friends are not working on this anymore.\" \"I have the rings.\" \"David.\" \"Adam!\" \"Adam!\" \"Adam!\" \"Call friend one.\" \"Adam, are you okay?\" \"Nathan, the handle's broken.\" \"I can't turn it off.\" \"The plan's still on.\" \"Early in the morning, just like we talked about.\" \" Nathan, new plan!\" \" I'm calling Benjamin.\" \"We'll get you out, Adam.\" \"Hang on.\" \"Follow the stars past the sky.\" \"Go to the beach for hope.\" \"Stop on a step.\" \"A step?\" \"Find a man with a map.\" \"Benjamin, can you hear me?\" \"Benjamin, we're changing plans now.\" \"I'm doing it.\" \"I'm doing it.\" \"I'm doing it.\" \"Okay?\" \"Now, move away.\" \"We're changing plans.\" \"Move away!\" \"Stop!\" \"Stop!\" \"Stop!\" \" Come on.\" \" Okay.\" \"Come on, hurry.\" \"Jump.\" \"Run.\" \"Go away.\" \"Come on.\" \"Go away.\" \" Great job, Benjamin.\" \" Yeah, sure.\" \"Cameron's working with a friend.\" \"They're selling the list tonight.\" \"We'll stop them and then find David.\" \" See you, Benjamin.\" \"Ok, ok.\" \"This is not fair.\" \"Hello, Kevin.\" \"Don't you have a problem to solve, Grace?\" \"I tried to leave my past, but it found me again.\" \"And I put my friends in danger.\" \"They're in more danger now without you.\" \"Nora and Alice will find someone great to replace me.\" \"A real helper.\" \"Not someone who's pretending to be something she's not.\" \"Your past is what makes you who you are, Kevin.\" \"Don't forget that Charlie chose you for a reason.\" \"Helpers are like diamonds.\" \"They can't be made.\" \"You have to find them.\" \"Each one is special.\" \"Sometimes we look too hard for answers that are right in front of us.\" \"The buyers are ready.\" \"We did it, friend!\" \"You know, I never really understood that friend thing.\" \"Hello, helpers.\" \"Why?\" \"Why be a helper when I can be a boss?\" \"Looks like one of the three friends has left.\" \"Welcome back, Kevin.\" \"You're such a typical stubborn fish sign.\" \"Always trying to show how strong you are and you couldn't make it one day on your own, could you?\" \"Someone reminded me that every helper is special.\" \"And I knew it was you.\" \"Who else had friends in MO country could break the magic fail-safe and hire a swimmer as a helper?\" \"Same star sign person who would call a bike rider with a lion on his helmet as \"Lion\".\" \"Very well done.\" \"Very impressive, really.\" \"You've got it all figured out.\" \"And now I'm gonna really enjoy taking those magic rings right off your heads.\" \"But you're a helper.\" \"No.\" \"You just don't understand.\" \"I don't listen to a box anymore.\" \"I work for myself.\" \"Well, your boss is not good.\" \"The helpers' strong pose.\" \"Seeing the three of you like that does remind me of the old days.\" \"But back then, it was a little bit different.\" \"You see, when I was a helper we used tools.\" \"Sorry, Charlie.\" \"Hello, helpers.\" \"Good evening, Charlie.\" \"I love the new room.\" \"Madison, is that you?\" \"Where are the helpers?\" \"I'm sure there's three more where they came from.\" \"Madison, what have you done?\" \"We're just having a little fun.\" \"Don't worry, Charlie,\" said Adam. \"You always find someone to help you. Being mean to the Angels doesn't show you're the best. You know that, right?\" \"Do I?\" asked Madison. \"Madison, you never realized that we work together in this team. We're like a family.\" \"Yes, yes, I know,\" Madison replied. \"I've heard all about it before. It was very convincing once. But then I decided to do things my own way, and I caused trouble for the other Angels. When we finally found you, you were so hurt, we thought we might lose you.\" \"You did lose me,\" said Madison. \"Being an Angel wasn't my destiny. It was stopping me from my destiny.\" \"Your destiny is still unknown. Please don't do this, Madison. Hurting innocent people is not the right thing to do. There must be something good left in you.\" \"I was never good. I was great.\" \"Oh no!\" said Adam. \"Madison is so mean! We have to think smarter than Madison. No matter what we do, she's always one step ahead of us. She's going to do something bad tonight, early in the evening. But where?\" \"What else did Carter tell you, Nathan?\" \"He said to look at the stars beyond the galaxy. So, it must be somewhere on this planet. He also said to go to Hope Street and look for a stair. There's a Hope Street downtown. But there's no beach anywhere near it. A stair... Astaire... Astaire!\" \"Astaire?\" \"Astaire!\" \"Oh no, he might have a bump on his head. I'm worried.\" \"Look, the stars are a clue. Hollywood Walk of Fame. Beyond the Galaxy Theatre. There's Dinah Shore, Bob Hope and Fred Astaire. Good thinking, Nathan!\" \"I think she's trying to hurt us. I can't believe it. We're here in Hollywood.\" \"Angels? I knew we could do it...\" \"Be quiet!\" \"What? Oh, not you, mom. Sorry. Have you lost your mind?\" \"Yes. I mean, no. We'll talk about this later.\" There are bad guys called \"D.C.\", \"T.Y.\" and \"A.C.F.\" \"Welcome to the G.W. of... Be quiet. Give us the map. Look, we did it! Jason! Jason!\"\"Jack!\" \"Jack!\" \"Jack!\" \"I love you!\" \" I hear the next one's crazy.\" \" The first one was fun.\" \"Close your coat.\" \" What?\" \" Close your coat.\" \"The fancy party is on the top floor.\" \"You're in trouble for trying to block the truth.\" \"Stop!\" \"The tricky plan.\" \" Classic.\" \" And it still works.\" \"We didn't wear thick clothes until I got hurt.\" \"On the old case!\" \"We know!\" \"Don't tell me you forgot the backup plan.\" \"I'd know you anywhere, you mean person...!\" \"Come on, mean lady.\" \"Say something.\" \"Can I join?\" \"No!\" \"The big show should be fun.\" \"Benjamin, backup plan!\" \"It's raining ladies!\" \"The backup plan is called \"plan Benjamin\".\" \"Yeah!\" \"Get her!\"\"Get her!\" \"Get her!\" \"Wow.\" \"They really did a lot for this.\" \"Okay!\" \"David!\" \"Alice!\" \"This is it.\" \"You ready?\" \"Are you?\" \"Fight or be fought.\" \"Fun, isn't it?\" \"Who are you?\" \"You want to know who I am, Nora?\" \"Then you look inside your own heart.\" \"No, Madison.\" \"I'm not like you.\" \"I have something you'll never have.\" \"And what's that?\" \"Friends.\" \" Enjoy the good place.\" \" Go to the bad place.\" \"She's in trouble.\" \"Party time.\" \" Angels!\" \" Benjamin!\" \"Angels!\" \" You all get that flying lady?\" \" Yeah!\" \" Did you scratch her?\" \" Yeah!\" \"You kick her?\" \"You beat her up?\" \"Mama, I told you!\" \"I know it!\" \" We couldn't do it without you.\" \" Never!\" \" You hear that, Mama?\" \" I heard it.\" \"I've always known my little boy was smart!\" \"Why did you give my room away, Mama?\" \"I'll tell you why.\" \"Matthew?\" \"Yeah?\" \"I'm a Benjamin now!\" \" Matthew Benjamin!\" \" I love Matthew Benjamin!\" \" Boy, you did it!\" \" Hooray!\" \"Daddy!\" \"One moment.\" \"Daddy!\" \"Sweetie!\" \"You made it!\" \"We just finished.\" \"Another happy person.\" \"We finished her job sooner than we thought.\" \"Her?\" \"It was a girl this time.\" \"We had to play with her, but we finally got her to lie down!\" \"Well done!\" \"No, no, no!\" \" Jack!\" \" Adam.\" \"You made it.\" \"No, no, no!\" \"I know.\" \"We're resting, I know.\" \"Rest's over, dear.\" \"We're ready to play again!\" \"A small animal.\" \"I know you wanted to wait and everything, but...\" \" You look really pretty.\" \" Thanks, Patrick.\" \"I've been wanting to tell you this for a while.\" \"So here it goes.\" \"Patrick.\" \" Sam?\" \" Yes.\" \"A puppy.\" \"A puppy?\" \" Is that okay?\" \"I know it's a big step.\" \" Yes!\" \"I already got him.\" \" You did?\" \" Yes.\" \"David!\"\"David!\" \"David!\" \"Guess what.\" \"Patrick and I have something to tell you.\" \" Really?\" \" We're gonna get...\" \" You're gonna get what?\" \" A puppy!\"\" A puppy!\" \" A puppy!\" \"That's great!\" \" Yes.\" \" I already got him.\" \" You did.\" \" Wonderful!\" \" His name is Sam!\" \" So you're not leaving?\" \" No!\" \"Of course, you guys.\" \"I get to play with my two best friends.\" \"You think I'd leave that?\" \"No!\" \"What about you, David?\" \"With Oliver gone, you can go back to your old life.\" \"Are you kidding?\" \"This is my life.\" \" What about you, doctor?\" \" It's easy!\" \"I love our family!\"\"I love our family!\" \"I love our family!\" \"Oh!\" \"And I know we agreed to take things slow.\" \" Yes?\" \" But...\" \" You...\" \" Sorry.\" \"I feel a little uncomfortable.\" \"We should take this to the teacher and show it.\" \"Yes, just take it right there.\" \"I have.\" \"I like the sticker.\" \"Let me see your sticker.\" \"Hello?\" \"Is this Nora?\" \"Okay!\" \"I'm very excited!\" \"Look around.\" \"Over your right shoulder.\" \"Is somebody coming up behind me?\" \"I am being tickled.\" \"Tickled by the...\" \" I literally...\" \" I have it in...\" \"Words by School Group\"", "hash": "ddff06d096c65242dab707dd048a4e0c9b82caabd92d5266fdd25bb7d21fb578"}

funny.\" \"This ring is pure metal.\" \"The big rings are metal too.\" \"Big rings should be very light with a hole in the middle that stops it from getting hot.\" \"If the thing is less heavy than the stuff around it...\" \"It floats.\" \"There they are.\" \"I'm sure Hannah was great, but I just can't imagine life without David.\" \"Let's leave this place.\" \"I agree.\" \"Why the hurry, Hannah?\" \"Why the hurry, Hannah?\" \"Why the hurry, Hannah?\" \"You've only been here a little while.\" \"Now, I've waited for you before.\" \"In fact, I've waited for you a lot of days.\" \"That's a lot of weeks.\" \"That's a lot of months.\" \"That's many years.\" \"Enough about me.\" \"What about you, Hannah?\" \"How have you been?\" \"Samuel.\" \"I see you still look nice.\" \"You're brave to take from me.\" \"Taking back is more like it.\" \"Give us the rings.\" \"Give us the rings.\" \"Give us the rings!\" \"Don't lose those.\" \"We'll be taking them back in about a little time.\"

rings.\" \"Are you okay?\" \"Yeah, I'm okay.\" \"Let's leave.\" \"I know who did it.\"   \"Good job, Ben.\" \"We found him.\" \"Who did we find?\" \"He already had one ring.\" \"He just needed the second one.\" \"He wanted to pretend he was gone so no one would think it was him.\" \"Who are you all talking about?\" \"He needed time for his plan, so he blamed it on Samuel.\" \"Then he blamed Samuel for what happened to David.\" \"I think you're right, Angels.\" \"Oh no!\" \"So Cameron's the one who did it!\" \"It's just a guess at this point, Ben.\" \"We need to know for sure.\" \"Keys, Ben.\" \"Let's go.\" \"Silly.\" \"The path is clear.\" \"You can go now.\" \"Almost there.\" \"Something's coming.\" \"Good work, Adam.\" \"Can we leave yet?\" \"No, you can't, son.\" \"I have to make

here.\" \"Good job, Ben.\" \"Yeah, right.\" \"Cameron's working with someone.\" \"They're selling something important tonight.\" \"We'll look after them and then find David.\" \"See you, Ben.\" \"Yes, okay, okay.\" \"This is not fair.\" \"Katherine Grace.\" \"Hello, David.\" \"Don't you have a problem to solve?\" \"Well, I tried to leave my past, but it found me yesterday.\" \"And I put my friends in danger.\" \"They're in more danger now without you.\" \"Nora and Alice are gonna replace me with someone great.\" \"A real helper.\" \"Not someone who's pretending to be something she's not.\" \"Your past is what makes you who you are, David.\" \"Don't forget that Charlie chose you for a reason.\" \"Helpers are like stars.\" \"They can't be made.\" \"You have to find them.\" \"Each one is unique.\" \"Sometimes we look too hard for answers that are right in front of us.\" \"The people who want to buy are ready.\" \"We did it, friend!\" \"You know, I never really understood that friend thing.\" \"Hello, helpers.\" \"Madison Lily.\" \"Why?\" \"Why be a helper when I can be in charge?\" \"Looks like one of the three friends has gone away.\" \"Welcome back, David.\" \"You're such a typical stubborn fish sign.\" \"Always trying to show how strong you are and you couldn't make it one day on your own, could you?\" \"Someone reminded me that every helper is unique.\" \"And I knew it was you.\" \"Who else had friends in MN country could fix the safety fail and hire a surfer as a helper?\" \"Same person who would talk about a bike rider with a lion on his helmet as \"lion\".\" \"Very well done.\" \"Very good, really.\" \"You've got it all figured out.\" \"And now I'm gonna really enjoy showing you're wrong.\" \"But you're a helper.\" \"No.\" \"You just don't understand.\" \"I don't listen to a box anymore.\" \"I work for myself.\" \"Well, your boss is not nice.\" \"The helpers' strong pose.\" \"Seeing the three of you like that does remind me of the old times.\" \"But back then, it was a little bit different.\" \"You see, when I was a helper we used tools.\" \"Sorry, Charlie.\" \"Hello, helpers.\" \"Good evening, Charlie.\" \"I love the new room.\" \"Madison, is that you?\" \"Where are the helpers?\" \"I'm sure there's three more just like those.\" \"Madison, what did you do?\" \"We're just playing a little.\" \"You shouldn't worry, Charlie.\" \"You've never had trouble finding someone to help you.\" \"Hurting the friends doesn't show you're the best.\" \"You know that.\" \"Do I?\" \"Madison, you couldn't understand that this group is about teamwork.\" \"We're a family.\" \"We do...\" \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.\" \"Friends forever.\" \"I've heard it all before.\" \"It was very tempting once.\" \"Madison, you didn't listen to us on the case and put your friends in danger.\" \"When we finally found you, you were hurt so badly, we were scared.\" \"You did lose me.\" \"You see, being a friend wasn't my goal.\" \"It was keeping me from it.\" \"Your goal is still unknown.\" \"Don't do this, Madison.\" \"Hurting innocent people isn't right.\" \"There must be something in you that's still good.\" \"I was never good.\" \"I was great.\" \"Oh no.\" \"What a mean girl!\" \"You guys, we have to outsmart Madison.\" \"No matter what we try, she's always ahead of us.\" \"She's giving away the list tonight, when it's dark.\" \"But where?\" \"Nat, what else was said?\" \"Okay.\" \"\"Look at the stars beyond our world.\"\" \"It's safe to say it's here on earth.\" \"\"Go towards hope and stop at a stair.\"\" \"There's a Hope Street downtown.\" \"But no beach for miles.\" \"A stair.\" \"Astaire!\" \"Astaire?\" \"Astaire!\" \"She might be hurt.\" \"I'm worried.\" \"Guys, the stars.\" \"Walk of Fame.\" \"Beyond the big theatre.\" \"There's Dinah, Bob and Fred.\" \"Good job, Nat.\" \"Yeah!\" \"I think she's trying to hurt us.\" \"I can't believe it.\" \"We are here in Hollywood.\" \"Friends?\" \"I knew we could do it...\" \"Be quiet, please!\" \"What?\" \"I mean, not you, Mom.\" \"Sorry.\" \"Did you forget your manners?\" \"Yeah.\" \"I mean, no.\" \"We'll talk about this later.\" \"Bad group\" \"Another bad group\" \"Bad family\" \"Welcome to the big book of...\" \"Quiet.\" \"Give us the map.\" \"Yay!\" \"Jack!\" \"Jack!\" \"Jack!\" \"Jack!\" \"Jack!\" \"I like you!\" \"I heard the next story is crazy.\" \"The first one was good.\" \"Close your coat.\" \"What?\" \"Close your coat.\" \"The special party is at the highest place.\" \"You're in trouble for trying to stop fairness.\" \"Stop!\" \"The tricky move.\" \"Good.\" \"And it still works.\" \"We didn't wear strong clothes until I got hurt three times.\" \"On the big problem!\" \"We know!\" \"Don't say you forgot the second plan.\" \"I'd know you anywhere, you mean person...!\" \"Come on, mean lady.\" \"Talk.\" \"Can I join?\" \"No!\" \"The big show will be fun.\" \"Ben, second plan!\" \"It's raining girls!\" \"Second plan means \"plan Ben\".\" \"Yes!\" \"Stop that mean lady!\"\"Stop that mean lady!\" \"Stop that mean lady!\" \"Wow.\" \"They really did a lot for this.\" \"Okay!\" \"David!\" \"Alice!\" \"This is it.\" \"You ready?\" \"Are you?\" \"Stop or be stopped.\" \"Fun, right?\" \"Who are you?\" \"You want to know who I am, Nora?\" \"Then you look inside your own heart.\" \"No, Madison.\" \"I'm not like you.\" \"I have something you'll never have.\" \"And what's that?\" \"Friends.\" \"Have fun up there.\" \"Go away.\" \"She won't work here anymore.\" \"Party time.\" \"Angels!\" \"Ben!\" \"Angels!\" \"Did you all stop that flying lady?\" \"Yes!\" \"Did you touch her?\" \"Yes!\" \"You stop her?\" \"You stopped her kung fu?\" \"Mom, I told you!\" \"I know it!\" \"We couldn't have done it without you.\" \"Never!\" \"Did you hear that, Mom?\" \"I heard it.\" \"I've always known my boy was smart!\" \"Why did you give my room away, then, Mom?\" \"I'll tell you why.\" \"Matthew?\" \"Yeah?\" \"I'm a Ben now!\" \" Matthew Ben!\" \" I love Matthew Ben!\" \" Boy, you did it!\" \" Yay!\" \"Dad!\" \"One second.\" \"Dad!\" \"Darling!\" \"You made it!\" \"We just finished.\" \"Another happy friend.\" \"We finished the game faster than we thought.\" \"Game?\" \"It was a girl this time.\" \"We had to work together, but we finally won!\" \"Good job!\" \"No, no, no!\" \" Jack!\" \" Adam.\" \"You made it.\" \"No, no, no!\" \"I know.\" \"We're resting, I know.\" \"Rest is over, baby.\" \"We're back to play!\" \"Toy.\" \"I know you wanted to wait and everything, but...\" \" You look really nice.\" \" Thanks, Peter.\" \"I've wanted to ask you this for a while.\" \"So here it goes.\" \"Peter.\" \" Sammy?\" \" Yes.\" \"A puppy.\" \"A puppy?\" \" Is that okay?\" \"I know it's a big decision.\" \" Yes!\" \"I already got him.\" \" You did?\" \" Yes.\" \"David!\"\"David!\" \"David!\" \"Guess what.\" \"Peter and I have something to tell you.\" \" Really?\" \" We're gonna get...\" \" You're gonna get what?\" \" A puppy!\"\" A puppy!\" \" A puppy!\" \"That's awesome!\" \" Yes.\" \" I already got him.\" \" You did.\" \" Great!\" \" His name is Sammy!\" \" So you're not leaving?\" \" No!\" \"Of course, you guys.\" \"I get to play games with my two best friends.\" \"You think I'd quit?\" \"No!\" \"What about you, David?\" \"With Oliver gone, you can go back to your old routine.\" \"Are you kidding?\" \"This is my life.\" \" What about you, doctor?\" \" It's an easy choice!\" \"I love our family!\"\"I love our family!\" \"I love our family!\" \"Wow!\" \"And I know we agreed to take things slow.\" \" Yeah?\" \" But...\" \" You...\" \" Sorry.\" \"I feel uncomfortable.\" \"We should bring this to the teacher and check it.\" \"Yes, just look closely.\" \"I have.\" \"I like the sticker.\" \"Let me see your sticker.\"

sometimes, like we used to.\" \"We don't have fun?\" \"Not often.\" \"Not often?\" \"Sometimes.\" \"How's your time together?\" \"It's kinda great.\" \"Yeah, that part works.\" \"So, it seems sharing time is comfortable in that way, but not so in other ways.\" \"What other things do the two of you like to do together?\" \"Um, we go to watch stories sometimes.\" \"We go to eat.\" \"We used to play ball.\" \"He was so much better than me, it was a joke.\" \"I wasn't challenging enough for him.\" \"I never said that!\" \"It made me feel not good enough.\" \"What things do you do alone?\" \"Besides work?\" \"Exercise.\" \"Yeah.\" \"My job doesn't let me do much else.\" \"Friends?\" \"Most of my friends were helpers.\" \"But I don't see them anymore since I left the job.\" \"David never really had any close friends.\" \"That's not true.\" \"There's a group of helpers I meet with every month.\" \"You don't like those guys!\" \"We're out of time.\" \"This week, if any problems come up, try to focus on expressing what you're feeling instead of criticizing and blaming.\" \"Yes.\" \"Okay?\" \"Switch.\" \"Good job, Ryan.\" \"Oh dear, it's almost evening.\" \"Gabriel's going to be upset.\" \"Mom!\" \"Hello!\" \"How is my lovely girl today?\" \"She has the hiccups again.\" \":...has the hiccups again.\" \"She gets that from her daddy.\" \"He was a very burpy baby, wasn't he?\" \"Yes, he was!\" \"I'll get her some water.\" \"Do you remember to burp her often, dear, when she's nursing?\" \"Of course.\" \"What's wrong with you?\" \"I don't know.\" \"I think I just had a strange feeling.\" \"Hello!\" \"Every time I come by, there are more people here.\" \"Hi, I'm Charlotte, Lily's boss.\" \"I'm Rachel, Nathan's mother.\" \"We've met several times already.\" \"You're not living here now too, are you?\" \"I'm joking!\" \"Calm down.\" \"I don't mean to keep saying this.\" \"I parked in the driveway again.\" \"Well, there are two cars today!\" \"I'm sorry.\" \"I didn't know.\" \"Please, it's no big deal.\" \"I'm sure you didn't know.\" \"What's your excuse?\" \"Well, I was just dropping off\" \"I could get a little sign made up, ya know?\" \"Nathan, back it up, put it on the street!\" \"I'm joking!\" \"Look, if you want me to move it, I'll go move it right now.\" \"Don't be silly, whenever, it doesn't matter.\" \"Sooner rather than later.\" \"Oh, Lily, I'm having dinner with a friend tonight, so I won't need you to cook.\" \"Okay.\" \"But, I'm going to host a little gathering tomorrow evening, just some close friends\" \"I want to try out a new idea on, shouldn't be more than...30.\" \"Okay.\" \"Do you have time to go over the menu with me?\" \"Now?\" \"Yes!\" \"Take your time, dear.\" \"I've got all afternoon.\" \"Oh, nice to meet you, Nathan's mother!\" \"She's energetic.\" \"She's a bit crazy.\" \"Hey, Gabriel.\" \"Nathan, hey, how's it going?\" \"Good.\" \"Good, good, I'm glad to hear it.\" \"Listen, I don't know if you're aware of this, or if you even care, but we have two viewings tonight.\" \"One early in the evening and one a bit later.\" \"Okay, I'm coming.\" \"That's good, because we can't find your brother.\" \"Yeah, and he's not picking up his phone.\" \"And there's only so much I can do, right?\" \"Yes.\" \"I can't be in two places at once, Nathan!\" \"I understand, Ryan, alright?\" \"Stop telling me what to do.\" \"I'm not your kid!\" \"Well, I'm not your helper.\" \"I'm your friend.\" \"I am a funeral director now, okay?\" \"You guys took my money, you made me a friend.\" \"It's time you started treating me like one.\" \"Goodbye.\" \"So, Charlotte, how's school?\" \"It's okay.\" \"What kind of stuff are you doing?\" \"Well, yesterday, we had to draw a man quickly.\" \"Well, that sounds fun.\" \"Not really.\" \"It's hard.\" \"And, like, I don't even want to be a drawer or a painter or whatever, but they keep saying that we need to know how to do everything, like a famous artist.\" \"It's tough.\" \"Yeah, but, at least you get to be creative every day.\" \"Good morning!\" \"Hi!\" \"Hi, sweetheart!\" \"Hi, how's it going?\" \"It could not possibly be going any better.\" \"Would you look at this little girl?\" \"Isn't she lovely, huh?\" \"Yeah, there's some stuff coming out of her nose.\" \"Who's precious?\" \"Is it you?\" \"Yes, it is!\" \"Hey, Mom, can you help me with her today?\" \"Lily's gotta help Carol.\" \"Carol's having this big party, and Lily gotta shop.\" \"Of course.\" \"You guys, she did a big poop this morning.\" \"Who, Lily?\" \"Seriously, it was just so perfectly formed, so healthy and compact.\" \"It was like a grown-up poop!\" \"It made me so happy.\" \"Look, I swear, when you live with a baby, you get to see the world as being totally new all over again.\" \"They're just so pure and innocent.\" \"It's a privilege.\" \"And how come neither of you has been over to visit her recently?\" \"Because being a dad has turned you into a silly person.\" \"Wow.\" \"You're so tough and cool and above it all.\" \"I wish I was you.\" \"Does anybody want the end piece?\" \"Who wants the end piece?\" \"Oh, Nathan, could you take Mrs. Fiona to the place this afternoon?\" \"No, I've got the Patrick funeral.\" \"Yeah?\" \"Well, I've got the Benjamin funeral.\" \"Can't Ryan do it?\" \"I think he said, \"No way.\" \"I'm not your helper any more.\" \"Charlotte, can you give us a hand?\" \"Sorry, I have homework.\" \"We'll pay you some money.\" \"We'd pay a delivery service more than that.\" \"All right.\" \"As long as I don't have to touch any icky skin.\" \"No, she's all boxed up.\" \"And I can't do it till later, 'cause I have to practice drawing a perfect circle.\" \"That takes a lot of time?\" \"I have to be able to do it in class tomorrow, okay?\" \"It's not as easy as it sounds.\" \"Eeww.\" \"Is that the box that needs to go to the place?\" \"The-- ?\" \"Uh, yeah.\" \"Well, I can take it now.\" \"You're taking it?\" \"Yeah, they hired me to do runs, since nobody else wants to do it.\" \"Really?\" \"Yeah, for some money.\" \"But you're gonna need to help me get that into my car.\" \"So, what kind of music do you guys play?\" \"I don't know.\" \"It's kinda like early music meets some band.\" \"Emotionally like Sunny Day, but aware, like a famous band.\" \"We're still working it out.\" \"When you guys play, you should let me know.\" \"I'll come.\" \"Why don't you hang out, while we practice?\" \"I don't think I can.\" \"I've got this thing I'm supposed to Okay.\" \"I'm Patrick.\" \"I'm Charlotte.\" \"You want a drink?\" \"Sure.\" \"You really amaze me, Lily.\" \"Why?\" \"Your energy, it's boundless.\" \"You should be bottled as an energy source.\" \"You would help the world, I'm serious.\" \"Well, that's kinda funny, because I feel tired all the time.\" \"Really?\" \"Yeah.\" \"I think it just comes from being a mom, ya know?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Not that I'm complaining.\" \"I mean, Madison has totally changed my life.\" \"I can't even imagine going back to the way things were before.\" \"Wow.\" \"I mean, so what if I have to work extra hard?\" \"I want to.\" \"It's worth, it is so worth it.\" \"Cameron?\" \"No, don't pay any attention to me.\" \"I'm just worried...worried about the talk next week.\" \"I have to speak to Matthew, face-to-face!\" \"Wow, he is scary!\" \"Can I make you some tea?\" \"Oh, please, I'm not your grandma, okay?\" \"I'm your boss.\" \"Stop looking at me, Lily!\" \"Charlotte, I'm always here for you.\" \"Eh!\" \"Also, I swim in the morning, and I used to do that without clothes, which was a nice way to start the day, like I was a lady from a famous story.\" \"I would go out there feeling strong, like a hunter, which is what you have to do when you're in my work.\" \"But now I can't do that anymore, because there's a boy living here!\" \"I'm sure Nathan wouldn't mind\" \"I would!\" \"Also, I don't like the way he always parks in the driveway!\" \"I'm sorry.\" \"I--I will talk to him about it.\" \"Yeah.\" \"I'm gonna go swim.\" \"Are you ready for the green veggies?\" \"Yeah.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"Adding pepper.\" \"I already added pepper.\" \"Oh.\" \"Okay, I feel bad.\" \"What?\" \"When you said, \"I already I added pepper, \"\" \"I felt like you were mad at me for not knowing that already, and that you were also mad at me, that I shouldn't have done it.\" \"Why would I be mad at you?\" \"I don't know.\" \"Maybe you don't want me to help in the cooking.\" \"Maybe you just want me to prepare the food for you?\" \"Maybe you want to be the only one to cook.\" \"So, we have a little extra pepper in the food.\" \"It's not a big thing!\" \"I know it's not a big thing.\" \"Okay, I heard what you said.\" \"I didn't mean to make you feel bad.\" \"I know.\" \"Good.\" \"I love you.\" \"Are the carrots ready?\" \"Yeah.\" \"You know, I grew up in a family where people showed their anger a lot, so that's what close feels like to me.\" \"But you, you grew up in a family where no one ever showed anything.\" \"Yeah, we also never hit each other.\" \"So whenever I'm a bit mad, it scares you, right?\" \"Right.\" \"It just means I'm comfortable with you.\" \"It doesn't mean I don't love you.\" \"Did you get the clean clothes today?\"  \"Do you want to skip?\" \"Yes.\" \"Nathan, can you help me today and go to the family's goodbye ceremony for me?\" \"Who is Frank?\" \"Frank who?\" \"Muehler.\" \"His name is here for every Wednesday at 2.\" \"I don't know.\" \"It must be someone Rico wrote down.\" \"Hmm.\" \"There's a phone number.\" \"I will call and find out.\" \"Okay, don't.\" \"Kevin and I are talking to a helper.\" \"Really?\" \"It's not a big thing.\" \"Are you guys okay?\" \"Yes, we're okay.\" \"We're just talking to a helper to help us be better together.\" \"What happened?\" \"Nothing happened.\" \"Kevin is often angry like his dad, and I'm too nice like mom.\" \"Can we not talk about this again?\" \"Sure.\" \"You're okay, right?\" \"Can we not talk about this again?\" \"Got it.\" \"And how are you and Lily?\" \"Uh...we're good.\" \"It's still a little strange to me.\" \"All the different ways my life could have been, you know?\" \"Yes.\" \"Yes, I mean, it's just about a year ago I wanted to marry.\" \"Remember that?\" \"I thought I loved Bella, or maybe I thought I could make it work.\" \"But, you just never know.\" \"You have no idea what life will bring.\" \"So, can you go to the family's goodbye ceremony for me or not?\" \"What is it, you just need some time off?\" \"Are you okay?\" \"I'm okay.\" \"I'm trying out for the singing group.\" \"What?\" \"That sounds fun.\" \"I'm trying to do something for myself besides work and being with Kevin.\" \"I could really use your help with this.\" \"Okay.\" \"Don't worry.\" \"The family's goodbye ceremony is easy.\" \"You just do your best.\" \"No joke.\" \"I'm so nervous.\" \"David.\" \"You'll be good.\" \"From your mouth to the sky.\" \"Right.\" \"Thanks, Nathan.\" \"Any time.\" \"Hello?\" \"Hello, Rachel, it's Lily.\" \"Oh, hello.\" \"Rachel, did you give Maya peanut butter?\" \"Yes, and she really liked it!\" \"Now, Nathan\" \"Rachel, you should not give little ones peanut butter when they are less than one year old.\" \"They can get bad allergies!\" \"Didn't you know?\" \"No, I didn't.\" \"Is she ok?\" \"Yes, but that's not the main thing.\" \"You should never feed her peanut butter...or honey...or strawberries...or egg whites.\" \"Please.\" \"Of course.\" \"I'm sorry to sound so serious with you.\" \"I just--\" \"No, I'm sorry.\" \"I had no clue.\" \"Peanut butter was never an issue when my kids were small.\" \"Are you sure she's fine?\" \"She's fine.\" \"Do you need any help with her today?\" \"I could come over.\" \"Rachel, no.\" \"You spend a lot of time here.\" \"I feel bad.\" \"It's not a problem.\" \"I like--\" \"Really, have some time for yourself.\" \"I hardly saw Madison at all yesterday.\" \"I really just wanted it to be just us today.\" \"Okay.\" \"But thanks.\" \"I'll talk to you later.\" \"Thank goodness!\" \"It's very scary!\" \"I didn't know who to call!\" \"Madam, just stay calm and tell me what happened, okay?\" \"Come, I'll show you.\" \"Where has all the time gone?\" \"We haven't done half the things we wanted to\" \"Oh, well, we'll catch up at another time...\" \"This day was just a small part\" \"Too many words are still not said\" \"Oh, well, we'll catch up at another time.\" \"Just when the fun is starting\" \"It's time to leave\" \"But let's be happy for what we've had\" \"And what's to come.\" \"There's so much more hugging\" \"Still to be done, but time is running fast...\" \"Oh, well.\" \"We'll catch up at another time.\" \"It's always strange when you learn things like that.\" \"You know, later in your life.\" \"I mean, I had no idea that I wasn't planned.\" \"I'm not sure what difference it makes.\" \"I mean, Madison wasn't planned either.\" \"We couldn't love her any more than we do.\" \"Yeah.\" \"It's just...\" \"I don't know.\" \"What?\" \"I don't like knowing that my whole life is an accident.\" \"It's just too...random.\" \"Yeah, but that's the way it happened.\" \"Things happen the way they're meant to, Nathan.\" \"See, there's a kind of belief in that that I just don't believe.\" \"Well, what's the other choice?\" \"We make choices.\" \"Yeah, but maybe your mom and dad never would have decided to get married if you hadn't been born, and then not only would you not be here, but Alice and David wouldn't either.\" \"It's just not what was supposed to happen.\" \"But surely we're more than just...things that happen.\" \"Maybe we are.\" \"Maybe we're not.\" \"Oh, I love it when she does that!\" \"...when she does that.\" \"When she kind of moves, ya know?\" \"Right before she falls asleep, wakes herself up.\" \"You were scared the first time she ever did it.\" \"I remember that feeling of falling when I was little, like I was falling out of bed,\" \"and it always woke me up, like I was scared of what you were going to fall into?\" \"Yeah.\" \"But that doesn't happen to me anymore.\" \"Don't be so certain.\" \"What's happening with you?\" \"I think I dreamed this.\" \"What?\" \"This moment.\" \"This.\" \"This life we have together.\" \"You, me, Madison.\" \"Here.\" \"Now.\" \"I hope you enjoy the show.\"", "hash":

had to stop him.\" \"Of course you did.\" \"You did the right thing.\" \"He was my first.\" \"Really?\" \"But you told me you never did it.\" \"My first stop.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Who was this boy?\"

me?\" \"The Gabriels hurt my parents.\" \"What?\" \"Sorry, Matthew.\" \"I spoke against them.\" \"Hold on.\" \"Adam.\" \"He spoke against the Gabriels.\" \"That's it.\" \"The Gabriels must have the thing.\" \"This is our only clue.\" \"The tall man.\" \"Our most known bad man.\" \"That's right.\" \"This needs to be checked.\" \"Yes, let's go and do that.\" \"Let me see it.\" \"Yeah, I know what this is.\" \"I have one.\" \"The ladies gave it to us at the home.\" \"Home.\" \"Good job.\" \"Matthew is safe with us now, friends.\" \"It's up to us to keep him safe.\" \"Hey, I know the safest

trou...\" \"Yes, ma'am.\" \" Come on.\" \" Yes, ma'am.\" \" Look at those things.\" \" Boys!\" \"Mother will see you now.\" \"Mother, do you know this man?\" \"Of course I know who he is.\" \"We named him Adam, like a helper in a story.\" \"Please come forward.\" \"Please, girls.\" \"But his real name, like so much about him, was a secret.\" \"He joined us when he was 7.\" \"He was found walking in the hills, eating plants and bugs.\" \"We think his family was in a circus group who passed away in a big fire.\" \"Even though the doctors couldn't find anything wrong, he never said a word.\" \"And there were other strange things.\" \"He was a very shy child until it was time for his monthly haircut.\" \"Then one morning, he was simply gone.\" \"A man was looking after Max.\" \"So you're saying this man is the only helper of your home?\" \"Yes, he really is like a angel.\" \"Mother, have you talked with him since?\" \"Well, not really that much except for a haircut now and then.\" \"But he does send gifts.\" \"Like this morning.\" \" Ethan's car.\" \" That is a nice car.\" \"A vintage car from the mid 20th century.\" \" Birds.\" \" I know.\" \"Bird mess.\" \"What group did you girls say

ask me about my things.\" \"My family had a hard time, man, because we didn't have enough food.\" \"Animal sickness.\" \"Mouth sores.\" \"A thing boys do.\" \" A thing boys do?\" \" Yes, my wife just had two babies.\" \" Both like little fairies.\" \" Little fairies?\" \"Smell this.\" \"Fresh smell.\" \"If you don't believe that, try using a lucky plant.\" \"McG!\" \"Put this stuff on the big boat.\" \" Tough, eh?\" \" That was heavy.\" \"I think we should rest.\" \"Wait a moment.\" \"I smell something wrong.\" \"This ring is made of a very special metal.\" \"The special rings are made of another special metal.\" \"Special chips should be very light surrounded by an empty part that keeps it cool.\" \"If the thing is lighter than the thing it's in...\" \"It floats.\" \"There they are.\"

for you before.\" \"In fact, I've waited for you many days.\" \"That's a lot of weeks.\" \"That's many months.\" \"That's a few years.\" \"Enough about me.\" \"What about you, Hannah?\" \"How have you been?\" \"Samuel.\" \"I see you are still doing fine.\" \"You were bold to take from me.\" \" Taking back's more like it.\" \" Give us the rings.\" \"Give us the rings.\" \"Give us the rings!\"

it.\"\"I'm on it.\" \"I'm on it.\" \"Okay?\" \"Now, move back.\" \"We're changing plan.\" \"Move back!\" \"Stop!\"\"Stop!\" \"Stop!\" \" Let's go.\" \" Okay.\" \"Hurry, let's go.\" \"Skip.\" \"Run.\" \"Get out of here.\" \"Let's go.\" \"Get out of here.\" \" Great job, Ben.\" \" Yeah, right.\" \"Cameron's working with a partner.\" \"They're selling the list tonight.\" \"We'll deal with them and then find David.\" \" See you, Ben.\" \" Yeah, all right, all right.\" \"This is some nonsense.\" \" Katherine.\" \" Hello, David.\" \"Don't you have a job to do?\" \"Well, I tried to forget my past, but it found me yesterday.\" \"And I put my friends in danger.\" \"They're in more danger now without you.\" \"Nora and Adam are gonna replace me with someone great.\" \"A real Angel.\" \"Not someone who's pretending to be something she's not.\" \"Your past is what makes you who you are, David.\" \"Don't forget that Charlie picked you for a reason.\" \"Diamonds are like angels.\" \"They can't be made.\" \"You need to find them.\" \"Each one is different.\" \"Sometimes we try too hard to find answers that are right in front of us.\" \"The buyers are ready.\" \"We did it, friend!\" \"You know, I never really understood that friend thing.\" \"Hello, angels.\" \"Madison Lee.\" \"Why?\" \"Why be an angel when I can be the boss?\" \"Looks like one of the three friends has left.\" \"Hello!\" \"Welcome back, David.\" \"You're such a typical stubborn fish sign.\" \"Always trying to show how strong and independent you are and you couldn't make it one day on your own, could you?\" \"Someone reminded me that every angel is different.\" \"And I knew it was you.\" \"Who else had friends in MO country could fix the broken safe and hire a swimmer as an attacker?\" \"Same star sign person who would call a biker with a lion on his helmet as \"Lion.\"\" \"Very well done.\" \"Very impressive, really.\" \"You've figured it all out.\" \"And now I'm going to enjoy knocking those circles right off your heads.\" \"But you're an angel.\" \"No.\" \"You just don't understand.\" \"I don't listen to a box anymore.\" \"I work for myself.\" \"Well, your boss is not nice.\" \"The Angels fighting pose.\" \"Seeing the three of you like that does make me remember the old times.\" \"But back then, it was a little bit different.\" \"You see, when I was an angel we used toys.\" \"Sorry, Charlie.\" \"Hello, angels.\" \"Good evening, Charlie.\" \"I love the new room.\" \"Madison, is that you?\" \"Where are the angels?\" \"I'm sure there's three more where they came from.\" \"Madison, what have you done?\" \"We're just playing a little.\" \"You shouldn't worry yourself, Charlie.\" \"You've never had trouble finding someone to help you.\" \"Hurting the angels doesn't show you're the best.\" \"You know that.\" \"Do I?\" \"Madison, you never understood that this team is about working together.\" \"We're a family.\" \"We do...\" \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.\" \"Angels forever.\" \"I've heard the story.\" \"It was very interesting once.\" \"Madison, you purposely went against the rules on the DS case and put your angel friends in danger.\" \"When we helped you out, you were very hurt. We thought we might lose you.\" \"You did lose me.\" \"Being an angel didn't help me reach my goal.\" \"It was stopping me.\" \"Your goal is still unknown.\" \"Don't do this, Madison.\" \"Hurting people who are good is not the right thing.\" \"There must be something in you that's still nice.\" \"I was never nice.\" \"I was very good.\" \"Oh no.\" \"What a mean girl!\" \"Friends, we have to be smarter than Madison.\" \"No matter what we do, she's always ahead of us.\" \"She's going to give away the list tonight, when it's dark.\" \"But where?\" \"Nora, what else did Cameron say?\" \"Okay.\" \"\"Travel to the stars far away.\"\" \"It's safe to say it's on this earth.\" \"\"Travel to a place of hope and stop on a step.\"\" \"There's a Hope Street in the city.\" \"But no beach for a long way.\" \"A step.\" \"Astaire!\" \"Astaire?\" \"Astaire!\" \"Might have a head bump.\" \"I'm worried.\" \"Friends, the stars.\" \"Famous stars in the city.\" \"Past the big movie theatre.\" \"There's Dinah Shore, Bob Hope and Fred Astaire.\" \"Good job, Nora.\" \"Yeah!\" \"I think she's trying to hurt us.\" \"I can't believe it.\" \"We are here in the big city.\" \"Angels?\" \"I knew we could do it...\" \"Be quiet, please!\" \"What?\" \"I mean, not you, Mama.\" \"Sorry.\" \"Have you lost your sense?\" \"Yeah.\" \"I mean, no.\" \"We'll talk about this later.\" \"Bad group\" \"Another bad group\" \"Another bad group\" \"Welcome to the big world of...\" \"Quiet.\" \"Give us the map.\" \"Yay!\" \"Adam!\"\"Adam!\"\"Adam!\" \"Adam!\" \"Adam!\" \"I love you!\" \"I hear the next story's crazy.\" \"The first one was so good.\" \"Close your jacket.\" \"What?\" \"Close your jacket.\" \"The special meeting is at the top.\" \"Way to the roof\" \"You're caught for trying to block justice.\" \"Stop!\" \"A tricky move.\" \"Classic.\" \"And it still works.\" \"We never wore protective clothes until I got hurt three times.\" \"On the big case!\" \"We know!\" \"Don't tell me you forgot about the backup plan.\" \"I'd know that person anywhere, you meanie...!\" \"Good night, little one.\" \"Let's have fun, friend.\" \"Can I join in?\" \"No!\" \"The show should be fun.\" \"Benjamin, plan two!\" \"It's raining friends!\" \"Plan two means plan for Benjamin.\" \"Yes!\" \"Get that friend!\"\"Get that friend!\" \"Get that friend!\" \"Wow.\" \"They really did a lot for this thing.\" \"Okay!\" \"David!\" \"Alice!\" \"This is it.\" \"You ready?\" \"Are you?\" \"Play or be played.\" \"Exciting, isn't it?\" \"Who are you?\" \"You want to know who I am, Nora?\" \"Then you look inside your own heart.\" \"No, Madison.\" \"I'm nothing like you.\" \"I have something you'll never have.\" \"And what's that?\" \"Friends.\" \" Enjoy the good place.\" \" Go away.\" \"She is so gone.\" \"Party time.\" \" Angels!\" \" Benjamin!\" \"Angels!\" \" You all found that flying lady?\" \" Yes!\" \" Did you touch her?\" \" Yes!\" \"You patted her?\" \"You patted her, right?\" \"Mama, I told you!\" \"I know it!\" \" We couldn't have done it without you.\" \" Never!\" \" You hear that, Mama?\" \" I heard it.\" \"I've always known my boy was smart!\" \"Why you give my room away, then, Mama?\" \"I'll tell you why.\" \"Matthew?\" \"Yeah?\" \"I'm a Benjamin now!\" \" Matthew Benjamin!\" \" I love Matthew Benjamin!\" \" Boy, you did it!\" \" Hooray!\" \"Daddy!\" \"One second.\" \"Daddy!\" \"Darling!\" \"You made it!\" \"We just finished.\" \"Another happy friend.\" \"We finished sooner than we thought.\" \" Her?\" \" It was a lady this time.\" \"We had to work together, but we finally made her happy!\" \"Well done!\" \"No, no, no!\" \" Jack!\" \" Alice.\" \"You made it.\" \"No, no, no!\" \"I know.\" \"We're resting, I know.\" \"Rest's over, baby.\" \"We're back to play!\" \"Friend.\" \"I know you wanted to wait and everything, but...\" \" You really look beautiful.\" \" Thanks, Patrick.\" \"I've been wanting to ask you this for a long time.\" \"So here goes.\"

that up?\" \"No!\" \"What about you, David?\" \"With the bad guy gone, you can go back to your old life.\" \"Are you kidding?\" \"This is my life.\" \" What about you, doctor?\" \" It's easy!\" \"I love our family!\"\"I love our family!\" \"I love our family!\" \"Wow!\" \"And I know we agreed to take things slow.\" \" Yeah?\" \" But...\" \" You...\" \" Sorry.\" \"I have a problem.\" \"We should

upset.\" \"Mom.\" \"Hello!\" \"How is my little girl today?\" \"She has hiccups again.\" \"She has hiccups again.\" \"She is like her dad.\" \"He used to have a lot of gas as a baby, right?\" \"Yes, he did.\" \"I'll get her some water.\" \"Do you burp her when she's eating?\" \"Of course.\" \"What's wrong with you?\" \"I'm not sure, I think I just had a strange feeling.\" \"Hello!\" \"Every time I come by, there are more people here.\" \"Hi, I'm Cameron, Lily's boss.\" \"I'm Rachel, Nathan's mom.\" \"We've met before.\" \"You're not living here now too, are you?\" \"I'm joking.\" \"Calm down.\" \"I don't like to keep talking about this.\" \"I parked in the front again.\" \"There are two cars today.\" \"I'm sorry, I didn't know.\" \"It's okay, I'm sure you didn't know.\" \"What's your reason?\" \"Well, I was just dropping something off...\" \"I could make a small sign, you know?\" \"\"Nathan, move it, put it on the street.\"\" \"I'm joking.\" \"If you want me to move it, I'll do it right now.\" \"Don't be silly, do it when you can.\" \"Sooner is better.\" \"Oh, Lily, I'm having dinner with a friend tonight,\" \"so, I won't need you to cook.\" \"Okay.\" \"But, I am going to have a small party tomorrow night, just some close friends I want to share a new idea with.\" \"Shouldn't be more than... 30.\" \"Okay.\" \"Do you have time to plan a menu with me?\" \"Now?\" \"Yes!\" \"Take your time, dear, I have all afternoon.\" \"Nice to meet you, Nathan's mom!\" \"She's full of energy.\" \"She's a little crazy.\" \"Hey, Ryan.\" \"Nathan, hey, how are you?\" \"Good.\" \"Good, good, I'm glad to hear it.\" \"Listen, I don't know if you know this, or if you even care, we have two showings tonight,\" \"one early night and one late?\" \"Okay, I'm coming.\" \"That's good, because your brother is missing.\" \"Yes, and he's not picking up his phone, and there's only so much I can do, you know?\" \"Yes.\" \"I can't be in two jobs at once!\" \"I understand, Ryan, okay?\" \"Stop telling me what to do, I'm not your child.\" \"Yes, and I'm not your worker.\" \"I'm your friend.\" \"I am a trained person who takes care of people when they pass away, okay?\" \"You guys took my money, you made me a friend.\" \"It's time you started treating me like one.\" \"Goodbye.\" \"So, Charlotte, how's school?\" \"It's okay.\" \"What kind of things are you doing?\" \"Well, yesterday we had to draw this man in like 30 seconds.\" \" Well, that sounds fun.\" \" Not really.\" \"It's hard.\" \"And, I don't even want to be a drawer, or a painter, but they keep saying that we need to know how to do everything, like a famous painter.\" \"It's intense.\" \"Yes, but... at least you get to be creative every day.\" \" Good morning.\" \" Hi.\" \" Hello, sweetie.\" \" How are you doing?\" \"It could not possibly be going any better.\" \"Would you look at this little girl?\" \"Is that the most beautiful face or what, huh?\" \"Yes, there's some stuff coming out of her nose.\" \"Who's precious, is it you?\" \"Yes, it is!\" \"Mom, can you help me with her today?\" \"Lisa's gotta help Carol.\" \"Carol's having this big dinner,\" \" and Lisa's gotta shop.\" \" Of course.\" \"You guys, she took the most amazing poop this morning.\" \"Who, Lisa?\" \"Seriously, it was so perfectly formed, so healthy and compact, it was like a big person poop.\" \"It made me so happy.\" \"I swear, when you live with a baby, you get to see the world as being totally new.\" \"You know, they're so pure and uncorrupted, it's a joy.\" \"How come neither of you has been over to visit her recently?\" \"Because being a father has made you silly.\" \"Wow.\" \"You're so tough and cool and above it all.\" \"I wish I was you.\" \" Does anybody want the last slice?\" \" Who wants the last slice?\" \"Nathan, can you drop Mrs. Fiona at the place this afternoon?\" \"No, I've got another job.\" \"Yes, I have the Benjamin funeral.\" \"Can't Ryan do it?\" \"I think his exact words were, \"No way,\" \"I'm not your helper anymore. \"\" \"Charlotte, can you help us?\" \"Sorry, I have schoolwork.\" \"We'll give you $50.\" \"We'd pay a delivery service more than that.\" \"Okay.\" \"As long as I don't have to touch any dead skin.\" \" No, she's all boxed up.\" \" And I can't do it till late afternoon, 'cause I have to practice drawing a perfect circle.\" \"That takes a lot of time?\" \"I have to be able to do it in class tomorrow, okay?\" \"It's not as easy as it sounds.\" \" Waiting for him \" \" To show you \" \" How he's going to give himself \" \" Completely to you \" \" 'Cause this time \" \" He says you will do well \" \" In a better day \" \" But you will give a little more... \" \"Eww.\" \"Is that the box that needs to go to the crematory?\" \"The wh... uh, yeah.\" \"Well, I can take it now.\" \" You're taking it?\" \" Yeah, they hired me to do runs, since nobody else wants to do it.\" \" Really?\" \" Yeah, for $50 a run.\" \"But you're gonna need to help me get that into my car.\" \"So, what kind of music do you guys play?\" \"I don't know.\" \"It's a bit like some famous music.\" \"Emotionally open like a famous band but aware like a famous group.\" \"We're still figuring it out.\" \"When you guys play, you should let me know.\" \"I'll come.\" \"Why don't you stay while we practice?\" \"Oh, I don't think I can.\" \"I've got this thing I'm supposed to...\" \"Okay.\" \" I'm Patrick.\" \" I'm Charlotte.\" \" Do you want a drink?\" \" Sure.\" \"You really amaze me, Lily.\" \"Why?\" \"Your energy, it's endless.\" \"You should be a source of energy.\" \"You would help the world.\" \"I'm serious.\" \"Well, that's funny, because I feel tired all the time.\" \" Really?\" \" Yeah.\" \"I think it just comes with being a mom, you know?\" \"Yeah.\" \"It's not that I'm complaining.\" \"I mean, Madison has totally changed my life.\" \"I can't even imagine going back to the way things were before.\" \" Wow.\" \"So what if I have to work a lot?\" \"I want to.\" \"It's worth it.\" \"It's so worth it.\" \" Charlotte?\" \" Ugh!\" \"No, don't listen to me.\" \"I'm just nervous... nervous about this talk next week.\" \"I have to speak to Matthew in person.\" \"Wow, is he scary.\" \"Can I make you some tea?\" \"For goodness' sake, I'm not your grandma, okay?\" \"I'm your boss.\" \"Stop looking at me, Lily!\" \"Charlotte, I'm always here for you...\" \"Ah!\" \"Also, I swim in the morning, and I used to do that without clothes, which was a great way to start the day.\" \"Like I was a hero.\" \"I would go out there feeling like a warrior, like a hunter, which is what you have to do when you're in my job.\" \"But now I can't do that anymore, because there's a boy living here!\" \" I'm sure Nathan wouldn't mind...\" \" I would!\" \"Also, I don't like the way he always parks in the driveway.\" \"I'm sorry, I will talk to him about it.\" \"Yeah.\" \"I'm gonna go swim.\" \"Are you ready for the food?\" \"Yeah.\" \" What are you doing?\" \" Adding pepper.\" \"I already added pepper.\" \"Oh.\" \"Okay, I feel bad.\" \" What?\" \" When you said I already added pepper, I felt like you were mad at me for not knowing that already, and that you were also upset with me, that I shouldn't have done it.\" \" Why would I be upset with you?\" \" I don't know.\" \"Maybe you don't want me to help with the cooking.\" \"Maybe you just want me to get the food ready for you?\" \"Maybe you want to be in charge of what happens with the food.\" \"So, we have a little extra pepper.\" \" It's not a big deal.\" \" I know it's not a big deal.\" \"Okay.\" \"I heard what you said.\" \"I didn't mean to make you feel bad.\" \"I know.\" \"Good, I love you.\" \" Are the carrots ready?\" \" Yeah.\" \"You know, I grew up in a family where people showed their anger a lot.\" \"So that's what love feels like to me.\" \"But you, you grew up in a family where no one ever showed any feelings.\" \"Yeah, we also never hit each other.\" \"So, whenever I'm a little upset, it scares you, right?\" \"Right.\"  \"Oh, class.\" \"What type of class?\" \"Drawing class.\" \"We're learning to draw a round circle.\" \"That sounds fun.\" \"It's

What's that?\" The announcer said, \"Welcome to the first ever kids car race. After many years of grown-up racing, kids from 8 to 16 can now drive real cars on the same track as the grown-ups.\" \"I see it! Mom!

Wait and see, I'm going to win.\" Alice agreed, \"Yes! I love this car! But it's a little different from the other one. For example, it's more sensitive.\" Emma reminded Alice, \"Listen carefully, Alice. Moving up to this age group will be more work, and you won't always win right away. We want you to do well in school too. A 'B' on your report card means you stay in our town. Any 'C's, and the cars will be stopped. We're serious about this.\" Alice replied, \"Ok, I understand.\" \n\nThe announcer said, \"It's a beautiful day for racing here in our town. We've seen some talented young drivers. They go at pretty fast speeds. Some of them don't even have driver's licenses!\" Alice and Benjamin were the final two racers. The announcer introduced them, \"In the first lane, we have Alice. In the second lane, we have Benjamin.

Let's see who's going to take home this trophy.\" But Alice didn't win. The announcer announced, \"The winner is Benjamin!\" Benjamin's dad laughed and said, \"Make sure you bring some tissues next time, Alice!\"  \"I just feel like... like that's where I am happy.\" \"Ever since I was small,\" \"and I'd sit in Daddy's car in the driveway.\" \"I don't feel like I am happy anywhere else.\" \"And...

few years.\" \"When I get mine, we can race.\" \"Uh, no way.\" \"I'll still be older, so forget it.\" \"But we'll have the same kind of car.\" \"Forget it.\" \"Why?\" \"'Cause when I win, I only won against a young kid,\" \"And if, and I mean if, by some miracle, you win,\" \"Then I lost to a young kid.\" \"It's not good for me either way.\" \"You really make me laugh, you know that?\" \"You take it so seriously.\" \"How am I supposed to take it?\" \"It's just a race.\" \"When you lose a race\" \"Which is rare.\" \"Ok.\" \"But even when you win, like, if you get\" \"a slow time during practice

\"Tired.\" \"All:\" \"Tired.\" \"Happy.\" \"All:\" \"Happy.\" \"Sad.\" \"All:\" \"Sad.\" \"Excited.\" \"All:\" \"Excited.\" \"Calm.\" \"All:\" \"Calm.\" \"Angry.\" \"All:\" \"Angry.\" \"Rational.\" \"All:\" \"Rational.\" \"Story time.\" \"Narrator:\" \"Welcome back, race fans,\" \"to the big race in the city.\" \"Let's go!\" \"Narrator:\" \"Lane one, Charlotte.\" \"Yes!\" \"And Charlotte wins with a very fast time!\" \"And that breaks the old record that was held by,\" \"That's right, her big sister, Emma.\" \"How about that?\" \"That's what we call keeping it in the family.\" \"Wow!\" \"Did you see that?\" \"Did you see that, huh?\" \"Huh?\" \"Well done.\" \"Now we're both record holders.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Well...\" \"Isn't that great?\" \"What's wrong?\" \"You had fun, that's all.\" \"That's all?\" \"That's all.\" \"Alright.\" \"Why do you take time to put on makeup\" \"when you're going to wear a helmet, and nobody can see?\" \"So what?\" \"[Knocking]\" \"Hello, Emma.\" \"Jack.\" \"I talked to you for a big magazine.\" \"Hey, Mr. Jack.\" \"I'll be out soon.\" \"Uh, I'm actually here to talk to your sister.\" \"Oh.\" \"Ok.\" \"For you.\" \"Try not to mess up your hair.\" \"Charlotte, Hi.\" \"Hey.\" \"Couple questions for you.\" \"Of course, I'm happy for her.\" \"I mean, she's my sister,\" \"And I love her, and it's just that...\" \"Ohh!\" \"She just makes me crazy sometimes.\" \"Don't let her.\" \"I can't help it.\" \"And it's not like she does it on purpose.\" \"At least, not all the time.\" \"Like today.\" \"When I get asked questions, I get all nervous,\" \"And I usually just stutter,\" \"And my mouth gets dry, like I don't know what.\" \"I've seen it, remember?\" \"Right.\" \"But Charlotte, you know,\" \"It's like nothing to her.\" \"Even racing.\" \"I mean, she doesn't try as hard as I ever did,\" \"And she's just as good as I was when I was her age.\" \"I mean, everything is so much easier for her.\" \"Well, she had a big advantage.\" \"What?\" \"She had you to teach her lots of things.\" \"I mean, she's good,\" \"But she's a lot better because of you.\" \"You know, for a boy,\" \"You say some smart things once in a while.\" \"I'll take that as a compliment.\" \"Should I go?\" \"I don't want to ruin your love life.\" \"I need to have one before you can ruin it.\" \"I'm going to find you a girlfriend.\" \"Me?\" \"What about you?\" \"Where's your boyfriend?\" \"I'm away playing every weekend.\" \"Not every weekend.\" \"I don't understand.\" \"I mean, maybe they're scared or something.\" \"Because they're just learning,\" \"and you've been playing games since you were 8.\" \"I can't even get them to talk to me,\" \"and she's got them all around her.\" \"I don't understand.\" \"Well, it's easy.\" \"She loses.\" \"Down, girl, down.\" \"Just looking.\" \"Well, put your eyes back in.\" \"It's time to practice.\" \"Look at this.\" \"It's our game girl.\" \"She thinks she's so cool.\" \"Yeah, big deal.\" \"She drives a car.\" \"Think she likes candy, too?\" \"The second one of them breaks a nail,\" \"They'll call for help.\" \"Besides, they're just jealous.\" \"Why?\" \"They're the popular ones.\" \"Just because they're popular\" \"doesn't mean anybody likes them.\" \"Let's go, girls!\" \"2 lines.\" \"Outside playing.\" \"Let's go!\"\"Let's go!\" \"Let's go!\" \"Decide to come out for a real game, Emily?\" \"If you get tired or anything, take a break.\" \"Are you saying what I do is not a game?\" \"Well, it doesn't take a lot of ability\" \"to sit down.\" \"Don't forget, she has to press the button, too.\" \"Ever drive a toy car?\" \"The forces are so strong, it pushes you into the seat.\" \"You can't breathe, really because of the pressure.\" \"Makes it kind of hard to move your head and arms,\" \"and, believe me, you have to do both.\" \"So you really have to make your arm and shoulder strong,\" \"and as for hand and eye playing,\" \"you make a mistake, you lose a point.\" \"I make a mistake, someone can get hurt.\" \"So, sorry.\" \"I have to disagree with you.\" \"It does take a little ability to do what I do.\" \"Coach:\" \"Very good, Emily!\" \"Oh, man.\" \"Can you see what's wrong in this picture?\" \"I give up.\" \"What's wrong?\" \"We have almost the same times,\" \"Same records, and look.\" \"Jack has many sponsors,\" \"And I can't even get one.\" \"Is that what's making you sad?\" \"Yes.\" \"I see it a lot.\" \"There's kids here, kids I've won against,\" \"And they all have sponsors.\" \"Because they're boys.\" \"That's the only reason.\" \"It's not fair.\" \"I'm sorry, dad.\" \"I mean, I know it's a lot of money\" \"You worry about that.\" \"But you wouldn't have to if I could get a sponsor.\" \"I'm as good as, or better than, those kids,\" \"And they all have sponsors.\" \"It's just because I'm a girl.\" \"And it's not fair.\" \"I'll tell you what.\" \"I'll talk tomorrow with Mr. White about sponsorship,\" \"And you just keep racing.\" \"Ok?\" \"Ok.\" \"Hey.\"\"Hey.\" \"Hey.\" \"How did it go?\" \"Emma:\" \"What did they say?\" \"Did you get it?\" \"I'm sorry, honey.\" \"I had a long talk with Mr. White,\" \"And he said that his company couldn't sponsor you because,\" \"Well, at least he was honest,\" \"He said there's a lot of people out there\" \"Kind of upset because you keep winning against the boys.\" \"Just give it time, honey.\" \"When you get closer to the big race,\" \"They won't be able to ignore you.\" \"Why are people like that?\" \"People are slow to change sometimes.\" \"Anything new or different kind of scares them.\" \"And you are different, honey.\" \"Now, I know you're not the most patient person.\" \"Neither am I.\" \"So you get it honest.\" \"But you're just gonna have to wait.\" \"They'll come around.\" \"Thanks for trying, daddy.\" \"Ow!\" \"Are you hurt?\" \"No.\" \"I'm okay.\"\"I'm okay.\" \"I'm okay.\" \"Are you sure?\" \"I'm okay.\"\"I'm okay.\" \"I'm okay.\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Uh-Huh.\" \"Yeah.\" \"All Right.\" \"Let's get back to practice.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Ok.\" \"Here.\" \"You should see a doctor.\" \"I'm okay.\" \"You can't even lift your arm.\" \"If I tell my mom and dad, they won't let me race this weekend.\" \"So, take a weekend off.\" \"Ok.\" \"Ok.\" \"Silly thought.\" \"Hey, dear.\" \"Hey.\" \"Emma hurt herself at volleyball today.\" \"She's got a bruise on her shoulder the size of an orange.\" \"Why didn't she say something?\" \"Why do you think?\" \"It's too much for her, Gabriel.\" \"She's gotta cut back on the racing.\" \"She'll never make the big race if she does that.\" \"I don't care about the big race, Gabriel.\" \"I'm worried about her.\" \"You're pushing her too hard.\" \"Dear, the only one pushing Emma is Emma.\" \"Oh, you help, Gabriel.\" \"You do.\" \"I just want her to be good.\" \"For who?\" \"You or her?\" \"You know, when she first started, I admit, I was a little jealous.\" \"And, at first, I thought...\" \"Well, let's face it, she's a better driver than I ever was.\" \"But that wasn't it, dear.\" \"It was her love.\" \"That kid has a real love for this,\" \"And she's known it since she was little.\" \"She's still a kid.\" \"I know.\" \"But, dear,\" \"The first time she got behind a wheel,\" \"I could see that she knew how to do things that can't be taught.\" \"Only the best drivers have that...\" \"That...\" \"That feeling.\" \"You have it when you're born,\" \"And it seems to me, if God gives you a natural talent like that,\" \"It has to be encouraged.\" \"But it's just that she's going through a tough age for a girl.\" \"And then she's got to deal with stuff that most kids don't.\" \"I hate to think she's missing out on being a kid.\" \"Hey,\" \"If Emma or Charlotte ever want to quit racing,\" \"I am not gonna stand in their way.\" \"Announcer:\" \"Welcome to today's race, folks.\" \"These young drivers will be racing against time\" \"And trying to keep from being eliminated.\" \"Those with the best times go on to race another day,\" \"So every little moment counts.\" \"Jack, you've really been doing well in the NE city,\" \"What brings you down to HO city?\" \"Well, my helper sent me down for the spring races.\" \"That was great.\" \"So good today.\" \"I know.\" \"Gonna take it a little easy out there today?\" \"Never.\" \"What is he doing here?\" \"You just got on the cover of Kids Racer\" \"For the third time in a row.\" \"Jack:\" \"Yeah.\" \"Who else?\" \"What do you want to bet I win him\" \"In the race tomorrow?\" \"And this time,\" \"He's not gonna know what happened.\" \"Not a good idea to take this stuff to heart.\" \"I can't help it.\" \"I still have bad dreams\" \"About the time he won me.\" \"What do you think of the race so far?\" \"Not much.\" \"But, um,\" \"I think I might be racing one of these guys here\" \"For the big race, so I had to check things out.\" \"Guys?\" \"Do you hear that?\" \"Guys?\" \"The man on the loudspeaker:\" \"In lane 2, Jack.\" \"Emma, let's go.\" \"Monkey, relax.\" \"It's just a practice race.\" \"The man on the loudspeaker:\" \"And that's Jack with a time of 8.91.\" \"8.91.\" \"I can beat that.\" \"The man on the loudspeaker:\" \"In Lane One, Emma.\" \"The man on the loudspeaker:\" \"An 8.89 for Emma.\" \"So, what was my time?\" \"That was 8.89, honey.\" \"Yes.\" \"You beat his time.\" \"We're coming to get you.\" \"Dad, stop.\" \"Hey, Jack.\" \"Mr. K.\" \"Those are for your son,\" \"In case he starts crying when I win him in the final.\" \"It was just a joke.\" \"No, it wasn't, Emma.\" \"For the first time in your life, you embarrassed me.\" \"Oh, but it's ok when he does it?\" \"You're not him!\" \"You have been taught better.\" \"You want to act like him?\" \"Go ahead, be like the K's.\" \"Some time ago, I had to teach you how to act when you lose,\" \"But I never...\" \"Never thought I'd have to teach you how to win.\" \"Honey,\" \"I know it would feel good for a little bit\" \"To get back at him, and to be honest,\" \"I've wanted to do it myself a few times,\" \"But, in the end, all you do is make yourself look bad.\" \"You're better than that.\" \"You haven't been mad at me in a long time.\" \"Yeah, well, don't make me do it again.\" \"I don't like it.\" \"Me, neither.\" \"Listen everyone,\" said the speaker, \"This is the big game we've been excited about. New Jersey winner Jack is racing against the Southwestern winner Emma. They've raced before and it won't be the last time. Both cars are ready. This will be a great race. But oh no, Emma started before the green light, which means she loses. So today's winner is Jack.\" The crowd cheered. \"Yes!\" \"All right!\" \"I messed up!\" \"You'll do better next time,\" said Gabriel. \"You drive,\" said the teacher. The class repeated, \"You drive.\" \"We drive.\" \"I drive.\" \"We all drive.\" \"May I?\" \"Sorry.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Thank you.\" \"All right. Let's start again.\" The speaker said, \"This year's race is very close, with only a tiny bit separating the 16 cars. The number one driver is very good...\" \"Hey, can you set the tool for me?\" \"Gabriel!\" \"Gabriel.\" \"Who is that, Daddy?\" \"I don't know.\" \"Hello, I'm William. I work for a big car team. And you, you must be Charlotte. Nice to meet you. You know, my daughter is a big fan of Emma's. I can't promise anything, but I've brought some of the big bosses here today, and if Emma impresses them, I might be able to get them to support her.\" They both laughed. \"Really?\" \"Yes, I think we can.\" \"Oh, thank you!\" \"Thank you so much.\" \"You don't know how much this means to us.\" \"You know, I really think Emma has a good chance to win the big race. And my daughter really wants me to do this. So, have a good race today.\" \"Good luck!\" \"Thank you!\" \"Sure!\" \"Thank you again!\" \"Wow!\" \"Don't tell your sister.\" \"She already worries too much.\" \"I know, right?\" \"So cool!\" \"[Excited sound]\" \"Oh my!\" \"Let's go, monkey!\" \"You got it!\" \"That's the one I was talking about.\" \"[Car sound]\" \"The car part is loose!\" \"Stop the game!\" \"Stop the light!\" \"Emma, stop the car.\" \"Dad, it won't stop.\" \"It won't stop!\" \"Okay.\" \"Don't worry.\" \"Dad, I can't stop.\" \"Dad, the car part is stuck!\" \"The car part is stuck!\" \"Okay.\" \"Just keep it straight.\" \"You're going towards the people.\" \"You're going to be okay.\" \"Just hold on.\" \"I'll be right there.\" \"[Siren]\" \"Oh!\" \"[Emma screams]\" \"[People giving orders]\" \"Emma!\" \"Emma...\" \"Emma...\" \"It's okay, honey, it's Daddy.\" \"Daddy!\" \"It's going to be okay.\" \"Hold on.\" \"They're going to lift\" \"They're going to lift you out, ok?\" \"[Moaning]\" \"It's ok.\" \"She's going to be okay.\" \"If it was dangerous, would I let her do it?\" \"Remember saying that?\" \"I do.\" \"Alice, don't.\" \"[Whispering] Don't what?\" \"Don't get upset?\" \"I just saw my daughter crash,\" \"And I don't plan to see that again.\" \"You can go in now.\" \"Mr. and Mrs. Adam...\" \"There's no sign of head injury, no broken bones,\" \"She'll probably be sore for a while,\" \"But she'll be just fine.\" \"You can take her home anytime.\" \"[Sighs]\" \"Thank you very much, doctor.\" \"Thank you.\" \"[Sighs and giggles]\" \"Ouch.\" \"You ok?\" \"Yeah.\" \"I'm ok.\" \"Are you?\" \"Oh!\" \"I'm fine.\" \"I just want to get back to the race.\" \"How's it coming?\" \"The car's okay.\" \"I had to fix the front\" \"And fix the car part back on.\" \"Is it ready to race?\" \"Well, yeah...\" \"Why?\" \"I Can't Choose.\" \"Mom, Dad...\" \"I Want To Go Fast.\" \"Sweetie, The Races Are Done For Today.\" \"Just One More, Please.\" \"Emma, You Just Came From The Hospital.\" \"And I'm Okay.\" \"Please, Mom?\" \"Please, I Need To.\" \"If I Don't Do This Now,\" \"I'll Have Too Much Time To Think\" \"And Next Time I'll Be Really Frightened.\" \"Please, Mom.\" \"Please?\" \"All Right.\" \"You Go Get Ready.\" \"[Car Starts]\" \"[Laughs]\" \"Yes!\" \"Whoo Hoo Hoo!\" \"Whoo!\" \"[Thunder]\" \"[Country Music Playing]\" \"[Music Stops]\" \"So, I Picked The Color I Want.\" \"Bright Red.\" \"What Are You Talking About?\" \"I'm Going To Be In Your Car Group Soon,\" \"So I'll Need A New Car.\" \"You're Going Fast, Aren't You, Sweetie?\" \"Um, Pass The Potato Salad.\" \"It's Just A Few Months From Now.\" \"If Anyone's Getting A New Car, It's Me.\" \"What?\" \"You Can Have My Old One.\" \"Baked Beans.\" \"That's Not Fair!\" \"Why Do I Always Have To Get\" \"The Old Car?\" \"Because You're Younger.\" \"That's How Things Work.\" \"Dad!\" \"Wait.\" \"Nobody's Getting A New Car.\" \"Not Right Now.\" \"But\" \"That's Final!\" \"Uh, Spicy Sauce?\" \"On A Burger?\" \"It's Something Different.\" \"[All Laugh]\" \"[Knocks]\" \"Heh.\" \"Come In.\" \"Good Evening!\" \"Mr. Cameron, Sit Down.\" \"Whoo!\" \"Wow, That Is Some Big Rain.\" \"Cameron:\" \"Of Course, You'll Be In Our Ads,\" \"And We Will Pay For A Big Part Of Your Work Here.\" \"So, What Do You Say, Emma?\" \"Hmm?\" \"How Would You Like Team PZ To Sponsor You?\" \"I'm A Little Wondering About Something, Mr. Cameron.\" \"I Mean, I've Been Doing This For A While,\" \"And I've Got A Lot Of Wins And Things,\" \"And, Well...\" \"Today I Have An Accident\" \"And Suddenly You're Offering Me This?\" \"I'm Kind Of Confused, I Guess.\" \"Look, I Don't Blame You.\" \"I Told Your Dad\" \"That I Hoped You'd Show Me Something Today.\" \"When You--When You Got Back Into That Car,\" \"After What Happened Today...

of you?\" \"Hmm.\" \"You know what?\" \"Why not?\" \"[Both happy sounds]\" \"Gabriel:\" \"Yes!\" \"Ha Ha!\" \"Charlotte:\" \"Thank you, thank you, thank you!\" \"You ask me why I play so hard to get

a big one\" \"I know, Emma.\" \"No, you don't know.\" \"This toy is a lot more fun\" \"Than that little pink toy.\" \"Hey, look at that.\" \"What?\" \"Nice boy.\" \"You have to be serious.\" \"It's play time.\" \"Now, focus!\" \"Grr!\" \"Good luck, honey!\" \"Yes!\" \"Whoo Hoo!\" \"[Crowd cheering]\" \"So, what do you both do when you're not playing?\" \"Any friends?\" \"Well, I'm not allowed to
