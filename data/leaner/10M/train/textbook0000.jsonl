{"text": "Lesson: Frank v. The School Board\n\nIntroduction:\n\nIn this lesson, we will learn about the Frank v. The School Board case, which was about a rule that made teachers say something before teaching about how animals and plants change over time. This case is important because it helps us understand how people think about religion and science in schools.\n\nSection 1: Background Information\n\nThe Frank v. The School Board case was a big argument between moms and dads and the group of people who make rules for the school in TA town, Louisiana. In 1994, the school rule makers made a rule that teachers had to say something before teaching about how animals and plants change over time. They had to say that this idea was just a guess and that it was not proven by science.\n\nSection 2: The Ethan v. Alice Case\n\nIn 1987, the big court of our country said in the case of Ethan v. Alice that teaching about \"how the world was made\" was like teaching religion and so it was against a big rule of our country. This case made a rule for keeping religion and school separate.\n\nSection 3: The Frank v. The School Board Case\n\nIn Frank v. The School Board, moms and dads sued the school rule makers for breaking the big rule of our country. They said that making teachers say something before teaching about how animals and plants change over time was not right because it liked religion more than science. The local court agreed with the moms and dads and said they were right.\n\nSection 4: The Higher Court Ruling\n\nThe school rule makers did not agree with the local court's decision, but the US Court for the FI Circuit said the lower court was right. The higher court said that the rule was against the big rule because it seemed like the school rule makers were liking a certain religious idea.\n\nSection 5: Conclusion\n\nIn the end, the Frank v. The School Board case is an important one because it helps us understand how people think about religion and science in schools. The court said that it is not right for schools to like religion more than science by making teachers say something before teaching about how animals and plants change over time. We can use this lesson in other situations where religion and science might not agree, like in teaching about weather changes or how babies are made.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1961, "idx": 304576, "original text": "Freiler v. Tangipahoa Parish Board of Education\n\nFreiler v. Tangipahoa Parish Board of Education, 185 F.3d 337 (5th Cir. 1999) was United States federal court case on the constitutionality of a policy requiring teachers to read aloud a disclaimer whenever they taught about evolution.\n\nIn 1987 the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in the case of Edwards v. Aguillard (482 U.S. 587) that the teaching of \"creation science\" constituted an establishment of religion and thus violated the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nIn April 1994 the School Board of Tangipahoa, Louisiana, adopted a policy mandating that a disclaimer was to be presented before any discussion of evolutionary biology.  The policy was as follows:\n\nParents sued the school board for violating the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution and won in 1997 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. The schoolboard appealed and the decision was upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit on January 24, 2000.\n\nThe schoolboard then appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, who on June 19, 2000, declined to hear the case in a 6-3 decision, thereby allowing the lower court decision to stand. Three conservative members of the Supreme Court dissented; Antonin Scalia and William Rehnquist, who had also dissented from the decision in Edwards v. Aguillard, were joined by 1991 George H.W.

We will explore the \"MT place\", a place that saves things from resource-based places listed on the \"LO market\" of the \"UK place\". We will also look at some of its smart savings, including the \"TH place\", \"MO place\", \"AR place\", and \"GR place\".\n\n**Section 1: What is a Saving Place?**\n\nA saving place is a business that collects things from many people and uses them to buy stuff, such as toys, books, and gifts. These places manage and use the things they get from people, hoping to grow and earn more for their people. In return, the people share in the goods or bads of the place.\n\n**Section 2: The \"MT Place\"**\n\nThe \"MT place\" is a saving place in the \"UK place\". It saves things from resource-based places listed on the \"LO market\" of the \"UK place\". The place focuses on making direct savings and being involved in these resource-based places.\n\n**Section 3: Smart Savings**\n\nThe \"MT place\" has made several smart savings in resource-based places listed on the \"LO market\". Some of these savings include the \"TH place\", \"MO place\", \"AR place\", and \"GR place\". By saving in these places, the \"MT place\" hopes to benefit from their growth and success.\n\n**Section 4: Ending**\n\nIn this lesson, we have learned about saving places and the \"MT place\", a place that saves things from resource-based places listed on the \"LO market\" of the \"UK place\". We have also looked at some of its smart savings, including the \"TH place\", \"MO place\", \"AR place\", and \"GR place\". By understanding the role of saving places in the market, we can better appreciate the importance of these businesses in our world.\n\n**Simple words:**\n- Saving place: A business that collects things from many people and uses them to buy stuff, such as toys, books, and gifts, with the hope of growing and earning more for their people.\n- \"LO market\": The Little Ones market, a part of the \"UK place\" for smaller, growing places.\n- Resource-based places: Places that work in things related to nature, such as digging, oil and gas, and farming.\n- Smart savings: Savings made by a place in other businesses with the hope of benefiting from their growth and success.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 475, "idx": 150391, "original text": "Metal Tiger Plc is into business of making direct equity investments and taking exposures in resource-based companies quoted on the AIM (Alternative Investment Market) market of the London Stock Exchange.

{"text": "# Lesson: Learning about General Models (GM)\n## Section 1: What is a GM?\nA General Model (GM) is a simple model used to look at the link between a thing we respond to and one or more things that predict it. It is a half-way model that allows for not-straight links between the thing we respond to and things that predict it, while still keeping the simplicity of straight models.\n## Chapter 2: What is a fun game?\nA fun game is made up of parts that work together. Each part shows how two things are connected. We pick these parts because they show the connection really well. These parts can be straight or wiggly, and we can use different ways to put them together to make a game that can show many kinds of connections.\n\n## Chapter 3: Why do we play this fun game?\nFun games are great when the connection between two things is not straight, and when the things we are looking at work together. They are also good when we have too many things to look at for a simple game, or when there are things that don't fit in that would change the results of a simple game. Also, fun games can be used to look at things that happen over time.\n\n## Chapter 4: How do I play this fun game?\nTo play a fun game, you will need to pick the parts that show the connection between the things we are looking at. You will also need to pick the ways we put these parts together. You will also need to pick the things we are looking at and what we are trying to find out, as well as any other things that may be important to the game. Once you have picked these parts, you can play the game using a tool like a computer.\n\n## Chapter 5: Let's try a game\nImagine we have information about how tall people are and how much they weigh. You want to see how height and weight are connected, but you think that the connection may not be straight. To play a fun game, you could change the numbers in a special way to create a part that shows the connection between height and weight. You could then use a way like adding to put this part with other parts that show the connection between height and other things like age, whether they are a boy or girl, and how healthy they are.\n\n## The end\nIn short, fun games are helpful for understanding connections between things that are not straight. They can be played using tools like a computer, and can be used to understand complicated connections in information about things that happen over time. By playing fun games, people can learn about the connections between things that may not be clear with simple games.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 3663, "idx": 177310, "original text": "# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\"\"\"Example for GAM with Poisson Model and PolynomialSmoother\n\nThis example was written as a test case.\nThe data generating process is chosen so the parameters are well identified\nand estimated.\n\nCreated on Fri Nov 04 13:45:43 2011\n\nAuthor: Josef Perktold\n\"\"\"\nfrom statsmodels.compat.python import lrange\nimport time\n\nimport numpy as np\n\nfrom scipy import stats\n\nfrom statsmodels.sandbox.gam import Model as GAM\nfrom statsmodels.genmod.families import family\nfrom statsmodels.genmod.generalized_linear_model import GLM\n\nnp.seterr(all='raise')\nnp.random.seed(8765993)\n#seed is chosen for nice result, not randomly\n#other seeds are pretty off in the prediction or end in overflow\n\n#DGP: simple polynomial\norder = 3\nsigma_noise = 0.1\nnobs = 1000\n#lb, ub = -0.75, 3#1.5#0.75 #2.5\nlb, ub = -3.5, 3\nx1 = np.linspace(lb, ub, nobs)\nx2 = np.sin(2*x1)\nx = np.column_stack((x1/x1.max()*1, 1.*x2))\nexog = (x[:,:,None]**np.arange(order+1)[None, None, :]).reshape(nobs, -1)\nidx = lrange((order+1)*2)\ndel idx[order+1]\nexog_reduced = exog[:,idx]  #remove duplicate constant\ny_true = exog.sum(1) #/ 4.\nz = y_true #alias check\nd = x\ny = y_true + sigma_noise * np.random.randn(nobs)\n\nexample = 3\n\nif example == 2:\n    print(\"binomial\")\n    f = family.Binomial()\n    mu_true = f.link.inverse(z)\n    #b = np.asarray([scipy.stats.bernoulli.rvs(p) for p in f.link.inverse(y)])\n    b = np.asarray([stats.bernoulli.rvs(p) for p in f.link.inverse(z)])\n    b.shape = y.shape\n    m = GAM(b, d, family=f)\n    toc = time.time()\n    m.fit(b)\n    tic = time.time()\n    print(tic-toc)\n    #for plotting\n    yp = f.link.inverse(y)\n    p = b\n\n\nif example == 3:\n    print(\"Poisson\")\n    f = family.Poisson()\n    #y = y/y.max() * 3\n    yp = f.link.inverse(z)\n    p = np.asarray([stats.poisson.rvs(val) for val in f.link.inverse(z)],\n                   float)\n    p.shape = y.shape\n    m = GAM(p, d, family=f)\n    toc = time.time()\n    m.fit(p)\n    tic = time.time()\n    print(tic-toc)\n\nfor ss in m.smoothers:\n    print(ss.params)\n\nif example > 1:\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n    plt.figure()\n    for i in np.array(m.history[2:15:3]):\n        plt.plot(i.T)\n\n    plt.figure()\n    plt.plot(exog)\n    #plt.plot(p, '.', lw=2)\n    plt.plot(y_true, lw=2)\n\n    y_pred = m.results.mu # + m.results.alpha #m.results.predict(d)\n    plt.figure()\n    plt.subplot(2,2,1)\n    plt.plot(p, '.')\n    plt.plot(yp, 'b-', label='true')\n    plt.plot(y_pred, 'r-', label='GAM')\n    plt.legend(loc='upper left')\n    plt.title('gam.GAM Poisson')\n\n    counter = 2\n    for ii, xx in zip(['z', 'x1', 'x2'], [z, x[:,0], x[:,1]]):\n        sortidx = np.argsort(xx)\n        #plt.figure()\n        plt.subplot(2, 2, counter)\n        plt.plot(xx[sortidx], p[sortidx], 'k.', alpha=0.5)\n        plt.plot(xx[sortidx], yp[sortidx], 'b.', label='true')\n        plt.plot(xx[sortidx], y_pred[sortidx], 'r.', label='GAM')\n        plt.legend(loc='upper left')\n        plt.title('gam.GAM Poisson ' + ii)\n        counter += 1\n\n    res = GLM(p, exog_reduced, family=f).fit()\n\n    #plot component, compared to true component\n    x1 = x[:,0]\n    x2 = x[:,1]\n    f1 = exog[:,:order+1].sum(1) - 1 #take out constant\n    f2 = exog[:,order+1:].sum(1) - 1\n    plt.figure()\n    #Note: need to correct for constant which is indeterminatedly distributed\n    #plt.plot(x1, m.smoothers[0](x1)-m.smoothers[0].params[0]+1, 'r')\n    #better would be subtract f(0) m.smoothers[0](np.array([0]))\n    plt.plot(x1, f1, linewidth=2)\n    plt.plot(x1, m.smoothers[0](x1)-m.smoothers[0].params[0], 'r')\n\n    plt.figure()\n    plt.plot(x2, f2, linewidth=2)\n    plt.plot(x2, m.smoothers[1](x2)-m.smoothers[1].params[0], 'r')\n\n\n    plt.show()\n", "hash": "1e7b48936bfde14d5fddf38a07b42f5f8a6a4d02b50816fc0ec2ef091e378296"}
{"text": "Story Title: Getting to Know Number Tags and Toy Descriptions\n\nLet's Start:\nNumber tags are special numbers found on toys in shops. They tell us about the toy, like its name, cost, and who made it. In this story, we will learn about number tags and toy descriptions.\n\nPart 1: Getting to Know Number Tags\n\nTopic 1: What is a number tag?\nA number tag is a 12-number code found on most toys in shops. It tells us about the toy, like its name, cost, and who made it.\n\nTopic 2: What makes up a number tag?\nA number tag is made up of two parts: the first six numbers and the last six numbers. The first six numbers tell us who made the toy. The last six numbers tell us about the specific toy the maker made.\n\nTopic 3: How can we know the cost from the number tag?\nThe cost of the toy can be found in the last number of the last six numbers. If the number is not even, the cost ends in 99 cents. If the number is even, the cost ends in 98 cents.\n\nTopic 4: How can we know who made the toy from the number tag?\nThe first six numbers of the number tag tell us who made the toy. These numbers are different for each toy maker and are given by a big group that manages the number tag system.\n\nPart 2: Reading Toy Descriptions\n\nTopic 1: What can I learn from a toy description?\nA toy description is a story that tells us about the toy's features. It usually includes information like the toy's name, brand, size, color, and what it's made of.\n\nTopic 2: Where can I find the toy description?\nThe toy description is usually found on the toy's box or on the shop's website. You can also find it by searching for the toy's name.\n\nTopic 3: Why should I read the toy description?\nReading the toy description helps you learn about the toy, what it does, and if it's what you want. It also helps you choose between different toys and decide which toy to buy.\n\nThe End:\nIn this story, we learned about number tags and toy descriptions. By knowing about number tags and what they tell us about the toy, we can use them to know who made the toy, its cost, and other details. We also learned how to read and understand toy descriptions to know about the toy's features. By using these skills, we can choose the right toys for us.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 945, "idx": 337038, "original text": "UPC 900000280690 Levenhuk 28069 Zoom 8-24 mm Eyepiece 1 Pack\n\nUPC 900000280690\n\nLevenhuk 28069 Zoom 8-24 mm Eyepiece 1 Pack\n\nBarcode of UPC 900000280690\n\nProduct Name: Levenhuk 28069 Zoom 8-24 mm Eyepiece 1 Pack\n\nUPC 900000280690\n\nDescription : Varied focal length eyepiece, for any telescope.

{"text": "Lesson: Understanding Game Finishes\n\nIntroduction:\nGame finishes are very important in a game of chess. They help to decide who wins or loses the game. In this lesson, we are going to learn about game finishes that come from quiet starts. We will talk about these topics:\n\nI. Kinds of Game Finishes from Quiet Starts\nII. Ideas and Ways to Play in Finishes\nIII. Real Examples\nIV. Talk About it Yourself\nV. Ending Thoughts\nVI. Word List\n\nI. Kinds of Game Finishes from Quiet Starts\n\nQuiet starts are when pieces are moved to their first spots without moving any small soldiers. Some quiet starts are the IT country Game, the Ruy Lopez, and the Scotch Game. The game finishes that come from these starts can be grouped into two kinds:\n\n1. King and Small Soldier vs. King Finishes: These finishes happen when there is a different number of small soldiers on the board. The side with the extra small soldier (or soldiers) is usually the one that has less stuff. The goal of the player with the extra small soldier(s) is to turn it (them) into a queen, while the player with the king tries to stop the small soldier(s) from becoming a queen.\n\n2. King and Small Soldier vs. King and Small Soldier Finishes: These finishes happen when both sides have the same number of small soldiers. The side with the small soldier on the sixth line has a little advantage, as they can turn their small soldier into a queen, while the other side's small soldier cannot.\n\nII. Ideas and Ways to Play in Finishes\n\nIn game finishes that come from quiet starts, the ideas and ways to play depend on the small soldier formation and the middle strategy used by both players. Some common ideas are:\n\n1. The attacking side should try to make a passed small soldier, which can be used to queenside or centerside.\n\n2. The defending side should try to make a counterplay by stopping the small soldier's move forward or by going after the other player's king.\n\n3. Both sides should look for ways to make their pieces more active, either by making discovered attacks or by controlling more squares.\n\nIV. Real Examples\n\nLet's look at this example:\n\nBoard 1: White starts with 1.e4. Black answers with 1...e5.\n\nBoard 2: White plays 2.Nf3, and Black answers with 2...Nc6.\n\nBoard 3: White plays 3.Bb5. Black says 3...a6.\n\nBoard 4: White plays 4.Ba4, and Black says 4...Nf6.\n\nAt this point, both players have finished setting up their pieces, and they are ready to start the middlegame. But, if the game goes on, it might end up in a game finish with the following small soldier structure:\n\nIn this game, White has a king's pawn, while Black has a queen's pawn. White should try to turn their pawn into a queen, while Black should try to stop the pawn from becoming a queen.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWhat are some ideas and game methods that White should use in a game from a closed start? How can Black stop these ideas?\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, learning games is important for winning games. By studying the games that start from closed starts, players can learn useful ideas and game methods that work best in these situations. This knowledge will help them use these strategies in new games and get better at playing.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 821, "idx": 275230, "original text": "Mastering the Endgames VII: Endgames Arosomg from Closed Openings. - List Price: $24.95. - Binding: Paperback. - Publisher: MacMillan Publishing Company.. - Publish date: 01/01/2006.

{"text": "Lesson: How to Look for Things\n\nIntroduction:\nIn our world today, we can find things easily. But, finding the right things can sometimes be hard. This lesson will teach you how to look for things in a good way.\n\nSection 1: Understanding How to Look\n\nTopic 1: Knowing What You Need\n- Before you start looking for things, you need to know what kind of things you need. This could include why you are looking, the type of things you are looking for, and any special things you need.\n- Once you know what you need, you can start looking for things that meet those needs.\n\nTopic 2: Picking the Right Tools to Look\n- There are many tools to look, like GO company, Bing, and special databases. Each tool to look has good and bad things, so it's important to pick the right one for your needs.\n- For example, if you are looking for school articles, you might want to use a database like JS or PM instead of a common tool to look like GO company.\n\nTopic 3: Checking What You Find\n- Once you find some things, you need to check them to see if they are good and right for your needs.\n- Look for clues like who wrote it, when it was written, and where the thing came from.\n\nSection 2: Ways to Look\n\nTopic 1: Using Key Words\n- Key words are the words or things you say that you use to look for things.\n- To find the most right things, you should use key words that are clear and related to what you need.\n\nTopic 2: Using Special Words\n- Special words are words that you use to make your look better and more clear.\n- Some common special words include \"AND,\" \"OR,\" and \"NOT.\"\n\nTopic 3: Using Filters\n- Filters are things that you can use to make your look results only show certain types of things.\n- For example, you could use filters to make your look results only show school articles or only things written in the last year.\n\nPart 3: Using Smart Thinking Skills\n\nTheme 1: Asking Stuff\n- Asking stuff is a key part of looking for things.\n- You should ask stuff like \"What do I want to find?\" and \"How do I know if what I find is good?\"\n\nTheme 2: Looking at Stuff\n- Once you find stuff, you need to look at it to see if it is right and useful for what you need.\n- Look for hints like who made it, when it was made, and where it comes from.\n\nTheme 3: Mixing Stuff Together\n- Mixing stuff together means taking stuff from many places to make a new thing.\n- This is a very important skill today, where stuff is often shown in small bits and pieces.\n\nEnding:\nIn this part, we learned how to find stuff in a good way. By knowing what stuff we need, picking the right tools to find stuff, looking at what we find, and using smart thinking skills, we can find the stuff we need to do well in our own lives and jobs.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 964, "idx": 370598, "original text": "Where.

{"text": "Lesson: How to Look at Storybooks\n\nIntroduction:\nIn our fast and fun world, it's good to know how to look at storybooks well. This skill is not just for knowing what's happening, but also for talking about it and making choices. In this lesson, we will learn how to look at storybooks by looking at a sample book.\n\nSection 1: Understanding the Book\n\nTitle: All the Silly Stuff That Isn't Good to Write\n\nThe title tells us that the writer is talking about something that's not good to write. This could mean that the book has wrong things or it's not something the readers want to know about.\n\nStory: If Benjamin wins the big race, his friend to help will be very important. I've been thinking about who could help (I know, thinking a lot) and have thought if Hannah might not be the best friend.\n\nThe writer is guessing about who Benjamin might choose as his friend to help if he wins the big race. They say that Hannah might be a good friend, even though it's not the usual way to pick a friend to help.\n\nSection 2: Looking at the Book\n\n1. Who are the people the book is for?\nThe people who the book is for are probably those who are interested in races and follow the news about races.\n\n2. What is the main thing the book talks about?\nThe main thing the book talks about is that Hannah might be a good friend for Benjamin to help him, even though it's not the usual way to pick a friend to help.\n\n3. What things does the writer show to make us believe what they're saying?\nThe writer doesn't show any real things to make us believe what they're saying. Instead, they just guess and think that picking Hannah would protect from possible troubles.\n\n4. How does the book sound?\nThe book sounds a bit funny and mysterious, suggesting that the writer thinks there are \"silly people\" out there who would target Benjamin and that Hannah being there would stop them.\n\nSection 3: Using the Skills\n\nNow that we have looked at the book, let's use our skills for a different book. Imagine you are reading a book about how to fix a toy. How would you look at it?\n\n1. Who are the people the book is for?\nThe people who the book is for are probably those who are interested in fixing toys.\n\n2. What is the main thing the book talks about?\nThe main thing the book talks about is that the current toy is broken and needs to be fixed.\n\n3. What things does the writer show to make us believe what they're saying?\nThe writer may show how the toy is broken, how to fix it, and what it looks like after to make us believe what they're saying.\n\n4. How does the book sound?\nThe book's sound may change depending on who wrote it, but it could be from telling us something to trying to convince us.\n\nConclusion:\nIn this class, we learned how to look at stories about people making decisions by looking at a story. We practiced finding out who the story is for, what the story is saying, and how the story is saying it, and used these skills on a pretend story about people getting help when they are sick. By learning these skills, we can better understand and join in conversations.\n\nWords to know:\n- Who the story is for: the group of people that a story is meant for\n- What the story is saying: what a story is trying to tell us\n- How the story is saying it: the way the person telling the story feels about what they are telling us\n- Facts: things that are true used to help tell a story", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 953, "idx": 396492, "original text": "All of the nonsense that isn't fit to print..

{"text": "**Lesson: Learning About House Buying**\n\n**Section 1: What is House Buying?**\n\nHouse buying is when you buy a house to make money. It involves buying, looking after, and selling houses to earn money. This can be done through rent money, selling houses for more money than you bought them for, or keeping a house for a long time until it's worth more.\n\n**Section 2: Why Buy Houses?**\n\nThere are several reasons why people buy houses. Some of these reasons include:\n- Money Flow: Houses that people rent can give a steady flow of money each month.\n- Worth More: The value of houses tends to go up over time, giving a chance for more money.\n- Money Help: Buyers can get help with things like house loan interest, house taxes, and other costs.\n- Mix It Up: Buying houses can help mix up a buyer's money, making the overall risk less.\n\n**Section 3: Kinds of Houses to Buy**\n\nThere are several kinds of houses you can buy, including:\n- Houses for Living: Single houses, row houses, small buildings, and big buildings.\n- Houses for Work: Office buildings, shops, big buildings, and hotels.\n- Land: Empty spaces, farm lands, and untouched lands.\nBig Buildings: Some companies own and operate buildings that make money.\n## Part 4: Problems with Owning Buildings\nOwning buildings can come with problems. Some of these problems include:\n- Changes: The price of buildings can go up and down. This can be a problem if someone needs to sell the building when the price is low.\n- Empty: Sometimes, buildings can be empty for a long time. This means no money is made and expenses can go up.\n- Taking Care: Buildings need to be looked after and fixed, which can take a lot of time and money.\n## Part 5: Ending\nOwning buildings can be a good way to make money and become rich. However, it also comes with problems. By knowing about owning buildings and being aware of possible problems, people can make smart choices and be successful.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 983, "idx": 427082, "original text": "Listings By Nancy Yang.

{"text": "Lesson: Different Cultures and Their Impact on the Food World\n\nIntroduction:\nDifferent cultures mean different kinds of people in a group. This includes different colors, languages, beliefs, and ways of life. In recent years, different cultures have become very important in shaping the food world. This lesson will talk about how different cultures are changing the food world and how businesses can use this to do better.\n\nSection 1: Why Different Cultures are Important in the Food World\n\nTopic 1: More Cultures in One Place\nMore cultures in one place means different cultures living together in a group. In many places, more cultures have been growing because of more people moving and the world becoming closer. This has made more people want different food items that are liked by different cultures.\n\nTopic 2: The Wish for Something Different\nPeople today want something different when it comes to food. They want to try new and fun tastes and meals that they may not have in their own culture. Different cultures in the food world give this chance for people to try new meals and tastes.\n\nTopic 3: The Effect of Different Cultures on Selling Products\nThe food world is very competitive, and businesses must find ways to be different. One way to do this is by using different cultures in selling products. By understanding what different cultural groups like, businesses can create targeted selling plans that connect with their audience.\n\nSection 2: The \"Three S's\" Rule for Selling Products Well\nIn this section, we will talk about the \"Three S's\" rule for selling products well, which was talked about in the talk show with Sarah.\n\nTopic 1: Breaking Up\nBreaking up means splitting a market into smaller groups based on things they share like age, gender, money, and cultural background. By breaking up the market, businesses can create targeted selling plans that appeal to specific cultural groups.\n\nTopic 2: Aiming\nAiming means finding out the needs and wants of a certain part of the market and creating selling messages that address those needs and wants. By understanding the cultural likes of different groups, businesses can create targeted selling messages that connect with their audience.\n\nTopic 3: Placing\nPlacing means creating a unique picture or identity for a product in the minds of people. By understanding the cultural values and likes of different groups, businesses can place their products as unique and appealing to specific cultural audiences.\n\nSection 3: Real Examples and Real-World Situations\nIn this section, we will talk about real examples and real-world situations of how businesses can use different cultures in their selling efforts.\n\nExample 1: A food maker that makes a range of ethnic foods could break up their market based on cultural background and create targeted selling plans for each group. For example, they could create a plan that talks about the real ingredients and tastes of their IN country food products to appeal to IN country people.\n\nExample 2: A food shop chain could make itself a place for brave eaters by having a menu with new and different tastes from many places. They could make ads that talk about the many different tastes and foods you can get at their shops to attract people who want a special eating time.\n\nEnd part:\nDifferent cultures are changing how we make food, and shops that know and use this change will do well. By dividing the market, focusing on certain cultural groups, and making their products different and interesting, businesses can make successful product ads that their customers like.\n\nWord list:\n- Different cultures: Having different cultures in a place\n- Dividing: The act of breaking a market into smaller groups based on what they share\n- Focusing: The act of finding out what a certain group of the market needs and wants and making ads that talk to those needs and wants\n- Making different: The act of making a product have a special image or identity for customers\n\n[Note: This lesson can be changed for young to older students by changing the detail and difficulty of the content, examples, and exercises.]", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 8, "len": 974, "idx": 223416, "original text": "How is cultural diversity changing the industry? with Sarah Wangler of Sweet Marketing Success.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning about Barcode Scanning\n## Part 1: What is a Barcode?\nA barcode is a picture that a machine can read. It is usually a group of lines that are different widths and spaces apart. These lines are read by a barcode reader, which changes the picture into signals that a computer can understand.\n## Part 2: How does a Barcode Reader work?\nA barcode reader uses a light, like a laser or LED, to look at the barcode and read the line pattern. The reader then changes the line pattern into a number value, which can be used to know what an item or product is.\n## Part 3: Why use Barcode Scanning?\nWe use barcode scanning to make recording and keeping track of items faster. By using barcodes, items can be looked at quickly and correctly, making the time and work needed to write down item records by hand less. Barcode scanning also reduces the chance of mistakes, as the reader can see if an item is not scanned correctly, and can fix any mistakes by itself.\n## Part 4: Types of Barcode Readers\nThere are two main types of barcode readers: handheld and fixed. Handheld readers can be moved around and can be used to look at barcodes from far away, making them good for managing items. Fixed readers stay in one place and are usually used in shops to look at items when they are being bought.\n## Part 5: How to Borrow Barcode Scanning Tools\nIf you need barcode scanning tools for a one-time event or for a short time, you can borrow the tools from a good borrowing company. You need to tell the company what kind of barcode reader you want, how long you want to use it, and where you are. The company will give you a price for using it. You can say yes or no to this price.\n## Simple Words:\n- Barcode: A picture that machines can read. It looks like many lines that are close together or far apart.\n- Barcode Reader: A thing that looks at the barcode and tells the computer what it means.\n- Keeping Track of Things: Knowing what things you have and where they are.\n- The Place Where You Buy Things: Where you pay for what you want to buy.\n## The End:\nReading barcodes is good for keeping track of things. It is fast and makes fewer mistakes. If you understand barcodes and how to use a barcode reader, you can use them in your work.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 875, "idx": 125292, "original text": "Need a 700?

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Tech Toys\n\n### Introduction\n\nLearning about tech toys can be lots of fun, but it requires careful thinking and a good understanding of the toy world. In this lesson, we will explore what makes some tech toys successful or not, and talk about how to understand their potential as fun toys.\n\n### Section 1: Understanding the Toy World\n\nThe toy world is always changing, with new toys being introduced quickly. This makes it important for kids to stay updated with the latest toy trends. Some key things to consider when looking at a tech toy include:\n\n1. Market Size: How many people the toy is made for is an important thing to think about. A toy made for a lot of kids means there is more chance for it to be fun and popular.\n\n2. Competition: How many other similar toys are there can also affect a toy's success. A toy with no similar toys might have an easier time becoming popular, but it might also face challenges in becoming liked by many kids.\n\n3. Innovation: Tech toys that are able to come up with new ideas and introduce new toys are often successful. However, this can also be tricky, as toys that rely too much on a single type of toy may struggle if that toy becomes old-fashioned.\n\n4. Management Team: The team of people who make the toy can have a big effect on its success. Skilled and capable leaders can help guide the toy through tough times and make smart decisions that help the toy.\n\n5. Toy Model: The way a tech toy works is also an important thing to consider. Toys that rely on a single way of having fun may be vulnerable to changes in that type of fun, while those with different ways of having fun may be better for long-term play.\n\n### Section 2: Evaluating Potential Toys\n\nOnce you have a good understanding of the toy world and what makes a toy successful, it's time to start evaluating potential toys. Here are some important questions to ask when considering a tech toy:\n\n1. What makes the toy special? Is it unique technology, a cool design, or a lot of loyal fans?\n\n2. How does the toy plan to improve and get better? Does it have a clear plan for becoming more fun or introducing new ways of playing?\n\n3. How well is the toy doing? Is it popular, and does it have a good history of being liked?\n\n4. How much is the toy worth? Is it more or less expensive than similar toys, and does that make sense given how popular it is and how much fun it can be?\n\n5. What are the risks associated with the toy? Are there any possible problems that could affect the toy's fun, such as new rules or changing toy trends?\n\n### Part 3: Examples from Life\n\nTo understand the things we learned in this lesson, let's look at some examples of tech teams that did really well and some that didn't do as well.\n\n1. Adam: Adam's team is a great example of a team that used new ideas and a strong name to become one of the most important teams in the world. People really want their things, and the team leaders have made good choices that helped the team.\n\n2. Benjamin: Benjamin's team was once a leader in the phone market, but had trouble keeping up with new phones and systems from other teams like Adam's and Gabriel's. They lost many customers, and the team had to stop making hardware and focus on software and safety.\n\n3. Nathan: Nathan's team was once a big player in the mobile phone market, but had trouble changing when smartphones became popular. They tried to compete in this area but didn't succeed, and the team was joined by Matthew's team.\n\n### The End\n\nInvesting in tech teams can be a good way to make money, but you have to be careful and understand the industry well. By thinking about things like market size, competition, new ideas, team leaders, and business model, and asking important questions about a team's competitive edge, growth plan, and financial health, investors can make smart decisions about which tech teams are likely to do well. But remember, even the most promising investments have risks, so it's important to carefully think about these risks before making any investment decisions.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 619, "idx": 347386, "original text": "As the PC market continues to decline, investors need to shift out of some old standards and learn some new tunes, Dan Niles of AlphaOne Capital Partners said Tuesday on CNBC..

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Team Effectiveness\n\n## Part 1: Learning Concepts\nTeam effectiveness is about a team's ability to reach its goals. It's a field that uses ideas from different areas like management, psychology, society, and economics. Studying team effectiveness is about understanding how teams work, how they can do better, and how they can adapt when things change.\n\n## Part 2: Real Examples\nOne real example of team effectiveness is a team's ability to use a new tech system. The team might have goals to work better and faster, but if the tech system doesn't fit with the team's culture and processes, it might not reach these goals. Team effectiveness needs a whole approach that thinks about the team's structure, culture, and processes.\n\nAnother example is a health team that wants to make patients better while spending less money. To reach this goal, the team must look at its current practices, find areas to do better, and make changes that will lead to better results. Team effectiveness is not just about making changes but also making sure these changes last over time.\n\n## Part 3: Examples from Life\nA real-life situation where team effectiveness is important is when a team merges with or is bought by another team. During this process, the team must bring together two different cultures, processes, and systems while still reaching its overall goals. Doing things right needs good thinking and doing to make sure that joining things together makes things better and stronger.\n\n## Words to learn\n- Doing Things Right: When a group can do what it wants to do.\n- Full Look: Looking at everything about a problem or situation.\n- Lasting: Being able to stay good or strong for a long time.\n\n## Ending\nKnowing about doing things right is very important for anyone who wants to work in or lead a group. By learning about this, you can know how to make a group better, change when things around you change, and make a habit of always getting better. The things you learn from studying how to do things right can be used in many jobs and places, making it a good thing to learn for anyone who wants to have a job in business or being a leader.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 872, "idx": 34022, "original text": "History of the Organizational Effectiveness Lecture Series.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Plant Oil\n\n**Overview:** This lesson will tell kids about plant oil, its good sides, and how it is made. We will talk about the basics of plant growing, the making process, and the need for checking.\n\n**Objective:** By the end of this lesson, kids will be able to:\n\n- Tell what plant oil is and talk about its good sides\n- Talk about the process of plant growing and making\n- Know the need for checking to make sure the product is good\n\n**Section 1: What is Plant Oil?**Section 1: What is Plant Oil?**\n\nPlant oil is a liked product from the plant. It has a part that can make us feel better without making us feel strange. These good sides include feeling less worried, feeling less pain, and sleeping better.\n\n**Section 2: How is Plant Oil Made?**Section 2: How is Plant Oil Made?**\n\nPlant oil is made by getting the part from the plant. This is done through a way called the bubble method. In this way, bubbles are used to get the part from the plant. The bubbles are then taken away, leaving behind only the plant oil.\n\n**Section 3: Plant Growing and Making**\n\nPlant growing means growing plants in big fields. These plants have low levels of the strange feeling part, making them okay to grow in most places. Once the plants are picked, they go through a process called making to get the part from the plant.\n\n**Section 4: Checking**\n\nChecking is a needed step to make sure the plant oil is good and safe. This means sending bits of the product to a place for checking. The place looks for bad things like bugs, heavy stuff, and yucky things.

You would look for a good brand that uses clean plants and does checking. You would also want to make sure that the product has at least 20% of the part, which is the normal for good products.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn this lesson, we learned about plant oil, its good sides, and how it is made.

The BS program has over 30 different courses in subjects like math, science, social studies, and languages.\n\n## Section 2: Real Life Examples\n\nOne of the best things about the BS program is that kids who do well in a BS course and test may get big kid school credit or get to skip some big kid school courses. This means that kids can possibly save on costs by getting credit for courses they would have to take in big kid school otherwise. For instance, if a kid takes the BS Math test and gets a 4 or 5, they might get to skip the first part of big kid school math and start with a harder course.\n\n## Section 3: Talking to Yourself\n\nThe BS program is made to challenge kids and get them ready for big kid school work. But, some people say that the program puts too much pressure on kids and that it is not always open to all kids. For example, some schools may not have BS courses in certain subjects or may not have enough things to offer many BS courses at all. Plus, the cost of taking the BS test can be too much for some families.

{"text": "Story: Protecting the Big Water and Blue Towns\nBeginning:\nThe big water covers 70% of the Earth and is really important. It helps our weather, gives us food, and lets us play. But sometimes, people make it dirty, catch too many fish, and hurt the places where sea animals live. This makes the big water and the animals in it sick. To help, some people started something called \"Blue Towns\". This means they want to keep the big water healthy when they plan and build towns.\nImportant Idea:\nThe important idea of this story is that we need to protect the big water. Towns can help by being careful and doing things that don't hurt the big water.\nStory Parts:\nI. Learning about Protecting the Big Water\n- What protecting the big water means\n- Why the big water and its animals are important\n- How people can hurt the big water\n- How towns can help keep the big water healthy\nII.

Talking Together\n- How can we get more people to help protect the big water?\n- What are some ways that towns can be nicer to the big water and its animals?\nVI. Real Stories\n- A Blue Towns project could be building a fish house in a park. The fish house would have local sea animals and tell people why protecting the big water is important.\n- Another story is about people who fish carefully. By choosing the right tools and not catching too many fish, they can keep the sea animals healthy and still have food.\nVII. Ending\nIn the end, this story has told us why protecting the big water is important. Towns can help by thinking about the big water when they plan and build.

Picture lines are often used in money matters, learning about people and places, and guessing the weather.\n\nHow to find common points in picture lines?\nTo find common points in picture lines, we need to do these things:\n\n1. Make a picture table with a time point from the start picture to the end picture of the picture line.\n2. Connect each picture line thing to its own time point.\n3. Use full cases to take out things that don't share a common point.\n4.

{"text": "Story: Learning about Lights that Glow\n\n### Part 1: What are Lights that Glow?\nLights that glow, also called glowy lights, are a type of light that uses special stuff to make light. They work by putting tiny bits of electricity into a special layer, which then come together and make light. Glowy lights are used in many things, like screens, small devices, and lamps.\n\n### Part 2: How does a Light Sandwich Work?\nA light sandwich has a thin piece of special stuff in the middle and two plates on each side, one plate is see-through. When we put power into the sandwich, little power bits go into the special stuff from one plate and make holes from the other plate. These power bits move through the special stuff and meet at a spot. This meeting gives off energy as tiny light pieces, which are collected by the see-through plate and shine out as light.\n\n### Part 3: Why is a Light Sandwich Helpful?\nLight sandwiches have many good things about them compared to old light-making things. They can be see-through, bendy, and thin, which makes them good for many uses. They also use less power than old TVs or computer screens, which makes them save energy. Plus, light sandwiches can give off bright, beautiful colors and can be used to make bendy or curvy screens.\n\n### Part 4: Uses of Light Sandwiches\nLight sandwiches are used in many ways, like:\n\n1. Flat screens: Light sandwiches are used in TVs, computer screens, and phones to make good-looking, power-saving pictures.\n2. Lights: Light sandwiches are used in lights that give off bright, power-saving, and long-lasting light.\n3. Portable things: Light sandwiches are used in things you can carry like phones and tablets to make good-looking, power-saving screens.\n4. Cars: Light sandwiches are used in car screens, like on the dash and instruments, to make bright, power-saving screens.\n5. Things you can wear: Light sandwiches are used in things you can wear like smartwatches and fitness trackers to make small, power-saving screens.\n\n### Part 5: The End\nLight sandwiches are a helpful and useful thing that can be used in many ways. They have many good things about them compared to old light-making things, like saving energy, being see-through, bendy, and can give off bright, beautiful colors. By understanding how light sandwiches work and their uses, we can use their good things to make new and fun things.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 3730, "idx": 443882, "original text": "1. Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to an organic electroluminescent element (hereinafter referred to as an organic EL element) capable of inducing luminescence by the recombination of an electron and a hole when they are injected into an organic compound layer of the EL element.\n2. Discussion of Background\nIn recent years, in line with the trend toward diversification of information processing equipment and space-saving for location of such equipment, there is an increasing demand for a plans display element which can be operated with a low electric power and occupies a small space as compared with the cathode ray tube (CRT) display. A liquid crystal has been already proposed as such a plane display element, but much attention has been paid to an organic EL element of a self-emitting type because the EL element can indicate the information clearly and can be driven with a direct-current low voltage system.\nA luminescent layer of the organic EL element is of a single-layered type, or a laminated type which comprises a carrier transporting layer and a luminescent layer. The luminance of the laminated luminescent layer is higher than that of the single-layered one. The above-mentioned carrier transporting layer for use in the laminated luminescent layer serves to transport a hole or an electron.\nA variety of triphenylamine compounds, which have been developed for an organic electrophotographic photoconductor, are proved to be usable as materials for transporting the hole (hereinafter referred to as hole transporting materials) Some of them are found to have relatively high thermal stability in the amorphous condition.\nOn the other hand, some of oxadiazole compounds, triazole compounds and peryleneimide compounds are know as electron-transporting materials, but there are few compounds that have no absorption in the visible region. Further, the electron-transporting materials with high thermal stability are very rare among the above-mentioned compounds.\nFrom the viewpoint of the layer structure of the EL element, the organic EL element comprising an electron-transporting layer has the advantages that various hole transporting materials can be selected for a luminescent layer, an exciton can be trapped in the small luminescent layer, and the deactivation of the exciton caused by the mutual action between the exciton and a cathode can be prevented. Thus, the organic EL element with a high luminance can be obtained using a variety of luminescent materials with different fluorescent colors. However, because the conventional electron-transporting materials do not have high stability, the durability of the conventional EL element comprising the electron-transporting layer is regarded as poor.\nFor instance, there is known an organic EL element using an oxadiazole compound as a luminescent material and electron-transporting material, as stated in \"Nippon Kagaku Kaishi 1991, (11), pages 1540-1548\". However, the problem of the film stability of the above-mentioned oxadiazole compound for use in the EL element remains unsolved, so that there is no organic EL element that shows high luminance and high reliability at the present stage.\nIt is considered that the poor film stability of the oxadiazole compound results from the crystallization thereof Some of the conventional oxadiazole compounds cannot be made into an amorphous film, and others can be formed into an amorphous film, but the amorphous film thus formed induces crystallization during a long period of storage. Therefore, there is an increasing demand for an organic EL element employing an electron-transporting material which has good film-forming properties and does not easily induce crystallization.", "hash": "ed57ddee8d48a764b1650a803367d98ef919f9f42467070fe98e62dc1afa1f38"}

This way is helpful in finding things that should not be there. We will talk about the hard parts of this way and how our new method solves these hard parts.\n\n**Core Value**\nThe big idea of this lesson is to understand why it's important to find unwanted stuff. This is very important when we want to find things that should not be there. If we can predict this well, we can find these things early and treat them.\n\n**Section 1: Understanding How to Find Things That Should Not Be There**\nFinding things that should not be there is a safe way to find things we do not want. It works by sending out waves and measuring the waves that bounce back. These bounced back waves are then used to create a picture of the thing. But, one hard part of this way is the unwanted stuff, which is caused by waves bouncing off other things.\n\n**Section 2: Solving Hard Parts with Unwanted Stuff**\nTo solve the hard part of unwanted stuff, a new way has been suggested that finds and points out the source of a response. This way involves predicting when the response will arrive. By predicting this well, the method can tell apart the response and the unwanted stuff.\n\n**Section 3: Using the Way**\nThe suggested way involves the following steps:\n\n1. Sending out waves and measuring the waves that bounce back.\n2. Using the bounced back waves to create a picture of the thing.\n3. Finding the response by looking at the picture.\n4. Predicting when the response will arrive.\n5. Pointing out the source of the response based on when it arrives.\n6. Telling apart the response and the unwanted stuff based on when the response arrives.\n\n**Section 4: Conclusion**\nIn conclusion, predicting when the response will arrive is a very important way in finding things that should not be there. By predicting this well, the method can tell apart the response and the unwanted stuff, leading to early finding and treatment of the things we do not want. This way can help a lot by finding things we do not want early.\n\n**Words to Know**\n- Unwanted stuff: Parts of the waves that come from things other than the response.\n- Bump answer: The bounce of invisible heat waves from the bump.\n- When-it-comes: The time it takes for the bounced signal to get to the catcher.\n- Step by step guide: A group of steps or rules used to solve a problem.\n- Picture change: The change of digital pictures using computer step by step guides.\n\n**Chatting about it**\n1. How does the presence of mess affect the rightness of invisible heat wave pictures?\n2. What are some ways to clean up the mess in invisible heat wave pictures?\n3.

This story will talk about the problems these kids might have and how we can help them get ready for the big world.\n\nPart 1: Problems for Kids with Special Needs when Moving to the Big World\n\nSubject 1: Not enough places to go after School\nOne of the biggest problems for kids with special needs is that there might not be enough places for them to go after they finish school. Lots of big schools might not have the right things to help kids with special needs, which means these kids might not get to go to school after they finish regular school.\n\nSubject 2: Not enough help\nAnother tricky thing for kids who need more help is that they might not get the help they need. A lot of kids need extra help to do well in school, like extra time for tests or help with their work. But, a lot of schools don't have the stuff they need to give this help.\n\nTopic 3: Feeling Alone\nKids who need more help might also feel alone at school. They might have a hard time making friends or feel like they don't fit in, which can make them feel sad and lonely.\n\nPart 2: Ways to Help Kids who Need More Help When They Go to Higher School\n\nTopic 1: Start Helping Early and Make a Plan\nOne way to help kids who need more help when they go to higher school is to start helping early and make a plan. This means working with the kid and their family to figure out what they want and need, and making a plan to help them get it.\n\nTopic 2: Work With Help Services\nAnother way is to work with help services. This means working with the help office at school to make sure that kids who need more help get the extra help and support they need to do well.\n\nTopic 3: Friends Helping Friends\nFriends helping friends can also be a good way to help kids who need more help when they go to higher school. These programs have kids who need more help work with their friends who can give them support and help them.\n\nPart 3: Real-Life Stories\n\nStory 1: A higher school kid who needs more help might have a hard time keeping track of time and staying organized. To help with this, the kid can work with the help office to get things like extra time for tests or a program that helps them take notes.\n\nStory 2: A higher school kid who needs more help might feel alone and sad at school. To help with this, the kid can join a friends helping friends program where they get to work with a friend who can give them support and help.\n\nEnding:\nIn the end, going from smaller school to higher school can be hard for kids who need more help. But, with the right help and stuff they need, these kids can do well in school and reach their goals. By working with the help office, joining a friends helping friends program, and getting help early and making a plan, kids who need more help can go to higher school successfully.\n\nWords to Know:\n- Needing more help: When a kid has a hard time with learning and doing everyday things, and it started before they turned 18.\n- Higher school: School that you go to after smaller school, like a big school or a really big school.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 813, "idx": 384716, "original text": "08/18/2010.

{"text": "Lesson: Understanding Moving Pictures\n\n**Introduction:** There's a way to make fun pictures that can move and make sounds on your computer. This is a part of making websites. In this lesson, we will learn how to make and show moving pictures on a website.\n\n**Section 1: Learning about Moving Pictures**\n\n**Topic 1: What are Moving Pictures?** \n\nMoving pictures are a fun feature that lets you put videos on websites without needing anything extra. Moving pictures work well on most computers and are a popular way to show videos on the internet.\n\n**Topic 2: How do Moving Pictures work?**\n\nMoving pictures work by putting a special video file in a special place in the website code. There are different types of video files and ways to control the video like playing, pausing, and finding a specific part of the video.\n\n**Topic 3: Why do we use Moving Pictures?**\n\nThere are many reasons why moving pictures are better. First, moving pictures work well on most computers and don't need anything extra. Also, moving pictures are safe and are not easily broken. Lastly, moving pictures work well and do not need extra things to show the video.\n\n**Section 2: Making a Moving Picture**\n\n**Topic 1: Getting the video file ready**\n\nBefore you can show a moving picture on your website, you need to get the video file ready. You will need to change your video file into a type that moving pictures can show. You can do this using a special tool or program like HandBrake.\n\n**Topic 2: Showing the video**\n\nOnce you have your video file ready, you can show it on your website using a special place in the website code. Here is an example of how to show a moving picture in the website code:\n\n```html\n<video controls>\n  <source src=\"video.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n  <source src=\"video.ogg\" type=\"video/ogg\">\n  Your computer might not be able to show the video.\n</video>\n```\n\nIn this example, we have included two places for video files, each with a different video file (video.mp4 and video.ogg) and a different video type (video/mp4 and video/ogg). The computer will automatically choose the first video type that it can show.\n\n**Part 3: Fun Features of Video Games**\n\n**Topic 1: Playing with the game**\n\nYou can play with the game using simple commands. For example, you can stop and start the game, go to a certain point in the game, and change the loudness.\n\nIn this example, we have added ways to the game that hide the control buttons when the game starts and show them again when the game is stopped.\n\n**Topic 2: Adding words and sounds**\n\nYou can add words and sounds to your game. Here is an example of how to add words in English and SP country:\n\nIn this example, we have added two tags, each with a different word file and a different language (en for English and es for SP country). The game will automatically choose the right word file based on the player's language settings.\n\n**Ending:**\n\nIn this story, we have learned the basics of video games, including its fun parts, how to prepare and start games on a screen, and some advanced features such as playing with the game and adding words and sounds.

{"text": "Story Title: Learning about Taking Care of Children\n\n**Starting:**\n\nIn this story, we will learn about taking care of children and how it affects families and children. We will learn about the different parts of it, including family life, starting to care, the care itself, and leaving care. Throughout this story, we will use real-world examples to show the ideas discussed.\n\n**Section 1: Learning about Taking Care of Children**\n\nTaking care of children is a network of services that provides care and help to children and families in need. It includes foster care, group homes, care centers, and adoption places, among others. The goal of taking care of children is to make sure that children are safe and protected from harm, while also giving them the necessary resources to do well.\n\n**Part 2: Living at Home and Needing Help**\n\nLiving at home can sometimes be hard. There might be not enough money, hurtful things happening, not getting taken care of, or people in the house feeling very sad. When it gets too hard for a family to handle, they might ask for help from people who take care of kids. Those people can step in to help in different ways, like giving advice, helping with money, or finding a new home for the child.\n\n**Part 3: Getting Help**\n\nOnce a child starts getting help from these people, they might live with a new family, with a group of other kids, or in a special place where they get lots of care. The goal is to make sure children are safe and happy, and can grow and learn. This might include going to school, doing fun activities, and seeing a doctor when they need to.\n\n**Part 4: Moving On**\n\nAt some point, kids in this system will become grown-ups. This change, called \"growing up,\" can be hard because they have to start taking care of themselves and find people who can support them. Some kids might go back to their first family, while others might go to school or start working.\n\n**The End:**\n\nIt's really important to understand how the system that takes care of kids works, especially if you want to help protect kids or work in this field. By learning about all the different parts of the system, we can understand better how to help kids and families who need it. Whether you are a teacher, a helper, or just someone who cares about others, this lesson gives you helpful information about the system that takes care of kids.\n\n**Word List:**\n\n- System that takes care of kids: A group of services that helps kids and families who need it.\n- New home: A home given by a new family, where kids live away from their first family.\n- Group home: A house where lots of kids live together, looked after by trained adults.\n- Special care place: A place that takes care of kids all the time, especially kids who have big feelings or behave differently.\n- Place that helps with adoption: A place that helps kids find a new, permanent family.\n\n**Think and Talk:**\n\nDo you think the system that takes care of kids does a good job helping kids and families who need it? Why or why not? Use what you learned in this lesson to back up your answer.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 457, "idx": 342693, "original text": "Description.

More particularly, the present invention is concerned with a toner layer regulating member incorporated in the developing device for causing a toner to form a thin layer, i.e., substantially a single layer on a toner carrier so as to charge it uniformly and stably.\nOne of conventional developing devices for the above application includes a toner carrier in the form of a roller or a sleeve, a toner supply roller, an agitator, and a toner layer regulating member. The toner carrier deposits a charged developer or toner on a photoconductive element or similar image carrier on which a latent image is electrostatically formed. The toner supply roller supplies the toner to the surface of the toner carrier. The agitator conveys the toner to the toner supply roller while agitating it. The toner layer regulating member causes the toner to form a layer on the toner carrier while charging it This kind of developing, device is disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,142,330 (Hirano et al.).\nIt has been customary to make the toner carrier of aluminum, stainless steel or similar rigid material and to make the toner layer regulating member of silicone rubber, urethane rubber or similar elastic material. The problem with such a combination is that even though the regulating member regulates the toner on the toner carrier, the toner deposits thickly in more than one layer(s) or thinly in less than one layer. Such a toner layer cannot be charged uniformly or stably, failing to produce an attractive image. Specifically, it often occurs that much of the toner is charged to a polarity opposite to the expected one and deposited on the background of a latent image formed on the image carrier to thereby contaminate it.", "hash": "97a2229a3af7dd1a4a1af8f23252ef97b41815d0c44d72803a49782db9e29351"}
{"text": "Story: Learning About Tiny Chains for Strength\n\n### Part 1: Ideas\nTiny chains are small pieces that are stuck together. They do many things in our bodies, like helping us grow, sending messages from one part of the body to another, and controlling our body's activities. In sports, tiny chains help make muscles bigger, lose fat, and do better.\n\nGrowing Chain is a type of tiny chain that helps our body grow bigger. It comes from a small part of our brain. Growing Chain is often used in sports to make muscles bigger and stronger.\n\nAnother type of tiny chain also helps our body grow bigger, but it works in a different way. This tiny chain is also used with Growing Chain to make it work better.\n\nMK677 is a tiny chain that works like the second tiny chain, but it is eaten instead of being put into the body like Growing Chain.\n\n### Part 2: Examples\nLet's think about a sportsperson named Jack who wants to use tiny chains to do better. He decides to use Growing Chain and MK677. Jack takes a small amount of Growing Chain twice a week and a small amount of MK677 once a day. This mix will help him grow bigger and stronger.\n\nJack also finds out that eating MK677 is much easier than putting Growing Chain into his body. But, he needs to know that MK677 does not work as fast as Growing Chain, so he should not expect to see changes right away. Instead, he should wait for it to work over some time.\n\n### Part 3: What Could Happen\nImagine if Jack is thinking about adding another tiny chain to his mix. Which toy should he choose?\n\na) Toy A - This toy is another fun one, but it is less fancy than Toy B. Giving it to Jack may not provide lots of extra fun.\n\nb) Toy B - This toy is more fancy than the fun one, but it also needs more care. Giving it to Jack may increase the risk of it getting broken without providing lots of extra fun.\n\nc) Toy C - This toy is a long-lasting fun one that stays fun for up to 16 days. Giving it to Jack may provide more fun, possibly leading to better playtime and joy.\n\nConclusion: In this lesson, we learned about the role of toys in playtime and looked at the use of Fun One, Fancy One, Toy B, and Toy C. We also thought about real examples and real-world playtimes to help us understand how these toys work and how they can be used nicely. By understanding the simple ideas and real uses of these toys, we can make smart choices about their use in our own playtimes.\n\nFun Words to Learn:\n- Toy: A thing for children to play with.\n- Fun One: A toy that brings lots of joy and laughter.\n- Fancy One: Another toy that brings joy, but in a different way than the Fun One.\n- Toy B: A toy that brings the same joy as the Fancy One and is used without needing to be cared for like the Fun One.\n- Toy C: A long-lasting Fun One that stays fun for up to 16 days.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 391, "idx": 233900, "original text": "CjcDAC is a GHRH that remains active up to 16 days.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning about Body Aches and Itches\n\n### Section 1: Simple Ideas\n\nIn this lesson, we will learn about body aches and itches. We will talk about these ideas:\n\n1. What are body aches and itches?\n2. Why do we need to take care of these problems quickly?\n3. How does a magic potion help with these problems?\n4. What is the mix of magic potion and a special herb?\n5. What happens if the magic potion is not good for us?\n\n### Section 2: Questions and Answers\n\n**Question 1:** What are body aches and itches?\n**Answer 1:** Body aches and itches are when your body feels sore or itchy. This can happen in your arms, legs, or other parts of your body. Sometimes, it can make your skin look different too.\n\n**Question 2:** Why do we need to take care of these problems quickly?\n**Answer 2:** We need to take care of body aches and itches quickly because if we don't, it can make us feel very uncomfortable. It can also make it hard for us to move around and do things we love. If we take care of these problems early, it can help us feel better and have more fun.\n\n**Question 3:** How does a magic potion help with these problems?\n**Answer 3:** The magic potion is a special drink that can help make our body aches and itches go away. It works by making our body stop feeling sore or itchy. This can help us feel better and do things we love.\n\n**Question 4:** What is the mix of magic potion and a special herb?\n**Answer 4:** The mix of magic potion and a special herb is a way to help our body aches and itches even more. The special herb is a type of plant that can also help our body stop feeling sore or itchy. When we use the magic potion and the special herb together, it can help us feel much better.\n\n**Question 5:** What happens if the magic potion is not good for us?\n**Answer 5:** Sometimes, the magic potion can make us feel a bit sick. It can make our heart beat faster, make our tummy feel funny, or make us feel tired. But don't worry, if we watch how much we use and use it the right way, we can still use the magic potion safely.\n\n### Section 3: Fun Stories and Real-Life Examples\n\nLet's think about a girl named Sophia who is feeling pain in her joints. Her doctor gives her some medicine to help her feel better. Over time, Sophia notices that her pain and swelling have decreased, and she is able to do her daily activities with less difficulty. However, she also experiences some side effects, such as minor increases in blood pressure and a slightly higher risk of getting sick.\n\nTo manage these side effects, Sophia's doctor checks her blood pressure often and tells her to wash her hands regularly and to avoid contact with people who are sick. Sophia also learns about other things she can do to help manage her pain, such as eating healthy foods, exercising regularly, and getting enough sleep.\n\nBy working closely with her doctor, Sophia is able to manage her pain while minimizing the potential risks of her treatment.\n\n### Glossary\n\n- Joint pain: When a person's joints hurt, causing discomfort and making it difficult to move.\n- Medicine: Something you take to help you feel better when you are sick.\n- Side effects: Things that happen when you take medicine, besides the main effect. Sometimes these are good, but sometimes they can be bad.\n- Healthy lifestyle: Includes eating healthy foods, exercising regularly, and getting enough sleep.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn this lesson, we learned about how Sophia manages her joint pain with the help of her doctor and some medicine. We answered questions and provided examples. By understanding these things, we can better appreciate the importance of managing pain and taking care of our health.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 2131, "idx": 106661, "original text": "[Adverse effects of cyclosporin a observed in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis].\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PA) represent diseases which often demand aggressive therapy in order to control the process and inhibit lesion formation in joints and organs. This kind of therapy can be achieved with cyclosporin A (CsA), particularly when combined with methotrexate (MTX). This combination is far more effective than single-drug therapy and is capable of significantly reducing the number of articular lesions. Considering the fact that monotherapy is associated with many adverse effects, it is feared that both drugs in combination may produce cumulative toxicity. The aim of this work was to determine the frequency of adverse effects caused by CsA in patients treated for RA and PA at the Outpatient Rheumatology Clinic of the First Public Hospital in Szczecin. Our study group consisted of 61 patients, including 47 with RA--35 females, mean age 51 yrs (range: 21-69 yrs), mean disease duration 9.9 yrs (range: 2-23 yrs); 12 males, mean age 51.8 yrs (range: 33-74 yrs), mean disease duration 8 yrs (range: 3-14 yrs) and 14 with PA--6 females, mean age 41.1 yrs (range: 33-55 yrs), mean disease duration 7.8 yrs (range: 2-16 yrs); 8 males, mean age 42.9 yrs (range: 35-50 yrs), mean disease duration 7.0 yrs (range: 0.5-21 yrs). All patients were on MTX. During 11 years of follow-up, CsA was withdrawn due to adverse effects in 20 patients (32.8%).

{"text": "Lesson: How to Read More Books in a Year\nIntroduction:\nReading is a fun activity that helps us learn new things, know more words, and understand more about the world. But, some people find it hard to find time to read more books in a year. In this lesson, we will share tips to help you read more books in a year.\nSection 1: Setting Goals\n- Why do you want to read more books in a year? Is it to learn more, know more words, or to relax after a busy day?\n- Plan how many books you want to read in a year. This could be a number, like 50 books, or a part of how fast you read now.\n- Make your big goal into small, easy goals. For example, if you want to read 50 books in a year, you could aim to read 4 books per month.\nPart 2: Making a Time to Read\n- Pick a time when you like to read. This could be before bed, during lunch, or while going to school.\n- Make a reading plan that has a set time and place for reading. For example, you could read for 30 minutes every evening before dinner.\n- Make sure your reading place is nice and good for reading. This could mean having a soft chair, soft light, and no noises.\nPart 3: Finding Good Books\n- Use the internet like Goodreads or Amazon to find books that you like. You can search by kind, writer, or name.\n- Ask friends or family members for book ideas. They may have read something that you would like.\n- Go to your town library or book shop to look for books. You never know what great book you might find.\nPart 4: Wanting to Keep Reading\n- Keep track of your reading. This could be in a notebook or on an app. Seeing how many books you have read can make you want to read more.\n- Join a book group or online group that likes the same things you do. This can help you stay on track and give you support.\n- Change your reading sometimes. If you are reading real stories, switch to made up stories. If you are reading a long book, switch to a short one.\nEnding:\nReading more books in a year is a good goal that you can reach with some plans and hard work. By making easy goals, making a time to read, finding good books, and wanting to keep reading, you can read more books in a year. Use these plans in your own life and see how much you can read.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 512, "idx": 476256, "original text": "At last there's some good news.

{"text": "Lesson Title: Learning about Play Parks\n\nIntroduction:\nPlay parks are fun areas inside snow fun places where people who ski and those who ride boards can do cool moves and tricks. They usually have jumps, slides, and curved ramps. In this lesson, we will learn about the different parts of play parks and how they are used.\n\nSection 1: Parts of Play Parks\n\n**Jumps**: Jumps are the most common thing in play parks. They come in different sizes and shapes, but the goal is always the same - to make people who ski and ride boards fly into the air and do cool moves while flying.\n\n**Slides**: Slides are things that people who ski and ride boards can slide on. They come in different shapes and sizes, like boxes, slides, and curved ramps. These things are often used to do cool moves like sliding down them or spinning off them.\n\n**Curved Ramps**: Curved ramps are like jumps, but instead of making people who ski and ride boards fly into the air, they make a continuous upward slope. This lets people who ski and ride boards do cool moves while moving up and down the ramp.\n\nSection 2: How to Use Play Parks\n\n**Choose the right park**: Not all play parks are the same. It's important to pick a park that is right for how good you are. If you are just starting, start with smaller things and then try bigger ones.\n\n**Warm-up**: Just like in any other game, it's important to warm up before going to the play park. This will help keep you from getting hurt and make sure you are ready for the fun ahead.\n\n**Learn the parts**: Before trying any cool move, it's important to know the parts of the play park. Spend time getting to know the jumps, slides, and curved ramps before trying to do cool moves on them.\n\n**Watching**: When doing cool moves, it's very important to have a friend who can watch you and make sure you land safely. A friend can also tell you how you did and help you get better.\n\nSection 3: Practice Cool Moves and Tips\n\n**Cool Moves**: There are many cool moves that can be done in play parks, like jumps, spins, flips, and grabs. Here are a few examples:\n\n- **Jumps**: To do a jump, go towards the jump at an angle and go fast enough to clear the jump. Once in the air, bend your knees and lean a little forward to stay balanced. When you land, bend your knees to take the landing well.\n\n- **Spins**: To do a spin, go towards the jump or slide at an angle and go fast enough to clear the thing. As you jump or slide down the slide, turn your body in the way you want to spin.\n\n- **Flips**: To do a flip, go towards the jump or curved ramp at an angle and go fast enough to clear the thing. When you go up or down the big slide, bend your legs and make them small to get ready for the flip. When you leave the ground, make your legs long and turn your body in the way you want to go.\n\n**Tips**: Here are some tips to help you get better at playing in the playground:\n\n- Practice a lot! The more time you spend in the playground, the better you will get.\n\n- Start with the small things and then try the big ones. This will help you be brave and learn how to do tricks safely.\n\n- Always wear your helmet, gloves, and pads. This will help keep you safe if you fall or crash.\n\nWords to know:\n- Playground: A place inside a park where kids can do tricks and stunts.\n- Jump: A thing in a playground that makes kids go into the air.\n- Slide: A thing in a playground that kids can slide on.\n- Big Slide: A thing in a playground that makes a big hill, letting kids do tricks while going up and down.\n\nIn the end:\nPlaygrounds give kids a fun way to show off their tricks.

{"text": "\n\nLesson: Plants - A Big Talk\n\nIntroduction:\nPlants can be used to make a type of fuel, like corn, sugarcane, and beans. They are used instead of old fuels, which we can't make again and can make the air dirty. But, using plants for fuel is also a big talk because of things like how we use the land, food prices, and how it affects the world around us. In this lesson, we will talk about the good and bad things about using plants for fuel and why it's a big talk.\n\nSection 1: What are plant fuels?\nPlant fuels are liquid fuels that are made from plants like corn, sugarcane, and beans. They can be used instead of old gas or diesel fuel in cars. Plant fuels are good because we can make them again and again, unlike old fuels which we can't make again.\n\nSection 2: Good and Bad things about Plant Fuels\nGood things:\n- Make the air less dirty: Plant fuels don't make the air as dirty as old fuels, making them a cleaner option for cars.\n- We can make them again and again: Plant fuels can be made over and over, making them a good option for energy.\n- Help farmers: Making plant fuels helps farmers by giving them a place to sell crops like corn and sugarcane.\n\nDownsides:\n- Using land: Making things like biofuels needs a lot of land, which can cause too many trees to be cut down and animals to lose their homes.\n- Cost of food: When we use plants to make biofuels, food can get more expensive. This can make it hard for people in poor countries to buy food.\n- Hurting nature: Making biofuels can cause pollution and hurt nature if we're not careful.\n\nPart 3: Why Some People Don't Like Biofuels\nThere are a few reasons why some people don't like biofuels, including:\n\n1. Using land: Making things like biofuels needs a lot of land, which can cause too many trees to be cut down and animals to lose their homes. This is a problem because it can hurt nature and people who need nature to live.\n\n2. Cost of food: When we use plants to make biofuels, food can get more expensive. This is a problem because it can make it even harder for people in poor countries to get food.\n\n3. Hurting nature: Making biofuels can cause pollution and hurt nature if we're not careful. This is a problem because it can hurt the world and make the weather worse.\n\nThe End:\nIn the end, biofuels can be a problem for many reasons like using too much land, making food more expensive, and hurting nature. Even though they can help by making less pollution and helping farmers, we have to think about the bad things they can cause too. Like anything else, we have to think carefully about the good and bad things and make smart choices.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 7618, "idx": 180890, "original text": "Biofuels: A controversial resource\n\nVery few new innovations have been introduced and accepted without controversy and liquid biofuels are no exception. Tony Wheatley explores biofuels across the globe further, a controversial resource in any language.\n\nAlthough there is little consensus over when, it is generally accepted that global production volumes of oil and natural gas must \u2018peak\u2019 at some point in time. Undeveloped reserves, new discoveries and new extraction techniques will continue to provide growing volumes in the future, but recent price trends reflect global fears of its eventual depletion.\n\nLiquid biofuels, derived from food crops promised an early solution to the challenge of reducing the developed world\u2019s dependence on fossil fuels for transportation. In Europe, targets for biofuel substitution were carefully calculated to support the overall objective of limiting global warming to 2\u00b0C above the pre-industrial average temperature.\n\nStavros Dimas, the EU\u2019s Environment Commissioner, admitted recently that its goal of sourcing 10% of Europe\u2019s transportation fuel from biofuel resources by 2020 overlooked some sustainability issues. In his 2007 State of the Union address, ex-president George Bush announced his \u2018Twenty in Ten\u2019 plan for the US that is similarly flawed.\n\nControversy over land use and food price inflation has exposed these plans to be somewhat short sighted and accelerated the development of a new generation of biofuels.\n\nSustainabilityThis word has gained popularity in recent times and in reports and treaties associated with the Kyoto Protocol, or the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, \u2018sustainability\u2019 usually means long-term viability.\n\nIn the developing countries of Asia, Africa and South America, where unemployment exceeding 40% is common, populations of vast informal townships suffer without effective sanitation or paved roads and millions exist on less than $2 per day, the word \u2018sustainability\u2019 is likely to be associated with more immediate consequences. To a farm worker in Indonesia for example, the word sustainability probably means finding work next season so that his family won\u2019t starve.\n\nIt is interesting to note that maize farmers in the US have demonstrated no greater insight or commitment to long-term sustainability, than palm oil producers in Indonesia, or sugar and soy growers in Brazil and Argentina. Profit has always been the prime motive for economic activity because human needs are unlimited, but resources are finite.\n\nThe effectiveness of policy decisions in Europe and North America, in achieving the intended effect on global warming, is compromised because the demand created for certain food crops is already large enough to distort world markets.\n\nGaseous biofuelsFlammable biogas is believed to have been used in ancient Persia but the first known sewerage plant built to capture this energy-rich gas was in Mumbai, India in 1859. In 1895 the UK city of Exeter adopted similar technology to provide street lighting. Estimates put the number of small digesters producing biogas for household heating and cooking in China at seven and a half million and in India at three million.\n\nThe anaerobic digestion process operates at temperatures above 95\u00b0C and is very effective in warmer climates to convert animal, plant or human waste into clean burning fuel gas and liquid fertilizer. Usually constructed below ground of either brick or concrete, biogas digesters are inexpensive and simple to build and operate reliably for 20 to 30 years.\n\nBiogas generated this way consists of a mixture of methane (50-75%) and carbon dioxide (25-50%) with small amounts of nitrogen, hydrogen, hydrogen sulphide, oxygen and water vapour. This is very similar to landfill gas and by removing the carbon dioxide and other impurities can be upgraded to match the properties of natural gas, may be called Synthetic Natural Gas (SNG) and substituted in most applications. This so-called green natural gas is generated by small biogas plants of less than 1MW output capacity in many European countries.\n\nInjection of SNG sourced from landfills into the natural gas grid, was first tested in the Netherlands as early as the late 1990s. Since then this technology has been established in Switzerland, Sweden, Austria and Germany with nearly 30 biogas plants connected to the grid by 2007. Distributing bio-SNG through the existing grid doubles the potential energy efficiency to almost 90%, by avoiding the waste heat loss of peripheral Combined Heat and Power (CHP) facilities.\n\nSince 2000 micro CHP units have rapidly gained popularity in several countries driven by tax credits, feed-in tariffs and other incentives; Japan leads this initiative with 90,000 units in use. SNG can also power fuel cells for direct conversion into electricity where heat is not required.\n\nIt is expected that after 2015 plants greater than 100MW will provide bio-SNG to substitute for significant proportions of natural gas across the EU. Second generation bio-SNG technology under development now, will use dry biomass feedstock like waste wood, which is first gasified to produce a stream containing about 11% methane, 32% hydrogen and 21% carbon monoxide with 30% carbon dioxide and other contaminants. Catalytic methanation and removal of carbon dioxide and contaminants will produce bio-SNG.\n\nCompressed Natural Gas (CNG) is widely used to fuel the efficient operation of city busses and an estimated 10 million vehicles worldwide have been converted to use CNG. The availability of public facilities for refuelling cars is still patchy except in Germany, California and several major cities like Paris and Barcelona. Some gas companies like Gaz de France allow domestic consumers to install a compressor for overnight refuelling at home.\n\nA study commissioned by the German Green Party in 2006, by two leading German environmental science organisations, concluded that biogas and bio-SNG could replace the EU\u2019s total requirements for natural gas by 2020. This may have been optimistic, but achievements to date have demonstrated the enormous potential of biogas and several other countries including the UK plan to investigate the technology over the next few years.\n\nThe controversial issues of competing land use and potential inflation of basic food prices are avoided.\n\nMaximising bio-SNGBiogas and bio-SNG, being derived from renewable resources, can boast carbon neutrality even if the carbon dioxide removed during upgrading is released.\n\nIf carbon dioxide is collected and sequestered, biogas and bio-SNG they could even have a negative impact on greenhouse gas levels.\n\nThe EU\u2019s goal of maximising the substitution of bio-SNG will require the importation of significant volumes of biomass.\n\nVehicles fuelled with CNG have limited range because of the size of tanks required. A limited range of new vehicles is now available equipped for duel-fuel operation. Standards for grid injection of bio-SNG need to be harmonised across Europe.\n\nNo comments yet\n\nHave your say\n\nOnly registered users can comment on this article.\n\nAbout gasworld\n\nMonth on month the gasworld website continues to be the primary portal for information, on a global scale, about our industry - be it through the provision of news and features, or information in the expansive company directory section.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Feeling Sick\n\n## Section 1: Simple Ideas\nWhen we feel sick, our body might have trouble working right. It could be because of a sick heart, sick lungs, or sticky stuff in our lungs. In this lesson, we will learn about why we feel sick, how we can tell, and what can help us feel better.\n\n## Section 2: Questions and Answers\n**Question:** How can we tell if we are feeling sick?\n**Answer:** We can feel sick in different ways. We might feel out of breath, tired, dizzy, or have an owie in our chest.\n\n**Question:** Can we always make the sickness go away?\n**Answer:** Sometimes we can't make the sickness go away, but we can do things to feel better. We might take medicine, breathe in special air, or have a doctor help us.\n\n## Section 3: What Things Mean\n**What it means:** When we feel sick, it could be for different reasons. It could be because we don't know why, because our lungs are sick, our heart is sick, because of sticky stuff in our lungs, or because of many other reasons.\n\n**Example:** Let's say a 60-year-old woman named Alice feels out of breath, tired, and puffy. The doctor listens to her chest and hears a funny sound. The doctor uses a special tool and finds out that Alice's sickness might be because we don't know why.\n\n## Section 4: Real Life Examples\n**Example:** Now, let's say a 45-year-old man named Benjamin who used to smoke and has trouble breathing, feels pain in his chest, and feels dizzy. The doctor listens to his chest and hears a funny sound. The doctor takes a picture of Benjamin's chest and finds out that Benjamin's sickness might be because his lungs are sick.\n\n## Part 5: Fun Talk Time\n**Question:** How is a lung problem different from a common body problem?\n**Answer:** A lung problem means having trouble in the lungs, while a common body problem means having trouble in the whole body. The reasons, signs, and ways to make these two problems better are different.\n\n## Word List\n- Lung problem: Trouble in the lungs.\n- WH: Big Health Group.\n- COPD: A lung problem.\n- Emphysema: A problem where the air bags in the lungs are hurt, leading to trouble breathing.\n- Heart problem: A problem where the heart can't move enough blood to meet the body's needs.\n- Left heart problem: A problem where the left part of the heart doesn't work well.\n- Blood block problem: A problem where blood blocks stop the lung path.\n- Many-reason things: Things involving many reasons or causes.\n\n## Ending\nIn this part, we learned about a lung problem, its reasons, signs, and ways to make it better. We also had fun talk time by discussing how a lung problem is different from a common body problem. By knowing the basics of this problem, we can better see and handle a lung problem in ourselves and others.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 812, "idx": 238603, "original text": "Severe pulmonary hypertension associated with primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome.\nSevere pulmonary hypertension is one of the fetal complications in various connective tissue diseases.

{"text": "Lesson: How to Look at and Think about Real Story Texts\n\nStart:\nIn this lesson, we will learn how to look at and think about real story texts. Real story texts are written to tell, teach, or make readers believe about real people, things, or ideas. They can be found in books, articles, writings, and other forms of words.\n\nPart 1: Looking Strategies\n\nTopic 1: Quick Looking and Finding\nQuick looking is fast reading through a text to get an idea of what it talks about. Finding is reading certain parts of a text to find information. Both strategies are good when looking at real story texts.\n\nTopic 2: Finding Big Ideas and Helping Details\nBig ideas are the most important points in a text. Helping details are the facts, examples, and proof that help the big ideas. When looking at real story texts, it is important to find both big ideas and helping details.\n\nTopic 3: Making Links\nLinks are ties between different pieces of information in a text. When looking at real story texts, try to make links between ideas, things, or people. This will help you understand the text better.\n\nPart 2: Thinking about Real Story Texts\n\nTopic 1: Finding the Writer's Reason\nThe writer's reason is the reason why they wrote the text. It can be to tell, teach, make believe, or have fun. Finding the writer's reason will help you understand their message.\n\nTopic 2: Looking at Proof\nProof is the information used to support the writer's point. When looking at clues, ask yourself if it is easy to understand, linked to the topic, and enough. This will help you decide if the person's story is good.\n\nStory 3: Understanding the Story's Shape\nThe shape of a story is how it is put together. True stories can be put together in the order things happened, around a theme, or by showing what caused what. Understanding the story's shape will help you follow the person's story and understand their message.\n\nPart 3: Using Skills in Real Life\n\nStory 1: Looking at News Stories\nNews stories are a type of true story that tells readers about things happening now. When looking at news stories, look for the main things, details that help explain, and links between ideas.\n\nStory 2: Looking at Adverts\nAdverts are a type of true story that tries to get readers to buy something. When looking at adverts, look for what the person wants, clues, and shape.\n\nEnding:\nIn this talk, we learned how to read and look at true stories. We learned about quick reading, finding main things and details that help explain, making links, finding out why the person wrote the story, looking at clues, understanding the story's shape, and using these skills in real life. By getting better at these skills, we can become better readers and thinkers.\n\nWord List:\n- True story: Writing that is about real people, things happening, or ideas.\n- Main things: The most important parts in a story.\n- Details that help explain: Facts, examples, and clues that help explain main things.\n- Links: Ties between different parts of information in a story.\n- Why the person wrote the story: The reason why the person wrote the story.\n- Clues: Information used to help explain the person's story.\n- Shape: How a story is put together.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 484, "idx": 299744, "original text": "Check this guy out, or maybe we should check out Detroit.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Ball Game Numbers\n\nIntroduction:\nBall game is a fun game played by lots of people all over the world. If you're a fan or a player, knowing the numbers linked to the game can make it more fun and help you play better. In this lesson, we will learn about some common ball game numbers and how they are worked out.\n\nSection 1: Hitting Average\n\nHitting average is one of the most common ball game numbers. It is worked out as the number of hits divided by the number of times at-bat. In simple words, it tells us how good a hitter is at getting a hit when it's their turn to bat.\n\nThe way to work out hitting average is:\n\nHitting Average = (Hits + Walks + Hit by Pitch) / Plate Appearances\n\nLet's learn about some simple ways we can understand how well someone plays in a game like baseball. \n\nWhen someone plays, sometimes they can run to first base without doing anything else. We can call these \"Walks\". There are also times when the ball hits the player, and we call these \"Hit by Pitch\". Then, there are times when the player gets to bat - we can call these \"Batting Times\". \n\nLet's pretend that a player has played 100 times. They ran to first base 20 times, had 15 walks, and got hit by the ball 5 times. If we add these together and divide by the total times played, we get a number. For example, (20 + 15 + 5) / 100 = 0.250. This number helps us understand how often the player gets to run to first base. \n\nWe can also understand how often someone gets to first base in another way. We can add the runs, the walks, and the times hit by the ball, and then divide by the total times played. If a player has played 100 times, ran to first base 20 times, had 15 walks, and got hit by the ball 5 times, we get (20 + 15 + 5) / 100 = 0.333. This number gives us a clearer picture of how often the player gets to first base. \n\nSometimes, we want to know how many bases a player gets each time they bat. We can find this out by adding the total bases, the walks, and the times hit by the ball, and then dividing by the total times played. If a player has played 100 times, ran to first base 20 times, had 15 walks, and got hit by the ball 5 times, we get (20 + 15 + 5) / 100 = 0.400. This number tells us how many bases the player gets each time they bat. \n\nHere are some words to remember:\n- \"Batting Times\": This is when the player gets to bat. It includes walks, times hit by the ball, and times the player has batted.\n- \"Total Bases\": This is how many bases the player gets through running to first base and other ways.\nWalks: How many times the player gets to first base without doing anything.\n- Hit by Pitch: How many times the player is hit by the ball thrown.\n\nIn the end:\nIn this story, we learned about three common ball game numbers: hitting average, getting on base percentage, and hitting power percentage. We learned how each number is made and what it tells us. By knowing these numbers, we can enjoy the ball game more.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 832, "idx": 391421, "original text": "Mitch Keller Suffered From Bad Luck In 2019. 4 weeks agoPittsburgh Pirates starting pitcher Mitch Keller, who had a 1-5 record and 7.13 ERA in just 48 innings over 11 starts in 2019, could be in line for a much better 2020 season if his luck improves.

{"text": "Lesson: Fun of Playing Outside\n\nIntroduction:\nIn this lesson, we will learn about why playing outside is good. We will see how being in nature can make us think better, feel calm, and make us happy.\n\nSection 1: Fun of Playing Outside\n\n**Topic 1: Thinking Better**\n\nOutdoor activities like going for a walk, camping, and fishing can make us think better. According to a study by Rachel, being outside can help us think of new things and solve problems.\n\n**Topic 2: Feeling Calm**\n\nPlaying outside can also make us feel calm. When we are in nature, we can forget about hard things and just enjoy the moment.\n\n**Topic 3: Feeling Happy**\n\nBeing in nature can also make us feel happy. Studies have shown that being outside can make us feel good and happy.\n\nSection 2: Real Examples\n\nLet's think about some real examples of how playing outside can help us. Imagine you are a person who needs to come up with new ideas. Going for a walk or being near water could make you think of new things.\n\nOr imagine you are feeling stressed because of work or school. Going for a walk can make you feel calm and less worried.\n\nSection 3: Thinking Together\n\n**Question: Can playing outside help everyone?**\n\n**Answer: While playing outside can be good for many people, it might not help those who live in big cities with not many parks. But, even people living in cities can still enjoy being in parks or other green areas.\n\nConclusion:\n\nPlaying outside can be very good for our minds and bodies.

That's the conclusion from a new study that found a team of backpackers were 50 percent more creative after they had spent four days on the trail.\n\nThe study \u2014 which has not yet been published in a scientific journal \u2014 was conducted by Ruth Ann Atchley, department chair and associate professor of cognitive/clinical psychology at the University of Kansas. It was discussed in the Wall Street Journal this weekend.\n\n\"There's a growing advantage over time to being in nature,\" Atchley said in a press release about the research last month. \"We think that it peaks after about three days of really getting away, turning off the cellphone, not hauling the iPad and not looking for Internet coverage. It's when you have an extended period of time surrounded by that softly fascinating environment that you start seeing all kinds of positive effects in how your mind works. \"\n\nAtchley and her colleagues gave a standard test of creativity called the Remote Associates Test to four groups of backpackers, totaling 60 people, before they left on long hikes. A second set of 60 backpackers got the same test, but they took it four days into their hikes. The second group of hikers \u2014 the ones deep into their nature journeys \u2014 scored nearly 50 percent higher in creativity. The results were the same regardless of the participants' ages, which ranged from 18 into their 60s. The research was conducted in partnership with the outdoor leadership nonprofit Outward Bound.\n\nAtchley discussed the value nature provides to the human mind: \"Nature is a place where our mind can rest, relax and let down those threat responses,\" she said. \"Therefore, we have resources left over \u2014 to be creative, to be imaginative, to problem solve \u2014 that allow us to be better, happier people who engage in a more productive way with others.\" She calls the constant distractions and stimulations of modern life a \"threat,\" saying \"they sap our resources to do the fun thinking and cognition humans are capable of \u2014 things like creativity, or being kind and generous, along with our ability to feel good and be in a positive mood.\"\n\nThe Journal cites several other recent studies which found that spending time in nature provides cognitive benefits.

{"text": "Lesson: School Report Cards\n\nIntroduction:\nSchools use report cards to see how well students are doing in their learning. It's important for students to know about report cards so they can do better. In this lesson, we will learn about different kinds of marks, what they mean, and how they are figured out.\n\nSection 1: Kinds of Marks\n\nThe marks students usually get are A, B, C, D, and F. These marks show how well students are doing in school.\n\nA: This is the best mark and shows that a student is doing really well.\nB: This mark means a student is doing better than most.\nC: This mark means a student is doing okay.\nD: This mark means a student could do better.\nF: This is not a good mark and shows a student isn't doing well.\n\nSection 2: Average Mark\n\nThe average mark is a number that shows how a student is doing in all their classes. It is figured out by adding up all the marks a student gets.\n\nExample: If a student gets an A in a class, they will get 4 points.\n\nSection 3: Mark Rules\n\nEach school has its own rules for how marks are given. Some schools think some classes are more important than others. Other schools change the marks based on how everyone in the class did.\n\nSection 4: Mark Scale\n\nThe mark scale can be different in each school.

The front SR makes tiny cells, while the back SR makes brain cells that go to the smell place and the thinking place.\n\nPart 2: The Trip of SR-Made Cells to the Smell Place\n\nOnce made in the SR, the cells travel to their last stop in the smell place. This trip is guided by different signs and cell talks. The cells first travel along the front travel way (FTW), a special path that connects the SR to the smell place. Once they reach the smell place, the cells change into tiny cells.\n\nPart 3: The Message Type of SR-Made Cells\n\nIn this part, we will look at the message type of SR-made cells. We will talk about two main messages: happy message and calm message. Happy and calm cells are very important for the smell place to work well. These cells help control the work of big cells, which are the main cells of the smell place.\n\nHappy Cells:\nHappy cells are made in the SR and go to the smell place. They make the happy message. These cells are in the outer tiny layer and the smelling layer of the smell place. They connect with big cells, helping control their work.\n\nCalm Cells:\nCalm cells are also made in the SR and go to the smell place. They make the calm message. These cells are in the inner tiny layer and the smelling layer of the smell place. They connect with big cells, helping control their work.\n\nPart 4: Real Examples and Real Life\n\nLet's think about a time when an animal smells a new smell. The smell particles go up the smell skin and reach the smell place. The big cells in the smell place find the smell particles and send info to the top head places. There are tiny little helpers in your nose that help you smell things. They make sure that your nose can tell the difference between different smells.\n\nWhat we learned:\nIn this story, we learned about a special place in your body where new helpers are born. These helpers then travel to your nose. We also learned how these helpers work together to let you smell things. By knowing how these helpers work, we can better understand how we smell things. This can help us in many ways.", "source": "minipile", "s": 8, "len": 1912, "idx": 364074, "original text": "Dopaminergic and GABAergic interneurons of the olfactory bulb are derived from the neonatal subventricular zone.\nEarlier studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that a discrete region of the anterior part of the neonatal subventricular zone (SVZa) contains exclusively neuronal progenitor cells. The descendants of the SVZa progenitor cells are destined for the granule cell and glomerular layers of the olfactory bulb, where they differentiate into granule and periglomerular cells, the interneurons of the olfactory bulb, respectively. In the present set of experiments we examined the neurotransmitter phenotype of the SVZa-derived cells. In order to label SVZa-derived cells, the cell proliferation marker bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected into the SVZa of postnatal day 2 (P2) rats. After 3 weeks, by which time most of the SVZa-derived cells have migrated to their final destination in the bulb, the animals were perfused and their brains processed for immunohistochemistry. To identify the neurotransmitter phenotype of the SVZa-derived cells, sagittal sections of the forebrain, including the olfactory bulb, were double-labeled with an antibody to BrdU in conjunction with an antibody to gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) or tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate limiting enzyme in the synthesis of dopamine. Using simultaneous indirect immunofluorescence to detect the presence of single- and double-labeled cells, we found that 59% and 51% of the BrdU-positive cells were immunoreactive for GABA in the granule cell and glomerular layers, respectively. In addition, 10% of the BrdU-positive periglomerular cells were immunoreactive for TH. The presence of double-labeled (BrdU-positive/GABA-positive and BrdU-positive/TH-positive) cells in the olfactory bulb, demonstrates that the SVZa is a source of the GABAergic and dopaminergic interneurons of the olfactory bulb during postnatal development.", "hash": "50c50a3070f05a07e65c271880be89d387738894aec1a0c4ee2bf6e737f01ce8"}
{"text": "Lesson: Understanding Big Fans\n\nIntroduction:\nBig fans are important tools used in different places to move air. They are often used in air systems, cooling towers, and other processes that need air flow. In this lesson, we will learn about big fans, how they work, and where they are used.\n\nBig Fans:\n- Big fans are made to move a lot of air.\n- The size of a big fan can range from small (like a foot) to really big (like 30 feet). Sometimes, they can be even bigger.\n- Big fans come in many sizes, from 12 inches to 48 inches wide.\n- The power of a big fan can range from a little to a lot.\n\nHow They Work:\nBig fans work by turning electricity into moving power, which makes the fan spin. The main part of the fan moves the air, and the fan is attached to the outer part of this main part. As the fan spins, it makes a low-pressure area on one side and a high-pressure area on the other side. This difference in pressure makes the air move through the fan, creating a continuous flow of air.\n\nWhere They Are Used:\nBig fans are used in different places for different purposes, including:\n- Air systems in buildings, factories, and other places.\n- Cooling towers in power plants and other processes that make heat.\n- Dust collection systems in factories, mines, and other dusty places.\n- Air cleaning systems in places that make harmful gases or particles.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, understanding big fans, how they work, and where they are used is important for anyone interested in learning more about them.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Cooling Things Down\n\n## Section 1: Basic Ideas\n\nKeeping things cool is a way to stop them from spoiling. This is important for food and medicine. We use this every day. \n\n## Part 2: Real Examples \n\nLet's think about ice cream. If we leave ice cream out, it melts. But if we put it in the fridge, it stays solid longer. \n\nGrocery stores also use this. They keep meat, milk, and other food in cool places so they don't spoil. \n\n## Part 3: Questions to Think About \n\n1. Where do we use cooling in our lives? \n2. How does cooling work? \n3. Why is it good to use cooling to keep food and medicine safe? \n\n## Words to Know \n\n- Cooling: This is when we take heat away from something or a place. \n- Fan: This is something that helps to take away heat. \n- Pump: This is a thing that makes gas or air move, which can make things hotter or cooler. \n- Cooler: This is something that takes heat from gas or air and makes it cooler. \n- Small Pipe: This is a tiny tube that controls how much cooling stuff moves in a cooling system. \n\n## The End \n\nSo, cooling is very important. It keeps food and medicine safe. It also helps keep things the right temperature.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Animals - Harry the Fish\n\nIntroduction:\nIn this lesson, we will learn about a special fish called Harry. We will talk about where Harry lives, how he behaves, and why he needs our help. We will also learn ways to help Harry.\n\nSection 1: Meet Harry the Fish\n\nHarry the Fish lives in a big, big sea. This sea has many other seas close to it. Sometimes, you can find Harry in another sea too, but it's not very common. People like Harry a lot because he gives yummy food. That's why many people keep Harry on farms.\n\nSection 2: Why Harry Needs Our Help\n\nHarry needs our help because of a few problems. One big problem is big water walls built by people. These water walls change where Harry lives and makes it hard for him to have babies. Another problem is when people do things that hurt Harry's home, like making it dirty or catching too many fish like Harry. These things have made it hard for Harry and his friends.\n\nSection 3: Helping Harry the Fish\n\nTo help Harry, we need to do a few things. First, we need to make sure Harry has enough space to swim around on the farm. This will make Harry feel like he's at home. Next, we need to let Harry have babies in a nice way on the farm. This will help more fish like Harry to be born. Last, we need to find a nice way to get food from Harry. This will make sure Harry is treated nicely when it's time to get food from him.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn the end, Harry is a special fish that gives us yummy food. But, we don't know a lot about where he lives and how he behaves. We need to learn more about these things to help Harry. By fixing the problems of water walls, cleaning up the sea, and making farms better, we can help save Harry and his friends.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 918, "idx": 284840, "original text": "Huso huso is a long-lived and late maturing species endemic to the Ponto-Caspian Sea region, which includes the Caspian Sea, the Sea of Azov, and the Black Sea.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Computer Parts\n\nSection 1: What Are Computer Parts?\n\nComputer parts are the things inside a computer that make it work. These parts include the big board, the thinker, the rememberer, the storer, things that let us talk to the computer, and the power giver. In this lesson, we will learn about these computer parts and how they work together to do different things.\n\nSection 2: The Big Board and The Thinker\n\nThe big board is the main part inside a computer that connects all the other parts together. It has a spot for the thinker and places for more parts and helpers. The thinker, or the brain of the computer, does all the work like following directions and doing math problems. It talks with other parts through the big wires on the main part.\n\n## Part 3: Remembering and Keeping Things\n\nRemembering, or RAM (Big Memory), is a type of thing that keeps data for a little while when the computer is working. It lets the little thinker access data quickly and well. Keeping things devices, like big disks and solid disks, keep things for a long time. They are slower than remembering but can keep a lot of information.\n\n## Part 4: In/Out Things\n\nIn/Out things let people use the computer and get things from it. Examples include typing boards, mice, screens, printers, and noise boxes. These things talk with the computer through holes and faces, like USB, HDMI, and Net.\n\n## Part 5: Energy Giving and Ending\n\nThe energy giver is in charge of giving electricity to all the parts in the computer. It changes the AC energy from the wall hole into DC energy that the parts can use. The energy giver (EG) is an important part of any computer system.\n\nIn the end, knowing the easy ideas of computer parts is important for anyone who likes computers or new things.

{"text": "Lesson: The Touch-Sense Pathway\n\nIntroduction:\nThe touch-sense pathway is a special part of our body that helps us feel things and know where our body parts are. In this lesson, we will learn about this pathway, how it works, and why it is important in our daily lives.\n\nSection 1: What is the Touch-Sense Pathway?\n\nThe touch-sense pathway is a bunch of tiny wires in our body that carry information about touch and where our body parts are from our body to our brain. This pathway is divided into two parts: the touch wires and the sense wires.\n\nThe touch wires are found on both sides of our back and carry information from our skin, muscles, and joints to a part of our brain. From there, the information is passed on to the sense wires, which go along the middle of the brain and carry the information to another part of the brain.\n\nSection 2: How the Touch-Sense Pathway Works\n\nThe touch-sense pathway works by noticing changes in pressure, shaking, and touch. When we touch something, the tiny wires in the touch wires are activated, sending signals to a part of our brain. These signals are then sent to the sense wires, which carry them to another part of the brain.\n\nThis part of the brain is responsible for sorting and organizing the information before sending it to the rest of the brain. For example, if we touch something hot, this part of the brain will quickly send a message to our brain to tell us to move our hand away.\n\nSection 3: Why the Touch-Sense Pathway is Important\n\nThe touch-sense pathway is important because it allows us to feel and respond to what's around us. Without it, we would not be able to feel touch or know where our body is. This pathway is essential for activities like reading with our fingers, playing piano, or even typing on a keyboard.\n\nConclusion:\nIn summary, the touch-sense pathway is a very important part of our body that allows us to feel touch and know where our body parts are. By understanding how this pathway works, we can appreciate its importance in our daily lives and how it helps us interact with our world.\n\nGlossary:\n- Touch wires: A pair of bundles of tiny wires that run along the back of our back, carrying information about touch and where our body parts are.\n- Sense wires: A bunch of tiny wires that go along the middle of the brain, carrying information from the touch wires to another part of the brain.\n- Brain part: A part in the brain that acts like a post office for sensory information, sorting and organizing it before sending it to other parts of the brain.\n\n[1] \"Big Pathway Video.\" Online platform, made by Big Course, a while ago, website.com.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Animal Studies\n\nSay hello:\nIn this lesson, we will learn how to read and understand animal studies. We will look at a special study about what happens when cows eat less protein.\n\nPart 1: Understanding the Structure of an Animal Study\n\nA study usually has a beginning, middle, and end. In this study, we will focus on the middle and end.\n\nWhat They Did:\nThis part tells us about the animals used, what they ate, and what was measured. It also tells us about the math used to understand the results.\n\nWhat Happened:\nThis part shows the data collected during the study, including measurements and what was seen. It may have pictures and graphs to help us understand the data.\n\nWhat It Means:\nThis part explains what the results mean. The authors may talk about what their findings could mean and what to study next.\n\nPart 2: Looking at the Results\n\nNow we will look at the results of the study, focusing on what was seen in the baby cows.\n\nWhat Happened:\nThe study found that cows that ate less protein when they were about to have babies and during the first part of pregnancy had babies with tougher meat and less heat-soluble collagen in their muscles compared to cows that ate more protein. But, the tenderness of another muscle was not affected by what the mom cow ate.\n\nWhat It Means:\nThe authors think that the differences seen may be because of changes in how collagen is made and broken down during the first part of pregnancy. They also say that more study is needed to understand the long-term effects of eating less protein on the quality of cow meat.\n\nPart 3: Using the Results\n\nNow that we understand the results of the study, we can use them in other situations. For example, if we are raising cows for meat, we may want to think about the effects of eating less protein on the quality of the meat when we decide what to feed them.\n\nThe End:\nIn the end, this study helps us understand the effects of eating less protein on the quality of cow meat. By understanding the results and using them in our own situations, we can make better choices about how to get the best meat from our cows.\n\nWord List:\n- Meat: Yummy food that can taste and feel different.\n- Back leg muscle: A muscle in the back leg of the cow that is used to make food.\n- Back muscle: A muscle on the cow's back that is used to make yummy food.\n- How soft: How easy it is to chew the food.\n- Gel: A thing in hot water that changes how the food feels.\n- Softness: How easy it is to cut or chew the food.\n- Fiber: A type of thing in muscles that can be big or small.\n- Fat in muscles: Fat that is found inside the muscle.\n- Good oil: A type of oil that is found in many plants and fish and is good for people.\n\nTalking Time:\nWhat good and bad things might happen if cows eat less protein when they are about to have a baby and in the first part of their pregnancy?

{"text": "Story: Learning About Space\n\n### Overview\n\nIn this story, we will learn about space, which is about studying the stars and things in the sky. We will talk about things like our solar system, groups of stars, and the whole universe. By the end of this story, you will understand some simple things about space and use them in real life.\n\n### Chapter 1: Our Solar System\n\n1. What is the solar system?\n\nOur solar system is a group of things in the sky that move around the Sun. It has eight planets, including our Earth, and lots of smaller things like moons, rocks flying in space, and icy balls.\n\n2. How did the solar system start?\n\nOur solar system started a long, long time ago from a cloud of gas and tiny bits. The cloud fell in on itself and began to spin and flatten into a pancake shape. Over time, the stuff in the pancake came together to make the planets and other things that are in our solar system now.\n\n3. What makes each planet special in our solar system?\n\nThere are eight planets in our solar system, each special in its own way. Here is a little about each planet:\n\n- Mercury: Small, rocky planet nearest to the Sun\n- Venus: Big, thick air, very hot\n- Earth: Not too big, just right for life, has water\n- Mars: Small, rocky, cold, red color\n- Jupiter: Big giant, many moons\n- Saturn: Big giant, has rings\n- Uranus: Small, tilted, blue-green color\n- Neptune: Big, farthest from the Sun\n\n### Chapter 2: Groups of Stars\n\n1. What is a group of stars?\n\nA group of stars is a big group of stars, gas, and dust that stick together. There are billions of star groups in the universe, each different in its own way.\n\n2. How are star groups sorted?\n\nStar groups can be sorted by their shape. For example, some star groups have a middle part with a flat, spinning disk around it, while others are more round and have no disk. Some star groups do not fit in any of these groups. What is the Big Circle in the sky?\n\nThe Big Circle is the place where our Sun and its family live. It is a special circle with a middle part and a spinning disk around it.\n\n### Part 3: The Big Everything\n\n1. What is the Big Everything?\n\nThe Big Everything is all the space and the time and everything that is in it. It is very big and has many, many circles, each with their own stars and planets.\n\n2. How old is the Big Everything?\n\nThe Big Everything is very, very old. It is so old that we can only say it has been there for a very, very long time.\n\n3. What is the mystery stuff?\n\nThe mystery stuff is something that we can't see, but we know it's there because it makes things move. It's a big part of the Big Everything, but it's very hard to find because it doesn't shine or take in light.\n\n### The End\n\nIn this lesson, we have learned about the Sun's family, the big circles, and the Big Everything.

{"text": "Title: Learning About Less and More in Shops\n\nIntroduction:\nIn this story, we will learn about less and more in shops. We will talk about these things:\n\n1. What is less price?\n2. How to find out less price?\n3. Kinds of less price\n4. More price\n5. Shop for food places\n\nChapter 1: What is less price?\nA less price is when the price of a toy or candy is less. It is usually given to make people want to buy more or to say thank you to good customers.\n\nQuestions and Answers:\nQ: Why do shops give less prices?\nA: Shops give less prices to make more people come and buy things.\n\nChapter 2: How to find out less price?\nTo find out a less price, you need to know the first price of the toy or candy and the less price part. Then, you can use this easy way:\n\nLess Price = (First Price x Less Price Part) / 100\n\nFor example, if the first price of a toy is 10 coins and the less price part is 10%, the less price would be:\n\nLess Price = (10 coins x 10%) / 100 = 1 coin\n\nSo, the child would pay 9 coins instead of 10 coins.\n\nKinds of Less Prices:\n1. More Toys Less Price: This is given when children buy a certain number of toys.\n2. Big Buy Less Price: This is given when children buy a lot of toys.\n3. Special Day Less Price: This is given on special days or holidays.\n4. Friend Less Price: This is given when children tell their friends about the shop.\n\nChapter 3: More Price\nMore prices are the prices that shops pay for toys or candies. These prices are usually less than the prices we see because shops buy a lot.\n\nShop for Food Places:\nThese shops sell things and stuff to food places and other places that make food. They have a lot of things, including kitchen stuff, plates, and cleaning things.\n\nChapter 4: Food Place Stuff\nFood place stuff includes all the machines, stuff, and chairs needed to run a food place. Examples of food place stuff include cold boxes, hot boxes, and tables.\n\nChapter 5: Kitchen Stuff\nKitchen stuff refers to the tools and machines used in making and cooking food. Examples of kitchen stuff include cutters, big pots, and big pans.\n\nConclusion:\nIn this story, we learned about less and more prices. We talked about what a less price is, how to find out less prices, and the kinds of less prices. We also learned about shops for food places and food place stuff.

This way is useful when you don't have a big machine or when you want to make a special shape for your project. The way is to use some hand tools to shape the wood into a round form.\nMaterials:\n- Wood piece (at least as thick as your thumb)\n- Hand cutter\n- Sharp tools (different sizes)\n- Smoother\n- Sandpaper\n- Holders\nSteps:\n1. Cut the wood piece to the length and width you want.\n2. Use a small saw to make little cuts around the big piece of wood. Make sure the cuts are not too close so you can use a tool between them.\n3. Use a tool to take out the extra wood between the cuts. Do this all around the wood until all the extra wood is gone.\n4. Make the wood smooth using a tool or paper that feels like sand.\n5. Use helpers to hold the wood in place while you make it look nicer.\n6. Do steps 2-5 again on the other side of the wood to make it look the same on both sides.\nEnd of the story:\nMaking a wooden shape without a big machine needs you to be patient and careful. But, with practice, you can make a beautiful, special shape for your projects. Remember to take your time and use your tools carefully so you don't get hurt.

The 3-dimensional finite element models of maxillary Le Fort-I osteotomy with 9 kinds of RIF methods were established. Then the models were divided into three groups to calculate the stress distribution of the maxilla and the displacement of bone segment under 3 kinds of occlusion condition. The fixation stability of the different RIF methods was evaluated. Under the incisor occlusion condition, the stress of the cranio maxillary complex transmits mainly along the nasal-maxillary buttress. Under the premolar and molar occlusion condition, the stress transmits along the alveolar process first, then turns to the nasal-maxillary and zygomatic-maxillary buttress. The focused stress position of the internal fixation system is at the connection between the screws and the plate and at the plate near the osteotomy line. Under the premolar occlusion condition, the displacement of bone segment with different RIF methods was (in a decreasing order) 0.396509 mm (with bio-absorbable plate), 0.148393 mm (with micro-plate ), 0.078436 mm (with mini-plate) in group 1; 0.188791 mm (fixing at the nasal-maxillary buttress), 0.121718 mm (fixing at the zygomatic-maxillary buttress), 0.078436 mm (fixing at the both buttress) in group 2; 0.091023 mm (with straight plate), 0.078436 mm (with L shape plate), 0.072450 mm (with Y shape plate), 0.065617 mm (with T shape plate) in group 3.

Middle Time: This starts when the place where the baby comes out is big enough and the baby's head starts to show. Mommy's pain might get stronger and happen more often. The baby's heartbeat might change when mommy feels the pain.\n\n3. Last Time: This starts when the baby's head is all the way out. Mommy pushes the baby out. The baby's head, shoulders, and body come out one after the other.\n\nChapter 2: What the Baby Does\nThe baby helps when it's time to come out. In the early time, the baby moves to get ready to come out. When the place where the baby comes out gets bigger, the baby's head might start to show. The baby might also turn its shoulders to fit through.\n\nChapter 3: Why Mommy Needs to Visit a Doctor\nVisiting a doctor is good for mommy and the baby. It helps to make sure mommy and baby are healthy, find any problems early, and get tips on staying healthy when mommy is going to have a baby.

{"text": "Story: Discovering Information from Story Files with Python\n\nBeginning:\nIn this story, we will discover how to find information from a story file with Python. We will use a special tool to understand the story file and find the needed information.\n\nWhat we need:\n- Basic understanding of Python language\n- Knowing about story files\n\nWhat we will do:\n- Learn the basic layout of a story file\n- Use a special tool to understand a story file\n- Find information from a story file with Python\n\nChapter 1: Introduction to Story Files\n\nWhat is a story file?\nA story file is a special kind of paper that uses marks to keep information. It is used a lot to share information between different computer programs.\n\nLayout of a story file\nA story file has a main part, which holds other parts. Each part can have special features and child parts.\n\nExample:\nA story file might look something like this:\n\n```\n<BigStory>\n  <StoryFeatures>\n    ...\n  </StoryFeatures>\n  <StoryWithParts>\n    <Part id=\"0\"/>\n    FIRST PART\n    <Part id=\"19\"/> \n    <Part id=\"20\"/>\n    1. 1/1/09 - part text 1\n    <Part id=\"212\"/>\n    part text 2\n    <Part id=\"223\"/>\n    part text 3\n    ...\n    <Part id=\"160652\"/>\n  </StoryWithParts>\n  <ExtraSet></ExtraSet>\n  <ExtraSet Name=\"SomeName\">\n    ...\n  </ExtraSet>\n</BigStory>\n```\n\nChapter 2: Understanding Story Files with Special Tool\n\nThe special tool gives a simple way to understand and find information from a story file. It makes a tree-like picture of the story document, which helps to look around and find information.\n\nGetting the Special Tool\nIf you don't have the special tool, you can get it by doing this:\n\n```\nask for special tool\n```\n\nUsing the Special Tool\nOnce you have the special tool, you can use it to understand a story file. Here's how:\n\nFirst, you ask for the special tool:\n\n```\nask for special tool as ST\n```\n\nNext, you can understand a story file by giving the file path to the `understand` method:\n\n```\nstory = ST.understand('big_story.story')\n```\n\nNow that you understand the story file, you can look around to find the needed information. You can use different ways to look through the tree and get information.\n\nPart 3: Getting Information from a Story File\n\nNow we know how to read a story file, let's get the sample text at special ids.\n\nFirst, we need to find the `TextWithNodes` part in the story file. We can do this using the `find` way:\n\n```python\ntree = ET.read('story_document.xml')\nroot = tree.getroot()\ntext_with_nodes = root.find('TextWithNodes')\n```\n\nNext, we need to find the `Node` parts with special IDs. We can use the `findall` way to find all `Node` parts with a special mark:\n\n```python\nnode_parts = text_with_nodes.findall('.//Node[@id=\"%d\"]' % node_id)\n```\n\nIn the end, we can get the text content of each `Node` part using the `text` mark:\n\n```python\nfor node in node_parts:\n    print(node.text)\n```\n\nExample:\n```python\ntree = ET.read('story_document.xml')\nroot = tree.getroot()\ntext_with_nodes = root.find('TextWithNodes')\nnode_parts = text_with_nodes.findall('.//Node[@id=\"19\"]')\n\nfor node in node_parts:\n    print(node.text)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nMESSAGE SET\n```\n\nIn the end\nIn this part, we learned how to read and get data from a story file. We also learned how to use different ways to get data from a story file.\n\nWords to Know\n- Story File\n- ElementTree: A way to read and change story and poem documents\n- Node: A part in a story document that holds other parts or text\n- Mark: A property of a part that gives more information about the part\n- ID: A one-of-a-kind mark for a part\n\nLesson Plan:\n- Getting to Know Story Files\n  - What is a story file?\n  - Structure of a story file\n- Reading Story Files using ElementTree\n  - Getting the ElementTree way\n  - Using the ElementTree way\n- Getting Information from a Story File\n  - Looking through the tree\n  - Getting data using different ways\n- In the End\n  - Going over the lesson\n  - Using skills learned to new problems", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 2149, "idx": 445392, "original text": "Q:\n\nMost efficient method to extract data from this XML file\n\nXML File Sample\n<GateDocument> \n  <GateDocumentFeatures>\n    ...\n  </GateDocumentFeatures>\n  <TextWithNodes>\n    <Node id=\"0\"/>\n    MESSAGE SET\n    <Node id=\"19\"/> \n    <Node id=\"20\"/>\n    1. 1/1/09 - sample text 1\n    <Node id=\"212\"/>\n    sample text 2\n    <Node id=\"223\"/>\n    sample text 3\n    ...\n    <Node id=\"160652\"/>\n  </TextWithNodes>\n  <AnnotationSet></AnnotationSet>\n  <AnnotationSet Name=\"SomeName\">\n    ...\n  </AnnotationSet>\n</GateDocument>\n\nJust to start off, this is the first I'm coding in Python and dealing with XML, so sorry if I miss really obvious things!\nMy goal is to extract the sample text at specific node ids.\nFirst attempt - I used minidom, which did not give me the correct methods in dealing with the extraction (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11122736/extracting-text-from-xml-node-with-minidom) due to this weird format of the node ids in self-closing tags.\nSecond attempt - I took up suggestions in looking at lxml, I have successfully extracted the text to something like this:\n['\\n\\t\\t','n\\t\\tMESSAGE SET\\n\\t\\t','\\n\\t\\t','\\n\\t\\t1. 1/1/09 - sample text 1,....,'\\n\\t']\n\nWith some clean up, I think I can get the text fine, however, I lose the associated node id value.  \nwith the code: \nfrom lxml import etree\nfrom StringIO import StringIO\nxmlfile = ('C:\\...AnnotationsXML.xml')\nxmldoc = etree.parse(xmlfile)  \nprint xmldoc.xpath(\"//TextWithNodes/text()\")\n\nSo I guess my questions is:\n\nIs there a way to extract the above without the \\n\\t\\t?

{"text": "Lesson: Bad Things in BE country\n\nIntroduction:\nIn this story, we will talk about people being treated badly in BU country (also known as MY country). We will learn what being nice to people means, why it's important, and how some people in BU country are not being nice. We will also learn about a big group called the UN that helps when people are being treated badly.\n\nSection 1: What does being nice to people mean?\nBeing nice to people means that everyone should be treated well just because they are people. This includes being safe, being free to say what you think, being treated the same as everyone else, and many other things.\n\nWhy is being nice to people important?\nBeing nice to people is important because it keeps us safe from those who might want to be mean or unfair. It makes sure that every person is treated well and with respect, no matter who they are or where they are from. Without being nice to people, people could be treated badly, used, and not given the things they need.\n\nSection 2: People not being nice in BU country\nEven though BU country is a part of the big group called the UN, BU country has been said to treat its own people very badly, especially a group called the RO people. The RO people are a group who believe in a religion called Islam who have lived in BU country for a long time, but the people who run the country don't accept them. Because of this, the RO people are not given the same things and help, like going to the doctor and going to school.\n\nThe people who run BU country have also been said to hurt the RO people a lot, including hurting them very badly and making them leave their homes. The UN has asked for all the people who are kept in jail for no good reason in BU country to be let go and for the places where they are kept to be closed down.\n\nSection 3: The Help from the UN\nThe UN has done a lot to help when people are being treated badly in BU country. In the year after 2016, the UN started a team to find out about the bad things happening in the country. The team found out about really bad things happening, including people being hurt and treated badly, and asked for the people doing these things to be made to answer for what they did.\n\nThe UN has also asked for all the people who are kept in jail for no good reason in BU country to be let go and for the places where they are kept to be closed down. It has also asked the people who run the country to let help get to the people who need it and to make sure that all people, no matter what they believe or who they are, are treated the same and kept safe.\n\nConclusion:\nTo end, people being treated badly in BU country is a big problem that needs to be helped by everyone in the world. The UN has a big job to make sure that these bad things are found out about and the people doing them have to answer for what they did. By learning about being nice to people and why it's important to protect it, we can work towards a world where everyone is treated well and with respect.\n\nWords to know:\n- Being nice to people: Treating everyone well just because they are people.\n- RO people: A group who believe in a religion called Islam living in BU country who are not accepted by the people who run the country.\nUN: A big group started a long time ago to help countries be peaceful and work together.\n\nQuestion time: \nDo you think leaders should say sorry if they are not nice to people?

{"text": "Story: Learning about Sharing and Trading\n\n### Part 1: What is Sharing and Trading?\nSharing and trading is about how we use our limited toys to make everyone happy. It involves thinking about how we, our friends, our parents, and other people choose to share, use, and give away our toys and treats.\n\n### Part 2: Understanding Giving and Taking\nGiving and taking are two big ideas in sharing and trading. Giving is when we have a toy or treat that we want to share with others. Taking is when we want a toy or treat that someone else has. How we give and take decides who gets what toys and treats.\n\n### Part 3: Ways of Sharing and Trading\nThere are three main ways of sharing and trading: sharing because it's nice, sharing because mom and dad say so, and sharing because we decide to. When we share because it's nice, we share and trade based on what makes us and others happy. When we share because mom and dad say so, mom and dad decide how we share and trade. When we share because we decide to, we think about giving and taking to decide how to share and trade.\n\n### Words to Remember:\n- Limited: When we want lots of toys and treats but only have a few.\n- Choice: When we have to decide between two or more things.\n- Fair: When everyone gets the same amount.\n- Better: When one toy or treat is nicer or more fun than another.\n\n### Ending:\nUnderstanding how sharing and trading works can help us make better choices as kids, students, and friends. By learning about sharing and trading, we can better understand how we use our toys, how we play together, and how different ways of sharing and trading work.

Ice cream is a cold treat made from milk or cream, sugar, and different flavors. It is made by stirring and freezing the mix to make it smooth and creamy.\n## Part 2: Fun Examples\nTo understand how to make ice cream, let's think about this example. Imagine we want to make vanilla ice cream. We start by mixing milk, sugar, and vanilla together. We then stir the mix very fast to make it fluffy and colder than ice. Finally, we freeze the mix to make it hard.\n## Part 3: Real-Life Situations\nNow let's think about a real-life situation. Imagine a company wants to make a new flavor of ice cream.

{"text": "Lesson: How to Pick the Best Look-Far Glasses for You\nIntroduction:\nLook-far glasses are handy for lots of fun things, like watching birds, looking for animals, going on boat rides, and going on trips. They help you see things far away very clearly, which is great for people who love being outside. But, there are so many different kinds, it can be hard to know which ones to get. In this lesson, we will talk about the important things to think about when picking look-far glasses, like how big they make things look, how big they are, and how strong they are.\nSection 1: Understanding Look-Far Glasses\nWhat are look-far glasses?\nLook-far glasses are two small look-closers stuck together side by side, made to make far away things look clearer and bigger. They have two pieces of glass, one for each eye, and a part that holds them together.\nHow do look-far glasses work?\nLook-far glasses work by gathering light from a thing and focusing it through the glasses to make a clear picture. The glasses are made to bend light so that they meet at one spot, making a sharp and bright picture.\nSection 2: Picking the Right Look-Far Glasses\nWhat things should I think about when picking look-far glasses?\nWhen picking look-far glasses, there are several things to think about, including:\n- How big they make things look: This is how powerful the glasses are, which tells you how much bigger they make things look. The bigger the power, the closer the thing looks.\n- How big they are: This is how big the glasses are, which changes how easy they are to carry and use. Smaller glasses are more easy to carry, while bigger ones are more steady and give a clearer picture.\n- How strong they are: This is how well the glasses can handle rough weather, like rain, fog, and very hot or cold weather. Look for glasses that are water-proof and fog-proof.\n- How much they cost: This is how much the glasses cost, which can change based on how good they are and what extra things they have.\nWhy are these things important?\nThese things are important because they change how well the glasses work, how easy they are to use, and how long they last. By thinking about these things, you can pick the best look-far glasses for you and your money.\nSection 3: Real Life Examples\nLet's say you are someone who likes to look for animals and needs look-far glasses to see them from far away. You would want glasses that make things look really big, like 10x or 12x, to get a close-up look at the animals. You would also need strong glasses that can handle the rough land and tough weather of the wild.\nOn the other hand, if you are someone who likes to go on trips and wants look-far glasses to see sights, you would want small and light glasses that don't make things look too big, like 8x or 10x, to keep your eyes from getting tired. You would also need water-proof and fog-proof glasses to keep them safe from the weather during your trips.\nConclusion:\nIn simple words, picking the right looking-glasses needs thinking about several things, like how big things appear when you look through them, their size, and how strong they are. By knowing about these things, you can pick the best looking-glasses for your play and see the world around you in a clear and detailed way. \n\nWords to remember:\n- How big things appear: This is how much bigger things look when you look through the looking-glasses.\n- Size: How big or small the looking-glasses are. This can change how easy it is to carry them and use them.\n- How strong they are: This is how well the looking-glasses can handle tough situations, like rain, fog, and very hot or cold weather.\n- Cost: This is how much money you need to buy the looking-glasses.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning about Groups of Tiny Things\n\n### Overview\nIn this lesson, we will learn about groups of tiny things and how they move. We will look at a simple way to talk about these groups.\n\n### What you will learn\nBy the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n1. Talk about what groups of tiny things are\n2. Talk about the simple way and how we use it\n3. Know the basics of how these groups change over time\n4. Use what you learned to talk about new groups of tiny things\n\n### Part 1: Learning about Groups of Tiny Things\nGroups of tiny things are just a lot of tiny things that act in a special way. We can find these groups in different places, like in small things we can't see with our eyes, in things from space, and in things we use to make stuff. Learning about these groups is hard because there are so many tiny things and they all act in complicated ways with each other.\n\n### Part 2: Simple Way\nThe simple way is a method we use to make talking about groups of tiny things easier. We do this by thinking about how the group acts on average. This means we replace the complicated actions of all the tiny things with one action that tells us what the group does on average. This makes it easier for us to learn about the group.\n\n### Part 3: How Groups Change Over Time\nHow groups of tiny things change over time can be described by some rules. These rules come from the simple way and help us to learn about the group at different levels. There is one rule that talks about how one tiny thing in the group changes over time. This rule is very important and we use it in many different places.\n\n### Part 4: Conclusion\nIn this lesson, we learned about groups of tiny things and how they move using the simple way. We also learned about the rules that tell us how these groups change over time. By knowing these ideas, we can use them to new problems about many tiny particles and learn more about how they act.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 8, "len": 988, "idx": 100703, "original text": "Mean-field limit for the dynamics of quantum particle systems.

{"text": "Story: Changing Between Weight, Tiny Things, and Space Using Moles\n\nStart:\nMoles are a way to measure things in science. They are used to talk about the amount of a thing, usually in terms of its weight or tiny things. In this story, we will learn how to change between weight, tiny things, and space using moles. We will learn about three types of changes: changing from weight to moles, tiny things to moles, and space to moles.\n\n1. Changing from Weight to Moles:\n\nThe idea of moles was talked about a long time ago. It is the amount of a thing that has the same number of tiny things as there are in a small amount of something. This is a big number.\n\nTo change weight to moles, we use a way:\n\nmoles = weight / thing's weight\n\nwhere weight is the weight of the thing in small units, and thing's weight is the weight of one mole of the thing in small units per mole.\n\nExample:\n\nChange a small weight of sugar to moles.\n\nSugar has a certain weight.\n\nmoles = small weight / sugar's weight = a small number of moles\n\n2. Changing Tiny Things to Moles:\n\nTo change tiny things to moles, we use a way:\n\nmoles = tiny things / big number\n\nWe are talking about small things in the air, and a very big number that scientists use.\n\nExample:\n\nHow many small air things, let's call them bubbles, are in a room with 1000 air bubbles?\n\nSince air is mostly made of two things, let's call them blue bubbles (78%) and green bubbles (21%), we can think that 78% of the 1000 air bubbles are blue bubbles and 21% are green bubbles.\n\ngreen bubbles = 0.21 * 1000 bubbles = 210 bubbles\n\n3. Changing space to bubbles:\n\nTo change space to bubbles, we use a special rule:\n\nBigP * BigV = BigN * BigR * BigT\n\nwhere BigP is how hard the bubbles push, BigV is how much space the bubbles take, BigN is how many bubbles there are, BigR is a special number (0.0821), and BigT is how hot the bubbles are.\n\nBut, we cannot directly change space to bubbles using this rule, because we need to know how hard the bubbles push and how hot the bubbles are. Instead, we can use the idea of space for each bubble, which is how much space one bubble takes when it is not too hot and not too cold, and that is 22.4.\n\nWhen it is not too hot and not too cold, 1 bubble takes 22.4. So, if we know how much space the bubbles take when it is not too hot and not too cold, we can find out how many bubbles there are using this:\n\nbubbles = space / space for each bubble\n\nExample:\n\nHow many bubbles are in a balloon with a space of 500 at not too hot and not too cold?\n\nWhen it is not too hot and not too cold, 1 bubble takes 22.4. So, the bubbles in the balloon can be found like this:\n\nbubbles = 500 / 22.4 = 0.0222 bubbles\n\nIn the end:\n\nIn this time, we learned how to change between heavy, small things, and space using bubbles. We talked about three kinds of changes: changing from heavy to bubbles, small things to bubbles, and space to bubbles. We also talked about the idea of space for each bubble and a very big number. By knowing these ideas, we can use our skills to new things and make good choices in science.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 8, "len": 736, "idx": 117743, "original text": "Use the mole as a basic unit of measurement and convert from mass, particles and molar volume to moles and vice versa..

It helps us feel and respond to things around us. Today, we will learn about how this system helps our heart and lungs work together.\n\n**Section 1: Understanding Our Nervous System**\n\nOur nervous system helps us understand things around us. It uses our eyes, ears, and skin to gather information and help us react.\n\n**Section 2: Heart and Lungs Working Together**\n\nOur heart and lungs send signals to our brain. These signals help our body know when to breathe faster or slower and when our heart should beat faster or slower.\n\n**Section 3: Special Brain Cells**\n\nThere are special cells in our brain that help our heart and lungs work together. These cells get information from our heart and lungs and help our body react to changes around us.\n\n**Section 4: Signals from Our Lungs**\n\nOur lungs have special fibers that send signals to our brain. These signals tell our brain about how much our lungs are filled with air, which helps our body know how fast or slow we should breathe.\n\n**Section 5: Learning More**\n\nScientists study how our heart and lungs work together in animals like mice. They look at how the special fibers in the lungs send signals to the brain and how the brain uses these signals to help the heart and lungs work together.\n\n**Section 6: What Scientists Found**\n\nScientists found that the signals from our lungs and heart all go to the same place in our brain. This helps our brain know about changes in our breathing and heartbeat and helps our body react in the right way.\n\n**Section 7: What We Learned**\n\nToday, we learned about how our nervous system helps our heart and lungs work together. We learned about how our brain takes in different kinds of information from our senses and helps us understand and react to what's around us.\n\n**Words to Know:**\n- Brain working: The way our brain brings together information from different places to help us understand or react to things.\n- Heart and lung signals: The way signals from our heart and lungs are brought together in the brain.\n- Brain cells: Cells in a special part of the brain that take in information from different senses, including the heart and lung signals.\n- Special lung nerves: Nerves that tell the brain about how our lungs are moving and filling up with air.\n- Animal studies: A way for scientists to learn about the brain in a living animal.\n- Medicine: Something that makes heart sensors work harder.\n- Substance: Something that makes special sensors in the neck work harder.\n- Blood pressure sensors: Sensors that tell the brain about changes in the pressure of our blood.\n\n**Let's Think:**\n\n1.

Pulmonary vagal C-fibers were excited by right atrial injection of phenylbiguanide (PBG) while cardiac receptors were stimulated by left ventricular injection of veratridine (1-3 micrograms/kg) or mechanically by distension of the left ventricle (20-50 microl perfusate) using an indwelling cannula. Carotid body chemoreceptors were activated by aortic injection of Na cyanide, whereas baroreceptors were stimulated by increasing arterial perfusion pressure. Stimulation of pulmonary C-fibers and cardiac, chemo-, and baroreceptors all produced a reflex bradycardia (23-133 bpm). Central respiratory activity, as recorded from the phrenic nerve, was depressed by stimulating pulmonary C-fibers and cardiac and baroreceptors but enhanced in amplitude and frequency during chemoreceptor stimulation. Twenty-seven NTS neurons were excited and three were inhibited after pulmonary C-fiber stimulation displaying decrementing discharges with a peak firing frequency of up to 42 Hz (15 +/- 2.2 Hz, mean +/- SE) that lasted for 8.8 +/- 0.9 s. These responses occurred <1 s from the end of the PBG injection that was within the pulmonary circulation time. None of these cells responded to increases in right atrial pressure. All cells excited by PBG were also driven synaptically after electrical stimulation of the ipsilateral cervical vagus nerve at a latency of 32.9 +/- 3.2 ms (range 20-62 ms). None of these neurons had ongoing activity related to central respiratory activity. Convergence from cardiorespiratory afferents to 21 neurons driven by pulmonary C-fibers was tested. Twenty-five percent of cells were selectively excited by chemical stimulation of cardiac receptors alone, 19% were driven by peripheral chemoreceptors, and 38% responded to both cardiac and chemoreceptor activation. In contrast, only 13% of the cells activated by PBG injection responded to stimulation of baroreceptors and only 6% to cardiac mechanoreceptor stimulation. None of these neurons were activated by increasing right atrial pressure. The data indicate a high proportion of afferent convergence from pulmonary C-fibers, cardiac receptors, and peripheral chemoreceptors in the NTS. However, these neurons appear not to integrate inputs from cardiovascular mechanoreceptors. The significance of the data is discussed in relation to pathological disease states such as pulmonary congestion and cardiac failure.", "hash": "74606f8dc39ad649acbc9ae1636f8a1ebebe8e5431c8d373bb3d2456f5b28f8f"}

We will learn about different little things, what they do, and how to pick the right ones for your bathroom.\n\n**Section 1: Different Little Things**\n\nLittle things are small stuff that can make your bathroom better. They can be things like showerheads, taps, towel holders, robe hooks, and mirrors. Each little thing has a special job and can make your bathroom look and feel nicer.\n\n**Section 2: Jobs of Little Things**\n\nWhat a little thing does depends on what kind it is. For example, showerheads make shower time comfortable and fun. Taps let us control the water in the sink or bathtub. Towel holders and robe hooks help us keep towels and robes off the floor and easy to reach. Mirrors are useful because they let us see ourselves when we're getting ready.\n\n**Section 3: Picking the Right Little Things**\n\nPicking the right little things for your bathroom depends on a few things, like how your bathroom looks, what you like, and how much money you want to spend. Here are some tips to help you pick the right little things:\n\n- Think about how your bathroom looks. If your bathroom looks modern or simple, you might want to pick little things that are simple and don't get in the way.\n- Think about what you like. Do you like a classic or new look? Do you like brass or chrome things?\n- Think about how much money you want to spend. Little things can cost a little or a lot. Decide how much you want to spend and stick to your budget.\n\n**Section 4: Real Examples**\n\nLet's say you're fixing up your bathroom and want to add some little things to make it more useful and nicer. You could pick a shiny, new showerhead to replace the old one, a new tap with a smooth design, and a towel holder made of stainless steel to match the new things. You could also add a big mirror above the sink to make the room brighter and a robe hook near the shower to keep your robe off the floor.\n\n**Word List**\n\n- Little Things: Small stuff that can make a bathroom nicer and more useful\n- Showerhead: A thing that sprays water for you to shower under\n- Tap: A thing that controls water in the sink or bathtub\n- Towel Holder: A thing that holds towels\n- Robe Hook: A thing that holds robes\n- Mirror: A thing that lets you see yourself", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 568, "idx": 371584, "original text": "Accessories.

They usually show the person or people who sing the song and pictures that make the song feel stronger. They are a fun thing that you can find on TV, websites, and places where people share things.\n\n## Section 2: Why do we have Music Pictures?\nSongs with pictures are very important because they help us know more about the singer and the song. They give us a picture to look at when we listen to the song, which can help us feel the song more. Songs with pictures also help more people see the singer and the song, which can make more people like them.\n\n## Chapter 3: How do Songs with Pictures work?\nSongs with pictures are made by a group of people who know a lot about making pictures, including the person who leads the group, the person who thinks of the idea, the person who films the pictures, and the people who make the pictures look good. First, the singer and the people who help them make their songs think of an idea for the pictures. After they all like the idea, the group starts to film the pictures. They use special things to make the idea come true, like fake places, clothes, and things they can hold or touch. After they finish filming, the pictures are made to look like a story that goes with the song.\n\n## Chapter 4: Songs with Pictures we Know\nOne song with pictures that a lot of people know is \"Baby One More Time\" by a singer named Britney. The pictures show Britney dancing and singing in a school, with boys dancing around her. Another song with pictures that a lot of people know is \"Thriller\" by a singer named Michael, which is a scary movie that is 13 minutes long and a lot of people know about it.\n\n## Chapter 5: Words to Know\n- Song Business: The part of the song business that includes making, sharing, and selling songs.\n- iT: A thing you can use to listen to songs and buy digital things made by a company named Apple.\n- QT: A thing made by Apple that lets people use digital things.\n- Song Companies: Companies that make and sell songs.\n\n## The End\nIn this lesson, we learned about songs with pictures, why they are important, and how they are made. We also learned about songs with pictures that a lot of people know and what some words mean.

In this lesson, we will learn how to look at maps and use them to answer where questions.\n\nPart 1: Knowing Map Parts\n\nThing 1: Signs and Short Words\n- A map uses signs and short words to show different places.\n- For example, a park may be shown by a green sign, while a building may be shown by a blue sign.\n- Short words are used to save space on the map. For example, \"ST\" may mean \"street.\"\n\nThing 2: Key\n- The key is a guide that tells the meaning of each sign and short word used on the map.\n- It is usually found in the bottom right corner of the map.\n- By looking at the key, you can know what each sign and short word means.\n\nThing 3: Size\n- The size of a map shows the link between the space on the map and the space on the ground.\n- For example, if the size is 1:10,000, then one bit on the map shows 10,000 bits on the ground.\n- The size is usually shown on the map.\n\nThing 4: Line System\n- A line system is used to find points on the map.\n- It has lines of flat and tall.\n- Flat is the line that goes side to side on the map, while tall is the line that goes up and down the map.\n\nPart 2: Looking at a Map\n\nThing 1: Nature's Gifts\n- Nature's gifts are nature's shapes like mountains, rivers, and forests.\n- By looking at the signs and colors used on the map, you can see these gifts.\n- For example, a mountain may be shown by a brown or green sign, while a river may be shown by a blue or black sign.\n\nThing 2: Man's Gifts\n- Man's gifts are man-made things like roads, buildings, and parks.\n- These gifts are usually shown by different signs than nature's gifts.\n- For example, a building may be shown by a blue sign, while a park may be shown by a green sign.\n\nTopic 3: Lines that Separate Places\n- Lines on a map separate different places like countries and states. \n- You can see these lines because they are usually thick or bold. \n- Looking at a map helps us see these different lines.\n\nTopic 4: Things We Find in Nature\n- We find lots of things in nature like water, rocks, and trees. \n- The map uses different signs and colors to show these things. \n- For example, a mine can be shown by a yellow sign and a forest by a green sign.\n\nSection 3: Answering Questions Using Maps\n\nTopic 1: Finding a Place\n- To find a place on a map, you need to know where it is. \n- The place on the map is usually shown in a special way. \n- Once you know where the place is, you can find it on the map.\n\nTopic 2: Knowing the Distance\n- To know how far one place is from another, you can use the map. \n- By looking at how far the places are on the map, you can know how far they actually are. \n- You can do this using a ruler or a special calculator that looks at the map.\n\nTopic 3: Knowing Landforms\n- By looking at the signs and colors on the map, you can know different landforms like mountains, valleys, and flat areas. \n- These landforms can change the weather, plants, and animals in a place. \n- By knowing these landforms, you can understand the place better.\n\nConclusion:\n- Maps are very helpful for knowing more about the world. \n- By reading maps and using them to answer questions, we can know more about the world and the people in it. \n- With this knowledge, we can make good choices about how to take care of our world.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 946, "idx": 165673, "original text": "Nelsonville, New Jersey facts for kids.

In 1887, the area was renamed to Nelsonville for the local postmaster, Charles Nelson. Other industries in the area at the time included a wagon shop and a cider mill. Today, several agricultural and light industries surround the settlement in addition to some single-family homes.

What is learning about things?\nLearning about things is all about knowing how things behave and work with everything around them. It's about knowing what things are made of and how they can be changed to make new things with special things about them.\n\n2. What are some things we use every day?\nWe use many things like metals, pottery things, plastics, and mixed things.\n\nHow do we use these things in different jobs?\nPeople use these things in different jobs based on what they do. For example, metals are often used in building and making things because they are strong and last a long time. Plastics are used to make plastic things, while pottery things are used to make parts for electronics.\n\n### Part 2: Real Life Examples\nIn this part, we will talk about how we use these things in different jobs.\n\n### Example 1: Car Making\nPeople who make cars use a mix of things, including metal, another kind of metal, and plastics. These are picked based on what they do, such as how strong they are, how much they weigh, and how long they last. For example, the other kind of metal is often used to make car engines because it is light and strong, which helps cars use less gas.\n\n### Example 2: Plane Making\nPeople who make planes rely on advanced things to make lightweight and strong planes. For example, strong and light plastics are used to make parts of planes because they are strong, light, and don't get hot or rust.\n\n### Example 3: Doctor Tools\nDoctors use many different things to make tools and equipment. For example, a special kind of plastic is used to make tubes because it is safe for the body, doesn't react with other things, and doesn't let other things into the area around it.\n\n### Part 3: Talking to Ourselves\nIn this part, we will talk to ourselves to learn more about how we use these things.\n\n### Talk 1: Should companies think about nature when picking things?\nYes, companies should think about nature when picking things because it helps the Earth and saves resources. Also, nature-friendly things can make the thing better and work better.\n\nNo, companies should not think about nature more than other things like cost and how well it works. While nature is important, it should not be more important than other things that help the company and its things work well.\n\n### Word List\n- Things study: Learning about how things work and how they act with the world around them.\n- Metals: A kind of thing that is usually hard, strong, and good at moving heat and electricity.\n- Pottery things: A kind of thing that is usually hard, breaks easily, and doesn't move electricity.\n- Plastics: A kind of thing that is usually light, bendy, and doesn't let heat through.\n- Mixed things: A kind of thing made by mixing two or more different things to make a new thing with special things it can do.\n- Safe for the body: Can be used with living things without hurting them.\n- Doesn't react with other things: Doesn't change or break down when it touches chemicals.\n- Making Water: The process of a thing coming out from a stuff into the nearby place.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 839, "idx": 14822, "original text": "Colder Products Company (St. Paul, MN) has announced the addition of PVDF to the available material options throughout its FitQuik Connectors product line.

A filament extruder was used to obtain approx. 4% paracetamol loaded filaments of polyvinyl alcohol with characteristics suitable for use in fused-deposition modelling 3DP. Five different tablet geometries were successfully 3D-printed-cube, pyramid, cylinder, sphere and torus. The printing process did not affect the stability of the drug. Drug release from the tablets was not dependent on the surface area but instead on surface area to volume ratio, indicating the influence that geometrical shape has on drug release. An erosion-mediated process controlled drug release. This work has demonstrated the potential of 3DP to manufacture tablet shapes of different geometries, many of which would be challenging to manufacture by powder compaction.", "hash": "6f89d5daba7fd6cea1b5c9af9e605131932be69dbf1dd1c73c4f331bba9fab7b"}
{"text": "Story: Learning About Houses\nStart:\nLearning about houses is about figuring out how much a house is worth. This is important when people want to buy or sell a house. In this story, we will learn about how to figure out how much a house is worth, why this is important, and how to understand the report that tells us this.\nPart 1: Figuring Out How Much a House is Worth\nFiguring out how much a house is worth involves some steps, including:\n1. The person figuring out the worth visits the house and makes notes about things like how many rooms it has and how big it is.\n2. The person looks at how much other similar houses in the area have sold for to figure out a fair price.\n3. The person puts all the information into a report, which includes a description of the house, data on recent sales, and the figured out price.\nPart 2: Why Looking at Things is Important\nLooking at things is important for a few reasons:\n1. They help people who want to buy and sell a house figure out how much it should cost.\n2. People who lend money need to look at them before they say yes to giving money for a house.\n3. People who decide how much tax you should pay use them to figure out how much your house is worth.\nPart 3: Understanding a Look at Things Report\nA report about looking at things has a few parts:\n1. A story about the house, which talks about what the house has.\n2. Information about houses like yours that people have bought nearby.\n3. How much your house is worth, which is a guess based on what houses like yours have sold for and what your house has.\nThe End:\nLooking at things is a big part of buying and selling houses. They help people figure out how much a house should cost, and people who lend money need them before they say yes to giving money. If you understand how looking at things works and how to understand a report about it, you can make smart choices about buying or selling a house.\nWords to Know:\n- Look at things: A story that guesses how much a house is worth.\n- Fair price: How much a house should sell for to anyone.\n- Houses like yours: Houses that are the same size, in the same place, and have the same things as your house.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 850, "idx": 257405, "original text": "Appraisal. 08-17-2017 03:31 PM.

The repair list should now be sent to the seller either by the lender or typically it will be done through your agent to their agent who then passes it on to the seller. There have been times when the seller came back and asked the buyer to split the cost and it would then be up to you to decide if you will do so. Be sure that you have a loan committment first before agreeing to split any cost of repairs because if the deal does not close you don't get that money back. Good luck!. Dylcia Cornelious.

{"text": "## Lesson: Using a Tool to Play with Many Toys\n\n### Section 1: Introduction\n\nIn this lesson, we will learn how to use a tool to play with many toys. This tool is a helper that lets us play different games. It is commonly used to play and test games.\n\n### Section 2: What is a Toy?\n\nA toy is something that has different settings for our game. These settings include the game rules, the player's name, and other game preferences.\n\n### Section 3: Why Use Many Toys?\n\nUsing many toys allows you to play different games using different rules. For example, you may want to play a game with special rules for some games and without special rules for others.\n\n### Section 4: How to Use Many Toys with the Tool\n\nTo use many toys with the tool, you must prepare many toys. You can do this by getting ready many toys, each with a different setting.\n\nFor example, if you have two toys named \"toy1\" and \"toy2\", you can get ready two helpers using these toys with the following steps:\n\n```\nStep 1: Get ready toy1\nStep 2: Get ready toy2\n```\n\nOnce you have gotten the helpers ready, you can play with them using your hands or any other way that lets you use the tool. To play with the first helper, use the following steps:\n\n```Steps\n1. Pick up the first toy\n2. Set the game rules\n3. Start playing\n```\n\nTo play with the second helper, use the following steps:\n\n```Steps\n1. Pick up the second toy\n2. Set the game rules\n3. Start playing\n```\nLet's learn how to use different tools to visit websites:\n\n### Part 5: Real Life Examples\n\nHere are some real life examples of how to use different tools to visit websites:\n\n1. Visiting a website with a helper and without a helper.\n\n```simple language\n# Visit with helper\nhelper = Helper(\"home helper\", helper1)\nhelper.visit(\"home website\")\n\n# Visit without helper\nhelper = Helper(\"home helper\", helper2)\nhelper.visit(\"home website\")\n```\n\n2. Visiting a website with different tools.\n\n```simple language\n# Visit with tool 1\nhelper = Helper(\"home helper\", tool1)\nhelper.visit(\"home website\")\n\n# Visit with tool 2\nhelper = Helper(\"home helper\", tool2)\nhelper.visit(\"home website\")\n```\n\n### Part 6: Wrapping Up\n\nIn this lesson, we learned how to use different tools to visit websites. We covered what a tool is, why you might want to use different ones, and how to use them. We also provided real life examples of how to use different tools to visit websites.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1290, "idx": 425453, "original text": "Q:\n\nSelenium, Using multiple firefoxProfileTemplates at once / specifying from selenium object rather than at server launch?\n\nI am using Selenium RC for website testing and I need to use multiple proxies at once and am doing this using: firefoxProfileTemplate when I start the selenium server.

{"text": "Lesson: Buying Things for Less Money\n\nIntroduction:\nBuying things for less money is a great way to save money. In this lesson, we will learn about different ways to save money, how to find good deals, and how to make the most of them.\n\nPart 1: Ways to Save Money\nThere are several ways to save money that we can use. These include:\n\n1. Seasonal Sales: These are sales that happen at certain times of the year, like back-to-school sales in August or winter sales in January.\n\n2. Holiday Sales: These are sales that happen around holidays like Christmas, Thanksgiving, or Fourth of July.\n\n3. Old Stock Sales: These are sales where stores sell old things at a lower price.\n\n4. Quick Sales: These are short sales that last for a few hours or days. They usually offer big discounts on popular items.\n\n5. Buy One, Get One Free (BOGO) Sales: These sales allow you to buy one thing at the normal price and get another thing for free.\n\nSection 2: How to Find Fun Things\nNow that we know about different types of fun things, let's talk about how to find fun things. Here are some ideas:\n\n1. Look at store pictures: Many stores send out pictures with information about new fun things.\n\n2. Look at fun things on the computer: Websites like the big online store, the auction place, and the deal place have fun things.\n\n3. Use special words: Before getting your fun thing, always look for special words that can help you save. You can find these words by looking on the computer or asking helpers at the store.\n\n4. Look at different stores: Don't be scared to look at different stores. This way, you can make sure that you're getting the best thing.\n\n5. Wait for fun things: If you're not in a hurry to get something, wait for a fun thing. This way, you can save and get what you want without using a lot.\n\nSection 3: Using Fun Things Well\nOnce you've found a fun thing, it's important to use it well. Here are some ideas:\n\n1. Look at the fun thing: Make sure that the fun thing you're getting is good. If it's not, you may end up wasting your coins.\n\n2. Read what others say: Before getting a thing, read what others say to see if they liked the thing.\n\n3. Think about the return rules: Make sure that you know the store's return rules. This way, you can return the thing if it doesn't meet your hopes.\n\n4. Get more than one: If you need more than one thing, get more than one. This way, you can save even more.\n\n5. Don't use too much: Just because something is fun, doesn't mean you should get it if you don't need it. Stick to your plan and only get what you need.\n\nThe End:\nIn the end, fun things are great ways to save while still getting the things we need or want. By knowing the different types of fun things and how to find fun things, we can use them well. Remember to look at the fun thing, read what others say, think about the return rules, get more than one, and don't use too much.

{"text": "Story: Learning about Wetland Homes\n\n## Part 1: What are Wetland Homes?\nWetland homes are special places where water is always there or comes and goes. These places have many kinds of plants and animals that we cannot find anywhere else. Wetland homes help clean dirty water, hold the soil in place, and give animals a place to live.\n\n## Part 2: Kinds of Wetland Homes\nThere are different kinds of wetland homes like grassy places, tree places, mossy places, and plant places. Grassy places have lots of grass and no trees, while tree places have trees and bushes. Mossy places have a lot of sour dirt and are often covered in a layer of dead plants, and plant places have many kinds of plants because they have good dirt.\n\n## Part 3: Why Wetland Homes are Good\nWetland homes are good for many reasons. They give many animals, from bugs to birds to furry animals, a place to live. They also clean the dirty water, hold the soil in place, and control the water in rivers and streams. Also, wetland homes give food and water to people and animals.\n\n## Part 4: How do Wetland Homes Work?\nWetland homes work by catching and cleaning the dirty water that flows through them. This helps to clean the water before it goes to other water places like rivers and lakes. Wetland homes also hold the soil in place with their roots and other plants. Also, wetland homes control the water by keeping it when there is a lot of rain and letting it go when there is less rain.\n\n## Part 5: Examples of Wetland Homes\nOne example of a wetland home is in the FL place, where many kinds of plants and animals live together in the wetland home. Another example is in the AM forest, where wetland homes give a place for many kinds of animals, including big cats that we need to protect.\n\n## Part 6: Ending\nWetland homes are important places that give many animals a place to live and do important things like cleaning dirty water and controlling the water. By knowing how important wetland homes are and how they work, we can understand their value and work to protect them.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 862, "idx": 201950, "original text": "Webinar: Ecological significance of the Kerang Ramsar wetland complex.

{"text": "Story: Learning about Toy Talks\n\n## Part 1: Ideas about Toy Talks\n\nToy talks are words people write about a toy after they buy and play with it. They tell other kids about how good, fun, and safe the toy is. Toy talks can also help toy makers understand what kids like and don't like, make their toys better, and sell more toys.\n\n## Part 2: Questions and Toys\n\n**Question:** Why are toy talks good?\n**Answer:** Toy talks are good because they tell the truth about the toy from kids who have played with it. This helps other kids decide if they want the toy or not. Reviews help shops know what things kids like and don't like. This can help them make their toys and snacks better.\n\n**Question:** How do shops use reviews?\n**Answer:** Shops use reviews to know what kids think about their toys and snacks. This can help them find out what they need to make better. Good reviews can also make more kids want to buy their things.\n\n## Part 3: What things mean and examples\n\n**Meaning:** A review is when a kid says what they think about a toy or snack they bought and used.\n\n**Example:** \"I just got this apple smell room spray and I really like it! The smell of fresh apples fills my whole house and stays for a long time. It's also very easy to use and doesn't make anything dirty.

{"text": "Lesson: Making Juice\n\nIntroduction:\nJuice is a tasty drink that we have been making for a very long time. It is made from fruits that are grown in gardens and then cleaned to create a yummy drink. In this lesson, we will learn about the process of making juice from picking fruits to pouring the final drink.\n\nSection 1: Picking Fruits\n\nThe first step in making juice is picking the fruits. This is done when the fruits have reached their best taste. There are several things that help us decide when the best time to pick is, including the sweetness and sourness of the fruits. Once the fruits have been picked, they are brought to the kitchen for cleaning.\n\nSection 2: Squashing and Mixing\n\nAfter the fruits have been picked, they are squashed to release the juice inside. This can be done by hand or using a machine called a juicer. The juice is then separated from the skin and seeds and put into big containers. Mixing begins when water is added to the juice, making it less sweet. This process can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, depending on the type of juice being made.\n\nSection 3: Waiting and Making it Better\n\nOnce mixing is complete, the juice is transferred to jugs or containers for waiting and making it better. During this time, the juice settles down, where little pieces begin to go to the bottom of the jug, and air, which can change the color and taste of the juice. The length of time that the juice waits varies depending on the type of juice, but can range from several hours to several days.\n\nSection 4: Pouring and Naming\n\nAfter the juice has been waited and made better, it is ready to be poured. The juice is poured into glass cups and a lid is put to prevent any air from entering the cup. The cup is then closed with a plastic lid and sent to the naming place. Here, a name is given to the cup, which includes information such as the name of the juice, when it was made, and how sweet it is.\n\nConclusion:\nIn this lesson, we learned about the process of making juice from picking fruits to pouring the final drink. We talked about the importance of sweetness and sourness in deciding when to pick fruits, the mixing process, waiting and making it better, and pouring and naming. By understanding these steps, we can appreciate the care and effort that goes into making tasty juices.\n\nGlossary:\n- Picking: the process of gathering fruits from the garden\n- Mixing: the process of adding water to the fruit juice\n- Waiting: the process of allowing the juice to settle and get better\n- Making it Better: the process of the juice changing as it waits\n- Boxes: wood things used for making juice sweet\n- Big boxes: big things used for making juice sweet\n- Cleaning: the way of things going to the bottom of the box\n- Changing: a thing that can change the color and taste of the juice\n- Picking year: the year when the fruit was picked to make juice.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 562, "idx": 625561, "original text": "Grapes were harvested from the premium viticultural regions of Hunter Valley, McLaren Vale and Beechworth.

It can help you get more money, but it can also be risky. In this story, we will learn about how buying houses for money works.\n### Part 1.1: Different Ways to Buy Houses\nThere are many ways to buy houses, like:\n- Houses for families: These are houses, flats, townhouses, and apartments.\n- Shops and offices: These are places where people work, like offices, shops, and big storage places.\n- Land: This is land that doesn't have anything on it, like farms and big open spaces.\n- House Buying Companies: These are companies that buy and rent houses to make money.\n### Part 1.2: How Owning a Home Can Be Helpful\nWhen you own a house, you hope its value will grow over time so you can sell it for more money. Or, you can let people live in it for some money. There are several things that can make a house's value change, like where it is, how the house market is doing, and how good the house is.\n### Part 1.3: Things to Think About When Owning a Home\nOwning a home comes with some things to think about, including:\n- Market: The house's value might go down instead of up, meaning you might lose money.\n- Money matters: If it becomes more expensive to borrow money, you might make less money from your house.\n- Taking care of the house: If you let people live in your house, you might have trouble finding good people to live there, which can cause you to lose money or have to spend more.\n## Part 2: Learning About Owning a Home\nBefore you own a home, it's important to learn a lot to find the best chances. In this part, we will talk about the steps to learn about owning a home.\n### Part 2.1: Understanding the House Market\nTo find the best chances to own a home, you need to understand how the house market is doing where you want to buy. Some important things to think about include:\n- People and families: Are more people moving to the area? Are there many young families or people who work there?\n- Jobs: Is the place doing well, and are there many jobs there?\n- Houses: Are there many houses available, or are there not enough houses in the area?\n- Rent money: How much money do people usually pay to live in similar houses in the area?\n### Part 2.2: Understanding the House\nAfter you understand the market, you need to think about the specific house you want to own. Some important things to think about include:\n- Where it is: Is the house in a good area with good schools, places to shop, and ways to get around?\n- How it is: Is the house in good shape, or does it need to be fixed or changed?\n- Rent money: How much money could you probably get from people living in the house?\n- Money matters: What is the house's potential to make money?\n## Part 3: Ending Thoughts\nOwning a home can be a great way to make money, but it needs careful learning and thinking to find the best chances. By understanding the house market and thinking about the specific house, you can make smart choices and get the most from your money.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 830, "idx": 394937, "original text": "..

{"text": "Lesson: How to Make Tiny Things \n\n**Introduction**\n\nTiny things are very special. They can do many fun things, like helping our toys work, keeping energy, and changing things. One way to make tiny things is by using a hot and fast method. In this lesson, we will learn about this hot and fast method, why it's good, and how to make a tiny thing called MoSi2 powder.\n\n**Theory**\n\nThe hot and fast method is a way to make tiny things by heating and cooling things very quickly. This method starts with a small spark that makes the things get very hot and burn quickly. As this happens, the things get hotter, melt, and become a hard thing. The cooling is so quick that the thing keeps its tiny size.\n\nThe hot and fast method is better than other ways to make tiny things. First, it can make a lot of tiny things quickly. Second, it is good for the Earth, as it does not need any extra stuff. Lastly, it does not cost much, as it needs less energy and less things than other ways.\n\n**Practice**\n\nTo make tiny MoSi2 powder with the hot and fast method, do these steps:\n\n1. Get the things ready: Mix two things called Mo and Si in a ball mill for some hours to make a mix.\n\n2. Start the mix: Put the mixed things in a box and start it with a small spark. The mix will burn quickly and get hot.\n\n3. Watch the mix: Look at the mix with a special camera or tool that can see how hot it is. The heat will go up quickly and then go down.\n\n4. Let the thing cool: When the mix is done, let it cool down by itself or use water or air.\n\n5. Look at the thing: Use a special tool called XRD and another one called SEM to look at the tiny MoSi2 powder. These tools will tell you if the right tiny thing is there and how small it is.\n\n**Words to Know**\n\n- Hot and fast method: A way to make tiny things by making things very hot and then cool quickly.\n- Tiny: Things that are very small.\n- Mo: A type of metal.\n- Si: A type of non-metal.\n\n**Learning About Heat and Temperature**\n\nIn today's lesson, we talked about a process that involves high heat. With this method, we can make a special kind of dust. We learned about the steps to make this dust and why this method is useful. When we understand this method, we can use what we know to do other things.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 539, "idx": 631932, "original text": "Semnan University of Technology, Semnan, Iran.

Usually, heat moves from something hot to something cold. But sometimes, this doesn't happen, and we see interesting things happen instead.\n\nSection 1: Understanding Our Models\n\nTopic 1: Getting to Know Our Models\n- We'll talk about our special models\n- We'll talk about how these models are different from others\n- We'll talk about why it's important to learn about these models\n\nTopic 2: Heat and Temperature\n- We'll talk about a special idea that helps us understand our models\n- We'll talk about how this idea helps us understand heat and temperature\n\nTopic 3: Changes in Temperature\n- We'll talk about how temperature can suddenly change in our models\n- We'll talk about what this means for how we understand heat and temperature\n\nSection 2: Sharing Energy\n\nTopic 1: Connecting Two Things\n- We'll talk about how two things can be connected\n- We'll talk about what happens when two things share energy\n\nTopic 2: Energy and Changes\n- We'll talk about a special kind of energy\n- We'll talk about how this energy changes when two things share energy\n- We'll talk about what this means for how we understand energy and changes\n\nStory 3: Number Games and Real-Life Stories\n\nTopic 1: A Special Number Game\n- Talk about a special number game\n- Show how this game can help us understand a chain of spinning tops\n- Talk about what we learn from this number game about the rule of hot and cold in a line of spinning tops\n\nTopic 2: Real-Life Stories\n- Talk about real-life stories where the rule of hot and cold can be seen\n- Show how understanding this rule can help us understand things that are hard to explain\n- Encourage thinking and talking about what this rule means in our everyday life\n\nIn the end:\nIn the end, we have learned about the rule of hot and cold in a line of spinning tops. We looked at how a special number game and the idea of a line of spinning tops relate to the hot and cold rule. We also talked about real-life stories where we can see this rule.

{"text": "Story: Learning About Health Changes in the US\n\nStart:\nHealth changes is a big topic in the US. Some people think that we need to change how we take care of health to make it easier and cost less for everyone. In this story, we will learn about health changes and how it helps different people.\n\nChapter 1: What are Health Changes?\n\nHealth changes mean making changes to how we take care of health to make it better, cost less, and help all people in the US. The Affordable Care Act (AC), also called \"Obamacare\", is one example of health changes. It wanted to give health care to many people who didn't have it and make the care better for those who already had it.\n\nChapter 2: How do Health Changes help different people?\n\nHealth changes can help different people in different ways. For example, young people who couldn't stay on their parents' health care until they were 26 can now do so because of the AC. Also, people who were sick before can't be stopped from getting care or asked to pay more because of their sickness. But, some people might have to pay more money to help others who can't pay for health care.\n\nChapter 3: What do people think about Health Changes?\n\nSome people who like health changes think that it is needed to make sure that all people in the US can get good and cheap health care. They think that we need to fix how we take care of health to make it better for everyone. But, some people who don't like health changes think that it is too much work for the government and that it will make people pay more money and get worse care.\n\nEnd:\nTo end, health changes is a big topic that affects many parts of our lives. There are good and bad things about it, but many people still don't have good health care. It's important for us to learn about health changes so we can make good choices about our own health care.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 3624, "idx": 433120, "original text": "DES MOINES \u2013 Iowa may have to delay implementing part of its bipartisan Iowa Health and Wellness Plan if federal officials do not grant a full waiver on the program by next week, Gov. Terry Branstad said Thursday.\n\nBranstad said he had a \u201cvery frank\u201d meeting with officials in the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services when he was in Washington earlier this week, but federal officials still have not signed off on a piece of Iowa\u2019s program that sets \u201cvery modest\u201d insurance premiums for low-income participants that is paid for with Medicaid money providing they engage in a health-risk assessment designed to contain costs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not resolved yet,\u201d the governor said.\n\n\u201cWe feel that to be successful in our goal to be the healthiest state that we\u2019ve got to have people take ownership of their own health. HHS seems to have a problem with the premiums,\u201d Branstad said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re saying the premiums are waived if they do a health-risk assessment and they have a whole year to do that,\u201d he added. \u201cWe don\u2019t think that that\u2019s an onerous requirement at all, plus the premiums are very modest. So far they\u2019ve not been willing to do that and we\u2019re saying that this is really an essential part of the program.\u201d\n\nBranstad said his administration feels an obligation to follow through with innovative legislation designed to increase access, drive personal health ownership, and reform the health-care delivery system in a way that pays for quality, not the quantity of health-care services.\n\nThe pact hammered out last May by Iowa\u2019s split-control Legislature seeks to use federal money to expand health-care coverage to needy Iowans by financing insurance premiums for participants who help manage their costs with healthy choices. Backers say at least 150,000 more Iowans will be eligible for health care at a reasonable cost via the legislation, which can\u2019t take effect without a waiver from the federal government.\n\nBranstad said he had a \u201cvery constructive\u201d meeting with David Agnew, deputy assistant to President Obama and director of intergovernmental affairs, regarding Iowa\u2019s unique approach to government-subsidized expansion for Medicaid-eligible recipients. \u201cI think he really gets it,\u201d the governor said.\n\nHowever, he said there is \u201ca little more of a challenge\u201d convincing HHS officials and he remains hopeful they will sign off on the full waiver in time for state officials to begin enrolling eligible participants Oct. 1 for Iowans aged 19-64 with incomes up to and including 133 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nUnder the compromise legislation, Iowans with income up to 100 percent of the federal poverty guideline ($11,490 for a family of one and $15,510 for a family of two) would receive the same benefits as state employees with their insurance premiums being paid for entirely by federal Medicaid money.\n\nIowans who have yearly income between 101 percent and 133 percent of the federal poverty standards (up to $15,281 for a family of one and up to $20,268 for a family of two) will seek private coverage via the state-federal insurance exchange being established under provisions of the federal Affordable Care Act. The premium for the commercial insurance is paid by Medicaid providing the recipients participate in the health-risk assessment.\n\nEnrollment of the eligible population is expected to occur over several years with 60 percent signing up in the first year and 30 percent in the second year, according to the state Department of Human Services. The Iowa Council on Human Services finalized the program\u2019s rules on Thursday.", "hash": "77a6f73a4d526b41da4f3a399a9a4124b3c0731bf3cedd9425494b29a2216361"}
{"text": " Story: Learning About Safety Promise\n\n## Chapter 1: What is a Safety Promise?\nA Safety Promise is a promise between two friends where one friend, called the promise-maker, says they will keep the other friend safe from bad things if the other friend, called the promise-taker, gives them something.\n\n## Chapter 2: Kinds of Safety Promises\nThere are many kinds of safety promises, like:\n\n1. Toy promise: This promise keeps your toys safe from things like fire, storms, or being taken.\n2. Friend promise: This promise keeps you safe from people who might want to hurt you because you did something bad.\n3. Health promise: This promise helps pay for doctor visits, stays in the hospital, and medicine.\n4. Family promise: This promise gives money to family members if the person who made the promise goes away.\n\n## Chapter 3: How Safety Promises Work\nWhen you buy a safety promise, you are really buying a safe net. This safe net keeps you safe from losing money when something surprising happens. You give some money to the promise giver, and they agree to keep you safe from certain dangers. The money you give is usually based on how likely the danger is and how much money it might cost if it happens.\n\n## Part 4: Good Things About Safety Promises\nThere are a few good things about having a safety promise, like:\n\n1. Feeling safe: Knowing that you have a safety net makes you feel safe and less worried.\n2. Keeping your money safe: A safety promise can keep you from losing all your money if something bad happens, like a big storm or if someone is mad at you.\n3. Being able to see the doctor: Health promises can help you see a doctor, even if you don't have a lot of money.\n4. Keeping your loved ones safe: Life promises can make sure your loved ones have money if you are not there anymore.\n\n## Part 5: The End\nIn the end, a safety promise is a very important tool. It keeps you safe and protects your money when surprising things happen. By understanding the different kinds of safety promises and how they work, you can make good choices about what kind of safety you need.

In this lesson, we will learn how changes can help water animals adapt to a changing world.\n\nSection 1: What is Changes and Adapting?\n\n**Understanding it:** Changes and adapting is when things can change without really changing themselves.\n\n**Seeing it in Real Life:** Think about a group of fish living in a pond where the water can get hot and cold. Some of the fish have babies that are good at living in the hot water. People think that changes may have happened in these fish, which lets them pass on these good things to their babies.\n\n**What it Means:**\n- Changes and adapting: when things can change without really changing themselves.\n- Expressing: the way something shows what it can do, like making something useful.\n\nSection 2: Changes and Adapting to a Changing World\n\n**Understanding it:** Changes can happen because of things around them, like hot or cold, and can help things adapt to a changing world.\n\n**Seeing it in Real Life:** Fish living in a pond where the water can get hot and cold may have changes that let them live better in hot water. These changes could be different ways of expressing that help the fish control their body heat or make things to help them live.\n\n**What it Means:**\n- Changes: when things can change without really changing themselves.\n- Controlling: how something is controlled, like turning \"on\" or \"off\" or being carefully chosen.\n\nSection 3: Using Changes to Adapt to a Changing World\n\n**Understanding it:** By understanding how changes can help water animals adapt to a changing world, people can make plans to protect animals that need help and their homes.\n\n**Seeing it in Real Life:** If people understand how some fish are good at living in hot water because of changes, they may be able to make plans that help other fish live in a changing world. This could involve programs that put fish in hot water on purpose or making fake homes that are cooler.\n\n**What it Means:**\n- Protecting life: the study of how to protect and take care of animals and their homes that are in danger because of people, like destroying homes, using too much, making things dirty, and a changing world.\n- Fake homes: things made by people that are like a natural home and help water life in places where the natural home has been lost or is not there.\n\nConclusion:\nUnderstanding how changes help in adapting to a changing world is an important thing for people to study.

We will look at the pattern of colors we see and the angles we see them at to understand the colors.\n\nPart 1: Understanding the Color Pattern\n\nThere is a special rule that helps us understand the colors:\n\n$color = dsin angle$\n\nwhere $color$ is the colors we see, $d$ is the distance between two points, and $angle$ is the angle we see the colors at.\n\nPart 2: Understanding Colors from Angles\n\nWe know these things:\n\n- We have a special tool that has a space of 3 tiny points. We use this tool to look at the colors of a special lamp.\n- We look at the colors from angles from 30\u00b0 to 50\u00b0, and we see the brightest colors at the angles and the colors are shown in the list.\n- Purple: 32.7\u00b0, 42.4\u00b0\n- Blue:   35.5\u00b0, 46.6\u00b0\n- Green:  33.1\u00b0, 46.7\u00b0\n- Yellow: 35.2\u00b0, 35.4\u00b0\n\nWe can use the special rule to understand the colors we see.\n\nFor each color, we need to find the number of bright spots ($color$) and then use the rule to understand the color ($color$). We can do this by using the given values for the angle ($angle$) and the distance between the points ($d$) in the rule.\n\nLet's start with the purple color:\n\n- First angle: 32.7\u00b0\n- Number of bright spots: color = 1 (since it's the first bright spot we see)\n- Distance between points: $d = 3 \\times 10^{-6}$ m (given in the problem)\n- Using these values in the rule:\n\n$1color = (3 \\times 10^{-6})sin 32.7$\n\nFinding the color:\n\nWe learned about colors and how to tell them apart using a special tool.\n\nSo, the color violet is very tiny, tinier than a piece of dust.\n\nWe can do the same for other colors:\n\n- Blue is a little bit bigger.\n- Green is bigger than blue.\n- Yellow is the biggest color we talked about.\n\nNext, let's talk about what we learned:\n\nIn this story, we learned how to tell colors apart using a special tool. We used this tool to find out how big each color was.\n\nWe found out that violet is very tiny, blue is a little bit bigger, green is bigger than blue, and yellow is the biggest. This shows that our tool works well in telling colors apart.\n\nIn the end, we can use this tool to tell apart colors in different things. We can use what we learned to look at different colors in things like stars, rocks, and liquids.", "source": "minipile", "s": 8, "len": 1664, "idx": 662601, "original text": "Q:\n\nCalculating wavelengths from angles in a diffraction grating?\n\nI am having some problems calculating wavelengths from some given information about a grating spectrum.\nA diffraction grating with a spacing of 3\u03bcm is used in a spectrometer to investigate the emission spectrum of a mercury vapour discharge lamp.\nThe spectrum is examined over the range of angles from 30\u00b0 to 50\u00b0, and maxima of intensity are observed at the angles and with the colours shown in the table.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Car Systems\n\n**Objective:** To teach children about car systems and how they help cars work better.\n\n**Words to Know:**\n- Car Engine: A part of the car that uses fuel to make the car move.\n- Two-Step Engine: A car engine that works in two steps: up and down.\n- Four-Step Engine: A car engine that works in four steps: intake, squeeze, power, and blow out.\n- Air and Fuel Door: A hole in the engine that lets air and fuel go into the engine.\n- Smoke Door: A hole in the engine that lets smoke go out of the engine.\n- Control System: A system that uses information to adjust the engine and keep it working well.\n- Air Meter: A tool that measures the amount of air in the smoke to help control the fuel and air mix.\n\n**Introduction:**\nCar engines are used in cars, generators, and other machines that need power. But, these engines make smoke that can harm our air and weather. Car systems have been made to make these engines work better and make less smoke.\n\n**Part 1: Understanding Car Systems**\n\n**Topic 1: Control System**\nControl systems are used in many things, including engines, to keep them working well. In an engine, an air meter is used to measure the amount of air in the smoke. This information is used to adjust the fuel and air mix to make sure the engine works best and makes less smoke.\n\n**Topic 2: Fuel Putting-In**\nFuel putting-in is when fuel is put right into the engine instead of mixing it with air first. This method gives better control over the fuel and air mix, making the engine work better and make less smoke.\n\n**Part 2: Using Car Systems**\n\n**Topic 1: Two-Step vs. Four-Step Engines**\nTwo-step engines are simpler and stronger than four-step engines. But, their design lets some fuel go into the air through the smoke door. Car systems can be used to make these engines work better and be more suitable to use.\n\n**Topic 2: Making Engines Better with Car Systems**\nBy using control system and fuel putting-in, the work of two-step engines can be improved, making them more efficient and friendly to the environment.\n\n**Part 3: Real Life Examples**\n\n**Topic 1: Fuel Putting-In in Motorbikes**\nFuel putting-in has been used in some motorbikes to make them work better and make less smoke. This story tells about a great tool that helps cars run better. It makes the air and fuel mix well which makes the car move smoothly and use less fuel.\n\n**Story 2: How Diesel Cars Work**\nDiesel cars use a special system to run best. This system keeps track of the air in the car's smoke and makes sure it uses the right amount of air and fuel. This makes the car run well and makes less smoke.\n\n**The End of the Story:**\nThe system that controls the car is very important. It makes the car run better and makes less smoke. It uses special ways to put fuel in the car. Because of this, cars are better for the Earth and cost less to run. As we learn more, we will find even better ways to make cars work.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 3745, "idx": 643986, "original text": "This invention relates to an engine control and more particularly to an improved engine transient condition control for a direct injected, internal combustion engine.\nIn spite of the advantages of two cycle engines over four cycle engines in regard to complexity and high specific output, the environmental concerns are causing reappraisal of the continued use of two cycle engines. Specifically, the overlap between the scavenge port and exhaust port opening and closing gives rise to the possibility that unburned hydrocarbons may pass into the atmosphere through the exhaust port.\nIt has been thought that the performance of these engines can be improved by utilizing such methodologies as feedback control and/or direct cylinder fuel injection in order to improve their performance and make their continued use more feasible.\nWith feedback control systems, an engine combustion condition sensor such as an oxygen sensor is positioned in proximity to the combustion chamber or the exhaust system so as to sense the oxygen content of the exhaust gases at the completion of the burning cycle. By determining the amount of oxygen present, it is possible to tell if the engine is running rich or lean. Then, feedback control is possible to maintain the desired fuel/air ratio and, accordingly, improve the exhaust emission control.\nDirect cylinder injection also is useful in improving engine performance. With direct cylinder injection, the amount of fuel injected per cycle can be more accurately controlled and this is particularly important with two cycle engines.\nOf course, the use of direct cylinder injection and feedback control can be utilized with four-cycle engines as well as two-cycle engines. Although the utility may be somewhat more useful with two-cycle engines because of their inherent problems with exhaust emission control, many of the control strategies that are useful with two-cycle engines can also be utilized with four-cycle engines.\nFeedback control generally, however, is most effective when the engine is running primarily in a steady state mode. Under this condition, the feedback control system can make adjustments in the fuel/air ratio so as to bring them to that appropriate for the specific running condition. However, with the normal types of injection control, control under transient conditions such as sudden acceleration are not particularly effective. Also with two cycle engines the increased amount of fuel required also raises the risk of the first injected fuel passing out of the exhaust port.\nIt is, therefore, a principal object of this invention to provide an improved transient control for the direct injection system of an internal combustion engine.\nIt is a further object of this invention to provide the improved transient control for incorporation in a feedback control system for a direct injected internal combustion engine.\nOne of the advantages of fuel injection and specifically direct injection is that the amount of fuel injected for a given cylinder and for each cycle can be accurately controlled. This permits the use of arrangements where the individual cylinders can be feedback controlled independently of each other. However, under transient conditions, the making of an immediate adjustment in the fuel/air ratio in a given cylinder can cause uneven running and can cause backfiring and other unsatisfactory conditions.\nIt is, therefore, a still further object of this invention to provide an improved transient control system for an internal combustion engine wherein the control during transient conditions is done with a specific cylinder other than the instantaneously operating cylinder in order to improve engine smoothness and avoid undesirable combustion conditions.", "hash": "7c05c3fccff9d52e1c483e0677d4d4ca810bff17f4ada52abcf4b79c761cc6c5"}

We will tell the story of a lucky toy collector named Adam who made a lot of money by selling a broken toy. We will also talk about how other collectors try to make money by selling broken toys.\n\nPart 1: Adam's Lucky Story\nFirst, let's talk about Adam. Adam is a toy collector who made a lot of money by selling a broken toy. He bought the toy for a little bit of money and then sold it for a lot more. He was able to make a lot of money because the broken toy was rare and a lot of collectors wanted to have it.\n\nPart 2: How Other Collectors Try to Make Money\nNext, we will talk about how other collectors try to make money by selling broken toys. For example, one collector tried to sell a toy with an extra arm, but they didn't get as much money as they wanted. This shows that some people are willing to pay a lot of money for broken toys.\n\nPart 3: What is a Broken Toy?\nLast, we will talk about what a broken toy is. A broken toy is a toy that is not made the way it was supposed to be made. Broken toys can be not good, but they can also be special. In the story of the broken toy friends, being broken made them special and loved.\n\nPart 4: The Specialness of Broken Toys\nWe will also talk about why broken toys can be special. Broken toys can be special because they are not like others and some people love to have them. In the story of the broken toy friends, being not like others made them special. We will also learn that how special a broken toy is depends on how many people want it. If a lot of people want a broken toy, it can be very special.\n\nPart 5: The Not Good Things About Buying Broken Toys\nIn this part, we will talk about not good things about buying broken toys. We will learn that buying a broken toy can be not good because it may not play well or even not good. It is important to know more before buying a broken toy to make sure that it is good and works well.\n\nIn The End:\nIn the end, we have learned about the idea of broken toys and why they can be special. We have also talked about the not good things about buying broken toys. We have heard how a lucky toy friend got a lot of money from a toy friend that was made wrong. We have also learned how other people have been trying to get money fast by selling broken toy friends. We can use what we learned from this story in other times when we may see broken toys or special toy friends.\n\nWords to Know:\n- Broken toy: A toy that is not like how the toy maker wanted it to be\n- Special: A toy that is not easy to find and a lot of people want\n- Many people want: A lot of people really wanting a toy\n- Toy friend: A person who loves to collect things like special toys, round metal things, or little pictures.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 517, "idx": 159185, "original text": "Amiibo...

{"text": "Lesson: Learning about Keeping Things Safe\n\nIntroduction:\nKeeping things safe is a helpful thing that gives people and businesses a place to put their things. People like it because it's easy and doesn't cost too much. In this lesson, we will learn about keeping things safe, how it helps businesses, and why it was talked about for a money plan in RI country.\n\nMain Idea:\nThe main idea of this lesson is to learn about keeping things safe and how it helps businesses.\n\nSection 1: What is Keeping Things Safe?\nKeeping things safe gives people and businesses a place to put their things. These places can be as small as lockers or as big as big rooms and are usually rented every month. These safe places are made to give a safe and easy solution for people who need extra space to put their things for a short or long time.\n\nSection 2: How it Helps Businesses\nKeeping things safe has helped businesses, especially those in the moving, keeping things safe, big room, and truck services businesses. By giving a cheap and easy solution for people and businesses to put their things, keeping things safe has changed old ways of storage and made new chances for companies to join the market. For example, many businesses have started giving mobile keeping things safe places that can be brought directly to customers' houses or work places, making the keeping things safe process even more easy.\n\nSection 3: Why was Keeping Things Safe Talked about for a Money Plan?\nIn RI country, the leader talked about making the money plan bigger to include moving, keeping things safe, big room, and truck services for the next year's plan. This idea was expected to make an extra $16.6 million in money from buying things. However, the money group finally left out keeping things safe from this group of services in the approved plan.\n\nConclusion:\nIn the end, keeping things safe gives people and businesses a place to put their things. It has helped businesses in the moving, keeping things safe, big room, and truck services businesses by changing old ways of storage and making new chances for companies to join the market. While it was talked about for a bigger money plan, the money group finally left out keeping things safe from this group of services in the approved plan.\n\nWord List:\n- Keeping things safe: A helpful thing that gives people and businesses a place to put their things.\n- Money from buying things: A money taken when you buy things and services.\n- Left out: Not included.\n\nFun Talk Time:\nWhy do you think we put things in a big box when we don't use them? Should we pay for this? Why or why not?", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1976, "idx": 313795, "original text": "This site is operated by a business or businesses owned by Informa PLC and all copyright resides with them.

Lincoln Chafee included moving, storage, warehousing and freight services as part of a previously exempt group of businesses he said would bring the state $16.6 million in added sales-tax revenue. The storage group of services, including \u201cmini-warehouses\u201d and self-storage units, was the only one of four groups removed from the $8.1 billion spending plan the finance committee forwarded to the state House of Representatives. The House could vote on the budget this week.\n\nMembers of the national Self-Storage Association (SSA) and the Rhode Island Self-Storage Association met with the House Finance Committee in recent weeks, arguing that applying sales tax to self-storage tenants would \u201cburden low-income households and other vulnerable members of the community.\u201d The SSA also questioned \u201cthe arbitrary nature of the \u2018services\u2019 tax on this real estate sector, but none other.\u201d\n\nLike many states, Rhode Island is facing severe budget shortfalls.\n\n\u201cIn an era when we\u2019ve often struggled to even maintain funding for many of our programs, we were able to get more money to schools sooner than expected, and also speed up money for distressed communities,\u201d said Rep. Helio Melo, chairman of the House Finance Committee, in a released statement. \u201cIt\u2019s also good for taxpayers because we were able to prevent several tax and fee increases.\u201d", "hash": "6288ed096903c1ae2268c26e30e405e7fee4ac8b9758cd346b90e889fbfb52d3"}
{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Dress Up\n\n**What we will learn:** We will learn about dress up and how it helps in plays.\n\n**Start:** Dress up is when we make clothes and things to wear for people in plays or movies. It is very important because it helps tell the story. It shows who the people are, when the story is, and how it feels. We will learn the easy parts of dress up, like what we need to learn, how we make the clothes, and what is hard about it.\n\n**Part 1: What to Learn**\n\nPeople who do dress up usually learn a lot about making clothes, about plays, or something like that. They also learn more by helping in real plays or movies. Some big schools for dress up are the BO school, the RO school, and the CE school.\n\n**Part 2: Making the Clothes**\n\nWhen we start dress up, we first look at the play or movie story, who the people are, and where it happens. We think about when the story is, where the people are from, and how it should look. When we know what we want, we draw pictures of the clothes. We think about how the people look and move. At the end, we pick the cloth, the shapes, and the extras, and we make the clothes.\n\n**Part 3: What is Hard About Dress Up**\n\nDress up can be hard. We have to think about how much money we have. Sometimes we make new clothes or use old ones. We have to make sure the clothes can be used a lot in plays or movies. We also have to talk with the boss of the play, the people in the play, and others to make sure the play looks and feels right.\n\n**Part 4: The End**\n\nSo, dress up is fun and hard. It needs new ideas, knowing how to do things, and talking with others. By knowing what we need to learn, how we make the clothes, and what is hard about it, we can like dress up more in plays and movies.\n\n**Words to Know:**\n- **Learning a lot:** When we finish learning something very well.\n- **Making clothes:** Making beautiful things to wear.\n- **Plays:** Learning about plays, the stories, and how we do it.\n- **Drawing:** A first picture before the final one.\n**Trims:** Pretty things put on clothes, like lace, ribbons, or buttons.\n\n**Talking to Self:** Why is working together important in making clothes? How does it change the whole show?", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 653, "idx": 308058, "original text": "Rebecca Shannon Butler. General Info. TitlesCostume Shop Manager.

{"text": "Lesson: Keeping Secrets Safe Everywhere\n\nIntroduction:\nKeeping secrets safe is very important. This stops others from knowing things they shouldn't. Every place has rules for this. Some places have stronger rules than others. In this lesson, we will learn about these rules in different places like the US country, CA country, EU place, and more.\n\nSection 1: Keeping Secrets Safe in the US country\nThe US country has big and small rules for keeping secrets safe. Big rules are watched over by a big group, while each small place has its own rules. But, these rules are not as strong as those in other places.\n\nSection 2: Keeping Secrets Safe in the CA country\nCA country has a big rule called the PIPEDA. This rule is for groups that collect, use, or tell personal secrets during their work. The PIPEDA has ten things that groups must do when handling personal secrets.\n\nSection 3: Keeping Secrets Safe in the EU place\nEU place has some of the strongest rules for keeping secrets safe. The GDPR is a rule in the EU place that sets out the rules for keeping secrets safe and privacy for people within the EU place. The GDPR is for any group that handles personal secrets of people in the EU place, no matter where the group is.\n\nSection 4: Keeping Secrets Safe in Other Places\nOther places have different rules for keeping secrets safe. For example, in the AU country, the rule from 1988 looks after the handling of personal secrets by the government and some groups. In the JA country, the APPI rule looks after the handling of personal secrets by businesses and other groups.\n\nConclusion:\nIn the end, rules for keeping secrets safe are different in each place. While some places have stronger protections than others, it's important to know the rules in your place to make sure you're following them. By knowing the rules in your place, you can keep personal secrets safe and avoid trouble.\n\nGlossary:\n- Personal Secrets: Any secret that can tell who a person is.\n- Secret Keeper: A group that collects and sells personal secrets to other groups.\n- Yes Say: A person saying yes to let their personal secret be collected, used, or told.\n- Keeping Secrets Safe: Doing things to keep personal secrets safe from others knowing them without permission, stealing, or using them wrongly.\n- Privacy: The right to keep personal secrets secret.\n\nSelf-Debate Discussion:\nWhat do you think about the US country's rules for keeping secrets safe compared to those in other places? Do you think the US country needs stronger rules for keeping secrets safe? Why or why not?", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 3391, "idx": 167450, "original text": "Browse through DLA Piper\u2019s extensive guide to data regulations and enforcement around the world and it\u2019s clear that the United States stands out compared with more robust protections in places like Canada and Europe. (Elsewhere, protections are lesser or nonexistent.) Many European countries have central agencies dedicated to data protection. In France, individuals must give their consent before a data broker can distribute his or her data. In the United Kingdom, websites have to notify visitors of data-tracking software. Many European countries require data brokers to give individuals the opportunity to review their data profiles, and to show them how to access, change, remove, or otherwise object to the data that has been collected.\n\nThere is some dissonance to the fact that data protections in the U.S. are so slim compared with other regulations in other nations. Culturally, Americans prize the right to privacy. And there are U.S. sectors, like health care, where protecting personal data is paramount. But Americans don't even know which pieces of their personal data is swirling around out there. Your name, age, past addresses, political party enrollment, whether you own a home\u2014sure, you might expect that kind of stuff is to be shared by marketers and others who deal in data. But data brokers specialize in inference, too, so they can figure out all kinds of super-specific details about who you are and how you live.\n\n\"For example, a data broker might infer that an individual with a boating license has an interest in boating, that a consumer has a technology interest based on the purchase of a Wired magazine subscription, or that a consumer who has bought two Ford cars has loyalty to that brand,\" wrote the Federal Trade Commission in a report on Big Data this week.\n\nThe FTC has been pushing for Congress to do something about free wheeling data brokers for the better part of the last decade. All this data collection is happening without consumer consent, and some the profiling that seems innocuous is actually harmful, the commission argues.\n\nOne person profiled as low-income might be inundated with sub-prime mortgage offers. Another person profiled as a motorcyclist might be flagged by insurance companies for higher rates. The categories into which consumers are sorted are incredibly detailed, and they\u2019re based on a mix of government data (like the political donations you made), publicly available data (like the relationship status on your Facebook profile), and commercial data (like how Aquafresh Extreme Clean is your favorite brand of toothpaste, a nugget of data that\u2019s linked to you because you swiped your CVS rewards card before paying).\n\nBig data knows your net worth. It knows that you have a dog. It knows when you\u2019re most likely to use a coupon. It knows your favorite brand of detergent. It knows your dress size. It knows about your last speeding ticket, and when you got the oil changed. It knows you have a hunting license. It knows whether you're pregnant\u2014and often before you have a chance to share the news. The New York Times in 2012 told the alarming story of a teenager whose father angrily complained to Target for sending his young daughter promotional mailings for cribs and baby clothes. It later turned out the girl was pregnant, just as her data profile predicted. She simply hadn\u2019t told her parents yet.", "hash": "255cb5e976c9481bdfd915c7d58d17276e7de5966eda83f5fb1ebb1481f02b2d"}

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Food Bags\n\nStart:\nFood bags are an easy way to have healthy and yummy meals when you're out and about. In this lesson, we will learn about the different kinds of food bags, why they're good, and how to pick the right one for you.\n\nPart 1: What are Food Bags?\nFood bags are small, one-meal packages that have a meal or snack ready to eat. They are usually made of a bendy material like plastic or tin, and can be closed up tight to keep the food inside fresh. Food bags come in many different types, including real meals, soups, stocks, and sauces.\n\nPart 2: Why Food Bags are Good\nThere are some reasons why eating food from a bag is good. First, they are easy - you can take them with you no matter where you're going, whether it's to work, school, or sports practice. Second, they are often healthier than other kinds of packed foods because they have fewer extra things and things that keep them fresh. Lastly, food bags are good for the Earth because they use less packing than other kinds of food containers.\n\nPart 3: Picking the Right Food Bag for You\nWhen picking a food bag, there are some things to think about. First, think about what kind of meal or snack you want - do you like something salty or sweet? Next, look at the food inside the bag - look for options that have low salt and sugar, and high protein and fiber. Lastly, think about the brand and maker of the bag - some companies are better when it comes to getting ingredients and treating workers well.\n\nPart 4: Examples of Food Bags\nHere are some examples of different kinds of food bags:\n- Real meals: These bags have a full meal, like beef stew or chicken dish. They are often made with fresh, season ingredients and follow old recipes.\n- Soups: These bags have warm, yummy soup that's good for a quick lunch or dinner. They have many different tastes, like tomato, vegetable, and chicken noodle.\n- Broths: These bags have a strong soup that can be used to make soups, stews, and sauces. They have many different tastes, like chicken, beef, and vegetable.\n- Sauces: These bags have a tasty sauce that can be used on pasta, roasted vegetables, or cooked meats. They have many different tastes, like marinara, Alfredo, and balsamic vinegar.\n\nEnd:\nIn this story, we learned about food bags - what they are, why they are good, and how to pick the right one for you. We also looked at some examples of different types of food bags, like real meals, soups, broths, and sauces. By knowing the different choices, you can decide which food bag is best for you.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1853, "idx": 343486, "original text": "Food Spy: Tom Aikens\n\nThursday 9 April 2009 16:47 BST\n\nDaylesford Organic has cooked up a new range of food pouches, including real meals, soups, stocks and sauces.

{"text": "Story: The Memory of Body Feelings\n\n## Chapter 1: Saying Hello to Body Feelings Memory\n\nBody feelings memory is about how our bodies remember certain experiences even after they are over. This memory helps our bodies stay healthy and not get too excited. In this story, we will learn about body feelings memory, why it's important, and how it works.\n\n## Chapter 2: Understanding the Idea\n\n- Body feelings memory is about how our bodies feel and react.\n- The way our bodies feel changes because of different things that happen inside us.\n- Our bodies can become used to these changes, and this is how they \"remember\".\n\n## Chapter 3: Real-Life Examples\n\n- When we do something that makes our bodies feel a certain way, like running fast, our bodies will \"remember\" this feeling.\n- After a while, our bodies will get used to this feeling. This is like when you keep running, and it doesn't feel as hard anymore.\n- This body feelings memory is important for keeping us healthy and strong.\n\n## Chapter 4: Everyday Situations\n\n- Body feelings memory is very important when we need to do things quickly, like when we play sports or when we are surprised.\n- Sometimes, when people are sick, their body feelings memory might not work properly, and this can make them feel worse.\n\n## Chapter 5: Questions to Think About\n\n- How is body feelings memory different from remembering things in our head?\n- Can the way we live, like what we eat or how much we exercise, change our body feelings memory?\n- How do the tiny parts of our bodies help with body feelings memory?\n\n## Words to Know\n\n- Different things that happen inside us: Changes in our bodies\n- Used to: Getting familiar with something\n- Feel worse: Not feeling well\n\n## The End\n\nIn this story, we learned about body feelings memory, why it's important for staying healthy, and how it works. We talked about the idea, real-life examples, and everyday situations related to this memory. We also thought about some questions to help us understand better.

The present study examined the hypothesis that this modulatory effect involves alterations in postreceptor signal transduction. To quantify the degree of cellular downregulation induced by an episode of alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation, tissues were pretreated for 30 min with 10(-5) M phenylephrine (PE), washed for 10 min to cause complete relaxation, and activated with increasing concentrations of KCl.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Enough\n\n## Start\n\nIn this lesson, we will learn about the idea of enough and how it can be seen in different parts of our life. We will learn about the rules of enough, how they are different from other rules, and how they can help share things equally.\n\n## Part 1: What is Enough?\n\nEnough means that there is a lot to share. It is different from not enough, which means that there is not a lot to share. In a world with enough, everyone can get what they need.\n\n## Part 2: The Rules of Enough\n\nThere are some rules that help us understand enough. These include:\n\n1. No More Cost: In a world with enough, making more of something doesn't cost much. This means that after you start making something, making more is easy.\n\n2. More People, More Value: As more people use something, it becomes better. This is because more people lead to more sharing and working together.\n\n3. Everyone Can Use: In a world with enough, everyone can use what they need.\n\n4. Sharing Instead of Owning: In a world with enough, people share things instead of keeping them. This helps share things in a good way.\n\n## Part 3: Seeing Enough in Different Parts\n\nEnough can be seen in different parts of our life, like going places, talking, and power. Here are some examples:\n\n1. Going Places: With electric cars and car services like Uber and Lyft, going places is becoming easier. People can now go places easily without having a car.\n\n2. Talking: The internet has made talking easier. Anyone can make and share things with almost no cost. This has made it easier for everyone to get information and knowledge.\n\n3. Power: Power from the sun and wind is making power easier to get. These sources are always there and do not go away. This means that as more people use these sources, making power becomes cheaper, making power easier to get for everyone.\n\n## Part 4: The End\n\nIn the end, the idea of enough gives us a new way to see the world. By focusing on the rules of enough, we can share things equally and help our world. By using the rules of enough in different parts of our life, we can make a world where everyone can get what they need.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 509, "idx": 342615, "original text": "Very interesting idea.

What is a special tooth cover?\n2. Why are special tooth covers important?\n3. How do special tooth covers work?\n4. What are some common things used in tooth covers?\n5. How long can special tooth covers work?\n\n### Part 3: Fun Examples and Real Life Stories\n\nLet's think about a story where a person wears tooth covers and has a mouth problem. The person goes to see their tooth doctor, who gives them special tooth covers to stop the problem from getting worse. The tooth doctor explains that the covers will release a little bit of a special thing over time, which will get rid of any remaining problem things and stop new problems from happening.\n\nNow let's look at some specific examples of how special tooth covers work:\n\n- A common thing used in tooth covers works by breaking down the problem things, which ultimately gets rid of them.\n- Another thing used in tooth covers works by stopping the growth of problem things and preventing them from making more of themselves.\n\n### Part 4: Words to Know\n\n- Special thing: A thing that gets rid of or stops the growth of problem things.\n- Tooth cover: A thing placed inside the mouthpiece of a tooth cover to make it more comfortable, fit better, and look better.\n- Special delivery system: A thing that can release a special thing slowly over time.\n- Problem thing: A type of thing that can cause problems in the mouth and other parts of the body.\n\n### The End\n\nIn the end, special tooth covers are an important tool in stopping mouth problems. By releasing small amounts of special things over time, these covers can effectively get rid of problem things and stop new problems from happening.

Big boats are important for showing power and taking care of big sea areas.\n\n**Section 2: Kinds of Big Boats**\nThere are two main kinds of big boats: regular and powered by special energy. Regular boats use steam to make electricity for their catapults and other systems, while special energy boats use special reactors to give a never-ending source of energy. Special energy boats can go faster and carry more planes than regular boats.\n\n**Section 3: How does a Big Boat work?**\nA big boat has several important parts that make it work well. These include the deck, where planes take off and land; the storage area, where planes are kept when not being used; and the catapult and catching gear, which help launch and bring back planes. The boat also has a crew of sailors who make sure everything works.\n\n**Section 4: Why Big Boats are Important**\nBig boats are very important in modern sea forces. They give a place for air actions, allowing for strikes against bad guys from far away. This makes them valuable in both attacking and defending plans. Also, they act as command centers for sea actions, working with other ships and submarines to achieve big goals.\n\n**Section 5: Real Examples**\nOne example of a big boat in action is the boat named RR, which was sent to the PG sea because of problems between the US country and IR country. Another example is the boat named QE, which recently finished its first mission in the ME sea.\n\n**Ending**\nAt the end, big boats are very important for showing strength and taking care of big water areas.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning about Number Pictures - Gap Look\n\n**Objective:** To teach kids about number pictures, especially the Gap Picture, and show them how to spot gaps in the picture.\n\n**Level:** Kindergarten\n\n**Duration:** 1 hour\n\n**Materials:** Chalkboard, chalk, paper, crayons\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nThe Gap Picture is a fun number picture that shows how much something might change. People use it to decide if they should trade things like toys or stickers. Today, we will learn about the Gap Picture and how to find gaps in it.\n\n**Section 1: What is the Gap Picture?**\n\nThe Gap Picture shows how much something might change. We use it to see if something might get bigger or smaller. When the Gap Picture is big, it means something might change a lot soon. When the \"V\" is low, it means that people think the market will be calm and stable.\n\n**Chapter 2: Looking at Gaps in the \"V\" Picture**\n\nGaps in the \"V\" picture happen when the price of the \"V\" goes up or down quickly, making a gap between the last day's close and the new day's open. There are different types of gaps that can show up on the \"V\" picture, like:\n\n1. Big Gap: This happens when the \"V\" moves quickly in one way, showing a big change in how people feel about the market.\n\n2. Run Gap: This happens when the \"V\" keeps moving in the same way after making a big gap.\n\n3. Tired Gap: This happens when the \"V\" moves quickly in one way but then goes the other way, showing that people are tired of the trend.\n\n4. Measure Gap: This happens when the \"V\" moves a certain distance in one way and then goes back a bit, making a gap.\n\nTo look at gaps in the \"V\" picture, you should look at what's happening around the gap, like the overall way of the market and any news that may have changed how people feel about the market. You should also think about the size of the gap, as bigger gaps tend to be more important than smaller ones.\n\n**Chapter 3: Real Examples**\n\nLet's say that you are looking at the \"V\" picture and you see a big gap that happened last week. You should look at what news or market trends may have made this gap. For example, if the gap happened after a big news was told, it may show that people were reacting to the news.\n\nNext, let's say that you are looking at the \"V\" picture and you see a tired gap that happened a few weeks ago. You should look at whether the market has since gone back a big part of the gap, showing that the trend is tired. If so, you may want to think about staying neutral in the market until a new trend comes.\n\n**End:**\n\nIn this lesson, we have learned about the \"V\" and how to look at gaps in its picture. By understanding these gaps and what they mean, we can make better choices about buying or selling things. As we keep learning about market signs, we will understand more about how to read market data and make smart choices.\n\n**Words to Know:**\n\n- \"V\": A measure of how much people think the market will change\n- \"Market\": A place where people buy and sell things\n- \"Trend\": The general way something is going\n- \"News\": Information about recent events\n- \"Gap\": A space where something is missing", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 906, "idx": 276084, "original text": "VIX Intraday Gap Review.. The VIX cash contract has been heading down again, with a certain urgency to it. Once we have a good look we can see that there are a few gaps that can throw a monkey wrench into the bullish and bearish scenarios of the VIX. The first gap down at the bottom is still open, while we also have two gaps still open above present prices. Which set of open gaps is going to get closed off first?. We can see a huge single spike to the upside, which can remain as the spike to beat, but it may get matched with an equally long spike to the downside. I would love to see the opening gap in November get closed off, before the then next rally of fear, starts to take off again. Even if it doesn\u2019t get closed off we could get a H&S type setup as well..

{"text": "Lesson: Making Things Puffy\n\nIntroduction:\nMaking things puffy in a high place is different from making things puffy in a low place. In this lesson, we will learn about how high places change the way things puff up and how to change our recipes so things turn out just right.\n\nCore Value:\nThe main idea of this lesson is learning how high places change the way things puff up and how to change our recipes so things come out just right.\n\nSection 1: How High Places Change Puffing\nTopic 1: Thin Air\nIn high places, the air is thinner than in low places. This changes the way things puff up and keep wet.\n\nQuestion: How does thin air change puffing things?\nAnswer: Thin air makes things puff up more and dry out quicker. Water also dries up faster in high places because water turns into steam at lower hotness.\n\nTopic 2: Making It Puffy\nWhen we make things puffy, we add gas to a mixture to create little air pockets. In high places, making things puffy happens faster because the air is thinner.\n\nQuestion: What happens when we make things puffy in high places?\nAnswer: In high places, the little gas bubbles join together into big, rough pockets in a mixture. This makes a cake with a rough texture.\n\nTopic 3: The Push Inside a Puffing Mixture\nIn high places, the push inside a puffing mixture can get so big that the little walls stretch too much and break.\n\nQuestion: What happens when little walls break in high places?\nAnswer: The result is breaking little walls, which means the cake will have a rough texture.\n\nSection 2: Changing Recipes for High Places\nTopic 1: Ingredients\nTo change a recipe for high places, you may need to add more liquid and things that make it puffy. This is because water dries up faster and making things puffy happens faster in high places.\n\nQuestion: How much liquid and puffy things should I add to my recipe?\nAnswer: You may need to add up to 25% more liquid and puffy things to your recipe to make up for the effects of high places.\n\nTopic 2: How Hot and How Long\nIn high places, how hot and how long we cook may also need to be changed. Food will cook faster and may turn brown more quickly because the air is thinner.\n\nQuestion: How can I change how hot and how long when making things puffy in high places?\nAnswer: You may need to make the oven less hot by 25\u00b0F (14\u00b0C) and cook less long by 5-8 minutes to make up for the effects of high places.\n\nSection 3: Real Examples\nExample 1: Cakes\nTo change a cake recipe for high places, you may need to add more liquid and things that make it puffy. For example, if a recipe asks for 1 cup of powder, 1 cup of sweet stuff, 1 little spoon of puffy powder, and 1 cup of milk, you may need to use 1 1/4 cups of powder, 1 1/4 cups of sweet stuff, 1 1/2 little spoons of puffy powder, and 1 1/4 cups of milk.\n\nExample 2: Making Cookies\nTo make cookies at a high place, you may need to add more rising stuff. For example, if a recipe says to use 1 big spoon of flour, 1/2 big spoon of sugar, and a little baking soda, you may need to use 1 and 1/4 big spoons of flour, 1/2 big spoon of sugar, and a little more baking soda.\n\nIn the end:\nWhen we bake at a high place, it can be hard. We need to change the recipe a bit. If we understand what happens when we bake at a high place and make the changes, we can make yummy cookies. By following these tips, you will be good at baking at high places.\n\nWords to know:\n- High place: a place that is very high from the ground\n- Rising stuff: things we add in dough to make it fluffy\n- Covering: the outside part of something\n- Change to air: when a liquid becomes air\n- In the end: what we understand from a story or a talk", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 4186, "idx": 126802, "original text": "\n\nMonthly Feature:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe weight of air is a phenomenon most cooks seldom contemplate. But if you live in Denver, Calgary, Johannesburg, or a host of other high-altitude locales, you'll face fallen cakes and overflowing batters if you don't. As elevation rises, air pressure falls, which means that bakers living at 3,000 feet (1,000 meters) will see different results than lowland bakers. Since most recipes are designed for sea level, high-altitude success requires a few clever adjustments. Low air pressure has two main effects on baked goods: They will rise more easily, and lose moisture faster; liquids evaporate more quickly since water boils at lower temperatures at high altitude. As leavening occurs faster, gas bubbles tend to coalesce into large, irregular pockets in a batter or dough. The result? A coarse-textured cake. Alternatively, the pressure inside a rising batter can become so great, that cell walls stretch beyond their maximum and burst. Collapsing cell walls means the cake falls too. Quicker evaporation also has several ramifications. It makes baked goods more prone to sticking. And sugar becomes more concentrated. Some cakes won't set. Or by the time they do set, they've become dry and crumbly. Here are some guidelines for converting favorite recipes. To reinforce cell walls, adjust sugar and fat (the tenderizers), eggs and sometimes flour (the strengtheners). And reducing leavening agents relieves the pressure within the cells. Try one or two adjustments at a time and note the results. Where a range is given, use the smaller adjustment first. As altitude goes up, more adjustment may be necessary. Each month, we've featured a different kitchen science article by the Inquisitive Cooks, Anne Gardiner and Sue Wilson, with tips, facts, and unique ideas to give you a whole new perspective on cooking. View other articles. Also visit Ask the Inquisitive Cooks for a weekly kitchen science Q&A! What happens if you leave a bottle of milk in the fridge too long, or if your yogurt sits out in the sun? You get rancid yuck, right? But somehow, if done just the right way, a similar process can result in fragrant, pungent, yummy cheese.\n\n\n\nHow can this possibly happen? Check out our Cheese Webcast and watch as we investigate the creamy, rich--and sometimes stinky world of cheese.\n\nWith the exception of angel and sponge cakes, line baking pans for cakes with parchment, or grease well and dust with flour. Use cupcake papers for muffins so they don't stick. Subtract 1 - 3 tablespoons (15 - 45 ml) sugar per cup (250 ml). A mottled surface on a cake indicates too much sugar. Then if needed, subtract 1 - 2 tablespoons (15 - 25 ml) fat per cup (250 ml) of fat. Add an additional egg or egg white. This adds more liquid (see #5), as well as protein, which coagulates and makes the cake set faster. Some cooks also add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) more flour per cup (250 ml) flour. Decrease baking powder or baking soda by 1/8 to 1/2 teaspoon (.5 ml to 2 ml) for every teaspoon (5 ml) called for in cake recipes. You may find that quick breads (biscuits, muffins, coffee cakes), squares, and cookies, which have a stronger cell structure, don't need adjusting. To allow for moisture loss, add 1 - 2 tablespoons (15 - 25 ml) extra liquid per cup of liquid. For elevations above 4,921 feet (1,500 meters), add up to 4 tablespoons (60 ml) liquid as needed. Decrease the rising time for yeast breads and make sure the dough rises only until double in bulk. Allow the dough to rise twice before shaping. Try using 20 percent less yeast. Beat egg whites for foam cakes (angel, sponge, chiffon) just until soft peaks form, so they're still elastic enough to expand as the batter rises. Increase baking temperatures by 25 degrees F (15 C) to allow baking to set before cells overstretch. Check for doneness early and reduce baking time if necessary. Please share your high-altitude baking experiences, problems, tips, and solutions in the Forum. Your advice will be truly valued by those new to the challenge of cooking in the clouds.

{"text": "Lesson: Understanding Taxes on Things We Buy\n\nIntroduction:\nTaxes on things we buy from other countries are called tariffs. They are like extra costs that our government puts on these things. They do this to help the people who make these things in our own country. But sometimes, this can also make things a little hard for people who trade things with other countries. In this lesson, we will talk about how these tariffs affect farming. We will use the example of how the taxes from CH city on things that farmers in the US sell.\n\nSection 1: What are Tariffs?\n\n**Topic:** What are tariffs?\n**Question:** Why do countries put tariffs on things they buy from other countries?\n**Answer:** Tariffs are extra costs that our government puts on things we buy from other countries. They do this to help the people who make these things in our own country. Countries put tariffs on things to protect their own industries from things that are cheaper from other countries, to get more money, or to control trade.\n\n**Topic:** How do tariffs affect farming?\n**Question:** How do tariffs affect farmers and the farming industry?\n**Answer:** Tariffs can be both good and bad for farming. On one side, tariffs can protect our own farming by making things from other countries more costly. This makes our own goods more popular. But, tariffs can also hurt farmers if other countries do the same to us. This can mean less selling of their crops and lower prices.\n\nSection 2: How CH city's Tariffs Affect U.S. Farm Goods\n\n**Topic:** The Example of Sweet Cherries\n**Question:** How did CH city's tariffs affect the sweet cherry farmers in the US?\n**Answer:** When CH city's tariff went from a little to a lot last summer, right in the middle of when cherries were being picked, selling to CH city went from the most profitable to the least. Farmers in WA state, the biggest place where sweet cherries are grown in the US, saw their big crop lose a lot of money in one night.\n\n**Topic:** How did the farmers feel?\n**Question:** How did farmers feel about the tariffs from CH city?\n**Answer:** Farmers were upset about losing money and how it affected their work. They understood why there were trade problems with CH city but they were frustrated by how fast and how big the tariff increased.\n\nSection 3: Questions for Thinking More\n\n**Topic:** Thinking about the Effect of Tariffs\n**Question:** Should countries put tariffs on things they buy from other countries?\n**Answer:** This is a hard question that depends on many things. On one side, tariffs can protect our own industries and create jobs. On the other side, they can make other countries do the same to us and hurt farmers and other businesses that rely on selling things to other countries. In the end, the decision to put tariffs should be thought about carefully, thinking about the good and the bad things that can happen.\n\nConclusion:\nIn this lesson, we have talked about how tariffs affect farming, using the example of CH city's tariffs on things that farmers in the US sell. We have learned about what tariffs are and how they affect farming, as well as the example of sweet cherries. We've thought hard about the good and bad of rules about trading, and how they might affect different people.

It\u2019s made it extra painful because Chinese consumers pay a premium for American produce.\n\nGrowers fear they\u2019ll lose their best foreign market to competitors in Turkey and South America and never get it back. They worry about where this trade war is heading.\n\n\u201cBecause we are such a small share, we really don\u2019t like to be used as the pawn,\u201d said Frank Davis.\n\nSoybeans grown in the Midwest are a much bigger player, accounting for 60 percent of the $20 billion of food exports to China.

Farmworkers lost another $200 million in income.\n\nSupporters of President Trump say farmers need to keep the big picture in mind.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of farmers are feeling the pain right now,\u201d said Doug Erickson, a senator in the Washington state Legislature. \u201cBut I think a lot of them understand it\u2019s important for America overall to have fair trade relationships.\u201d\n\nAgriculture officials say that day is coming.\n\n\u201cCertainly, by next fall, we will be back to a more robust, more even fair tariff-free trading relationship,\u201d said Bill Northey, USDA Undersecretary.\n\nFarmers hurt by the tariff war are getting some relief from a one-time $12 billion aid package.

Material: Different things they are made from have different heat, how long they last, and non-stick stuff. For example, metal lasts a long time and can take a lot of heat, while non-stick is easy to clean but may not last as long.\n\n2. Size: Pick pots and pans that are the right size for the amount of food you plan to cook. Bigger pots and pans are good for big families or those who cook a lot of food at once.\n\n3. Shape: The shape of the pot or pan can change how it works. For example, round pots are best for making soup or stew, while oval pots are better for simmering.\n\n4. Handle: Pick pots and pans with handles that are easy to hold and move around.\n\n5. Price: Pots and pans can cost a little or a lot. Pick pots and pans that fit what you can pay and what you need.\n\nSection 3: Real-World Examples\n\nLet's say you need to buy a new frying pan for your kitchen. You should think about the following things:\n\n1. Material: You might want to pick a metal pan because it lasts a long time and heats up evenly.\n\n2. Size: A 10-inch pan might be big enough for most people cooking at home, but if you plan to cook for a lot of people, you might need a bigger pan.\n\n3. Shape: An oval-shaped pan might be better for cooking vegetables or meat. Handle: Find a pan with a nice, easy handle that stays cool when you use it.\n\n5. Price: You might want to pick a pan that isn't too expensive but is still good.\n\nConclusion:\nPicking the right pots and pans for your kitchen can be hard.

Also, we can look at what's happening around the child to see if there are things that might be making the problem worse.\n\n## Part 3: Questions to Think About\nNow let's think about some questions. Why do you think some children and teenagers have feelings and behaviors that others do not? Are there things that make someone more likely to have these feelings or behaviors? How can we help before these problems get bigger?\n\n## Word List\n- Family: The people related to you\n- Body: What you are made of\n- Around them: The things and people near you\n- Feelings and behaviors: How you feel and act\n- Trouble sitting still: When you find it hard to sit still or focus\n- Different: Not the same\n\n## Ending\nIn the end, understanding feelings and behaviors of children and teenagers is very important. This can help us see and help with problems in young people. By looking at why these problems happen and learning from real stories, we can understand how and why these problems start. By thinking about these questions, we can think more about feelings and behaviors. This will help us understand and help with problems in ourselves and others.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 485, "idx": 654558, "original text": "Child and Adolescent Psychopathology.

{"text": "Story: Learning about Making Fire\n\n### Part 1: New Ideas\nMaking fire is about starting a fire with wood and letting it burn until it makes heat or a big fire. People do this for many reasons like cooking, staying warm, or just enjoying a fire outside. In this story, we will learn about the different kinds of wood that can be used for making fire, the different ways to start a fire, and how to be safe when making fire.\n\n### Part 2: Real-Life Stories and Things That Really Happened\nLet's pretend you want to go camping and cook a meal on a fire. You need to find some wood. You can get it from the area around you or bring it with you. It's good to pick the right wood for your fire - hard woods like oak burn longer and give more warmth than soft woods like pine. After you find the wood, you can use a match to start the fire. Be sure to make the fire in a safe place, far from things that can catch fire like tents or sleeping bags. Always watch the fire and have water close by if you need it.\n\n### Chatting Time\nYou might wonder if it's better to get wood that's already dry or to dry it yourself. Wood that's already dry burns easier and gives more warmth. But, some people like to dry their own wood because they think it lets them make a better fire. What do you think? Do you like dry wood or would you dry it yourself?\n\n### Word List\n- Wood: Something from trees that we can burn to stay warm or make a fire.\n- Hard wood: A kind of wood that's hard and burns for a long time.\n- Soft wood: A kind of wood that's not hard and burns fast.\n- Dry wood: Wood that's dry and clean so it can burn well.\n- Firestarter: Something used to light a fire.\n\n### Wrapping Up\nIn our talk, we learned about different kinds of wood we can use to burn, how to start a fire, and how to be safe. We also talked about if it's better to get dry wood or to dry it yourself. By knowing these things, we can use what we learned when we need to burn wood.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 558, "idx": 429990, "original text": "Perfect Hickory Grillwood.

The chemoprotective effects are either direct scavenging of reactive molecules or indirect effects, such as enzyme activity alteration. Exposure of cultures of isolated rat hepatocytes to catechin (0.01-1.0 mM), a plant phenolic flavonoid, and subsequent addition of 2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF) resulted in an enhanced binding of AAF metabolites to hepatocellular DNA. Incubations of hepatocytes with catechin and S. typhimurium demonstrated no mutagenicity of catechin. At 1.0 and 5.0 mM concentrations of catechin with AAF and 30-min incubation with hepatocytes prior to plating there was inhibition of AAF-induced mutagenicity. However, at 0.5 mM of catechin there was a significant enhancement in mutagenicity. The increase in DNA binding of AAF in the cultures of hepatocytes is due to the alteration of metabolism by exposure to catechin. Catechin increases both N-hydroxylation and deacetylation pathways in the hepatocytes producing increases in N-hydroxy-AAF and aminofluorene. Both of these metabolites are important in AAF intermediates binding with DNA. The short-term incubation of catechin, AAF, hepatocytes, and S. typhimurium in the mutagenesis assay is not sufficient for induction of metabolic pathways. However, previously reported inhibition of detoxification pathways and/or scavenging of the proximate carcinogen can occur to alter mutagenesis in a dose-dependent manner.", "hash": "77d6ea1c842a08db870a584e279bde3734157ad39d0f92baf789c68c2c3c8b61"}

{"text": "Lesson: Learning to Make Things\n\n**Objective:** To show kids the different ways we can make things.\n\n**Introduction:** Making things means creating stuff from basic things. There are many ways to make things, and each way has its own good and bad sides. In this lesson, we will learn about some common ways to make things.\n\n**Part 1: Pouring**\n\nPouring is when we put a liquid thing into a shape and let it become hard in the shape we want. This is usually used to make things from metal.\n\n**Topic 1.1: Sand Pouring**\n\nSand pouring is a kind of pouring that uses sand to make the shape. We pack the sand around the pattern, then we take the pattern away and pour the melted metal into the shape made of sand.\n\n**Questions:**\n- What is sand pouring?\n- How do we do sand pouring?\n- What is good and what is bad about sand pouring?\n\n**Topic 1.2: Wax Pouring**\n\nWax pouring is a kind of pouring that uses wax or plastic to make the shape. We cover the pattern with a hard material. Then we melt the pattern away, leaving a hollow shape that we fill with melted metal.\n\n**Questions:**\n- What is wax pouring?\n- How do we do wax pouring?\n- What is good and what is bad about wax pouring?\n\n**Part 2: Cutting**\n\nCutting is when we take away parts of a thing using a sharp tool. This is usually used to make parts that need to be very exact.\n\n**Topic 2.1: Turning**\n\nTurning is a kind of cutting that involves spinning the thing while we apply a sharp tool to it. This is usually used to make things that are round.\n\n**Questions:**\n- What is turning?\n- How do we do turning?\n- What is good and what is bad about turning?\n\n**Topic 2.2: Moving Cut**\n\nMoving cut is a kind of cutting that involves moving a sharp tool in a straight line across the thing. This is usually used to make things that are flat.\n\n**Questions:**\n- What is moving cut?\n- How do we do moving cut?\n- What is good and what is bad about moving cut?\n\n**Part 3: Joining**\n\nJoining is when we stick two pieces of metal together by making them very hot until they melt and then stick them together. This is usually used to make big things and tools.\n\n**Topic 3.1: Spark Joining**\n\nSpark joining is a kind of joining that uses sparks to heat and melt the metal. This is usually used to make big things and tools.\n\n**Questions:**\n- What is spark joining?\n- How do we do spark joining?\n- What is good and bad about putting pieces of metal together with electricity?\n\n**Part 3.2: Putting Metal Pieces Together with Heat and Electricity**\n\nPutting metal pieces together with heat and electricity is a way that uses the heat from electricity to melt and join the metal. This is often used when making parts of cars.\n\n**Questions:**\n- What is putting metal pieces together with heat and electricity?\n- How does putting metal pieces together with heat and electricity work?\n- What is good and bad about putting metal pieces together with heat and electricity?\n\n**Ending:**\n\nMaking things is very important when we want to have new goods and items. Knowing the different ways to make things can help us choose the best way for what we need.

When workers are sick, they can stay home, which helps stop sickness from spreading at work. Also, having time off when you're sick can stop workers from having money problems when they can't work because they're sick.\n\nQuestions and Answers:\n- Why is it good to have time off when you're sick?\n- How does having time off when you're sick help workers?\n- What are some reasons why a worker might need to have time off when they're sick?\n\nPart 2: Why It's Good to Have Time Off to Look After Your Kids\n\nHaving time off to look after your kids is also important because it means workers can take care of their kids when schools are closed or when there are other problems with looking after the kids. This time off can stop workers from missing work because of sudden problems with looking after the kids, and make sure they can still do their work well.\n\nQuestions and Answers:\n- Why is it good to have time off to look after your kids?\n- How does having time off to look after your kids help workers?\n- What are some reasons why a worker might need to have time off to look after their kids?\n\nPart 3: How the \"FF law\" Affects Bosses\n\nWhile the \"FF law\" is a big help for workers, it also means bosses have to do some new things. Bosses have to make sure they follow the rule and give workers the time off when they're sick or need to look after their kids that the law says they should have. Also, bosses might need to change when people work or other rules to make the new time off rules work.\n\nQuestions and Answers:\n- How does the \"FF law\" affect bosses?\n- What are some things that bosses can do to get ready for the new break rules?\n- What are some tough things that bosses might have to deal with because of the FFCRA?\n\nIn the end:\nIn the end, the FFCRA is a big step to make sure that workers get paid when they are sick or need to take care of their kids. These things are very important for workers and bosses, because they help people feel safe and healthy at work. By knowing how important it is to get paid when sick or taking care of kids, workers and bosses can work together to make work a better place for everyone.\n\nWords to know:\n- FFCRA: A new rule that helps families during a big sickness\n- Paid Sick Leave: Time off work that bosses pay for when workers are sick\n- Paid Childcare-Related Leave: Time off work that bosses pay for when workers need to take care of their kids because school is closed or there is a problem with their normal childcare.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 550, "idx": 420739, "original text": "New Federal Law Entitles Employees to Paid Sick Leave and Paid Childcare-Related Leave Due to COVID-19.

{"text": "Lesson: How to Learn to Read and Understand Stories\n\n**Introduction**\n\nHello to the first lesson on how to learn to read and understand stories! In this lesson, we will learn how to read and understand simple stories like the one above. By the end of this lesson, you will be able to find important details, understand simple words, and think about what the story means.\n\n**Section 1: Reading Stories**\n\nThe first step in reading stories is to find the main points of the story. In the story above, we can see that a toy company has made more toys in the last few months. This is a big win for the toy company, and it is probably the main point of the story.\n\nNext, we can look at the words from the boss of the toy company, William. These words give us more details and information about the company's win. For example, William says that the company had a very good year and has made toys for many new friends. This shows that the company is growing and making more toys for more friends.\n\nFinally, we can see that the toy company has also hired more helpers and moved to a bigger place in AB city. This gives us more proof of the company's growth and win.\n\n**Section 2: Understanding Simple Words**\n\nStories often have simple words that may be new to readers. It is important to understand these words to fully understand the story.\n\nIn the story above, we see the phrase \"more toys.\" This means the company has made more toys than before. The toy company has made more toys in the last few months, which shows that the company has been successful.\n\nAnother word used in the story is \"friends.\" In stories, \"friends\" usually means people or groups that help each other. The toy company has made toys for many new friends, showing that it has made successful friendships with others.\n\n**Section 3: Thinking About What the Story Means**\n\nOnce we have found the main points of the story and understood the simple words, we can start to think about what the story means.\n\nFirst, we can see that the toy company has grown a lot in a short amount of time. This shows that the company is doing well and will probably keep doing well in the future.\n\nSecond, we can see that the toy company is making toys for more friends. This suggests that the company is not only growing in size, but also in friendships.\n\nFinally, we can see that the toy company has made a bigger place for its helpers. This shows that the company is planning for long-term success and is ready to do what it takes to reach that goal.\n\n**Easy Words**\n- Find Things Helper: A big box used by find things helpers to find and show things on the web.\n- Friends: People or groups that work together to do something.\n\n**End**\n\nIn this fun time, we learned how to read and understand big people news by finding important things, understanding big words, and thinking about the news. By doing these things, we can learn and know a lot about big people news.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 373, "idx": 312153, "original text": "Gigablast has grown its search engine index from 450 Million to 650 million pages during the last few months.. .\u201d Adds Wells, \u201cWe have had an extremely strong business year in 2004 and have signed up many new clients.\u201d.

{"text": "Fun Time: How Magic Push Helpers Work\n\n**Goal:** Learn how magic push helpers work, what they do, and how they can be used to measure how hard a liquid pushes.\n\n**Start:** Magic push helpers are things that measure changes in magic push caused by a change in how hard a liquid pushes. These helpers are used a lot in many places, including chip making, to measure how hard a liquid pushes.\n\n**Important Thing:** The important thing of this fun time is to explain how magic push helpers work, what they do, and how they can be used to measure how hard a liquid pushes.\n\n**Part 1: What are Magic Push Helpers?**Part 1: What are Magic Push Helpers?**\nMagic push helpers are things that measure changes in magic push caused by a change in how hard a liquid pushes. They have a box, a push-sensitive skin, and a magic stick. When a liquid is put into the box, it pushes against the skin, causing it to bend. This bending changes the magic push between the magic stick and the skin, which is then measured by the helper.\n\n**Part 2: What Magic Push Helpers Do**\nMagic push helpers do many things in many places. Some of these things include:\n\n1. Chip making: Magic push helpers are used to measure how empty is in chip making machines.\n2. Car making: Magic push helpers are used to measure how hard fuel pushes in cars.\n3. Doctor stuff: Magic push helpers are used to measure how hard gases push in doctor tools.\n\n**Part 3: How to Use Magic Push Helpers to Measure How Hard a Liquid Pushes**\nTo use magic push helpers to measure how hard a liquid pushes, do these things:\n\n1. Connect the magic push helper to the liquid system you want to measure.\n2. Put the liquid into the helper's box.\n3. Watch the change in magic push caused by the bending of the skin.\n4. Measure the change in magic push using the helper's read thing.\n5. Change the measured change in magic push into how hard a liquid pushes using a special curve.\n\n**Part 4: Real Examples**\nLet's think about a real example of using a magic push helper to measure how hard a liquid pushes in a chip making process. Imagine we want to check if a box is empty or not. We can use a simple tool to check if there is air inside the box. By checking the air, we can make sure that the box is as empty as we want it to be.\n\n**Chapter 5: Let's Talk About It**\n1. Why do we use this simple tool to check if the box is empty?\n2. How is this tool different from other tools that check if something is empty?\n3. Can we use this tool to check if there is air inside our body?\n\n**Word List:**\n- Simple tool: A thing that checks if there is more or less air somewhere by feeling the air.\n- Thin wall: A thin, bendy wall that keeps the part of the tool that feels the air safe from the air it is feeling.\n- Energy storage: The ability of something to keep energy in a sparkly field.\n- Picture of change: A picture that shows how the tool feels more or less air.\n\n**In the End:** In this story, we learned about the simple tool, what it can do, and how it checks if something is empty. We also talked about real-life examples and had a talk to learn how to think. By knowing how the simple tool works, we can use this knowledge for new problems and come up with cool ideas in different areas.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 6565, "idx": 285968, "original text": "Conventionally, electrostatic pressure sensors for detecting, as a change in electrostatic capacitance, a change in a pressure sensitive diaphragm that flexes when it bears the pressure of a fluid being measured have been widely known. For example, electrostatic pressure sensors are used for measuring the state of vacuum in a manufacturing process such as in semiconductor manufacturing equipment, where the electrostatic pressure sensor for measuring the vacuum state is known as a vacuum gauge.\nThis vacuum gauge has a housing that has an inlet portion for the fluid that is to be measured, and the change in the pressure-sensitive diaphragm that flexes when it bears the pressure of the fluid being measured that has been introduced through the inlet portion of the housing is detected as a change in electrostatic capacitance. In the vacuum gauge, a baffle for preventing the accumulation, on the diaphragm, of substances that are included in the fluid being measured and that are unnecessary and that are an impediment (where these substances shall be known as \u201ccontaminating substances\u201d) is provided between the inlet portion and the pressure-sensitive diaphragm, with a plate face thereof perpendicular to the direction through which the fluid being measured flows.\nFIG. 5 illustrates the critical portions of a vacuum gauge shown in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2006-3234 (\u201cthe JP '234\u201d). In this figure, 100 is a sensor chip, and is supported on the center portion of the top face of a pedestal plate 101. The pedestal plate 101 is made from a first pedestal plate 102 and a second pedestal plate 103, which are bonded to the top and bottom faces of a supporting diaphragm 104, where the peripheral portion of the supporting diaphragm 104 is bonded held between a lower housing 105 and an upper housing 106. That is, only the peripheral portion of the supporting diaphragm 104 is bonded between the lower housing 105 and the upper housing 106 in a state wherein the supporting diaphragm 104 is held between the first pedestal plate 102 and the second pedestal plate 103.\nThe sensor chip 100 has a spacer 107, a sensor diaphragm (a pressure-sensitive diaphragm) 108 that is bonded to the spacer 107, and wherein a strain is produced in response to the application of a pressure, and a sensor pedestal 109 that is bonded to the sensor diaphragm 108, and that forms a vacuum capacitance chamber (a reference chamber) 109A. Note that the vacuum capacitance chamber 109A maintains the same pressure level together with the internal space (the reference vacuum chamber) 106A of the upper housing 106, through a connecting hole, not shown, that is provided at an appropriate location of the sensor pedestal 109. Moreover, although omitted from the drawings, a movable electrode is provided on the back face (on the capacitance chamber 109A side) of the sensor diaphragm 108, and a stationary electrode is provided on the inner face of the sensor pedestal 109, facing the movable electrode.\nAn inlet portion 105A for the fluid to be measured is provided in the lower housing 105. Moreover, a baffle 105B is provided at the outlet, for the fluid being measured, from the inlet portion 105A of the lower housing 105 with the plate face thereof perpendicular to the direction of flow F of the fluid being measured. An inlet hole 105B1 for the fluid being measured is formed by a specific gap in the periphery of the baffle 105B. Moreover, an inlet hole 110, for directing the fluid to be measured to the sensor chip 100, is formed in the center parts of the pedestal plate 101 (102, 103) and the supporting diaphragm 104.\nIn this vacuum gauge, the fluid being measured (a gas) arrives at the sensor diaphragm 108 from the inlet portion 105A, and the sensor diaphragm 108 flexes due to the differential pressure between the pressure of the fluid being measured and the capacitance chamber 109A of the vacuum, changing the gap between the stationary electrode and the movable electrode that is provided between the back face of the sensor diaphragm 108 and the inner face of the sensor pedestal 109, so as to produce a change in the capacitance value (electrostatic capacitance) of the capacitor that is formed by the stationary electrode and the movable electrode. The pressure of the fluid being measured (the gas) is measured by reading out, on the outside of the vacuum gauge, the change in the electrostatic capacitance.\nMoreover, when measuring the pressure, the fluid being measured (the gas) from the inlet portion 105A strikes the plate face at the center of the baffle 105B and goes around it, and passes through the inlet hole 105B1 at the periphery of the baffle 105B, to be sent to the sensor diaphragm 108 through the inlet hole 110 in the center portions of the pedestal plate 101 (102 and 103) and the supporting diaphragm 104. As a result, the fluid being measured does not strike the sensor diaphragm 108 directly, thus preventing the accumulation, on the sensor diaphragm 108, of the contaminating substances that are included in the fluid being measured.\nHowever, while the baffle 105B is provided in the vacuum gauge, if the contaminating substance for which incursion is to be prevented is in a gaseous state at the point wherein the baffle 105B is provided, it will not be possible to completely prevent the incursion into the inside. For example, the contaminating substance incurs in a gaseous state in the thin film deposition process known as ALD (Atomic Layer Deposition), which is based on a surface adsorption reaction.\nThat is, the inlet hole 110 that is provided in the center portions of the pedestal plate 101 (102, 103) and the supporting diaphragm 104 is a single through hole, and there is no special structure for preventing the contaminating substance that passes through the baffle 105B in a gaseous state from arriving at the sensor diaphragm 108 within the sensor chip 100, and thus the contaminating substance easily arrives through the inlet hole 110 at the most sensitive part at the center portion of the surface of the sensor diaphragm 108. When the contaminating substance is deposited and accumulates at this part, this may cause a zero-point shift of the vacuum gauge, which would compromise the measurement accuracy.\nThe present invention is to solve problems such as set forth above, and an aspect thereof is to provide an electrostatic pressure sensor wherein it is possible to reduce the amount of the contaminating substances that accumulate on the pressure-sensitive diaphragm.", "hash": "43125c5faad6e7b5fe028c013defc0b5353417de386ad5a008eed2820ae424de"}
{"text": "Lesson: Making Smart Choices\nIntroduction:\nMaking smart choices is a useful skill that helps us choose the best thing in different situations. In this lesson, we will learn how to make smart choices by looking at a story where someone needs to decide between fixing their old toy drill or getting a new one.\nSection 1: Finding the Problem\nThe problem in this story is that the person's toy drill batteries are broken, and they need to decide whether to fix them or get a new toy drill.\nSection 2: Getting Information\nTo get information, we can look at how much it costs to fix the batteries, how much a new toy drill costs, and what is special about both choices. We can also think about the good and bad parts of each choice.\nSection 3: Looking at the Information\nAfter getting information, we can look at it to make a smart choice. Here, we can compare the cost of fixing the batteries with the cost of getting a new toy drill. We can also think about what is special about the toy drills and how they might change our choice.\nSection 4: Making a Choice\nBased on our looking, we can make a smart choice. Here, we might choose that it is better to fix the batteries than get a new toy drill. However, if the person wants a toy drill for a long time, they might choose to get a new one with better special things.\nConclusion:\nMaking smart choices means finding the problem, getting information, looking at the information, and making a choice based on the looking. By doing these steps, we can make the best choice in any situation.\nWords to Know:\n- Toy drill: A fun tool used for making pretend holes in things or joining pretend things together.\n- Rechargeable battery: A kind of battery that can be used again after it runs out of energy.\n- Sometimes use: Use of a thing or service once in a while.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 541, "idx": 366403, "original text": "I have an Hitachi DV18DVC drill with 3 batteries and they are all knackered.

{"text": "\n\nLesson: Learning about Medicine\n\n### Section 1: What is medicine?\nMedicine is a thing that we use to make sickness go away. It works by killing or stopping the tiny bad things that make us sick. There are many kinds of medicine, and they can make different sicknesses go away, from small skin boo-boos to big sicknesses.\n\n### Section 2: How does medicine work?\nMedicine works by finding the special things about the tiny bad things that make us sick that we don't have. These special things are called medicine targets. For example, some medicine works by messing with the tiny bad things' ability to make stuff, while others work by hurting the tiny bad things' wall. When medicine sticks to its target, it can either kill the tiny bad things or stop it from growing and making more.\n\n### Section 3: Why is medicine important?\nMedicine is important because it can save lives. Before we found special medicine, even tiny boo-boos could get very bad. Now, we use special medicine to treat many kinds of boo-boos, like the ones you get when you have a bad cough, or a very sore throat. We also give them to people who get sick easily, like those who are getting special treatments or those who got a new body part from a doctor.\n\n### Section 4: Kinds of special medicine\nThere are many kinds of special medicine. We can name them in different ways. Here are some kinds of special medicine:\n\n- Special medicine 1: used to treat bad coughs, very sore throats, and other boo-boos caused by bugs that don't like this medicine.\n- Special medicine 2: used to treat many boo-boos, like bad coughs, skin boo-boos, and bone and joint boo-boos.\n- Special medicine 3: used to treat many boo-boos, like bad skin, and other kinds of boo-boos.\n- Special medicine 4: used to treat coughs, like bad ones, and certain kinds of skin boo-boos.\n\n### Section 5: How to use special medicine safely\nSpecial medicine is very powerful, and we should only use it when we need to. Here are some ways to use special medicine safely:\n\n- Always finish all the special medicine your doctor gives you, even if you start to feel better before all the medicine is gone.\n- Take special medicine just like the doctor says, and don't miss any or take more than you should.\n- Never take special medicine that was given to someone else, and don't share your medicine with others.\n- Always tell your doctor if you have any allergies or other boo-boos before taking special medicine.\n- Be sure to tell your doctor if there's a baby in your tummy or if you're feeding a baby with your milk before taking special medicine.\n- Keep track of how you feel when you take special medicine, and tell your doctor right away if you feel very bad.\n\n### Ending:\nSpecial medicine is very important and has helped many people.

The objective of the current study was to evaluate and compare the efficacy of topical antibiotic therapy with cefazolin microspheres to systemic cefazolin therapy for the treatment of experimental rat surgical wounds contaminated with a methicillin-resistant strain of S. aureus (MRSA). A local infection model in rats was used. MRSA was used to infect pockets surgically produced in the paraspinous muscles. Groups of rats received either topical cefazolin microspheres, topical cefazolin powder, parenteral cefazolin, or no treatment. Feces were cultured to evaluate the effect of antibiotic therapy on gut flora. The rate of clinical wound infection following topical application of cefazolin microspheres (13%) was significantly lower than the 53% infection rate observed in rats who had received a 2-week course of systemic cefazolin therapy (P = 0.046). Moreover, single-dose topical antibiotic therapy with cefazolin microspheres completely eradicated MRSA from the wounds of 7 of 15 (47%) animals. There was no statistically significant difference, however, in the rate of clinical wound infection between rats whose wounds were treated topically with free cefazolin powder and those treated with systemic cefazolin (P = 0.12). Importantly, selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was associated with systemic but not local cefazolin therapy. The results of this study suggest that topical antibiotic therapy with controlled-release cefazolin microspheres may be effective for the prevention of wound infection with both methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus in selected surgical procedures that are at high risk of developing postoperative wound infection.", "hash": "6261a357844d70609608da8598c72d37f2b40b4ceb4795eaab3b36f905d1ef01"}
{"text": "Lesson Title: Learning About Bags\n\nIntroduction:\nIn this lesson, we will learn about different kinds of bags and what they are used for. We will also talk about why using bags again and again is better than using plastic bags only one time.\n\nSection 1: Kinds of Bags\n\nTopic 1: Fabric Bags\nFabric bags are made from things like cotton or polyester. They are strong and can be used many times. They come in different sizes and pictures, so they can be used for different things like carrying food, books, or clothes.\n\nTopic 2: Paper Bags\nPaper bags are made from trees and can be broken down easily. They are light and can be torn easily, so they are good for carrying light things like fruits or vegetables. But, they can't carry heavy things because they can break easily.\n\nTopic 3: Plastic Bags\nPlastic bags are made from things like polyethylene. They are strong and can't get wet, so they are good for carrying wet things or keeping them dry. But, they can't be broken down easily and can take many years to break down.\n\nSection 2: Why Using Bags Again and Again is Good\n\nTopic 1: It's Good for the Earth\nUsing bags again and again means less plastic waste in the landfills and oceans. This helps to keep the ocean animals safe and reduce dirty air. Also, bags that can be used again use less resources and energy to make, so they are better for the Earth.\n\nTopic 2: It Saves Money\nUsing bags again and again saves money because you don't have to buy plastic bags that you use only one time. While fabric bags may cost more than plastic bags, they last longer and can be used many times, so they save money in the end.\n\nTopic 3: It's Easy\nBags that can be used again are easy to carry and come in different sizes and pictures to fit different needs. They can be used to carry food, clothes, or books, so they are handy and easy to use.\n\nSection 3: ES Bag - Natural\n\nThe ES Bag - Natural is a bag that can be used again and again and is made from 100% cotton. It is strong and can carry up to 50 pounds. It has handles and comes in different colors. This bag is good for carrying food, clothes, or books.\n\nConclusion:\nIn this lesson, we learned about the different kinds of bags and what they are used for. We also talked about why using bags again and again is better than using plastic bags only one time. By using bags again and again, we can keep the Earth clean, save money, and make our lives easier. The ES Bag - Natural is a great example of a bag that can be used again and again. It is strong, lasts a long time, and can be used for many things.\n\nWords to Learn:\n- Fabric bags: Bags that you shop with that are made from things like cotton or polyester.\n- Paper bags: Bags for buying things, made from trees, that can go back to nature and are not heavy.\n- Plastic bags: Bags for buying things, made from stuff like plastic, that are strong and can't get wet inside.\n- Bags you can use again: Bags for buying things that you can use many times before they break.\n- Plastic bags you use once: Bags for buying things that you use one time and then throw away.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 740, "idx": 436931, "original text": "Eurosac Shoulder Bag - Natural\n\nBags & Pouches\n\n$ 9\n\nQty:\n\nLargest and strongest available on the market today\n\nAmazingly expands to hold as much as a standard paper grocery bag\n\nStrength tested to 50 lbs\n\n1/2\u2033 wide handles\n\nSince 1989, SteppingStones has been providing organizations, schools, cooperatives, and stores with the highest quality 100% cotton and organic cotton shopping bags.SteppingStones is the manufacturer and direct distributor of the EcoSac line.

This story will help kids understand what these special papers are, why they are important, and how to get one.\n\n### What we want to learn\nBy the end of this story, kids will be able to:\n- Understand what a special paper is and why it's important\n- Know the steps to get a special paper\n- Understand the different kinds of special papers\n- Know the difference between things you can get a special paper for and things you can't\n\n### Things we need\n- A white or black board\n- Pens or chalk\n- Papers with information on special papers\n- A computer to look up things (if we have one)\n\n### How we will learn\n1. Start by writing \"What is a special paper?\" on the board. Ask kids if they know what a special paper is and what it does. Listen to what the kids say.\n2. Explain that a special paper is a paper that says only you can make, use, and sell a new thing you made for a certain time, usually a long time. Say that these special papers are important because they keep safe the ideas of people who make new things and the time and work they put in to make them.\n3. Ask kids if they can think of any new things that have these special papers. Talk about some examples as a group, like the light that shines when it's dark, the thing we use to talk to people far away, or the thing we use to write and look at pictures.\n4. Tell the kids that there are different kinds of special papers, like ones for new and useful things, ones for how a thing looks, and ones for new kinds of plants.\n5. Say that not all new things can get a special paper. Show kids a list of things and ask them to say which ones can get a special paper and which ones can't:\n- A new medicine\n- A new way to make cookies\n- A new way to teach numbers\n- A new color for paint\n6. Talk with kids about why some of these things can get a special paper while others can't. Say that only new things or discoveries that are new, useful, and not easy to think of can get a special paper.\n7. Explain how to get a special paper. Talk about the steps, like looking to see if the thing is already made, applying for a special paper, answering questions from the special paper office, and paying fees.\n8.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION\nThe present invention relates to a fixing device for printers, copying machines and the like used to fix toner images on paper.\n2. DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART\nFixing devices of the heating roller type are widely used as fixing devices for fixing toner images on paper. Fixing devices of the heating roller type are provided with a heating source such as an infrared lamp or the like installed within at least one roller among a pair of rollers that come into mutual pressure contact, and fuse the toner image onto a paper sheet interposed between said pair of rollers.\nFixing devices of a flash type are well known as fixing devices that fuse toner images onto paper by a non-contact method. Flash type fixing devices are provided with a flash lamp and reflecting plate such as a reflector or the like, which reflects the light emitted by the flash lamp so as to fuse the toner image onto a sheet by means of the radiant heat of said reflection.\nFixing devices of the heating roller type use rollers having large heat capacity. The surface of the roller must be preheated to a predetermined temperature in order to heat the entire roller via the heating source.\nAlthough fixing devices of the flash type do not require preheating since the toner image is fused onto the paper sheet by fusing said toner via the radiant heat of the light emitted from the flash lamp, heating efficiency is poor, and designing for compactness is difficult.", "hash": "82165b5e786442ea1775cf5652f1108922d6834c38e1d68a165eb94a584ddb53"}

{"text": "Lesson: Talking about a Big Room in a Place to Stay\n\nIntroduction:\nIn this lesson, we will learn how to talk about a big room in a place to stay using clear details and good words. We will learn about these parts:\n\nI. Talking about the Big Room\nII. Real Examples\nIII. Thinking and Talking\nIV. Word List\nV. Ending\n\nI. Talking about the Big Room\n\n**Talking**: A big room is a special room that has many rooms in one. Big rooms often have more things like a separate place to sit, a place to make food, or a table to eat at. In this lesson, we will talk about Big Room #1 in a place to stay.\n\n**Details**: Big Room #1 has a white floor in the sitting room and bedroom. The bathrooms have warm floors; special showers made of shiny stone and two sinks in the main bathroom. The room is in a very quiet place at the place to stay and is very big with three doors and special furniture. It has a big sitting room, a place to make drinks, two full bathrooms and one bedroom. This room has a big private outside area just two steps from the sand and you can see pretty plants and wild flowers. While the room does not see the water, just a short walk from the door is our private beach, where each day big umbrellas and chairs will be set up.\n\n**Talking about Room 1**: To talk about Room 1, we can use words like \"fancy,\" \"big,\" \"alone,\" and \"cozy.\" We can also use words that talk about how things feel or look to help make a clear picture. For example, we can say the warm floors feel \"warm\" and \"nice,\" and the view of the water is \"wow\" and \"calm.\"\n\nII. Real Examples\n\n**Example 1**: If you want a room that is alone and cozy, Room 1 is a great pick. It is in a very alone spot at the place, so you will have lots of space just for you. Also, the room has three doors and special furniture that make it feel fancy and cool.\n\n**Example 2**: For those who love to make food, the room's small kitchen has everything you need to make meals. With a box to keep food cold, a thing to warm up food, and a thing to make coffee, you can have your favorite meals without having to leave the room.\n\n**Example 3**: After a fun day of playing on the beach, you can rest on the room's big alone deck just two steps from the sand. Enjoy the awesome views of the untouched sand hills and wild beach flowers while drinking a cool drink.\n\nIII. Smart Thinking Talk\n\n**Question**: What things should you think about when picking a hotel room?\n\n**Answer**: When picking a hotel room, there are several things to think about. These include how big the room is, where the room is in the hotel, what the room has, the price, and what people say about the hotel. Also, you may want to think about how close the room is to fun places or big things that you plan to see.\n\n**Talk**: Use this part to have a talk with kids about why it's important to think about different things when picking a hotel room. Ask them to share their own stories and thoughts on what they look for when picking a hotel room.\n\nIV. Word List\n\n**Marble**: A type of rock that is very hard and can be shiny.\n\n**Soapstone**: A type of rock that is soft and can feel like soap.\n\n**Umbrella**: A thing you can hold that keeps you dry when it rains or shades you when it's sunny.\n\nV. Ending\n\nTo end, Room 1 is a fancy room that is alone, cozy, and easy to use. By using words that describe things and focusing on special details, we can make a clear picture for people who might want to stay. When picking a hotel room, it's important to think about things like size, place, what it has, and price. By having smart thinking talks, we can better understand why these things are important and make smart choices when picking a hotel room.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 722, "idx": 155752, "original text": "Suite 131.

{"text": "Lesson: Sharing and Trading\n\nOverview: In this lesson, we will learn about sharing and trading things. We will look at why smaller friends start to share their toys and what this means for the future of sharing and trading.\n\nSection 1: What is sharing and trading?\n\nSharing and trading are about giving or taking toys that are focused on having fun. These toys can include cars, dolls, balls, and other fun things that make us happy.\n\nSection 2: Why are smaller friends starting to share?\n\nThere are several reasons why smaller friends are starting to share their toys. One reason is that they are trying to learn how to share and play with others. Another reason is that many smaller friends like to play with the same toys, which makes sharing important. As a result, these friends are looking for ways to play together and have fun.\n\nSection 3: What does this mean for the future of sharing and trading?\n\nAs more smaller friends share their toys, we can expect to see more sharing and trading. This could lead to larger friends sharing even more toys, creating even more fun for smaller friends. However, it could also create chances for new games and fun, as larger friends share new toys and ideas for play.\n\nSection 4: Fun Examples\n\nLet's imagine a smaller friend who likes to share toys with friends in the playground. This friend has many toys and likes to play. However, it's hard to play with larger friends who have more toys to share. As a result, the friend decides to share its toys with a larger friend who also likes to play.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn this lesson, we learned about sharing and trading and why smaller friends are starting to share their toys. We looked at the possible things this means for the future of sharing and trading and imagined a fun situation of a friend who might like to share. By understanding how to share and trade, we can have more fun playing with friends.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1336, "idx": 293466, "original text": "Smaller media deals on horizon\n\nLarry Grimes, president of media investment bank W.B.

{"text": "Story: How to Choose Party Food for Your Birthday\nIntroduction:\nChoosing the right food for your birthday party can be a big task, especially if you or your friends can't eat certain foods. In this story, we will talk about the different food options for parties and give tips on how to pick the best one for you.\nSection 1: Types of Party Food Options\nThere are several types of party food options, including:\n- Party food from the place: Many party places offer their own food, which means they make the food and have people to serve it. This choice is easy because the place takes care of everything, but it may not be as special as other choices.\n- Food from outside: Food from outside is ordered separately from the place and comes with all the food and people needed for the party. This choice lets you customize more and is flexible, but it needs more planning and teamwork.\n- Make-your-own food: Make-your-own food means that you cook and serve the food yourself. This choice saves money, but it needs a lot of time and effort.\nSection 2: Tips for Choosing Party Food\nWhen choosing party food, think about these tips:\n- Think about how much you want to spend: Party food can have different prices, so it's important to decide how much you want to spend before you start looking.\n- Think about your food needs: If you or your friends can't eat certain foods, make sure to tell this to the people making your food.\n- Try the food first: If you can, try the food before you order it to make sure that you like it.\n- Look at reviews and ask others: Before you order the food, look at what other people say online and ask for opinions from others who have tried it.\n- Work with your party place: Make sure to work with your party place to make sure that the food is allowed and that they have the things and people needed.\nSection 3: Examples of Party Food\nHere are some examples of party food and the types of food they offer:\n- SP country Food: This type of food makes traditional SP dishes, like rice dishes, small plates, and fruit drinks.\n- V food: V food offers food choices that are made from plants and don't have any animal products.\n- BQ food: BQ food specializes in cooking and smoking meats, like chicken, beef, and pork.\nConclusion:\nIn the end, choosing the right food for your birthday party needs careful thinking about your money, food needs, and what you like.

In this lesson, we will learn what these tools are, why they are good, and how they can be used in different situations.\n\nSection 1: What are Help and Teaching?\n\nHelp is when a person who knows a lot guides and supports a person who is learning in their job. Teaching, on the other hand, is when someone guides and supports people or groups to do their best.\n\nHelp and teaching tools are made to help people think about their work, see where they can do better, and learn new things. These tools are really good for people who work alone or in small groups where there may not be a boss or a teacher to guide them.\n\nSection 2: Why are Help and Teaching Good?\n\nThere are several reasons why using help and teaching tools is good, including:\n\n1. Better work: By giving good advice and support, help and teaching can make people do their jobs better.\n\n2. Knowing yourself better: By thinking and talking, help and teaching can make people understand what they are good at and what they need to improve, which can make them better.\n\n3. Better at solving problems: By looking at different ways to solve work problems, help and teaching can make people come up with new and better solutions.\n\n4. More excited about work: By giving cheers and support, help and teaching can make people stay excited and focused on their goals.\n\n5. Better teamwork: Teaching can make people and groups work together better, which can make them do more work together.\n\nSection 3: Using Help and Teaching in Different Situations\n\nHelp and teaching tools can be used in different situations, including:\n\n1. Teaching one person: One-on-one teaching sessions can be used to help people learn new things, solve specific problems, or reach personal or job goals.\n\n2. Teaching a group: Teaching can also be given to whole groups, helping them work together better and reach common goals.\n\n3. Help from friends: Help from friends involves a group of people meeting regularly to talk about their work and support each other.\n\n4. Learning from someone who knows a lot: Learning from someone who knows a lot is a form of help where a person who knows a lot gives guidance, support, and advice to a person who is learning.\n\nConclusion:\nIn the end, help and teaching tools are valuable for people who want to do their jobs better and reach their goals. By giving good advice and support, these tools can help people and groups work better, solve problems in a smarter way, and reach their goals more quickly. Whether used for one person's growth or for building a group, help and teaching tools can help people reach new heights of success.\n\nWords to Know:\n- Help: When a person who knows a lot guides and supports a person who is learning in their job.\n- Teaching: When someone guides and supports people or groups to do their best.\n- Knowing yourself: Understanding how you feel, what you're good at, and what you need to work on.\n- Solving problems: Figuring out how to fix hard things.\n- Wanting to do things: Doing things because you want to, not just because you have to.\n- Working together: Joining with others to do something together.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 676, "idx": 205288, "original text": "The aim of our supervision services are to improve and empower your ability to reflect and to manage the work you do in daily life.

{"text": "Lesson: How to Measure How Much Protein using a Simple Test Kit\n\nIntroduction:\nThe Simple Test Kit is a common way to find out how much protein is in something. It uses colors to show how much protein is there. In this lesson, we will learn how to use the Simple Test Kit to measure protein.\n\nSection 1: What we're learning\n\n1.1. What is measuring protein?\nMeasuring protein is finding out how much protein is in something. This is important in many areas, like studying living things, health, and food.\n\n1.2. How does the Simple Test Kit work?\nThe Simple Test Kit uses a blue dye to show protein. The dye sticks to the protein, and the color gets brighter when there is more protein. We measure the color to find out how much protein is there.\n\n1.3. Why is the Simple Test Kit helpful?\nThe Simple Test Kit is helpful because it is easy, quick, and accurate for measuring protein. It can be used for different amounts of protein and isn't affected by other things in the sample.\n\nSection 2: How to do it\n\n2.1. Getting the sample ready\nTo get the sample ready, do these steps:\n1. Make the protein sample smaller if needed.\n2. Add the Simple Test Kit liquid to the sample.\n3. Mix the sample and liquid well.\n4. Let the sample sit for 60 minutes at room temperature.\n\n2.2. Looking at the color\nAfter waiting, look at the color of the sample.\n\n2.3. Finding out protein amount\nUse the Simple Test Kit's guide to find out how much protein is in the sample. The guide is a picture that shows the link between color and protein amount.\n\nSection 3: Talking about it\n\n3.1. What are the limits of the Simple Test Kit?\nThe Simple Test Kit may not work for all types of proteins. Some things might not mix well with the blue paint, causing wrong counts.\n\n3.2. How can we make the counting game better?\nTo make the counting game better, make sure that the things are prepared correctly and the count is done right. Also, it is good to use a guide that comes from the same type of thing being counted.\n\nEnd:\nThe counting game is a helpful way to count things in a group. By understanding how the game works and using it, you can correctly count things in different groups. Talking about the game helps you think and points out ways to make the game better.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 934, "idx": 443658, "original text": "Bradford ULTRA Protein Assay Kit. - Detergent compatible - no interference from protein extraction buffer. - Consistent results - less protein-to-protein variation. - Ready to use - no need to prepare or optimise solutions. - One single assay for protein quantitation.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning about Classroom Teaching\n\n## Chapter 1: What is Classroom Teaching?\n\nClassroom teaching is a way of teaching that was made by Dr. Maria, a doctor and teacher, a long time ago. It is based on the idea that kids learn best when they are actively playing and learning and that they have a strong wish to learn and look at their surroundings.\n\nIn a classroom, kids are encouraged to choose their own games and activities within a carefully prepared room. The things used in a classroom are designed to help kids learn skills in areas such as talking, counting, sensing things, and life skills.\n\n## Chapter 2: Why is Classroom Teaching Important?\n\nClassroom teaching is important because it sees the special abilities and possibilities of each kid. It provides a caring environment where kids can grow at their own speed, without the pressure of competition or comparison.\n\nClassroom teaching also helps kids learn important skills such as doing things by themselves, self-control, and self-confidence. These skills are very important for doing well in school and in life.\n\n## Chapter 3: How does Classroom Teaching Work?\n\nClassroom teaching works by giving kids chances to explore and learn in a carefully prepared environment. The classroom is designed to encourage doing things by themselves, working together, and a love of learning.\n\nTeachers in a classroom are called \"helpers\" because their job is to help kids towards learning experiences that are good for their individual needs and interests. The teacher watches the kids and provides things that will challenge them and help them grow.\n\n## Chapter 4: What are the Good Things about Classroom Teaching?\n\nThere are many good things about classroom teaching, including:\n\n- Encouraging doing things by themselves and self-control\n- Learning how to think and solve problems\n- Building confidence and feeling good about themselves\n- Providing a caring environment that supports individual growth and development\n- Encouraging working together and respect for others\n- Preparing kids for doing well in school and in life.\n\n## Chapter 5: Ending\n\nIn the end, classroom teaching is a powerful tool for helping kids grow into confident, independent, and successful grown-ups.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning about Special Rights\n\nOverview:\nIn this lesson, we will learn about special rights and why they are important. We will also talk about how to make a product smell special, which is a unique kind of special right.\n\nObjectives:\nBy the end of this lesson, students will be able to:\n\n1. Explain what special creation rights are and why they matter.\n2. Share how to protect a toy's smell.\n3. Understand why protecting a toy's smell is good.\n4. Talk about other toys that have protected their smell well.\n\nSection 1: What are Special Creation Rights?\n\nSpecial creation rights mean that when someone makes something new and special, they get to keep it safe. This lets people and companies make money from their ideas and new things without worrying about others taking them. Special creation rights can be for new toys, special signs, storybooks, and secret things.\n\nWhy are special creation rights important?\n\nSpecial creation rights matter because they make people want to create and try new things. They give a reason for people and companies to use their time and things to make new toys and services. Without special creation rights, others could easily take these new things and get all the good stuff without working for it.\n\nSection 2: Protecting a Toy's Smell\n\nProtecting a toy's smell is a special kind of special creation right. It means finding out and keeping safe the special smell of a toy so that it becomes known for that toy only. This can be done by making a special smell that is only for the toy.\n\nHow does protecting a toy's smell work?\n\nTo protect a toy's smell, a company needs to ask the special creation office. They need to tell them about the smell and how it is used in the toy. The special creation office might also want the company to give them a toy so they can smell it too.\n\nWhy is protecting a toy's smell good?\n\nProtecting a toy's smell is good for a few reasons. First, it helps people know the toy from other toys. When people smell the toy, they will think of that toy only. This makes a strong link between the person and the toy, making it more likely they will pick that toy over others. Second, protecting a toy's smell can also stop others from using similar smells in their own toys. This makes sure the toy stays special and easy to know.\n\nSection 3: Toys That Have Protected Their Smell Well\n\nThere are a few toys that have protected their smell well. One is the popular candle toy from the 'Y' company. They have protected the smell of their famous \"Vanilla Cupcake\" candle, which is now known as their toy. Another one is the fancy car toy from the 'B' company, who have protected the smell of their leather seats.\n\nIn the end:\n\nTo finish, special creation rights are very important for keeping the new and special things of people and companies safe. Protecting a toy's smell is a special kind of special creation right that can help a toy stand out from other toys. By understanding how to protect a toy's smell and why it's good, we can see why special creation rights are important in the toy world.\n\nWords to Learn:\n\n- Idea rights: Rules that help people who make new things keep their ideas safe.\n- Sign: A picture or word that shows a company or thing.\n- Idea shield: A rule that lets a person who made a new thing keep it safe for some time.\n- Song and story shield: Rules that keep new songs, stories, and pictures safe.\n- Secret: Something only a few people know that helps them do better than others.\n\n[1] Fun Facts.

But for the first time, sensing an opportunity to further strengthen its branding, Hasbro has submitted an application to trademark the Play-Doh scent. Along with the application itself, Hasbro sent USPTOa tub of actual Play-Doh for them to actually smell.\n\nSurprisingly, this isn\u2019t the first time that a company has tried to trademark the smell of a product. According to Mental Floss, the first successful instance took place in 1990, when a Californian company called OSEWEZ (pronounced \u2018oh sew easy\u2019) trademarked a \u201cplumeria blossom-scented embroidery thread\u201d after debating the case in front of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. The successful application opened the floodgates for other businesses to try their luck at branding scents, including Hasbro itself.\n\nWhat\u2019s unsurprising, however, is that a smell is much harder to trademark than a name. As pointed out by the World Intellectual Property Organisation, a brand must be able to supply a visual representation of the product\u2019s scent in order to be successful. This is about as tough as it sounds, as \u201cany written description of a smell must be so precise that that particular smell would not be confused with any other\u201d. With respect, Hasbro gave a valiant effort in its application, describing the Play-Doh smell as \u201ca unique scent formed through the combination of a sweet, slightly musky, vanilla-like fragrance, with slight overtones of cherry, and the natural smell of a salted, wheat-based dough\u201d.\n\nAnother key factor in the trademarking of any scent is that it must not result from the nature of the product itself. For example, it is notoriously difficult to trademark the scent of a perfume, because the smell is the product. This is where the description of the scent really becomes crucial to the application, as it needs to persuade the decision makers that the smell is merely an accompaniment to the product itself.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the simple fact that different people identify different smells. Just think of a wine tasting, for instance. Why the sommelier might be able to pick out the smells of individuals fruits in a glass of red, someone else might only be able to pick up the smell of wine.\n\nDespite such challenges, Hasbro obviously believes confidently enough in the distinctiveness of the Play-Doh smell to file the application. If successful, we could see some very interesting products enter the marketplace soon \u2014 Play-Doh scented candles, anyone?", "hash": "e8033c4254da47e067a3ef6217f66ed72bb67ef0eb776ce4069dadea73b2ba6d"}
{"text": "Lesson: Learning about Special Helpers\n\n### Overview\nIn this lesson, we will learn about special helpers and how they can help in making us better when we are unwell.\n\n### Background\nSpecial helpers are things made in special places that can help our body fight off things that make us unwell. They stick to one bad thing, like a germ or a sick cell, and help our body know where to fight.\n\n### Core Value\nThe important part of this lesson is understanding how special helpers can make us better. We will focus on a special helper named Sam.\n\n### Section 1: Making of Sam\n1.1 What is Sam?\nSam is a special helper that was made to help our body know where to fight when our skin is unwell.\n\n1.2 How was Sam made?\nTo make Sam, people in a special place showed our body a part of our skin that can make us unwell. This made our body create special cells that can make special helpers to fight the unwell part. Then, they made these cells make a special helper, Sam, that knows where to fight.\n\n### Section 2: What Can Sam Do?\n2.1 What can Sam do?\nSam is a special helper that can help our body know where to fight when our skin is unwell. Sam can do a lot of things:\n\n- Sam knows where to fight: Sam knows to fight the unwell part of the skin.\n- Sam can stay for a long time: Sam can stay for a long time without forgetting where to fight.\n- Sam can be made a lot: Sam can be made in a lot of numbers, so it is easy to use to make us better.\n\n### Section 3: Using Sam\n3.1 How is Sam used?\nSam is used to show our body where to fight when our skin is unwell. This can help us understand how our skin works and find things that can make our skin unwell.\n\nWhat does our friend \"Nathan\" point out?\nNathan points to different parts in the skin. He points to special strings in the skin's deep layer. But, he does not point to some other strings in their middle part, showing that Nathan only points to certain parts in the skin.\n\n### Words to Remember\n- A special helper: A helper made in the lab that can copy the way our body fights off bad things or strange cells.\n- A trigger: Something that makes the body fight back.\n- Helper cells: A kind of white blood cell that makes helpers.\n- A certain kind of helper: A kind of special helper that belongs to a helper family.\n- Support layer: A thin layer that helps and protects cells.\n- Special strings: Protein strings found in the skin's deep layer.\n- Other special strings: Protein strings found in another deep layer of the skin.\n- Fully grown strings: Strings that have completely grown and are not growing anymore.\n- Middle part: The middle of fully grown strings.\n- Below the support layer: The area under the support layer.\n\n### Ending\nIn this lesson, we learned about how special helpers, like Nathan, are used to point to parts in the skin's support layer. We talked about what Nathan does, how he is used in learning and health, and gave a list of important words. By knowing the main point of this lesson, kids can use this knowledge in other areas of health and learning about special helpers.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1141, "idx": 100880, "original text": "Anti-elastofibril monoclonal antibody NKH-1: production and application.\nA new monoclonal antibody NKH-1 was developed using human subepidermal basement membrane zone substances as immunogen. NKH-1, IgG1 kappa light chain, labeled proteins in the subbasement membrane zone in a linear fashion. It also labeled oxytalan fibers and elaunin fibers in the papillary dermis. Mature elastic fibers were labeled only in their peripheral microfibrils (elastofibrils) and the center core of elastin was nonreactive. Basal lamina itself was not decorated with NKH-1 even at the immunoelectron microscopic level. Skin appendages such as eccrine and apocrine glands, arrector pili muscle, hair follicle, and sebaceous gland were surrounded with NKH-1-positive substances. This substance was in linear fashion closely associated with the basal lamina but deposited linearly outside of it. Species specificity tests were performed only in nonprimates: mouse and guinea pig skins were nonreactive with NKH-1. NKH-1 seems to recognize a new substance in the subbasal lamina region (subbasal lamina proteins) which crossreact with elastic fiber microfibrils.", "hash": "f62ddb1de5ad1c467db767420de7d0658bef35974804975481af764a8a2971cc"}
{"text": "\n\n# Lesson: Learning About \"Ferns\"\n## Start\n\"Ferns\" are a group of plants with tubes that have been here for a very, very long time. They are known for their special leaves, which have changed to form a branching structure. In this lesson, we will learn how to spot and sort \"ferns\" by looking at how they look, their life, and their history.\n## How They Look\nThe way \"ferns\" look can be very different depending on the kind. But, there are some common things that can help us spot them. \"Ferns\" usually have a rhizome, which is a creeping root that grows just under the ground. They also have a special part called a sporangium, which makes spores instead of seeds. Besides, \"ferns\" have a special tissue called sori, which holds the spores and is found on the bottom of the leaf.\n## Life\nFerns grow in two main steps: the little seed stage and the big plant stage. In the little seed stage, the fern makes tiny seeds. These tiny seeds mix together to make a new little seed. This new little seed grows into a big fern plant that makes spores. These spores are carried away by wind or water and grow into new fern plants.\n\\subsection{Old Times}\nFerns are some of the oldest plants. They first showed up a very long time ago. Over time, they changed to live in different places and got special skills like making food without sunlight. Today, there are more than 10,000 types of ferns all over the world.\n\\subsection{Groups}\nFerns are put into different groups based on how they look. The two main groups are the big ferns and the little ferns. Big ferns include most of the ferns we see today, like the lady fern and the Boston fern. Little ferns include ferns with smaller, less leafy leaves, like the maidenhair fern.\n\\subsection{End}\nIn the end, ferns are very interesting plants with a long past and special looks. By knowing their looks, how they grow, and groups, we can like these old plants more and enjoy their beauty in our homes and gardens.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 671, "idx": 127507, "original text": "\\n \\nThis illustrated wall chart of a Male Fern plant was originally designed for educational purposes but now makes a fantastic piece of wall art.

{"text": "Story: Making Toy Cars in Computer\n\n## Part 1: Ideas \n\n### Part 1.1: What is Making Toy Cars in Computer?\nMaking toy cars in computer is like drawing a toy car but in 3D, using a computer program. In our story, we will use a program called Blender to make our 3D toy cars.\n\n### Part 1.2: Why Make Toy Cars in Computer?\nMaking toy cars in computer can be fun and it has many good sides:\n\n- Change easily: You can change the shape and look of the car easily in the computer.\n- Measure: You can make sure that everything is the right size.\n- Teamwork: Many people can work on the same car at the same time.\n- Save money: Once you make a car in the computer, you can use it for many things without spending more money.\n\n## Part 2: How to Do It\n\n### Part 2.1: Making a Simple Toy Car\n1. Open the Blender program and click on \"Add\". Choose \"Cube\" and put it in the middle of the screen.\n2. Use the \"Move\" tool to make the cube the size of your car.\n3. Click on the \"Subdivision Surface\" button to make the car look more real.\n4. Use the \"Smooth\" tool to make the car look nice, like rounding the corners.\n5. Choose colors and patterns for your car using the \"Material\" settings.\n6. Save your car and keep it as an .obj file for more work later.\n\n### Part 2.2: Making Your Car Look Real\nTo make your car look more real, think about adding things like:\n\n- Wheels: Use the \"Cylinder\" and \"Sphere\" tools to make wheels and put them on the car.\n- Windows: Use the \"Rectangle\" tool to make windows and use a \"Transparency\" material to make them look like glass.\n- Doors: Use the \"Box\" and \"Cylinder\" tools to make doors and put them on the car.\n- Lights: Use the lights in Blender to make shadows and light spots on your car.\n\n## Part 3: Pretend Play \n\n### Part 3.1: Making a Dream Car\nImagine you are a car designer. You have to make a dream car for a customer. You think about cool and new designs but also think about how to make the car and how much it will cost. Using the computer program, you can try many designs quickly and show them to the customer in a nice way.\n\n### Part 3.2: Looking at a Fast Car\nFast car teams often use simple drawing to look at their cars before making real models. This lets them test different shapes and make changes before using things to make real tests.\n\n## Words to Know\n\n- Blender: A free software used for simple drawing.\n- Surface: A way to add more lines to make smooth surfaces.\n- Smooth: A tool in Blender that makes lines simpler and smoother.\n- Material: A setting in Blender that shows how an object looks, including its pattern and color.\n- .obj: A type of file used for 3D shapes.\n\n## Ending\n\nThrough this lesson, we have learned the basics of drawing cars using Blender. By understanding the ideas, practicing with real examples, and using our knowledge in real life, we can get better at drawing digital cars. As we keep learning and practicing, we will get the skills needed to create beautiful and correct digital models that meet the needs of different jobs.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 540, "idx": 7955, "original text": "pavla writes:.

In this lesson, we will talk about how to pick the right car service for a dance.\nMain Point:\nThe main point of this lesson is to help students make good choices when picking a car service for a dance.\nPart 1: Looking at Car Services\nTopic: Looking at Car Services\nQuestions:\n- What are the different kinds of car services out there?\n- How do I find a good car service?\n- What should I look for when looking at a car service?\nAnswers:\n- There are several kinds of car services out there, including regular cars, long cars, big cars, and party buses.\n- You can find a good car service by asking friends and family for suggestions, looking at online reviews, and looking at the company's website and social media pages.\n- When looking at a car service, you should look for a company with a good name, a variety of cars to pick from, good prices, and experienced drivers.\nReal Example:\nImagine you are looking for a car service for your dance. You could start by looking online for \"car service near me\" or \"dance car rental.\" You could then look at the company's website and social media pages to see what other people have said about their experience. You could also check online reviews to see if other people have had good experiences with the company.\nPart 2: Comparing Car Services\nTopic: Comparing Car Services\nQuestions:\n- How do I compare different car services?\n- What things should I think about when comparing car services?\n- How do I know which car service is the best choice for me?\nAnswers:\n- To pick the best car ride, make a list of companies and look at their costs, car types, and what people say about them.\n- When picking a car ride, think about how much it costs, what cars they have, what people say about the company, and how nice they are to their customers.\n- To choose the best car ride for you, think about how much money you have, how many friends will ride with you, and if you want a special car (like a red one).\nExample:\nLet's say you have two car ride companies to choose from. You could look at how much they cost and what cars they have to see which one you can afford and has the car you like. You could also look at what people say about the companies to see which one is better liked. With this info, you can decide which car ride to pick.\nPart 3: Getting the Car Ride\nTopic: Getting the Car Ride\nQuestions:\n- How do I get a car ride?\n- What do I need to tell them when I get a car ride?\n- How do I make sure my car ride goes well?\nAnswers:\n- To get a car ride, you usually need to tell the company your name, how they can reach you, when and where they should pick you up, and where you're going.\n- When getting a car ride, tell the company as much as you can so your ride goes well. This could include how many friends are riding with you, any special things you want, and any special directions for the driver.\n- To make sure your car ride goes well, talk clearly with the company, be there on time, and give the driver clear directions to where you're going.\nExample:\nLet's say you've picked a car ride company and are ready to get your ride. You'd usually tell the company your name, how they can reach you, when and where they should pick you up, and where you're going. You might also want to tell them any special things you want, like a red car. Once you've told them this, the company will usually tell you they got it and give you any other info you need to know.\nEnd:\nPicking the right car ride for a big party can make your night really fun.

We will look at the different parts that make up a color, like the base, sparkles, and small color pieces. We will also talk about how to give your color a name and share it with others.\nPart 1: Understanding the Parts of a Color\n- Base: The base is the starting point of the color. It can be clear, white, or colored.\n- Sparkles: Sparkles make the color shiny. They can be made from different things like glass or metal.\n- Small Color Pieces: Small color pieces give the color more detail. They can be flat or shiny.\nQuestions:\n- What are the different types of bases used in a color?\n- What is the difference between sparkles and small color pieces?\n- How do you give a special name to your color?\nPart 2: Making Your Own Color\n- Begin by choosing a base color that you like. You can pick a usual color like red or blue, or be bold with a bright green or purple.\n- Then, add sparkles to your color. You can use different things like glass or metal to create different looks. Try different types of sparkles to find the perfect mix of shine and detail.\n- Finally, add small color pieces to give your color more detail. Flat pieces add a little bit of shine, while shiny pieces make a bigger effect.\nQuestions:\n- What are some fun ways to mix different parts to make a special color?\n- How do you know when your color is ready to share?\nPart 3: Sharing Your Color\n- Once you have made your own color, it's time to share it with others. You can make a website or online page to show your color and tell your story.\n- Use good pictures to show your color and its special parts. Make sure to show any special things or ways used to make it.\n- Talk with others by answering to comments and messages. Give special deals or lower prices to make them want to try your color.\nQuestions:\n- How do you make your color different from others?\n- What are some good ways to share a small thing?\nEnding: Making your own color is fun and exciting.

{"text": "Lesson: Understanding Simple Electronics\n\nIntroduction:\n\nThere are some special parts in our toys and gadgets that let electricity move in only one direction. These parts help make our things work right. In this lesson, we will learn about these special parts and how they work.\n\nMain Idea:\n\nThe main idea of this lesson is to understand how these special parts work in our toys and gadgets and how they help control the movement of electricity.\n\nPart 1: Basic Ideas\n\nTopic 1: What is this Special Part?\n\nThis special part we are talking about is a tiny part in our toys that lets electricity move in only one direction. It is made of a special material that helps create a path for the electricity to move.\n\nTopic 2: Different kinds of Special Parts\n\nThere are different kinds of these special parts, like:\n\n1. The common kind: This is the most usual kind and is made of two different kinds of special materials joined together.\n2. The special kind: These special parts can let electricity move in the other direction if there is a lot of it.\n3. The metal kind: These special parts are made of metal and special materials and let electricity move more easily than the common kind.\n\nPart 2: Toys and Gadgets with Special Parts\n\nTopic 1: A Toy that Controls Electricity\n\nSome toys need to control the amount of electricity going to them. They use the special part to control the electricity, allowing the right amount to flow. \n\nTopic 2: A Toy that Changes the Type of Electricity\n\nSome toys need to change the type of electricity they use. They use the special part to let electricity move in only one direction, stopping it from moving in the other direction.\n\nPart 3: Real Examples\n\nExample 1: A flashlight toy uses the special part to change the electricity from a battery into a type that can light up a light.\n\nThis is about lights and how they work. Lights need energy to shine. The energy comes from a power source. The power source gives energy to the light. The light uses this energy to shine. \n\nThere is a toy called a radio. It uses a part called a diode to work. This diode uses energy from the power source to make the radio work.\n\nIn this, we learned about lights and diodes. We learned what they are and how they work. We also looked at examples of how they are used. By understanding these, we can use them in new ways.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1199, "idx": 420556, "original text": "Q:\n\nCurrent in a circuit with diodes\n\nThese are two examples from the book.

How can I know when to consider the second current and when not? I know that the diode's current get's very large for forward voltage but why the current isn't neglected in every parallel circuit like in these two.\n\nA:\n\nWhy in the first one it's neglecting \\$i_2\\$?\n\nBecause if you take \\$V_i\\$ as an independent variable, \\$i_2\\$ doesn't change \\$V_o\\$. \\$V_o\\$ depends only on \\$V_i\\$, R, and R1. \n\nHow can I know when to consider the second current and when not?\n\nYou can calculate what the second current is (\\$V_i / R_2\\$ in this case) and then see whether you ever use that information in calculating whatever final result you're going for (\\$V_o\\$ in this case).\n\nwhy the current isn't neglected in every parallel circuit like in these two.\n\nBecause sometimes it matters.

We will talk about his early life, his writing style, and how he made spooky stories more fun.\n## His Early Life\nHenry was born a long, long time ago, in PR city. He was the only child of his parents. When he was just a little boy, his father got very sick and had to live in a special house for sick people. His mother found it hard to take care of him and often sent him to live with his family or friends. Henry loved to read from when he was very young and liked spooky and ghost stories a lot.\n## His Way of Writing\nHenry's way of writing was very much influenced by his love of spooky and ghost stories. He often wrote about ancient gods, monsters, and other magical creatures. He also had a special way of writing where he showed the world as a cold, uncaring place where human life is not important. This made his stories very scary for many readers.\n## His Effect on Spooky Stories\nHenry's writing had a big effect on spooky stories. Many of his ideas have been used by other writers and people who make movies. For example, the scary myth, which he made, has been used in many spooky movies and games. You can see Henry's influence in the work of writers like Stephen and Neil, as well as in a fun role-playing game.\n## Wrapping Up\nHenry's work is still liked by many people today, many, many years after he passed away. His special way of writing and his ideas have made a big impact on spooky stories.

{"text": "Lesson Title: Learning about Skin Spots and Big Birthmarks\n\n#### Section 1: Introduction\nSkin spots and big birthmarks are uncommon problems that make some parts of the skin look darker. They can also cause troubles like shaking, learning slowly, and having trouble seeing. In this lesson, we will learn about skin spots and big birthmarks, their signs, and how doctors find out if someone has them and helps them feel better.\n\n#### Section 2: What are Skin Spots?\nSkin spots are a problem that affects the skin, eyes, and brain. They happen when too many color-making cells grow in the body. These cells make a color thing called melanin that makes skin, hair, and eyes have color. Too many of these cells can lead to dark spots on the skin and in the eyes. In some cases, it can also cause troubles like shaking, learning slowly, and having trouble seeing.\n\n#### Section 3: What is a Big Birthmark?\nA big birthmark is a kind of mark that appears at birth or within the first few months of life. It is caused by too many color-making cells and can be different sizes, from a few inches to very big. Big birthmarks can be found on any part of the body, but they are most commonly found on the body and arms or legs. They can be either colored or not colored and can come with other birth problems.\n\n#### Section 4: Signs and Finding Out\nSigns of skin spots and big birthmarks can be different depending on how serious the problem is. In some cases, there may be no signs at all, while in others, there may be big troubles like shaking, learning slowly, and having trouble seeing.\n\nFinding out if someone has skin spots and big birthmarks usually involves a doctor looking at the person, asking about their health, and doing picture tests like a brain picture or body scan. In some cases, a small piece of skin may need to be taken to make sure.\n\n#### Section 5: Help\nHelp for skin spots and big birthmarks depends on how serious the problem is and if there are any other troubles. In some cases, no help is needed, while in others, operation, special treatment, or medicine may be suggested.\n\n#### Section 6: Ending\nIn this lesson, we learned about skin spots and big birthmarks, their signs, and how doctors find out if someone has them and helps them feel better. We also talked about why it is important to find out early and get help to prevent bigger troubles. By understanding the basics of skin spots and big birthmarks, we can better understand why regular doctor visits and checks are important to find and manage these problems.\n\n#### Words to Remember\n- Spotty skin problem (SSP): A rare problem where there are colored spots on the skin and eyes, and it can cause slow learning and seeing problems.\n- Big birthmark (BB): A type of birthmark that shows up at birth or in the first few months.

{"text": "Lesson: The Art of Ryan\n\nIntroduction: \nIn this lesson, we will explore the art of Ryan. Ryan is a painter from the US known for his real-life style. His work often shows nature, people, and objects. We will learn about how he paints, his styles, and themes.\n\nSection 1: How Ryan Paints and His Styles\n\nRyan is known for his real-life style, which means that he paints things as they look in real life. He paints directly onto the paper without any first drawing. This lets him make a painting that looks quick and full of life.\n\nRyan also paints on a wet paper. This makes a soft, fuzzy look that adds more feeling and texture to the painting. He also uses a method where he puts a thin see-through layer of paint over a not see-through layer. This makes a shiny effect and adds more feeling to the painting.\n\nSection 2: Themes and Subjects\n\nRyan's work often shows nature, people, and objects. He is known for his nature scenes, which often show hills, trees, and fields. His people are often shown in a natural place, and he often includes animals in his paintings.\n\nRyan's objects often show everyday things such as fruits, flowers, and books. He uses bright colors and detailed patterns to make these normal things look special.\n\nSection 3: Practical Examples\n\nLet's look closer at one of Ryan's paintings, \"The Old Mill.\" In this painting, we can see Ryan's use of painting directly and painting on wet paper. The brush strokes can be seen, and the colors are put on in a way that makes a feeling of movement and energy.

{"text": "\n\nLesson: Introduction to Helping Out\n\n## Section 1: Ideas\n\nHelping out is the process of asking and collecting helps as a way of giving long-term support for a group or cause. It involves finding potential helpers, connecting them with the group's mission, and convincing them to give help or other things. Helping out is very important for non-profit groups, schools, and charities to keep doing their work and reach their goals.\n\n## Section 2: Practical Examples\n\nLet's think about a school that needs to collect money for a new prize program. The team at the school finds people who like the school very much. They create a nice message showing how the prize helps students and makes the school better. The team also sets up fun events and activities to include old students and people in the town. With these actions, they successfully collect a lot of money to start the prize program.\n\n## Part 3: Real Stories\n\nIn this part, we will look at real stories that show why collecting money is important for different groups and reasons.\n\n1. Helping Groups: Helping groups need to collect money to support their programs and help. For example, a local animal home might have an event to collect money for medicine and food for the animals they take care of.\n\n2. Schools: Schools often collect money to support learning programs, important projects, and student prizes. For example, a school might start a big money collection to collect money for a new building to make its science classes better.\n\n3. Giving Groups: Giving groups also need to collect money to do their good work. For example, a group that builds homes for families who need help might have an event to collect money for building stuff and workers.\n\n## Word List\n\n- Collecting Money: The action of asking for and getting help as a way of having money for a group or reason for a long time.\n- Helper: A person or group that gives money or other things to a reason or group.\n- Big Money Collection: A money collection that tries to get a lot of money over a long time, usually for a special project or plan.\n\n## The End\n\nCollecting money is a very important action for groups and reasons that want to keep doing their work and reach their goals. By understanding the ideas, looking at practical examples, and exploring real stories, we can understand better why collecting money is important and its role in helping different parts of our community.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 904, "idx": 463198, "original text": "IPFW Advancement Division Development.

Baker Mayfield thinks so\n\nWith everyone looking for the next young, creative mind to lead their NFL team, get ready to hear Lincoln Riley\u2019s name a lot over the next couple months.\n\nRiley is 35 years old and has done a remarkable job at Oklahoma. He coached Baker Mayfield to a Heisman Trophy, and Mayfield\u2019s replacement Kyler Murray is probably going to finish in at least the top two this season. Riley is viewed as a great offensive mind. NFL teams have reportedly gone to Norman to ask him about his schemes.\n\nAnd between now and then, there will be endless speculation about Riley and the Browns, due to Mayfield. Mayfield says he hasn\u2019t lobbied Riley, but he does think he\u2019d fit in the NFL.\n\nBaker Mayfield thinks Lincoln Riley would be ready for NFL\n\nMayfield is in a tough position. He\u2019s a rookie. If the Packers say Aaron Rodgers won\u2019t be involved in their coaching search, you can bet nobody in Cleveland is going to ask Mayfield to be involved in that process.\n\nYet, Mayfield is going to be asked about Riley. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising if he did want Riley to come coach him in Cleveland. But he\u2019s putting himself in a bad spot if he lobbies for the Browns to hire Riley.\n\nBut what Mayfield said about Riley being ready for the NFL will resonate, and maybe not just in Cleveland.\n\n\u201cLincoln\u2019s been ready, it\u2019s just who he is and how he coaches and the respect level he\u2019s had from all of his players, how detailed he is,\u2019\u2019 Mayfield said. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s ready but that\u2019s his decision and you know what, he\u2019s got something special there so I don\u2019t think anybody is going to blame him if he stays there for the next 20 years.\u201d\n\nRiley will be a hot name\n\nRiley will be a very interesting name in the NFL coaching carousel. Maybe he never leaves Oklahoma. He has a great program there. But perhaps he wants the challenge, and it\u2019s never bad to strike while your reputation is as high as Riley\u2019s is at the moment.\n\nRiley is more interesting than most candidates because he would be outside of the NFL norm. Many NFL pundits often will reject anything out of the norm. Chip Kelly had his issues, but many people were against him the moment he was hired from the University of Oregon. Because Riley is young, has a short track record as a head coach (he\u2019s 35 years old, so that\u2019s not really his fault) and no NFL experience, there will be plenty of skepticism. Expect to read and hear many people who will be waiting impatiently for him to fail, if he does decide to make the jump.\n\nBut the league is looking for its next Sean McVay/Matt Nagy/Kyle Shanahan/Frank Reich-type coach, who can be at the forefront of the offensive revolution. Maybe Riley is the next NFL coaching star. Mayfield thinks he\u2019s ready for the challenge.", "hash": "77ad089d9559efa89ccc6a0fd1b869ba774b69f2c486f090b5589761987787e1"}
{"text": "Story: Keeping Leftover Food Safe\n\n**Beginning:** Leftover food is an easy way to save time and work when making meals. But, if not kept right, leftover food can become not safe to eat because of tiny bugs that grow. In this lesson, we will learn how to keep leftover food safe and the right ways to do it.\n\n**Part 1: Why is it important to keep leftover food safe?**\n\nKeeping food safe is important to stay healthy. When food stays out for too long, it can make people sick. So, it is very important to keep leftover food in a cold place like a fridge or a freezer. This helps slow down the bad things in the food and keeps it safe to eat.\n\n**Part 2: How to keep leftover food safe?**\n\n1. Make leftovers into small parts: Instead of keeping food in a big box, make it into smaller boxes for quick cooling. This helps to keep the food safe.\n\n2. Use flat boxes: Flat boxes with lids that are not closed tight right away help to cool leftovers faster. This keeps the food safe.\n\n3. Put food in cold water: Put leftovers in boxes and put them in cold water. This helps to cool the food faster.\n\n4. Close the boxes tightly: Once the leftovers are cool enough, close the boxes tightly to keep bad things out.\n\n5. Keep in the fridge or freezer: Put the leftovers in the fridge or freezer as soon as you can to keep the food safe.\n\n**Part 3: Examples and Practice Questions**\n\n1. What happens if leftovers stay out for too long?\n- Bad things grow in the food and it is not safe to eat.\n\n2. Why is it important to make leftovers into small parts before keeping them?\n- It helps to cool the food faster and keeps it safe.\n\n3. Why do we use flat boxes with lids that are not closed tight right away?\n- They help to cool the leftovers faster and keep the food safe.\n\n**Word List:**\n\n- Fridge: A cool box to keep food fresh.\n- Freezer: A very cool box to keep food fresh for a long time.\n- Bad things: Tiny things that can make people sick when they eat them.\n\n**End:**\n\nKeeping leftover food safe is very important. By doing the right things, you can make sure that your food stays safe to eat and lasts longer. Remember to make leftovers into small parts, use flat boxes, put food in cold water, close the boxes tightly, and keep the leftovers in the fridge or freezer.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 3439, "idx": 241458, "original text": "Leftovers\n\nA term commonly used to describe the excess food that is remaining after being prepared for a meal, snack, or a similar food event. If leftovers are to be kept for future use, they should be stored in a refrigerator or freezer in order to keep the foods from becoming unsafe for consumption. After foods have been prepared with heat and are to be stored as leftovers, it is necessary to reduce the temperature of the leftovers as quickly as possible. There are several ways to accomplish this without leaving the food exposed to warm temperatures for too long of a time, thus cooling too slowly and allowing harmful bacteria to begin to grow. The leftovers can be slowly cooled by placing remaining food items in the refrigerator in shallow containers with lids that are not tightly closed immediately. Once they have chilled sufficiently, they can then be tightly covered and kept for several days or frozen for keeping longer. Foods can be quickly cooled by placing the food in containers and the immersing them in cold water. If the food is in a large container, it may take too long to cool by simply leaving it out on a counter, so it is best to divide the food into smaller portions and begin the cooling process as soon as possible. Food items that are very hot can remain at room temperature for cooling for 30 minutes or less before they are refrigerated.\n\nAs a general guide, leftover foods such as meat, fish, poultry, pasta, and eggs may be kept refrigerated for 3 to 5 days, depending on previous care. Foods that have been prepared and have remained for 1 to 2 hours in temperatures ranging from 40\u00ba F to 140\u00ba F have the potential to grow bacteria and become unsafe for consumption. Therefore, keep leftovers safe by cooling them quickly and refrigerate them as soon as possible to keep them free from harmful bacteria growth.\n\nFreezing foods (storing at 0\u00baF or below) enables the leftovers to be kept for considerably longer periods of time ranging from one to several months after which they begin to deteriorate in flavor and texture. When freezing foods, make sure they are wrapped or stored in airtight containers for best results. After they are thawed, they should be consumed within 2 to 3 days.\n\nAs a general rule, use an appliance thermometer to periodically check temperatures in refrigerators and freezers to assure they are adequately cooling foods. It is also important to make sure foods are not packed tightly into refrigerated areas, since cool air should circulate around the food to keep it safe.\n\nBefore using leftovers, examine the food for any harmful changes. Common occurrences such as color changes (browning or whitening), excess slime, drying out, cracking, ice crystal formations, mold, dissolving fluids, and rancid odors are all indications a harmful change may have occurred requiring disposal of the food. Although appearance may indicate problems with the food, never trust a sense of smell, feel or sight to totally insure proper inspection, because food can spoil without showing indications that bacteria is present. Therefore, always discard food that may be questionable. When reheating leftovers, make sure the food is rapidly heated to a temperature of 74\u00baC (165\u00baF). Liquids such as soups, sauces and gravies should be heated to a boiling point rapidly before being served.\n\nLeftovers Reviews\n\nThere currently aren't any reviews or comments for this term.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Light Beams\n\nOverview:\nIn this lesson, we will learn about light beams and how they are used in moving things like toy cars. We will explore what light beams are, how they work, and why they are important for moving things.\n\nObjectives:\nBy the end of this lesson, students will be able to:\n\n- Understand what light beams are and why they are used\n- Explain how light beams work\n- Understand how light beams help moving things\n- Think about how we could use light beams in the future\n\nSection 1: Learning About Light Beams\n\n**What are Light Beams?**What are Light Beams?**\nLight beams are like a flashlight that helps to see things and understand where they are. They are used in things like toy cars, flying toys, and robots to help them see where they are going.\n\n**Why are Light Beams Important?**Why are Light Beams Important?**\nLight beams are important for moving things because they help them see where they are going. They can see small things, like a toy person or a toy bike, and understand how far away they are. This helps moving things decide where to go and avoid bumping into stuff.\n\nSection 2: How Light Beams Work\n\n**How do Light Beams Work?**How do Light Beams Work?**\nLight beams work by shining a light and seeing how long it takes for the light to bounce back after it hits something. The toy or robot then knows how far away the thing is. By moving the light around, it can see everything around it.\n\n**Good Things About Light Beams**\nLight beams are really good for a few reasons:\n\n- They are very accurate: Light beams can understand how far away things are.\n- They can see a lot: Light beams can see everything around the toy or robot, helping it know where to go.\n- They work in any weather: Light beams can work even if it's rainy or foggy, which is better than a camera or a radar.\n\nSection 3: Using Light Beams \n\n**Using Light Beams in Moving Things**\nIn moving things, light beams are used to see other things like other moving things, toy people, or toy bikes. They also help the moving thing understand where it is and decide the best way to get to where it wants to go.\n\n**The Future of Light Beams**\nLight beams have a great future in helping things move. As more moving things are made, they will need to see where they are going. Light beams could also be used in flying toys for delivering things or in robots for different uses, like finding lost things.\n\nWords to Know:\n- Light beams: A way to see things and understand where they are\n- Moving things: Things that can move on their own\n- Helpers: Things that notice changes around us and tell other machines\n\nConclusion:\nLidar tech is very important for cars that drive themselves, giving clear and detailed info about what's around them.

It is a sensor that is used for many autonomous car designs. The same technology is used to detect speeding violations and to outline terrain from airplanes.\n\nWaymo, the self-driving car program, is one of many that uses lidar. Waymo is currently looking for East Valley volunteers to use its automated vehicles for free rides around the metro area for the entire family.\n\nThe technology uses near-infrared light to detect the shape of objects around it. Lidar can produce exact 3D images of everything from trees to cars to cyclists in many environments and under different lighting conditions. Although autonomous car designs use many different sensors, including radar, ultrasonic and video cameras, lidar has unique abilities. Lidar can for example not be fooled by shadows or be blinded by bright sunlight.\n\nThe biggest obstacle to widespread lidar adoption is cost, and that is where a number of battles are being waged.\n\nWhen GO company originally started with autonomous vehicle research eight years ago, a lidar sensor made by Velodyne Lidar, an industry leader, cost about $75,000. Although Velodyne declined to comment on the current price, Jack Krafcik, Waymo\u2019s chief executive, mentioned recently that his company had reduced the cost of its lidar system by 90 percent.\n\nEven at $7,500, such systems are regarded as being too expensive for car manufacturers.\n\nThe race to fill that gap is mainly focused on the manufacture of solid-state lidar systems. This would reduce the size of the sensors by eliminating moving parts involved in optical mechanisms and enable mass manufacturing that would ultimately reduce costs.\n\nEstablished automotive suppliers, such as Valeo and Velodyne; technology companies like Uber and Waymo; and relative newcomers like LeddarTech, Innoviz and Quanergy are all trying to make cheaper sensors.\n\nSolid-state lidars generally have a reduced field of view \u2013 about 120 degrees compared to the 360-degree view that rooftop models are capable of. To create all round vision, four to six solid-state lidar sensors would have to be integrated.\n\nMost researchers working on lidar designs believe they can manufacture them for much lower prices. In its Ioniq autonomous test cars, Hyundai has demonstrated how such sensors could be made less conspicuous by concealing them in the bumpers and roof pillars of vehicles.\n\nLuminar Technologies is focusing on extending the effective range of lidar to more than 200 meters. Current top-of-the-line sensors have a range of 120 meters. Austin Russell, Luminar\u2019s chief executive, noted that they achieved the extended range by using more sensitive receivers, as well as more powerful light outputs that are still safe enough to not damage people\u2019s vision.\n\nVelodyne claims to be the only third-party lidar supplier for fully autonomous vehicles currently being tested. The company is aware that start-ups are gunning for its business and is working on its own solid-state Velarray lidar sensor. Mike Jellen, Velodyne president revealed that they plan on starting mass production next year.\n\nIn spite of considerable speculation about Velodyne\u2019s lidar pricing, Jellen declined to estimate how much their new sensors might cost, saying only that a complete lidar sensor package might be priced in the \u201clow thousands\u201d per vehicle.\n\nJeffrey Owens, chief technology officer for Delphi expects that in five years, the price could be about $8,000, dropping down to $5,000 by 2025. Delphi recently announced it was working with BMW, Intel and Mobileye on an autonomous driving platform.", "hash": "887dacc404733f9143f8836d2d06b748150c72ef60c7ae323a777e363c78c1f3"}

{"text": "Lesson: Learning about Plant Behavior\n\n### Beginning\nIn this lesson, we will learn about how plants behave in different soil and how it changes their growth. We will also learn about the role of tiny parts inside the plant in this process and how important it is for the plant.\n\n### Learning Goals\n- Understand what being okay with soapiness means and why it is important for plants\n- Learn how little ropes help plants grow and get bigger\n- Know the job of a special helper in making plants okay with soapiness\n- Use what you learned to talk about real things that happen with plants growing and getting bigger\n\n### Part 1: Being Okay with Soapiness in Plants\n\nBeing okay with soapiness means a plant's ability to grow and get bigger when the dirt it's in is very soapy. Very soapy dirt can make it hard for plants to grow because it can stop them from getting what they need, slow down helpers in the plant, and hurt the plant's parts. So, plants have different ways to deal with soapy stress and keep growing and getting bigger.\n\n### Part 2: How Little Ropes Help Plants Grow and Get Bigger\n\nLittle ropes are thin, bendy ropes made of a special stuff that is part of the plant's skeleton. This skeleton is a network of these special ropes that help the plant stay strong and keep its shape. They have an important job in helping plants grow and get bigger by helping plant parts divide, expand, and move.\n\nWhen plants deal with soapy stress, these little ropes can change, leading to changes in how the plant grows and gets bigger. For example, soapy stress can make the little ropes come apart, which can stop plant parts from dividing and expanding, and this can affect the growth of the plant's roots.\n\n### Part 3: Why a Special Helper is Important for Plants Being Okay with Soapiness\n\nThis special helper is a helper that has an important job in making plants react to soapy stress. It has been found that making this helper active can make the little ropes stable, which can make the plant more okay with soapy conditions.\n\nIn a look at plants, it was found that plants with a always active special helper had a better time dealing with soapy stress compared to normal plants. This was because the little ropes coming apart was slower in these plants, which let them keep growing and getting bigger when the dirt was very soapy.\n\n### Part 4: Using What You Learned for Real Things\n\nUnderstanding how little ropes and the special helper help plants be okay with soapiness can help us come up with ways to make plants grow and get bigger in soapy dirt. For example, by changing how active the special helper is, we may be able to make plants more okay with soapiness, leading to more plants in dirt that is very soapy.\n\nAlso, knowing how plants deal with soapiness can help us find plants that are naturally okay with soapy conditions, which could be used for growing food or fixing land in places with very soapy dirt.\n\n### Wrapping Up\n\nIn this lesson, we have learned about why it's important for plants to be okay with soapiness and how little ropes and the special helper help with this. By using these ideas for real things, we can come up with ways to help plants grow and get bigger in soapy dirt.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1549, "idx": 339055, "original text": "The alkaline tolerance in Arabidopsis requires stabilizing microfilament partially through inactivation of PKS5 kinase.\nHigh soil pH is harmful to plant growth and development. The organization and dynamics of microfilament (MF) cytoskeleton play important roles in the plant anti-alkaline process. In the previous study, we determined that alkaline stress induces a signal that triggers MF dynamics-dependent root growth. In this study we identified that PKS5 kinase involves in this regulatory process to facilitate the signal to reach the downstream target MF. Under pH 8.3 treatment, the depolymerization of MF was faster in pks5-4 (PKS5 kinase constitutively activated) than that in wild-type plants. The inhibition of wild-type, pks5-1, and pks5-4 root growth by pH 8.3 was correlated to their MF depolymerization rate. When the plants were treated with phalloidin to stabilize MF, the high pH sensitive phenotype of pks5-4 can be partially rescued. When the plants were treated with a kinase inhibitor Staurosporine, the MF depolymerization rate in pks5-4 was similar as that in wild-type under pH 8.3 treatment and the sensitivity of root growth was also rescued. However, when the plants were treated with LaCl(3), a calcium channel blocker, the root growth sensitivity of pks5-4 under pH 8.3 was rescued but MF depolymerization was even faster than that of plants without LaCl(3) treatment. These results suggest that the PKS5 involves in external high pH signal mediated MF depolymerization, and that may be independent of calcium signal.", "hash": "2dc8cca9e5d4db92f3865c80d27a2641b7cf33e54a92e0df031554500df900dd"}
{"text": "Lesson Title: Making Music Better\n\nIntroduction: Making music better is a fun job that needs us to change the original song to make it easier to play and nicer to hear. In this lesson, we will learn how to make music better, including adding directions for the bow, fingers, and other signs to improve how the song sounds.\n\nSection 1: Learning How to Make Music Better\n\nTopic 1: What is making music better?\nMaking music better needs us to change the original song to make it sound better, easier to read, and easier to play. This may need us to add or change directions for the bow, fingers, how loud or soft to play, and other signs to improve how the song sounds.\n\nTopic 2: Why is making music better important?\nMaking music better is important because it helps people who play the music to play the song more correctly and nicely. It also makes sure that what the person who wrote the song wanted is kept and that the song is played the way it should be.\n\nTopic 3: Who can make music better?\nAnyone who knows a lot about music and how to play it can make music better. But, people who do this job usually know a lot about music and how to play it.\n\nSection 2: Adding Directions for the Bow, Fingers, and Other Signs\n\nTopic 1: Directions for the bow\nDirections for the bow tell us which way to move the bow on the strings of the instrument. They are very important for making the song sound smooth and nice. People who make music better add or change these directions to improve how the song flows and to make it easier for the person playing it.\n\nTopic 2: Directions for the fingers\nDirections for the fingers tell us which finger to use to play a note. They are very important for playing the song correctly. People who make music better add or change these directions to make the song easier to play and to make sure that the person playing it can do it easily.\n\nTopic 3: How to play a note\nSigns tell us how to play a note, like short and detached, smooth and connected, or held for full value. They are very important for making the song sound clear and nice. People who make music better add or change these signs to improve how clear and nice the song sounds.\n\nSection 3: Using How to Make Music Better in Real Life\n\nTopic 1: Ryan's Making of a Famous Drama's Music Better\nRyan, a former main cellist of a famous music group, made the cello part for the music from a famous drama better. He added his own directions for the bow, fingers, and other signs to improve how the song sounds.\n\nTopic 2: Using How to Make Music Better in Practice\nTo use what you learned in this lesson, you can make a song better yourself or work with a person who does this job to improve how correct, easy to read, and easy to play the song is. You can also use a computer program to change the music.\n\nWords to Remember:\n- Bowings: How the bow moves across the strings\n- Fingerings: Numbers or letters showing which finger to use for a note\n- Articulations: Marks showing how to play a note\n\nEnding:\nChanging music scores is a big job that means making the original song better and easier to play. By adding bowings, fingerings, and other marks, you can make the song sound better and keep the song maker's ideas safe. By using these ways, you can play better and help keep songs safe.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 911, "idx": 303775, "original text": "The cello part for the Overture from Rossini's William Tell has been edited by Ronald Leonard, principal cellist of the Los Angeles Philharmonic from 1975 until 1999.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Houses\n\nIntroduction:\nBuying houses to make money is called real estate investment. It helps people to save money. In this lesson, we will learn the basics of buying houses, like how to pick good houses, how to count money made, and how to avoid problems.\n\nSection 1: Picking Good Houses\n\nTopic 1: Place\nWhere a house is located is very important. It can change how much the house is worth, how much money it can make, and how much its price can go up. Think about these things when looking at a house:\n\n- Neighborhood: Is it safe, quiet, and clean?\n- Near useful places: How close are shops, schools, and buses or trains?\n- Easy to reach: Can you get to the house easily by car or bus or train?\n- Future building: Are new buildings or roads planned nearby?\n\nTopic 2: House Condition\nHow good a house looks and works is also very important. A nice house can make more money and cost less to fix. A bad house can cost more to fix and make less money. Think about these things when looking at a house:\n\n- Outside: Is the roof, walls, and garden good?\n- Inside: Are the floors, walls, and things like fridge and stove good?\n- Systems: Do the water, electricity, and heating work well?\n- Worn out: Has the house been cared for, or does it need a lot of fixing?\n\nTopic 3: Money Matters\nWhen looking at a house, it's important to know if it can make money. This means knowing how much money it can make and how much it costs to own it. To do this, you need to know:\n\n- Buying price: How much will you pay for the house?\n- First payment: How much of the price will you pay first?\n- Loan: How much will you borrow, and what is the interest and time to pay back?\n- Costs: What are the costs of owning the house, like insurance, taxes, and fixing?\n\nCounting: Money Made = (Income + Money Saved From Wear and Tear) / Cost of House\n\nSection 2: Counting Money Made\n\nTopic 1: Money Left Over\nMoney left over after all costs are paid is called cash flow. It's important because it shows if the house will make money. To count money left over, use this:\n\nMoney Left Over = (Rent Money - Costs) - Loan Payment\n\nTopic 2: Value Going Up\nA house's value can go up over time. This can add to the money made from the house. To guess if a house's value will go up, think about:\n\n- Market trends: Are house prices in the area going up or down?\nLesson: Learn about Houses and Clothes\n\n## Section 1: What is a House?\nA house is a place where people live. Some houses are small, some are big. Some houses are old, and some are new. People take care of their houses to make them nice and comfortable.\n\n## Section 2: Why are Houses Important?\nHouses are important because they give us a place to live, eat, and sleep. They keep us safe from the weather like rain, wind, and snow. We can play, learn, and grow in our houses. That's why we need to take care of them.\n\n## Section 3: What is a Shirt?\nA shirt is a piece of clothing that we wear. Shirts can be big or small, long or short. Shirts can be different colors like red, blue, green, or yellow. They can be soft and comfortable to wear.\n\n## Conclusion\nIn conclusion, houses and shirts are important things in our life. Houses keep us safe and comfortable, and shirts help us stay warm and look nice.

We worked at Cultivate HKNY's rooftop garden in Hell's Kitchen, Wanaqua Garden in the Bronx, and P.S 33 Chelsea Prep. What made this summer so special was that each of the gardens had its own unique identity.\n\nP.S. 33 Chelsea Prep\n\nWe have been working at the garden in P.S 33 Chelsea Prep, a local elementary school, by doing regular maintenance that includes watering, weeding, and harvesting. One project we accomplished was assembling the irrigation system across the vegetable garden, which allowed the plants to grow and flourish. We were able to harvest all sorts of vegetables, including cucumbers, fennel, jalapenos, cabbage, tomatoes, peppers, lemon basil, eggplants, bell peppers, and Swiss chard.\n\nGreen Council members Christine and Sarah fix the irrigation lines in the children's gardens at P.S. 33. Chelsea Prep.\n\n\"P.S. 33 provided us a brand-new experience by allowing us to work with a different style of gardening where we replaced the soil in a garden with water,\" said Green Council member Darnell Maxwell.\n\nHell's Kitchen Rooftop Garden\n\nAt the Hell's Kitchen rooftop garden, we helped harvest vegetables for the food pantry that gives food to local residents. The supervisors at the location allowed us to experiment with a crop. Our group chose radishes\u2014and it turned out that radishes do well on the rooftop! Throughout our time there we harvested tomatoes, beans, sunflowers, basil, rosemary, sage, and lot of kale, lettuce, and Swiss chard.\n\n\"The Hell's Kitchen rooftop project made Green Council really come together as a team to accomplish many tasks, even under the burning sun,\" said Kelly Elugardo, a Green Council member.\n\nWanaqua Garden\n\nWe recently started helping the Wanaqua Garden in the Bronx get ready for the fall. During our work at the garden, we helped weed and mulch. One of our leaders, D'en Vargas, made work lighter by singing \"This Is Me\" from the movie Camp Rock with our members. One of Wanaqua's gardeners, Don Carlos, taught some of our members a special technique to handle a hoe, which made our work easier.\n\nDon Carlos teaches Green Council members how to properly use a hoe.\n\n\"The diverse activities, such as mulching, carpentry and more, provide a memorable experience for anyone,\" said Green Council member Wan Yi Ng.\n\nWorking with Green Council has allowed us to make connections between horticulture and our community, and has personally inspired my dream of becoming a landscape architect. As we conclude this summer, we want to thank our funders for making this program possible. We wish all the best to the new members that will be hired in the fall.\n\nHigh Line Youth \u2013 part of High Line Community Engagement \u2013 is generously supported by Ford Foundation.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Sharing and Its Effect on Trading\nIntroduction:\nSharing is a way of putting together different things and giving them to people who want them. It's an important part of trading, helping places to be careful and get more things. In this lesson, we will learn what sharing is, why it's good, and how it changes trading.\nWhat is Sharing?\nSharing is when you create new things to trade by putting together different items like gifts, house payments, or credit card bills. These items are then packed into things for trading and given to people who want them. The person who first had the items, usually a bank or a trading place, keeps a little bit of the worry about these items.\nGood Things About Sharing:\n1. Being Careful: Sharing helps places be careful by giving some of the worry about the items to people who want them.\n2. Getting More Things: Sharing lets places get more things by giving things for trading to people, which can be used to give out new gifts.\n3. Trading: Sharing gives more things for trading to the market by creating new things to trade that can be traded like any other thing.\nEffect on Trading:\nSharing has changed trading a lot, especially in the areas of getting more credit and being careful. By letting places be careful and get more things, sharing has helped the growth of credit markets. However, it has also been blamed for causing trading problems, like the house problem of 2008.

{"text": "Title: Putting a Stay-At-Top Button on Windows' Top Bar\n\n## Chapter 1: Beginning\n\nIn this story, we will learn how to put a \"Stay-At-Top\" button on Windows' top bar. This button helps us keep a box on top of other boxes, even when we go to another game or room. This trick is very helpful for doing many things at once and keeping important boxes where we can see them.\n\n## Chapter 2: Ideas\n\nA \"Stay-At-Top\" button is a trick that helps a box stay on top of other boxes, even when we go to another game or room. This trick is also called \"sticky\" or \"keep-high\" trick. To make this trick work, we need to change the box's rules.\n\n## Chapter 3: Fun Examples\n\nTo put a \"Stay-At-Top\" button on Windows' top bar, we can use a simple trick. We need to change the box's rules by adding a rule to the top bar. Here's how to do it:\n\n1. Right-click on the top bar of the box that you want to keep on top.\n2. Pick \"Rules\" from the pop-up menu.\n3. In the rules box, click on the \"Extra\" tab.\n4. Look for the \"Place\" part and find the \"Always on top\" tick box.\n5. Tick the tick box to make the \"Always on top\" trick work.\n\nNow, every time you make the box smaller or bigger, the \"Stay-At-Top\" button will show up in the top bar next to the make smaller/bigger/close buttons.\n\n## Chapter 4: Talking to Ourselves\n\nIs it a good idea to keep a box always on top? While this trick can be useful for some games, it can also be confusing and make us do less work. It's important to think about why we need the box and if it's necessary to keep it always on top.\n\n## Word List\n\n- Stay-At-Top: A trick that helps a box stay on top of other boxes, even when we go to another game or room.\n- Top Bar: The bar at the top of a box that has the box's name and buttons for making smaller, bigger, and closing the box.\n- Rules: Things used to tell a game or trick what to do.\n- Pop-Up Menu: A menu that shows up when you right-click on a thing.\n- Place: Where a thing is on the screen.\n- Extra: A button that lets us see extra options.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1115, "idx": 107416, "original text": "Q:\n\nCan I get an always-on-top button in windows' titlebar (alongside with minimize/maximize/close buttons)?\n\nI use to use always-on-top windows frequently and make them such by setting the option in windows' right click menu.

They are known for their long snouts, which help them catch fish. In this lesson, we will learn about what they look like, what they eat, and where they live.\n\n## Section 2: Real Life Examples\n\nLet's imagine we see a crocodile in its home. We might see that it has a dark green color on top, with lighter spots on its belly. Its tail also has a lot of spots or is black. We can use what we know about what it eats to guess what it might be doing. Since it mostly eats fish, we would think it's looking for fish in the water.\n\n## Section 3: Questions to Think About\n\nOne question we might ask is why the crocodile has a long snout. One possible answer is that it helps it catch fish better. A long snout lets it catch fish faster and more accurately. Another guess is that the long snout helps it not fight with other animals that might want the same food. By being really good at catching fish, the crocodile doesn't have to worry about bigger animals that might want the same space.\n\n## Words to Know\n\n- **Crocodile**: a type of reptile\n- **kind**: a type of crocodile\n- **green**: a mix of blue and yellow color\n- **spotted**: marked with little spots\n- **bottom**: the lower side of something\n- **tail**: the back part of an animal's body\n- **patience**: the ability to wait or endure\n\n## End\n\nIn this lesson, we learned about a big green animal, including what it looks like, what it eats, and where it lives.

Protective scales cover the back of the neck and merge into the scales on the back. Unlike other members of genus Crocodylus, there are four rows of these scales instead of two. They are a dark olive color on top (brighter in the young) and lighter on their underside. They do have dark blotches on their underside and their tail is usually heavily blotched or black.\n\nThe diet of an African Slender-snouted crocodile consists primarily of fish and small aquatic invertebrates. However, the larger crocodiles will eat larger animals if given the chance.\n\nAfrican Slender-snouted crocodiles are found in Central and Western Africa.

HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Ghana is 17.5%, which is 15 times higher than that of the general population. Stigma against same-sex behaviors and identities are common in Ghana and often intertwined with symbolic HIV-related stigma beliefs, perpetuating the notion that infection is divine punishment for MSM. MSM who do not conform to local masculine gender norms are especially vulnerable to stigma. These stigmas can be major contributors to disengagement from HIV care for fear of ridicule and mistreatment. Linkage to and retention in HIV care are critical for achieving viral suppression, improving symptom management, and reducing risk of mortality. Disengagement can lead to decreased access to antiretroviral therapy and concomitant increases in HIV viral load, HIV symptoms and HIV symptom distress. Nonetheless, despite the extremely high HIV prevalence in MSM in Ghana, there are gaps in scientific knowledge regarding how intersecting HIV, same-sex, and gender nonconformity stigmas are associated with HIV care linkage and retention, HIV viral load and HIV symptom distress. Further, it is unknown if associations between stigmas and clinical outcomes are mediated by decreased linkage and retention in HIV care. We propose three aims to narrow these knowledge gaps and support future intervention research. In Aim 1 we will recruit venue-based (n=150) and peer-driven (n=75) samples of HIV positive MSM from four Ghanaian cities with the highest HIV prevalence in MSM, and compare the two strategies for which one produces the greatest yield of MSM that are disengaged from care. We will also conduct brief interviews with a subset of recruiters from the peer-driven sample to explore what challenges (including stigmas) were encountered during recruitment. In Aim 2 we will use structured survey data to test potential mediators (i.e., HIV care linkage and retention) that may explain associations between stigmas and clinical outcomes in the combined venue-based and peer-driven samples (N=225). The survey will include psychometrically validated scales for HIV, same-sex, and gender non-conformity stigmas and HIV symptom distress. HIV viral load will be quantified from venipuncture blood samples. In Aim 3 we will conduct an interpretive ethnography using qualitative interviews from MSM purposively selected from the combined sample because they were diagnosed with HIV late in the course of the disease (n=10) or because they have high HIV symptom distress scores, but are not linked to care (n=10) or were previously linked to HIV care but are not currently engaged (n=10). Interview data will be triangulated with other data collected throughout our time in the field, including unobtrusive observations, field notes, and digital photographs (artifacts) that document elements of the social and cultural contexts of the MSM. Findings from this study will lay the groundwork for the design of a field- based HIV care coordination intervention that integrates peer-outreach to identify MSM not currently in care and peer-support/mentoring strategies to help mitigate the impacts of stigmas on linkage and retention in care.", "hash": "0b2492897f69dab493a00c7b4d319522c6a805d77d1d67d1461011c2cc647b2f"}

They help understand the rules of the country. But, they can only do their job if people think they are fair. In this story, we will learn about being fair in the Big Decision Group and why it is important.\n\nChapter 1: What is Being Fair?\nBeing fair means that people think something is right. For the Big Decision Group, being fair is very important because it decides if people will listen to them. If the Group is not fair, people may not listen to them and it may cause problems.\n\nChapter 2: Why is Being Fair Important?\nBeing fair is very important for the Big Decision Group to do their job. If the Group does not have the support of the people, they cannot solve problems and make decisions that everyone agrees with. Also, if the big court isn't good, it may not be able to keep its power over small courts. This can make the court system messy.\n\nPart 3: How can the big court stay good?\nThere are a few ways the big court can stay good. One way is to make sure its choices are based on good rules and old choices. Another way is to be open in how it makes choices and to give simple and short reasons for its choices. Lastly, the court must think about how its choices change things for people and work to make sure they are fair and right.\n\nPart 4: Ending\nTo end, the goodness of the big court is very important to how well it works and keeps order in the court system.

A party planner is a helper who works with the friends to make a plan for their party. They help decide when things will happen, who will do what, and make sure everything is ready on the party day. They also help the friends know how much money they can spend and make sure everything is perfect on the party day.\n\nLast, we'll talk about why it's important to know how much money we can spend. Knowing how much money we can spend is important because it helps the friends decide what they want most and how much money they can use for each thing. It also helps them not to spend too much money and have problems later. There are many ways to decide how much money we can spend, but the most important thing is to be honest and know what we can really afford.\n\n### Part 3: Let's Think and Talk\nNow that we have learned simple ideas and real-life examples of party planning, let's think and talk about it.\n\n**Question 1: Why is it good to have a party planner?**Question 1: Why is it good to have a party planner?**\n- They know a lot about planning parties, which can save you time and worry.\n- They can help you know how much money you can spend and make sure everything is perfect on the party day.\n- They can give good ideas and tips because they know a lot about parties.\n\n**Question 2: What makes planning a party hard?**Question 2: What makes planning a party hard?**\n- There are many things to think about, like the place, food, decorations, and music.\n- It can be hard to make the friends and their families and guests all happy.\n- There is often a lot of worry to make the party just right, which can make you feel stressed and worried.\n\n**Question 3: How can friends make sure they don't spend too much money on their party?**Question 3: How can friends make sure they don't spend too much money on their party?**\n- Make a money plan that is real and follow it.\n- Decide to spend money on the most important parts of the party.\nLet's think about ways to save, like talking to people who sell things or making some decorations yourself.\n\n### Words to Know\n- Wedding: When two people join together because they love each other.\n- Wedding Planner: A person who helps people plan their special day.\n- Budget: A plan for how to use money so you don't spend too much.\n\n### What We Learned\nIn this story, we learned about planning a special day, including different types of special days, the job of a wedding planner, and why having a budget is important. We also talked about good and hard parts of planning a special day, and how not to spend too much money. By knowing these things, people can have a special day that shows their love for each other.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 940, "idx": 266749, "original text": "Napa Wedding Packages.

{"text": "Lesson: How to Make a Toy Rocket Go Fast\n\n**Let's Start**\n\nIn this story, we will learn about making a toy rocket go fast. We will talk about how toy rockets work, why they are good, and what they can use to go. We will also learn about parts of a toy rocket and how to make it go. When you finish this story, you will know how to make a toy rocket go fast and use this to solve new problems.\n\n**Part 1: What is a Toy Rocket?**\n\nA toy rocket is a small thing that can go very fast. It uses its speed to make the air go into it and make it go. It does not have any parts that move, making it work better and be lighter than other things that can go. Toy rockets are very good for toys that need to go very fast, like toy planes and toy spaceships, because they can work at many speeds and use little fuel.\n\n**Part 2: What Can Make It Go?**\n\nDepending on the toy and how you want it to go, the thing that makes a toy rocket go can be a liquid, like water, or a gas, like air. Liquids are often used because they are easy to keep and use, but gases can make it go better in some cases.\n\n**Part 3: Parts of a Toy Rocket**\n\nA toy rocket has some parts, including a place for air, a place for fire, and a place for smoke. The place for air brings air towards the place for fire, where the thing that makes it go is mixed with the air and lit to make it go. The place for smoke lets out the hot gases made by the fire, making the toy rocket move forward.\n\n**Part 4: Making It Go**\n\nMaking it go is the part where you put the thing that makes it go into the air so that a mix of air and the thing that makes it go is made, which is then lit to make it go. The thing that makes it go must be made so that the thing that makes it go mixes right with the air and that the mix is lit well.\n\n**Chapter 5: Making a Toy Car**\n\nTo make a toy car, we have to think about a few things. What kind of pretend fuel will we use? How will we mix it? And how will we make the engine work? We want to make sure our toy car works well.\n\n**Chapter 6: What We Learned**\n\nIn this story, we learned about how to make a toy car. We talked about how toy cars work and why they are fun. We also learned about the different parts of a toy car and how to play pretend with it. This helps us think of new games and make better toy cars.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 6635, "idx": 355479, "original text": "The present invention relates to a fuel injection device for a ramjet operating at a high Mach number, for example of about 12 to 15.\nIt is known that ramjets are particularly advantageous for propelling hypersonic aircraft (missiles, airplanes, etc.) since they allow operation over a wide range of Mach numbers, for example from 2 to 15, and they have a low specific fuel consumption. Depending on the application peculiar to an aircraft, and possibly on the flight phase of the latter, the fuel used may be a liquid hydrocarbon, such as kerosene for example, or a gas, such as hydrogen or methane, for example.\nIt is also known that a ramjet includes, on the one hand, at least one oxidizer inlet, usually consisting of an air duct or an air intake, which directs an oxidizer flow (i.e. air) toward a combustion chamber and, on the other hand, at least one injection device which enables the fuel to be injected into said oxidizer flow so as to obtain a flux of oxidizer/fuel mixture which is ignited in said combustion chamber.\nIn ramjets designed to operate at a relatively low Mach number (for example up to Mach 2), such a fuel injection device may consist of a number of elementary injectors arranged in the internal wall of the ramjet, on the periphery of the oxidizer flow.\nHowever, for operation at high Mach numbers, when combustion in the ramjet takes place in a supersonic or hypersonic flow, the fuel can no longer be injected just at the internal wall of the ramjet. This is because, in this case, the penetration of the jets of fuel into the oxidizer flow is too low for it to be possible to obtain good mixing of the oxidizer and the fuel within said flow, so combustion is poor or even impossible. Of course, such a drawback becomes more acute the greater the transverse dimensions of the oxidizer flow.\nThus, in order to remedy this situation, injection devices in the form of rails have already been provided, these devices having a number of elementary injectors distributed over their length and arranged in said oxidizer flow, transversely to the latter, while the ends of said rails are fastened to opposite walls of said ramjet. Such an injection device is generally called an \"injection stub\" and it is used either alone or in combination with fuel injection in the wall.\nBy using injection stubs, it is thus possible to obtain a satisfactory oxidizer/fuel mixture over the entire cross section of the oxidizer flow. More generally, the injection stubs installed in a hypersonic ramjet make it possible:\nto feed fuel into the entire oxidizer flow, despite the low penetration of the jets of fuel into an oxidizer flow at hypersonic velocities; PA1 to increase the proportion of fuel in the oxidizer/fuel mixture; PA1 to assist in the ignition of the oxidizer/fuel mixture and to stabilize the flame; and PA1 to help compress the oxidizer flow, by reducing the rate of flow of fuel taken up by the ramjet. PA1 in that it includes: PA1 in that said skin is joined to said body, in a sealed manner, with its faces pressed against the faces of said wedge, so that a sealed chamber is delimited, in the concavity of said skin, between the latter and said end facet of said body; and PA1 in that, in said body, there are arranged: PA1 the thickness of said thin skin of the nose to be at most equal to 2 mm; PA1 the carbon-carbon composite constituting said thin skin to have a thermal conductivity in the thickness of about 70 W/(m.K) in the range of use temperatures; and PA1 the coolant to be a low-temperature gas, for example hydrogen at a temperature of about 100K to 300K. PA1 if hydrogen is used at a different temperature, it will be possible, all other things being equal, to maintain the thin skin temperature by modifying said flow rate; PA1 if the constituent material of the thin skin withstands a temperature greater than 1500.degree. C., for example 2000.degree. C., this constituent material may have a thermal conductivity of less than 70 W/(m.K) or the cooling may be less powerful; PA1 etc. PA1 a woven fibrous structure, the weft yarns of which are distributed at several levels in the thickness of said skin and each of the warp yarns of which passes around weft yarns at different levels; and PA1 a matrix which encapsulates said fibrous structure and consists of pyrolyzed and graphitized pitch. PA1 the skin makes a dihedral angle of 12.degree. and has a leading-edge radius equal to 1.5 mm; PA1 the skin has a thickness of about 1 mm and its carbon-carbon composite constituent material has a transverse thermal conductivity of about 70 W/(m.K); PA1 the coolant is hydrogen at a temperature of 100K to 300K and at a pressure of about 10 to 15 bar; and PA1 the flow rate of the coolant is about 2 to 5 gls for each cm of length of said leading edge. PA1 at least one longitudinal groove made on the surface of said body and closed off by one face of said nose piece; and PA1 an array of transverse surface grooves bringing said sealed chamber into communication with said longitudinal groove and also closed off by said nose piece.\nSuch injection stubs, which are exposed to the action of the oxidizer flow, therefore each behave, from the aerodynamic standpoint, as an airfoil embedded at its ends in two opposite walls of the ramjet. In addition, on that side of their nose which receives the oxidizer flow, said injection stubs must have a leading edge with a small radius for limiting the pressure drops which would restrict the propulsive performance of the ramjet and could even lead to choking of the oxidizer flow, which can remain hypersonic in the combustion chamber only if the velocity of the oxidizer upstream is sufficiently high.\nHowever, the heat-up of said nose produced by the hypersonic oxidizer flow is approximately inversely proportional to the square root of the radius of the leading edge of said nose. Thus, a nose with a small leading-edge radius heats up a great deal. Moreover, it will be noted that, since said injection stubs are arranged inside the ramjet, it is impossible to cool them by radiation with the air through which the aircraft propelled by said ramjet is flying. Such a nose is therefore exposed to very high temperatures: about 5000K by an aircraft flying at Mach 12 at an altitude of about 30 km. It is therefore necessary to construct the injection stubs from materials such as ceramics, the radius of said leading edge being about 3 to 5 mm. However, in view of the current processes for producing ceramic components, it may readily be imagined that the precision manufacture of ceramic injection stubs, is necessarily lengthy and expensive.", "hash": "8450eddea0eebd3e6bf67db566f6a5b1ee39bfee096ad55a1a6bcbf7c0a333a1"}

AUR had no effect on the conversion of XD to XO at concentrations up to 50 microM, whereas at concentrations ranging from 10 to 25 microM, AuTG and AuTM induced the conversion of XD to XO. The constituents of AuTG and AuTM, aurous ion (Au+), but not mercaptosuccinic acid and 1-thio-beta-D-glucose, converted XD to XO in a similar degree to AuTG and AuTM. This means that Au (I) moiety has an important role in the AuTG- and AuTM-induced conversion of XD to XO. Furthermore, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and British anti-Lewisite (BAL) reconverted AuTG and AuTM-induced XO to XD, implying that clinical activity of NAC and BAL against toxic reactions of AuTG and AuTM is partially due to the XO reconversion. These results suggest that AuTG and AuTM have the potential to convert XD to its reactive oxygen species-generating form, XO, and that this effect may be correlated with cytotoxic actions of these drugs.", "hash": "6c1f932960e60a34958a9e31572499f813b296118870c755a8556ff9705d2cd1"}

For example, between 1960 and 1990 the work death rate for agriculture decreased only 28% while the work death rates decreased 65% for mining and 55% for construction [Purschwitz (1992)]. A national conference in Iowa in 1988 came to the forceful conclusion that \"America's most productive workforce was being systematically liquidated by an epidemic of occupational disease and traumatic death and injury\" [NCASH (1988)]. In 1991, the nation's top public health officer, the U.S. Surgeon General, convened a conference titled \"FarmSafe 2000-A National Coalition for Local Action,\" to formally address agricultural safety and health issues. Importantly, conferees recognized that preventing injury and disease was superior to trying to rehabilitate people after an injury occurred. But does participation in farm safety and health educational programs lead to a reduction in risk of injury from farm work? Questions are being raised about the value of farm safety and health educational information, campaigns, programs, and related activities. The questions have identified a critical gap in the literature of farm safety and health education. There is currently no good evidence demonstrating that farm safety and health education, campaigns, programs, or related activities lead to a relatively stable reduction of risk on the farm. In other words, do farmers and their families actually put to use, in a relatively permanent or stable manner, the educational information regarding elimination, reduction, or control of physical hazards and the modification of work behavior that may cause injury?", "hash": "e4e0b323ba3c05049b6a4cd50fcf91b0838082e4d2e21c99d552345b96c05249"}

{"text": "Lesson Title: Changing Picture Stories\n\nStory:\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a special language that could change one type of story into another. This language was used to change stories from one shape to another, like changing a list story into a picture story. Today, we will learn how to use this magic language to change one story into another story with different characters and events.\n\nStory Plan:\n\nI. What is the magic language?\nII. How does the magic language work?\nIII. Making a magic spell\nIV. Using the magic spell\nV. End of the story\nVI. Word list\n\nI. What is the magic language?\n\nThe magic language is used to change one type of story into another. It is used to change stories from one shape to another, like changing a list story into a picture story.\n\nII. How does the magic language work?\n\nThe magic language works by taking a story as a beginning and using a set of rules to change the story into another story. The rules are set in a magic spell, which is made of parts that match things in the story and tell how they should be changed.\n\nIII. Making a magic spell\n\nTo make a magic spell, you need to make parts that match things in the story and tell how they should be changed. You can use the part to make the spell, and the match to tell which things the part matches.\n\nFor example, let's say we have a story with a note that has a title and a message:\n\nNote:\n  Title: Remember\n  Message: Magic language change\n\nWe can make a magic spell that changes the note into a data with two parts, one for the title and one for the message:\n\nMagic spell match:\n  Data:\n    Title: Note/Title\n    Message: Note/Message\n\nThis spell makes a part that matches the beginning and makes a data with two parts, one for the title and one for the message.\n\nIV. Using the magic spell\n\nTo use the magic spell on a story, you need to give the story to the magic language. The magic language then uses the spell on the story and makes a new story.\n\nFor example, let's say we have the following story:\n\n<note>\n  <heading>Remember</heading>\n  <body>Changing one thing into another</body>\n</note>\n\nWe can make this paper look different:\n\n<data>\n  <heading>Remember</heading>\n  <body>Changing one thing into another</body>\n</data>\n\nV.

{"text": "Title: Juice and Its Effects\n\nIntroduction:\nJuice is a drink that many people around the world enjoy. It is often part of parties, happy times, and rest. But juice can also have not so good effects on our bodies and minds. In this lesson, we will look at the effects of juice, both good and not so good, and learn how to make smart choices about drinking it.\n\nSection 1: Understanding Juice\n\nTopic 1: What is Juice?\nJuice is a liquid found in drinks like apple juice, grape juice, and orange juice. When we drink it, juice can change how our brain and body work.\n\nTopic 2: How does Juice affect the Body?\nWhen juice is drunk, it goes into our blood and travels to the brain. It changes how the brain works by messing up the talks between nerve cells. This can make us make bad choices, move badly, and talk funny. Juice can also change the liver, which helps clean bad stuff from the body. Drinking too much juice for a long time can hurt the liver and cause other health problems.\n\nTopic 3: What are the short-term effects of Juice?\nDrinking juice can make us make bad choices, move badly, talk funny, and not care about rules. Drinking too much juice can also make us throw up, feel dizzy, and even pass out. These effects go away after resting and drinking water.\n\nTopic 4: What are the long-term effects of Juice?\nDrinking juice for a long time can hurt the liver, make us want more juice, and increase the risk of getting sick. These effects can stay and can cause serious health problems.\n\nSection 2: Drinking Juice the Right Way\n\nTopic 1: How can I drink juice the right way?\nTo drink juice the right way, it is important to know your limit and stick to it. This means knowing how much juice you can drink before reaching your limit and not playing drinking games. It is also important to eat before and while drinking to slow down how fast the juice goes into the blood. Finally, never drink and drive or use big machines while drinking juice.\n\nTopic 2: What happens if I drink juice the wrong way?\nDrinking juice the wrong way can lead to bad things, like accidents, getting hurt, and even death. Drinking and driving is one of the main reasons why young people die. Also, doing dangerous things while drinking juice can lead to unexpected babies, getting sick, and other health problems.\n\nSection 3: Juice and How We Feel\n\nTopic 1: Can juice cause problems with how we feel?\nYes, juice can cause problems like feeling sad, worried, and even thinking about bad things. This is because juice changes the balance in the brain, which can lead to mood changes and other problems with how we feel.\n\nTopic 2: Can juice help feel better when sad?\nFor some kids, juice may help feel better when they are scared or sad for a little while. But, this feeling does not last for a long time and can make things worse later. It is important to talk to a grown-up if you are feeling sad or scared a lot.\n\nConclusion:\nIn the end, juice can make us feel good and bad. It is important to know when drinking juice is okay and how much to drink. By drinking juice carefully and talking to grown-ups when needed, we can enjoy juice and stay happy and healthy.\n\nGlossary:\n- Juice: A drink we can find in things like apple juice, orange juice, and grape juice.\n- Sugar: Another name for what makes juice sweet.\n- Stomach: A part of our body that helps break down food.\n- Wanting more: When we can't stop doing something even if it's not good for us.\n- Sickness: When our body is not working right.\n- Heart problem: When our heart is not working right.\n\nBy the end of this story, kids will be able to:\n- Know what juice is and how it can make us feel.\n- Know what can happen if we drink too much juice.\n- Know why it's important to drink juice carefully and what can happen if we don't.\n- Understand how juice and feeling sad or scared can be related.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 876, "idx": 240314, "original text": "Tomorrow night my dad and I will be doing another drunken podcast.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About How Food Changes Things\n\nIntroduction:\nIn this lesson, we will learn about how the food a mommy cow eats can change the way her baby grows. We will talk about these parts:\n\n1. Background Information\n2. Big Ideas\n3. Real Examples\n4. Real-World Stories\n5. Glossary\n\nBackground Information:\nHow good meat is can be changed by a lot of things, like where the cow lives, what it eats, and who its parents were. In this lesson, we are looking at how the food a mommy cow eats can change the way her baby grows.\n\nBig Ideas:\nProtein is an important part of food. It helps animals grow and can change how their meat tastes and feels. Protein is made from tiny things called amino acids. These amino acids help to build muscles.\n\nReal Examples:\nTo understand how a mommy cow's food can change her baby, let's look at these examples:\n\n1. If a mommy cow eats lots of protein, her baby might be tougher to eat.\n2. But if a mommy cow doesn't eat much protein, her baby might be easier to eat.\n\nReal-World Stories:\nLet's think about a farmer who wants to make his cows' meat good to eat. He can use what we learned to change what he feeds his cows. If he gives his cows lots of protein, their babies might be harder to chew. But if he doesn't give his cows much protein, their babies might be easier to chew.\n\nWords to know:\n- Baby animal time: The time when an animal mom has a baby growing inside her.\n- Back leg muscle: A muscle found in the back leg of a cow.\n- Back muscle: A muscle found in the back of a cow.\n- Cutting force: How much force is needed to cut meat.\n- Stretchy stuff: A thing found in tissues that connect parts of the body.\n- Easy-to-chew: How easy meat is to chew.\n\nIn the end:\nThis talk shows us that what a cow mom eats when she has a baby growing inside her can change how good the meat from the baby cow is. By knowing how food changes the meat, farmers can choose what to feed their cows to get the best meat.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1137, "idx": 17692, "original text": "The influence of peri-conception and first trimester dietary restriction of protein in cattle on meat quality traits of entire male progeny.\nPrimiparous Santa Gertrudis heifers were used to evaluate the effects of gestational dietary protein content on meat quality traits of 20month old bull progeny (n=40).

{"text": "Lesson: Home Buying and Selling Tips\nIntroduction:\nBuying and selling houses is like a game where you get homes, take care of them, and then sell them to make some extra money. There are different ways you can play this game. In this lesson, we will learn about four ways: buying and keeping, fixing and selling, renting to buy, and finding and selling.\nBuying and Keeping:\nBuying and keeping is when you buy a house and keep it for a long time to make money from rent. This works best when lots of people want to rent houses. To do well, you need to find houses that can make a lot of rent money, don't need a lot of repairs, and are always rented out.\nFixing and Selling:\nFixing and selling is when you buy a house that needs repairs, fix it, and sell it to make money. This works best when lots of people want to buy fixed-up houses. To do well, you need to find houses that can be fixed up a lot and bought cheaply. You also need to know about building and decorating to make the house better.\nRenting to Buy:\nRenting to buy is when you rent a house to someone and give them the chance to buy it later at a set price. This works best when lots of people want to rent houses and house prices are going up. To do well, you need to find renters who are likely to buy the house later and have good money habits and a steady job.\nFinding and Selling:\nFinding and selling is when you find houses that need repairs and sell them to other people without owning them first. This works best when there are a lot of houses that need repairs and a lot of people who want to buy houses to fix up. To do well, you need to know a lot of people in the house buying and selling game, like agents, people who lend money, and other people who buy and sell houses.\nConclusion:\nBuying and selling houses can make a lot of money, but you need to have a good plan and work hard. By knowing the good and bad parts of each way, you can choose the best way for you. Whether you want to make money without working or build up money for a long time, there's a way to buy and sell houses for everyone.\nWords to Learn:\n- Rent money: The money made from a rented house after paying for things like the loan, taxes, and repairs.\n- Rate: How much money you can make from a house compared to its price, used to see how good a house is to buy.\n- After fix value: How much a house could be worth after it's fixed up.\n- Return: How much money you make from buying and selling a house compared to how much you spent.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 790, "idx": 607360, "original text": "- Invest additional monies and then rent. - Invest additional monies and then sell. - Hold and pay the carrying costs. - Sell right away.

These include:\n- Getting checked for being sick regularly\n- Knowing your family story of getting sick\n- Talking to your doctor about a special test\n- Changing the way you live, such as eating healthy, playing a lot, and not drinking a lot\n#### Part 4: The End\nGetting sick in this way is a big problem that affects many families.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning about Tiny Things\n\nTiny things are what make up all living things. In this lesson, we will learn about what tiny things are made of and how they work. We will also learn about the differences between tiny things found in plants and animals.\n\n**Part 1: What is a Tiny Thing?**\nA tiny thing is the smallest part of a living thing that can do all the things necessary for life, such as growing, making more of itself, and changing food into energy. Tiny things are made up of several parts, including a cover, goop, a control center, and tiny helpers.\n\n**Part 2: Kinds of Tiny Things**\nThere are two main kinds of tiny things: plant tiny things and animal tiny things. Plant tiny things have a hard cover, green bits, and a big water bag, while animal tiny things do not. The hard cover helps the plant tiny thing stay strong and safe, while the green bits allow plants to make their own food using sunlight. The big water bag stores water and other stuff for the plant.\n\n**Part 3: The Cover**\nThe cover is a thin layer that wraps the tiny thing and keeps it separate from its surroundings. It is made up of a two-sided layer, which has a water-loving inside and a water-hating outside. This setup lets the cover act like a gate, only letting certain tiny bits pass through.\n\n**Part 4: The Goop**\nThe goop is the watery stuff inside the tiny thing that holds the tiny helpers. It is where most of the tiny thing's food-changing reactions happen.\n\n**Part 5: The Control Center**\nThe control center is a small, heavy, round part found in the goop of bigger tiny things. It holds the tiny thing's instruction set, which is made up of parts that control the tiny thing's actions.\n\n**Part 6: The Tiny Helpers**\nTiny helpers are special structures within the tiny thing that do specific jobs. Some examples include power makers, which create energy for the tiny thing, and protein builders, which help in the making of body-building parts.\n\n**Word List:**\n- Tiny Thing: the smallest part of a living thing that can do all the things necessary for life\n- Plant Tiny Thing: a type of tiny thing that has a hard cover, green bits, and a big water bag\n- Animal Tiny Thing: a type of tiny thing that does not have a hard cover, green bits, or a big water bag\n- Cover: a thin layer that wraps the tiny thing and keeps it separate from its surroundings\n- Two-sided Layer: a layer of two-sided bits that forms the cover\n- Goop: the watery stuff inside the tiny thing that holds the tiny helpers\n- Control Center: a small, heavy, round part found in the goop of bigger tiny things that holds the tiny thing's instruction set\n- Tiny Helper: a special structure within the tiny thing that does a specific job\n\n**Summary:**\nIn this story, we learned about tiny building blocks of life and how they are different in plants and animals. We also learned about the outer covering, the inside part, and the important parts of these tiny building blocks.

{"text": "Story: Learning about Talking Tools\n\n**Simple Idea:**\nIn this story, we will learn about a talking tool that helps one friend talk to another friend. We will learn what it does, how it came to be, and how it works.\n\n**What the Talking Tool Does**\nThe talking tool is made to start talks between friends. It is very useful when friends want to connect and talk, like when playing games together or chatting on the web.\n\n**How the Talking Tool Came to Be**\nBefore the talking tool was made, people mostly used computers to share things and send letters. But when more people started using the internet, they wanted more ways to talk through their computers. One of these ways is a one-on-one talk for when friends play a game through a talk line, like a public line.\n\n**How the Talking Tool Works**\nThe talking tool is made to help one friend talk to another friend. To be specific, the tool is made to help friends who are signed up meet other friends who are also signed up. A big computer gives services to help signed up friends meet other signed up friends. The big computer is connected to a public line, and a friend who wants to talk to other friends goes to the big computer through the public line and signs up to be a member. The big computer then helps the members meet each other.\n\n**End of Story**\nTo sum up, the talking tool is a great tool to help one friend talk to another friend. By giving a place for signed up friends to connect, the tool lets friends have a good talk and play together. As we keep learning about computers, tools like this will be more and more important for making our time on the web better.\n\n**Word List:**\n- Talking tool: A tool made to start talks between friends.\n- Friends: People who use computers or things to go on the internet.\n- Public line: A talk line that everyone can use.\n- Signed up friends: Friends who have made an account on the big computer and can use special things.\n- Talking: A kind of talk where both friends join in and share things.\n- One-on-one talk: A talk where two friends talk directly to each other.\n- Big computer: A computer system that keeps, works on, and gives data to other computers on a network.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 2289, "idx": 316840, "original text": "(1) Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to a communication startup processing system, and more particularly to a communication startup processing system for beginning communications between user terminals.\n(2) Description of the Related Art\nAs computer networks, particularly, the Internet, find widespread usage, there have been demands for more complex and diverse modes of use for communications through computers at user terminals. One of those modes is a one-to-one mutual communication process for use in communication games in which users play a game through a communication circuit such as a public circuit.\nThere have heretofore been servers which provide services to introduce registered users to other registered users. Specifically, such a server is connected to a public circuit, and a user who desires mutual communications with other users accesses the server through the public circuit and is registered as a registered member. The server introduces registered members to those registered users who want mutual communications. To initiate a one-to-one mutual communication process between registered members, a registered user uses the computer at its own terminal to access the server and acquires information such as the telephone number of a registered member. Then, the user dials the acquired telephone number through the public circuit. When a connection to the registered member is established, they connect their computers to each other through the public circuit, and start mutual communications.\nAccording to the above communication startup process, however, since the registered user connects to the other registered member directly through the public circuit, the registered user who is the calling party is required to bear all the expenses of the established connection through the public circuit. The fact that the calling party needs to bear all the expenses of the established connection though the connection has been made for the mutual communications between the registered members poses problems in that the expenses which the calling party has to pay become so large that the calling party suffers a large cost bearing imbalance especially if the involved registered members is spaced from each other by a large geographical distance.", "hash": "4b636ddd5f8fe8e5813701219f7647710d0fafb1762ecfe7d956ddaa69dbcd98"}

{"text": "Lesson: Getting Things and Checking Them\n\nIntroduction:\nThe process of getting things is important for any group's work. It involves getting stuff or help from outside sources to meet the group's needs. In this lesson, we will learn about the process of getting things and checking them.\n\nSection 1: The Getting Things Process\n\nThe process of getting things has several steps that make sure the group gets the best for its money. These steps include:\n\n1. Figuring out needs: This step involves figuring out the group's needs and deciding what stuff or help is needed.\n2. Looking around: This step involves looking around to find out who might be able to supply the needed stuff or help.\n3. Asking for ideas (AFI): This step involves asking potential suppliers for their ideas, telling them what the group needs and how the ideas will be checked.\n4. Checking ideas: This step involves checking the ideas received based on how they will be checked as stated in the AFI.\n5. Making a deal: This step involves talking about the terms of the deal with the chosen supplier.\n6. Giving the deal: This step involves giving the deal to the chosen supplier.\n7. Looking after the deal: This step involves looking after the deal to make sure that the supplier gives the stuff or help as agreed.\n\nSection 2: Checking\n\nChecking involves looking at records and processes to make sure they follow set standards. In the context of getting things, checking involves looking at the getting things process to make sure that it is working well, and follows set rules and regulations.\n\nTypes of checks:\n1. Rules check: This type of check looks at whether the getting things process follows set rules and regulations.\n2. Work check: This type of check looks at how well the getting things process is working.\n3. Money check: This type of check looks at the money records of the getting things process to make sure they are correct and follow set standards.\n\nSection 3: Practical Examples\n\nLet's think about a pretend example of a company that wants to get a new computer system. The company follows the process of getting things as outlined above.\n\n1. Figuring out needs: The company figures out its need for a new computer system to make its data work better.\n2. Looking around: The company looks around and finds several potential suppliers that offer computer systems.\n3. Asking for ideas: The company asks the potential suppliers for their ideas, telling them its needs and how the ideas will be checked.\n4. Checking ideas: The company checks the ideas received based on the checking criteria.\n5. Making a deal: The company talks about the terms of the deal with the chosen supplier.\n6. Giving the deal: The company gives the deal to the chosen supplier.\n7. Looking after the deal: The company looks after the deal to make sure that the supplier gives the computer system as agreed.\n\nConclusion:\n\nTo sum it up, buying things is very important for any group. It makes sure that the group gets good things with their money. Checking is a necessary part of buying things, as it helps to make sure that the process is good and follows the rules. By doing this and checking regularly, groups can avoid problems and get the most out of buying things.\n\nWords to know:\n- Buying things: The act of getting things or services from others to meet the needs of a group.\n- Asking for ideas: Request for ideas.\n- Talking about a deal: The act of talking about the details of a deal with a seller.\n- Taking care of a deal: The act of making sure a deal works well and that the seller gives the things or services as agreed.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 8, "len": 1006, "idx": 178301, "original text": "The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) has acknowledged an audit of the procurement of the MMV Ostrea, which sank in Londonderry before Christmas, identified \u201csignificant weaknesses and control issues in the management of [the] project.\u201d.

{"text": "Lesson Title: Bugs and Their Environment\n\nIntroduction:\nBugs are a kind of animals that have hard outer bodies, bodies with parts, and legs with joints. They are an important part of our world and help to keep nature balanced. In this lesson, we will learn about how bugs interact with their surroundings, especially with the help of chemicals.\n\nSection 1: Interactions with Others\n\nTopic 1: Special Smells\nSpecial smells are chemicals that are let out by bugs to talk to other bugs of the same kind. These chemicals can change the way other bugs act, like bringing them to food or warning them of danger.\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of special smells in bug communication?\nAnswer: Special smells are used by bugs to talk to each other and work together.\n\nTopic 2: Plant-Bug Interactions\nBugs often eat plants, and some plants have made chemical defenses to protect themselves from being eaten. These chemicals can hurt bugs.\n\nQuestion: How do these chemicals help plants defend themselves against bugs?\nAnswer: These chemicals can hurt bugs, making them less likely to eat the plant. They can also make the plant taste bad or make the bug feel sick after eating it.\n\nSection 2: Interactions Within\n\nTopic 1: Growing Chemistry\nSome bugs make chemicals that affect their own growth. For example, certain bugs make special things that control their growth and development.\n\nQuestion: How do these special things affect the growth of bugs?\nAnswer: These special things are chemicals that send messages within the body, telling cells what to do. They can control growth, change, and other parts of growth.\n\nTopic 2: Poison\nSome bugs make poisonous chemicals that can hurt other bugs or even people. For example, the sting of a bee has a mix of proteins and other chemicals that can cause pain and swelling.\n\nQuestion: Why do some bugs make yucky stuff?\nAnswer: Bugs make yucky stuff to keep safe or to help them catch food. For example, some spiders make a yucky juice that can freeze their food, making it easier to eat them.\n\nTopic 1: P Juice\nP Juice is a yucky stuff made by certain bugs that can make animals sick. It is an example of a natural stuff that is very special and can be used for many things.\n\nQuestion: What is P Juice, and why is it special to scientists?\nAnswer: P Juice is a yucky stuff made by certain bugs that can make animals sick. It is special to scientists because it can be used for many things, and its make-up is complex and unusual.\n\nEnd of Lesson:\nIn this lesson, we learned about how bugs and their homes use yucky stuff. We talked about smells, how bugs and plants get along, and how bugs grow. We also learned about the making of special stuff like P Juice. By understanding these things, we can better understand the big world around us and find new ways to keep safe and take care of our world.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1070, "idx": 152182, "original text": "Insects and other arthropods constitute well over half of the living animal species on earth; they are important not only from a biological viewpoint, but also as disease vectors, as well as agricultural, forest, and household pests. Insects interact chemically with one another, with plants, and with predator enemies. The substances responsible for these interactions (i.e. pheromones, when the interaction is intraspecific) can influence both behavior and, in some instances, development. They vary from the simplest of organic compounds to compounds of considerable complexity and novelty, such as the highly toxic, tumor-inducing beetle product, pederin. The aim of this project is to chemically characterize biologically active arthropod secretions mediating these interactions. Synthetic and biosynthetic studies will also be undertaken. The basic interest of the work will be to elucidate the natural chemical mechanisms operative in this area of chemical ecology. The research may also lead to new biochemically-based techniques for chemical control of insects.", "hash": "d5886545cd84fb30f46100e2a0622ec8153d8c9f8993b2a1dab67d907100efe9"}
{"text": "Lesson: How to Look at and Enjoy Stories on Screen\n\n### Start\nStories on screen, or movies, are a kind of fun that show tales through pictures, sounds, and words. They can teach us, inspire us, or just be fun. In this lesson, we will learn how to look at and enjoy stories on screen by seeing their parts, knowing their effect, and using smart thinking skills.\n\n### Part 1: Knowing the Parts of a Story on Screen\nA story on screen is made with many parts that come together to tell a complete tale. These parts include:\n\n1. People - The ones who act as the characters in the story.\n2. Words - The words that the people say and the things they do.\n3. Camera - The way the story is shown, with lights, camera ways, and movement.\n4. Sound - The music, noises, and words that are added to the story.\n5. Putting together - The way of joining the pieces of the story together to tell a complete tale.\n\n### Part 2: Looking at the Effect of a Story on Screen\nStories on screen can change our lives, even if we don't know it. They can inspire us, make us think in new ways, or even change how we act. To look at the effect of a story on screen, we need to think about:\n\n1. Message - The hidden idea or lesson of the tale.\n2. Feel - The overall mood or feeling of the story.\n3. Characters - The people who move the tale forward and how they change over time.\n4. Events - The things that happen in the story and how they connect to each other.\n5. Pictures - The images and places that are used to create the world of the story.\n\n### Part 3: Using Smart Thinking Skills\nSmart thinking is the way of looking at information and ideas to reach a logical end. When watching a story on screen, we can use smart thinking skills by:\n\n1. Finding the main idea - What is the big message of the story?\n2. Looking at proof - Are the events and actions in the story believable?\n3. Looking at how characters change - How do the people change throughout the story?\n4. Looking at the effect - What effect does the story have on the watcher?\n5. Thinking about other views - Can we understand the story in different ways based on our own experiences and thoughts?\n\n### End\nBy knowing the parts of a story on screen, looking at its effect, and using smart thinking skills, we can enjoy stories on screen more deeply. We can like them for their fun, but also learn from their messages and lessons.

Its application to eliminate weeds may have the undesired effect of diminishing the metallic cations found in the soil (e.g., Ni(2+) and Zn(2+)), due to a complexation reaction that depends on the soil's pH. To better understand the molecular structures of glyphosate that are involved in such a complexation reaction, we have studied all possible glyphosate conformations in aqueous solution that may be involved in deprotonation reactions in the pH range from 2 to 11 using the polarizable continuum method (PCM). We have also compared direct (or absolute) methods to calculate pKa values, the cluster-continuum model and the proton-exchange scheme, using different thermodynamic cycles. The best result was achieved when using a proton-exchange scheme, which was able to properly reproduce three glyphosate experimental pKa values predicted for the glyphosate structures and conformations previously determined.", "hash": "82a857d84129557d3d2319a64b3eeae80c506baed25dec95b4651efa2d9ea64c"}
{"text": "Story: How to Look at Things and Understand What They Do\n\nBeginning:\nWhen we want to get something, like a toy or a book, we need to know what it does. We can do this by looking at what the thing is and what it can do. In this story, we will learn how to look at things and understand what they do.\n\nPart 1: Knowing the Basics\n\nThing 1: Looking at the Thing's Name and Type\n- The thing's name is what people call it.\n- The type is what kind of thing it is, like a toy, clothes, or something for the house.\n\nThing 2: Finding Out What the Thing Does and Why It's Good\n- What a thing does is what it can do, like play music, be soft, or store things.\n- Why it's good is what makes the thing helpful, like it works well, is easy to use, or saves money.\n\nThing 3: Looking at What the Thing Does\n- Looking at what the thing does helps us know what it can do and why it's good.\n- It can also tell us about where the thing came from, how it was made, or if it has a guarantee.\n\nPart 2: Knowing the Special Words\n\nThing 1: Looking at Special Words\n- Special words are words that tell us more about what the thing does or how it works.\n- Some words might be \"HD\" for very clear, \"GHz\" for how fast something is, or \"MPG\" for how far a car can go.\n\nThing 2: Looking at Special Facts\n- Special facts are things that tell us more about what the thing does or how well it works.\n- Some facts might be how clear a screen is, how fast a computer is, or how long a battery lasts.\n\nPart 3: Looking at Different Things\n\nThing 1: Looking at What Different Things Do and Why They're Good\n- To look at different things, we find what's the same and what's different about what they do and why they're good.\n- We can use a chart or table to help us see this easier.\n\nThing 2: Looking at What People Say About the Things\n- What people say about the things helps us know if the things work well and if people like them.\n- Look for things that a lot of people say to know what's good and not so good about the things.\n\nThe End:\nUnderstanding what things do is very important when we want to get something. By learning how to look at what a thing does and why it's good, we can choose the best things and not be upset or confused. Remember to use charts and look at what people say about the things to know if they work well and if people like them.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 818, "idx": 620244, "original text": "Zealot B19 LED Headset ( Extra Bass ). />. />. \u20b5250.

You can see path puzzles in drawings, patterns, and even buildings.\n\n**Part 2: The Story of Path Puzzles**\nPath puzzles have been seen in many places and times. They were often seen as important signs, showing the way to learning or growing. In old stories, a path puzzle was made by David to trap a scary monster. In the Christian faith, path puzzles were a way of showing a journey to a special place. Today, people still use path puzzles to help them think and feel calm.\n\n**Part 3: How We Use Path Puzzles**\nPath puzzles are used in different ways, like in building design, helping people feel better, and making machines work better. In building design, path puzzles make places look interesting. In helping people feel better, path puzzles help people relax and worry less. In making machines work better, path puzzles help parts move smoothly.\n\n**Part 4: Examples of Path Puzzles**\nLet's think about some examples of path puzzles. The CH building in FR country has a well-known path puzzle on its floor, which helped people think and pray. In making machines work better, path puzzles are used in machines to stop leaks and make them work better. In helping people feel better, path puzzles are used to help people who are feeling worried or sad.\n\n**Words to Know**\n- **Path Puzzle:** A way to get from one place to another.\n- **Maze:** A path that is hard to follow with dead ends.\n- **Journey:** A trip to a special place for important reasons.\n- **Learning:** The process of finding out about something or gaining knowledge.\n\n**Ending**\nPath puzzles have been used for a very long time in different places and by different people. They are used in building design, helping people feel better, and making machines work better. By learning about path puzzles, we can see how interesting and special they are. This lesson has taught us about the history, uses, and examples of path puzzles. We can use what we learned in other things we do, like solving problems and thinking hard.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 689, "idx": 322254, "original text": "Project /. Labyrinth.

{"text": "Lesson Title: Looking At Bunny Knees\n\nIntroduction:\nIn this lesson, we will learn about looking at bunny knees and how they can get hurt when their legs get longer. We will talk about these things:\n\n1. What happens to the knee when a bunny's leg gets longer\n2. Looking at bunny knees\n3. Knee troubles and bone samples\n4. Brightness of a special light\n\nSection 1: What Happens to the Knee When a Bunny's Leg Gets Longer\n\nWe looked at what happens when a bunny's leg gets longer in 18 bunnies. The bunnies' legs were made longer a little bit every day.\n\nSection 2: Looking at Bunny Knees\n\nWe made the bunnies' legs longer in different ways and then looked at their knees. The 18 bunnies were divided into 3 groups based on how much their legs grew. We looked at their knees and bones under a special light.\n\nSection 3: Knee Troubles and Bone Samples\n\nThe knees of some bunnies started to have troubles when their legs were made longer. The special light was brighter on one side than the other, showing that the bunnies' knees were getting hurt more on one side.\n\nSection 4: Brightness of a Special Light\n\nOur look at the bunnies shows that \n\nConclusion:\n\nIn the end, looking at bunny knees shows us that making a bunny's leg longer can cause knee troubles. The special light is brighter on one side, showing a higher chance of knee troubles. This can help people who are thinking about making their legs longer to make a good choice.\n\nWords to Remember:\n\n- Making legs longer: a way to make bones longer\n- Looking at things: how we study parts of the body\n- Bones: the hard parts inside our bodies\n- Special light: a light that comes from something when it gets excited\n\nLet's Talk About It:\n\nIs it worth it to make a leg longer if it can cause knee troubles and hurt the bones?

{"text": "Lesson: 12 Helpful Tips From My Grandma\n\nStart:\nThis lesson will teach you twelve helpful tips from my grandma. These tips are easy but strong, and they can help you have a happy and good life.\n\nPart 1: Life CAN be easy\n\nThe first tip my grandma gave me was that life can be easy. She taught me that we often make things harder than they need to be. By making our lives easier, we can find more happiness and calm.\n\nQuestions:\n- How can you make your life easier?\n- What are some ways to have less stress and mess in your life?\n\nWhat it means:\nMaking your life easier means doing fewer things and having fewer things. By doing this, you can focus on what is really important and enjoy life more.\n\nA Story:\nOne way to make your life easier is to clean your house. Start by getting rid of things you don't need or use anymore. Give away or sell things that are still good. By having fewer things, you can make your house more calm and peaceful. \n\nA Real Story:\nImagine you have lots of things to do like work, family, and playing with friends. You feel worried and have too much to do. By making your life easy, you can pick your tasks and focus on what is most important. This can help you feel less worried and find more happiness in your daily activities.\n\nStory 2: Don\u2019t change for others\n\nThe second advice my grandma, Grace, gave me was not to change for others. She taught me that I should always be myself and not try to be like someone else.\n\nQuestions:\n- Why is it important not to change for others?\n- How can you be yourself while still being nice to others?\n\nWhat Does it Mean:\nBeing yourself means being honest with yourself about who you are and what you want. It also means not changing your thoughts, what you think is important, or how you act to be like others.\n\nExample:\nIf someone asks you to do something that you think is wrong, you don't have to do it. You can nicely explain why you cannot do it and suggest a different thing that works for both.\n\nStory Time:\nImagine you are in a group where everyone dresses in a certain way, but you don't like it. Instead of trying to be like them, you can choose to wear clothes that make you feel good and confident. By being yourself, you can avoid the worry of trying to be like someone else.\n\nStory 3: You\u2019re not who you were \u2013 and that\u2019s okay\n\nThe third advice my grandma, Grace, gave me was that I am not who I was, and that's okay. She taught me that we all change as we grow up and that it's important to be happy with who we are now.\n\nQuestions:\n- Why is it important to be happy with who you are now?\n- How can you be happy with change and move forward?\n\nWhat Does it Mean:\nBeing happy with who you are now means knowing that you have grown up and changed over time. It also means forgetting about past mistakes and focusing on now.\n\nExample:\nIf you have made mistakes in the past, you can learn from them and move on. Instead of feeling bad about what happened, you can focus on making better choices in the future.\n\nStory Time:\nImagine you are a parent whose child is growing up and becoming more independent. You may feel sad that your child is no longer a baby, but you can be happy with the changes and enjoy watching them grow up. By being happy with who they are now, you can have a better relationship with your child.\n\nThe End:\nBy listening to the twelve advices my grandma, Grace, gave me, you can lead a simpler, more real life.

{"text": "Lesson Title: Learning about Helping Machines\n\n## Part 1: What are Helping Machines?\nHelping machines are tools that make jobs easier. They can do things like sending messages, sharing pictures, finding new friends, and remembering things about people we know. The goal of helping machines is to make work faster and better, while also saving money and making more money.\n\n## Part 2: Why Use Helping Machines?\nThere are many reasons why businesses might use helping machines. First, it can save time and effort by doing jobs that would normally take a long time. This can free up time for other important jobs, like coming up with new ideas or making customers happy. Second, helping machines can help businesses talk to the right people. This can lead to more people liking what they offer and making more money. Finally, helping machines can give businesses important information about what people like and don't like, which can be used to make things better.\n\n## Part 3: How Do Helping Machines Work?\nHelping machines work by bringing together different tools and platforms into one system. This lets businesses manage all their jobs in one place, instead of using many different systems. For example, a business might use a helping machine to manage its messages, share pictures, and remember things about the people it knows. The machine would then automatically send out messages based on certain events, like when a person buys something or signs up for a newsletter. It would also remember what people like and don't like across all channels, allowing the business to tailor its efforts accordingly.\n\n## Part 4: Finding New Friends and Understanding Data\nFinding new friends is the process of tracking and managing new friends made by sharing pictures and messages. This can involve jobs such as finding new friends, knowing them better, and introducing them to sales friends. Helping machines can make these jobs easier by doing many of these tasks. Understanding data, on the other hand, involves collecting and looking at information related to sharing pictures and messages. This can include things like how many people clicked on a link, how many people liked what they saw, and how much money was made. By looking at this information, businesses can find ways to make things better and make decisions about their efforts.\n\n## Part 5: The End\nHelping machines are powerful tools that can make work faster and better, and ultimately make more money. By using helping machines, businesses can make jobs easier, talk to the right people more effectively, and learn important things about what people like and don't like. Whether you're just starting out with helping machines or looking to do more, there's no better time than now to get started.\n\nWords to Remember:\n- Helping Machines: Tools that make jobs easier.\n- Finding New Friends: The process of tracking and managing new friends made by sharing pictures and messages.\nAnalytics: Learning about things from looking closely at them.\n\n## Words to Know:\n- Making Things Easier: Using tools and new ways to make work easier and faster.\n- Managing Friends: Keeping track of new friends made by sharing and playing together.\n- Analytics: Learning about things from looking closely at them.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 547, "idx": 333386, "original text": "The Nuvias PEP makes it easy for you to reach more customers by giving you access to duel branded and fully integrated campaigns that are ready to be launched at the click of a button..

{"text": "Lesson: Taking Care of Clothes\n\nSaying Hello:\nTaking care of clothes is important. It means making clothes in a way that is good for the world and for people. In this lesson, we will learn why it's good to take care of clothes, what's hard about it, and how to make good choices when buying clothes.\n\nPart 1: Why Taking Care of Clothes Matters\n\nThing 1: Good for the World\nMaking clothes can hurt the world. It can make the air and water dirty and use up a lot of things we need, like water. Taking care of clothes tries to fix these problems by using things that are good for the world, not making a lot of trash, and not hurting the air.\n\nThing 2: Good for People\nSome people who make clothes are not treated very well, especially in far away countries. Brands that take care of clothes make sure these people are treated fairly. They make sure people get enough money, work in safe places, and can talk about what they need.\n\nThing 3: Better Clothes\nBrands that take care of clothes make very good clothes that last a long time. They make clothes that we can wear again and again, so we don't need to buy new clothes all the time.\n\nPart 2: Hard Parts about Taking Care of Clothes\n\nThing 1: Cost\nTaking care of clothes can cost more money than not caring about clothes. This is because it costs more money to use good things and treat people fairly. But, the clothes last longer, so you don't need to buy new clothes as much.\n\nThing 2: Getting Clothes\nNot everyone can get clothes that are taken care of. Some brands may cost more money than other brands, and some people may not be able to get these clothes. But, there are many clothes that are taken care of that don't cost a lot of money.\n\nThing 3: Learning\nSome people may not know why it's good to take care of clothes or how to choose good clothes. Learning is very important to help people know more and make good choices.\n\nPart 3: How to Buy Good Clothes\n\nThing 1: Know Your Brands\nBefore buying any clothes, learn about the brand. Make sure they care about taking care of clothes. Look for signs like Fair Play, Good Stuff, or Clean Air.\n\nThing 2: Better Clothes\nBuy good, lasting clothes that you can wear again and again. Don't buy clothes that will break quickly.\n\nThing 3: Used Clothes\nThink about shopping at old clothes stores or online to find clothes that were used a little. This makes less trash and helps everyone.\n\nSaying Goodbye:\nTaking care of clothes is very important for our world and everyone in it. When we buy things, we can help brands that care about our planet and lessen how much we harm the Earth. It's good to learn about brands, buy things that will last, and think about buying used things. With these ideas, we can help make a better future.\n\nWords to Know:\n- Caring Clothes: Clothes made in a way that is good for people and the planet.\n- Quick Clothes: Clothes that are cheap and stylish, but are made very fast, sometimes hurting people and the Earth.\n- Fair Pay: A way to make sure people who work get paid properly and are safe at work.\n- Natural: Things made from what we find in nature, without using bad chemicals.\n- Earth-Friendly: A company that helps the Earth by doing good things to make up for the harm they cause.\n\n[1] \"Why Caring Clothes are Important.\" People Tree, www.peopletree.co.uk/why-caring-clothes-are-important.\n[2] \"Caring Clothes: A Simple Guide.\" Good On You, www.goodonyou.eco/caring-clothes-guide.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 593, "idx": 334778, "original text": "People Tree.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning to Count People and Why it's Good\n\nStart:\nCounting people is when you keep track of how many people go in and out of a place. We've been doing this in places like stores and malls for a long time. It helps us learn what people like. In this lesson, we'll learn why counting people is good and when we can use it.\n\nPart 1: What is Counting People?\nWhat Does Counting People Mean?\nCounting people is when you keep track of how many people go in and out of a place. We've been doing this in places like stores and malls for a long time. It helps us learn what people like.\n\nHow Does Counting People Work?\nWe have a few ways to count people. We can use videos, lights, or mats that feel when someone steps on them. With videos, we use cameras to take pictures of people as they go in and out. Then, we use a special computer program to see and count the people in the pictures. Lights work by shining a light that gets blocked when someone walks through it. This makes a counter go up. Mats work by feeling how heavy something is. When someone steps on the mat, it gets heavier and the counter goes up.\n\nPart 2: Why is Counting People Good?\nWhy Does Counting People Make Things Better?\nIf a store knows how many people are there, they can make things better for them. For example, they can have enough helpers so no one has to wait too long.\n\nHow Does Counting People Keep Us Safe?\nCounting people can also keep us safe. By seeing how many people go in and out of a place, guards can see if something strange is happening and do something about it.\n\nHow Does Counting People Help Businesses?\nCounting people can help businesses by showing them what people like. For example, stores can see which things people buy a lot of and which things they don't, and change what they have in the store.\n\nPart 3: When Can We Use Counting People?\nWhere Can We Use Counting People in Stores?\nIn stores, counting people can help see how people move and how good ads are. By knowing how people move, stores can decide where to put things and how to set up displays.\n\nWhere Can We Use Counting People in Malls?\nMalls and outlets can use counting people the same way stores do. They can put it at the doors and places where a lot of people go. By seeing how many people go to different places, they can learn what people like and make shopping better.\n\nTopic 3: Town Places, Shops, Town Things & Public Playgrounds\nCounting people can also be used in town places, shops, town things, and public playgrounds to watch use and make sure that these areas are being used well. By watching steps, leaders can find areas that need to be better and use things accordingly.\n\nPart 4: Ending\nCounting people is a strong thing that can give good thoughts about people's likes and dislikes. By knowing how many people are going in and out of a certain area, shops and leaders can make their work better and give a better time for their people.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 598, "idx": 366723, "original text": "\u201cCounting the number of visitors entering your premises is the most important tool available to Retailers.\u201d.

{"text": "Lesson: Asking Questions & Finding Out\n\nIntroduction:\nIn this lesson, we will learn about asking questions and finding out what people think. We will talk about different ways to ask questions and how to understand the answers. We will also talk about why it's important to know what people think.\n\nSection 1: Ways to Ask Questions\n\nWe can ask questions in many ways to find out what people think. These include:\n\n1. Phone Questions: We call people and ask them questions.\n\n2. Internet Questions: We ask questions on the internet and people answer online.\n\n3. Face-to-face Questions: We go to people's homes or other places to ask them questions.\n\n4. Letter Questions: We send letters to people's homes with questions for them to answer and send back.\n\nSection 2: How to Ask Questions\n\nAsking questions involves making up the questions, choosing who to ask, and understanding the answers. Here are some steps to asking questions:\n\n1. Make the Questions: The first step is to make up the questions. The questions should be easy to understand and about the thing we are interested in.\n\n2. Choose Who to Ask: The next step is to choose the people to ask. This means choosing a group of people who are like the whole group of people we are interested in.\n\n3. Ask the Questions: Once we have chosen the people, we can ask them the questions. This can be done by calling them, asking online, asking face-to-face, or sending letters.\n\n4. Understand the Answers: After asking the questions, we need to understand the answers. This involves counting how many people answered each question in a certain way.\n\nSection 3: Why Knowing What People Think is Important\n\nKnowing what people think helps us make choices. It helps us understand what people think and what they might do. Here are some ways it can be used:\n\n1. Knowing What People Think: Knowing what people think can help us understand how people feel about something. This can help us make choices or help people understand something.\n\n2. Guessing What People Will Do: Knowing what people think can help us guess what people might do. This can help us make plans or guess what might happen.\n\n3. Checking How Things Work: Knowing what people think can help us check if things are working well. This can help us decide if something should keep going or change.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn the end, asking questions and finding out what people think are important for understanding what people think and what they might do. By asking questions and finding out what people think, we can get useful information to help us make choices. We learn about different kinds of question games, how we play them, and how we look at the answers.

{"text": "Lesson: Understanding Plant Helpers and Different Plants\n\nIntroduction:\nPlant helpers can sometimes not work well, which can cause problems for farmers and their plants. Knowing why plant helpers might not work and how to use different types of plants can help farmers. In this lesson, we will learn about plant helpers and how to use different plants.\n\nSection 1: Understanding Plant Helpers\n\nTopic 1: What are Plant Helpers?\n- Plant helpers are things that farmers use to help get rid of weeds.\n- Sometimes, if a farmer uses the same plant helper too much, the weeds learn how to deal with it.\n- Over time, these tough weeds can grow and spread, making it hard for farmers to get rid of them.\n\nTopic 2: Why Might Plant Helpers Not Work?\n- Using the same plant helper too much\n- Weeds learning to deal with the plant helpers\n- Plant helpers getting where they're not supposed to go, which can make more weeds tough\n\nSection 2: Using Different Plants\n\nTopic 1: Changing Plants\n- Changing the plants that a farmer grows each year can help stop weeds from getting too tough.\n- This means growing different plants one after the other, each one needing a different plant helper.\n- Changing plants can help stop weeds from getting tough and means the farmer might not need to use as many plant helpers.\n\nTopic 2: Choosing Plant Helpers\n- Choosing different plant helpers can stop weeds from getting too tough.\n- Using more than one plant helper can stop weeds from learning how to deal with all of them.\n- This way of doing things needs careful thinking and watching to make sure the weeds are being dealt with, while not letting them get tough.\n\nTopic 3: Planting\n- How many seeds a farmer plants can change how well the plant helpers work.\n- Planting the right amount of seeds means that the plant helper is used in the right way, which helps it work better.\n- Using the right number of seeds also helps stop weeds from getting tough by making sure the plant helper works the right way.\n\nSection 3: Conclusion\nIn conclusion, understanding plant helpers and how to use different plants is important for farmers. By changing plants, choosing different plant helpers, and planting the right number of seeds, farmers can stop weeds from getting too tough and keep their plants healthy. Doing these things will help farmers grow lots of good crops.\n\nGlossary:\n- Plant helper: Something that farmers use to get rid of weeds.\n- How it works: The special way that a plant helper gets rid of weeds.\n- Toughness: When weeds learn to deal with plant helpers.\n\nIn summary, this lesson has taught us about plant helpers and how to use different plants. By knowing why some plants don't like certain things, and using different ways like changing crops, choosing carefully, and planting seeds, people who grow food can stop unwanted plants from not liking certain things. This way, they can keep their crops safe from unwanted plants.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 2792, "idx": 217508, "original text": "A plan of action\n\nIt\u2019s an old adage but it still holds true: if you fail to plan, you plan to fail. Mixing It Up is no different. The good news is that everyday farming practices \u2013 like rotation, selection and seeding \u2013 are effective ways you can take action against resistance.\n\nHere are ways you can incorporate diversity into your plan moving forward.\n\nHerbicide management\n\nRotate herbicides and Groups\n\nManaging herbicide resistance depends on rotating modes of action. Weeds that possess the inherent ability to survive an application of certain herbicides eventually multiply and spread, and can create potential problems down the road.\n\nField management\n\nThe importance of field records\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a record of what\u2019s been sprayed on which field over the past 5 years, it\u2019s time to start one. If you only have product names in your records, they need to be translated into herbicide Groups. For example, if you find that you have been spraying Group 1 herbicides for 4 out of the past 5 years on the same field, it may explain why your weed control program is losing its punch.\n\nCrop rotation\n\nRotating crops annually adds diversity to the field cropping system, and diversity increases the sustainability of the system. It provides the platform for long-term weed management. A well-planned crop rotation can:\n\nReduce the impact of weeds, insects and diseases, leading to higher yields\n\nLower input costs in some rotational crops\n\nUse more competitive crops to control weeds in some years\n\nHelp manage crop residue\n\nProvide diversified marketing options\n\nGive you the option to choose different herbicide Groups\n\nSeeding\n\nSeed competitive varieties and increase seeding rates to enhance a crop's ability to compete more effectively with weeds. Varying seeding dates and decreasing row spacings are other options. Even herbicide-resistant weeds are still susceptible to crop competition for space, moisture, sunlight and nutrients.\n\nA very effective way to prevent herbicide resistance is to seed your problem field last*. Delaying seeding allows the weeds to grow so you can eliminate them.\n\n*Source: 5 year UK study supports this seeding later\n\nTillage\n\nIf tillage is an option, for minimum till or no-till operations the consideration of selective tillage adds a tool to your toolbox. Focus on problematic weed patches.\n\nFertility\n\nCrops that get a head start on weeds through proper fertility are going to be more competitive. Plan a fertility program for the crop; feed the crop, not weeds.\n\nSample collection for HR testing\n\nIf, after going through these warning signs, you suspect that you have a resistant weed population, collect a sample of the plants and/or seeds for testing. See Resources for contact information for herbicide resistance testing sites.", "hash": "22c4ee04c620fa29773e86486d31ff5a6eb67d80e8ec35aa5e6cd4d3a17d02c9"}
{"text": " ## Topic: Making Art\n### Starting Off\nThe Making Art things are what you need to make any kind of art. They are the stuff that people who make art use to make their great work. In this lesson, we will learn about the seven Making Art things: Line, Shape, Color, Form, Texture, Space, and Value. We will also see how these things can be used to make different kinds of art.\n### Line\nA line is a mark you make on a thing, and it can be straight, curved, thick, or thin. Lines can be used to show different feelings and thoughts in a piece of art. For example, a thick, dark line can make you feel like something scary or hidden is happening, while a thin, light line can make you feel like something is gentle or weak.\n### Shape\nA shape is a closed flat thing, and it can be regular or natural. Regular shapes are the same all around, while natural shapes are different all around. Shapes can be used to make different roughness and patterns in a piece of art.\n### Color\nColor is how we see a thing because of light that makes our eyes and brain work. Colors can be used to show different feelings and thoughts in a piece of art. For example, bright colors can make you feel happy or joyful, while dark colors can make you feel sad or scared.\n### Form\nForm is a thing that has length, width, and depth. Forms can be used to make different roughness and patterns in a piece of art.\n### Texture\nTexture is how the surface of a thing feels. It can be smooth, rough, bumpy, or wrinkled. Texture can be used to show different feelings and thoughts in a piece of art. For example, a smooth texture can make you feel calm or peaceful, while a rough texture can make you feel excited or scared.\n### Space\nSpace is the area around and between things. It can be full or empty, meaning that it can have things in it or not. Space can be used to show different feelings and thoughts in a piece of art. For example, a full space can make you feel like everything is crazy or mixed up, while an empty space can make you feel peaceful or calm.\n### Value\nValue is how light or dark a color is. It can be used to show different feelings and thoughts in a piece of art. For example, a light value can make you feel calm or peaceful, while a dark value can make you feel dramatic or tense.\n### Wrapping Up\nLearning about the pieces of art is important for anyone who wants to like or make art. By looking at these pieces, we can learn how artists use them to share their thoughts and feelings. We can also use these pieces to make our own beautiful things. So go ahead and play with lines, shapes, colors, forms, textures, spaces, and values. Who knows? Maybe you will make the next big beautiful thing!", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 406, "idx": 113352, "original text": "As in cooking, Studio Art uses different ingredients to create each piece of artwork.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning to Think\n\n## Chapter 1: What is Thinking?\n\n### Section 1: Simple Concepts\n\nThinking is when we look at information and ideas. It is about asking questions, looking at clues, and making choices.\n\n### Section 2: Questions and Answers\n\n**Question:** Why is thinking important?\n**Answer:** Thinking is important because it helps us understand tricky things, make choices, and talk well.\n\n### Section 3: Why We Need to Think\n\nThinking is a key skill for doing well in school, work, and with friends. By learning to look at information and ideas, we can get better at solving problems, talking to others, and making choices.\n\n## Chapter 2: Real Life Examples\n\n### Section 1: About Cute Dogs\n\nThink about this: \"All dogs are cute.\" This seems easy and fun to say, but thinking lets us ask if it's true. We could ask: What makes a pet \"cute\"? Do dogs have all the things we think are cute? Are there dogs that aren't cute?\n\n### Section 2: Reading or Listening to News\n\nA usual example of thinking in daily life is when we listen to the news. When we read or listen to a news story, we need to think about if the source is good, if the news is right, and if the person telling the news might be biased. By using thinking skills, we can understand the world better and make choices based on the clues we have.\n\n## Chapter 3: More About Thinking\n\n### Section 1: Talking to Others\n\nThinking is not only important in school and work, but also when we talk to others. When we talk with others, we need to look at their ideas and respond in a good way. This means we need to listen well, ask good questions, and share our own ideas simply and clearly.\n\n### Section 2: Choosing a Leader\n\nThink about a debate between two people who want to be a leader. Each person gives their ideas for why they would be the best leader. By using thinking skills, we can look at the good and bad parts of each idea, think about what might happen because of each person's plans, and make a choice about who to vote for.\n\n## Word List\n\n- Thinking: Looking at information and ideas.\n- Questions: Things we ask that may or may not be true.\n- Clues: Things that help us know if something is true or not.\n- Choosing: Picking between different things.\n- Talking: Sharing information or ideas with others.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 936, "idx": 200144, "original text": "Q:\n\nInstallation of GMS2 and 3 on the same computer\n\nI would like to know the benefit of GMS 3 offline versus GMS 2.

{"text": "Story: Learning About Keeping Safe\n\n### Part 1: Simple Ideas\n\nKeeping safe is about knowing and understanding things that can hurt us. It's like playing a game where we have to find things that are not safe. We use our brain to see if something is not right. This can be done with the help of different tools like a safe box, doors, and simple alarms.\n\n### Part 2: Real-life Stories\n\nTo understand keeping safe better, let's pretend. Imagine a company has a new toy to keep a list of its customers. The company's tech team has set up a door and put an alarm to watch and see if anyone tries to get in without permission. After a few weeks, the team saw many tries to open the door from different places. The tech team looks into it and finds out that these tries were made with stolen keys.\n\nIn this pretend story, the tools to keep safe helped the tech team see someone trying to get in. By looking at the tries to open the door, they were able to see something strange and tell the tech team, who then did the right thing to stop it from happening again.\n\n### Part 3: Thinking Together\n\n1. What are some common tools to keep safe used today?\n2. How is keeping safe different from simple tools like doors and alarms?\n3. Can you explain how our brain helps in keeping safe?\n\n### Glossary\n- Keeping Safe: Knowing and understanding things that can hurt us.\n- Door Alarm: A simple tool that watches and sees if anyone tries to get in without permission.\n- Simple Alarms: A tool that tells when something is not right.\n- Our Brain: Helps us understand things from what we see.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn the end, keeping safe is very important for not letting bad things hurt us. By understanding the simple ideas, looking at real-life stories, and thinking together, we can learn a lot about this. With the growing importance of understanding how to keep safe, learning more about it can be very helpful for us.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 982, "idx": 221332, "original text": "CompTIA CySA+.

{"text": "Lesson: \nLet's Learn About Poems\n\nPoems are like special stories that use words and pictures to share feelings, thoughts, and things that happened. They often use fun ways of playing with words like making things sound the same, giving things human traits, and comparing things to other things. In this lesson, we're going to learn some simple things about poems.\n\nPart 1: What is a Poem?\nA poem is a type of story that shares ideas and feelings with words, beat, and pictures. It can be written in many different ways, including short poems, free poems, tiny poems, and funny poems. Poems often talk about things like love, losing something, nature, and people.\n\nPart 2: Parts of a Poem\nPoems have several important parts that work together to give meaning. These parts include:\n\n- Pictures: This means using words that help you see things in your mind or feel things.\n- Sound: Poems often use beat, words that sound the same, and words that start with the same sound to make it sound like music.\n- Shape: Poems can be shaped into different forms, like a short poem, which follow specific patterns of sound and beat.\n- Feeling: This is how the person who's speaking in the poem feels about what they're talking about.\n- Message: This is what the poem is really trying to say.\n\nPart 3: Ways to Write a Poem\nPeople who write poems use different ways to make their poems more interesting. Some common ways include:\n\n- Comparing things: This is when two different things are compared to make a new meaning. For example, \"Life is a trip.\"\n- Saying something is like something else: This is when two things are compared using \"like\" or \"as.\" For example, \"Her smile was as bright as the sun.\"\n- Making things act like people: This is when things that aren't people act like people. For example, \"The wind was screaming through the trees.\"\n- Using the same starting sound: This is when the same sound is used at the start of many words in a sentence. For example, \"She sells seashells by the seashore.\"\n- Using the same vowel sound: This is when the same vowel sound is used in a sentence. For example, \"The rain in SP city falls mainly on the plain.\"\n\nPart 4: Kinds of Poems\nThere are many different kinds of poems, each with its own special way of being written. Some common types of poems include:\n\n- Short poem: A 14-line poem that follows a specific sound pattern and often talks about love or beauty.\n- Tiny poem: A three-line poem that started in JA country and usually talks about nature and the seasons.\n- Funny poem: A five-line funny poem with a specific sound pattern and beat.\n- Free Verse: This is a type of poem that doesn't rhyme or have a beat, but sounds more like normal talking.\n\nEnd Note\nIn the end, poems are strong ways to use words and pictures to share feelings and ideas. By knowing more about poems, we can like and understand this art better. Whether you are reading or writing poems, it's important to remember that the best part about poems is how they can make you feel and think.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 817, "idx": 226858, "original text": "Hello there,.

{"text": "Story: Making Yummy Juice\nBeginning:\nMaking yummy juice is an old craft that people have done for a very long time. Juice is made from four main things: water, fruit, sweet stuff, and a tiny living thing that we can't see. In this story, we will learn how to make yummy juice, the story of juice, and the magic behind making juice.\nPart 1: How to Make Yummy Juice\nMaking yummy juice involves a few steps, including getting the fruit ready, crushing it, mixing it, draining it, heating it, adding the tiny living thing, and letting it sit.\nGetting Ready: This is when we put the fruit in water so it can grow a little bit. This wakes up the tiny things inside the fruit that turn the hard bits into sweet stuff.\nCrushing: After the fruit has grown a little bit, it is dried and crushed to make a rough flour called fruit flour.\nMixing: The fruit flour is mixed with hot water to make a mushy mix called the mash. This wakes up the tiny things in the flour, which turn the hard bits into sweet stuff.\nDraining: The mash is drained, and the sweet liquid is collected in a big pot.\nHeating: The sweet liquid is heated with sweet stuff, which makes the juice taste nice.\nAdding the Tiny Living Thing: A tiny living thing is added to the heated liquid, and it changes the sweet stuff into bubbly stuff.\nLetting it Sit: The juice is kept in big pots or barrels for a few weeks or months to let the taste get better.\nPart 2: The Story of Juice\nPeople have made juice for a very long time. The oldest known juice was made a very long time ago in a place that is now called IR country. Juice was a big part of old civilizations, and it was used for everything from food to medicine to trade. In old times in EU country, juice was safer to drink than water, and it was a big part of what people ate. Today, juice is one of the most liked drinks in the world.\nPart 3: The Magic of Making Juice\nMaking juice is both a craft and a magic. The magic of making juice involves life science, food science, and physical science. The taste of juice is changed by the type of fruit, the kind of sweet stuff, the tiny living thing, and the way we make the juice. The color, smell, and taste of juice are all changed by the magic things that happen when we make juice.\nThe End:\nIn the end, making juice is a fun and interesting thing to do. It involves both craft and magic, and it has a long story.

{"text": "Story: How to Write a Good Story for School\nBeginning:\nWriting a good story for school is a very important part of school. It lets you show who you are, what you like, and what you have done that may not be seen in your grades and tests. In this story, we will talk about the important parts of a good school story and give useful tips to help you be different from other students.\nPart 1: Why We Write the Story\nThe reason we write the school story is to show teachers who we are, not just our marks or how good we are at school tests. It's a chance to share special things about us, things we've done, and how we see things that make us a good friend for their school.\nPart 2: Picking a Story\nPicking a story for your writing can be hard, but it's important to choose a story that means a lot to you. Here are some ideas to help you pick a story:\n- Think about something that happened to you that changed how you think or feel.\n- Think about something you're really good at and how it's helped you be a better person.\n- Think about something you really love to do and how it's made your life better.\nOnce you've picked a story, make sure it's about one thing and really clear. Stay away from stories that are too common or don't tell us much about you.\nPart 3: Writing the Story\nThe story should be neat, fun to read, and not too long. Here are some ideas to help you write a good story:\n- Start with a fun beginning that makes the reader want to keep reading and sets up what the story is about.\n- Use exciting words and details to show what happened and how you felt.\n- Use words that tie your ideas together and make your story flow.\n- Finish with a strong ending that reminds the reader what your story is about and leaves a good feeling.\nPart 4: Checking and Fixing the Story\nAfter writing the story, it's important to check and fix it to make sure it's perfect and shiny. Here are some ideas to help you check and fix your story:\n- Read the story out loud to find any parts that sound funny or are hard to understand.\n- Look for any spelling or grammar mistakes.\n- Make sure the story is not too long and doesn't go over the limit.\n- Ask someone else to read your story and tell you what they think.\nThe End:\nTo finish, writing a good school story takes careful thinking, deep thought, and good writing. By following the ideas in this lesson, you can write a great story that shows off special things about you and helps you get into your dream school.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 1013, "idx": 274202, "original text": "Claire Dennard Mangrum.

{"text": "Lesson: Getting Ready for Big Happenings\n\nIntroduction:\nIn this lesson, we will learn how to get ready for big happenings. We will talk about the difference between accidents and happenings, why it's important to plan early, and the steps to make sure a happening is safe and fun.\n\nSection 1: Accidents vs. Happenings\n\n**Topic 1: What is Accident and Happening?**\n- An accident is something that happens without planning and needs to be fixed right away.\n- A happening is something fun or important that we plan and wait for.\n\n**Topic 2: Why We Need to Plan Early**\n- Planning early for a happening helps make sure everyone is safe and has fun.\n- It also lets us get ready for accidents that might happen during the happening.\n\nSection 2: Steps in Getting Ready for a Big Happening\n\n**Topic 1: Figuring Out What Could Go Wrong**\n- Think about what could go wrong during the happening, like too many people, cars in the way, or someone trying to spoil the fun.\n- Try to guess how likely each problem is and what could happen if it does.\n\n**Topic 2: Making the Plan**\n- Write down a plan that says who does what.\n- Make extra plans for things that might happen that we didn't plan for.\n\n**Topic 3: Putting the Plan into Action**\n- Make sure everything we need is ready before the happening.\n- Talk to everyone to make sure they know what they have to do.\n\n**Topic 4: Watching and Thinking About the Happening**\n- Keep an eye on the happening to make sure everything is going as planned.\n- Think about how well the plan worked after the happening and change anything that needs to be changed.\n\nSection 3: Examples from Real Life\n\n**Topic 1: Keeping People Safe**\n- During a music party, the people in charge need to make sure everyone can move around safely.\n- They can do things like letting people in at different times, marking out paths, and putting up walls to stop people from pushing through.\n\n**Topic 2: Keeping Cars Out of the Way**\n- During a big race, it's very important to keep cars out of the way so the racers can finish safely.\n- The people in charge can work with the city people to close roads, make new paths, and put up signs to stop traffic jams.\n\nConclusion:\nIn the end, getting ready for a big happening means figuring out what could go wrong, making a plan, putting the plan into action, and watching and thinking about the happening. By doing these steps, the people in charge can make sure everyone is safe and has fun. This is also something we can do for other things in life, like getting ready for a family party or a neighborhood happening.\n\nGlossary:\n- Accident: Something that happens without planning and needs to be fixed right away.\n- Happening: Something fun or important that we plan and wait for.\n- Figuring Out What Could Go Wrong: Thinking about what could go wrong and trying to guess how likely it is and what could happen if it does.\n- Extra Plan: A plan for things that might happen that we didn't plan for.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 334, "idx": 237872, "original text": "Special Events.

{"text": "Lesson: Medicine Giving and How Gemcitabine Works in Healing\n\nIntroduction:\nIn this story, we're going to talk about a special medicine called \"G\" that helps sick people feel better. It is used when people are very, very sick. It's a strong medicine that can help people with very bad sicknesses.\n\n\"G\" is a magic potion. When someone drinks it, it goes inside their body and fights the sickness. It's like a superhero fighting villains inside our bodies. Sometimes, the potion needs to be given more than once to make sure it can fight all the bad guys.\n\nHow much of the magic potion to give depends on the person and their sickness. It's like how some people need a big coat in winter, and others only need a small one. The amount of \"G\" potion given to a person can change. It's usually given in small amounts over a short time. \n\nHere are some examples of how \"G\" potion can be given:\n\n1. For people with a very bad lung sickness, the magic potion is given three times in one moon cycle.\n2. For people with a very bad tummy sickness, the magic potion is also given three times in one moon cycle.\n\nIn this story, we learned about how \"G\" potion helps sick people and how it is given. This is important knowledge for doctors and nurses who give the potion.

Lennes, Jr., Koll, Olson & Morrison, St. Paul, for Danielson Mobil, Inc.\nBud Jackson, pro se.\n*252 Hubert H. Humphrey, III, Atty. Gen., Peter C. Andrews, Sp. Asst. Atty. Gen., St. Paul, for Department of Jobs and Training.\nConsidered and decided by NIERENGARTEN, P.J., and WOZNIAK and SEDGWICK, JJ., with oral argument waived.\n\nOPINION\nSEDGWICK, Judge.\nRelator Danielson Mobil, Inc. appeals the Commissioner's representative's decision that respondent voluntarily terminated his employment with good cause attributable to his employer. We affirm.\n\nFACTS\nBudd Jackson began working with Danielson Mobil, Inc. (Mobil) in May of 1985. When hired, Mobil's manager told Jackson he would be working 48 hours over a six day workweek, and that he would receive $4.50 per hour plus time and one-half for hours worked in excess of 40 hours. Jackson said he would not have accepted the job without the eight hours overtime. During his employment with Mobil, Jackson consistently worked a 48 hour week.\nIn early January of 1986, Mobil informed Jackson that his eight overtime hours each week would be eliminated. To compensate for the loss of overtime, Jackson was offered 40 hours per week at an hourly rate of $4.75. Jackson terminated his employment effective January 11, 1986. His sole reason for termination was elimination of overtime hours; continuing work was available with relator.\nJackson was denied unemployment benefits because a department claims deputy found that respondent voluntarily quit without good cause attributable to his employer. The referee affirmed the claims deputy's determination. The Commissioner's representative reversed the appeal referee's decision on the basis that record evidence indicated Jackson was promised a 48 hour workweek and that he would not have accepted employment without the promised overtime. The Commissioner concluded Jackson voluntarily terminated his employment with good cause attributable to his employer.\n\nISSUE\nDoes the record support the Commissioner's decision that respondent voluntarily terminated his employment with good cause attributable to his employer?\n\nANALYSIS\nFindings in unemployment compensation cases must be reviewed in the light most favorable to the decision. If there is any evidence reasonably tending to sustain the findings, they will not be disturbed. Mastley v. Commissioner of Economic Security, 347 N.W.2d 515, 518 (Minn.Ct.App. 1984). Findings in the present case are supported by evidence contained in the record.\nThe Commissioner's representative adopted the appeal referee's findings of fact in addition to further findings he developed. The Commissioner is at liberty to consider additional findings if they are derived from previously submitted evidence. Minn.Stat. \u00a7 268.10, subd. 5 (1984), provides in part:\nUpon review, the commissioner or authorized representative may affirm, modify, or set aside any finding of fact or decision, or both, of the referee on the basis of evidence previously submitted in the case * * *.\nAdditional findings by the Commissioner's representative are noted in the decision on appeal as follows:\nFINDING OF FACT: (4) At the time the claimant was hired, he was informed that he would be working six days a week and that his workweek would be 48 hours long. The claimant received time and a half for hours over 40. The claimant would not have accepted the job but for the long hours and the overtime pay. Throughout his entire employment, the claimant worked a six day workweek, 48 hours per week.\n*253 The record adequately supports the Commissioner's additional findings.\nAlthough bound by the findings of the Commissioner, the determination of whether respondent was \"properly disqualified from receipt of unemployment benefits\" under Minn.Stat. \u00a7 268.09, subd. 1(1) (1984), \"is a question of law upon which the reviewing court is free to exercise its independent judgment.\" Smith v. Employers' Overload Co., 314 N.W.2d 220, 221 (Minn. 1981). Pursuant to Minn.Stat. \u00a7 268.09, subd. 1(1) (1984), an individual, who voluntarily and without good cause attributable to his employer, discontinues employment is disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits.\nSince Jackson was not fired and the record reflects that continuing work was available, the Commissioner properly concluded respondent quit work voluntarily.\nRespondent's entitlement to benefits is also contingent on whether or not he quit with good cause attributable to Mobil. Good cause to quit has been held to involve a substantial wage reduction; a reduction in benefits; or a breach of an employment agreement. Moore v. Allied Aviation Fueling Company, 385 N.W.2d 41, 46 (Minn. Ct.App.1986). The Commissioner determined a substantial wage reduction and breach of an employment contract occurred in the present case. Case law supports these conclusions.\nGood cause for separation has been found in situations dealing with a 25% wage decrease. Sunstar Foods, Inc. v. Uhlendorf, 310 N.W.2d 80, 84 (Minn.1981). In Sunstar, the court concludes \"good cause\" exists where wage reductions are between 20 and 25% and not under 15% by citing cases from various jurisdictions. Id. at 84.\nThe present case involves a wage reduction of about 19%. Although 19% is slightly less than the wage reduction in Sunstar, it does fall within the parameters set by the other jurisdictions cited in Sunstar. The court in Sunstar also stated that wage cuts of two to four percent did not amount to \"good cause\" for separation. Id. at 84. The Sunstar court distinguished substantial wage cuts from trifling wage cuts.\nTreating a 19% wage reduction as good cause for separation from employment also comports with the remedial nature of Minn. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 268.03 to 268.24. Unemployment statutes are to be liberally construed to effect the public policy that unemployment reserves be used for the benefits of persons unemployed through no fault of their own. Smith, 314 N.W.2d at 221. Disqualification provisions of Minn.Stat. \u00a7 268.09 are therefore narrowly construed. Jackson v. Ford Motor Co., 289 Minn. 388, 403, 184 N.W.2d 786, 796 (1971).\nApparently the Commissioner's representative chose to accept respondent's weekly wage reduction computation, as opposed to the computation done by Mobil. When conflicting evidence is presented, this court is \"not privileged to weigh the evidence and make a proper determination as to where the preponderance lies.\" Cary v. Custom Coach, Inc., 349 N.W.2d 331, 332 (Minn.Ct.App.1984) (quoting Nyberg v. R.N. Cardozo & Brother, Inc., 243 Minn. 361, 364, 67 N.W.2d 821, 823 (1954)). The Nyberg rule suggests this court must accept the Commissioner's reliance on respondent's wage reduction computation.\nEmployment contracts are governed by applicable contract rules, including requirements of offer and acceptance. Terms of employment are controlled by the parties' intentions. Smith, 314 N.W.2d at 223. The record contains evidence reflecting the offer and acceptance of overtime hours.\nThe Nyberg rule again suggests this court must accept the Commissioner's determination that a promise of overtime hours was present.\n\nDECISION\nThe record evidence supports the Commissioner's findings and conclusions. The Commissioner's decision is not based on an erroneous theory of law. We affirm.\n", "hash": "e4c112140723b3e8b60e4d2a112249fc63484e4b1e426fb5e0982bd12acfec86"}

The guide, who is somewhere else, watches and talks to the person who is learning.\n\n## Part 3: Why is Learning from a Guide helpful?\nLearning from a guide is helpful because it lets someone who knows more help someone who is learning. This can be good when there is only one person who knows a lot, or when there are not enough people who know a lot.\n\n## Part 4: What are the good things about Learning from a Guide?\nThe good things about learning from a guide include:\n- Getting help from the guide while learning\n- The guide can help more than one person at the same time\n- It can make learning safer and better\n- It can make learning faster and easier\n\n## Part 5: What are the hard things about Learning from a Guide?\nSome hard things about learning from a guide include:\n- Problems with the system that lets people talk and see each other\n- It can be hard to show what the person is doing\n- The guide can't touch or move things for the person who is learning\n\n## Part 6: How can Learning from a Guide get better?\nLearning from a guide can get better by:\n- Making sure the system that lets people talk and see each other works good before using it\n- Practicing with the guide and the person who is learning\n- Using better video and sound to talk and see each other\n- Making new things to help show what the person is learning better\n\n## Ending:\nLearning from a guide is a good way to get help while learning. By knowing how it works and how to make it better, we can keep making it a good way to learn.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1270, "idx": 327539, "original text": "Telementoring of laparoscopic procedures: initial clinical experience.\nTo assess the feasibility of telementoring, a clinical telepresence system was developed.

{"text": "Lesson: The Importance of Standing Up for What You Think is Right\n\nIntroduction:\n\nIn this lesson, we will learn about why it's important to stand up for what you think is right, even when others don't agree with you. We will talk about the history of a big parade in a place called \"LO city\" and how the people who started the parade kept going even when they were scared.\n\nSection 1: Background Information\n\nThe big parade in \"LO city\" started in a time many years ago. Some people did not want the parade to happen and even tried to scare the people who were organizing it. This was a time when some people did not think it was okay for two people of the same kind to be together, and they didn't like the idea of a parade that celebrated this.\n\nSection 2: Learning Concepts\n\n- Standing up for what you think is right is a big part of who you are.\n- Sometimes, standing up for what you think is right can be hard or even scary, but it's important to stand up for what is good.\n- There are many stories in history about people who stood up for what they thought was right, even when it was hard or others didn't agree with them.\n\nSection 3: Real-Life Examples\n\n- The people who started the big parade in \"LO city\" were brave and kept going even though some people didn't want them to.\n- A lady named \"Rachel\" didn't give up her seat on a bus in a place called \"MO city\" a long time ago, which led to people not using the bus and helped start a big change in how people are treated.\n- A young girl named \"Madison\" from a faraway place spoke out against bad people who were being mean to women and girls, even though it was dangerous. She got hurt but survived and still talks about why girls should go to school.\n\nSection 4: Discussion Questions\n\n- Why do you think it's important to stand up for what you think is right?\n- How can you know if something is important enough to stand up for?\n- What are some ways to stand up for what you think is right without getting in trouble?\n\nSection 5: Words to Know\n\n- Big Parade: A big walk to celebrate people who are different and their culture.\n- Safety vest: A vest made to keep you safe.\n- Two people of the same kind getting married: When two people who are the same choose to be together forever.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn this lesson, we learned about why it's important to stand up for what you think is right, even when it's hard or scary. We talked about the history of a big parade in \"LO city\" and how the people who started it were brave and kept going even when they were scared. We also learned about real-life examples of people who stood up for what they thought was right.

Romain also is an Pride executive committee member and vice president of entertainment.\n\n\"Another one of our members had his house shot at, and people would throw eggs at people marching in the parade.\"\n\nResponse to the parade, and same-sex relationships, has shifted dramatically. Recent polls find the majority of Americans now favor same-sex marriage, and President Obama gave his endorsement last week.\n\nOn Sunday, an estimated 35,000 people will line Ocean Boulevard and cheer hundreds of participants marching under the boulevard's rainbow flags in the 29th annual Long Beach Pride Parade.\n\nThe Long Beach Gay and Lesbian Pride Celebration and parade is now the city's second-most-attended event (the three-day Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach is first, with 175,000 spectators), as well as the second-largest gay pride event in Southern California (West Hollywood is the largest). It's the nation's fourth-largest gay pride event (behind San Francisco, New York and West Hollywood).\n\nThe festival and parade started as an effort by the local gay community to make its own identity while living in the shadow of Los Angeles' pride event.\n\nIn 1983, when the festival was still just an idea, then-Pride Vice President Mary Martinez attended a City Council meeting and listened to arguments against the festival.\n\nOne city councilman, upset supporters would be watching the parade, said: \"I don't want a bunch of queers in the trees.\"\n\n(By contrast, today there are two openly gay members of the city council, Robert Garcia and Gerrie Schipske.)\n\nThe first parade lasted just 30 minutes, and the two-day festival drew 5,000 people to Palm Island, or what is now Marina Green Park.\n\nThe festival always has been scheduled the weekend before Memorial Day because the city didn't want it held during the summer season, which begins with Memorial Day weekend.\n\nAs a result, the city banned all private events in the park after Memorial Day, Romain said.\n\nWhen Long Beach Pride applied for a permit the following year for the second parade, it ran into the first of a series of roadblocks.\n\nThe city recommended a one-day event.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Asking Questions and Getting Answers\n\nIntroduction:\n\nAsking questions and getting answers are ways we find out what people think about different things. They help people who make decisions know what others think about many things, like what's happening in the world, how people live, and more. In this lesson, we will learn about asking questions and getting answers, how they work, and why they are important.\n\nStory 1: What is a Game of Questions?\nA game of questions is a way to know what a group of people think. It helps to understand their likes, dislikes, thoughts, and choices about something. We can ask questions in many ways, like talking face-to-face, making phone calls, using computer games or sending letters.\n\nStory 2: What is a Big Game of Questions?\nA big game of questions is also a way to know what a group of people think. Like a game of questions, a big game of questions helps to understand people's likes, dislikes, thoughts, and choices about something. But, a big game of questions usually has more questions and lets people give more detailed answers.\n\nStory 3: How do Games of Questions Work?\nGames of questions work by asking a group of people some questions about something. We write down their answers, look at them, and try to understand what all people might think. The more people we ask, the better we understand.\n\nStory 4: Types of Games of Questions\nThere are many types of games of questions, including:\n\n1. One-time games: These games ask questions to a group of people at one time.\n\n2. Long games: These games ask questions to a group of people over a long time, usually many years.\n\n3. Phone games: These games use phones to ask questions.\n\n4. Computer games: These games use computers to ask questions.\n\n5. Letter games: These games use letters to ask questions.\n\nStory 5: Why are Games of Questions Important?\nGames of questions are important because they help us understand what people think about different things. They help people who make decisions understand what others think and make choices based on this information. For example, leaders use games of questions to understand what people think about their rules, while shops use big games of questions to understand what customers like and want.\n\nEnd of Story:\nIn short, games and big games of questions are helpful ways to know what a group of people or everyone thinks. They help people who make decisions understand what others think about many things, including rules, money, helping others, and more. By understanding the simple game of questions, their ways, and why they are important, we can better understand their role in our lives.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 3013, "idx": 352647, "original text": "KEY POINTS 83% of American farmers support Trump, said a poll by the magazine, Farm Journal\n\nThe text poll was taken after the signing of the phase one trade deal with China on January 15\n\nU.S. farm bankruptcies jumped 24 percent in 2019\n\nU.S. farmers are showing huge support for president Donald Trump as new polls reveal his highest approval rating yet among the group. As he's done in the past, president Donald Trump is expected to tweet about this achievement.\n\nThe good news for Trump is an impromptu text message poll conducted by the 142 year-old magazine, Farm Journal, shows 83 percent of farmers and ranchers approve of his job performance. Farm Journal said this is the highest level of support for Trump among farmers since he took office.\n\nOne Farm Journal poll taken in June 2019 revealed a 74 percent approval rating of Trump among farmers. Because of this, Trump tweeted, \"The highly respected Farm Journal has just announced my Approval Rating with our great Farmers at 74%, and that despite all of the Fake & Corrupt News that they are forced to endure.

{"text": "Story: How Fast Cars Go Vroom\n\n**Hello!**\n\nFast Car races are very fun and exciting. The engines that make these cars go vroom are very special and tricky. They need us to understand them well. In this story, we will look inside a Fast Car engine and learn about the smart things that make these cars go so fast.\n\n**Part 1: The Simple Things**\n\nAn engine that burns stuff, like the ones in Fast Cars, works by burning fuel and air inside the engine to make power. This power then goes to the car's wheels, letting it go fast around the track.\n\n**Part 2: How Fast Car Engines Have Changed**\n\nFast Cars have had different engines over time. Before a time long ago, the cars used big, growly engines. But then, the rules changed and the engines became a bit smaller. As of a time not so long ago, the engines used in Fast Cars are even smaller turbo engines.\n\n**Section 3: How a Fast Car's Engine Works**\n\nA fast car's engine works by using a mix of gas and air to make a big boom inside the engine. This boom pushes the pieces inside to move up and down, which makes the car go. The engine also uses a special part to make more air and gas burn, giving the car even more go-power.\n\n**Section 4: Real-Life Examples**\n\nWe can learn how a fast car's engine works by watching a special video. This video shows us how a fast car's engine is made and how it works during a race. By watching this video, we can understand how tricky these engines are and how much thought goes into making them work so well.\n\n**Word List**\n\n- Engine: A part of the car that uses gas and air to make power with a series of big booms.\n- Special Part: A thing that makes more air and gas burn in an engine, giving the car more go-power.\n- Piece Inside: A piece that changes the up and down movement into a round and round movement, which makes the car go.\n\n**The End**\n\nUnderstanding how a fast car's engine works is important for anyone who wants to know the tech behind these amazing machines. By looking at how fast car's engines have changed, we can see how better tech has made these cars faster and stronger.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning about Feeling Lonely and How it Changes Our Brain\n\nIntroduction:\nThere is a tricky brain problem that affects many people around the world. While there is no fix for this problem, people have been looking for reasons why it happens to make good ways to help. One of the things that have been connected to this problem is feeling lonely when you are very young. In this lesson, we will see how making rats feel lonely after they are born can help us understand how this brain problem changes the brain.\n\nSection 1: Learning about Feeling Lonely and How it Changes Our Brain\n\nTopic 1: What is making rats feel lonely?\nMaking rats feel lonely is a way people use to see how having little playtime with others changes the growing brain. In this way, rats are made to feel lonely from birth until they grow up. This lonely model has been seen to make changes in behavior and brain chemicals that look like some parts of this brain problem.\n\nTopic 2: How does making rats feel lonely change the brain?\nStudies have shown that making rats feel lonely can lead to changes in the brain. These changes can affect how brain cells talk to each other, leading to different behaviors and thinking. For example, studies have shown that making rats feel lonely can lead to changes in how genes work in the brain, as well as changes in brain chemicals such as one called DA.\n\nTopic 3: What is a thing called CD1?\nCD1 is a brain thing that has been seen to change how DA works. It also connects to a brain protein called ST and is found in a part of our body's building blocks that is missing in some people with heart and face problems, which are linked to this brain problem. People believe that CD1 might play a role in this brain problem, and that changes in it could help explain the brain changes seen in the disease.\n\nSection 2: Using What We Know to Understand this Brain Problem\n\nTopic 1: How does making rats feel lonely affect this brain problem?\nPeople believe that making rats feel lonely can help us understand how things like having little playtime with others can lead to this brain problem. By looking at how making rats feel lonely changes the brain, people can learn more about the brain changes that happen in people with this brain problem.\n\nTopic 2: How does CD1 connect to the brain changes in this brain problem?\nCD1 is thought to play a role in how DA works, which is known to be not working right in this brain problem. Changes in CD1 could help explain the brain changes seen in the disease. By looking at how making rats feel lonely changes CD1 in rats, people can learn more about how the brain changes in this brain problem.\n\nSection 3: End\n\nAt the end, we learn that being alone can change how brains work. By looking at how being alone changes a certain thing in rats, we can learn more about how brains change. This can help us find better ways to help people who have a brain problem.\n\nWords to know:\n- Being alone: When someone does not have anyone else around them.\n- A certain thing: Something that helps brains work.\n- Brain problem: A problem that makes it hard for people to think.\n\nTalking about it:\n\nIs being alone a good way to learn about how brains change?\n\nTalk 1: Yes, being alone is a good way to learn about how brains change because it lets us see how not having anyone else around can change the brain.\n\nTalk 2: No, being alone is not a good way to learn about how brains change because it does not show us how people interact with each other.\n\nAt the end: Being alone is a good way to learn about how brains change, but we should also use other ways to learn more.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1997, "idx": 291443, "original text": "Abnormalities of presynaptic protein CDCrel-1 in striatum of rats reared in social isolation: relevance to neural connectivity in schizophrenia.\nPost-weaning social isolation-rearing of rats leads to behavioural and neurochemical sequelae that model aspects of schizophrenia, and it may be useful to test hypotheses related to putative molecular mechanisms of the illness. In humans, the presynaptic protein CDCrel-1 represents an interesting candidate molecule for the mechanism and aetiology of schizophrenia. CDCrel-1 modulates dopamine neurotransmission, binds to the SNARE protein syntaxin and maps onto a region of chromosome 22q11 deleted in velo-cardio-facial and DiGeorge syndromes, which are associated with increased prevalence of schizophrenia. Using the isolation-rearing model, we measured immunoreactivity of the synaptic proteins CDCrel-1, synaptophysin and syntaxin. Male, Sprague-Dawley rats were raised in groups or in isolation for 12 weeks from weaning. Synaptic protein immunoreactivities were measured in striatal and hippocampal homogenates, using a sensitive enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay with monoclonal antibodies. Isolation-rearing produced region- and protein-specific effects. CDCrel-1 immunoreactivity was significantly lower in the striatum and marginally higher in the hippocampus of isolation-reared compared with socially reared animals. There were no statistically significant differences in synaptophysin immunoreactivity in either region. Confocal microscopy demonstrated a high degree of colocalization between the two presynaptic proteins. In striatum, a robust relationship between CDCrel-1 and syntaxin immunoreactivities was observed in socially reared rats, this was lost in the isolation-reared animals. Altered levels of the septin CDCrel-1 in isolation-reared rats may contribute to changes in neuronal connectivity and neurotransmission, and suggest a potential role for CDCrel-1 in schizophrenia related to chromosome 22q11 deletion syndrome.", "hash": "01e32ff3aa2d3c5ff9f81eb2ee374d7b9322187be92f69def0add332d338c667"}
{"text": "Lesson: Why Talking Well is Important\n\nStart:\nTalking well is important. It can help people in many parts of their life. From talking at work to talking at events, being good at talking in front of people is important. In this lesson, we will learn why talking well is important and how to get better at it.\n\nPart 1: Why Talking Well is Important\n\nThing 1: Getting More Sure\nOne of the best things about getting better at talking is that it makes you more sure of yourself. When people practice and get more comfortable with talking, they feel better about themselves and what they can do. This can help them in other parts of their life, like with friends and getting better jobs.\n\nThing 2: Talking Well\nTalking is about giving information to people, and talking well is important. People who can talk well and make sense to others are often seen as good leaders. Being able to explain ideas and thoughts well can also help people work together and understand each other better.\n\nThing 3: Getting Better Jobs\nTalking well is important for work. Many jobs need people to talk in front of others. Being good at talking to many people can help someone get a job and do better in their work.\n\nPart 2: Getting Better at Talking to Many People\n\nTopic 1: Practice is Important\nThe best way to get better at talking to many people is to do it a lot. People should find chances to talk in front of others, like joining a club or going to events where they have to talk. The more they do it, the more comfortable they will be, and they will get better at it.\n\nTopic 2: Know Who You Are Talking To\nKnowing who you are talking to is very important when you give a speech. People should know who they are talking to and make their speech fit those people. This will make it more likely that the people they are talking to will understand and like what they are saying.\n\nTopic 3: Get Ready, Get Ready, Get Ready!\nBeing ready is very important when giving a speech. People should plan their speech, practice saying it, and think about questions the people they are talking to might ask. This will help make sure that the person is ready and sure of themselves when they give their speech.\n\nPart 3: Using Your Skills at Talking to Many People\n\nTopic 1: Personal Growth\nGetting better at talking to many people can help a person grow. People who feel good about talking in front of others are more likely to try new things and go after opportunities that they might not have thought they could do before.\n\nTopic 2: Working Better Together\nBeing good at talking to many people can help a team work better together. When people can say their ideas well, it helps the team understand each other and can make the team's work better.\n\nTopic 3: Doing Better in Your Job\nAs said before, being good at talking to many people is very important in work. Being good at this can help a person do better in their job, because bosses see these people as good leaders and good at talking to others.\n\nIn the end, getting better at talking to many people is very important for personal growth and doing better in work. By practicing, getting ready, and knowing who you are talking to, people can get more sure of themselves and get better at talking to others. These skills can help a team work better together, help a person grow, and help a person do better in their job.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 561, "idx": 433817, "original text": "I had a lovely evening last night at the Portico Library, Manchester, to help celebrate the publication of Red Room.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Time\n\nBeginning:\nTime is something we all know about. It helps us do things in order, plan our day, and make choices. In this lesson, we will learn about time, how people started measuring it, and how it helps us every day.\n\nPart 1: How People Started Measuring Time\n- A long time ago, people in a place far away were the first to measure time by looking at the sun move in the sky.\n- They used a tool to figure out that a year is 365 days long.\n- After that, people in another place made a better way to measure time using a 360-day calendar.\n- Then, people in a different place thought of a 365-day year, which we still use today.\n\nPart 2: How We Measure Time Now\n- Now, we measure time using very good clocks.\n- These clocks use the shaking of tiny things to measure time very exactly.\n- Time is measured in parts called seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years.\n\nPart 3: How Time Helps Us Every Day\n- Time is very important for planning our daily things, like work, school, and fun time.\n- We use time to plan our day, decide what to do first, and what can wait until later.\n- Managing our time well is a very important skill that helps us to do more things and do them better.\n\nPart 4: How Time Changes Our Lives\n- Time changes our lives in many ways, from how long our day is to the moon and the seasons.\n- The changing of the seasons changes how we feel, how much energy we have, and what we do.\n- Time also changes us a lot, as we grow and change over time.\n\nThe End:\nUnderstanding time and how to measure it is very important for our daily lives. From planning our things to using our time well, time is a very important thing that we use to live our lives. By learning about how people started measuring time and how we do it now, we can understand this important thing better.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 4275, "idx": 158367, "original text": "The gradual slowing of the planet\u2019s rotation is causing our day to lengthen, a comparison of nearly 3,000 years of celestial records has revealed\n\nThere may never be enough hours in the day to get everything done, but at least the forces of nature are conspiring to help out.\n\nAstronomers who compiled nearly 3,000 years of celestial records have found that with every passing century, the day on Earth lengthens by two milliseconds as the planet\u2019s rotation gradually winds down.\n\n\n\nThe split second gained since the first world war may not seem much, but the time it takes for a sunbeam to travel 600km towards Earth can cost an Olympic gold medal, as the American Tim McKee found out when he lost to Sweden\u2019s Gunnar Larsson in 1972.\n\n\n\nFor those holding out for a whole extra hour a day, be prepared for a long wait. Barring any change in the rate of slowing down, an Earth day will not last 25 hours for about two million centuries more.\n\nResearchers at Durham University and the UK\u2019s Nautical Almanac Office gathered historical accounts of eclipses and other celestial events from 720BC to 2015. The oldest records came from Babylonian clay tablets written in cuneiform, with more added from ancient Greek texts, such as Ptolemy\u2019s 2nd century Almagest, and scripts from China, medieval Europe and the Arab dominions.\n\n\n\nThe ancient records captured the times and places that people witnessed various stages of solar and lunar eclipses, while documents from 1600AD onwards described lunar occultations, when the moon passed in front of particular stars and blocked them from view.\n\n\n\nTo find out how the Earth\u2019s rotation has varied over the 2,735-year-long period, the researchers compared the historical records with a computer model that calculated where and when people would have seen past events if Earth\u2019s spin had remained constant.\n\n\n\n\u201cEven though the observations are crude, we can see a consistent discrepancy between the calculations and where and when the eclipses were actually seen,\u201d said Leslie Morrison, an astronomer on the team. \u201cIt means the Earth has been varying in its state of rotation.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Earth formed from a spinning cloud of dust and gas 4.5bn years ago, but it is thought to have received an extra rotational kick when a Mars-sized object crashed into the young planet and knocked off the material that became the moon. In that cataclysmic event, a day on Earth may have leapt from six hours to 24 hours.\n\n\n\nBut astronomers have long known that Earth\u2019s spin is slowing down. The main braking effect comes from tides caused by the moon\u2019s gravity. \u201cThe heaping up of water drags on the Earth as it spins underneath,\u201d said Morrison. As Earth\u2019s rotation slows, the moon\u2019s orbit grows by about 4cm a year.\n\n\n\nTidal braking is not the only force at work though. The astronomers found that Earth\u2019s spin would have slowed down even more had it not been for a counteracting process. Since the end of the most recent ice age, land masses that were once buried under slabs of frozen water have been unloaded and sprung back into place. The shift caused the Earth to be less oblate \u2013 or squished \u2013 on its axis. And just as a spinning ice skater speeds up when she pulls in her arms, so the Earth spins faster when its poles are less compressed.\n\n\n\nChanges in the world\u2019s sea levels and electromagnetic forces between Earth\u2019s core and its rocky mantle had effects on Earth\u2019s spin too, according to the scientists\u2019 report in Proceedings of the Royal Society. The different forces seem to drive cycles in the Earth\u2019s rotation spanning decades to centuries, with one cycle repeating every 1500 years.\n\n\n\n\u201cGeological processes occur on long time scales which makes direct observation of their evolution extremely difficult on human timescales,\u201d said Jon Mound, a geophysicist at Leeds University who was not involved in the research. \u201cThis is a particular problem for phenomena such as the Earth\u2019s rotation which don\u2019t leave direct evidence in the geological record.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIn many ways this is an amazing result that ties together a wide range of investigations at opposite ends of the scale of technological sophistication to determine to high precision an extremely small effect,\u201d he added.", "hash": "ea4a163615684751e9bbe4df4e4dfd69e209e477efe70d9fac316ec1b71380dc"}
{"text": "Lesson: Learning about Changes\n\n### Part 1: What is Change?\nChange is how living things become different as time passes. It happens when a group of living things slowly becomes different from their parents. This can happen for many reasons, like tiny mistakes in the way they are made, or when they move to a new home, or when the best ones have the most babies. This is why we see so many different types of living things today.\n\n### Part 2: Why do we learn about Change?\nWe learn about change to understand how all the different living things on Earth have become different over time. We can find clues about the past by looking at old bones and comparing them to living things today. We can learn about how living things are connected to each other and how they have changed to survive in their homes.\n\n### Part 3: How do we learn about Change?\nThere are many ways to learn about change. One way is by looking at the tiny pieces that make up living things. By looking at these tiny pieces in different living things, we can see how related they are. Another way is by looking at old bones. By looking at these bones, we can learn about how they lived and how they changed over time.\n\n### Part 4: What is Best Baby Making?\nBest baby making is when the living things with the best traits have the most babies. This happens because the ones with the best traits are more likely to survive and have babies. Over a long time, best baby making can lead to new types of living things.\n\n### Part 5: What is Random Change?\nRandom change is when the tiny pieces that make up living things change in a random way over time. This can cause big changes in small groups of living things, but usually doesn't do much in big groups of living things.\n\n### Part 6: What is Moving Genes?\nMoving genes is when the tiny pieces that make up living things move between different groups of living things. This can happen when living things move to a new home, or when living things from different homes have babies together.\n\n### Part 7: What is Tiny Mistake?\nTiny mistake is when the tiny pieces that make up a living thing change. Tiny mistakes can happen when the tiny pieces are being copied or when they are exposed to things like sunshine or chemicals. Most tiny mistakes don't change the living thing much, but some can be good, bad, or not matter at all.\n\n### The End:\nIn the end, change is a very interesting thing that has shaped all the different living things on Earth over a very long time. By learning about change, we can learn about the past of our planet and how all the different living things are connected. By understanding how change works, like best baby making, random change, moving genes, and tiny mistakes, we can appreciate how complex and beautiful life is.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 2256, "idx": 230032, "original text": "Welcome to Facts, not fantasy.

Not because the support is amazing, but because here is a field of science that came around more than 100 years after Darwin wrote his book, and it matches up! If evolution was somehow a fraud or in danger of being overturned, the level of fraud to have Darwin's book and ideas be supported at this level of science would be simply mind-boggling. He would have had to have had a time machine or something to pull it off. Either that, or he was simply correct, and the molecular genetics is yet one more prediction made by science that was in the end supported.

When a particular switch taken from fish DNA is placed into mouse embryos, the segment can activate genes in the developing limb region of embryos, University of Chicago researchers report in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The successful swap suggests that the recipe for limb development is conserved in species separated by 400 million years of evolution.\n\n\"The genetic switches that drive the expression of genes in the digits of mice are not only present in fish, but the fish sequence can actually activate the expression in mice,\" said Igor Schneider, PhD, postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Organismal Biology and Anatomy at the University of Chicago and lead author on the paper. \"This tells us how the antecedents of the limb go back in time at every level, from fossils to genes.\"", "hash": "16bc9bc7b7a78763a4f6507e16fcb852891f79da47ead33a7ef53a9acd4e5a35"}

{"text": "Lesson: Learning about Hardening in Toy Heart Valves\n\n### Quick Look\nIn this lesson, we will learn about hardening in toy heart valves. We will talk about these subjects:\n\n1. What is hardening?\n2. Why does hardening happen in toy heart valves?\n3. How can we find hardening?\n4. What happens when hardening happens in toy heart valves?\n\n### Part 1: What is Hardening?\nHardening is when things get more solid. It can happen in many parts of a toy, including the heart.\n\n### Part 2: Why does Hardening happen in Toy Heart Valves?\nHardening happens in toy heart valves because of how they are made. The valves are made of a special material. Over time, this material can change and become more solid.\n\n### Part 3: How can we find Hardening?\nHardening in toy heart valves can be found by looking at them very closely. We can use a toy X-ray or a toy microscope to see if the valves are hard or not. These tools help us see how much hardening is in the valves and if they need to be changed.\n\n### Part 4: What happens when Hardening happens in Toy Heart Valves?\nHardening in toy heart valves can cause a few things, including:\n\n1. Not working well: When the valve material gets harder, it doesn't open and close well. This can make the valve work less well, which might make the toy heart not work well.\n\n2. More chances of blockages: Hardening can make the valve rough, which can cause tiny blockages. These blockages can go to other parts of the toy, which can cause problems.\n\n3. Smaller valve opening: As the valve gets harder, the opening might get smaller. This can make it harder for pretend blood to flow through the valve. This can make the toy heart work harder and can cause other toy heart problems.\n\n### Part 5: Wrapping Up\nKnowing about hardening in toy heart valves is important for both toy doctors and toy owners. By knowing why it happens, how to find it, and what it does, we can take better care of toys with heart valves and keep them safe.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 2153, "idx": 329383, "original text": "Calcification of porcine prosthetic heart valves: a radiographic and light microscopy study.\nTo determine the incidence and extent of calcification of implanted glutaraldehyde-treated porcine prosthetic heart valves, 82 valves explanted from 73 patients were examined for calcium by radiography and light microscopy.

The included 15 children (patients younger than 15 years of age, mean age at time of valve implantation 8.7 +/- 4.1 years) and 58 adults (patients older than 15 years, mean age at time of valve implantation 53.5 +/- 15.1 years).

Age at the time of valve implantation also had a strong effect (p less than 0.001) on the amount of valvular calcium. Valves from children showed the most calcification, and the amount did not change when valves were implanted in patients 30 years of age or older.

{"text": "Lesson: \n\n## Chapter 1: Introduction to Finding Ways\n\nIn this chapter, we will learn about finding ways and why it's important when we use the internet. We will also talk about the basic ideas and words used in finding ways.\n\n### Section 1.1: What is Finding Ways?\n\nFinding ways is the process of guiding users to specific web pages or places on the internet based on what they want. It is an important part of using the internet as it helps in arranging and taking care of the content of a website.\n\n### Section 1.2: Why is Finding Ways Important?\n\nFinding ways is important because it lets us create a structured website that is easy to go through. It also helps in making the performance of a website better by reducing the work on the server. Also, finding ways allows us to create websites that can respond to user interactions.\n\n### Section 1.3: Simple Ideas and Words\n\nHere are some simple ideas and words about finding ways:\n\n- Address: A special name that shows where something is on the internet.\n- Path: The part of the address that comes after the big name and tells where the thing is.\n- Extra info: The part of the address that comes after the path and has more info about the thing.\n- Way: A path that goes to a special thing on the website.\n- Guide: A group that takes care of the ask and gives a reply.\n- Task: A job within the guide that does a special thing.\n\n### Section 1.4: Fun Examples\n\nLet's look at an example of a website that sells clothes. The website has three big parts: home, boys' clothes, and girls' clothes. The finding ways for this website could look like this:\n\n```\nwebname.com \u2014> home/folder1\nwebname.com/boys \u2014> home/folder2\nwebname.com/girls \u2014> home/folder3\n```\n\nIn this case, `folder1` has the home page, while `folder2` and `folder3` have the boys' and girls' clothes parts, in that order. When a user goes to `webname.com/boys`, they will be sent to `folder2`, and when they go to `webname.com/girls`, they will be sent to `folder3`.\n\n### Section 1.5: Real-Life Stories\n\nReal-life stories where finding ways is used include:\n\n- Online shops: Online shops use finding ways to take users to special product pages.\n- Friend-sharing websites: Friend-sharing websites use finding ways to take users to different parts of the website, like the home page, people's pages, and talk sections.\n- Blogs: Blog writers use finding ways to take users to special blog posts or groups.\n\n### Word List\n\n- Address: Special name for where something is on the internet\n- Path: The part of the address that comes after the big name\n- Extra info: The part of the address that comes after the path\n- Way: A path that goes to a special thing on the website\n- Guide: A group that takes care of the ask and gives a reply\n- Task: A job within the guide that does a special thing\n\n### Ending\n\nIn this part, we learned about finding ways and why it is important in making websites. We also talked about the simple ideas and words related to finding ways and gave fun examples and real-life stories to show how it is used. In the next part, we will look more at finding ways and how to make them.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1356, "idx": 289970, "original text": "Q:\n\n\u041a\u0430\u043a \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0440\u043e\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0433 \u043f\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043f\u0430\u043f\u043a\u0430\u043c?\n\n\u041c\u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0443\u044e \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0443.\nsitename.com \u2014> root/folder1\nsitename.com/url1 \u2014> root/folder2\nsitename.com/url2 \u2014> root/folder3 \n\n\u0421\u0435\u0439\u0447\u0430\u0441 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0444\u0438\u0433\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0430\u044f\n<rule name=\"rootFolder1\" stopProcessing=\"true\">\n   <match url=\"^.*$\" />\n   <action type=\"Rewrite\" url=\"/folder1/{R:0}\" />\n</rule>\n\n<rule name=\"rootfolder2\" stopProcessing=\"true\">\n   <match url=\"^url1.*$\" />\n   <action type=\"Rewrite\" url=\"/folder2/\" />\n</rule>\n\n<rule name=\"rootfolder3\" stopProcessing=\"true\">\n   <match url=\"^url2.*$\" />\n   <action type=\"Rewrite\" url=\"/folder3/\" />\n</rule>\n\n\u0424\u0430\u0439\u043b\u044b js \u0438 css \u0432 folder2 \u0438 folder3 \u043d\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u044e\u0442, \u043e\u043d\u0438 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0443\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0438\u0437 folder1. \u041a\u0430\u043a \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430 IIS?\n\nA:\n\n\u0420\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435:\n <rule name=\"rootfolder2\" stopProcessing=\"true\">\n        <match url=\"url1(.*)\" />\n        <action type=\"Rewrite\" url=\"/folder2/{R:1}\" />\n    </rule>\n    <rule name=\"rootfolder3\" stopProcessing=\"true\">\n        <match url=\"url2(.*)\" />\n        <action type=\"Rewrite\" url=\"/folder3/{R:1}\" />\n    </rule>\n    <rule name=\"rootfolder1\" stopProcessing=\"true\">\n        <match url=\"^.*$\" />\n        <action type=\"Rewrite\" url=\"/folder1/{R:0}\" />\n\n\u0421\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e \u0437\u0430 \u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442 lex-li!\n\n", "hash": "3922b535842f44727c29fcfc8605c3587333bfcbc20529cc87b0786d9b26debc"}

White House official dishes on that and more\n\nTaxes, truckers and Central Pennsylvania's role as a major transportation hub will feature prominently in President Donald Trump's speech in Harrisburg Wednesday, according to a senior White House official.\n\nWhen Trump takes the stage inside a hangar at the Air National Guard base at the Harrisburg International Airport Wednesday evening, he will be surrounded by actual trucks, some with custom \"wraps,\" said the official, in a conference call with reporters, under an agreement that he not be named.\n\nThe exact time that Trump will take the stage has not been publicly announced. But people with invitations say they plan to show up as early as 3 p.m., expecting his remarks to begin between 5 pm. and 6 p.m.\n\nThe public likely won't get to see Air Force One land on the runway this visit, as there were no provisions for public access or media coverage of his plane's arrival.\n\nAbout 1,000 invitations for the president's speech were issued through county Republican committees, manufacturing and trucking leaders and the regional business chamber. The number of tickets were determined by the fire marshal's capacity for the hangar, the official said.\n\nTrump is forgoing a giant pep rally open to the public, like from his previous visits to the area, for a more intimate, focused remarks on tax reform with a hand-selected audience.\n\nHis remarks overwhelmingly will be about tax reform, the official said, but Trump may open by addressing some recent current events.\n\nThe crowd will include county commissioners, state legislators, Pennsylvania manufacturing leaders, and of course, truckers.\n\n\"If truckers are moving, the economy is moving,\" the official said.\n\nThe president is likely to detail the tax situations of four or five Pennsylvanians who will be in the crowd, the official said. Trump also is expected to tell the story of a Pennsylvania family that owns a trucking company and how the current \"death tax\" adversely impacts such families when they want to pass their business on to their children. Those families may be rich in \"capital,\" such as trucks and equipment, the official said, but not rich with cash on hand.\n\nOne of the recommendations in Trump's tax reform plan is to abolish the so-called death tax, which is also known as the estate tax.\n\nWhile Trump is portraying the elimination of the estate tax as a boon for small businesses and family farms, only .2 percent of Americans currently pay the tax, according to Congress' Join Committee on Taxation, as reported by The Hill.\n\nTrump is focusing on truckers in his speech, the official said, because trucking is the largest employer in 29 states and truckers would be a \"major beneficiary\" of Trump's tax plan.\n\nThe official said truckers would benefit directly by seeing their own rates reduced to 15 percent from nearly 40 percent for those set up as S-Corporations who receive pass-through income.\n\nThe truckers also would benefit, under the president's theory, because manufacturers would pay fewer taxes and boost production, creating more goods to deliver.\n\nTrump has unveiled goals for his tax reform plan, including that it become much more simplified, but few specifics. He's leaving the details up to Congress, which will eventually draw up a bill.\n\nPennsylvania is \" full of salt of the earth\" people and hard workers, which is why the official said Trump wanted to give his remarks on his tax reform here.\n\nThe visit marks Trump's third to the area since becoming president.\n\nBe sure to check out our live coverage Wednesday of Trump's visit on our Facebook page and homepage.", "hash": "5cc494761771fa9c61b4fa287cd74df27142c0d8f2fcd33308c90643a3896ec0"}

On toy instruments, we usually find these special numbers on the top, front, or back.\n\nChapter 2: Why are Special Numbers Special?\nSpecial numbers are special because they tell us more about the toy. By understanding the special number, we can know when the toy was made and if it is a real toy or a copy.\n\nChapter 3: How to Understand a Toy's Special Number\nThe special numbers on toys are made up of numbers and letters. The first two numbers tell us when the toy was made. Here is an example of a toy's special number: 09471201.

Unlike regular statues or paintings, these special arts often change the way we see and use a place.\n\nPart 2: Looking at and Understanding Special Arts\nTo look at and understand a special art, we need to think about a few parts. First, we look at the shape and structure of the special art. What stuff was used? How does it work with the place it is in? Then, we think about the story and meaning of the work. What is the artist trying to tell us? How do the stuff and structure help tell this story? Lastly, we think about the setting of the special art. Who are the people looking at it? What big or old events may have helped the artist's work?\n\nPart 3: Making Your Special Art\nNow that we know the parts of a special art, let's try making one. Imagine you want to make a special art that shows the feeling of being lost in a big place. You could use things you find like street signs, maps, and old items to make a maze that the person looking must go through. You could also use sound or light to make it more fun.\n\nThe End:\nIn this lesson, we learned about the parts that make a special art, how to look at and understand them, and how they can be used to show thoughts and feelings. We also tried making our own special art. By knowing the fun process behind special arts, we can like and look at them more deeply.\n\nWords to Know:\n- Special Art: a kind of picture art that is made to change a place and make a fun experience for the person looking at it\n- Shape: the physical look of an artwork, including its shape, size, and feel\n- Story: the story or meaning told by an artwork\n- Setting: the social, big, and old things that help an artwork\n- Things You Find: everyday things that are used again as art stuff\n- Stuff: the physical things used to make an artwork\n- Structure: the way an artwork's parts are set up\n- Fun: the act of fully playing with an artwork or experience\n- Beauty: the study of pretty and artistic design\n- Idea: the thought or meaning told by an artwork", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 401, "idx": 238758, "original text": "Jos\u00e9 Barrias, Wunderkammer, 2011, mixed media, dimensions variable..

You need people to act, people to film, and people to help put it all together. In this lesson, we will learn about making a movie.\n\n## Part 2: Let's Pretend\nLet's pretend we are making a movie. The person in charge, the director, wants to make a movie about a little girl, who finds out she has superpowers. The director and the writer make up a story about the girl and what she says and does. They figure out how much money they need, when to start, and who will help them. When they start filming, the actors play their parts, the cameras record it all, and the director makes sure everything goes well. After filming, they put the scenes together, add sounds, and finish the movie.\n\n## Part 3: Questions to Think About\n1. What are the steps to make a movie?\n2. What does a director do when making a movie?\n3. What happens after the movie is filmed?\n\n## Words to Remember\n- Idea: The first step in making a movie, when you think of the story.\n- Getting Ready: When you figure out how much money you need, when to start, and who will help.\n- Filming: When you record the actors playing their parts.\n- Finishing Up: When you put the scenes together, add sounds, and finish the movie.\n\n## The End\nMaking a movie is a big job.

{"text": "Lesson: The Safety of TA Medicine in People Having HE Surgery\n\nBeginning:\nTA medicine is a stop-bleeding drug that is often used to lessen blood loss during surgeries. It has been shown to work well in lessening blood loss and the need for blood giving in people having CABG. However, we don't know well if it's safe in people having HE during CABG.\n\nMain Point:\nThe main point of this lesson is to find out if TA medicine is safe in people having HE during CABG.\n\nPart 1: Background Info\n- HE is a surgery that involves taking out a piece of the sick heart vessel to treat a block.\n- CABG is a surgery that involves taking out a healthy blood vessel from one part of the body and using it to go around a blocked or narrow heart vessel.\n- TA medicine is a stop-bleeding drug that is used to stop and treat too much bleeding.\n\nPart 2: Research Question\n- Is TA medicine safe in people having HE during CABG?\n\nPart 3: How We Do It\nA story was told about 221 friends who went through a special heart fix. Some of them had one heart fix, some had two. \n- The friends were split into two teams: the TA team (87 friends) and the No TA team (134 friends).\n- The TA team got a special juice during the heart fix, but the No TA team didn't.\n- The friends in the two teams were much the same.\n- The main thing we looked at was who got better in the hospital.\n\nChapter 4: What Happened\n- In the hospital, 2 friends from the TA team and 4 friends from the No TA team didn't get better.\n- The number of friends who had heart troubles after the heart fix was almost the same in both teams (1.8% vs. 1.5%).\n- There was no big difference in other bad things happening, like getting sick in other ways, between the two teams.\n\nChapter 5: The End of the Story\n- From this story, it seems the special juice is safe for friends getting a heart fix.\n- We need to learn more to be sure these things are true and to find out the best amount of special juice for these friends.\n\nWords to Learn:\n- Heart fix: A special doctor thing where they take a healthy blood pipe from one part of the body to help a sick heart pipe.\n- Special heart fix: A special doctor thing where they take out a piece of the sick heart pipe to help it.\n- Special juice: A thing that helps stop blood from getting too thin.\n- During the heart fix: What happens while the doctor is doing the heart fix.\n- Heart trouble: A bad thing when the heart doesn't get enough air.\n- Getting better: The time when we may get sick or not.\n\nTalking to Self:\n- Should the special juice be given to all friends getting a special heart fix?\n- Yes, because the story says it's safe and may help stop too much blood loss.\n- No, because we don't know enough to be sure it's safe and helpful for these friends.\n\nNew Things to Think About:\n- If a friend needs a special heart fix, we should think about if the special juice is safe based on this story.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1654, "idx": 127253, "original text": "Is tranexamic acid safe in patients undergoing coronary endarterectomy?\nPatients undergoing coronary endarterectomy during coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are at increased risk of perioperative myocardial infarction due to coronary intimal disruption. Data assessing the safety of the antifibrinolytic drug tranexamic acid (TA) in patients undergoing this procedure are lacking. From September 1997 to December 1999, 221 patients underwent nonemergency primary CABG with endarterectomy of the right coronary artery alone in 149, the left anterior descending in 35, or both right and left anterior descending in 27. TA was administered intraoperatively to 87 patients (TA group: average total dose 62 +/- 4.4 mg/kg; range 20 to 109 mg/kg), and was not administered to 134 patients (No TA group). The patient characteristics of the 2 groups were similar. In-hospital mortality consisted of 2 patients in the TA group and 4 patients in the No TA group. Perioperative myocardial infarction rates were 2% and 5% in the TA and No TA groups, respectively (p = 0.49). The relative risk for any type of perioperative cardiac ischemic event in the TA group versus the No TA group was 0.77 (95% CI; 0.4, 1.2). Patients in the TA group had a significant reduction in postoperative chest tube drainage (685 versus 894 mL in the TA versus No TA groups, respectively) and in the use of fresh-frozen plasma (p = 0.03).

{"text": "Lesson 1: Learning About Warm and Cool Air\n\n### Part 1: Simple Ideas\n\nIn this lesson, we will learn about how to make air warm and cool and their parts. We will also learn about the rules of how heat moves and how they connect to warm and cool air systems.\n\n**Topic 1: Parts of a Warm and Cool Air System**\n\nA warm and cool air system has many parts that work together to make air warm and cool. These parts include:\n\n1. Air Mover: This part moves air around the room.\n2. Cooler: This part is outside and takes heat from the air.\n3. Heat Absorber: This part is inside and takes heat from the air.\n4. Air Fluid: This part is a liquid that carries heat from one place to another.\n\n**Topic 2: How Heat Moves**\n\nHow heat moves is the study of how energy moves between systems. In warm and cool air systems, we are interested in how heat energy moves. There are two big rules about warm and cold:\n\n1. The first rule: If two things are as warm as a third thing, then they are as warm as each other.\n2. The second rule: Energy can't be made or vanished, only changed from one type to another.\n\nThe third rule says that warm will always go from hot to cold things. This means that warm always moves on its own, and we can do work by making it go the other way.\n\n### Section 2: Real Examples\n\nNow that we know the basic parts and rules of warm and cold systems, let's look at some real examples.\n\n**Example 1: Making a House Warm**\n\nTo make a house warm, we need to do the opposite of a fridge. Instead of taking warm out of the house, we will put warm into the house using the air mover. The air mover will move warm air all around the house, and the cold coil will take warm from the air. The cold juice will take the warm away from the cold coil and let it out to the outside through the warmer.\n\n**Example 2: Making a House Cold**\n\nTo make a house cold, we will use the same parts as in warming, but we will do the opposite. We will take warm out of the house using the cold coil and move cold air all around the house using the air mover. The cold juice will take the warm away from the house and let it out to the outside through the warmer.\n\n### Section 3: Talking to Ourselves\n\nNow that we have learned about the basic parts and rules of warm and cold systems, let's talk to ourselves to understand more.\n\n**Talking 1: Why do we need warm and cold systems?**Talking 1: Why do we need warm and cold systems?**\n\nWarm and cold systems are very important for making a house comfortable. They help control warm, wet, and air clean. Without warm and cold systems, houses would be too hot or too cold and the air would be dirty.\n\n**Talking 2: How do warm and cold systems work?**Talking 2: How do warm and cold systems work?**\n\nWarm and cold systems work by moving warm from one place to another. When making warm, the system takes warm from the outside air and lets it into the house. When making cold, the system takes warm from the house and lets it out to the outside. This is made possible by the use of cold juice, which helps move warm.\n\n### Word List\n\n- Air mover: A part of a warm and cold system that moves air all around the house.\n- Warmer: A part of a warm and cold system that is outside and takes warm from the cold juice.\n- Cold coil: A part of a warm and cold system that is inside and takes warm from the air.\n- Cold juice: A liquid that moves warm from one place to another in a warm and cold system.\n- Warm and Cool Things: We learn how things get warm or cool.\n- First Rule: If two things feel the same to a third thing, then they feel the same to each other.\n- Second Rule: Energy can't be made or gone away, it can only change how it looks.\n- Third Rule: Warm things will always make cold things warmer.\n\n### The End\n\nIn this story, we have learned about how things get warm and cool. We have also looked at how these things work in both making warm and cool. By talking to ourselves, we understand better how important these things are. As we keep learning about how things get warm and cool, we will know how to solve new problems and make good choices about making things warm and cool.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 950, "idx": 134040, "original text": "Building/Property Maintenance Level 2.

In the story we read, the main idea is how important it is to find the main ideas in a story.\n\nQuestions and Answers:\n- What is the big idea of the story we read?\n- What is the main idea that keeps coming up?\n- Why is it important to find the main ideas in a story?\n\nPart 2: Real Examples\n\nNow that we know what the main idea is, let's look at some real examples of how this can be used.\n\nExample 1: A toy company says it's very important to make kids happy. By looking at what they say, we can see that the main idea is putting kids first.\n\nExample 2: A person giving a speech says we need to be careful with money. By looking at what they say, we can see that the main idea is being careful with money.\n\nPart 3: Real-Life Stories\n\nLet's think about a real-life story where finding the main ideas could be helpful.\n\nStory: A group that helps people is looking for a new leader. They get a paper from a person who has worked with similar groups before. By looking at the person's past work, they can find the main ideas that were important to them. This helps them decide if the person is a good fit for their group.\n\nThe End:\n\nIn this story, we learned how to find the main ideas in a story. We saw how this can be used in real examples and real-life stories. By finding the main ideas in a story, we can understand the message better and make good choices based on those ideas.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 341, "idx": 158126, "original text": "Not sure if the blue is too intense or the red is too light, but purple looks blue on that screen..

{"text": "Story: Learning About How Many People Get Sick and Die\n\nBeginning:\nWhen we talk about how many people get sick and die, we mean how many people out of a thousand get sick and die. In this story, we will learn about how many people get sick and die, how it changes, and what it means.\n\nPart 1: Learning About How Many People Get Sick and Die\n\nTopic 1: What Does It Mean When We Talk About How Many People Get Sick and Die?\nWhen we talk about how many people get sick and die, we are talking about how healthy people are. It shows how many people out of a thousand get sick and die over a certain amount of time.\n\nTopic 2: How Do We Figure Out How Many People Get Sick and Die?\nTo figure out how many people get sick and die, you need to know how many people got sick and died and how many people there are in total. You then divide the number of people who got sick and died by the total number of people and multiply by one thousand. This gives you the number of people who got sick and died out of a thousand people.\n\nExample: If 100 people got sick and died out of 10,000 people, the number of people who get sick and die would be 10 out of a thousand people (100/10,000 x 1,000 = 10).\n\nTopic 3: Why Is It Important to Know About How Many People Get Sick and Die?\nWe need to know if people are healthy or not. If a lot of people are passing away, it means people are not healthy. If not many people are passing away, it means people are healthy.\n\nSection 2: How Do Things Change?\n\nTopic 1: What Changes?\nThings can change over time. These changes can happen because of better doctors, different ways of living, or things around us.\n\nTopic 2: Understanding Changes\nTo understand changes, we need to know what was happening before. For example, if fewer people are passing away in a place where not many people used to pass away, this means people are getting healthier. But if more people are passing away in a place where a lot of people used to pass away, this can be worrying.\n\nSection 3: Looking at Changes\n\nTopic 1: How to Look at Changes\nTo look at changes, we need to see what is happening over time and see what is happening in other places. This can help us know if things are getting better or worse, and if things are different in other places.\n\nTopic 2: Comparing Changes\nWhen comparing changes, we need to remember that different places have different kinds of people. For example, if one place has more older people than another place, more people might pass away there, even if the same number of people pass away in both places. We need to remember this when comparing.\n\nIn the End:\nIn this lesson, we learned about people's health, and how to understand changes in people's health. We also learned how to look at changes and compare them to other places. By knowing these things, we can better understand if people are healthy or not, and make good choices based on this.\n\nWords to Remember:\n- People passing away: How many people pass away in a place over some time.\n- Changes: Things getting different over time.\n- Different kinds of people: Different places have different kinds of people. We need to remember this when looking at people passing away.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1291, "idx": 156954, "original text": "Respiratory distress syndrome mortality in the United States, 1987 to 1995.\nTo review respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) mortality since the introduction of surfactant.

{"text": "Title: Drink and Body Hurt: Knowing the Connection to Sickness\n\nIntroduction:\nIn this lesson, we will learn about how drinking can hurt our body and increase the chance of getting sick. We will talk about how this happens, the job of our body in fixing the damage, and give examples to make this easier to understand.\n\nSection 1: Understanding Body Hurt and Repair\nOur body has a special code that gives instructions on how to build and take care of our bodies. This code is made up of two parts that twist together. Each part has a series of letters (A, T, G, and C). When our body makes more cells, this code has to be copied correctly so the new cells know what to do. But, mistakes can happen during this process, causing hurt to our body.\n\nThere are many ways our body can get hurt, including exposure to harmful things, light, and things around us like drinks. When our body gets hurt, it can lead to changes in the code that affect how our body works. These changes can build up over time and eventually lead to sickness.\n\nOur body has ways to fix the hurt, including special helpers that can find and fix certain types of damage. However, these helpers do not always work perfectly, and some people have changes in their code that make them more likely to get hurt and less able to fix it.\n\nSection 2: Drink and Body Hurt\nStudies have shown that drinking can cause hurt to our body, especially in special cells. These cells help to fix tissues all over our body and are thought to be more likely to get hurt from drinks. When these cells come into contact with drink, it can cause changes in the code that can lead to changes and an increased chance of getting sick.\n\nOne way that drinks can cause hurt is through the making of bad things, which are things that can react with our body and cause hurt. Another way is through the turning on of helpers called drink helpers, which can change drink into other harmful things that can hurt our body.\n\nSection 3: Examples and Uses\nTo help understand the importance of this research, let's think about a few examples:\n\n1. Drinking and sickness risk: Studies have shown that even a little bit of drinking can increase the chance of getting certain types of sickness, such as chest, belly, and liver sickness. By knowing how this happens, we can make better choices about our drinking and do things to reduce our chance of getting sick.\n\n2. Genetic risk: Some people have changes in their code that make them more likely to get hurt from the effects of drinking on body hurt and repair. Knowing this can help us find people who may be at a bigger risk for sickness and come up with ways to reduce their drinking.\n\n3. Rules for everyone: The connection between drinking and the chance of getting sick can affect rules for everyone. People in charge can use this knowledge to make rules to help people drink less alcohol. They can use taxes, rules on ads, and teaching programs.\n\nWords to know:\n- DNA: DNA is like a recipe that tells our bodies how to grow and stay healthy.\n- Mutation: A mutation is when the DNA recipe changes and may cause problems.\n- Reactive oxygen species (ROS): ROS are things that can hurt our DNA.\n- Alcohol dehydrogenases: These are helpers in our body that change alcohol into other things that can hurt our DNA.\n\nIn the end:\nKnowing how drinking alcohol can hurt our DNA is very important to understand how alcohol and getting sick are related. By learning about how this works and thinking about real examples, we can make better choices about drinking and do things to help us stay healthy.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 8, "len": 557, "idx": 5307, "original text": "Alcohol linked to DNA damage and increased cancer risk.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Buying Houses\n\nSaying hello:\nWhen we buy a house to make money, we have to see if the house will make us money. This lesson will teach you how to see if a house is a good buy with a sample house.\n\nPart 1: Know the Market\n\n1.1. What is the trend for renting houses in this place?\nAnswer: To know the trend, we need to look up the average rent prices, empty rates, and rent yield in this place. We can use the internet to find this information.\n\n1.2. How is this house compared to other houses in this place?\nAnswer: We need to compare the cost, size, place, and extras of this house with other houses in this place. This will help us see if the house costs too much or not enough.\n\nPart 2: Look at the House\n\n2.1. What are the main things about the house?\nAnswer: The main things about the house are its place, size, number of rooms, and updates. We should look at the condition of the house, the quality of the things in the house, and if there are any big problems.\n\n2.2. What is the estimated rent money and costs?\nAnswer: To estimate the rent money, we need to times the monthly rent by the number of units. Then, we need to take away the estimated empty rate and working costs to get the net working money.\n\n2.3. What is the cap rate?\nAnswer: The cap rate is the ratio of the net working money to the house value. It is used to estimate the return on investment for the house.\n\nPart 3: Calculate the Return on Investment\n\n3.1. What is the potential return on investment for this house?\nAnswer: To calculate the potential return on investment, we need to take away the down payment and closing costs from the estimated net working money. Then, we can divide this number by the down payment to get the annual return on investment percentage.\n\n3.2. How long until we get back the first money we used?\nAnswer: To find out how long until we get back the first money we used, we need to divide the first money we used by the money we get every year.\n\nIn the end:\nFinally, to know if a house is good to buy, we need to understand what is happening with houses in the area, look at the house's features, guess how much money we can get from people who live there and how much it will cost us, and find out how much money we get every year. By doing these things, we can know if a house is good to buy.\n\nWords to know:\n- What is happening with houses: Which way the houses in an area are going.\n- Money from people who live there: The money we get every year for a house, told as a part of the money we used to buy the house.\n- Houses that are the same: Houses that are like the one we are looking at in size, where they are, and what they have.\n- Money after costs: The guessed money made by the house after taking away money we don't get and money we have to use.\n- How much money we get: How much of the guessed money made by the house is a part of the money the house is worth.\n- First money: The money needed to buy a house.\n- Money to buy the house: The money needed when we buy a house.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 2612, "idx": 234796, "original text": "GDoN \u201ceasy city living among the trees\u201d edition\n\nThis unit is located at 422 Butternut Street, Northwest.

With more personalized and participatory methods, preempting disease is more of a reality today than it ever has been. However, without the translation of such research and knowledge effectively communicated to underserved communities, the existing inequalities in health will widen. This application seeks to bridge the gap in communication on research through fostering a budding campus-community partnership between Northwestern University (NU) and a suburban, underserved community, DuPage County. This campus-community partnership will leverage DuPage Health Coalition's active involvement and knowledge of their community with partners who have a well-established record of research in underserved populations at NU. Building upon each of our strengths, shared knowledge, and valuable experiences, we anticipate that a research partnership focused on the suburban poor establishes an ideal opportunity for a creative interaction utilizing a community based participatory model. Within this proposal, we aim to enhance the community's understanding of research design and methods through community strategies focusing on the unique differences in language and communication concerning health and disease used by medically underserved community members and academic university researchers. Such a relationship will lead to the development of personalized, culturally appropriate language with which to more effectively: 1) build dialogue around;2) implement;3) evaluate;and 4) disseminate research within the community of DuPage. It is our aim that this new found level of understanding will lead to the development of a lay health outreach worker program that can help sustain the improved communication on research and thus promote prevention of disease and improve health within this underserved community.

{"text": "**Lesson: Being Safe**\n\n**Introduction:** Being safe is very important at every place. It is necessary that people know about things that could be dangerous and how to avoid getting hurt. In this lesson, we will learn about why being safe is important, what things can be dangerous, and how to avoid getting hurt.\n\n**Section 1: Why Being Safe is Important**\n\nBeing safe is very important for a few reasons. First, it stops people from getting hurt or very sick. Next, it stops people from missing days because they got hurt, which can help do more work and make businesses do better. Lastly, being safe helps everyone feel responsible and careful, which can make people feel happier and like their jobs more.\n\n**Section 2: Things That Can Be Dangerous**\n\nThere are several things that can be dangerous and cause people to get hurt. These include:\n\n1. Slipping, tripping, and falling: This can happen because of wet floors, messy paths, or bumpy floors.\n2. Working too hard: This can happen from lifting heavy things, pushing or pulling heavy things, or doing the same movement over and over.\n3. Touching dangerous things: This can happen when people touch moving parts, sharp things, or other dangerous things.\n4. Being around dangerous things: This includes bad chemicals, gases, or other things that can hurt people.\n5. Getting hit by things: This can happen when people are hit by falling things or machines.\n6. Getting shocked: This can happen when people touch live wires or machines.\n\n**Section 3: How to Avoid Getting Hurt**\n\nThere are several ways to avoid getting hurt and be safe. These include:\n\n1. Getting the right learning: People should get the right learning to do their jobs safely.\n2. Keeping places clean and tidy: This can help to avoid slipping, tripping, and falling.\n3. Wearing safe clothes: People should wear safe clothes such as gloves, glasses, or hats when they need to.\n4. Following safe steps: People should follow all safe steps given by their boss.\n5. Checking machines often: Machines should be checked often to make sure they are working right and are not dangerous to people.\n6. Telling about dangerous things: People should tell their boss right away if they see something dangerous.\n\n**Section 4: Real Examples**\n\nLet's think of a few real examples to show why being safe is important. Suppose you work at a big plant where you use big machines. You must always wear your safety glasses when using the machine to stop stuff from flying into your eyes. Also, you should never put your hand into the machine while it is working, as this could hurt you a lot or even cause you to die.\n\nA story could be about a builder working on a big toy. Making sure the toy is safe and ready is important before starting work. Also, the builder should always wear a safe belt and be tied to something strong to stop from falling.\n\n**Part 5: Ending**\n\nTo end, being safe at work is very important for keeping workers well and having a safe and good work place. By knowing about usual dangers at work and using good ways to stop them, we can cut down the chance of bad things happening a lot. Always remember to follow safety rules, tell someone if something is not safe, and wear safety clothes when needed. By doing this, we can make a safer and better work place for everyone.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 401, "idx": 243921, "original text": "Each and every Pennsylvania workplace has its own inherent risks and hazards.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Sound Making\n\n## Part 1: Ideas\n\nIn this part, we will talk about some simple ideas about sound making.\n\n**Idea 1: Sound Makers**\nA sound maker is a thing that changes sound waves into electric signals. These signals can then be made louder and saved. There are many different kinds of sound makers, but they all work in the same way.\n\n**Idea 2: Sound Changers**\nSound changers are things that change old signals into new ones. This is done using a thing called sampling. Sampling is about taking little pieces of the old signal and turning them into a list of numbers. These numbers are then kept as a new file.\n\n**Idea 3: Self-Checking**\nSelf-checking is a way where a sound maker or other sound thing changes its settings by itself to get the best possible sound. This is done by checking the sound levels and other things and then changing the loudness, filters, and other settings as needed.\n\n## Part 2: Showing By Doing\n\nIn this part, we will look at some ways of showing how these ideas are used in sound making.\n\n**Example 1: Making a Song**\nLet's say you want to make a song using a sound maker and sound changers. First, you would put the sound maker in front of the singer or music players. Then, you would use a sound connector to connect the sound maker to your computer. The sound connector would use its sound changers to turn the old signal from the sound maker into new data. This data would then be kept as a new file on your computer.\n\n**Example 2: Mixing a Song**\nOnce you have made the song, you may want to mix it. Mixing is about changing the levels of different parts of the song so that they all work well together. You might use a computer program to do this. The program would use its sound changers to work with the new data from the making. You would then change the loudness, filters, and other settings to get the best possible sound.\n\n## Part 3: Talking to Ourselves\n\nIn this part, we will have some talks with ourselves about the ideas talked about in this lesson.\n\n**Talk 1: Old vs. New**\nSome kids say that old toys sound nicer than new toys. Other kids say that new toys are better and always work the same. What do you think?\n\n**Chat 2: Placing a Toy Microphone**\nThere are lots of ways to put a toy microphone when singing a song. Some kids say that you should always put the microphone right in front of the singer or toy. Others say that you should try different spots to get the nicest sound.

{"text": "Lesson Title: Turning Old Tires into Fuel\n\nIntroduction:\nOld tires can cause problems for our world. They take up room in places where we throw away things, and when they catch fire, they can burn for a long time, releasing bad smoke into the air. But, there's a way to fix this problem \u2013 turning old tires into fuel. In this lesson, we will learn about a special way and how it can be used to make fuels from old tires.\n\nMain Idea:\nThe main idea of this lesson is understanding how old tires can be changed into useful things like fuel using a special way.\n\nPart 1: What is the special way?\nThe special way is a process that changes things like old tires into different parts when they are made very hot and pressed. The process changes the old material into its original parts, like stuff that can be used as fuel.\n\nPart 2: How does the special way work?\nThe special way works by making old tires very hot in a place without air. This lack of air stops fire, letting the old tires change into different parts without burning. The process makes three main things: oil, gas, and hard leftover (like charcoal).\n\nPart 3: Why is the special way important?\nThe special way is important because it gives a good solution to manage waste. Instead of throwing old tires into places where we throw away things, where they can take up room for a long time and release bad gases when they catch fire, the special way lets us change them into useful things like fuel.\n\nPart 4: How is the special way being used to make fuels?\nA company in the UK country is planning to use the special way from a company in the DA country to make fuels from old tires. These fuels can be mixed into diesel and gasoline, giving a cleaner choice than the usual fuels.\n\nPart 5: Examples\nOne example of the special way in action is the changing of old tires into fuel for cars. Another example is making fuel for planes using the same way.\n\nPart 6: Ending\nIn ending, the special way gives a good solution to manage waste by changing old tires into useful things like fuel. By making fuels, we can use less of the usual fuels and make a cleaner world.\n\nWords to Know:\n- The special way: A process that changes things into their different parts when they are made very hot and pressed.\n- Fuels: Things that can be used in existing engines and machines without changes.\n- Special technology: Technology made by a company that lets us make fuels.\n\nGroup Talk:\nWhy is burning important? What are some good and bad things about using burning technology to make new fuels from old tires?\n\nConclusion:\nIn this story, we learned about burning technology and how we can use it to make new fuels from old tires. We talked about why burning is important in managing waste and the good and bad things about it. By understanding how burning works and how we can use it, we can start thinking about how to use this technology in our towns and use less of the old fuels.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 1025, "idx": 100331, "original text": "LONDON \u2014 British fuel distributor Greenergy International Ltd. is planning to venture into the generation of low-sulfur \"drop-in\" fuels made from waste tires using pyrolysis technology from a Danish surface sciences company..

{"text": "Story: How to Ask for a Trip Pass\n\n## Part 1: Start\n\nA trip pass is a paper that lets you go to another country. Depending on the country you want to go to, you might need to get a trip pass first. In this story, we will talk about how to ask for a trip pass and what you need to get one.\n\n## Part 2: How to Ask\n\nThe first thing you need to do when asking for a trip pass is to find out what you need for the country you want to go to. Every place has different rules about travels, so it's important to look at the official website of the place. Once you know all the needed things, you can start filling out the form.\n\n## Big Idea 3: Things You Need\n\nTo apply for travel, you will need to give some things. These might be:\n\n1. A real passport: Your passport must be real for at least six months after your planned stay.\n2. A filled out travel form: This form will ask for your name, travel ideas, and other important details.\n3. A picture: Many places need a new photo of you as part of the travel form.\n4. Proof of money: You may need to give bank papers or other proof that shows you have enough money for your trip.\n5. A letter of invite: If you are visiting family or friends, they may need to give a letter inviting you to their place.\n6. Travel plan: You may need to give a copy of your flight plan or other travel ideas.\n7. Health and travel help: Some places need visitors to have health and travel help.\n\n## Big Idea 4: The Talk\n\nAfter giving your form and needed things, you may be called for a talk at the place. During the talk, a person will ask you questions about your trip and why you want to visit the place. They may also ask about your money, ties to your home, and any past travel. Be ready to answer these questions honestly and clearly.\n\n## Big Idea 5: Paying the Fee\n\nDepending on the place, you may need to pay a fee to process your travel form. This fee can change depending on the type of travel you need and the length of your stay. Be sure to check the website for information on how to pay and fees.\n\n## Big Idea 6: Waiting for Your Travel\n\nOnce you have given your form, things, and paid the fee, all that's left to do is wait for your travel to be processed. The time this takes can change, so it's important to apply in advance of your planned travel date.\n\n## End\n\nApplying for travel can be a big job, but following the steps in this lesson can help make it easier. Remember to look up the needs for the place you plan to visit, get all needed things, get ready for the talk, and pay the right fees. With careful planning and attention to details, you can successfully get the needed travel things to see new places and cultures.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 381, "idx": 369518, "original text": "International Programs and Study Abroad. 10\u5143\u63d0\u73b0\u73b0\u91d1\u68cb\u724cArrange to have your fingerprints and background check run through the .. 10\u5143\u63d0\u73b0\u73b0\u91d1\u68cb\u724cVisa regulations differ depending on the countries.?

{"text": "Story: Learning about the Rock Repair Plan\n\nBeginning:\nThe Rock Repair Plan is a big people's program made to help families whose houses have been hurt by the presence of a special rock in the materials used to build their homes. In this story, we will learn about the current Rock Repair Plan, its problems, and ways to fix those problems.\n\nChapter 1: Learning about the Current Rock Repair Plan\n\nSubject 1: What is the Rock Repair Plan?\n- The Rock Repair Plan is a big people's program that gives money help to families whose houses have been hurt by the presence of a special rock in the materials used to build their homes.\n- The plan was made because of news of houses in DO town and MA town being hurt due to the presence of the special rock in the building blocks used in their building.\n\nSubject 2: How does the Rock Repair Plan work?\n- The Rock Repair Plan allows for up to 90% of the cost of works needed because of bad building blocks containing the special rock.\n- The plan is run by the big House, Plan, and Town Group.\n- Families who wish to get help from the plan must first have their homes looked at by a smart checker picked by the group.\n- If the checker thinks that the home needs fixing works, the family can then ask for money help under the plan.\n\nChapter 2: Problems of the Current Rock Repair Plan\n\nSubject 1: Why is the current plan not enough?\n- The current Rock Repair Plan only covers up to 90% of the cost of works needed because of bad building blocks containing the special rock.\n- This means that families may still have to pay a lot of money themselves to fix their homes.\n\nSubject 2: How many homes are hurt by the presence of the special rock?\n- Around 5 or 6 thousand homes in DO town and MA town are thought to be starting to break because of the presence of the special rock in the building blocks used in their building.\n- This means that there are a lot of families who are hurt by this problem and may need money help to fix their homes.\n\nChapter 3: Ways to Fix the Problem\n\nSubject 1: What are the ways to fix the problem?\n- One way is to make the Rock Repair Plan cover all the cost of fixing works needed.\n- Another way is to give more money to the plan to make sure that families do not have to give any money towards the cost of fixes.\n\nSubject 2: Why is it important to fix the problem?\n- It is important to fix the problem because the presence of the special rock in the building blocks used in homes in DO town and MA town has hurt these homes a lot.\n- Families who are hurt by this problem may face a lot of money problems to fix their homes, which could lead to more problems in their lives.\n\nThe End:\nIn the end, understanding the Rock Fix Plan and why it doesn't cover everything is important for fixing the problem of houses with rocks that cause trouble. If we make the plan cover all the fixing work needed or give more money, we can make sure that people who own houses don't have to pay any money for fixing. By fixing this problem, we can help make things fair and make life better for those affected by this problem.\n\nGlossary:\n- Rock: A hard thing often found in things like blocks used for building.\n- Fix: Help given by the leaders to fix a certain problem.\n- Fixing: The work of fixing or correcting a problem.\n\n[1] \"Sam's Party to start House talk on Rock fix plan\" by Sarah, The Times, late October.

{"text": "Lesson: How to Look at and Understand Pictures\n\nIntroduction:\nPictures are things we can see that help tell information or ideas. They can be found in books, paper with pictures, web places, and other places where we see things. In this lesson, we will learn how to look at and understand pictures by looking at different types of pictures and why they are used.\n\nSection 1: Types of Pictures\n\nThere are several types of pictures, including:\n\n1. Line Pictures: These are simple pictures made of lines and shapes. They can be used to show the outside shape of a thing or building.\n\n2. Paint Pictures: These pictures are made using paint and brushes. They can be used to make real-looking pictures of people, animals, or things.\n\n3. Computer Pictures: These pictures are made using computer things. They can be used to make detailed and complex pictures.\n\n4. Photo Pictures: These pictures are made using photos. They can be used to show real-life things or happenings.\n\nSection 2: Looking at Pictures\n\nTo look at and understand pictures, we need to look at them carefully. Here are some steps to follow:\n\n1. Look at the whole picture. What is the main thing? Are there any other things or people in the picture?\n\n2. Look at the details of the picture. What colors are there? Are there any patterns or textures?\n\n3. Think about the view of the picture. Is it a bird's-eye view or a worm's-eye view? Is the picture flat or does it look like it has depth?\n\n4. Think about the message or idea that the picture is trying to tell. What feelings does it make you have? What is the mood?\n\nPart 3: Real Life Examples\n\nLet's see some real life examples of how to look at and understand pictures.\n\nExample 1: A simple drawing of a house\n\nIn this picture, we can see the shape of a house. We can see the roof, walls, windows, and doors. We can also see that the house has a front yard and a backyard.\n\nExample 2: A computer made picture of a city\n\nThis picture shows a city at night. We can see the buildings with lights on against the dark sky. We can also see the traffic lights and people walking on the streets.\n\nExample 3: A real picture of a beach\n\nThis picture shows a beach during sunset. We can see the waves hitting the shore, the palm trees moving in the wind, and people relaxing on the sand.\n\nIn the end:\n\nTo finish, pictures are an important way to talk that can show information or ideas in a way we can see. By learning how to look at and understand pictures, we can get better at understanding and thinking about them. We can also use these skills for other things we can see, like movies, TV shows, and video games.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 1011, "idx": 389378, "original text": "Illustrations. $400 Fixed Price. architectural drawing for small Home build.

{"text": "Lesson: Fair Promises\n\nIntroduction:\nIn this lesson, we will learn about the idea of fair promises. We will talk about what it means to have a fair promise, how it is made, and when we can trust it. We will also look at some stories and talk about why this idea is important.\n\nSection 1: What is a Fair Promise?\n\nA fair promise is when someone believes something because of what someone else told them. This promise is fair if it makes sense for the person to believe it.\n\nMaking a Fair Promise:\n\nFair promises can happen in many situations, but they usually happen when someone makes a promise to another person. For example, if a person tells another person that they can keep their toy, even if they need it for a game, the other person might believe that they can keep their toy.\n\nWhen Can a Fair Promise Be Trusted?\n\nA fair promise can be trusted if it makes sense for the person to believe it. But, it's important to remember that not all promises can be trusted. For a promise to be trusted, it must be clear, and the person who made the promise must not change their mind for no good reason.\n\nSection 2: Stories About Fair Promises\n\nStory 1: A person is told by someone that their toy will not be taken for a game. If the toy is taken later, the person might believe that their toy would not be taken.\n\nStory 2: A person applies for a job and is told that they will get the job if they do well in the interview. If they do well but don't get the job, the person might believe that they would get the job.\n\nStory 3: A child is told by their teacher that they will pass the year if they finish all their homework. If the teacher changes the rules and doesn't let the child pass, the child might believe that they would pass.\n\nSection 3: Why are Fair Promises Important?\n\nFair promises are important because they help protect people from unfair things. By making sure that people are fair and reasonable, fair promises help us trust each other and believe in fairness.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn short, a fair promise is an idea that protects people from unfair things. This talks about the idea of being fair and nice to everyone. It is important to make sure that everyone is treated in a good way by those who make rules. By understanding the idea of fair hope, we can know why this idea is important and how it helps to protect everyone's rights.\n\nWords to remember:\n\n- Fair Hope: This is an idea that a person has because they believe those who make rules will be fair.\n- Rule Makers: A group or person who has the power to make rules and make sure everyone follows them.\n- Going back on a promise: This means to not keep a promise someone made.\n- Can be made sure: This means something can be made to happen by using rules.\n\nThings to think about:\n\nDo you think that fair hope is an important idea? Why or why not?

{"text": "Lesson: The Job of the Big Helpers in PE land\n\nIntroduction:\nBig helpers play a big part in the rules of PE land. In this lesson, we will learn about the friendship between the big helpers and the leaders, and how it changes the rules of the land.\n\nSection 1: The Big Helpers and the Leaders\n\nTopic 1: The Job of the Big Helpers in PE land\n- The big helpers are very strong in PE land and have played a big part in the rules of the land since it started.\n- The big helpers have been involved in many changes, including the first change in the early years, which led to the leaving of the land's first chosen leaders.\n- The big helpers have also been involved in the leaving of several leader friends, including those of Zachary in the late 20th century and Nathan in the late 20th century.\n\nTopic 2: The Change of the Big Helpers on PE land Rules\n- The big helpers' part in rules has changed the rules of the land a lot.\n- The big helpers have been able to change big decisions, including those related to the safety and friends of the land.\n- The big helpers' part in rules has also led to a lack of knowing and clearness in the leaders.\n\nSection 2: The Friendship Between the Big Helpers and the Leaders\n\nTopic 1: The Big Helper-Leader Friendship\n- The friendship between the big helpers and the leaders is tricky and often filled with worry.\n- The big helpers see themselves as the protectors of the land's important things, while the leaders see the big helpers as a tool to be used for rule gain.\n- The big helper-leader friendship has been made more tricky by the fact that the big helpers have a big part in the land's money things.\n\nTopic 2: The Job of the Big Helpers in Safe Land\n- The big helpers play a very important part in keeping the land safe.\n- The big helpers have been involved in many fights, including the big fight of the middle 20th century and the late 20th century fight.\n- The big helpers have also been involved in fight-bad-guys work, including the work against the bad guys in the tribe areas of PE land.\n\nSection 3: The Future of the Big Helpers in PE land Rules\n\nTopic 1: The Chance for More Big Helper Changes in Rules\n- There is a chance that the big helpers could be more involved in PE land rules in the future.\n- The big helpers may feel that they need to step in to stop more worry or to protect their things.\n- However, more big helper changes in rules could have big changes for the land's rule by all.\n\nTopic 2: The Importance of Leader Control Over the Big Helpers\n- It is very important that the leader friends keep control over the big helpers to make sure that the land stays a rule by all.\n- The big helpers should be answerable to the leader friends and should not be allowed to act on their own.\n- The leaders should also take steps to make sure that the big helpers are not involved in rules.\n\nConclusion:\nThe big helpers play a big part in PE land rules, but it is very important that the leader friends keep control over the big helpers to make sure that the land stays a rule by all. The big helpers should be answerable to the leader friends and should not be allowed to act on their own. The leaders should also make sure that the soldiers are not part of making rules.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Water Pipes\nWater pipes are a big part of our daily life, and it's good to know about them. We will learn about water pipes, including what they are, what they are made of, and problems we can have with them.\nHistory\nPeople have been using water pipes for a very long time. The old Romans were the first to make a big system of pipes to move water around their cities. Long ago, people didn't have good water systems in their houses. These days, having a good water system is very important. It gives us clean water and helps us get rid of waste.\n\nWhat Pipes Are Used for Water?\nDifferent kinds of pipes are used for our water. Here are some of them:\n1. Strong Metal: Strong metal pipes are tough and can handle a lot of pressure. People used them a lot until they found softer materials like Piping Stuff.\n2. Piping Stuff (PVC): Piping Stuff pipes are light, easy to put in, and don't rust. They are the most used pipes today.\n3. Copper: Copper pipes are tough and don't rust. They are used in houses that need really clean water.\n\nWater Problems\nEven though our water system is very important, it can have problems. Here are some common ones and how to fix them:\n1. Blocked Pipes: Hair, soap, or other things can block pipes. To unblock a pipe, you can use a sucker or a pipe cleaner.\n2. Leaks: Leaks can happen anywhere in your water system, from the pipes to the taps. To fix a leak, you need to find where it's coming from and fix or change the broken part.\n3. Not Enough Water: If there's not enough water, it could be because of blocked pipes or a broken pressure controller. To fix this, you need to find out what's causing it and fix or change the broken part.\n\nIn the end, our water system is very important. It gives us clean water and helps us get rid of waste.

We will talk about people who work at food places in the US to show how not giving up can help you do what you love.\n\nChapter 1: Learning About Not Giving Up\n- What is not giving up?\n- Why is it important for big goals?\n\nWhat is Not Giving Up: Not giving up means to keep trying even when things get hard. It is about being strong, staying focused, and working hard to reach a goal.\n\nWhy it is Important: Not giving up is very important for big goals. This is because there will be problems and hard times when trying to reach these goals. If we give up easily, we will not be able to reach our goals.\n\nPart 2: Stories about Not Giving Up\n- Waitresses at a diner in the US\n- Other stories about not giving up\n\nWaitresses at a Diner: The women in a book about diner waitresses in the US showed a lot of not giving up. Even though their work was hard and they did not earn a lot of money, they kept working as waitresses for many years. They did not give up, and this shows us how important it is to keep trying.\n\nOther Stories: There are many other stories about not giving up. One story is about a girl named Madison. She was hurt because she wanted all girls to go to school. Even though she was hurt and it was dangerous, Madison kept saying that girls should go to school. Her not giving up shows us why it is important to keep trying, even when things are hard.\n\nPart 3: Using Not Giving Up in Your Life\n- How can you not give up?\n- Real stories about using not giving up\n\nHow to Not Give Up: There are ways to help you not give up.

It is also good to have people around you who support you and help you stay focused.\n\nReal Stories: Think about a student who is trying to get good grades, do activities, and work a part-time job. This student can use not giving up by making specific goals for each part of their life (like studying for a certain amount of time each week), breaking big goals into small steps, and staying focused even when there are problems like being sick or having personal issues. By doing these things, the student can keep trying and reach their academic and personal goals.\n\nIn the End:\nNot giving up is a very important skill for reaching big goals.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Water Flow\n\n### Overview\nIn this lesson, we will learn about how water flows in pipes. We will start with the basic idea of water flow and then talk about different ways to understand how water behaves in pipes. By the end of this lesson, you will understand how different ways can help us know what happens when water flows in pipes.\n\n### What we will learn\n- Understand the basic idea of water flow\n- Learn about different ways to understand water flow\n- Understand how different ways can be used in different situations\n\n### What you should know before\n- Simple ideas about how fluids move\n- Simple math ideas\n\n### Section 1: Learning About Water Flow\n\nWater flow is about how fluids (like water or air) move through a pipe. The way fluids behave in pipes is explained by some rules. These rules help us understand how the fluid moves and how it touches the pipe walls.\n\n### Section 2: Different Ways to Understand Water Flow\n\nThere are several ways to understand water flow. Some of the most common ways are:\n\n1. The first way: This way explains the flow of a fluid that cannot be compressed through a round pipe. It is based on the rules that we talked about and thinks that the pipe has a constant round area.\n\n2. The second way: This way is used to understand the loss due to friction in a pipe. It considers the roughness of the pipe walls and the speed of the fluid.\n\n3. The third way: This way is used to guess the friction factor in the flow through pipes. It considers the pipe's size, length, and flow speed.\n\n4. The fourth way: This way is used to understand the change from smooth to rough flow in pipes. It considers a number, which is a measure of the balance of forces.\n\n### Section 3: Comparing Different Ways\n\nWhile all of the above ways are useful in understanding water flow, they each have their own good points and bad points. For example, the first way is only good for steady flow conditions, while the second way can be used to guess loss in both steady and unsteady flow conditions. Similarly, the third way is more accurate than the fourth way for guessing friction factors in rough flow.\n\nTo compare different ways, we can look at their accuracy and how they can be used. For example, the first way is very accurate for small pipe sizes, but becomes less accurate as the pipe size increases. On the other hand, the third way is more accurate for larger pipe sizes and higher flow speeds.\n\n### Chapter 4: The Uses of Pipe Models\n\nPipe models are used for a lot of things, like:\n\n1. Making pipe systems for places where they make chemicals, clean water, and do other big works.\n2. Guessing how liquids move in pipes when the flow changes (like smooth, rough, or changing flow).\n3. Guessing the pressure change in pipes because of rubbing.\n4.

{"text": "Lesson: How to Make a Top Ten List\n\nBeginning:\nIn this lesson, we will learn how to make a top ten list. A top ten list is a list of ten things, usually in a special order. People use these lists in books, newspapers, and on the internet to tell readers about a certain thing or group.\n\nPart 1: Why We Use a Top Ten List\n\nA top ten list is used for many reasons. It gives readers an easy way to learn about a certain thing. It also helps readers understand how important each thing on the list is. Also, a top ten list can be used to show how different things or ideas are from each other.\n\nPart 2: How to Make a Top Ten List\n\nTo make a top ten list, do these steps:\n\n1. Pick the thing or group for your list. For example, \"Top Ten Fashion Styles of This Year.\"\n2. Look up and collect information about the thing. This could mean reading articles, watching videos, or talking to people.\n3. Put the things or ideas in order of how important they are. This could mean giving them a number or using a special way of rating.\n4. Write a short story about each thing on your list. Keep it simple and short to help your friends understand why you put the thing on your list.\n5. Make your list easy to read. Use dots, numbers, or a table to show the things.\n6. Look at your list again to make sure it is right and has everything. Check for mistakes and fix them if needed.\n\nSection 3: Fun Examples\n\nLet's make a top ten list of the most liked dogs in our country.\n\n1. Big Dog\n2. Shepherd Dog\n3. Gold Dog\n4. Round Dog\n5.

{"text": "Story: The Magic Rocks and the Protein Jumble\n\n**Beginning:** In this story, we will learn about how magic rocks can change the way proteins jumble up, especially one called BL. We will see how the magic rocks Z and C can affect the way proteins come together and change their shape.\n\n**Chapter 1: Magic Knowledge**\n\n- Protein jumble is when proteins come together to make bigger groups. This can happen on its own or can be made to happen by things like heat or magic rocks.\n- Different metals can make tiny things called proteins group together in different ways. This depends on what type of metal and what type of protein it is.\n- The way a protein is folded can change how it behaves. It can be folded into shapes like twists, flat parts, or messy parts. Changes in how a protein is folded can make it more or less stable and can change how it works.\n\n**Part 2: Real Life Examples**\n\n- To see how metals make proteins group together, people can use light to see how big the groups get and how the protein is folded.\n- For a protein called beta-lactoglobulin, zinc makes it group together when it's cold compared to copper. This means that zinc and copper have different effects on the protein.\n- When it's not too hot or too cold, copper does not change how the proteins group together, but it might change how the proteins are folded and make them stick together stronger, which makes them turn into a gel.\n\n**Part 3: Questions to Think About**\n\n- Why do you think metals can make proteins group together? How might knowing this be helpful in things like medicine or making food?\n- Can you think of other proteins that might behave like beta-lactoglobulin with metals? What other things might also make proteins group together?\n\n**Words to Know:**\n\n- Protein grouping: when proteins come together to form bigger groups\n- Protein folding: how a protein's parts are folded into shapes like twists, flat parts, or messy parts\n- Light use: a way to see the size and how spread out things in a sample are\n- Vibration changes: a way to study the changes in how things move and how strong the links in a sample are\n- Gel forming: when a liquid with small parts becomes solid because of links between the parts\n\n**The End:** Knowing how metals can make proteins group together can help us understand how proteins behave under different conditions.

Kinetics investigations on aggregates growth by light scattering measurements and on secondary structure changes by FTIR absorption measurements show the different role played by the two metals during the whole process. In particular, the presence of zinc in solution promotes the formation of aggregates of BLG at a lower temperature than copper. Then, at fixed temperature, formation of a large amount of aggregates, of large dimension, is observed for Zn-BLG in shorter time; on the contrary, the presence of copper in solution does not affect the aggregation process while the secondary structure changes and the formation of different stronger intermolecular H-bonds, which probably lead to build a network of bonds that takes towards gelation. Our studies show how time evolution of aggregation process of BLG is dramatically affected by the presence of metal ions in solution and structural protein modifications are induced by different divalent metal ions.", "hash": "c4c652382624cc055600ba2ea677f5d08277809a325229166be9fee889b93d6d"}
{"text": "Lesson: Plant Care and Community Gardening\n\nIntroduction:\nIn this lesson, we will learn about plant care and community gardening. We will explore how people can take care of their garden to help nature, how to grow food all year round in a place with different weather, and how small gardens can do well. We will also play in the dirt with other students who love food and want to discover all parts of an apple pie.\n\nSection 1: Learning about Plant Care\n\nPlant care is a way to help make gardens that are good for nature and can grow lots of plants. It is based on the idea of helping nature instead of hurting it. In this part, we will learn about the story of plant care, its main ideas, and how it can be used in gardening.\n\nTheory:\nPlant care was started by two men from AU country, Benjamin and David, a long time ago. It is based on the idea that we can make gardens that look like nature, which is good for the world and can grow lots of plants.\n\nQuestion: What are the main ideas of plant care?\nAnswer: The main ideas of plant care are:\n1. Look at and learn from nature around you\n2. Catch and keep energy\n3. Get a result\n4. Check yourself and learn from what happens\n5. Use and like things that can be used again and again\n6. Make no trash\n7. Plan from big ideas to small details\n\nPractice: Let's use these ideas in a real-life example. Imagine you have a small bit of land that you want to turn into a garden that can grow lots of plants. How would you plan it using plant care ideas?\n\nSection 2: Making Good Gardens\n\nIn this part, we will learn about the different parts of a good garden. We will explore different ways of changing what plants you grow, growing more than one plant together, and making compost.\n\nTheory:\nA good garden is one that grows food without hurting the dirt or the world around it. This can be done by changing what plants you grow, growing more than one plant together, and making compost.\n\nQuestion: What does it mean to change what plants you grow?\nAnswer: Changing what plants you grow means growing different plants in different parts of a garden or field each year. This helps to keep the dirt healthy and stop too many bugs from coming.\n\nQuestion: What does it mean to grow more than one plant together?\nAnswer: Growing more than one plant together means growing different plants together in the same area. This can help to grow more food and reduce the need for chemicals.\n\nQuestion: What does it mean to make compost?\nAnswer: Making compost is the process of breaking down things like leaves and food scraps into a rich dirt. This can help to make the dirt healthier and reduce the need for chemicals.\n\nPractice: Let's plan a good garden for a small farm. What plants would you grow together? How would you change them? What ways of making compost would you use?\n\nPart 3: Growing Together\n\nIn this part, we will learn about the good things about growing plants together in a community and how we can do it. We will look at different ways of growing plants together, like community gardens and team farms.\n\nWhat we learn:\nGrowing plants together in a community is a way of farming where everyone in the community helps in planning, doing, and taking care of the farming activities. It can happen in many ways, like community gardens and team farms.\n\nQuestion: What are the good things about growing plants together in a community?\nAnswer: The good things about growing plants together in a community include getting fresh, healthy food, making the community stronger, and helping the environment.\n\nQuestion: What are some ways of growing plants together in a community?\nAnswer: Some ways of growing plants together in a community include community gardens, where people come together to grow food as a group, and team farms, where farmers work together to share tools and markets.\n\nLet's try: Let's plan a program for growing plants together for a neighborhood that needs help. What kinds of activities would you include? How would you know if it's working well?\n\nEnding:\nIn this lesson, we have learned about growing plants together and farming in a community. We have learned the rules of growing plants together, the parts of a good farming system, and the benefits of farming in a community. We also tried using these ideas for real situations. By understanding these ideas, we can work towards a better and fair food system.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 716, "idx": 138894, "original text": "Permaculture and Community Agriculture (Youth Class) Tuesday, April 17, 2018 9:00 AM 09:00 Friday, April 20, 2018 4:00 PM 16:00 GO company Calendar ICS How can landowners who want to grow food manage their land to be ecologically sustainable?

People take care of making sure everyone in a group is okay and heard when it comes to their work.\n\n### Little Story 1.2: Why is Learning Important?\nLearning is important because it gives people in the group the smarts and skills to help and support their friends. It also helps make the group strong and active at work, which can make work and jobs better and safer for everyone.\n\n### Little Story 1.3: What Do We Learn?\nWhat we learn can change based on what the group and its people need, but usually includes:\n\n- Understanding the group agreement\n- How to handle a problem\n- How to deal with punishment and losing jobs\n- How to make the group bigger and stronger\n- How to talk and lead\n- Knowing your rights as a worker\n\n## Story 2: Real Examples\n\n### Little Story 2.1: How to Solve a Problem\nLet's say a worker is not happy with their work or how the boss treats them. As a helper, you would first listen to their worries and gather any useful information. Then, you would look at the group agreement to see if the problem is talked about there. If it is, you would follow the problem-solving steps in the agreement, which might involve making a formal complaint, telling the problem to a problem-solving group, and/or meeting with the boss to fix the problem.\n\n### Little Story 2.2: How to Help a Friend With Trouble at Work\nIf a friend is in trouble at work or might lose their job, you should first make sure they know their rights under the group agreement and any rules. You should then gather any useful information about the situation, like what witnesses said or written proof. Then, you would follow the steps for handling trouble and losing jobs in the group agreement, which might involve speaking for the worker in meetings with the boss, showing proof, and/or making a complaint if needed.\n\n## Story 3: Talking to Myself\n\n### Little Story 3.1: The Role of Thinking Hard in Helping\nThinking hard is a key skill for helpers because it lets them look at situations without bias and make smart decisions that help their friends. By thinking about different views and looking at proof, helpers can find the best ways to deal with work problems and make the group strong.\n\n### Little Story 3.2: Balancing Togetherness and Individual Needs\nAs a helper, it's important to balance what the group needs with what your friends need. This means supporting the group's goals while also understanding that every worker's situation is different and might need special attention.\n\n## Word List\n- Group Agreement: A rule book between a group and a boss that says the rules and conditions of work for group members.\n- Problem: A formal worry made by a worker about a broken right under the group agreement or rules.\n- Being Good: When the boss helps a worker do better if they are not doing well.\n- Going Away: When a worker has to stop working at their job because the boss said so.\n- Joining the Team: When workers come together to join a team and do things together.\n- Getting Everyone Involved: When the team tries to get everyone to help out for the same goal.\n\nIn the End\nLearning for helpers is very important to make the team strong at work. By knowing about the rules, how to help, and how to be good, helpers can help their friends at work. This makes sure that everyone is treated well and can talk about what they think. By thinking hard and helping everyone, helpers can make work a happy place for everyone.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 332, "idx": 633673, "original text": "10 \u2013 16 May 2017.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning about Tree Care\n\n## Part 1: What is Tree Care?\nTree care is about looking after trees, plants, and shrubs in places where we live and work. It means taking care of trees around houses, streets, and other places. This includes planting trees, cutting them when needed, and taking them out. It also means finding out about and treating tree sickness and bugs.\n\n## Part 2: Why do we need to take care of Trees?\nTaking care of trees is important because trees do many good things for our world. They give us fresh air, clean the air, and give homes to animals. Trees also make our places look nice and can make homes cost more. Taking good care of trees makes sure they stay healthy and safe, and keep doing these good things.\n\n## Part 3: How do we take care of Trees?\nTaking care of trees uses both knowledge and skill. We use things we know from science, like biology, to understand how trees grow and react to their place. We use skills like cutting, planting, and taking out trees to use this knowledge in a real way.\n\n## Part 4: Who takes care of Trees?\nPeople who know a lot about trees and have special training in taking care of trees do this work. These people are called tree carers. They have certificates from big tree care groups.\n\n## Words to Remember\n- Tree care: Looking after trees, plants, and shrubs in places where we live and work.\n- Tree carer: A person who knows a lot about and takes care of trees.\n- Big tree care group: A big group that knows a lot about tree care.\n\n## Ending\nTaking care of trees is an important job that helps us look after our world and the trees that do so much for us.

What's the Light?: This part tells us about the kind of light that the toy uses, like a little light bulb, a bright light, or a LED light.\n\n6. What Color is the Light?: This part tells us about the color of the light that comes from the toy.\n\n7. Is There a Promise?: This part tells us if the people who made the toy promise that it will work for a certain time.\n\nLet's look at these ideas with the example of a Bright Adjustable LED Mommy And Baby Light Toy.\n\n1. What's the Name?: Bright Adjustable LED Mommy And Baby Light Toy\n\n2. What's it Like?: Two tall stands are attached to a round base. They reach up to two switches in the middle that can change how bright each LED light is. Coming out from the top of the switch is a bendy reading arm with a small, bright light on the end. It uses a little bit of energy and gives off lots of light. On the top of the stands is a light that faces up and can change how bright it is. It uses a little more energy and gives off lots of light. Each light gives off a warm white light.\n\n3. How Big is it?: - Height: Really Tall - Width: Not too wide\n\n4. What's it Made of?: Shiny Grey Metal\n\n5. What's the Light?: Adjustable LED\n\n6. What Color is the Light?: Warm White\n\n7. Is There a Promise?: Five Years\n\nHow Heavy is it?: Kind of Heavy\n\nLet's Talk About It\n1. What is the difference between a little light bulb and a LED light?\nAnswer: Little light bulbs make light by getting a tiny wire hot, while LED lights make light by sending electricity through a special kind of stuff. LED lights use less energy and last longer than little light bulbs.\n\n2. Why is the color of the light important?\nAnswer: The color of the light tells us what color the light from the toy is. A higher color means a colder, blue light, while a lower color means a warmer, red light.\n\nWords to Know\nStuff Used: The things used to make a toy.\nHow Big: How big and what shape a toy is.\nLight: The thing in a toy that makes light.\nColor of Light: The color of the light that comes from a toy.\nPromise: A promise that the toy will work right for a certain time.\n\nEnd\nLearning about stuff is important when getting a toy. By knowing how to look at and understand these details, we can choose the right toy. In this story, we learned how to look at and understand these details using the example of a big bright lamp. We also used these ideas in fun examples and talked to teach smart thinking.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 945, "idx": 258679, "original text": "Vitro Dimmable LED Mother And Child Lamp 3317.02.64.

Friends in our town play a big role in deciding the speed of a game. In this lesson, we will learn about friends in our town and how they change the way a game goes.\n\n**Main Thing:**\n1. What are friends in our town in a game?\n2. Why are friends in our town important for a game?\n3. How do friends in our town change the way a game goes?\n4. What things change friends in our town in a game?\n5. How can I pick the best game for my needs?\n\n**Things to Think About:**\n- Friends in our town means the ability of a toy or thing to play and have fun with other toys or things in a game.\n- In a game, friends in our town is the speed at which fun is shared between the game and the kid's toy.\n- The faster the friends in our town, the faster the game will go.\n\n**Real Examples:**\n- Let's say you have a toy shop and you have a game with a game maker that has slow friends in our town. This means that when a friend tries to play your game, the things may take longer to go, leading to a higher bounce rate and potentially losing friends.\nOn the other hand, if you keep your website with a helper who has a fast connection, your website will load quickly, giving a better time for users and maybe increasing sales.\n\n**Easy words:**\n- Bandwidth: How much stuff can go over a connection at one time.\n- Latency: How long it takes for stuff to go from one place to another over a connection.\n- Redundancy: Having more than one way to prevent stopping if something goes wrong.\n\n**Questions to think about:**\n- How important is a fast connection when choosing a helper for your website?\n- Can a slow connection impact how well your website does?\n- How can I test the connection of a helper before saying yes?\n\n**End:**\nA fast connection is important when choosing a helper for your website.

Each grain of sand is a little thing. If we add more grains, the pile gets bigger. This is like our first point. When one thing gets more of another thing, it can change.\n\nQuestion: Why do things change when Al gets dirty?\nAnswer: When Al gets dirty, it stays very close to the surface, which makes things change.\n\nStory 2: What happens when Al gets dirty\n\nWhen Al gets dirty, things change a lot. The dirtier Al gets, the more things change. This is because Al can make big changes when it gets dirty.\n\nQuestion: How does dirty Al change things?\nAnswer: When Al gets dirty, it can make big changes.\n\nStory 3: Why we need to keep Al clean\n\nAs we want smaller and stronger toys, it becomes more important to keep Al clean.

{"text": "Lesson: Why We Need to Save Money\n\nIntroduction:\nSaving money is a very important part of managing pocket money. They give us a direction, encouragement, and reason for our money. In this lesson, we will talk about why saving money is important and how it can help you reach your dreams.\n\nMain Idea:\nThe main idea of this lesson is that setting money-saving goals is very important for being good at managing money.\n\nSection 1: Ideas We Need to Understand\nTopic 1: What are Money-Saving Goals?\nMoney-saving goals are clear, measurable, doable, important, and time-limited goals that help you manage your money well. They can be from short-time goals like saving for a toy to long-time goals like saving for a big toy or a house.\n\nTopic 2: Why is it Good to Save Money?\nSaving money helps you plan for fun things. It makes you think about what you really want to buy. It also helps you not to buy things you don't need right away. When you save money, you can work hard to get things that are important to you.\n\nPart 2: Easy Examples\nTopic 1: Saving for When You're Old\nLet's say you want to stop working when you're old. To do this, you need to start saving money now. You can use a special tool to figure out how much money you need to save each month. Then, you can make a plan that includes putting money into your savings regularly.\n\nTopic 2: Paying Money You Owe\nImagine you owe $10,000 on your card. Every year, you have to pay 20% extra because you borrowed this money. If you only pay a little bit every month, it will take you over 20 years to pay everything back and cost you another $10,000. But, if you pay more money each month or put all your debts together, you can pay everything back faster and not lose so much money.\n\nPart 3: Talking to Yourself\nTopic 1: Is it Good to Have a Money Plan?\nHaving a money plan is very important for saving money. It helps you see where your money is going, find places where you can save money, and make sure you're doing what you need to do to reach your goals. Without a money plan, you might spend too much, miss chances to save, and have a hard time reaching your goals.\n\nTopic 2: Should I Buy Shares?\nBuying shares can be a good way to make more money over time. But, it can also be risky because the price of shares can go up and down a lot, and you might lose money. Before you buy shares, you need to think about how much risk you can take, what your goals are, and how long you can wait. It's always smart to talk to a money expert before you decide to buy shares.\n\nWord List:\n- When You're Old: The time when you stop working and start using the money you saved.\n- Money Plan: A plan that shows how you will spend your money on things like food, home, going places, etc.\n- Extra Money: The money you have to pay because you borrowed money.\n- Money You Owe: Money you need to give back to someone.\n\nEnd:\nSaving money is very important for doing well with money. By making clear, easy, possible, useful, and timed goals, you can focus on what's important to you and work hard to reach them. Remember to think about your money plan, ways to invest, and how much risk you can take when you make money decisions. With a good understanding of saving money and why it's important, you can take care of your money and reach your dreams.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 777, "idx": 452885, "original text": "Craig Jackson.

Doing things like running and playing often can help stop sickness, make your mind feel good, and help you live longer. In this lesson, we will talk about why moving is good for health and share easy ways to play and run more every day.\n\nPart 1: Why Moving is Good\n\nTopic 1: Playing and Running Stop Sickness\nPlaying and running can lower the chance of getting sickness like heart sickness, sugar sickness, and some bad body sickness. Doing fun things like this often can also help manage feeling worried and sad, make your mind work better, and help you sleep well.\n\nTopic 2: Mind Health and Playing\nPlaying is not only good for our bodies but also for our minds. When we play or run, our brains make a thing that makes us feel happy and calm. Playing can also help lower worry, make us feel good about ourselves, and help us bounce back from hard things.\n\nTopic 3: Living Longer\nPlaying often has been tied to living longer. Studies show that people who play or run often usually live longer than those who do not. Playing can also help slow down getting old by making muscles stronger, bones harder, and the body work better.\n\nPart 2: Easy Ways to Play More Every Day\n\nTopic 1: Small Changes Can Do Big Things\nPlaying more every day does not have to be hard. Small changes can do big things over time. For example, try going up the stairs instead of the lift, walk or ride a bike to school, or do a few sit-ups or push-ups when TV ads are on.\n\nTopic 2: Find a Fun Thing to Do\nFinding a fun thing to do is important for wanting to keep playing. Playing does not have to be boring. Try dancing, going for a long walk, swimming, or playing a game that you like. You can also play with friends or family to make it more fun and social.\n\nTopic 3: Keep Doing It\nKeep doing it when it comes to playing more every day. Try to do some kind of play every day, even if it's just for 10 minutes. Over time, you can slowly make the play harder and longer.\n\nPart 3: Examples of Play to Make You Stronger\n\nTopic 1: Body Games\nBody games are a great way to start getting stronger without any things. Here are some examples:\n- Push-ups\n- Sit-ups\n- Planks\n- Lunges\n- Jumping jacks\n\nTopic 2: Band Games\nBands are another good option for getting stronger at home.

Here are some examples:\n- Arm lifts\n- Arm stretches\n- Pushing up\n- Jumping\n- Stepping forward and back\n\nEnding:\nDoing exercise every day is important for staying healthy and happy.

{"text": "Lesson Title: Learning About Medicine: A Look at a Drug for Sickness\n\nLevel: Little Kids\n\nBeginning:\nThe medicine is a new one used to treat a sickness. It stops a bad part of the sickness and has been found to be really good at treating it. In this lesson, we will look at how it works, how good it is, and if it's easy to take with other medicine.\n\nSection 1: How it Works\nThe medicine works by stopping a bad part of the sickness, which is needed for the sickness to get worse. This part is involved in the making and letting out of new bad parts. By stopping this part, the medicine prevents the making of new bad parts, reducing the sickness in the body.\n\nSection 2: How Good it is and If it's Easy to Take\nThe medicine has been found to be really good at treating the sickness. When used with other medicine, it does really well in patients with the sickness. In addition, it does even better when used with another medicine, with or without another medicine. The medicine is hard to resist, works well during a short treatment over 12 weeks, and is as easy to take as a fake medicine.\n\nSection 3: Real Examples\nOne real example of using the medicine with other medicines is in the treatment of a patient with the sickness. In this case, the medicine would be used with other medicines for 12 weeks. The patient would take one pill of the medicine, one pill of another medicine, and one pill of another medicine every day. The patient would also be watched closely for feeling tired, feeling sick, and having a headache.\n\nSection 4: Talking to Yourself\nOne talking to yourself question could be: \"Should the medicine be used as a first treatment for patients with the sickness?\" We can talk about a way of doing something that works really well, doesn't take a lot of time, and isn't too hard to do. But there are things we need to be careful about like how this way can mix with others and how we have to watch people who are doing it very closely.\n\nTo finish:\nTo end, David is a really good thing we can use to help with a sickness. David is special because of how it works and because it works well and isn't too hard to do, which makes it a helpful thing in fighting this sickness. By learning about how David works and how well it works, helpers can make good choices about when and how to use David.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1336, "idx": 249420, "original text": "Daclatasvir: a review of its use in adult patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection.\nDaclatasvir (Daklinza\u00ae) is an inhibitor of hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A protein.

This article provides a narrative review of the efficacy and tolerability of daclatasvir in combination with other agents in the treatment of patients with chronic HCV infection and summarizes its pharmacological properties. Since daclatasvir has a different mechanism of action to other current direct-acting antivirals, it provides additive or synergistic antiviral activity when used in combination. It produces high sustained virological response rates when used in combination with peginterferon-\u03b1 plus ribavirin in patients chronically infected with HCV genotypes 1-4, and provides even higher response rates when used in an interferon-free, all-oral combination with sofosbuvir, with or without ribavirin. Daclatasvir has a moderately high genetic barrier to resistance, is effective during short-term treatment over 12 weeks and has a tolerability profile similar to that of placebo.

The Carcinogen Identification Committee (CIC) of OEHHA\u2019s Science Advisory Board serves as the State\u2019s qualified experts for rendering an opinion whether a chemical has been clearly shown through scientifically valid testing according to generally accepted principles to cause cancer. The chemicals identified by the CIC are added to the Proposition 65 list, which must be updated annually.\n\nOn May 29, 2009, the CIC considered the priority ranking of 38 chemicals of which they recommended that nine of the chemicals be placed in the High priority category. OEHHA has initially selected five of the nine chemicals for the CIC\u2019s review for possible listing under Proposition 65 and is initiating the development of hazard identification materials for these chemicals. [The remaining four chemicals will be the subject of a future public notice or notices.] The five chemicals are listed in Table 1 below.\n\n\u2022 Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and its salts and transformation and degradation precursors\n\nThese chemicals were selected using the procedure described in the document entitled: \u201cProcess for Prioritizing Chemicals for Consideration under Proposition 65 by the State\u2019s Qualified Experts,\u201d adopted in 2004, and available on the Internet at www.oehha.ca.gov\n\nOEHHA identified 38 chemicals through application of an epidemiology data screen and an animal data screen, and a preliminary toxicological evaluation of the available overall evidence of carcinogenicity, as outlined in the 2004 prioritization process. These 38 chemicals were presented and released for public comment on March 5, 2009, along with a separate listing of the relevant studies identified for each chemical. These materials were provided to the Committee and also made available on OEHHA\u2019s Web site at www.oehha.ca.gov . The Committee met to consider the materials for all 38 chemicals at a public meeting on May 29, 2009. At this meeting, the Committee advised OEHHA by majority vote that nine chemicals be given high priority consideration for preparation of hazard identification materials. The five chemicals identified in Table 1 are a subset of the nine high priority candidates. The hazard identification materials for the five chemicals will be presented at a future meeting for Committee review for possible listing of the chemical under Proposition 65. OEHHA anticipates announcing a similar request for relevant information on the remaining four chemicals at a future date.\n\nBy this notice, OEHHA is providing the public an opportunity to provide information relevant to the assessment of the evidence of carcinogenicity for any of the chemicals listed in Table 1. Relevant information includes but is not limited to: cancer bioassays, cancer epidemiological studies, genotoxicity testing, and other pertinent data on pharmacokinetics, biomarkers, and effects on biochemical and physiological processes in humans for any of the five chemicals. Interested parties or members of the public wishing to provide such information should send it to the address given below.\n\nThe publication of this notice marks the start of a 60-day data call-in period. This period will end on Tuesday, December 15, 2009. The information received during this data call-in period will be reviewed and considered by OEHHA as it prepares the cancer hazard identification materials on these chemicals. This request for information is the next step in the process described in the 2004 prioritization procedure.\n\nNotification of the availability of the hazard identification materials and of the time, date, location, and agenda of the meetings of the Carcinogen Identification Committee where these chemicals will be considered will be provided in subsequent notices published in the California Regulatory Notice Register and will also be posted on OEHHA\u2019s website. It is anticipated that the hazard identification materials will be made available for a 60-day comment period prior to the Committee meetings at which these chemicals will be considered.\n\nSubmittal of materials in electronic form is encouraged. It is requested that all hard-copy materials be submitted in triplicate.\n\nSubmissions may also be delivered in person or by courier to the above address. In order to be considered, the relevant information must be received at OEHHA (if delivered in person or sent by FAX) by 5:00 p.m. on Tuesday, December 15, 2009.", "hash": "6f431468c5f7b87fb4a609e9aa59e7dfd5246160beb9c0afd56f3af0115d4d97"}
{"text": "Story: How to Understand and Join in Sharing\n\nBeginning:\nSharing is a way of deciding where people get to pick their leaders by voting. It is made on the idea that power should not be kept in the hands of a few people or groups but should be shared among all the people. In this story, we will learn about the basics of sharing, how it works, and why it is important.\n\nPart 1: What is Sharing?\n\n**Meaning:** Sharing is a way of deciding where power is held by the people, either directly or through picked leaders.\n\n**Idea:** The idea of sharing comes from the word \"demos,\" which means \"people.\" It is based on the belief that all people are the same and should have an equal say in the choices that affect their lives.\n\n**Doing:** In sharing, people get to pick their leaders by voting. These leaders are then in charge of making and following rules that help the people.\n\nPart 2: How Does Sharing Work?\n\n**First Voting:** In sharing, people vote for people who they want to speak for them. This is done through a thing called first voting. In these votings, people vote for the people they want to represent their group in the big vote.\n\n**Big Voting:** Once the first votings are over, the people who won the pick of their group run in the big vote. In this vote, people from all groups can vote for the person they want to be their speaker.\n\n**Big House:** After the big votings, the people who were picked to speak for their areas in the big house meet to talk and pass rules. These rules are meant to help the people and make their lives better.\n\nPart 3: Why is Sharing Important?\n\n**Choice:** In sharing, people have the right to pick their leaders and have a say in the choices that affect their lives. This gives them a feeling of having and control over their lives.\n\n**Same:** Sharing believes that all people are the same and should have an equal say in the choices that affect their lives. This means that everyone's voice is heard, no matter how big or small they are.\n\n**Listening:** In sharing, leaders listen to the people who picked them. This means that they must listen to the people's worries and work towards finding things that help everyone.\n\nEnd:\nIn the end, sharing is an important way of deciding that gives people the power to pick their leaders and have a say in the choices that affect their lives. By understanding the basics of sharing, we can join more in our group and work towards making a better future for ourselves and future kids.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 735, "idx": 173588, "original text": "Podcast: Play in new window | Download (Duration: 1:03:35 \u2014 58.3MB) | Embed.

{"text": "Story: Learning about Changing Things\n\n**Goal:** In this story, we will learn about how things change, specially the red sauce we put on hot dogs, and how it affects how they work and look. We will also talk about why changing things is important for making medicine and learning.\n\n**What You Need to Know:** Some things about animals, what things are made of, and tiny things that make up everything.\n\n**Beginning:** There are things that make other things happen faster. They are important for many things like eating, sending messages, and making things. The red sauce we put on hot dogs is one of these things that make other things happen faster. In the past few years, more and more people are interested in knowing how changing these things can affect how they work and look.\n\n**Main Topics:**\n\n1. Making changes to helpers\n2. What happens when you change helpers\n3. Using changed helpers for good stuff \n\n**Section 1: Making Changes to Helpers**\n\nHelpers are very important. They are made in a special way. But, we can make them different by doing some things. These changes can make the helpers work better or worse.\n\n**Section 2: What Happens When You Change Helpers**\n\nIn a story we heard, a helper named \"Henry\" was changed. They used different things to change him. After the changes, Henry could still do his job very well. We checked how good Henry was at different times, and found that some changes made Henry better. We looked at Henry very carefully and saw that some parts of him were different after the changes.\n\n**Section 3: Using Changed Helpers for Good Stuff**\n\nChanging helpers can do many good things. Like, knowing how changes affect helpers can help make good things that target specific helpers.

Its effect on catalytic properties and spatial structure of the enzyme].\nEffect of chemical modification of horseradish peroxidase lysine epsilon-amino groups by propionic, butyric, valeric, succinic anhydrides and trinitrobenzolsulfonic acid (TNBS) on catalytic properties of the enzyme is investigated. All the preparations of modified peroxidase have 100% peroxidase activity for o-dianizidine at pH 7.0, which indicates the absence of lysine epsilon-amino group in the enzyme active site. pH-dependencies of modified peroxidase relative activity are studied; modification by anhydrides of monobasic acids is not found to result in changes of the relative activity pH-profile, while modification by succinic anhydride widens it. Absorption and circular dichoism spectra of native and modified peroxidase within 260--270 nm are obtained, some changes in the enzyme tertiary structure after its epsilon-amino groups modification are observed. Modification of four epsilon-amino groups by buturic and succinic anhydrides and of three epsilon-amino groups by TNBS is found to increase the regidity of protein surrounding of heme, and modification of six epsilon-amino groups by TNBS results in more unwrapped enzyme structure as compared with its native molecule.", "hash": "c0494f0cdb0dd0201dfa9b647c020985ea7b0c5c5b8225e42c25af9ea387cef4"}

{"text": "Lesson: Learning about Health Study\n\nOverview: In this lesson, we will learn about health study and why it is important for better health knowledge and caring for people. We will also look at the different parts of doing a health study, including making the study, gathering data, looking at the data, and making conclusions.\n\nSection 1: Learning about Health Study\n\nTopic 1: What is Health Study?\n- Health study is a careful look to help make health care better, stop sickness, and understand the things behind diseases.\n- It includes gathering, looking at, and understanding data to answer special questions about health and sickness.\n- The goal of health study is to find new knowledge that can be used to make patient care and public health better.\n\nTopic 2: Why Health Study is Important\n- Health study has led to big steps forward in medicine, such as making vaccines, antibiotics, and other treatments for many diseases.\n- It helps us know why diseases happen, how to stop them, and how to manage them better.\n- Health study helps make new technologies, ways, and steps that make the quality of health care services better.\n\nSection 2: Making a Health Study\n\nTopic 1: Types of Health Studies\n- Health studies can be put into different types, including watching studies, testing studies, and comparing studies.\n- Watching studies involve watching people and recording data without trying to change anything.\n- Testing studies involve changing things to test a guess.\n- Comparing studies involve comparing people with a sickness to those without it to find risk things.\n\nTopic 2: Study Designs\n- There are different types of study designs, including one-time, group, and random testing.\n- One-time studies look at the link between a risk thing and a disease at a single point in time.\n- Group studies follow a group of people over time to see who gets a disease and who does not.\n- Random testing puts people into either a treatment group or a not treatment group, and then compare the results of the two groups.\n\nSection 3: Gathering Data\n\nTopic 1: Ways to Gather Data\n- Health researchers use different ways to gather data, including asking questions, talking, physical check-ups, and lab tests.\n- Asking questions are lists that ask people about their health actions, experiences, and thoughts.\n- Talks are set chats between a researcher and a person to gather information about their health status.\n- We check how healthy we are by looking at things like how fast our heart beats and how high our blood pressure is. We also do simple tests to see inside our body.\n\nWe can also test things like our blood, pee, or even a small piece of our skin by looking at them in a special room called a lab.\n\nTopic 2: Being Nice When We Collect Information\n- People who study our health need to be very nice to us. They need to make sure we are okay with what they are doing and that they do not hurt us.\n- They also need to make sure they do not tell anyone else about our health unless we say it is okay.\n- They also need to make sure that what they learn from us is more helpful than it is harmful.\n\nSection 4: What We Learn From The Information We Collect\n\nTopic 1: Learning From Numbers\n- People who study our health use numbers to learn more about us.\n- They use these numbers to tell a story about us.\n- These numbers can tell us what is normal and what is not normal.\n- These numbers can also tell us if something is different than what we thought it would be.\n- These numbers can also show us if things change over time.\n\nTopic 2: Understanding What We Learn\n- After we look at the numbers, we need to think about what they mean.\n- We need to think about if there are other things that could be affecting the numbers.\n- We also need to think about if what we learn from one group of people can be used for another group of people.\n- We also need to tell others about what we learned in a way that they can understand.\n\nIn the end, studying our health is very important. It helps us learn more about how to take care of ourselves and others.\n\nWords to Remember:\n- Watching: This is when we just look at people and write down what we see.\n- Testing: This is when we change something to see what happens.\n- Comparing: This is when we look at people who are sick and people who are not sick to see what is different.\n- Looking at one moment: This is when we look at people at one moment in time.\n- Following: This is when we look at people over a long period of time to see what happens to them.\n- Choosing: This is when we randomly pick people to do different things and then see what happens.\n- Learning from numbers: This is when we look at numbers to see what they tell us.\n- Telling a story: This is when we use numbers to tell us what is normal and what is not.\n- Guessing: This is when we think something will happen and then see if we were right.\n- Looking for changes: This is when we look at numbers to see if things change over time.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1762, "idx": 612963, "original text": "Association of peripheral multifocal choroiditis with sarcoidosis: a study of thirty-seven patients.\nTo assess the clinical spectrum of peripheral multifocal choroiditis (PMC) and its association with sarcoidosis. Thirty-seven patients examined between November 1997 and November 2001 who met all diagnostic criteria for PMC were included in this retrospective study. Patients were assessed for the following signs of sarcoidosis: typical changes on chest radiography or computed tomography; predominantly CD4 lymphocytosis in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; elevated serum angiotensin-converting enzyme levels; elevated gallium uptake; and noncaseating granuloma on biopsy. Most of the patients were female (30 of 37; 81%) and white (30 of 37; 81%). Mean +/- SD age at onset was 57.5 +/- 18.7 years. Seven (19%) of the 37 patients had biopsy-proven sarcoidosis and 18 patients (49%) with presumed sarcoidosis met at least 2 of the above-mentioned criteria for sarcoidosis but had normal biopsy results. Twelve patients (32%) had an indeterminate diagnosis. Patients with presumed sarcoidosis did not differ from those with proven sarcoidosis as regards the above-mentioned criteria, except for noncaseating granuloma, implying that more than two-thirds of patients (predominantly whites) had underlying sarcoidosis. Most patients with positive gallium scintigraphy had increased mediastinal uptake, as described in sarcoidosis. Patients with underlying sarcoidosis had more severe visual impairment due to cystoid macular edema (CME). Weekly methotrexate (0.3 mg/kg) seemed to control CME. White patients with PMC should be considered to have sarcoidosis.

They are often used in cars, planes, and other machines that need careful control over speed and how hard they push. In this lesson, we will learn the basic ideas behind round machines, including how they are made, how they work, and what they are used for.\n\n**Section 1: Learning the Basic Ideas**\n\nA round machine has a small round part inside a bigger round part. The small part has one less tooth than the big part. This design keeps the amount of air or liquid inside the machine the same as it spins. The center of the small round part is a little bit away from the center of the big part, letting both parts spin around their own centers while staying tightly together.\n\nThe shape of the two round parts divides the space between them into separate rooms. If the rooms have air or squeezed air inside, the spinning of the small part makes this air move from one room to another. This movement makes things move, which can be used to do work.\n\n**Section 2: Learning How They Are Made and How They Work**\n\nRound machines are usually slow-to-medium speed and medium-to-high push. This means that they are made to work at fairly slow speeds while pushing really hard. The design of the machine is such that the small round part makes the big round part move, which then makes the parts of the machine that need to move, move.\n\nThe little bit away center of the small round part makes sure that the teeth of the round parts fit together just right, making a smooth and good transfer of power. The number of teeth on each round part is carefully counted to make sure that the machine works at the right speed and push.\n\n**Section 3: Where They Are Used and Examples in Real Life**\n\nRound machines are used in a lot of places, including cars, planes, and big machines. In cars, round machines are often used to move the engine's timing parts, which control the starting and stopping of the air and fuel doors. In planes, round machines might be used to make fuel pumps or liquid systems work. In big machines, round machines are often used to move belts, pumps, and other kinds of equipment.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nUnderstanding the basic ideas behind round machines is important for anyone who wants to work with these machines. By learning about how they are made, how they work, and what they are used for, we can understand better why they are important in today's tools. With this knowledge, we can use our skills to solve new problems and keep coming up with new ideas in the field of making things move.\n\n**Word List**\n\n- Keeping the same: A type of engine that pulls in and squeezes a fixed amount of air and fuel before lighting it.\n- Round machine: A type of spinning machine that uses a mix of round parts to make things move.\n- Round thing moving: A part of machine toys where one round thing doesn't line up with the other round thing.\n- Squeeze and make loud noise: A type of toy car that sucks in and squishes air before making a loud noise.\n- Twist: How much twist you give to something, often talked about in games.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 487, "idx": 385996, "original text": "A gear-within-gear motor that consists of an inner gear with one less tooth than the outer gear..

We will start by understanding what makes the value change, and then learn how to guess what will happen to the value. We will also learn how to pick the best way to guess the value and how to protect ourselves from losing too much. Lastly, we will learn about tools that can help us guess the value.\n\nPart 1: What Makes Value Change?\nThe value of things we buy can change because we can't always guess what will happen to them. This is a story about how things can change and be hard to guess what will happen next. This idea is really important when we think about how things can change quickly.\n\nChapter 2: Making Guessing Games\nTo make a new guessing game, we need to think about many things that can change, like the weather, the time, or what people like. We can use simple ideas to think about these things and make a game that matches what we know about how things can change.\n\nChapter 3: Finding the Best Game\nOnce we have made the guessing games, we need to find the game that is the best. This could be based on how well the game matches what we see happening in real life or how easy it is to play.\n\nChapter 4: Making Rules and Steps\nAfter finding the best game, we can make rules and steps for big changes. These rules and steps will help us understand what might happen next and make good choices.\n\nChapter 5: Showing New Tools\nTo help everyone play better, we will show new tools for understanding big changes. These tools will help people understand what might happen next and make good choices.\n\nEnding:\nIn this story, we have thought about how things can change quickly and made a new guessing game.

She says that a nurse replied 'Er...it's a man' when she wished her 'Happy Christmas'.\n\nIn a letter the hospital told Chantelle that the nurse thought she was a man because 'you had a full beard and were dressed in male attire'.\n\nThis has shocked Chantelle who who was wearing full make-up, wig and a red Mrs Santa Claus dress. She said she has never had a beard, even before she began her three year transition.\n\nNow the hospital has apologised and said they are keen to speak to Chantelle to see if they can 'explore how we can resolve any remaining issues she has'.\n\nChantelle said: \"I was very, very upset. I'm a transgender woman - transitioning from male to female.\n\n\"I went to visit my friend in hospital on Christmas Eve on one of the RD&E wards.\n\n\"She was in having an operation and there was a nurse in the cubicle. I said 'Happy Christmas' and the nurse replied 'Er...it's a man'. I said 'No I'm a transgender woman' and she said 'errgh'.\n\n\"I complained at first to the NHS PALS (Patient Advice and Liaison Service) and I received a comment back from the assistant head of nursing who said they apologised for saying 'Happy Christmas Sir'.\n\n\"But I appealed and made another complaint about that because they didn't speak to me or speak to my two witnesses.\n\n\"Now I have had a letter back from the deputy chief executive/chief nurse which basically says that the nurse involved has no recollection of making the comment - but again they never spoke to my two witnesses.\n\n\"They said: 'All our staff undergo equality and diversity training as standard. Any form of discrimination is unacceptable to us as an organisation. If a patient is admitted we always enquire how they wish to be addressed (Mr, Mrs or by first name)'.\n\n\"The bit of the letter that has really upset me is this bit, it says 'However when a person is visited we are advised to address the person as they are seen. In your case I understand you had a full beard and were dressed in male attire'.\"\n\nFriend Chloe Palmer. aged 20, said: \"I was with Chantelle. She had got a Mrs Claus outfit from Ann Summers and she had stockings and make-up and her hair done.\n\n\"When we were leaving Chantelle was feeling merry and said 'Happy Christmas' to the nurse who said 'Oh - it's a man'.\n\n\"I was upset because in that industry they should be used to having different kinds of people going in and out without passing judgement. I was a bit shocked.\"\n\nChantelle said if the hospital had contacted her witnesses they would all testify that she was dressed as a woman, as she has for the last three years since she began transitioning and taking female hormones.\n\nShe said: \"I am always dressed as a woman. I had full make-up. I had my hair on. I am on female hormones and do not have a beard. Even my passport shows that I am female. This second letter is even worse than the first.\n\n\"Life is difficult enough when you are trasitioning. I have had hate crimes committed against me. But I am very surprised that this is how I have been treated by the RD&E. They are usually very good and treat me properly. But this is just ridiculous.\"\n\nIn a statement from the hospital, Em Wilkinson-Brice, Deputy Chief Exec/Chief Nurse said: \u201cWe are always sorry to hear when a patient or visitor is unhappy with their experience at the RD&E.\n\n\"In this case we have investigated the complaint and apologised for any offence caused. We are keen to speak with Ms Saunders to explore how we can resolve any remaining issues she has.\n\n\u201cAll staff at the RD&E undergo equality and diversity training as standard, reflecting the importance we place on the value of inclusion and collaboration.\u201d", "hash": "d1874aa6bc20973dc226fb528e094612900386e61d6ab5520c2e4eb20f2b53dd"}
{"text": "Lesson: Introduction to Fun Codes\n\n**Objective:**\nIn this lesson, we will learn about fun codes, a tool to make fun things on computer pages. We will learn about:\n\n1. What are fun codes?\n2. Why use fun codes?\n3. Starting with fun codes\n4. Simple rules and shapes of a fun code\n5. Making decisions and loops\n6. Playing with word holders\n7. Using actions\n8. Making toys\n9. Playing with lists\n10. Handling happenings\n11. Making moves and effects\n\n**Section 1: What are Fun Codes?**\n\nFun codes are a kind of magic word language that is often used to make computer pages fun and interactive. It was first shown in the 20th century by a big company and has since become a favorite language for making web games.\n\n**Why Use Fun Codes?**\n\nThere are several reasons why fun codes are a great tool for computer game makers:\n\n1. Fun: Fun codes let you make computer pages that do things when you click or type.\n2. Helping Everyone: Fun codes can be used to make computer pages easier for everyone to use, like those who use reading helpers. Make Things Fun: You can use magic words to create fun moves and effects that make your drawing more interesting.\n4. Find Me: Magic words can help others find your drawing more easily.\n\n**Chapter 2: Setting up a magic word drawing tool**\n\nBefore we start drawing with magic words, we need to set up a tool that lets us use our magic words. There are a few different tools we can use, but the ones we like the most are Green Crayon and Red Crayon.\n\nTo set up a magic word tool with Green Crayon:\n\n1. Open Green Crayon and go to \"Controls\" by clicking on the three dots in the top right corner.\n2. Click on \"More Controls\" and then \"System\".\n3. Click on \"Magic Words\" and make sure that \"Use Magic Words\" is selected.\n\nTo set up a magic word tool with Red Crayon:\n\n1. Open Red Crayon and go to \"Settings\" by clicking on the three lines in the top right corner.\n2. Click on \"Options\" and then \"Magic Words\".\n3. Make sure that \"Use Magic Words\" is selected.\n\n**Chapter 3: How to draw with magic words**\n\nA magic word drawing usually has two parts: the magic words and the drawing that appears when you say the magic words. The magic words are written on a separate piece of paper, while the drawing appears on your drawing paper.\n\nHere's an example of a simple magic word drawing:\n\n```drawing\nThis is my paper:\nMy First Magic Word Drawing\nHello, Friends!\nMagic Words: \"myMagicWords\"\n```\n\n```magic words\n// Define a magic word called \"sayHi\"\nfunction sayHi() {\n\tdraw(\"Hi, friends!\");\n}\n\n// Call the sayHi magic word when you say it\nwhenISay(\"myMagicWords\") = sayHi;\n```\n\n**Chapter 4: Drawing tricks and loops**\n\nDrawing tricks and loops are important for making drawings that can do lots of cool things. Here are some common drawing tricks with magic words:\n\n1. If-then tricks: These are used to make different things happen in your drawing depending on if something is true or not.\n2. For loops: These are used to do something over and over again for a certain number of times.\n3. While loops: These are like for loops, but they keep going until something is true.\n\n**Chapter 5: Working with magic words**\n\nMagic words are used to remember things that you can use later in your drawing. In a language we use to tell stories to computers, we can create things called \"names\". We can also decide what those names mean. For example, we can say \"name means Jack\" or \"number means 10\". \n\nHere's how we can use these names:\n\n```story\nI have a friend named Jack.\nJack is 10 years old.\n\nI tell my friends, \"My friend's name is Jack and he is 10 years old.\"\n```\n\n**Chapter 6: Using actions**\n\nActions are things we can do over and over again. We can create an action and then use it many times. \n\nHere's how we can create an action:\n\n```story\nI can add two numbers together.\n\nI add 5 and 10 together.\nI tell my friends, \"If you add 5 and 10, you get 15.\"\n```\n\n**Chapter 7: Creating things**\n\nWe can create things with many parts. For example, we can create a friend with a name and an age, and we can even tell our friend to say hello.\n\nHere's how we can create a friend:\n\n```story\nI have a friend.\nMy friend's name is Jack.\nMy friend is 10 years old.\nMy friend can say, \"Hello, my name is Jack and I am 10 years old.\"\n\nMy friend says hello.\n```\n\n**Chapter 8: Making a list**\n\nWe can make a list of things. For example, we can make a list of fruits like apples, bananas, and oranges.\n\nHere's how we can make and use a list:\n\n```story\nI have a list of fruits. It includes an apple, a banana, and an orange.\n\nI look at each fruit in my list.\n```\n\n**Chapter 9: Doing things when something happens**\n\nSometimes, things happen, like clicking a button or writing something. We can decide what to do when these things happen.\n\nHere's how we can do something when a button is clicked:\n\n```story\nI have a button.\n\nWhen someone clicks the button, I say, \"You clicked the button!\"\n```\n\n**Chapter 10: Making things move and change**\n\nWe can make things move and change to make our stories more interesting. We can use tools to help us do this.\n\nHere's how we can make something move:\nIn the story, we learned about playing a fun game. This game is like a magic box. It can make things move, change color, and even dance! For example, we can make a square dance. It can change from red to blue, or from small to big. It can dance fast or slow, and even spin around! \n\nWe also learned how to tell a story with this game. We can make a story about a cat chasing a ball, or a bird flying in the sky. We can use our imagination to create our own fun stories.\n\nIn the end, by learning this game, we can make our stories more fun and interesting. We can share them with our friends and family. They will be surprised and happy to see our stories come to life!", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 650, "idx": 454011, "original text": "JavaScript seem to be disabled in your browser..

We can put anything in it, like toys, shapes, or even smaller boxes. We use groups in many things like counting, drawing shapes, and playing games.\n\n### Part 2: Fun Facts About Groups\nHere are some fun things we can do with groups:\n\n1. Item: An item is something we put inside our group. Like, in our group {1, 2, 3} the items are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n2. Joining Groups: If we have two groups, we can join them together to make a bigger group. Like, if we have groups A and B, we join them to make a big group that has everything from A and B.\n\n3. Same Items: If we have two groups, we can find the items that are in both of them. Like, if we have groups A and B, we find the items that are in both A and B.\n\n4. Different Items: If we have two groups, we can find the items that are in one group but not in the other. Like, if we have groups A and B, we find the items that are in A but not in B.\n\n5. Mixing Groups: If we have two groups, we can mix them to make pairs of items. Like, if we have groups A and B, we mix them to make pairs where one item is from A and one item is from B.\n\n### Part 3: Fun Things We Can Do With Groups\nWe use groups for many fun things:\n\n1. Counting: We use groups to learn about numbers.\n\n2. Drawing: We use groups to learn about shapes and how they connect.\n\n3. Guessing Games: We use groups to learn about chances and guessing.\n\n4.

A critical evaluation of Cantor's number conception is undertaken against which the interpretations by Wang and Hallett of Cantoran set theory are measured. Wang takes Cantor's theory to tend to be a theory of numbers rather than a theory of sets, while Hallett takes Cantor as proposing an ordinal theory of cardinal numbers which however permits Cantor to accept ordinal numbers as given without defining them. The evidence presented, however, shows that Cantor conceived numbers, both cardinals and ordinals, as extensional objects, and while either Wang's or Hallett's interpretations eliminate certain difficulties of Cantoran set theory, neither one of them is an accurate depiction of Cantor's theory..

{"text": "Lesson: The Value of Things We Live In\n\nIntroduction:\nThings we live in are important. They can be traded, sold, or rented to make money. In this lesson, we will talk about these things and why they are important. We will also talk about what makes them more or less important.\n\nSection 1: What are Things We Live In?\nThe things we live in are the land and anything on it like buildings, houses, or other types of places. It can be traded, sold, or rented to make money. The things we live in can be of two types: for living and for work. For living includes single houses, flats, townhouses, and apartments. For work includes office buildings, shopping places, storage places, and other types of places used for business.\n\nSection 2: What Makes Things We Live In Important?\nWhat makes the things we live in important are many things like where it is, how big it is, how good it is, and what it has. Where it is, is one of the most important things. Places in good areas with good schools, shopping places, and other good things are more important than those in less good areas. How big it is, is another important thing. Bigger places are generally more important than smaller ones because they offer more space and things. How good it is and what it has also help in making the place important. A well-kept place with modern things is likely to be more important than one that needs fixing or lacks necessary features.\n\nSection 3: How to Find Out the Importance of Things We Live In\nThere are several ways to find out how important the things we live in are, including how much someone will pay for it, how much it would cost to replace it, and how much money it can make. How much someone will pay for it is the money that a buyer is ready to pay for a place based on how things are now. How much it would cost to replace it is the money it would take to replace a place with a similar one in the same condition. How much money it can make is used to guess the importance of places that make money based on how much they can earn.\n\nSection 4: Conclusion\nThings we live in are important. They can be traded, sold, or rented to make money. What makes them important is many things, including where it is, how big it is, how good it is, and what it has. There are several ways to find out how important the things we live in are, including how much someone will pay for it, how much it would cost to replace it, and how much money it can make. Knowing these things can help you make good choices when buying, selling, or investing in things we live in.\n\nWords to know:\n- Things We Live In: Land and anything on it, such as buildings, houses, or other types of places.\n- For Living: Places used for living, such as single houses, flats, townhouses, and apartments.\n- For Work: Places used for business, such as office buildings, shopping places, storage places, and other types of places.\n- How Much Someone Will Pay For It: The money that a buyer is ready to pay for a place based on how things are now.\n- Changing Cost: How much it costs to get a thing like the one we had before.\n- Earning Way: Used to guess how much something that makes money can be worth based on how much it can earn.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 626, "idx": 405991, "original text": "Today Architectural Digest brings you high above the streets of Manhattan to the 96th floor penthouse of 432 Park Avenue, the most expensive unit in the third-tallest residential building on the planet.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Land Shapes\n\nStart:\nLand shapes are a way of breaking up the ground into different places based on how they look. In this lesson, we will learn about a place we'll call \"UB area\", a land shape part of the \"CP land\".\n\nPart 1: What is a Land Shape?\nA land shape is a way of breaking up the ground into different places based on how they look. These looks can include things like hills, rocks, weather, and plants. Land shapes help us see how different places on the ground are like or not like each other.\n\nPart 2: The UB Area\nThe UB area is a land shape part of the CP land, which is part of the bigger IP land. It is found in the east part of a place we'll call \"UT state\", east of the WM mountains and south of the UM mountains. The UB area gets water from small rivers coming from the south of the UM mountains. Many of the big rivers (SR river, CC river, RC river, LFR river, and UR river) go into the DR river which gives water to the GR river\u2014a river that gives water to the CR river.\n\nPart 3: The Looks of the UB Area\nThe UB area is a part-dry place with different looks. The top part of the area is made by the UM mountains, which have the highest point in UT state, KP mountain, with a top 13,528 feet (let's say a lot) above the ground. The bottom part of the area is flat and dry, with few plants. The weather of the UB area is part-dry, with sometimes very cold winters.\n\nPart 4: Why Learning About Land Shapes Matters\nLearning about land shapes is important because it helps us see how different places on the ground are like or not like each other. This knowing can be used to make smart choices about things like using the land, taking care of resources, and saving places. Also, land shapes can give us good information about the past and the ways of different places.\n\nEnd:\nIn this lesson, we learned about the UB area, a land shape part of the CP land. We talked about what land shapes are and how they can help us understand the ground. We also looked at the looks and weather of the UB area, and talked about why learning about land shapes matters. By using this knowing to other land shapes, we can understand better the ground and the many different places that are in it.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 6533, "idx": 480591, "original text": "Uinta Basin\n\nThe Uinta Basin (also known as the Uintah Basin) is a physiographic section of the larger Colorado Plateaus province, which in turn is part of the larger Intermontane Plateaus physiographic division. It is also a geologic structural basin in eastern Utah, east of the Wasatch Mountains and south of the Uinta Mountains. The Uinta Basin is fed by creeks and rivers flowing south from the Uinta Mountains.  Many of the principal rivers (Strawberry River, Currant Creek, Rock Creek, Lake Fork River, and Uintah River) flow into the Duchesne River which feeds the Green River\u2014a tributary of the Colorado River. The Uinta Mountains forms the northern border of the Uinta Basin. They contain the highest point in Utah, Kings Peak, with a summit 13,528 feet (4123 metres) above sea level.  \nThe climate of the Uinta Basin is semi-arid, with occasionally severe winter cold.\n\nHistory\n\nFather Escalante's expedition visited the Uinta Basin in September 1776. 1822\u20131840 French Canadian trappers \u00c9tienne Provost, Fran\u00e7ois le Clerc, and Antoine Robidoux entered the Uinta Basin by way of the Old Spanish Trail and made their fortunes by trapping the many beaver and trading with the Uintah tribe. The Northern Ute Indian Reservation was established in 1861 by presidential decree. The United States opened the reservation for homesteading by non-Native Americans in 1905. During the early decades of the twentieth century, both Native and non-Native irrigation systems were constructed\u2014the Uinta Indian Irrigation Project, the Moon Lake Project, and the Central Utah Project.\n\nCommunities\n\nThe largest community in the Utah part of the Uinta Basin is Vernal.  According to the U.S. Census, the community's population in 2010 was 9,089.  Other communities in the Utah part of the region include Duchesne, Roosevelt, Altamont, Tabiona, and a number of small unincorporated communities. The Uinta Basin is also the location of the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation, home to the Ute Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray Agency (also known as the Northern Ute Tribe). The Ute Tribe is the source of Utah's state name.\n\nLocal attractions include Dinosaur National Monument, Starvation Reservoir State Park, Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area, Raven Ridge and Fantasy Canyon.\n\nThe local economy, once based on agriculture and mining, has diversified, and energy extraction and tourism are now major industries as well.  In order to move oil out of the region, a new railroad is proposed to be constructed into the basin.  In addition, Utah State University operates Branch campuses at Vernal and Roosevelt, expanding educational opportunities in a previously underserved region of Utah.\n\nPhysiography\nThe Uinta Basin is the most northerly section of the Colorado Plateau sections. The basin is  above sea level and corresponding to this depression is a broad east-west strip of higher plateau that rises sharply above the denuded country to the south. On the south side of the plateau the descent of , to the general level of eastern Utah on the south, is made in two steps. The first is the Roan Cliffs and the second, the Book Cliffs. Eastward in Colorado the two lines of cliffs are poorly distinguished. The Green River flows southward out of the Uinta Mountains to the north, crossing the Uinta Basin, and flows in a  deep gorge known as Desolation Canyon. The Colorado River crosses the eastern portion of this section, cutting off an area of some 40 miles (64 kilometres) in diameter in which are preserved fragments of a lofty lava cap forming Grand Mesa and Battlement Mesa.\n\nGeology\nThe Uinta Basin forms a geologic structural basin, and is the source of commercial oil and gas production.  Separated from the Piceance Basin by the Douglas Creek Arch, both basins formed during the Laramide Orogeny, and are bounded by the Charleston-Nebo thrust fault, the Uinta Basin boundary fault, and the Grand Hogback monocline.  The Uinta Basin includes the Wasatch Plateau.  According to the USGS Uinta-Piceance Assessment Team, \"The black-shale facies of the Green River Formation is the main petroleum system of Tertiary age whereas the Mahogany zone of the Green River Formation is a minor component. The Cretaceous Mancos Group and equivalent rocks are the main source of Cretaceous oil and a major contributor of gas in the basin, whereas the Upper Cretaceous Mesaverde is a lesser contributor\nof oil but a significant source for gas. Ferron Sandstone coals are known to be a source of coalbed methane.\nThe most prominent source of oil from Paleozoic rocks is the Permian Phosphoria Formation.\n\nDuring the Laramide Orogeny along the Wasatch Mountains, the north-south trending coast during the Late Cretaceous was receding eastward, at the same time the area where the basin is located was subsiding, creating a lacustrine environment.  A clastic wedge consisting of the North Horn, Colton, and Wasatch was deposited northwards.  These sediments interfingered with organic-rich lacustrine clays and carbonate muds of the Green River and Flagstaff facies.  Later, deposits originated from the Uinta Mountains from the north, forming a southward-thinning clastic wedge.  A carbonate sediment consisting of an organic-rich oil shale was deposited from the middle Eocene into the Oligocene.  The basin is also known for solid-hydrocarbon-filled fractures consisting of ozocerite, gilsonite, and wurtzilite.\n\nIn 1948, oil was discovered in the Paleozoic portion of the basin at Ashley Valley.  Tertiary discoveries followed in 1948 at Roosevelt, and then the Red Wash Field and Duchesne Field in 1951.  The Bluebell Field was discovered in 1967 and the Altamont Field in 1970.  The Altamont-Bluebell structural trap occurs where the Wasatch sandstone pinches out.\n\nSee also\n Billie Untermann\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Utah -- Place.

{"text": "Lesson: How to Help a Big Group\n\n## Start\n\nIn our world, many groups need money to work well. But, not all groups ask for help or use strong ways to get money. In this lesson, we will learn how a big group gets money without asking for help or using strong ways. We will also look at the good ways of giving and getting.\n\n## Part 1: Knowing the Group\n\nThe big group we will be talking about is the Christian Group of Jack's Friends. This group is known for its quiet and nice way of getting money. Instead of asking for help or having big events, the group works with people who want to give, without being forced or asked.\n\n## Part 2: Good Ways of Giving\n\nIn the Big Book, we can find many parts that teach us about giving and getting. For example, in a part of the Big Book, we read, \"Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.\" This part shows the importance of giving happily and freely, without any pressure.\n\nAlso, Jesus taught us the importance of giving in another part of the Big Book, where he says, \"Give, and it will be given to you. A lot, pressed down, shaken together, running over, will be given to you.\" This part suggests that when we give a lot, we will get a lot in return.\n\n## Part 3: Real Examples\n\nNow that we understand the ways behind the Christian Group of Jack's Friends' way of getting money, let's look at some real examples. One way the group gets money is by selling books, like the Big Book and other holy books. These books are sold at the same price, meaning that the group gets back what they spent on each sale. This lets people buy these books without feeling pushed to give more than they can.\n\nAnother way the group gets money is through help from members. Members of the group give their time, skills, and things to help the group's work. This includes helping with many jobs, like giving out books or setting up events for everyone. By giving their things, members help make sure that the group can keep working without asking for money from outside.\n\n## Part 4: Talking to Yourself\n\nNow let's talk to ourselves. Imagine you are a member of the Christian Group of Jack's Friends. How would you answer if someone asked you how the group gets money without asking for help or using strong ways? What good ways would you talk about to support the group's way of getting money? Finally, how would you explain the real examples of help from members and selling books at the same price?\n\n## End\n\nIn the end, the Christian Group of Jack's Friends gets money through people who want to give, without being forced or asked. This story is about happy sharing. It tells us that if we share with a happy heart, without being pushed, it's a good thing. By giving their time and what they can do, the friends in the story help so that the group can keep doing its work well. From this story, we learn about the importance of sharing and getting, and also how the group collects things they need. By using these lessons in our own lives, we can help different groups while keeping our honesty and good values.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1865, "idx": 469052, "original text": "Excellent once again Atlantis.

{"text": "Title: Learning About Help Money for Friends\n\n## Chapter 1: Understanding Help Money\n\nHelp Money (HM) is a special gift given to older friends and their families who get a gift from the Big Group or any other group that is watched over by the Big Gift Office (BGO). It is there to help when things cost more. In this story, we will learn about Help Money and why it is important for our friends.\n\n## Chapter 2: Who Can Get Help Money\n\nTo get Help Money, a friend must meet some rules. First, they must be an older friend or a family of an older friend who gets a gift from the Big Group or any other group that is watched over by the BGO. Second, they must get a special gift. Last, they must be one of these kinds of friends:\n\n1. Friends who stopped working a long time ago and now get a special gift every month. They got more special gifts after a while.\n2. Friends who get a special gift because of a rule from the Big Group.\n\n## Chapter 3: How We Find Out Help Money\n\nHelp Money is found out as a part of the first gift. The part changes based on the kind of friend. For example, friends who stopped working a long time ago and now get a special gift every month got more special gifts after a while. They get more Help Money. On the other hand, friends who get a special gift because of a rule from the Big Group also get more Help Money.\n\n## Chapter 4: Why Help Money is Important\n\nDearness Relief is a big help for older folks and their families.

{"text": "Story: Learning About Sound Boxes\n\nLet's start:\nSound Boxes are things that change the sound of a thing or voice. They are used in songs to make new sounds, make old sounds better, or add more layers. In this story, we will learn about different kinds of Sound Boxes and how they work.\n\nPart 1: Kinds of Sound Boxes\nThere are many kinds of Sound Boxes, but we will talk about three common ones: sound swirler, sound group, and sound shaker.\n\nSound Swirler: A sound swirler makes a moving sound by letting some sounds through and stopping others. It works by splitting the sound into two paths, one of which is slowed down a little and then mixed back with the original sound. This makes a wavy sound, which can be changed by the round button.\n\nEcho: An echo makes a bigger, full sound by adding the same sound many times. It works by breaking the sound into many parts, each with a little different sound, and then putting them together to make a thick, bright sound. The round button changes how quick the sound changes.\n\nShake: Shake is a wavy-like effect that adds changes to the sound. It works by moving the sound up and down fast, making a heartbeat sound. The round button changes how quick the sound changes.\n\nPart 2: How Sound Toys Work\nSound toys work by taking the sound, changing it, and then giving out the changed sound. The sound can come from a music toy or a small microphone. The toy changes the sound using little wires and rules, and then sends the changed sound to a music box or a record toy.\n\nPart 3: Fun Examples\nLet's say you are playing with a music toy in a group. You could use a swirl toy to make a fun sounding solo, an echo toy to add more to your rhythm parts, and a shake toy to add fun to your singing.\n\nPart 4: Thinking\nWhy do you think people use sound toys? What fun do they give? Are there any not fun things about using sound toys?\n\nWords to know:\n- Swirl: A type of sound toy that makes a swoosh sound by taking out some sounds while letting other sounds to pass through.\n- Echo: A type of sound toy that makes a bigger, full sound by adding the same sound many times.\n- Shake: A type of sound toy that adds changes to the sound, making a heartbeat sound.\n\nEnd:\nIn this lesson, we learned about the different types of sound toys and how they work.

More particularly, the invention relates to improvements in apparatus for damping angular movements of at least two coaxial flywheels relative to each other.\nU.S. Pat. No. 4,274,524 to Nakane discloses a rotational torque transmission mechanism wherein a slip clutch is installed in series with a damper having a set of coil springs and a friction generating device acting in parallel with the springs. Torque which can be transmitted by the slip clutch is constant and exceeds the maximum nominal torque generated by the internal combustion engine which drives one of the flywheels. Consequently, the slip clutch yields and permits the two flywheels to turn relative to each other only when the torque which is transmitted by the engine fluctuates within a very wide range. While the patented mechanism is capable of reducing the strain upon the power train between the engine and the wheels of the motor vehicle, of contributing to the comfort of the occupant or occupants of the vehicle, and of reducing some noise, it fails to operate satisfactorily within the entire RPM range of the engine. One of the reasons is that, as mentioned above, torque which the slip clutch of the patented mechanism can transmit must considerably exceed the nominal torque which is transmitted by the engine. The patented mechanism is designed to account for tolerances in the manufacture of component parts as well as for the fact that torque which is to be transmitted is likely to vary as a result of wear and/or other parameters which change in actual use of the mechanism. Another drawback of the patented mechanism is that it transmits a substantial torque even if the engine is operated at a relatively low RPM, i.e., when the engine does not transmit a maximum torque. Consequently, the mechanism cannot filter out minor fluctuations and/or other variations of torque which is transmitted while the engine is operated at a relatively low RPM.", "hash": "1c2359483078300ce2333e9a4587e3e0438f4b7ad77d92b8e001942e06103bce"}
{"text": "\n\nLesson: About Round Things and What They're Made Of\n\n## Part 1: Saying Hello\nIn this lesson, we will learn about different round things and how they are made. We will also talk about the stuff used to make these round things and what they are like.\n\n## Part 2: Types of Round Things and How They're Made\nThere are many types of round things, like ball round things, roll round things, and needle round things. These round things are used in many different things like cars, planes, and big machines.\n\nBall round things have a lot of small balls that are put in a circle. This type of round thing is good for things that move fast and can hold heavy things. Ball round things can be made from different stuff, like metal, a hard shiny stuff, and even a light bendy stuff.\n\nRoll round things are like ball round things but use cylinder shapes instead of balls. They are good for things that need to hold very heavy things and are often used in big machines. Roll round things can be made from different stuff like metal, a shiny yellow stuff, and a light bendy stuff.\n\nNeedle round things are little round things that use long, thin shapes. They are good for things that need careful work and don't make a lot of heat. Needle round things are usually made from metal or shiny metal.\n\nHow we make round things can be different depending on what type of round thing it is. For example, ball round things are usually made by putting the balls in a circle and then keeping them there with something. Roll round things are made using things that keep the cylinder shapes in place. Needle round things are usually made using something that keeps the long thin shapes in place.\n\n## Part 3: Stuff Used to Make Round Things\nRound things are made from different stuff, each with its own special things. Some common stuff used to make round things include:\n\n1. Metal: Metal is a good choice for round things because it is strong, lasts a long time, and can be very hot. It is often used in ball round things and roll round things.\n\n2. Hard shiny stuff: Round things made from hard shiny stuff are made from stuff like silicon nitride or alumina. These round things are known for being very hard, not making a lot of heat, and lasting a long time. They are often used in things that work very well like planes and motor sports.\n\n3. Light bendy stuff: Round things made from light bendy stuff are made from stuff like nylon or polyethylene. They are light, don't cost a lot, and are good for things that don't need to hold a lot of weight. However, they don't last as long as metal round things and can't be used in very hot places.\n\n4. Brass: Brass is a mix of two things, copper and zinc. It's a good choice for roller toys because it does not get rusty and it's strong. \n\n## Words to Learn\n- Toy: A thing that lets one thing move easily over another\n- Spin line: The line that a thing spins around\n- Press fit: A way of joining two things by pressing them together\n- Plastic: A thing that we can change shape when heated\n- Soap: A thing that makes things slide easily\n- Dirt: Things that can break or stop a thing from working\n\n## The End\nIn this lesson, we learned about different types of toys and how they are made. We also talked about the things used to make toys and what these things are like. By understanding these, we can better see why toys are important in our daily lives and the hard work in making good and useful toys.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 644, "idx": 262183, "original text": "Bearings utilized in pulleys, sheaves and like rotating mechanisms may be held in position about the center or rotational axis of the mechanism in various ways.

When plastic materials are utilized in this construction, a considerable amount of material is required for strength and to prevent premature failure. In addition, separate seals and shields must be provided in the bearing to contain lubricants and to prevent the entrance of contaminating materials.", "hash": "b580667391c88c007f62ee5b364d3326e9fd0fe85655291bfc3f7e9247f77ab7"}
{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Diamonds\n\n## Part 1: Simple Ideas\n\nDiamonds are special rocks that are loved for their beauty, uniqueness, and strength. They are made up of tiny bits of stuff called carbon. These bits stick together in a special way that makes them shine. We decide how good a diamond is based on four things: how clear it is, its color, its shape, and how big it is.\n\nClearness means how many marks or spots are inside the diamond. The less spots, the clearer the diamond is.\n\nColor is about how much yellow or brown we can see in the diamond. The best diamonds look like they have no color at all.\n\nShape is about how the diamond is cut or made into a shape. A good shape will make the diamond shine brightly.\n\nSize is how big the diamond is. We measure size in something called carats. One carat is very small, about as heavy as a paperclip. Bigger diamonds are usually worth more than smaller ones.\n\n## Part 2: Fun Examples\n\nLet's pretend you have a diamond ring that you want to sell. To know how much it's worth, you would need to show it to a diamond expert. This expert would look at the diamond very closely to see how clear it is, what color it is, and what shape it is. They would also see how big it is.\n\nAfter the expert looks at your diamond, they will give you a special paper that says how good and valuable your diamond is. You can use this paper to sell your diamond to a jewelry shop or to someone else.\n\n## Part 3: Stories\n\nImagine you work in a jewelry shop and sell diamonds. You find a beautiful diamond necklace that you want to buy. But, you are not sure how good and valuable the diamonds on the necklace are.\n\nTo know the value of the diamond necklace, you would need to show it to a diamond expert. This expert would look at the diamonds very closely to see how clear they are, what color they are, and what shape they are. They would also see how big they are.\n\nAfter the expert looks at your diamonds, they will give you a special paper that says how good and valuable your diamonds are. You can use this paper to talk about a good price with the person who is selling the necklace.\n\nWords to Remember:\n- Clearness: How many marks or spots are inside the diamond.\n- Color: How much yellow or brown we can see in the diamond.\n- Shape: How the diamond is cut or made into a shape.\n- Size: How big the diamond is, measured in carats.\n\nEnding:\nKnowing about diamonds is important for anyone who works with diamonds, whether they sell them, collect them, or buy them. When we look at shiny rocks, we can tell how good they are by checking four things. When we know about these things, we can be sure we are getting good shiny rocks for a fair price.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 678, "idx": 454318, "original text": "Former Jewel / pendant silver decoration flower set with rose-cut diamonds.

{"text": "Important Thing: \nThe important thing in this story is that some things are strong and don't change easily.\n\nStory: \n**Learning about Things We Buy**\nThings we buy have special numbers. These numbers are given by the people who make or sell the things. These numbers help us know what things we have, what we are selling, and if the things are good. In this story, we will learn about these special numbers.\n\n**Chapter 1: Learning about Special Numbers**\nSpecial numbers can be numbers or letters that are only for one thing. We can give these numbers ourselves or use a computer to do it. Some things about these numbers are:\n\n- **Special**: The number should only be for one thing and not for other things.\n- **Easy to Read**: We should be able to read and understand the number easily.\n- **Strong**: The number should not change when it's hot, wet, or near some things that can change it.\n- **Doesn't Change**: The number should not change when it's near some things that can change it.\n\n**Chapter 2: Different Special Numbers**\nThere are different types of special numbers. Some types are:\n\n- **UPC**: This is a type of number we see in stores to know what things we have and what we are selling.\n- **EAN**: This is a type of number used all over the world to track things.\n- **GTIN**: This is a special number given to a thing by the person who made it.\n- **ISBN**: This is a special number for books.\n\n**Chapter 3: Examples**\nLet's look at a book with a special number 978-1-56459-732-6. The special number has 10 parts separated by dashes. Each part tells us something about the book like who made it, when it was made, and which version it is. By looking at the special number, we can learn a lot about the book.\n\n**The End**\nIn the end, special numbers are important for knowing what things we have, what we are selling, and if the things are good. Knowing about these numbers can help us when we buy or sell things. By learning these things, we can be better at knowing and managing things.\n\n**Words to Learn**\n- **UPC**: A type of special number\n- **EAN**: A type of special number\n- **GTIN**: A type of special number\n- **ISBN**: A special number for books\n\n**Talk About Problem Solving**\nWhat are some hard things that may happen when giving things special names?

{"text": "Lesson: Learning about Saving Energy\n\n**Objective:** We will learn about saving energy and why it is important for our Earth.\n\n**Grade Levels:** Preschool\n\n**Duration:** A short time\n\n**Materials:** Chalkboard, markers, paper, pencils\n\n**Introduction:** \n\nSaving energy means using less energy to do the same thing. It's important because it helps our Earth by using less energy and costs less money. Today, we will learn why saving energy is important, what things use a lot of energy, and how we can save energy.\n\n**Section 1: What Does Saving Energy Mean?**\n\nSaving energy means using less energy to do the same thing, but still doing it just as well. We can save energy by using things that don't use a lot of energy, keeping our houses warm or cool the right way, or using energy from the sun.\n\n**Activity:** Let's think about a light bulb. Old light bulbs use more energy than new LED light bulbs to make the same amount of light. If we use new LED light bulbs instead of old ones, we save energy and help our Earth.\n\n**Section 2: What Makes Us Use More or Less Energy?**\n\nThere are three big things that make us use more or less energy:\n\n1. **How we use energy at home:** This is things like turning off lights when we don't need them, using things that don't use a lot of energy, and setting the thermostat to the right temperature.\n   \n2. **Our houses:** This is things like how big our house is, how it's built, and what kind of heating we use.\n\n3. **Our families:** This is things like how much money our family has, how many people are in our family, and what our family is like.\n\n**Activity:** Let's think about a family that just moved into a new house. They can save energy by turning off lights when they don't need them, using things that don't use a lot of energy, and setting the thermostat to the right temperature. They can also keep their house warm in the right way to save money in the winter.\n\n**Section 3: How Can We Measure How Much Energy We Save?**\n\nThere are tools that can help us see how much energy we save. One tool looks at how big our house is, what kind of heating we use, and what the weather is like.\n\n**Activity:** Let's think about how we can see how much energy a house saves. The tool uses a special math problem that needs things like how warm it is inside the house in the winter, how many rooms there are, how big the house is, how warm it is outside the house in the winter, how many people live in the house, and how much money the family makes in a year.\n\n**Summary:** \n\nTo wrap up, saving energy is a good idea that helps us use less energy and save money. If we know what makes us use more energy and how to measure it, we can make better choices to save energy.\n\n**Words to Remember:**\n\n- Saving energy: Using less energy to do the same thing without making it worse.\n- Measuring tool: A way to see how much energy we are using.\n- Inside temperature: How warm it is inside during winter.\n- Rooms: How many rooms are there.\n- Size of the house: How big the house is.\n- Outside temperature: How cold it is outside during winter.\n- People in the house: How many people live there.\n- Money the family makes: How much money the family earns in a year.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. What is saving energy?\n2. What makes us use more energy?\n3. How can we see how much energy we are using?\n\n**Let's Talk About It:**\n\nDo you think saving energy is a good idea?

This story will tell you the basics of building and selling houses, like the different kinds of houses, what a person who builds houses does, and the steps to make a good house project.\n\nKinds of Houses:\nThere are many kinds of houses that can be built, like houses for families, stores, factories, and mixed houses. Family houses are for single families, big families, and apartments. Store houses are for offices, shops, and storage. Factory houses are for making things, sending things, and storing things. Mixed houses have two or more kinds of houses.\n\nWhat Does a House Builder Do?:\nA house builder is a person or group that buys land and builds or fixes houses to make money. Builders are important in the house industry because they find good places, get the money, get the needed papers, and watch the building process.\n\nSteps to Make a House Project:\n1. Buy Land: The first step to make a house project is to buy land. This means finding a good place, agreeing on a price, and getting the money.\n\n2. Make a Plan: After buying the land, the builder needs to make a plan. This includes deciding what kind of house to build, how big and what shape the building(s) should be, and what extras to add.\n\n3. Get Money: After making a plan, the builder needs to get money to pay for the project. This might mean getting money from banks or other places that lend money, as well as getting money from investors.\n\n4. Get Permits: Before making can start, the worker must get all needed papers from the town helpers. This includes papers for using the land, building papers, and any other papers needed for the special work.\n\n5. Make the Property: After getting all needed papers, making can start. This means hiring helpers, watching the making process, and making sure that the property is made the right way.\n\n6. Show and Sell the Property: After the property is finished, the worker must show and sell the property to make money. This might mean working with house sellers, having open houses, and telling people about the property who might want to buy or live there.\n\nThe End:\nBuying and improving property can be a good job, but it needs careful planning, looking at details, and knowing a lot about the market. By doing the steps in this lesson, people who want to improve property can do well in the job and make good projects.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 840, "idx": 267934, "original text": "About.

{"text": "Lesson: Why Trying Hard is Important to Success\n\nBeginning:\nIn this lesson, we will learn why trying hard is important to success. We will learn about Matthew, a famous hockey player and manager who helped the BO team a lot. Through his story, we will see how being determined and working hard can lead to great things.\n\nPart 1: The Life of Matthew\nMatthew was a professional hockey player and manager who played for the BO team a long time ago. He was a key player in the \"KL team\" with other famous players Woody and Bobby. In his playing time, he won two big games with the BO team in the late 20th century. After he stopped playing, he became the boss of the team and helped them win two more big games in a time long ago.\n\nPart 2: Never Giving Up is Important\nNever giving up means to keep trying to do something even when it is hard. It is important to be good at something. Matthew's life shows how never giving up can lead to big wins. Even when things were hard, like getting hurt or sad things happening, he kept trying. He worked hard to be the best he could be, and that helped him be good at the game and be a good boss.\n\nPart 3: Using Never Give Up in Our Lives\nWe can use what we learn from Matthew's life in our own lives. When things get hard or go wrong, we should keep trying and not stop trying to reach our goals. We should try to get better and learn from our mistakes. By doing this, we can win in our own way.\n\nThe End:\nTo end, Matthew's life can help us learn. His hard work and always trying led him to big wins in the game. We can use what we learn from his life in our own lives by never giving up and always trying to reach our dreams.

This talking can happen in many ways like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or cell networks. Smart cars are getting more and more liked because they offer many good things like better safety, better fuel use, and better driving fun.\n## Section 2: How do Smart Cars Work?\nSmart cars work by picking up and sending info to and from many sensors and systems inside the car. These systems include map tracking, traffic news, weather news, and help in emergencies. The info picked up is then looked at and used to give drivers info that can help them make smart choices while driving. For example, if there is a lot of traffic ahead, the car can suggest a different way to avoid the busy road.\n## Section 3: Why are Smart Cars Important?\nSmart cars are important because they offer many good things to drivers and everyone. Some of these good things include:\n- Better Safety: Smart cars can help stop accidents by giving drivers real-time info about road conditions, traffic, and weather.\n- Better Fuel Use: By watching driving habits and giving feedback on how to use fuel better, smart cars can help drivers save money on gas.\n- Better Driving Fun: Smart cars give drivers many features that can make their driving more fun, like fun systems, voice-activated controls, and real-time traffic news.\n## Section 4: Real-World Examples\nOne real-world example of a smart car is Adam's Auto system. This system uses cameras, sensors, and radar to watch the road and traffic conditions and can automatically change the car's speed and direction. Another example is Victor's Help system, which uses similar tech to help drivers stay in their lane and keep a safe distance from other cars.\n## Section 5: Conclusion\nSmart cars are changing the way we think about getting around.

In this lesson, we will learn about letters and numbers, their uses, and how to change letters between them.\n\n**Section 1: What are Letters and Numbers?**Section 1: What are Letters and Numbers?**\n\nLetters and numbers are a standard way of writing that is used all over the world. It contains letters for all major languages and symbols. Letters use numbers called points to identify each letter. There are over a lot of points in letters and numbers, which means it can represent a lot of letters.\n\n**Chapter 2: What is letter code?**\n\nLetter code is a method to write letters and symbols in a computer. It uses small sets of numbers, which makes it easy to use on most computers and toys. Letter code is very commonly used for writing letters and symbols.\n\n**Chapter 3: Changing Letters and Symbols in Letter Code**\n\nTo change letters and symbols in letter code, we need to know a special number for the letter or symbol. We can use tools like a computer program to help us find the special number of a letter or symbol. Once we have the special number, we can change it to letter code and back.\n\n**Chapter 4: Examples**\n\nLet's say we have the following picture: \ud83d\ude04. We want to find its special number and change it to letter code. Using a computer program, we can find the special number of the picture by looking at a certain spot. In this case, we would see:\n\n8984 0x263a\n\nThis means that the picture is represented by the special number 8984, and its letter code is \"\ud83d\ude04\".\n\n**Chapter 5: Summary**\n\nIn this lesson, we learned about letters and symbols and letter code, their uses, and how to change letters and symbols between them. We also saw an example of how to use a computer program to find the special number of a picture.

{"text": "Story: The Magic of Growing\n\nBeginning:\nGrowing is a strong idea that can help you increase your treasures over a long time. In this story, we will learn what growing is, how it happens, and why it's important for savers, people who invest, and people with debts.\n\nPart 1: What is Growing?\nGrowing is the process of gaining more from a treasure or savings box. When you gain more from your first treasure, you can use that to get even more. This process keeps happening, making your treasure or savings grow a lot over time.\n\nPart 2: How Does Growing Happen?\nGrowing happens by continually using the extra you get from your first treasure. The longer your treasure is kept, the more it will grow because of growing. This is because the extra you get from your treasure is added to your main treasure, which then gets even more in the future.\n\nPart 3: Why is Growing Important?\nGrowing is important because it lets your treasures get bigger over time. The longer you keep your treasure, the more it will grow because of growing. This can give a big help against things getting expensive, living costs going up, and the value of money going down. Growing can also help you reach your saving goals, like saving for when you're old or buying a house.\n\nPart 4: Examples of Growing\nLet's say you put $1,000 in a savings box that gets 5% more each year. After 10 years, your treasure will have grown to $1,678.97, thanks to growing. If you had kept the money in the box for 20 years, it would have grown to $2,689.64. That's the magic of growing!\n\nEnding:\nGrowing is a strong idea that can help you increase your treasures over a long time. By using your extra treasure, you can watch your treasures grow a lot. The longer you keep your treasure, the more it will grow because of growing. By understanding the magic of growing, you can make smart choices about your treasures and work towards reaching your saving goals.\n\nWords to Know:\n- Extra: The amount of money gained on a treasure or savings box.\n- Main Treasure: The original amount of money put into a savings box.\n- Growing Extra: Extra that is calculated not only on the main treasure but also on the extra from before.\n- Use again: To use the extra gained on a treasure or savings box to get even more.\n- A lot: Growing fast, especially at a rate that keeps going up.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 761, "idx": 133974, "original text": "The eighth wonder of the world, apparently!

{"text": "Story: Learning About Sun Power\n\n### Big Picture\nIn this story, we will learn about sun power, its good things, and how it works. We will also learn about the things that make sun panels work better and the importance of putting them up right.\n\n### Goals\n- Learn about sun power\n- Know the good things about using sun power\n- Understand how sun power panels work\n- Know what makes sun power panels work well\n- Talk about why it is important to put sun power panels in the right way\n\n### Part 1: Learning About Sun Power\n\nSun power is a kind of power that we can use again and again. It comes from the sun. It is clean, can be used over and over, and is good for the earth. We can get it by using special panels. These panels can change sunlight into power. Or we can use it to make water or air warm.\n\nGood Things About Sun Power\n- We can use it again and again\n- We don't need to use old power sources\n- It doesn't make a lot of bad air\n- It can make power bills smaller\n- It doesn't need a lot of care\n- We can put it in far away places\n\nHow Sun Power Panels Work\nSun power panels are made of special cells. These cells are made of special stuff like sand. When sunlight hits the cells, it makes tiny bits move, making power. This power is then changed into a different kind of power using a special box. This power can be used to make homes and places of work go.\n\nWhat Makes Sun Power Panels Work Well\n- Where the sun is in the sky\n- How much sunlight there is\n- How hot it is\n- Shadows from trees or buildings\n- Dirt or dust on the panels\n\nPutting Sun Power Panels in the Right Way\nIt is very important to put sun power panels in the right way for them to work well. The panels should be facing the warm direction, at a slant that is the same as the place's place on earth, and with enough room between them and any close things to avoid shadows.\n\n### Part 2: What Makes Sun Power Panels Work Well\n\nIn this part, we will talk about what makes sun power panels work well.\n\nWhere The Sun Is In The Sky\nSun power panels work best when they are straight towards the sun's light. If the panels are tilted too much, they may not get as much sunlight, while if they are tilted too little, they may get too hot.\n\nHow Much Sunlight There Is\nThe more sunlight that hits the sun power panels, the more power they will make. Cloudy days or times of day with less sunlight will make less power.\n\nHow Hot It Is\nHot days can make sun power panels not work as well. As it gets hotter, the power made by the panels gets less. This is because the tiny bits in the special stuff move faster, making less power that can be caught.\n\nShadows from Trees or Buildings\nShadows from trees or buildings can make sun power panels not work as well. Even a little bit of shadow can make the panels make up to half as much power.\n\nDirt or Dust on the Panels\nDirt or dust on the panels can make them not work as well by blocking some of the sunlight from hitting the cells. Cleaning them often is needed to make them work well.\n\n### Part 3: Putting Sun Power Panels in the Right Way\n\nIn this part, we will talk about why it is important to set up sun catchers the right way.\n\nSetting Up Angle\nSun catchers should face the south, tilted the same as the place's tilt. This makes sure they catch the most sun during the day.\n\nSpace Between Sun Catchers and Things in the Way\nThere should be enough room between the sun catchers and any close things to keep shadows away. Trees, houses, or other things can stop the sun from reaching the sun catchers, making them work less well.\n\nEnding Thoughts\nTo end, sun power is a type of power we can use over and over and it is good for the Earth. By knowing the simple things about sun power, what makes sun catchers work better or worse, and why setting them up the right way is important, we can use the sun's power for our houses and work in a way that is kind to the Earth.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 3856, "idx": 19721, "original text": "A yearlong study of eight high-performance\nhomes confirms that performance ultimately\ncomes down to household size and behavior.\n\nBy Marc rosenbauM, P.e546378\n\nRanDi BaiRD\n\nLowest production is seen at houses 2, 3 and 8, and highest at houses 5 and 6.

Abstract: Ag-based active brazing filler metals have been developed at Materion Technical Materials and are employed to join ceramic and metal/ceramic components by brazing. These active brazing alloys promote wetting of the ceramic surfaces during brazing, and obviate the costly, intermediate step of surface treatment (e.g. metallizing) of the ceramic components. Ag-Cu-Ti active brazing filler metals typically require powder metallurgy fabrication.. Roll-Bond Cladding. This paper describes an alternative manufacturing approach to make Ag-based active brazing alloys in foil form through roll-bond cladding. Clad brazing filler metals were produced at Materion Technical Materials by cold roll-bonding and further processed into thin multilayer clad foils. The differential thermal analysis and advantages of these brazing alloys are discussed.", "hash": "2eef95802c70acc63dcf8e49b57018c59279cdb368062f5f976833f4e4aa1169"}

{"text": "Story: The Goodness of Healthy Coffee\n\nStart:\nCoffee is a drink loved by many people in the world, and it is enjoyed by lots of people every day. But, not all coffee is the same, and how coffee is grown and made can change the nature and the people who grow it. In this story, we will learn about the goodness of healthy coffee and why more people are liking it.\n\nPart 1: What is Healthy Coffee?\nHealthy coffee is coffee that is grown without using bad chemicals. Instead, farmers use natural ways like changing crops, using leftovers, and using nature to control bugs to grow their crops. Healthy coffee is also usually grown in the shade, which means that the coffee plants are grown under other trees, and not in open sunlight. This helps to keep the dirt safe, use less water, and make a home for animals.\n\nSection 2: Why is Natural Coffee Important?\nNatural coffee is important for many reasons. First, natural coffee is good for the world around us because it is grown without fake stuff. These fake stuff can dirty the dirt, water, and air, and can hurt animals and people. Second, natural coffee is often grown using smart farming ways, which can help to keep the world around us safe for kids in the future. Finally, natural coffee is often better than regular coffee because it is grown in more normal ways, which can make it taste better.\n\nSection 3: How can I know if my coffee is natural?\nLook for the US Organic sign on the bag. This sign means that the coffee has been checked by the US Food Group as meeting the rules for natural making. You can also ask your coffee maker if their coffee is natural.\n\nSection 4: Where can I find natural coffee?\nNatural coffee is becoming more easy to find, and you can find it at many food stores, coffee places, and on the internet. Some well-liked brands of natural coffee include ST coffee, PE coffee, and GR Mountain.\n\nConclusion:\nIn the end, natural coffee is an important part of a safe future. By picking natural coffee, we can help farmers who are working to keep the world around us and our health safe, while also enjoying a yummy cup of coffee. So the next time you want a cup of coffee, think about picking natural and enjoy the taste and happy feeling that comes with it.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 490, "idx": 300789, "original text": "Ralphs Caf\u00e9.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning about Special Things\n\n## Section 1: Simple Ideas\n\nA special thing can help electricity move a little bit or a lot. It is used in things like small boxes, light pointers, and tiny parts inside machines. The way electricity moves in the special thing can be changed by adding tiny bits that are different. This is known as changing.\n\n## Section 2: Questions and Answers\n\n**Question:** What is the difference between a helper, a stopper, and a special thing?\n\n**Answer:** A helper lets electricity move easily, a stopper does not let electricity move, and a special thing can help electricity move a little bit or a lot.\n\n**Question:** How does changing help the way electricity moves in the special thing?\n\n**Answer:** Changing is when tiny bits that are different are added to the special thing to change the way electricity moves. When a special thing is changed with different bits, it can either help more (n-type changing) or help less (p-type changing), depending on the type of different bit added.\n\n## Section 3: What it Means and Examples\n\n**What it Means:** Gap is the difference in energy between the helper part and the stopper part in a special thing. It decides how electricity moves in the thing.\n\n**Example:** A common special thing called Silly, has a natural gap of 1.1 eV. This means that the energy needed to push an electron from the helper part to the stopper part is 1.1 electron volts (eV).\n\n## Section 4: Real Examples and What Happens in Real Life\n\n**Example:** In a small box, a little bit of electricity put into a special thing can control a much bigger bit of electricity. This is possible because the way electricity moves in the special thing can be changed by the amount of different bit added to it.\n\n**What Happens in Real Life:** Special things are used in things like phones, computers, and TVs. They are really important for changing digital signals into analog signals and the other way around, making it possible for devices to talk to each other and process information.\n\n## Word List\n\n- **Special Thing:** A thing that can help electricity move a little bit or a lot.\n- **Changing:** The process of adding tiny bits that are different to a special thing to change the way electricity moves.\n- **Gap:** The difference in energy between the helper part and the stopper part in a special thing.\n- **Natural Gap:** The natural gap of a special thing without any changing.\n\n## Ending\n\nIn this lesson, we learned about special things, what they do, and how they are used in things like phones, computers, and TVs. We also learned about changing and how it affects the way electricity moves in a special thing. By knowing about things that let electricity pass, we can use this idea to make and better things that use electricity in the future.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 700, "idx": 461861, "original text": "Intel has completed the acquisition of Altera, a provider of field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology.

{"text": "Story: Learning about Special Coins - Dark Coins (DC)\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nIn this story, we will talk about Dark Coins (DC), a special coin from the big computer world. We will learn its special features and how it can be used in computer games and other fun things. By the end of this story, you will know what special coins are and how they work.\n\n**Chapter 1: What is a Special Coin?**Chapter 1: What is a Special Coin?**\n\nA special coin is a kind of pretend money that we can only see and use on computers. It is kept safe by a special computer language. It works on a big computer network that keeps a list of all the times the special coin is used. Special coins are different from the money we use every day because no one person or group, like a bank or government, is in charge of it. Instead, a big group of people who use the special coin help keep track of it. This is a bit like a treasure hunt, and it helps make sure that the special coin is used in the right way.\n\n**Chapter 2: What is Dark Coin (DC)?**Chapter 2: What is Dark Coin (DC)?**\n\nDark Coin (DC) is a special coin from the big computer world. It is a special thing with a limited number that can be used for fun and important things. The more people use DC, the less we have of it. It can be used to do things on the big computer network, like making new special coins. It is also like a treasure chest, a bit like gold or other shiny things.\n\n**Chapter 3: How many DC do we have?**Chapter 3: How many DC do we have?**\n\nWe start with 71,000 DC. Every time someone uses DC on the big computer network, a tiny bit of DC disappears. This means that the number of DC will get smaller over time.\n\n**Chapter 4: What can we do with DC?**Chapter 4: What can we do with DC?**\n\nThe main thing we can do with DC is that anyone who wants to make a new special coin on the big computer network must use some DC to make the coin. Also, DC can be used in computer games and other fun things. For example, when game makers use DC for game things, players can actually own them and even trade them in the big computer world.\n\n**Chapter 5: How will we get DC?**Chapter 5: How will we get DC?**\n\nHalf of the Dark Coin will be given out during a big computer event. The rest will be given out during fun events and surprises (stay tuned for more fun news).\n\n**Chapter 6: How much does DC cost?**Chapter 6: How much does DC cost?**\n\nThe cost of DC is decided by how much people want it and how many are left. Right now, it is hard to tell its exact worth. But, as more people use DC and the number of DC gets smaller, it might become more valuable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn this story, we talked about Dark Coin (DC), a special coin from the big computer world. We looked at its features, how to use it, and how it can be used in games. Things like XDM are getting more and more liked as people look for new ways to trade and keep value.

{"text": "Lesson: Knowing and Managing Feelings After Stopping Happy Pills\n\nIntroduction:\nHappy pills are medicines that help people with sadness, worry, and other feelings. While these medicines can help a lot, they can also cause feelings when someone stops taking them. This lesson will teach you about these feelings, why they happen, and how to deal with them.\n\nSection 1: What are these feelings?\nThese feelings are physical and emotional signs that happen when someone stops taking happy pills. These signs can include:\n\n- Feeling like you have the flu (e.g., hot, cold, body hurts)\n- Feeling sick and throwing up\n- Feeling dizzy or having trouble with balance\n- Feeling like you are being shocked\n- Seeing things that are not there\n- Worry or feeling scared\n- Being upset or angry\n- Feeling sad or hopeless\n- Not being able to sleep or having trouble with sleep\n- Feeling tired or having no energy\n\nThese signs can be different for everyone and can last for a short or long time, depending on the type of happy pill and how the person reacts to the medicine.\n\nSection 2: Why do these feelings happen?\nThese feelings happen because the brain gets used to the happy pill. When someone stops taking the pill, the brain needs time to get used to the change and get its natural balance back. This process can take several weeks or even months, depending on the person and the specific medicine.\n\nAlso, some people may feel a \"bounce back\" effect when they stop taking happy pills. This means that the feelings of sadness or worry may come back or get stronger for a short time before getting better again. This can make it hard to know if stopping the medicine is causing the problem or if the feelings are getting worse.\n\nPart 3: What can I do if I feel bad after stopping the medicine?\nIf you feel bad after stopping the medicine, there are a few things you can do to feel better:\n\n1. Stop the medicine slowly: If you have been taking the medicine for a long time, it's important to slowly take less and less over many weeks or months, instead of stopping all at once. This can help you feel less bad and make it easier to stop the medicine.\n\n2. Talk to your doctor: Tell your doctor if you feel bad after stopping the medicine. They can help you and give you advice to make it easier.\n\n3. Think about other ways to feel better: If you are having a hard time feeling better, your doctor may suggest other ways to feel better like talking to someone, sitting quietly, or getting a special kind of massage.\n\n4. Be patient: It can be hard to feel bad, but it's important to be patient and give your body time to get used to not having the medicine.\n\nIn the end:\nKnowing how to feel better after stopping the medicine is an important part of taking care of your feelings. By learning about why you feel bad and what it feels like, you can make good choices about your treatment and work with your doctor to find the best way to feel better.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1157, "idx": 208474, "original text": "Understanding and Managing Withdrawal Syndromes After Discontinuation of Antidepressant Drugs.\nWithdrawal symptoms commonly occur during tapering and/or after discontinuation of antidepressant drugs, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.

The oppositional model of tolerance provides a pathophysiologic basis for understanding and managing withdrawal syndromes. Reintroducing the antidepressant that was initially used or switching from one antidepressant to another to suppress symptomatology, as suggested by current guidelines, may actually aggravate the state of behavioral toxicity and be detrimental in the long run. Alternative strategies that do not encompass continuation of antidepressant treatment are required, but there is currently lack of adequate research for guiding the clinical approach.

{"text": "Lesson: How to Pick the Right Oil for Your Wooden Furniture\nStart:\nWooden furniture is strong and can stay good in all kinds of weather. But, over time, the furniture may not look as nice and need some care. One way to make wooden furniture look nice again is by putting oil on it. In this lesson, we will learn about the different kinds of oil you can use for wooden furniture and how to pick the right one for you.\nKinds of Oil for Wooden Furniture:\nThere are two main kinds of oil you can use for wooden furniture - natural oil and man-made oil. Natural oil comes from plants like linseed oil, tung oil, or teak oil. Man-made oil is made by people and is usually a mix of different things. Both kinds of oil have good and bad parts.\nNatural Oil:\n- Good: Natural oil is good for the earth, safe, and can breathe.\n- Bad: It may not stay good as long as man-made oil, and you may need to put it on more often.\nMan-Made Oil:\n- Good: Man-made oil stays good longer than natural oil.\n- Bad: It may not be as good for the earth as natural oil, and it may not be able to breathe.\nHow to Pick the Right Oil for Your Wooden Furniture:\n1. Think about the kind of furniture you have: If you have wooden furniture for outside, then a stronger oil like man-made oil may be a better choice. If you have a set of indoor wooden toys, then a simple liquid may be a better choice.\n2. Think about how much care you can give: If you don't want to put liquid on often, then a more lasting liquid like pretend liquid may be a better choice.\n3. Think about nature: If you care about how the liquid affects nature, then a simple liquid may be a better choice.\nHow to do it:\n1. Make the toys very clean before putting the liquid on. Use a gentle soap and water to take away any dirt.\n2. Make the toys smooth if needed to make sure that the liquid goes in evenly.\n3. Put the liquid a lot on the toys, using a piece of cloth or brush.\n4. Move the liquid into the toys, using round movements.\n5. Let the liquid stay on the toys for a little while before taking away any extra.\nIn the end:\nTo pick the right liquid for your wooden toys depends on some things like what kind of toys you have, how much care you can give, and how you care about nature. By thinking about these things, you can pick the best liquid for your wooden toys and keep them looking nice for a long time.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 876, "idx": 382276, "original text": "best teak oil for danish furniture teak oil or teak is better for treating outdoor teak furniture.. oil for boat teak tables,before and after basics refreshing wood ,the mysterious refinishing magic that is danish oil o vintage revivals , teak table refinished vintage danish furniture best oil, how to clean teak wood furniture oil garden,applying deck doc outdoor furniture oil , danish chair first coat of oil by,brick house , teak oil wood furniture finish wax polish the, what is teak oil..

We will also find out about different kinds of happy chemicals and how they help us see in different ways.\n\nIntroduction:\nBlurry vision when looking at things far away is a common eye problem that many people have. It can happen because of different reasons like our genes, how we live, and where we live. There is a brain chemical called dopamine that plays a part in this.\n\nDopamine has special proteins called receptors that help it send signals in our nervous system. Two main types of these receptors are called D1 and D2. These two types have different effects on our body and they also play a part in how we see things.\n\nIn brown guinea pigs, scientists have found that these two types of receptors can have different effects on blurry vision. This means that dopamine can affect blurry vision in different ways depending on which type of receptor it connects to.\n\nMethod:\nTo study this, scientists used a model of blurry vision in brown guinea pigs. They made one eye of the guinea pig have blurry vision. Then, they tested the effects of things that help D1R and D2R, things that stop them, and a vehicle by giving an injection around the eye.\n\nResults:\nThe results showed that the levels of dopamine and a related substance were higher in the eyes with blurry vision compared to normal eyes. Also, scientists found that things that help D1R increased blurry vision, while things that help D2R decreased blurry vision.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, our study shows that D1R and D2R can have different effects on blurry vision in brown guinea pigs. This finding can help us understand the role of dopamine in blurry vision and may lead to new ways to treat it.\n\nWords to Know:\n- Dopamine: A brain chemical that plays a part in how we see things.\n- Dopamine receptors: Special proteins that help dopamine send signals in our nervous system.\n- Blurry vision: A type of eye problem that happens when an eye can't see clear pictures.\n- GU city pig: A small animal that scientists often use in their studies.\n- One-eye blurry vision: Blurry vision that affects only one eye.\n- Retinal: Having to do with the part of the eye that helps us see.\n- Vitreous: The clear, jelly-like thing that fills the space in our eye.\n\nChat Time:\nWhy do you think some things in our body can make our eyes better or worse?

To determine if DR control of refractive error development is different than in its normal counterpart, we evaluated the contribution of dopaminergic pathways to emmetropization and form deprivation myopia (FDM) progression in pigmented guinea pigs. Monocular myopia was induced by unilateral form-deprivation (FD). The effects of agonists of D1R (SKF38393) and D2R (quinpirole), the corresponding antagonists (SCH23390 and sulpiride), and vehicle were tested by peribulbar injection around FD or untreated control eyes. High-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection quantified retinal and vitreous dopamine (DA) and 4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels. Ocular refraction and axial dimensions were measured using eccentric infrared photoretinoscopy (EIR) and A-scan ultrasonography, respectively, initially and after 2 or 4 weeks of treatment. After treatment with any of these four agents for 2 weeks, retinal and vitreal DA and DOPAC levels were not significantly different in drug- and vehicle-treated eyes. Neither agonism nor antagonism of D1R or D2R activity affected emmetropization. In contrast, D1R activation by SKF38393 inhibited FDM progression, while D2R activation by quinpirole augmented this response. On the other hand, D2R antagonism with sulpiride slowed FDM progression while D1R antagonism with SCH23390 had no effect. In pigmented guinea pigs, D1R activation inhibited, whereas D2R activation enhanced, FDM. These results closely mirror previous findings in albino animals and offer further evidence that DA and its cognate receptors affect refractive error regulation in guinea pigs.", "hash": "4e1581cc1a5b454ac0927c36551f8188dac1a34d0b4358a2eef955cb82ab3055"}

{"text": "Lesson: Bad Behavior in the Big Church\n\nIntroduction:\nThe Big Church has had problems with bad behavior for a long time. It is a sad truth that has hurt many people. In this lesson, we will talk about the problem of bad behavior in the Big Church, including what happened, how it affected people, and what is being done to stop it.\n\nSection 1: History of Bad Behavior in the Big Church\n\nThe Big Church has a long history of bad behavior. The first known time was in a big country in the late 20th century. Since then, there have been many times it has happened all over the world.\n\nQuestion: Why do you think there was more bad behavior in the Big Church?\nAnswer: There could be many reasons why there was more bad behavior in the Big Church. One reason might be that what people think is right or wrong has changed. Another reason might be that more people are telling others when bad things happen. Also, the rules in the Church might not have been good enough to stop or deal with these bad things.\n\nSection 2: How Bad Behavior in the Big Church Has Hurt People\n\nThe bad behavior in the Big Church has hurt a lot of people. People have been hurt on the outside and the inside. The way people think about the Church has also changed, and some people don't trust it anymore.\n\nQuestion: How does the way the Church deals with bad behavior change how people think about it?\nAnswer: The way the Church deals with bad behavior can change how people think about it. If the Church does not deal with bad behavior the right way, people might not think the Church is good and they might not trust the people who are in charge.\n\nSection 3: Stopping Bad Behavior in the Big Church\n\nIn the last few years, the Big Church has tried to stop bad behavior. They have made the rules for joining the Church stricter, taught people how to know and stop bad behavior, and made it easier for people who have been hurt to tell someone.\n\nQuestion: How do you think these changes will help stop bad behavior in the Big Church in the future?\nAnswer: These changes are a good first step to stop bad behavior in the Big Church in the future. By making the rules stricter, teaching people how to stop bad behavior, and making it easier for people who have been hurt to tell someone, the Church can be a safer place. But, it is very important that these changes are done the right way and always followed to make sure they work.\n\nConclusion:\nBad behavior in the Big Church is a big problem that needs to be looked at and fixed all the time. By knowing what happened, how it hurt people, and what is being done to stop it, we can help make a safer and better place for everyone.\n\nWords to Know:\n- Big Church: A big group of people all over the world who believe in God and follow the same rules.\n- Bad behavior: Doing something that hurts someone else without their permission.\n- Problem: Something that happens that makes people upset or embarrassed.\n\nThink About It:\nWhat do you think is the biggest problem when dealing with bad touch in the CH group? Is it how the CH group thinks, the outside voices, or both? Why?", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 508, "idx": 387832, "original text": "Ending the silence on sex abuse: Vatican holds summit.

{"text": "**Story: Spotting Patterns for Feeling Good**\n\n**Start:**\n\nFeeling good tracking is a way that lets kids check on their health and happiness using small trackers. These trackers collect information about a kid's moving, heart beat, sleep time, and other important signs. The collected information can help doctors find and fix health problems, and help kids make better choices. But, one hard part in feeling good tracking is splitting tracker information into doing things and not doing things. In this story, we will learn about a pattern spotting method based on the standard deviation method and learn how to use it to understand tracker information.\n\n**Part 1: Ideas**\n\n- Spotting patterns is the process of splitting a continuous signal into different parts or chunks.\n- In feeling good tracking, spotting patterns is used to identify different types of actions, like walking, running, or resting.\n- The standard deviation method is a way of knowing how spread out the values in a dataset are from the average. It is used to measure the differences in a dataset.\n\n**Part 2: Examples**\n\nLet's say we have a dataset with tracker information from a kid's activity tracker. We want to split the information into times of activity and rest. We can use the standard deviation method to spot changes in the information. For example, when the kid is active, the tracker information will have a higher standard deviation than when they are resting. By setting a level for the standard deviation, we can split the information into two parts: one for activity and one for rest.\n\n**Part 3: Real-Life Examples**\n\nNow let's think about a real-life example where we want to use our pattern spotting method to understand tracker information from a patient with bad sleep. By splitting the information into times of sleep and wakefulness, we can calculate the patient's sleep efficiency (the percentage of time spent sleeping during the entire night). This information can be used by doctors to diagnose and treat the patient's condition.\n\n**Words to Know:**\n\n- Spotting Patterns: The process of splitting a continuous signal into different parts or chunks.\n- Standard deviation: A way of knowing how spread out the values in a dataset are from the average. It measures the differences in a dataset.\n- Tracker: A small device that detects or measures a physical property and records, indicates, or otherwise responds to it.\n- Wearable: A device designed to be worn on the body, often as jewelry or clothing accessories.\n- Present Everywhere: Present, occurring, or found everywhere.\n- Health tracking: The process of checking and understanding a kid's health and happiness using various devices and methods.\n\n**End:**\n\nIn this story, we learned about a pattern spotting method based on the standard deviation method and how it can be used to understand tracker information in feeling good tracking. We talked about easy ideas and real-life stories to show why this way works well. By learning how to divide sensor info, we can get important knowledge about a person's health and life choices, leading to better fixing of health problems, and better life choices.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 606, "idx": 160960, "original text": "Pervasive health monitoring utilizing wearable wireless sensor nodes can greatly enhance the quality of care individuals receive.

{"text": "Lesson: How to Make Power from Trees\n\nStarting:\nTrees are a good gift from nature that give us air, shadow, and beauty. But, they also can make power, which can help us use less oil and stop forest fires. In this lesson, we will learn about how power can be made from trees and the science behind this.\n\nMain Point:\nThe main point of this lesson is that trees can make power through a process called \"tree power.\" This includes putting sensors in trees that measure the change in pH between the tree and the dirt around it. When the pH balance changes, it creates a power charge that can be caught and turned into usable power.\n\nPart 1: The Science Behind Tree Power\n\nQuestion: What is the science idea behind making power from trees?\nAnswer: The science idea behind making power from trees is based on the idea of electrochemical cells. When there is a change in pH between a tree and the dirt it grows in, it creates a power charge. This charge can be measured and caught using sensors put in the tree.\n\nQuestion: How does the pH change create a power charge?\nAnswer: When the roots of a tree take in water from the dirt, they also take in food and minerals. This creates a pH change between the tree and the dirt around it. As a result, a power charge is made due to the difference in power between the tree and the ground.\n\nQuestion: Can you explain the electrochemical cell process in easier words?\nAnswer: Sure! An electrochemical cell is like a battery that makes power through a chemical change. In the case of tree power, the tree acts like a liquid, and the dirt acts like a path. When there is a change in pH between the tree and the dirt, it creates a power charge that can be caught and turned into usable power.\n\nPart 2: Putting Tree Power Sensors\n\nQuestion: How do you put sensors in trees to make power?\nAnswer: To put sensors in trees, you need to first find a good tree. Once you have found a tree, you can make a small hole into the trunk and put in the sensor. The sensor measures the pH balance between the tree and the dirt around it and makes a power charge when there is a change.\n\nQuestion: How often do you need to change the sensors?\nAnswer: The sensors usually last for some years before they need to be changed. However, this can change depending on the kind of sensor and the weather conditions where it is put.\n\nPart 3: Using Tree Power\n\nQuestion: What can tree power do?\nAnswer: Tree power can do many things. It can make light in places far from town. It can also stop fires in the forest. It can give power to tools that check if trees are sick and tell forest helpers when there might be a fire.\n\nQuestion: How does tree power stop fires in the forest?\nAnswer: Tree power stops fires in the forest by giving power to tools that check if trees are sick. If the tools see a sign of fire, they tell forest helpers. This lets the forest helpers stop a fire before it starts.\n\nConclusion:\nIn the end, tree power is a cool and new way to make power from nature. By putting tools in trees, we can use the power made when a tree and the dirt around it are not the same. This way of making power can give us clean power and stop forest fires. We hope you liked learning about tree power and what it can do.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 909, "idx": 296890, "original text": "Washington, September 23 : Researchers at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) are developing a network of sensors that may be run on electricity generated by trees, which could be used to prevent forest fires...

According to Andreas Mershin, a postdoctoral associate at the CBE, \"It's really a fairly simple phenomenon: An imbalance in pH between a tree and the soil it grows in.\". Testing of the wireless sensor network, which is being developed by Voltree Power, is slated to begin in the spring on a 10-acre plot of land provided by the Forest Service..

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Taking Pictures\n\n## Part 1: Basics\n\nIn this part, we will learn the simple rules of taking pictures, including getting the right amount of light, arranging things, and using light.\n\n### Small Part 1.1: Getting the Right Amount of Light\n\nGetting the right amount of light is how you take a picture on film or a digital thing. The three things that control getting the right amount of light are how long the camera's cover is open, the size of the hole in the lens that lets light through, and how sensitive the film or digital thing is to light.\n\n### Small Part 1.2: Arranging Things\n\nArranging things is how you place things in a picture. Good arranging is important for making a picture that looks interesting. The rule of thirds is a common way to arrange things, where the main thing is placed a little off the middle, making a more moving and balanced picture. Other ways to arrange things include lines that lead your eye, patterns, and textures.\n\n### Small Part 1.3: Using Light\n\nUsing light is a very important part of taking pictures. Good light can make the feeling and air of a picture better, while bad light can ruin a great picture. Sunlight is often the best light for taking pictures, but man-made light can also be used to make specific effects.\n\n## Part 2: Doing It\n\nIn this part, we will use the rules we learned in the previous part to practice taking pictures.\n\n### Small Part 2.1: Practicing Getting the Right Amount of Light\n\n- Set your camera to manual mode (M) and change how long the cover is open, the size of the hole, and the sensitivity to make different amounts of light.\n- Take pictures of a thing in different light (for example, inside, outside, night) and compare what you get.\n- Use a stand to make sure your pictures are not blurry when using slow cover times.\n\n### Small Part 2.2: Practicing Arranging Things\n\n- Use the rule of thirds on a scene and take many pictures with different arrangements.\n- Look for lines that lead your eye, patterns, and textures around you and take pictures that show these things.\n- Try different ways of framing, such as making things bigger or smaller, to make unique arrangements.\n\n### Small Part 2.3: Practicing Using Light\n\n- Use sunlight to make different feelings and airs in your pictures.\n- Try different kinds of man-made light (for example, room lights, flash) and see how they change your pictures.\nUse mirrors or a small light to make your picture brighter when it's a bit dark.\n\n## Part 3: Thinking Hard\n\nIn this part, we will look at and think about our picture taking.\n\n### Little part 3.1: Thinking\n\n- Which way of making the picture brighter, placing things, and using light was the best for your pictures?\n- What could you have done to make your pictures better?\n- What did you learn from taking these pictures?\n\n### Little part 3.2: Talking\n\n- Is it more important to know how to take good pictures or to have good ideas?\n- Should people who take pictures always follow the rules, or should they do something different to make their pictures special?\n- Is sunlight better for pictures than light from a lamp?\n\nWords to remember:\n- Making the picture brighter: The way to get a picture on the paper or a computer.\n- Placing things: How things are put in a picture.\n- Using light: Something very important in taking pictures that changes how a picture feels.\n\nIn the end:\nBy knowing how to make a picture brighter, how to place things, and how to use light, we can take good and interesting pictures. By trying these ways and thinking about our work, we can take better pictures and make special and exciting pictures.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 8, "len": 743, "idx": 438969, "original text": "Some are saying we\u2019ve got a lot of nerve calling ourselves the \u201cbest photography studio around\u201d..

It's good for everyone, but sometimes boys find it hard to ask for help. In this lesson, we will talk about why boys might not want to talk about feelings and the good things that happen when they do.\n\nPart 1: Why Talking About Feelings Can Be Hard for Boys\n\nTopic 1: What People Think\nOften, boys are told to be tough and not need help. This can make them feel like they shouldn't talk about feelings. Also, some people don't think it's good to talk about worries, which can stop boys from asking for help.\n\nTopic 2: Not Showing Feelings\nBoys are often told not to show their feelings or look weak. This can make it hard for them to talk about their feelings when they need to.\n\nTopic 3: Not Having Friends to Talk To\nBoys sometimes don't have friends to talk to about their worries like girls often do. This can make it harder for them to find someone to talk to.\n\nPart 2: Good Things That Happen When Boys Talk About Feelings\n\nTopic 1: Feeling Better\nTalking about feelings can help boys feel better by giving them a safe place to share their thoughts. This can make them less worried and sad.\n\nTopic 2: Getting Along Better with Others\nTalking about feelings can help boys get along better with other people. They learn how to talk better and understand why they do things.\n\nTopic 3: Feeling Happier\nWhen boys talk about their worries, they can feel happier and enjoy life more. They might feel better and have better friendships.\n\nPart 3: Helping Boys Talk About Feelings\n\nTopic 1: Talking About Worries\nBoys can talk more about their worries by sharing their stories and making it normal to talk about feelings. When they see others asking for help, they might feel okay asking for help too.\n\nTopic 2: Finding the Right Person to Talk To\nIt's important for boys to find someone they feel okay talking to, like someone who's good at helping boys.

{"text": "**Lesson: Learning to Read and Understand Important Papers**\n\n**Start:**\n\nUnderstanding important papers is a good skill for many reasons. It can help you make good choices, understand what you can do and should do, and keep yourself safe. In this lesson, we will learn how to read and understand important papers by looking at a true story.\n\n**Part 1: Understanding Difficult Words**\n\nDifficult words can be hard to understand. However, there are some simple rules that can help you understand important papers.\n\n- Use a book with word meanings to find out what hard words mean.\n- Pay attention to how the paper is put together, including titles, parts, and smaller parts.\n- Look for important words, such as \"should,\" \"can,\" and \"will.\" These words tell you what the paper asks for or allows.\n- Be aware of tricky words, which are a type of words used to make important papers more hard to understand.\n\n**Part 2: Looking at a True Story**\n\nLet's look at a true story to learn how to read and understand important papers. The Town Team has agreed to help the OR county Police's appeal to a big judge's order asking for the release of 1,858 people from the OR county jail.\n\n**Question 1: What is the main problem in this story?**\n\nThe main problem in this story is the big judge's order asking for the release of 1,858 people from the OR county jail.\n\n**Question 2: What does the Town Team think about this problem?**\n\nThe Town Team agrees with the OR county Police's appeal to the big judge's order.\n\n**Question 3: Why does the Town Team not want these people to be released?**\n\nThe Town Team doesn't want these people to be released because they think it will be very unsafe for OR county people, shops, and safety workers.\n\n**Part 3: Real Examples**\n\nNow let's use these ideas to a real example. Suppose you get an important paper that says:\n\n\"The first group should pay the second group $10,000 when they get a signed bill.\"\n\nWhat does this sentence mean?\n\n- \"First group\" means the person or group that must pay money.\n- \"Second group\" means the person or group that can get payment.\n- \"When they get a signed bill\" means that payment is needed only after the second group gives a signed bill.\n\n**Word List:**\n\n- Group: A person or group involved in an important agreement or argument.\n- Bill: A paper that lists the things given or done and the money needed.\n\n**End:**\n\nIn this lesson, we learned how to read and understand important papers by looking at a true story. We learned how to use easy words, understand important words, and use these ideas in real examples. By understanding easy documents, we can make smart choices, keep ourselves safe, and learn about things that we care about.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 907, "idx": 21564, "original text": "Create an Account - Increase your productivity, customize your experience, and engage in information you care about..

{"text": "Lesson: Starting a Business and Helping Others\n\n## Section 1: Introduction\nStarting a business is the process of creating and running a business. It involves finding a need, creating a thing or service to meet that need, and selling it to make money. In this lesson, we will learn about Benjamin, a soldier and Master Chocolate Maker, who started his own business, GC, and connected it with helping soldiers. We will explore how he found a need, created a thing, and helped the community.\n\n## Section 2: Finding a Need\nBenjamin noticed that many soldiers were finding it hard to join the community again after serving their country. He saw that some soldiers were sad and needed help. He decided to use his business to help these soldiers. By connecting his business with helping soldiers, he found a need in the community and found a way to make things better.\n\n## Section 3: Creating a Thing\nBenjamin is a Master Chocolate Maker, so he decided to create a thing that people would like while also helping soldiers. He opened GC in the TA area long ago and began selling chocolates. He now offers chocolate making fun classes, where students can learn how to make chocolates and help soldiers at the same time.\n\n## Section 4: Helping Others\nBenjamin gives a part of every sale to soldiers. This means that every time someone buys chocolates from GC, they are helping to support soldiers who are finding it hard to join the community again. By helping others in this way, Benjamin is making a real difference in the lives of soldiers and their families.\n\n## Section 5: Conclusion\nIn this lesson, we learned about starting a business and helping others. We saw how Benjamin found a need in the community and created a thing that helped soldiers. We also learned how he helps by giving a part of every sale to soldiers.

{"text": "Lesson: Mixing Two Types of Map Data\n\nIntroduction:\nIn map studies, we often work with two types of map data. One is like a picture with lots of little squares, and it shows things like hills, how hot or cold it is, or how many people live in a place. The other type is made up of shapes and lines that show things like roads, houses, and pieces of land. Mixing these two types of data helps us understand and show geographic information better.\n\nObjective:\nThe goal of this lesson is to teach you how to mix these two types of map data. We will learn about:\n\n1. Understanding the difference between the two types of map data\n2. Why it's important to mix the two types of map data\n3. How to mix the two types of map data\n4. Common problems and how to fix them\n5. Conclusion\n\nSection 1: Understanding the Difference Between the Two Types of Map Data\n\nOne type of map data is like a picture with lots of little squares. Each square has a value, which can be something like how high a hill is, how hot or cold it is, or how many people live in a place. The other type of data is made up of shapes and lines that show things like roads, houses, and pieces of land. These shapes and lines have things like length, area, and address.\n\nSection 2: Why It's Important to Mix the Two Types of Map Data\n\nMixing the two types of map data is important for a few reasons:\n\n1. Studying patterns: Mixing the two types of map data lets us study patterns and relationships between different types of data. For example, we can study the relationship between how many people live in a place and how the land is used.\n\n2. Showing geographic information: Mixing the two types of map data helps us make better and more interesting maps. For example, we can add colors to a map based on how many people live in a place.\n\n3. Making smart choices: Mixing the two types of map data helps people make smart choices based on geographic information. For example, city planners can use information about how many people live in a place to plan houses and roads.\n\nSection 3: How to Mix the Two Types of Map Data\n\n1. Make sure your map data is in the same format. You can use tools to change the data if you need to.\n\n2. Choose the best way to mix the data. There are two common ways:\n   a. Turning the shapes and lines into a picture: This means changing the shapes and lines into a picture with lots of little squares, usually by making a new picture that has the same size as the shapes and lines and giving values to each square based on the shapes and lines.\n   b. Turning the picture into shapes and lines: This means making a new shapes and lines based on the picture. You can use tools to make polygons based on the little squares of the picture.\n\n3. Join the combined things with your own things using a shared thing like a number.\n\n4. Make sure the combined things are right and the same.\n\nPart 4: Problems and How to Fix Them\n\n1. Things not in the right place: If your things are not in the right place, you might see empty spaces or things on top of each other. To fix this, use things like a circle, crossing, or removing to make a new layer that fills in the empty spaces or takes away things on top of each other.\n\n2. Lost things: If some of your things are lost, you might need to guess or think about what they were. Use things like guessing or filling in to put back the lost things.\n\nPart 5: The End\n\nIn this lesson, we learned about why it's important to put things together in maps. We talked about the different types of things, the good things about putting them together, and the steps to do it. We also talked about problems and how to fix them when putting things together. By using these ideas, you can look at and understand places well, making good choices based on the things.", "source": "minipile", "s": 8, "len": 1425, "idx": 376460, "original text": "Q:\n\nMerging raster and vector not working\n\nI have 1 vector layer (counties) and 1 raster layer (population density).

Many abuse it. Some use it to distraction, and\nothers skillfully master it. It is a vital part of our lives, and most people understand\nthat, but never really consider the impact it has. However, in raising children,\nlanguage is one of the most often used channels a parent will have. To a\nmother\u2019s heart, language can be a precious blessing, a fundamental tool, an\nimplement of communication, and a testimony to the successful attainment of a\nlong-held goal.\nMy firstborn\u2019s first cry, his joyful, piercing squeal, and his first sentence are\nall things I\u2019ll never forget. Though these are normal events in the development of\nan infant, every mother cherishes them. They tell us our children are making\nprogress and are curious and capable. Even when the setting seems\ninappropriate, we can\u2019t help but be enthused when our child demonstrates a new\nlanguage skill. Sitting in a church service at First Baptist Church of Flat Rock, I\nwas not even thinking about my five - month old son, Jamie. He was safely\ntucked away in the nursery, but when he began to squeal, I was instantly aware\nthat he was delighting in his newfound verbal ability. Everyone in the\ncongregation heard him, of course, and was amused. However, along with being\namused, I also felt a bit embarrassed, and a bit proud. My son\u2019s potential for\nlanguage development was obvious to all. Months later, Jamie was gracious\nenough to once again include the church family, when he uttered his first\nsentence. After the service one evening, I visited with friends while holding Jamie\nin my arms. Watching his father leave the room, Jamie quietly asked, \u201cWhere\nDaddy go?\u201d This time, there was nothing inappropriate about his timing, and I\nrejoiced in his new accomplishment.\nThe blessing of seeing my child develop and grow was accompanied by\nthe assurance that I would be able to influence that development with language.\nAs I spoke to my child each day, I could instill lessons of life with encouragement,\ninstruction, and, even discipline. I could teach him how his use of language\nreveals many things about himself, often giving others their first impression of him.\nMy children have learned these lessons, and I am encouraged to see that my son,\nGarry, is giving them a high priority as he raises his own children. When I talk to\nmy six year old grandson, Joshua, on the phone, and he responds to my\nquestions with \u201cYes, Ma\u2019am\u201d, I know that he is learning desirable character\nqualities like respect for his elders and authorities.\nJust as the way we use language communicates our attitudes to others,\nthe specific words we choose can reveal our feelings and emotions. Children who\nhear their parents telling them they are lovable, or that they are funny or smart,\nwill be ready to listen when it is necessary to deal with more challenging things. I\ntook in a young relative when she was seven years old, and one of the first\npriorities I established with her was to frequently tell her that I loved her. I also\nhad many occasions to tell Amber that I was upset with her, or that I was proud of\nher, or that something she had done was amusing. She soon learned to share\nher feelings and emotions with me, and eventually a relationship was established.\nOnce established, it was maintained by sincere communication. Communication\nand relationships support each other.\nEvery child develops differently, as any mother can tell you. As it turned\nout, like their parents, none of my children were big talkers, even though their\nlanguage skills were well developed. As a child, when Garry had something to\nsay, it was generally worth listening to. Once, he told me that he had a\nstomachache and he thought he should have some ice cream to make it feel\nbetter. He said he had read that in the medical book. Skeptical, I asked him to\nshow me where it was, and he went upstairs to get the book. When I opened the\nAmerican Medical Association Medical Encyclopedia to the page he referred me\nto, there, on a slip of paper, in Garry\u2019s best handwriting, were the words, \u201cIce\ncream is good for stomach aches.\u201d\nThough they choose their words carefully, Jamie and Garry are both\nestablishing their careers in fields where language is a major aspect. What a\nsurprise, but what satisfaction for a mother\u2019s heart. Jamie, (now Jim), has just\nbegun a career as a missionary, and Garry is a linguist in the Marine Corps.\nThese choices indicate to me that the contribution of and steadfast attention to\nlanguage has produced a welcome harvest.\nLanguage has influenced my children\u2019s development in many ways. Now\nthat they are grown and out on their own, the most important words are the ones\nthey send my way, whether it is in person, on the telephone, or by E-mail. My\nmother\u2019s heart will take them any way I can get them.\n\nJim and I laughed til we cried about Garry's \"Ice Cream\" advice for stomachaches! :) This is a good article about communication in the lives of children. It makes me wonder how in the world I ever became interested in communication myself. Must have been the lack that drove me. :) Thanks for your valuable thoughts.\nLove,\nSarah", "hash": "40888a8e7bb58d044bdbfb356c834ec9c8fabbeb4ca093225fcaf46afc2d17c7"}
{"text": "**Lesson: Learning about How Things are Sold**\n\n**What we want to learn:** How selling things can help a place grow.\n\n**Part 1: Learning New Things**\n\n- Selling a thing means one person gives it to another person.\n- People sell things for many reasons, like needing money, wanting to do more things, or not wanting to do something anymore.\n- How much they sell it for depends on how well the place is doing, how much people think it's worth, and what it could do in the future.\n\n**Part 2: Questions to Think About**\n\n- Why did William want to sell his toy making place?\n- How much money does William think he will get?\n- What can the toy making place do?\n- How will selling it help William's place grow?\n\n**Part 3: Learning Some Words**\n\n- Money from selling: How much money you get when you sell something.\n- What it's worth: How much people think something is worth based on how it's doing now.\n- Growing: Ways the place could get bigger and do more things.\n\n**Part 4: Stories to Help Us Learn**\n\n- Imagine a place wants to sell its toy making part to focus on other things. They ask a bank to help them find someone to buy it and to get the best price. After a lot of talking, they agree to sell it for lots of money. The buyer is someone who also makes toys and wants to make more kinds of toys.\n- Selling it brings in lots of money, which the place uses to pay what it owes and to do more of its other things. The buyer gets the place where the toys are made, the people who make them, and the people who buy them. This lets them make more kinds of toys and sell to more people.\n\n**Part 5: Things That Happen**\n\n- A little place that makes computer things is having a hard time because bigger places are doing better. They decide to sell their place to a bigger one who can give them more things and help them do better.\n- Selling it brings in some money, which the owners use to start something new. The bigger place gets the computer things, the people who make them, and the people who buy them. This lets them sell to more people and do more different things.\n\n**Word List**\n\n- Selling toys: When one friend gives his toys or things to another friend.\n- Money received: The amount of money you get when you sell your toys or things.\n- How much it's worth: How much your toy or thing is worth based on how much people like it right now.\n- New play ideas: New ways and places to play with your toys.\n\n**The End**\n\nKnowing how selling toys works and how it changes how much money and new play ideas you have is important for anyone who wants to start sharing or trading toys. By thinking about these ideas, asking and answering questions, and using real play examples, this story helps you understand how selling toys changes things.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 818, "idx": 264011, "original text": "Wood has agreed the sale of its Terra Nova Technologies business to Cementation Americas, a business owned by Murray & Roberts Holdings..

We will learn about the steps of doing a look-over, the main parts to think about, and how to use the skills we learn from this to new problems.\n\n**Section 1: Understanding Look-overs**\n\n**Topic 1: What is a look-over?**\nA look-over is a careful check of a program or idea to see how good it is, how well it works, its impact, and how long it can last. It helps groups make smart choices about whether to keep going, change, or stop a program.\n\n**Topic 2: Why are look-overs important?**\nLook-overs are important because they give valuable information about the good things and problems of a program. This information can be used to make the program better, show that we are responsible and clear, and make smart choices about what to do in the future.\n\n**Section 2: Main Parts of a Look-over**\n\n**Topic 1: Purpose and Scope**\nThe reason we check things is to answer questions about if it's working well, if it's done in a good way, and if it can keep going. We need to know what we want to check to make sure we're looking at the right things.\n\nTopic 2: People who care\nPeople who care are people or groups that are interested in the thing we're checking. This can include people who use it, people who give money for it, people who put it in place, leaders, and people in the community. These people should be part of the checking process so that we can hear what they think and make sure the check is helpful for them.\n\nTopic 3: Ways to Collect Information\nWe can collect information using things like asking questions, talking to people, watching, and looking at papers. What way we use will depend on what we want to know, what we have to use, and if we can do it.\n\nSection 3: Kinds of Checks\n\nTopic 1: Checking While Doing\nChecking while doing is done while something is happening to give feedback on how it's going and find ways to make it better. It can be used to make changes and make things work better.\n\nTopic 2: Checking After Doing\nChecking after doing is done when something is finished to see how good it was, what it did, and if it can keep going. It gives a full look at what it did well and what was hard.\n\nSection 4: Using Checking Skills\n\nTopic 1: How to Check Something\nTo check something, do these steps:\n1.

{"text": "Title: Learning How to Tie Flies\n\n### Part 1: Saying Hello\n\nTying flies is like making art. You make pretend bugs to catch fish. In this lesson, we will learn the simple parts of tying flies. We will learn about what you need to tie flies and how to do it. We will also learn about different types of pretend bugs and how they are used to catch different fish.\n\n### Part 2: What You Need and the Tools\n\nTo start tying flies, you need these things and tools:\n\nThings:\n- Thread to tie with\n- Fluffy stuff or fur\n- Feathers\n- Hooks\n- Wire\n- Sticky stuff\n- Scissors\n- Pinchers\n- Bobbin\n- Vise\n\nTools:\n- Dungeons (to hold things)\n- Whip finisher (to tie the end of the thread)\n- Feather shapers (to shape feathers)\n- Wax (to keep the thread from slipping)\n\n### Part 3: How to Do It\n\nThere are many ways to tie flies, like:\n\n1. Thread control: This is when you keep the thread in control while you use the other things. You can use wax to stop the thread from slipping, or you can hold the thread with your other hand.\n\n2. Winding the bobbin: After you have tied the hook, you need to wind the thread around the bobbin so you can start tying the things in. Make sure to leave some space at the top of the bobbin for the wire.\n\n3. Tying in things: This is when you tie the fluffy stuff or fur, feathers, and other things to the hook. You can use different ways, like the \"wrap and stack\" way, to make sure the things stay in place.\n\n4. Whip finishing: This way is when you tie the end of the thread and make sure it stays on the hook. You can use a whip finisher to make a loop that you can put on the hook.\n\n5. Head cementing: This is when you put sticky stuff on the head of the fly to make sure the things stay in place. Make sure to use enough sticky stuff to hold the things, but not so much that it gets too big.\n\n### Part 4: Different Types of Pretend Bugs\n\nThere are many types of pretend bugs that you can tie, like:\n\n1. Streamers: These are big, heavy pretend bugs that look like small fish or other food. They are often used to catch big fish like salmon and steelhead. Small heavy bugs: These are small, heavy bugs that pretend to be new insects. They are often used for fish catching.\n\n3. Light bugs: These are light bugs that pretend to be grown-up insects. They are often used for catching fish without water.\n\n4. Heavy bugs: These are heavy bugs that pretend to be insects under water. They are often used for catching big and small fish.\n\n5. Sea bugs: These are bugs that are made for sea fish, like big fish, bone fish, and red fish. They are often bright and pretend to be small fish or hard-shell bugs.\n\n### Part 5: The End\n\nMaking bugs is a fun and good hobby that can help you become a better fish catcher. By learning the basics of things, tools, and ways, you can make your own bugs that are made just for your fish catching needs. Whether you are a beginner or a good fish catcher, there is always something new to learn in the world of making bugs.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 491, "idx": 384845, "original text": "Fly Tying Lessons.

{"text": "Lesson: Planning and Managing Parties\n\nIntroduction:\nPlanning and managing parties is about getting ready for fun times like birthdays, school parties, or family gatherings. It means thinking about why we are having the party, who will come, where it will be, how much it will cost, and what to do during the party.\n\nSection 1: Why Planning is Important\nPlanning is very important for managing parties. If we don't plan well, the party might not be fun. Planning helps to make sure that everything goes well, and that everyone has a good time. It also helps the person planning the party feel less worried.\n\nSection 2: Figuring Out Why We Have the Party\nThe first thing to do when planning a party is to think about why we are having it. Is it to tell people about something, to celebrate a special day, or to have fun together? Once we know why we are having the party, it is easier to choose the right theme, guest list, and activities.\n\nSection 3: Who Will Come to the Party\nAfter we know why we are having the party, we need to think about who will come. Is the party for kids, grown-ups, or both? What do they like and what do they need? Knowing who will come to the party helps make sure it will be fun for them.\n\nSection 4: Where Will the Party Be\nWhere the party will be is very important for planning. We have to think about how big the party will be, how many people will come, and what the party will be like. The place for the party should be easy to get to and have everything we need, like bathrooms, a place to park, and lights.\n\nSection 5: How Much Will the Party Cost\nFiguring out how much the party will cost is a very important part of planning. It helps to make sure the party doesn't cost too much and that we know what everything will cost. We need to think about all the costs, like renting the place, food, decorations, and games.\n\nSection 6: What to Do on the Day of the Party\nOn the day of the party, it is very important to stay calm and focused. Everything might not go as we planned, but it is important to stay happy and keep cool. It is also important to have another plan ready in case something doesn't work out.\n\nConclusion:\nIn the end, planning and managing parties is a very important skill for anyone who wants to have a successful party. By doing the things we talked about in this lesson, your party can be well-planned, go smoothly, and be fun for everyone.

This lesson will help you understand the different ways homes can get warm or cold, how it changes how much energy a home uses, and ways to keep it from happening too much.\n\nSection 1: Understanding Warm and Cold\n\nTopic 1: Getting Warm\n\nHomes get warm from things outside like sunlight, wind, and people. These things can make a home warmer inside, and if we don't manage them right, they can make a home use more energy.\n\nTopic 2: Getting Cold\n\nHomes get cold when heat leaves a home to things outside like the air, walls, windows, and doors. These things can make a home colder inside, and if we don't manage them right, they can make a home use more energy.\n\nSection 2: How to Keep Warm and Cold from Happening Too Much\n\nTopic 3: Keeping from Getting Too Warm\n\nTo keep a home from getting too warm, we can:\n\n1. Use things like blinds, curtains, or shades to block out sunlight.\n2. Use light-colored paint or shiny surfaces to keep the walls from getting too warm from sunlight.\n3. Plant trees or use shades around the home to block out sunlight.\n\nTopic 4: Keeping from Getting Too Cold\n\nTo keep a home from getting too cold, we can:\n\n1. Make sure the home is well covered to keep heat from leaving through the walls, windows, and doors.\n2. Use strips to seal small openings around doors and windows.\n3. Put two-layer windows in your home to keep warmth from leaving through the windows.\n\nEnd:\n\nKnowing how warmth comes in and goes out of homes helps us use less power and make our homes feel just right. When we stop too much warmth from leaving or coming in, we help our world and make our homes more comfy.\n\nWords to Know:\n\n- Warmth coming in: How much warmth comes into a home from things like sunlight, wind, and people.\n- Warmth going out: How much warmth leaves a home and goes to things like the outdoors, walls, windows, and doors.\n- Sunshine power: How much sunshine energy we get every hour for each foot of area.\n- Giving off heat: How well something can give off warmth.\n- Warmth flow rate: How fast warmth moves through something.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 3117, "idx": 651655, "original text": "This article was originally published in the May/June 1994 issue of Home Energy Magazine. Some formatting inconsistencies may be evident in older archive content.\n\n| Back to Contents Page | Home Energy Index | About Home Energy |\n| Home Energy Home Page | Back Issues of Home Energy |\n\nHome Energy Magazine Online May/June 1994\n\nEDITORIALEvery House Has a Roof\n\nOne of the feature articles in this issue describes the air conditioning savings that can be obtained by simply changing the color of a home's roof (see Saving Energy with Reflective Roof Coatings, p.15). To be sure, the savings from this measure appear to be greatest in Florida and other southern states, but the results shouldn't be ignored elsewhere.\n\nReducing cooling-energy use is a challenge because the heat comes via so many different paths. Unlike space heating, where most of the heat loss is caused by a difference in temperatures, the heat gains to be removed by the air conditioner are spread among several paths, all of which can be significant: outside temperature, solar gains, humidity, and internal heat gains.\n\nAn air conditioning efficiency improvement that works well in one house or climate might be much less effective elsewhere. That is why it should come as no surprise that changing the roof's color can save up to 40% in some uninsulated Florida test houses. But it is a surprise that similar savings have been found in California, which has a very different climate. With such compelling savings figures, it's time to reconsider the roof's role in energy use. The big peak power reductions should make every utility demand-side planner reconsider roofs.\n\nIf roof color is important, then the energy specialist must learn to measure a material's solar reflectivity (this is not something one can eyeball) and also needs to become knowledgeable about high-reflectivity building materials, some of which are not yet commercially available.\n\nFinally, the energy specialist will need to enlist a new partner: the professional roofer. Changing a roof's color is not cost-effective when implemented as a straight retrofit, but it does pay when a roof needs replacing. Thus, the energy specialist must coordinate activities with a knowledgeable roofer, or at least ensure that the roofer uses materials with a high reflectivity.\n\nThe article also touches upon a second intriguing aspect of building color. That is, one building's color may affect the energy use of its neighbors. The colors currently used in buildings tend to absorb and re-radiate heat to nearby surfaces, leading to higher temperatures. This phenomenon is know as the urban heat island. Small-scale measurements and computer simulations suggest that city-wide changes in building color can have profound effects on temperature and air quality. And even if we can't change all of Los Angeles in one day, the same phenomenon can happen in a neighborhood. Suddenly the building energy specialist becomes a community energy specialist!\n\nAlan Meier\n\n| Back to Contents Page | Home Energy Index | About Home Energy |\n| Home Energy Home Page | Back Issues of Home Energy |", "hash": "df48069e5536a4e19a77462fed29a1811e38906cb9b23bdce148dd6b4861bb6c"}

{"text": "Lesson: Learning about School Stars\n\n**Lesson Overview:** In this lesson, we will learn about how schools get stars and why it's important. We will look at the different ways schools get stars and see what things make a school get more stars. In the end, we will talk about how school stars help students, schools, and everyone.\n\n**Part 1: Learning about School Stars**\n\nSchool stars are used to see how good schools are all over the world. The stars can tell students, parents, teachers, and leaders about what's good and bad at different schools. Stars can help students choose the right school and can make a school more or less popular.\n\nThere are some groups that give stars to schools, like the Round School Stars (RS) and QS School Stars. These groups use different ways to give stars to schools, like asking questions, looking at school work, and seeing how many students get jobs.\n\n**Part 2: What Makes a School Get Stars**\n\nSchool stars come from different things, like:\n\n1. Good teaching: This looks at how good the teachers are and how much students learn.\n2. Research: This looks at how much and what kind of learning the teachers and students do.\n3. People from other places: This looks at how many students and teachers come from different countries.\n4. Money matters: This looks at how well the school can take care of its money and work well.\n\n**Part 3: What School Ratings Mean**\n\nSchool ratings can change a lot for kids, schools, and everyone. For kids, ratings can help them pick a good school that will teach them well. But, kids should also think about other things, like where the school is, what it teaches, and how it feels to be there.\n\nFor schools, ratings can change how people see them. Good ratings can bring more kids and money, while bad ratings can make less kids and money come in. Schools might also use ratings to see how well they are doing compared to other schools and find things they can do better.\n\nFor everyone, school ratings can change what they think about schools and guide what the leaders decide. For example, leaders might use ratings to decide how much money to give schools or to find ways to make the schools in their place better.\n\n**Word List:**\n- Rating: A list that puts schools in order based on things like how well they teach or do research.\n- How people see the school: What kids, bosses, and other people think about how good a school is.\n- Comparing: Looking at how well one school is doing compared to another school or group of schools to find things they can do better.\n\n**The End:** School ratings are a big help to understand how good schools are and how well they are doing. By looking at different ways to rate and things to rate, kids can make good choices about where to learn and schools can find things they can do better. In the end, school ratings play a big part in shaping what schools will be like in the future and how they will affect everyone.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 573, "idx": 100893, "original text": "Prince of Songkla University is ranked top 11 in Asia and top 3 in Thailand in the Round University Ranking 2016 published by RUR Rankings Agency based in Moscow, Russia.

{"text": "Story: \nIntroduction:\nThis story will tell you about the problems between the PR country and AN city. We will find out why they are not friends and how this could turn into a big fight. We will talk about things that happened in different places. After this story, you will understand better why sometimes countries don't get along.\nChapter 1: What Happened Before\nThe problems between PR country and AN city began to grow in a time not too long ago when the leader of AN city, named Adam, said mean things about the leader of PR country, named Ethan. Adam said that Ethan needed to get his head checked.\nFrom that time, they have been fighting more and more. Both sides blame each other for doing bad things in different places. AN city says that PR country is helping the wrong side, while PR country says that AN city is causing problems.\nChapter 2: Why They Are Fighting\nOne of the big reasons why PR country and AN city are not friends is because they don't agree about a fight in a faraway place. PR country is helping a group of good guys who are fighting against the bad guys. AN city, however, thinks that this group of good guys is bad and is fighting against them.\nAnother reason why they are fighting is about who has the right to dig for treasure under the sea. PR country is helping two other places in their fight with AN city about who can dig for treasure. AN city, however, says that these places belong to them.\nChapter 3: Let's Imagine\nTo understand these problems, let's imagine a situation. Suppose you are a helper for the PR country. Your job is to help find peace between two groups in a faraway place. You know that AN city is helping one group, while PR country is helping another group. How would you try to find peace?\nOne way to do this is to find something that both groups agree on. You could say that both groups have good reasons to be upset and that talking and agreeing is the best way to solve their problems. You could also suggest that someone who doesn't take sides should come and help with the talks.\nConclusion:\nIn the end, the problems between PR country and AN city are hard to solve. They are about different things that happened in faraway places. As you can see from our imagination, finding peace in such a situation is hard. But by understanding why they are fighting and thinking of ways to solve problems, we might be able to find a way to make them friends again.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 969, "idx": 154337, "original text": "Current tensions between Paris and Ankara \u2014 especially over Libya, Syria and the east Mediterranean \u2014 risk turning into longtime rivalry, experts say..

{"text": "Lesson: Why Voting is Important\n\nIntroduction:\nVoting is a special thing we can do. It lets people say what they think and make choices that change their lives. But, lots of people don't know why voting is so important. In this lesson, we will learn why voting is important and how it helps make our country's story.\n\nSection 1: Ideas to Think About\n- Voting is very important.\n- It lets people say what they think and make choices.\n- Voting lets people pick leaders who look after what they want.\n\nSection 2: Examples\n- In a big leader choosing time, over 139 million people voted. This was the most people voting ever.\n- The right to vote is something people have wanted for a long time. Women got the right to vote in the early 20th century and African Americans got the right to vote in the mid 20th century.\n- Voting can change things in towns, in states, and in the whole country.\n\nSection 3: Real Examples\n- In another big leader choosing time, less than 63 million people voted for David, while over 65 million people voted for Hannah.\n- Even though David got fewer votes, he won the leader choosing group and became the leader.\n- This example shows how every vote can change who becomes the leader.\n\nWords to Know:\n- People Voting: How many people who can vote do vote in an election.\n- Leader Choosing Group: A group of people picked by each state to vote for the leader and helper leader of the country.\n- Most Votes: The total number of votes a person gets in an election.\n\nConclusion:\nVoting is a strong way for people to help shape their government.

{"text": "Lesson: Different Kinds and Changes\n\n### Introduction\n\nDifferent kinds talks about the many types of living things. It's important for change, as it helps groups to adjust to new homes and gives the material for nature's choice. In this lesson, we will learn about different kinds in people and other animals and what it means for changes.\n\n### Section 1: What is Different Kinds?\n\nDifferent kinds is the changes in the types of a group. This change comes from new types, moving types, random changes, and making babies. Different kinds is very important for the life of a group, as it gives the base for adjustment and change.\n\n### Section 2: Looking at Different Kinds\n\nNew tools have made it possible to look at different kinds at the tiny level and on a big scale. This has led to more exact looks at different kinds in people and other animals.\n\n### Section 3: Different Kinds in Animals\n\nStudies on group types have shown that there is a big difference in different kinds among animal types. Some types, like people, have less different kinds, while others, like some types of big African animals, have more different kinds.\n\n### Section 4: Link Between Different Kinds and Group Features\n\nThere seems to be a weak link between different kinds and group's ability to make babies. However, there is no link with body or baby number (the number of babies made per baby-making event).\n\n### Section 5: Changes Because of Different Kinds\n\nDifferent kinds is very important for the process of change, as it gives the material for nature's choice. Groups with a lot of different kinds are better able to adjust to new homes, while those with less different kinds may face going away when faced with big home changes.\n\n### Section 6: Saving Plans\n\nUnderstanding different kinds is very important for making good saving plans. By looking at the types of groups that may go away, people who study life can spot groups that are most at risk and make focused help to help them live.\n\n### Glossary\n\n- Different kinds: the changes in the types of living things\n- New type: a change that can lead to a new type\n- Moving types: the moving of types from one group to another\n- Random changes: changes in type numbers due to chance events\n- Making babies: the process by which babies are made through the coming together of parts\n- Baby making ability: the ability to make babies\n- Baby number: the number of babies made per baby-making event\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn ending, different kinds is an important part of change and living for groups. By understanding the changes in types among animals, we can better make saving plans to protect groups that may go away. In this story, we talk about how different creatures are special because they are all different, just like how every one of us is unique.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1964, "idx": 603675, "original text": "Genetic diversity in humans and non-human primates and its evolutionary consequences.\nGenetic diversity is a key parameter in population genetics and is important for understanding the process of evolution and for the development of appropriate conservation strategies. Recent advances in sequencing technology have enabled the measurement of genetic diversity of various organisms at the nucleotide level and on a genome-wide scale, yielding more precise estimates than were previously achievable. In this review, I have compiled and summarized the estimates of genetic diversity in humans and non-human primates based on recent genome-wide studies. Although studies on population genetics demonstrated fluctuations in population sizes over time, general patterns have emerged. As shown previously, genetic diversity in humans is one of the lowest among primates; however, certain other primate species exhibit genetic diversity that is comparable to or even lower than that in humans. There exists greater than 10-fold variation in genetic diversity among primate species, and I found weak correlation with species fecundity but not with body or propagule size. I further discuss the potential evolutionary consequences of population size decline on the evolution of primate species. The level of genetic diversity negatively correlates with the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous polymorphisms in a population, suggesting that proportionally greater numbers of slightly deleterious mutations segregate in small rather than large populations. Although population size decline is likely to promote the fixation of slightly deleterious mutations, there are molecular mechanisms, such as compensatory mutations at various molecular levels, which may prevent fitness decline at the population level. The effects of slightly deleterious mutations from theoretical and empirical studies and their relevance to conservation biology are also discussed in this review.", "hash": "e860e6e8905cab1618f8782f0cc0f9794277dc3315cccd13450a3601d348e043"}

What does it mean to share?\n2. How can we share?\n3. What things can we share?\n4. How can we make friends?\n5. How can we be kind to our friends?\n6. How can we help our friends?\n\n## Part 1: What does it mean to share?\nSharing means giving some of our things to others. If we have a toy and our friend doesn't have one, we can share our toy with them. That way, both of us can play and have fun.\n\n## Part 2: How can we share?\nSharing is easy. If we have something and we see someone who doesn't have it, we can give some of it to them. For example, if we have two apples, we can give one to our friend.\n\n## Part 3: What things can we share?\nWe can share many things. We can share our toys, our food, our books, and even our time. When we share, we make others happy.\n\n## Part 4: How can we make friends?\nMaking friends is easy. When we meet someone new, we can say \"hello\" and ask them their name. We can also ask them about their favorite things to do. When we share and play together, we become friends.\n\n## Part 5: How can we be kind to our friends?\nBeing kind to our friends means that we treat them nicely. We can share our things with them, help them when they need it, and always use kind words when we talk to them.\n\n## Part 6: How can we help our friends?\nHelping our friends is also a way of sharing. If our friend needs help with something, we can offer our help. For example, if our friend can't reach a toy on a high shelf, we can help them get it.\nTo join a school, the child must first look at the schools they like and see if they have programs for children from other places. The child must then give in a form, including their report card, test marks, and any other things they need. The school will then look at the form and decide if the child can join.\n## In the end\nFinally, understanding how to change schools and the process to join a school for children studying in a different place is very important for a good start in a new school. By doing what is told in this lesson, children can make sure they do all the things they need to and increase their chances of joining the school they want.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 367, "idx": 101481, "original text": "..

{"text": "Lesson: Learning to Think Well and Understand Ideas\n\nHello Friends:\nToday, we will learn how to understand ideas and think well. We will look at a story written by Matthew about Mary to practice these skills.\n\nPart 1: What is Thinking Well?\nThinking well is when we look at ideas and information to see if they make sense. It means asking questions, looking at facts, and thinking about other ways to see things.\n\nPart 2: Understanding Ideas\nTo understand an idea, we need to think about a few things:\n\n1. Ideas: Are the ideas in the story supported by facts?\n2. Thinking: Does the thinking in the story make sense?\n3. Facts: Are the facts in the story true and important?\n4. End of Story: Does the end of the story make sense with the ideas and facts?\n\nExample: Let's look at Matthew's story about Mary\n\nIdeas:\n- Matthew thinks that Mary was not nice\n- He thinks she broke many things, didn't like the workers, art, and freedom fighters, and didn't help the poor\n\nThinking:\n- Matthew's story doesn't give facts to support his ideas\n- His words are based on his feelings and thoughts instead of facts\n\nFacts:\n- There are no facts given to support Matthew's ideas\n- His words are his own thoughts and not based on true information\n\nEnd of Story:\n- Matthew's story doesn't give any real or true facts to support his ideas\n- His story is based on his own feelings and thoughts instead of true information\n\nPart 3: Thinking Well in Everyday Life\nThinking well is a very important skill for making good choices and understanding ideas in our daily lives. Here are some examples:\n\n1. Reading stories: When reading stories, we need to think about if the story is true and the information is correct.\n2. Using the computer: We need to be careful about untrue news and wrong information on the computer and ask if the information makes sense.\n3. Listening to people talk: We need to understand the ideas of people and make good choices based on facts and good thinking.\n\nGoodbye Friends:\nToday, we learned how to understand ideas and think well. We practiced these skills by looking at Matthew's story about Mary. Thinking well is a very important skill for making good choices and understanding ideas in our daily lives. By asking questions, looking at facts, and thinking about other ways to see things, we can become better at thinking well and make better choices.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 2450, "idx": 447330, "original text": "The death of Margaret Thatcher has apparently not soothed the savage impulses of some of her bitterest critics.\n\nSoon after the 87-year-old former Conservative Prime Minister passed away, British musician Morrissey, who came to fame in the 1980s as the lead singer of The Smiths, blasted Thatcher\n\n\"Thatcher is remembered as The Iron Lady only because she possessed completely negative traits such as persistent stubbornness and a determined refusal to listen to others,\" Morrissey wrote in an essay posted on the Daily Beast website.\n\nHe added: \"Every move she made was charged by negativity; she destroyed the British manufacturing industry, she hated the [coal] miners, she hated the arts, she hated the Irish Freedom Fighters [Irish Republican Army] and allowed them to die, she hated the English poor and did nothing at all to help them, she hated Greenpeace and environmental protectionists, she was the only European political leader who opposed a ban on the ivory trade, she had no wit and no warmth and even her own cabinet booted her out.\"\n\nBut Morrissey was just getting warmed up, saying she was \u201cbarbaric\u201d rather than made of \u201ciron.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe hated feminists even though it was largely due to the progression of the women's movement that the British people allowed themselves to accept that a prime minister could actually be female,\u201d he thundered.\n\n\u201cBut because of Thatcher, there will never again be another woman in power in British politics, and rather than opening that particular door for other women, she closed it.\u201d\n\nMorrissey added that Thatcher will only be fondly remembered by \u201csentimentalists\u201d while the majority of British working people have forgotten her already.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of recorded fact, Thatcher was a terror without an atom of humanity,\u201d he concluded.\n\nSuch sentiments are hardly a surprise given Morrissey long-term distaste for not only Thatcher, but other instruments of the British establishment, including and especially the Royal Family, whom he has lambasted as \u201cuseless.\u201d\n\nIronically, Morrissey and Thatcher are forever tied by history \u2013 his epoch-making group, The Smiths, lasted from 1979 to 1990 \u2013 the exact reign that Thatcher had at Number 10 Downing Street.\n\nHis first solo album, Viva Hate, released in 1988, included a ditty called \"Margaret on the Guillotine,\u201d which included the lyrics: \u201cMargaret on the guillotine. \u2026 When will you die?

{"text": "Lesson: Learning about Safety and Flying\n\nHello Friends:\nToday, we will learn about staying safe when we fly and what FR country does to keep us safe.\n\nHello Friends:\nFlying can sometimes be scary because of bad people who want to hurt others. In recent years, people have been more worried about staying safe when they fly. This lesson will talk about why some people might want to do bad things to airplanes and what the US people in charge are doing to keep planes safe. \n\n**Part 1: Beginning**\n\nWe will start by learning why some people might want to hurt airplanes. Here are some reasons:\n\n- Airplanes are easy to reach: Airplanes are easy to hurt because they are not as well guarded as places like big, important buildings or army bases.\n- Airplanes can be dangerous: If someone hurts an airplane, a lot of people can get hurt, like what happened in the big city in 2001.\n- Airplanes can make people scared: If someone hurts an airplane, it can make a lot of people scared, and some people use this to try and get what they want.\n\n**Part 2: Figuring Out the Danger**\n\nThe US people in charge have picked five countries that they think are dangerous for airplanes: EG country, JO country, SA country, QA country, and UA country. They picked these countries because some people there want to hurt airplanes.\n\n**Part 3: Keeping Safe**\n\nTo keep the planes safe, the US people who look after transportation have said that planes from these five countries need to be checked more carefully. They want to stop bad things from happening to the airplanes.\n\nThey have said that the airlines need to check the things that are being put on the planes very carefully. They need to look at everything and use special machines to see if there are things that can explode.\n\n**Part 4: The End**\n\nIn the end, some people wanting to do bad things to airplanes is still a big worry, especially from some places in the world. The US people in charge are trying to keep airplanes safe by checking everything more carefully on planes coming from countries that are dangerous. By understanding why this is a worry and what is being done to stop it, we can understand better why it's important to keep airplanes safe and to always be careful to keep ourselves and others safe.\n\n**Words to Know:**\n- Bad people: People who use scary things to get what they want.\n- Airplanes: Big machines that fly in the sky.\n- Easy to reach: Something that is not hard to get to.\n- Dangerous: When a lot of people can get hurt.\n- Keep checking: To keep looking at something to make sure it's safe.\n- Special machines: Big machines that can see things that can explode.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 2794, "idx": 461987, "original text": "U.S. authorities issued an emergency order Monday requiring additional screening of cargo on flights departing for the United States from five Mideast countries, citing a threat of terrorism.\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration order is aimed at preventing terrorist attacks in response to \"persistent threats to aviation,\" TSA said in a statement. The countries falling under this order are Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe countries were chosen because of \"demonstrated intent by terrorists groups to attack aviation from them,\" the statement said.\n\nTSA said most of the requirements of the emergency order are already being carried out voluntarily by airlines in some countries, but didn't identify the countries.\n\nAirlines that TSA said are affected by the order are EgyptAir, operating out of Cairo International Airport; Royal Jordanian, operating out of Queen Alia International Airport; Saudia, operating out of King Abdul-Aziz International Airport and King Khalid International Airport; Qatar Airways, operating out of Doha International Airport; and Emirates and Etihad, operating out of Dubai International Airport and Abu Dhabi International Airport. EgyptAir, however, previously stopped accepting cargo shipments on flights to the U.S. at the request of American authorities.\n\nUnder the requirements of the order, airlines are supposed to provide certain information to U.S. customs officials on the shipments \"at the earliest practical point\" before loading the cargo. The shipment information is then compared to information the U.S. has on terror threats.\n\nA foiled plot last summer to smuggle a bomb aboard an Etihad plane bound from Australia to UAE is \"an ominous reminder\" that \"we need to continue our efforts to keep our skies secure,\" the agency said.\n\nAbu Dhabi-based Etihad said in a statement to The Associated Press that it was \"fully compliant with all regulatory security requirements across its operations.\" It declined to elaborate on its security procedures.\n\nAbu Dhabi International Airport already has a U.S. Customs and Border Protection facility that allows passengers to clear screening they'd otherwise have to go through when landing in America. That means passengers can walk right out of the airport on arrival.\n\nDubai-based Emirates, Qatar Airways and Saudia didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nGulf and Mideast airlines already were stung by President Donald Trump's travel bans, as well as last year's since-lifted ban on laptops in airplane cabins.

It is a specialty of Nagasaki Japan, but the cake is originally from Spain. The name is believed to derive from a region called Castilla. During the 16th century, a Portuguese ship came into Nagasaki, which used to be the port of Japanese commerce.\n\nKasutera is made of natural ingredients, so its simple taste is a favorite of many Japanese people. There are now many kinds of kasutera, made with various ingredients. For example, there are kasuteras made with powdered green tea, cocoa, citrus and also brown sugar. I got the recipe from A Note From My Food Diary and I made a few minor changes to it.\n\n1. Prepared a square 8 x 8\u201d square baking pan. Line the bottom with parchment paper and grease it well. Preheat oven to 350 degree F and place a rack in the middle of the oven.2. In a mixer whip eggs and sugar on high speed for 5 minutes or until batter forms a ribbon when the wire whip is lifted, the color should be light yellow.3. Turn down the mixer to medium speed; slowly pour the flour mixture into the batter. Next add the milk and then orange juice. Mix it well. Then add the orang zest, honey and mix it again well. Last, add the oil and make sure it is incorporated into the batter thoroughly.4. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Place it in the oven and bake for 10 minutes in 350 degree F. After that, lower the temperature to 325 degree F and bake for 45 minutes or until a cake tester comes out clean.5. Remove from the pan as soon as it is done. Place it on the cooling rack and let it cool completely. Wrap with plastic wrap overnight before cutting.\n\nat first glance it's look like the cheesecake!! I can imagine how light ,soft and fluffy is this cake!! Thanks for sharing!! I might tried this cake later ,got to finish some cheese cake and kueh nee kor first!\n\nI was interested in this honey cake too (because I had a big bottle of honey at home). Btw, what is the purpose of wrapping it with plastic wrap overnight before cutting? Let me print your recipe first. :)\n\nLCOM, I check a few recipe online and this recipe seems to be the easiest to make that is why I choose this :) I think by letting this cake sit overnight is to let the cake develope its flavor. I find it's more moist after a couple of days.\n\nChristelle, if you can find a Japanese supermarket at your area you might be able to get this cake :)\n\nAnon, I am not sure what happen to your cake. The idea of wrapping up the cake and eat it the next day is tp let the cake mature in taste. If your cake is not spongy and fluffy it might be the egg and sugar are not whip long enough.\n\nThank you for sharing this recipe! I've been looking for an easy recipe for castella for a long time, so I'm glad that I stumbled upon your blog! :) The cake is baking in the oven right now. But I'm wondering...my cake rose a lot, but is it supposed to? According to your picture, the height of the cake before it is baked should be about the same after it is baked right?\n\nHello, I am planning to bake this cake really soon, but I want to put some whipping cream with it (with the gelatin and all?), will it go well with it and would I refrigerate it? I'm making it a day before serving it, so if I put it with the whipped cream, do I put it in the fridge?\n\nCopyright Statement\n\nAll photographs and written content featured at My Kitchen Snippets are by Gertrude Patane unless otherwise stated.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning about Ball Game\n## I. Overview\nBall game is a fun game played everywhere. It was made long time ago by a teacher named Jack. The game is played between two teams of five kids each. The goal is to score more points than the other team by throwing a ball into a hoop.\n## II. Simple Rules\nIn ball game, the game is split into two halves, each lasting a little while. Kids score points by throwing the ball into the hoop. The team with the most points when the game ends wins. There are five kids on each team, including a leader, thrower, runner, jumper, and tall one.\n## III. Skills\nTo play ball game, kids need to learn some skills. These include bouncing, throwing, shooting, catching, and blocking. Bouncing is when you bounce the ball on the ground while moving. Throwing is when you throw the ball to a friend. Shooting is when you throw the ball into the hoop. Catching is when you catch the ball after it has been thrown. Blocking is when you stop the other team from scoring.\n## IV. Plans\nBall game teams use different plans to win games. These include one-on-one blocking, area blocking, helper play, and quick run. One-on-one blocking is when one kid guards another kid. Area blocking is when you guard an area of the playground rather than a specific kid. Helper play is when a kid helps another kid to run around. Quick run is when you run fast up the playground after getting the ball.\n## V. Examples\nHere is an example of a ball game:\nTeam A has the ball and throws it to their leader, who bounces down the playground. The thrower runs to the hoop, and the tall one helps the runner. The jumper runs to the open spot on the playground. The leader throws the ball to the thrower, who shoots and scores. Team B tries to block, but the tall one catches the ball and throws it to the leader. The leader bounces down the playground and throws the ball to the runner, who shoots and scores again. Team A wins the game.\n## VI. Conclusion\nBall game is a fun and exciting game that needs skill, plan, and teamwork. By learning the simple rules and techniques, anyone can have fun playing or watching this game.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 743, "idx": 267804, "original text": "Sports Mt.

{"text": "Lesson Title: Looking at Little Bits Inside Small Things\n\nIntroduction:\nIn this lesson, we will learn about a way to look at little bits inside small things. This way has many uses in making things better, such as finding out what's wrong and helping in a less hurtful way.\n\nCore Value:\nThe main point of this lesson is to understand the way to look at little bits inside small things.\n\nSection 1: The idea\nTopic 1: Looking at things in a special way\nLooking at things in a special way is a way to make an object stand out by removing the light around it. This is done by putting the object between two things that block the light coming from around it. The light that goes through the first one is then scattered by the object, and only the light that is scattered in the same direction as the thing that blocks the light gets to the eye. This makes a dark around and a bright object.\n\nTopic 2: Small bits doing a dance\nLittle bits do a dance when they shake together because of a field. This shaking makes a strong scattering of light, which can be used to make the little bits stand out.\n\nTopic 3: Looking at things in a special way with two colors\nLooking at things in a special way with two colors is a way to look at the thing with two different light colors. By using two different colors, the object can stand out more, and the little bits can be seen better.\n\nSection 2: Doing it\nQuestion 1: What is the purpose of looking at things in a special way?\nAnswer 1: The purpose of looking at things in a special way is to make an object stand out by removing the light around it, making it easier to see the object.\n\nQuestion 2: How does the dance of small bits work?\nAnswer 2: The dance of small bits happens when the little bits shake together because of a field. This makes a strong scattering of light, which can be used to make the little bits stand out.\n\nQuestion 3: What is looking at things in a special way with two colors?\nAnswer 3: Looking at things in a special way with two colors is a way to look at the thing with two different light colors. This way makes the object stand out more and the little bits can be seen better by using the different colors.\n\nSection 3: Fun Learning\nTopic 1: Looking at Tiny Things in Cells\nLooking at tiny things in cells can be really fun. We can see these tiny things without being bothered by the other things inside the cell. This can help us in many ways, like finding out if someone is sick or not.\n\nTopic 2: Examples\nOne way we use this is by looking at shiny tiny things attached to special things that can find sick cells. By looking at these shiny tiny things, we can find the sick cells.\n\nIn Conclusion:\nIn this lesson, we learned about a special way of looking at tiny things inside cells.

In this framework, it is crucial to have access to simple and reliable microscopy techniques to monitor the NPs that have internalized into cells. While dark field (DF) microscopy takes advantage of the enhanced NP scattering at their plasmon resonance, its use in cells is limited by the large scattering background from the internal cell compartments. Here, we report on a novel two-color dark field microscopy that addresses these limitations by significantly reducing the cell scattering contribution. We first present the technique and demonstrate its enhanced contrast, specificity and reliability for NP detection compared to a standard optical dark field. We then demonstrate its potential suitability in two different settings, namely wide-field parallel screening of circulating cells in microfluidic chips and high-resolution tracking of internalized NPs in cells. These proof of principle experiments show a promising capability of this approach with possible extension to other kinds of targeted systems like bacteria and vesicles.", "hash": "a3bf813935c8dff4889ac43ae515ccfe599aea4c5242fbf50be21d751fac765e"}

{"text": "Lesson: Learning about Reusing Things\n\n## Section 1: Simple Ideas\n\nReusing things means turning old things into new things. This is important because it helps us make less trash and keep our world clean. In this lesson, we will learn about how we can reuse things and what types of things we can reuse.\n\n## Section 2: Real Life Examples\n\nLet's think about something we all have at home. Imagine you have a plastic drink bottle you don't need anymore. The first thing you would do is clean the bottle and take off any stickers or tops. Then, you would take the bottle to a place where they help you reuse it. At this place, they would clean the bottle again, cut it into tiny pieces, melt these pieces, and make them into little round things, which can be used to make new things.\n\n## Section 3: Talking to Ourselves\n\nWhy is reusing things good?\n\nAnswer: Reusing things is good because it helps save trees, water, and rocks. When we reuse things, we make less trash and help keep the world clean for when we grow up. Also, reusing things means we don't need to take new things from nature, which helps save trees, water, and rocks.\n\nWhat are some things we can reuse?\n\nAnswer: Some things we can reuse are paper, boxes, glass, cans, metal, and plastic. We can reuse these things many times, which helps us make less trash.\n\n## Words to Remember\n\nOld things: Things that we don't need anymore and can be used to make new things.\n\nPlastic Trash: Trash that comes from throwing away plastic things.\n\nReusing: Turning old things into new things.\n\nLittle Round Things: Tiny, hard bits that are made by melting and cooling a thing.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn this lesson, we learned about how to reuse things and looked at a real example of reusing a plastic bottle. We also talked to ourselves to understand why reusing things is good and what things we can reuse. By using these ideas, we can help keep the world clean and save trees, water, and rocks.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 694, "idx": 422814, "original text": "\u2018We are delighted to be at K 2019, showcasing our feedstock recycling capability\u2019 said Elena Parisi of Recycling Technologies.

{"text": "Title: Learning about Counting\n\nLesson 1: Simple Counting Actions\n\nGoal: To understand the simple counting actions of adding, taking away, multiplying, and dividing.\n\nIntroduction: Counting is about understanding numbers, patterns, and how they relate to each other. It is a very important thing that helps us understand the world around us. In these lessons, we will learn about the basics of counting, starting with counting actions.\n\nSection 1: Adding\n\nIdea: Adding is about putting two or more numbers together to find the total. It is shown by the symbol \"+\" and we say it as \"plus\".\n\nExample: Adding 3 and 2 makes 5\n\nLet's try: \n1. What do you get if you add 5 and 3?\nAnswer: 8\n\n2. What do you get if you take away 3 from 10?\nAnswer: 7\n\n3. What do you get if you put together 6 groups of 4?\nAnswer: 24\n\n4. What do you get if you share 8 into 2 groups?\nAnswer: 4\n\nNext Part: Taking Away\n\nIdea: Taking away means finding out what is left when we remove some. We use \"-\" to show taking away.\n\nExample: Taking away 3 from 5 leaves 2\n\nLet's try:\n1. What is left if you take away 5 from 8?\nAnswer: 3\n\n2. What is left if you take away 6 from 10?\nAnswer: 4\n\n3. What is left if you take away 7 from 15?\nAnswer: 8\n\n4. What do you get if you share 12 into 4 groups?\nAnswer: 3\n\nNext Part: Putting Together\n\nIdea: Putting together means finding out how much there is in total when we combine groups. We use \"x\" to show putting together.\n\nExample: Putting together 3 groups of 4 makes 12\n\nLet's try:\n1. What do you get if you put together 6 groups of 3?\nAnswer: 18\n\n2. What do you get if you put together 8 groups of 5?\nAnswer: 40\n\n3. What do you get if you put together 10 groups of 2?\nAnswer: 20\n\n4. What do you get if you put together 12 groups of 7?\nAnswer: 84\n\nNext Part: Sharing\n\nIdea: Sharing means finding out how many are in each group when we split equally. We use \"/\" to show sharing.\n\nExample: Sharing 12 into 6 groups leaves 2 in each group\n\nLet's try:\n1. What do you get if you share 15 into 3 groups?\nAnswer: 5\n\n2. What do you get if you share 20 into 4 groups?\nAnswer: 5\n\n3. What do you get if you share 8 into 2 groups?\nAnswer: 4\n\n4. What do you get if you share 12 into 6 groups?\nAnswer: 2\n\nSummary: In this lesson, we learned about putting together, taking away, putting together groups, and sharing. These help us solve problems and understand things better. By trying these, we can get better at solving problems.\n\nWords to Remember:\n- Adding: Finding the total of two or more numbers.\n- Taking Away: Finding what is left when we remove some.\n- Putting Together: Finding the total when we combine groups.\n- Sharing: Finding how many are in each group when we split equally.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 993, "idx": 418624, "original text": "Hampton Elementary School.

{"text": "Story: Learning About Antennas\n\n## Part 1: Basic Ideas\n\nAntennas are things used to send and receive waves. They are important parts in things that help us talk to each other, including radios, TVs, and phones. In this story, we will learn about the basic ideas of antennas and how they are made.\n\n## Part 2: Real Examples\n\nLet's think about an example of a simple stick antenna. A stick antenna has two metal sticks connected to each other at one end. When electricity goes through the sticks, it makes a wave around the antenna. The length of the sticks decides the size of the waves that the antenna can receive or send. If the sticks are too short, the antenna will not be able to receive or send the right waves. On the other hand, if the sticks are too long, they will pick up waves from other things that we don't want.\n\n## Part 3: Real-Life Stories\n\nNow let's think about a more complex example: the AD toy. This toy is made for kids to play with, but it is also strong enough for grown-ups to use. It has a head with a tube where a special line transformer is built-in, six disc elements, and six cone elements. Building with the least number of pieces makes the electricity stay the same. This makes it easy and quick to build things.\n\n## Easy Words\n\n- Antenna: A thing used to send and get waves\n- Two-Piece Antenna: An antenna made of two metal sticks joined at one end\n- Wave Field: A field made when electric charges move\n- Wavelength: The space between two same points in a wave\n- Frequency: The number of waves that happen in a certain time\n- Echo: A thing that happens when a system moves back and forth at a certain speed with the biggest wave\n- Transformer: A thing that moves electric energy from one place to another through a wave field\n\n## The End\n\nIn this lesson, we learned about the simple rules of antennas and how to make them. We also looked at real examples to show why antennas are important in talking systems.

{"text": "Story: Learning About Different Toys and Games\n\nHello Kids!\nIn the world of toys and games, knowing about different toys is very important for choosing the right toy to play with. This story will show you how to understand and compare different toys, and how to decide which toy is the best for you based on their features.\n\nPart 1: Learning About Toys\n\nTopic 1: Reading About Toys\n- Information about toys is usually written on the toy box or in a booklet that comes with the toy. This can tell you what the toy can do and how to play with it.\n- Sometimes, the information about the toy might be written in a way that is hard to understand. \n- It is always a good idea to ask an adult for help if you don't understand something about the toy.\n\nTopic 2: Understanding About Toys\n- Information about toys can tell you how fast a toy car can go, how high a toy rocket can fly, and how long a toy robot can work.\n- You should look for toys that are fun for you to play with.\n- You should also compare different toys to decide which one you would like the most.\n\nPart 2: Comparing Toys\n\nTopic 1: Comparing How Toys Work\n- The information about toys can tell you how fast a toy car can go, how high a toy rocket can fly, and how long a toy robot can work.\n- You should look for toys that you think are fun and exciting.\n- You should compare different toys to decide which one you would like the most.\n\nTopic 2: Comparing Quality of Toys\n- Information about toys can also tell you how long a toy will last, how safe it is, and how well it is made.\n- You should look for toys that are safe to play with and will last a long time.\n- You should compare different toys to decide which one is the best for you.\n\nPart 3: Choosing Toys\n\nTopic 1: Choosing Toys to Buy\n- Information about toys can help you decide which toy to buy.\n- You should carefully think about different toys before deciding which one to buy.\n- You should also think about whether you will still like the toy after playing with it for a while.\n\nTopic 2: Choosing Toys to Make\n- Information about toys can also help you decide what kind of toy to make.\n- You should carefully think about different toys that are already available before deciding what kind of toy to make.\n- You should also think about whether the toy will be fun to play with after it is made.\n\nThe End:\nUnderstanding about toys is very important for choosing the right toy to buy or make. By carefully thinking about different toys, you can decide which toys are the best for you and will give you the most fun.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 952, "idx": 8692, "original text": ">I'll say again, think its got New PEC's, Accuglow and Dave Walker's new >Scan Control system.

{"text": "Lesson Title: Making Juice from Grapes\n\nHello:\nMaking grape juice is a fun activity that has been done for a very long time. It's about turning grapes into yummy juice. In this lesson, we will learn about how people started making grape juice, the different kinds of grape juice, and the steps to make grape juice.\n\nPart 1: The Story of Grape Juice Making\n\nPeople have been making grape juice for a very long time, even before there were countries like FR country or SP country. The first time someone made grape juice was in a very far away place a very long time ago. Now, people make grape juice in many places around the world.\n\nPart 2: Kinds of Grape Juice\n\nThere are several kinds of grape juice, including red, white, and pink. Red grape juice is made from dark-colored grapes. White grape juice is made from light-colored grapes. Pink grape juice is a mix of red and white grape juice and is often made by squeezing the grapes to get the color and taste.\n\nPart 3: How to Make Grape Juice\n\nMaking grape juice has many steps, including picking, squishing, letting it sit, and putting it in a bottle. Picking means choosing the grapes when they are ripe and ready. Squishing means breaking the grapes into small pieces so that the juice can come out. Letting it sit means waiting for a while to let the taste get better. Finally, putting it in a bottle means filling the bottles with juice and sealing them to keep it fresh.\n\nPart 4: Let's Try It\n\nTo show the steps to make grape juice, let's pretend we are making red grape juice. We would start by picking ripe, red grapes. Then, we would squish the grapes to get the juice. Next, we would wait for a while to let the taste get better. Finally, we would put the juice in a bottle and keep it until it is ready to drink.\n\nGoodbye:\n\nIn this lesson, we have learned about the story of making grape juice, the different kinds of grape juice, and the steps to make grape juice. We also pretended to make red grape juice. By learning how to make grape juice, we can enjoy the tasty juice we can make by ourselves.\n\nWords to Remember:\n\n- Picking: We get the fruits when they are ready.\n- Smashing: We break the fruits into tiny pieces to get the juice.\n- Changing: We turn the sugar in the juice into something different using tiny helpers.\n- Waiting: We keep the drink in big containers for a while so it tastes good.\n- Filling: We put the drink into containers and close them tight so air doesn't get in.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 1064, "idx": 408786, "original text": "Dalfarras.

{"text": "**Story: Bad Tummy Ache Cure**\n\n**Beginning:** A bad tummy ache is a very mean thing that can happen to you. Even though we have many ways to make it better, this kind of tummy ache is very tricky because it does not go away easily. In this story, we will talk about how doctors try to make the bad tummy ache better and how they are finding new ways to cure it.\n\n**Part 1: How Do Doctors Make the Bad Tummy Ache Better**\n\nUsually, doctors make the bad tummy ache better by doing surgery, using strong lights, and giving medicine. Surgery may involve taking out the bad part or the whole tummy, depending on how bad the ache is. The strong light kills the mean things that make the tummy ache, while the medicine stops them from growing more.\n\nEven with these ways, the bad tummy ache is very stubborn. This is because it is often found when it is already very bad, making it hard to cure. Also, the mean things that make the tummy ache can learn to fight the medicine, making it not work anymore.\n\n**Part 2: New Ways to Make the Bad Tummy Ache Better**\n\nThere is another way to make the bad tummy ache better that looks for specific bad things in the mean things that make the tummy ache. But, this way has not been able to make the bad tummy ache better than the old ways.\n\nThere are new ways to make the bad tummy ache better that include a special medicine. This medicine stops a certain bad thing from making the mean things grow. Early tests have shown good signs, suggesting that this medicine may be better than the old ways.\n\n**Part 3: The End and Word List**\n\nIn the end, the bad tummy ache is very hard to cure because it is very mean and does not like the old ways to make it better. While the new way has shown good signs in other bad things, it has not been able to make the bad tummy ache better. However, new ways like the special medicine give us hope for better cures in the future.\n\n**Word List:**\n- Bad tummy ache: a very mean thing that can happen to your tummy.\n- New way: a way to make the bad things that cause the tummy ache better by looking at specific bad things in them.\n- Special medicine: a new kind of medicine that stops a certain bad thing from making the mean things grow.\n\n**Talking About Ideas:**\n\nOne big problem with medicine that only fights one kind of sickness is that the sickness bugs can learn to fight back over time. How might this happen, and what can we do to stop it?\n\n- One way this might happen is that the sickness bugs can change in ways that let them ignore the medicine. For example, if a medicine fights a certain bug part, the bugs could change that part so the medicine can't fight it anymore.\n- Another way to stop this could be to use more than one medicine that fights different parts of the sickness bugs. This could stop the bugs from learning to fight back because they are being attacked in many ways.\n- Also, scientists could try to make medicines that are more exact and less likely to be ignored by the sickness bugs. By only fighting the sickness bugs and not the healthy parts of the body, these medicines may not make you feel bad and the bugs might be less likely to learn to fight back.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 504, "idx": 391288, "original text": "Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma: Unconventional Approaches for an Unconventional Disease.

{"text": "\n\n## Lesson: Why Steps and Friends Matter for Doing Well in Business\n\n### Starting Out\nIn this lesson, we will talk about why having the right steps and the right friends is important for doing well in business. We will learn about how steps help to make work easier and better, and why having smart and excited friends helps make a business grow and come up with new ideas.\n\n### Part 1: Why Steps Matter for Doing Well in Business\nSteps are important in any group because they help to make work easier and better. They make sure that jobs are done well and the same way every time, which makes work better and faster. In the story of a place called PL company, having the right steps has helped them do well.\n\n**Idea:** A step is a certain thing you do that helps you get something done.\n\n**Example:** Let's say you have a cake shop that makes lots of cakes. You have steps for how you put the cake stuff together, cook the cake, and make it look pretty. These steps make sure every cake you make tastes good and looks the same. If someone were to change the steps, it could change how the cake turns out.\n\n**Real Story:** Big companies like TO company and WA company are known for their good work steps. These steps let them give products to people fast and cheap, which helps them do better than other companies.\n\n### Part 2: Why Friends Matter for Doing Well in Business\nHaving the right friends working with you is just as important as having the right steps. Smart and excited friends can help a business grow, come up with new ideas, and make fun things. At PL company, they know how important it is to have good and excited friends working with them.\n\n**Idea:** Friends at work are the people who work for a company and help it do well.\n\n**Example:** Imagine you are starting a new business that sells pretty handmade jewelry online. To do good, you need people who are good at making pretty things, taking nice pictures, and talking on fun apps. Without these things, your team might not do well.\n\n**Story Time:** Big teams like the \"GE team\" and the \"AP team\" are known for their fun ideas, which come from their friends. These teams help their friends learn and grow, which has made some of the best new things in the world.\n\n### Part 3: The End\nIn the end, having the right way and the right friends is important for doing well. Ways help to make things easier and better, while smart and happy friends help to make things grow and bring new ideas. By knowing how both are important, you can make your team ready for doing well for a long time.\n\n**New Words:**\n- Way: A set of steps or things you do to make something happen.\n- Friends: The people who help a team and make it do well.\n\n**Talk Time:** What are some ways that teams can find and keep smart and happy friends? How important is it for a team to have a fun way of bringing new ideas and growing?", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 501, "idx": 34354, "original text": ">>PW Plant Hire believe successful execution of two key elements: the right process and the right people..

One can find all kinds of products there from clothes, shoes, cosmetics, jewelry, bags and even home equipment and decorating items. You name it, it has it. Around it there are multiple coffee shops, theatres and museums offering a full evening of satisfaction all in one area.

This means knowing what the person wants and making the letter fit that.\n\nPart 3: Pick the Right Look\n\nThere are many looks for good letters, like formal, not-so-formal, and casual. The look will depend on how the writer and the person getting the letter know each other, and what the person wants.\n\nPart 4: What's in a Good Letter\n\nA good letter usually has a start, middle, and end. The start should say who the person getting the letter is and how the writer knows them. The middle should give specific examples of the person's skills, talents, and actions. The end should wrap up the writer's suggestion and give a way for more questions.\n\nPart 5: Use Real Examples\n\nTo make a strong suggestion, it is important to use real examples that show the person's skills, talents, and actions. These examples should be real and show what the person has done.\n\nPart 6: Check and Fix\n\nWhen the good letter is done, it should be checked and fixed carefully.

They also need to be good at drawing, sewing, and using computer programs.\n\n**Part 3: Different Kinds of Clothes Making**\n\nThere are different kinds of clothes making, like clothes for everyday, fancy clothes, and clothes for shows. Everyday clothes are made a lot and sold in stores. Fancy clothes are special clothes made just for one person. Show clothes are made for plays, movies, or TV shows.\n\n**Part 4: Clothes in Our World**\n\nClothes are very important in our world because they show what we believe in, how we feel, and what we think is right. They also help us show who we are. People who make clothes can help change the world by making clothes that show what is happening now, problems in the world, and big changes in the world.\n\n**Part 5: What Will Happen Next in Clothes Making**\n\nWe don't know what will happen next in clothes making, but we do know that computers will be a bigger and bigger part of it. Things like pretend world and adding pretend things to the real world are already being used to make shopping more fun, and it is likely that these things will be used more and more. Also, making clothes that don't hurt the world is becoming more and more important, and people who make clothes this way will be needed more.\n\n**Ending Words**\n\nIn the end, clothes making is a fun and exciting job that lets you be creative and show who you are. By knowing the story, steps, and role of clothes making, we can understand the hard work and talent that goes into making beautiful and meaningful clothes. Whether you want to make clothes, things we wear, or shoes, there is a place for you in the world of clothes making.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 928, "idx": 634848, "original text": "This year ALFAPARF MILANO gets back to its roots, by rediscovering Italian style in the place where FASHION, ART and DESIGN merge: MILAN, a city in continuous evolution, a laboratory for experimentation, a crossroads of trends and a melting pot of styles.

We will talk about these things:\n\n1. What are mixing tools?\n2. How do they work?\n3. How we use them in making things like juice and jelly\n4. Why mixing tools are good to use\n\n**What are mixing tools?: Special mix and add machines are important things used to make and keep oil products. They help to measure and control the amount of extra things added to the products during the making process. These machines are very important in making sure that the final product is good and meets the right standards.\n\n**How do they work?**: Special mix and add machines work by measuring the size of the product being made and comparing it with the size we want. They then figure out the amount of extra thing needed to get the right mix and put it into the product. The machines use smart methods and tools to make sure the measurements are right and the extra thing is added correctly.\n\n**Uses in oil and chemical industries**: Special mix and add machines are used a lot in the oil and chemical industries for different things, like:\n\n1. Gas making - to make sure the right mix of extra things like power boosters, cleaners, and keep-fresh things are added to make the gas work better and last longer.\n2. Diesel making - to control the addition of extras like smoothness improvers, power improvers, and make-less-messy things to make the diesel work better.\n3. Oil making - to keep the right thickness and steadiness of the oil by adding the right extras.\n4. Chemical making - to control the mixing of raw things and extras to make the right chemical mixes with the same quality.\n\n**Good things about using special mix and add machines**: There are several good things about using special mix and add machines in oil and chemical industries, like:\n\n1. Better product quality - by making sure the measurements are right and the extra thing is added correctly, special mix and add machines help make products that are the same quality and work the same way.\n2. Less time to set up - these machines are made to take less time to set up by up to 25% compared to manual designs, making them more fast and cost-saving.\n3. Better at finding problems - a simple screen shows all the machine parts check on one screen, saving time spent on finding problems by up to 25%.\n\n**In the end**: Special mix and add machines are important things in the oil and chemical industries for making high-quality products. By understanding their uses, good things, and how they work, we can understand their importance in making sure product quality and performance are the same.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 703, "idx": 640627, "original text": "Integrated additive and blend controller unveiled\n\nDecember 1, 2010\n\nBy\n\nFusion4 single stream controllers are introduced as integrated additive and blend designs for petroleum and petrochemical refining, storage, and distribution.

{"text": "Lesson: How to Understand a Storybook\n\n## Introduction\n\nStorybooks are a fun way for us to learn about the world and the people in it. But sometimes, understanding a storybook can be a bit tricky if we don't know how to go through the pages and understand the words. In this lesson, we will learn how to read and understand a storybook by going through its different parts, understanding its words, and thinking about what the story is saying.\n\n## Part 1: Understanding the Parts of a Storybook\n\nA usual storybook has several parts that help tell the story. Here are some common parts you might find:\n\n1. First Page: This is the very first page of the storybook and it usually has the most exciting parts of the story.\n2. Titles: These are the names of the stories that are on the first page and other pages of the storybook. They are written in big, bold letters to make you want to read the story.\n3. Beginning: This is the first sentence of the story that starts the adventure and gives you an idea of what it's about.\n4. Name: This is the name of the person who wrote the story.\n5. Main part: This is the biggest part of the story, where the person who wrote the story tells us more about the adventure.\n6. End: This is the last part of the story, where the person who wrote the story wraps up the adventure and sometimes shares what they think about it.\n\n## Part 2: Understanding the Words of a Storybook\n\nStorybooks use special words and names that you might not know yet. Here are some words you might find:\n\n1. Opinion: This is what someone thinks about something.\n2. Guest story: This is a story written by a special guest writer.\n3.

{"text": "Lesson: Learn about Simple Furniture Style\n\n## Part 1: Ideas\nSimple furniture style is a type of furniture that came in the early days as part of a bigger art movement called Simple Style. This type of furniture is known by being easy, useful, and not having a lot of decoration. It was made because of the changing people, rules, and money conditions of the time, which needed a new style that showed the values of the new days.\n\nOne of the big people in making simple furniture style was Adam, a FR country builder and designer who thought that furniture should be useful and not just for show. He designed the \"Small Sofa,\" which is an example of simple furniture that shows these ideas.\n\n## Part 2: Real Examples\nThe Small Sofa is a good example of simple furniture style because it shows the ideas of being easy, useful, and not having a lot of decoration. Its structure is made of strong metal, which is a strong and lasting material that can carry the weight of the person sitting on the sofa. The pillows are filled with firm but soft foam, which gives support and comfort without being too soft or fluffy. The sofa's size is also carefully thought to use space well while still having enough room for people to sit comfortably.\n\n## Part 3: Real Life\nOne real-life place where the Small Sofa could be used is in a small home in a big city. The home is made to use space well, and the Small Sofa is the perfect size for the room. It can be easily moved to make different seating places, and its not having a lot of decoration means that it doesn't take up too much look space. Also, the sofa's lasting materials and useful design make it a useful choice for a busy city life.\n\nWords to learn:\n- Simplicity: Easy and not complicated.\n- Design: A plan or drawing of something that will be made.\n- Sofa: A comfortable seat wide enough for two/three people to sit on.\n- Strong material: Something that is hard to break or damage.\n- Comfortable: Feeling good when you sit, lie, or walk on it.\n\nWhat we learned today:\nToday, we learned about simple furniture design and how to make a sofa comfortable and strong. We talked about how we can use this knowledge in our daily life. By knowing about simple designs, we can make better choices when we help our parents to pick furniture or even when we arrange our toys.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 466, "idx": 601347, "original text": "Le Corbusier Petite Sofa.

{"text": "Lesson: Making Things with Light\n\n## Section 1: Simple Ideas\n\nMaking Things with Light (MTL) is a way to make stuff that looks like what we see in nature. We use a special light to make a special kind of goo hard. This goo can hold things like tiny living things in a certain way. It's like making a little home for them that looks like what they might have in nature.\n\nThe MTL way of doing things works by making the special goo hard with a light that we can see. Here is how we do it:\n\n1. Getting the goo ready: We mix the goo with the tiny living things and other things to make a kind of soup.\n2. Using the light: We shine the light on the soup. The light makes the goo hard in certain places, making a kind of pattern. The pattern holds the tiny living things and other stuff.\n3. Cleaning up: We wash away the soup that didn't get hard. This leaves behind the pattern made of hard goo with the tiny living things and other stuff.\n\n## Section 2: Fun Projects\n\nWe have made some cool stuff using the MTL way of doing things, like:\n\n1. Tiny living thing houses: We can make a kind of grid with the goo. The grid holds the tiny living things. This can help us learn about how they move and grow.\n2. Tiny wells: We can make tiny wells in the goo. We can put the tiny living things in these wells and watch them. We can make the wells different shapes and sizes to see how the tiny living things act in different places.\n3. Tiny capsules: We can make tiny capsules with the goo that hold the tiny living things. These capsules can be put into a bigger living thing to help it get better. This can help with giving medicine, helping things grow, and fixing things that are broken in the body.\n4. Seeding: We can make things with the goo that we put the tiny living things on. We can then put these things into a bigger living thing to help it grow new parts or fix old parts.\n\n## Section 3: Let's Think about This\n\n1. What are some things we might be able to do with the MTL way of doing things?\n   - Helping things grow: We can use the MTL way to make stuff that looks like what we find in nature. This lets us learn about how tiny living things behave and grow new parts.\n   - Giving medicine: We can use the MTL way to make tiny capsules filled with medicine. These capsules can be put into a bigger living thing to give it medicine in just the right place.\n   - Fixing broken things: We can use the MTL way to make stuff that has tiny living things that have been changed. We can put these into a bigger living thing to help it fix things that are broken. What are some things we need to think about with the printing tool?\n   - Picture quality: The printing tool can only make pictures that are about the size of a small dot, which might not be good enough for some things we want to do.\n   - Size: The printing tool can only make things that are not too big or too complicated.\n   - Safety: Using water jelly and other stuff in the printing process might cause safety problems.\n\n## Words to Remember\n\n- Printing tool: A way to make 3D shapes using living things and other stuff.\n- Light-sensitive stuff: Stuff that changes when light shines on it.\n- Water Jelly: A squishy, water-soaking thing that can be used safely in the printing tool.\n- Light-starter: A thing that starts a change when light shines on it.\n- Cell bubble: Making bubbles that have living things inside and can be put into a living thing.\n- Cell planting: Making shapes that have living things inside, which can then be put into a living thing to help it grow or fix it.\n\n## The End\n\nThe printing tool is a cool thing for bio-printing, with possible uses in tissue making, medicine delivery, and gene therapy. But, there are still things we need to think about like picture quality, size, and safety. By understanding the ideas and examples of the printing tool, kids can learn more about the possibilities and limits of this tool and use what they learn for new problems in the field of bio-printing.", "source": "minipile", "s": 8, "len": 829, "idx": 273662, "original text": "A Novel, Well-Resolved Direct Laser Bioprinting System for Rapid Cell Encapsulation and Microwell Fabrication.\nA direct laser bioprinting (DLBP) system is introduced in this work.

{"text": "Lesson: How to Check for Sickness at Home\n\n### Overview\nIn this lesson, we will learn how to do a simple home test for sickness. This test is designed to find a tiny sign in the body that tells us if there is sickness. The test is easy and can be done at home using some pee collected in the morning.\n\n### Things You Need\nTo do this home test, you will need the following things:\n- A clean, dry jar for collecting the pee\n- A timer or stopwatch\n- A thermometer (if you want)\n- A scale (if you want)\n\n### Steps\n1. Collect your pee in the jar in the morning when you first wake up. This is because the first pee of the day gives better and more same levels than pees taken later in the day.\n2. Pour the pee into the clean, dry jar. Make sure that the jar is dry and free of anything bad.\n3. Use a timer or stopwatch to start the time as soon as you begin peeing. Stop the timer when the pee flow stops.\n4. Write down the time it took to collect the pee on the jar.\n5. If you want to measure the heat of the pee, use a thermometer to take the heat. Write down the heat on the jar.\n6. If you want to measure how much pee is in the jar, use a scale to weigh the jar with the pee. Write down the weight on the jar.\n7. Send the jar to the place for checking.\n\n### Understanding\nThe test checks the level of a tiny sign in the blood. This tiny sign is a protein made by the body, and high levels of it can show the presence of sickness. However, the level can also be high due to other conditions, such as an enlarged body part or inflammation. Therefore, it is important to talk with a health person before doing this test.\n\n### Practice\n1. What are the good things about doing a home pee test for sickness?\n- One good thing is that it is easy to do the test at home without having to go to a doctor's office.\n- Another good thing is that it is less bother than a body check, which involves putting a finger into the body to feel for any bad things.\n- Finally, being able to give a pee sample at home that can be sent off for checking could give important information about whether a sickness is bad or 'low risk'.\n\n### Words to Know\n- Tiny Sign: A thing that is used as a sign of a certain body condition or action\n- Body check: A test where a doctor puts a wet, gloved finger into the body to feel for any bad things\n- Tough: Being very strong or acting in a way that might hurt\n- Safe: Not likely to cause harm or hurt", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 477, "idx": 348456, "original text": ".

Not having enough things to play: Many friends who are different don't have good places to play or things to play with, making it hard for them to play well.\n\n2. Not being treated fairly: Friends who are different have been treated badly because of their skin color, if they are a boy or a girl, or where they come from. This has included not being allowed to play or having mean things said and done to them.\n\n3. Being put in a box: Friends who are different have been thought of as being naturally good but not smart or hardworking enough to play well.\n\n4. Speaking different languages: Some friends who are different have trouble talking to their coaches and friends because they speak a different language.\n\n## Part 4: Big Wins for Different Friends in Sports\n\nEven with the hard times they have faced, different friends have done great things in sports.

{"text": "Story: Beginning to Understand Letting Fees\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nRent money is what kids give to their grown-ups or helpers when they want to play in a special place. This rent money can include asking money, helping money, sharing money, and other kinds of money. In this story, we will learn about the history of rent money, why we have it, and how it affects kids.\n\n**History of Rent Money:**\n\nRent money has been around for a very long time. In the old days, grown-ups would ask kids for money to let them play in their special places. This money was often a lot and it made many kids unable to play in their favorite places. In the late 20th century, rent money became more common as more kids started to play in special places instead of their own homes.\n\n**Reasons for Rent Money:**\n\nGrown-ups ask for rent money for several reasons. One reason is to cover the cost of telling everyone about their special place and checking if the kids who want to play there are nice. Another reason is to make up for the loss of things they experience when a kid stops playing there. Grown-ups also say that rent money helps them cover the costs of keeping their special places nice and providing services such as fixing and cleaning.\n\n**Impact of Rent Money:**\n\nRent money can have a big effect on kids. It can make it hard for kids to move into a new special place, especially if they have to give a lot of rent money. Also, rent money can be a big problem for kids who don't have a lot of money, making it harder for them to play in their favorite places. Lastly, rent money can create a sense of not fair power between grown-ups and kids, with grown-ups having all the power.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn this story, we learned about the history of rent money, why we have it, and how it affects kids. We also talked about how this money can create a not fair power dynamic between grown-ups and kids. As we continue our study of the special place market, we will look for ways to solve these problems and promote fairness for everyone involved.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1755, "idx": 397320, "original text": "News\n\nGovernment to introduce Draft Tenant Fees Bill\n\nGB News: 01/11/2017 - 11:48\n\nCommunities Secretary Sajid Javid has revealed that a new draft Tenant Fees Bill will be introduced to Parliament to ban letting fees.\n\nWith evidence showing that the level of fees charged are often not clearly or consistently explained, the bill will set out the government\u2019s approach to banning letting fees for tenants, helping millions of renters by bringing an end to costly upfront payments.\n\nOver 90 per cent of tenants who responded to the government consultation backed the action to ban letting agent fees, with seven out of 10 saying these fees affected their ability to move into a new rented property.\n\nThe government hopes to prevent agents from double charging both tenants and landlords for the same services and has also launched a consultation on making membership of client money protection schemes mandatory for letting and managing agents that handle client money.\n\nThe draft Tenant Fees Bill will cap holding deposits at no more than one week\u2019s rent and security deposits at no more than six weeks\u2019 rent, and will also create a civil offence with a fine of \u00a35,000 for an initial breach of the ban on letting agent fees and creating a criminal offence where a person has been fined or convicted of the same offence within the last five years.\n\nJavid said: \u201cThis government is determined to make sure the housing market works for everyone.

{"text": "**Lesson: Introduction to Magic Coins**\n\n**Section 1: What are Magic Coins?**\n\nMagic Coins are pretend money in the computer that people can use to buy things. They are safe because they are hidden by secret codes. No one controls them, not even a bank or a government. \n\n**Section 2: How do Magic Coins work?**\n\nMagic Coins use a magic book to keep track of who has what. This magic book is made of lots of pieces that are put together in order. Each piece has a list of who gave what to whom and a clue to find the piece before it. This makes it hard for anyone to cheat, because they would have to change all the pieces that come after. \n\nComputers that have the Magic Coin program check each time someone gives or gets Magic Coins. The first computer to check and say it's okay gets new Magic Coins as a reward. This is like a game.\n\n**Section 3: Kinds of Magic Coins**\n\nThere are many kinds of Magic Coins, like Gold Coin, Silver Coin, Red Coin, and Light Coin. Each one is special in its own way. For example, Gold Coin was made to be used like real money, while Silver Coin was made to help computers talk to each other. \n\n**Section 4: Good and Bad things about Magic Coins**\n\nGood things about Magic Coins are that they cost less to use, they are quick, they are safe, and no one knows who is using them. But, bad things are that their price can go up and down a lot, not everyone accepts them, and some people might not like them.\n\n**Section 5: How to use Magic Coins**\n\nLet's say you want to get some Magic Coins. You would first need to make a magic box in your computer to keep your coins. Next, you would go to a Magic Coin shop, like CoinPlace or CoinHome, and make an account. You would then put some real money into your shop account and use it to buy Magic Coins. Once you have the coins, you can put them in your magic box and use them to buy things or keep them for later.\n\n**Word List**\n\n- Magic Book: A magic book that keeps track of who has what.\n- Computer: A machine that runs the Magic Coin program and checks when someone gives or gets Magic Coins.\n- Game: The fun of checking when someone gives or gets Magic Coins and adding them to the magic book, getting new coins as a gift.\n- Digital Wallet: A computer program that keeps your special coins.\n- Exchange: A place where you can get and give special coins.\n\n**End**\n\nSpecial coins are an exciting and big topic that has many good points and hard points.

We will learn how this drug is given, its effects on the heart and blood, and how it can help and hurt patients with a recent heart problem.\n\nPart 1: Understanding the Medicine\n\nTopic 1: What is the medicine?\nThe medicine is a drug used to treat bad heart beats and to help stop serious problems after a heart problem. It works by blocking some things in the body that make the heart beat wrong.\n\nTopic 2: How is the medicine given?\nThe medicine is usually given as a shot in a hospital. The right amount of medicine to take depends on how much the person weighs and how sick they are.\n\nChapter 2: What Bretylium Tosylate Does to the Heart\n\n**Topic 2.1: What Happens to the Heart**\nIn people who have had a heart problem, bretylium tosylate can make the heart beat very fast, then very slow. It can also make their blood pressure go up and down. These changes can lead to more blood going to the leg muscles, but the heart doesn't pump more blood.\n\n**Topic 2.2: Studying on Cat Muscle**\nBretylium tosylate can also affect a part of a cat's heart muscle. Scientists have found that it can stop the heart from beating harder when it needs to.\n\nChapter 3: Good and Bad Things About Bretylium Tosylate\n\n**Topic 3.1: Helping People with a Sick Heart**\nFor people with a sick heart after a heart problem, bretylium tosylate may help. But scientists still need to learn more about how it works.\n\n**Topic 3.2: The Danger of Low Blood Pressure**\nWhile bretylium tosylate might help some people with a sick heart, it needs to be used carefully because it can make the blood pressure too low. This is especially dangerous for people who already have low blood pressure or are taking other medicines that can make their blood pressure low.\n\nIn the End:\nIn this lesson, we learned about what bretylium tosylate does to the heart. We learned how it is used and what good and bad things can happen.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About How Our Body Fights Germs\n\nIntroduction:\nOur body has a special way of fighting germs. This is done by some special cells in our body called white blood cells. They can go through the walls of our blood vessels to reach the place where the germs are. This helps our body to stay healthy. But we still don't know a lot about how this works.\n\nObjective:\nThe goal of this lesson is to learn about a special thing in our body. It's called PAF and it helps our white blood cells fight germs.\n\nSection 1: Basic Information\n- IL-1 is something in our body that helps us fight germs. It is made by some special cells in our body when we are sick or hurt.\n- PAF is another special thing in our body. It helps with many things, including fighting germs.\n\nSection 2: Our Experiment\n- In our study, we looked at the white blood cells in rats.\n- We gave the rats different things and then looked at their white blood cells.\n\nSection 3: What We Found\n- In rats that got IL-1, their white blood cells were better at fighting germs.\n- This was because PAF was helping the white blood cells.\n- This means that PAF helps our white blood cells fight germs when we get IL-1.\n\nSection 4: What We Think\n- Our findings suggest that PAF helps our white blood cells fight germs early on.\n- We need to learn more about how PAF helps and what else is involved.\n\nSection 5: Wrapping Up\n- We've learned that PAF might help our white blood cells fight germs when we get IL-1.\n- Knowing how this works is important. It can help us find new ways to keep our body healthy.\n\nGlossary:\n- Small protein: a tiny part of a cell that sends messages to help our body fight germs.\n- Signaling molecule: a special part of a cell that sends signals and helps with many things in our body.\n- Technique: a way of doing something. We used a special technique to look at live cells and tissues.\n\nChat Time:\n- How does the sticky stuff on the outside of little health soldiers change their moving?\n- Could other small helpers also change the moving of little health soldiers?\n- What are the fun things we can do after understanding how the little health soldiers move?", "source": "minipile", "s": 8, "len": 1843, "idx": 365165, "original text": "Interleukin-1-induced leukocyte extravasation across rat mesenteric microvessels is mediated by platelet-activating factor.\nAlthough our understanding of the molecular interactions that mediate the adhesion of leukocytes to venular endothelial cells has greatly expanded, very little is known about the mechanisms that mediate the passage of leukocytes across the vessel wall in vivo. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of endogenously formed platelet-activating factor (PAF) in the process of leukocyte extravasation induced by interleukin-1 (IL-1). To determine at which stage of emigration PAF was involved, we studied the behavior of leukocytes within rat mesenteric microvessels by intravital microscopy. Rats were injected intraperitoneally with saline, recombinant rat IL-1 beta (IL-1 beta), or the peptide N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) 4 hours before the exteriorization of the mesenteric tissue. In animals treated with IL-1 beta there was a significant increase in the number of rolling and adherent leukocytes within venules (20- to 40-micron diameter) and in the number of extravasated leukocytes in the tissue. Pretreatment of rats with the PAF receptor antagonist UK-74,505 had no effect on the leukocyte responses of rolling and adhesion, but significantly inhibited the migration of the leukocytes across the vessel wall induced by IL-1 beta (76% inhibition). A structurally unrelated PAF antagonist, WEB-2170, produced the same effect (64% inhibition). However, in contrast, UK-74,505 had no effect on the leukocyte extravasation induced by FMLP, indicating selectivity for the response elicited by certain mediators. These results provide the first line of direct evidence for the involvement of endogenously formed PAF in the process of leukocyte extravasation induced by IL-1 in vivo.", "hash": "1b3c0be998a30103abd685a6eeb2cffe5bcecda5abd13f7ebc91a2d4f358d569"}
{"text": "\n\nStory Time: Learning about Money Clubs\n\n## Chapter 1: What is a Money Club?\nA money club is a place where friends help each other with their money. It's like a money store but not for making money. Friends in a money club put their money together, which they then lend to other friends. This makes a sharing space where friends help each other with their money dreams.\n\n## Chapter 2: How does a Money Club work?\nMoney clubs work by taking money from friends and lending them to other friends. The little extra money from lending is used to pay for things and give a little back to friends. Money clubs have to follow rules from big people to make sure they are good for their friends.\n\n## Chapter 3: Good things about joining a Money Club\nThere are many good things about joining a money club, like:\n- Lower costs: Money clubs usually ask for less money than money stores for things like money boxes and cash machines.\n- More money: Money clubs often give more money for saving accounts and special saving accounts than money stores.\n- Nice service: Money clubs are known for being nice and caring about their friends' needs.\n- Helping the neighborhood: Many money clubs help their neighborhood and support local helpers and groups.\n\n## Chapter 4: Different Money Boxes in Money Clubs\nMoney clubs have different types of money boxes for their friends, like:\n- Sharing saving box: This is the simplest box in a money club. Friends put money into their sharing saving box and earn a little extra.\n- Money box: Money clubs have money boxes that let friends write money letters and put in and take out money.\n- Special money boxes: These boxes give more money than usual saving boxes and let friends write a few money letters.\n- Special saving boxes: Special saving boxes are saving boxes that give more money for a certain time, usually from half a year to five years.\n\n## Chapter 5: How to join a Money Club\nTo join a money club, you usually need to be special, like living or working in a certain place or being part of a special group. You will need to show who you are and fill out a joining paper. Once you are accepted as a friend, you can open money boxes and start using the money club's services.\n\n## Word Fun:\n- Sharing: Sharing is when a friend puts money into a money club.\n- Little Extra: Little extras are the extra money given to friends by the money club.\n- Saving Money: Saving money is when you keep some of your money for the future.\n- Running Costs: These are the things we need to pay for to keep a savings club running, like paying for the place and the people who work there.\n- Rules: Savings clubs have rules from the big people in charge to make sure they are helping their members.\n\nEnd Thoughts:\nBeing part of a savings club can be a good way to keep money for later and get special money services. By learning about the good things of savings clubs and the different ways they can keep your money, you can decide if a savings club is good for you. With a little looking and learning, you can find a savings club that is just right for you and helps you reach your money dreams.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 754, "idx": 428689, "original text": "Wisconsin Lutheran credit union, and registering for elective discussion sections and seminars.

{"text": "Story: Learning about the Big Fuel Companies \nBeginning:\nBig fuel companies are very important. They give us fuel for our cars, heat our homes, and help our businesses work. But, we don't often think about how they affect our world. In this story, we will talk about how big fuel companies change our environment, our towns, and our rules.\nPart 1: How Big Fuel Companies Change the Environment\nTopic 1: Changing Weather\nOur world is facing a big challenge with changing weather. When we burn fuels like oil, it makes gases that warm up our world. This can make glaciers melt, sea levels rise, and more storms happen.\nTopic 2: Dirty Air\nBig fuel companies also make the air dirty, which can make people and animals sick. When we burn oil, it makes tiny particles and harmful stuff that go into the air. This can make it hard to breathe, hurt our hearts, and even make us very sick.\nPart 2: How Big Fuel Companies Change Our Towns\nTopic 1: Jobs\nA big way that fuel companies change our towns is by making jobs. The fuel business gives many people jobs all over the world, giving them money to live. But, these jobs can be dangerous and can hurt the environment.\nTopic 2: Money for the Government\nFuel companies also give a lot of money to our government. In many places, fuel companies give money from their profits to the government. This money helps pay for things like schools, hospitals, and roads. But, some people think these companies should give more money.\nPart 3: How Big Fuel Companies Change Our Rules\nTopic 1: Making Decisions\nBig fuel companies have a lot of power to make decisions, both in their own places and in other places. They use a lot of money every year to try to change rules that affect their business. Some people think this power is not good for fairness, as it lets big companies change rules for their own good.\nTopic 2: Arguments\nThe fuel business also causes arguments. Places that have a lot of oil can have a lot of power, as other places need them for energy. This can lead to fights over who gets to use the oil and who controls places with lots of oil.\nEnding:\nIn the end, big fuel companies change our world a lot, both in good ways and bad ways. They give us the fuel we need for our lives, but they also cause problems for our environment and our society. It's important to understand these changes and try to find ways to make things better for our towns, our world, and our rules.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 800, "idx": 208595, "original text": "It looks like you're using an Ad Blocker..

{"text": "Story: Guessing Secret Words\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a magical world where everything was about guessing secret words. Let's learn how to guess the secret words!\n\nChapter 1: Guessing Secret Words\n\nIn this magical world, secret words have their own special rules. We use a special symbol, like a star, to talk about when a certain secret word might be guessed. We also use two stars when we are talking about guessing this secret word or that secret word.\n\nChapter 2: The Secret Word Game\n\nIn the secret word game, the secret words are made of 6 little parts. Each part could be any of the 26 letters (a-z) or any of the 10 numbers (0-9). Big letters are not used in the game. We will try to guess the secret words.\n\nChapter 3: Guessing the Secret Words\n\nFirst, let's learn how to guess a secret word. It's like playing a game: \n\nIf we want to guess a secret word that starts with a letter that is also a singing letter (a, e, i, o, u), we have to see how many secret words start with a singing letter and then see how many secret words there are in total. \n\nSimilar to this, we can also try to guess a secret word that ends with an even number (0, 2, 4, 6, 8). We just need to see how many secret words end with an even number and how many secret words there are in total.\n\nNext, we need to guess both a secret word starting with a singing letter and ending with an even number. We just need to guess one and then the other.\n\nLastly, we need to guess a secret word that starts with a singing letter or ends with an even number. We just need to guess one or the other.\n\nChapter 4: The Secret Word Game \n\nNow, let's play the game and guess the secret words.\n\n1. For the secret word starting with a singing letter: There are 5 singing letters (a, e, i, o, u) and 5 * 5 = 25 secret words that start with a singing letter.\n\n2. For the secret word ending with an even number: There are 5 even numbers (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) and 2 * 5 = 10 secret words that end with an even number.\n\n3. For both a secret word starting with a singing letter and ending with an even number, we just need to guess one and then the other.\n\n4. For a secret word that starts with a singing letter or ends with an even number, we just need to guess one or the other.\n\nAnd that's how we play the secret word game! Adding numbers: A + B - C = (1/2^6) + (2/2^6) - (10/2^7) = 20/2^6.\n\nEnd:\n\nIn this story, we learned how to add numbers with a fun game about guessing computer passwords. We used simple math to find A, B, C, and A + B. This is fun and helpful in many games and puzzles.", "source": "minipile", "s": 8, "len": 1912, "idx": 479056, "original text": "Q:\n\nProbability question about guessing computer passwords\n\nJust doing some preparation for an exam, \nA computer system uses passwords that are $6$ characters and each character is one of the $26$ letters (a-z) or $10$ integers (0-9). Uppercase letters are not used. \nLet $A$ be the event that a password begins with a vowel (either a, e, i, o or u) and let $B$ denote the event that a password ends with an even number (either 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8). Suppose a hacker selects a password at random. What are the probabilities $P(A)$, $P(B)$, $P(A \\cap B)$ and $P(A \\cup B)$ ?\nWith $P(A)$ the way I've thought about it (though I think it's wrong) is:\nPasswords have 6 characters: __ __ __ __ __ __\nThe total number of passwords is therefore (26 Letters + 10 numbers)$^6$ or $36^6$ by the multiplicative law of probability\n36 36 36 36 36 36\nBut a password which begins with a vowel (5 letters to choose) would be \n5 36 36 36 36 36\ntherefore being $(5*36^5)/36^6 = 5/36$\nbut that doesn't feel right.. I think what that gives me is the probability of there being at least one vowel, not necessarily being at the start?\n\nA:\n\nYour answer is indeed the probability that there is one vowel. However, this is the same as the probability that the first character is a vowel. Think of it this way: the event A only depends on the first character: the rest can be ignored. This means that the probability you want is the probability that this character is a vowel, which can occur in 5 out of the 36 possibilties, yielding the 5/36 you have calculated another way. \nThe tricky thing about this question is the part where the hacker generates passwords at random. This implies that the characters in the generated password are all independent, which is why it doesn't matter to your calculation that the event A refers to the first character. It could refer to the fifth character; as worded, your answer would come out the same.\n\n", "hash": "11b530c30c5d83ea1a81336c067e8619f3020ce9df86e15984c015fac98dcfd0"}

In this lesson, we will learn about the good things of invisible braces and learn how it works to fix teeth problems.\n\n**Part 1: Introduction to Invisible Braces**\n\n**Topic 1: What are Invisible Braces?**Topic 1: What is Invisalign?**\nThere is a clear thing you can wear to make your teeth straight. This thing is an option instead of the metal pieces you usually put on your teeth. This clear thing is smooth and comfortable. You can hardly see it when it's worn.\n\n**Topic 2: Who can wear this clear thing?**\nAdults and teenagers with healthy teeth and gums can use this clear thing. It can fix many teeth problems, like teeth that are not straight or teeth that bite in the wrong way. This clear thing can even be used to fix jaws that are not properly lined up.\n\n**Topic 3: How does this clear thing work?**\nThis clear thing works by using a set of clear pieces that you can take off to move your teeth to the right place. Every piece is made to fit your teeth and you wear it for about two weeks before you get a new one. These pieces put a gentle push on your teeth to move them to a better position.\n\n**Section 2: Good things about this clear thing**\n\n**Topic 1: It's hard to see**\nOne of the best things about this clear thing is that it's hard to see. Unlike the metal pieces, which you can see easily, you can hardly see this clear thing when it's worn. This is great for people who want to make their teeth straight but don't want others to notice.\n\n**Topic 2: It's comfortable**\nThis clear thing is made of a smooth, comfortable material that fits tightly against your teeth. The metal pieces can sometimes hurt and be uncomfortable, but this clear thing is made to be comfortable to wear. People who use this clear thing usually say they feel less pain and discomfort than those who use the metal pieces.\n\n**Topic 3: You can take it off**\nAnother good thing about this clear thing is that you can take it off. That means you can take it off when you eat, brush your teeth, or play sports or do other physical activities. This makes this clear thing a good choice for people who are always on the go or have busy schedules.\n\n**Section 3: How to wear this clear thing**\n\n**Topic 1: How long to wear it**\nYou should wear this clear thing for about 20 to 22 hours every day to get the best results. You should only take it off when you're eating, brushing, and cleaning between your teeth. If you don't wear it for a day, it can slow down the process, so it's important to wear it all the time.\n\n**Topic 2: How to take care of it**\nYou should clean this clear thing and keep it in its original box when you're not wearing it. You should also clean the box regularly to keep bacteria away.\n- We should not clean our teeth helpers with soap or washing liquid. It can hurt the plastic stuff.\n\n**Topic 3: Visiting the tooth doctor and getting better**\n- People who use teeth helpers must go to their tooth doctor every little while for visits and to get their next teeth helpers.\n- These visits are very important to make sure that the help is going as planned and to make any needed changes to the teeth helpers.\n\n**Words to remember:**\n- **Teeth helper:** A clear, removable plastic thing that is used to make teeth straight.\n- **Teeth straightener:** A fixed teeth helper that is used to make teeth straight.\n- **Tooth doctor:** A tooth expert who helps in finding, stopping, and fixing of tooth and face problems.\n\n**End words:** Teeth helpers are a good choice for people who want to make their teeth straight without using the regular metal teeth straighteners. Its hiding, comfort, and ability to be removed make it a nice choice for grown-ups and teenagers alike. By doing as told in this lesson, people who use teeth helpers can get good results and make their smile better.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 479, "idx": 250130, "original text": "Invisalign\u00ae uses a set of clear, removable plastic aligners to exert gentle pressure on your teeth, encouraging them to move into a more aesthetically pleasing position..

In this study, we demonstrate that transcription factor Relish from the IMD signaling pathway has an important role in the control of A. marginale infection in ticks. We found that RNA-mediated silencing of Relish caused a significant increase in the number of A. marginale in the midgut and salivary glands of R. microplus.

{"text": "Story: Why Change is Good in Business\n\nStart:\nRunning a business means taking chances and making big choices. But, when things change around us, it's important to change too. In this story, we will learn why change is good in business and talk about how smart business people can change their plans to do well in a business world that is always changing.\n\nPart 1: Why Change is Good in Business\n\nTopic 1: What is Change\nChange means being able to get used to new things, places, or ways of doing things. In business, change is very important because it lets companies react well to changes in the business world, what customers want, and new ways of doing things.\n\nTopic 2: Why Change is Important\nThe business world is always changing, and companies that don't change may fall behind others. Change is important because it lets businesses:\n\n- Stay up-to-date: By changing with new trends and new ways of doing things, businesses can stay competitive and meet the changing needs of their customers.\n- Make customers happy: By being flexible and listening to what customers say, businesses can make better things and services that meet what their customers want.\n- Be strong: By being able to change when faced with problems, businesses can get through hard times and other problems more effectively.\n\nTopic 3: Examples of Change in Business\nMany successful companies have shown why change is good in business. For example:\n\n- \"NE Company\": Started as a DVD rental service, \"NE Company\" changed with the rise of online movies by focusing on online content.\n- \"AI Company\": Started as a platform for renting out air beds in living rooms, \"AI Company\" has since grown to offer whole homes, experiences, and even hotel reservations.\n- \"AM Company\": Originally an online bookstore, \"AM Company\" has changed with the changing market by growing into online shopping, cloud computing, and even making its own line of products.\n\nPart 2: How to Become a More Change-Friendly Business\n\nTopic 1: Welcome Change\nThe first step towards becoming a more change-friendly business is to welcome change as a chance to do something new rather than a problem. Companies that see change in a good way and see it as a chance to try new things and grow are more likely to do well in the end.\n\nTopic 2: Always Watch the Market\nTo stay change-friendly, businesses must always watch the market and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and developments. This can be done through learning about the market, looking at what customers say, and knowing about industry news and what other companies are doing.\n\nTopic 3: Make a Culture of New Ideas\nNew ideas are key to change in business. Companies that make a culture of new ideas encourage workers to think in new ways and take calculated risks. This can be achieved through rewards like bonuses for new ideas, regular sessions to think of new ideas, and giving workers chances for learning and growing.\n\nPart 3: Case Study: \"NR Company's\" Change in the Energy Industry\n\nTopic 1: Background\nNorthwest Renewable's first idea was to make fuel from corn at the Mint Farm in early 2008. But, because of money problems and changes in the fuel industry, the company had to make new plans.\n\nTopic 2: New Plan\nInstead of making fuel from corn, Northwest Renewable decided to build a plant that would make bio-fuel from wood chips.\n\nTopic 3: What Happened\nBy changing their plans and using new tools, Northwest Renewable was able to face the problems in the fuel industry and start its new bio-fuel plant.\n\nEnd:\nIn the end, being able to change is very important for businesses in today's fast-changing world. By accepting change, always watching the market, having a culture of new ideas, and being ready to change plans when needed, companies can stay important, make customers happy, and be strong when facing problems. Northwest Renewable's changes in the fuel industry show how smart business people can change their plans to do well in a changing market.\n\nWords to Know:\n- Change: Being able to adjust to new things, places, or conditions.\n- Business: The process of creating, managing, and growing a business.\n- Market: A place where people come to buy or sell things.\n- Competitor: Someone who sells the same things as another business, and who the other business competes with for customers.\n- Trend: A general way things are changing or growing.\n- Strength: Being able to get better quickly after problems.\n- Culture: The beliefs, values, and customs of a group of people.\n- New Ideas: The process of turning new ideas into things that bring value and improvement.\n- Risk: The chance of losing something valuable, like money or time.\n- Learning: Growing and getting better in what you know and can do in your job.\n\nSelf-Debating Discussion:\nHow might the idea of change apply to your personal life? Can you think of any examples where being able to change has helped you face problems or do well?", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 2382, "idx": 188546, "original text": "Monday, August 31, 2009\n\nSmart Entrepreneurs Adapt to the Times\n\nNorthwest Renewable\u2019s original plan was to begin producing corn-based ethanol at the Mint Farm in June 2008.

In the years since, U.S. Ethanol\u2019s parent company, Makad Corp., has been redesigning the plant to incorporate the newest technology and comply with air emission laws, Makad Corp. told The Daily News last November.\n\nAs bankruptcies and shutdown wracked the ethanol industry over the last year, Longview city officials say they\u2019ve been working for several months with Northwest Renewable to develop the biomass power plant project.\n\nNorthwest Renewable LLC has planned construction on a bio-ethanol production plant for Longview, Washington, since 2006. But the economic downturn and shakeups in the ethanol industry caused them to change their plans: they are now planning a cellulosic electricity power generation plant.\n\nNorthwest Renewable, LLC, a Vancouver-based company owned by U.S. Ethanol, estimates the $72.5 million \u201cbiomass\u201d power project will create up to 400 construction jobs and up to 70 permanent jobs through logging and processing of the wood products.\n\nIn addition to jobs, the 24-megawatt \u201cbiomass direct combustion electric power plant\u201d also would significantly add to the city\u2019s tax base when it is complete at 1100 Weber Ave.\n\nVarious wood-waste sources \u2014 including wood chips and hog fuel \u2014 would be burned to generate steam. The high pressure steam would drive a turbine to churn out power. _DailyNews_via_BiofuelsDigest\n\nA lot of maize ethanol projects have shut down, or been abandoned in planning stages. But when a company has already invested millions in an ethanol project, it makes sense to convert the project to something more profitable, if they can.\n\nCellulosic electricity from biomass waste and from planned biomass growth, is a coming industry. As long as governments subsidize unreliable wind and solar plants, the need for reliable baseload backup power will grow. Nuclear may be the best baseload power, but cellulosic electricity from biomass is quite good as well. Wind and solar power plants combined with biomass power plants may eventually provide nuclear-shy California with the bulk of its home-grown electricity.", "hash": "80c2d2cbd3f2653c2acd0f8c656dc8a8ab40a32f7d453c8659d102a443f96a6a"}
{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Circuit Boards\n\n### Overview\nIn this lesson, we will learn about circuit boards, their parts, and what they do. We will learn the simple things about circuit boards, including their history, how they work, and the different kinds of circuit boards. By the end of this lesson, you will know a lot about circuit boards and be able to use this knowledge in real life.\n\n### Section 1: What are Circuit Boards?\nCircuit boards are the base of all electronic devices. They are used to connect and arrange electronic parts, letting them work as they should. A circuit board is a thin, flat piece of stuff, usually made of hard glass or plastic, that holds electronic parts like little things that control electricity, parts that let electricity flow in one direction, and parts that store electricity. These parts are connected by thin lines of a metal that allow electricity to move between the parts.\n\n### Section 2: History of Building Things\nLong ago, people made things by hand. This took a lot of time. Then, they found a new way to make things quickly and easily.\n\n### Section 3: Different Ways of Building Things\nThere are many ways to make things. Here are some examples:\n\n1. Using special paper: This is the most common way. They use a special process to put thin lines on the paper.\n\n2. Mixing different parts: These parts are often used when the thing needs a lot of space.\n\n3. Using many layers: These have many layers that allow for more parts. They are often used in fast, small things like computers and phones.\n\n4. Using flexible materials: These can bend and twist without breaking. They are often used when there is not much space.\n\n### Section 4: How Building Things Work\nMaking things work by connecting parts in a certain way. When you add power to a part, it moves along the lines until it reaches the part it needs. Then, the part does its job, like turning on a light or making a sound louder.\n\n### Section 5: Where We Use These Things\nWe use these things in many places, from small things like lights to big things like computers and satellites. Here are some examples:\n\n1. Home Items: We use these things in many home items, like TVs, radios, and phones.\n\n2. Health Tools: These things are used in health tools like heart helpers.\n\n3. Cars: These things are used in cars for things like windows and brakes.\n\n4. Space: These things are used in satellites and other space things.\n\n### Words to Remember\n- Building Things: A flat piece that holds parts and lets them work the right way.\n- Lines: A thin line that lets power move between parts.\n- Special Process: A way to put thin lines on a material.\n- Mixed Parts: A thing that uses both special paper and other parts.\n- Many Layers: A thing with many layers that can hold more parts.\n- Flexible Things: A thing made from materials that can bend and twist without breaking.\n\n### The End\nBig boards are very important parts of toys that make sounds and lights. They connect and arrange smaller parts to make them work as they should.

Field of the Invention\nThe instant invention relates to a circuit board; in particular, to a circuit board structure with a ceramic resistor embedded therein and a manufacturing method thereof.\n2. Description of Related Art\nA conventional circuit board structure is formed by embedding a resistor in a multi-layer board and soldering the resistor to an inner soldering pad of the multi-layer board. Thus, when an outer soldering pad of the multi-layer board is in a soldering process, the inner soldering pad is easily melted or softened to cause a connection problem between the inner soldering pad and the resistor, such that a resistance value provided from the conventional circuit board structure is not precise.\nMoreover, which embedded resistor of the conventional circuit board structure to use is determined according to a required and specific resistance value, so the conventional circuit board structure cannot achieve different resistance values. In other words, in order to achieve different resistance values, the conventional circuit board structure needs to have a plurality of resistors embedded in the multi-layer board, such that the volume of the conventional circuit board structure is increased, and connection problems between the inner soldering pads and the resistors occur more easily when the outer soldering pad of the multi-layer board is in a soldering process. Accordingly, each resistance value provided from the conventional circuit board structure using these resistors may also not be precise.", "hash": "cf09d1652e509d4bf01251a664e2162f975b51a139efa4106d258996ec79f109"}

The virus is now known to cause clinical and subclinical hepatitis in the United States, Europe and other countries from a zoonotic reservoir in pigs and other animals. Since HEV infection typically causes silent infection in adults, it can also be transmitted by blood transfusion from asymptotic donors. However, despite a few case reports from Europe and Japan and the detection of HEV RNA in plasma pools, the risk of transfusion transmission in the US and elsewhere is unknown. HEV infection in immunocompromised patients, pregnant women and patients with liver disease can have serious morbidity or mortality. In this study we will estimate the risk of transmission of HEV by blood product transfusion by studying three populations. We will study the prevalence of anti-HEV IgM and HEV RNA in a serum repository obtained from 5,000 Chinese blood donors with elevated liver enzymes who were not infected with hepatitis B and C. Secondly, we will measure the rate of sero-conversion among a sample of 11,532 patients enrolled in the NHLBI-funded FACTS study in the early 1990's. In this study, 9,294 patients were transfused with blood products from over 120,000 donors and 2,238 similar subjects were not transfused, who will serve as controls. Third, we will measure the risk of transfusion transmission of HEV in 3,575 patients with RADAR study. The RADAR study is a linked donor-recipient repository. We will test the donors linked to any patients who have sero-converted after their transfusion for evidence of active HEV infection, i.e. HEV RNA and anti-HEV IgM. Strains of HEV from donors and recipients will be sequenced when possible. We will also test 100 mini-pools of 50 plasma samples, i.e. 5,000 individual samples, from the RADAR repository that are unlinked to a recipient. Positive pools will be re-tested sequentially to resolve infectivity of an individual donor. These three inter-related studies will allow us to estimate the level of risk of transmission of HEV by transfusion of blood products. If this risk is confirmed, our data can be used to develop policies for screening donors to prevent the recent documented serious clinical consequences of HEV infection among high risk patients.", "hash": "be6060a2ec91e1db7144e0783609674a677c36101e65d3f1eb314e404f75423e"}

{"text": "Lesson: Introduction to Group Relations\nIntroduction:\nGroup relations talk about the talks between group leaders and friends in a group or team. These talks are very important in deciding the play conditions, treats, gifts, and other parts of the play. This lesson will introduce group relations, including their history, importance, and key ideas.\nHistory:\nGroup relations have a long history, going back to the big change in the late 18th centry. As more people moved from the country to the city to work in big buildings, there were big changes in the way people lived and played. This led to new problems, such as friend use, unsafe play conditions, and low treats. As a result, friends began to come together and form groups to ask for better play conditions and treats. Group leaders also formed teams to show their interests. Over time, these talks have become a system of group relations that includes group talks, play laws, and other ways to control the relationship between group leaders and friends.\nImportance:\nTalking nicely to others is very important because it can change the lives of lots of people and their families. It can change everything from how much money people get, to how they feel at work. If people talk nicely to each other at work, they can do their jobs better, not leave their jobs often, and feel happier. But if people don't talk nicely to each other at work, it can cause problems. This can hurt both the workers and the people they work for.\n\nImportant Things to Know:\nThere are several important things to know about talking nicely to others. These include:\n1. Group talking: This is when people who work together and their bosses talk about important things like how much money they will get, and how they will work. Group talking is a big part of talking nicely to others, as it lets workers have a say in how they work.\n2. Work rules: These are rules that decide how bosses and workers should act. They include rules about how much money workers should get, and rules that protect workers from bad things. Work rules are there to make sure that workers are treated nicely and that bosses have a good team.\n3. Worker groups: These are groups that care about the workers. Worker groups talk with the bosses to decide things like how much money workers will get, and how they will work. Worker groups also help workers have a say in their work and look after their needs.\n4. Boss groups: These are groups that care about the bosses. Boss groups talk with worker groups to decide things for their members and give help to them so they can manage their teams better.\n\nIn the end:\nTalking nicely to others is a big part of today's world. It can change the lives of lots of people and their families. By knowing the history, how important it is, and the big parts of talking nicely to others, we can understand better the difficult relationships between bosses and workers. This knowledge can be used in many different jobs and situations, making it a good thing to know for anyone interested in the world of work.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 865, "idx": 254059, "original text": "Dear Member, In 2013, the Australian Trainers\u2019 Association (ATA) Federal Executive commissioned Laysell Consultancy to conduct a study on its business model and operations.

They want to make things better by questioning the way things are now. Some people want to make changes in the world, and they can do this in many ways, like holding signs and saying what they want, or not doing what they are told to do.\n\n**Chapter 2: The Big Event in HK City**\n\nThere was a big event in HK City. This event started in a month during 2014. People wanted things to be more fair in HK City. This was something that was supposed to happen when a big country gave HK City to CH city.\n\n**Chapter 3: People in the Big Event**\n\nThe big event in HK City had many people. These people were students, teachers, people with jobs, and normal people. The big event was led by a group of student leaders who planned the event and talked with the people in charge.\n\n**Chapter 4: What They Did in the Big Event**\n\nThe big event in HK City did several things to get what they wanted. These included:\n\n- Holding signs and saying what they want: They did this in a busy place in HK City, which made it hard for cars and businesses.\n- Not doing what they are told: Some people did not do what they were told, like not moving when the police told them to.\n- Using the internet: They used the internet to plan the event and tell more people about it.\n- Talking with the people in charge: The student leaders met with the people in charge to tell them what they want and find a peaceful way to make things better.\n\n**Chapter 5: What Happened Because of the Big Event**\n\nThe big event in HK City made a big change in HK City and other places. The event made it hard for people to move around the city and do business, and many people knew about the event in HK City and in other countries.\n\nEven though they did not get everything they wanted, they did make more people know about the need for things to be more fair in HK City. The big event also made similar events happen in other parts of CH city, like a place in CH city called Tibet.\n\n**Words to Know:**\n- Big event: A group of people who come together to say what they want or not do what they are told to make changes.\n- Fairness: A way of deciding things where everyone has a say, either by saying what they want or by choosing people to say what they want for them.\n- Not doing what they are told: When people do not do what they are told to show they do not agree with something.\n\n**The End:**\n\nThe big event in HK City shows how big events can make things better. By planning peacefully and doing smart things, the big event made more people know about the need for things to be more fair in HK City.

The protests were shut down by police in early 2015, but, last week, activists took to the streets again to send both the Hong Kong Government and the mighty Chinese Government that they were in it for the long haul.\n\nOccupy\u2019s goal is for Hong Kong to gain its long-promised Democracy, on par with other developed economic around the world. Behind the protests are concerns about living costs, limited infrastructure, and rising inequality in the tiny nation-state.\n\nThis article also appeared in The News Hub\n\nThus far, Occupy Hong Kong, also known as the Umbrella Movement, has remained in the city. The protests have not spread to mainland China \u2013 but Hong Kong is not the only place in China where discontent is leading to action. In Chinese-occupied Tibet, which has been under de-facto martial law for years, and remains a no-man\u2019s land for foreign journalists and NGOs, there has a been a spurt of horrific self-immolations, which experts cite as a reaction to massive public anger at Chinese oppression combined with nearly no space for safe civic discourse.\n\nNearby, in occupied East Turkestan (in Chinese Xinjiang) the shift has, sadly, turned violent with the deadly knife attack by Uighur militants in Kunming, Yunnan the most noteworthy example, an attack that was followed by mass public convictions in Urumqi, the latest in what is becoming an even more vicious cycle of violence and repression.\n\nChina\u2019s Role\n\nChina\u2019s shadow looms large not just within its borders, but abroad as well. The authoritarian superpower, who has been accused of propping up dictatorial regimes across the world, has been a focal point for protests not only in Hong Kong and Taiwan, but also in South Korea, where activists have cited the recently announced free trade deal with China as an example of President Park Park Geun-hye\u2019s incessant, possibly corrupt collusion with business and disregard for regular Korean peoples interests, especially those of farmers who stand to lose greatly.\n\nIn Thailand, where the recent coup created a new, Military-led, Constitution-less Government which subsequently took steps to curb public debate, media freedom, and citizen power, Thailand new military leaders met with officials from China, one of the few countries to not denounce the blatantly anti-Democratic steps taken by the Thai elite.\n\nThis demonstrates a key point \u2013 the protests in Hong Kong do not exist in a bubble. They are intimately connected to what is happening throughout the region.\n\nThe Future\n\nWhat does this mean for the future of not only Occupy, but China and Asia has a whole? Being the world\u2019s most populous continent, Asia\u2019s vast geographic, cultural, and economic differences between OECD members South Korea and Japan, Hong Kong\u2019s hybrid status, still developing Indonesia and Thailand and still-occupied Tibet and East Turkestan, make comparisons challenging and coordination nearly impossible.\n\nAnd therein lies the problem.\n\nProtests can take place in Hong Kong partly due to the city-state\u2019s special status, which allows for an enlarged civic space that fellow \u201cChinese\u201d citizens in Tibet and East Turkestan, not to mention Beijing, can only dream off. Remember, it was only 25 years ago that China had its own youth uprising, when students took to the streets across the country and, most famously, in Tiananmen square.\n\nOn a recent trip to Chengdu, also a hotspot in 1989, the author noticed buses of police at all of the city\u2019s main gathering spots, which local observers stated was a recent phenomenon related both to Occupy Hong Kong, and the turmoil in East Turkestan. The Chinese Communist Party obviously fears something. But ask students at Occupy Central if they believe their movement will spread to the mainland and the answer is \u201cChina will never allow it.\u201d Or, worse, \u201cChinese don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nHong Kong protests because it fears it will become China, or, worse, like occupied Tibet. But it won\u2019t stand up for Chinese or Tibetans. Yet, Hong Kong cannot win unless China changes, which means it cannot win until Tibet is free.\n\nIn the end, this may be the movement\u2019s downfall \u2013 the lack of solidarity throughout the region.\n\nYouth and Hope\n\nNevertheless, this is only the start. Occupy\u2019s 2014 movement galvanized the world, and was focused not on building revolutions to sweep aside old powers, but to bring concrete changes to a society and increase citizens ability to have a say in that society. Change rarely happens in a year, and a greater role of youth and technology could bridge the gaps between the movements \u2018goals and its current capacity.\n\nYoung people throughout Asia have access to new ideas through the Internet and more readily share information on a global scale through social media. Changing demographics such as the \u201cyouth bulge\u201d will have a large impact on Asia and programs that engage young people in the political process will be essential in the years ahead.\n\nRemember, Hong Kong is tiny. Its population is just 7.2 million, barely .5% of China. Moreover, its economy, which, in 1998, when it rejoined the mainland, was 18% of China, is now just 3%. China does not fear Hong Kong on its own \u2013 it is no longer big enough to effect the mainland \u2013 but what it does fear is a broader social movement connecting Hong Kong, Tibet, East Turkestan along with migrant workers in Guangdong province, students in Beijing, and the millions who were oppressed by the Communist parties during the Cultural Revolution or the recent purges against Human Rights activists. That is what China fears. But keeping the movement focused on Hong Kong, Occupy leaders are foreshadowing its own failure.\n\nThere is still time, of course, for the movement to grow. This is Asia\u2019s century, and China is on everyone\u2019s radar. Watch the protests closely, because whether they succeed or fail will show what type of Asia China will lead the world in the decades to come.", "hash": "6cc52d1928811a1b6c1cd4fd5e4edfe8df79cb90fb17e00c9b2c2d2fa6a9591a"}
{"text": "Lesson: Understanding Words Can Have More Than One Meaning\n\nIntroduction:\nLanguage helps us talk to each other, but sometimes, words can have more than one meaning. This can make us confused. In this lesson, we will learn about words with more than one meaning and how to understand them better.\n\nSection 1: What are Words With More Than One Meaning?\nWords with more than one meaning are words or sentences that can mean different things. This can make us confused.\n\nSection 2: Why Do Words Have More Than One Meaning?\nThere are a few reasons why words can have more than one meaning, like:\n\n- Different meanings: Some words can mean more than one thing. This can make it hard to know what the word means. For example, the word \"bank\" can mean a place where money is kept or the side of a river.\n- How it's used: The meaning of a word can change based on how it's used. For example, \"I saw her at the store\" could mean you saw a girl at a store or you saw a girl who works at a store.\n- Confusing sentences: Some sentences can be right but still confusing. For example, \"I gave him the book\" could mean that you gave a book to a boy or that you gave a book to someone named \"him.\"\n\nSection 3: How to Understand Words With More Than One Meaning\nTo understand words with more than one meaning, do these things:\n\n1. Read the words carefully and think about how they are used.\n2. Break the sentence into smaller parts and think about each part.\n3. Use other clues, like how the person is acting, to help understand what they mean.\n4. Ask questions to make sure you understand what they mean.\n5. If needed, give more information to make the meaning clear.\n\nSection 4: Examples\nLet's look at some examples to see how to understand words with more than one meaning:\n\nExample 1: \"The chicken is ready to eat.\"\n- Does this mean the chicken is ready to eat, or is it the food that is ready for the chicken to eat?\n- To understand this, ask if the chicken is cooked. If yes, then it means that the chicken is ready for people to eat.\n\nExample 2: \"She gave him the book.\"\n- Does this mean she gave the book to a boy, or did she give it to someone named \"him\"?\n- To understand this, ask who the book was given to.\n\nConclusion:\nWords with more than one meaning can be confusing, but if we follow the steps we learned in this lesson, we can understand them better. By doing this, we can talk to each other better and avoid getting confused. Remember, talking clearly is important for doing well in all things in life.\n\nGlossary:\n- Unclear: Something that can have more than one meaning.\n- Surroundings: The things and events around something that help us understand it.\n- Rules: The steps we follow to put words together to talk or write.\n\nThink and Talk:\nPretend you have to decide what a word means in a story. One person says the word \"bank\" means a place where we keep money. Another person says it means the side of a river. How would you decide what \"bank\" means in the story? Use what we learned today to help you decide.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 442, "idx": 341014, "original text": "Think different\u2026.

{"text": "\n\nLesson: How to Understand the Effect of Gifts from the Government on Choices\nIntroduction:\nSometimes, the government gives money to help certain jobs or activities. These gifts can change the choices people make. In this lesson, we will talk about how to understand the effect of these gifts on choices.\nSection 1: Understanding Government Gifts\nTopic 1: What are government gifts?\nGovernment gifts are money given by the government to help certain jobs or activities. They are usually given to businesses or people to encourage them to do certain things.\nTopic 2: How do government gifts change choices?\nGovernment gifts can change the choices people make. For example, if the government gives money to a company that makes clean energy, more people might want to be part of that job, making it grow. But, if the government stops giving the money, the job might become smaller.\nSection 2: Understanding the Effect of Government Gifts\nTopic 3: Finding out the effect of government gifts\nTo understand the effect of government gifts on choices, you need to find out what jobs or activities get these gifts. You can do this by finding out what the government helps.\nTopic 4: Checking if the government gifts work\nAfter you find out what jobs or activities get the gifts, you need to check if they work. This means you have to look at information about choices, job growth, and new jobs to see if the gifts are helping.\nSection 3: Using the Effect of Government Gifts to Make Choices\nTopic 5: Thinking about the risk of choosing jobs that depend on government gifts\nBefore choosing a job that depends on government gifts, you need to think about the risk of the government stopping the gifts. This means you have to think about what the government might do that could change the job.\nTopic 6: Thinking about other choices\nIf you decide not to choose a job that depends on government gifts, you need to think about other choices. This means you have to find out about other jobs or activities that might grow and do not need help from the government.\nEnding:\nIn the end, looking at how help from the land can change choices is very important for making good choices. By learning about how help from the land can make certain jobs or things more popular, you can find possible dangers and good things, and make good choices based on facts and thinking.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 653, "idx": 329203, "original text": "Is your investment dependent on state subsidies ? responsibleinvestor892405851 Uncategorized June 9, 2018 0 Minutes Here is another example of a #sector which is heavily affected by state #policy: subsidies management can make or break the #solar industry | #ActiveInvesting \u2014 Mara Thon (@mezzamaratona75) June 9, 2018 Advertisements Share this:TwitterFacebookGO companyLike this:Like Loading...

{"text": "Story: Sharing and Receiving\n\n**Beginning**\n\nIn the world of computers, sharing and receiving are two important things we should learn. In this story, we'll understand what sharing and receiving mean, how they are different, and why we should always be careful and follow the rules when we do these things.\n\n**Chapter 1: What is Receiving?**Chapter 1: What is Receiving?**\n\nReceiving is when we get something from another computer or place. This can be games, music, pictures, and many other things. We often receive things from the internet, but we can also receive things from other computers.\n\n**Chapter 2: What is Sharing?**Chapter 2: What is Sharing?**\n\nSharing, however, is when we send something from our computer to another computer or place. This can be when we send emails, share pictures on social media, or store things in the cloud.\n\n**Chapter 3: How are Receiving and Sharing Different?**\n\nThe main difference between receiving and sharing is where the thing is going. Receiving is when we get something from another place, while sharing is when we send something to another place. Another difference is that receiving is often when we get information from the internet, while sharing is often when we share information on the internet.\n\n**Chapter 4: Rules and Safety**\n\nWhen we share and receive, it's very important to follow the rules and keep safe.

It's about making, sharing, and using things. In our story, we will learn the simple ideas of trading and how they work in real life.\n\n## Part 2: Real Life Stories\n\nLet's think about the story of the country UA. The big bank of UA has changed its money to be worth less, making things from other countries more costly and things they sell cheaper. This will probably make prices go up because things from other countries cost more. But, it might also make more people in UA make things and help the country grow.\n\nWe can use the idea of wanting and having to understand this story. When the price of a thing goes up, people want it less, and more of it is available. This leads to a new price. In this story, the higher price of things from other countries will make people want less, which will make the price go even higher.\n\n## Part 3: Talking with Friends\n\nTalk with a friend about the good and bad of changing money to be worth less. It can make things a country sells cheaper, helping the country grow. But, it can also make prices go up and make things from other countries more costly for people.\n\n## Word List\n\n- Wanting and Having: The relationship between how much of a thing people want to buy and how much is available, at different prices.\n- Changing Money: Making the money of a country worth less compared to the money of other countries.\n\n## The End\n\nIn our story, we have learned the simple ideas of trading and used them in a real-life story.

{"text": "Lesson: Let's Learn About Water Pumps\n\n## Part 1: Simple Ideas\n\nA water pump is a tool that can work while it's in the water without breaking. We often use these pumps for things like garden ponds, waterfalls, and more. In this lesson, we will learn the simple ideas about water pumps and their parts.\n\n**Question:** What are the main parts of a water pump?\n\n**Answer:** The main parts of a water pump are the engine, the pump body, the spinning part, and the part that directs the water flow.\n\n**Question:** How does a water pump work?\n\n**Answer:** A water pump works by changing power into motion, and then into pushing water. This process has the following steps:\n\n1. The engine in the pump changes power into motion by making the spinning part move.\n2. The spinning part moves the water.\n3. The part that directs the water flow helps guide the water.\n4. The pump body holds all these parts and is closed tight to stop water from getting inside.\n\n**Question:** What are some kinds of water pumps?\n\n**Answer:** There are many kinds of water pumps, including waste water pumps, basement pumps, and well pumps. Each kind of pump has its own special features and uses.\n\n## Part 2: Real Life Examples\n\nNow that we know the simple ideas of water pumps, let's see some examples of how they are used in real life.\n\n**Example 1:** A person wants to put a water feature in their backyard. They decide to use a water pump to move water and make a waterfall.\n\n**Example 2:** A farmer needs to move water from their pond to their crops. They put a water pump to help with moving the water.\n\n**Example 3:** A town wants to clean up a mess in a local river. They use a water pump to help take the mess out of the water.\n\n## Part 3: Think and Talk \n\nIn this part, we will think and talk to learn how to think carefully.\n\n**Talk Topic:** Should water pumps be used in places where they can get blocked?\n\n**Agree:** Water pumps are made to handle things without getting blocked. In some places, like watering crops, it might be needed to move things or other materials.\n\n**Disagree:** While water pumps are made to handle things, they can still get blocked in some situations. In places where there is a big chance of getting blocked, it may be better to use a different kind of pump or a pump that can handle more.\n\n**End:** At last, choosing to use a water pump in a place where it might get blocked depends on what's happening there. It's important to think about the good things and bad things before deciding.\n\n## Words to Know\n\n- **Water pump:** A type of machine that helps to move water.\n- **Spinner:** A part of the machine that spins to move water.\n- **Helper:** A part of the machine that doesn't move and helps the water go the right way.\n- **Pump home:** The box that holds the motor, spinner, and helper.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 385, "idx": 404813, "original text": "Tsurumi submersible water feature pumps are submersible pumps designed to circulate water in garden ponds, create waterfalls and water features.

{"text": "Lesson: Understanding Simple Tables\n\nStart:\nSimple tables help us to tidy up and show data in a clear way. They are used in many places like school, work, and home to look at and understand data. In this lesson, we will learn why simple tables are important, how to make them, and how to use them to understand things.\n\nMain Point:\nThe main point of this lesson is to teach children how to use simple tables to tidy up, look at, and understand data well.\n\nSection 1: Why Simple Tables Are Important\n\nTopic 1: Tidying Up Data\nSimple tables are very helpful in tidying up lots of data into a format that is easy to read and understand. They help to see patterns, trends, and connections between things.\n\nTopic 2: Looking at Data\nSimple tables also help in looking at data by giving a picture of the data. This makes it easier to spot special things, links, and other data properties.\n\nTopic 3: Understanding Things\nSimple tables are very helpful in understanding things from the data. By looking at the data, we can guess about the group based on the data shown in the table.\n\nSection 2: Making Simple Tables\n\nTopic 1: Knowing the Things\nThe first step in making a simple table is knowing the things that will be in the table. These things can be groups or numbers.\n\nTopic 2: Picking a Style\nThe next step is picking a style for the simple table. There are many styles to pick from, including tabular, pie chart, bar chart, and line graph.\n\nTopic 3: Gathering Data\nOnce the things and style have been picked, the next step is gathering the data. This can be done through asking questions, doing tests, or watching.\n\nSection 3: Using Simple Tables\n\nTopic 1: Seeing Patterns\nOnce the data has been tidied up into a table, we can use it to see patterns and trends. For example, we can look at how often a thing happens to see if it is normal.\n\nTopic 2: Figuring Out Numbers\nSimple tables can also be used to figure out numbers like average, middle, most often, and difference. These numbers can give useful information about the data.\n\nTopic 3: Understanding Things\nAt last, we can use lists to know more about things. By looking at the things in the list, we can guess about many things from the things in the list.\n\nWords to remember:\n- Things: Lots of information that we find and look at.\n- List: A neat way of showing things in lines and rows.\n- Different: A thing or part of a thing, toy, or game that can be different.\n- Way: The look of things in a list.\n- Numbers: Ways to know the middle, different, and shape of things.\n\nTo end:\nIn the end, lists are very important in keeping and showing things in a easy and short way. By using lists, we can see patterns, lines, and relationships between different things, and guess based on the things shown. By doing the steps shown in this lesson, we can make good lists that give important knowledge about the things.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 815, "idx": 452585, "original text": "Categories.

Shops can be small, like a toy shop in your town, or big, like a toy shop that has lots of other shops in different towns. The job of any shop is to get coins by making people happy with what they need and want.\n\n**Part 3: What is Making Things?**\n\nMaking things is the work of starting and looking after a shop. A person who makes things is someone who starts a new shop, using their own coins and hoping to get more coins back. People who make things are good at thinking of new ideas, they like to try new things, and they are not scared to try even if it might not work.\n\n**Part 4: Good Things about People who Make Things**\n\nPeople who make things have lots of good things that help them do well in shops. These good things include:\n\n1. Good ideas: They need to be able to think of new and fun ideas.\n2. Being strong: Starting a shop can be hard, and they need to be strong even when things go wrong.\n3. Trying new things: They must be ready to try new things to reach their dreams.\n4. Change: Things can change quickly, and they must be ready to change too.\n5. Keep trying: Making a shop work takes time, and they must be ready to keep trying even when things are hard.\n\n**Part 5: Let's Think of an Example**\n\nLet's say you want to start a shop selling jam you made at home. You find out that people in your town want jam that is made nearby and tastes really good. You try out different ways to make jam, and in the end, you make a yummy jam that you know people will like. You then spend your time making the jam, putting it in jars, and selling it at a local market. People like your jam, and they tell their friends, so you sell more jam. After a while, you make your shop bigger, selling your jam on the internet and in other shops.\n\n**Part 6: The End**\n\nIn this lesson, we learned about shops and making things. We talked about what it means to start and look after a shop, and we learned about the good things that people who make things have.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning about Adding and Subtracting\n\n# Overview\n\nAdding and subtracting is a part of learning that helps us solve puzzles and problems. It is a very important tool that we use in lots of areas, including counting, sharing, and understanding numbers. In this lesson, we will learn about the basic ideas of adding and subtracting and give examples of how they can be used in everyday life.\n\n# Section 1: Basic Ideas\n\n## Topic 1: Symbols\n\nSymbols are signs that stand for something we don't know yet in a puzzle. They are used to show different things that could happen. For example, in the puzzle \"a + 5 = 10,\" the symbol \"a\" stands for a number that, when we add 5, equals 10.\n\n## Topic 2: Puzzles\n\nA puzzle is a problem that we need to solve. It is used to solve questions by finding the value of the unknown symbol that makes the puzzle true. For example, the puzzle \"a + 5 = 10\" can be solved by finding the value of \"a\" that, when added to 5, equals 10.\n\n## Topic 3: Number Puzzles\n\nNumber puzzles are groups of numbers, symbols, and actions that represent a math problem. They can be used to solve problems by finding the unknown symbol and finding its value. For example, in the number puzzle \"3a + 7,\" the symbol \"a\" stands for an unknown number that, when multiplied by 3 and added to 7, equals a certain number.\n\n## Topic 4: Actions\n\nActions are the things we do to solve puzzles and problems. They include adding, subtracting, and simple multiplying. For example, to solve the puzzle \"a + 5 = 10,\" we can subtract 5 from both sides to get \"a = 5,\" which means that the value of the symbol \"a\" is 5.\n\n# Section 2: Everyday Examples\n\n## Example 1: Solving for \"a\"\n\nImagine you have 10 apples and want to share them with your friends. If you give 5 apples to your friends, how many apples will you have left?\n\nLet \"a\" represent the number of apples you will have left. We can set up the puzzle:\n\na = 10 - 5\n\nSolving for \"a\":\n\na = 5\n\nAfter sharing, you will have 5 apples left.\n\n## Example 2: Sharing\n\nImagine you have a big chocolate bar that weighs 2 pounds and you want to share half of it with your friends. How much chocolate will you give to your friends?\n\nLet \"a\" represent the amount of chocolate you will share. We can make a simple math problem:\n\nx = 2 * 0.20\nx = 0.40 * 2\nx = 0.80\n\nYou will give away 0.80 pounds of candy.\n\n# Part 3: Thinking Hard\n\n## Question: Why is math important?\n\nAnswer: Math is important because it helps us understand and solve problems with unknown amounts. It is used in many areas of learning. By learning math, we can think better and use it in real life.\n\n## Question: How does math relate to the real world?\n\nAnswer: Math is used in real life to solve problems. For example, in money matters, math is used to calculate how much we earn, borrow, and save. In science, math is used to explain how things work. By understanding math, we can better solve problems in real life.\n\n# Word List\n\n- Unknown: Something we don't know yet.\n- Problem: A question we need to find an answer to.\n- Number: A symbol that represents a certain amount.\n- Process: A step-by-step way to do something.\n- Interest: Money that is added to what we borrow or save.\n- Part: A piece of the whole.\n- Thinking: The action of using your brain to understand something.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 780, "idx": 106097, "original text": "Good Morning!

In this lesson, we will learn the basics of business and how it can help us make good choices and improve how things work.\n\nSection 1: What is Business?\n\nTopic 1: What is Business?\n- Business is about finding out what people need and coming up with ways to meet those needs.\n- It means understanding how things are right now, what we want to achieve, and finding the best way to get there.\n\nTopic 2: What Does a Business Person Do?\n- A business person makes sure that the things made by the workers match what the people need.\n- They collect and write down what is needed, create stories about the users, and work with everyone to make sure the final thing is what they want.\n\nTopic 3: Tools and Techniques of Business\n- Some tools used by business people include making models, drawing maps, looking at strengths and weaknesses, and weighing the costs and benefits.\n- These tools help business people understand how things are right now, find areas to make better, and suggest ways that will make the biggest difference.\n\nSection 2: How to Look at a Toy Shop\n\nTopic 1: Getting to Know the Toy Shop\n- Before we look at a toy shop, it's important to know what the shop has now and what it wants to have.\n- We do this by finding out about the shop's toys, services, customers, other toy shops, and toy trends.\n\nTopic 2: Finding Out What the Toy Shop Needs\n- Once you know the toy shop well, you can start figuring out what it needs.\n- This might mean talking to people, doing surveys, having group talks, or workshops to hear what people think.\n\nTopic 3: What Does Success Look Like?\n- After figuring out what the toy shop needs, the next step is to think about what success means for the shop.\n- This might mean coming up with a big idea or setting specific goals that the shop wants to reach.\n\nTopic 4: Thinking of Solutions\n- Once you know what the toy shop needs, and what success means for it, you can start thinking of possible solutions.\n- This might mean coming up with ideas, making models, or trying different things to see what works best.\n\nSection 3: Using What We Learned in Real Life\n\nTopic 1: Example of Looking at a Toy Shop Online\n- Let's say an online toy shop wants to sell 20% more toys next season.\n- As someone who looks at the shop, your job would be to find out why the shop isn't selling enough toys and suggest ways to fix this problem.\n\nTopic 2: How This Helps in Real Life\n- Looking at a toy shop is a useful skill in many areas, like money matters, health, and tech.\n- For example, someone looking at money matters might look at market trends to find good places to invest money, while someone in health might look at patient data to find ways to make patient care better.\n\nTo Wrap Up:\nIn this lesson, we've learned the basics of looking at a toy shop, including what it means, roles and responsibilities, and common ways to do it. We've also seen how this can help in real life, using an example from an online toy shop. By understanding why this is important and how it can help us make good choices, we can make our processes better and reach our goals more effectively.\n\nSome Words to Remember:\n- Looking at a Toy Shop: The practice of figuring out what a toy shop needs and suggesting ways to meet those needs.\n- People Who Care: People who care about or can change a toy shop or project.\n- Examples: A way to show a series of events that provides a certain kind of function.\n- User Stories: Short, simple ideas of a feature or need from the viewpoint of a user.\n- Looking at Data: A way to see and understand data relationships and dependencies.\n- Looking at Processes: A way to write down and think about toy shop processes.\n- SWOT Look: A tool used to identify a toy shop's good points, bad points, chances, and risks.\n- Cost-Benefit Look: A tool used to compare the costs and benefits of different solutions to see which one gives the most value.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 870, "idx": 322256, "original text": "Business Analyst COVID-19 ?.

{"text": "Lesson 1: Introduction to Following\n\n## Section 1: Basic Ideas\n\n**Topic:** What is following?\n\n**Definition:** Following is when one person pays too much attention to another person. This can make the person being followed feel scared.\n\n**Examples:** Jack follows Sophia around school and looks at her from a distance without talking to her. He leaves her notes and gifts at her house even though she has asked him to stop.\n\n**Discussion:** Why do you think people follow others? What can we do to stop following?\n\n## Section 2: Real Examples\n\n**Topic:** Spotting following behaviors\n\n**Example:** Jessica sees that someone has been writing messages about her online. She also finds out that her friend from work has been visiting her house without telling her.\n\n**Questions:** What are some examples of following behaviors? How can Jessica keep herself safe?\n\n**Discussion:** What can we do to stop following? How can we help people who are being followed to tell someone about it?\n\n## Section 3: Real-Life Stories\n\n**Topic:** Making a following case\n\n**Example:** A student tells the school that they have been getting scary messages from someone they don't know. The school's safety team looks into it and finds out that the messages are coming from another student who has been bothering the first student.\n\n**Questions:** How can we find proof to make a following case? What can the law do to the person who is following?\n\n**Discussion:** What part does technology play in following cases? How can we work with police to keep people safe?\n\n## Word List\n\n**Following:** When one person pays too much attention to another person and this makes the other person feel scared.\n\n**Course of conduct:** When one person pays too much attention to another person over and over again.\n\n## Ending\n\nTo end, following is a big problem that can hurt people. By understanding following and learning how to spot following behaviors, we can stop following and make strong cases against those who follow.

They might be asked to do things that are hard or scary, and that can make them feel bad. These things are sometimes done to make people look more like a boy or a girl, even if they don't feel that way. These things are often done without asking the person first, and can make them feel bad for a long time.\n\n## Part 3: What is Being Fair?\nBeing fair is when people all over the world work together to make sure everyone is treated nicely. They want to make sure that people are not asked to do hard or scary things unless they want to. They want to learn more about how to be fair and tell others about it. They also want to change the rules to make sure everyone is treated nicely.\n\n## Part 4: What is Rule 110?\nRule 110 is a new idea by Mr. Scott. He wants doctors to stop doing hard or scary things to babies when they are born. Instead, these things should only be done when the person is older and can decide for themselves if they want to do it.\n\n## Part 5: What Does Being Fair Want?\nBeing fair wants to stop doing hard or scary things to babies when they are born.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Cleaning Our Skin\n\n## Section 1: Simple Ideas\nCleaning our skin is a way to remove things like dirt and old skin from our skin's top layer. It's an important part of taking care of our skin because it helps make the clean, healthy skin show up. There are two ways to clean our skin: using tools and using special soaps. When we use tools like brushes or cloths, we can scrub away the old skin. When we use special soaps, these soaps help to break down the old skin so it can be washed away easily.\n\n## Section 2: Easy Examples\nA very good special soap is one that has things like fruit acids and plant enzymes. These things help to gently break down the old skin, letting it be washed away without hurting the healthy skin. The soap also has tiny pieces made from plant seeds and natural wax, which help to gently scrub the skin as well.\n\n## Section 3: Things to Think About\nOne good thing about cleaning our skin is that it helps to make our skin look smoother by removing old skin that can make it look rough. But, some people might worry that cleaning their skin too much could hurt their skin. It's important to find a middle ground between cleaning our skin well and not cleaning too much, which can make our skin red and sensitive. When picking a special soap, look for one that is good for your skin type.\n\n## Word List\n- Cleaning our skin: A way to remove things like dirt and old skin from our skin's top layer.\n- Special soaps: Soaps that help to break down old skin so it can be washed away easily.\n- Using tools: A way to clean our skin by scrubbing with tools like brushes or cloths.\n- Old skin: Skin that is no longer fresh and has been replaced by newer, healthier skin.\n\n## Ending\nCleaning our skin is a very important part of taking care of our skin because it helps to show the fresh, healthy skin. By learning about the different ways to clean our skin and how they work, you can pick the right soap or tool for your skin.

{"text": "Story Title: The Goodbye, the Last Well-wish, and the Helper: A reply to a picture on the internet\n\nOverview:\nIn this story, we will learn about the goodbye, last well-wish, and helpers in the church. We will understand why we say \"thanks\" to thank that we can finally go home! We will also learn about our church traditions and understand some of the small details of the church meeting.\n\nSection 1: Beginning\nIn this story, we will learn about the goodbye, last well-wish, and helpers in the church. These are important parts of the church meeting. We will start by understanding why we say \"thanks\" to thank that we can finally go home!\n\nSection 2: The Goodbye\nThe goodbye is when the priest wishes everyone to leave with a blessing. This wish is usually given like a goodbye, such as \"Go in peace.\" The goodbye is important because it lets everyone leave with a peaceful feeling. It also reminds us that we are not just leaving the church meeting, but also leaving the church building.\n\nSection 3: The Last Well-wish\nThe last well-wish is when the priest wishes everyone well. This wish is usually given at the end of the church meeting, after the goodbye. The last well-wish is important because it lets everyone leave with a peaceful feeling. It also reminds us that we are not just leaving the church meeting, but also leaving the church building.\n\nSection 4: The Helper\nThe helper is a helper in the church who helps the needs of the people. Helpers are special helpers who are called to help the church in different ways, including talking about good things, teaching, and helping with special church activities. The helper is important because it helps with the special church activities outside of the priest.\n\nSection 5: The End\nIn this story, we have learned about the goodbye, last well-wish, and helpers in the church. We have learned that these important parts of the church meeting often go unnoticed, but they are very important to the whole church meeting. By understanding some of the small details of the church meeting, we can understand our church traditions better and the role of the helper in the church.\n\nWords to Remember:\n- Goodbye: The part of the church meeting when the priest wishes everyone to leave with a blessing.\n- Final Good Wish: The good wish given by the priest at the end of the meeting.\n- Helping Group: A group within the big church responsible for helping others.\n- Helper: A special helper who is asked to help in a variety of ways, including talking to others, teaching, and doing important tasks.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 5620, "idx": 387973, "original text": "The Dismissal, the Final Blessing, and the Diaconate: A response to an internet meme\n\nThe Facebook page of Catholic Memes (facebook.com/CatholicMemeBase) posted the picture shown below on 24 July 2013, and immediately won thousands of \u201cLikes\u201d and hundreds of comments. The vast majority of comments fell into two categories: simple affirmations of the photo\u2019s cuteness, or tongue-in-cheek remarks about a real desire for the end of Mass even among adults. While the picture seems to express yet another adorable misunderstanding that a Catholic child might have, what all the commenters failed to realize is that the ancient and original sense of saying \u201cthanks be to God\u201d is in fact to thank God that we can finally leave!\n\nTo better understand this ancient sense, we must delve into our liturgical heritage and our Church\u2019s history. As we recover the logic behind some of the often\u2013 overlooked details of the Mass, we will not merely gain some trivial knowledge about bygone times; instead, we might rediscover some of the sublimity of Catholic worship as well as a more profound appreciation for God\u2019s gift of the Diaconate, that first step in sacramental orders.\n\nThe ministry of deacons is fundamentally a ministry of service (the Greek \u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 means \u201cservice\u201d, and the \u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 is therefore \u201cservant\u201d). This service takes a twofold expression: first, the deacon serves the community. As we read in the Acts of the Apostles and other ancient Christian texts, the deacon coordinates the collection and distribution of alms for the members of the community in most need. Second, the deacon serves his bishop by assisting him in the celebration of the sacred mysteries and by gathering from the community gifts of bread and wine to be offered to God. This twofold service is no less true today than when the Apostles ordained the first seven deacons in Jerusalem two thousand years ago.\n\nFor those of us who have attended Masses at which deacons assist the presiding priest or bishop, we notice that the deacons have specific roles in the Mass which are proper to them. The most obvious of these is the proclamation of the Gospel. Another task of the deacon is to give the dismissal at the end of Mass. The Latin formula for this dismissal is ite, missa est. Literally, this means, \u201cgo forth, the dismissal is made\u201d; since a literal translation sounds awkward, we render this more smoothly as \u201cThe Mass is ended, go in peace\u201d. (Nota bene: this Latin word missa is the source of the English word \u201cMass\u201d and its many equivalents in European languages!) The response to the dismissal is, of course, \u201cthanks be to God\u201d, or Deo gratias.\n\nIn the Novus Ordo missal, the dismissal is given after the priest or bishop gives the final blessing: \u201cMay Almighty God bless you, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\u201d. This order (blessing first, dismissal second) stands in contrast to dismissal found in the Traditional Latin Mass. In these old rites, which grew gradually and organically out of the Eucharistic celebrations of the earliest centuries, we glimpse certain rituals with ancient roots going back to the times of the first Christians. For example, in the Traditional Latin Mass, the dismissal is given before the final blessing\u2013 a reversal of the arrangement in the modern missal.\n\nThis ancient order (dismissal first, blessing second) is one of those rituals which has its source in the early centuries of Christianity when our faith was violently persecuted under the Roman Empire. The Eucharist was celebrated in secret, and Christianity was an underground religion. In Rome, this \u201cunderground\u201d character was quite literally expressed in the fact that the faithful gathered with the bishop (AKA, the Pope) to celebrate the Eucharist in the catacombs\u2014 at the subterranean tombs of the martyrs along the Via Appia. Roman soldiers would often patrol areas around the catacombs in order to arrest and kill Christians as they emerged from the underground liturgies. When the Eucharistic sacrifice was completed, somebody had to first check whether there were Roman soldiers lurking about before the bishop and people could safely leave; calling to mind his twofold service to the community and to his bishop, this task fell to the deacon. Carefully, he would go to the entrance of the catacombs to peek around for soldiers. Once the patrols had passed, the deacon could finally give the dismissal: Ite, missa est, to which the people gladly responded, Deo gratias because\u2014 thanks be to God\u2014 the people and the bishop could safely leave at last. As the final gesture, the bishop would then send the people back into the hostile world with the final blessing, not knowing who would be martyred before the next Mass: Benedicat vos omnipotens Deus Pater et Filius et Spiritus Sanctus. Amen.\n\nThus, the early Christians were also thankful to God that they could finally leave Mass! Of course, it is not for the same reasons that we modern people have; often we say \u201cthanks be to God\u201d that we can now watch a sporting event, attend a barbecue, go shopping, or otherwise enjoy the rest of our weekend that was interrupted by Mass. Our ancestors in faith thought differently. They said \u201cthanks be to God\u201d that they might go safely to their homes to pass on the faith to their children and to promote the increase of the Church by their acts of charity. May we rediscover the strength of faith and resolute courage of those who risked their very lives for the worship of Almighty God and the propagation of the faith which, Deo gratias, we profess today.", "hash": "6814b500d3ebe55277940682c19bd9c53f60d9f3ab4085b2a863f93e5809110f"}

{"text": "\n\n**Lesson:** Introduction to Mixing Colors and Shapes\n\n### Section 1: Fun Ideas\n\nWe use different tools to find out what things are made of. One tool helps us separate things based on how they're made. Another tool helps us find out how much of each thing is in a mixture.\n\n### Let's Learn More\n\nOne tool is often used to see if people have been around bad things, like harmful chemicals. For example, if someone has been around a bad chemical, it can change something in their body. We can find this change in their pee. By looking at this change, we can tell if they have been around the bad chemical and how much.\n\n### Real-Life Examples\n\nIn one study, they used the tool to check pee samples from people who might have been around a bad chemical. They were able to find the change in their bodies even when it was very small. This shows that the tool is very good at finding small amounts of changes in the body.\n\n### Words to Remember\n\n- Tool 1: This helps us separate things based on how they're made.\n- Tool 2: This helps us find out how much of each thing is in a mixture.\n- Tool 3: This is a special tool that separates things based on how big and shaped they are.\n- Tool 4: This is another tool that breaks things into smaller parts to find out how big the original thing was.\n- Change: This is something that happens in the body when it's around a bad chemical.\n\n### Wrapping Up\n\nThese tools are really good at finding small changes in the body. They can help us keep people and the environment safe. By knowing how these tools work, we can understand why they are important.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1756, "idx": 245330, "original text": "Determination of trans,trans-muconic acid in workers' urine through ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry.\nA novel method for the biological monitoring of benzene-exposed workers has been developed through ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. The method uses trans,trans-muconic acid in urine as the benzene-exposure biomarker. The method was developed using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with enough sensitivity to facilitate diluting and injecting the urine samples directly, rather than performing a solid-phase extraction procedure as is common in the available protocols. Moreover, compared with a conventional high-pressure liquid chromatography system, the separation power provided by the ultra-performance liquid chromatography system allows a 10-fold reduction in run time. The method was adjusted to a dynamic range of between 198.9 and 4916.7 \u00b5g/L to cover the biological exposure index of trans,trans-muconic acid in urine. Also, the method demonstrated intra-day and inter-day precision at 98%, and accuracy within an acceptable range of 101 \u00b1 8%. The method has been used to quantify various types of urine samples, such as workers' urine and inter-laboratory proficiency tests. Depending on the sample, the quantified levels ranged from less than the limit of quantitation to 3836.7 \u00b5g/L. No levels exceeding the calibration range were detected in the urine of workers, and the reported concentrations in urine for the proficiency tests were, as expected, based on known values. Moreover, the new method using sample dilution and faster chromatographic run was more effective, facilitating fast communication of results, as needed, to decision-makers.", "hash": "434da5e0c1a732e8599e8b389c1e600c2893a029d986bb6585042d4539900ff4"}
{"text": "**Lesson: Learning About Trying Things Out**\n\n**What We Want to Do:** We want to help kids understand how we can try things out to find out more about the world around us.\n\n**Starting Off:** Trying things out is a way we can learn about the world. We can look at things, think about why they are the way they are, and then try things to see if we're right or wrong.\n\n**Section 1: How We Try Things Out**\n\n1. **Looking:** The first thing we do is look at something. We use our eyes and other senses, or sometimes tools to help us.\n\n2. **Thinking:** After looking, we make a guess about why something is the way it is. This guess should be something we can check.\n\n3. **Trying:** Next, we do something to check if our guess is right. When we do this, we make sure only the thing we're checking changes.\n\n4. **Understanding:** After we've tried, we look at what happened. This helps us see if what we thought was right or wrong.\n\n5. **Ending:** If what happened matches our guess, we think we're right. If not, we start again.\n\n**Section 2: Trying Things Out in Real Life**\n\n1. **Looking:** A kid sees that plants grow taller in sunlight.\n\n2. **Thinking:** The kid thinks that plants need sunlight to grow.\n\n3. **Trying:** The kid grows two groups of plants, one in sunlight and one without.\n\n4. **Understanding:** After some time, the kid looks at the plants. The ones in the sunlight are taller.\n\n5. **Ending:** This shows the kid that plants do need sunlight to grow.\n\n**Section 3: Talking About Trying Things Out**\n\n**What We're Talking About:** Should we use animals to find out more about us?\n\n**Yes, We Should:** Animals can help us understand more about ourselves. Some big discoveries wouldn't have been made without using animals.\n\n**No, We Shouldn't:** Animals can get hurt in these tests. There are other ways we can try things out, like using cells or computers.\n\n**Ending:** Using animals has helped us a lot. But, we should always think about other ways to try things out and make sure animals are safe.\n\n**Words to Know:**\n- Looking: Using our senses or tools to find out more about something.\n- Thinking: Making a guess about why something is the way it is.\n- Trying: Doing something to see if our guess is right.\n- Understanding: Looking at what happened to see if we were right or wrong.\n- End: The last thing we find out from trying something.\n\n**End:** Kids should know that there's a neat way to learn about everything around us. We look at things, make a guess, try something out, see what happens, and then we know what's real and what's not.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 790, "idx": 301771, "original text": "Spanning the entire range of the scientific, biotechnical and chemical skill sets and roles, our specialist consultants have developed networks and relationships that are unmatched..

{"text": "Lesson: How to Look for Things on the Web\n\nStart:\nIn our world today, it's really important to know how to find things fast and right. With computers, we can know a lot about everything. But with so much to know, it's hard to know where to start. In this lesson, we will learn how to look for things on the web the right way.\n\nPart 1: The Simple Stuff\n\nThing 1: Finding Tools\nA finding tool helps you look for things on the web. Some tools people use a lot are Go, Bi, and Ya. When you type a word or group of words into a finding tool, it shows you a list of places on the web that have what you're looking for.\n\nThing 2: Important Words and Groups of Words\nTo use a finding tool right, you need to know what important words and groups of words to use. Important words are the words or groups of words that tell you what's in a place on the web. For example, if you want to know about the story of our country, you might use the important words \"Our Country's Story\" or \"The Story of Us\".\n\nGroups of words are words that are together and treated like one thing. Using groups of words can help you find just what you're looking for. For example, if you're looking for something Adam said, you might type \"Adam\" \"What Adam Said\".\n\nThing 3: And, Or, Not Words\nAnd, Or, Not words are words that let you use important words and groups of words to look for more than one thing. The three big And, Or, Not words are AND, OR, and NOT. For example, if you want to know about the Big Fight and Adam, you might type \"Big Fight\" AND \"Adam\".\n\nPart 2: More Ways to Look for Things\n\nThing 1: Using \"\" Marks\nUsing \"\" marks around a group of words will look for exactly those words in that order. This can be helpful when looking for a certain group of words or title. For example, if you're looking for the story \"How to Love Birds\", you would type \"How to Love Birds\" in \"\" marks.\n\nThing 2: Using () Marks\nUsing () marks around a group of important words can help you find just what you're looking for. For example, if you want to know about the Big Change and the Saying of Freedom, you might type \"Big Change\" AND \"Saying of Freedom\" in () marks.\n\nThing 3: Using Choices\nA lot of finding tools let you use choices to get just what you want. For example, on Go, you can choose by when or where. This can be useful when looking for things that happened at a certain time or in a certain place.\n\nSection 3: Looking at Things Closely\n\nTopic 1: Who Said It?\nWhen looking at things, it's important to think about who said it. Is the person who said it someone who knows a lot about it? Is the place you found it a good place to find things? You can use something like a big library to check if the person really knows a lot.\n\nTopic 2: Is It True?\nIt's also important to think about if what you found is true. Are the things that are said true? Are there any mistakes in what is said? You can use something like a truth checker to check if what you found is true.\n\nTopic 3: Is It Fair?\nFinally, it's important to think about if what you found is fair. Are there any things that might make the person say something that isn't true? Are there different ways of looking at it? Thinking about these things can help make sure that you are understanding things in a fair and true way.\n\nEnd:\nIn this lesson, we learned about how to find things, like using special words and ways of looking for things. We also learned about how to look at things closely to see if they are said by someone who knows a lot, if they are true, and if they are fair. By doing these things, we can find the things we need and make sure they are true and good.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 936, "idx": 417334, "original text": "Just an experiment.

{"text": "Lesson: Talking Toys\n\nIntroduction:\nTalking toys is a fun way that lets toys talk to each other without touching. In this lesson, we will learn about a type of talking toy called a big-and-small toy, which includes big toys and tiny toys.\n\nSection 1: What is a Big-and-Small Talking Toy?\n\nA big-and-small talking toy is a type of game where many toys are used to play in a large space. Each toy is a small area played by a single big toy, and each big toy controls one or more toys.\n\nQuestions:\n- What is a toy in a big-and-small talking toy?\n- How does a big-and-small talking toy work?\n\nAnswer:\n A toy is a small area played by a single big toy in a big-and-small talking toy. Each big toy controls one or more toys. In a big-and-small talking toy, there are two types of toys: big toys and tiny toys. Big toys are large toys that cover a wide area, while tiny toys are small toys that cover a smaller area, typically indoors.\n\nIn a big-and-small talking toy, when a toy (such as a phone toy) wants to talk, it first needs to tell its location to a friend toy. This process is called \u201ctelling friend.\u201d After the telling friend is complete, the friend toy can talk to the toy even when it is not playing (also known as a quiet time). This process is called \u201ccalling.\u201d\n\nSection 2: Telling Friend and Calling\n\nTelling friend is the process by which a toy tells its location to a friend toy. The friend toy then remembers the location of all the toys in its game. When the friend toy needs to talk to a toy, it checks the location of the toy and sends the talk to the nearest big toy that covers the toy's location.\n\nCalling is the process by which the friend toy talks to a toy after it has told its location. The friend toy sends a message to all the big toys in the area where the toy is located, asking them to send the talk to the toy. The big toy that is closest to the toy will receive the talk and send it to the toy.\n\nQuestions:\n- What is telling friend?\n- Why is telling friend necessary in a big-and-small talking toy?\n- What is calling?\n\nAnswer:\nTelling friend is the process by which a toy tells its location to a friend toy. This is necessary in a big-and-small talking toy because the friend toy needs to know the location of all the toys in its game in order to talk to them efficiently.\n\nCalling is the process by which the friend toy talks to a toy after it has told its location. This is necessary because the friend toy needs to talk to the toy even when it is not playing.\n\nPart 3: Big and Small Talkers\n\nBig Talkers are large talkers that can talk far and wide, like over a whole city or area. They are mostly used for talking outside and are very strong. Small Talkers, though, are little talkers that can only talk a small space, usually inside a house. They are not as strong as Big Talkers and are used for talking inside a house.\n\nQuestions:\n- What is different between Big Talkers and Small Talkers?\n- When should we use Big Talkers and when should we use Small Talkers?\n\nAnswer:\nThe main difference between Big Talkers and Small Talkers is how far they can talk. Big Talkers can talk over a big area, like a city or area, while Small Talkers can only talk a small space, usually inside a house. We should use Big Talkers when we need to talk over a big area, like outside. But Small Talkers are used for talking inside a house, where the space is not so big.\n\nConclusion:\nIn this lesson, we learned about a talking system that uses Big Talkers and Small Talkers. We also learned about how to choose a place for them, which is very important in this type of talking system. By understanding these ideas, we can know better how these talking systems work and use this knowledge to solve new problems.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 3528, "idx": 256480, "original text": "This invention relates to a wireless communication system in which macrocells and femtocells are used in a mixed manner.\nIn a cell-based wireless communication system, typified by cell phones, in order to transfer data to a terminal in an idle status (quiescent status), processings called \u201clocation registration\u201d and \u201cpaging\u201d are performed as is described in, for example, 3GPP TS23.401 v8.0.0, General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) enhancements for Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) access (Release 8) pp. 46 to 48, pp. 65 to 67.\nThe location registration is a processing in which the location of a terminal is registered with a location management server on a location registration area basis. Generally, a location registration area is configured by a plurality of base stations, and each of the base stations broadcasts information regarding its own location registration area to all terminals. The terminal constantly monitors the information regarding the location registration area. Hence, when the information regarding the location registration area, which the terminal is receiving, is changed while the terminal is in motion, the terminal registers the location with the location management server based on the received information regarding the location registration area. With this configuration, the location management server can manage which location registration area each of the terminals is located in. Besides, even when the information regarding the location registration area is not changed, the terminal performs location registration periodically.\nFurther, the paging is a processing in which a terminal in the idle status is called from the network side and then activated. Upon arrival of data directed to a terminal, the location management server transmits a paging request to all base stations that belong to a location registration area in which the terminal concerned had registered the location thereof last time. Each of the base stations that have received the paging request from the location management server uses a wireless broadcast channel to transfer the paging request to the terminal concerned. Upon reception of the paging request, the terminal concerned activates a wireless channel to thereby start data communication.\nAs is described above, in the cell-based wireless communication system, the location of the terminal in the idle status is managed on a location registration area basis. Further, when the data has arrived, the terminal is called by all the base stations within the location registration area, and the terminal in the idle status is activated. Then, data transfer to the activated terminal is realized.\nThe above-mentioned processings of the location registration and the paging are performed via base stations (macrocells, microcells, and picocells) installed by a telecommunications carrier having a radio band license.\nOn the other hand, a femtocell is a service area that has a coverage area of around several tens of meters, and its applications conceived include expanding the service area to higher floors of a building, which radio waves from a macro base station cannot reach, and improving the communication quality in an ordinary house. The above-mentioned femtocell can be realized by installing a femto base station. In particular, in the case of use in the ordinary house, there is a possibility that an ordinary user who does not have a radio station license installs a femto base station at his/her own discretion.", "hash": "5703c6b533bd66fbb28217680734fbce7fac858f9b1b3b62fe7177c7f3c9a285"}
{"text": "Lesson: Big Energy's Effect on Tiny Walls\n\n## Part 1: Introduction\n\nIn this lesson, we will learn about what Big Energy does to Tiny Walls. We will learn about how Tiny Walls get charged up, how they can get poked with holes, and how water holes are made. We will also talk about the idea that Tiny Walls can break into even tinier pieces, which makes them work better.\n\n## Part 2: How Tiny Walls Get Charged\n\nTiny Walls get charged when energy from outside is used. This charging makes the Tiny Wall parts line up with the energy, which makes a separation of charges. This separation of charges makes a difference across the wall, which can make holes.\n\n## Part 3: Poking Holes and Water Holes\n\nPoking holes is how charging Tiny Walls makes water holes. These holes let tiny things and water pass through the wall, which makes it work better. However, recent looks at very strong energies suggest that poking holes might not be the only thing happening.\n\n## Part 4: Tiny Pieces and Bubble Making\n\nOur idea is that not only are water holes made in the Tiny Walls, but that Tiny Walls can break into even tinier pieces, maybe with bubbles forming. This effect would make the wall work even better and stop relatively quickly with energy from outside.\n\n## Part 5: Losing Material and Stopping the Pump\n\nWe will also talk about what happens when cells are around a lot of electricity, especially the stuff that goes away from the cell. This is the same as what other people have found.\n\n## Big Idea 6: Pretend Games\n\nPretend games help us think that tiny pieces of the cell cover can break, which makes electricity go through easier.\n\n## Big Idea 7: The End\n\nIn the end, we learned what happens to cell covers when there's a lot of electricity, including charging, holes, and tiny pieces breaking. We talked about water holes and the idea that soap bubbles can form. We also looked at what happens to cells in a lot of electricity, including stuff going away and switches turning off.

Several recent observations, especially at very high field strength, are not compatible with the simple electroporation picture. Here we present several relevant experiments on cell electrical responses to very high external voltages. We hypothesize that, not only are aqueous pores created within the lipid membranes, but that nanoscale membrane fragmentation occurs, possibly with micelle formation. This effect would produce conductivity increases beyond simple electroporation and display a relatively fast turn-off with external voltage. In addition, material loss can be expected at the anode side of cells, in agreement with published experimental reports at high fields. Our hypothesis is qualitatively supported by molecular dynamics simulations. Finally, such cellular responses might temporarily inactivate voltage-gated and ion-pump activity, while not necessarily causing cell death. This hypothesis also supports observations on electrofusion.", "hash": "2d68a6e78c0b96d8553002635021c9a9ecb5dff7d9e5f73a8857886012964ea9"}

We'll also learn how these things affect our feet and how we can avoid or treat them.\nMain Idea:\nThe main idea of this story is to teach kids about the importance of taking care of their feet and knowing about possible foot problems if we don't take care of them.\nPart 1: What are Nerves and Nerve Pain?\nNerve pain is when the nerves, which connect our brain and spine to the rest of our body, are not working right. It can make us feel weak, have no feeling, and feel pain in the places it affects. Nerves are things that can grow on nerves, usually in the feet. They can make us feel pain, tingling, and no feeling in the toes.\nPart 2: Causes and Feelings\nNerves and nerve pain can be caused by many things, including things we are born with, a condition called diabetes, drinking too much alcohol, and being around harmful things. Signs of nerves include feeling burning, tingling, or sharp pain in the toes. Signs of nerve pain include no feeling, weakness, and pain in the feet.\nPart 3: How to Feel Better\nEasy ways to feel better from nerves and nerve pain include changing shoes, padding the area, reducing pressure in the area, getting a shot of a medicine, or custom-made shoe inserts to fix the way we walk. Surgery is done when all other ways have not given enough relief.\nPart 4: Staying Healthy\nAvoiding nerves and nerve pain includes taking good care of your feet. This includes wearing the right shoes, avoiding tight shoelaces, and keeping your feet clean.\nPart 5: End\nIn the end, nerves and nerve pain are things that affect the feet. They can cause pain, tingling, and no feeling in the toes. Ways to feel better range from easy to surgery, depending on how bad it is. Staying healthy includes taking good care of your feet and avoiding things that can make it worse. By understanding the importance of foot care, you can lower your chance of getting nerves and nerve pain.\nWords to Know:\n- Nerve: A thing that can grow on a nerve, usually in the feet.\n- Nerve Pain: When the nerves, which connect our brain and spine to the rest of our body, are not working right.\n- Shoe: Clothing designed to protect and make our feet comfortable.\n- Shoe Insert: Things used to correct problems or improve how our feet work.\n- Medicine: A thing we take to make swelling and redness go away.\n- Body movement problems: When the body doesn't move or work the right way.\n- Cut: A line made in the skin during a doctor's visit.\n- Numbing medicine: A thing that makes a small part of the body feel nothing during a doctor's visit.\n- Foot doctor: A doctor who helps when our feet or ankles hurt.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 940, "idx": 329322, "original text": "Neuromas and Neuropathy. Neuromas occur most often in the forefoot as a result of a nerve being pinched and entrapped for a long period of time. The nerve eventually becomes thickened or inflamed and begins to cause burning, tingling or shooting pain into the toes. This can be caused from a structural change in the foot, ill-fitting shoes or tightly lacing the shoes.. Treatment Options: Conservative care may consist of changing footwear, padding of the area, reducing pressure in the area, injections of a steroid, or custom made orthotics to address the biomechanical faults..

{"text": "Lesson: Learning about Plants\n\n**Goal:** To learn about plants, why they are important, and how we use them every day.\n\n**For:** Little kids to big kids\n\n**Time:** Almost an hour\n\n**Things to use:** None\n\n**Beginning:** We are going to learn about plants today. This includes everything from big trees and pretty flowers to tiny green things that grow in water and mushrooms. Plants are very important for everything living on Earth. They make air, give food and places to live for animals, and help nature. In this lesson, we will learn simple things about plants, like how to tell them apart, what parts they have, what they do, and how they have changed over time.\n\n**Part 1: Why Plants are Important**\n\n**Thing 1: What Kind of Plant is it?**\n\n- Plants are grouped into different types based on how they look and what they do.\n- There are five big types of plants: mosses, liverworts, hornworts, ferns, and two kinds of plants that make seeds (one type makes cones and the other type makes flowers).\n\n**Thing 2: Parts of a Plant**\n\n- Plants have different parts that help them make food, make more plants, and do other things.\n- The main parts of a plant are roots, stems, leaves, and flowers.\n- Roots help the plant stay in the ground and take water and food from the soil.\n- Stems hold up the plant and move water and food between the roots and leaves.\n- Leaves have tiny parts inside that make energy from sunlight.\n- Flowers have parts that help plants make more plants.\n\n**Thing 3: What Plants Do**\n\n- Plants are very important in nature. They make air, take in bad air, and give food and homes to animals.\n- Some plants can help when we are sick.\n- We also use plants for clothes, building things, and other stuff.\n\n**Part 2: How Plants Have Changed**\n\n**Thing 1: How Plants Have Changed**\n\n- Plants have changed a lot over a very long time because of nature and how they live.\n- The first plants were very simple and only had one cell. Then they became more complex.\n- Over time, plants became different types, each good for living in certain places and situations.\n\n**Thing 2: Old Plants**\n\n- Scientists use old plants that have turned into rock to learn how plants and where they lived have changed.\n- These old plants show how plants have changed over time and how they are like plants today.\n- By looking at old plants, scientists can learn about the history of life on Earth and how plants have helped nature develop.\n\n**Part 3: How We Use Plants**\n\n**Thing 1: Farming**\n\n- Farming is growing plants for food, fiber, and other stuff.\n- Farmers use what they know about plants to grow food that is good, makes a lot, and doesn't get sick.\n- People use science and technology to make new types of plants that are even better.\n\n**Thing 2: Medicine**\n\n- Plants have been used for healing for many years.\n- Today, we use parts of plants to make medicine to treat sicknesses.\n- There is a type of medicine that uses plants for healing.\n\n**In short:** We study plants because they are very important. Plants help us to live and can be used to make medicine. By learning about plants, we can understand how special and important they are.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 6809, "idx": 226050, "original text": "Wednesday, July 31, 2019\n\nPlants, plants, plants - I can't get enough of them! They not only purify the air but are can also be quite decorative and sculptural. Decorating with plants is another way to accessorize your home and they are relatively inexpensive. You can have a solo big plant or a grouping of smaller plants. Really, how you choose to decorate with plants is up to you and your aesthetic but the possibilities are endless. Cleverly placed plants can hide or at least minimize unsightly room features like pipes, radiators, etc. It is not uncommon to see plants being used to hide an unsightly radiator!\n\nAs home accessories, plants can give a fresh look to an interior and summertime is especially perfect for decorating with plants as they are at their perkiest and there is an array of plants available to buy. Which plants you select should depend on where you live, how much time you want to devote to them, and what effect you want to create. I've shared in prior posts-Best Plants for theBathroom and Best Plants for Sleep in the Bedroomwhich can also help as a guide for your plant shopping. Additionally these amazing examples of decorating with plants should provide the ultimate motivation to sprinkle some plants in your home.\n\nWednesday, July 24, 2019\n\nI remember years ago when I was on maternity leave while pregnant with Zion(i was teaching at the time), and I discovered Joanna's blog, A Cup of Jo. I looked forward to reading her posts daily and it was because of her blog that the idea of forming my own blog was born. So we've come full circle to now have our home featured on A Cup of Jo! Click HEREto see the tour. Also thank you Kelsey for the beautiful article and to A Cup of Jo lovely readers, thank you for the warm embrace you've given us through your comments. xx\n\nTuesday, July 23, 2019\n\nI stumbled upon a pin of this delightful space on Pinterest and had to hunt down the source which brought me to a magical glimpse into Dirac Castle. As a color lover, I was absolutely \"green with envy\" and immediately fell in love with the splashes of green punctuated throughout. The green painted doors are everything! Additionally, as a plant lover, I love how they've adorned their spaces with plants-so welcoming. The textures, the materials used, the details, the decor; really everything about Dirac Castle envelopes you and makes you feel right at home.\n\nWednesday, July 17, 2019\n\nGallery walls will never go out of style around here! I love them as they give me an opportunity to showcase the art pieces that make me happy. I've always wanted to try a gallery wall of art going all the way down the wall and I finally did back in the Spring.\n\nActually once I start obsessing over an idea, it is more than likely going to happen. In this case with Cheyenne being Ms. Busy Body, I was fully prepared for this to be a short term design realization. However, surprisingly she has decided to let Mama be great and leave the art be:-). You might remember a table being in this version of the foyer, I relocated it, and placed some of my favorite art pieces on the wall. I love how it turned out! xx\n\nMonday, July 15, 2019\n\nCurrently sitting on my couch and trying not to drool all over my computer as I peruse these amazing deals for Prime Day. There are so many faves, like this Nespresso coffee machine. Over 2 years ago, I received one as a Mother's Day gift and I love it! The capsules come in a variety of flavors and intensities to appeal to all taste buds. Also, there is almost always music playing in our home and we love our speakers! This oneis a great deal and also connects to Alexa and this one is one of my favorite brands. And if you love plants as much as I do, well you know plant stands are a must and even better when they are beautiful to look at. This one is a beauty and a great price.\nThis vacuum cleaner is an amazing deal at savings over 50%!\n\nAs a family that rarely eats out and a busy Mama, our slow cooker has been so convenient and a life saver. I can let it do its thing while I get other things done. This oneis an amazing deal! Cast irons are not only aesthetically pleasing to have in the kitchen due to the array of colors they come in, but also very durable and perfect for making a great stew! Check out these cast iron skillets on sale and this orange dutch potis lovely too! I'll be sharing more of my faves throughout today and tomorrow on my instagram stories, so check those out too. xx\n\nThursday, July 11, 2019\n\nAt the beginning of the year, I mentioned that I was embracing being more intentional about self care. Self care looks different for everyone. For me being a visual person with a strong connection to nature, self care is surrounding myself with plants or making over my bedroom to become an area of retreat which is much needed as a Mama of 3 young ones. In January, I hopped on the celery juice hype and it is deserving of all the hype. I only had a blender at the time, so I researched juicers and found this affordable one and it works beautifully. I was juicing celery every morning for at least two months when I had a two week lapse because I had to travel out of the country. I highly recommend following Medical Medium on instagram - so much enlightening information to realize optimal health.\n\nLosing the Baby Weight\nBreastfeeding Cheyenne undoubtedly led to quite a bit of weight loss but in addition to the detox from the celery juice, I also bought the Massy Arias MA60program and I did the exercises in our little garage gym(pictured below).\n\nI already had almost all the equipment needed and it's more convenient for me to work out at home. However, if you don't have the right equipment and can go the gym, i highly recommend that so you can achieve best results. In the beginning, I would incorporate about 30 minutes of cardio in addition to the other exercises. However, now I focus mostly on lifting and building my strength. I haven't been as consistent as I should be lately but I intend to fix that and get back to beast mode.\n\nDiet\nI've always been a healthy eater so there haven't been too many adjustments there. We are also a make it from scratch kind of family so you'll rarely find processed food in our pantry. Although I don't have a sweet tooth, I still try to watch my sugar intake.\n\nMental and Spiritual Care\nThis area of self care has probably seen the most work. I've recently experienced some things that brought me great despair but with that despair also came spiritual growth. The books,A New Earth, Awakening to Your Life's Purpose by Eckhart Tolle and A Praying Lifeby Paul Miller have been great resources that have helped me in this area. Life is an ongoing learning process but it's important to stay connected to our true selves and remember that joy starts from within. xx", "hash": "bc3674de75a7781dcd7f9277d6ef1284e61095fd2fb75514c988d5185ff31e94"}
{"text": "\n\nLesson: Dry Times and How They Change Fishing\n\nStart:\nDry times are when there is not a lot of rain. This can lead to less water. In this lesson, we will talk about how dry times can affect fishing and what we can do to help fish when there is not a lot of water.\n\nPart 1: Understanding Dry Times and How They Change Fishing\n\nTopic 1: What are Dry Times?\n- Dry times are when there is not a lot of rain.\n- They can last for a long time and cause there to be less water.\n- Dry times can be a little bit dry, very dry, extremely dry, or the driest it can be.\n\nTopic 2: How do Dry Times Change Fishing?\n- When it is a dry time, there is less water in rivers and streams. This can make it hard for fish to live.\n- The less water there is, the warmer the water can get. This can be bad for fish.\n- Fish might get stuck in small pools of water. This makes it easier for other animals to catch them.\n- Sometimes, dry times can cause there to be fewer fish. This means there are fewer fish to catch.\n\nPart 2: What We Do to Help Fish During Dry Times\n\nTopic 1: Emergency Rules\n- When it is a dry time, the people who take care of fish might make new rules to help the fish.\n- These rules might include not letting people fish in certain streams or limiting how many fish people can catch.\n- These rules are only for a short time and are used when other ways to help fish do not work.\n\nTopic 2: Closing Off Streams\n- When it is a dry time, some streams might be closed off to protect the fish.\n- This might only be for some parts of the stream or for the whole stream.\n- Signs that tell people the stream is closed are usually put up where people can see them.\n\nPart 3: Real Life Examples\n\nTopic 1: The Dry Time in CA State\n- In 2015, there was a very dry time in much of CA State. Many streams were closed off to fishing.\n- The CA State Fish and Wildlife group made new rules to help the fish. This included rules about how big and how many fish people could catch.\n- Even with these rules, some fish did not do well because of the dry times.\n\nTopic 2: Big Dry Time\n- Early in the 21st century, a big dry time happened in the CA place, causing some small rivers to stop fishing.\n- The stop affected fun and work fishing, with many fishers catching less fish.\n- Some fish groups could get better quickly once the big dry time finished, while others kept having less fish even after the stop was gone.\n\nEnding:\nBig dry times can change fish groups a lot, leading to less fishing chances and possible less fish. Quick rules and the stop of small rivers are two things that can be done to protect fish groups during big dry times. By knowing the effects of big dry times on fishing and the things done to protect fish groups, we can value more the importance of saving nature during times of less water.\n\nWords to learn:\n- Big Dry Time: A long time of less-than-usual rain in a place.\n- Quick Rules: Short-time rules made by state fish and game groups to protect fish during big dry times.\n- Stop: The act of not allowing to go to a special place or do a certain thing, such as fishing in some small rivers during a big dry time.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 546, "idx": 632268, "original text": "The drought has prompted the suspension of fishing in sections of some streams, including some on the Central Coast..

The California Department of Fish And Wildlife received notification this week that state legal official cleared the way for the start of enforcement of the emergency measure.", "hash": "e33b500b9ef0deaee3db193cc56c825460b752fbc158c7ff21c7314b423f21c7"}

Schoeffel\n\nJack Baptist Schoeffel (11 May 1846 - d. Boston, 31 August 1918), was an American theatre manager and producer, and hotel owner. With Henry E. Abbey he was involved presenting European theatrical stars in the US, including Sarah Bernhardt, Henry Irving and Ellen Terry: and with Maurice Grau he and Abbey managed opera singers as Adelina Patti, Christina Nilsson, Ernestine Schumann-Heink, Francesco Tamagno and Fyodor Chaliapin in their tours of opera houses in Boston, Chicago and New York.\n\nCareer\n\nHe was born in Rochester, NY. He joined the theatre impresario Henry E. Abbey as his business partner in 1876. As a partner in the firm of Abbey, Schoeffel and Grau formed in 1880, he was involved in presenting grand opera during the 'Golden Age of singing' at the New York Metropolitan Opera House (\"the old Met\") in 1883 and from 1891-1903.\n\nHe was resident Manager of the Park Theatre, Boston when it was built in 1879, and manager of the 1889 Tremont Theatre, Boston until his death.\n\nAbbey and Schoeffel managed the 10-year old Josef Hofmann when he toured the USA, but he was stopped from playing because of overwork. A letter from Schoeffel from the Tremont Theatre dates from this period. Hofmann's agent in London was Narciso Vert, whose business became the well-known firm of Ibbs and Tillett.\n\nHe produced some plays at Daly's Theatre on Broadway in 1904 after Grau retired.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Sound Toys\n\nOverview: In this lesson, we will learn about sound toys and their parts. We will discover different kinds of sound toys, what they do, and how they make sounds. By the end of this lesson, you will know the different parts of a sound toy and understand how they make the toy sound fun.\n\nSection 1: What is a Sound Toy?\n\nA sound toy is a toy that changes little lightning bolts into noises. It is a necessary part of any fun music set, including home play sets, toy stereos, and little music players. Sound toys come in different shapes and sizes, but they all have some common parts.\n\nSection 2: Parts of a Sound Toy\n\n1. Sound Maker: The sound maker is the part of the toy that makes the noise. It is usually a cone-shaped part that moves when a little lightning bolt goes through it. The size and shape of the sound maker decide the range and loudness of the sound.\n\n2. Little Magnet: The little magnet is located behind the sound maker and is used to make a pull field. This pull field helps to control the movement of the sound maker, which in turn affects the sound made.\n\n3. Voice Wire: The voice wire is a thin string of metal twisted around the sound maker. When a little lightning bolt goes through the voice wire, it creates a pull field that works with the pull field of the little magnet. This working together causes the sound maker to move back and forth, creating sound.\n\n4. Sound Splitter: The sound splitter is a network of toy parts that breaks the sound into different ranges. It sends low sounds to the big sound maker, middle sounds to the middle sound maker, and high sounds to the tiny sound maker.\n\nSection 3: Kinds of Sound Toys\n\nThere are different kinds of sound toys, each made to make sound in a specific way.\n\n1. Shelf Sound Toys: These are small sound toys that can be placed on a shelf or table. They are usually used as part of a home play set.\n\n2. Ground Sound Toys: These are bigger sound toys that are made to stand on the ground. They are often used in home play sets because they make a lot of deep sounds and can make loud sounds.\n\n3. Tall Sound Toys: These are big, standalone sound toys that are made to make high-quality sound. They are often used in professional toy sets.\n\n4. Deep Sound Toys: These are sound toys that are specifically made to make deep sounds. They are often used in home play sets to provide a deeper sound experience.\n\nSection 4: How Sound Toys Work\n\nWhen a little lightning bolt is sent to a sound toy, it is first sorted by the sound splitter. The sound splitter separates the sound into different ranges and sends them to the right sound maker. The sound maker then moves, creating sound waves that travel through the air and reach our ears.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this story, we talked about how a sound-maker is made and works. We also learned about different kinds of sound-makers. When we know this, we can pick good sound-makers and make them sound the best they can.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 769, "idx": 322230, "original text": "6.5\" 500W Midrange Loudspeaker 4 Ohms 250 RMS PRO-X6.4M. 6.5\" 500W Midrange Loudspeaker 4 Ohms 250 RMS PRO-X6.4M.

It's a key part of how our world works and helps us make smart choices with our things. In this lesson, we will talk about the basics of trade, like giving and getting, making choices, and how markets work.\n\n**Part 1: Giving and Getting**\n\n**Idea:** Giving and getting are two simple ideas in trade. They decide the price and amount of stuff made in a market.\n\n**Example:** Let's pretend there aren't many apples in the market. Because of this, the price of apples goes up. People who want to buy apples are ready to pay more because they really want them. This increase in wanting and decrease in giving will continue until the price reaches a point where the amount given equals the amount wanted.\n\n**Questions and Answers:**\n\nQ: What is the rule of giving?\nA: The rule of giving says that as the price of a thing or service goes up, the amount given also goes up.\n\nQ: What is the rule of wanting?\nA: The rule of wanting says that as the price of a thing or service goes up, the amount wanted goes down.\n\n**Part 2: Making Choices**\n\n**Idea:** Making choices is about the value of the next best thing that we give up when we make a choice.\n\n**Example:** Let's pretend you have $100 to spend on either new shoes or a movie ticket. If you choose to buy the shoes, the making choices cost is the fun you would have gotten from watching the movie.\n\n**Questions and Answers:**\n\nQ: What is making choices cost?\nA: Making choices cost is the value of the next best thing that we give up when we make a choice.\n\nQ: How does making choices cost relate to trade?\nA: Making choices cost is a key idea in trade because it helps us understand the value of choosing one thing over another.\n\n**Part 3: Market Types**\n\n**Idea:** A market type refers to the number and behavior of companies in a certain market.\n\n**Example:** A single seller is a market type where there is only one company selling a product or service. In this case, the company has total control over the market and can ask for higher prices because there are no other options available.\n\n**Questions and Answers:**\n\nQ: What is a single seller?\nA: A single seller is a market type where there is only one company selling a product or service.\n\nQ: How does the way we sell things change what we have?\nA: The way we sell things can change what kinds of things we make and how many we make.\n\n**In the end:** Learning about how we buy and sell things can help us understand how the world works and how we can use our money wisely. By knowing about things like how much we have of something, how much people want it, the choices we have to make, and the way we sell things, we can understand more about the world and make good choices for ourselves.\n\n**Words to Know:**\n\n- How much we have of something: How much of something people who make things are ready to sell at different prices over a certain time.\n- How much people want something: How much of something people who buy things are ready to buy at different prices over a certain time.\n- The choices we have to make: The worth of the next best thing that we give up when we make a choice.\n- The way we sell things: How many and how the people who sell things act in a certain way of selling things.\n- Only one person selling: A way of selling things where there is only one person selling a thing or a service.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 872, "idx": 247939, "original text": "Atlantic Cigar Co. will be getting a second release of the Viaje Exclusivo Lancero..

{"text": "Lesson: How to Look for Things\n\nHello there!\nToday, we will learn about how to look for things. We can use different ways to find what we need, like books, websites, and special lists. We also need to make sure that what we find is good and helpful.\n\nPart 1: Looking for Things\n\nFirst Way: Using Books\n\nThe library is a fun place to find things. Books can help us know a lot. If you want to find a book about something, you can use the library list. You can find books by who wrote them, what they are called, or what they are about. Once you find a book that you like, read a little of it to see if it is about what you want to know. If it is, you can take it home and start reading!\n\nSecond Way: Using Websites\n\nThe internet has a lot of things we can learn. But, not all websites are good. Some websites are written by people who know a lot, and some are not. To see if a website is good, look for these things:\n\n- Who wrote it? Do they know a lot about it?\n- Is the website from a good group?\n- Does the website have things to buy or ads?\n- Are there other places that say the same thing?\n\nAfter you see if a website is good, you can use it to find what you need. You can use things like GO company to find websites about what you want to know. Be sure to use words that are about your topic.\n\nThird Way: Using Special Lists\n\nSpecial lists have a lot of information that we can find. They have things about science, history, and stories. To use a special list, you might need a library card or a special word and password. Some special lists are free on the internet. To find what you need in a special list, you can use words or things to help your search.\n\nPart 2: Making Sure Things are Good\n\nFirst Way: Knowing What the Thing is For\n\nBefore you use what you find, you need to know what it is for. Is it to have fun, learn, or make you think something? Different things are for different uses, and you need to know what it is for before you can use it well.\n\nSecond Way: Making Sure It's Right\n\nEven if what you find is from a good place, you still need to make sure it's right. This means checking it with other places or people who know a lot. You can also think about it to see if it's good. Ask yourself if it makes sense, if it has proof, and if it agrees with what you know.\n\nThird Way: Thinking About Where It's From\n\nGetting information from a good place is as important as the information itself. You need to think about if you can trust the place the information came from. This includes the person who wrote it, the place it was published, and how it was published. You also need to think about if the information is reliable. This includes if the information is correct, complete, and up-to-date.\n\nPart 3: Using Information in the Right Way\n\nSubtopic 1: Saying Things in Your Own Words\n\nSaying things in your own words is when you take someone else's ideas and say them in your own way. This is important because it shows that you understand the information and can use it in your own thinking. To do this well, you need to use different words that mean the same thing, summarize the information, or explain the information in your own words.\n\nSubtopic 2: Saying Where You Got Information\n\nWhen you use information from somewhere, you need to say where you got it. This is called saying where you got information. There are different ways to do this, depending on where you got the information and the rules you are following. However, all should include this information:\n\n- The name of the person or group that is responsible for the information\n- The title of the work\n- The date it was published\n- The publisher\n\nSubtopic 3: Using Information to Fix Problems\n\nInformation is a tool that can help you fix problems. For example, if you are writing a paper, you can use information to support your ideas and provide proof for what you are saying. Likewise, if you are working on a project, you can use information to help you design and build your project. Always ask yourself how the information you find can help you fix the problem you are working on.\n\nEnding:\nIn this lesson, we learned how to find information using books, websites, and other places. We also learned how to check if information can be trusted and how to use it in the right way. By following these steps, we can become good at using information and use information to achieve our goals.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 717, "idx": 348436, "original text": "Need information?

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Growing and Shrinking Things\n\nIntroduction:\nGrowing and shrinking things are important in many areas. They describe how things grow and shrink and are used to explain real-world things like how populations grow, how things lose their radioactivity, and how interest rates work. In this lesson, we will learn about the properties of growing and shrinking things and how they are used in different situations.\n\nSection 1: Growing and Shrinking Things and Their Properties\n\nSubtopic 1: What are Growing and Shrinking Things and How to Represent Them\n- A growing and shrinking thing is a thing that grows and shrinks based on how much time has passed.\n- The most common things that grow and shrink are things that grow and shrink naturally and things that grow and shrink in complex ways.\n- The properties of growing and shrinking things include:\n  - They start at 1\n  - They become 0 when time goes backwards\nStory time: One day, we are going to talk about a magic hill. This hill is always uphill no matter where you are. We call this kind of hill an \"always-uphill\" hill.\n\nChapter 2: A special kind of magic\n\n- There is a special kind of magic that can make the hill always uphill. It's a little hard to understand, so we won't talk about it today. \n- But remember, magic can make things happen that we can't explain!\n\nChapter 2: A circle's role in the magic hill\n\nTopic 1: How do circles play a part?\n\n- The magic hill can have circles on it. These circles can affect the magic hill.\n- Circles can be very close to each other or very far from each other. This can change how the magic hill looks.\n\nTopic 2: Random and not-so-random patterns\n\n- Sometimes, the circles on the magic hill can form patterns. These patterns can be random or not so random.\n- We can see these patterns in many things, like how animals grow in numbers, how things get older and disappear, and even in money matters.\n- Understanding these patterns can help us know more about the magic hill.\n\nChapter 3: What did we learn today?\n\nIn our story today, we learned about the always-uphill hill and the magic that makes it always uphill. We also learned how circles can affect the hill and how they can form patterns. Lastly, we saw how these patterns can be seen in things around us.\n\nWords to Remember:\n- Always-uphill hill: A special kind of hill that is always uphill.\n- Circle: A round shape.\n- Pattern: A way that things are arranged.\n\nEnding Thoughts:\nKnowing about the always-uphill hill and the magic that makes it always uphill is fun! We can see this magic in many things around us. By understanding the magic hill, we can learn more about the world.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 891, "idx": 245840, "original text": "Entire functions of exponential type represented by pseudo-random and random Taylor series.

This game can be played in many ways like fixing old houses, letting people live in your houses for some money, and keeping houses for a long time so they become more valuable. In this lesson, we will learn about this fun game and how to start playing it.\nSection 1: Learning the House Buying and Selling Game\nTopic 1: Different Houses in the Game\n- There are four main types of houses in the game: houses where people live, shops, factories, and land.\n- Houses where people live can be one big house, apartments, group of houses, and big buildings with 4 or less apartments.\n- Shops include office buildings, stores, big rooms, and other buildings where people do their work.\n- Factories are places like big factories, making things, and other places where things are made or sent out.\n- Land is empty land or land without anything on it that can be bought and sold to make money.\nTopic 2: How to Start the House Buying and Selling Game\n- The first thing to do to start the game is to learn about it. This includes reading stories, going to talks, and meeting other players.\n- When you know a little about the game, you can start looking for houses to buy in the game. Look for houses that cost less or can become more valuable.\n- Think about playing with a person who knows a lot about houses.

{"text": "**Lesson: Games Where You Plan in Real Time**\n\n**Introduction:**\nGames where you plan in real time (RT) are a type of video game that people really like. In these games, players have to gather things, build stuff, and control teams to beat their opponents. One of the most well-known RT games is a game with a big following and is often thought of as one of the best games of its kind. In this lesson, we will learn about the basic ideas of RT games and how they can help us understand real-world problems.\n\n**Section 1: Basic Ideas**\n\n**Gathering Things:**\nIn this popular game, like in many other RT games, players have to gather things to build stuff and train teams. These things can be rocks, air, and supplies, each of which has its own special properties and uses. Players have to manage their things carefully to build a good team and beat their opponents.\n\n**Playing Against Others, Long Games, Only Seeing Part of the Game, Fast Decisions, Playing at the Same Time:**\nThis game is a game where players play against each other to win. It also can last a very long time, sometimes even hours. Players can only see part of the game at a time, and they have to make decisions quickly and well. Finally, the game lets multiple players play at the same time.\n\n**Challenge: Long Games, Length of Game 10K to 100K Pictures Versus Chess with Only a Few Moves:**\nOne of the challenges of playing this game is how long it can be. Players have to make decisions over a large number of pictures, which can range from 10,000 to 100,000 pictures. This is much longer than the number of moves in a game of chess, which is usually only a few moves. This means that players have to plan ahead to do well.\n\n**Designed the Game's AI as a Step by Step Search:**\nThe AI system used in this game, called the Game's AI, was designed to use a step by step search method. This means that the AI system breaks down the problem into smaller problems, and then solves each problem one by one before putting the solutions together to form a final solution.\n\n**Fast Decisions, Have to Make Moves Every Picture, 24+ Times Per Second:**\nTo do well, kids must make quick decisions while playing. They need to understand the game and choose the best thing to do. The game asks kids to make a move every moment, which can happen 24 or more times in a blink. This means kids need to think fast and clearly to do well.\n\n**Part 2: Using Skills in Problem Solving:**\n\n**What We Learn from Our Games Might Help with Problem Solving:**\nThe skills kids learn while playing can be used to solve real problems. By learning how to use things, build, and lead, kids are learning how to solve problems that can be used in many areas.\n\n**The End:**\nIn the end, the game is a liked game that asks kids to use things, build, and lead to win. The game has many hard parts, including the long game, part seen nature, and quick needs. However, the skills that kids learn while playing can be used to solve real problems. By learning how to use things, build, and lead, kids are learning how to solve problems that can be used in many areas.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 568, "idx": 203187, "original text": "Oriol introduces StarCraft, one of the most popular real time strategy games of all time, as a virtual world where you gather resources,.

{"text": "Story: Looking After Our World\n\n## Chapter 1: Saying Hi\nIn this story, we will learn about looking after our world. We will understand the steps to take care of our world and why it is important.\n\n## Chapter 2: What does it mean to look after our world?\nLooking after our world means checking if something we want to do might hurt the world around us. It is about gathering facts about how our actions might change the world, including the animals, plants, and people. The goal is to find out if our actions might cause problems and think of ways to stop these problems from happening.\n\n## Chapter 3: How to look after our world?\nHere are the steps we can take to look after our world:\n\n1. Thinking: This step is about deciding if what we want to do might hurt our world. If it might, we need to think about it more carefully.\n\n2. Planning: This step is about figuring out what parts of our world we need to think about. We need to talk to people who live nearby and those who help us make the rules.\n\n3. Gathering and Understanding Facts: This step is about collecting facts about how our actions might change our world and understanding these facts.\n\n4. Writing a Report: This step is about putting all our facts into a big report. This report tells us about the problems we might cause, ways to stop these problems, and other choices we could make.\n\n5. Sharing and Talking: This step is about letting everyone read our report and talk about it. People should have a chance to say what they think about what's in the report.\n\n6. Listening and Changing: This step is about hearing what people say about our report and maybe changing some things based on what they say.\n\n7. Saying Okay: This step is about getting a final okay for our report from the people who help us make the rules.\n\n## Chapter 4: Why is it important to look after our world?\nLooking after our world is important because it helps us find out if our actions might cause problems before they happen. By finding out early, we can think of ways to stop these problems. It also helps those who help us make the rules to have all the facts they need to make good choices about things that might change our world.\n\n## Chapter 5: Let's imagine\nLet's imagine a pretend example of wanting to build a big road. We would check how building this road might change our world, like hurting places where animals live, making too much noise, and bothering people who live nearby. We would think of ways to stop these problems, like building walls to keep the noise down, saving places where animals live, and helping people who are bothered by the road.\n\n## Words to Remember\n- Checking how a project might hurt nature (EIA): A step-by-step process that looks at the possible ways a planned project or idea might hurt nature.\n- Making things better: Steps taken to lessen or stop bad effects on nature.\n- People who care: People or groups who might be affected by a project or idea.\n\n## Wrapping Up\nIn this lesson, we learned why it's important to check how a planned project or idea might hurt nature (EIA) before starting it. We looked at the steps in checking this and talked about real-life examples of how this process can be used. By understanding why this checking is important, we can work towards keeping nature safe and making smart choices about projects that might hurt nature.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 591, "idx": 413358, "original text": "The clearance of the Crab and Winkle extension started today at 9am.

This lesson will look at why it's important to speak up when faced with hard situations, like what happened to Unilever's old boss when his company got in a fight with IS city over its ice cream business.\n\nSection 1: Why Speaking Up Matters\n\nTopic 1: Why should leaders speak up?\n- Leaders have a duty to the people who care about their business, including workers, customers, and people who own part of the company.\n- Speaking up about important issues can help change things and support fair treatment for everyone.\n- It can also help build trust and reliability with customers and other people who care about the business.\n\nTopic 2: When should leaders speak up?\n- When faced with issues that affect people or nature.\n- When there are cases of unfair treatment of workers or when people's rights are not respected.\n- When there are situations that could damage the company's good name.\n\nSection 2: Real-life Examples\n\nExample 1: A big sports company's Ad Campaign\n- In 2018, a big sports company ran an ad with a former football player, who had kneeled during the national anthem to protest bad treatment of black people by police.\n- The ad caused a lot of debate, with some people refusing to buy the company's products. But, it also got a lot of attention and increased sales.\n\nExample 2: A clothing company's ideas on climate change\n- A clothing company has been open about its ideas on climate change and the need to protect nature.\n- In 2017, the company took legal action against the government for making the Bears Ears National Monument in UT smaller.\n- This action got both positive and negative reactions, but it showed the company's commitment to what it believes in.\n\nSection 3: Self-Debating Discussions\n\nTopic 1: Should leaders focus on making money or supporting fair treatment for everyone?\n- Both are important, but leaders should think about the long-term effects of their choices on people.\n- Sometimes, taking a stand on an issue can lead to losing money in the short term but can be good for the company's good name and profits in the end.\n\nTopic 2: How can leaders make sure their voices are heard?\n- They should use many ways to talk, like sharing on social media, sending news, and talking directly with friends.\n- They should also work with other groups and places that like the same things to make their message louder.\n\nEnding:\nTalking out loud as a group leader can be hard, but it is important to help fairness and build trust with friends. By knowing what their choices do and being ready to stand up, group leaders can help make the world better.\n\nWords to know:\n- Friends: People or groups who want a group's success, like workers, buyers, share-owners, and makers.\n- Fairness: The kind treatment of people and groups based on who they are, like their color, boy or girl, and how much money they have.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 763, "idx": 371143, "original text": "- BySky News-.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Simple Math\n\n## Part 1: Easy Ideas\n\nSimple math problems help us understand how two things relate. They can be shown like this: `a + b = c`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are amounts, and `a` and `b` are things we know. We can solve these problems to find the value of `a` or `b`, if we know `c`.\n\n## Part 2: Questions and Answers\n\n**Question**: What is the difference between simple math problems and harder ones?\n\n**Answer**: Simple math problems only have things we know raised to the power of one. Harder problems have things we know raised to the power of two. Simple problems can be solved in easy ways, while harder problems need more steps, like splitting or completing the square.\n\n**Question**: How many answers does a simple math problem have?\n\n**Answer**: A simple math problem can have one or many answers. If it has no answer, it doesn't make sense. If it has one answer, it makes sense. If it has many answers, it depends on other things.\n\n## Part 3: Real-Life Examples\n\nImagine you have $1000 in your piggy bank and you want to add $500 more. After a year, your money will have grown by $50. Let `a` stand for the number of years you will keep the money in the bank, and let `b` stand for the total amount of money you will have after `a` years. We can make a simple math problem to show this:\n\n`1000 + 500a = 1000a + 50b`\n\nWe can find out how much more money you will have after some years by looking at `y`.\n\n## Part 4: Word List\n\n- Line rule: A rule that shows how two things can be connected.\n- Thing: A letter that can mean a number that can change in a rule.\n- Fixed thing: A letter that means a number that does not change in a rule.\n- Big number: The biggest number a thing can be in a rule.\n- Fits: A rule that has one answer.\n- Can be many: A rule that has many answers.\n- Does not fit: A rule that has no answer.\n\n## The End\n\nLine rules are very important in math and can help us in real life. By knowing the basic ideas and solving easy examples, you can understand better how these rules work and how they can be used to solve problems in different areas.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 854, "idx": 635083, "original text": "Q:\n\nSimple alternative to GNU Readline library not GPL\n\nI love the GNU readline library, but since it is under a GPL license, I can not use it for commercial software.

{"text": "Introduction:\nSurfactants are compounds that lower the surface tension between two liquids, a gas and a liquid, or a liquid and a solid. They are commonly used in personal care products such as shampoos, soaps, and detergents. In this lesson, we will learn about the different types of surfactants, their properties, and how they are used in personal care products.\n\nTypes of Surfactants:\nThere are four main types of surfactants: anionic, cationic, nonionic, and amphoteric.\n\n1. Anionic Surfactants: These surfactants have a negative charge and are commonly used in soap and detergents. Examples include sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and sodium laureth sulfate (SLES).\n\n2. Cationic Surfactants: These surfactants have a positive charge and are often used in fabric softeners and hair conditioners. Examples include quaternium-18 and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB).\n\n3. Nonionic Surfactants: These surfactants do not have a charge and are commonly used in cosmetic products. Examples include polyethylene glycol (PEG) and alcohol ethoxylates.\n\n4. Amphoteric Surfactants: These surfactants can have either a positive or negative charge depending on the pH of the solution. Examples include cocamidopropyl betaine and lauramidopropyl betaine.\n\nProperties of Surfactants:\nSurfactants have several properties that make them useful in personal care products:\n\n1. Wetting: Surfactants help water mix with oils and solids, allowing them to be removed from the skin or hair.\n\n2. Emulsification: Surfactants help mix two immiscible liquids, such as oil and water, to form an emulsion.\n\n3. Foaming: Surfactants help create foam, which can help clean and remove dirt and grime.\n\n4. Conditioning: Some surfactants can help condition the skin or hair, leaving them soft and smooth.\n\nApplication in Personal Care Products:\nSurfactants are used in a variety of personal care products, including:\n\n1. Shampoos and Soaps: Anionic surfactants are commonly used in these products to help remove dirt and grime from the skin or hair.\n\n2. Body Washes and Bubble Baths: Nonionic surfactants are often used in these products to create a rich lather and leave the skin soft and moisturized.\n\n3. Hand Soaps: Both anionic and nonionic surfactants can be used in hand soaps to help remove dirt and germs while leaving the hands moisturized.\n\n Hair Care: Helpful stuff like soap makes our hair nice and easy to brush.\n\nEnd:\nIt's good to know how this stuff works for making our hair and skin clean and soft.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 729, "idx": 262999, "original text": "Description.

They can help us think about new ideas or things we could do better.\n\n### Part 2: What \"The Big Hour\" Says\n\n\"The Big Hour\" is a story about being strong and brave. It's about a place where a mean group called the Big Four doesn't let people be themselves. The people in the story have to be careful about what they say and do. The story tells us that it's important to stand up for what's right.\n\n### Part 3: Why Some People Didn't Like the Book\n\n\"The Big Hour\" came out in a time when people were not very happy. Some people didn't like the book because it said things they didn't want to hear. They didn't want people to read it, so they stopped letting people have it. This shows us that stories can be powerful and can make people think.\n\n### Part 4: Why Make-Believe Stories are Important\n\nMake-believe stories are important because they help us think about hard things in a fun and safe way.

We have investigated the hydroxyl radical ((\u2022)OH) initiated oxidation chemistry of the simplest enol, vinyl alcohol (ethenol, CH2\u2550CHOH), using quantum chemical calculations and energy-grained master equation simulations. A lifetime of around 4 h was determined for vinyl alcohol in the presence of tropospheric levels of (\u2022)OH. The reaction proceeds by (\u2022)OH addition at both the \u03b1 (66%) and \u03b2 (33%) carbons of the \u03c0-system, yielding the C-centered radicals (\u2022)CH2CH(OH)2, and HOCH2C(\u2022)HOH, respectively. Subsequent trapping by O2 leads to the respective peroxyl radicals. About 90% of the chemically activated population of the major peroxyl radical adduct (\u2022)O2CH2CH(OH)2 is predicted to undergo fragmentation to produce formic acid and formaldehyde, with regeneration of (\u2022)OH. The minor peroxyl radical HOCH2C(OO(\u2022))HOH is even less stable and undergoes almost exclusive HO2(\u2022) elimination to form glycolaldehyde (HOCH2CHO). Formation of the latter has not been proposed before in the oxidation of vinyl alcohol. A kinetic mechanism for use in atmospheric modeling is provided, featuring phenomenological rate coefficients for formation of the three main product channels ((\u2022)O2CH2CH(OH)2 [8%]; HC(O)OH + HCHO + (\u2022)OH [56%]; HOCH2CHO + HO2(\u2022) [37%]). Our study supports previous findings that vinyl alcohol should be rapidly removed from the atmosphere by reaction with (\u2022)OH and O2 with glycolaldehyde being identified as a previously unconsidered product. Most importantly, it is shown that direct chemically activated reactions can lead to (\u2022)OH and HO2(\u2022) (HOx) recycling.", "hash": "e3c42816576f77c6bfa48ec477a7086fd9510d497eb7a35a9d8381c398956170"}

{"text": "Story: Learning About Water Systems\n\n**Start:** Water systems are found in many places because they can move things far away. In this story, we will learn about the parts of a water system and how they work together to move things.\n\n**Part 1: Parts of a Water System**\n\nA water system has several parts that work together to move things. These parts include:\n\n1. Pump - A thing that changes push energy into water energy by making the water tight.\n2. Tank - A big box that holds the water.\n3. Gates - Things that control the way of the water in the system.\n4. Movers - Things that change water energy into push energy.\n5. Cleaners - Things that take away dirty stuff from the water.\n\n**Part 2: How Water Systems Work**\n\nWater systems work by using tightness to move things. When the pump makes the water tight, it creates water tightness that moves the water through the system. This tightness is sent to the mover, which changes the water energy into push energy. The push energy is then used to do work.\n\n**Part 3: Real Examples**\n\nWater systems are used in many ways, such as:\n\n1. Big tools - Water systems are used to work cranes, diggers, and other big machines.\n2. Cars - Water systems are used to work brakes, steering wheels, and bouncy things in cars and trucks.\n3. Making things - Water systems are used to work presses, stamping machines, and other work tools.\n\n**Word List:**\n\n- Water system: A system that uses water tightness to move things.\n- Pump: A thing that changes push energy into water energy by making the water tight.\n- Tank: A big box that holds the water.\n- Gates: Things that control the way of the water in the system.\n- Movers: Things that change water energy into push energy.\n- Cleaners: Things that take away dirty stuff from the water.\n\n**Finish:** Knowing the parts of a water system and how they work together is good for anyone who wants to work with these systems.

{"text": "Story: Learning About Sharing and Watching Services\n\nBeginning:\nIn our time, watching services have become a liked way to see things like movies, songs, and TV shows. But, the rules of these services have been talked about a lot, especially when it comes to sharing rules. In this story, we will learn about the idea of sharing, why it's important, and how it connects to watching services.\n\nPart 1: What is Sharing?\nHaving your own idea is special. It can be a story, a song, or a drawing. Having your own idea means you can choose what to do with it. You can show it to other people, or you can make copies of it. This is called having a \"right to your idea\".\n\nChapter 2: Why are Ideas Special?\nHaving a right to your idea is important because it means that only you can decide what to do with it. Without this right, anyone could take your idea without asking you or giving you something for it. This would not be fair.\n\nChapter 3: Watching Shows and Having Ideas\nThere are places on the internet where you can watch movies and TV shows, like NF and AP. They can show these movies and TV shows because they ask the people who had the ideas first. But some places on the internet, like AE and FO, do not ask first. This is not fair and has caused some disagreements.\n\nAE and FO let people watch live TV shows on the internet. They do not ask the people who had the ideas for the TV shows first. This is not fair and has caused some disagreements. Some people think AE and FO are okay, but others do not.\n\nChapter 4: Thinking Carefully\nAs someone who watches shows on the internet, it is important to think about this. Some places on the internet might let you watch shows for free, but this might not be fair to the people who had the ideas for the shows.

{"text": "Lesson: Let's Learn About Building Things\n\n## Start\nIn this lesson, we will learn about building things, which involves giving help to builders, helpers, and lending places for the purpose of buying, making, or fixing big buildings. We will learn the basics of building things, including the different types of buildings, the job of a builder, and the things that make a building valuable. After this story, you will know more about the big building business. You will use this knowledge in real life.\n\n## Part 1: Big Building Business \n\n### Thing 1: What is Big Building Business?\nBig building business is when we use buildings for work, like offices, shops, big factories, and big houses. People rent these buildings for some time. The money from the rent is used to pay for the building.\n\n### Thing 2: Different Big Buildings\nThere are many types of big buildings, like:\n- Offices: Buildings used for work.\n- Shops: Buildings where we sell things to people.\n- Factories: Buildings where we make things.\n- Big Houses: Many people live in these buildings and pay rent.\n\n### Thing 3: The Job of a Big Building Helper\nA big building helper is a person who helps people buy or sell big buildings. They know a lot about the buildings, the place around the buildings, the cost of the buildings, and how to pay for them.\n\n## Part 2: Things that Change the Cost of Big Buildings\n\n### Thing 1: Where is the Building?\nWhere the building is, is very important. Buildings in busy places, near buses and trains, and where people want to work or live are more expensive than buildings in quiet places.\n\n### Thing 2: How Does the Building Look?\nHow the building looks also changes its cost. New buildings, buildings that don't waste energy, and buildings with nice shared spaces cost more than old or dirty buildings.\n\n### Thing 3: How is the Money World?\nHow the money world is doing also changes the cost of the building. When the money world is doing well, more people want buildings and the cost goes up. But when the money world is not doing well, less people want buildings and the cost goes down.\n\n## Part 3: How to Get Money for Big Buildings\n\n### Thing 1: How to Get a Money Helper\nTo get a money helper for a big building, first, find a helper who can give you the money you need. Then you fill out a form with information about the building, about your money history, and what you will do with the money. After the helper looks at the form and says yes, you will know how much money you will get and how you need to pay it back.\n\n### Topic 3.2: Types of Building Helpers\nThere are several types of building helpers, including:\n- Piggy bank helpers: These helpers allow kids to use the savings they have collected in their piggy banks.\n- Bridge helpers: These are helpers that are used to \"bridge\" the gap between selling one toy and buying another.\n- Building helpers: These helpers are used to help build new playhouses.\n- Forever helpers: These helpers are used to buy an existing playhouse or to help pay for a helper you already have.\n\n### Topic 3.3: Helper Rules\nThe rules of a building helper will change depending on who you're borrowing from, how good you've been, and the specifics of the playhouse being bought. However, some common helper rules include:\n- Helper cost: This is how much you need to pay the helper each year.\n- Toy-to-playhouse rule: This is how much of the playhouse's value the helper is willing to give you.\n- Payback time: This is how long you have to pay back the helper.\n- Early finish fee: This is a fee that may be charged if you pay off the helper early.\n\n## The End\nIn this lesson, we have talked about the basics of building helpers, including the different types of helpers, the role of a building helper friend, and the things that make a playhouse valuable. We have also learned about the building helper process, including how to get a helper, the different types of helpers available, and the helper rules that are usually used. By understanding these things, you will be better prepared to navigate the world of building helpers and make smart choices about getting helpers for your own playhouse projects.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 8, "len": 944, "idx": 311358, "original text": "We are a full service commercial mortgage banker and real estate advisor established in 1957 with offices in Ft.

{"text": "Lesson: Let's Learn About Taking Photos\n\n## Section 1: Learning New Things\n\nTaking photos is the fun of catching light and making it into a picture. It needs using a camera to keep a moment in time, stopping it forever. In this lesson, we will learn about the easy parts of taking photos, including the light triangle, setting up, and the different kinds of cameras.\n\n### Questions and Answers\n\nQ: What is the light triangle?\nA: The light triangle is the balance between speed, opening, and brightness. These three things decide the amount of light that goes into the camera and how it is kept on the picture taker.\n\nQ: What is setting up?\nA: Setting up is the way things are put in a photo. It talks about the place of things, colors, and looks to make a nice looking picture. Good setting up can make a photo more fun and pleasing to look at.\n\nQ: What are the different kinds of cameras?\nA: There are many kinds of cameras, including big cameras, mirrorless cameras, and easy cameras. Big cameras are loved by many grown-up picture takers, while little cameras are liked more and more because they are not heavy. Simple cameras are easy to use and are great for beginners.\n\n## Part 2: Easy Examples\n\nNow that we know some easy ideas, let's see some examples. We will learn how to use the light triangle to take better pictures, how to set up a picture well, and how to pick the right camera for you.\n\n### Example 1: Using the Light Triangle\n\nLet's say you are taking a picture of a pretty place when the sun is going down. To get a good picture, you need to balance the amount of light coming into the camera. You could make the picture brighter, but this may make it look rough. Or, you could let more light in, but this may make the picture look blurry if things are moving. By changing the hole, you can control how much of the picture is in focus and make a more interesting picture.\n\n### Example 2: Setting up a Picture\n\nWhen setting up a picture, there are a few easy rules to follow. One rule suggests splitting the picture into nine equal parts and putting the thing you're taking a picture of at the cross of the lines. Another way is to use lines, like a road or a fence, to guide the viewer's eye through the picture. Lastly, framing is important to create a sense of depth and perspective.\n\n### Example 3: Picking the Right Camera\n\nIf you are looking to buy a camera, there are a few things to think about. First, decide whether you want a big camera or a little camera. Big cameras give you more control and are generally more strong, while little cameras are lighter and easier to carry. Also, think about the size of the pictures, as bigger pictures result in larger images. Lastly, think about the lenses available for the camera, as this will change your ability to take different types of pictures.\n\n## Part 3: Real Pictures\n\nNow that we have learned the easy ideas and seen some examples, let's look at some real pictures. We will look at famous pictures to see how the light triangle, setting up, and camera choice affect the final picture.\n\n### Looking at Picture 1: \"The Big Wave\" by Henry\n\nIn this famous picture, Henry uses the rule to make a balanced picture. The wave is placed along the top line, while the boats and the light house are placed along the bottom line. Also, the use of lines, like the wave and the light house, guides the viewer's eye throughout the picture.\n\n### Looking at Picture 2: \"Mother with Kids\" by Madison\n\nIn this strong picture, Madison uses a shallow focus to draw attention to the mother and her kids. The hole setting creates a blurry background, which makes the emotional connection between the subjects stronger. Also, the way the picture is put together, with the subjects on the left side, makes it feel close and open.\n\n## Words to Know\n\nBright Picture: How light or dark a picture is, from how fast the camera clicks, how big the hole in the camera is, and how sensitive it is to light.\n\nPutting Together: Where things are in a picture.\n\nCamera: A tool that can take pictures.\n\nSmall Camera: A camera that is small and light because it doesn't use a mirror.\n\nEasy Camera: An easy camera with not many buttons to press.\n\nBig Number: One million tiny dots in a picture.\n\nDividing Picture: A way to make a picture that splits it into nine same parts and puts the subject where the lines cross.\n\nGuiding Lines: Lines in a picture that lead your eyes around the frame.\n\nMaking a Frame: Using things in a picture to make it feel deep and far.\n\nEnd of Lesson\n\nIn this lesson, we learned about how to take good pictures, like how to make a picture bright, how to put things in a picture, and the different types of cameras. We also looked at real pictures and talked about how we use these ideas in real life. By knowing these ideas, we can take nicer pictures and tell interesting stories with our pictures.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 8, "len": 576, "idx": 630850, "original text": "About Me.

{"text": "Lesson: Group Complaints\n\nIntroduction:\nGroup complaints are when a bunch of people get together to say a big company did something wrong. These complaints give a chance for people to protect their rights and make big companies pay for what they did. In this lesson, we will learn about the basics of group complaints, including what they are, how they work, and why they are important.\n\nI. What is a Group Complaint?\nA group complaint is when one or more people, known as \"group leaders,\" speak up for themselves and other people who have similar complaints against a company. The group leader is usually someone who has been hurt by the company's actions. The group members are the people who are affected by the company's actions but do not have to join the complaint.\n\nII. How do Group Complaints Work?\nGroup complaints are complicated and need careful planning. The first step in making a group complaint is to gather evidence to support the complaint. This may involve collecting papers, talking to people who saw what happened, and looking at information. Once the evidence is collected, the group leader makes a complaint in court, which tells the story of what happened and why the company should pay.\n\nThe company then has a chance to respond to the complaint. If the court decides that the complaint is fair, it will approve the group, meaning that the complaint can go ahead for all group members. The group leader and the company will then share information and papers related to the complaint.\n\nAfter sharing information, they may talk about a settlement or go to court. If they go to court, a group of people will decide whether the company did something wrong and, if so, how much money the company should pay. If the people decide in favor of the group leaders, the court will give money to the group members.\n\nIII. Why are Group Complaints Important?\nGroup complaints are important because they let people stand up to powerful companies and make them pay for their actions. Without group complaints, people might not have the money or know-how to take on big companies in court. Group complaints also stop companies from doing bad things in the future, as companies know that they might have to pay for their actions.\n\nIV. Conclusion\nIn conclusion, group complaints are an important way for people to protect their rights against big companies. By sticking together, group members can make companies pay for their actions and ask for money for any harm caused. Understanding the basics of group complaints can help us know why they are important in our world and how they help protect people's rights.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 696, "idx": 176038, "original text": "Class Actions.

{"text": "Lesson: Introduction to Digital Money Rules\n\n## Section 1: Simple Ideas\nIn this lesson, we will learn about the rules of digital money, specifically focusing on JP country's rule on buying digital money. We will talk about the idea of rules and how they apply to digital money.\n\n## Part 2: Fun Examples\nLet's think about a pretend story where a person buys 100 pretend coins for $10,000. If the 8% extra charge is applied, the person would have to pay an extra $800. This could make people not want to buy pretend coins or other pretend monies, as it makes it more expensive. However, if there is no extra charge, the person would not have to pay any extra on their pretend coin purchase.\n\n## Part 3: Real Life Examples\nJA country's choice to remove the 8% extra charge on pretend coin purchases has changed the country's digital economy a lot. With no extra charge, more people are likely to get pretend monies, leading to more trade and growth in the industry. Also, other countries may do the same and remove similar charges, promoting the growth of the pretend money market even more.\n\n## Word List\n- Pretend Money: A digital or pretend money that uses secret codes for safety.\n- Extra Charge: A charge added on items or services rather than income or wealth.\n- Purchase Charge: A type of extra charge put on the buying of items and services.\n- Pretend Coin: A pretend money created in 2009 by a person or group we do not know.\n\n## The End\nUnderstanding the extra charges of pretend monies like pretend coin is very important for anyone interested in pretend monies.

He also started singing his own songs and made many albums.\nSection 2: Gabriel's Music\nGabriel's music is unique because he uses ideas from many different types of music. He has written songs for orchestras, musical plays, and pop albums. His songs are special because they have complicated arrangements and harmonies, but they also have strong melodies and feelings.\nSection 3: \"Craigslistlieder\"\nOne of Gabriel's most famous songs is called \"Craigslistlieder,\" which he wrote a while ago. These songs are based on messages that he found on a website. Gabriel used these messages as lyrics and made them into songs. The songs are funny, touching, and sometimes even sad. Many different singers have sung these songs.\nSection 4: Other Songs\nBesides \"Craigslistlieder,\" Gabriel has written many other songs. He has written songs for the piano, as well as a big play called \"The Ambassador.\" He has also worked with many other people, including a big group of musicians who named him their first resident composer a while back.\nConclusion:\nGabriel is a true artist who has made a lot of wonderful and touching music. By mixing different types of music, he has shown that music can be many different things and has inspired many people to be creative and try new things. Whether you like classical music or pop music, there is something for everyone in Gabriel's music. Gabriel's music also shows us that music can bring people together.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 942, "idx": 327965, "original text": "How do you label a guy who has composed a cycle of songs based on Craigslist personal ads, writes folksy pop sound collages that recall Sufjan Stevens, sings Schumann lieder in the dusky tones of a singer/songwriter, and is the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra's first composer-in-residence?.

Kahane, 31, has written orchestral song cycles, musical theater pieces, produced pop albums, and composed piano sonatas. He composed his quirky set of eight \"Craigslistlieder\" in 2006, and was performing them in downtown New York City bars when they began to find their way into other singers' recitals at places like Carnegie Hall. Suddenly, the perceived boundaries between pop and classical became less distinct for an entire generation of artists.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Brain Health\n\nIntroduction:\nThere are some diseases that can slowly hurt our brains. One of these diseases is called Alzheimer's disease, which happens when there are too many bad proteins in the brain. In this lesson, we will learn about these bad proteins and how they can cause diseases.\n\nStory 1: Learning About the Role of Sticky Stuff in Brain Troubles\n\nTopic 1: Sticky Stuff\nSticky stuff is something we can find in our brains. Usually, it can move around easily. But in a brain sickness called Alzheimer's, the sticky stuff clumps together and makes a mess in the brain. \n\nTopic 2: Looking at Family Stories\nLooking at family stories, we learn that if the sticky stuff does not work well, it can cause forgetfulness. This means that changes in what makes the sticky stuff can lead to Alzheimer's.\n\nStory 2: Understanding More About Brain Troubles\n\nTopic 1: More About Sticky Stuff\nBy studying more, we understand better about the role of sticky stuff in Alzheimer's. We learned that the sticky stuff is very important in the sickness and is involved in making a mess in the brain.\n\nTopic 2: Other Brain Troubles\nApart from Alzheimer's, there are other brain troubles like frontotemporal forgetfulness and Lewy body forgetfulness. These also involve the clumping of different sticky stuff in the brain. But the way it happens is similar to Alzheimer's.\n\nStory 3: Using What We Know to Solve New Problems\n\nTopic 1: Understanding Why People Forget Things\nBy understanding the role of sticky stuff in Alzheimer's, we can start to make medicines that aim at this sticky stuff to stop or slow down the sickness.\n\nTopic 2: Making New Medicines\nWith a better understanding of brain troubles, scientists can make new medicines that aim at what causes Alzheimer's and other similar troubles.\n\nThe End:\nIn this story, we have learned about the role of sticky stuff in Alzheimer's and other similar troubles. We have also explored more about brain troubles and how this understanding can be used to make new medicines. By understanding why people forget things and making targeted medicines, we can help to make the lives of those affected by brain troubles better.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 868, "idx": 482674, "original text": "One hundred years ago a small group of psychiatrists described the abnormal protein deposits in the brain that define the most common neurodegenerative diseases.

{"text": "Story: Picking the Best Paper for Drawing\nBeginning:\nPicking the best paper for your drawing can be hard, especially if you're not sure what to look for. In this story, we will learn about different kinds of paper and what makes them good for drawing.\nPart 1: Kinds of Paper\nThere are many kinds of paper to choose from, each with its own special features. The most common types of paper are:\n- Regular paper: This is the paper we use most often for drawing. It's good for all kinds of drawings and is perfect for everyday use.\n- Thick paper: This is a thicker and stronger type of paper that's great for making cards, posters, and other things that need to be stronger.\n- Shiny paper: This is a special type of paper that's perfect for printing pictures. It has a shiny finish that makes the colors look bright and the pictures stand out.\nPart 2: What to Think About\nWhen picking paper for your drawings, there are several things you should think about, including:\n- Paper weight: How heavy the paper is tells you how thick it is. Heavier papers are stronger and can handle more colors, while lighter papers are best for detailed drawings.\n- Finish: The finish of the paper tells you what it feels like. For example, a smooth finish is not shiny or glossy, while a shiny finish is bright and reflects light.\n- Color: Depending on what you're drawing, you might want to pick a specific color of paper. For example, if you're drawing a picture that needs a cover, you might want to pick a light-colored paper to make it stand out.\n- Brand: There are many brands of paper to choose from, each with its own special features. Some brands are known for their detailed drawings, while others are known for being strong.\nPart 3: Real Examples\nLet's say you need to draw a picture for school. You would want to pick a heavy paper with a smooth finish to make sure that the drawing is good and strong enough to handle any notes or marks. If you're printing a photo book, you would want to pick shiny paper to make the colors look bright and the pictures stand out.\nThe End:\nIn the end, picking the right paper for your drawing is important to make sure your drawings look their best. By thinking about things like paper weight, finish, color, and brand, you can find the perfect paper for you.

{"text": "Story: Group Problems\n\nBeginning:\nGroup problems are when a group of kids work together to solve a problem for themselves and others who have similar problems. In this story, we will learn about group problems, their good sides, and how they work.\n\nSection 1: What is a Big Group Problem?\nA big group problem is a type of problem where one or more kids (the \"big problem helpers\") bring a problem on behalf of themselves and other kids who have similar problems. The big problem helpers are chosen by the teacher because they have the same type of problem as the other kids in the group.\n\nSection 2: Good Things about Big Group Problems\nThere are several good things about big group problems. First, they let kids with small problems join together to solve bigger problems that they could not solve alone. Second, they help to make things fair between kids and big people by letting kids join together to stand up against big powers. Finally, big group problems can help to change things that are not fair and make big people do the right thing.\n\nSection 3: How Big Group Problems Work\nBig group problems usually involve a group of kids who have been hurt by a big person's actions. The big problem helpers tell the teacher about the problem on behalf of themselves and the other kids in the group. They must tell the teacher that the big person did something wrong that caused hurt to the kids in the group.\n\nOnce they tell the teacher about the problem, the big person has a chance to respond. If the teacher decides that the problem should be solved as a big group problem, she will say the group is ready. The big problem helpers then look for proofs, which involve finding things to show their problem is real.\n\nAfter they find all the proofs, the kids talk with the big person to solve the problem. If they can solve the problem by talking, the teacher must agree with the solution. If they cannot solve the problem by talking, the teacher will decide if the big person did something wrong to the kids and, if so, what the big person should do to make it right.\n\nEnding:\nIn the end, big group problems are an important way for kids to make big people do the right thing. By telling the teacher about their problems and the problems of other kids who have similar problems, big problem helpers can make things fair and look for the right thing for kids who have been hurt.\n\nWords to Know:\n- Big group problem: a type of problem where one or more kids tell the teacher about a problem on behalf of themselves and others who have similar problems\n- Big problem helper: the kid or kids who tell the teacher about the big group problem on behalf of themselves and others\n- Say the group is ready: when the teacher decides that the problem should be solved as a big group problem\n- Look for proofs: the process of finding things to show that a problem is real in a problem-solving process\n- Solve by talking: an agreement between the kids and the big person to solve a problem without the teacher's final decision\n\nThink for Yourself:\nDo you think big group problems are a good way to make big people do the right thing?

{"text": "Lesson: Learning about Borrowing and Sharing\n\nIntroduction:\nBorrowing is when we get something from someone, promising to give it back later. Both people, companies, and leaders use it to get things they need. But, if we borrow too much, it can cause problems. In this lesson, we will learn about borrowing, how it affects everyone, and how to do it the right way.\n\nSection 1: What is Borrowing?\nBorrowing is when we get something from someone else, promising to give it back later. Sometimes, when we borrow, we have to give back a little bit more. There are two types of borrowing: one where we promise something in return, like when we borrow money to buy a house, and one where we don't need to promise anything, like when we use a credit card.\n\nSection 2: How Borrowing Affects Everyone\nBorrowing can be good and bad. It can help people and companies get things that can make them money, like a house or machines. But, if we borrow too much, it can cause problems. For example, when a leader borrows too much money, it can cause the price of things to go up or they might not be able to pay it back, which can cause problems for everyone.\n\nSection 3: Doing Borrowing the Right Way\nDoing borrowing the right way means planning how much you can borrow, spending less, and earning more. Here are some tips:\n\n1. Make a plan: A plan helps you keep track of what you get and what you spend, so you can find out where you can spend less.\n\n2. Spend less: Find ways to spend less, like stopping subscriptions or buying less things you don't need.\n\n3. Earn more: Think about getting another job or finding ways to get more money, like starting a small business.\n\n4. Pay back first: Pay back the money that charges more first, like credit cards, while paying the least amount on other money you borrowed.\n\nConclusion:\nIn the end, learning about borrowing and how it affects everyone is important for using your money the right way. By following these tips, you can make a plan to borrow wisely and avoid problems. Remember to pay back first, make a plan, and spend less to increase your chances of not having money problems.\n\nGlossary:\n- Borrowing: Getting something from someone else, promising to give it back later.\n- Promised Borrowing: Borrowing where you promise something in return, like a mortgage.\n- Non-Promised Borrowing: Borrowing where you don't need to promise anything, like credit card debt.\n- Plan: A plan that shows you what you get and what you spend.\n- Price Increase: When the price of things goes up.\n- Not Paying Back: When you can't give back what you borrowed as promised.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 3962, "idx": 315907, "original text": "The French government plans to overhaul the state-owned railway firm SNCF, French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced on Monday.\n\nSNCF's debts run to about \u20ac45 billion ($55.52 billion), which puts it in an \"alarming situation,\" Phillipe said, adding that he was \"not looking for a fight.\"\n\nFew French governments have dared take on the powerful railway unions, but French President Emmanuel Macron is seeking to leverage his political capital to push through reforms as part of his wider strategy of freeing up a stagnant labor market.\n\n\"Whether or not they take the train, the French are paying more and more for a public service that works less and less well,\" he said, adding that running a French train is 30 percent more expensive than elsewhere in Europe.\n\n\"It's time to dare to go ahead with a reform the French people know is needed,\" he said.\n\nA traveler waits on a platform at the Saint-Charles station in Marseille, during a national strike by SNCF railway staff in 2014\n\nAvoiding privatization\n\nA report submitted to the government earlier in February recommended the company's debt be reallocated within the public sector.

{"text": "Story: Learning about Group Studies\n\n### What we will learn:\nGroup studies are projects where we look at a big group of people to learn about a health problem or condition. These studies help us know how many people have certain diseases or problems.\n\n### What you will know after this story:\nAt the end of this story, you will be able to:\n- Know what a group study is\n- Understand why group studies are important in learning about health\n- Know the steps to do a group study\n\n### Part 1: What is a Group Study?\n\nA big group study is a kind of project where we learn about a lot of people from a certain group to know more about a health problem. This kind of study helps us know how common a sickness is, how many new cases there are, and what things might cause it in a certain group of people.\n\n### Part 2: Why Big Group Studies are Important in Doctor's Research\n\nBig group studies are important in doctor's research because they tell us important things about a group of people's health. These studies can help find out what things might cause certain conditions, how common a sickness is, and if treatments are working. Also, big group studies can show if some groups of people have more health problems than others.\n\n### Part 3: How to Do a Big Group Study\n\nDoing a big group study involves several steps, including:\n\n1. Choosing the group: The first step in doing a big group study is to choose the group of people to study. This might involve picking a certain place or group of people based on things like age, boy or girl, or where they come from.\n\n2. Picking a small group: Once the big group is chosen, a small group of people is picked to take part in the study. This small group should be big enough to give right results but small enough to do easily and not cost too much.\n\n3. Gathering information: Information is gathered from the people in the study through questions, chats, check-ups, or other ways, depending on what we want to find out.\n\n4. Looking at the information: The information gathered is looked at using counting methods to answer the questions we have.\n\n5. Explaining and sharing the results: The results of the study are explained and shared in a way that others can understand.\n\n### Part 4: Word List\n\n- **Big Group**: A lot of people who share something in common.\n- **Small Group**: Some people from the big group chosen to take part in a study.\n- **How Common**: How much of the big group has a certain sickness or condition.\n- **New Cases**: The number of new times a sickness or condition happens in the big group over a certain time.\n- **Things that Might Cause**: Things that might make it more likely to get a certain sickness or condition.\n- **Health Differences**: Differences in health between different groups within the big group.\n\n### Ending:\nTo sum up, big group studies are useful tools in doctor's research that give important information about a group of people's health.

{"text": "Lesson: Cool Tools for Sounds\n\n**Introduction:**\nCool tools called digital filters are very important in dealing with sounds. They help us make sounds better or find out important things from them. One kind of cool tool is the 'FIR' filter. We like 'FIR' filters because they work fast and can be made to work the same way all the time.\n\n**Main Idea:**\nThe main idea of this lesson is to know the basics of cool tools and 'FIR' filters. We will learn about what 'FIR' filters look like, why they are good, and how they can be made.\n\n**Part 1: Learning About Cool Tools**\n\n**Topic 1.1: What is a Cool Tool?**\nA cool tool is like a magic trick that helps us change a sound to remove bad parts or to make good parts better. Cool tools are used in many things, like making music sound better, making pictures look better, and helping us talk to each other.\n\n**Topic 1.2: Different Kinds of Cool Tools**\nThere are two main kinds of cool tools: 'FIR' filters and 'IIR' filters. 'FIR' filters have a certain number of steps, while 'IIR' filters have endless steps. We like 'FIR' filters more than 'IIR' filters because they work faster and the same way all the time.\n\n**Part 2: 'FIR' Filters**\n\n**Topic 2.1: What Does an 'FIR' Filter Look Like?**\nAn 'FIR' filter is made up of a series of steps that are all the same distance apart. Each step is changed by a certain number and the result of each step is added together. The result of the filter is then sent through another filter.\n\n**Topic 2.2: Why 'FIR' Filters are Good**\n'FIR' filters are better than other filters in many ways. They work fast, which means they can deal with sounds quickly. They also work the same way all the time, which means they don't change the sound in strange ways. This makes them perfect for when we need the sound to stay the same.\n\n**Part 3: Making 'FIR' Filters**\n\n**Topic 3.1: Deciding What We Want**\nBefore making an 'FIR' filter, we need to decide what we want it to do. Some common things we might want include how it will change the sound, how much it will reduce unwanted noise, and how much it will change the sound. These things will tell us the numbers and the number of steps we need.\n\n**Topic 3.2: Window Functions**\nWindow functions help us shape the steps of an 'FIR' filter. They help us control the size of the filter's steps and to prevent strange changes. The type of window function we choose can really change how the filter works.\n\n**Part 4: Real Life Examples**\n\n**Topic 4.1: Making Music Sound Better**\n'FIR' filters are often used when we want to make music sound better, such as making the sound balanced and reducing noise. For example, a tool can make the sound louder without changing the original sound.\n\n**Topic 4.2: Picture Making**\nThis tool is also used in picture making, like finding lines and making pictures clearer. For example, this tool can make a picture clearer without changing the lines.\n\n**End:**\nIn this lesson, we learned about tools that can make sounds louder and pictures clearer. We also saw how we can use these tools in different ways.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 2654, "idx": 368102, "original text": "1. Technical Field\nThis invention relates to digital filters and particularly to finite impulse response filters.\n2. Related Art\nDigital signal processing (\u201cDSP\u201d) is used in a wide variety of devices, such as televisions, audio devices, hearing aids, computers and cellular phones. These devices employ DSP techniques to process signals in a variety of ways. For example, digital filtering techniques may be used to improve signal quality or to extract important information. In other cases, digital filters may be used to restore a signal that has been distorted in some way.\nA digital filter, such as a finite impulse response (\u201cFIR\u201d) filter, typically includes a number of equally spaced taps. Each tap is separated by a delay line and is multiplied by a filter coefficient. The output of each tap is added together and passed through a reconstruction filter. The filter coefficients allow the impulse response of the filter to be specified.\nFIR filters designed to operate at high sample rates often require numerous taps to properly specify waveforms and frequency responses for wide-band signals, such as audio signals. These filters often provide an excessive amount of time or frequency resolution. For example, consider a signal with a bandwidth from 50 Hz to 20 kHz. To avoid aliasing, a sample rate for the signal would typically be selected that is greater than 40 kHz. Wile this high sample rate may be necessary for the high frequency components of the signal, linear sampling across all frequencies results in excessive sampling for the low frequency components. Furthermore, the high sample rate would typically result in a FIR filter with high complexity due to numerous filter coefficients needed to specify the impulse response.\nMoreover, the high complexity of FIR filters often creates obstacles to implementation. For example, selection of the suitable filter coefficients to elicit a desired frequency response can be challenging. Filter designers typically employ specialized optimization software to select suitable filter coefficients. If the desired frequency response changes, the filter designer must go through the challenging process of selecting different filter coefficients, likely employing optimization software. These optimization techniques render real-time adjustments to the filter coefficients to meet changing desired frequency responses extremely difficult and costly in terms of processing resources.\nTherefore, there exists a need for a FIR filter system particularly suited for filtering non-linearly sampled input signals, with enhanced capability for real-time adjustment of the frequency response.", "hash": "3bd496cde3d703e535d18b9d66b0c20009d029c56bfed93256e1862667ef6fba"}

Regular care can stop weeds, bugs, and sickness from taking over your grass.\n- Some common ways to look after grass include cutting grass, watering, giving food, and controlling weeds.\n- How often you look after your grass will depend on the type of grass you have, the weather, and other things. Usually, you should cut your grass every week or two, water it once or twice a week when it's growing, give food to it every few months, and control weeds when needed.\n\n**Definition:**\nLooking after grass is the regular care of grass to keep it healthy, pretty, and free from weeds, bugs, and sickness.\n\n**Practical Example:**\nIf you have a special kind of grass, you should cut it so it's 2-3 inches tall, water it deeply once or twice a week when it's growing, give food to it every few months with a slow-food, and control weeds when needed with a weed-killer.\n\n**Real-World Scenario:**\nSuppose you live in GA place and have a special kind of grass. You should cut it so it's 1-2 inches tall, water it deeply once or twice a week when it's growing, give food to it every few months with a slow-food, and control weeds when needed with a weed-killer.\n\n**Section 2: Giving Food to Flower Beds**\nGiving food to flower beds means adding food to your flower beds to help growth and blooming.\n\n**Questions:**\n- Why is giving food to flower beds important?\n- What are some common foods for flower beds?\n- How often should I give food to my flower beds?\n\n**Answers:**\n- Giving food to flower beds is important because it gives the necessary food for your flowers to grow and bloom.\n- Some common foods for flower beds include compost, bone food, blood food, and man-made foods.\n- We feed flower beds often. How often depends on the kind of flowers, the soil, and other things. Usually, you should feed your flower beds every few months when they're growing.\n\n**What it means:**\nFeeding flower beds means giving them food to help them grow and bloom.\n\n**Example you can try:**\nIf you have a flower bed with roses, you should give them rose food that has a lot of one kind of food called nitrogen. Follow the directions on the food bag, usually once or twice a month when they're growing.\n\n**In real life:**\nLet's say you have a flower bed with flowers that come back every year. You should give them a common flower food that has a lot of another kind of food called phosphorus. Follow the directions on the food bag, usually once or twice a month when they're growing.\n\n**Part 3: Cutting Grass**\nCutting grass means making the grass a certain height to help it grow healthy.\n\n**Questions:**\n- Why is cutting grass important?\n- What is the best height for cutting grass?\n- How often should I cut my grass?\n\n**Answers:**\n- Cutting grass is important because it helps to keep your lawn healthy and looking nice.\n- The best height for cutting grass depends on the type of grass you have. For most grasses, the best height is 2-3 fingers high.\n- How often you should cut your grass depends on the type of grass you have, the weather, and other things. Usually, you should cut your grass every week or two when it's growing.\n\n**What it means:**\nCutting grass means making the grass a certain height to help it grow healthy.\n\n**Example you can try:**\nIf you have a lawn with a kind of grass called St. Augustine, you should cut it 2-3 fingers high.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning about the Boxelder Tree (BO tree)\n\n**What we're doing:** To teach kids about the Boxelder tree, what it looks like, and where it lives.\n\n**What we need:** Picture of a Boxelder tree, map of where it comes from, chart of soil types, video about how seeds move.\n\n**Introduction:** The Boxelder tree is a kind of tree that you can often see in NA country. It is special because it can grow in different types of dirt and it can make a lot of seeds that are carried away by the wind or animals. In this story, we will learn about what the Boxelder tree looks like, where it likes to grow, and how people try to keep it from growing too much.\n\n**Section 1: What does the Boxelder Tree look like?**\n\n- **How it looks:** The Boxelder tree can grow really tall, as tall as 70 feet! Its leaves are green and have three parts that make them look like a maple leaf. When it's fall, the leaves turn yellow before they fall off the tree.\n\n- **How it grows:** The Boxelder tree grows very fast and can live for up to 70 years. It can make a lot of seeds, which are often carried away by the wind or eaten by animals.\n\n- **What kind of dirt it likes:** The Boxelder tree can grow in lots of different types of dirt, which makes it a tree that can live in many places.\n\n**Section 2: Where does the Boxelder Tree like to grow?**\n\n- **Where it comes from:** The Boxelder tree comes from the middle and eastern parts of the US country. It likes to grow in lowlands and near streams, where it can get a lot of water.\n\n- **How it spreads:** The Boxelder tree is a type of tree that can grow really fast and take over a place, making it hard for other plants to grow. This can be a problem in places where plants and animals live together, because it can change how everything works.\n\n**Section 3: How do people keep the Boxelder Tree from growing too much?**\n\n- **Cutting it down:** Cutting down the tree doesn't really work to stop the Boxelder tree from growing because it can grow back after being cut.\n\n- **Using special stuff:** Using special stuff is a better way to keep the Boxelder tree from growing. Stuff like VP\u00ae and SL\u00ae can be used to keep the tree from growing and spreading. These special stuff work against a lot of different plants and can help keep things safe along places where there are things like power lines.\n\n**The end of the story:** In this story, we learned about the Boxelder tree, what it looks like, and where it likes to grow. We also learned about how people try to keep it from growing too much, by cutting it down or using special stuff. By knowing about the Boxelder tree and how it affects the places it grows, we can help keep it from growing too much and keep places where plants and animals live safe.\n\n**Words to remember:**\n- Adaptable: can live or do well in different places or situations\n- Dispersal: how seeds move away from the tree that made them\n- Prolific: makes a lot of seeds or babies\n- Resprout: can grow new parts again after being cut or hurt.\n\n**Talk to Yourself:** Should we call the Boxelder tree a troublesome plant, or is it just a tree that is very good at living in its home?

{"text": "Lesson: How to Make a Story\n\nBeginning:\nIn this lesson, we will learn how to make a story. A story is a way of telling people about things that are happening. Stories are usually told in a simple and easy way, using easy words and short sentences. They often have a certain way they are told, which includes a beginning, middle, and end.\n\nPart 1: Beginning\nThe beginning of a story should make the reader want to keep reading and give important information about the story. It should answer who, what, when, where, why, and how. Here's an example of a beginning:\n\n\"Ringwood-based, professional theatre company Forest Forge came to perform their play \u201cThe World Outside\u201d in the Memorial Hall on Friday. The play was specially written for their 30th anniversary and was inspired by research and interviews with people living and working in the region.\"\n\nPart 2: Middle\nThe middle of a story should give more information about the story, including things people said, facts, and numbers. It should also include any important information that helps to explain the story. Here's an example of a middle:\n\n\"The performances were wonderful, and the play itself was interesting and mysterious. Over 80 people came to the event, and pictures were taken to remember the moment. The play was about the homecoming of members of a NE family and was written to celebrate Forest Forge's 30th anniversary.\"\n\nPart 3: End\nThe end of a story should go over the main points of the story and end it. It should leave the reader with a clear understanding of what happened and why it is important. Here's an example of an end:\n\n\"In the end, the play was a big success, and the people who saw it really liked it. It showed the skills of the Forest Forge actors and showed the beauty of the NE region. It was a good way to celebrate their 30 years of professional theatre.\"\n\nWord List:\n- Story: a way of telling people about things that are happening\n- End: the last part of a story or argument, where the main points are gone over\n\nEnd:\nIn this lesson, we learned how to make a story.

They are usually given out of 10, 20, or 100 points.\n\nTopic 2: Who gives song scores?\nSong scores can be given by people who talk about music, people who love music, or the people who make music. People who talk about music are people who listen to music and say what they think about it. People who love music are people who listen to music and give it a score based on what they like. The people who make music give scores to show off their songs and music stories.\n\nTopic 3: What things can change song scores?\nThere are a few things that can change song scores, like how popular the person who makes the music is, the type of music, how well the music is made, and the words in the song.\n\nSection 2: Understanding Song Scores\n\nTopic 1: How do you understand song scores?\nTo understand song scores, you need to look at how the scores are given. For example, if the scores are out of 10, a bigger number means a better score. If the scores are out of 100, a bigger number means a worse score.\n\nTopic 2: What do song scores mean?\nSong scores can mean different things depending on who gives them. People who talk about music may use song scores to say how good the music is, while people who love music may use them to show what they like. The people who make music may use them to show off their songs and music stories.\n\nSection 3: Using Song Scores\n\nTopic 1: How do you use song scores?\nYou can use song scores by looking at the scores of different songs or music stories. This can help you see which ones are better and which ones you might like more.\n\nTopic 2: Can song scores change depending on the person?\nYes, song scores can change depending on the person because they depend on what people like and think. What one person likes, another person may not.\n\nConclusion:\nIn this lesson, we learned about song scores and how to understand them. We also learned how to use song scores to compare how good and popular different songs and music stories are. By understanding song scores, we can make good choices about what music to listen to and enjoy the music.\n\nWords to Know:\n- Song score: A number given to a song or music story to show how good or popular it is.\n- People who talk about music: People who listen to music and say what they think about it.\n- People who love music: People who listen to music and give it a score based on what they like.\n- People who make music: The people who make the songs and music stories.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 579, "idx": 405217, "original text": "The Ultimate Avril Lavigne Rating 2015 Nov 30, 2015 18:45:36 GMT via mobile BogoGog24 and TamyXD like this Quote Select PostDeselect PostLink to PostMemberGive GiftBack to Top Post by blackstarghost on Nov 30, 2015 18:45:36 GMT Kinda weird that a music video in which the focus is on an unrelated movie didn't rank lowest (gywyl), considering the main parts of the music video aren't even on Avril.

{"text": "Lesson: Big Balloon Makes Things Bigger in Tiny Tube\n\nStory:\nOnce upon a time, in the world of doctors, there was a way to make tight places wider using something called a balloon. Sometimes, they would fill the balloon with a lot of air (high-pressure) and sometimes with less air (low-pressure). People thought that more air would work better, but no one was sure.\n\nGoal:\nThis story is to help you understand why sometimes more air is not better than less air when doctors use balloons.\n\nMain Points:\n\n1. Using Balloons for Making Tight Places Wider\n2. A Test between Balloons with More Air vs Less Air\n3. What the Test Showed\n4. Talking about What We Learned\n5. Words to Learn\n\n1. Using Balloons for Making Tight Places Wider:\nWhen doctors use a balloon to make a tight place wider, how much air they put in the balloon is very important. More air (high-pressure) makes the balloon bigger, while less air (low-pressure) makes it smaller.\n\n2. A Test between Balloons with More Air vs Less Air:\nA test was done to see if more air or less air is better when using balloons. In this test, 932 people were chosen. Some of them had the balloon with more air (468 people) and some with less air (466 people).\n\n3. What the Test Showed:\nThe test was to see who stayed well for 1 year. After 30 days, 1.7% of people with the balloon with more air and 1.9% of people with the balloon with less air had problems. There was no big difference between the two. There was also no big difference when they looked at 6 months later.\n\n4. Talking about What We Learned:\nFrom the test, it seems like using more air or less air in the balloon does not make a big difference. But, the test was not perfect. For example, they did not hide which balloon people got and they only used one kind of balloon. We need to learn more to make sure these ideas are right and to find the best way to make a balloon big.\n\n5. Words to learn:\n- Making a balloon big: A step where a balloon makes a ring in the heart bigger.\n- Big balloon step: A step where a balloon with more air makes the ring bigger.\n- Small balloon step: A step where a balloon with less air makes the ring bigger.\n- Ring clot: A thing like jelly that forms in the ring.\n- Narrow vessel again: A case where the blood path gets small again after being made big by a step.\n\nIn the end:\nTo finish, the learning from this trial tells us that the big balloon step doesn't really help in getting better early or late results compared to the small balloon step. But, we need to learn more to make sure these ideas are right and to find the best way to make a balloon big.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1861, "idx": 205944, "original text": "Influence of balloon pressure during stent placement in native coronary arteries on early and late angiographic and clinical outcome: A randomized evaluation of high-pressure inflation.\nHigh-pressure dilatation is considered a better stent placement strategy, but this has not yet been proved by appropriately designed studies.

Consecutive patients with coronary stent placement were randomly assigned to high- (15 to 20 atm, 468 patients) or low- (8 to 13 atm, 466 patients) balloon-pressure dilatation.

Secondary end points were the incidence of stent thrombosis at 30 days and angiographic restenosis (>/=50% diameter stenosis) at 6 months.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Movie Tickets\n\nIntroduction:\nToday, we will learn about movie tickets. We will talk about how many tickets are sold for a movie, how much money is made, and how we can guess how many tickets will be sold in the future. We will talk about a new movie from MR company to help us understand these things.\n\nPart 1: Understanding Movie Tickets\n\nTopic 1: What are Movie Tickets?\nMovie tickets are just like they sound - they are tickets we buy to see a movie! We can learn a lot from them, like how many were sold, how much money was made, what the movie's name is, when it was shown, and where it was shown.\n\nTopic 2: Why are Movie Tickets Important?\nPeople who make and show movies care about movie tickets. They can use the information from the tickets to make decisions about making and showing more movies. They can also see what kind of movies people like to watch, which can help them decide what kind of movies to make in the future.\n\nTopic 3: Different Kinds of Information from Movie Tickets\nThere are different kinds of things we can learn from movie tickets:\n\n1. Tickets sold in our country: This is all the money made from selling tickets in our country.\n\n2. Tickets sold in other countries: This is all the money made from selling tickets in other countries.\n\n3. Tickets sold in the whole world: This is all the money made from selling tickets everywhere in the world.\n\n4. Average money made per movie screen: This is the average amount of money made per screen in a theater.\n\n5. Money made in the first weekend: This is all the money made from selling tickets in the first weekend a movie is shown.\n\nPart 2: Looking at Movie Tickets\n\nTopic 1: Important Things to Look at\nThere are several important things to look at when we study movie tickets:\n\n1. Total money made: This is all the money made before we subtract the cost of making and advertising the movie.\n\n2. Money left after costs: This is all the money made after we subtract the cost of making and advertising the movie.\n\n3. Number of people who watched the movie: This is how many people went to see the movie while it was in theaters.\n\n4. Number of seats filled: This is how many seats were filled in a theater during a movie.\n\nTopic 2: Guessing the Future\nPeople who study movie tickets use different ways to guess how many tickets will be sold in the future. Here are some ways they do that:\n\n1. Comparing to past movies: This means looking at how similar movies did in the past to guess how a new movie will do.\n\n2. Using math: This means using math to guess how much money a movie will make based on things like what kind of movie it is, who is in it, and how much money was spent to advertise it.\n\n3. Looking at social media: This means looking at what people are saying on social media to guess how many people will want to see the movie.\n\nPart 3: Using What We Learned About Movie Tickets\n\nTopic 1: Talking About a New Story\nLet's talk about a new story using the fun things we learned before.\n\nComparing Stories:\nWe can compare the new story to old stories to see if there are any patterns or things that happen again and again. For example, we can look at how many people went to see the last five stories:\n\n1. 95 people\n2. 86 people\n3. 100 people\n4. 147 people\n5. 95 people\n\nAs we can see, the new story had the fifth-most people come see it among the last five stories. This suggests that there may be some change in what people like, but overall, people still like these stories.\n\nGuessing What Will Happen:\nWe can guess what might happen next based on different things like the kind of story, who's in it, and how much people talk about it. For example, we can think about these things:\n\n1. Kind of story: People usually like these kinds of stories, so we can guess that they will like this one too.\n\n2. Who's in it: The story has a lot of interesting characters, which can make more people want to see it.\n\n3. How much people talk about it: Lots of people talked about the story, which can make more people want to see it.\n\nUsing these things, we can guess what might happen next.\n\nLooking at What People Say:\nWe can also look at what people say about the story to understand what they like and don't like. For example, we can look at these things:\n\n1. How much people talk about it: The story got a lot of people talking, which can be a sign that they like it.\n\n2. What people think: Overall, people liked the story, which can help make more people want to see it.\n\nEnding:\nIn this fun talk, we learned about looking at stories and guessing what might happen next. We used the new story as an example to show important ideas and fun ways to look at stories. By understanding important things, looking at patterns and guessing what might happen, we can learn more about what people like and don't like, which can help us make better stories in the future.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 2925, "idx": 268840, "original text": "Related Charts\n\nMarvel'sruled the box office this weekend with a fantastic $94.3 million.

{"text": "Lesson: Working Together to Stay Safe from Ziki Bugs for Trip Takers\n\n### Introduction\n\nIn this lesson, we will learn about the Ziki bug and why it's important to work together when we want to stay safe from it. We'll also talk about the dangers of going on a trip to the LA country and how to stay safe.\n\n### Main Topic\n\n1. What is the Ziki bug?\n\nThe Ziki bug is a bad bug that comes from Ziki mosquitoes. These mosquitoes bite people and make them sick. The Ziki bug was first found in UG country a long time ago and has traveled to other places, including AM country, where it made many people sick. The bug mainly comes from mosquito bites, but it can also come from a mom to her baby when she is pregnant.\n\n2. Why is working together important when we want to stay safe from the Ziki bug?\n\nWorking together is when people and doctors make health choices. This is very important when we want to stay safe from the Ziki bug because it helps people make smart choices based on what they know and like. For example, some people may choose not to go to places where the Ziki bug is found, while others may choose to be safe by using bug spray or wearing clothes that cover their body.\n\n3. What are the dangers of going on a trip to the LA country?\n\nGoing on a trip to the LA country, especially to places where the Ziki bug is found, can make people sick. Moms who are going to have babies and those who want to have babies are more likely to get very sick if they get the Ziki bug. Also, the Ziki bug can make people very sick with a scary sickness, which can make them unable to move and even die.\n\n4. How can I stay safe from the Ziki bug when going on a trip to the LA country?\n\nThere are several ways to stay safe from the Ziki bug when going on a trip to the LA country:\n\n- Use bug spray: Put bug spray on your skin that's not covered by clothes, and wear long sleeves and pants to stay safe from mosquito bites.\n- Stay in rooms with air: Mosquitoes don't like to bite people inside, so try to stay in rooms with air or use screens on windows and doors to keep mosquitoes away.\n- Sleep under a bug net: If you are sleeping in a room without air, use a bug net around your bed to stay safe from mosquito bites.\n- Don't be near still water: Mosquitoes like to have their babies in still water, so don't be near places with still water and don't leave containers of water outside.\n- Use safe ways or don't do grown-up things: If you are going on a trip to a place where the Ziki bug is found, use safe ways or don't do grown-up things to stay safe from the bug.\n\n5. Ending Thoughts\n\nTo end, the Zika bug is a bug that can make people very sick. It can make babies born to sick moms have problems too. Making choices together is a good way to stop Zika because it lets people choose what is best for them. By doing what we learned in this lesson, you can keep safe from the Zika bug when you visit LA country.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1798, "idx": 185688, "original text": "Shared Decision-Making Approach to Zika Best for Travelers\n\nTUESDAY, July 17, 2018 (HealthDay News) \u2014 An approach to shared decision-making that stratifies risk might be most appropriate for preventing Zika infection, according to an Ideas and Opinion piece published online July 17 in the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nNoting that public attention has waned with the decline in reported Zika cases, Daniel S. Graciaa, M.D., M.P.H., from the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, and colleagues address the recent rebound in travel to Latin America, including by pregnant women and those planning to conceive.\n\nThe authors suspect that many travelers are unaware of or choose not to adhere to public health recommendations relating to taking precautions against conception after travel or symptomatic infection. However, up to 80 percent of Zika virus infections may be asymptomatic, and these can result in complications, including sexual transmission and adverse fetal outcomes.

{"text": "Title: Fun Game Times\n\nLesson: Learning About Old Games Becoming New\n\n## Section 1: Simple Ideas\n\nMaking an old game new again is like fixing an old toy so it can work with new toys. This means making the game look better, sound better, and play better. This is done so kids can enjoy old games without needing old toys.\n\n## Section 2: Questions and Answers\n\n**Question:** What does it mean to make an old game new again?\n**Answer:** Making an old game new again means fixing it so it can work with new toys. This makes the game look better, sound better, and play better.\n\n**Question:** Why do people who make games make their old games new again?\n**Answer:** People make their old games new again so kids can enjoy them without needing old toys. It also lets more kids play the game and helps the people who make the games by selling the new version of the game.\n\n**Question:** What is the difference between making an old game new again and making a new game from an old game?\n**Answer:** Making a new game from an old game is like building a new toy from scratch, while making an old game new again is like fixing the old toy to make it better. Making a new game from an old game needs more things and time than making an old game new again.\n\n## Section 3: Examples and Real Situations\n\nOne time an old game was made new again is the \"Famous Adventure\" game remake. The first game came out a long time ago, and kids have wanted a new one for a long time. In a recent year, the people who made the game said they were making a new one with new tools. The new game has better looks, a new way to play, and new words.\n\nAnother time is the \"Scary House\" game collection that was made new again. This collection has new versions of \"Scary House\" 0, 1, and 4. These games have been made to look better, have better pictures, and play smoother.\n\n## Section 4: Talking to Yourself\n\n**Talk Topic 1:** Is making old games new again a good way to keep old games for kids in the future?\n**Talk 1:** Yes, making old games new again lets kids enjoy old games without needing old toys. It also makes sure these games won't be forgotten when new games come out.\n**Talk 2:** No, making old games new again changes how the game was first played. Some kids like to play old games the way they were first made, without any changes or fixes.\n\n**Talk Topic 2:** Should people who make games focus more on making new games from old games rather than making old games new again?\n**Talk 1:** Yes, making new games from old games lets the people who make games create all new things for kids. This can lead to more new and fun game designs.\n**Talk 2:** No, making old games new again is a cheaper way to fix old games. Making new games needs more stuff and time than fixing old ones, which may not be possible for everyone.\n\n## Words to learn\n- Fixing old games: The steps to update an old game to make it work with new game systems.\n- Pictures: The things you can see in a game, like the people, places, and things in the game.\n- Sounds: The things you can hear in a game, like the music, noises, and voices.\n- How it runs: How fast and smooth a game is, including how quickly it moves and loads.\n\n## Wrapping up\nIn this story, we learned about fixing old games, a method used by game makers to update old games to make them work with new game systems. We talked about the good things about fixing old games, like better pictures, sounds, and how it runs. We also looked at real examples of fixed old games and talked about the good and bad things about fixing old games versus making new ones. Lastly, we learned new words related to fixing old games.

{"text": "Title: Learning About Reviews on TR Site\n\nIntroduction:\nTR Site is a loved website for people going on trips to look for details about places to sleep, places to eat, and fun places to go. One of the main parts of TR Site is the chance to read reviews written by other people on trips. In this story, we will learn about the different kinds of reviews on TR Site and learn how to understand them.\n\nSection 1: Kinds of Reviews on TR Site\n\nTopic 1: Happy Reviews\nA happy review is a review that says good things about a place to sleep or eat. Happy reviews often talk about specific parts of the trip that were fun, like how clean the room was, how good the food was, or how nice the people were. Happy reviews can help people on trips feel more sure in their choice of where to sleep or eat.\n\nTopic 2: Sad Reviews\nA sad review is a review that says bad things about a place to sleep or eat. Sad reviews often talk about specific parts of the trip that were not fun, like how dirty the room was, how bad the food was, or how mean the people were. Sad reviews can help people on trips avoid a bad time and make a smart choice about where to sleep or eat.\n\nTopic 3: Helpful Reviews\nA helpful review gives useful information without saying a strong yes or no.

Helpful reviews can help people on trips make a smarter choice about where to sleep or eat.\n\nSection 2: Understanding Reviews on TR Site\n\nTopic 1: Reading More Than the Words\nWhen reading reviews on TR Site, it's important to read more than the words and think about the whole review. For example, a one-star review that talks about a dirty room may not be as bad as a five-star review that talks about a dirty room. Just like a five-star comment saying a room is small may not be as liked as a one-star comment saying a room is big.\n\nTopic 2: Checking if Things are Real\nWhen checking if a comment is real, it's important to think about the person's comment history. If a person has only written one comment, it may not be as good as a person who has written many comments and always gives useful and correct information.\n\nTopic 3: Understanding the Middle Number\nThe middle number of a hotel or food place on a website is found out by looking at all of the comments written about that place. To find out the middle number, the website gives a number to each comment (like 1-5 stars) and then finds the middle of all of those numbers. The middle number can tell you quickly about the overall good of the place.\n\nSection 3: Using What You Learned from This Lesson\n\nNow that you have learned about the different types of comments on a website and how to understand them, you can use this to make good choices about where to stay or eat when going places. By carefully reading and checking comments, you can stay away from bad experiences and find places that you like and want.\n\nEnding:\nIn this lesson, we looked at the different types of comments on a website and learned how to understand them. By understanding the comment and checking if it's real, we can make good choices about where to stay or eat when going places. By using what we learned from this lesson, we can stay away from bad experiences and find places that we like and want.\n\nWords to Know:\n- Comment: A written thought of a hotel, food place, or fun place, usually put on a website.\n- Happy Comment: A comment that says good things about a hotel or food place.\n- Not Happy Comment: A comment that says not good things about a hotel or food place.\n- Helpful Comment: A comment that gives useful information without being too happy or not happy.\n- Real: Something that can be trusted and is correct.\n- Middle Number: The number given to a comment by a website, which tells about the overall good of a place based on all of the comments written about it.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 651, "idx": 456304, "original text": "My wife and I enjoyed just a one night stay at this comfortable B & B.

In the same week, neighbouring Hempnall, Ditchingham and Wortwell saw 37 new cases, up from 12 the week before \u2013 an increase of 208.3 per cent.. Cases have surged nationwide over the festive period, which is largely down to a new, more easily transmissible strain of the virus.. Figures in the Harleston area sit in stark contrast with the entire county, where the increase in new cases was 52.6 per cent.. The only area in the county which saw a higher increase was Felmingham, Worstead, and Happisburgh, in north Norfolk, where cases jumped by 487.5 per cent on the week prior.", "hash": "05565904fdf94fad1194779acafe8c0555bfffe681cc4b11091812551709f15d"}

{"text": "Story: Learning about Feeling Too Hot\n\nFeeling too hot, also known as having a high temperature, is something that happens to lots of people everywhere. It can be a warning sign for being sick, needing rest, and other long-lasting conditions. In this story, we will learn about the basics of feeling too hot, like why it happens, what it feels like, and how to feel better.\n\n## Part 1: Learning about Feeling Too Hot\n\n**What is Feeling Too Hot?**What is Feeling Too Hot?**\n\nFeeling too hot is when your body is warmer than it should be. It is sometimes called the \"quiet troublemaker\" because it usually does not make you feel different. However, if not taken care of, it can lead to bigger health problems.\n\n**Why Do People Feel Too Hot**\n\nWe don't exactly know why people feel too hot, but there are a few things that can make it happen. These include being born with it, choosing to eat certain foods and play certain ways (like running a lot), and having other body troubles (like a cold or a tummy ache).\n\n**How Does Feeling Too Hot Feel**\n\nMost people who feel too hot do not feel different at all. However, if your body is very hot, you may get a headache, feel dizzy, or have trouble breathing.\n\n**How to Feel Better When You're Too Hot**\n\nThere are a few ways to feel better when you're too hot. These include eating better food and playing in a healthier way, taking medicine, and learning to feel calm. Your doctor will help you find the best way to feel better based on what you need and your body's past.\n\n## Part 2: Understanding Body Warmth\n\n**What is Body Warmth?**What is Body Warmth?**\n\nBody warmth is the heat of your body being sent out to your skin. It is measured in tiny units of heat and is usually two numbers: the first number and the second number.\n\n**How is Body Warmth Measured?**How is Body Warmth Measured?**\n\nBody warmth is measured using a tool called a thermometer. The tool is put on your arm and squeezed until it is snug against your skin. The helper listens to the sound of the blood moving in your body. The first sound they hear is called the big sound, and the sound when it goes away is called the small sound.\n\n**Normal Body Sound Range**\n\nNormal body sound is when the big sound is less than 120 and the small sound is less than 80. If your body sound is always more than these, you may need to be careful.\n\n## Part 3: Stopping and Taking Care of Body Sound\n\n**Changes in Life to Stop and Take Care of Body Sound**\n\nThere are some changes you can make in your life to help stop and take care of body sound. These include:\n\n- Eating good food like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and good proteins\n- Doing exercise often\n- Not drinking too much\n- Not smoking\n- Taking care of stress by relaxing or talking\n\n**Medicine for Body Sound**\n\nIf changes in life are not enough to take care of your body sound, the helper may give medicine to help lower your body sound. There are different kinds of medicine, and the helper will work with you to find the best one for you.\n\n## The End\n\nIn the end, body sound is a common thing that can cause bad health if not taken care of. By knowing about body sound and making changes in life, you can help stop and take care of this. Remember to always talk with the helper before starting any new treatment or medicine.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1820, "idx": 478799, "original text": "The frequency of combined target organ damage and the beneficial effect of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in never treated mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients.\nThe aim of this study was to determine the frequency of target organ damage (TOD) and the beneficial properties of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) for detecting patients who are at high risk for TOD and cardiovascular disease in never treated mild-to-moderate hypertension. Sixty-seven patients (28 males and 39 females, mean age, 49.6 +/- 9.5 years) were divided into two groups, dippers (group I, n = 43) and nondippers (group II, n = 24), according to nocturnal blood pressure (BP) reduction of less than 10%. The groups were compared with respect to demographic and laboratory data and the signs of TOD (microalbuminuria, left ventricular hypertrophy, and retinopathy). We also tested the relationship between ABPM and clinic BP findings with TOD. Group I had significantly lower values than group II for serum fibrinogen (0.28 +/- 0.06 versus 0.32 +/- 0.06 g/L, P = 0.02), uric acid (0.18 +/- 0.05 versus 0.25 +/- 0.11 mmo/L, P = 0.01), urinary sodium excretion (133.7 +/- 45.2 versus 161.8 +/- 52.2 mmol/L, P = 0.02), urinary albumin excretion (17.5 +/- 14.2 versus 31.3 +/- 19.7 mg/24-h, P = 0.001), left ventricular mass index (111.8 +/- 31.0 versus 128.7 +/- 36.6 g/m(2), P = 0.05), and the prevalence of hypertensive retinopathy (51% versus 83%, P = 0.01). The frequency of the combination of all three signs of TOD (microalbuminuria, left ventricular hypertrophy, and hypertensive retinopathy) was higher in nondippers than in dippers (71.4% versus 30%, P = 0.04).

{"text": "Lesson 1: Saying Hello to Making Things and Slippery Liquids\n\n### Section 1: Fun Ideas\n\nIn this lesson, we will learn about how to make things and slippery liquids. Making things is like creating something new from two or more simple things. It is a fun part of science and has many different ways and methods. There are some special liquids that melt easily and we use them to make things. We call them easy-melt liquids. They are like salt and made of two kinds of tiny things.\n\n### Part 2: Let's Try It Out\n\nWe are going to make a thing that helps plants not get sick. It's called a plant-helper. We can use two ways to make it with our special liquids. One way is to mix things together and make them change. The other way is to put things together and then take some parts away.\n\nTo do these things, we need special helpers called shiny helpers. These helpers are used in the special liquid to help us make things better. This means we can use the helpers and special liquids many times. This makes it easier and helps the earth.\n\n### Part 3: Let's Talk About It\n\nWhy do we use special liquids to make things?\n\nA) They cost less.\nB) They have special things that make them good for making stuff.\nC) They are easier to use.\n\nAnswer: B. Special liquids have things that make them good for making stuff. For example, they don't turn into gas easily, they can take heat, and we can change how they work. These things make them good for making lots of different things.\n\n### Words to Remember\n- Making things: The way we make a new thing from two or more simpler ones.\n- Easy-melt liquids: These are like salts that melt easily and are made of two kinds of tiny things.\n- Shiny helpers: These are helpers that are in the same kind as the things we are working with.\n- Different helpers: These are helpers that are different from the things we are working with.\n- Using again: The way we use things many times to help the earth and save things.\n- Making better: The way we make things work better or easier.\n\n### The End\n\nIn this story, we learned about making things and special liquids. We talked about how we do it, tried it out, and talked about it. We also learned new words.

We will look at how our friend, David, shares his toys with his friends at school.\n\nSection 1: Understanding Sharing and Trading\n\nTopic 1: What is Sharing and Trading?\nSharing and trading mean giving your toys to your friends to play with or swapping toys with them. This can happen in different ways, like giving a toy to a friend for a day, letting a friend borrow a toy, or swapping a toy with a friend.\n\nTopic 2: Why do Kids Share and Trade?\nKids might choose to share and trade toys for many reasons. These can include having more fun playing, getting to play with different toys, and making new friends. Sharing and trading can also help us learn how to take turns and be fair.\n\nSection 2: How Sharing and Trading Toys Can Change Playtime\n\nTopic 1: The Example of David's Toy Trade\nIn 2016, our friend David traded his favorite toy car with his friend, Ethan, at school. This trade changed the way they played because now they both had a new toy to play with.\n\nTopic 2: The Role of Sharing and Trading in Making Friends\nSharing and trading toys can help us make friends. For example, when David traded his toy car with Ethan, they became better friends.

On one hand, sharing and trading can make playtime more fun and help us make friends. On the other hand, sharing and trading can sometimes lead to arguments if we don't agree on how to share or trade.\n\nTopic 2: How Can We Make Sure That Sharing and Trading is Fair?\nWhen we think about sharing and trading toys, we need to think about what is fair. We need to make sure that everyone agrees on the trade and that no one is left out. We should also think about how we can take turns and share nicely.\n\nGlossary:\n- Sharing: Giving your toys to your friends to play with.\n- Trading: Swapping toys with your friends.\n- Agree: When everyone thinks the same thing.\n- Fair: When everyone is treated the same way.\n\nConclusion:\nIn the end, sharing and trading toys like David and Ethan did can change the way we play and make friends.

{"text": "Lesson: The Good Things about Sharing Cultures\n\nIntroduction:\nSharing cultures is a great way for people to learn about different ways of life, customs, and traditions. These activities let people expand their knowledge, make new friends, and understand the world around them better. In this lesson, we will explore the good things about sharing cultures and how they can help people and the world.\n\nSection 1: Understanding Sharing Cultures\n\nTopic 1: What is sharing cultures?\nSharing cultures are fun events where people from different places or ways of life come together to share their experiences, traditions, and customs. These activities can happen in person or online and can last for a few days or many months.\n\nTopic 2: Why is sharing cultures important?\nSharing cultures is important because they help bring people from different ways of life closer. By taking part in these activities, people can learn about other ways of life and appreciate their own better. Also, sharing cultures can help people develop important skills like talking, solving problems, and adjusting.\n\nSection 2: Good Things about Sharing Cultures\n\nTopic 1: Making Friends from Different Places\nOne of the best parts of sharing with friends from different places is learning how to talk and play nicely with them. This is very important because, in our world, people need to work and play together, no matter where they come from.\n\nTopic 2: Growing and Learning\nAnother good thing about sharing with friends from different places is that it helps us grow and learn. When we try new things and learn about new places, we understand more about ourselves and feel more brave. We also learn about what we think is right and wrong, and we can think about how this is the same or different from what other people think.\n\nSection 3: Real Examples\n\nTopic 1: Going to School in Another Place\nOne way we can share with friends from different places is by going to school in a different place. When kids go to school in a different place, they learn about new ways of doing things, new words, and new ways to have fun. This can change the way they think and help them understand other people better.\n\nTopic 2: Working Together in Different Places\nAnother way we can share with friends from different places is by working together. When people work together, they need to talk nicely and understand each other. Sharing with friends from different places can help people learn how to do this.\n\nWords to Remember:\n- Sharing with Friends from Different Places: When we get together with friends from different places to talk about our lives and have fun.\n- Talking and Playing Nicely: When we talk and play in a way that is nice and respectful to everyone.\n- Growing and Learning: When we learn new things and become better people.\n\nIn the end, sharing with friends from different places is a great way to learn about different ways of life and learn important skills like talking nicely and solving problems. By spending time with friends from different places, we can learn more, make new friends, and appreciate our own way of life more.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 1022, "idx": 100135, "original text": "The Yucel Cultural Foundation using 21st century thinking seeks to promote and improve individuals, the country and all humanity, by bringing together youth from all over the world for social and cultural activities, and international and domestic student exchange programs..

{"text": "Title: Learning About Doorways\n\nGetting Started:\nIn this lesson, we will learn about doorways and why they're important in computer talking. We will learn the basics of doorways, including what they are, how they work, and why they're necessary. By the end of this lesson, you will know a lot about doorways and how they help computers talk to each other.\n\nSection 1: What are Doorways?\nDoorways are magic connections that let computer programs talk to each other. They work like a door for data to go through between devices and programs. Think of a doorway like a mailbox where incoming and outgoing mail is sorted and delivered. Just like how mail needs to have the right address before being delivered, data sent through a doorway must be put together and addressed right to reach where it's supposed to go.\n\nSection 2: How do Doorways Work?\nWhen a computer program sends data through a doorway, it is broken up into little pieces. These little pieces are then sent across the network to where they're supposed to go. When the little pieces get to where they're going, they are put back together into the original data. We repeat a step for each toy block until all toy blocks are used.\n\nPart 3: Why do we need Doors?\nDoors are important because they let many toys play at the same time in the same room without bothering each other. Imagine if all toys had to use only one door. It would be messy, with toys always getting in the way of each other. Doors solve this problem by giving a separate door for each toy, making sure they can play without getting in the way.\n\nPart 4: Real Life Examples\nImagine you are playing a game with friends. Your game uses a specific door to go in and out. At the same time, you are also using your book to look at pictures. Your book also uses a door to show you new pictures. Without doors, both the game and the book would be fighting over the same door, causing trouble or even stopping either the game or the book from working right.\n\nAnother example is when you connect to a playground. Your toy needs to talk to the playground using a door. If the door is already being used by another toy, you won't be able to connect to the playground.\n\nPart 5: The End\nTo sum up, doors are important in the toy world because they let many toys play with each other at the same time. Without doors, our toys would not be able to play right in today's world full of toys. By understanding the basics of doors, we can better appreciate their importance and how they play a big part in toy play.\n\nWords to Learn:\n- Door: A way that lets toys play with each other in the room.\n- Toy Blocks: Smaller pieces of toys that are played with in the room.\n- Name Tag: A special name that is used to send a toy to its play place.\n\nLet's Talk:\n- Why are doors important in the toy world?\n- How do doors make sure that toys can play without getting in the way?\n- Can you think of any real-life examples where doors are important in toy play?\n\nHomework:\n- Find more examples of how doors are used in the toy world.\n- Draw a picture that shows the process of a toy going through a door.\n- Write a few sentences explaining why doors are important in toy play.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 546, "idx": 283313, "original text": "at the PORT awaiting trial,.

{"text": "**Lesson:** How to Look at Stories Using Ideas\n\n**Introduction:** \nIn this lesson, we will learn how to look at stories using ideas. An idea is a message or meaning that is told within a story. By looking at the ideas in a story, we can understand more about the writer's thoughts and the overall meaning of the story.\n\n**Section 1: Understanding Ideas**\n\n**Topic 1:** What is an idea?\nAn idea is a main thought or message within a story. It is the hidden meaning of the story that connects everything together. Ideas can be big or small, but they always connect to the main message of the story.\n\n**Topic 2:** How do we find ideas in stories?\nTo find ideas in stories, we must first read and understand the story. We can look for symbols, things, or ideas that we see again and again in the story. We can also look at what the characters do and why they do it to understand what they show. Once we know these parts, we can start to put together the ideas.\n\n**Topic 3:** Why are ideas important?\nIdeas are important because they help us understand the deeper meaning of a story. They let us see more than just what is happening and dive into the writer's thoughts. By looking at ideas, we can understand more about the art of stories and the messages they tell.\n\n**Section 2: Looking at Ideas**\n\n**Topic 1:** How do we look at ideas?\nTo look at ideas, we must first know the main ideas in the story. We can do this by looking for symbols, things, or ideas that we see again and again in the story. We can also look at what the characters do and why they do it to understand what they show. Once we know these parts, we can start to put together the ideas.\n\n**Topic 2:** How do we show our thinking with examples?\nTo show our thinking with examples, we must use parts from the story to show our thoughts. We can use words, pictures, and other things from the story to show how the ideas are there. We can also use other stories to give more help and support for our thinking.\n\n**Topic 3:** How do we put our thinking in order?\nTo put our thinking in order, we can make a list that shows the main ideas and the examples that support them. We can also use a picture to show the connections between the ideas and the examples.\n\n**Section 3: Using Ideas in Stories**\n\n**Topic 1:** How do ideas help us understand stories?\nIdeas help us understand stories by giving us a way to understand the story. They let us see more than just what is happening and dive into the writer's thoughts. By looking at ideas, we can understand more about the art of stories and the messages they tell.\n\n**Topic 2:** How do ideas connect to the characters and things that happen in a story?\nStories have things called themes. These themes are shown through the things that happen in the story and the people in it. For example, if the theme is \"love is powerful,\" we can look at how the people in the story show love and how it changes the story's ending.\n\n**What we learned:**\nWhen we look at themes in stories, we can understand what the person who wrote the story wanted to say. We can see how the themes are shown in the story through the people and things that happen. By doing this, we can get better at reading and thinking. We can use what we know to understand new stories.\n\n**Words to know:**\n- Theme: A message in a story.\n- Symbol: A thing, person, or event that means something deeper.\n- Motif: A thing that keeps coming up in a story.\n- Character: A pretend person or thing that makes the story happen.\n- Plot: The things that happen in a story.\n- Evidence: Things that show something is true.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 872, "idx": 370553, "original text": "Just print it and go!.

{"text": "Lesson: How to Make a Plan for a Jacket Design\n\nFirst Part:\nA plan for a jacket design is a paper that tells what we want to do, how we want to do it, and what we need for a jacket design project. It helps the people who make the jacket know what to do. It also makes sure everyone knows what is happening. In this lesson, we will learn how to make a plan for a man's jacket using a picture.\n\nStep 1: Know what the project is about\nThe first step in making a plan is to know what the project is about. This means knowing why we are doing the project, who will wear the jacket, and what the jacket will look like. For our jacket, the project is about making a long-sleeve, waist-length jacket with a big yellow collar that folds back, yellow designs on the sleeves, and pockets on the front and sides.\n\nStep 2: Know what we need\nNext, we need to know what we need for the project. These are the things that we must have to reach our project goals. For our jacket, we need to use the same cloth and colors as the picture, make the sleeves fold back with the same yellow design, add pockets on the front and sides with the same yellow line, and make sure the jacket is waist-length.\n\nStep 3: Make a time plan\nAfter we know what the project is about and what we need, we need to make a time plan for the project. This means knowing when we will do each part of the design process, like looking for ideas, drawing, and finishing the design. For our jacket, we might need a few days to look for ideas, a few more days to draw, and a week to finish the design.\n\nStep 4: Know how much money we can spend\nLast, we need to think about how many toys we can buy for our project. This helps us not use too many toys and makes sure we don't waste on things we don't need. For our coat, we have 20 play money, which is enough to get the toys and work.\n\nThe end:\nTo end, making a plan is a very important part of any project. By doing these things, we can make sure that we know what the project is about, what we need, when we need it, and how many toys we can use. With a good plan, we can go ahead with sureness, knowing that we have a good start to do well.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 1010, "idx": 212263, "original text": "Illustrate Something.

{"text": "Lesson Title: Learning About Some Groups and Their Messages\n\nIntroduction:\nIn this lesson, we will learn about some groups and their messages. We will look at the message of a group called \"S Group\" and see how it talks to some people.\n\nSection 1: Learning About Some Groups\n\nTopic 1: What are some groups?\nSome groups are organizations that share certain ideas. They sometimes do not like certain people or things. These groups use words to share their message and get more people to join them.\n\nTopic 2: Examples of some groups\nSome examples of these groups include the \"K Group\", the \"N Group\", and the \"B Group\". These groups have sometimes done bad things and said unkind words.\n\nSection 2: Looking at \"S Group's\" Message\n\nTopic 1: \"S Group's\" message to some people\n\"S Group\" has asked for many people to come to its meeting at \"HA place\", and for each person to bring a flag. This message is based on not liking some people. \"S Group's\" message is that some people should support them because they don't like certain things.\n\nTopic 2: \"S Group's\" use of pictures\nOn its website, \"S Group\" has a picture of a red star, a head with a hat, and red drops from a building. This picture is meant to be surprising and not nice, and it is made to make people feel scared and not like certain people.\n\nSection 3: Thinking Questions\n\n1. Why do you think \"S Group\" is talking to certain people?\n2. How does \"S Group's\" message relate to other groups?\n3. What can we do to stop the spread of unkind words and messages?\n\nWord List:\n- Not liking certain people: not liking some people or things\n- Certain ideas: ideas that like certain people or things\n- Words: words, especially those that are not true or fair, used to share an idea or view\n\nConclusion:\nIn this lesson, we have learned about some groups and their use of words to share their message. We have looked at \"S Group's\" message to some people and its use of surprising pictures. We have also asked thinking questions to understand this topic better. By learning about these groups and what they do, we can understand how to stop the spread of unkind words and messages.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 2043, "idx": 28370, "original text": "Entries in SIOE\n(1)\n\nBritish Jewish advocacy group CST appeals to Jews not to take part in an upcoming demonstration by far right Eurofascists: Don\u2019t be fooled by Islamophobia. A small Islamophobic group, called Stop Islamisation Of Europe (SIOE), has called for 1,000 Jews to attend its forthcoming demonstration at Harrow mosque; and for each Jew to bring an Israeli flag. This is strikingly similar to appeals that have also been made in recent months by the English Defence League (EDL). It is also essentially the same as opportunistic attempts by British National Party leader Nick Griffin to ditch both his and his party\u2019s antisemitic heritage, by stressing his supposed new-found support for Israel and Jews. SIOE\u2019s appeal for Jewish participation sits alongside this grotesque Islamophobic image on its website:\n\nIf a Jew cannot understand why the image is racist, or hateful, or bigoted then they should try imagining it as a synagogue: with blood dripping from a Star of David; with blood dripping down the rabbi\u2019s pulpit; and with blood dripping from the mouth of a skull that wears an Israeli army helmet. \u2026\n\nCST has raised awareness of the activities of extreme Islamist groups in the UK for many years. But to demonise an entire community, every Muslim and every mosque, in the way that SIOE does, shows exactly the kind of bigotry from which Jews have suffered so often in our history. For SIOE to appeal to Jews to support them shows a complete ignorance of the Jewish experience of being on the receiving end of exactly this type of politics. \u2026\n\nHatred, division, cycles of inter-communal violence, intimidation and polarisation feed the extremists on every side. They encourage social division and leave all minorities vulnerable. Anti-Muslim bigotry is a vital recruiting sergeant for both the far right, and its Islamist extremist counterparts. It generates votes for the BNP and, at the furthest ends of this political spectrum, it even provides the fuel for terrorism.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About The Brain and How It Helps Us Understand Words\n\nIntroduction:\nIn this lesson, we will learn about the brain and how it helps us understand words. We will look at two types of word groups in a language: moving and controlling. This is a story about how our minds understand big sentences.\n\nChapter 1: What are Brain Sparks?\nBrain sparks are like tiny lights that turn on in our heads when we think. We can see these lights by putting special stickers on our heads. They help us understand how our minds work and how we think.\n\nChapter 2: Question Sentences\nQuestion sentences are used in talking to show that a sentence has a small sentence inside it. This small sentence is called the \"question\" sentence. In some languages, question sentences are often used to ask questions or say something about the subject of a sentence.\n\nExample:\n- Jack is tall.\n- How tall is Jack?\n\nIn this example, the subject of the sentence is \"Jack,\" and we want to know more about him. So, we use a question sentence to ask about him.\n\nChapter 3: Action Sentences\nAction sentences are like question sentences, but they do not have a small sentence inside. Instead, they have a doing word that controls the subject of the sentence.\n\nExample:\n- Jack saw the movie.\n- Jack was seen by Madison.\n\nIn this example, the subject of the sentence is \"Jack,\" but the doing word \"saw\" controls the sentence.\n\nChapter 4: Brain Sparks and Understanding Sentences\nWhen we think about big sentences like question and action sentences, our minds make different brain sparks. These sparks help us understand how our minds think.\n\nExample:\n- In a question sentence, the mind makes a big spark. This spark is stronger than the spark made in an action sentence.\n- In an action sentence, the mind makes a small spark. This spark is weaker than the spark made in a question sentence.\n\nChapter 5: The End\nUnderstanding brain sparks and their role in understanding sentences is an important thing to learn. By looking at the differences in brain sparks made by question and action sentences, we can understand better how our minds understand big sentences. This knowledge can be used in other parts of understanding sentences and can help us find new ways to teach how to talk.\n\nWord List:\n- Brain sparks: Tiny lights made by the mind when thinking.\n- Question sentence: A sentence used in talking to show that it has a small sentence inside.\n- Action sentence: A sentence used in talking to show that it has a doing word that controls the subject of the sentence.\n- Big spark: A brain spark made in a question sentence.\n- Small spark: A brain spark made in an action sentence.\n\nLet's Talk About It:\nWhy are brain sparks important in understanding sentences?

{"text": "Lesson: How to Look at Little Life Pieces\n\nIntroduction:\nLooking at little life pieces is about seeing the tiny building blocks that make up different places, like a pond or a pile of leaves. It's a way to learn about all the tiny creatures that live there, even if we can't see them. We can find out what they do, how they work together, and how they change. In this lesson, we will learn how to look at little life pieces with a pretend little life piece set.\n\nSection 1: Getting Ready to Look at Little Life Pieces\n\nGetting ready is an important part of looking at little life pieces. It means we need to make sure we're only looking at the good little life pieces, take out anything that doesn't belong, and match the little life pieces to a picture book of little life pieces. Here's how we get ready with our pretend little life piece set:\n\n1. Good little life pieces: We take out any little life pieces that don't look good (for example, if they're blurry).\n2. Taking out things that don't belong: We look for and take out anything that isn't a little life piece, like if some pieces from a human picture book got mixed in.\n3. Matching: We match the good little life pieces to a picture in our picture book of little life pieces using a fun matching game like \"Find the Match\".\n\nExample: Pretend we've taken out the blurry little life pieces and any pieces that came from a human picture book. Now, we're going to match the good little life pieces to a picture in our picture book using \"Find the Match\".\n\nSection 2: Counting Little Life Pieces\n\nAfter getting ready, we can count how many of each type of little life piece we have in our pretend little life piece set. We will use these things:\n\n1. Counting game: We put the matched little life pieces in order to make counting easier.\n2. Number game: We count how many of each little life piece we have using the counting game.\n3. Drawing: We make a picture to show how many of each little life piece we have.\n\nExample: Pretend we've put the matched little life pieces in order and counted how many of each little life piece we have. Now, we're going to make a picture to show how many of each little life piece we have.\nStory: Counting Different Animals\n\nWe are counting different animals. We have a list of these animals. We use a tool to make a picture that shows how many animals we have.\n\nNext, we want to look at something special about these animals. We use two tools for this:\n\n1. A tool to find the special thing about the animals.\n2. A tool to make a picture that shows the special thing about the animals.\n\nSuppose we have found the special thing about the animals. Now, we will make a picture that shows the special thing about the animals.\n\nWe have a list of the special thing about the animals. We make a picture of this list.\n\nThis is what we did today. We learned how to count animals and find something special about them. We can use this to learn more about animals in different places.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 2286, "idx": 406310, "original text": "At the workshop, people were still confused. So I\ntried something new.\n\nI first made a simulated metagenome by taking three genomes worth of\ndata from the Chitsaz et al. (2011) paper (see\nhttp://bix.ucsd.edu/projects/singlecell/) and shuffling them together.\nI combined the sequences in a ratio of 10:25:50 for the E. coli\nsequences, the Staph sequences, and the SAR sequences, respectively;\nthe latter two were single-cell MDA genomic DNA. I took the first 10m\nreads of this mix and then estimated the coverage.\n\nYou can see the coverage of these genomic data sets estimated by using\nthe known reference sequences in the first figure. E. coli looks nice\nand Gaussian; Staph is smeared from here to heck; and much of the SAR\nsequence is low coverage. This reflects the realities of single cell\nsequencing: you get really weird copy number biases out of multiple\ndisplacement amplification.\n\nThen I applied three-pass digital normalization (see the paper) and\nplotted the new abundances. As a reminder, this operates without\nknowing the reference in advance; we're just using the known reference\nhere to check the effects.\n\nCoverage of genome read mix, calculated by mapping the mixed reads\nonto the known reference genomes.\n\nCoverage post-digital-normalization, again calculated by mapping\nthe mixed reads onto the known reference genomes.\n\nAs you can see, digital normalization literally \"normalizes\" the data\nto the best of its ability. That is, it cannot create higher coverage\nwhere high coverage doesn't exist (for the SAR), but it can convert\nthe existing high coverage into nice, Gaussian distributions centered\naround a much lower number. You also discard quite a bit of data (look\nat the X axes -- about 85% of the reads were discarded in downsampling\nthe coverage like this).\n\nWhen you assemble this, you get as good or better results than\nassembling the unnormalized data, despite having discarded so much\ndata. This is because no low-coverage data is discarded, so you still\nretain as much overall covered bases -- just in fewer reads. To boot,\nit works pretty generically for single genomes, MDA genomes,\ntranscriptomes, and metagenomes.\n\nAnd, as a reminder? Digital normalization does this in fixed, low\nmemory; in a single pass; and without any reference sequence needed.", "hash": "58809d34be654ea045d1fe36c3c2e6de0240ebf784068257d3d6694cdd693907"}

{"text": "Lesson: The Importance of Making Friends in Our Lives\nStart:\nMaking friends is important. It can help us be happy and learn new things. In this lesson, we will learn about the importance of making friends by looking at the friendship of Frank and Emma. We will see how their friendship changed over time and how it helped them.\nMain Parts:\n1. Learning about Making Friends\n2. The Friendship of Frank and Emma\n3. How their Friendship Helped Them\n4. End\nMain Part 1: Learning about Making Friends\nMaking friends is about meeting people who like the same things as us. In our lives, making friends has helped us learn and grow. For example, in the old days, painters and writers made friends to share ideas and learn new things. People like leaders used making friends to become powerful and important.\nBig Idea 2: The Friend Story of Frank and Emma\nFrank was a helper who worked for Queen Emma. He was one of the few people who stayed nice to the queen even after his wife, Charlotte, passed away. Queen Emma and Charlotte were close friends, and after Charlotte was gone, the queen was very sad. Still, Frank kept helping the queen, and they became good friends.\nTheir friendship had moments of being worried and not trusting each other, as both of them were careful about what the other might do. Queen Emma was scared that Frank might be angry at her because of his wife's passing, while Frank was worried about what the queen wanted from him. Even with these problems, they managed to stay friends for a lot of years.\nBig Idea 3: How their Friendship Affected Things\nThe friendship between Frank and Queen Emma had a big effect on both of them. For Queen Emma, being friends with Frank made her feel better and less lonely after her friend was gone. On the other side, Frank got to be a part of the queen's close friends, which helped him do better in his work and keep his place in the queen's house.\nAlso, their friendship showed how important making friends was in history. By staying friends with the queen, Frank could keep his place and do better in his work. In the same way, Queen Emma could trust Frank and know he was loyal, which helped her stay in power.\nIn the End:\nTo finish, this story has shown how important making friends was in history. By looking at the friendship of Frank and Queen Emma after Charlotte's passing, we can see how making friends can change people's lives and important events. The story also showed real examples of how making friends can help reach personal and work goals. Lastly, we learned how the friendship between Frank and Queen Emma shows the importance of making and keeping connections with others.\nWords to Know:\n- Making Friends: Making and keeping connections with people who like the same things or have the same goals.\n- Helper: A person who works for someone important or powerful.\n- Close Friends: A group of people who are friends with a powerful person or group.\n- Worry: Being scared that someone else might take what you like.\n- Doubt: Not being sure about someone or something.\n- Use: Being able to use or get into a place or to talk with someone important.\n- Move Forward: To go ahead or make progress.\n- Safe: To make safe or keep away from harm or danger.\n- Friendly: Being nice and warm.\n- Comfort: Feeling good when you are with someone or something.\n- Friendship: Being with someone or something.\n- Feeling: What you feel or think.\n- Comfort: Feeling good when you are with someone or something.\n- Friendship: Being with someone or something.\n- Close Friends: A group of friends who are very close.\n- Art Time: A time when people made lots of art and ideas.\n- Worry: Being scared that someone will take what you like.\n- Doubt: Not being sure about someone or something.\n- Access: Being able to use or go to a place or talk to a person who is important.\n- Move Ahead: To go forward or get better.\n- Safe: To make sure you are not hurt or in danger.\n- Friendly: Being nice and warm.\n- Comfort: Feeling good when you are with someone or something.\n- Friendship: Being with someone or something.\n- Feeling: What you feel or think.\n- Ending: The last decision or thought.\n- Use: Using something that you learned.\n- New Problems: Things that are hard to do that come up later.\n- Solutions: Good ways to fix problems.\n- Think Hard: Thinking about information and ideas to make a good decision.\n- Look Close: Looking at information in small parts to understand it better.\n- Mix: Putting different information together to understand something new.\n- Check: Looking at the good and bad parts of information and ideas.\n- Check Right: Making sure information and ideas are correct.\n- Check True: Making sure information and ideas are true.\n- Guess: Making a guess about something you see or feel.\n- Try: Trying to see if your guess is right.\n- Facts: Information you get by looking or trying.\n- Proof: Information that shows your guess is right or wrong.\n- Idea: A good guess about something you see or feel.\n- Rule: A fact that says how things work that is supported by proof and can be tested.\n- Picture: A simple picture of a big or hard thing or idea.\n- Pretend: Using a computer to pretend something.\n- Steps: Steps to solve a problem or do something.\n- Write Code: Writing code to do the steps.\n- Fix Mistakes: Finding and fixing mistakes in code.\n- Test: Making sure the code works right.\n- Use: Making the code ready for people to use.\n- Keep Good: Keeping the code working well and fast.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 476, "idx": 458867, "original text": "Catherine Carey book tour \u2013 The tumultous friendship of Francis Knollys and Elizabeth I after Catherine\u2019s death.

{"text": "Story: Learning to Understand What Customers Say\n\nIntroduction:\nWhat customers say is very important when we shop online. They tell us if the things we want to buy are good or not from their own experience. In this story, we will learn how to understand what customers say.\n\nPart 1: Understanding What Customers Say\n\nPeople talk about what they think of stuff they got or used. This is called a review. You can find reviews in words or videos on websites, apps, or places where people talk to each other online. Reviews can be happy, sad, or just okay. They can help you decide what to get or where to go shopping.\n\nPart 2: Reading What People Think\n\n- Start by reading the title of the review. This will help you know what the person thinks overall.\n- Look at the stars that the person gave (like 1-5 stars). This will help you know if the person is happy or sad about the thing.\n- Read all of the review carefully. Look for details, like what the person liked or didn't like about the thing.\n- Think about who wrote the review. Are they telling the truth? Do they write helpful reviews often?\n\nPart 3: Thinking About What People Think\n\n- Think about the story of the review. Was the person's story usual or unusual?\n- Look for the same things in many reviews. If many people talk about the same thing, it might be a big problem.\n- Look at reviews of the same thing on different websites or places. This will help you see more.\n\nPart 4: Using What People Think\n\n- Use what people think to help your research, not to do it all. Remember that reviews are what people think and may not be what you think or need.\n- Think about both happy and sad reviews when deciding. This will help you see all sides.\n- Use reviews to ask questions and find out about things that might worry you. This will help you decide and not be surprised.\n\nIn the end:\nWhat people think can be very helpful when shopping online. By understanding how to read and understand them, you can decide better on what to get and where to go shopping.

{"text": "## Lesson: Learning about Sun's Energy\n### Part 1: What is Sun's Energy?\nSun's energy is a kind of energy that comes from the sun. We can get it in different ways such as using sun cells, sun collectors, and sun water heaters. Sun's energy is clean, can be used again and again, and it is good for nature.\n### Part 2: How does Sun's Energy Work?\nSun's energy works by changing sunlight into electricity. Sun cells, are made of special materials that take in sunlight and let out tiny particles called electrons. These electrons move around in the cell, making electricity. The more sunlight that hits the cell, the more electricity is made.\n### Part 3: How can we use Sun's Energy?\nSun's energy can be used in many ways, including giving power to houses and shops, heating water, and giving electricity to places far away. It can also be used to charge batteries, power cars, and even give light when there is a problem.\n### Part 4: Good and Bad things about Sun's Energy\nGood things about sun's energy include it can be used again, is good for nature, and can save money over time. However, bad things include the first cost of setting it up, sometimes it doesn't work because of the weather, and the need for places to store it.\n### Part 5: Ending\nSun's energy is a good thing that can help us use less old energy sources and make a better future. By knowing the simple facts about sun's energy and how we can use it, we can think about whether sun's energy is good for us and our towns.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 699, "idx": 470404, "original text": "- U.S.News & World Report\u20224 days agoHow Will a Clinton or Trump White House Affect Renewable Energy?.. - 24/7 Wall St.\u20224 days agoShort Sellers Piling Into Solar Energy Stocks.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Big and Small Boxes\n\n## Chapter 1: Introduction\n\nIn this lesson, we will learn about big and small boxes. We will talk about what big and small boxes are and how to play with them. By the end of this lesson, you will be able to play with big and small boxes well.\n\n## Chapter 2: Big and Small Boxes\n\nBig and small boxes are boxes that can be used in your playtime. They are useful when you want to play and make things. You can use them to store your toys.\n\n## Chapter 3: Playing With Big and Small Boxes\n\nTo play with a big or small box, you can put your toys in it. For example, if you have a big box called \"toy box\" that is empty, you can put your toys in it, such as your teddy bear.\n\n```\ntoy box = empty\n\nfunction put_toy_in_box()\n    toy box = toy box + 1 toy\nend\n\nput_toy_in_box()\n```\n\nTo add more toys to your box, you can keep putting your toys in it. For example, if you have a box called \"toy box\" that is empty, you can put your toys in it using your hands.\n\n```\ntoy box = empty\n\nfunction add_toy(toy)\n    toy box\n    put_toy_in_box(toy)\nend\n\nadd_toy(ball)\nadd_toy(doll)\nadd_toy(car)\n```\n\n## Chapter 4: Fun Games with Big and Small Boxes\n\nHere are some fun games you can play with big and small boxes:\n\n1. Making a tower:\n```\ntower = empty\n\nfunction add_to_tower(toy)\n    tower\n    tower += toy\nend\n\nfor i in 1:10\n    add_to_tower(toy)\nend\n```\n\n2. Playing hide and seek with toys:\n```\nhide and seek = \"\"\n\nfunction add_to_hide_and_seek(toy)\n    hide and seek\n    hide and seek += toy\nend\n\nfor toy in all_toys\n    add_to_hide_and_seek(toy)\nend\n```\n\n3. Making a surprise box:\n```\nsurprise box = empty\n\nfunction add_surprise(toy)\n    surprise box\n    put_toy_in_box(surprise, toy)\nend\n\nfor i in 1:5\n    add_surprise(toy)\nChapter 5: Word List\n\n- Big word: A word that can be used by any part of your story.\n- Big word group: A group of words that can be used by any part of your story.\n- 'add': A way to put things in a big word group.\n- 'addfirst': A way to put things at the start of a big word group.\n\nAt The End\n\nChanging big words and word groups in stories is easy.

Is there a way to use !push to update a global array?\nWhile playing in the REPL, I want to update a global variable, then push! the result to a global array to store it.\nvar = [1]\nres = []\n\nfor i in 1:5\n  global var\n  global res\n  push!(var,i)\n  print(string(var,\"\\n\"))\n  push!(res,var)\nend\n\nHowever, the values stored in res are as follows:\n [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nWhereas I would expect this:\n[1, 1]\n[1, 1, 2]\n[1, 1, 2, 3]\n[1, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nParticularly puzzling since behaviour seems as expected with variables, instead of arrays:\nvar = 1\nres = []\n\nfor i in 1:5\n  global var\n  global res\n  var = var + i\n  print(string(var,\"\\n\"))\n  push!(res, var)\nend\n\nWhich gives expected result:\n  2\n  4\n  7\n 11\n 16\n\nI am clearly missing something.\n\nA:\n\nYou're pushing the same var array to every spot in the res array.  For example:\njulia> var = [1]\n1-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 1\n\njulia> res = [var, var]\n2-element Array{Array{Int64,1},1}:\n [1]\n [1]\n\njulia> var[1] = 2\n2\n\njulia> res\n2-element Array{Array{Int64,1},1}:\n [2]\n [2]\n\nBoth elements in the res array are var itself. So if you modify var (with push! or indexed assignment or somesuch), then no matter how you access it you'll see those modifications.\nThis doesn't occur with numbers because you cannot modify numbers themselves.  You can change which number is stored in an array, but you cannot change the number 1 to represent 2 everywhere that 1 had previously been used \u2014\u00a0that's the equivalent of what's happening here.\nTo fix this, you'll often want to just create your var array inside the for loop (instead of outside it).  But in this case, since you're iteratively adding things to var and want to save that intermediate state, you can use copy:\njulia> for i in 1:5\n         global var\n         global res\n         push!(var,i)\n         print(string(var,\"\\n\"))\n         push!(res,copy(var))\n       end\nAny[1]\nAny[1, 2]\nAny[1, 2, 3]\nAny[1, 2, 3, 4]\nAny[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\njulia> res\n5-element Array{Any,1}:\n Any[1]\n Any[1, 2]\n Any[1, 2, 3]\n Any[1, 2, 3, 4]\n Any[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n", "hash": "4a786d97f8db2f13dd13194fd0a1c6df8c10c48a1f374325f8fca1c1d1a1a989"}

{"text": "Story: How to Take Apart a Bed\n\n### Start\n\nBig beds can be hard to move. So, we need to take them apart before we move them. In this story, we will learn how to take apart a big bed step by step.\n\n### Things We Need\n\n- A tool to turn screws\n- A soft hammer\n- A set of tools to turn bolts\n- A light (if it's dark)\n\n### Step 1: Get Ready\n\nFind a big space to work in. Make sure the room is clear and has enough space to move around the big bed.\n\n### Step 2: Find the Little Metal Circles\n\nLook for the little metal circles that keep the big bed together. Usually, these circles are on the top part, bottom part, and sides of the bed.\n\n### Step 3: Take Out the Little Metal Circles\n\nUsing a tool, take out the little metal circles that keep the big bed together. Be careful not to lose any of them.\n\n### Step 4: Use a Soft Hammer\n\nIf the little metal circles are hard to remove, use a soft hammer to gently tap them out. Be careful not to hurt the wood.\n\n### Step 5: Take Out the Wood Pieces\n\nTake out the wood pieces from the big bed. Depending on the bed, you may need to use a tool to take out the wood pieces.\n\n### Step 6: Take Off the Steps\n\nIf the big bed has steps, take them off from the bed. Usually, there will be things that keep the steps in place. Use a tool to take off the steps.\n\n### Step 7: Take Out the Support Legs\n\nIf the big bed has legs for support, take them out. Usually, there will be little metal circles keeping the legs in place. Use a tool to take out the legs.\n\n### Step 8: Take Out the Top and Bottom Parts\n\nOnce all the little metal circles are taken out, gently lift the top part and bottom part off the big bed.\n\n### Step 9: Look for More Little Metal Circles\n\nLook for any more little metal circles that may be keeping the big bed together. If needed, use a tool to take out these circles.\n\n### Step 10: Take Apart the Bed\n\nOnce all the little metal circles are taken out, gently take apart the big bed. Use a tool to separate the parts.\n\n### In the End\n\nBy doing these easy steps, you can take apart a big bed quickly and easily. Remember to prepare enough space to work in and to be careful when taking out the little metal circles and taking apart the bed. With a little patience and attention, you'll have your big bed taken apart in no time!", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 5546, "idx": 439219, "original text": "How to Dismantle a Bunk Bed\n\nBunk beds are heavy and awkward to move, which is why preparing to take apart your bunk bed properly before you move is essential. We recommend disassembling your bunk bed before the moving truck arrives. This will prevent you from being left scrambling to dismantle your bunk bed after having unsuccessfully attempted to pivot it every which way to get it through the door frame.\n\nBunk Beds can be one of the most time-wasting furniture pieces to dismantle on the day of your move. The greater the preparation of simple things such as bunk beds the more likely you are to feel ready to face moving day. So here we offer Removals and Storage Experts easy guide for how to dismantle a bunk bed.\n\nFor the required tools and ten simple steps that break down how to take apart a bunk bed in detail with pictures to guide you the whole way through read on!\n\nBefore you begin:\n\nPrepare enough space to work in\n\nThis is essential, as you do not want to be dismantling and find yourself cornered with pieces of the frame tumbling down on you. Take the time to clear the room the bunk bed is in as much as possible and then move the bed into the centre of the room.\n\nEnsure you have someone working with you\n\nYou should never build or dismantle anything with heavy parts without having at least someone in the the room with you, but ideally helping you. Dismantling furniture can be dangerous if something gets dropped, especially if you are not wearing proper protective gear like steel toed boots.\n\nWear protective clothing\n\nHow to dismantle a bunk bed:\n\nPrepare your tools\n\nCordless drill\n\nAllen (hex) bit\n\nAllen (hex) keys\n\nslot screwdriver\n\nPhillips screwdriver\n\nRemove the mattresses from the frame and place them aside\n\nNow is as good a time as any to wrap your mattress in plastic. This will keep dirt and dust out of your mattresses and doing it before you take apart your bunk bed reduces the likelihood of forgetting to do it later. To create space in the room for deconstruction we recommend that you place the mattresses in another room, especially if you are working in a tight space.\n\nRemove the screws from the ladder side of the bed using your screwdriver\n\nAs with all hardware, we suggest that you place the screws into a plastic bag and keep it in the same place in the room, like a window sill, as you dismantle your bunk bed. It is also a good idea to keep all tools in the same place to prevent accidents and ensure the safety of yourself and whomever is helping you to take the bunk bed apart.\n\nRemove the ladder from the bunk and place safely to the side\n\nWhy not wrap as you go? Keep a blanket handy to wrap the ladder in before you place aside. The best place is with the mattresses, safely out of the way and ready for transport into the moving truck.\n\nBe mindful of supporting screws\n\nSupporting screws may fall off the bed as or after you remove the main screws. Ensure you are paying attention to these and continue to place screws into your plastic bag for safe keeping as you go.\n\nRemove the ladder side of the bed and ensure all screws have been removed\n\nAs you take apart your bunk bed it is important to be thorough so you risk neither losing parts nor leaving hazards on the floor. You will also be saving yourself some hassle by ensuring all screws on this side of the bed have been taken out before you try to remove this side of the frame.\n\nRemove this whole side of the bed\n\nWe recommend always working with more than one body when deconstructing or moving any furniture. It is especially important in this case, as with two people you can support the side that is still in tact from either end of the bed as you remove this side of the bunk bed frame.\n\nOnce the sides are removed, continue by dismantling safety rails\n\nThe safety rail is attached to the outer side rail of the upper bunk via screws. Unscrew these and remove the safety rail, putting aside with other parts. Again, keep all screws together and ensure there are two people working to keep remaining attached parts of the bunk bed supported.\n\nTake the other side of the bed apart as above\n\nTaking apart a bunk bed is a matter of careful handling and teamwork. You will want to coordinate with the other person handling the task before flipping the frame of the bunk bed over to tackle the other side.\n\nSecure all parts of the bed including the screws\n\nIt is a good idea to wrap each section of the bed individually to prevent scratching or damage in the moving truck. You can use strong tape to adhere the plastic bag with screws to one part of the bed or create a box of all hardware from all furniture so that everything is in the same place. Either way, it is essential that you label the plastic bag so you know where the screws belong!\n\nTips for making your dismantled bunk bed easy to assemble again on the other side:\n\nKeep all the bolts and screws in a plastic bag and label it so it doesn\u2019t get lost in a pile with miscellaneous nuts and bolts from your relocation.\n\nWrap the bed frames in protective moving blankets before loading them on the truck to prevent scratching and scuffing.\n\nWrap your mattresses in plastic to keep dust out.\n\nWhile we are sure you can do it by yourself we are happy to do it for you!

{"text": "Lesson Title: How to Pick the Best Stuff to Make a Dock\n\nIntroduction:\nIn this lesson, we will learn why picking the right stuff to make a dock is important. We will learn about different kinds of stuff, what they can do, and how they can make a dock strong and last a long time. At the end of this lesson, you will know which stuff is the best for making a dock that can handle rain and wind and be a safe place for your fun.\n\nSection 1: Kinds of Stuff to Make a Dock\n\nThere are a few kinds of stuff that can be used to make a dock, like wood, mixed stuff, and metal. Each kind of stuff has good things and not so good things, and what you pick will depend on things like how much money you have, how long you want the dock to last, and what you want to use the dock for.\n\nWood: Wood is picked a lot for making docks because it is easy to find, not too expensive, and can be changed into any shape. But, wood can also get bad from bugs and needs to be looked after a lot to stop these problems.\n\nMixed stuff: Mixed stuff is made from a mix of things like wood and plastic to make a stronger and longer lasting stuff. This stuff is often used to make docks because it doesn't get bad from rain and it doesn't need as much looking after as wood.\n\nMetal: Metal is a strong and long lasting stuff that is often used to make big docks. While metal costs more than wood or mixed stuff, it doesn't get worn out as easily, so it's a good pick for a long time.\n\nSection 2: What Stuff Can Do When Used to Make a Dock\n\nEach kind of stuff has special things that it can do which can make the dock strong and last a long time. For example, wood is not too slippery when wet, which is good for a dock where water can make the ground hard to walk on. Mixed stuff doesn't get bad from rain, which can help stop the dock from getting old and bad. Metal is very strong and lasts a long time, which is good for big docks that are used a lot.\n\nSection 3: How to Pick the Best Stuff to Make a Dock\n\nWhen picking stuff to make a dock, there are a few things to think about, like how much money you have, how long you want the dock to last, and what you want to use the dock for. It's also important to pick stuff that is good for the place where the dock will be. For example, if the dock will be near the sea, it makes sense to use stuff that doesn't get bad from water.\n\nConclusion:\nIn this lesson, we have learned why picking the right stuff to make a dock is important. We learned about different kinds of stuff, what they can do, and how they can make a dock strong and last a long time. By knowing these things, we can make a good choice about what stuff is best for what we need. Whether you are making a simple fishing dock or a big dock, the right stuff will make sure that your dock is safe, can be trusted, and will last a long time.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 969, "idx": 654253, "original text": "Dock Materials that Perform. Build yourself a dock you can trust, one that not only survives the elements, but excels in them. By using the finest materials, you can rest easy in the knowledge that your dock will last.. When building in a marine environment, it makes sense to use materials that come from one of the wetest places on earth: the Brazilian rainforest. Wood harvested from the jungle is extremely dense, creating its own waterproof barrier. A naturally slip-resistant surface makes it perfect for a dock, where water can make footing treacherous.. Of course, the last thing you want is to take a plunge when your dock breaks. Exotic wood is the strongest in the world, and simply won\u2019t cave in under pressure. Its natural rot resistance and herculean toughness means that it will far outlast a dock made of pressure-treated pine or composite material.. Don\u2019t settle for less than you deserve.

I need to get one for a job I\u2019m applying for but I\u2019m not sure where to call.\n\nA: You can actually apply online for a Transportation Worker Identification Credential card. The Maritime Transportation Security Act requires this card for workers who need access to secure areas of the nation\u2019s maritime facilities/vessels. The Transportation Security Administration conducts a security threat assessment (background check) to determine a person\u2019s eligibility and issues the credential. U.S. citizens and non-U.S. citizens in certain immigrant/nonimmigrant categories may apply for the credential. Visit universalenroll.dhs.gov/programs/twic to apply, or for more information such as which documents will be required. You can also apply online to transfer your TWIC card, or replace a lost, stolen or damaged card.\n\nQ: I read that the Kahekili Highway on the Lahaina side of Kahakuloa village will be undergoing repairs for several months. Isn\u2019t that going to screw traffic up completely on that side? The tourists don\u2019t always get the memo when it comes to local construction projects.\n\nA: Good point, but I\u2019m told that besides putting out the media alerts we will also be reaching out directly to the rental car agencies, hotel associations and tour companies to make sure they know that we are going to close that area of Kahekili from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday from July 10 to the end of the year at least. That, along with the electronic signs, should provide enough notice to keep the bulk of the tourists from heading in that direction.\n\nQ: I am 9 years old and my mom is helping me to write this email. I learned in school this year that the official color for Maui is pink. How come we don\u2019t have more pink on the island?\n\nA: Yes, you are absolutely correct, the official color of Maui is pink because of the Damask rose, or Lokelani rose, that grows here. It is a very beautiful flower that unfortunately is very rare, which is why you don\u2019t see more of its pink petals around the island. Tell your mom that she may be able to take you to see the flower at the Kula Ag Park or at Hale Ho\u2019ike\u2019ike, formerly the Bailey House Museum.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Different Kinds of Windows\n\nStart:\nWindows are parts of a house. They let in light, air, and let us see outside. But, not all windows are the same. There are many kinds of windows. Each kind has its own good things. In this lesson, we will learn about different kinds of windows, why they are good, and how they can make your home better.\n\nPart 1: One Glass Windows\nOne glass windows are very simple. They have one piece of glass in a frame. They are easy to make and put in a house, but they do not keep your house warm or cool. This is because air can move through them. This can make your house cold in the winter and hot in the summer.\n\nPart 2: Two Glass Windows\nTwo glass windows have two pieces of glass in a frame. There is a small space in between. This space can have air or safe gases like argon. This can keep your house warm or cool. Two glass windows are better than one glass windows because they keep your house warm or cool. But, they are not as good as three glass windows.\n\nPart 3: Three Glass Windows\nThree glass windows are the best kind of windows. They have three pieces of glass in a frame. There are two spaces in between. The middle space has a safe gas like argon or krypton. This keeps your house warm or cool and keeps noise out.\n\nGood Things About Different Kinds of Windows\n- One glass windows: Easy to make and put in a house, but do not keep your house warm or cool\n- Two glass windows: Better than one glass windows, but not as good as three glass windows\n- Three glass windows: The best kind of windows, they keep your house warm or cool and keep noise out\n\nEnd:\nKnowing about different kinds of windows is important. One glass windows are not very good at keeping your house warm or cool. Three glass windows are the best at this. Two glass windows are in the middle.

The middle layer is generally surrounded by an inert gas like argon or krypton (or sometimes a mixture), which is trapped by the outer and inner panes. A triple pane window provides more insulation and is more energy efficient than the more common double pane window (or dual pane), not just because of the added barrier, but because this extra layer allows another surface to be given a low-emittance (Low-E) coating.\n\nDouble Paned Windows consist of two facing glass panels set in a frame, separated by a small space \u00bd inch to \u00be inch (12.7 \u2013 19.05 mm) wide.

{"text": "Lesson: Homes You Can Rent and Buy\n\n**Start:** Homes you can rent and buy, also known as rent-to-own homes, are a different way to buy a house. In this lesson, we will learn about the good and bad things about rent to own homes, how to get a rent to own home, and how to know if a rent to own home is good for you.\n\n**Part 1: What is a Home You Can Rent and Buy?**\n\nA home you can rent and buy is a house that lets a person rent a house and then buy the house after a certain time. A person gives money to the house owner for a while, usually one to three years. During this time, they can save money for the house by paying towards the price.\n\n**Part 2: Good Things About Paying for a House While Living in It**\n\nThere are some good things about paying for a house while living in it, including:\n\n- Saving Money: By giving money towards the price of the house, you can save money over time. This can help you in the long run when it is time to buy the house.\n- Trying Out a Place: Living in a house while paying for it lets you try out a place before deciding to stay for a long time. This can help you make sure that the area is good for you and your family before you buy.\n- Better Credit: Giving money on time can help make your credit better, which can make it easier to get a loan when it's time to buy the house.\n\n**Part 3: Things to Think About When Paying for a House While Living in It**\n\nWhile there are good things about paying for a house while living in it, there are also some things to think about, including:\n\n- More Costs: Living in a house while paying for it can be more costly than just living in a house because you are giving money towards the price of the house. Also, if you decide not to buy the house at the end, you may lose the money you paid towards the price.\n- Changing House Prices: If you start living in a house and paying for it when house prices are going up, you may end up giving more money for the house than you would have if you had just waited to buy. On the other hand, if house prices go down during your stay, you may end up with less money saved for the house than you would have if you had just lived in a similar house.\n\n**Part 4: How to Pay for a House While Living in It**\n\nThe way to pay for a house while living in it usually involves these steps:\n\n1. Find a house owner who is willing to let you pay for the house while living in it. You can find these houses on websites or by working with a person who helps find houses to live in while paying for them.\n2. Talk about the details of the stay, including the price of the house, the length of the stay, and the amount of money you will give each month.\n3. Sign the stay paper and give the first month's money.\n4. Start saving money for the house by giving money towards the price.\n5. At the end of the stay, decide whether to buy the house or move out.\n\n**Part 5: Deciding if Paying for a House While Living in It is Good for You**\n\nLiving in a house while paying for it may be a good choice for you if:\n\n- You don't have enough money for a big payment on a normal loan.\n- You want to live in a specific area but aren't sure if you want to stay for a long time.\n- You need to make your credit better before getting a loan.\n\nIf you are not sure about your big plans or if you think house costs may go down during the time of your rent, it may be better to wait and save for a normal down payment instead.\n\n**Words to know:**\n- Rent-to-Own: A type of house buying where the buyer rents the house for a set time before buying it.\n- Buying Price: The cost at which the house will be sold at the end of the rent time.\n- Savings: The difference between the worth of a house and the amount of money still owed on it.\n\n**End:** Rent to own houses can be a good choice for those who want to save up in a house while trying out a neighborhood.

Kids will learn the basics of each simple code and how they work together to make fun web pages. We will learn about these things:\n\n1. Simple Code: The Basics\n2. Styling Web Pages\n3. Making Web Pages Fun\n\nChapter 1: Simple Code - The Basics\n\nSimple Code is what every web page starts with. It makes the structure and content for web pages. In this chapter, we will learn about these things:\n\n1. What is Simple Code?\n2. Making a Web Page\n3. Basic Simple Code Words\n\n**What is Simple Code?**\nSimple Code is a type of language used to make web pages. Simple Code is made up of a series of words that make the structure and content of a web page.\n\n**Making a Web Page**\nTo make a web page, you need to open a writing tool (like Notepad or a simple text tool) and type this code:\n\n```simple code\n<!DOCTYPE simple>\n<simple>\n<head>\n\t<title>My First Web Page</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n\t<h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>\n\t<p>This is my first web page.</p>\n</body>\n</simple>\n```\n\n**Basic Simple Code Words**\nThere are several basic Simple Code words that you should know. Here are some common ones:\n\n- `<!DOCTYPE simple>`: This word tells us the type of Simple Code being used.\n- `<simple>`: This word starts the Simple Code document.\n- `<head>`: This word contains extra information about the document, like the title.\n- `<title>`: This word tells us the title of the document.\n- `<body>`: This word contains the visible content of the document.\n- `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`: These words define headings of different sizes.\nLet's learn about making things with a computer!\n\nExercise: Open a book or a notepad. Write the steps above and pretend to be making a web page.\n\nPart 2: How to Make Things Look Nice on Your Page\n\nThis part is about how to make things look nice on your page. We will learn about the following things:\n\n1. What does it mean to make things look nice?\n2. Why is it important to make things look nice?\n3. How to choose what things to show on your page.\n\n**What does it mean to make things look nice?**\nMaking things look nice means deciding how your page should look. You can choose the colors, shapes, places, and other things on your page.\n\n**Why is it important to make things look nice?**\nIt's important to make things look nice because it helps you to keep your page easy to change and update.\n\n**How to choose what things to show on your page.**\nThere are special ways to choose what things to show on your page. Here are some common ones:\n\n- `big title`: Chooses any big title on the page.\n- `big title a`: Chooses any `a` that is a part of a big title.\n- `myButton`: Chooses any thing with a name \"myButton\".\n- `myClass`: Chooses any thing named \"myClass\".\n\nExercise: Open the page you made before and make some things look nice on it. For example:\n\n```css\npage {\n\twords: simple words;\n\tbackground: light grey;\n}\nbig title {\n\tin the middle;\n\tcolor: dark grey;\n}\n```\n\nSave your work and pretend to open it on a computer to see the changes.\n\nPart 3: How to Make Your Page Do Things\n\nThis part is about how to make your page do things. We will learn about the following things:\n\n1. What does it mean to make your page do things?\n2. How to tell your page what to do.\n3. Playing with Words\n\n**What does it mean to make your page do things?**\nMaking your page do things means making it change when you do something.\n\n**How to tell your page what to do.**\nTelling your page what to do is like talking to other people. Here is an example of a simple way to tell your page what to do:\n\n```javascript\nvar message = \"Hello, friends!\"Look at the message on the screen. \n\n**Playing with Things to Remember**\nWe use special things, called variables, to keep information in a language called JavaScript. Here are some types of variables:\n\n- `number`: Keeps whole numbers, like 10 or 3.5.\n- `string`: Keeps words or sentences, like \"Hello\" or \"World\".\n- `boolean`: Keeps yes or no answers.\n\nLet's do something fun: Open a writing program and start a new page. Write this special code and save the file with a `.js` ending:\n\n```javascript\n// Choose a variable\nvar name = \"Jack\";\n\n// Show the name on the screen\nconsole.log(\"My name is \" + name);\n```\n\nSave your page and open it in a place where you browse the web to see what happens.\n\nWords to Remember:\n- HTML: A special language we use to make web pages\n- CSS: A special way to make web pages look pretty\n- JavaScript: A special language used to make web pages do cool things\n- Element: A part of a web page\n- Attribute: Something special about a part of a web page\n- Selector: A way to choose specific parts in CSS\n- Programming Language: A special language used to write programs\n\nWhat we learned:\nIn this lesson, we learned about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

{"text": "Lesson: How to Learn and Understand House Stories\n\nIntroduction:\nHouse stories are like telling tales to sell or rent homes. They have important things that buyers or people who want to live in them need to know before making a choice. In this lesson, we will learn how to read and understand house stories by looking at one example.\n\nSection 1: Understanding the Basics\n\n- What is a house story?\nA house story is like telling a tale used to show a home for sale or rent. It has things about the home, like where it is, how big it is, what it has, and how much it costs.\n\n- Why are house stories important?\nHouse stories are important because they tell potential buyers or people who want to live in them about a home. This information can help them decide if the home is good for their needs and money.\n\nSection 2: Looking at the Story\n\n- Where it is\nThe home is at a place called SA Street. This tells us where the home is and can help us decide if it is in a place we like.\n\n- Home Details\nThe home is a lovely one with a view of the big sea, beach, and island pond setting. It has been made prettier and has nice things in it. The outside sitting area has glass around it for fun all year. The cooking area has white cupboards and has been made prettier, opening up to the eating room. This home has great views of the big sea.\n\n- Fun things\nThe place has many fun things, including three warm pools, eight places to play tennis, two big club rooms, a place to exercise with a spa, places to play with balls, places to eat outside with outside cookers and tiki eating tables. The place also has people watching all day and night.\n\n- How much it costs\nHow much they want for this home is not told. However, this can usually be found by talking to a house seller or the home owner.\n\nSection 3: Real Examples and Simple Math\n\n- How to find out how big a room is\nIf we know how long and wide a room is, we can find out how big it is using simple math: Big Room = Length x Width. For example, if a room is 12 steps long and 10 steps wide, its size would be 120 steps big (12 x 10).\n\n- How to compare how much it costs\nTo compare costs, we need to know how much they want for the home. We can then compare this cost to other homes in the same place to decide if it is a good deal. We can also use a simple math tool to guess our monthly payments and decide if the home is affordable.\n\nWords to know:\n- Story: A tale used to show a home for sale or rent.\n- Where it is: The address and neighborhood of a home.\n- Home Details: Information about the things and condition of a home.\n- Fun things: Extra services or places provided by a place or building.\n- How much it costs: The amount of money needed to buy or rent a home.\n\nConclusion:\nWe can make good choices about homes by understanding simple home details and looking at the information given. By looking at prices and figuring out how big a home is, we can see if a home is right for what we need and can afford.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 712, "idx": 10598, "original text": "5760 MIDNIGHT PASS RD, SARASOTA. - Property Details. - Map This Property.

We will also find out about a super small part of this tiny thing and how this could help us understand more about the world around us.\n\nSection 1: What are Tiny Bits?\n\nTiny bits are the smallest pieces of things that we can't cut into smaller pieces. A tiny bit like a small bead has two main parts: its color and its shape.\n\nSection 2: Finding a Hidden Part of the Small Bead\n\nIn a recent game, some smart people were able to find a hidden part of the small bead, its \u2018twirly bit\u2019. This was a big win in the game as people had been guessing about it for many years but never found it.\n\nSection 3: What the Finding Means\n\nFinding the twirly bit is very important for our understanding of warm wires and the making of magic computers. Warm wires are materials that can let electricity pass through without any push back at quite warm temperatures. How this happens has been a puzzle for many years, and finding the twirly bit could give important clues about how it works.\n\nMagic computers, on the other hand, are a new type of computer that uses magic bits instead of normal bits. Magic bits can be in many states at once, letting magic computers do certain math problems much faster than normal computers. Finding the twirly bit could help us understand how to make and use magic bits better.\n\nSection 4: Big Questions\n\n1. Why is it important to study tiny bits like the small bead?\n2. How does finding the twirly bit change our understanding of warm wires and magic computers?\n3.

{"text": "Story: Learning about Smoothing Clay\n\n## Part 1: Simple Ideas\nSmoothing clay is the job of making the top of new clay nice and even. You can do this with different toys and ways, like spatulas, flat toys, brushes, and rulers. The point of smoothing clay is to make a nice, even, and pretty top that has no bumps or holes.\n\n## Part 2: Fun Examples\nOne usual way of smoothing clay is to use a flat toy, which is a flat, square toy with a handle. The flat toy is moved over the top of the clay, making a nice, patterned finish. Another way is using a spatula to put a layer of clay helper (also called \"smoothing helper\") onto the top of the clay. This helper makes any bumps go away and makes the top look the same all over.\n\n## Part 3: Everyday Stories\nSmoothing clay is a must-do step in many building projects, like houses and shops, bridges, and roads. It is also used in pretty clay uses, like tabletops, floors, and walls. As well as making the clay look good, the right smoothing ways can also make it stronger and last longer.\n\n## Part 4: Chatty Talks\nOne talk about smoothing clay is whether doing it by hand or using a machine is better. While a machine can give a more same finish, some say that the human hand gives a more special and personal result. Also, people talk about the good things about using different types of clay helpers and how they change the end result.\n\n## Word Box\n- Clay: A building stuff made from a mix of powder, water, and tiny rocks (like sand, pebbles, or crushed stone).\n- Smoothing: The job of making the top of new clay nice and even to make it look and feel how you want.\n- Smoothing Helper: A kind of clay helper that is put on the top of the clay to make any bumps go away and make the top look the same all over.\n\n## The End\nSmoothing clay is an important step in making a strong, long-lasting, and pretty top.

{"text": "Story: Getting to Know Place Pointers\n\nStart:\nPlace pointers are used to point out a certain spot on Earth. They are made of lines up and down and lines side to side, which together form the pointers that help us find our way in the world. In this story, we will learn about the simple things of place pointers, including how they work and why they are important.\n\nPart 1: What are Place Pointers?\n\nPlace pointers are a set of numbers that show a certain spot on the Earth's top. We use special numbers to find places. These numbers are like a big map with squares. Each place has its own special numbers. \n\nWe use two types of numbers to find a place. One number tells us how far up or down it is. The other number tells us how far left or right it is. These two numbers help us find any place.\n\nSection 2: Why are these special numbers important?\n\nThese special numbers are important because they help us find places easily. We can tell others these numbers so they can find the place too. These numbers also help us make a plan to go from one place to another.\n\nSection 3: How do these special numbers work?\n\nWe make a big map with squares. Each square has its own special numbers. These numbers are like a big clock. They go from 1 to 90. Each number from 1 to 90 has 60 smaller numbers. Each smaller number has 60 even smaller numbers. This makes a big clock with many numbers.\n\nFor example, the special numbers for a tall tower in FR country are 48 and 2. This means that the tower is 48 squares up and 2 squares right.\n\nSection 4: Let's use the special numbers\n\nLet's say you want to visit the tall tower in FR country. You can use the special numbers 48 and 2 to find it. You can use a map or a special device to help you. As you go, the device will show you the way to the tower.\n\nWe can also use these special numbers to keep us safe. If people are getting sick in one place, we can use the special numbers to find that place. Then we can help the people there.\n\nConclusion:\nIn the end, these special numbers help us find places. We can use them to go places, tell others about places, and keep us safe.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 1002, "idx": 616092, "original text": "AMPRO is a leader in the design, installation, maintenance and management of facility lighting, commercial signage, and electrical services.

{"text": "Story: Friendship in Playtime\n\n### Beginning\nIn this story, we will learn about friendship in playtime and how it can be fun for both friends involved. We will explore the different types of friendships, the fun of having a friend, and the steps involved in making a successful friendship. By the end of this story, you will be able to spot the important parts of a good friendship and understand how they can help your playtime grow.\n\n### Part 1: Types of Friendships\nThere are several types of friendships that kids can make, including play friends, school friends, and best friends. Each type of friendship has its own fun and challenges, so it's important to choose the right one for your playtime.\n\n1. Being Friends and Sharing Things\nWhen friends share things and work together, they are all responsible for what they do. This means if something goes wrong, all friends need to help fix it.\n\n2. Some Friends Do More, Some Do Less\nIn this case, there are two kinds of friends. Some friends do more work and are responsible if something goes wrong. Other friends give toys or snacks, but they don't do much work or need to fix things if they go wrong.\n\n3. All Friends are Safe (AFS)\nAFS is like being friends and sharing things, but all friends are safe. This means every friend only needs to fix problems they make, not problems that other friends or helpers make.\n\n### Section 2: Good Things About Sharing\nSharing with friends can make lots of good things happen. Some of these good things are:\n\n1. Sharing Toys and Snacks\nWhen friends share toys, snacks, and ideas, they can save their own and do things better.\n\n2. Making More Friends\nBy sharing with other friends, you can make new friends and play in new places. This can make more fun games and parties.\n\n3. Sharing Problems\nWhen two or more friends share things together, they can also share any problems. This can help all friends feel safer and happier.\n\n4. Looking Cool\nSharing can make all friends look cool. By working together, friends can show that they are clever and kind.\n\n### Section 3: How to Share Well\nSharing well needs time, hard work, and talking. Here are some steps to share well:\n\n1. Want the Same Things\nAll friends should want the same toys, snacks, or games. This makes sure everyone is happy and working together.\n\n2. Check Everything\nBefore starting to share, all friends should check if they like the same things and play the same way. This can stop fights or sad feelings later.\n\n3. Make a Sharing Plan\nA plan should be made that tells who does what, who gets what, and what everyone hopes will happen. This can stop mistakes and fights later.\n\n4. Talk a Lot\nTalking a lot and being honest is important to share well. All friends should talk often to make sure everyone is happy and working together.\n\n5. Check How It's Going Often\nFriends should often check if the sharing is working and make changes if needed. This makes sure all friends are happy with the sharing and that it's working for them.\n\n### Word List\n- Some Friends Do More, Some Do Less: A way of sharing where there are two kinds of friends - some who do more work and are responsible if something goes wrong, and others who give toys or snacks but don't do much work or need to fix things if they go wrong.\nFriendship Circle (FC): A kind of friendship where everyone looks after each other. This means each friend only needs to think about what they do, not what their friends do.\n- Making Sure: This is when you check everything is okay before becoming friends. You want to make sure you like the same things and get along well.\n\n### Ending\nFriendships can be really good for people who want to do well and be happy. By understanding different kinds of friendships, the good things about having friends, and how to be a good friend, you can have a friendship that helps everyone. Remember to talk a lot, check how things are going, and always know what you want and hope for.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 889, "idx": 115345, "original text": "Turning Stone Resort Casino in Verona plans to announce details soon of a new three-year partnership with the International Boxing Hall of Fame in Canastota, officials said..

{"text": "Lesson: Learning about Being a Doctor\n\n**Introduction**\n\nBeing a doctor is a very important job. In our country, there are many rules that doctors must follow. One of these rules is that they must have a special permission to be a doctor. This permission is called a license.\n\nA license is a special permission that the government gives to doctors. It is to make sure that the doctors know what they are doing and can help people. But, some people say that this can make things harder for doctors and people who need help from doctors.\n\n**Main Topic**\n\nSome people say that having licenses for doctors can make there be fewer doctors. When there are fewer doctors, the cost of going to the doctor can be higher. This is because people are willing to pay more when there are not many doctors.\n\nAlso, having licenses can make it hard for new doctors to start working. This can make it hard for new ideas and changes to happen in the doctor's work.\n\n**Subtopic**\n\nSome people also say that licenses can make it hard for people to find a doctor in some places. This is because doctors are often needed to work in specific places or areas of work. This can make it hard for people in some places to find a doctor.\n\n**Practical Example**\n\nOne example of this can be seen with dentists. In many places, dentists need a license to start working. But, this can make there be fewer dentists in some places, making it harder for people to find a dentist.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn the end, while licenses for doctors are to protect people, they can also make things harder. By making there be fewer doctors and making it hard for new doctors to start working, licenses can make going to the doctor cost more and make it harder for people in some places to find a doctor. So, it is important to think carefully about the good and bad things about having licenses for doctors.\n\n**Glossary**\n\n- **License**: The special permission that the government gives to doctors.\n- **Hard for New Doctors**: When it is difficult for new doctors to start working.\n- **Fewer Doctors**: When there are not many doctors.\n\n**Self-Debate Discussion**\n\nDo you think that doctors should have licenses to protect people? Or do you think that licenses make it hard for doctors and make going to the doctor cost more?

He was right. In these discussion we typically forget that the medical profession has the oddest and strongest monopoly power in the private sector in the US. Those who are already doctors have ironclad control over who else gets to be a doctor. Meaning they have more control over competition than any other industry I know of. It doesn't take a rocket scientist, or a rock-star economist, to realize that limiting the supply of doctors might be why they make so much money, and why we pay so much money, for healthcare services..

By the end of this story, you will know how to share your toys and make your friends happy.\n\nSection 1: Sharing Toys\n\nSharing toys is a fun thing to do. You can share your toys by giving them to your friends to play with. Here's an example of how you can share your toys:\n\nAdam has two cars. He gives one car to Benjamin to play with.\n\nIn this story, Adam is sharing his toys with Benjamin. To share his toys, Adam gives one of his cars to Benjamin, and they both have fun playing with the cars.\n\nActivity: Think about how you can share your toys with your friends. Imagine you have three toys (let's say a ball, a teddy bear, and a doll). Think about how you can share these toys with your friends.\n\nSection 2: Why We Share Toys\n\nSometimes, we have more toys than we can play with. It's a good idea to share our toys with our friends so they can have fun too. Here's an example of how sharing toys can make everyone happy:\n\nDavid has a box of blocks. He shares his blocks with Ethan, and they build a castle together.\n\nWhen David shares his blocks with Ethan, they can build a bigger and better castle.

{"text": "Story: Learning About Sharing Things\n\nChapter 1: What is Sharing?\n\nSharing is a way to let our friends use our things. It's a good thing to do because it makes our friends happy. We remember each little change we make to our drawings, who did the change, and when it happened. This helps friends work together better, fix mistakes, and keep many copies of the same drawing.\n\n## Chapter 2: Why Do We Keep Copies of Our Drawings?\n\nThere are some reasons why friends keep copies of their drawings:\n\n1. Sharing: Many friends can draw on the same picture without messing up each other's work.\n2. Remembering: Keeping copies helps remember all the changes we made to the drawing, so friends can see who made which changes and when.\n3. Fixing: If something is not nice, friends can go back to an earlier drawing to make it better.\n4. Trying New Things: Friends can make new versions of the drawing to try new things without changing the main picture.\n5. Joining: When many friends draw on the same picture, their work needs to be joined together. Keeping copies makes this easier.\n\n## Chapter 3: How Keeping Copies Works\n\nKeeping copies saves all the changes we make to our drawings in a box. When a friend makes a change to the drawing, the box keeps a new \"copy\" that has all the changes. Each copy has a special name, usually a number or a time.\n\nFriends can then use words to work with the box. For example, they can \"take\" a copy of the drawing, make changes to it, and then \"give\" those changes to the box. The box will then remember all the changes we made to the drawing since the last copy.\n\n## Chapter 4: Words We Often Use\n\nHere are some words we often use when we keep copies:\n\n1. Box: The place where all the drawings are kept.\n2. New Version: A different way to draw within the box.\n3. Change: A little difference in the drawing.\n4. Copy: Another word for a change.\n5. Name: A special name for a specific change.\n6. Join: Putting together changes from two versions into one.\n7. Ask: Asking to join changes from one version into another.\n\n## Chapter 5: Choosing a Way to Keep Copies\n\nThere are many ways to keep copies, including ways like Git, SVN, and Mercurial. Each has good and bad points.\n\nGit is a popular choice because it is shared, meaning that every friend has a full box of drawings on their computer. This makes sharing easier, as friends can draw on the same picture without needing to talk with the main box.\n\nSVN, however, is a central system. This means that all changes are made directly to the main box. While this can make sharing more difficult, it can also be more safe, as there is only one place where changes are made.\n\nMercury is a tool, like the tool named G. It has some good things about it, like better mixing abilities, but not many people use it.\n\n## Word List\n\n- Home: The main place where all the work is kept.\n- Path: A different way of working within the home.\n- Change: A single fix to the work.\n- New Change: Another word for a change.\n- Name: A word for a specific change.\n- Mix: Putting together work from two paths into one.\n- Ask: Asking to mix work from one path into another.\n\n## End Words\n\nControl tools are important for any worker. They help workers to work together more easily, keep track of changes, and make sure that their work is always ready. By knowing the basics of control tools, workers can pick the right tool for their needs and work better.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 4070, "idx": 352805, "original text": "Q:\n\nWhat should be the \"trunk\" development, or release\n\nI have the unfortunate opportunity of source control via Borland's StarTeam.  It unfortunately does very few things well, and one supreme weakness is its view management.  I love SVN and come from an SVN mindset.  Our issue is post production release we are spending countless hours merging changes into a \"production support\" environment. \nPlease do not harass me this was not my doing, I inherited it and am trying to present a better way of managing the repository.  It is not an option to switch to a different SCM tool.  \nCurrent setup\n\nProduct.1.0 (TRUNK, current production code, and at this level are pending bug fixes)\n\nProduct.2.0(true trunk anything checked in gets tested, and then released next production cycle, a lot of changes occur in this view)\n\nMy proposal is going to be to swap them, have all development be done on the trunk (Production), tag on releases, and as needed create child views to represent production support bug fixes.  \n\nProduction\n\nProduction.2.0.SP.1 \n\nI can not find any documentation to support the above proposal so I am trying to get feedback on whether or not the change is a good idea and if there is anything you would recommend doing differently.\n\nA:\n\nI use an intermediate approach inspired by Henry Kniberg's article Version Control for Multiple Agile Teams. I'm quoting a small part below:\n\nThe big picture\nOK, now I've gone through a fairly detailed example of how to put this pattern to use. Now let's back out a bit and look at the big picture.\nIn the mainline model, a branch is called a codeline (in fact, branch is considered to be an implementation of a codeline). Sometimes these are called streams.\nA codeline's parent (i.e. the codeline that it originated from) is called its baseline. Mainline is the codeline that has no baseline.\nSo in our examples above we could conclude that:\n\nThe trunk is our mainline. It has no parent right?\nAll other codelines (release 1.0, team A work, team B work) have the trunk as baseline.\n\nHere's a more complex example:\n\n(source: infoq.com) \nThis picture tells us that:\n\nThe project X codeline was spawned\n  from the mainline. The project is now\n  complete, so the branch is closed. \nTeam A has an active work branch that\n  was spawned from the mainline.\nTeam A also has an ongoing spike that was\n  spawned from the work branch.\nThe release 2.3 branch is closed, since\n  2.3 is no longer in production and won't be maintained.\n\nEach codeline has a relative firmness\n  level with respect to its baseline,\n  i.e. each codeline is either more firm\n  or less firm (softer) than its\n  baseline.\n\nA firm codeline is stable,\n  thoroughly tested, changes seldom, and\n  is close to release.\nA soft codeline is unstable, barely tested,\n  changes often, and is far from\n  release.\n\nWhen drawing codelines, firm codelines\n  branch upwards and soft codelines\n  branch downwards. So looking at the\n  picture above, we can conclude that:\n\nRelease 2.3 is firmer than\n  mainline.\nTeam A work is softer\n  than mainline.\nTeam A spike is\n  softer than team A work.\n\nTo summarize:\n\nThe trunk is the DONE branch (always releasable)\nWork is done in work branches (one per team) that may be less stable than the trunk\nRelease branches are created based on the trunk at the time of the release.\n\nI warmly recommend reading the whole article.\n\nA:\n\nHere's my general advice for structuring build streams: \n+HEAD - master -> current development \n+ tags\n   + version1 \n   + version1.sp1 \n   + version1.sp2 \n   + version2\n+ branches\n   + version1.sp2.fixes <- at some point, this will get promoted to version1.sp3 \n   + version2.fixes <- at some point, this will get promoted to version2.sp1 \n   + version2.nix.feature1 <- this is your (nix's) private version2.feature branch \n   + master.nix.feature2  <- this is your (nix's) private new development feature branch.\n\nBasically, you NEVER commit directly to a .fixes or the master branch - only an integration process does that. \nAnyhow, pretty much any source control tool will support this model. \n\n", "hash": "de6a79832dcf147449978e8ec054f606e4f3f02da059dcfc16ee73a51f290a63"}
{"text": "Lesson Title: Let's Learn About Building Stuff\n\n### Part 1: What is Building Stuff?\nBuilding stuff is like playing and creating with blocks, but bigger! It's about making safe, useful, and pretty spaces that people can use. People have been building stuff for a very, very long time. It has changed a lot because of new ways of doing things and new tools we have.\n\n### Part 2: Different Kinds of Building Stuff\nWe can build different things like houses, shops, factories, and schools. Houses are places where people live. Shops are places where people buy things. Factories are places where things are made. Schools are places where children learn.\n\n### Part 3: How Do We Build Stuff?\nWhen we build stuff, we need to think about where to build it, how it should look, how to make it strong, and what things to put inside. Choosing the right place to build is important. We need to think about how to reach the place and what we can find there. The looks of our building, its shape, size, and what it's made of are also important. We need to make sure our building is strong and safe. The things we put inside should make the space pretty and useful.\n\n### Part 4: Why is Building Stuff Important?\nBuilding stuff is important because it makes our lives better. Good buildings can help us work better, stay healthy, and be safe. Buildings can also show what we think is important and can be a symbol of who we are.\n\n### Part 5: Jobs in Building Stuff\nThere are many jobs in building stuff. You can be a builder, a project boss, a building boss, a city planner, or an inside designer. Builders make buildings. Project bosses watch over how buildings are made. Building bosses make sure buildings are made safely and quickly. City planners think about how cities should grow. Inside designers choose things to put inside to make spaces useful and pretty.\n\n### Words to Know:\n- Building Stuff: Playing and creating with blocks, but bigger!\n- How to Build Stuff: Choosing where to build, designing the building, making it strong, and choosing what to put inside.\n- Jobs in Building Stuff: Builder, project boss, building boss, city planner, and inside designer.\n\nIn the End:\nBuilding stuff is fun! It's about being creative, knowing how things work, and solving problems. Whether you like designing buildings, watching over how they are built, or making places better for people, there's a job in building stuff for you. By learning about building stuff, you can change the world around you and do something that will be remembered.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 910, "idx": 324788, "original text": "Architecture Department Lecture: On Ters\u00e2ne: Architectural Episodes of the Golden Horn Arsenal Istanbul.

{"text": "Lesson: Let's Learn About Secret Writing\n\n### Chapter 1: What is Secret Writing?\nSecret writing is making messages that only special friends who know the secret can read. It is like a secret game we play to keep things like our diary entries, special notes, and treasure maps safe from others.\n\n### Chapter 2: Why is Secret Writing Important?\nSecret writing is important because it helps us keep our special things safe. Without secret writing, our special notes, treasure maps, and secret diary entries could be read by anyone. Secret writing makes sure that only our special friends can read them, and that our secrets stay secret.\n\n### Chapter 3: Types of Secret Writing\nThere are two main types of secret writing: same key and different key. Same key secret writing uses the same secret to write and read messages, while different key secret writing uses two different secrets - one to write and one to read. Different key secret writing is safer than same key secret writing because it is harder for someone to read the message without the correct secret.\n\n### Chapter 4: How does Secret Writing Work?\nSecret writing works by changing normal words into secret words using a secret and a plan. The plan changes the letters of the normal words into a mix-up of letters. The secret is a special code that is used to change the secret words back into normal words.\n\n### Chapter 5: Fun Examples\nOne fun example of secret writing is using a secret word to protect your toy box or secret diary. The secret word is a type of secret that is used to change your special things into something that only you can understand.

{"text": "Lesson: Introduction to Big Box of Blocks\n\n## Chapter 1: What is a Big Box of Blocks?\n\n### Section 1: What is a Big Box of Blocks?\n\nA Big Box of Blocks is a type of toy that does not need instructions and is designed to play with a large number of blocks. It is different from traditional puzzle toys, which need instructions and arrange blocks in a fixed pattern.\n\n### Section 2: Why Use a Big Box of Blocks?\n\nBig Boxes of Blocks are used when traditional puzzle toys cannot handle the number, variety, or speed of blocks being played. They are especially good for playing with different shapes, such as blocks of animals or blocks from toy cars. Big Boxes of Blocks are also good for sharing, meaning they can handle a large number of blocks by distributing it among multiple kids.\n\n### Section 3: Types of Big Boxes of Blocks\n\nThere are several types of Big Boxes of Blocks, including boxes based on documents, key-value blocks, column-based blocks, and graph blocks. Each type has its own fun and challenges, and is best suited for certain types of games.\n\n### Section 4: Examples of Big Boxes of Blocks\n\nSome popular examples of Big Boxes of Blocks include MB blocks, CA blocks, and RE blocks.\n\n## Chapter 2: How Does a Big Box of Blocks Work?\n\n### Section 1: Structure\n\nBig Boxes of Blocks typically use a master-slave structure, where one or more main blocks manage the game and secondary blocks handle building and playing operations. Some big boxes also use sharing, which means dividing the toys among many friends to play.\n\n### Part 2: Toy Shapes\n\nBig boxes usually have flexible shapes that allow to keep dolls, blocks, or columns of blocks. This makes them good for keeping different toys.\n\n### Part 3: Finding Toys\n\nBig boxes usually have a special way to find toys that matches the type of the box. For example, in a MO box, you use a way similar to looking for JO toys, while in a CA box, you use a way similar to looking for SQ toys.\n\n## Chapter 3: Using a Big Box\n\n### Part 1: Starting to Play\n\nTo start playing with a big box, you need to choose a box type and a special box. You also need to set up a play area and prepare the big box.\n\n### Part 2: Making a Play Box\n\nOnce you have prepared the big box, you need to make a play box. This usually means deciding the type of play box (e.g., doll-based or block-based) and giving a name and maybe a description.\n\n### Part 3: Putting Toys In\n\nTo put toys into a big box, you usually use a simple tool or a game language that matches the box's toy-finding way. For example, to put toys into a MO box, you use the 'put' command in the MO game.\n\n### Part 4: Finding Toys\n\nOnce you have put toys into the box, you can find them using the box's toy-finding way. For example, to find toys in a MO box, you use the 'find' command in the MO game.\n\n### Part 5: Changing Toys\n\nTo change toys in a big box, you usually use a change command in the box's toy-finding way. For example, to change toys in a MO box, you use the 'change' command in the MO game.\n\n### Part 6: Taking Toys Out\n\nTo take toys out from a big box, you usually use a take out command in the box's toy-finding way. For example, to take toys out in a MO box, you use the 'take out' command in the MO game.\n\n## Chapter 4: Good and Bad Things About Big Boxes\n\n### Good Things\n\n- Size: Big boxes can handle lots of toys by spreading them across many play areas.\n- Flexibility: Big boxes allow for the keeping of different toys, making them good for handling doll tea parties or sensor toys from smart devices.\n- Speed: Big boxes usually have faster play time than small boxes, making them good for quick games.\n\n### Bad Things\n\n- Difficulty: Big boxes need special knowledge to set up and keep neat, making them harder to use than small boxes.\n- Limited functions: Big boxes usually lack some of the features of small boxes, such as support for complex games and transactions.\n- Not the same for all: There is no same search language for different types of big storage boxes, making it hard to change from one big storage box to another.\n\n## End\n\nBig storage boxes are a helpful tool for dealing with lots of things, especially things without a set shape. By picking the right kind of big storage box and learning the right search language, you can quickly save, find, and change things.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 2752, "idx": 287098, "original text": "Q:\n\nWhy GO company's BigTable referred as a NoSQL database?\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nNotable production implementations\n  [of NoSQL databases] include GO company's\n  BigTable, Amazon's Dynamo and\n  Cassandra.\n\nBut GO company's BigTable does have some variant of SQL, called GQL. \nWhat am I missing?\n\nA:\n\nNoSQL is an umbrella term for all the databases that are different from 'the standard' SQL databases, such as MySQL, MI company SQL Server and PostgreSQL.\nThese 'standard' SQL databases are all relational databases, feature the SQL query language and adhere to the ACID properties. These properties basically boil down to consistency.\nA NoSQL database is different because it doesn't support one or more of these key features of the so-called 'SQL databases':\n\nConsistency\nRelational data\nSQL language\n\nMost of these features go hand in hand.\nConsistency\nConsistency is where most NoSQL databases differ from SQL databases. You can pull the plug from a SQL database and it will make sure your data is still consistent and uncorrupted. NoSQL databases tend to sacrifice this consistency for better scalability. GO company's Bigtable also does this.\nRelational data\nSQL databases revolve around normalized, relational data. The database ensures that these relations stay valid and consistent, no matter what you throw at it. NoSQL databases usually don't support relations, because they don't support the consistency to enforce these relations. Also, relational data is bad for performance when the data is distributed across several servers.\nAn exception are graph databases. These are considered NoSQL databases, but do feature relational data. In fact, that's what they're all about!\nSQL language\nThe SQL language was designed especially for relational databases, the so-called 'SQL databases'. Since most NoSQL databases are very different from relational databases, they don't have the need for SQL. Also, some NoSQL databases have features that simply cannot be expressed in SQL, thus requiring a different query language.\nLast, but not least, NoSQL is simply a buzzword. It basically means 'anything but the old and trusty MySQL server in the attic', which includes a lot of alternative storage mechanisms. Even a simple text file can be considered a NoSQL solution :)\n\nA:\n\nWhen people say \"NoSQL\" what they generally mean is \"non-relational\".  To the best of my knowledge BigTable does not feature primary / foreign keys, JOINs, or relational calculus of any type.\nThe fact that BigTable features a query syntax that includes the words \"SELECT\" and \"WHERE\" does not mean it adheres to the principles of relational databases.  It's more of a convenience, or a \"hook\", to make single-entity-type matches more familiar to programmers coming from relational databases.\n\n", "hash": "88063d5ddc1fa4770844ad548d27a5d43cd0e87d4420cf597f7aabff3632549a"}

He is one of the best throwers and catchers and he always does well.\n\nConclusion:\n\nTo wrap up, seeing a team's play and making good choices about which players to keep or let go from our pretend team needs us to really understand the team's fun numbers, each player's play, and how much they can help our team.

{"text": "Lesson Title: Learning about Saving and Spending\n\n### Overview\nSaving and spending is about watching over and taking care of our pretend money. It's about choosing the right things to buy and ways to save to reach our pretend money goals while not taking too many chances. In this story, we will learn about how to handle our money wisely. We will talk about how to share our money in different ways, how to keep our money safe, and how to check if our plan is working well. We will also talk about the people who help us manage our money and what they do.\n\n### Part 1: Sharing Our Money\n\n#### Chapter 1: Different Ways to Share\nSharing our money means we put our money in different places like buying things, saving, and keeping some in our piggy banks. This helps us be safe because if we lose money in one place, we still have money in other places.\n\n#### Chapter 2: Spreading Our Money\nSpreading our money means we buy different things or save in different places. This is helpful because if we lose money in one place, it will not hurt all our money.\n\n#### Chapter 3: Checking Our Money\nChecking our money means we look at how we shared our money and change it if needed. We might buy more of one thing or save more in one place.\n\n#### Chapter 4: Keeping Our Money Safe\nKeeping our money safe is very important. We need to make sure we don't lose too much money and try to grow our money if we can.\n\n#### Chapter 5: How Well Did We Do?\nWe need to check if our plan is working well. We look at how much money we have now, how safe it is, and other things to see if we are doing a good job.\n\n### Part 2: People Who Help Us\n\n#### Chapter 1: Who Are They?\nPeople who help us manage our money are like teachers. They help us make a good plan, choose what to buy or where to save, and check if our plan is working well.\n\n#### Chapter 2: What Do They Do?\nPeople who help us with our money do many things, such as:\n\n- Helping us make a good plan based on what we want, how much risk we can take, and what's happening around us.\n- Helping us decide what to buy or where to save.\n- Checking if our plan is working well and changing it if needed.\n- Talking with us often to tell us how our plan is doing and answer any questions we have.\n\n#### Chapter 3: How Much Do They Cost?\nPeople who help us with our money usually ask for a small amount of our money for their help. This money is used to help us manage our money and give us good advice.\n\n### Part 3: Let's Try It!\n\n#### Chapter 1: Let's Pretend!\nLet's pretend we have a big amount of money. We want to grow our money over time but also keep it safe. We decide to do this:\n\n- Most of our money is used to buy things.\n- Some of our money is saved.\n- A small part of our money is kept in our piggy banks.\n\nThis way, our money is spread in different places, keeping it safe while giving us chances to grow it.\n\n#### Topic 2: Real-World Story\nImagine that a friend, let's call him Adam, wants to save up his toy money. After thinking about various ideas, he decides to buy a big piggy bank. The piggy bank is known for holding a lot of coins, it's easy to keep, and it has a cool design. Based on these things, Adam decides to buy the piggy bank.\n\nBy thinking about how many coins it can hold, how easy it is to keep, and how cool it looks, Adam was able to decide where to put his toy money.\n\n### Words to Learn\n- Toy money: The pretend money that kids use to play.\n- Different toys: Having many types of toys like cars, dolls, and balls.\n- Sharing: Giving some of your toys to your friends to play with.\n- Being careful: Making sure your toys don't get lost or broken.\n- Playing well: Having fun with your toys and making sure they don't get lost or broken.\n- Toy keeper: A friend or a big brother or sister who helps you take care of your toys.\n- Lots of toys: Having many toys to play with.\n- Toy fee: The pretend money you need to buy a new toy.\n\n### Ending\nTaking care of toys is an important part of playing and having fun. By understanding how to play well, be careful, and share, kids can make smart choices about where to put their toy money. Also, by having help from a toy keeper like a big brother or sister, they can reach their fun goals while being careful with their toys.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 922, "idx": 277596, "original text": "Gareth Maher.

{"text": "Story: How to Look at a Ball Game\n\n**Start**\n\nIn this story, we will learn how to look at a ball game by looking at the game summary and finding key numbers. We will look at the game between the HO team and the DA team from a long time ago, where William was tagged 12 times.\n\n**Part 1: Understanding the Game Summary**\n\nThe game summary is a short story of the game's happenings that includes simple numbers such as the number of points made, the time of the game, and the number of times the team moved forward. It also includes more detailed information such as the number of times a player was stopped, balls were taken away, and the player with the ball was tagged.\n\n**Part 2: Looking at the Defense**\n\nIn the game between the HO team and the DA team, the DA team's defense did a great job, tagging William 12 times. This is the most times a single player has been tagged in a game. The DA team's defense also had two players with two tags each: Adam, Ryan, and Thomas.\n\n**Part 3: Looking at the Offense**\n\nOn the other side, the HO team's offense had a hard time against the DA team's defense. The HO team only made 10 points, which is less than their average of 21 points per game. The HO team also only moved forward 14 times, which is fewer than their average of 20 times per game.\n\n**Part 4: The End**\n\nIn the end, the game between the HO team and the DA team from a long time ago was a game of defense. The DA team's defense did a great job, tagging William 12 times, which is still a record today. The HO team's offense had a hard time against the DA team's defense, making only 10 points and moving forward fewer times than their average. By looking at the game summary and finding key numbers, we can understand the game better and see how well the DA team's defense did.\n\n**Words to Know**\n\n- Game summary: a short story of the game's happenings that includes simple numbers such as the number of points made, the time of the game, and the number of times the team moved forward.\n- Stop: the act of stopping a player with the ball.\n- Take away: when a ball is caught by a player on the other team before it reaches who it was thrown to.\n- Tag: the act of tagging a player with the ball before he throws the ball.\n\n**Let's Talk**\n\n- Why do you think the DA team's defense did so well in this game?\n- What made the HO team's offense have a hard time?\n- How does looking at a game summary help us understand a ball game better?", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 539, "idx": 420392, "original text": "By Jonah Sharf.

{"text": "Lesson: Understanding How Little Bugs Divide\n\nBeginning:\nDividing is a very important process in the life of all living things, including little bugs. In this lesson, we will learn about how little bugs divide and how things that damage DNA can stop this. We will also talk about the role of breaking down and enzymes in dividing.\n\nPart 1: Little Bugs Dividing\n\nTopic 1: Wall Making\nThe wall is a thin layer that separates two nearby little bugs when they divide. It is made by an enzyme. This enzyme makes the wall by connecting the ends of two protein chains.\n\nTopic 2: SOS Help\nThe SOS help is a way that little bugs fix their DNA when it gets damaged. This is about tiny things called cells stopping their growth and making too many helpers to fix mistakes. These helpers work together to fix the mistakes in the cells.\n\nChapter 2: Mistakes and Stopping Growing\n\nTopic 3: Sunlight\nSunlight can hurt tiny things called cells. It can make mistakes in their code. This makes the cells look weird and stop them from growing. But the cells have ways to fix these mistakes, like helpers that can put things back to normal.\n\nTopic 4: Strong Medicine\nSome medicines can stop cells from growing. They do this by stopping a helper in the cell from doing its job. This helper usually helps the cell grow, but the medicine stops it from working.\n\nChapter 3: Breaking Down and Helpers in Growing\n\nTopic 5: Breaking Down\nBreaking down is when big things get broken into little things. This is important for cells to grow. For example, some helpers can turn on or off other helpers, depending on when the cell needs to grow.\n\nTopic 6: Helpers in Growing\nThere are many helpers that help cells to grow, like the one that gets stopped by medicine. These helpers work together to make sure the cell grows right and keeps its code safe.\n\nEnding:\nUnderstanding how cells grow and what stops them is important for making new medicine and understanding how humans grow. By studying breaking down and the helpers in growing, we can learn more about how cells grow in tiny things and other living things.\n\nWords to Know:\n- Cell: a tiny thing that makes up all living things.\n- Helper: something that helps the cell grow or fix mistakes.\n- Sunlight: light from the sun that can hurt cells.\n- Medicine: something that can stop cells from growing by stopping a helper.\n- Breaking down food: the process of making big food pieces into smaller ones.\n- Helper: something that makes things happen faster in living things.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 2436, "idx": 133970, "original text": "The long term objectives of this research are to understand the molecular basis of cell division (septum formation) and its inhibition by DNA-damaging agents (ultraviolet light, nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin) that induce a distress response (the SOS response) in Escherichia coli. Other closely related objectives are to understand the details of intracellular protein breakdown and overproduction of capsular polysaccharide. Cell division, ultraviolet radiation, and proteolysis studies in bacteria may provide basic answers that are applicable to solving human cancer which involves the heritable loss of control of cell division. Use of antibiotics that interfere with cell division in these studies (penicillins, cephalosporins) may also provide important basic information useful in designing new antibiotics. Capsular polysaccharides are important determinants of virulence for a number of bacteria that are pathogenic for humans. The specific aims are: 1. Study in vivo proteolysis and enzymes of capsular polysaccharide synthesis regulated by the CapR (Lon) ATP hydrolysis-dependent protease. This will be done by recloning the capR gene so that it is under lac operator control. The alteration of enzymes of capsular polysaccharide synthesis and degradation or synthesis of proteins after switching the CapR ATP hydrolysis-dependent protease on or off will be determined by measuring the enzymes spectrophotometrically and the polypeptides by two dimensional gels with autoradiography. Polypeptides detected as unstable will be tested directly using the pure CapR ATP hydrolysis dependent protease. 2. Clone the equivalent of the E. coli K-12 1on (capR) gene from Salmonella, Shigella and Caulobacter and purify and measure the enzymatic and DNA binding activities of the corresponding proteins by techniques previously developed. 3. Identify, localize, purify and determine the activity of proteins specified by genes involved in cell division. The genes known as ftsA, ftsQ, sulB (ftsZ, sfiB), and sulA (sfiA) and ftsI (pbp3, sep) are those being studied. Recloning, membrane fractionation and protein purification techniques will be applied. 4. Purify the major outer membrane-localized Ompt protein and its precursor and determine the N-terminal amino acid sequence of both. Determine the proteolytic specificity of OmpT protein which is thought to be a trypsin-like enzyme that processes pro-OmpT protein to OmpT protein.", "hash": "be811c33dca3124dd1c2b40e4e69186a6e49e8a9bd02e2781d05e941316cb5be"}

They had been traveling and I knew they would need dinner that night and lunch for work the next day. I was reluctant to wrap up these sandwiches not knowing how they would fare the next day. Let me tell you\u2026 I guess they were A-ok because I got not one but two phone calls from both of my parents raving about this sandwich. They love their BLT\u2019s and I guess I\u2019ve introduced them to the next level of BLT\u2019s.

{"text": "LESSON: \nIntroduction:\nIn this class, we will talk about why it's important to think carefully and use this kind of thinking to solve problems in the real world. We will learn what careful thinking means, why it's good, and how to use it in different situations.\nPart 1: What is Careful Thinking?\nCareful thinking is when we think really hard about something before we make a decision. It means we don't just believe everything we hear. We ask questions, look at proof, and think about other ways to explain things.\nWhy is Careful Thinking Important?\nCareful thinking is important because it helps us make good choices, solve hard problems, and talk better. It also lets us think of new ideas on our own, which is very important in our world today.\nHow Can We Get Better at Careful Thinking?\nTo get better at careful thinking, we need to listen well, ask good questions, and decide if the things we read or hear are true. We should also listen to different people's ideas and think about our own ideas.\nPart 2: Using Careful Thinking to Solve Real World Problems\nExample 1: Looking at What Leaders Say\nLeaders often say things to make people like them. By using careful thinking, we can look at what they say and decide if it's true. For example, we can look at the proof they give, think about other ways to explain things, and try to understand why they say what they say.\nExample 2: Fixing Problems at Work\nIn the work world, careful thinking is very important for making good choices. For example, a business might have a problem like not selling a lot of things. By using careful thinking, the boss can look at what customers say, look at what's popular, and think of ways to fix the problem.\nExample 3: Looking at What Scientists Do\nScientists do experiments to learn new things. By using careful thinking, we can decide if what they say is true and if the way they did their experiment was good. For example, we can look at how many times they did the experiment, if the results are important, and if they were fair in their experiment.\nPart 3: Talking to Ourselves\nTalking to ourselves is a good way to get better at careful thinking. By having a debate with ourselves, we can think about our own ideas and listen to different ideas. For example, we can ask ourselves if our ideas are based on proof or just what we like.\nConclusion:\nCareful thinking is a very important skill that helps us make good choices, solve hard problems, and talk better. By using careful thinking in different situations, we can look at arguments, look at proof, and think of new ways to solve real world problems.\nWords to Know:\n- Listening Well: Paying attention to the person talking and understanding what they say.\n- Good Questions: Asking questions that need more than a yes or no answer.\n- Trustworthiness: When something or someone can be trusted or believed.\n- Different Ways to Explain Things: Other ways that could explain something.\n- Reasons: Why someone does something.\n- Proof: Facts or things that show something is true.\n- Statistical Significance: How likely it is that the results of a study are true.\n- Bias: When someone likes one thing more than another, and it changes how they act.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 926, "idx": 262360, "original text": "DESCRIPTION.

{"text": "Lesson: Changing Nature and What it Means\n\n## Section 1: Start\nChanging nature is when we change how plants or animals grow to make them better. People have been doing this for a long time to make crops grow better, make new kinds of plants or animals, and make sick people better. But, we need to think about if it's fair and what could happen if we start making babies the way we want.\n\n## Section 2: What is Changing Nature?\nChanging nature is when we change how plants or animals grow to make them better. We can do this in different ways like cutting and pasting parts of a plant or animal, making small changes, or using medicine. We change nature to make a plant or animal look better, do better, or be healthier.\n\n## Section 3: How do We Use Changing Nature?\nWe use changing nature for many things:\n\n1. Farming: We change crops to make them not get sick, not need a lot of water, and not be eaten by bugs. This can make us have more food.\n\n2. Medicine: We use changing nature to make sick people better, like if they have a bad cold or a problem with their blood. We also use it to make medicine.\n\n3. Learning: We use changing nature to learn more about plants and animals and how they work.\n\n4. Helping the Earth: We change plants and animals to help them deal with things like changes in weather or dirty air.\n\n## Section 4: What Could Happen Because of Changing Nature?\nChanging nature can be good, but it also makes us think about if it's fair and what could happen if we start making babies the way we want. Some things we need to think about are:\n\n1. Not fair: If some moms and dads can pick how their baby will be like, others who can't do that might not be happy.\n\n2. Things we didn't plan: Changing nature can make things happen that we didn't want to happen. Like, some bugs that are good might get hurt by the changes we made to plants.\n\n3. Making babies the way we want: If moms and dads can make their baby be tall, smart, or good at sports, people might start thinking that's more important than being a good person.\n\n## Section 5: Questions to Think About\n1. Should we use changing nature to make babies the way we want, even if it's not to make them healthier? Why or why not?\n\n2. What do you think will happen in the future because of changing nature?\n\n3. What are good things and bad things that could happen because of changing nature?\n\n## Words to Know\n- Changing nature: When we change how plants or animals grow to make them better.\n- Cutting and pasting parts of a plant or animal: A way to change nature by moving a part from one plant or animal to another.\n- Making small changes: A way to change nature by making little changes to a plant or animal while it's still alive.\n- Changing our bodies: Sometimes, doctors can help sick people by changing their body's tiny parts. This can stop them from being sick.\n\n## What We Learned\nChanging our bodies can do good things. But, we need to think carefully. It's not fair if some people can change their bodies and others can't. It's not good if we make babies that are too perfect. We need to understand how changing our bodies works and think about what might happen. Then, we can make sure we use this in a way that is fair for everyone.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 830, "idx": 34061, "original text": "Scientists modify chickens to lay cancer-fighting eggs. - The eggs contain an antiviral protein called human interferon beta.. - This protein is known to combat some forms of cancer and other conditions.. - The unusual technique could one day provide cheaper and more effective treatments..

{"text": "Lesson: Introduction to Making Things Easier\n\n**Introduction**\n\nMaking things easier is a helpful tool that lets businesses do tasks like finding new friends, helping customers, and guessing what they might sell next. In this lesson, we will learn about the basics of making things easier, including its main parts and how they work together to make business jobs easier.\n\n**Main Parts**\n\nThe main parts of making things easier are helpers, rules, and steps. \n\n- **Helpers**: Helpers are things that do a job when something special happens. For example, a helper can be made to send a message when a new friend is found.\n- **Rules**: Rules are things that do a job when certain things are true. For example, a rule can be made to give a job to a helper when a new friend is found.\n- **Steps**: Steps are things that let users make their own tools and use them with making things easier. For example, a step can be made to automatically update a friend's status when a new team is made.\n\n**How They Work Together**\n\nHelpers, rules, and steps work together to do many jobs in making things easier. When a new team is made, a helper does its job, which then updates the friend's status using a rule. Finally, a step is done to send a message to the helper given the job.\n\n**Real Examples**\n\nLet's think about a time when a new friend is found. When the friend is found, a helper does its job, which checks if the friend's source is from a special place. If the friend's source is from the special place, a gift is given to the friend. Also, a rule does its job to give the friend to a helper and update the friend's status to \"Ready\". Finally, a step is done to send a message to the helper given the friend, telling them about the new friend and the gift given.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn the end, making things easier is a helpful tool that can help businesses make their jobs easier and get better. By understanding the main parts of making things easier and how they work together, businesses can make their own tools that do many jobs, like finding new friends, helping customers, and guessing what they might sell next.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 538, "idx": 200157, "original text": "activity has been created..

We will understand what fairness means and why it's important for everyone, no matter who they are or how much money they have.\n\n**Main Topic**\n\n1. What is Fairness?\n\nFairness means that all people can get help when they need it, no matter who they are or where they come from. It's like a special rule that says everyone should be able to get help.\n\n2. Why is Fairness Important?\n\nFairness is important because it makes sure that everyone has the same chance to fix problems, stand up for themselves, and take part in making decisions. Without fairness, some people might not be able to protect themselves or fix wrong things that happen to them.\n\n3. How can I Get Help?\n\nThere are many ways to get help, like asking a grown-up, using helping services, or speaking up for yourself. It's important to know how to get help before you do anything.\n\n4. What Makes Getting Help Hard?\n\nSometimes, getting help can be hard because there might not be enough resources, people might not understand each other, or they might not know how to get help. These things can make it hard for people to get the help they need.\n\n**Sub-Topics**\n\n5. The Role of Helping Services\n\nHelping services are very important for making sure people can get help if they can't do it on their own. These services give free or cheap help to people who need it.\n\n6. Helping Yourself\n\nThere are things you can do to help yourself, like reading books or using guides.

{"text": "Lesson: Sharing and Keeping Things to Ourselves\n\nIntroduction:\n\nIn this lesson, we will learn about sharing and keeping things to ourselves in the world of toys. We will talk about the differences between shared and kept toys and the use of the Toy Sharing Rule (TSR).\n\nObjectives:\n\nBy the end of this lesson, kids will be able to:\n\n- Tell what shared and kept toys are\n- Show the differences between shared and kept toys\n- Explain the role of TSR in toy sharing\n\nPart 1: Shared and Kept Toys\n\nMeanings:\n\n- Shared toy: A toy that is given by a toy keeper and can be played with by anyone.\n- Kept toy: A toy that is there for anyone to play with but can only be played with at home and cannot be taken to a friend's house.\n\nDifferences:\n\n- Shared toys are given by a toy keeper, while kept toys are there for anyone to play with.\n- Shared toys can be played with by anyone, while kept toys can only be played with at home.\n- Kept toys cannot be taken to a friend's house, while shared toys can be taken anywhere.\n\nPart 2: Toy Sharing Rule (TSR)\n\nMeaning:\n\n- TSR: A rule used in toy sharing to decide which toy goes to which friend.\n\nRole:\n\n- TSR is used to allow many toys at home to be played with by friends without having to give each friend a unique shared toy.\n- TSR works by matching the home toys of friends to a single shared toy.\n- When a friend at home sends a toy to another friend's house, the TSR rule changes the toy to appear as if it came from the shared toy.\n\nExample:\n\nImagine a home with four toys: a teddy bear, a toy phone, a toy tablet, and a toy TV. Each toy is a unique kept toy. The toy box acts as a TSR device, matching each toy's home toy to the single shared toy given to the toy box.\n\nWhen the teddy bear is sent to a friend's house, the toy box changes the teddy bear to appear as if it came from the shared toy. This allows all four toys to be played with by friends without having to give each friend a unique shared toy.\n\nPart 3: Practice Questions\n\n1. What is the difference between shared and kept toys?\n2. What is the role of TSR in toy sharing?\n3. How does TSR work?\n\nAnswers:\n\n1. Shared toys are given by a toy keeper and can be played with by anyone, while kept toys are there for anyone to play with but can only be played with at home and cannot be taken to a friend's house.\n2. TSR is used to allow many toys at home to be played with by friends without having to give each friend a unique shared toy.\n3. In simple words, NAT helps different gadgets in a home to use one common internet connection. When a gadget from home sends a message to the internet, the NAT changes the message to look like it's coming from the common internet connection.\n\nTo sum up:\n\nIn this lesson, we learned about common and special internet addresses. We found out what makes them different and how NAT helps us use the internet. By knowing these things, we can understand how internet connections work and how to solve problems with them.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 6721, "idx": 218157, "original text": "Public and private addressing\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts\n\nIP addresses come in two forms: public addresses, which are assigned by a central network authority and may be used to reach systems located across the Internet and private addresses, which are available for anyone\u2019s use but may only be used on local networks and do not work across the Internet. In this video, learn the differences between public and private IP addresses and the use of Network Address Translation, or NAT.\n\n- As we've discussed throughout this course,IP addresses uniquely identifysystems on a network.TCPIP-compatible devices use these addressesto correctly route packets across networks,but how are these addresses assigned?IP addresses come in two forms:public addresses, which are assignedby a central network authority andmay be used to reach systems locatedacross the internet, and private addresses,which are available for anyone's use,but may only be used on local networksand will not work across the internet.\n\nLet's begin by discussing public IP addresses.These addresses are centrally managedby a group known as the Internet Corporationfor Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN.ICANN breaks addresses up into blocks,and gives them out to regional authoritiesin different countries for distribution.These regional authorities eachtake responsibility for a geographicportion of the world.For example, the American Registryfor Internet Numbers, or ARIN,governs the distribution of IP addressesin the United States and Canada.\n\nOne of the major issues with IP addressesis that they are a scarce resource,especially when it comes to the traditionaldotted quad IPv4 addresses.There are no large blocks of IPv4 addressesavailable for assignment today,and the only way to get thesepublic IP addresses is by purchasingor renting them from other organizations,such as internet service providers.In the early days of networking,many organizations would simply obtaina large block of public IP addressesand use them on all of their systems.\n\nFor example, if an organization ownedthe 8.1.0.0 network, they might have justfreely handed out those addresseson their own networks.The scarcity of IP addresses,combined with security concerns,makes this impractical today.Why are these addresses so scarce?With the dotted quad notation of IPv4,there are only 4.3 billion possible IP addresses.While this may sound like a lot,CISCO estimates that there are currentlyaround seven and a half billionmobile devices alone in the world today.\n\nThat count doesn't even include servers,desktop computers, network appliances,or any non-mobile devices.There simply aren't enough possible addressesto assign every device in the worlda unique public IP address.The solution to this dilemma is the useof private IP address ranges.When ICANN's predecessor organizationsdivided up the original IP address space,they reserved three different address rangesfor use on private networks.These ranges are the ten-network,from 10.0.0.1 to 10.255.255.255.\n\nAnother is the portion of the 172 network,from 172.16.0.1to 172.31.255.255.And the last is the 192.168 network,from 192.168.0.1to 192.168.255.255.These ranges are called private IP addressesand anyone can use them on their local networks.The only catch is that they are reservedfor use on private networks and can not be usedfor routing traffic across the internet.\n\nToday, organizations typically use a balanceof public and private IP addresses.They use private addresses broadlywithin their private networks,assigning them to all of their internal systems.They then use a small number ofpublic IP addresses for systemsthat require public access.In the case of this network that formerly usedpublic addresses from the 8.1 range,administrators might instead assignprivate addresses from the 192.168 range.\n\nYou might have noticed one problemwith this approach.Systems that have private IP addressescannot communicate on the internetusing those addresses because theyare not internet-routable.Thousands of organizations around the worlduse those same private addresseson their own internal networks,so remote systems would have no way of tellingwhere reply traffic should actually go.The solution to this is a technologyknown as Network Address Translation, or NAT.Routers and firewalls perform NAT translationat the border of a network.\n\nWhen a system with a private IP address,such as this laptop with private address192.168.1.1,wants to communicate on the internet,the NAT device lends the systema public IP address temporarilyfor use during that communication.It then records the public and privateIP address translation in a table,and when a reply comes in for that public address,the NAT device looks up the correspondingprivate address in the table,and then routes the packet to thecorrect system on the private network.\n\nNAT does introduce new concernsfor security professionals.It does bring the privacy benefitof hiding IP addresses from the public internet,and limiting direct access to systems,but it also makes it difficultto correlate activity on a public IP addressback to the true originator.For this reason, most organizationsmaintain logs of their NAT translationsthat allow them to determine whowas using a particular public IP addressat any given time.NAT is a very useful technology,but it is somewhat limited becauseit requires a public IP addressfor every system on the networkthat needs to communicate on the internet.\n\nSince most organizations have a limitedpool of public addresses, they can quicklyrun into a situation where that poolis exhausted and no new systemscan communicate on the internet.Port Address Translation, or PAT,solves this problem by allowing multiple systemsto share the same public address.Instead of recording translationsbetween IP addresses, PAT assigns each connectiona different port on a public IP address.This way, many different systemscan share the same public IP addressat any point in time.\n\nResume Transcript Auto-Scroll\n\nAuthor\n\nReleased\n\n4/4/2018\n\nThe Certified Information System

{"text": "Title: Introduction to Strengthening Syrup\n\n### Section 1: What is Strengthening Syrup?\nStrengthening syrup is a special juice that can help you become stronger. It helps your muscles grow, makes you stronger, and helps you do better in physical activities. People who do sports or want to do better in physical activities often use it.\n\n### Section 2: How does Strengthening Syrup Work?\nStrengthening syrup works by connecting to special parts of your muscles. Once connected, the syrup tells the muscles to make more protein, which helps muscles grow. This process is like building a house, where more bricks mean a bigger house. The extra protein helps the body to make more muscle parts, leading to stronger and bigger muscles.\n\n### Section 3: Types of Strengthening Syrup\nThere are different types of strengthening syrup available. Some of the most common types include:\n\n1. Energy Syrup: This is the most commonly used and is often used as a base for other syrups.\n2. Growth Syrup: This syrup is known for helping muscles grow and become strong without causing bloating.\n3. Speed Syrup: Speed syrup works fast and is known for making you stronger and leaner.\n4. Power Syrup: Power syrup is a strong type that helps muscles grow and become stronger.\n\n### Section 4: Benefits of Using Strengthening Syrup\nUsing strengthening syrup can help in several ways, including:\n\n1. Bigger muscles: It can help people build more muscle mass, leading to increased strength.\n2. More strength: These syrups can help increase overall strength, allowing for better performance in sports and physical activities.\n3. Faster recovery: Strengthening syrup can help improve rest time between activities, allowing for more frequent and intense training sessions.\n4. Eating more: Some kids say they feel hungrier when taking these strong medicines, which can be good when trying to eat more food to help their body grow stronger.\n5. Feeling better: Many kids say they feel happier and have more energy when taking these strong medicines, which can help them focus and try harder when playing games.\n\n### Chapter 5: The Bad Things That Can Happen When Using Strong Medicine\nWhile strong medicine can help some kids get stronger and play better, bad things can also happen. Some of the bad things are:\n\n1. Tummy troubles: Using strong medicine for a long time can hurt your tummy, which can sometimes last forever.\n2. Heart issues: These strong medicines can make your heart beat too fast or slow, which is not good.\n3. Feeling funny: Using these strong medicines can make your body feel funny and weird. For example, boys may feel like they are growing boobies, which is not normal.\n4. Needing it too much: Using strong medicine for a long time can make you feel like you always need it.\n5. Getting in trouble: Using these strong medicines is not allowed in many places without a doctor's note, which can get you in trouble if you are caught using them.\n\n### Words to Learn\n- Power button: A part inside our body that can turn on our boy or girl power.\n- Strong medicine: Medicine that can make your body grow stronger and play better.\n- Muscle: A part of our body that helps us move and stand tall.\n- Building blocks: How our body makes stuff it needs.\n- Boy power: Something that boys have that makes them grow into big boys.\n\n### The End\nIn the end, strong medicine can help some kids grow stronger and play better. It works by pressing the power button in our muscles and telling them to make more building blocks, which makes muscles grow. Kids use these medicines to become better at games and reach their dreams. But, bad things can also happen, like tummy troubles, heart issues, and feeling funny. It is important to think about the good and the bad before deciding to use strong medicine.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 981, "idx": 404488, "original text": "Oils.

{"text": "Lesson: How to Look More Awake Even When You Haven't Slept Enough\n\nIntroduction:\nIn our busy world today, getting enough sleep can sometimes be tough. But looking awake is important for school and meeting friends. In this lesson, we will learn seven tricks that can help us look more awake even when we haven't slept enough.\n\nSection 1: Change What You Eat\n\nThe first trick is to change what you eat. According to Dr. Samuel, eating more foods with omega and greens can help make your skin look better from the inside out. This means that by eating more walnuts, beans, and small fish, as well as other foods that are good for you, you can make your skin look better.\n\nQuestions:\n- What are some other foods with omega that can help our skin?\n- Why is it better to drink more water instead of coffee?\n- How does eating greens help our skin?\n\nSection 2: Don't Use Too Much Makeup\n\nThe second trick is to not use too much makeup. Many people put on too much makeup, thinking that it will hide their tired eyes. But this can actually make them look worse. Instead, Sheriff says to use makeup that is the same color as your skin and to use it only a little bit.\n\nQuestions:\n- What is the best way to put makeup under the eyes?\n- How can we find the right color of makeup for our skin?\n- What are some other makeup tricks for hiding tired eyes?\n\nSection 3: Learn How to Use Color Right\n\nThe third trick is to learn how to use color right. Using color can be hard, but it's important for making your face look perfect. To do this, you need to know what colors work best for your skin. For example, if you have redness or dark circles, you can use a green color, while those with yellow skin can use a peach color.\n\nQuestions:\n- What are some other colors that can help with different skin problems?\n- How can we blend colors into our skin?\n- What are some other makeup tricks for making a natural-looking glow?\n\nConclusion:\nBy using these tricks every day, we can look more awake, even when we haven't slept enough. Remember to change what you eat, use makeup only a little bit, and use color right to get the best results.\n\nGlossary:\n- Foods with omega: Foods that have a lot of omega-3, like walnuts, beans, and small fish.\n- Greens: Green vegetables, like spinach, kale, and broccoli.\n- Makeup: A thing we use to hide spots, dark circles, and other things we don't like.\n- Color corrector: A makeup thing used to help with skin problems, like redness or darkness.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 3553, "idx": 206908, "original text": "Read on for seven hacks that\u2019ll help you look fresher, or better, like you\u2019ve had a full eight hours of sleep\u2014 even when you haven\u2019t.\n\nSwitch up your diet In many cases, skin around the eyes is stressed internally, making it appear more exhausted externally. \u201cDrink less coffee and much more water,\u201d says Soleimani. \u201cAlso, be sure to eat lots of omega-rich foods [for example, walnuts, navy beans, and anchovies] and greens.\u201d These types of nutrients help increase cell turnover and treat your skin from the inside out.\n\nDon\u2019t go overboard with concealers When it comes to camouflaging the look of tired eyes, less is more. Packing on concealer will only make the appearance more pronounced, especially if you are using a concealer or color corrector that\u2019s too light for your skin tone. \u201cPeople commonly make the mistake of applying concealer that\u2019s too light, thinking it will lift tired-looking eyes,\u201d says Sheriff. \u201cInstead, it looks startling and gives an almost vampire-like look where you end up looking sick.\u201d\n\nLearn how to color correct correctlyColor correcting under or around the eye area can be tricky, but it doesn\u2019t have to be if you know which shades work best for your complexion. \u201cFair skin tones can use a light peach corrector. Medium skin tones can opt for a true salmon shade, and deeper skin tones should try using orangy red correctors,\u201d says Scibelli. \u201cFollowing this technique when looking to color-correct references back to the color wheel. Oranges and reds will counter act purples and blues.\u201d\n\nAccentuate your eyelashes \u201cI find a good eyelash curler to be the best trick to make the eyes look open and awake,\u201d says Ingeborg. When it comes to eyes, we get so caught up on things like puffiness, crow\u2019s-feet, and dark circles that we often forget we can always draw attention away by playing up the eyelashes. Ingeborg also emphasizes after curling your lashes to use a mascara with lots of volume. Try It Cosmetics Superhero Mascara. It will give you a plumped-up baby-doll look, and it\u2019s also formulated with biotin to nourish your lashes.\n\nTap, tap, tap on your cosmetics If you have been rubbing products on your eye area, you are applying them the wrong way. Experts agree that you should use a soft tapping motion, as rubbing will only aggravate the skin around eyes. When it comes to makeup, Scibelli believes, \u201cthe patting motion will keep the product/concealer in place to deliver maximum coverage.\u201d Sheriff also adds: \u201cTapping the product into the eye area really marries the product to the skin naturally because the skin has oils in it, which break down the product much better.\u201d\n\nSleep face-up Some nights you are in a deep slumber and can\u2019t help it, but if you want to avoid having a jacked-up eye situation in the morning, try your best not to sleep on your face. Scibelli explains, \u201cSleeping on your face decreases oxygen and circulation to your eye area.\u201d Alternatively, you can also protect your smize while you snooze with a Slip Sleep Mask. The silk texture is comfortable to wear and will keep you from burying your face in your pillow while catching some z\u2019s.\n\nAvoid dark eyeshadows Steer clear of eyeshadows that are too dark (blues, blacks, deep grays, etc.) if you are having any issues around the eye area, especially dark circles. Go for a brighter neutral shade to help perk up the look of your lids. \u201cDefinitely stay away from anything with pink or blue undertones,\u201d says Soleimani. \u201cOpt for warmer tans, browns, and golds.\u201d", "hash": "bf2a3da523734a07758940747dafaf3ee7666ebefbf277d12ec2490dba55932f"}

{"text": "Lesson: Learning about Cleaning Tools\n\n## Section 1: Simple Ideas\n\nIn this lesson, we will learn about the tools we use to clean streets and pipes. These tools help keep our towns tidy and safe.\n\n**Question:** What are cleaning tools?\n\n**Answer:** Cleaning tools are things we use to clean and fix streets and pipes. These tools are important for keeping our towns tidy and safe.\n\n**Question:** Why do we need to keep our streets and pipes clean?\n\n**Answer:** Keeping our streets and pipes clean is important because they help us move from one place to another safely. If we don't keep them clean, our streets can become unsafe and hard to move on, and our pipes can get blocked and cause water to overflow.\n\n**Question:** What kinds of cleaning tools are there?\n\n**Answer:** There are many different kinds of cleaning tools, like trucks, diggers, and cranes. Each tool has its own special parts and abilities that make it useful for certain jobs.\n\n## Section 2: Real Life Examples\n\nNow that we understand the simple ideas, let's look at some real-life examples of how we use cleaning tools.\n\n**Example:** A town gets a lot of rain, causing the pipes to get blocked and overflow. The town leaders decide to use a pipe cleaning machine to remove the blockage and make the water flow normally again.\n\n**Example:** A street in a busy town needs fixing after a big storm. The town leaders use a street cleaning truck with a big scoop and other parts to remove the blockage and fix the broken parts.\n\n## Section 3: Fun Debates\n\nLet's have a fun debate to understand more about cleaning tools.\n\n**Debate:** Should towns spend more money on cleaning tools?\n\n**Argument for:** Yes, towns should spend more money on cleaning tools because they are important for keeping our towns tidy and safe. Proper cleaning of our streets and pipes reduces the chance of accidents and overflows, and makes sure that our ways of moving run smoothly.\n\n**Argument against:** No, towns should not spend more money on cleaning tools because they can cost a lot and may not always be needed. Some problems can be fixed with simple solutions like sweeping or washing, and other issues may not happen if people simply take better care of their places.\n\n## Easy Words\n\n- **Pipes:** A system of tubes that carries dirty water away from houses and shops.\n- **Street:** A flat path that provides a way for cars and people to move from one place to another.\n- **Cleaning:** The process of keeping something in good shape by doing regular checks, fixes, or cleaning.\n- **Stuff we use:** Things we use to do a job or work.\n\n## End\n\nAt the end, things we use for cleaning and fixing roads are very important for keeping our towns clean and safe. By knowing the simple stuff about these things and what they do in our everyday life, we can see why they are important and try to keep them working well. By using new things and good ideas, we can make sure our ways to go places keep working well and fast.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 522, "idx": 237597, "original text": "Sewer and Road Maintenance Equipment Sales, Parts, and Services the latest technology, the newest equipment, and the best ideas.

{"text": "Lesson: How to Read and Look at Picture Books\n\nBeginning:\nReading picture books can be a fun and interesting thing to do. However, to really enjoy and look at them, you need to know how to read and understand the different parts that make a picture book. In this lesson, we will learn the basics of picture book reading and looking.\n\nPart 1: Understanding the Parts of a Picture Book\n\nA picture book usually has several pages, each with a series of pictures. Each picture usually shows a single moment, and together, they tell a story. Here are some common parts you will see when reading a picture book:\n\n- Pictures: These are the individual images that make up a picture book page. They have drawings and talking that help tell the story.\n- Talking Bubbles: These are the boxes that have the characters' talking. They usually have a tail that points to the character talking.\n- Boxes: These are the boxes that have story telling or descriptions of what is happening. They are usually found outside the pictures and give more details or information.\n- Sound Words: These are the words or symbols that show sounds in the picture book. They are usually placed in talking bubbles but can also be separate.\n\nPart 2: Looking at the Story and Characters\n\nOnce you understand the basic parts of a picture book, you can start looking at the story and characters. Here are some questions you can ask yourself as you read:\n\n- What is the story about? Who are the main characters?\n- How does the drawing help to tell the story?\n- What is the feeling of the picture book?\n- How do the characters change in the story?\n- What lessons or messages are shown in the picture book?\n\nPart 3: Reading Different Kinds of Picture Books\n\nPicture books come in many different styles and kinds. Here are some common kinds you may see:\n\n- Superhero picture books: These show characters with special powers who stop bad things and keep the good ones safe.\n- Long story books: These are longer, more big stories that often show deeper lessons and are usually published as a single book.\n- Manga: These are picture books from JA city that often have a special style and focus on stories about characters.\n- Indie picture books: These are made by artists who work by themselves and often have more new or different ways of telling stories.\n\nPart 4: Ending\n\nIn the end, reading and looking at picture books is a fun and good thing to do. By understanding the basic parts and looking at the story and characters, you can enjoy picture books more. Whether you like superheroes, long story books, manga, or indie picture books, there is something for everyone in the world of picture books.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 5697, "idx": 31489, "original text": "Sunday, August 24, 2014\n\nDoctor Who: \"Deep Breath\" - The first new Peter Capaldi Doctor Who episode starts with a bang as a dinosaur is wandering the Thames in London. It slows down a bit in the middle, but there are nice little callbacks to previous events in the history of Doctor Who which the audience may have gotten well before it became obvious what was going on. Clara had her moments in this one, including a massively strong scene in which she stands up to the villain of the piece. There was also a great deal of humor with enough quotable quotes in the first half alone to keep Doctor Who fans quipping at one another for months. Overall, I enjoyed it. There were some flaws, but there always will be. Even at its worse, Doctor Who is generally better than most TV, and this was far from the worst we've seen from Doctor Who.\n\nHere are reviews of the DCBS comic books that I've gotten around to reading and reviewing, sorted by the original shipping date:\n\nJul 16th\n\nGreen Lantern: New Guardians #33 - I almost see a potential point to this story. But it's so stretched out that even if it were a good tale, it has taken long enough to tell that it's just become boring.\n\nHarley Quinn Invades Comic Con Intl San Diego #1 - Wow. Just... wow. This is meta is so many ways. And you really have to go over each panel to see all the in-jokes. Wow. Impressive. And terrifying. Wow.\n\nInfinite Crisis: Fight for the Multiverse #1 - I've read all this before. I hope it gets original mighty fast.\n\nScribblenauts Unmasked #7 - Maybe it was just because I was recently at the Wizard of Oz convention, but the various Wizard of Oz references in this one totally jumped out at me. Aquaman is so cute in Scribblenaut form!\n\nCapt Action Cat #3 - The magic is confused... really? No kidding? This is getting more fun and cute... and confusing... by the minute. I really like this sort of nonsense comic. It's got just enough plot to carry the hilarity.\n\nFables #142 - Yeah, Bigby appears to be in a really bad way. And there's a lot more going on in his family than I realized. Scary stuff, kiddies.\n\nJul 23rd\n\nAquaman #33 - This is all about a growing threat... and one that doesn't generally hold back. I'm glad Salty survived his run-in, but wow, lots of dead in the wake of this new bad guy. And more Vulko, which is both sad and good. Looking forward to the next issue.\n\nSecret Origins #4 - Harley Quinn, slightly different than what I've seen before, but close enough. Green Arrow, grim and gritty as always. And Robin, with art that felt so opposite the story I just cringed while reading the whole thing.\n\nTrinity of Sin: Pandora #13 - Ah, there's more to Marcus than meets the eye. Well, that's not really a surprise, I guess.\n\nBatman '66 #13 - A Batman TV show becoming popular and spawning fads? So implausible! This was a really fun episode issue from start to finish.\n\nBatman Beyond Universe #12 - And the two storylines mix it up and finish off in an ending that ties up most of the various little plots. It could have been better, but hey, Aquagirl. Doubled.\n\nDoctor Who 10th #1 - Nice set up for a story - Day of the Dead, Doctor wandering around with a non-buzzing device that isn't working quite right, and a girl whose trying to get away from a boring family situation. Good stuff.\n\nDoctor Who 11th #1 - And this one was a full story, complete with a fun alien or two, a blubbering prime minister and two really amusing shorts at the end of the book. I'm a bigger fan of the 10th Doctor, but this book was better.\n\nGroo vs Conan #1 - I am mostly unfamiliar with Groo, but I'm a bit of a fan of Conan (not a fanatic, I just am amused by the stories). This is a really funny start, mixed in with the \"real life\" bits and the characters noticing the differences in styles. This is just going to be a lot of fun, I can tell.\n\nSteed and Mrs. Peel: Needed #1 - Ah, this is much more like the Avengers I remember. That last series went off the rails more than a bit. This one seems to be following the formula while taking it to new heights. Good show so far.\n\nPeanuts V2 #20 - The usual fun. I tend to be able to tell the originals Schulz tales from the newer stuff, but they are all pretty good.\n\nStar Trek: Harlan Ellison's City on the Edge of Forever #2 - Curiouser and curiouser. This really is a journey into what could have been, what might have been, what ought to have been. There are some really good bits in here that were so far gone from what aired that it's depressing.\n\nTwilight Zone #7 - I'm getting more and more curious to see how this story ends up. She's already made a difference in some ways, what else is going to happen now that she's so involved? And the callback to the previous story was also good. It puts this one into a certain timeframe.\n\nMy mystery book this week was The Alpine Yeoman by Mary Daheim. A body found in Alpine isn't a local and doesn't arouse much interest, except why is a deputy gone missing and what are these crazy rumors about the high school? Everything sort of crashes together at the end of this one. I was expecting about half of it. Some of the other revelations and events were somewhat surprising. More fun for me was the tie-ins to my region of the state, including prominent mentions of Wapato and Yakima, and Emma getting in touch with old friends who worked in the newspaper business in this region. Heh. Fun. I like the continual complaints about how the newspaper industry is dying from the oldtimers, even as Emma points out that she's still running a paper. A good one, and I'm finally caught up with the series. If you want to start the Alpine series, I strongly recommend starting at the first book, The Alpine Advocate.", "hash": "6d8638f2fda2c907caa1092ca0c38ba891109625f6a04d0b8149ee3c8d64fd43"}

Here are some ideas:\n\n- Make a plan: Pick a new thing that you want to learn or try, like speaking a new language or tasting a new kind of food.\n- Join a class: Look for classes or workshops in your town that you think are fun. This could be anything from cooking to drawing to doing yoga.\n- Travel: See new places and learn about different ways of life by going on a trip. Even if you can't go far, visiting a new part of your town or country can be a great way to learn new things.\n- Make new friends: Try joining a group or club that likes the same things you do. This could be a reading club, a group that likes to walk outside, or a group that likes to help others.\n\n**Section 3: The Good Things About Learning New Things**\n\nLearning new things can be good for us in many ways, like:\n\n- Making us more creative: When we learn new things, we make our brains work in new ways and this can help us think of new ideas.\n- Helping us feel less worried: Doing things that are a bit difficult can sometimes make us feel scared, but it can also help us feel less worried and stressed.\n- Making us feel proud: Learning new things can help us feel good about what we can do and who we are.\n- Making our relationships better: Doing new things with other people can make our friendships stronger and help us feel closer to others.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nLearning new things can be fun and exciting. By trying new things in our lives, we can find out more about ourselves and the world, and learn important things. So, why not try something new today!", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 6804, "idx": 188019, "original text": "Trying something new, every day of the year\n\nMonthly Archives: November 2011\n\nPost navigation\n\nI love small, secret places that involve steep staircases and using lots of jangly keys to open doors. I asked a friend to help me accomplish my new act of the day and he showed me the back rooms of the Omnimax theatre he supervises. We climbed up a very sheer stairway to the projectionist room and the archival area where stacks of old reels are stored. I had been in some back rooms of the theatre before but hadn\u2019t stood at the very top. The theatre is five stories tall and domed; it was showing a documentary about tornadoes at the time. The contrast between the overwhelming movie screen and the small archival loft made me feel like I was watching a twister out of a tiny attic window.\n\nMondays have been hard for me lately. My days off are Sunday/Monday, so Mondays are my Sunday. I have my counseling appointment in the morning and I try to get grownup things done, like laundry, dishes, banking etc. I\u2019ve been having some intense sessions lately, which make it difficult to get a lot done afterwards. Today was a particularly emotional day and after finishing the bare minimum of chores and goals I decided to let myself off the hook for the rest of the day. This is a new act for me\u2013usually I just push through the difficulty and drag myself from one activity to another, motivated mostly by guilt and self-loathing. I decided to acknowledge that today was difficult, prioritize tasks and let some of them wait.\n\nLong car trips through the Midwest are very conducive to creativity for me. Maybe it\u2019s the liminality of the experience, maybe it\u2019s meditating on long fields of soybeans punctuated by visits to gas stations, maybe it\u2019s because there is nothing to do and you can only listen to so much NPR. The Husbandit and I have been working on a graphic novel for a while and about a third of it has been created on I-65 and Indiana 37. Writing in the graphic novel format and writing with another person has been a new experience for me; I\u2019m enjoying working with someone who has a strong sense of narrative structure (plot fills me with fear) and in a format that brings together words and images. I\u2019m intimidated by the process of researching and plunging into the comic book publishing world, but I\u2019m booking ahead regardless.\n\nToday we outlined the panel layout and wrote a rough draft of the text for the first issue. It is a little overwhelming to be thinking about visual and verbal storytelling at the same time.\n\nHere\u2019s to Minor Arcana: Issue O, Juan Diego\u2019s Amazing Day. May we do you justice.\n\nSo my planned first act was \u201ctake a bike ride with step dad and have heartfelt father-daughter time.\u201d It turned into \u201cstare angrily at unexpected flat tire\u201d then \u201ctrudge up long hill wearing ridiculous pants.\u201d These were all new experiences, but I wanted to do something a little more positive, so I learned how to make risotto from the Husbandit. It involves a lot of stirring, but it turned out delicious.\nI\u2019m glad I attempted the bike ride though. I\u2019m self-conscious about how slow a biker and runner I am, so it was a good step to push through that fear in order to do something I wanted to do, even if it didn\u2019t turn out in the end.\n\nSo, I feel like I\u2019m cheating a bit, since I\u2019ve been to movies before. However, I did forgo an old standby love, the Muppets, for a new movie that I knew almost nothing about except that it was based on a book I kept meaning to read. I saw Hugo, based on the Invention of Hugo Caberet.\nI really enjoyed the film\u2013I found myself very inspired by it and I loved the visual world. It felt like reading the kind of book I loved as a kid. There were intrepid orphans, fantastical machines, mysterious adults and some haunting momments. It made me want to go home immediately and create a story, which is a wonderful way to feel. It also made me want to cut my hair in a 1920s style bob, which is a little frightening, since I\u2019ve had long hair since I was old enough to no longer wear a baby bonnet. Who knows, maybe in the next 361 days that will be my new act.\n\nToday I learned how to make tortellini from scratch. My mother and I have made ravioli from scratch before, but never tortellini. Since we were going to serve the tortellini as a Thanksgiving entree, we made a pumpkin and asiago cheese filling, then mixed a simple dough. We chilled the dough, then rolled it out using a hand cranked pasta roller. It felt a lot like making Play-Doh spaghetti with the plastic machines and rollers. We had bought a rolling pasta cutter, that looks like a pizza cutter\u2019s older, more sophisticated sister but ended up using our ravioli frame to cut out perfect little dough squares. Like the modern, crafty women we are, Mom and I learned to fold the individual tortellini from YouTube.\nOur first tortellini were lopsided and lumpy, but as we made enough to feed 7 people they got a little more even. They were easier to cook than ravioli since they were smaller and less likely to tear. I found them delicious and my mom and I ended Thanksgiving dinner with the traditional high five of successful cooks.\nI\u2019m always a little nervous about trying something new when it involves hospitality, like bringing an out of town friend to a bar I\u2019ve never been to, or cooking something new for a dinner party. I hate messing up in front of other people and I\u2019m also a very nervous hostess. I tend to overplan and flutter around all night, desperately checking to see if people are having a good time. It was a risk to try making something new for family on a day that is associated with tradition and welcome\u2013but I\u2019m glad I did it.\n\nI am not very good at games. I say this with shame because as a nerd, I really should be good at games. If nothing else, I should be good at them from sheer repetition\u2013my friends are all avid board game players, RPG players and video game players. I\u2019m usually the one accidentally putting a Jack on top of a King, figuring out for 9 millionth time how to roll initiative or attempting to drive stick-shift on Mario Kart. I\u2019m good at narrative; I can make up a great story about why we are buying up Park Avenue, or opening the portal by Miskatonic University but when it comes to strategy I really suck.\n\nToday I asked my staff at work what new thing I should try today and they decided that I needed to learn a card game called speed. I actually really enjoyed it. The rules were pretty simple and it involved playing cards fast. The staff member I was playing with is very competitive and so am I, so we got really into it. I was pleasantly surprised that I won the 4th game. I feel a little less intimidated by the upcoming 5 months of inside games, a.k.a. Chicago winter.", "hash": "bc2857b56854c70786ff84f75340c8fcddccb48cb6647612c92ddb8cdd190ab1"}
{"text": "Lesson Title: How Things From Other Places Can Change Our World\n\nIntroduction:\nIn this lesson, we will learn about how things from other places can change our world. We will think about why these things come to new places, how they can change the way things grow, and why it can be hard to control them.\n\nSection 1: Why Do Things Come From Other Places?\n\nThings from other places are plants, animals, or bugs that usually don't live in a certain place. They often come to new places on purpose or by accident for different reasons, like:\n\n- To look nice: People may bring things from other places to their gardens or homes because they think they are pretty.\n- To help with farming: Some things from other places can be helpful for growing food, like certain types of plants or animals.\n- Getting rid of bugs: Sometimes, we bring in new kinds of animals or plants to help get rid of bugs.\n\nBut, this can sometimes cause problems we didn't expect.\n\nChapter 2: What Happens When We Bring in New Animals or Plants\n\nWhen we bring new animals or plants into a place, it can hurt the animals or plants that were already there. This can happen in a few ways:\n\n- They want the same things: The new animals or plants might want the same food, water, or homes that the old ones want.\n- They might eat the old ones: The new animals or plants might eat the old ones, which makes there be less of the old ones.\n- They might make the old ones sick: The new animals or plants might have germs that make the old ones sick.\n- They might change the place: The new animals or plants might change the place in a way that the old ones don't like.\n\nOne time this happened was with a plant called the water hyacinth. People brought it to the US because it was pretty. But, it grew too much and didn't let other plants grow. It also made it hard for fish to have babies and hurt the environment.\n\nChapter 3: Why It's Hard to Control New Animals or Plants\n\nIt can be hard to control new animals or plants for a few reasons:\n\n- They might have a lot of babies: Some new animals or plants can have a lot of babies, which makes it hard to get rid of them once they're there.\n- They might be hard to find: New animals or plants might be hard to find, especially if they're small or live in places that are hard to get to.\n- They might live in a lot of places: Some new animals or plants might live in a lot of places, which makes it hard to stop them from spreading.\n- They might be hard to get rid of: New animals or plants might not die if we try to get rid of them with bug spray or other things.\n\nChapter 4: How New Animals or Plants Can Hurt Us\n\nNew animals or plants can also hurt us by causing problems for farming, forests, and other things. For example, a mussel called the zebra mussel was brought to the US in water from ships, and it hurt the fish in the Great Lakes a lot.

It's very important to stop them from coming in and to get rid of them if they're already here.

{"text": "Lesson: Things We Might Not Know About Growing Up\n\n## Introduction\nIn this lesson, we will learn about things we might not know about when we grow up. We will also talk about saving money for when we are older and why it is important. Finally, we will talk about choosing the right plan for you.\n\n## Section 1: Things We Might Not Know About Growing Up\nGrowing up is a time when we look forward to having fun and trying new things. Sometimes, we might worry about things that could happen when we're older and done with work. These things could be money going up and down, prices going up, needing a lot of medicine, and living for a very long time.\n## Part 2: The Good Thing About Saving Money Without Paying Taxes\nOne reason why people like saving money in special plans, like 401(k), annuities, and IRAs, is because they can grow without paying taxes. This means your money can get more and more over time without being taxed, which can help you save more for when you're older and not working. This can also help you pay less in taxes.\n## Part 3: Picking the Right Saving Plan for Your Work\nTo pick the right saving plan for your work, you need to ask yourself four main questions. First, what do you want to do when you're done with work? Second, how much money are you willing to save? Third, what kind of things do you want to save your money in? Fourth, how much help do you need with all the paperwork?\n## Part 4: Taking Out Money When You're Older\nTaking out a little bit of money over and over when you're older can be tricky. This is because you might not know how long you will live, and you might run out of money if you don't plan well. A better idea might be to make sure you have money coming in that will last for all the years when you're done working.\n## Part 5: A Big Question About Money When You're Older\nSome people worry if a program called Social Security will have enough money to give them what they should get. It's true that Social Security has some money problems, but it's still a big part of how most people plan for when they're older. It's important to know how Social Security works and how it fits into your plan for when you're older.\n## Part 6: The Things to Do Before You Stop Working\nThis list can show you how ready you are for when you're done with work. It includes things like guessing how much money you'll need when you're older, figuring out how much money you'll get, and checking your plan for what happens to your things after you're gone. By going through this list, you can make sure you're ready for a good time when you're done with work.\n## The End\nIn the end, by knowing the things we might worry about when we're older, the good thing about saving money without paying taxes, and how important it is to pick the right saving plan for our work, we can make good choices that will help us have a good time when we're older. By making sure we have money coming in and knowing how Social Security fits into our plans, we can be ready for when we're older.\n## Words to Know\n- Things we might worry about: Things or situations that might not happen or be solved\n- Saving money without paying taxes: When your saved money gets more and more without being taxed until you take it out\n- Saving plan: A plan that lets people save money for when they're older and get tax benefits\n- Taking out money: Taking out a little bit of money over and over from what you've saved or from an account\n- Social Security: A program that gives money to people who are done with work, can't work, or are gone\n- Things to do before you stop working: A list of tasks that people should do before they're done with work", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 894, "idx": 343905, "original text": "<<.

{"text": "Lesson Title: Learning About Saying Sorry\n\nIntroduction:\nIn this lesson, we will learn about saying sorry when we do something wrong. We will talk about what it means to say sorry and why it's important to say sorry when we make mistakes.\n\nBeginning Thoughts:\nDear God, please help us to understand why saying sorry is important and how it helps us to be friends with you.\n\nStory and Discussion:\nDavid said to them, \"If we're feeling good, we don't need a doctor, but if we're feeling sick; I came not to talk to those who are always good, but to those who make mistakes.\" (Story 2:17)\n\nDiscussion:\nIn this part of the story, David talks about why it's important to say sorry when we do something wrong. He came to talk to those who make mistakes, not those who are always good, because he knows that everyone makes mistakes and needs to say sorry.\n\nImportant Ideas:\n1422 As we learn and grow, we must say sorry for the mistakes that make us not so nice. We must also be able to say no to the bad things we might want to do, and also to speak up for those who are treated unfairly. We need to be strong and do the right things.\n\n1423 The cross is a symbol of Adam, who came to help us. But it's also a symbol of the son of man, who had to go through tough things to show us the bad side of doing wrong. It's a symbol of the one who took all the wrongdoings of the world to make it right by the power of his comeback.\n\n1424 Saying sorry when we do wrong is a very important part of Adam's mission. The Church, as a tool of that mission, must talk about saying sorry in the name of Adam: \"Go, therefore, make friends of all people, treating them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to follow all that I have told you, and look, I am with you always, until the end of time.\"\n\nTalking About What We Learned:\nSaying sorry when we do wrong is a big part of what we believe. We believe that Adam helped us by taking our wrongdoings and that through saying sorry, we can make up for our mistakes. This is a very important part of our friendship with God and helps us to be closer to him.\n\nActivity:\nWrite a little about why it's important to say sorry when we do something wrong. How does it change our friendship with God and others?\n\nEnding Thoughts:\nDear God, thank you for the gift of being able to say sorry. Help us to see why it's important to say sorry when we do something wrong and to be closer to you through this act of being humble.\n\nWords to Know:\n- Feeling bad: feeling sad for having done something wrong\n- Saying sorry: a way in which we say sorry for doing wrong through admitting and saying sorry for our mistakes\n\nConclusion:\nIn this story, we learned about the importance of saying sorry when we do something wrong and the part it plays in our friendship with God. We also talked about the act of saying sorry and how it helps us to get closer to God. By knowing why saying sorry is important, we can try to live better and make our friendship with God stronger.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 695, "idx": 475258, "original text": "8th Grade: Lesson 11: Creed: Forgiveness of Sins.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Big Ideas of Money\n\nIntroduction:\nBig ideas of money are like rules that help people understand how things are bought and sold. These big ideas can be different because they use different rules and ways to solve problems. In this story, we will learn about one big idea - the 'K' idea.\n\nSection 1: Learning the 'K' Idea\n\nTopic 1: What We Need to Know\nThe 'K' idea is built on a few important things we need to know. One of the most important things is that sometimes people who want to work can't find work because there is not enough work available. People who believe in the 'K' idea think that if the government helps out, more people can find work.\n\nTopic 2: How We Learn\nThe 'K' idea uses different ways to understand how buying and selling work. One of the important ways is looking at how much people want to buy and how much is available to sell. People who believe in the 'K' idea think that if people want to buy more things, more jobs can be created.\n\nTopic 3: What to Do\nThe 'K' idea suggests that the government should help when a lot of people can't find work. Some of the ways the government can help include spending more money, reducing the amount of money people have to pay in taxes, and increasing the amount of money available.\n\nSection 2: Real Life Examples\n\nTopic 1: Government Spending\nDuring a very tough time, many places decided to spend more money and reduce taxes. These actions were meant to make people want to buy more things and help the economy grow.\n\nTopic 2: Money Rules\nThe big bank reduced the cost of borrowing money during this tough time to make people want to spend more. This was meant to make people want to buy more things and help the economy grow.\n\nSection 3: Questions and Answers\n\nQuestion: Should the government help when a lot of people can't find work?\n\nAnswer: Some people say that the government should not help because it can lead to other problems, like prices going up or less private investment. Others say that the government should help those who can't find work because sometimes the market fails.\n\nConclusion:\nUnderstanding big ideas of money, like the 'K' idea, is important for understanding how buying and selling works and how decisions are made. By learning about these big ideas, we can think better and use our thinking to solve new problems.\n\nSimple Words:\nDemand: How much people want to buy.\nSupply: How much is available to sell.\nPeople who can't find work: People who want to work but can't find a job because there is not enough work available.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 651, "idx": 218094, "original text": "It\u2019s pretty easy to make a two minute video from interviewing people at a political rally and make those people look pretty dumb.

{"text": "Lesson: Understanding How Things Work\n\nIntroduction:\nIn this lesson, we will explore the idea of how things work. We will talk about what makes things work, why it is important, and how changing things can affect how they work. By the end of this lesson, you will understand more about how things work and how we can make them work better.\n\nWhat is Light Bouncing?\nLight bouncing happens when light moves around in a not smooth place and then goes a different way. Sometimes this makes the light move slower. People study this because it can help us understand how to use light to send messages. \n\nWhy is Strong Sound Important?\nStrong sound means how wide a machine can make sounds without changing them too much. In light bouncing, strong sound is important because it tells how much the light can be changed by the machine. A bigger strong sound means that the machine can change a lot of light, which is good for machines that need to work with a lot of light. \n\nHow does the Number of Parts Change Strong Sound?\nIn a machine with many parts, the strong sound changes when there are more parts. When there are more parts, the strong sound becomes smaller. This can make the light look strange in machines that have to slow down the light, which can make them work not as well. But, some machines that need the smallest strong sound can work better when the strong sound is smaller. \n\nExample of Using Light: Light Storing\nOne way to use light is in light storing. Light storing uses machines to keep light for a long time. By making the strong sound smaller in a machine with many parts, the time we can keep light in light storing can be made longer by a lot.\n\nIn Short:\nIn this learning, we have talked about how to make the strong sound smaller in a machine with many parts. We talked about what light bouncing is, why strong sound is important, and how the number of parts in a machine can change its strong sound. We also talked about an example, light storing, that can work better when the strong sound is smaller. By understanding these things, you can use them in other ways that need to change light.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 853, "idx": 8864, "original text": "Bandwidth reduction in a multistage Brillouin system.\nWe investigate the gain bandwidth of stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) in multistage systems. As we will show, the bandwidth is reduced significantly by the number of stages, which can increase the distortions in cascaded slow-light systems, for instance. However, other applications, which are limited by the minimum bandwidth achievable with SBS, can benefit from the reduced bandwidth. Since the peak value of the SBS gain spectrum is not reduced by this method, the reduced bandwidth can drastically enhance the performance of many different applications, such as the quasi-light storage (QLS). The minimum bandwidth of 10.3 MHz for a one-stage system was reduced down to 5.8 MHz for three stages. With this reduced bandwidth, we achieved a storage time advancement of the QLS method by 60%.", "hash": "248d715bf19cbf248e06a1a77e28640e7fe756fe436948f8c61725c50273ecc2"}

{"text": "Lesson: Learning about Our Body's Defenses\n\n### Overview\n\nIn this lesson, we will learn about how our body fights off germs and keeps us healthy. We will talk about things like how our body finds and destroys germs, and why getting shots at the doctor's office can help keep us from getting sick.\n\n### Section 1: Our Body's Defenses\n\nOur body has a special system to help keep us from getting sick. This system is made up of many parts that work together to find and destroy germs. \n\nOne part of this system works all the time to keep us safe. It includes things like our skin and stuff in our body like special cells that can find and destroy germs.\n\nAnother part of this system is very good at finding and destroying specific germs. It includes cells that can make special weapons to destroy foreign things in our body, and other cells that can destroy germs directly or help other cells do their job.\n\n### Section 2: Our Body's Weapons\n\nOur body has special weapons called proteins that can find and stick to specific germs. These proteins come in different shapes and do different jobs.\n\nSome of these proteins are found on the surface of some cells, where they can trap and destroy germs.\n\nSome proteins help to start our body's defense.\n\nSome proteins can cause reactions that cause symptoms like itching and swelling.\n\nThe most common type of these proteins are found in our blood. They can even help protect babies before they are born.\n\nSome proteins are found in blood and other fluids in our body, where they can quickly find germs and mark them for destruction by other cells.\n\n### Section 3: Shots from the Doctor\n\nGetting shots at the doctor's office is one of the best ways to keep from getting sick. These shots work by giving our body a weak or dead germ, or parts of the germ, so our body can learn how to fight it off without getting sick.\n\nOnce our body has learned how to fight off the germ, it remembers how to do it, so if we come across the germ again, our body can quickly find and destroy it before it makes us sick.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nLearning about how our body fights off germs and keeps us healthy is very interesting. By learning about our body's defenses, we can find better ways to treat and prevent sickness.\n\nWords to Remember:\n- Our Body's Defenses: How our body keeps us from getting sick.\n- Body's defense: Our body fights against tiny harmful things.\n- Tiny triggers: Small things on the tiny harmful things that can start our body's fight.\n- Body fighters: Things made by our body to fight against specific tiny triggers.\n- Fighting practice: A way to give our body a weak or changed tiny harmful thing so our body can learn to fight without getting really sick.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1601, "idx": 385578, "original text": "Separation of spleen colony-forming units and prothymocytes by use of a monoclonal antibody detecting an H-2K determinant.\nThe density of H-2K antigens was determined on both the mouse hemopoietic stem cell, using an assay for spleen colony-forming units (CFU-S), and the prothymocyte, using a thymus repopulation assay. This was done by light-activated cell sorting of bone marrow cells labeled first with a biotinylated antibody against H-2Kk and then with avidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate. Almost all CFU-S were found to be present among the 4% bone marrow cells with high forward light scatter (FLS), low perpendicular light scatter (PLS), and bright immunofluorescence. Thymus regeneration by this brightly fluorescent fraction was delayed 3 days compared to thymus regeneration by unsorted cells, although the same number of CFU-S was present in each cell suspension. This delay indicates that differentiation from CFU-S to prothymocytes takes 3 days. The fraction of cells in the FLS/PLS window with dull anti-H-2Kk fluorescence contained few CFU-S and gave rise to a transient thymus regeneration. These findings indicate that the prothymocyte carries fewer H-2K antigens than does the CFU-S. The H-2K antigen is a marker with which CFU-S and prothymocytes can be separated. Therefore, during early T-cell differentiation, the number of H-2K molecules on the cell surface decreases (CFU-S----prothymocyte----cortical thymocyte). During maturation of T cells, a reexpression of H-2K molecules occurs, since lymph node cells and spleen cells were shown to be brightly positive for H-2K antigen.", "hash": "8e2efbd3a9948c412c0e12348803fb1edb40e73808cb87a4fb8f5f5188acb9a8"}
