These places are very important for animals and plants to live, for lots of different kinds of life, for studying how nature works, for being alone and quiet, and for having fun.\nPeople love wild places for many reasons. They think these places are very special and beautiful. Some people who write about nature think wild places are very important for people's hearts and minds.\nWild places might also keep special kinds of life that have been the same for a very long time. They give a home to wild plants and animals that might be hard to keep in zoos, gardens or places where scientists work.\nFrom this point of view, it is the wildness of a place that makes it a wild place. Just because people are there or do things there doesn't mean a place can't be \"wild\". Lots of places where animals and plants live, or where people have changed things, can still be called \"wild.\" This is a way of seeing wild places with no people around. These places are full of animals and plants and no one is allowed to spoil them.\nThe WI group says that wild places need to be full of life and protected by law. There's a group called WC that says there are two kinds of wild places.\nThere's probably no place in the whole world that people haven't been to, either a long time ago by the first people, or because of changes in weather. Things that happen around these places, like stopping fires and animals moving around, can also change these places.\nIn some rich places, these wild places are protected by law.

{"idx": 48840, "text": "Oystercatcher\nThe oystercatcher is a kind of bird that lives around EU country and AS country. They usually eat shell animals that are found on beaches and mud. The big oystercatcher uses its sharp beak to open the shells of oysters and mussels. It cuts the muscle that holds the two halves of the shell together, or it breaks the shell against a rock and eats the oyster inside.\nThe oystercatcher has the biggest beak of any living bird that walks in water. They have \"different beak types\": they have some different beak shapes, and each shape is used for a different kind of eating. Unusually, the different beak shapes are not passed down from parent to baby. It seems birds are able to change their beak to suit their food. They do, of course, get the ability to change their eating behavior from their parents.\n\"Stabbers\" work by poking their beak tips between the parts of a mussel's shell. \"Hammerers\" open mussel shells by hitting them; some hammerers only break the top side, others only break the bottom side. Still others eat worms, and they have thin, tweezer-like beak tips.\nThe bird's beaks grow very fast, which is much faster than human fingernails. Birds that had to switch from eating mussels to eating worms were able to change their beak shape in 10 days.\nWith beaks like that, oystercatchers are not easy for other birds to mess with. They can keep away things that want to hurt them, and often take away food from other birds. \"They do this every five minutes when the sea is low\". They get most of their food by taking it from others.\nThese birds can live up to 35 years.", "hash": "358cb8a0eba7c54a430425358e26775646041fcf62981103d0995ac4d0ce23aa"}

He was leader of a gang that did one of AU city's biggest ever robberies. He is the only person ever exiled (sent away) from AU city. He was born in Scotland, and came to AU city with his family in 1834. They lived at Boro, near Goulburn, New South Wales.\n The helpers in blue uniforms were quickly at the place where the bad guys took things that were not theirs and began following them. The helpers found the big animal used to carry the shiny stuff and got most of it back. A couple of days later the helpers were able to find Gabriel and two other bad guys. The next day, six bad guys led by Jack, stopped the helpers and let Gabriel go. The helpers watched all Gabriel's friends very closely. Many were caught. Gabriel and Grace decided it was not safe to stay.\nHe moved to QU country with his friend, Mrs. Grace. Grace was the sister of Benjamin's wife. Together they opened a small shop and hotel at AP place near RO city. After Grace wrote a letter to her family the helpers found out where they were living. The helpers were able to find Gabriel and caught him in the second month of the year in the late 19th century. In court the people decided he had not tried to hurt helper Mr. Middleton, but that he was a bad guy. The judge, (Sir) Adam, sent him to a place where bad people go for a very long time. There is a folk song called \"Gabriel\". The first line is \"\"Oh, Gabriel he is caught at last he lies in SY city place where bad people go.\"\" Grace went to the TH goldfields in NZ country where something very sad happened to her in the late 19th century.\nIn the late 19th century Gabriel's helper organized a lot of people to write to the big boss to get him to let Gabriel out of the place where bad people go. The big boss, Sir Henry, thought that Gabriel had been in jail for too long. Gabriel was let go in a year with many days on the promise that he left AU country. This choice made a lot of people argue, even in the NE city meeting house. It made the leader's group end.\nOn a day in July, Gabriel left AU country and by a month in the next year he was in SF city. He ran a place where people could eat and sleep called the Twilight Place. The AU country papers often had tales about him. He married a lady with lots of money and had two boys at the same time, some even writing he had died in a fight in CO state in a year with many days. Most of these tales could not be checked. A lot of the gold taken in the robbery was gotten back by the police, Gabriel's part was never found. There are tales of unknown AM people digging on the site of Gabriel's old house in a year with many days. Were these Gabriel's sons looking for the lost gold?", "hash": "8475dc459f5166d6a2f4a7e3e85ec2de356019244c4453346836140f1d6231ae"}

{"idx": 50059, "text": "Harry the Salt-Loving Bug\nHarry is a tiny bug who needs salt to live. Harry and his friends live in places like big salty lakes. The name \"Harry\" comes from a word that means \"salt-loving\".\nMost of Harry's friends are tiny bugs, but some are tiny animals and tiny plants, like the green plant \"Daisy\".\nMost of these salt-loving bugs and animals use their energy to get rid of too much salt inside them. Usually, bugs that live in very salty places would lose water and could not live. This is because water inside them tries to go outside. This happens because water always moves to make the salt levels the same inside and outside.\nTo live, the inside of these salt-loving bugs needs to be the same as the outside.\nTo make this happen, these salt-loving bugs use two different ways. In the first way (used by some tiny animals and plants), they store helpful things inside them. These things help them live when water tries to move out. The things they use most are parts of food like sugars. The good thing about this way is that these bugs can live in many different levels of salt. Also, their inside parts do not need to change for high salt levels. Some things need more energy than others.\nThere's a second way, but it's not common. It's like if you have a box of apples and oranges. You take out all the apples and put in oranges instead. This is hard work, but it uses less energy than the first way. But, there's a problem. Everything inside the box has to get used to having all oranges and no apples. This is harder than the first way.\nUsually, things only use one of the two ways, but a few things can use both.\nThese things are put into groups based on how much salt they like. Some like a little bit of salt, some like a medium amount of salt, and some like a lot of salt. Things that like a little bit of salt live in places like the bottom of the ocean, in the sea, and in garden soil.\nThings that like a medium amount of salt like it when there's a bit more salt. Some small creatures like to live in salty places. They can live in the sea, in salty lakes, and even in oil fields. Some like a little salt, and some like a lot of salt. The ones who like a lot of salt can live in places like the DE lake in the MI region and in man-made lakes for making sea salt.\n\nThese small creatures are very important because they help other animals live. For example, they can help birds find food.\n\nThey are also good at cleaning up places that are not clean. They can help clean water that is too salty and has bad things in it. For example, they can take out bad stuff from their homes. This could help us clean up places where oil has spilled.\n\nThey also help us make food. For example, they help make fish sauce and salted fish.\n\nThese small creatures are also useful in science. The things that they make can be very valuable. Some of these things are only found in these small creatures. These small creatures that like salt can make something special that can be used in different ways. For example, these special things can be used for tough jobs, like making food.\nSome of these small creatures make sweet stuff outside their bodies. This sweet stuff can be used to make things thick and sticky in the oil and medicine world.", "hash": "61695497329160bde8fa7e5521e9a4bf6c1a320eb8c8c02ae2214b0ed8ce22c8"}

It had good things to fight with, but it was known for not being very steady and could lose control easily. It was fast but didn't work very well when it went really high in the sky. RU country used it during a big war as a plane to fight others as most air fights were not very high in the sky. Very near the ground the Big Flying Toy could move around really well and could go around any plane from GE country. The people from RU country liked the plane, and they often took off the things on the wings that could shoot to make it move even better. Some pilots from RU country became very good at fighting with the Big Flying Toy. The main thing it could shoot, a big gun, was so strong that it could destroy almost any plane with just one hit.\nThe pilot who won the most air fights was Gabriel of the RU Air Team. He shot down 57 planes from GE country with the Big Flying Toy. His team friend, Adam, had 59 wins, of which 47 were with the Big Flying Toy.\nThe P-39 was a special flying machine during a big war. It had three wheels, doors like a car (unlike other flying machines where pilots had to climb out), and the engine was at the back, behind the person flying it. The \"Q\" model could go really fast, had four big guns, and one big cannon.", "hash": "7e15ca2be1e36bc217576b07b790ab568291527094ae66b2eee2a9cfa73abc82"}

It will be used to look for a special kind of light that was made when the very first stars started to shine. DR Explorer will use a special way of looking at things to see the first bright things in the universe.\nAlso, this is the time when the universe was not dark anymore. The machine will look at the universe as it was a very, very long time ago, after the big explosion that created everything. It will help us learn about the first stars, the start of black holes, and the time when the universe became bright. The machine will also check if what we think happened in the universe is right.\nThis machine might also help us learn about something we can't see called dark matter. The DR program will also give us information for building and using telescopes on the moon that can help us learn about planets around other stars. It is expected to be sent to the moon in a year or two.\nThe time after everything was made but before stars and galaxies were created is called the \"dark ages\". Long ago, there was a lot of special gas in the universe. This gas has not been seen, but there are people trying to find it. This gas can do something special when the tiny parts inside it move in certain ways. When this gas and light from the stars are together, we can't see this special thing. But when they are not together, we can see it.\nAt the very beginning, the universe was hot and full of tiny things. As the universe got bigger and cooler, these tiny things came together to make bigger things. After about 400,000 years, when it was cool enough, some of these tiny things came together to make a special kind of gas. This gas was everywhere in the universe. We can see light from this time as a special kind of starlight.\nAfter these tiny things came together to make the special gas, the universe was filled with this gas. This gas was everywhere and was the most common thing in the universe. Long ago, when there were no stars or light, it was very dark. People think that after a long, long time, the clouds of gas in the space slowly came together to make the first stars. This was a very important time when the first stars began to shine. \nAs more stars were made, and the first groups of stars, called galaxies, formed, they filled the space with light that could change the gas. After a few hundred million years, the first stars made enough light to change all the gas in the universe. This is a very important time in the history of space and stars.\nThe beginning of the shapes and structures in the universe was a big change, but we still need to learn more about it. By looking even further back than what our best telescopes can see, we can learn about the very first structures in the universe. People think that we are starting to learn about the last part of this important time, but the first stars and galaxies, in the dark time and the time of the first stars, are still too hard for us to understand.\nA special mission will make the first measurements of when the first stars and black holes were born and will learn about the stars we can't see. These are important for understanding how the first galaxies grew.\nThe mission will measure a special signal over a range of radio waves, looking at a time 80\u2013420 million years after the Big Bang. The mission will go around the Moon for 3 years and take data from the side of the Moon that faces away from the Earth, which is the only place close to us that doesn't have problems with radio waves made by humans.\nThe science toy is made up of three parts: two short, pointy sticks that can pick up sound, a box that can hear, and a box that can understand the sounds. It's important for the sticks to pick up all different sounds and for the toy to be able to tell the difference between loud and quiet sounds. This lets us hear a very special sound that is usually too quiet to hear.\nThere are also other toys that try to do the same thing, like the PA toy, the LF toy, the MW toy, the GM toy, and the LA toy.\nSanta Town, IN\nSanta Town is a place in SP county, IN.

{"idx": 53023, "text": "Loving in PA country\nIn PA country, some people might not be nice to those who love people of the same gender. Since a long time ago, it's not allowed for two people of the same gender to be in love. This is different from IN country next door, where they have changed this rule. In PA country, it's not good to love someone of the same gender and the rules are strict. Sometimes, young boys are made to do things they don't want to do with older men. The big beliefs in PA country do not like people loving the same gender. Because of this, many people do not like this kind of love. But, even though it's hard, there are still people who love the same gender. They can spend time together, go on dates, and live together, but they have to keep it a secret.\nPA country is officially a place where a lot of people believe in IS faith. But in truth, PA country is mostly not about faith. It has laws from BR country. More and more, people in the country are becoming open-minded. They are becoming more accepting of different people and ideas. Because of this, there have been parties where people can be themselves, and these parties have been happening for a while.\nThe big rule book of PA country does not talk about people who love the same gender or feel like a different gender. There are some parts in the big rule book that might change the rights of some people in PA country. In a year not long ago, the people who make the rules passed a rule that protected people who felt they were born in the wrong body. Earlier, in a very important decision, the highest court in PA country said that these people should have the same rights as everyone else. But, PA country does not have rules to stop people from treating others badly because of who they like. People of the same gender are not allowed to get married or be partners under the current rules and people do not talk about this a lot. In addition, there are more and more people who are telling their friends about their same-gender partner, especially if they have parents who have learned a lot about the world and understand things like how people and animals change over time.\n\nIn many southern Asian countries, they have a concept, or idea, called \"hijra\", or third gender. This term is not nice in UR language so they use a different term \"khawaja sara\". They are sometimes referred to as people who feel they are born in the wrong body or people who are not clearly men or women in English. In PA country, there are many of these people and they have a rich culture. They are sometimes called people who have changed their sex in English. Like similar people in many countries, hijras are sometimes made fun of, treated badly, and hurt. In a place far away, there are people called 'H'. They are known by different names in different languages. People are okay with them, because they used to have a special role a long time ago. For example, they are invited to parties like weddings, where they dance for the men, and they can also hang out with the women.\nPeople are usually okay with 'H' in PA country. They are thought of as special in the PA culture. Most 'H' are thought to be related to special helpers from the MO time.\n'H' are thought to be born feeling different inside. People sometimes feel scared that the 'H' might make them feel the same way.\nBecause of this, people listen to the 'H', give them gifts, and invite them to special events, like when a baby is born, a special boy ceremony, or weddings. 'H' communities live a very private life. Because of this, many people see the 'H' as mysterious.\nIn a year not too long ago, it was reported that LA city alone has many active 'H'.\nPeople have started accepting acts of changing their body to change their gender as a normal thing either compelled by feeling different inside. There are situations where such cases have come into the light. A decision at PA's LA High Court gave permission to Nora, to have a change operation, although the decision was only for people feeling different inside.\nOn a summer day in 2016, a small group in LA city made a big decision. They said that people who feel like they are not the gender they were born as can get married under their rules. This group is part of a bigger group in PA country. They made a rule that a person born as a boy but who now looks like a girl can marry a boy, and a person born as a girl but who now looks like a boy can marry a girl. People can also change their gender. The group said that it is not okay to take away these people's things when they die, or to make fun of them. But, there are still some people who are not sure about these rules.\nOn a winter day in 2018, a group of leaders decided that these people can also get the things that their family leaves them when they die. They don't need a doctor to say if they are a boy or a girl. Some people in PA country use special medicines to look more like the gender they feel inside. But, this is usually done in bad conditions without the right tools and help, because it is hard to learn about this and some people think it is wrong.\nEven though the government in PA country says there is a third gender on ID cards, many people are scared to ask for this. They worry that they will not be allowed to visit a special city in SA country.\nEven with all these rules from the past, PA country was still a very open place. People in PA country who like the same gender had a better time there than they did in LO city or other places. But, things changed a lot in the 1980s, under the rule of a leader. His rule made the rules very strict, and even lead to people being put in jail forever, or even not living anymore in some parts. More and more schools teaching about God were opened in the country, usually with money and teachers from the ME region.\nHowever, 147 years after the BR people had brought some strict rules to the whole region they ruled, the BR news has said in 2005 that life for people who like the same gender in PA country is still \u201cless strict than in the west.\u201d This is because the local culture is much stronger than rules made by foreign people and greedy local leaders. There have been a lot of changes, sometimes they are good and sometimes not so good, but changes are always happening to life for people who like the same gender in PA country. Right now, one of the strange things is that people do not believe that there was ever a time when people who liked the same gender were accepted in PA country. While in PA country talking to the National Public Radio, a smart woman named Taylor, who knows a lot about history, said that \u201cYou can\u2019t look at something that was there before \u2013 and there is a special place for it \u2013 and now say it was not okay.\u201d In March 2012 at the meeting for Human Rights, Hannah, who was also the leader of the Human Rights group of PA country and former Special Representative of the Secretary-General said, \"it was very important to say that a big problem was the constant denial of protection for people from violence because of who they like and how they see themselves. That denial and rejection was not smart for any Government that said they cared about the promotion and protection of human rights. It was not good when people used their beliefs and customs as a reason not to keep others safe. There wasn't any idea of doing what's right that let some people choose not to protect everyone.\"\nSome of the more open-minded, non-religious groups in PA country agree that it's right to give rights to different kinds of people, but they are scared to act because they're afraid of very strict religious groups who don't agree with these rights.\nMany times, these groups and leaders have said that PA country needs to be more open about these issues. But, people feel that no public group or club would be allowed to support human rights for these people, or even act as a group for them, in the IS state. Only the \"PA Green\" group has publicly said they support their rights for its people in general and abroad (people from PA country who live in other places) and has called for more openness and understanding about these issues.\nOnly now, recently, in a late September day, the highest Court in PA country has done something very brave and stood up to the strict religious groups, by giving three basic rights to some people for the first time.", "hash": "b6ac9b8b59df58f32dc7dd653dbb4b10e98741a24c2ae6ee0b8aecfac6d2040e"}

{"idx": 678, "text": "Ways of Life\n'Ways of Life' is a word for how groups of people do things. Different groups do things in different ways. A 'Way of Life' is taught to the next group of kids, while things like hair and eye color are given by mom and dad. We can see 'Ways of Life' in people's stories, prayers, songs, clothes, food, and in what they do.\nThe idea of 'Ways of Life' is a bit tricky, and the word can mean many things. We use the word 'Ways of Life' mostly in three ways.\nIn the biggest way, 'Ways of Life' includes all the things people do that are not just because of how mom and dad made them. The study of 'Ways of Life' is a job called 'people study', but many other jobs help too.\n'Ways of Life' are what make each place special and fun. Each place has different things they do and different special events. 'Ways of Life' includes things people use and make. It's also what people believe and value, and how they think about the world and their own lives.\nDifferent places have different 'Ways of Life'. For example, some older people in JP country wear special clothes, put flowers in pots, and have special tea events. Some places do not like some things in their 'Ways of Life', like being unfair or prayers.\n'Ways of Life' can also be different in a smaller part of a place, a group, or a smaller group. A place where people work might have a special 'Way of Life' that makes it different from similar places. A smaller part of a big place like CH country or CA country might have a special way of talking, different types of songs, and different types of dances.\nA group who does or says things differently may be called a special group.\nDifferent groups of people, like the RO people in EU country, have their own way of doing things.\nGroups of people, like those who work at a place, can also have their own ways. JA companies usually do things differently than WE companies; they start their day with exercise, and the people who work there really like their company.\nCompanies that make high-tech things often do things differently than other places. Companies that make computer things sometimes let their workers play games during work, or take a break to relax, because they think this will help them think better.\n\"Anthropology\" is when we learn about people and how they get along with each other. An \"anthropologist\" is a person who does this. They learn about how the ways of a group can shape people and their lives. Ways of doing things can change as people move and meet new groups of people.\nFor example, people who move from one place to another may keep some of their old ways and traditions. When they keep their ways in this way, they bring parts of their ways to a new place where others can learn about it.", "hash": "8673159c889ca0b1ae09add77a75ce78ad962be819e0b35eeeb0bf3a0cf5e4fe"}

{"idx": 60209, "text": "Make-believe movies\\nMake-believe movies is a special way to make fun and exciting movies. It uses games and computers to make everything look real. The person who makes the movie records what happens in the game and adds voices. Make-believe movies can follow a plan, meaning the cameras, characters, and effects are set up for playback in real time. Unlike other types of movies, the plan is driven by events and not keyframes.\\nMake-believe movies have different ways of doing things than other movie types. This is according to Make-believe.org. For example, make-believe videos can be shot live or follow a real-time plan. So it becomes much faster to make than traditionally animated movies.\\nMake-believe movies can stay close to their game roots and show fun gameplay. Popular types include dance videos, funny videos, and story videos. Alternatively, some filmmakers try to push the limits of the game engines or to hide the original game context. The Academy of Make-believe Arts & Sciences (AMAS), a group that helps promote make-believe movies, recognizes great productions through awards given at its yearly Make-believe Movie Festival. Some big movie parties like to watch computer game movies, and game makers, such as EG company, BE company and J company, have given prizes for making them.\\\nThe AM group says computer game movies are \"making movies inside a computer world\". In other ways of making computer movies, makers can control every move of their characters but, they must think about things like key moves and filling moves. Computer game movie makers let the computer decide many details, but this might limit what they can do. Because game movies focus on exciting actions, the range of character feelings is often limited. However, Kevin, Matthew, and Liam say that a small range of feelings is often enough, like in famous JA country cartoons.\nAnother difference is that computer game movies are made in real time, but other cartoons are made before. Real-time engines need to be quick and use simple methods and models. In a famous cartoon from 2001, every hair on a character's head was different; real-time needs would likely make them act as a single unit. Kevin, Matthew, and Liam think that better home computer graphics will allow more real-looking things; For cut scenes in video games, things other than how real it looks are important. Pre-made scenes can need more computer storage space, break the feeling of realness through contrast with real-time animation of normal gameplay, and limit interaction.\nLike real movies, computer game movies are made in real-time, and real people can act and control the camera. People who make movies are often told to follow certain rules, like not making the picture too wide, not making things move too slow, and making sure everything looks right. Unlike real movies, these movies are made with less expensive, digital effects and settings, maybe with a space or old-time theme. Big booms and tricks can be tried and done again without spending money or getting hurt, and the movie environment may allow things that can't really happen. A group of smart people at CA university tried to use this movie-making method to recreate a scene from an old movie from the late 20th century. This kind of movie-making was different from regular movie-making because the characters couldn't show many feelings, but the camera could move in more ways and be used in the moment. Nathan compared this experiment to an unpredictable DO movie-making style.\nBenjamin sees this kind of movie-making as \"a weird mix, looking to the future and past, new and old at the same time\". This kind of movie-making is a digital method based on 3-D computer games, but most works tell a story in a straight line. Some, like \"RE vs. BE\" and \"TH Sitcom\", follow the story rules of TV funny shows. Nathan agrees that recorded movies tend to be straight and offer limited interactive storytelling; he sees more chances in movies performed live and with audience interaction. In creating their funny series \"ON the TR with Larry & Lenny Logmen\" and talk show \"TR5hTa1k with ILL William\", the ILL group mixed real and virtual performance by creating the works on-stage and interacting with a live audience. In another mix of real and virtual worlds, Chris's talk show \"TH Soldier Life\" takes place in \"HA2\"s open multiplayer environment. There, others who are playing might try to talk to the person in charge or the person they are talking to. Even though other pretend performances have happened in chat rooms and pretend worlds, this adds \"movie-like views\". Before, these pretend performances with people watching were only in places that had big computers.\nThis can be less costly than other ways of making movies. A group made its long movie \"BS\" for less than a lot of money. Before using this, Benjamin and Matthew spent a lot of money to make a real movie; in contrast, the four game machines used to make \"RB\" in 2005 cost less. The low cost caused a person who works for a big company to compare this to the low-budget movie \"BW\", without the need for cameras and actors. Because these are seen as easy ways to start, it has been called a \"making movies for everyone\". A person thinks more participation and a blurred line between maker and watcher against concerns that game copyrights limit making money and growth of this.\nIn comparison, people who use pre-made pretend platforms like SL have said that their productions can be made quite successfully with no cost at all. Creators like a woman named Charlotte, producer of the 48 Hour Film Project sector, have made more than 200 films using the platform. Charlotte's support of this has resulted in the involvement of film director Patrick who was a judge for the category and gave a big talk during the event.\nKevin, Matthew, and Liam talk about four main ways to make a kind of movie with a video game. From easy to hard, these are: letting the game's smart helpers do most things, making the game characters move like puppets, changing camera angles, and telling every character exactly what to do. The easiest way can be a bit tricky because the game's helpers might do something you don't expect, which can make it hard to follow a movie script. For example, when the group named Rooster Teeth made a movie called \"The Silly Neighborhood\" using a game that lets its helpers do a lot, they had to make many copies of each character for different moods. They picked different copies at different times to make the characters do the right things.\nIn the puppet way, the people making the movie act like the characters in the game; every person controls a character like in a game with friends. The person in charge can use the camera controls in the game, if they can. If not, they record video from the view of one or more people who move the characters like puppets. The puppet way lets people make things up on the spot and is familiar to people who play games, but needs more people than the other ways and is not as exact as telling every character exactly what to do. However, some games, like the \"Hero\" game series, only let people make movies using the puppet way. Matthew says the puppet way can be hard because other people can get in the way when you're trying to make a movie in a game with many people, and the people moving the characters might start playing the game for real, making a mess with pretend blood and pretend dead bodies. But, a man named Chris Burke likes to make his show \"This Hero's Life\" in these kind of tricky situations, which make his show special. Other shows made with puppets include \"OL with Larry & Liam Lumberjack\" and \"Red vs. Blue\". In a special way of making movies, actions are first recorded not as video clips. Then, artists can change the recordings to add cameras, change timing and light, and change where the story happens. This way is limited to the few tools that support it.\nA common way in video games, scripting is like giving exact directions to the game. A filmmaker can work alone this way, like Jack did in creating \"The Seal of NO\" (2000), the longest work of this kind at the time. But, making scripts perfect can take a lot of time. Unless you can see the changes right away, changes may need to be checked again, and changing parts around may be hard. In this way, Kevin, Matthew, and Liam compare scripting to stop-motion animation. Another downside is that, depending on the game, scripting capabilities may be limited or not there at all. MA, a tool included with \"Unreal Tournament 2004\", made scripting popular.\nWhen \"Diary of a Camper\" was made, no tools existed to turn demo files into movies. A boy named Ethan from the RA group made his own tools to move the camera and put together scenes from the \"QU game\". Later, tools made for editing the \"QU game\" movie came out, but now, people usually use normal video editing tools. For example, a man named Patrick put in single, all-white pictures into his work \"No Licence\" to make explosions look cooler. After making the \"\", the RO group used a special tool to add black bars at the top and bottom to hide the player's game screen.\n\nPeople who make these game movies have found different ways to show what the characters are feeling. In the \"HA game\", the characters all wear helmets that hide their faces. To make it clear who is talking, the RO group makes their characters move a little when they speak, which is something you also see in cartoons. Some people use special tools. For example, the ST group uses a tool called TO tool to make their characters show more feelings in the BI game called \"NE Nights\". In the same way, a woman named Alice used a \"group of faces\" for the characters in \"The Battle of XA\". Sometimes, the game companies give out these tools; like the EP group's tool for the \"UN game\" and the VA group's tool for the \"HA 2\" game. Another way is to add in things that aren't from the game, like how the NG group did by putting in drawn characters with more feelings on their faces into their 1999 movie \"BE Assassins\". You can do different things with a camera or be creative with making movies or acting. For example, Thomas was very smart with how he placed his camera and edited his movie to suggest love actions in his famous drama \"No Just a Story About Love\".", "hash": "d3a36f95b26282c55630a22e3cc60606c84228bfbf07baa93c4ec0d5b0b568e9"}

They were found near a place called BI town, close to YE place, in TO country a long time ago. \nThe only things we have from this creature are a dry skin, a body kept in a special liquid, and a head and jawbone. The head and jawbone come from different creatures. These things are kept in a big museum in BE city, in GE country.\nThe creature is as long as four toy cars lined up with a tail as long as one toy car. This tail is very short compared to the body (only 37% of the body length) and is a special feature. The creature is dark or grey brown on top and light grey brown on the bottom. Its ears are small and covered with hair. Its feet are a little bit hairy. The tail could be hairless or have a little bit of hair.\nIts front teeth have small lines on them. The nose is long and wide, the space between the eyes is wide, and the cheekbone is big.\nBecause of the shape of the skull, we think this creature probably ate insects. We don't know much about how this creature lived.\nThis creature has been moved between different groups of creatures since we found it. It looks a lot like another creature called \"LO\" which has been moved to a new group because of special information we have learned.

Some scientists did a study and said that \"LO animal\" might be related to a family of small animals. \nIn 2005, two scientists named Matthew and Cameron decided to put this animal in a new group. They thought it was part of the MU family of animals because it might be related to two other groups of small animals. But they also said that more studies need to be done to find out where \"LO animal\" really belongs.\nThe TO mouse is a very special animal that might be in danger or might not be here anymore. Some people thought it was gone because they couldn't find it when they looked for it. But others didn't agree because they thought the places where they looked for it were not the right places. Matthew and Cameron said that these kind of animals are hard to catch and we need to look more in the high places of the forest to see if it's still there.\nRight now, the IC organization says that they don't have enough information about the TO mouse.", "hash": "eb33da952fab76209802e4ef6f8ed33b9b960b736197bd327bcbc30cf5593cff"}

Many people think he was the most important writer in the 19th century who wrote in GE language.\\nThomas was born in NE town in a family who believed in God. When he was sixteen, he started to learn how to make medicine, just like his dad did. When he was 20, he wrote his first story (\"Henry's First Love\", now lost). His first story that people could read, \"Brother and Sister Love\", was in the \"BE Newspaper\" in December.\\nThomas first worked in DR city making medicine. Then he went back to his dad's shop in LE town. During this time, Thomas wrote for the LE Newspaper and translated stories from a famous writer. In 1843, he joined a club of writers in BE city where he met other famous writers like Thomas, Joseph, and George.\\nIn 1844, Thomas joined the PR army and went on his first trip to EN country. There, he learned about old songs from EN country. Soon after, he began to write songs himself. Around this time, he promised to marry his future wife, Emma, whom he first met when he was at school.\nHe was briefly involved in a big change that happened in 1848. In 1849, he stopped working as a potion maker and started to work full time as a news writer and book writer. To help his family, he worked as a writer for a group that wanted to help GE country. He focused on what was happening in EN country, and the group sent him to LO city for a few years. His wife and two sons joined him there. While still in LO city, he stopped working for the group and when he returned to BE city, he became the boss of a newspaper.\nHe wrote books about EN country, including \"A Summer in LO city\", \"From EN country, studies and letters\", and \"Beyond the TW river, pictures and letters from SC country\". At that time, people liked to read traditional stories from EN country. His poems and songs tell about the good old days in EN country.\nBack in GE country, Frank really liked the MB region. He was very happy about its old stories and liked how its main city, BE city, was growing. He liked the nature around BE city a lot, and he wrote about his walks there in a book.\n\nIn 1870, he stopped working at the \"KZ\" and started working for the \"VT\" (a paper). He did this job until he was older. He had already written about a big fight between PR country and DE country, and another big fight with AU country. Then he wrote about a big fight with FR country in 1870 and was caught. He was kept by the FR people for three months. He wrote about what happened to him in \"Prisoner in the War (1871)\"; after that he wrote about what he saw during the big fight in \"The War with FR 1870-71\" (1874-1876).\n\nWhen Frank was 57 years old, he started to do what he would be remembered for, writing stories. His great story about old times, \"Before the Storm\" (1878), was followed by more stories about people's lives, like \"The Cheater\" (1882), a story about a woman who did not stay true to her husband. This story was a bit too much for some people, so it took Frank two years to find someone who would print it. In his stories \"Mrs. Jenny\", \"Mistakes and Confusion\", and \"Effie\" (1894), he found his own way of writing. He wrote about the lives of rich people and regular people; his work was later called \"real but also a bit dreamy\". In \"The Big Story\" (1899), his last story, Frank made the story feel real and talked about important things that happen in PR country life.\nSee Thomas's 1910 writing, \"The Old Frank,\" in \"Writings of Many Years\" (Knopf, late 20th century).

{"idx": 40739, "text": "Brown Spider\nThe brown spider is a shy but can be scary spider that lives in NA country.\nThe name of the spider comes from words that mean \"slanted leg alone\". The \"slanted leg\" part comes from the fact that these spiders have their legs touching the ground at an angle instead of straight up and down. The \"alone\" part is because this spider is very shy and runs away from humans.\nThe brown spider can be light brown, dark brown, or even gray. Sometimes people call it the violin bug because its head has a dark mark that looks like a violin. Without its legs, it can grow to about this big. They have six eyes, which is a strange number of eyes for a bug.\n\nBoy and girl bugs can be known once the bug has changed its skin many times. Bugs have parts on their faces called feelers. The feelers on the boy bug have much bigger ends than the ones on girl bugs. These big feelers are the boy bug's special part. The girl bug has her special part on the bottom of her body. This is maybe the only way to easily tell a boy bug from a girl bug. People who learn about these bugs can even know the family of the bug by looking at the shapes of the special parts.\n\nThese bugs only live in the US. Bugs living in the SW part of the U.S. live in the woods, and bugs in the NE part live inside houses. These bugs like dry, dark places that have good hiding spots. Bugs in the wild live in hollow rotting tree trunks and logs. Bugs that live in houses usually like garages, basements, and attics. These are places where people are less likely to find them, and they have lots of good hiding places, like cardboard boxes.\nSometimes, people send boxes without looking inside for bugs. Brown bugs can hide inside these boxes and might live where the box is opened. But, bug friends have found brown bugs sent in boxes hardly ever start a new home in their new place, partly because there are no other brown bugs for them to be friends with. Sometimes brown bugs sent in boxes make homes in big storage places. However, they do not move very far from their home, which is usually not big in the new place.\nBrown bugs eat other bugs. They eat soft bugs (like moths or flies) and other spiders. They can eat each other. When making friends, a girl brown bug will try to eat the boy bug.\nWhen hunting, the brown bug slowly moves toward its food. Once it is close enough, it jumps on the food and bites it. Its teeth have a bad juice that stops the food very quickly.\nBrown bugs can go without food or water for a very long time. Some brown bugs can go for five times of the year with no food or water.\nBrown bugs are hunting bugs, so they spend most of the time on the ground. They hide during the day and sleep, and at night they come out to hunt. They usually do not climb unless they are running from something. They can walk upside-down, but most brown bugs walking on ceilings have probably come from the upstairs floor. Some bugs can't move their legs well when they walk, so they stop often to let blood move in their legs.\nBrown bugs are very good at living. They can go without eating or drinking for more than a year. They are also good at staying warm in houses during cold winters. If they get their leg stuck in something, like a crack or a mouth of a bigger animal, they can let go of the leg. The bug can still walk around with only four legs, as long as there is still one leg on each side.\nBecause these bugs are so good at living, it is very hard to make them go away. Sprays that kill bugs usually do not work well on them, except for some types that we are not allowed to use. A bug that has been sprayed might even act mean.\nBrown bugs are scared of people, and usually if they see one they stay still. If the person chases the brown bug, it will most often run and hide. Even though brown bugs are scared of people, it is not good to try to touch one, because their bite can hurt a lot.\nBrown bugs will normally only bite a person if the person is touching the bug or if the bug is stuck between the person and something else. Most bites from brown bugs happen when someone puts on clothes that have a brown bug living inside of them. For kids who have small brown spiders in their house, it's good to shake clothes that have been on the floor before wearing them. Also, they should be careful when walking in dark parts of the house like the attic or basement without shoes. Wearing socks or gloves can help because the spiders' teeth are very short. Most of the time, people who live with these spiders never see them and never get bitten. Good habits can help keep everyone safe.\nPeople have been afraid of these small brown spiders since they were found in the late 20th century. Some people do a lot of things to get them out of their houses. Spider experts found out that a bite from this spider could sometimes cause a bad infection. Sometimes this infection can be very dangerous, but it's rare and most of the time, the bites from these spiders are not worse than a normal spider bite. The spider's bite is most dangerous for young kids or people who are bigger.\nIt's common for people who have been bitten by spiders to go to the doctor without the spider that bit them. When this happens, the doctor has to guess what kind of spider bit the person. The small brown spider is often blamed because its name is well-known, but it's not often that this spider was actually involved. Guessing by doctors has made many people believe these spiders live in places they don't, like CA state, even though this is not true. It is quite often that a big brown spider might bite someone and that person might not feel it for many hours or even days. In most cases, either the person was sick or a different kind of spider bit the person and the doctor gets it wrong when he or she thinks it was a big brown spider.\nWe don't know much about the icky stuff from the big brown spider, and people who know a lot about spiders have been looking for a long time for ways to tell if a big brown spider has bitten someone and a medicine to make it better.", "hash": "031602e6247212f7725d33bc2efe88a4400548e3320620fe6c8ee4569b6fde9c"}

{"idx": 64058, "text": "Play Place\\nA Play Place was a building in an old place called GR. This is where kids learned and practiced wrestling. It had a big square or rectangle yard. The yard was open to the sky. It was surrounded by tall columns. Off these columns were places to change clothes, places to learn, places to take a bath, and places to keep things. Kids practiced under the columns in all kinds of weather.\\nPlay Places were often close to workout places. Sometimes, they were part of the workout place. Many places in a faraway land had a special building. Big places had many. Some people owned these buildings. Most were made with money from the people. These buildings were a big part of the everyday lives of men and boys. Some men loved the building they grew up in as much as some men today love their school. Some men were put to rest in their favorite building.\nA special building was a place in an old land where people learned and did wrestling. The word for this building means wrestling. From a long time ago until a less long time ago, these buildings were made all over the land. The earliest ones belonged to some people, but later on, ones that were for everyone were made. Almost every place had at least one of these buildings and some big places had many.\nThese special buildings were often near or part of bigger buildings. The bigger building probably first showed up a long time ago. Both were often just called \"the big building\". An old writer named Peter writes that a special building was used only for wrestling and a sport like wrestling but much tougher. Boxing was learned and done in the big building. People who used to be athletes owned and ran small special buildings. Boys and grown-up men from GR country would go to a place called palaestras. Old men had their own special palaestras.\nVictor was a man who made buildings in the time of a powerful man named Adam. He made a plan for the perfect palaestra in his book about building things. This palaestra is like the one in OL city, a place in GR country where they had big games a long time ago. Victor's palaestra has a big yard open to the sky. This yard is surrounded by covered walkways.\nThe yard would have been filled with places called \"skammata\" where people who wrestle would have practiced. A \"skamma\" was an area where the ground had been dug up and covered with a lot of sand to make a firm place for the wrestlers. Because people who wrestle might have had to play in the rain, there were two \"skamma\" in the palaestra: a dry one and a wet one. People who wrestle called the mud in the wet \"skamma\" \"sticky stuff\".\nThe people who wrestle themselves dug up the ground and sand with a tool. This was considered a good exercise and the tool became a sign for wrestling in pictures from GR country. It is likely the wet \"skamma\" was located under the covered walkways to keep it from drying out. Long ago, people from GR country thought that mud and oil could help make you feel better. They used to put it in big holes in the ground.\\nThere was a big yard with one row of pillars on three sides and two rows of pillars on the north side. These two rows of pillars would keep the room behind them safe from the sun and rain. This yard was a place for learning and exercising. There was a special room called the \"E room\". This is where young boys would learn about GR country's ways. There would be stone seats along the walls.\\nNext to the \"E room\", there were three more rooms: one for boxing bags, one for dust and powder, and one for bathing. On the other side of the \"E room\", there was a room for keeping oil, and some rooms with a furnace and hot baths. Hot baths were very important in RO country but they did not have them at OL place because there was not enough water there. The baths at OL place were simple but the ones at DE place were big and fancy.\\nThere would also be a room for getting changed. People would exercise without their clothes on. There might also be a room for playing with a ball, but it's not clear whether this room was used for playing games, keeping things, or more exercise.\nOn rainy days, kids learned and played wrestling games under the roof that covered the yard. Close to the yard were rooms for changing clothes, rooms for washing, rooms for keeping things, and rooms for talking and meeting friends. \n\nIn this play area, there was a picture of Harry, who was the boss of the wrestling games. Harry was shown on a piece of stone as a head and a funny part of his body. Harry was the boss of wrestling games and was sometimes said to be the dad of Patty, the boss of the wrestling games. In art, a picture of Harry often means the scene is a wrestling play area.\n\nWrestling was a favorite game in a very old time. It was less rough than boxing or another game, needed less space than other games, and, as a result, was the most liked game among players. We can find many stories about this game in the old books, especially in poems.\n\nBoys and men of all ages joined these play areas, just like modern boys and men join places to play games or keep fit. The old-time men loved the places where they played games and some were even buried in their favorite place. These places could also be a center for important talks: a plan to free a place from another place was made in a play area and a plan against another place found its supporters in the play areas.\nSome people were not allowed in the play area. These included the \"old helpers\" who took young boys to the play area and waited for them near the front door. Other people not allowed in the play area included girls and women, people who couldn't walk, people who drank too much, people who made things, people who sold things, people who used to be helpers, people who didn't think right, and people who didn't behave well. Sometimes, people got hurt in the play area. One boy fell on a hard place and got very hurt. He was not okay and went to sleep forever after ten days.\nEvery play area had a number of strong young men called \"helpers\". They waited around offering to play wrestling with others for some coins. These young men were called \"statues\". Wrestling one was known as \"hugging a statue\". These young men were not very respected.\nIn a place where men, young men, and boys were without clothes, some people behaved in a way that wasn't nice. The people in charge tried to stop it, but they couldn't. Some drawings on old vases of boys in the play area show them teasing each other or older men giving gifts like small animals to the boys. In a story, the wise man Samuel is pulled into a play area by a group of teenagers. They tell him that one of them likes another. Most boys thought that liking another boy in this way was an okay thing in the play area. Samuel tells us that Ethan was liked as much as Henry and Harry in the playground.", "hash": "a42735dc8481bde4e9fba9ff9f78bccf0f0897c8d4c6ab3d56f8ba95abbbf8e7"}

The man could not remember things that happened after his visit to the doctor, and he also forgot things that happened just before his visit. But, he could remember things from a long time ago, even from when he was a small child.\nThis made a lot of people very interested. Later, other people who also could not remember things were studied. Many tests were done to see how the brain changes when it is used. The brain does help us remember things, but it's still not clear how it does this.\nRecent talks tell us how the brain helps us remember things that happened in the past, and helps us remember parts of big events.\nWhen a rat is in a certain place, its brain shows this. Just like with memory, almost everyone agrees that knowing where we are is important for the brain, but people don't agree on the details.\nTests done on rats and mice that can move around have shown that their brain knows when they are in a certain place. In people, the brain knows where we are too. This was shown in a test where people with a big illness had special things put in their brain. Then a computer was used to move them around in a pretend town.\nThe finding of place cells a long time ago led to a thought that the brain might act like a map a picture in the brain of where things are. The \"map in the mind idea\" is more understood now because of recent finds in small animals. These finds show there are parts in the brain that helps the animal know which way to go. These parts are very connected to a brain part called the hippocampus.\nThe hippocampus looks mostly the same in many animals, from echidna to humans. The size of the hippocampus compared to the size of the animal grows bigger: it is about twice as big for humans as for the echidna. However, it does not grow as fast as the neocortex part of the brain. So, the hippocampus takes up a bigger part of the brain in small animals than in humans.\nOther animals have parts that might be like the hippocampus of mammals. Some bugs, and sea animals like the octopus, are very good at learning places and finding their way. These skills seem to work differently from the way mammals do it, and have become this way on their own.", "hash": "6b67126c44a29bb55a8b19a9be6b496b5dbd1b7cdc637d82eda5119618d6e7b2"}

Like when a toy rolls off a table and falls down to the floor.\\nFalling is moving to a place where an object will be lower. Being lower means the object is closer to the ground.\\nThe word \"down\" is used a lot when we talk about falling. What is down? Down may be straight towards your feet, or if you are on a hill, be off at an angle. People often say down is towards the middle of the Earth. But that only makes sense when we are on Earth. In space, somewhere between the Earth and it's moon, an object may fall to the earth or fall to the moon. At other places an object may fall towards the Sun or a planet like Jupiter. In other places far, far away, things can fall into the space between stars and planets. When we talk about falling, we usually mean because of something called gravity. What if something has an electric charge? If you rub a balloon on your hair and hold it near the ceiling, it will \"fall\" upwards. Things that have an electric charge don't always fall down because of gravity, but because of electric forces. (This is good because without it, our electronics would not work and life would not even be possible.) Just like things fall in gravity, things with an electric charge will fall to a place where they feel less pull. Things that are attracted to magnets will fall in a magnetic field to a place where they feel less pull.\n\nFalling down is a very common way that people can get hurt. It happens a lot, especially to older people, people who have trouble with balance, and to people who do things like sports that involve a lot of moving around.\n\nOlder people sometimes are not as steady when they walk. If they fall, they can get really hurt, like breaking a bone, because their bones are not as strong.\n\nWhen you do fun things like riding a bike or a skateboard, you can fall more easily. Some people who ride bikes or skateboards wear special clothes to protect their bodies if they fall, like a helmet, elbow pads, and knee pads.", "hash": "0c2349280a12f7fdf69a2bc4c17fba8132fd5e6c25adbe1fc37b1b1c1e6cb662"}

King Adam, also called Great Adam, was the king of what is now BE country. His mother was Gabriel\u2019s second wife.\\nMost stories tell us that Thomas was born on a farm at HD city in SA city. Thomas\\nWe don't know when Thomas was born. People think it might have been on All Saints' Day because his name, \"Thomas\", sounds like \"all saints'\" in a language called FR country. When a big fight called the Revolution started, he was probably around 50 years old. Different books say he was born between 1739 and 1746. When he was a little boy, he was not very big or strong. But when he grew up, he was known for being really strong and good at riding horses.\nMost books tell us that Thomas learned a lot from his godfather, Patrick. By the time he was 20, he could speak three languages - FR country, a language called Creole and a little bit of another language called Latin. He also knew a lot about plants that can make you feel better.\nThomas married Suzanne Simone in 1782. Suzanne might have been his cousin. People think that he had 16 children, and that 11 of them had passed away before he did. His oldest son was adopted. The two sons he had with Suzanne were named Isaac and Samuel.\nThomas was known for being a slave until the start of the Revolution. He became free when he was 33 years old.\nWhen he was free, he became richer and started to own more land. He made a lot of money during the Revolution and he owned a lot of properties.\nDuring his life, people thought Thomas followed the rules of the RO Church. But he also followed a special kind of spirituality that was practiced on the BR farm. It was mixed with a big group that believed in God. We don't know if Thomas was part of these big groups. When he was the leader of SD island (now known as HA island), he said he wasn't.\nThomas was part of a group called Freemasons. People who study history think this because he used a special symbol in his name when he wrote it.\nSD island (which is now HA island) was the biggest maker of sugar in the world and gave sugar to many places. It had more than 800 places where they grew sugar. There were a few rich families and many, many people who were brought from AF country and made to work very hard. There were so many of these people that they were more than everyone else. To stop these people from fighting back and taking over, the FR people used very bad ways to keep them under control.\nThe big change in HA island started when the FR people who owned the places where they grew sugar wanted to be independent. But the people who were made to work wanted something different; they wanted to be free. In a year long ago, about 100,000 of these workers fought back. They burned all the sugar plants and hurt many of the people who owned them. In the beginning, Thomas did not join. But after some weeks, he took his family to a safe place in SD island and helped the people who were in charge of the BR farm to leave the island, if we believe old papers that are still here.\nThomas was one of the leaders of this big change. He was part of talks about plans. He talked with the SP people who helped the fighters, because they gave food to the people who were no longer working. In 1801 he moved to SD place and became the leader. He set the workers free and made a list of rules for SD place.\nWhen Napoleon became the leader in FR country, he took back the plantations on ST island. In a winter month of 1802, soldiers from FR country came to ST island to find Thomas. When Napoleon told Thomas that he wanted ST island back, Thomas said that he would give it back if he would stop the workers from working forever. Napoleon agreed and took Thomas with him to PA city to talk more about it.\nEven after the talk, the people from FR country later said that Thomas was planning another fight against the owners. He was put in a cold place in the mountains. The place was called FO place. Ten months after he was put there, on a spring day in 1803, Thomas passed away.\nAfter he was gone, the work on HA island started again, but it was not the same. Thomas had made people think about the work, and the workers continued to fight the rich FR country owners in a strong way. This led to another big change. Thomas's friend, Jack, took over Thomas's job in the big change after he passed away. Jack became the first leader of HA country. Later, he was attacked and passed away too.\nBut before Jack passed away, a bad sickness killed lots of FR people who were trying to stop the big change in HA country. On a winter day, ST country was renamed as HA country and Jack said it was free. In this way, HA country became the first place in the world ruled by dark-skinned people, and the first place to become free from EU rule.", "hash": "2df670f92f9bad03fe481e84ca3ec0730c89a098f6361ef38889803c76b9efc8"}

{"idx": 6817, "text": "Playing with Tiny Things\nPlaying with Tiny Things is about learning really tiny pieces of stuff, known as tiny things. These tiny things are the really small pieces that build up everything we see. They are best understood with counting and simple numbers.\nTiny things can carry important powers. For example, the power that makes things light up is carried by light bits. The four important powers are responsible for almost everything in all of playing with tiny things. These important powers are the pull that keeps us on the ground, the power that makes things light up, the weak power, and the strong power.\nOne of the important ideas of playing with tiny things is called the Standard Game. The Standard Game is a way which tries to explain the important powers. The Standard Game combined with the big pull is currently the most accepted way of how everything works.\nThe Standard Game is known to have problems. For example, it explains three of the four powers very well, but it cannot explain the pull that keeps us on the ground. This is why the big pull, a different way that explains where the pull that keeps us on the ground comes from, needs to be included in order for people to explain everything. There are many smart people who are working hard to understand things better. They want to know more about tiny things we can't see, like particles. They think and make up ideas to make our understanding better. Just like we have different guesses about what's inside a wrapped gift.\nPeople who study these tiny things learn more by making them bump into each other. It's like when two toy cars crash into each other, we can see what's inside if they break apart. That's how these people look inside particles.\nWhen these tiny things move really fast and hit each other, they can break. When they break, they become even tinier things. These tinier things are hard to find because they change quickly. People who study these use a special tool to make the particles hit each other very fast. This is like a racing track for particles, where they run really fast.\nBut, not all these tiny things break when they hit each other, like a very tiny thing called electron. If you make two electrons hit each other very fast, they don't break. Instead, they might make more tiny things around them. People believe there are 17 types of these tiny things, but there could be twice as many because they can all be created out of something else.\nLearning about tiny things called particles can help us understand how the world began. This is because we can create similar conditions to how the world was in the beginning (which was a lot busier and more active than it is now) in a small space by making these particles bump into each other. The biggest machine in the world that can do this is at CE place in EU country.", "hash": "0a2e59d1fb21981dad534ee084f444ad69142c50cc955713f79d62801eed4757"}

{"idx": 76368, "text": "Planets far away\nThe planet named Neptune was found a long time ago. After this, many people thought that there might be more planets, which are even further away from the sun than Neptune. A long time ago, a man named Patrick thought that there must be another planet-like thing, even further than Neptune. Patrick said that this could explain some strange things about the paths of the big gas planets, like Uranus and Neptune. The pull of a big unseen ninth planet could have moved Uranus enough to explain the strange things. He called it \"Planet X\".\nIn the early 20th century, a man named Cameron found Pluto. This seemed to show that Patrick was right. Pluto was officially thought of as the ninth planet until quite recently. There was a problem, though: In the late 20th century, Pluto was found to be too small. It wouldn't be strong enough to affect the big gas planets. This made people start looking for a tenth planet. A big spaceship called VO 2 gave new measurements in the early 1990s. These measurements showed that Pluto was even smaller than they thought before. According to a study published at the time, the mistake could explain the strange things seen in Uranus's path. After the study was published, people mostly stopped looking.\nAfter a time long ago, people found many small icy things that are far, far away, just like 'P' (we've changed the name Pluto to 'P' to make it simpler). Some people started to wonder if 'P' should still be called a planet, or if it and its friends should have their own special name. Some of the bigger ones were called planets at first, but then in the 2000s, a group of star-watchers said that 'P' and its biggest friends are now called small planets, which means there are only eight real planets left where we live. 'P' became the example of what a small planet is.\n\nNowadays, most star-watchers agree that Planet X, a name they used for a planet they thought might exist, is not real. But some star-watchers still use the idea of Planet X to help explain other strange things they see far away in space. In books, movies, and even for some star-watchers, \"Planet X\" is a name they use for any planet they haven't found yet, no matter what. Other planets far, far away have also been guessed at, because of other clues.\n\nEven farther than the planet named 'N' (we've changed the name Neptune to 'N' to make it simpler), there is a place called the 'K' belt (we've changed the name Kuiper to 'K' to make it simpler). It has things called centaurs. There are also things called 'Plutinos' found far away. Many of these were found between 1980 and the time long ago.\n\nIn the 2000s, people started talking again about this when 'S' (we've changed the name Sedna to 'S' to make it simpler) was found, which is twice as far from the sun than 'P'. But 'S' is not a planet. In 2005, they found 'E' (we've changed the name Eris to 'E' to make it simpler). This was first called a big round thing in the sky; but later they changed what they called it. Now, it is the biggest of the small round things in the sky. They found many other things, but none of these are made of hard rock like our Earth, they are more like big rocks and comets floating in the sky.\nAs of a time not too long ago, some people think there might be another big round thing in the sky far away from a big round thing called NE. If it is real, it would have to be like this:\nPeople have different ideas: A pretend star, very far away, has been named \"Nemesis\". Nemesis might be a red or a brown star. In the first story, it was said that Nemesis would go around the sun very far away. The idea of Nemesis could explain why some things on Earth seem to disappear every now and then. But, we don't really need Nemesis to explain these disappearances. There are actually fewer brown stars near us than we thought before. Instead of one star for every brown star, there might be as many as six stars for every brown star. Most of the stars like our sun are by themselves.\nA pretend big round thing, very far away in the clouds of the sky has been named \"Tyche\". Tyche would be at least as big as the biggest round thing in our sky, and could be up to ten times as big. At first, they thought it would be many, many times farther away than NE, at a very far distance.\nIn a year not long ago, no one could prove if this or that was true.", "hash": "3e3c8619cd80d320d87305450c03b3c2e1d597f88e013bda46ed656f293d6668"}

{"idx": 15678, "text": "Jack\nJack was a man from BE town, who was born on a late autumn day. He was a man who fixed things, talked a lot, and wrote books. He wrote a very famous book about a man trying to be good. This book is very special because it has been translated into many languages, only the Holy Book has been translated into more languages. \n\nIn the story, all the people and things mean something good or bad. During Jack's time, everyone had to believe what the EN church said. But Jack did not agree with some of the things the EN church said. He started to talk about his thoughts and got into trouble for it. He was put in a place for people who break rules because of what he believed. He wrote his famous book while he was there.\n\nJack's dad fixed pots and pans. Jack's family had been living in BE town since a long time ago. They had less and less of their things and were not rich. Jack's dad had a small house and a little bit of land. He did not know how to read or write.\nJack only went to school for a few years. He learned how to fix pots and pans from his dad.\nThere was a lot of fighting in EN country when Jack was a kid. Many people did not like King Charles I so there was a big fight and the king was not king anymore. For a few years EN country was a republic, ruled by Oliver.\nWhen Jack was 16 years old, he joined the army at NE town (1644 - 1647). After that, he started to work as a pot and pan fixer, and in 1649, he got married. His wife had two books, both were about God. Jack started to think a lot about God. He was very scared because he knew he had done bad things, and he wondered whether God would forgive him, so that he would go to heaven when he died, or whether he would be punished and go to a bad place. The kind of things he did which at that time were thought to be bad were not things which would worry many people nowadays: making church bells ring, dancing, playing games on Sundays and, perhaps the worst of all, saying bad words. Other bad things he had done before included not being nice to his parents, and not feeling sorry for not helping his mom and sister - which he did by not helping at home. He did not have money to spend time with bad women, even though he wanted to join the fun and \"pretty women\" who went to fairs and other public events. In his book \"A famous story\", Ben talked about himself as the \u201cChief of Naughty Boys\u201d. He tells how one day he was walking along when he heard a group of women talking to one another about being good. This made him think about these things.\nIn those days, people were supposed to say thank you to God in the England's Church. There were, however, groups of people who wanted to say thank you to God in different ways. These people were called \u201cdifferent thinkers\u201d. In 1653, a group of different thinkers had taken over St Jack\u2019s Church in BE city. Their leader was Jack Gifford, now known as Jack. Ben talked a lot about the big holy book with Jack.\nBen lived in EL town, near BE city, until a time in the mid 17th century, when his wife passed away. He moved to BE city to be nearer to Jack\u2019s church . He married again a few years later. In 1660, the Restoration of the Monarchy took place: England had a king once more: Charles, now known as Cameron. It was bad for religious freedom, because all different thinker's meetings were forbidden. St Jack\u2019s Church had to become part of the England's Church again. Ben refused to go to church. He started to talk to groups of people anywhere they could meet: in barns or in the streets. Because he did not have permission to talk, he was arrested and put in a place where people who do wrong things are kept. At first, he had to stay in a bad place for a little while, but because he didn't say he would stop talking about what he believed, he stayed there for 12 years.\nBenjamin stayed in the bad place from the time when the big hand on the clock pointed to 12 and then 12 times around again. He was also there for a little while when the big hand on the clock pointed to 12 and then 7 times around. The bad place was at the top of a street in the middle of BE city, very close to his house on CU street, which was on the edge of the town. The bad place had 6 rooms and 2 dark places. He could have left any time if he promised to stop talking about what he believed, but he did what he thought was right. He made some money in the bad place by making things to tie shoes. His oldest daughter Mary, who couldn't see, brought him hot food every day and gave him books to read. Sometimes, it seems like he was allowed to leave the bad place for a little while. This wasn't really allowed, but often, the people watching might let a person out if they promised to come back. Benjamin even went as far as LO city once, and he must have gone home sometimes because he had two more children with his second wife during that time.\nIt was during this time in the bad place that he wrote his storybook: \"a famous storybook\". We don't know if he wrote it all while he was in the bad place. The book is in two parts. The first part ends with the words: \u201cSo I woke up, and it was all a dream\u201d. When the second part starts, he says \"..as I slept I dreamt again\". This could mean that he wrote the second part in 1677 when he was in a big trouble again. This is only a guess, we do not know.\nBenjamin got out of trouble in the first month of 1672, when Charles II said everyone could pray to God in their own way. The king did this mainly because he wanted the CA people to have less power. Different groups could register and get a paper that said it was okay. Benjamin became the leader of the BE church. In the third month of 1675, he got in trouble again for talking about God (because Charles II took back what he said about praying). This time he seems to have been in the BE town trouble place on the big stone bridge over the river OU. After a few months, he was let out. He was a very popular speaker, so he was not in trouble again. His book \"A Famous Journey\" came out in 1678. He also wrote several other books about God, but \"A Famous Journey\" was the one that everyone liked. Because Benjamin did not go to a big school he wrote in a very simple way which ordinary people could understand. A part from Part Two of \"A Famous Journey\" beginning \"Who would true Bravery see\" is sung a lot as a song.\nOn his way to LO city, in 1688, he got very sick from small animals, and died a hard death. His resting place is in a place where people are buried in LO city.", "hash": "bf22e023dea696ae6582ed39c678cf00e441bd1ea0370b28671365ae4582ce50"}

These trips helped him to learn and understand new ways of doing things.\n\nAfter four years, he came back to his home, PI city. He took care of farming and money matters. He worked to have more schools. During that time, his work and bank activities made him one of the richest men in PI city.\n\nFrom 1832 to 1848, Cameron was the leader of GR town (now called \"GR Cameron town\" to honor him). In 1847, he started a newspaper \"The Rise\". According to him, the way to make things better and help people, which he had been working on for years, could only happen after changing the way things are run.\n\nIn 1850, Cameron became famous because he supported a new rule called \"SI Rule\" that made the church people less powerful. In the same year, the main leader of SA country, Matthew, picked him to be in charge of farming, business and boats. Later he also took care of money matters. After Matthew left his job on a day in November, 1852, Cameron became the main leader of SA country.\n\nCameron's plans wanted to make SA country a place with good rules based on new and improving ideas and so he worked hard to change the way money was made. He made farming better and helped factories, and encouraged trading with big EU countries. However, his big plans were not liked by some people. Some thought he didn't care enough for people who didn't have much. Others thought he was breaking old ways of doing things.\nIn 1858, he made a promise with the FR country to work together against the AU country. The next year, a big war happened in IT country. They won against the AU country, who were in charge of IT country at that time.\nAfter a big peace meeting and George's big journey in the South (1860-1861), IT country became one country. Cameron became the first leader of the united IT country. He was also the first person in charge of talking to other countries. He was the leader of the free-thinking group in the government.

They work in hospitals, in doctor's offices, and they help people in their homes if those people can't go out.\nSometimes, people want to be nurses instead of doctors because nurses can help patients directly. They talk to them, do things they need, watch them carefully, and see them get better.\nLike doctors, nurses can choose what kind of work they do. Some nurses learn and work to help during operations. Some helpers learn how to make people understand about eating healthy (what to eat), and sickness (what can make people not feel good). Helpers can do many different jobs to make people feel better.\nWe need a lot of helpers because there are not enough of them to take care of everyone in the hospital. Because of this, sometimes helpers will go to another place to work for a little while. This is called travel helping.\nIn some places like US country, a helper has a special name if they have finished their training. In hospitals where helpers wear special clothes with hats, you can tell who has finished their training because their hat has two black lines.\nIn AU country, helpers are called \"Registered Helpers\" or \"Enrolled Helpers\". Both have to learn a lot after they finish school. An Enrolled Helper has to study for 12 to 18 months. Registered Helpers need to finish a big school course.\nThe names have changed because boys and girls can both be helpers. Before, only girls could be helpers. The names were for girls and now they are for boys and girls. The only name that hasn't changed is midwife, because people think that a helper who helps a mom when she has a baby should be a girl. But, there are some boys who are midwives too. The group that watches over helpers in UK country is the Helping and Midwifery Council.\nSome doctor and helper groups work together as a team. This means that the same group of people always work together, which makes it less likely for mistakes to happen, and lets new helpers learn and understand better.\nAlso, moving around as a team lets special groups help more than one hospital. This is really helpful when there is so much work to do in one area that we can't have a whole team in every hospital.", "hash": "53df865bb9658339153ff37fdadfe6f097c9f1d176efa63ee6d10fdf9d7fa54b"}

{"idx": 23083, "text": "Bowling\nBowling is a game where people roll a heavy ball. It was made a long time ago when heavy iron balls were used. Two main kinds of bowling were created. In one game, you roll a ball close to a target and try to push away another player's ball. This game is called lawn bowling.\nIn another game that is very common these days, you roll the ball down a wooden path to try and knock down some pins. This game includes ten-pin bowling, which is so common that people often just call it \"bowling\". Some people play a similar game with smaller pins, called \"duck pins\" or \"candle pins\", and the rules are a little different.\nThe ball used in this game usually has three holes. You put two fingers and your thumb in these holes. Then, you swing the ball and let it roll down the path, trying to knock down ten wooden pins. If you don't do it right, the ball might not knock down all the pins, or it might roll into the side and hit none. Players take turns rolling their ball down the path to see who can get the highest score.\nIn ten-pin bowling, the score can be as low as 0 or as high as 300. Players get 10 turns to try and knock down all of the pins; each turn is called a frame. In each frame, players can try to knock down all of the pins up to two times. Players who do not knock down all of the pins after two tries get up to 9 points for the frame. One point is given for every pin knocked down. If players can knock down all of the pins on the first or second try, they get 10 points for the frame plus some bonus points. Frames in which a player knocks down all of the pins on the first try are scored as a strike. When you knock all the pins down on your first try, that's called a strike. A strike gives you 10 points plus the points you get on your next two tries. If you knock all the pins down on your second try, that's called a spare. A spare gives you 10 points plus the points you get on your next try.\nIf you get a strike or a spare on your last turn, you get to roll the ball two more times to get extra points. This is the only time you can get both a strike and a spare. You can also get 3 strikes in this last turn.", "hash": "f8d8dfa396cf7ff3736d2832370c05a5a72c79635541de5740f1b16bf4d4d725"}

It has big flat outside areas, and some of them go straight out and hang right over the waterfall or the stream. There are windows and doors made of glass, with only thin supports between them, all around the living room.

It says that if we keep watching something happen over and over again, the average result will not change much in the end.

He said it was so easy to understand that even a very silly person would know it was true. Even so, it took him over 20 years to explain it in a way that made sense to everyone.

In the old times, a man named Samuel talked about a big idea called \"the rule of big numbers\".

Both AS gods and VA gods married them. There are two kinds of giants: cold giants and fire giants.\nThere were many other magical beings in these stories. These include:\nA lot of these old stories were told by word of mouth through poems, and many of them have been lost. Some of them were written down by people who believed in Jesus. The oldest records we have come from two books by a man named Samuel, but the stories are much older than that.\nThere are also several big stones with pictures on them that show us scenes from these old stories, like a man named Thomas fishing and a man named Oliver being eaten by a big wolf.\nThese old gods have changed small parts of everyday life in many places where people speak similar languages. For example, some of the names of the days of the week. The days were first named after Roman gods (named after \"Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn\"). The names for Tuesday through Friday were changed to the old names of the Roman gods. In English, Saturn was not replaced. Saturday is named after a rest day in GE country, and is called \"cleaning day\" in SC region.\nA famous book called \"The King of the Rings\" by a man named Jack was inspired by these old stories. As the book became popular, parts of its magical world became part of how people see magic and fantasy. In almost any new fantasy book, you can find creatures like elves, dwarves, and giants from these old stories.", "hash": "38c7f908620369757d276c932f97349a6f7acfa7cd46b94297956434d9b00470"}

{"idx": 452, "text": "Football Game\\nFootball game is a game played between two teams. It was started in EN country, and is played in most places. In the US country and CA country, it is called soccer. In most other places it is called football. Football game is the most liked game in the world.\\nThere were different tries to make the rules of football game in EN country in the old days. The rules we use now started in 1863 when they were chosen in RU city, WA city by the new Football Club.\\nEach team has 11 players playing. One of these players is the goalkeeper, and the other ten are known as \"players\". The game is played by kicking a ball into the other team's goal. A game has a long time of play, with a rest in the middle. The rest in the middle is called \"half-time\". Extra time may be added after half time or after the long time to make up for time lost during the game because of breaks, free kicks, corner kicks, boo-boos, changes, or any other time the game is stopped. If a game ends in a tie, extra-time with two parts of 15 minutes each may be played, and if there is still a tie, a penalty shootout decides the winner. Sometimes extra-time is skipped and the game goes right into the penalty shootout.\\nThere are many competitions for football, for both football clubs and places. Football clubs usually play other teams in their own place, with a few exceptions. Here are a few special things:\nFootball teams also play with other teams in their own big place in games like the Big Game and the Big Champions Game.\nThere are 6 big groups (Big Group One, Big Group Two, Big Group Three, Big Group Four, Big Group Five, and Big Group Six). Each group has their own big game between teams and countries. Some examples are the Big Cup for Big Group Two countries and the Big Champions Cup for Big Group Two teams. The Big Football Group organises big games between teams from all over the world. Teams play in the Big Club World Cup, and countries play for the Big World Cup.\nThe Big World Cup happens every four years between countries, and is the most liked game in the world, even more liked than the Big Games. In football, there are two main types of games. In a \"league\", all of the teams play the same number of games, but in a \"cup\", teams stop playing when they lose, until the last two teams play each other to find out who is the best.\nFootball is the most liked game in the world. It is played in more places than any other game. In fact, the Big Football Group has more members than the Big World Group. It was first a game for boys, but today it is played by both boys and girls (separately, except sometimes in little school).\nIn EN country, the main games to play are the CH game for the best teams from each country in EN. Then there is the UE game which is for the next best teams from each member country of the UE.\nThe best club in the world, in terms of local game results, is the team from SC country, who have won more local game titles than any other team in the world. They have won the country's game 54 times which is a world record. In the early 21st century, the team became the first team to win 100 trophies. Other successful clubs are FC team and RE team from SP country, BA team and BO team from GE country, GA team from TU country, JU team and NA team from IT country, LI team and MA team from EN country, PA team from FR country, and AL team from EG country.", "hash": "ea9f7f61498686f0d9d69cd1b9f90ade267c86481a1a4016ad34acd1ac6f718c"}

{"idx": 18730, "text": "Girls singing\\nA girls singing group is when a group of girls sing songs together.\\nThe word \"girls singing group\" is also used to talk about girls who sang pop songs in AM country a long time ago. They were very popular for a while, between the time when rock and roll music was less popular and when BR music became popular. A lot of them liked to sing in a special way called doo-wop.\\nIn the old days, the groups were usually girls who knew each other and often grew up together. For example, the CA girls were four girls from a school in BR city in 1957. The RA girls were two sisters and a cousin. The SU girls were girls from a big building where lots of people live in DE city. They were, and still are, the most popular singing group of all time in AM country. These groups had a person who helped them talk to the music people. But this person did not make the group; they came after the group was already made.\\nLater, almost all groups were made by people who wanted to sell music. The SP girls were a good example of this. They were brought together in the middle of the 90s by a family team. The team's idea was to make a group of girls to sing songs just like the popular groups of boys that were singing a lot of songs during that time. The Spice Girls sold a lot of albums and had the best-selling album of all time.\nOne big difference between the earlier groups and the later ones was where they came from. The earlier AM country groups were friends who grew up together and were all from the same place. They usually sang and played together before they became a group. This is also true for most of the earlier BR country boy groups. The later groups were chosen for being different. This was so that everyone in the audience could find at least one member they could connect with. They had not sung together, or maybe even met each other, until their PR manager introduced them.\nWith time changing, the way of selling popular music changed a lot, so comparing sales is not simple. But in many places around the world, digital sales are now very important.", "hash": "739da043573d6e0b6599265dbea566f47a50d1505a15d81fb70cfd9c538c9ef9"}

Many of these tiny creatures store bad tasting stuff from the plants they eat. This makes them taste bad to the birds and their chicks. Another way they protect themselves is to be \"not worth chasing\", meaning the birds would use more energy chasing them than they would get from eating them. Because of this, many birds do not bother chasing tiny moths. This helps them stay safe from their main danger. Small flies are also very common, just like tiny bugs.

{"idx": 19152, "text": "EC Show\nEC Show (which at one time meant Extreme Championship Wrestling) was a show about pretend fighting from World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), based on a pretend fighting show that lasted from 1992 to 2001. It started on a summer day in 2006 with a weekly TV show. The EC Show was one of WWE's three shows, the other two being RAW and SD.\nWWE got Extreme Championship Wrestling and its video library in 2003 and later began showing EC Show through a series of DVDs and books. The big popularity of EC Show stuff made WWE organize EC One Night Stand, a big EC Show reunion in 2005. The big event was so good that WWE decided to have another one next year. People started to like ECW a lot, so WWE thought about bringing it back all the time. On a day in May, WWE said that ECW was going to be its own thing, just like Raw and SmackDown! It was going to be shown on the SC channel. Some people thought wrestling wouldn't be liked by people who watch the SC channel, but the boss of the channel, Bella, said that she thought ECW would fit the channel's idea of \"thinking big\". The SC channel is owned by a big company that also owns the USA Network and shows all the WWE shows.\n\nAt first, ECW tried to be different from the other WWE shows. The cameras were put in a different place and the ring had an ECW picture on it. The men who performed were called \"strong men\" instead of Superstars, and the women were called \"pretty ladies\" instead of Divas. It also had the first ECW people. But later, they changed some things to make it different from the old ECW, like changing the rules where you could use things in all the matches and there were almost never any time outs or times when someone did something wrong. Now, WWE calls these matches \"Big Rule\" matches, and they only happen when they say so. The only big event that only ECW put on since it started was an event in December. On a day in March, before the next one could be set, a big wrestling company said that all future shows would include all three groups.\\nFormer wrestling owner Patrick helped as the on air \"wrestling Representative\". According to a talk in a UK newspaper, Patrick wrote the weekly stories and gave them to writers for possible changes, and then Victor for final approval. After a December event, Patrick was no longer both on and off air with the wrestling company. After Patrick left, there was no wrestling boss until a day in August, when Adam was announced as the General Manager.\\nThe wrestling's weekly show was first given a thirteen episode run as a \"summer series\" on the TV channel. The first episode got a high rating, making it the most watched show on TV in its time slot. Because of its good ratings it was given more time through the end of the year. On a day in October, the network said the series would continue through the next year.\\nWhile the show started out a hit, it began getting bad words from fans of the original wrestling early on. This was most clear by the bad crowd reaction \"old school\" fans gave the main event of Benjamin vs. the Big Man at the show of a day in August from a famous place.\\nOn a day in October, a \"talent exchange\" was started between the wrestling groups! and EC brands, letting their people appear on either side.\nWhen EC started, it had a video thing called Hardcore Hangover, where fans only in US could watch or download videos from the show every week. On October 16, 2007, it was changed to a new thing that let people watch full episodes on the website the day after they were shown. After asking fans for names and having an online vote, the feature was named EC X-Stream on October 31, 2007.\nEC shows are held in big places as part of the SM show's Tuesday schedule. This is very different from the first Extreme Championship, which had most of its events in smaller places. The show usually happens live on Tuesdays before or after SM has taped, though sometimes it is recorded and shown later depending on what needs to happen.\nEC's first song was \"Bodies\" by a band, which had been used by WW for Extreme Championship before the side was made. Since then the song has changed between a few different songs before settling on \"Don't Question My Heart\", sung by Kevin of the band Shattersphere. A new version of \"Don't Question My Heart\" by another band featuring Brent Smith is now used.\nStarting in the winter of 2008, the show called \"EC\" started showing in HD. They also got a new set that was used by all the shows.\nThe first theme song for \"EC\" was a song by a band called DP, which had been used for a long time. After that, the theme song changed many times until they chose a song called \"Don't Question My Heart\", sung by a man named Kevin. A different version of \"Don't Question My Heart\" was used when the show ended.\nIn the winter of 2010, the boss of the company, Victor, said that \"EC\" would stop and a new show would take its place. He said this was the next step for the company and for TV. Later, they said the last episode would be in mid-February 2010. On another show called \"WE Superstars\", they said the new show would be called \"WE NXT\". After \"EC\" ends, all the people on the show can go to other shows.\nThe show was not only shown in US country on SF channel, but also on different channels in many other places.", "hash": "50e351db98f109fd94d7c6109bbc8f183b159ea5830e2a540ab89ee3133046dc"}

There are several different kinds of magic energy, and all the different kinds can do special things. Green energy can heal boo-boos or fix broken things, and Blue energy can make things move faster.

{"idx": 103822, "text": "History of team changes in the big hockey game\nIn a long time ago, games started to be played in the big hockey game. In the first two seasons, there were only three teams, but now, there are many more. Over the time that it has been around the big hockey game has added and lost teams many times. This is the whole story of team changes in the big hockey game.\nThe first four teams were the MO team, MW team, the OS team and the TA team, but after only playing four games, the MW team's place was burned down. This made them leave the game.\nIn a season a long time ago, the big hockey game added its first new team - the QB team. Also, the TA team changed their name to the SP team. In the next season, the QB team moved to HA and became the TI team.\nTwo new teams joined the game in a season - the BB team and the MM team.\nThe next season, the big hockey game added another new team - the PP team. Also, the TI team moved to NE city and became the NA team.\nThe big hockey game continued to add teams the next season, adding the CH team, the DC team and the NR team. This means the game started with three teams a long time ago, but ended up with more than three times more by the end of their first ten years. Also, during this season, the SP team changed their name to the ML team. In the old days, a team called the Pirates moved to PH city and became the Quakers. At the same time, a team called the Cougars changed their name to the Falcons.\nAfter a long time, the league lost a team for the first time. The Quakers and the Senators did not play in the next year.\nIn the following year, the Senators joined the league again and the Falcons changed their name to the Red Wings. After a while, the Senators moved to ST city and became the Eagles.\nBut after only one year, the Eagles left. For a while, there were only eight teams in the league.\nA few years later, the league lost the Maroons. So there were seven teams, just like a long time ago. For some years, there were seven teams. The last year with seven teams was when the Americans moved to BR city and left the league the next year.\nWhen the league lost the BR city Americans, a new time started called the Original Six time. For many, many years, nothing changed.\nThe last year of the Original Six time was when there were 12 teams, or twice as many as before. The new teams were the Seals, the Kings, the North Stars, the Flyers, the Penguins and the Blues. During this time, CA state was renamed the OA city Seals.\nThe OA city Seals were then renamed the CA Golden Seals for the season after the 1960s. The same year, the game group added two new teams - the BU city Sabres and the VA city Canucks.\nTwo more teams joined the game group two years later - the NE city Islanders and the AT city Flames.\nAgain, after two years, two more teams joined the game group - the WA city Capitals and the KA city Scouts. Two years later, the CA Golden Seals moved to CL city and became the Barons. The KA city Scouts moved also to DE city and became the CO Rockies.\nIn the season after the 1970s, the members of the CL city Barons team became part of the MI North Stars. This was the first time since the middle of the 20th century that the game group lost a team.\nIn the late 20th century, the WHA game group ended and four teams from the league joined the game group. They were the ED city Oilers, the NE Whalers (who became the HA city Whalers after joining the league), the QU city Nordiques and the WI city Jets. At this point, the game group had three CA country teams, but with three of the teams coming from the WHA being CA country, there were then twice as many CA country teams as before.\nIn the season after 1980, the AT city Flames moved to CA city Flames. Then, in the season after 1982, the CO Rockies moved to NE city and became the NE city Devils. In a long time ago, the CH team changed their name to Black Hawks.\nIn the next few years, many new teams joined the big hockey game. First, it was the SA team.\nThen, two new teams, the OT team and the TB team, came in.\nIn the season after that, two more teams joined - the FP team and the MD team. Also, the MN team moved to DA team and changed their name. In one of the next seasons, the QN team moved to DE city and became the CA team. Then, the WJ team moved to PH city and became the CO team. After that, the HW team moved to RA city and became the CH team.\nThe NP team joined the big hockey game for a season in the late 20th century.\nFor the next season, another team, the AT team, joined the game.\nThe big hockey game added the CB team and the MW team for a new season, making the number of teams thirty. This was how many teams there were for many seasons. The MD team changed their name to the AD team in a season in the early 21st century. Then, the AT team moved to WI city to become the Jets in a season in the early 21st century. Finally, the PC team changed their name to the AC team in a season in the 21st century.\nIn a hockey season a few years ago, a team called VG Knights joined. The SK team will join in a future season.", "hash": "78bcc5f85e97c4c8c5b95bf5110fe1e66a8efbb4aa066eadaedc3ffec023f617"}

The rain did not stop because more bad weather came from the countries next to YE country. This made the rains even bigger in some parts of YE country. People hoped that the weather would be better by Sunday.\nA lot of families had to leave HA; many schools were used as places for these people to stay, but these schools could only hold 10% of the people who were affected by the rains.

The lights and phones were not working, and many homes were hurt.\nThe leaders of YE country promised to give tents for the people who had no place to live, along with other things they needed. Six big planes with these things left from SA city on Saturday and more were planned for later. A man named Adam asked for a group of people to be made to help the people who were hurt by the rains. Also, the UA country said they wanted to help. However, some people in the city of SH said that help from the leaders, if there was any, was not much.\nThe group of the IC called the situation a \"big problem\" and started to collect money on Saturday to help the people who were hurt by the rains.\nAdam said, \"The problems... are big and the problem is also big.\"\nMany homes, about 730, were gone, along with shops and other buildings.

It can also be when more than two things are waiting for lots of things they need. Being stuck is a problem when lots of things are sharing something special called a \"soft lock\". Some computers have a \"hard lock\" that only lets one thing use it at a time. Being stuck is a big problem because there is no easy way to stop it from happening.\nA similar situation is when two friends are drawing pictures, but they have only one crayon and one ruler. If one friend takes the crayon and the other takes the ruler, they get stuck when the friend with the crayon needs the ruler and the friend with the ruler needs the crayon to finish his work with the ruler. Both friends can't get what they need, so they get stuck.\nThe way we talk about getting stuck when we're talking about phones and computers is a bit different: getting stuck happens when none of the things we're doing can move to a different step (as described in the thing's list of steps) \"and\" all the ways of talking are empty.

{"idx": 1494, "text": "Card game\\nCard game, or just a fun game, is a game where you try to get the most cards. It is played by two teams of two people, one team plays against the other team. Teammates sit across from each other at a table.\\nMany people play this fun game all over the world in clubs, in tournaments, on the internet, and with friends at home. It is one of the most popular card games in the world. The World Game Group looks after the rules for this game when it's played in competitions.\\nThe game is played in parts called \"rounds\". Each round has four parts: giving out the cards, choosing who goes first (also called \"bidding\"), playing the cards, and counting who won. Most clubs and tournaments play a version of the game where the same cards are used for the whole game. All players play the same rounds. This lets us compare who did better.\\nIt is played with the normal set of 52 cards in four groups. The game came from an older game called whist. The game we play now was developed over many years, from about 1890 to 1930. The different versions of the game included old-card game and first-card game, and these changes mostly happened in NE city and LO city. We don't really know why the game is called \"bridge\" in this way. One idea is that it came from a book from 1886, called \"BI, or RU country Whist\" by a man named Jack.\\nThe older game whist is played with the most important group of cards chosen by luck, but in bridge it is chosen by a process called \"bidding\". A trump is a card that can win over any card from the other three groups of cards.\nIn a card game, the winners had to get most of the rounds (a round is when everyone puts down one card), that is, seven or more rounds. However, in another game, the players take turns to decide what the \"rule\" shall be. The rule is decided by the last turn, and will be in one of the four groups of cards, or in \"no trumps\", without a winning group.\nThe rules for points and the process of taking turns changed a lot between a long time ago and a bit less long time ago. Turns at the one level are offers to make at least seven rounds. Turns at the seven level are offers to make all thirteen rounds. The lowest turn one can make is \"one club\" and the highest turn is \"seven no trumps\".\nThe points system for the second game is a lot more tricky than it is for the first game. Basically, it depends on whether or not the player makes his rule or not. If he does not, the defending side get extra points. If he does make the rule his side wins points. How many points are won or lost depends on the points system (we won't talk about this here). Henry played a big part in making the points system, and in a time long ago the Whist Club of NE city made a code for contract bridge. They and the Portland Club of LO city became the groups who guided the later small changes to the rules.\nThe way for playing the cards is also different from the first game. In the game, the team that wins gets to play with only one friend (\"the leader\") controlling everything. The leader's friend is called \"the helper\", and what the helper can do is shown to everyone.\nThis way of playing was first thought of for a different game. In that game, some friends would stay in the same place, some would move around, and the game would move too. This was thought of a long time ago. The first time this way of playing was used was by a man named Cameron in LO city a long time ago, but people didn't do it much after that. It was played in CH city a while later, and the first book about it was written by a man named Jack. Jack's way of playing is known as the Jack's way.\nA game became really popular when it was talked about by Ethan, a really good player from AM country. Games between AM country and AN country were talked about a lot in the news, movies, and radio a long time ago.\nIn the example, William was the first to start and the first to choose. The choosing goes as shown with Samuel becoming the leader in a 4 stars game, he being the first to choose stars. William and Ethan become the ones trying to stop him and William becomes the first to try, Nathan becomes the helper and stars become the important thing.\nTen wins are needed by Nathan and Samuel, six wins plus the 4-level game.\nMostly, bridge is a fun game played with friends. A lot of people play the same game at different tables, which lets us see who is the best pair. The game starts when a machine picks the cards for each player. The machine also gives out the cards. These are put into a place to keep them safe. The cards are then put on the tables. \nDavid's book, \"The golden time of the fun game\", talks about all the things that happened from the start of the game, up to around the middle of the 20th century.", "hash": "53c59f930dfd52e773649a063ef13ac4ad9f74a2e1c8fedcbbdcf036193de36c"}

Thomas said that these two parts of the way of thinking, caring and understanding wisdom, must be rooted in a big wish for freedom driven by a real sense of wanting to change.

Ralph, who also worked for the same company, did the hard math for the bridge.\nThe bridge was made in EN country by the CL Company. It was then moved to the MO port of BE and moved on the new train line to the VE Waterfall. It took just over a year to put together and was finished in the early 20th century.\nThe bridge was officially opened by a man named George, son of Charles, and head of the BR Group (now the RO Group) on a fall day.

The other paths are at CH bridge and KA dam.\nThe VI bridge did not bring the first train or the first train path to ZA country. To make the train path north as fast as possible, Cameron wanted the LI to KA path built before the bridge was finished. A train engine was carried in parts across the narrow valley by the temporary electric line used to carry the bridge parts. The line was called the 'B' by the bridge builders. The train engine was put back together and started work months before the bridge was done.\nFor more than 50 years the bridge was used by trains carrying people as part of the main path between the then NR country, southern Africa and Europe. Trains carrying goods carried mainly orange metal and wood out of ZA country, and coal into the country.\nThe old age of the bridge and problems with keeping it in good shape have led to limits on how much traffic can go across at times. Trains cross at slower than walking speed and trucks were limited to loads of 30 tons. Bigger trucks have to take the longer path using the KA Ferry or CH bridge. The limit was raised after repairs in 2006. The bridge needs to be fixed a lot or replaced.\nDuring a time of trouble and war, the big BR bridge was often closed (and people couldn't use it regularly). In 1975, the bridge was a place where people tried to make peace. They met in a train car above the gorge for a very long time. In 1980, things like goods and cars started using the bridge again and it has been open ever since, except for when it needed to be fixed.\nNow, one of the main things people like about the VF Bridge are tours that tell you how it was built. You can even walk under the main deck. On the ZA side, there is a small place where you can learn about the bridge. It's free to go in and there's a place where you can get snacks.\nThere's also a place on the bridge where you can do a fun jump with a bungee cord and zip-line. But some people were worried about safety in late 2011 after a young AU girl's bungee cord broke and she fell into the river with lots of crocodiles.\nThe bridge was first called the GZ or ZA bridge, then it got the name VF Bridge.", "hash": "1e5a08d54eb6f1b6815359983a4f2f121b9a3e019c60ccb91074c536068cf260"}

{"idx": 48538, "text": "A lovely melody\\nA lovely melody is a song for a big violin and a group of musicians made by a man named Peter. It is one of the most loved songs for big violin and orchestra.\\nPeter never made a big song for a big violin, but he did make this song, which is a tune with different parts. It is called \"Rococo\" because the music is like the music that was loved a long time ago, the time when people like Mozart made music. The main song is an original song by Thomas, not a song that was made by someone else a long time ago.\nThomas wrote this song for a man named Frank to play. Frank was a man who played the cello and lived in RU country. Like Thomas, he was a teacher in MO city. Frank played this song for the first time in MO city on a late fall day in the 19th century. A man named Nathan was leading the music.\nWhat happened to the song after that first time it was played is a fun story. Thomas was not there when it was first played because he was in SW country trying to feel better after a very quick, unhappy marriage. He wanted to get the song ready to be made into a book. He sent Frank a version of the song for the piano. He asked Frank to make any changes needed for the cello part. Meanwhile, Thomas was busy deciding what each instrument would play in the song.\nHowever, Frank did not just change the cello part. He also changed other parts of the song. He left out one part and changed the order of some others. When the song was about to be made into a book, Thomas saw what Frank had done. Thomas was very upset, but he decided to let the book be printed that way anyway.\nWhen it was made into a book there was nothing written down that said that Frank had made lots of changes. It was many, many years later that people found out that Thomas's first music was different. Some people who play the big violin, like Samuel, now choose to play Thomas's first music. But, most big violin players still like to play Franklin's music. It is hard to know which one Thomas would have liked more. Maybe he let it be printed because he thought that Franklin made it better. We cannot know. People who play music still talk about which music should be played.\nThe music is written for a group of instruments that is smaller than Thomas's usual group. It is like the ones from a long time ago. There are just two of each wind instrument, two horns, and string instruments.\nThe music, which is about as long as a short cartoon, is made up of a main part and seven changes (eight in Thomas's first version).\nThe music is sometimes played by other solo instruments. Matthew plays it on the viola. He played it at a big concert in 2010.", "hash": "f4e6329be2798da6cfcfc1e405637fd91e2a2213542dde79327323fee560f556"}

He was known as \"the best cook\", because he cooked for very important people, and is often thought of as the first famous cook.\nCameron was born in PA city, but his parents left him in 1792 because they didn't have any money. He worked as a helper at a simple PA city cafe in exchange for a place to sleep and food to eat. In 1798, he started learning from Samuel, a famous cake baker with a shop near a big castle.\nCameron became famous in PA city for his amazing cakes, which Samuel put in the shop window. The cakes were sometimes very tall, and were only made out of food like sugar, sweet almond paste, and dough. He made them look like buildings, big triangle buildings, and old broken buildings which he read about in the books he studied at the FR library. Some of his sugar works were so strong that funny people could dance on them to entertain the king.\nCameron also worked for other people, for example the FR man who liked good food named Charles, and other members of PA city's fancy people, including Napoleon.

{"idx": 15153, "text": "Long, long ago\nPA period 100 years before\nTZ period 1-100 years after\nMI period 100-170 years after\nTL period 170-350 years after\nXO period 350-550 years after\nME period 550-650 years after\nDuring the TZ and MI period, a lot of people started living in TE city. Many people think this is because people had to move from their homes in the ME area after a mountain with fire inside changed the southern part of the ME area. When people started living in a different way, they began to build a lot of big things in the middle of the city. Some think that the Big Road was made during this time. They think it replaced older buildings that are now underneath this area. There was also a lot of building happening at the Sun Big Building, the Moon Big Building, and the Big Square. \nDuring a certain time, the city began to make about 2,300 big houses all over the city. But around the middle of the 5th century, the city started to have less contact with other places. They became less powerful and there were fewer people living in the city.\nIn the beginning, people thought that the city was attacked and burned by other people a long time ago. They thought these people might have been a group called the Toltecs. But now, some people think that the damage was mostly in the houses of the rich people. This makes it seem like the poor people in the city might have risen up against the rich people. The idea of an attack is also less likely because when people started to dig up and fix the city, they found that the temples and palaces were very burned. This made them think that the whole city was probably burned. It seems like most of the destruction was along the Big Road. Some statues seem to have been broken in a very planned way. The number of people living in the city started to go down a long time ago. This makes us think there were problems in the city. The number of people getting smaller is usually because of no rain and too many trees being cut down. These things happened a long, long time ago. Also, there seem to be more young people who didn't grow up and more signs of not having enough food in the city. There is no fight between the ideas. Both more fights and problems inside can also be because of a time of no rain and no food.\nA big reason that TE city became so big and strong was because there were no enemies close by. But, because of problems with people, problems with nature that TE city could not fix, and less people, TE city became very weak in protecting itself from the outside world. Other cities close by tried to take the place of TE city. These included CH city, XO city, and CA city. They tried to make TE city weaker. Some think they may have joined together against TE city to make it less strong and powerful. The art and buildings at these places show they wanted to be like TE city. But there is also a mix of different pictures and symbols from other parts of ME region, especially the MA region.\nTE city was a city with people from many different places, like ZA place, MI place, MA place and what seem to be NA place. People moving there played a big part in the city getting bigger and its mix of people from different places. This place had different neighborhoods. There was a well-known neighborhood called OA neighborhood and the Merchants\u2019 neighborhood. People are still learning about the people who moved to TE city from different places like western MX country, OA country, the GL country, and central MX country.\nThe city was a place where lots of things were made. Many people who made pots, jewelry, and other things lived there. Many items made of a shiny black rock were made in TE city. But, we do not know of any old writings from TE city that tell us what things meant (or if they even existed). Writings from MA cities show that important people from TE city visited rulers in other cities, even as far as HD country. They might have even taken over those places. Writings from the MA people talk about a man scholars call \"Spearthrower Owl\". He seems to have been a leader of TE city, who was in charge for over 60 years. He put his family in charge of TI city and UA city in GU country. Most of what we know about the culture at TE city comes from the paintings on the walls and others, like the WA paintings, found in people's collections, and from writings made by the MA people describing their encounters with TE city conquerors.\nThe beliefs of the people in TE city were similar to those of other people in the ME region. They worshipped many of the same gods. \n People in the old times ate different animals at home. They liked rabbits, a kind of deer, dogs, birds that live in water, fish, small birds, big birds, small birds that coo, and turtles. They also ate eggs from these birds for their food. Some people think that they hunted these animals while others think they raised them at home. \nIn the middle of the city, there was a big road called \"AD road\". There were big buildings along this road, including the second biggest sun pyramid and the moon pyramid. There were also many small platforms along the road. People in the past thought they were big graves, so they called the road that. But now we know that they were used for big meetings and had temples on top. Further down the road was a place called the CI place, where there was a broken temple of the bird with many feathers. This place was a big open space surrounded by temples. It was the important place for religion and leaders. The people from SP country thought it was a fort, so they named it \"CI place\".\nA special thing about this city was the use of home groups. Over time, there were over 2,000 home groups in the city. In the old times, there were big homes where not just one but many families lived. These families were from all different types of jobs. But, people were not put in these homes without thinking. In TE city, there was a special way of placing families in homes. Families who did the same work lived together. So, families who took care of rabbits lived with other rabbit caretakers, and families who worked with plaster lived with other plaster workers. But, many people also did more than one job. A lot of them worked on farms or had other special skills. These big homes looked the same from outside but were different inside, showing who was who in the family, what job they did, and where they came from. Each family had their own rooms to cook, eat, keep their things, and sleep. They also had special places to remember and say goodbye to people who had passed away. The middle of the home was a special place where families showed their love for their gods.\n\nThe Moon Big Building was the first big building to be made. It was built in different parts and got bigger four times during a time long, long ago. People found four places where people had been buried with special things. But, none of these people seemed to be very important like a king or a religious leader.\n\nThe Sun Big Building is close to a man-made cave and is connected with the Storm God, time, looking at stars, the sun, and the Pleiades. This big triangle building was used for special events and trips. Because of its shape, it was known as the place for New Fire parties. These parties only happened every 52 years, when new homes, special buildings, and cities were made, and new leaders came to help people.\nThe Feathered Snake Big Triangle Building was the last big building added to the Road of the Gone. This building is linked to the making of a world full of water with special fights, giving up things, power, and leaders. When this building was first made, they gave offerings of warriors and some people think that other people who were given up were caught. A big room was found in the middle, but someone had taken things from it before. Many people think this room was for someone who was a leader or someone very important.\nPeople always knew about the big old ruins of TE city. After the city was gone, different people lived on the site. During AZ times, the city was a place people visited and it was linked with the story of TO, the place where the sun was made. TE city amazed the SP country people who came after. Today TE city is one of the most special old things people can visit in MX country.\nSome digging was done in the 19th century, and in 1905 big projects of digging and fixing started under a man named Liam Benjamin. The big triangle building was fixed up to celebrate 100 years of ME country being free in the early 20th century. Big projects of digging and fixing were done in the middle and end of the 20th century. New projects at the Moon triangle building and the Bird Snake triangle building have shown us more about how people lived back then. TE place has some places where you can learn about old things and see buildings that have been fixed up.", "hash": "460b3d412d02942894e7e5bd5cc2b87865f7e1d4fd4cb61ce443641222f66155"}

Ethan (a smart man living many years ago) figured out how big around the Earth is. After that, not many smart people thought the Earth was flat anymore. People first started thinking that the Earth is round many years ago. Then, a man named Adam proved the Earth was round.\nThe real shape of the Earth only matters when thinking about really big distances. So, a long time ago, only sailors, star-gazers, thinkers, and holy people would have cared about what shape the Earth is.\nThese people all thought the Earth was round like a ball: King Adam of the AS people, Hannah von Bingen, Thomas, Samuel Sturluson, Marco Polo, David Alighieri, Christopher Columbus\nPeople from PO country explored AF and AS, Christopher sailed to the AM (in the year we know as 1492) and Ferdinand's trip around the Earth (in the years we know as 1519-21) showed for sure that the Earth is round like a ball.\nDuring a time long ago, people had ideas that made the Flat Earth model seem very important. There was a picture that a lot of people saw. It showed a man poking his head through the sky of a flat Earth to see the machines moving the stars. The picture looks old, but it first appeared in a book by a man named Cameron called \"The Sky: Popular Weather\" (from FR country, a long time ago). The picture shows the story of a man long ago who said \"he reached the place where the Earth and the sky meet\". Some people think this story came from a man named Victor, but there is no old source for it. The original picture had a fancy border that makes it look from a long time ago; in later books, some people said that the picture was really old and the border was taken away. According to a story, Cameron asked for the picture himself; but no one knows of the picture before Cameron's book.\nThere was an early story in a funny play called \"Ethan M.\" (a very long time ago). Many people did not agree with Ethan M. when he said the Earth is round, because all the people living in the country believed it is flat. He was not allowed to marry his girlfriend until he said \"The earth is flat like a pancake\". In Robert's \"The Town that Thought the World was Flat\", the main characters spread a silly story that a town meeting had decided the world was flat.\nSometimes, in make-believe stories, people imagine a flat world. In Cameron's \"The Journey of the Morning Ship\" the made-up world is \"flat like a table\", not \"round like a ball\", and the characters go on a journey to the edge of this world. Thomas' books are about a flat, round world that sits on the backs of four big elephants which are standing on the back of a huge turtle.", "hash": "73c303fffbaeee0baa37d47da3bc9219df9343225555329fc41620a92b054bd9"}

{"idx": 17804, "text": "Tropical Storm Beryl (2006)\n The last bits of a big storm moved northeastward through NS place, and in the middle of summer it joined with a coming cold front.\nThe storm made the sea along the northeast US coast very rough. In MA state, it only brought light rain and strong wind, with no harm done. The storm later brought medium rain and gusty winds across Atlantic CA place, causing some power to go out but little harm. No one was hurt.\nA cold front moved off the East Coast of the US in the middle of July and stopped off the coast of NC state. It slowly turned into a low pressure area, and developed into two disturbances; one was quite a way off from CC place and another was a bit closer to CH place, NC state. The first low area quickly turned into a nameless tropical storm, and the other area stayed big and messy. However, by two days later, the system became much better organized with improved banding features, and the area developed into Storm Number Two while located a bit further from CH place.\nThe depression moved slowly to the north through a break in the subtropical ridge, and as the storm bands became more visible the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Benjamin. For most of its time, the storm moved through an environment with light vertical wind and well-established upper-level outflow. Shortly after becoming a tropical storm, the low-level circulation of Benjamin became exposed with limited deep storm clouds, though deep storm clouds re-developed the following morning. Big Wind\\nBig Wind got stronger and stronger because the sea was warm. Early one summer day, it was very strong and was near a place called NH city.\\nBig Wind stayed very strong for almost a whole day as it moved along the middle and NJ coasts, and it looked like it had an eye in the middle. But later that day, it started to get weaker because it moved over cooler water. Big Wind started moving northeast really fast because of the wind, and early the next day, it moved over an island called NA. As it moved over colder water, it started to lose its strength, and by midday, it wasn't a storm anymore and was near CC place. A few hours later, it reached NS place, and on the next day, Big Wind was gone and mixed with cold air over NF place.\\nPeople first thought Big Wind would just touch the CA places, so they watched out for a storm from CL place to CB place. When they saw that it was moving more to the northeast, they started watching out for a storm from WH place to PL city, including CC place, NA, and MV. About a day before a big storm was going to come, a group that watches the weather said there would be a tropical storm in the same area. They also said there could be a tropical storm from WH city to NH city and for the eastern part of LI island from east of FI island to PJ place. Waiting for the storm, the MA group was ready for the hurricane season. Local helper groups were opened, too, with two volunteer teams ready to help. In southeastern MA state, police departments had extra people to help with any problems from the storm. Many people who had boats made sure they were safe, while some people who owned stores put boards on their windows to protect them from the storm damage.\nA few days before the storm Beryl went through AC region, the CH center said there would be strong winds for the waters off of NS place and NF place. Because they thought it would rain a lot, the agency also said there would be heavy rainfall warnings for western NS place, including HA city.\nThe storm caused big waves along the East Coast of US country, with very big waves in the open water. Waves along the southern coast of NA island got very high as the storm came close to the island, so four people had to be saved by lifeguards from strong currents.\nThere were also big waves along the southern coast of MA state and RI state. Beryl also made the water level rise a little on NA island. The winds across southeastern MA state were not too strong, but they did get up to 44 miles per hour; unofficially, they went as fast as 51 miles per hour.\nBella\\nBella made it rain a little bit near the coast, but the most rain that fell in the US was only a little less than 1 inch on a place called NA island. It rained a bit in the southeast of MA state, with about 0.33 inches in CH town. The only damage was a few fallen telephone poles and tree branches. But overall, it didn't cause much trouble; there were no power outages, no one got hurt, and there were no problems at sea because of the storm.\\nThe leftover rain from Bella made it rain a bit more in AC region, with the most rain falling in SB town, NS region. Some places even got 1 inch of rain in just an hour. In addition, a place in FR city, NB region reported nearly 2 inches of rain in 2 hours. The rain caused some small floods, and some streets got covered with water from overflowing streams. There were also some winds along the path of the storm, with the strongest winds in southern NS region. The winds caused some tree branches to fall and some places lost power. But overall, the damage was small.", "hash": "c4e2033187ac459b9a12ae625f4d9517c1fb77d6cfd40f4cb4118d9c68bfb194"}

He got married there, and he had at least six kids.\nThen he went to live in a city we'll call MI city where he had the job of being in charge of music. He stayed there until a time long ago in the 1500s. Some letters he wrote during that time are still here. They tell us about life at the place where he worked.\nIn the same time long ago, he went to work for a group in a place we'll call MA city and became the leader of a singing group at a special music place where he stayed until later in the 1500s.

He died in MA city and was put to rest in a special place at S Barbara.\nDe Wert wrote many songs and other fun works. These were later put into 16 books. He also wrote many holy songs which showed how well he could make music.\nHis songs were very new for their time. The music was very bold in the way it described the words. He sometimes used small groups of singers to talk to each other like a musical conversation.

{"idx": 92220, "text": "Jack\\nJack (born on a spring day in May) is a man from EN country who was a leader for a group of people from 2015 to 2020. He has been a member of a group in IS town since the 1980s. He was chosen as the leader of his group in 2015. Jack says he believes in fairness and sharing.\nJack was born in CH town in WI county. Before becoming a leader, he worked for many groups of workers. He was chosen for HA Council in 1974. He was later the secretary of the IS group. He joined the big house as a member.\nJack has been given many awards for helping people around the world. As a member, he is known for working hard and for making his own choices even when others in his group didn't agree. Jack works to help people who do not have a lot of money and to stop cuts to important things like schools and help for people who need it since 2010.\nDuring his job, he has worked to make sure big companies and very rich people pay their fair share. He has been against wars and against scary weapons. Cameron supports a way of doing things that means not fighting and not making scary weapons. This means he wants all places to stop building these scary weapons. Cameron is part of a group that wants to help people, a group that wants peace for PA country, a group that helps people who are being treated badly and a group that is against scary weapons. He was the big boss of a group that wanted to stop wars from June 2011 until September 2015.\nAfter the LO party did not win in the big vote in 2015 and the leaving of Ethan, Cameron said he wanted to be the boss of the LO party on a summer day in June 2015. Although many people did not think he could win, he got enough votes to be the top person. He got many votes from people who work and support the LO party, as well as people who want to help others. He became the Leader of the LO Party on a day in September 2015 after winning a lot of votes.\nIn a summer month in 2016, after a big choice where people voted to leave the EU group, people in the LO party passed a vote of not believing in Cameron. It passed with a lot of votes after many people from Cameron's team left. He then had to compete again, against Alice and Oliver. But, in a summer month in 2016, Alice left the race leaving Oliver and Cameron as the only people. On a day in September, Cameron won a big contest against Sam with more than half of the votes.\nAfter it was announced there would be a big vote in 2017, Cameron said he was ready to offer a different choice than the CO group. In the vote, the LA group got more seats, but the CO group was still the biggest group.\nIn 2019, Cameron made a plan to stop a bad thing from happening, which involved making a temporary group to look after things and then asking people what they thought about the new rules for leaving EU country. He has publicly said bad things about people being mean to others in the LA group, however many believe that Cameron is responsible for some mean actions within the group. In the 2019 big vote, LA group had its worst loss since a long time ago in the 20th century, and kept only a bit over 200 seats. Cameron said that he would not lead the LA group in the next big vote, causing a big contest, where Kevin won the contest and took Cameron's place in April.\nCameron was not allowed to be part of the LA group at the end of October 2020 after he said that he would not agree with what the EQ group found about people being mean. He was allowed to be part of the group again a month later, but he was not allowed to be part of the main group until February 2021.\nCameron was born at CH hospital in CH town, WI country. He grew up in KI town in WI country. The youngest of four boys, he is the brother of Patrick. His mom, Nora, was a teacher who liked numbers. His dad, David, made things with wires. His parents liked to help people and didn't like fighting. When he was seven, they moved to a new home in SH city, where his dad bought a big house and turned it into a home for their family. \nHe went to CA school near NP city, SH region. Then he went to AD school. In school, he said he didn't do very well and his teacher told him that he wouldn't be able to do much. For a short time, he worked as a writer for a local paper, the \"NP and MD news\". He went to the UN college for a year but didn't finish.\nWhen he was about 19, he spent two years in JA country as a teacher who taught about places.\nHe worked for a group of people who made clothes. He became a part of a health group in the early years of a time long ago. In 1974, he was chosen to be part of the HA group, helping HA city until 1983. He worked on Thomas's big job in 1981.\nHe was chosen as the LP person for his local place in IS city in 1982. Around this time, he became part of the \"LO city LP news\", where he helped write and make the news during the 1980s. It's been told that Isaac was a leader for some time.\nIn a year in the early 20th century, Isaac became a helper for the people in a place called IS city. After winning, he joined a group of friends who wanted to help people. He was part of different groups in the big building where the helpers work.\nIsaac has been chosen as the helper for IS city many times. In one of the times he was chosen, he got a lot of votes. During his work, he didn't agree with his friends 428 times when his group was leading.\nOnce, Isaac almost got into trouble for not giving money as a way to say he didn't like a new way of asking for money in SC country.\nIn a fall month of a year in the early 21st century, Isaac joined a group of people who didn't want a war that started that year. He helped plan a big walk against another war. This walk was said to be the biggest walk against a war in the history of EN country. In a year in the early 21st century, Isaac was one of 12 helpers to agree with a group's call for a special talk about the war. He became the leader of the group, but left in a year in the early 21st century.\nIsaac has always said no to very dangerous things and has always supported a group that wants peace. He was told off for inviting Gabriel and other friends to the WE building in 1984, a little while after a bad event at a BR hotel.\nCameron was the leader of many groups in the WE building. These groups talked about places like CH islands, ME country, LA region, and about being nice to everyone. He helped the people of CH islands. He is known for helping VE country.\nAfter the LP group didn't win the big vote on a day in May 2015, Ethan said he didn't want to be the leader anymore. His leaving made the group choose a new leader.\nOn a summer day, it was said in newspapers and on TV that Cameron was thinking of trying to be the new leader. The next day, Cameron told his local newspaper that he would try to be the new leader. But before he could do that, he needed at least 35 friends to say he could. In the end, he got 36. Some friends who said he could didn't think he would win and only said he could so they could talk about more things.\nSome, including a lady named Margaret, told newspaper people they were sorry they said he could. When he was accepted to try to be the new leader Cameron said: \"I'm doing this because a lot of LP group members want to see more people try and want to talk more about what will happen to the group. I am trying to be the new leader to give LP group members a chance to talk in this discussion\". He would run against people named Yara, Adam, Benjamin and Lily.\nDavid was chosen as the leader of his group on a day in September 2015 with a lot of people picking him first. It has been said that David would have still won in the first round with 51% of votes. David's big win was larger than that won by Thomas in 1994.\nAfter being chosen as leader in September 2015, David became the leader of the big group. On a day in September 2015, his special seat was announced. During his time as leader, David wanted to stop the \"show-off\" nature of the big meeting place. His first months as leader was called as \"a good start\" and a \"much needed\" change by \"The Big News\". He made his first big speech as leader on a day in September 2015. As Leader of the big group, he was made a member of the special group on a day in November 2015. The phrase, \"David-mania\", is used for the large amount of support given by his friends.\nOn a day in June 2016, MP Jessica was hurt really bad after being hurt multiple times by a bad man named Thomas. After this bad thing happened, David talked about Jessica as someone who was \"always working to help us keep our promises to help the world and make things fair\".\nIn June 2017, David made an appearance at a big party, where he talked to the crowd. The crowd chanted \"Oh, Jack\" and sang a song by a band. Jack talked about why it's important for young people to vote.\nAfter some bad people did scary things in FR city in November of a year, Jack said that the best way to stop these bad people would be to talk and make peace. Jack did not want to use force or attack these bad people.\nIn a summer month, Jack said he wanted UK country to stay in the EU group. After UK country decided to leave the EU group, many leaders in his team wanted Jack to step down.\nAfter the big decision, many people in Jack's team quit because they did not like how Jack led. A man named Henry told Jack that he did not trust him as a leader anymore. Later, Jack asked Henry to leave his team. A woman named Hannah left the team a few hours later, followed by other team members. Other team members, including men and women named Jack, Andy, Diana, Jon, Alice, Emma, and a man from BR city either supported Jack or said that it was not a good time for a \"rebellion\". By the middle of the next day, many team members had resigned their roles as did seven helpers.\nOn a summer day, a man named Adam did not get the support of his friends in the LA group by a vote of 172 to 40. He said that the vote didn't really mean anything and that he would keep being the leader.\n\nA survey of the LA group members found that about half of them would support Adam if they needed to pick a new leader. The leader of LO city, who did not pick a side, said \"When LA group splits, when we're not together, we lose\". The disagreement between Adam and the LA group continued.\n\nOn a summer day, a lady named Alice said she would like to be the new leader of the LA group. Two days later, a man named Oliver also said he wanted to be the new leader. On a day in July, Alice quit the race after Oliver got more votes than her. Alice said she quit for the good of the group. This was because having two people against Adam could split the vote and give him a better chance of winning.\n\nOn a day in September, after the leader vote, Adam was picked again as the leader of the group with even more people supporting him.\n\nA report on a big problem was given on a day in July. It said bad things about the former leader of the LA group, Tony, for joining a war. Adam didn't like the war. In response, Adam said sorry to the people of the country where the war happened, to the families of the soldiers who died, and to the people of EN country.\n\nAfter the election of a man named David in the US country leader election, Adam said that he believes that David is not solving problems, but dividing the US country. Cameron also said he thinks it's a good idea for Trump to not be allowed to visit UK country because of his decision to not let people from some countries come to US country.\nIn June, Cameron said no to an invitation to a big dinner for Donald Trump, given by Queen Emma II when the president visited UK country. Cameron went to a protest in LO city outside where Trump and a woman named Madison were talking to the news. He asked to meet with Trump to talk about things like taking care of our earth, keeping peace and helping people who had to leave their homes. Trump said no to the meeting, saying that Cameron was not helpful.\nIn January, Cameron said that he would support a plan to make the people in his group say yes to a rule that would start the process of UK country leaving the EU group. In answer to this, many people in his group said they would say no to the rule. Taylor, who worked on things for young children, and Jessica, who worked on things for WE country, left their jobs because they did not agree. On the first day of February, forty seven people in his group did not agree with Cameron's plan when they read the rule for the second time.\nIn the elections in May, Cameron's group lost almost 400 leaders and control of DE and NO counties. The BBC's guess at the national vote was 38% for the CO group, 27% for LA group, 18% for the LI group and 5% for UK group, with others at around 12%.\nCameron said he agreed with Head Lady Theresa's idea for a big vote early while waiting for the big house people to say yes. He said he would tell his friends to say yes to the head lady's idea in the big house vote on a spring day in April. Most of the big house people need to say yes for a big vote to happen before the year 2020.\nA lot of people wanted Cameron to be the Head Man like the US big house man Bernie, who Cameron liked when Bernie wanted to be the Head Man of US.\nIn the quick big vote, Cameron's team won 32 more seats and more people liked them, though the Blue Team still ruled.\nAfter the year 2017 vote, a check showed that Cameron's team was liked by 45% people while the Blue Team was liked by 39% people. This was the first check showing Cameron's team ahead since he became the leader. More people liked Cameron than those who didn't. Cameron told everyone that his team was getting ready for the big vote all the time, hoping for another big vote to happen as soon as fall 2017. He started a few big talks in important places.\nAfter Theresa's exit plan did not pass in the big house on 15 January 2019, Cameron said he did not trust Theresa's team. But most people in the big house did not agree with him.\nIn March 2019, Cameron was hit by a person who liked the exit plan outside a big prayer house in the north of LO city. The bad man went to jail for 28 days. In March 2019, Cameron said that he could say yes in a second vote, depending on the exit plan.\nAt the end of Taylor's time as a leader, she was a little more popular than Cameron in a question asking who is the best leader. However, after Benjamin became the leader in a summer month of 2019, he was much more popular than Cameron in this question, even though people thought Cameron was more like them than Benjamin.\nA year after many of his team members left, Cameron took three members off his team and another one left. This happened because they didn't follow the team's rules and voted on something they were not supposed to, which was about keeping UK country part of a big group.\nIn a spring month of 2018, it was told that members of Cameron's team, including him and some people who worked for him, were part of a secret group on a website where bad things were said. He left the group after becoming the leader in 2015.\nAccording to a news place, he was added to the group by someone else in 2014 and he only wrote a few things.\nLater in the same spring month of 2018, a person speaking for Cameron admitted that he had written something on the website in 2012 that was about a picture in LO city that some people said was bad. This made people upset and Cameron said: \u201cI am really sorry that I did not look more closely at the picture I was writing about, which is very upsetting and bad,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can't say bad things even if we have the right to say what we want.\" \"That is a thought I\u2019ve always had.\u201d.\nIn the second month of a year not too long ago, seven people left a big group called the LI group to make a new group. They left because of how Cameron handled a big decision and because of bad things people said about them.\nOn a day at the end of October, Prime Minister Benjamin said that the next big choice day would be in December of that year. The reason was so that the CO group could have more people in the big group to pass a big decision bill. The LI group were left with just over 200 seats, their worst result since a long time ago. However, the group's share of the choices was higher than in two past choice days. The CO group won seats in EN and WA that were usually LI seats, in a move the people who tell the news in UK country called: \"a big change of UK choices\".\nAfter the LI group's had big losses in the choice day, Cameron said that he plans to step down after a time of thinking causing a leadership contest. Cameron said that he had \"pride in the plan\" that the LI group put forward for the choice day and blamed the defeat on the big decision.\nOn a day in April, in a last message to LI group members while leader of the group, Cameron said, \"I can assure you my voice will not be quiet. I\u2019ll be out there working for fairness, peace and justice, and I feel sure we\u2019ll be doing that together.\" He also claimed that the LI group in the last five years under his leadership had \"changed the plan on austerity and how the economy is run\".\nOn a spring day in 2020, a man named Kevin became the new leader of a big group. \nIn August 2020, in a question asked on a bird named social media, Kevin was chosen as the \"best leader we never had\" by most of the people who answered. \nAfter a report by a group that looks at fairness, the big group stopped Kevin from being a part of them in October 2020. They did this because he said that he would not agree with what the report found. On a day in November 2020, Kevin was told he had done something wrong but was allowed to be a part of the group again. But the leader of the group, another man named Kevin, has not yet given Kevin any jobs in the group again. Later in November, Kevin's helpers asked for a meeting with the big group because they had stopped Kevin from doing his group jobs. Kevin says that he and the other Kevin had agreed to let him be a part of the group again. His jobs in the group will be stopped at least until a month in 2021 until a look into bad things Kevin is said to have done can finish.\nOn a day in December 2020, Kevin said that he would be starting a project for peace and fairness the next month. It would look at taking care of our world, peace between countries, people who don't have much, people not being treated the same and big companies. Kevin started the project in January 2021.\nIn the past, Kevin was married to a woman named Jessica. They stopped being married in 1979. Later, Kevin was married to a woman named Claudia. They had three sons. They stopped being married in 1999. Kevin said in a month in 2015 that he still \"gets along very well\" with his former wife. In 2013, Cameron married Laura, who we'll call Lily. He lives in a place called FI park in LO city.\nIn a chat with a news place in December 2015, Cameron didn't want to talk about what he believes in, saying it's a \"private thing\", while saying that he was not someone who doesn't believe in God.\nIn January 2016, they said that a funny play about Cameron's life would be shown at the WA theater in LO city later in the year. A news place suggested that \"Cameron the Musical: The Bike Stories\" \"may be the first stage show written about a leader of the other side\".\nCameron has been against Private Finance Initiative (PFI) and wanted rich people to pay more in taxes. He wants to stop people from not paying their taxes by adding a lot of money in HM Revenue and Customs.\nCameron has said that the National Health Service (NHS) should be \"completely publicly run and publicly accountable\". He is a supporter of the NHS Bill 2015. Cameron does not support the Private Finance Initiative.\nCameron did not support sending UK soldiers to take back the FA Islands. He said it was a \"waste of lives and money\".\nCameron has supported marriage for all people and rights for all people. Cameron voted for the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013, that allowed marriage for all people in EN and WA. He has been a longtime friend of the earth and does not support hydraulic fracturing. Cameron is a supporter of animal rights. He also wants the UK's train system to belong to the government and not businesses that want to make money.", "hash": "41ccc04f183d18db4b77be43353d774858ddb70bf6196ad574e803f0e33c09fc"}

{"idx": 3823, "text": "Fig\nA fig is a soft, sweet food. Its skin is very thin and has many small seeds inside of it. There are more than 850 types of the fig tree.\nThe fruits can be eaten when they are ready and when dried. Figs grow in warm places. Sometimes, people make figs into a sweet spread. Figs are also in a popular snack.\nFigs are helped to grow by small wasps.\nMany figs are grown for their fruit, but only the common fig is grown a lot for eating.\nThe fig is a special kind of food, where the flowers and seeds grow together to form a single thing. Depending on the type, each fruit can have many many seeds.\nA fig is made from a special type of many flowers. In this case, it is almost closed, with many small flowers inside.\nThen the real flowers of the fig are not seen unless the fig is cut open. It is a fruit without a seen flower.\nThe fig foods, important as food and medicine, have things that help you go to the bathroom, colors, sweet things, vitamins A and C, sour things and things that help your body work. However, figs can cause skin to become red and itchy, and the juice from the fig can hurt your eyes.\nSome fig farms do not need help from bugs to grow figs. They can grow figs that do not have seeds without fig bugs. This is how they do it.\nThe fig often has a round shape with a small hole at the end. This hole is used by bugs. The flowers inside the fig are visited by very small bugs who crawl through the hole looking for a place to have their babies.\nWithout this, fig trees can't grow from seeds. In turn, the flowers give a safe home and food for the next group of bugs. This has led to a special relationship.\nFig plants can be both male and female, or they can be female and another type that is both male and female. Almost half of fig types are the second kind, and they have flowers with long parts or they have flowers with male parts mixed with female parts that have short parts. The long parts of the flower make it hard for bugs to lay their eggs inside the seeds, while the short parts of the flowers are easy for bugs to lay their eggs.\nThe common fig is a plant that can be both male and female. This means its fruits are either both male and female and \"inedible figs\" or a type of fig. In some places, people used to think that a certain kind of fruit was only for goats to eat. This fruit is called 'goat fruit'. On the girl fruit trees, some parts don't grow; they make the \"yummy fruits\". \nSmall bugs live in the 'goat fruit' but not in the girl fruits. The girl fruit is too long for the bug to put her eggs in them. Still, the bug makes the flower turn into a fruit with the help from the 'goat fruit' it grew up in. When the bug stops living, it goes away inside the fruit. This means you don't eat the bug because it has disappeared. The bug doesn't give any sickness to people. \nThe yummy fruit is one of the first plants that people learned to grow. \nUsually \"only one kind of bug can turn the flowers of each type of fruit into fruit\". For example, in HA islands, people brought 60 types of fruits, but only four of the bugs that turn them into fruits. So only four types of fruits can have seeds there. This is a good friendship, where each fruit plant and bug helps each other. \nThe close friendship between different fruit types and their bugs, and the one-to-one plant-bug pair show a clear example of growing together. Recent looks have shown a close match in the growing and the way of growing of these two, fruits and bugs.", "hash": "5edb9423470d232ef6ca068305c2a1869468021e7a77ee9dba7b950838fd81f1"}

Generally, electronegativity goes up from the bottom-left to the top-right of a big table of small things; this is a pattern we can see.\nThere are many ways to find out how much an atom likes to take other atoms' bits.

It lasts a week, and it starts on the last Monday in August, and ends on the first Monday in September (which is also a holiday in US country). The party is called \"Big Party\" because a big wooden shape of a man is set on fire on a Saturday. This party has been happening every year since a long time ago. Many people go to the Big Party; one year, more than 55,000 people were there. The Black Rock desert is far from any cities or towns, and is very dry, so people who go to the Big Party have to bring their own water, food, and shelter.\nThe Big Party started a long time ago in a city called SA city. A man named Liam made a big shape of a man out of wood, and decided to set it on fire at a nearby beach for the longest day of the year. It was fun, so he did it again at the beach the next year, and then again a couple years after that. Each year the shape was made bigger. One year \u201cthe Man\u201d was almost as tall as a house, and another year it was almost as tall as a tree.\nOne year, the police told Liam he could not set the Man on fire because Liam did not have a paper that said he could.\nAround the same time, two men named Kevin and Jack were planning a group trip to a dry lake, called The Playground, in the Black Rock Desert. They were members of a group of funny people named the Funny Group. Liam decided to take the shape, which had been taken apart, to the desert to be set on fire. Since that time the party has happened in the desert.\nJack knew how to make bright signs, so starting a year after the first desert party, bright lights have been added to the Man.\nOne of the members of the Funny Group is named Matthew, who uses the name \u201cSilly Ranger\u201d. He was worried about people getting lost in the big sand place, which can be very scary. He started a group named the Big Rock Helpers to keep people safe, and to help stop fights.\nStarting in a year long ago, Henry got permission from the Land Care Group (who look after land owned by the US country) to hold the festival. The festival was getting more popular every year. In the first year about 250 people were there. In a few years about 4,000 people were there, and in a little more time it was about 10,000. In a big year there were about 25,000, and by a later year it had reached over 50,000 people. The festival has become so big, sometimes it is called \"Big Rock Town\" because it is like a small town.\nHenry wrote 10 rules to show how he thought people at the Big Fire Event should behave. These rules are:\nEveryone who goes to the Big Fire Event must have a ticket. Tickets must be bought before the festival starts.\nThe Big Fire Event is designed for walkers and people on bikes. Most cars can only be used for coming in or going out of the festival. Because there have been many car bumps in the past, cars are only allowed to go very slow.\nMoney is only allowed for a few things at the Big Fire Event. It can only be used to buy cold hard water, to buy hot drink and other drinks, to pay for big car services, to pay for help services like a car fixer or a key maker, and a few other things.\nNoisy boom things, lights in the sky, and dogs, are not allowed.\nMany artists like to show their art at a big festival. The place where the festival happens is very empty, like a big white paper.\nEvery year since a time long ago, Henry has chosen a theme. A theme is a word or idea that some artists use in their art. For example, one year the theme was \"Big Changes\", and another year the theme was \"CA ideas\".\nPeople who want to bring cars to drive around at the festival must ask for permission first. The group that gives permission is called the \"Big Car Group\", or BCG. The cars and buses must be changed to look very different from normal. These are called \"funny cars\". Funny cars often have pretty lights. Some funny cars can play music, and some can even make fire.\nThe city that is built for the festival is called \"Big Festival City\", or \"BFC\". Because it is so big, some helpers start building about 3 weeks before the festival starts. Some people also stay as long as 4 weeks after to clean-up and take everything apart.\nThe city has streets which are planned like a big clock.

This started the United Nations group for Human Rights. It was agreed upon by the World Meeting on Human Rights on a summer day in June.\nThe most important part is that \"all people have the same rights and they are all connected.\" This means that all matters about being nice to people must be treated with the same importance without exceptions. This story talks about a big promise made by many people from different places. The promise is about making sure everyone is treated fairly and kindly. It says no one should be treated badly because of where they are from, what they look like, or because they are different in some way. It also says that all women, children, and people who can't do some things because of their bodies should be protected and kept safe.\nTo make sure this happens, the promise asks all places to follow rules that protect everyone's rights and to make laws that help people when their rights are not respected. This is important for places to be fair and happy.\nThe promise also talks about how important it is to keep everyone safe and free. It says bad things like hurting others, selling bad things, and taking people away are wrong. It asks for all places to work together to stop these things. It also talks about helping people who need to leave their homes because of danger and teaching everyone about how to live in peace and fairness.\nThe promise also says that places that don't have a lot of things, especially in AF, should be helped to grow and become better. But it also says that not having a lot of things is not an excuse to treat people badly.

The study of little things is called studying little things.\\nLittle things include tiny bugs, tiny mushrooms, tiny old things, tiny mixed things and tiny sick things, and are among the first known life forms. The first of these four types of little things may either live on their own or live off others. Tiny sick things can only live off others, since they always grow inside other living things.\nTiny creatures\\nMost tiny creatures are made up of just one bit, but there are some you can see with your own eyes, and some that are so small, you need a special tool to see them.\nTiny creatures live almost everywhere where there is water, including hot springs deep in the ocean and inside rocks deep inside the earth. Some of these places are home to tiny creatures that like really extreme conditions.\nTiny creatures are important because they help break down things in nature. Some can even take special stuff out of the air that plants need to grow. Some tiny creatures are not good and can make other creatures sick.\nTiny creatures that live freely get their energy in many different ways. Some use sunlight, like plants do. Some break down things in their environment. Others eat things that were once alive, like fallen leaves and dead animals, helping them to break down. Some tiny creatures can make food go bad. Bad bread or fruit, sour milk, and bad meat are examples of food that has gone bad. In nature, these broken down things mix with soil, giving plants what they need to grow. Without this, the soil would run out of what plants need. These types of creatures are called helpers. They help recycle things in nature.\nTiny creatures also help us make some of our food, like bread, cheese, yogurt, beer, and juice. They eat the sweet stuff in grain, fruit, or milk, giving these foods a special feel and taste.\nSome tiny bugs, or germs, can make us sick. They live by getting into other living things. Chicken spots, big cheeks, and red spots are all caused by bad germs. Some tiny bugs are also germs. They cause many sick things including bad cough and stiff body. Certain bugs make your teeth bad. It is possible to keep people safe from some bad germs by keeping and making food the right way, cleaning the teeth, washing hands, and by not getting too close to sick people.\nAll animals seem to have tiny bugs living in or on them without hurting them. Sometimes, as with animals that eat plants, the tiny bugs help them digest food.

While working at a music company, he became a helper to two performers named David and Jack from a city called PH city.\nMatthew believed in David and Jack so much that he helped them do lots of shows and promotions. They even made some of the first music videos and went on one of the first big trips that was paid for by companies that make gum, electronics, and cars.\nDavid & Jack thanked Matthew in their song \"Gino (the Manager)\" on an album they made in 1975. Matthew was also mentioned in another song by a band he helped called Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band. (\"Matthew / Lives on the road ...\")\nMatthew was raised in one religion, but changed to another one before he married a woman named Lisa. He and Lisa had a daughter (Sophia) and a son (Michael, who now works at a place called MT place).\nA band from BR city wrote a song about how much they like Matthew for their 1999 album \"...Art\".\nIn a year in the late 20th century, Matthew was chosen to be the boss of CB Records when he was 37 years old.\nSoon after, a big company named SO bought a music group from CB.

At first, he didn't pay attention to it, but later he decided to listen to it. He liked the song he heard and found the singer, a girl named Madison who was not famous yet, and decided to work with her. Many people think that he played a big part in Madison's success in her first years of singing.\nIn a summer month in the 20th century, he and Madison had a big wedding. But they didn't stay together for long and separated before a Christmas in the late 20th century and were not husband and wife anymore by the beginning of the 20th century. In the year 2000, Madison, who was the most successful singer for CO company at that time, got a very big contract with VI company. But her first album for VI company, \"a famous song collection\", was not liked by many people. So, VI company decided not to work with her anymore and the big contract was cancelled. Madison then decided to work with IS company.\nHe had relationships with other famous people before he started dating a singer from ME country named Taylor.

A kid might be good at talking but not so good at writing, for example.\nIt is very hard to see which English tests are harder or easier. Every test is a little different.\nIn EU country, a group called AL group tells how different tests are. The AL group is a group that checks on language tests.

{"idx": 48977, "text": "Money Code\\nThere is a big rule for all the countries to use three letters to talk about their money. This rule was made by a big group who makes many important rules. It's a common way in banks and shops, all over the world, to talk about different types of money. In many places, these three letters are so popular that people even use them in newspapers or at banks instead of the real names of the money.\\nThe first two letters are usually the first two letters of the country's name. The last letter is usually the first letter of the money's name. So, for JA country, the money code is JPY, \"JP\" for JA country and \"Y\" for yen. This helps when the same name is used for money in many different countries. Also, if the money changes, they change the last letter of the code. Sometimes, they use the letter for \"new\" in their language to show that it's a new type of money. For example, the code for the money in ME country is MXN. Sometimes, other changes happen. For example, the money in RU country changed from RUR to RUB, where the B comes from the third letter in their word for their money.\nThere is a special three-number code for each type of money, just like each place has a special three-number code. For example, US money (US dollar) has the code 840 which is the same as the code for the US place.\nThe rules also tell how big money and small money relate to each other. Often, the small money is worth 1/100 of the big money, but sometimes it's 1/1000. Some types of money do not have small money at all. In some places, the big money has so little value that the small money is not used much. For example, US money has 2 zeros after the 1, while JP money has no zeros. MU place doesn't divide their money into small parts with a point, they have 1 big money (ouguiya) = 5 small money (khoums), and MG place has 1 big money (ariary) = 5 small money (iraimbilanja).\nThese codes are not only for types of money, but also for precious things like gold, silver, and certain other things used in big business. Special X Things\\nThere are some special codes that start with the letter \"X\". These are used for testing or when there's no money involved. Silver, for example, is called XAG. These \"X\" codes are never used for places, they are just used for special things. There are also imaginary place codes that start with \"X\", like XXB for a make-believe place called \"BR land\" or XXR for \"RE land\". So, \"X\" codes can be used for things that are not tied to any place.\\nThere are some kinds of money that are used by lots of places, like the EA money, the CF money, the CF money BE and the CF money BC. These are usually also given codes that start with an \"X\". The EU money, for example, is called EUR because EU is a special code for the European Union. The old EU money was called XEU.\\nIn the early 20th century, a group of people decided to make these codes for money and other things that we use in buying and selling or in banks. In a big meeting in the second month of the year, some important people agreed to use three-letter words for different types of money used in different places. These words are easy to use when we are trading things between places.\nSometimes, new types of money are made and old types are not used anymore. This can happen when there is a new leader or when countries agree to use the same money, or when the value of the money changes a lot. So, the list of these three-letter words has to be updated sometimes. A group called SI group keeps this list updated.\nHere is a list of the three-letter words for the types of money that are still being used.\nThere is also a list of three-letter words for types of money that are not official but are still used.\nThe money used in US country has three different three-letter words: USD, USS (for the same day), and USN (for the next day). \nSome places are not included in this system because their money is not completely separate, it is only used for special occasions, or the place is not fully recognized. Different kinds of money:\nSome types of money are used a lot, even if they are not part of the usual list:\nSome kinds of money were part of the big list of different moneys until they were replaced by the euro or other kinds of money.\nBe aware that the names of the money used here may not be the same as the names used in the big list, but the codes are the same.", "hash": "f2292a9c7fbdca8af42049788a7fb3f787344d5c7fe4eb4fef863d21c6809b14"}

UN company agreed, and a writer, Adam, was hired.\nAdam travelled with the Bugs on a music tour. He was to write a made-up story at first, based on how the band interacted with other people, but Adam decided the best story to tell was real, based on what he saw. The \"grandpa\" character (played by William) was added to make older people happy. William was a popular television actor, who starred in \"ST and S\" (similar to \"SA and S\") as a \"dirty old\" junk dealer.\nEven with a script, the Bugs made up some of their own words in the movie. They also acted out ideas from the director, Richard.\nIn the movie's story, the Bugs go to LO city to perform in a television program. Patrick's family send along his grandpa, so he and Patrick can spend time together. The grandpa likes to play tricks and make people argue. (People also say he is \"very tidy\".

There is the K+ and the K0. The + and 0 tell us if the Kiddie Particle is happy, or 0 (not happy or sad). The K+ is made of one happy bit, and one weird different bit. Different bits have the opposite feeling of their same bit (and since normal weird bits have a feeling of -1/3), 2/3 + 1/3 = a +1 feeling, or simply a + feeling. (Also because different bits have the opposite feeling of their same bit, if you change the happy bit in a K+ to a happy different bit and the weird different bit to a normal weird bit, you get the opposite feeling, forming a K-). Let's think about a special particle named K. K can be made of two smaller parts. Both parts have something we call 'charge'. If one part is a 'down' part and the other is an 'up' part, their charges cancel out and K has no charge.

The story happens in NE city and LO island in NE state.\n\"The Good Book\" is one of the stories that many people in US country like a lot. The book was one of the best books of the 20th century according to a big library group. \"Time Magazine\" also said it's one of the best books from 1923 to 2005. A study found that more than half of the schools teach \"The Good Book\" in their English class.\nThe story is told by Nick, a man who moved to LO island, NE state, from the middle part of the country. Nathan is not rich, but he lives in a fancy place with two towns called EA town and WE town. The \"old rich\" live in EA town while the \"new rich\" live in WE town. Nathan lives in a small house in WE town. Nathan's next-door friend is Jack. Jack likes Nathan's cousin Diana. But, Diana is married to a man named Thomas. The story is about Jack and his hope that he can make Diana his friend instead of Thomas.\nThe story happens in a summer long ago. Nathan, a man who grew up in the middle of AM country, tells the story. Nathan, who once fought in a big war and went to a big school, wants a more fun life. He moves to NE city, to be a salesman. There, he rents a house in the small community of WE town. The person living next to him is Jack, a man who no one knows much about but has a lot of money. Jack also has many big parties often. But, he never joins his own parties; because of this, many stories are created about who Jack really is. Nathan goes to visit his cousin Diana in EA town. There, he meets her husband, Thomas. He is also introduced to her friend, Jessica. Nathan learns from her that Thomas has been friends with another woman named Madison. Nathan decides to wait and see what happens.\nIn the warm time, Nathan is invited to a party at Gabriel's house. There, he meets Gabriel himself, a young and nice man. Nathan learns that Gabriel was once good friends with Daisy, a long time ago. Gabriel still likes her a lot, and spends many nights looking at the green light from Daisy's house across his big house. He hopes that he can make Daisy like him with his nice things and big parties. Gabriel grew up not having a lot and this made him want to have a lot of nice things so Daisy would like him. Gabriel asks Nathan to help him see Daisy. Nathan invites them both over for tea, and they start to like each other again. They then start to be more than friends.\nAfter a short time, Thomas notices that Daisy and Gabriel like each other. The group meets at a big building, where Daisy has to pick between Gabriel and Thomas. She picks Thomas, and the group starts to go home. On the way, Daisy, driving Gabriel's car, hits Myrtle by accident. Gabriel tells Nathan that he will say it was his fault to protect Daisy. Later, he is then hurt really bad by Myrtle's husband, George, who thinks that Gabriel did it. George then hurts himself.\nNathan has a goodbye event for Gatsby, but not many friends come even though Gatsby was well-known. Feeling mad and unhappy about all the things that happened, Nathan chooses to go away from NY city and go back to the middle part of the country.", "hash": "3b2e38a3a756d813e5b5c15363f578035d80e367b54c047bcf252c9190c4cca2"}

{"idx": 745, "text": "Light bits\\nLight bits (from a GR word meaning \"light\"), in many things we use to understand how stuff works, are tiny things which carry light. In other words, light is moved from one place to another by light bits. Light bit is a simple tiny thing that is its own opposite. In how we understand tiny things, each light bit has a bit of power that depends on how often it happens: A light bit associated with light that happens more often will have more power (and be associated with light that is quicker).\\nLight bits don't weigh anything (zero). However, a very smart man's idea says that they do move a certain way. Before the light bit got its name, the smart man brought back the idea that light is separate pieces of power (tiny things). These tiny things are called light bits. A light bit has a special name, \u03b3 (gamma), but we can just call it a light bit.\nLight bits are very important. They can appear and disappear, but they can exist forever.\nIn empty space, all light bits move very fast, as fast as light! They move so fast, it's like running around the Earth seven times in just one second!\nA light bit has a special thing called its frequency, which makes it a certain color. Radio uses this a lot. But for some light bits that we can't see, like X-Ray light bits and heat light bits, we don't talk about frequency as much. Frequency also tells us how much energy a light bit has. Cameras and some other machines use the energy from these light bits.\nA light bit also has something called its wavelength. It's like the length of the light wave. The frequency, wavelength, and speed of light are all connected.\nA small bit of light is called a photon. Imagine if a huge photon was coming right at you, it could look like it's moving up and down, side to side, or somewhere in between. Some sunglasses can stop these up and down moving photons. This is how they help us see better when the sun is very bright. Some screens also use this to control which light comes through. Some animals can even see this light movement.\nPhotons can also spin around. This spin is linked to how light can move in circles.\nLight can be made or taken in when a tiny bit inside a thing called an electron gets more or less energy. This energy can come from heat or movement. Like when a light bulb gets hot and gives off light. The extra energy can make an electron move up a level. But this makes it unstable, and it wants to go back down to a lower energy level. (If this is hard to understand, think about dropping a pencil. Once it hits the ground, it has less energy). When the electron goes back down, it has to let go of the extra energy. It does this by making photons, and if there's a lot of them, we can see it as light.\nIn the world of tiny particles, photons are responsible for a force that's linked to electricity and magnetism. Electromagnets\\nElectromagnets is a big word that talks about how electricity and magnets work together. One way we see this every day is with light, which is made by electricity and magnets working together. Electromagnets also make things solid, which is why you can't put your hand through a table. There are tiny things called photons that help make electromagnets work. There is a special kind of stuff, called dark stuff, that we think doesn't work with electricity and magnets. This means dark stuff doesn't have a charge and doesn't make light.", "hash": "28fdb0fcc48aacefd7cca7f5fc466b40d9333cb2f139410e2afaedc0556a206f"}

It was a big deal all over the country, and all three women were taken by the police and judged for doing something wrong.\nAll three women were said to have done something wrong. After some time, people said they were not wrong, and what they did was good. This made big changes in the rules about teaching not having babies and learning about our bodies all over the world. The place closed but later became the start of a place we now know as PP.\nBella\\nBella was taken away by the police because she was sharing information about controlling the number of babies people have. She had to stay for 30 days in a place called BI place. Bella was put in BI place on a winter day for standing up for what she believed in and then she stopped eating food. Bella's sister, Sophia, was worried that Bella would die because she wasn't eating and Bella was made to eat after going a long time without food or water. As a person who tells stories of the past says in \"a famous book,\" Bella was the first woman in US who was made to eat while she was in prison for fighting for what she believed in. Mrs. Bella was ready to starve herself for what she believed in. Her case was the first in a group of cases known as the \"Sophia cases\" to be tried.\n\nSophia supported Bella's fight. Their time in BI place helped people all over the country know about their fight for the ability to control the number of babies people have. But, it also made their relationship not so good because Sophia became more famous after this and she would sometimes take credit for Bella's famous decision to stop eating.\n\nEven though her sister became very famous for her fight to control the number of babies people have, not many people know about Bella. This can be seen on a website, where it is said Sophia started her clinic with \"her sister\". Bella is not even mentioned by her name and unlike her older sister is not well known\n\nBella had a sickness and died in the middle of the 20th century. She did not live to see the day when the pill to control the number of babies people have became legal, as she died five years before it was approved by the FDA.", "hash": "05b37339fdaad2377f9f37ee57a7dfd6d9ebb310bff2addcc9b22728dd8e5ec0"}

People all over the world study how different countries trade using the ideas Liam had.\\nLiam worked as the head teacher of money studies at a MI university. Liam believed that studying how people make choices is very important. Liam shared the big prize in 2007 with two other men, Ethan and Roger, for their work on understanding how people make choices.\\nLiam was born in MO city, RU country to a family who followed the Jewish faith just before a big change in the country. His family came from a part of PO country that was part of RU country at the time, but they moved to RU country to escape a big war. Soon after Liam was born, the family moved back to WA city, in PO country. Henry and his family were treated very badly by some bad people because they were different. He had to leave his home when a bad man came to his country in the late 20th century. His mom, dad and brother had to go to a place called RU country where they were taken by the bad people and made to work very hard. Henry had to move to different places before he finally came to the US country in the 1940s. His family joined him there after a while.\nHenry hired a woman named Emma to help him with his work. Emma grew up on a farm and was learning about how people buy and sell things at a big school. Henry and Emma got married in the middle of the 20th century and later, lived by a big river in a place called MI city. They have four children named Sophia, Matthew, Rachel and Maxim.\nHenry likes learning about words, old things, how our body works and music. He has worked on studying the weather and is part of a big group that tries to control the weather. When a man named Eugene ran to be the leader of US country (in the late 20th century), Henry was part of the group that chooses the leader and a part of another group that decides what they believe in.\nHenry got very sick and died in MI city, when he was a very old man.\nHenry's dad wanted him to learn about laws and he did. In the late 20th century, Henry finished his studies at a big school. He liked learning about how people buy and sell things and went to a big school in LO city with two men named Nathan and Frank. In 1939, Isaac moved to a place called GE city where he studied at a big school and learned from a man named Ludwig. After moving to US country, he learned more about how people buy and sell things at two big schools named HA university and CH university. Professor Isaac didn't have a paper saying he was good at learning about how people buy and sell things, but he won a big prize for it in 2007. He said, \"Whatever I learned, I learned by listening and learning.\"\nIn 1941, Isaac was helping a man named Patrick teach at MA university and helping a man named Oliver teach at CH university. At IL school during a big war, Isaac taught about machines to the US army. Then from 1942 to 1944, at CH university, he taught about how the weather works and how to understand numbers in the Department of Buying and Selling Things. His helpers in 1942 were two men named Jack and Kevin from CH university, who now work for a place called CO Foundation at YA university.\nIsaac received a big award for 1945\u20131946. In 1946 he became a teacher of how people buy and sell things at IO college. From the first month of 1942 until the middle of 1946, he was a researcher for the CO Commission. He worked a lot for the CO Commission until October 1950. From the start of 1951, he was a visiting teacher, teaching classes that were taught before by Professor Kevin in the Department of Buying and Selling Things, and he was a very important teacher there. He was also a teacher of money and numbers at the IL university, and helped out at the RA company and the US government. Henry kept helping the CO group until around 1961.\nHenry got a job from Walter at the MI university in 1951. There, he became a teacher of money and numbers. He did most of his work in MI, but he also studied and taught in other places in the US and AS country. In 1955 and 1958, Henry visited and taught at ST university. There, he wrote a book about how to share things fairly between people who buy, sell, and the government. He taught at BA university in 1965 and, during the 1980s, at TO university, PE university (now RE university of CH country) and the IN university.

In 2007, his school said that he was still studying how to compare and understand different ways people can work together, how to make everyone happy, how to reach goals we want for everyone, and how to create rules for working together. Henry's books and articles on these topics go back to 1944. Henry is known all around the world for his good work studying how people work together, especially when it comes to rules for big companies and leaders using numbers. In the 1950s, he worked with Adam on a difficult problem. Adam became the youngest person to receive a big award in 1972. Henry helped David, who won a big award in 2000.\nHenry's work was important to help show how we should study big ways people work together. Some of these ways are when people own their own businesses and when the leaders own everything. Henry's ideas of how to share things are also very important. The idea of making sure everyone gets what they want that Henry developed changed the way many people think about sharing in the future, explaining why some ways of working together may fail and how giving certain people rewards make a difference when making choices.\nHenry is part of teams who write several books. He helped write and add to two books for a big school: \"Studies in Sharing Things\" (1978, with Adam) and \"Goals for Everyone and Working Together\" (1987, with David and Frank). His recent books include \"Thinking about Work\" (2003, with Thomas), \"Designing Work\" (2001, with Samuel) and \"Using Numbers for Work\" (2003, with Matthew). Henry\\nHenry taught some important things from some people like Frank (1963), Ryan (1972), David (1989) and Cameron (1997).\\nHenry was chosen to be part of a big group of people who study numbers in 1947 and in 1969 he was the leader of this group. Henry became part of the AM country group of Art and Science in 1965. In 1974 he was made a part of a group of people who study everything about our world and in 1977 was made a special person of the AM country group of people who study how we buy and sell things. Henry was given a special award in 1990 by the leader of the US, George, for studying how people behave and how they live together, given to him for his new ideas about how to share things in our world.\\nHe worked for a big group called the United Nations in 1948 and the US group of people who study everything in 1954. In 1964 he was a part of a group who studies how we can change the weather. He is a part of the AM country group of people who study on their own (1979) and a special person of the CA group of people who study everything (1984).\\nHenry has received six special awards from NW University (1980), UC school (1993), BA school (1989), KU school (1993), WS school (1994) and BU school (2004). He is a special teacher of the HU School of Economics (1984).\nSome special things are named after a man named Henry, like the 'Henry rule'. This was an idea Henry had in the middle of the 20th century, and it's very important for how people trade things. This 'Henry rule' is also known as \"when things are not sure\". Henry had the idea of mixing the work of a man named Adam with the work done by a man named Patrick in the early 19th century. The 'Henry rule' tells people to think really hard about what is good and bad before they decide what to do. Different ways of using the 'Henry rule' have been thought about. A man named Samuel made some changes to the first 'Henry rule' a few years later. The work of these four men \u2013 Patrick, Adam, Henry, and Samuel \u2013 that the 'Henry rule' is based on was studied, used, and made better for more than fifty years by many different people. But some people say the work was started by a man named Benjamin.\n\nThe 'Henry Talk' is given to a group of people who study how things are traded in MN. Jack, Robert, Roger, Edward, James, Nancy and Neil are some of the people who have given the talk since it was thought to be important in the early 90s.\n\nIn a fall month in 2007, Henry shared a big prize with Eric from a place for smart people and Roger from a big school called UC \"for helping start the way we design how things work\". During a phone talk, someone from the NO group told Henry and his wife that Henry is the oldest person to get the NO prize. Henry said, \"I hope that others who should get it also got it.\" When he was asked what the most important part of making plans is, he said it's about making sure everyone is happy. The three NO prize winners used ideas from a smart man named Nathan, to find out the best way to get a good result, without forgetting each person. These ideas have been used to guide talks and sharing, voting and picking leaders, to make sales such as those for talking from far away, picking leaders and talking about work and for setting prices for businesses.\nProfessor Henry was not able to go to the NO prize party in ST city because he is old, Henry got the prize in MI city. With Emma, his wife for sixty years, and his family, he was the most important guest at a meeting in the University of MI with the university president Robert. After watching the NO prize party on TV, Jonas, the SW country's person in the UN city, gave the Economy Prize to Professor Henry.", "hash": "e8f9c6d9ded3427edfb9092a49c28a3d47d639e6b2308c69338bbb8ce20e6f1d"}

{"idx": 12062, "text": "Matthew\nMatthew\\nMatthew (born on a winter day in February, 1963) is a man who used to play a game called basketball in AM country. Many people think he was the best basketball player ever. He won six big games and was the best player in the final game 6 times. He played for two teams: one in CH city and one in WA city. Matthew helped his team in CH city win a lot of games in one year. Because he could jump very high and make a basket while jumping from a line, people gave him names like \"Flying Matthew\". Matthew won two gold medals when he played basketball for his country in a big sports event. When he was younger, people called him Mike, and some people still call him Mike now.\\nMatthew was born in NE city, his mom, Diana, worked in a bank, and his dad, James, was a man who took care of machines. When Matthew was very little, his family moved to WI city.\\nMatthew has two older brothers, Larry and James, an older sister, Diana, and a younger sister, Rachel. His brother James stopped working in 2006, and he was a very important person in the army.\\nWhen Matthew was in high school in WI city, he wasn't on the main team of the basketball game. This made him want to be better, so he worked hard and joined the team the next year. In the early 1980s, he went to a big school in NO city to play. He scored a lot of points in his first and second years. Under his coach David's rules, no player was allowed to score more than 20 points in a game. NO city team won the big game in the second year, with Jack scoring the last basket. After three years in school, Jack decided to leave school to play in the big league. The CH team picked him in the big player selection. He was never the team leader in school.\nJack was in a famous song video by a man named Michael in the early 1990s. In the video, Michael teaches Jack how to dance and Jack teaches Michael how to play basketball. In the mid-1990s, after winning three big games in a row, Jack said that he would stop playing basketball and try to play baseball. He played for the BI team, a small team in the CH team's group, but only scored once during his whole baseball time. In the mid-1990s, Jack said that he would play basketball again with just two words: \"I'm back\". He came back just in time to play for the CH team in the big games, but the CH team lost before they could reach the final game. However, the next three years after that, the BU team won the big game. This included one year, when the BU team won a lot of games in the regular season and only lost a few. In that same year, he was in a funny movie called \"SP movie\" as himself. Jack stopped playing for a second time, but he still wanted to play. He bought part of the WA team, and played for the WA team for two years, and then he stopped playing for good.\nDuring his time playing, Jack made a lot of winning shots in games. He also made two free throws in a game in NJ city, on a day in March. While making the free throws, a man named William said, \"Jack, so cool under pressure\".\nJack played a lot of shooting guard. Other than a short time in one month during which he played point guard, Jack almost always played shooting guard during his time with the BU team. He was very good at basketball. He could score from anywhere on the court and was very good at free throws, as well as being the best defensive shooting guard. He is thought of as the best offensive player of all time, because of his ability to drive, finish at the rim and mid-range game. He scored using post-ups, layups - often reverse layups, dunks, three-pointers and fadeaways. He was very good at jumping and could move easily in the air. These two things, along with his big hands, let him hold the ball in many ways while in the air. He was good at scoring points, even when the other team tried to stop him, and could often score three points in one play. During one time, he scored an average of 37.1 points each game. He was also good at catching the ball after a missed shot. Sometimes he would scare his teammates or the other team. He wore a suit to every big game. He was very focused and worked hard.\nHe now owns most of the CH team. He was chosen to be part of the BA Hall of Fame in 2009.", "hash": "5e0d9e3d4c828587126f32f4f6725ec92b223aee2d9a32c87ce19423eb8884b1"}

{"idx": 2775, "text": "SP city\nSP city is a place in GR country. It's in the south of a big area called PE land. Long ago, it was very strong. Today, it's a small city with many people living there.\nThe word \"Spartan\" is used to describe someone who lives a simple life or a person who had a hard time but didn't show they were sad or hurt. It can also mean living simply, without fancy or costly things.\nSP city is in a place with lots of hills and mountains. This is in the south-east of PE land. Old SP city was built near a river called EV river. The river flows through a valley with mountains on each side. To the west is a big mountain and to the east is another big mountain. Because the old city had such good natural protections, they didn't need walls around the city.\nIn the old times, SP city was a place with a very strong group of protectors and a group of leaders who did their job well. SP city was known as one of the strongest places in GR country. Only the strongest lived in SP city, boys or girls. If a baby was too weak, they left it out in the cold on a hill. This place was called 'the place where things are left'. \nSP city had a group of people who made the rules and made sure everything was fair. There were two kings who were in charge. The people of the city helped make the rules. The oldest people in the city made sure the rules were followed. There was also a group of five men who looked after how the little boys and girls learned. Boys and girls were taken from their moms and dads when they were 7. Boys lived with other boys their age. Girls went to school to learn running, wrestling, and other activities, all to become strong moms for future children.\n\"Love for SP\" is when people really like SP city and how the people there live. People liked SP city a lot when it was in charge. A long time ago, \"Many of the good and kind people from AT city always thought SP city was almost perfect\". Many people who thought a lot about how to live a good life, especially those who liked PL, often said SP city was a good place, strong, brave, and free.\nSP city was also looked at as a model of how to live a good life by FR country a long time ago.\nAdam thought SP city was very good. He said a long time ago that GE country should be like them by having fewer people. The people in SP city had made \"the first state that cared about who was allowed to live\".\nYoung boys in SP city were taken from their homes when they were seven to begin a life of learning how to protect their city. The SP people became big boys at age 20, big people at age 30, and stopped working at age 60. Boys trained hard to become strong helpers of the SP group. Girls were told to stay fit so they could have fit, strong babies. SP people didn't think much about having babies; unless the baby could grow up to be strong, he wouldn't live.\nSP boys got married when they were 30 years old. Peter writes about the odd thing SP people did on their wedding night:\nThe way was to take girls for marriage...The...'helper' took care of the taken girl. She first cut her hair...then dressed her in a boy's cloak and shoes, and laid her alone on a bed in the dark. The husband...first had dinner...then would sneak in...lift her and carry her to the bed. The husband kept on visiting his wife secretly for some time after the wedding. Only SP people did these things. Some people think that the cutting of the wife's hair was a thing that showed she was starting a new life.\nSP people took over the people of ME and LA (the places around) at a long time ago. These people were called the \"helots\". They were \"not\" slaves: they were helpers. They had a lower place in the group, like helpers in old times.\nHelpers spent their lives working on their SP masters' land (land given to SP people). The SP poet Thomas says helpers were allowed to marry and keep half the fruits of their work. Most times, there were more helpers than their SP masters. They tried to fight back many times, but they never won.\nOnce a SP person became 20 years old, he or she would then become a \"helper\". A helper was a member of the leading group. Both boys and girls were part of this group. SP was a special place where girls were seen as equal to boys.\nThe SP army used a special way to fight. This helped them win many fights. But they are most known for a big fight where 300 SP people fought a big PE army for a week.", "hash": "c3b453ee288ca56635758a57824f842c9aa291f3a4167e4e97b6fd09636a809d"}

{"idx": 106923, "text": "A Famous Game Scare\\nIn the 1980s, a famous game called \"Dragons & Castles\" was blamed and said to be bad, and leading people to do bad things.\\nSome people were scared because of their beliefs and because they didn't understand. This made them say wrong things about stuff that was different from what they knew. The time when people didn't like a certain game changed how the game was played forever. People had to learn new rules. Some people wanted to stop the game completely, but in the end people found a way to agree and lots of people enjoy the game today.\nIn the past, people were very scared of bad magic. This started when a mom thought her little girl's daycare was teaching her bad things. Daycare was a new thing then and moms and dads were worried about their kids being safe. This mom's words made other parents say things that weren't true.\nThe kids who were asked about it never said anything bad. Parents were so upset that some people scared the kids into saying what they wanted to hear. Words like this were said all over the place, about music and card games. The game was a big part of those words.\nThe game was maybe the first true make-believe game. Lots of people were scared of bad magic and because of all these stories about the game, bad things, people started being scared of the game too. A big magazine wrote a story about the game being bad.\nEven though it was not true, it still made people scared of bad magic. This fear made problems for people who make sure we follow the rules. For example, three teenagers who were blamed for doing a very bad thing, were blamed just because people were scared of bad magic. Even a policeman changed a story because he was scared of getting into trouble.\nJames, a young man, was not seen again in 1979 from his place in MI University. He was found safe in the small tunnels of the school two days later by a man named Jack after James tried to hurt himself. His mom found a sad note from him the day before. The note talked about James's character in a game needing to go because a scary monster told him to hurt himself.\nHis mom blamed the game completely. James had many problems in his mind that people didn't know much about, like feeling very sad, hearing voices, and feeling worried all the time. William, the man who found James, thought that the game had made James do these things.\nPeople who tell news thought this was true and started to be very angry at the game. William thought James went into the tunnels to play a real-life version of the game. A year later, James died. This story was the base for a famous book and a movie about mazes and monsters.\nIn a year called 1983, a boy named Irving also hurt himself and people said it was because of the game. Irving\u2019s mom, Patricia, started a group because she was worried about the game. Ms.Patricia found other game players who did bad things like James, a boy who hurt his school head, hurt three friends, then hurt himself. People thought that teenagers could not see the difference between make-believe and real life, and that all these bad things were because of that, especially because many sad notes talked about the game.\nIn the summer of 1983. People found Irving and his brother not alive under a big bridge. Irving had a gun in his hand. People thought it was a very sad story. Patrick saw the story as more than just sad. He blamed Irving's favorite game, a game of make-believe, for his sadness.\nFriends say the place they were found was a place the boys would go to play their game. People found out that earlier that day Irving's game character had a bad spell cast on him. The spell was supposed to make his character feel very sad. Patrick thought the spell was real, and was the reason for his sadness.\nPatrick's mom said her thoughts about the game being bad had to be true because no one would be able to write about it with so much detail without knowing a lot about scary things. Some characters from the original make-believe game were monsters, with different levels of power over the characters. Patrick's mom was upset with Irving's school for letting the kids play there. The school leader said that the game was not part of what the kids learned at school, and so the problem went away.\nPeople who know a lot about health found no link between the game and being mean. Yet, Patrick's mom continued her fight by starting a group called BA. BA's messages spread all over the world. Patrick's mom wrote a book called \"The Bad Web - Who is Following Your Kid?\". In it she said players will become very bad people who will do very bad things. (From Patrick's mom's book)\nSome people still thought the fun game was good. Michael, a man who writes, wrote things like The Pulling Report and The Truth About Role-Playing Games to show that Pulling's ideas about the fun game were not right. Michael found that the people who played these games were actually happier than most people.\nAfter a while, because of the bad talk, the people who made the game changed it. James, a man who helped make the game, took out some scary things and some magic from the game. James wrote about why he did this in Dragon, a book about these games, saying that \"Avoiding the Angry Mother Syndrome has become a good, basic rule, for all of the people who make the game.\". In later versions, some of the things they took out were put back in a separate book for older readers. (From a book about monsters)\nToday, the game is played all over the place, and moms and dads can feel safe knowing that their kids are not becoming bad people.", "hash": "bbd5649e044cb6c6db3312a0139412d0b45966eb0d15f726be895210c55db854"}

The ticket is given by the people who run the rides and can be used on any ride.\nBefore Travelcards were used, people in the big city had to pay every time they changed from one ride to another. This was a problem as it made people wait while buying the next ticket.\nOne ticket for all rides in the big city was one of the big promises made in 1981 by the new leaders of the big city, headed by Ken. The rule, with the words \"Just The Ticket\", meant that you only needed one ticket for LO city buses and underground trains. They also made the cost of travel cheaper. The lower cost was then said to be not allowed, but the one price plan mostly worked well and was used more during the 1980s and 1990s as new ways to travel were made in LO city.\nBy 1985, there were two types of cards: the Travelcard itself, which was just for LO city Buses and the Underground, and the Capitalcard, which was for most buses, Underground and local trains. The Travelcard took the place of the original Capitalcard, and was used more, around 1989.\nThe original \"zonal\" system was mainly in a big part of LO city. The zone areas used both letters and numbers for the far zones such that bus use didn't care about the letter while train and Underground use also cared about the letter(s) - for example, a Travelcard or Capitalcard good in zone 3a (but not 3b or 3c) was good on buses in zones 3a, 3b and 3c but only in zone 3a when used on the train services.\nA Travelcard lets the holder use the following ways to travel within a big part of LO city:\nTravelcards also let the holder get a smaller price on some LO city River Services.", "hash": "fec203aea5e0cc558cd6c65ea87f5901c0777bc0c53be2b286365538d2cc1bb6"}

Then, style changed and men's clothes became more relaxed, with pants worn lower and belts used more. Now, they are not worn as much.", "hash": "172c2b98c71528bee4af0f5bedfccd9669e1d5761568ef018f5a1c89f4fa3e6d"}

They are known for a painful bite. This bite uses a base, not an acid.\nIn a year long ago, some ants called fire ants came to the US country from SO country by a big boat. They were in a lot of dirt. The boats carried heavy things like machines from US to SO country and brought back light things like food. The dirt was there to keep the boats from tipping over. Sometimes, there were fire ants in the dirt.\nIn the US country, fire ants have no animals that eat them or compete with them. They became a new kind of ant there. Animals that lived there first are not used to these ants. Fire ants are very mean. Their groups can have many queens unlike many other ants. Because of this, fire ants have spread very fast. By the time it was 1965, there were fire ant hills on the east coast and as far as a place called TE state. Today they are found in at least 10 states in the south. There is a separate group of fire ants living in CA state.\nFire ants have caused a lot of problems as they have spread across the US country. Because they are attracted to electricity, they chew through wires. This can cause problems with the electricity. Fire ants have also disturbed the balance of nature. In some places, they have caused 70% of the native ant types and 40% of other native bugs to disappear.\nEach year, about 25,000 people go to see the doctor because of painful bites from fire ants. Fire ants attack in groups when disturbed. People often get many bites. Fire ant bites are usually not dangerous but some people are allergic to fire ants. They may get very scared. This is a big sickness. This can be very bad for them.\nThe fire ants have been in the US for a long time, about 80 years. People try to use about 157 things, like cleaning liquid, car fuel, some parts of animal waste, and bug-killing sprays, to stop the fire ants. But, none of them worked very well. By the time when many people had grown up, the leaders had only let people use one kind of food to trick the fire ants.", "hash": "3346bb9e706947b17a03cf92c2e7860b68767360e5cefd370f901beb90e8b7a2"}

{"idx": 27133, "text": "BB News Weather\nBB News Weather is a part of BB News that tells us about the weather. The people who tell us about the weather work for the MO Office. The person who told us about the weather for the longest time was Michael, who worked there for 30 years between a long time ago and not so long ago.\nThe first time BB News Weather told us about the weather was for ships on the radio a very long time ago. The first time they told us about the weather every day was a little bit later.\nIn a year with a lot of threes and sixes, BB News Weather tried using the first weather maps on television. Weather maps were first seen in \"The Big Paper\" a long time ago. BB News started showing the maps on TV after a big war. The map filled the whole TV screen, and a voice from someone we couldn't see would talk about the weather for the next day.\nOn a day in winter a long time ago, George was the first weather person to stand in front of a weather map. To do this, the maps were drawn by hand in LO city Weather Centre and were taken across LO city. The forecasts were shown by the same person who had made them, and they were not always right.\nIn a year with a lot of sixes and twos, a machine that sends pictures and a machine that thinks were bought by the MO Office. This helped people know about the weather faster and better.\nFrom the year after 1963, people could look at pictures from space, but these pictures were not clear and had to be drawn on paper. This changed in the year after 1972 when a new machine came. This machine made the weather guesses two times better than before.\nAs the machines got better, the pictures also got better. At first, people drew maps by hand. Then they used magnets to show things on the map. Then they used a special machine to make pictures. All these changes helped the person telling about the weather to show things better.\nAt first, the magnets did not stick well to the maps. Sometimes, they made mistakes in writing (like writing 'GOF' instead of 'FOG'). But these mistakes helped the person telling the weather to show how the weather would change. The magnets were easy to understand without needing to read anything else.\nIn the year after 1984, they started using machine pictures, but they kept the same symbols. These weather guesses were very easy to understand and won a prize from a special TV group.\nMaybe the most famous weather person is a man named Michael. Michael was liked for being friendly and for wearing funny clothes (he once wore a jacket with all the weather symbols). Even though he made a big mistake before a big storm in 1987, people still liked him.\nBefore the storm, Michael started talking about the weather with a famous saying. Even though he was talking about a big storm in the FL country and said there would be a storm in the SO part of EN country, people still remember this as a big mistake.\nIn the fall of 2000, the BB company made some big changes to how they showed the weather. They didn't change the old weather pictures much, but they added new ones to show how much pollen and sun there was. They also used a new map of the BR country that showed more details because it was made from pictures taken from space.\nIn the middle of May in 2005, they stopped using the old weather pictures on TV after they had been used for almost 30 years. They were replaced by a new way of showing the weather that some people didn't like. They started using a round map instead of a flat one, and they showed the weather with different colors. They showed clouds by making the map brighter or darker, and they showed rain and snow with moving blue and white colors.\nThe new weather pictures were made by a company called WX from the NZ country.\nSome people liked the new weather pictures because they thought they were better and more modern, but other people didn't like them. They didn't like the brown color used for the land, and they thought the new weather pictures were too expensive. They also didn't like how the map was tilted to show the round shape of the Earth, because it made some places look too small and other places look too big. This made some people in SC country say that the BB company liked LO city more than other places. So, the BB company changed the map again and made the tour of the BR country longer.\nThe new weather pictures won a big prize in 2006. But, some people are still not happy with them. They don't like the colors, and they say that the weather pictures don't show enough details for more than a day and a half.\nThe BB company has been making changes to the weather pictures since 2005. In 2006, a new way to show water moving was started for big waters like seas and oceans.\nThe BB channel's weather website shows what the weather will be like in UK and other places using moving pictures.

{"idx": 9581, "text": "Pictures Words\\nPictures words, or symbols words, are a kind of writing that uses drawings or signs to stand for sounds and words. The EG people, LU people, and MA people are among those who used pictures words. They have also been found in TU country, CR island, US country, and CA country.\\nWe think they started when drawings were used to tell stories on pots and other things we make. After a while, the drawings became letters.\\nThe word \"pictures words\" comes from the GR people's language, and it was first used to mean EG people's pictures words. The GR people who came to EG country saw the picture letters, which were often found on houses, big graves, and big stones.\\nOld EG people used pictures to make a sound alphabet, so that each sound could be written with a picture-word. For example, a zig-zag for water became the letter \"n\", because the EG word for water started with n. This same picture became our letter 'M' in the LA letters, because the SE word for water started with m, and SE workers changed the symbols to fit sounds in their own language. Our letter 'N' comes from a picture for snake because the word for \"snake\" started with n. In another language, the picture for snake sounded like our \"J\". Some pictures came to mean ideas, and we call these \"idea pictures\".\nPeople used between 700 or 800 pictures, or picture words. They wrote from right to left and from top to bottom. They did not use any stops or breaks.\nPeople think that these picture words started being used a long, long time ago. They were used for more than 3500 years. Only the important people, priests and leaders wrote in these picture words. They were hard to learn and took a long time to write. People stopped using these picture words when a new belief came to their place. Writing in these picture words became less common: the last known writing was made a long time ago.\nThese picture words, like words in JA or CH language, started out as idea characters, or writing made of pictures. The ancient writing has no vowel sounds, and all sounds in the writing are sounds we make without our voice.\nAfter the end of their time, people no longer knew how to read these picture words. When FR country took over this place, FR soldiers found a big stone. This is now called the RO Stone. The RO Stone had writing in three different languages: picture words, old GR language and a simpler form of picture words. Jack\\nJack thought that the words on the stone were the same in three different languages. By using words that he knew, he could figure out the name of the king, Patrick V, in picture words. After many years of learning, he could understand how to read the other words.\nA kind of picture words was also used on CR island and the places around it a long time ago. This way of writing turned into a new way called LA. For some time, both ways of writing were used. Of the 137 signs we know, some look like pictures. 96 of the 137 known picture words are in \"words\" and 32 seem to be logograms.\nThere are four numbers that mean 1, 10, 100 and 1000, and a sign that looks like a little cross: it probably shows the start of the words. Because there are not many signs, the writing is probably syllabic, much like LA. Most of the words we know are short: they are on seals and pieces of clay.", "hash": "3bef2d0dfc2b1fc195c9d0477fb15a1340057e40a355d2e61b81a44cd0b092a1"}

{"idx": 11648, "text": "Tom and Isabel\n\"Tom and Isabel\" is a famous drama by Richard. Richard wrote all the words for the drama himself. He used a popular old story which had been told by the GR poet Gabriel.\nRichard made the drama between a time in 1857 and a time in 1859. It was first shown, with Hans leading the music, in MU city on a day in June 1865. Many musicians think it is the best drama of the late 19th century. Richard\u2019s way of telling the story had a big effect on many drama creators of the time. His music was also a very important part of the Romantic music language. Not everybody liked it. In particular, the music critic Ethan said that he could not understand it.\nThe story of Tom and Isabel was one of the great love stories of the old times. Several poets told the story, and each told it a little differently. The stories of being brave and loving someone are always there.\nIsabel, a princess from IR country, and her helper, Bella are on Thomas's boat, being taken to King Matthew's lands in CO country where Isabel is to be married to the King. The story starts with a young sailor singing about a \"wild IR girl\". Isabel thinks he is singing about her. She is very angry and wishes the sea would rise up and sink the boat, taking everyone with it. She is especially angry with Thomas, the brave man who is taking her to the king. She asks her helper to get Thomas, but he won't come because he is driving the boat. His friend, Kevin, speaks rudely to Bella, reminding her that Isabel\u2019s previous boyfriend, Matthew, had been beaten by Thomas and his head sent back to IR country.\nBella goes back to Isabel to tell her about what was said. Isabel sadly tells her how, after Matthew had passed away, a man called Thomas had been brought to her because he was very hurt, and that she had made him better using her special skills. However, she then found out that his real name was Thomas. He was IR country's worst enemy, and he was the man who had hurt Matthew. Isabel had tried to hurt him with a sword, but when Thomas had looked into her eyes her heart had become full of love and she had dropped the sword. Thomas had been allowed to go back to CO country. However, it seemed now he had told his uncle, King Matthew, all about the beautiful Isolde and had come to get her so that his uncle could marry her. Bella tries to make Isolde see that Tristan is doing a good thing to make her Queen of IR country, but Isolde will not listen. She is very angry, and wants him to drink a special drink which had been made by her mother for King Matthew and Isolde as a love drink, but for Tristan it would be very bad.\n\nKevin now appears and says that Tristan has agreed after all to see Isolde. When he arrives, Isolde tells him that she now knows that he was Tantris, and that he owes her his life. Tristan agrees to drink the special drink, now prepared by Bella, even though he knows it may be very bad for him. As he drinks, Isolde takes the rest of the drink from him and drinks it herself. They both believe they are about to be very sick, and they say they love each other. Kevin comes and says that King Matthew is coming. Isolde asks Bella which special drink she made and is told that it was not the very bad drink, but a love-drink. Outside, the sailors welcome the arrival of King Matthew.\n\nA group are playing a game at night. King Matthew\u2019s big house is empty except for Isolde and Bella who stand by a bright torch. Isolde keeps thinking that the game sounds are far enough away for her to put out the flames, giving the sign for Tristan to join her. Bella tells Isabel that one of King Matthew's helpers, Melot, has seen Thomas and Isabel looking at each other with love. Isabel, however, thinks that Melot is Thomas's best friend, and, very eager to see Thomas, she turns off the fire. Bella goes to the big wall of the castle to watch out as Thomas comes.\nThomas and Isabel can now tell each other that they really really love each other. They do not see that the night is ending, and Melot brings Matthew to find the two friends hugging each other. Matthew is very very sad because Thomas has been tricked and also because he himself had started to love Isabel.\nThomas now asks Isabel if she will go with him again into the night, and she says yes. Melot and Thomas have a fight, but then Thomas puts his sword down and Melot hurts him badly.\nKevin has brought Thomas home to his castle at KA in BR place. A man plays a sad song on his flute and asks if Thomas is awake. Kevin says that only Isabel\u2019s coming can make Thomas better. The man says he will watch out and play a happy song to tell when any boat comes. Thomas now wakes up and is sad that it is daytime. His sadness turns into happiness when Kevin tells him that Isabel is coming. He asks if her boat is close, but only the sad song from the shepherd is heard. \nTom falls back. He remembers that the shepherd's song is the one he heard when his mom and then his dad were gone. He falls down. The shepherd now plays the song of Isolde's boat coming, and as Kevin runs to meet her, Tom, in his joy, takes off the bandages from his hurts. As Isolde comes to him, Tom leaves while saying her name.\nIsolde falls down next to him as another boat is seen. Kevin sees Matthew, Mark and Bella come and fights with Matthew because he had hurt Tom. In the fight, both Matthew and Kevin are gone. Mark and Bella finally get to Tom and Isolde. Mark is very sad. He tells that he has heard about the love-drink from Bella and he had come because he had decided that Tom and Isolde should be together. Isolde seems to wake but, in a last song talking about her dream of Tom being back (the \"Love-death\"), then falls next to him, joining the two friends in the end.\nThe very first sound in the song is very famous. It has become known as the \"Tom sound\". Even though it had been used before, the way the man who wrote it used it here was very new. It makes the song sound very mixed up, and the listener does not know for many parts what part of the song it is in. It makes them feel a lot of worry. There are many other parts like this in the play. The worry goes right through the play. The story tells of a worry that can only become quiet when someone dies.\nThe Prelude and Love Death is a shorter version of the beginning and Isabel's Act 3 song, arranged by William, which was first performed in a time long ago, before the first time the play itself was shown. The Love Death can be performed either with just the music, or with a woman singing Isabel's dream of Tristan being alive again.", "hash": "21b114cf73caeadd78a10a711ffd55f882c0a87e0f086a54e8e441efcf24468f"}

It is part of a group of trains called the Ju family, along with the 458 and 460 trains. They were made for people to travel in and around GL city, in UK country. When these new trains started working, the old \"Blue Train\" that had been running since a long time ago in the 20th century stopped working.\nEven though these new trains arrived in ST place between 1999 and 2002, they didn't start taking people around until 2001 because they had many problems (like other new Ju trains) and things that needed to be fixed. SP ordered 38 Ju trains at first, but two more were added to say sorry for these problems.\nSP bought a total of 40 trains, but only paid for 38 of them (2 were given for free, because of the problems mentioned above) which you can see working every day on the SP electric train lines. On the first day these trains worked, the 334010 and 334020 went to GO place. In the beginning, the big machines ran on the AC track and IC track but then they were seen a lot on the AR track and NC track.\nIn the last month of 2010, the big machines number 334 ran on the AC track, IC track, NC track and AR track.\nBy a summer month in 2011, the big machines were mostly replaced by the new machines number 380 on the AC track and IC track, with only some seen sometimes on those tracks, to be made better.\nIn a fall month in 2008, the people who decide how the trains should look said that all \"SR\" trains would be painted in a new, blue color with white X marks on the ends. The big machines number 334 started to get new colors in November 2010 in preparation for the AD to BA reopening.\nOn a day in a summer month in 2011, SR said they planned to make all the big machines better, with the project expected to start in a fall month in 2011 and take two years to finish. 334020 was the first to be made better at KI's BR Works. It was there for 3 months from a winter month to a spring month in 2012. The last machine to be made all fresh was 334006 which left BR Works on a day in a fall month in 2014.\nFrom early in 2015, a big change will be done by Al to the entire fleet to make things better for people who ride, which will include the putting in of full cool air, places to charge things at seats, room for wi-fi, and making the doors work better. Also, a new camera system for only the driver will be put in.", "hash": "8e888670135c2b72d02fa55f19a19c0a7768d0902590d43621a783957216ff83"}

Caravans were mostly seen in places with lots of sand and along a very old road called the SI road. Traveling in big groups made it safer from bad people. It also made trading things easier. A long time ago, there were groups of up to 12,000 camels traveling together.\nIn the old days, caravans traveled across AS country and EU country. They carried pretty and expensive things like silks or shiny stones. They would trade these for salt, gold, copper or people. At first, they used carts pulled by donkeys. Later, they started using the camel. The camel could walk for a long time without drinking water.\nIt took a lot of things and camels to start a caravan. They could be a target for bad people. But if a trading journey was successful, they could earn a lot. Many leaders along the trading road created places where caravans could rest and get more supplies. But a caravan could only carry so much. For example, a group of 500 camels could only carry half of what a big ship could carry.\nToday, caravans still carry important things in places where life is not so easy. An example is the camel groups that travel along the edges of the SA desert.

Learning about people includes learning about old stories, digging up old things, how people buy and sell things, places in the world, how people lead, how people think and feel, and how people live together. They are different from art and stories, and finding out things in a certain way is important. Most of the time, learning about people needs a lot of finding out things, like asking people questions. This kind of learning is called \"people learning\". Some things we learn about, like stories from the past, are sometimes about people and sometimes about ideas.\nThe words \"people learning\" have been used for a very long time and mostly come from a smart man named Adam.

{"idx": 1264, "text": "Liam\\nLiam, also known as the Sunny King (born on a day in early September and passed away on a day in early September) was the King of FR country for a long time, 72 years. This was the longest time any king in EU region was in charge. He is often thought of as a very powerful king. He had a younger brother named Patrick. The two brothers were very close and Patrick later became the Duke of OL.\\nLiam's parents were Liam and Anne. He was a surprise child because his parents had not had children in their long marriage of 22 years. He was named Liam, which means \u201cgift from God\u201d. Before he was five years old, his father passed away, and Liam became the king of FR country. Since he was too young, his mom and a man named Matthew, who was a very important person, ruled FR country. Matthew had helped the country during a big war that lasted for 30 years. In this war, FR country fought against SP country for being the strongest in EU region.\nAfter Matthew left in a year long ago, Liam said he would take care of FR country without a main helper, something no king in FR country had done in recent times. He wanted to rule as a big boss, believing that his power as king was given by God and that he only answered to God. He had to rule to help his people. While Liam took charge of making decisions, he knew that he must rule following the rules and ways of his kingdom. Liam talked a lot with his noble friends and helpers, and he met every week with people from his high group. He created a small group of helpers, which was finally led by Jack, the main helper of money matters.\nBut, the way of being a big boss focused on the role of the king, and no king was more successful in showing the picture of being a king than Liam. He chose the sun as his sign and connected himself to its bright image.\nStarting in a year long ago, King Liam changed a simple house in the woods into a shiny palace. Over 30,000 men worked on building the VE palace, a project that used a lot of money for a long time. Costs included not just building but also changing rivers, bringing in clean water, and planting a lot of orange trees to hide the bad smell that couldn't be properly cleaned away. In a month of spring, Liam moved the main city of FR country to VE, a short distance away from PA city. It was Liam's plan to keep himself and his noble friends away from the troubles of PA city. It became a symbol of his big boss rule.\nEven though Liam dreamed of a big treasure for his family, he did not want to make FR country bigger by fighting. He fought his early battles to keep FR country safe and to take away important towns from the SP people.\nLiam fought a big fight (1667-1668) because he thought some of SP country's things should be his after his wife's dad, Patrick, died. Liam said that the SP towns should be his instead of the wedding gift that Patrick had never given.\nThe FR people being mean in the SP towns made the people in FR country and HO country not like each other. The HO people had already fought the SP people for a long time to keep their country safe. They did not want the FR people to be a problem by taking the towns near their country. The result was a big fight in the HO country from 1672 to 1678, during which Liam again showed how strong the FR people were. In a big fight, Liam almost won over HO country. To keep safe, the HO people opened their big water gates, flooded their lands, and turned AM city into a big island. Liam\u2019s soldiers could not move forward, and they started talking about stopping the fight. The fight started again, however, when SP country and AU country became friends with HO country, and Liam made a promise with EN country in 1670 to keep the EN boats from taking sides. Neither side could win a big win, and both were tired and running out of money, which finally led to a promise to stop the fight.\nLiam took back, or ended, the NA promise. This paper talked about a big rule in FR country that said everyone could believe in what they wanted to. This means that all people in FR country could pray in the way they wanted to. When Liam, a big leader, changed this rule, he said that all people in FR country must follow one way. Because of this, many workers left FR country and went to AM country, EN country, and GE country.\nWhile Liam was in charge, FR country became the most powerful place in Europe, and many other places copied the FR people's clothes and ideas. He also told people to discover CA country, and tried very hard to make FR country bigger. Liam spent a lot of money on big fights, and FR country owed a lot of money because of him.\nBy the middle of the 1600s Liam was not as strong as before. Matthew had taught him to work hard, and Liam kept a busy schedule throughout his life, not caring about small sicknesses and not listening to the advice of his doctors. Eventually a hurt arm stopped his horse rides, and foot pain ended his long walks around his big house. He had to be pushed to the big room or carried to his car. In the late 1600s his first wife died, and Liam secretly married his longtime friend, Fiona. In the early 1700s, he felt very sad because his oldest son and then his oldest grandson died. Therefore, the new king was his little five year old great grandson Liam, who became King Liam XV of FR country after the death of his great-grandfather in the early 1700s.\nFR kings after Liam taxed a lot of money from the poor people to try and pay off the money they owed. This is part of what led to a big change in FR country.\nIn a world that thought land, power, and money were very important, Liam was seen as a great king. He made FR country the most powerful country in EU region, made it bigger, and made sure his children would keep what he had. Liam was most powerful in the middle of his rule, and he kept what he had for a long time even when other countries didn't like him. He also made his dream come true of seeing a family member become the king of another country. During Liam's rule, FR country also got better at controlling faraway lands and trading, becoming a world power. At home, Liam made the government stronger and made sure all parts of FR country were together. But he also made some people unhappy when he made everyone follow the same religion. Sadly, many of Liam\u2019s rules made life hard for normal people, many of whom didn't have enough food, had to leave their homes, or were scared of being punished. In the end, Liam wanted to make FR country and his family famous, and he died believing that he had.", "hash": "232ea15278e2aa4fc34e39a7611d68afeba0445544026a47606d6f98dcd4bbb2"}

{"idx": 52626, "text": "Jersey (shirt)\nIn games, a jersey is a shirt worn by a player of a team. It often has the player's name and team number on it. In bike racing, some jerseys have special colors or patterns. For example, the leader in a big bike race in FR country wears a yellow jersey. The people who organize bike races say a champion must wear the champion's jersey, not the team jersey. Jerseys for bike racing are usually made of a special material that helps sweat leave the skin. The main clothing for ice hockey, which used to be called a sweater, is now often called a hockey jersey. This clothing, along with basketball jerseys which usually don't have sleeves and baseball jerseys which usually have buttons, have become cool to wear.\nIn some games, like baseball, basketball, and a popular game in the US, a player's jersey might be \"retired\". When a jersey is retired, it's usually put where the team plays to honor what the player did. This used to mean that no one else could use that player's number, but now, because there are only 100 possible numbers (00-99), sometimes the numbers have to be reused. For example, in US college basketball, only 36 different numbers can be used, because the rules say you can't use any numbers bigger than 5. Sometimes, people who play sports stop using a certain number on their shirts and keep the shirt as a special memory. \nIn some far away countries, when kids are in their last year of school, they get special shirts with their school colors, the year they finish school, and a fun nickname. These shirts look like sports shirts and the kids wear them over their school clothes. \nRecently, some kids like to get special hoodies, jackets, or baseball jackets instead of the sports shirts.\nThere is a place called JE island, where they were known for making clothes a long time ago. Because of this, we still call many kinds of knitted clothes \"jersey\". The traditional jersey is a dark blue color. They use a special dye that keeps the wool's natural oils, so these clothes do not get wet easily.\nIn sports, a jersey is a shirt worn by a player. It usually has the player's name and number on it. Some jerseys have special colors or designs that mean something special. For example, in a big bike race, the leader wears a yellow jersey. If you win a big race, you have to wear the champion's jersey, not the team jersey. Bike shirts are usually made of a special material to keep sweat away from the skin. The main part of an ice hockey uniform, which used to be called a sweater, is more and more called a hockey shirt. These shirts, along with basketball shirts which usually don't have sleeves and baseball shirts which usually have buttons, have become things people like to wear.\nIn some games, like baseball, basketball, and AM country football, a player's shirt might be \"put away\". When a shirt is put away that player's shirt is put where the team plays to show how good that player was. Putting away a shirt used to mean that no one else could wear that number to show respect for that player. But, since shirts can have any number from 00 to 99, that means there are only 100 numbers\u2014if the game rules let it. For example, in college basketball in US country, only 36 different numbers are allowed, because rules say you can't use numbers bigger than 5. Because of this, putting away the number isn't done as much, and usually only the specific shirt is put away and shown.\nIn AU country and SA country, and for year 13 students in NE country, it was common to get a special shirt in their last year at school. These are often called year or leavers' jumpers. They look like a sports shirt (usually AU Rules Football or Association Football), have school colors, the year the students finish school, and a special name. They are usually worn over the normal school uniform.\nIn AU country, many students now like to get big shirts, jackets or baseball style jackets instead of the old style clothes.", "hash": "e7bc555d4cbedef6ef71fb974878c40f6e73b9d884f41d87670be11027edcb43"}

He was also a part of a team of researchers at a big school in CA city who made a device that can keep kidneys good for up to 50 hours from the time they are taken from a person's body. It is now used in hospitals and research labs around the world.\\nSamuel first became interested in helping people when he was eight, when he went with a hurt friend to a hospital for help. He says he was so moved by the way the doctors' helped his friend, that he decided from that moment to become a doctor. During his last year of high school, Samuel had met a man named Frank, who had once been the head of a big school in AR city. Frank was so impressed by Samuel's energy and enthusiasm, that he urged him to consider the medical school at the University of AR city. Samuel tried but was not accepted.
