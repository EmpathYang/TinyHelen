The people in the big house said yes. For the original War Hawks, only strength could make up for the bad things the BR country did to our country. The BR country did lots of bad things from taking our ships and making their sailors work for them to helping bad guys in the west. Our trying to be nice didn't work and talking didn't seem to be going anywhere.\n\nWith war coming, it was up to the money man Albert to pay for it. Albert hoped to get the money for the war by borrowing it, but he wanted to raise taxes enough to pay for the new debt. Without higher taxes, he was worried that people wouldn't lend money to a new country fighting with a big country. The War Hawks did not like taxes, especially the ones that Gabriel wanted to impose. They thought that more taxes could take away people's and states' rights. They also worried that more taxes could make them less popular. They did increase some taxes before the war, but did not approve the ones that Gabriel wanted. Instead, they allowed the money department to borrow money. But not many people wanted to lend the needed amount, even before the war started, forcing the government to make paper money. On a day in the middle of the year, the US started a war against GB country. Less than a month later, the group of leaders finished their meeting.\n\nBecause the group of leaders did not want to raise taxes, the money department had trouble paying for soldiers and ships. In a year, the government was close to running out of money, and Gabriel had to rely on a banker from PH city to lend a big amount of money. The US soldiers could win some fights, but they lost many times at the border with CA country, even though GB country was busy with a much bigger war in EU continent. The group of leaders finally agreed to impose taxes in a year, but it was too late to build a top military. After many years of tight budgets, the US navy started the war with only seventeen ships. The GB navy had over one thousand ships; they could block the Eastern shoreline and attack the coast almost anytime they wanted. A big waterway that leads to two big cities was defended by a group of boats that were no match for the GB navy and soon got trapped in a river. The way to the capital city along a river was guarded by a fort. But when the architect who designed the city checked the fort, he found it was not good enough and recommended more changes and a second fort nearby. The navy boss added some more guns, but there was no money for more improvements.\n\nIn a month, GB forces sailed into an inlet of the big waterway that points toward the capital city. They cornered the AM country boats, forcing the Americans to sink their ships, and landed ground forces in a place less than forty miles from the US capital. The soldiers walked from the landing place, defeated an AM country group at a fight, and finally reached the capital city, where they met little resistance. On a late summer night, they set fire to big buildings and a white house\u2014after eating the dinner that was ready. Another group went up the big river and attacked a fort, whose protectors quickly left. From there, they continued up the river to take over a city, which was more important than the white house at the time, taking twenty-one big boats and their stuff.\n\nFor the people, the burning of the white house was a sad time, a moment of shame that is still remembered. Despite this, it was not a big change in the fight; both sides decided to make peace later that year after deciding the fight was not worth it anymore. But the danger to the capital showed the risk of fighting against a very powerful enemy without being ready. As a boss named Gabriel watched the destruction of the city, someone said to him, \"If George had been alive, you would not have gotten into this city so easily.\" \"No,\" Gabriel replied. \"If George had been the leader we would never have thought of coming here.\" But George, who had to fight a big war with a poorly equipped, unpaid army, knew that any army was only as strong as the money that supported it. What the enemies had, more than anything else, was money\u2014money to outfit and equip hundreds of ships and to fight land wars in Europe and in AM city. By contrast, without a steady source of money from taxes, the country struggled to find lenders willing to bet on the country's untested army. Right up until the end of the war, military operations were slowed by failures to pay soldiers and people who provided things.\n\nThis big money problem was the result of one of the most angry, dividing political fights in history. Beginning in the late 18th century, a man named Adam pushed through a series of money policies that included changing the national debt, a national bank, and taxes. Opposition to Adam's policies led Thomas and James to start a party, which faced off against Adam's party. The small-government, antitax party won the elections, with Thomas defeating Jack, and proceeded to reverse some of Adam's policies, removing the taxes in the early 19th century. To pay for these tax cuts, the party cut defense spending, which was one reason for the army's unpreparedness. The removal of internal taxes also made government money dependent on tariffs, which were removed first by a ban against a country and then by war. It was this fight over taxes and spending that led to the country's money weakness.\n\nIronically, the party, who voted for war but not for the taxes to pay for it, were the political winners of the War. A long time ago, some people didn't like a war. They didn't want to use money for the war. This made them look like they didn't love their country, and they never became leaders again. But the war also showed that what Hamilton said many years ago was right. Both groups always believed that the country should pay what it owes. But there is a bigger meaning of being careful with money: knowing that if you want something, you have to pay for it, either now or later. If a country can't show that it can be careful with money\u2014by showing that it can ask for and get taxes when needed\u2014it will have trouble getting money when there's a problem. This was missing in the Congress of 1812. As Jack said funnily to his friends who wanted war, \"Go to war without money, without soldiers, without ships!\" By 1813 and 1814, however, it was the other group in Congress that voted to bring back and then raise the taxes first asked by the group they didn't like. Some things, everyone agreed, were worth paying for.\n\nFast forward to many years later. Once again, the big city is arguing about taxes, spending, and debt. This time, it's not mainly about war, although soldiers are still far away in the east. Our country is the most powerful, with the biggest army and the biggest money, and it's not in danger. It also doesn't have trouble getting money. Our money is the most important money in the world, and our bonds are seen as very safe. Even though we owe more than a very big number, the interest we pay is only a small part of the money the government gets from taxes. People all over the world, who want to keep their money safe from problems in other places, are eager to lend money to our country: the interest rates on our bonds are at their lowest in many years.\n\nBut still, on a day in 2011, arguing almost made our country not able to pay what it owes. Because of the debt ceiling\u2014a rule on how much the country can owe\u2014the money department couldn't borrow new money and would soon not have enough money to pay everything. One group in Congress said that any increase in the debt ceiling must be matched by the same amount of spending cuts; the other group, led by the president, said either that the debt ceiling be increased without conditions or that any deal to reduce the debt also include more taxes. (Both sides didn't want to talk about the fact that they had just a short time ago agreed on a big tax cut that made the national debt bigger by almost $860 billion.) Some important people were saying that not paying the country's debts might be a good idea. Many people agreed with them and did not want to increase the debt limit. The two groups stood their ground until a decision was made on the 2nd of August. The decision was to cut spending by a big amount over the next ten years and to try and reduce the debt by an even bigger amount over the same period. A group of people from both sides tried to come up with a plan, but they couldn't agree on anything.\n\nThe fight about taxes and spending was because the government had spent a lot of money and had a big debt, the biggest it had ever had. This was not because of war, although the wars in AF country and IR country did add to the debt. The main cause was a big money crisis that happened which led to less money coming in and more money being spent. Another big cause was that there were some big tax cuts that did not have any reductions in spending to balance them out. But the biggest debate is about future spending.\n\nIn the 19th century, some people did not want to go to war because they did not want to spend more money or have higher taxes. The person in charge of the money wanted higher taxes to pay for the war, but most people wanted war without the higher taxes. Today, the big debate is about increasing government spending on programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. One idea is to cut back on these programs to avoid higher taxes. Another idea is to keep spending the same but raise taxes to pay for it. A middle ground might be to reduce some spending and increase some taxes. But our divided political system is on a course set long ago: more spending without more taxes. This inability to make a wise choice is how a broken political system could cause a big money crisis in one of the richest, most powerful countries in the world.\n\nIn a war in the 19th century, the government quickly realized that fighting a war without the money to pay for it was a dangerous idea, leading to the tax increases. This time, there may not be such a wake-up call. The main reasons for increasing government spending\u2014an older population and rising health care costs\u2014are slow but certain, eating away at the government's money over years. This gives politicians plenty of time to complain about debts while not doing anything about them, sure that the real crisis will not happen while they are in charge. For many years, people have been worried about the country's money problems. A long time ago, a president named Ronald promised to spend more on safety, lower taxes, and reduce the money problems. But, under his leadership, the country had the biggest money problems in peace times. This was mostly because of a big tax cut in 1981. Yet, he didn't have any issues because of it. Another president, George, tried to use the long-term money problems of a popular program for older people to get support for changing it. He warned, \"The safety for older people in the future is in a cabinet\"; he said, \"There is no fund. Just promises that I saw firsthand.\" But his idea to change the program would have added a lot of money to the country's debt.\n\nOver the past many years, talking about the country's debt has been used by leaders to argue for different things, which often increase the debt. But we should not only blame the leaders. After all, ordinary people elect them. And ordinary people, as shown by surveys, are also confused. In 2011, a lot of people were worried about \"spending and the money problems\". In one survey, almost everyone supported reducing the money problems by cutting spending. But, at the same time, many people were against cutting spending on healthcare and safety.\n\nIt is not surprising that people can be illogical. After all, it's not fair to expect most people to know what proportion of spending goes to popular programs or how much of the money problems are due to their favorite tax breaks. But the problem goes deeper: many people have no idea what the government does. According to a 2008 survey, many people who receive benefits say that they \"have not used a government program.\" The same goes for many people who have collected benefits when they don't have a job. Of the people who denied using any government programs, almost all had benefited from at least one. In 2009, when a person at a meeting told a leader to \"keep your government hands off my program for older people,\" many people laughed. But, we all are part of a big joke. Some people don't know that they are helped by big help programs from the leaders. These people think that the leader's group is too big, they should give less money, use less money, but they don't want their favorite help programs to be touched.\n\nLeaders act in the same way. So, during a big talk about health care in the past, some leaders said they wanted to protect the money for a health program, going against the cuts suggested by the leaders in charge (remember, people _like_ the health program). On a day in the cold season, a big leader named Mitch sent out a message saying \"People don't want the health program to be cut.\" But the next day, when there was a suggestion to let people of a certain age buy into the health program, Mitch talked about money problems with another message, \"Making the health program bigger 'A Plan for money problems.'\" These two ideas can make sense together, but the simple thing is: say no to any plan to make popular help programs bigger because they can't keep going and at the same time, attack any plan to keep them going by calling it a cut in benefits (or asking for more money). In another year, when House leaders proposed to change the health program from a health insurance plan into a program to help people buy health insurance from private groups, others attacked them for cutting the health program. As a smart man named Brad said, \"the lesson of the past two years is now that you win choices by saying the other group's plans to control health program spending in the long time ... sitting back, and waiting for the people to reward you.\" This is not a happy picture.\n\nBut as a group of people, we will make a choice, one way or another. The money problem\u2014the difference between using and getting money in a single year\u2014will go down in the next few years as things get better, but will then start to go up again. Each year that the leaders have a money problem, they must borrow money (by selling promises) to make up the difference, and that borrowing adds to the big money problem. In simple words, the money problem is a _flow,_ like the water coming from a tap into a tub, that is measured over a period of time (usually a year); the big money problem is a _stock,_ like the water in the tub, that is measured at a special moment (usually at the end of the year). Money problems go up and down, mostly because of changes in how things are going, but in the long run it is the big money problem that matters; the bigger the problem, the more money must be spent on paying back each year. And since the whole group of people makes the things that can pay off the problem, what really matters is the problem as a part of the whole group of people, usually measured in terms of all the stuff made in the country in a given year.\n\nPicture I-1: Big money problem as a part of all the stuff made, from a long time ago until now\n\nIn the late 20th century, our country owed a lot of money. This was the most money we ever owed except during a big war. This money does not include what we need to pay for big programs like helping old people and giving care to the sick in the future. While we will probably owe a little less money for a few years, we will start to owe more around 2020 because we will spend more money than we get from people paying taxes. We will need to spend more money on helping old people because there will be more old people and they will live longer. We will also need to spend more money on taking care of the sick because it costs more to do this than before. As we owe more money, we will need to pay more money every year. This will take a lot of the money we get from taxes and make it harder to spend money on other important things like keeping our country safe and helping poor people. If we owe more money than we make for a long time, people might not want to lend us money anymore, like what almost happened a long time ago.\n\nThe biggest problem we have right now is that a lot of people do not have jobs. This is a problem that started with a big problem with money a few years ago and it is making our country not work as well as it could. But the money we owe, and the money we spend and get from taxes will be a big problem for a long time. We will need to figure out how to change our country and how we live to deal with more old people and more expensive care for the sick. We could live in a world where we pay less taxes and the government does less, and people have to do more on their own. Or we could live in a world where we pay more taxes and the government does more to protect people from not having jobs, getting sick, getting old, and not having enough money. What we decide to do will make a big difference for a long time.\n\nThe big money problems we have now started with a big problem with money a few years ago. Our last book, a famous book, told the story of how the people who deal with money made a big mistake that almost caused a big problem for the whole world. This big problem made a lot of people think that the way we deal with money was broken. But trying to fix this problem did not work because the people who deal with money did not want to change.\n\nThe big money problem made it harder to make a budget for our country. The way we deal with taxes, spending, and owing money has become a big problem. This is because it makes us think about what the government should do. Some people who don't like the government doing a lot of things now say that we need to cut spending because we don't have enough money. Other people say that because things went so wrong when the government didn't control money stuff, because some people have a lot more than others, and because things are not going so well, the government needs to do more. Also, any idea that would actually save money will make some group upset because they will have to pay for it. When you listen to what people are saying in WA city and on TV, it seems like everyone is ready to fight to keep what they want, like low taxes, big help programs, or special tax breaks.\n\nThis book is our way to help explain how our country got here and why these fights matter. The first three parts tell the story of how much money our country owes and the things about money and people that have changed it over time. The next two parts talk about why we don't have enough money now, what it might be like later, and why regular people should care. In the last two parts, we give our ideas about how to make the money our country owes less but keep the most important things the government does for everyone.\n\nWe don't think everyone or even most people will agree with our ideas. But if people in our country understand how we got so much debt, why it matters, and what we have to give up to have less debt, we can choose what kind of future we want for our government and us. Until then, our leaders will keep going from one vote to another saying things that don't mean anything and are full of noise but don't really say anything. You already know this because you can see it everywhere.\n\n* * *\n\na The big house was not officially called the White House until the early 20th century. Even though a big fire in 1814 really hurt the inside of the building, the outside was okay, and so the White House we have now is the same building that was burned by some people from BR country. The White House, \"White House Story,\" you can find it at a website.\n\nb The Big-People Party broke up in the 1820s; one group became the new Big-People Party. The Other-People Party ended in the 1820s. The new Other-People Party started in the 1850s.\n\nc A promise is saying you will give a certain amount of money at a future time, so making a promise is a way to borrow money. For example, the Money Place might make a ten-year promise for $1,000 that pays 5 percent interest: that means the person who has the promise gets $50 per year and then $1,000 after ten years. If the Money Place sells that promise to someone for $1,000, then the Money Place is borrowing $1,000 from that person and that person is lending $1,000 to the Money Place, with a 5 percent extra.\n\nThe term \"big debt\" usually means the money owed by a big group of leaders and not held by the same group of leaders. It doesn't include the money that parts of the big group of leaders owe to each other, or the money owed by smaller groups of leaders.\n\nWhen Adam was the first leader of the US, the country had a lot of money problems. Only a few years after a big war ended, the new country was in a lot of debt and couldn't pay it back. The US had missed paying money to the FR country for several years, as well as money that was due in the past years. The country's ability to borrow money was so bad that some people could buy claims on the central group of leaders for less than 15 cents for every dollar. When Benjamin, the first money leader, added up all the debts, the big group of leaders owed $54 million, almost $12 million to people in other countries. He also thought that smaller groups had debts that added up to $25 million. To understand this, from one time to another, the main group of leaders could only bring in $4.6 million and half of that was borrowed money.\n\nThese debts were the cost of fighting a big war - the \"cost of freedom,\" in Benjamin's words. In an old year, the North AM country places said they were independent from Great Britain, then one of the strongest countries in the world. For the next five years, lacking both the power to collect money and the good ability to borrow money, the main group of leaders struggled to keep a group of 10,000 men ready to fight. The BR country, on the other hand, usually had 15,000 to 25,000 experienced soldiers ready for battle and had more soldiers in most fights. The BR country could have so many soldiers because they had the money to get them ready or to hire them from other European places.\n\nGeneral Adam, on the other hand, struggled to keep the BR country away because there was little money available to get ready, equip, and pay the main group of soldiers. The main group of leaders didn't have both the power and the system to collect money; without the sure chance of future income (or even survival), the new group of leaders had trouble borrowing money. Most payments from the central group of leaders were made with \"papers\" - paper money given by the group of leaders. Frank was initially impressed by this way of getting money: \"The whole thing is a mystery even to the leaders, how we have been able to continue a war four years without money, and how we could pay with paper that had no previously set fund specifically to pay it back.\" But as the group of leaders gave out more and more paper money with nothing to back it, the value of the currency fell, leading Adam to complain that \"a wagon load of money will scarcely buy a wagon load of food.\" Because there was not enough money, AM country soldiers had to live with little food, bad shoes, and very simple homes during cold winters. In one winter, many men died in a place called VA. They were also upset about not getting paid regularly. This made some of them so angry that they made trouble in 1783, which made the leaders have to move from one city to another.\n\nBut the new country was lucky. FR country, who did not like Britain, was willing to lend money to the leaders even though it was risky. The US was also able to borrow money from SP and NE countries. Plus, the FR country gave soldiers and ships that helped a lot, especially in a big fight in 1781, which helped convince the BR country that the war was not worth fighting anymore. But it was clear that the UN city could not really be free unless other countries believed that the new country could protect itself, which needed money. And to get the money to fight a war, nothing was more important than being trustworthy. This was something that Washington and Hamilton learned from the BR country, who were very good at it.\n\n## WAR, DEBT, AND TAXES\n\nDuring this time, Great Britain and FR country were trying to be the most powerful in Europe. At first, everything seemed to be in favor of FR city. It had twice as many people as Great Britain, which stayed the same for most of the century. Its army was much bigger; even its ships were more in the late 17th century, although the BR country ships would be more in the 18th century. Its lands in other places were the same as Great Britain's. Yet, Great Britain was just as strong as FR city: they fought to a standstill on the Continent, while Great Britain took most of FR city's lands in a big war.\n\nThe reason was not because Britain had more money. In 1700, FR city's economy was the largest in Europe, nearly twice as big as Great Britain's. The reason was the BR country government's ability to get money through taxes and borrowing. They were better at collecting taxes because they had a more organized system. In FR city, taxes were collected by people who paid to collect them and others who bought their positions. Many of these people took a part of the tax money before giving the rest to the government. Still, no country could afford to fight the wars of the 18th century only with tax money, so the important thing was a government's ability to borrow money. The UK had two big advantages. The first was that they were really good at collecting taxes, which made people feel safe to lend them money during wars because they knew they could get their money back from taxes after the war. The second, and more important, was that all government debts had to be approved by the Big House, which also had the power to collect taxes.\n\nThe control of the Big House over spending and taxes happened a long time ago, when a king was replaced by another king and queen. This change made the two big groups in the Big House (one group liked business and money, and the other group were the old landowners) compete more. The new king needed the support of the business group to fight against the king of FR country; the old landowners, on the other hand, wanted to stay out of the fight and rely on their navy to protect the UK. The need for more taxes and borrowing to fight wars increased the power of the Big House, making money and economic policy more dependent on the people's support. The fact that the Big House watched over everything and that people thought the tax system was fair were also big reasons why the people were willing to pay more taxes than ever before.\n\nIn the thirty years after the king was replaced, the UK government borrowed a lot of money to fight FR country, and their national debt grew a lot. That borrowing was supported by taxes that got three times bigger between the old times and 1715. It was only when the business group took over the Big House in 1715 that the UK's good credit was assured; a big majority of the business group\u2014who were the nation's lenders, among other groups\u2014gave people confidence that the government would continue to pay its debts by increasing taxes if necessary, allowing it to borrow money at low interest rates. By the time the business group lost control of the Big House in 1760, the idea that paying the national debt was very important had become less controversial. And this was the secret to winning wars in the old times. As a famous writer wrote, \"Credit makes war, and makes peace; raises armies, fits out navies, fights battles, besieges towns; and, in a word, it is more justly called the sinews of war than the money itself.\"\n\nFR country, on the other hand, was always having money problems. Their Big House had not met since 1614, debts were made by the king, and taxes were based on the king's old rights and privileges or imposed without asking by the king. The way they collected taxes was not good and it was hard to get money reliably. The sale of offices\u2014jobs, sometimes with social status\u2014was a big source of money, but it also meant that the government had to pay \"interest\" in the form of salaries to the people who bought the offices. Getting enough money from taxes was hard, and this meant that wars sometimes made the government owe more money. The government often couldn't pay back the money, like in some years long ago. Without the promise of getting more money in the future, the government's debt can quickly become worthless paper. And unlike in GB country, people who lent money had little power and no reason to trust the government to pay back its debts. Because of this, FR country had to pay higher interest rates than GB country and even more than private people in FR country.\n\nThe difference between the two countries became clear after a big war. At first, GB country looked like it was in worse shape because it lost. GB country had borrowed all the money for the war, and it owed more money than FR country (and had fewer people); in a year long ago, 70 percent of all GB country's government money went to interest on the debt. But GB country benefited from lower interest rates, thanks to its good credit, and was able to get more taxes in the years after, getting its debt under control. While FR country's debt was smaller than GB country's, it couldn't get more taxes because people didn't trust the king, and so it had to borrow even more money after the war ended. By a year long ago, paying interest took up 68 percent of all government spending and was growing each year. Finally, King Liam had to call a big meeting, which led quickly to a big change in FR country and the end of the king. At that time, the taxes in GB country were nearly twice as high as in FR country, which made a historian named Katherine say, \"More than any other thing, the inability to tax brought down FR country's treasury and with it the king.\"\n\nEven then, some things did not change. The big change and the rise of a man named Nathan led to another twenty years of war, and GB country continued to have a big money advantage, getting more in taxes than FR country, which helped fund the group that would eventually defeat Nathan. By this time, a big change in how things were made was happening in GB country, and GB country would be the most powerful country for the next hundred years.\n\nWhat was the main difference between GB country and FR country? It wasn't the size of their national debts: at the time of the big change in FR country, GB country's debt per person was much larger than FR country's. The difference was politics. In GB country, the political system was controlled by people who were chosen to represent others who supported a government that did a lot and were willing to approve the taxes needed to pay for its debts. In FR country, the government did not have the trust needed to get the money to pay its smaller debts. Even though it had lower taxes than BR country, not being able to have a say in these taxes was a big reason for a big fight.\n\n## STARTING THE BUILDING\n\nAdam's ideas about money were formed during a big war and mostly came from BR country's good example. He knew that having good credit was important for a country's power: \"We can reach our goal by making our finances orderly, by making our credit good, not by winning battles,\" he wrote in the late 18th century. As the money secretary, one of his main goals was to make sure the US could get money when there was an emergency. He believed that even rich countries need loans when they are in danger, especially from foreign wars. For Adam, this meant changing US money policy to be like BR country's.\n\nWhen Adam started his job, however, the US was looking more like FR country, not BR country, at least in money matters. The country had not paid the interest it was supposed to for many years and it seemed like it could not pay its debts. The national government and the states owed about a lot of money, which wouldn't seem like a lot today. But things were very different then, with more farming and less industry and trade, and the federal government didn't have a good way to collect taxes, which made it hard to get a lot of money. At that time, Adam thought that paying all the interest on the foreign and domestic debt would cost more than a lot of money. The US's limited ability to pay the debt made it seem like there could be a big and long-lasting debt crisis.\n\nThis dangerous money situation was one reason for a big meeting in the late 18th century, which created the executive part of the government that William and Adam were now in. Under the old agreement, the central government could spend money but couldn't levy taxes, and had to rely on money from the states, which often said no. In the late 18th century, Jack, who was then president of the big congress, asked the states to give money for the war: \"Remember that this is the price for your freedom, peace, and safety, and for the future,\" he said. But without an independent executive or judicial part, the central government had no power over the states and couldn't force them to give money. As the finance superintendent in the early 18th century, Ryan tried to get money for the central government, even using his own personal credit, but often couldn't get the states to work together. As David wrote in his book about US financial history, \"Ryan didn't have much power; he couldn't overcome the big obstacles in the way of healthy finance; State pride, jealousy, and arguing resisted his calls to the States to levy taxes.\"\n\nNot having a good source of money was one reason for the central government's persistent weakness. Adam and Ryan said,\n\nEven though the new place had a lot of strength, it had problems in 1786. People couldn't borrow money anymore. The place couldn't work without money, so they had a big meeting in 1787 and started a new place in 1789.\n\nThe meeting decided to give the new leaders the power to collect money to pay for things and to borrow money. But, many leaders were scared of a strong central leader with too much power. They didn't want the leader to have too much control over everyday life. To make everyone happy, they had to find a balance. They weren't sure how much power the central leader should have. The leaders could make laws, but people weren't sure what the leader could really do.\n\nThe power of the central leader was a big issue when the first leader, William, was in charge. Thomas and Henry disagreed about it. Thomas said the leader's power should be small, especially when it came to money. Henry said the leader could do more things. Thomas and Jack argued for a strong central leader before, but now they thought Henry liked strong leaders too much. This made Thomas and Jack and Henry not get along.\n\nMoney and borrowing were at the center of this argument. Henry thought a strong leader could help in emergencies, like wars. The leader needed money quickly, which depended on people trusting them. To borrow money, the leader needed to show they could pay back the money. In his report, Henry said,\n\nHe believed that having debt could be a good thing, but he didn't agree that \"debts are good\"\u2014a saying that could lead to wasting money and could be dangerous. He really hoped that the rule for borrowing money in the UN city would be that if you create debt, you should also have a way to pay it back. There's a secret to making sure people trust you when you need to borrow things. To borrow things, you need to show that you can give it back.\n\nOur big country owed a lot of things to a lot of people. This was a chance to show we could give it back. Henry wanted to make sure we could pay back everything we owed, not just to the big people but to the little people too. We didn't have enough things to give back right away\u2014we had already missed giving some things back\u2014so he suggested we promise to give things back later. He had a big plan for this. Henry said we could give back a little bit each year. People who had things we owed could trade them for promises that we would give them things later. This was a good deal for them. If everything worked out, we could give back everything we owed, which means they would get more things. So, people who wanted more things later would trade their things for our promises. Of course, to give things back later, we needed a way to get more things. Henry had a plan for this too. He wanted to ask for a little bit from everyone when they bought drinks, tea, and coffee. He also had an idea to start a big bank. The bank would help us get things quickly when we needed it.\n\nWhile Henry saw owing things as something we had to do or even something good, Oliver and Matthew didn't like it. They thought when you owe things, you need to ask for more things, and that gives you a lot of power and can lead to fights. In a time long ago, Matthew wrote,\n\nAmong all the bad things, fighting is the worst. It can lead to more bad things. Fighting makes us need a big group of soldiers; from that comes owing things and needing more things; and soldiers, and owing things, and needing more things are what make a few people control many people.\n\nOliver and Matthew worried that Henry's plan, by making a way to owe things and ask for more things, would give too much power to the big people and make us always owe things. They didn't like the idea of giving back everything to people who currently had our promises because some people had traded for those promises from the brave people who fought in the war. Matthew had other ideas that wouldn't be as good for the people who currently had our promises. In one idea, the worth of each debt note would depend not just on its face value but also on its own special history. But as Matthew himself later said, \"the idea for settling the matter between original sufferers and the stockjobbers, after being long talked about, was turned down by a big group, less perhaps from a denial of the fairness of the idea, than a belief of its impracticality.\"\n\nIn Congress, Matthew drew the line at the big group taking on state debt. He argued that by basically helping out states that were behind on their debt payments, it was not fair to those\u2014like VI state, his home state\u2014that had already paid off most of their war debts. By the sixth month of the late 18th century, the House of Representatives had approved most of Henry's money plan, except for taking on state debt, thanks to Matthew's efforts. At the same time, there was a long talk about where the nation's capital city should be. Finally, Henry, Jack, and Matthew reached a deal\u2014according to Jack, over a private dinner at his house on the twentieth day of the sixth month. Henry agreed to push for the banks of the big river as the site of the future capital (and to support a good debt settlement for VI state), while Matthew agreed to find enough votes to back the assumption plan, which finally passed on the twenty-sixth day of the seventh month. Matthew and Jack later did not agree with the creation of the Big Bank of the UN city, but Henry won that battle in Congress and then convinced President William not to stop it.\n\nIn the end, Henry's plan was a success in money matters. Because the debt swap was good for creditors, he was able to restructure the outstanding debt at reasonable interest rates. The new taxes helped bring the budget roughly into balance, making the U.S. government a more attractive credit risk. In the late 18th century, the yield on government debt was in the range of 26\u201340 percent; investors could buy interest-bearing claims on the government for 15 percent of their face value, a big discount.b By the early 19th century, the yield on government debt had fallen below 9 percent; while the early data have big gaps, interest rates seem to have remained around 8 percent for the rest of the decade. The newly issued government bonds became an attractive investment in European credit markets, helping attract money to the UN city. Most importantly, the broader credit system worked again, helping to stimulate sustained economic growth.\n\nAlthough Henry's money system was good for the new federal government, there was still a price to be paid\u2014the taxes that he introduced to service the larger government debt. Popular opposition to those taxes, particularly the tax on a popular drink, was fueled by general discontent with the new, more centralized political system brought in by the Constitution. On an economic level, taxing farmers who produced grain and distilled it into a popular drink (or the people who drank the drink), in order to pay off old debts at their full face value, seemed like a transfer of wealth from ordinary Americans to the East Coast elites and speculators who held government debt. Farmers in the far west liked to make whiskey because it was easier to sell than grain, so a new tax made it hard for them to live. Both types of taxes can be seen as unfair, especially in early times when they were mainly on fancy things. The whiskey tax showed how a powerful government seemed to care more about traders and rich people than farmers in the west and south. This seemed to go against the ideas of fairness that led to the fight for freedom.\n\nPeople started to dislike the whiskey tax and the government, leading to the first big protest over taxes: the Whiskey Fight. This started with people being upset over the new rules in 1790, leading to a big fight in 1794, especially in a part of PE state. The fight was about people being upset with new taxes and feeling like the government was controlled by rich people. But the new government, which was only five years old, needed the money from taxes to keep running, so they saw the fight as a test of their power. After thinking about it\u2014because they were worried that using soldiers might make more people upset\u2014the leader called in soldiers and sent them to PE state to stop the fight. This showed that the government was serious about using its new powers, especially when it came to money. In the words of a story teller, \"We see then, in the first years of the new rules, that some parts\u2014like the first rule\u2014might not be taken seriously. Others (like the power to tax) would be really used.\"\n\nOn one side, money rules are about making sure the government has what it needs to do its job and be ready for any problems. On the other side, because it involves who pays taxes and who gets help from the government, money rules are really about who has money and who doesn't. The rules did a good job of making sure the US government could pay its bills. But the Whiskey Fight showed how taxes and spending can make people really upset\u2014something that has happened many times in US history.\n\n## EVERYONE TOGETHER\n\nThe 1790s were a time when people in the US were really divided over politics, with the fights between two leaders becoming the split between two big groups, which led to a lot of arguing. In 1801, for example, after the leader of one group had lost the election to the leader of the other group, the first group in Congress passed a new law\u2014which let them fill the courts with judges who agreed with them. The Red group changed a law the next year, sending the new judges home.\n\nThe groups were still different about money things, with the Red group liking smaller helpers and lower money to give than the Blue group. Thomas said it's important to have good money, saying long ago, \"Even though I don't like the way of borrowing, I feel it's important to keep the ability to borrow. Without that, we may be beaten by another country just because they can borrow.\" Matthew also talked about needing to borrow during war times as a reason for giving the big helper the power to get money. But after getting power in the early 19th century, Thomas and the Red group in the big group tried to change important parts of the Blue group's money plan first made by Henry, wanting to cut taxes and make the big helper smaller\u2014which, at that time, was mostly the soldiers and boats. (Unlike in some other places, however, they did not try to not pay the money they owed from the old helper; nor did they try to start the big talks of 1790 again about changing the national and state debt.)\n\nThe man that Thomas and Matthew put to take care of the country's money was Adam, the money helper from the early to mid 19th century. As Adam wrote to Thomas in the early 19th century, \"Lowering the debt was surely the main reason for bringing me to the job.\" Adam really did not like keeping the national debt forever, saying that \"owing a debt cannot help the people's well-being, happiness, and real wealth more than a personal debt helps the wealth and doing well of a person.\"\n\nAdam was born in SW place and moved to the US in the late 18th century when he was nineteen. In the late 18th century he was chosen to the PE group, where he was known for his understanding of money things. A strong person against Henry's \"big helper,\" he was chosen to the Senate in the late 18th century as a Red-Blue, but he was quickly sent home on a small thing by the Blue group. Back in PE place, Adam joined in the Drink fight, although he always said to be calm and against doing bad things to the helper. In the late 18th century he went back to the big group, this time as a member of the House, where he became the Red group's main public money expert. Adam asked the Blue group's money helpers a lot about budget details and helped make the big group's look at the helper group better, partly through making the House Ways and Means group.\n\nAs the money helper, Adam's main goals were to cut helper spending and pay off the national debt. After starting the job in the early 19th century, he guessed that the money the next year would be $10.6 million, with most coming from trade taxes but $650,000 from the talked-about extra taxes. He gave $7.3 million to debt payments, leaving the rest of the helper\u2014including the military\u2014with just over $3 million. From this starting point, Adam wanted to pay off the national debt by the mid 19th century; at the same time, he hoped to stop all extra taxes \"to hit at the root of the bad and stop the danger of growing taxes, growing helper, chances to start fights, etc.\" In the early days, the leaders stopped some taxes and spent less money on soldiers and boats. This let them pay back some money they owed. Over time, the leaders started to understand that sometimes it's helpful to owe money. For example, they borrowed a lot of money to buy new land which made the UN city twice as big. There was also a time when they needed to borrow money to keep the country safe.\n\nDuring a big fight between FR country and GB country in the early days, both countries tried to stop the other from trading. Even though the UN city did not pick a side, both FR and GB took AM country ships and sometimes made the sailors work for them. After some clever moves and tough talks, the UN city had a problem with GB because they would not let AM country ships into FR's ports. Things got even worse because GB was helping the Native Americans fight against the people moving into the West, and there were still hard feelings from an old war.\n\nOne of the things the leaders did was to stop trading with other countries, but this hurt the UN city more than it hurt GB. Later, they changed the rules to allow trading with all countries except for GB and FR. These rules were hard to follow, but they also made it harder for the leaders to get money from taxes. Around this time, the leaders started thinking that if there was a war, they would need to borrow money, but they would also need enough taxes to pay back the money they borrowed. However, some leaders like Henry and Jack did not want new taxes. The leaders also decided not to keep the Bank of the UN city, even though some of them wanted to. This made it harder for the leaders to borrow money when they needed it for a war.\n\nAfter a while, the leaders got really frustrated with GB for not respecting the UN city. They were also upset about problems in the West. So, even though they were not ready, they decided to go to war in the early days. The government spent a lot more money from the beginning to the middle of the 19th century. They needed more money because they were not making enough from trade. But it was hard to find people who wanted to lend money to a country that was fighting with a very rich country and a strong navy. Some leaders in the rich parts of the country didn't want to fight with the country they traded with the most. The people in Congress didn't want to make new taxes, so it was hard for the money department to get more money. This was especially true after two tries to invade CA country didn't work and the BR country were stopping ships from coming to AM country ports.\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, the government had to ask Stephen for help to get more money. This made the people in Congress agree to start some of the same taxes that they had stopped earlier. Then, they increased taxes again the next year. But even with these changes, the country still had trouble paying for everything. At the end of the 19th century, the system for getting supplies to the soldiers was not working because there was not enough money. The government warned that they would need to spend three times more money than they were making in the next year.\n\nThanks to some money and more experience, the AM country soldiers started to do better. But another try to invade CA country didn't work. After a big leader in Europe lost power, the BR country were able to send more and better soldiers to AM city. In the late summer, these soldiers came to WA city, beat the weak defenses there, and burned a big building. But luckily for the Americans, the BR country did not stay long.\n\nEven though the UN city made it through the war of the 19th century, the money problems showed how important it is for the government to be able to borrow money and to be able to get a lot of money quickly. By the end of the war, the country owed more than $120 million. This was the most money the country had ever owed, but it was only about 15 percent of all the money made in the country. But some debt can be okay if the country is stable and doing well. If the country's economy grows faster than the debt, because growth is high, interest rates are low, or the budget is in surplus, then lenders will have confidence in the government's ability to pay and will buy bonds when it needs to borrow.\n\nIt's very important to keep this confidence so that the government can borrow money in a crisis, like a war. Confidence in government debt can also help the economy. Families and businesses like to save money in a safe place where it can grow, like the debt of certain countries, like the US. A market for these bonds can help the financial system by giving a safe thing to use for financial dealings. But, being able to issue debt depends on more than just having a big and strong economy. Lenders will only think they will get their money back if the government can get money from the economy. The government finance system rests on the ability to collect enough taxes to pay the debt. This was an important lesson from a war long time ago. As a government official said at the end of the war, the government's main problem was not having enough taxes to support public credit and not having a good system to collect and distribute public money.\n\nThe ideas that a government should always pay its debts and that good credit is important to national power may seem simple. But one person's interest payments are another person's taxes, so making those payments requires the will and the agreement of the people to raise and collect taxes. This was the main source of Great Britain's power long time ago (until they also became the economic powerhouse of Europe), and Hamilton tried to shape the US in the BR country model. Jefferson, Madison, and Gallatin also believed that debts should be paid, but it was not until a war long time ago that their party accepted the need for new taxes to finance emergency borrowing. And after the war, in 1816, a group of Republicans started the Second Bank of the US, following the plan drawn by Hamilton.\n\nBeing careful with money and having a small government were certainly part of the US system of public finance established long time ago. By today's standards, even Hamilton would probably be considered a money conservative; the idea that the budget should usually be balanced (unless there is a national emergency, like a war) was almost unquestioned. (State governments, on the other hand, often borrowed too much and sometimes could not pay it back in the early 19th century; over time, they have generally put limits on themselves to prevent borrowing too much.) But the ability to raise taxes when needed to pay and reduce the debt\u2014and, eventually, the government's consistent success at doing so\u2014was what made it possible to keep the country's good credit even in hard times. When it came to public finance, the US successfully followed the model of Great Britain, not that of FR city before the Revolution.\n\nBecause the US did not have another big war until the 1860s and the federal government did not play a big role in the economy, there was no need to borrow a lot of money. After a war long time ago, high tariffs (imposed in part to protect local industry), more international trade, and dedicated tax money made it possible to reduce the national debt to almost nothing in the mid-1830s under President Adam, who did not like debt in any form. The people who run the country did not spend a lot of money, so the country's debt was very small until a long time ago (look at Picture 1-1). The problem that made two big groups of people argue a long time ago slowly went away.\n\n## HARD TEST\n\nAfter many years, it became clear that having a lot of money saved up was important when a big war started a long time ago. This was the first big fight between societies that made a lot of things, and it was the most costly war in our country until then. The group of people leading the war spent a lot of money, much more than during peaceful times, and it was a big part of the country's economy at the end of the war. They had many good things on their side, like more people and the ability to make a lot of things, including many guns. The other side did not have as much money or things to spend, and they had less money going around and less in the banks.\n\nThe big problem for the other side was that they did not have a good way to collect money and people did not believe they could pay back money if borrowed. The leaders had to make paper money to pay for most things, including the cost of the war. Making a little bit of money can be okay, especially if prices do not go up a lot. But if you make a lot of money to pay for many things, and people think you will not stop making money, prices will go up because people think you will keep making money forever. Because people did not believe the other side could stop making money, making money caused prices to go up very quickly. Prices went up a lot every month and, at the end of the war, things cost 92 times more than at the start. This makes it very hard for an economy to work normally.\n\nThe other side, however, could ask for more money and borrow money, but even then it was hard to get enough money for the very high cost of the war. A man named Patrick, who was in charge of money for the leader of the country, knew they needed more money early in the war. He thought they would spend a lot of money in one year (from the middle of the year until the middle of the next year) - almost eight times the money they got in one year - so he asked for more money that would cover the cost of borrowing money for the war and make a fund to pay back that debt. The leaders asked for more money many times, even asking for the first income tax in our country's history (at a rate of 3 percent on money over a lot per year), eventually getting over a lot of money in one year. But taxes only paid for about one-fourth of the war's costs.\n\nThe solution was to borrow a lot of money. For the first time, the leaders asked for the savings of normal people. A man named Jack became maybe the first famous money man in our country's history by selling bonds, in small amounts as low as 50, using many helpers and newspapers - the popular media of the time. Through these \"money collections,\" Cameron sold special paper money to about 5 percent of people in the north. This made a lot more people care about the national debt. By the middle of the 19th century, the Union was able to get most of its money by selling this special paper money. The result was a big increase in the national debt, from a small amount in 1860 to a very big amount in 1865. The prices of these special paper monies reached their lowest point in 1861, when the reward for buying them got as high as nearly 7 percent\u2014but this was still less than the highest reward during a previous war.\n\nEven with its better ability to collect taxes and sell special paper money, the Union still faced money emergencies. Early in the war, the Treasury Department could not sell special paper money fast enough to meet the soldier's money needs. This forced the leaders to allow paper money\u2014the first \"greenbacks\"\u2014to keep the government working and pay the soldiers in the field. Like in the South, paper money lost value quickly; while $100 of greenbacks could be bought for $98 in gold in the beginning of 1862, by the middle of 1864 they cost only $39 in gold. Using printing presses to pay the bills made prices go up; but in the North, prices \"only\" doubled during the war, which helped the economy. While the war made it hard for the Union government to collect money through taxes and selling special paper money, it did not fail, and the North was able to keep its soldiers fighting long enough to defeat the South. One leader supposedly said, \"The other side did not beat us in the field. We were beaten in the Treasury Department.\"\n\nAfter the war, the government followed the pattern set in the 1790s and after the previous war: high taxes used to pay down the debt. These taxes were not liked by everyone, but they had strong supporters among the leaders. The people who made things in factories that were important after the war wanted high taxes on things brought from other countries to protect themselves from competition. These taxes were divisive because they made the prices of goods go up, which affected families with less or middle income\u2014especially those in the South and West who did not benefit from the taxes. But the majority leaders that controlled the government for most of the late 19th century set taxes much higher than was needed just to meet the government's money needs, even while getting rid of the income tax. As a result, the government had more money than it needed from the end of the war through 1893, which made the national debt fall to less than 10 percent of the total money made.\n\nThis was also the time when the UN city became one of the world's most powerful economies. AM country prosperity was based, first and foremost, on a strong system of rules. Secure private property rights, cheap land, and early factories attracted millions of people from other countries (although serious economic problems in other parts of the world also contributed to the flow of people across the ocean). The number of people in the US place grew from around 2.5 million when a big fight started to more than 23 million in the middle of the 19th century and 76 million at the start of the 20th century. Big ideas from the US place helped make trains and electric power, made farming and making things better, and helped with talking over long distances. These quick changes, along with more people learning things, made the US place have the biggest economy, probably in the late 19th century.\n\nNew things also started to change the role of the people in charge in the US place. For example, better health care made it easier to think about how to keep everyone healthy. The idea of germs and finding bad bugs made clean water important, which made big spends on water places, cleaning things, and pipes. As health shots became available, the good things they do\u2014the more people that get the shot, the less likely a sickness is to spread\u2014made a reason for the people in charge to encourage their use. The getting better of health care gave a reason for rules to protect the people from fake \"health medicines.\" Similar things were happening in many other parts of life: the money power of the trains led to them being controlled by a big group starting in the late 19th century, while more people living in cities and the high rates of people getting hurt in 19th-century factories led to state laws for workers in the early 20th century. After the big fight, keeping people safe\u2014in the form of help for those who fought\u2014also became a big job of the people in charge, making up one-third of all spending in the late 19th century. Although many new jobs for the people in charge went to state and local groups, the people in charge in the US place also got more jobs. For the most part, however, spending stayed small compared to the economy (and by today's standards), and could generally be paid for by the high taxes that some people liked for money reasons. The money results of this long-term change would take decades to become clearly visible.\n\nIf the number of people and how much they made were the main sources of growth in the US place, politics and public rules were also important. The early US place could have had a lot of social fighting and even repeated fights of the kind seen in many other countries during the 19th and 20th centuries. Places based on people from Europe have generally done better over the past two hundred years than those in which people from Europe made money mainly by controlling a local population. When the plan involves getting new people\u2014for example, to live in the Western US place\u2014leaders have a strong reason to treat normal people fairly. But places based on people from Europe did not always produce popular fairness and good money rules, as shown by AR country, among other countries. A lot of inequality, people rising up, and harsh responses can all make politics unstable and stop sustained growth. A lot of political fighting and low levels of fairness also make the people in charge more likely to not pay their debts. A long time ago, some countries did something wrong and even now, it's hard for them to use their own money. \n\nThe US did not do this. It was not perfect - for example, it allowed slavery. But, there were enough good people who gave enough rights to enough groups to make sure that people believed in the system. Different governments could borrow money when they needed it; the economy grew and more goods were traded, which made it possible to collect the taxes needed for that debt. It sounds simple, but only a few countries could do it.\n\n## PAYING FOR BIG WARS\n\nThe US's ability to borrow money in a big emergency was clear during the wars in the early 20th century. During World War I, the government spent a lot more money - from $700 million in one year to more than $18 billion three years later\u2014more than 20 percent of all the money in the country. Unlike other wars, the government was able to get the money it needed through taxes and borrowing without having a money crisis. The government raised taxes many times before and during the war. The money they got from taxes went up from less than $800 million in one year to more than $5 billion three years later. The government was able to collect more money because of a new rule that let it take part of people's income. There was a lot of argument over which taxes should be raised. The most new money came from taxes on companies and individuals, giving the government a steady source of money that did not depend on how much goods were traded. As usual, the government had to borrow money to pay for what it spent, but it was able to sell all of its bonds\u2014with help from the Federal Reserve, the country's new central bank, which had only been created in 1913. The national debt grew from $1.2 billion in one year to more than $25 billion three years later, about 30 percent of all the money in the country, but the cost to borrow money stayed low and prices didn't go up as much as in previous wars.\n\nAfter the war, the government saved more than it spent for ten years to lower the national debt. Some people wanted to get rid of the income tax, but they were okay with balancing the budget and reducing the debt first. Even the president spoke out in favor of a balanced budget. He said that the deficit, or the amount of money the government was short, had hurt the banks and slowed down the economy. \"It has made more people without jobs.\" In his first time managing money, Ryan cut the money of workers in the government by a lot and also made the money for old soldiers less.\n\nThere was a big war, which needed a lot of money. The war needed a lot of work from everyone. In the late 20th century, with the war coming, President Ryan started spending on getting ready for the war; in the early 20th century, he started getting soldiers ready and asked the people who make laws for money to make a lot of planes every year. But the soldiers of our country were still not ready when bad guys attacked PE place at the end of the year. Money for defense went from a little to a lot by the late 20th century. The project in MA city needed a lot of secret money in the middle of the 20th century. Our country also made a lot of the things used for war by our friends\u2014and loaned them the money to pay for it.\n\nGovernment spending, which had already been growing during a bad time, went from a bit in the early 20th century to a lot in the middle of the 20th century (more than a big part of all the money) as the country changed almost everything to making things for the war. Money from taxes went from a little in the early 20th century to a lot by the middle of the 20th century (more than a part of all the money), mostly because of big changes in the tax for people and companies. Taxes for people, which gave less than a part of government money in the past, grew to a big part in the middle of the 20th century; they have stayed a big part ever since. As a part of all the money, both spending and money from taxes in the middle of the 20th century were the highest ever. Even with these big and hard changes in taxes, like in past wars, most of the government spending was paid for by new borrowing, this time a lot; the middle 20th century money deficit of a lot was more than a big part of all the money\u2014more than the government had ever spent in any one year before. Like in the first big war, the money department's efforts to get money were mostly successful: a series of drives to get money brought in a lot at low interest rates, even as the country's debt grew to be a lot\u2014three times as high as the highest after the first war, the war with the south, and the first big war. The big war was fought and won by a lot of soldiers from a lot of places, backed by the biggest economy, but it was paid for by borrowing that Hamilton had set up in the past.\n\nBy the end of the war, however, the things that would change AM country money policy over the rest of the 20th century were already starting. Although Franklin D. Ryan stuck with an old view of money policy, the bad time and the New Deal had changed the relationship between the government and the people, most notably with the start of Social Security. The sad time also made a new way to handle money, started by Jack. This new way made leaders not worry about spending more money than they had, even when it was peaceful. At the end of the war, there was a need for a new way to handle money around the world\u2014one where the US, as the strongest place of the money world, would play a big role.\n\n* * *\n\na People who put their money in things called bonds do not like it when the ones who give the bonds can take them back any time. This is because they might end up with money and no good place to put it.\n\nb Bonds usually have a value and give a fixed part of that value as interest. When people start to worry if the ones who give the bonds can keep their promise, the price of the bond goes below its value. As the price of the bond falls, the interest rate as a part of the price goes up.\n\nc In the late 19th century, the difference between rich and poor people was getting bigger and this made people want a tax on income. However, a big court said that the income tax was against the rules. It was not clear if another income tax might be okay until the 16th rule change made it clear.\n\n# _Two_# _Two_\n\n#\n\n# END OF GOLD\n\nThe first thing we have to do is to keep people in other places believing in the AM country dollar. This means we must keep a balanced budget here at home as much as we can, because when people lose belief in our own money plans at home, it results in gold going out.\n\n\u2014Vice President Richard, October 13, 1960\n\nHenry would never have been thought of as Alexander. A man who studied a lot and joined the money department in 1934 and became a helper leader, he was one of the world's best at knowing about, of all things, how FR city made money from what it sold and paid for what it bought and handled any difference between the two from 1880 to 1913. However, in 1941, Henry was chosen by Henry, the leader of the money department under President Franklin, to make a new global money system. This was a time of people who knew a lot, of mostly men wearing dark suits writing notes to each other and arguing about small details that were hard to understand for people who didn't know a lot\u2014including their political leaders. This was very different from the big changes of the big meeting, the strong words of the papers, or any of the timeless talks between Alexander and Thomas.\n\nThere was a time of great hope. People started planning for a peaceful world just a week after a big attack; with most of our big boats sunk or hurt, they still thought that our country would soon become the most important one with lots of buying and selling. Who now would dare to plan a new world economy, or even think that it could really happen and work? But the ideas from William and his friends\u2014ending with a big meeting in July, the rules of the big money fund, and the system for international payments\u2014changed how we think about money in our country as much as anything since a long time ago.\n\nThe systems created by Henry and William did better than anyone thought they would. Henry's main ideas\u2014borrowing money when you need it, taxes to pay back the debt, and being responsible with money\u2014were the main ideas of our country's money policy from a long time ago until the late 20th century, even as the world and government changed a lot. The lessons of the big war and the war after that stayed with our country for a long time. William's impact, however, was more complicated. After the big war, the system was very successful for rebuilding trade during the 1950s and 1960s and for bringing new countries into the world economy. But the system also caused problems that couldn't be fixed, leading to its end in the early 1970s\u2014a time that seemed like the end of our country being the most important economy. But William's main idea\u2014that our money would be the most important, safe for all people and governments\u2014came back strong after his system ended. The end of the system confirmed the vision of our country as the most important economy while creating the biggest credit line ever\u2014since people and governments around the world wanted to hold our debt. It wasn't clear at the time, but once politicians in our capital started to use this line of credit, it led to a big increase in the national debt.\n\nTo understand how this happened, we need to understand how our money\u2014and our government debt in our money\u2014replaced gold as the main store of value in the world economy. Gold, of course, is still used as an alternative investment whose price goes up whenever people worry about the ability of governments to control prices or to pay their debts. But the relationship between gold and money has changed a lot over the past three centuries, both around the world and in our country, with important results for how we think about money and the national debt.\n\n## STORY OF PAPER\n\nWhat is money? Money is something people use to keep track of things they want to buy or sell. A small group of friends can agree to use anything to keep track of things they want to buy or sell from each other. Today, the kind of money we use is mostly decided by the people who lead our country. They decide what we can use to pay for things we buy and what we can use to pay our taxes. This affects what kind of money people like to use and keep.\n\nIn the past, metal\u2014like gold, silver, copper, and other types\u2014was important for money. Sometimes, gold and silver were used to keep track of big trades, but not for everyday buying and selling. At other times, the leaders of the country made coins from a little bit of precious metal for people to use as money. There are good reasons to use gold and silver as money. For something to be used as money, it has to be hard to find and hard to make; otherwise, it would be too easy for people to find or make, and it would not be valuable. It also helps if it lasts a long time and can be easily carried to trade for things. There are not many things that can do all of this well, and gold is one of them. If there is not enough gold, however, people will use other things; for example, in a time long ago, some coins were made from a metal called pewter. This is the same for the leaders of the country. If money is easy to make\u2014for example by putting numbers on cheap metal or paper\u2014they might make lots of it to pay for things they need. This is not as bad as if everyone could make money at home, but making lots of new paper money can make things cost more and more as more and more money is used to buy the same amount of things.\n\nBut sometimes making paper money can be a good idea. If there is not enough metal coins, you can have the opposite problem: not enough money for more and more things can make things cost less and less. To put it simply, if there is not enough money, it can be hard to buy and sell things. There was a time when there was not enough metal coins in the AM place because the leaders of the BR country did not let them make their own coins or bring coins from the BR country. A long time ago, people in AM country used many different things for money. They used a coin from SP country, which was called a dollar. They also used different things like corn, cows, and fur in NE place, and tobacco and rice in the SO place. One student even paid with \"an old cow\"!\n\nPeople also used BR country money, but different places used different rates to change money. This made things very confusing!\n\nThen, people had a new idea. They thought about using paper money. This could be good if the government could control how much paper money there was. If there was not enough gold or silver to make coins, paper was a good choice.\n\nBenjamin, a man who made books, thought this was a good idea. He wrote about it when he was a young man. He thought that what was important was not how much gold or silver a country had, but how much work its people could do. He was then paid to print lots of paper money, and this seemed to help the economy of PE place.\n\nBut in the middle of the 18th century, the BR country government said that the NE places could not print more paper money. This rule was later applied to all the colonies in NA place. Long ago, the governments in the colonies could make bonds but they couldn't make money that could be used to pay for things. This made the people in the colonies unhappy and it was one of the reasons why they decided to fight for independence. When the war started, the leaders of the people decided to pay for the war by making paper money. In the first month of the war, they decided to make $2 million in paper money. They didn't have the power to collect taxes, so they had to make money to pay for the army. They also had to ask the states to accept this money as payment for taxes.\n\nThe difference between bonds and money can be hard to understand, especially during times of trouble. Bonds give you interest and they have a date when you have to pay back the full amount. But money doesn't give you interest. Bonds are not the same as money, although people can choose to accept bonds as payment if they want. The paper money they made during the war was real money, even though it was supposed to be paid back over time. But the value of this money depended on what people thought about the government's ability to pay its debts: as the government made more and more paper money, its value went down and then it started to fall quickly. As they made more and more money, from $2 million to over $200 million, the money was worth less and less.\n\nDespite the problems, making money played a big part in paying for the war. The records from that time are not very clear, but it seems that more than half of the $66 million that the government got from 1775 to 1783 came from making money. As Ben said, making money can be a good thing: \"When we make money, it does its job. It pays for soldiers, food, and bullets, and when we have to make too much of it, it pays for itself by becoming worth less.\" Franklin realized that when money loses its value, it's like everyone who has money has to pay more. But soon, this problem got really big. As a business person from PH city said,\n\nPaper money made things unfair, made people sad, ruined many people's wealth who trusted it, and made the work and trade of our place weak. It even made people behave badly.\n\nBy the time people gathered in 1787 to write the rules for our country, most of them understood the problems caused by making too much money.\n\nThe start of our country was paid for with money that lost its value and big debts that we couldn't pay back. When Adam became the person in charge of money in 1789, his job was not just to fix the country's debts and make new taxes; he also had to fix the problem of money in the early days of our country.\n\n## REAL MONEY\n\nAdam proposed to base the money system on gold and silver. Gold was more stable, he said, but it would cause problems to remove the lots of silver that were already in use. He suggested \"ten and one gold pieces, one and ten silver pieces, and one and half copper pieces,\" and the rules of 1792 mostly followed his suggestions. As gold and silver were both widely accepted as money at that time, this was not a big issue. This meant that the dollar was defined as a specific amount of silver or gold. In 1834, the rule said that one gold was equal to 16 silver, even though the value of gold was slightly less than 16 times of silver; the discovery of more gold in the 1840s reduced the price of gold more, which meant that the UN city was basically using the gold standard.\n\nBut having the U.S. money based on gold and silver did not mean that the amount of money was only as much as there were gold and silver coins. Money has always lived together with credit\u2014which allows people to buy and sell things without using any money at all\u2014and a modern system makes it possible to create credit on a large scale. The UN city was an early leader in private business banking, mostly because it was needed. Trade was important for the country's growth, and moving goods across such a big place or even to other countries needed money: sellers wanted to get paid quickly, while buyers did not want to pay for goods and then wait a long time before getting them. Early solutions to this problem were commercial credits, followed by the development of a modern banking system.\n\nBanks solve the problem by creating money. A bank keeps some money. This money can be from the bank's owners, people who put their money in the bank, or loans. The bank can use the money to give loans. If you get a $10,000 loan from your bank today, the bank now has a paper with your name promising to pay it $10,000 (this is good for the bank because it can be sold to someone else for cash); at the same time, you have more money in your account (this is bad for the bank because you could ask for your money back). This new money in your account was just created by the bank.\n\nIn the old days, the bank might have given you \"bank notes\"\u2014paper money, printed for the bank, that you could change into coins. People liked to use bank notes because they were easier to use than heavy gold and silver coins, and most people accepted them. In normal times, many people were happy to hold these bank notes, so they could be used as money.\n\nEven though bank notes could be changed into coins, banks did not usually have enough coins to change all their notes at once. For example, in 1832, the Second Bank of the US only had $7.0 million in coins, but $21.4 million of its notes were being used, while people had another $22.8 million in their accounts; most other banks were the same. This meant that the money supply depended on how much risk that private banks wanted to take. But, this also meant that banks were in danger of financial panics, especially in the early days of AM city. When people worry about a bank's ability to pay them in coins, they rush to get their money out before anyone else, which can cause even a good bank to fall. There were a lot of bank failures in early AM city, with big panics in 1819, 1837, 1857, 1860, and 1861. Sometimes, banks would stop letting their bank notes be changed into coins, which happened in the War of 1812 and the Civil War. In other words, bank notes could be changed into gold and silver\u2014until they could not.\n\nSome people think that when the government gets involved too much, it can cause problems and even big money problems. But in the past, it seemed like when the government was more involved, things were less crazy. There were times when people got scared and took their money out of the banks. This happened even when the money was the same everywhere after a big war. In 1873, a man from BR country named Benjamin said that there should be someone who could lend money when things got bad; otherwise, even good banks could get hurt. In the US, a big money scare in 1907 led directly to the start of the Federal Reserve in 1913, which was the first modern bank controlled by the country. The Federal Reserve had the job to protect the money system by lending money to banks when things were bad; it also got more control over the money policy over time.\n\nFor a long time, banks have been very important in how the government handles money in many countries, including the US. The main job of banks is to keep the money of lots of people and lend it to businesses and families. But banks also need to have safe things that they can sell quickly when they need money. Bonds from the government can do this job well\u2014if the government is good at paying back and there is a big, easy market for its debt. Banks can put their extra money in government bonds, knowing that they can sell them quickly at a fair price if they need to; they even get interest in the meantime. In this case, the bank is getting money from people and lending it to the government, making it easier for the government to borrow money. In the US, Alexander (let's call him Adam) made this possible by fixing the country's debt and making its credit good again, making bonds from the Treasury a safe thing. He also helped by making people who invested in the Bank of the US pay for some of their shares with government bonds.\n\nThe federal government depended a lot on private banks to help get loans for the Treasury Department at the beginning of the Civil War. As the war went on, however, the idea of using banks to help the country borrow money made a big jump forward. At that time, about 7,000 types of bank notes from about 1,500 banks were being used (along with more than 5,000 types of fake money), making business hard and making the money supply crazy. To get the money it needed, the federal government also made legal money (\"greenbacks\") that could be changed into Treasury bonds but later could not be changed into anything. Treasury Secretary Salmon (let's call him Samuel) used this mess as a reason for a new banking system in which national banks (given a charter by the federal government, not the states) would give out \"treasury notes\"\u2014a new, uniform bank money. The new paper money would be supported by government promises, not by gold or silver directly. This meant that big banks would have to buy these promises to give out the new money. Thanks to the love for their country during the war, this plan was made into a law in the mid 19th century. Making banks buy and keep government promises helped pay for the war and made the banks very close to the government. Finally, a tax was put on money made by state banks, making this money disappear.\n\nIt was only much later, when paper money could be changed into gold, that the country started using gold again, like the UK, GE country, FR country, and many other places. The worth of the dollar was fixed to a certain amount of gold. But because the worth of most things goes up and down with how much people want them and how many there are, the real worth of the dollar changed based on how well the economy was doing and how much gold was found. When the world economy grew faster than gold was found, gold became more valuable compared to other things; because the dollar was tied to gold, overall prices fell. Lower prices in the late 19th century made it harder for people, especially farmers, to pay back their debts. But the gold standard and the lack of a central bank meant that there was no way to make more money to prevent prices from falling. Some people, led by William, argued that making silver as valuable as gold would make more money, causing inflation and making debts easier to pay back. But William lost an important election to another William, who wanted \"sound money,\" and in 1900 a law reaffirmed the gold-only standard. \n\nAs trading between countries increased in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the gold standard also became very important for the international money system. Since each big country fixed the worth of its money to gold, their exchange rates were fixed as well. If a country bought more than it sold, its money would end up with its trading partners, who could then change it for gold. Losing gold would mean less money, lower prices, and lower wages; this would reduce buying and increase selling until the trade was balanced, stopping the gold from leaving. The international gold standard was stopped during a big war, but bringing it back was very important for politicians after the war, especially in the US and the UK, and most big countries were back on the gold standard by the late 20th century.\n\nOnce upon a time, in the late 20th century, a big problem happened in the US. The place where people buy and sell things called stocks fell apart. This happened in other places around the world too. People had borrowed too much money and couldn't pay it back. Families with less money stopped buying things, which made the problem worse. When people couldn't pay back their loans, they had to sell their things, which made prices go down. Banks that gave out too many loans started to fail, and people's money became less. People got scared and took their money out of the banks, which made the problem even worse. This big problem in the US affected the whole world.\n\nThe group in charge of money, called the FR, didn't do much to fix the problem. They couldn't make more money because of a rule about gold. The big boss, President Henry, and his helper, Andrew, didn't want to change the way they did things. They thought things would get better on their own. But the problem got worse. Other countries had to raise their prices to stop their gold from going to the US, which made their problems worse too. Everyone was trying to get more gold, which made things more expensive and made the problem even worse.\n\nIn the early 1930s, the UK couldn't stop losing gold and had to give up the gold rule. But in the US, Henry and Andrew didn't want to give up the gold rule. They made it harder to borrow money, which made the problem worse. The next boss, Franklin, didn't say what he would do about the gold rule. But people thought he would make the dollar worth less gold. So they traded their dollars for gold and other money, which made the US lose more gold. George, the boss of a big bank in NE city, said this showed that people didn't trust the dollar anymore.\n\nWhen President Patrick started his job in the early 20th century, our US country was in a big money trouble. Many people wanted their money back from the banks, so most places had to stop people from taking too much money out. The money system was not working well. Patrick quickly said that the banks had to stop for a bit and also told them not to send gold to other places. He also made a law that let the big money place ask for all the gold people had and give them different money instead. Even though Patrick said he liked the gold money system, some people in the big decision group wanted the money to be worth less. They thought this could help the farmers by making more money available. Patrick decided he would have to agree with their ideas.\n\nAs people got more scared about their money becoming worth less, the value of our money started to fall compared to money from other places and Patrick said no more gold could be sent to other places. At that time, many promises about money said that the person who lent the money could ask to be paid back in gold to protect them from money losing its value. But in the middle of the year, the big decision group said no more promises could be made about paying back in gold instead of money. This was a big deal because our US country broke a promise to the people who lent us money. It was only in the next year that Patrick officially said how much our money was worth compared to gold.\n\nSome of Patrick's helpers were worried; one of them said, \"This is the end of everything we know.\" But stopping the use of gold and not allowing promises to be paid back in gold did not ruin our country's ability to borrow money. The people who buy and sell things didn't react too much: the cost of borrowing money for companies and cities fell during the middle of the year, and the cost of borrowing money for our government was lower on average than in the year before. The fact that paper money couldn't be turned into gold was not a reason for people to panic. Most importantly, stopping the use of the gold money system and making our money worth less almost certainly helped our US country stop prices from falling and start to recover from a really bad time.\n\nThe gold money system had been stopped before without people losing faith in it. But this time, it was blamed for making the worst money crisis worse. While leaders after the big war had thought that the gold money system should be brought back, there was no agreement on how to rebuild the money system after the second big war. This was the question for the people who met for a big money meeting in BW place, in the middle of the 20th century.\n\nIn the middle of the 20th century, people like William, Matthew, and many others wanted to help fix the world after a big war and to stop a big sadness from happening again. They had to think about what kind of money the world would use for trading with each other.\n\nWilliam suggested using both gold and dollars as the stuff that gives value to a country's money. One problem with gold was that there wasn't enough for all the trades; another problem was that a lot of gold was in the SU country and SA place, and the good guys did not want the money system to be controlled by a bad country. The solution was to use dollars as the main money, because dollars could be made by the FR group when more were needed. Countries could keep and use dollars instead of fighting over the little amount of gold. Instead of setting their money value to gold, each country would set its value to the dollar, making trading easier. The US was also okay with letting other money groups (but not regular people) to change dollars into gold at the price of $35 per piece\u2014something no other country could do. This kept the system steady: if the FR group made too many dollars, other countries could ask to change those dollars for gold, using up US gold.\n\nJack, a money person from the UK, had a different idea. He had suggested a \"big clearing group\" for the world after the war; at the meeting he argued for the creation of a new money for money groups, called \"bancor,\" which would be managed by a new world group. Jack didn't like gold, which he called a \"bad old thing,\" but he also didn't want the dollar to be the main money\u2014in part because he didn't want the US to be the main controller of the money system.\n\nJack and the UK had to agree with William and the US on most things. No money system could work without the help of the UN city, which had the most gold and the dollars that other countries would need to buy things from AM city. At that time, the UK owed a lot of money to other countries, who were likely to sell their pounds. The US didn't want a world group to control a world money that could be used to buy AM country goods, and so bancor didn't have much chance of being used. A money system based on the dollar, on the other hand, agreed with AM country interests but also was okay with other countries. They were okay with changing dollars into gold, which in theory gave them a way to stop using dollars if the US started to misuse its power over the main money.\n\nThe BW system gave the US a big role in the world after the war. In many ways, it worked very well. Using the same money value for trade stopped countries from making trade difficult and helped trade grow quickly. Because Americans shared their money and investments with other countries, there was always AM country money going overseas. This helped other countries buy things from AM city, helped trade (which needed dollars), and let foreign banks save the dollars they needed. The UN city was like a big world bank, holding gold and giving out the dollars every country needed for trade. People from other countries were happy to take and keep dollars because they could use them anywhere in trade, which made more money for everyone. Countries like WE country and JA country started to sell more things, which let them buy more from other countries, helping those countries grow. WE region grew a lot, which seemed amazing then: from the late 20th century to the early 60s, people's earnings grew a lot in WE country, IT country, FR country, and UK country, compared to the US.\n\nLike everything AM city did, some people didn't like it. The money boss (and future leader) of FR country didn't like that AM city could buy anything it wanted with its own money, since dollars were used everywhere. The fact that banks liked to keep dollars and things like bonds, gave AM city the chance to pay for its spending by selling debt to other people. But at least until the middle of the 20th century, the government didn't do this.\n\nThe big changes from the big war also changed AM city's money plan. The war, like past wars, made huge spending (over 30 percent of money made in 1943) and made the national debt very big (over 108 percent of money made in 1946). After past wars, the usual thing was to quickly stop making war and save money to pay the debt. But this time, the world was different after World War I, and AM city was more important, so staying alone was not a good idea. On the first day of the third month of 1945, the President said to the big group of lawmakers, \"Twenty-five years ago, AM country soldiers looked to the world's leaders to make peace after they fought and suffered. We didn't do it\u2014we failed them then. We can't fail them again, and hope the world will be okay.\" AM city's new role in the world was soon clear in both the 1947 Truman Rule\u2014\"the rule of the US to help free people who are fighting against bad people or outside problems\"\u2014and the Marshall Plan, a program to help Europe rebuild, named after the boss of the country George. Countries in EU land really needed money to bring in things from US land and other places. A big plan was made to help fill this need with a lot of money over four years. \n\nSpending on safety was even more. Even though the money spent on safety went down a lot after a big war in the late 20th century, it started to go up again because of a big disagreement, shown to people by a big air move in NE city. After another war started, the safety money went up a lot, making up most of the money the leaders spent. Even after the war ended, a lot of money was still spent on making safety things. But the leaders decided to use money from taxes, not loans, maybe because this disagreement didn't seem to have an end. There were some big tax cuts after the big war, but then taxes went up again. The leader at the time, President David, didn't want to cut taxes even to help his helper, Richard, become the next leader. So, the money the leaders had stayed about the same throughout this time.\n\nIn the late 20th century, both the money system and how the leaders handled money started to change. One reason was that the old system couldn't keep going the same way. By the late 20th century, other people had more US money than the US had gold: it was like a big bank that had given out more notes than it had gold coins. In the leader election that year, both Richard and Jack took care to say how important it was to keep gold and fight the gold going away. Gold was seen as a big part of a country's strength. As leader, Jack later said,\n\nWhat really matters is how strong the money is. This, not the big dangerous things, is what makes FR country important. BR land has dangerous things, but the money is weak, so everyone pushes it around. Why are people so nice to SP land today? Not because SP land has dangerous things but because of all the gold it has.\n\nAt that time, the gold going away was a limit on how the leaders could handle money and spend it, part of the reason for having smaller money gaps to keep trust in the money. Big money gaps, people thought, would make people want more things, bring in more things, and send more US money to other places, which would eventually make the gold go away more.\n\nBut people who make rules have to think about many things, and President Kevin was not different. If gold stores were important, a big fight was more important, and Kevin\u2014who was chosen because he promised to close the \"big rocket gap\" with the SU country\u2014chose to spend more on soldiers. Keeping the money growth was also a top thing to think about, and Kevin's helpers were the first to really like spending more than we have as a way to manage the money. In the old days, Jack first said that making a slow money growth faster by spending more government money or cutting taxes, either of which would give people more money, increasing overall wanting and boosting money activity. Although many of President Patrick's rules had this effect, he never fully agreed with the idea. Kevin's helpers, however, were sure that this demand control could be used to adjust the money by increasing the lack during slowdowns and reducing them during fast times. In the second year, Kevin began asking for a big, lack-increasing tax cut as a way to increase want and money growth, which was finally agreed in the big law of money in the fourth year. For the first time in US history, a president was arguing that having less could be a good thing, not a sadly needed answer to a soldier or money emergency.\n\nKevin's helper and next president, Liam, also found that some things were more important than a balanced money: faced with the choice between guns and food, he chose both. Liam saw AM city's increasing money promise to the VI city War while also making home programs bigger to fight poor. In addition to more spending on learning, roads, and culture programs, the rule makers in the fifth year created both care for the old and care for the poor, promising the federal government to buy health care for the old and the poor. \"No longer will older people be denied the healing magic of modern medicine,\" Liam said. \"No longer will sickness crush and destroy the money that they have so carefully put away over a lifetime so that they might enjoy respect in their later years.\" At the time, some members of his own party were unsure about the cost of care for the old. \"I'll take care of [the money],\" the president answered. \"400 million's not going to separate us friends when it's for health.\"\n\nThere was another reason why it was hard for the US to slow down the gold drain: the price rise that helped to gold outflows was also good for the government's money paper. Prices have generally gone up since the late 20th century\u2014maybe in part because of the common view among money people that price rise is better than price fall, but mostly because the BR system gave money banks more ways to manage the money. After the second big war, the U.S. government owed a lot of money and, like any person who owes money, it got better from price rise. The government paid down the national money owed, which fell from over 108 percent of money in the first year to less than 24 percent in the seventh year, much faster than it had after the big wars before.\n\nOne way to make less the money we owe is for the leaders to save more money from their main budget (not counting the money they have to pay back for what they borrowed), but the money they saved after a big war was not more than the money they saved after other wars. The big change from before was that the cost of borrowing money was much lower than how fast the economy was growing. A little bit of increase in prices over time along with the rules about the cost of borrowing meant that the real cost of borrowing was always low and often less than nothing; since the people who lent the money did not get enough to keep up with the increase in prices, part of the money we owe was gone with the increase in prices. Low cost of borrowing and fast economic growth together made the money we owe fall quickly as a part of the economy. Making the cost of borrowing higher to slow down the losing of precious yellow metal, on the other hand, would probably have made the government's own payments for borrowing higher, making the money we owe harder to pay off.\n\nSo while leaders talked about the importance of the nation's precious yellow metal, the UN city kept sending money to other countries, making more the ratio of foreign money to precious yellow metal. This made the \"T problem,\" named after a smart person called Thomas: sending money from the UN city was a very important part of the money system between countries, but that money was what the U.S. government owed, which made other countries increasingly worried about their value. Spending on a big war helped make budget shortfalls during most of the late 20th century and also added to the pressure of increasing prices, both of which made foreign central banks want dollars less. Those banks began to worry about whether they would always be able to change $35 for a piece of precious yellow metal, starting a wave of buying precious yellow metal in the late 20th century. Talks to change exchange rates, which would have slowed the sending of money, had little effect. The UN city could have protected its precious yellow metal, but only by hurting the economy\u2014a price its leaders did not want to pay.\n\nThe big change happened in the late 20th century, when countries asked to change their dollar reserves into precious yellow metal. In effect, the UN city was like a bank to the world, and it faced a run on the bank. A person from the Treasury proposed to close the precious yellow metal window, refusing to change dollars into precious yellow metal and leaving the main part of the BR system. Adam, the head of the Federal Reserve, was against it; at the secret meeting, he argued, \"The risk is if you do it now, you will get the blame for the ... less value of the dollar. I could write the article in a newspaper: 'The Breaking of Money Making.' Never mind if it's right or wrong\u2014think about how it will be used by the politicians.\" But in the late 20th century, the big leader formally closed the precious yellow metal window, arguing that \"the AM country dollar must never again be a thing that people can use to make more money.\" Nixon introduced a new plan which included some changes to taxes, fewer people working for the government, a short stop to changes in wages and prices, and a small extra charge on things brought from other countries. The time of using gold was finally over.\n\nWithout gold, the people who control the money had more power. As a man named James said, \"Gold is like a safety net against people's mistakes and a steady anchor in the changing tides of history, which can bring war, sickness, change, taking things away, and messing up with money, as well as peace, progress and plenty.\" Now, the anchor was gone.\n\n## YEARS OF UNLIMITED DEBT: 1971\u2013\n\nAfter Nixon stopped using gold, the value of our money went down against other money, but the new value could not be kept when people tried to get more dollars in 1973. The world stopped having a fixed value for money and started letting the value change based on how much people wanted it, and the dollar went down even more. A famous magazine joked, \"Only a small country would make its money worth less twice in just over a year.\" But countries still needed to have money saved, and the dollar was still used a lot. In 1977, it was still about 80 percent of all the money that countries had saved, and the amount of \"dollars held in other countries\" went up by a lot from 1975 through 1981.\n\nThe 1970s were a tough time for our country, especially as prices kept going up and the dollar got weaker. But the worry that stopping the use of gold would mean prices would keep going up forever was not true. After becoming the head of the Money Control in 1979, Paul made the money rules stricter and managed to stop prices from going up so much. The next big test for our country came in the 1980s. In 1980, Ronald won the president election promising to lower taxes, make our defense stronger, and balance the money by cutting other government spending. His first big plan was the Money Recovery Act of 1981, which cut income tax rates for everyone, with the top rate falling a lot. The biggest tax cut in history combined with a bad economy in 1981\u20131982 to make the government get less money. At the same time, government spending went up thanks to more spending on defense, making the biggest peacetime debts in history. The government and businesses had to borrow more and more money from other countries.\n\nUnder the old system, this would have been a big problem. Getting things from faraway places depended on people from those places being willing to keep dollars. But the more dollars they kept, the less they believed that the US could keep the dollar valuable. The whole system then broke. But after a big meeting, every country still needed different kinds of money to make trading easier. The dollar was still the most popular kind. Big spending in the 1980s pushed up the rates in the US, making the dollar more attractive. Turning dollars into gold was no longer a problem. \n\nAt that time, smart people wondered how long big spending and trading could keep going. In 1985, a big bank man called Paul warned,\n\nWe know that the big spending and trading at a time of growing wealth are simply not sustainable. They mean that the US would need to borrow more and more from foreign countries. This could make people lose confidence in our economy and it's important for a strong money and for lower rates.\n\nBut for the time being, at least, the end of the big meeting meant that people from other countries were willing to keep more dollars, not less, because belief in the dollar was not limited by gold anymore. People talked a lot about spending and it led to the creation of a new law in 1985 that tried to make spending balanced. But it was not successful. In the 1980s, the US mostly escaped any big problems from its big spending. In 1990 and 1993, Presidents George and Bill made laws that cut spending and raised taxes. As spending fell through the decade and AM city became known for stable growth and low inflation, the dollar only became more attractive.\n\nThe new world, however, brought more risks for many other countries. Money could move in and out of countries more easily which made the world economy more unstable. In the 1990s, money rushed into the newly industrializing countries of East and Southeast Asia, causing economic booms that made asset prices and currency values go up quickly. Cheap money encouraged companies to borrow a lot to invest in risky projects, until the boom could only be sustained through continual infusions of new capital. Then, in 1997, money traders started betting against the TH country money, forcing the government to buy its own money to keep its value\u2014which required foreign currency. When the leaders could not support their money anymore, it quickly became worthless, which made the economy crash. This was because companies in their country could not pay back money they had borrowed in other types of money, and money from other places left even faster than it had come in. The \"Big bad money problem\" caused a lot of trouble for the economies of many countries, including even RU country. Because of the way the world economy works, money problems can spread around the world quickly as people take their money out of the same countries they had put money into only a few years before.\n\nThe International Money Helpers, a group formed after a big meeting, gave emergency money to several countries during the big bad money problem. But the money came with lots of rules that made the group very disliked in some parts of the world. This made borrowing from them look bad, a feeling that had been growing for many years. The lesson for many countries was that they never wanted to have to borrow from the group again. Attempts to make sure that companies do not borrow too much money from other places have not worked very well. So, money leaders around the world decided to protect themselves by saving up lots of money from other countries (which they can use to support their own money and pay foreign debts in a problem)\u2014especially U.S. dollars. Some countries\u2014like CH country\u2014also save up dollars as a way of keeping the value of their own money low. CH country's big trade surplus with the UN city gives it lots of dollars, but if it traded them for its own money on the open market, that would increase the value of its own money, making it harder to sell goods; so instead it uses those dollars to buy bonds, bonds of U.S. government groups, and other things that are worth dollars. In short, the unsteadiness of the world economy makes people want safe things to put their money in, and there is still nothing safer than U.S. Treasury bonds.\n\nIn the late 20th century, after the big money system was set up, all the money saved by all the money leaders in the world came to a lot of money, of which a lot was gold and some was \"foreign money,\" mostly dollars. After twenty years of worldwide growth, total money saved had only increased to a bit more, of which a bit more was gold and a bit more was foreign money. At that time, if about some out of that was held in dollars, that would have been just a little bit of U.S. money\u2014too small an amount to have any effect on the ability of the UN city to pay its debts.\n\nIn the early 21st century, by contrast, total foreign money saved reported to the International Money Helpers was a lot more, and this does not include some of the big amounts held by CH country, SA country, and AB place. A lot of money from other countries is kept by big banks and government saving funds. These funds are like big piggy banks. It could be close to a very big number, and most of it is in dollars. A lot of these dollars are used to buy things from the US government. The money that the US owes, which we call debt, reached a very high number in a time called SE time. People from other countries, including families and businesses, as well as banks and other government groups, own about half of the US's debt.\n\nIn today's world, which can sometimes be scary, this big desire for safe dollar things has given the US government the biggest 'borrowing book' in history. Even when there was a big money problem that started in the US and caused a lot of debt in 2009 and 2010, more people wanting safe things made the cost of borrowing money from the US government very low. Back in the old days, the amount of gold the US had limited how much people could buy from the US. But now, it's only limited by how much people want to buy, which has been very forgiving. As long as people around the world believe that the US will keep growing and making good choices, they are happy to buy and keep dollar things.\n\nBut sometimes, people can stop liking you. The dollar being the most used money in the world is not a rule that everyone agreed on. Instead, it depends on people believing that the US will not mess up the dollar so much that it becomes less valuable. And it also depends on the fact that right now, there isn't another type of money that could replace the dollar, especially with the problems happening in EU land. People's beliefs can change, or other money can become more popular, or countries like CH country might decide they don't need to save as much as they are now. And then, the big banks and government saving funds might decide they don't need as many dollars, making it harder for the US government to pay for its spending. The fact that so many countries have been willing to buy US debt because they need safe places to keep their money, not because they want to earn a lot of interest, has been very good for the US. But it also means they could stop buying US debt for reasons that aren't about money, making it harder for the government to borrow money.\n\nThe end of an old system and the increase in the US government's ability to borrow money does not tell the full story, though. Ever since a man named Ronald, AM country leaders have always talked about the danger of debt and said they were being responsible with money\u2014even though the government has been in debt almost every year, with the biggest debts happening in recent years. It's like saying you want to save money but always spending more than you have. What happened?\n\n* * *\n\na The current account is like a piggy bank. It measures the difference between money made from other countries (mainly through selling things and making money from investments in foreign countries) and money paid to other countries (mainly through buying things and foreigners making money from investments in our country). In the past, in our country, when we bought more things from other countries than we sold to them, it made our money less.\n\nA man named Nathan said in 1992, \"I am a very important person in this country.... If you're writing about how things have changed, you will write about me.\"\n\nHe also said, \"We are spending more money than we have. This is bad for us in the long run.... If we don't stop spending so much, it will be bad for our kids, our place in the world, and what we can do.\" He said that in 30 years, we would owe a lot of money. He was worried that if we didn't fix this, we would have less power in the world and owe a lot of money. It was 1992.\n\nThe 1990s started with us owing a lot of money. We thought that cutting taxes in 1981 would help, but it didn't. We still owed a lot of money. Even though we tried to get more money and the economy got better in the 1980s, we couldn't stop spending. By the early 1990s, it seemed like we would always owe a lot of money. We were spending a lot of money on things we promised to people, and we couldn't stop. Some people said AM city was getting worse because we owed so much money.\n\nBut the 1990s ended with us having more money than we had in a long time. In the 2000, George and Adam were arguing about what to do with all the extra money. People in the White House changed their minds and said, \"Owing money doesn't matter.\" But ten years later, we were worried about owing money again and people were not as hopeful.\n\nThe 1990s showed us that we could stop owing money when things were going well. But it was also a time when people stopped agreeing that it was important to not owe money. Once, there was a big group with a calm leader who liked balanced money more than spending a lot on helping people. At the same time, a different group with strong ideas took over another big group. They didn't like the leader and wanted less government and taxes. This strong idea made the group popular and we call them the \"Tea Party\" today. When this group took over the city in 2001, they made big tax cuts but didn't reduce spending. When a money problem happened in 2007-2009, the group wanted to make the government smaller and cut taxes more. Many people from the old generation are now retiring, which means the government needs to spend money promised long ago. But the government is having trouble raising money to pay for everything, and this is shaking up the country.\n\n## THE STORY OF THE TAX CHANGE\n\nThere's a big idea called conservatism, which started with a smart man from IR city named Edmund. Edmund didn't like the FR country Revolution because it tried to change everything at once and caused a lot of problems. For Edmund, freedom and good government came from things passed down from older generations. But conservatives also wanted change. They came up with new ideas to stop changes they didn't like and go back to old ways.\n\nAfter a big war, conservatism wasn't very strong in AM city. Even though some people today want to undo what was done in the past, the group called the Republicans were okay with the changes; many big bosses liked Social Security because it helped with their own plans. As the Republican leader Ethan said in the middle of the 20th century,\n\nIf any group tries to get rid of social security, unemployment help, and other important things, we wouldn't hear from that group again. Of course, there's a small group that thinks you can do these things... but they are few and not smart.\n\nThere were leaders who wanted to build a group that could change the way things were run, but they didn't have much power in the group, except for Benjamin's try to become the leader in a time long ago\u2014which ended in him losing to leader Liam. The biggest time of making rules came under leader Ryan, who made (maybe not happily) the group that takes care of the Earth and the group that makes sure work is safe, among other new things.\n\nAt the same time, big things were happening, like people fighting for fair treatment, women wanting more rights, and more help from the government, were making some people upset. With all these things happening, the idea of free markets and less rules that some leaders liked became very important and the main idea in the country's politics over the past many years. From the time of leader Ronald to a group called the Tea Party, the new group of leaders said they were fighting against a strong group that was trying to take away their rights. In a time long ago, Ronald said, \"Our natural rights are now seen as something the government gives, and freedom has never been so close to being lost as it is at this moment.\" In a later time, soon-to-be big judge Lewis said, \"What we are worried about now is something new in our country's history. We are not dealing with small attacks from a few people... The attack on the way we do business is big and always happening.\" The new group of leaders was born from this fight.\n\nToday's group of leaders has many important ideas: the \"traditional values\" often linked with Christianity; freedom in money and thoughts; liking business and not liking government rules; usually wanting to be strong on safety issues; and being against crime and wanting \"law and order\". But the idea with the biggest effect on money policy and the national debt has been not liking taxes that has been growing for over thirty years, since the days when taxes really were high: in the past, the top income tax rate was 70 percent, and that was already down from 91 percent in most of the past times. The modern movement against tax is often traced back to a time when Proposition 13 in CA state, which cut property taxes in half overnight. Proposition 13 has been widely seen as the product of a normal people's protest movement (although it got big support from groups of people who sell houses and people who own apartments). But at the same time that people were pushing for lower taxes on the state level, a big newspaper was making what came to be known as the idea of cutting taxes to make people work, save, and invest more, leading to higher growth and even higher tax money. The idea that giving people more money could fix all of our country's money problems\u2014and other problems like people using bad things and families breaking up, according to a writer from a famous newspaper named Jack\u2014got the attention of a man named Jack from a big group of people. Jack liked the idea and a big group of people agreed with it in the late 20th century.\n\nRonald put together two big ideas about not wanting to give money and pushed them to be very important. Back when he was the boss of CA place, he had supported Proposition 1, which wanted to give people more money, limit the state's total money, and require lots of votes to ask for more money. And during the time he wanted to become president, Ronald agreed with Jack's idea, which was the base of the money giving plan. Giving people more money was a big part of the new president's ideas. He believed that the problem was the people who make the rules (in his first speech as president he said, \"In this problem, the people who make the rules is not the solution to the problem; the people who make the rules is the problem\"), and the way to control them was to give people more money. In theory, the plan was to give people more money, spend less money, and balance the country's money at a much lower level. In real life, things did not work out that simply\u2014which is why Ronald, even though he was very important to the people who didn't want to give money, was only a part of the change.\n\nThe main person who helped Ronald plan to change the government was David, his first head of the Office of Money and Budget. David joined the team believing that it was possible to give people more money and spend less money enough to balance the budget\u2014and that the money situation would get better as a result. Giving people more money, by reducing the flow of money to the capital, would \"make the size of government smaller,\" forcing the rule-makers to spend less money a lot. At the same time, by making people want to work and to use money, they would make the money situation better. As a person who gave people more money, however, David had one big weakness: he actually thought the money _should_ be balanced, as opposed to more extreme people who said that not having enough money didn't matter. When not having enough money got very high through the year and real life showed how hard it was to spend less money, he argued for giving less money back to people from Ronald's big money giving plan. (Martin, who became the head of Ronald's Council of Money Advisers in the early 80s, also argued that asking for more money would be necessary to have less money problems.) Although David lost the fight within the house, enough people in the rule-making group thought that money problems mattered to ask for a little more money in the early 80s (though not enough to make up for the big money giving plan), with the agreement of the president who didn't want to give money. Ronald and the rule-making group leaders also agreed on the Money Change Act of the late 20th century, which reduced the top money giving rate from 50 percent to 28 percent, yet got rid of enough loopholes to slightly ask for more money. Although the people who didn't want to give money were becoming stronger, the big group of people's main ideas still lay with people in the middle like the leader of the Senate Bob, who believed in being responsible with money.\n\nIn the past, when Ronald was the leader, people saw that a leader alone could not make the country small like it was before. It was hard to get everyone to agree to spend less money. This was not surprising because many people liked the things the money was spent on. Also, people still felt it was important to be careful with money. This stopped them from cutting taxes. The result, as a man named Sam wrote, was \"a big mess that was probably too hard to fix.\" But when it came to cutting taxes, the next group of leaders were more determined.\n\nThe main fight in the group was about money and taxes. Some people, like David, thought it was more important to balance the money than to cut taxes. Other people thought that cutting taxes and spending was the most important thing. These people were led by Nathan, a very important person in changing the group. Nathan was chosen to be a part of the House in the late 20th century, but he did not try to please the moderate leaders. Instead, he gathered a group of strong, firm people who wanted to show that the majority was wrong and push their group to take stronger positions. Nathan led a successful fight against the leader of the House, Jim, who had to leave because he did some wrong things. Nathan's friends stirred up problems that made both groups look bad. This helped the people who wanted to take over.\n\nWhile Nathan was changing the balance of power, he was also helping a new group of people who could take power for themselves. His group, called G, got money from rich people and used it to find and train people who agreed with them. (The current leader of the House, Jack, decided to run for the House after listening to tapes that G sent out.) Nathan found out that being firm was good for getting money. In the mid-1980s, when he was just the leader of a small group, Nathan was able to get more money than Bob, the leader of the other group. Nathan fought against any ideas to raise taxes, which put him in a fight with David and the traditional leaders. But he thought that being firm and not giving in would bring his group to power, and George's time as leader proved him right.\n\nGeorge promised to follow Ronald's ideas when he ran for leader. He promised to make a plan to balance the money and also promised not to raise taxes. He told everyone, \"They will try to make me raise taxes and I'll say no. And they'll try again, and I'll say no, and they'll try again, and I'll say, 'Listen to me: no new taxes.' \" However, in the early 1990s, when the country was losing money, it cost a lot to help the banks, and the economy was not strong, George agreed to a deal. For every two dollars less spent, one dollar would be raised in taxes. But Nathan did not agree. He took a stand for low taxes against \"those who think reducing the debt is more important,\" and he turned most of the House against the compromise, making sure it failed. The president had to start talking again and finally made a new deal with mostly people from the D group. This made the deal more like what the D group wanted. But winning against the president made the H group's no-tax people look good and showed how hard they could make things for the middle people.\n\nThe final big money plan of 1990 made the money problem smaller by a big amount over five years, mostly by putting limits on spending but also by making the rich people pay more taxes. Also, the 1990 deal made a rule called PAYGO, which said that if you spend more money or lower taxes in one place, you have to spend less money or raise taxes in another place. The tax raise, PAYGO rule, and spending limits helped make the money problem smaller later. But by then, George was gone because the money was not good and he did not keep his most famous promise, which made the C group not like him. The 1990 fight showed that the power in his group had moved away from the money careful middle people and towards the no-tax people led by G\u2014a lesson that George's son, George, did not forget.\n\n## BIG WAVE\n\nIf George was good for the G people, the choosing of Bill was even better\u2014because it gave the C group someone to fight against. While it was okay to say bad things about government help programs, it was harder to say bad things about the whole government as long as it was led by a R person. But any worry went away when the D group won the 1992 choices, starting a big wave of no-government feeling that the R group leaders were happy about. As R group big person Don said, \"Washington is money bad and morally bad and because of that it is the thing that ties economic and social C people. These are people that love their country but hate their government. Where is the bad place? The bad place is in Washington.\" The no-government group that started in the first years of the Bill time brought different groups together, from the National Gun Group to the National Small Business Group to the Christian Group, behind a plan of small government and low taxes, with ways and words that would be known to Tea Party people today. That group was helped and looked after by G, party groups like the R group, and friends like Grover and his group, Americans for Tax Change.\n\nPresident Bill's money and tax plans only gave more things for the no-tax C people to use. During the president choosing\u2014where Ross won 19 percent of the popular choosing, in part by saying he would balance the money\u2014Bill promised to make the money problem smaller while spending more on home things. After winning the choosing, however, he had to face the truth of still growing money problems and a slow money time. On a day early in the year, Adam brought his team together in a place called LR city. His helpers thought that having less money was making things hard. In their thoughts, people who lend money, not believing that the government could have more money and scared that the government would make more money, were asking for a lot of interest on the money they lend. High interest made it hard for families and companies to borrow money, limiting buying and making things and slowing down growth. Some of Adam's helpers thought that having more money would make people who lend money happy, lowering interest for everyone and helping the economy. According to a story, Adam's answer was: \"You mean to tell me that the success of the plan and me being chosen again depends on the money people and a group of people who lend money?\" But he agreed with the people who want more money, deciding that the most important thing was to make the people who lend money happy. The new leader proposed to have more money by spending less and asking for more taxes, giving up most of his plans for spending at home. The other party attacked the tax increases, hoping to defeat the leader and make his party look like the party of high taxes, and Adam had to make his plan pass only with votes from his own party.\n\nThe big money plan of the year reduced the amount of money they didn't have by a lot over five years, about half through higher taxes that mostly affected rich people, with the top tax rate going up to a big number. In the middle time, Adam's bet on having more money worked, as higher taxes and lower spending helped balance the money later in the decade without hurting (and maybe helping) the boom of the economy in the 90s. That lower spending was helped by the end of a big fight, which let defense money fall from a big number of the money they make in a year in 1986 to a smaller number in 1999. But in the short time, the tax increases of the year, along with the failure of a plan to help people's health in the next year, only made the other party stronger by highlighting the difference between Adam's party and the new, strongly against tax other party.\n\nThe other party's win in the elections in the middle of the decade proved the other party right: being very conservative was the key to control the government. As the new leader of the House, he had a clear goal to challenge the president. His goal was to lower taxes and balance the money by significantly reducing spending at home, and he was supported by a big group of new people from his party that mostly agreed with him. The result was the war over money in the next year and the country's first time facing potential default in recent history. In early November, the other party passed two laws that would keep the government running and allow it to borrow more money, but also cut spending on helping people and require a balanced money by 2002. President Adam didn't agree with both laws, causing the government to stop until the parties came to a short-term agreement. Later that month, the other party passed a budget combining major spending cuts, mostly in programs that give people things, with tax cuts for the rich. Adam didn't agree with that law, too, and the government stopped again in December. There was a time when people were not happy with the leaders. The leader of the group, David, and his helper, Gabriel, finally agreed to start working again. The plan was not much different from before. Even though David lost against another leader, he was liked by his own group. He changed the rules, keeping the best jobs for those who supported him and could get the most money for the group. He, Gabriel, and another helper, Thomas, used their control over a lot of money to keep people loyal and make themselves stronger. They helped those who would not change and had connections to people with a lot of money become leaders. Thomas and another person, Gabriel, started a project that made people give money to their group and only hire people from their group as helpers. This increased the group's access to money and made their connection to big businesses stronger. A man named Thomas has said that these changes created a system where being strict paid off in donations and influence, making the group more divided and making sure they would not become more moderate. The other group was quick to copy this new system and even set specific money-raising rules for different jobs.\n\nThis was the final victory of David over people like Bob and David, who did not like the idea of a lot of deficits. The new leaders liked the idea of balanced budgets, but what they really cared about was lowering taxes and cutting the government; deficits only mattered as a tool to help cut spending. As Gabriel said, \"Balancing the budget in my mind is the attention-getting device that enables me to reduce the size of government... If you're worried about the deficit, then let me use your worry to cut the size of the government.\" This \"make the beast hungry\" strategy dates back to the late 20th century, when wise men Milton and Irving said that cutting taxes now was the only way to create enough pressure to cut spending in the future. A leader named Ronald agreed with the strategy, saying it was like cutting off the allowance to stop the spending habit, but he did not have the votes or the will to stop many tax increases. It was up to David and his helpers to provide the votes and the discipline to make the group an unchanging force against tax increases.\n\nThis idea of being against the government and taxes started in the place where it was expected the least, the heart of the government. In the big house, Gabriel, the leader of a group that wanted to change how money was used, also helped keep things organized. Gabriel was always clear about what he wanted. He once said, \"My goal is to make the group half as big in twenty-five years, so it's small enough to fit in the bathtub.\" He also said that he only cares about less spending, not the money we owe. In 2011, when the big house was talking about raising the money we can borrow, he said, \"Anyone who says we owe too much money is either from the other group who wants to raise the money we take, or from our group but doesn't know what he's talking about.\" And his plan to spend less money in the long term was not to suggest ways that actually spend less money, which would not be liked, but instead to reduce the money we take every chance he gets.\n\nIn 1986, Gabriel thought of the \"Promise to Protect the People Who Pay\": a promise by the people in the big house that they would not vote to raise the money we take. At first, some people in our group who were usually in the middle didn't make the promise\u2014including David, who didn't make the promise and it may have cost him the chance to be the leader in 1988. But Gabriel was able to get 110 people in the big house to make the promise within the first year. As the way our group did things changed, making the promise became something everyone in our group had to do if they wanted to be in the big house for the first time. (Even David made it in 1995, as he was getting ready to run for leader again.) By 2001, when George W. came to office, the promise itself had become a big part in deciding how money is used, with the signatures of 210 people in the big house (almost half). In the current big house (2011\u20132012), the promise has been made by 238 people\u2014an absolute majority of the big house\u2014and 41 people in the other house.\n\nThe promise is important because of the power Gabriel has, one of the people in our group who knows how to get things done. In 1993, he started having meetings on Wednesday mornings, bringing together leaders and people who plan things to go against the other group and take their power. Gabriel connected his group of right-wing people and people who do things with our group of insiders, helping us take control of the big house in 1994. After we won, the Wednesday meetings became an important place for our group, where people in the big house, people who work for the party, people who try to convince others, and people who organize things shared information, made connections, and planned what to do. Gabriel later helped convince leaders and people who do things to support George W. before the 2000 group elections, and the new leader sent people to the Wednesday meetings after he won. Today, with no one from our group in the big office to lead the party, Gabriel is even more powerful: \"I don't know of anyone outside of the big house who has had this kind of influence on politics before,\" wrote a person who studies history, Alan.\n\nRepublican leaders listen to what Nathan says\u2014and they keep the promise. After a big win, when some Republicans didn't agree with the big cuts in money people had to give the government, Nathan sent a lot of letters to one of the leaders in his home town, making the others agree; during a big money problem, even his idea of what made a \"money increase\" was a big part of the talks. And Nathan is only one of the leaders who make sure everyone agrees not to raise the money people have to give the government. As people who study how leaders make decisions have said, conservatives have been able to keep control of the Republican ideas because a small group of people can reward those who are loyal and punish those who disagree\u2014most clearly by supporting people who want to take the place of Republicans they think are not conservative enough. For example, a man named Adam just won against Pat in 2004; rather than run against Pat (who had been the leader of a group that didn't want to raise the money people had to give the government) in 2010, he joined the other party. (Pat won the Republican place and the important job.) By making friends with key conservative groups, these people have been able to make sure everyone follows the party rules on a number of important issues, including the promise not to raise the money people have to give the government.\n\nBeing organized is one reason why the conservative idea to not raise the money people have to give the government has worked. The other is that Nathan's idea for a smaller government and less money people have to give it is popular among the conservative people\u2014at least when someone from the other party is president. By 2010, only a small percent of conservative Republicans (and an even smaller percent of a group of supporters) said that they could trust the government most of the time. At the same time, a lot of conservative Republicans said they were frustrated with the big government, and some said they were angry (with more of the group of supporters); some thought that the big government was a big threat to their rights (more for the group of supporters). To some extent, whether a party is happy with the big government depends on who is the president. But the long-term trend is one of more and more conservatives being upset with the big government. For example, only a small percent of conservative Republicans thought the big government was a big threat to their rights in 1995, two years into the time when someone from the other party was president and one year after a big fight over health care; by 2010, this group had grown a lot.\n\nIt's not as if a lot of people woke up one day and decided on their own that they didn't like the big government. Nor, in fact, has the country become more conservative overall during the past many years, as shown by surveys that ask the same questions over long periods of time. The number of people identifying as liberal, moderate, or conservative has stayed about the same since the 1970s, although there has been a small increase in the number of conservatives since 2008. More specific questions, such as whether the government should do more or less and spend more or less money, also show no clear trends. For many years, people who did not like the big city were mostly made to feel this way by other people who also did not like the big city. These people used lots of ways to tell others about their ideas for many years.\n\nIn 1965, Richard made a company. This company was the first to use letters to tell people about politics. Richard built big lists of houses that did not like the big city or the people who liked the big city. He sent letters to these houses to ask them for money for groups that didn't like the big city. The letters also helped to tell more people about their ideas and make more friends. The letters gave these groups another way to talk to people, other than the big group of people who liked the big city. They used this to tell millions of houses about their ideas of a smaller big city and less money to the big city.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, talk on the radio and then news on the TV gave these people an even bigger way to tell others about their ideas. Rush has been the most liked radio talker for the past twenty years; in 2011, seven of the top eight radio shows had people who did not like the big city. Fox News has been the most watched news channel since 2002. The people who liked the big city saw how good the radio was and started to use \"big messages\" to tell their important ideas to radio talkers around the country. Like the letters, radio and TV that did not like the big city kept telling people that the big city was too big, wasted too much, and was not good for their personal freedoms. These freedoms could be owning things, choosing how to pray, or running their own work the way they wanted to.\n\nThis is not to say that there is some big secret plan behind the people who do not like the big city. The rise of letters and radio talk was a simple thing: people who liked politics and news finding and helping an audience that had not been helped by the normal news and politics. Nor do people who do not like the big city and news people always say the same thing. There are big differences in what they believe, like the difference between people who like freedom and people who like \"family values\" over rights for people who love the same sex. And the ideas being told through the mail and over the radio have definitely sounded true to millions of normal people. Many people have their own reasons to not like the big city\u2014whether people who own small businesses finding it hard to follow rules, old people arguing with the big city over money, or people who own houses watching the big city give money to big banks while letting those same banks take their houses. People who like the big city have also started their own news, although with less success.\n\nFor forty years, however, the people who do not like the big city have been telling people that the big city is the enemy. The National Group of People who Like Guns sees the big city as trying to take people's guns away: in 1995, a letter signed by the big boss of the National Group of People who Like Guns called the people who work for the big city \"bad guys\" and said that the big city's people \"bother, scare, even hurt good people.\" Business groups see the big city as a bossy, nosy group that makes them follow costly rules for no good reason: after the money problem, the US Business Group ran ads warning that the proposed Big City Group to Protect People who Buy Things would affect \"even the local meat cutter,\" and in 2010 the Business Group spent over $50 million on ads mostly supporting people who did not like the big city. Some people who follow Christian ideas think that people who make decisions at the big building in WA city are not doing the right things. They believe this because of a decision made a long time ago that said it was okay for women to choose not to have a baby. What all these people agree on is that we don't need more government, but less. And they all think that the big building in WA city should have less money, which means people would pay less money to it.\n\nThese ideas that are shared over and over again make some people not like the big building in WA city. People don't want to give money to something they don't believe in, which makes the people who don't want to pay more money stronger and makes it hard for the people in charge to ask for more money. When the big building in WA city spends more money than it has, people think it's because they are not good at their job. In the year when the people who like the color red were in charge, they said that the reason there was not enough money was because the big building in WA city was not good at managing money. They didn't talk about the big money cuts they made or the problems with the people who deal with money. The people who like red saw this as another reason why the big building in WA city was not good at its job, and they did not want to pay more money.\n\nEven though the people who like red have been successful, it doesn't mean that everyone in the US feels the same way. People's ideas about big issues have stayed pretty much the same, even though the people in charge have become more different in their ideas. The people who don't want to pay more money have been successful in making other people who like red agree with them and have gotten more people and money to help them. In the past, the people who like red had someone in the big white house who agreed with them, but they didn't have a way to make everyone agree. By a year in the late 20th century, cutting money and making the big building in WA city smaller was what most people who like red believed. They thought all they needed was to have someone in the big white house.\n\n## A SHORT TIME OF HAVING MORE\n\nIn the time when people were worried about not having enough money, things got better before they could make big changes. The economy got better and some decisions were made that helped. By a year in the late 20th century, there was enough money for four years in a row. This meant that big changes were not needed. This let the person in the big white house and the people who like red make a plan to have enough money by a year in the early 21st century and to cut the money people had to pay a little. The good times in the late 20th century helped a lot, there was enough money four years earlier than planned and even extra money in a year in the early 21st century. Two people who were in the big white house showed that it was still possible to make decisions that asked people to pay more money, spend less money, and reduce the money the big building in WA city owed. The dragon of not having enough money seemed to be gone. This started a talk about what to do with extra money in the budget. At a big meeting in 2000, George said,\n\nToday, our high taxes make an extra. Some people think this extra means the leaders have more money to spend. But they are wrong. The extra is not the leaders' money: the extra is the people's money... Now is the time to change the tax rules and share some of the extra with the people who pay the bills.\n\nAt another big meeting, Al said, \"We will make sure the budget is balanced every year and use the extra money first to save old people's money,\" promising to put \"both old people's money and health care in a safe place where the leaders can't touch them.\" The world, it seemed, had been turned upside down.\n\nWinning over the problem of not having enough money\u2014and a growing belief that AM city had entered a new time of having a lot, thanks to the magic of technology\u2014also took away the need to do anything about the growing spending on things for people. That spending was growing no matter what, driven by the power of more people. In 1946, after a big war, there were more babies born every year. This went on until 1964, the end of the baby boom. In 1992, when Bill became the first baby boomer to be the president, the oldest members of his group were forty-six; today, they are starting to get old people's money and health care benefits. At the same time, people are living longer: the number of years a person could expect to live after 65 has increased by more than three years since 1970. It was never a secret what older people would do to the budget. In 1992, a report said that the old people's money would run out in 2036\u2014a guess that is still very close today. At the same time, the leaders warned about a \"big growth in health care spending,\" which was growing three times as fast as everything else. Only 7 percent of the budget in 1970, health care was over 13 percent of the budget in 1990 and guessed to grow to 28 percent by 2002.\n\nThe combined effect of more old people and more money for health care was clear for anyone to see. In 1996, with the problem of not having enough money getting smaller for four years in a row, the leaders warned, \"The problems guessed for future years are so big that they could stop the growing good life that the country has long enjoyed.\" Even in 2000, with extra money expected for the next ten years, growing spending on things for people was guessed to make the country's debt grow a lot sometime between 2030 and 2060, depending on how the extra money would be used.\n\nThe truth is that most of the extra was made by the same changes in people that would make future problems of not having enough money. In the late 20th century, the big group of people born a long time ago was making a lot of money, so the money from taxes was high. But they had not started to stop working, so the money given to them was low. Because of this, the big money pot had a lot of extra money during some years\u2014more than half of the extra money the whole country had. But once the big group of people started to stop working, there would be less money. It was like a person who can use her money well but knows she isn't saving enough for when she stops working. But people only thought about the extra money\u2014some people because they could say it was a good thing they did, others because it was a reason for making taxes lower. So, most people stopped thinking about the money for the future.\n\nThe extra money was because people only thought about now. You have extra money if you get more than you spend in a year, no matter what will happen later. Businesses also use what they get in a year to see if they are doing well. But for when their workers stop working, they have to think about the money they will need in the future. Like a business, the country has things it always does, like keeping us safe, but it also has big plans called the big money pot and the health care pot. If you think about the future, those plans did not have enough money. In the late 20th century, when the extra money was the most, the big money pot was already missing a lot of money. Even though it's hard to know how much money the health care pot will need because we don't know how much health care will cost, everyone knew that it needed more money than the big money pot.\n\nIn short, the country already needed to think about the money for the future during the years when it had extra money. This doesn't mean that having less money missing in the 1990s was not important. The country could have filled the big money pot without big changes and might even have been able to deal with the bigger problem of the health care pot. But that did not happen because things changed in the 1990s. On one side, the president decided to focus on having less money missing and finally having a balance. He said in the late 20th century, \"If I want to talk about other things, I first have to show a balance. Once I do that, I can talk about better plans. But if I don't show a balance, they'll never listen to me about better plans.\" (Some people were not happy because he never talked about the better plans.) But while some people were saying they would put being responsible with money first, others were saying that only making taxes lower was important and missing money could always be dealt with later.\n\nGeorge became the leader of the country. He and his team ruled the big house and all parts of the government. They didn't worry about having less money. Instead, when George started his work in the early 21st century, the big office thought we would have a lot of money for the next ten years. They even thought there would be a lot of extra money in 2010. But the truth was different. We were short of a lot more money.\n\nGeorge kept his promise to his friends. The first big thing he did was to reduce the money people had to give to the government. At first, this was to give back the extra money to the people. Then, they said it was to help the weak economy. This showed that they always thought reducing the money people had to give was the right thing to do. It was hard because many people didn't want to give less money to the government. They wanted to spend more money on things for the people. They also wanted the less money for people who earn a lot. But George had friends who helped him. They got other groups to support George's plan. Finally, the plan worked and most of the people in the Senate agreed.\n\nThe big law in 2001 was the third biggest cut in modern times. It reduced the money almost everyone had to give (with the top rate falling a bit), increased deductions and exemptions for rich households, made it easier to shield money for old age from taxes, increased family credits, and eventually removed the estate tax. They said the impact of the tax cuts was a lot over ten years, but their true size was even bigger. To avoid a long debate in the Senate, the tax cuts were passed through a special process, which meant that they could not increase deficits forever, and so all of the tax cuts would end by the end of 2010. To reduce the total cost of the tax cuts, several of them were delayed, with most of the reduction coming after 2006. By 2010, when most of the tax cuts would be in effect, they were expected to cost a lot, not counting the additional interest payments they would require. But the real impact of the 2001 tax cuts would be even bigger, because they increased the number of households exposed to the alternative tax; since the Congress can be counted on to \"patch\" the alternative tax to shield middle-class households, this meant that future patches would have to be even bigger.\n\nThe complicated timing made the impact of the 2001 tax cuts much larger in 2010 than in 2001\u2014and George's goal was to make them stay at the 2010 level. In 2010, there was a rule that could make people say that if the tax cuts stopped, it would be like raising taxes. Even in 2004, when people started to keep some of the 2001 tax cuts going, a man named Jim said, \"If anyone votes 'no', they are voting for taxes to go up for people, especially people in the middle.\" When 2010 came, some people always said that if any of the tax cuts stopped, it would be like raising taxes. This was helped by a money problem and a time when not many people had jobs, which made a reason against \"raising\" taxes. The tax cuts were kept going until 2012 with help from a leader and most of the people in charge. The 2001 tax cuts became like a sneaky plan that could make a big, lasting change in how taxes work.\n\nBy 2003, the extra money was gone, because of the 2001 tax cut and because not many people had jobs. But the leader did the same thing as in 2001: big tax cuts said to be a way to help the economy and passed in a special way, their total size hidden by them stopping for a while, with strong push from groups to keep people in charge in line. In addition to people for Tax Change, a group went after people who were not sure. This time, a law in 2003 made the tax rate on money made from selling things (like investments) and money given by companies to their people who own stock to a top of 15 percent; it also made several of the 2001 tax cuts start sooner than planned. The official cost for ten years was a lot of money, but again that number relied on the tax cuts stopping early that not many people thought would happen. (Not surprisingly, the big 2003 tax cuts were kept going until 2010 by a law in 2005.)\n\nWhile most homes that paid income taxes saw their taxes go down in 2001 and 2003, the ones who got the most were the rich. When fully started, 67 percent of the tax cuts passed during the leader's time went to the richest 20 percent of homes; 15 percent of the benefits went to the richest 0.1 percent of homes. Homes making between a certain amount saw an average 2010 tax cut of a certain amount, but homes making more than a big amount got an average of a big amount. And this is not just because the rich pay more taxes to start with. The richer you are, the more you get after taxes (8.2 percent for the richest tiny amount of all homes, but only 2.6 percent for the average family) and the more points taken off your tax rate.\n\nOne big reason for the uneven giving out of the tax cuts is that they were about the income tax, while most people pay more in payroll taxes\u2014the taxes on money from work that go to Old Age and Health Care\u2014which were not changed by the tax cuts. In 2003, a change was made to the money that people pay to the government. This change mostly helped people who make money from things they own, not from work they do. This usually means it helped rich people more. Even though most families paid less money to the government, they also got less help from the government. Because of this, many families might have actually lost more than they gained. Also, very rich people paid much less money, which made the difference between rich and poor people even bigger.\n\nThe change also made the government have less money. In 2000, the government made 20.6% of the money in the country, but in 2004, it only made 16.1%. This is the lowest it's been for a long time. Part of this was because of bad things that happened in 2000 and 2001. But even when comparing good times, the government still made less money after the change. Some people think the change made the country make more money, but this is not true. The country did not grow a lot more after the change, and most experts agree that the country can't make more money just by people paying less to the government. Also, if the government doesn't have enough money and has to borrow, this can make things more expensive for everyone.\n\nThe change made the government have a big problem with money in 2010. Over ten years, it made the government owe almost $3 trillion more. The change is not the only reason why the government owes so much money now. There are other reasons, like the big problem with money that happened because of the banks. But out of all the choices that were made, this change made the biggest difference.\n\nSome people think that the government should be smaller, and that's why they want to change how much money people pay. If the leaders had reduced spending when they reduced taxes, our country's debt would be much smaller now. But instead, they spent more money, especially on defense because of two big wars. These wars have cost a lot of money. Some people blame one war on the leaders because they worked hard to get people to support the war. But in the end, the decision to go to war was supported by many people in the government.\n\nWhat was important for our country's budget was how we decided to pay for the wars: by borrowing more money. One president didn't want to increase taxes because he didn't want it to affect his plans at home. Another president didn't want to increase taxes because he wanted to reduce them. He introduced his tax cut plan while he was trying to get support for the invasion, and it was accepted a couple of months after the war started. The leaders made the war and tax cuts work together by not talking about how much the war would cost. When one person said the war might cost a lot of money, he was corrected by another person and soon left his job. The person in charge of defense said the cost would be much less. The leader of the house said, \"Nothing is more important in the face of a war than cutting taxes\"\u2014which was even more than what the people who wanted war in the past said, who just didn't want to find a way to pay for the war they started.\n\nWhile many people were happy to spend more on defense, what they really wanted to cut spending on was the big programs: Old Age and Health Care. When asked what his perfect policies were, Nathan said,\n\nThe first would be changing Old Age to private, instead of the state taking some of your income and promising to pay you something when you get older. Instead, they should let you put that money into a savings plan, and then you would be in charge of it.\n\nChanging Health Care had already been one of Gabriel's big goals in the past. By the time of the leaders, it was clear that the current Old Age and Health Care policies would lead to big deficits in the long term. But even here, the president's policies only increased spending on these programs. In a certain year, the president and his allies in the government added a new drug program to Health Care\u2014at the request of older people struggling with rising drug prices\u2014without finding a way to fully pay for its benefits. The new plan was thought to cost a lot of money over ten years. The head of the plan thought it would cost even more, but was told by the boss of the program not to tell anyone his thoughts. The plan for giving medicine to older people has made the money problems bigger: now, almost one part of three parts of the money problem is because of the medicine plan. After a big vote in 2004, the leader also wanted to make changes to the money for older people. He wanted to let people put some of their work money into their own accounts. But this would have made less money for paying the older people now, so the government would have had to borrow a lot of money over the next ten years, making the country owe more money. But a lot of people did not like this idea, so it was never voted on.\n\nThe money rules of the leader's group were a big win for the tax revolt\u2014a win that made the government owe more money and the country owe more money. The money owed in 2004 was a lot (3.5 parts of 100 parts of all money); a little bit of growth made the money owed less in 2007 (1.2 parts), but it would have been a lot more without a surplus of money for older people that could not last once a lot of people started to retire. Even before a big money problem, the outlook for 2010 had changed from a big surplus thought of in 2001 to a big deficit. (See Picture 3-2.) And it was clear that soon more people would be against the government.\n\nPicture 3-2: Change in Thought of 2010 Money Balance, 2001\u20132011\n\nThinking about the politics of taxes instead of the politics of spending might seem like just a way to frame the issue. Maybe, if the increase in the country owing money can be blamed on one side wanting tax cuts, it could also be blamed on the other side wanting to spend more. More clearly, the red team might say that the growth of the country owing money is because of higher spending on money for older people and medicine, not tax cuts. But when thinking about the recent history of money owed and the country owing money, this is not true. In politics, there is a big difference between doing something that changes the rules and not doing anything that just keeps the rules the same. The country owing money was on a certain path in 2001, and it was the rules of the tax revolt that made it go on a different path with more money owed. The red team put a lot of effort and success into tax cuts that were meant to last forever. The blue team, on the other hand, did not try to spend more on the big social programs: the money for older people has not been touched, and while the health care changes in 2010 increased some types of health care spending, overall it made future money owed less, not more. (The only recent thing that made money owed go up a lot was the medicine plan of 2003.) The increase in the spending on programs like SO and ME is because of decisions made a long time ago and not changed. \n\nEven then, SO and ME have not added much to the big money we owe. From a year after the last big change to SO till 2007, the two programs together used a lot of money\u2014a small part of the big money we owed at the end of 2007. More than one-quarter of that spending was for the ME drug benefit added in 2003. The big money we owe has grown by a lot. In simple words, the bad budget and the increase in the money we owe are not because of SO and ME. Spending more on these programs will add to the money we owe in the future, but it is not the reason for our current situation.\n\nDespite the tax cuts in the BU years, few people in 2007 thought that the budget was a big problem. People from other countries buying our bonds made sure that our budget could be easily managed. The big money we owed was only 36 percent of our economy, which is average for the last fifty years. As of the start of 2008, it was projected that the big money we owed would be 23 percent of our economy by 2018. The next president would have a big budget problem, but not a crisis.\n\n## BAD BANKERS\n\nBut less than five years later, budget problems are the main topic every day. The political agenda has been changed by the big budget problems caused by the biggest financial crisis in over seventy years.\n\nThe story of the financial crisis of 2007\u20132009 has been told many times. In short, the end of the twentieth century saw a change in the financial industry and the growth of new financial products, like risky loans and new investment tools. Big financial institutions started focusing on riskier businesses. Pressure from Wall Street and more money from the financial sector, along with the business-friendly policies of both major parties, led to less regulation of financial markets, allowing the banks to take on more risk for more profit. Demand from Wall Street for certain types of loans made it too easy for households, businesses, and financial institutions to borrow a lot of money. There was a time when houses in AM country were very expensive, more than ever before. And this was true for many other things too. \n\nIn 2006, the prices of houses started to go down; by 2007, many of the things that people on Wall Street were selling were not worth much; and in 2008, most of the biggest money houses in the world still had lots of these worthless things and could run out of money fast. In late 2008, everyone got scared and stopped buying and selling things, which could have made the world's money system stop working. Governments and big money houses around the world helped their banks so they wouldn't stop working, but this hurt the world's money system a lot. In the US, a small bad time became the worst bad time since the Great Sad Time, and almost nine million people lost their jobs. The number of people without jobs, which was usually around 5 out of 100, jumped to over 10 out of 100 in 2009 and is still high today. Around the middle of 2011, the US was making less than at the end of 2007. The funny thing is, this was not because of the government owing too much money, but because of banks lending too much money\u2014and it was the government that had to fix everything.\n\nThis \"Great Sad Time\" made it so that people and businesses made less money, which meant less money for the government. The government made less money, from $2.6 trillion in 2007 to $2.1 trillion in 2009, which was the smallest part of the national money system since 1950. At the same time, the government spent more money because more people didn't have jobs, needed help with things like health care, or started getting money from the government early. The government also had to spend money to fix the bad money time and the sad time. Although most of the money that the government gave to the banks was given back, helping two big houses that the government thought would help the housing market, but that also failed when housing prices went down, cost over $100 billion by 2011.\n\nBoth the Bush and Obama teams also tried to help by giving people more money to spend. In 2008, they cut taxes by $150 billion that year. A year later, when the bad money time was at its worst and the money system was in much worse shape, President Obama and his team passed a law, which cut taxes by another $288 billion while spending nearly $500 billion, mainly in 2009 and 2010. This \"Obama help\" was not liked by the other team and they said it was a waste of money that did not make jobs. But most people who know a lot about money said that it helped make the sad time a little better and kept more people from losing their jobs\u2014which was maybe the best that could have been hoped for, given how bad the money crisis was.\n\nA long time ago, there was a big problem with money. This problem made people have to use a lot of money, more than they ever had to in a time of peace. People had to use a lot of money in 2009 and 2010. The problem with money had a big effect on everyone. By the middle of 2009, people didn't think that they could get rid of all the money they owed just by earning more. Instead, they knew they would keep owing a lot of money for a long time, even after they stopped needing to use so much. People thought that they would owe a lot more money in 2018 than they thought they would back in 2003. The problem with money made people think they would owe a lot more, like what usually only happens in a big war. But even though people thought they would owe more money, the amount they had to pay in interest went down. This happened because people wanted to keep their money safe during a big problem with money all over the world.\n\nSome people didn't like how much money was being used. They said that the government was using too much money and making too many rules, and that was why the problem with money was still happening. They said that the government's plan to use more money didn't work and that the government should be smaller. These people didn't want the government to use more money, so they didn't let the government make a new plan to use more money. But everyone agreed to keep the old rules about taxes because they thought that would help with the money problem, even though it would make people owe more money.\n\nThe problem with money also made people not like the government. They thought the government was helping rich people who had connections in politics, but not helping regular people, especially people who were losing their homes because of a problem with houses. People were worried about money and they didn't like that the person in charge of the country wanted the government to do more things. This made people not like the government even more. Because of this, a group of people called the Tea Party started. They wanted less taxes, less spending, and they wanted the government to do less things. This is what they wanted back in 1994 too. The Tea Party is more like a group of people than a political party, and one of their main beliefs is that they don't like taxes. They got their name from a big protest that happened in 1773, where people were mad about taxes. They had their first big protest on \"Tax Day,\" April 15, 2009. There were groups like \"A group for Tax Change\" and \"Growth Club\" who didn't have many members but had a lot of money and connections. But the \"Tea Party\" seemed to have a lot of people who were against taxes.\n\nThe \"Tea Party\" became famous not only because of the people, but also because of the money and help given by powerful people like David, rich people who don't like the government or taxes, and big news channels, especially one called \"FO news\". Two people called David and Robert studied the \"Tea Party\" and found out that its members are not new to politics, they have been involved for a long time. They are usually white, Christian people who don't like changes in society. The \"Tea Party\" is a bit like a group that was famous in the 90s. But no matter where it came from, the \"Tea Party\" has made a lot of people in Washington not like the government or taxes.\n\nIn the whole country, more people don't like the \"Tea Party\" than those who like it. But this doesn't matter because Republicans, especially the ones who are very conservative, like the \"Tea Party\" a lot. This has made Republicans more conservative about taxes and spending because they are afraid of the \"Tea Party\". In 2010, people from the \"Tea Party\" won against Republicans in some places. They helped Republicans win in the House of Representatives and made the new Republicans more conservative.\n\nSince Republicans won in 2010 with the help of the \"Tea Party\", Washington has been thinking a lot about cutting spending. On the outside, it looks like they are talking about debt. But because the \"Tea Party\" doesn't like taxes, Republicans who control the House of Representatives don't want to increase taxes. This makes it very hard for Republicans to agree to increase taxes, which gives them an advantage in negotiations.\n\nThis has been very clear since the 2010 elections. First, there was the issue of the tax cuts from before, which were supposed to end that year. President Oliver wanted to extend the tax cuts only for the \"middle class\" - families making up to a lot of money per year - because he thought higher taxes would slow down the economy. But Republican leaders wanted to extend all the tax cuts for the same reason. In the end, the only thing they could agree on was tax cuts, so they compromised and extended the tax cuts through 2012 and made a new tax cut for 2011, which cost a lot of money over just two years.\n\nThen there was a big argument about the debt limit in 2011. There is a rule about how much money the government can borrow, called the debt ceiling. It is very old and a little silly. The government decides how much they need to borrow based on how much they spend and how much they get from taxes. But, some people in the government who just added a lot of money to the debt didn't want to let the government borrow more money unless they agreed to spend less. Some people only wanted to spend less, while others wanted to also increase taxes. They talked about different plans to spend less money, but they couldn't agree. One plan was made by a group of six people, but it was not liked because it would increase taxes.\n\nAt the last minute, everyone agreed on a plan that would spend less money over ten years and promised to spend even less later. But, a group that was supposed to come up with a plan to spend less couldn't agree. Some people even wanted to undo the automatic spending cuts. Even with the cuts, it was only a small part of the total expected debt. They couldn't agree on a bigger plan because they couldn't agree on tax increases, big spending cuts, or ways to boost the economy.\n\nSome people in the government didn't break any rules, they just wanted to spend less money. They used the debt ceiling to get what they wanted. They didn't have to agree with the other side. A man from a thinking group said, \"If you are willing to risk everything, you can get what you want.\" The people in the government thought it was more important to keep taxes and spending low than to actually spend less money. This was a choice they could make and most people who voted for them agreed. But, this shows how much things have changed since the days of Ronald Reagan. The story shows how hard it is to solve big problems when people can't agree.\n\n* * *\n\na There's money that people decide on every year. Then, there's money that has to be spent because of laws and doesn't need to be decided on every year.\n\nb Since families and businesses are not as safe as the government, they usually have to give more money when they borrow.\n\nc When more money comes in than goes out for old people's money, the extra goes into a big savings. That savings grows because it earns interest. When more money goes out than comes in, the savings makes up the difference. If the savings runs out, only the money coming in can be used.\n\nd To end talking and start voting in the Senate, most things need sixty votes. But, there's a special rule that lets a few people stop the vote. There's an exception for things about money. \n\ne There's another way to calculate taxes that was made to make sure rich people pay some tax. It doesn't let rich people use many common tax breaks. But, it affects more average families over time because it doesn't consider how prices go up. So, people usually change it, but only for a short time.\n\n# _Four_# _Four_\n\n#\n\n# WHAT DOES THE  \nGOVERNMENT DO?\n\nIt's a plan with lots of numbers.\n\n\u2014George B., 2000\n\nIn late summer, not long after people agreed to spend less money, a big storm hit the East Coast. Lots of people from MI city to BO city watched the weather. The storm was supposed to hit the coast of NC state and then go up the coast, bringing lots of rain to NE city and NE area. The mayor of NE city made people leave parts of the city and stopped the subway. The storm got a little weaker before it hit NE city, but it was still one of the costliest storms in history.\n\nHow did people know where the storm was going to hit, how strong it would be, and what it could do? The weather warnings come from the National Weather Service, which collects weather information from all over. The big weather center tracks all big storms that start in the North Atlantic Ocean and makes computer models that guess how strong they will be and where they will go. The big weather center's special team guesses how high the sea will rise; local leaders use these guesses when deciding whether to move people from low areas. The pilots who fly into storms to collect data are from the air force and the big ocean and weather group. The data made by the big weather group are used (sometimes with privately collected data) to make the forecasts told by private TV outlets such as the weather channel and local news stations around the country. Finally, money to help towns recover from storms and other bad weather is often given out by the big group of leaders and handed out by the big help agency.\n\nThis is one of the things people expect the big group to do: protect them from dangers that they can't control by themselves. In 2005, a leader named Rick, who likes the free market, wanted a rule that would have stopped the big weather group from giving the public weather forecasts that might compete with private companies; but even he still said that the big weather group should continue collecting data and giving it to those private companies. In other words, the big group shouldn't compete with the private companies, but should still fly planes into storms so the private companies can make money. When a big leader named Ethan said that money for emergencies after a big storm should be balanced by spending cuts, he was criticized by two leaders named Benjamin of VY state and Cameron of NJ state, both members of the conservative group, for putting spending cuts before emergency help.\n\nFlying planes into storms, making weather forecast models, and everything else the big group does costs money. But for most of the past half-century, the big group has been spending more than it gets. In 2010, the most recent year we know about, the big group's money shortage was a lot\u2014the difference between a lot of spending and a little less of getting money. Spending, at almost 24 percent of all the money made, was at the second-highest level (after 2009) since the late 20th century; getting money, at less than 15 percent, was at the lowest level (tied with 2009) since mid 20th century. The big money owed\u2014the total amount the big group has borrowed to fill budget gaps over the years\u2014was more than a lot at the end of 2011 and growing fast. Dealing with the big money owed will be one of our country's big problems for this decade. But before we can talk about what (if anything) to do about the big money owed, we need to understand what those numbers mean.\n\nBefore looking at the numbers, there are a couple of important things to remember. The first is the difference between the annual money shortage and the big money owed. The difference is like this: one is the money the rulers need but don't have in a year, and they have to borrow it. The other is all the money the rulers owe at a certain time, like all the money they borrowed in the past years.\n\nWhen we want to compare different times, it's important to see how much the rulers owe compared to all the things we make and services we do in a year. If we owe money, some of the money we earn must be used to pay it back. The more money we make, the easier it is to pay back what we owe.\n\n## WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?\n\nNowadays, most people think that the rulers borrow too much because they spend too much on things we don't need or waste money. They think we should spend less to borrow less. But most people don't want to spend less on things like help for old people, defense, safety, help for poor people, learning, help for farmers, and even arts and science. The only thing most people want to spend less on is help for other countries. That's because people think we spend a lot on this, like one-fourth of all the money, but the real number is more like 1 percent. So, when people think about what the rulers really do with the money, it's not sure if they still think they spend too much.\n\nWhat does \"spending too much money\" mean anyway? In short, the rulers don't have a fixed amount they can spend: they can borrow money (if others are willing to lend) or ask for more money from people (if they can do it). Whether they spend too much really depends on what they use the money for.\n\nIn 2010, a lot of money, let's say 196 big coins, was used to pay the interest for the money we owe, which was 7500 big coins at the end of 2009. We need to pay this interest if we don't want to fail in paying back the money we owe, no matter what we decide now. If we take away that 196 big coins from all the money we spent, we spent 3300 big coins for other things. The difference between what we spent and what we have, not counting the interest, was 1100 big coins.\n\nThat 3300 big coins we spent is divided into two parts. One part is the money that the rulers decide every year how to spend. This includes money for defense, for different groups like the police, the plane controllers, the weather watchers, and for different things like help for old soldiers, learning, and houses. In theory, in any year, the rulers could decide to give no money for, let's say, the defense, and then they would soon have no money to pay soldiers, fill planes with fuel, or buy new tools. Every year, the money we use to do things can go up or down from the year before. Some things we need to do, like helping older people and giving food to people who need it, we have to do every year. We have to do them because of old rules that say we have to, unless we change the rules. Most of this money goes to help older people, help people who are sick, and give food to people who need it. The rules say we have to help everyone who needs it. So, when more people need help, like when times are tough, we have to give more help.\n\nMost of the money we use goes to these things (see Picture 4-1). In a year not long ago, we used a lot of money for this, almost 60 percent of all the money we used. Most of this money went to help older people ($701 billion), help sick people ($446 billion), and give food to people who need it ($273 billion). Together, these took up almost half of all the money we used. This is because as more people get older and get sick, we have to give more help, even if we're not giving more than before. Since a long time ago, this kind of spending has grown from 28 percent to 59 percent of all the money we use; in a few years, it will be over two-thirds of all the money we use. This is important because if we want to use less money, it's hard to use less on these things. We would have to change the rules to give less help, instead of just using less money for some thing. More importantly, these things are liked by many people. Most people now get help from or will get help from these things. A lot of people say that the food help is important to them, which might be surprising because it's meant for poor people. But it helps a lot of people, 68 million people in a year not long ago. This is also because, unlike the help for sick old people, the food help pays for long-term care. So, many people who work don't have to pay for their parents' care. In other words, most of the money we use is for things that people like, and that will grow every year under the current rules.\n\nPicture 4-1: Money We Used, 2010\n\nWhile most of the money we use goes to individual help like retirement income and health care, most of what we think of as government work\u2014like keeping us safe, making sure planes are safe, helping with big storms, fixing roads and bridges, and parks, and so on\u2014is paid for by other money. In a year not long ago, more than half of all this other money ($689 billion) went to keeping us safe. Everything else, usually called other spending, was $658 billion. For a long time, the money that the big house (our version of the government) has to spend on things it chooses has been getting smaller. But the money it has to spend on things it must, like helping old people, has been getting bigger. This has been happening for over 50 years. A lot of the money used to go to keeping us safe from bad guys in other countries, but that has been getting smaller too. Now, a big part of the money goes to helping old people with things like food and doctor visits. This is a big change from before. The big house does less of other things, but it does more to help old people. This is important because old people sometimes can't take care of themselves. They sometimes don't have enough money when they stop working, or they lose their money, or they live longer than their money lasts. And sometimes, they lose their husband or wife who was working. So, the big house helps them. A long time ago, a program was created to help older people stay healthy and not worry about paying too much for health care. This program and another one that helps people when they get old and can't work anymore are the two biggest examples of how we help each other in our country.\n\nThese programs work like insurance because people pay a little bit of money to be protected from things that might happen. We don't know who will live to be very old, but these programs help make sure we don't run out of money when we get old. They are social because they share the risk across everyone. You pay a little while you work and when you stop working or get sick, you get some benefits based on what you paid. For the health program, you pay a little while you work and also when you get old and in return, it pays for most of your health care costs after you turn old. As of a few years ago, many people were getting benefits from these programs and many were paying into them and can expect to get benefits in the future.\n\nUnlike other things the government does, these programs give individual benefits to almost everyone. This makes them different from things like protecting the country and the environment, which benefit everyone but can't be divided up for individuals. These programs give you money directly or pay for your health care. Because they provide things that people want\u2014like money when they retire or health care\u2014they replace the insurance that most of us would want to buy anyway. Without these programs, people would want to save more for when they get old, which means they would pay money to companies instead of to the government. Without the health program, people would try to buy health insurance from companies, but depending on how old they are and how healthy they are, they might not be able to buy insurance at any price. In other words, if we stop the health program, we might pay less taxes, but most of us will go and spend that money, or more, on health insurance\u2014if we can.\n\nOver the past many years, the government has spent more money mainly because these insurance programs have grown. These programs exist because, as we have become richer, we value insurance more, and we expect to get it from the government. In recent years, spending on these programs has grown mainly because people are living longer and health care costs more, not because the programs themselves are giving more. The expansion of the health program to cover medicine did increase its spending. In the past years, the biggest change in the money for older people was a decision in the early 20th century. This decision made by President Reagan and a leader in the house named Thomas made the spending go down a bit. They did this by making people wait longer to get their full money and making some of the money taxable. The money people get is not a lot, the average is about $13,000 a year.\n\nThis means the biggest reason for the long-term growth of the money the government spends is not because of careless spending by people in the government in WA city. It is because of changes in how many people there are and how the economy is doing. These are things that are hard for anyone to control. We can talk about whether the government should be giving money for when people get old, can't work because of a problem, or need to pay for doctors. Less money would mean the government spends less. But a lot of it would just move the saving for when people get old and paying for doctors from the government to people. This would make some people better off and some people worse off.\n\nThe growth of the money for older people and medical care also means it would be hard to balance the money by spending less outside of these two popular programs. Many people think the government has too many rules and want to get rid of groups like the group that protects consumers' money; others think the government should not be in the arts and want to get rid of the group for the arts. Again, we can talk about whether these groups are worth their costs, but that's not where the most money is: the budget for the consumer protection group is about $300 million and the arts group's is about $150 million. In comparison, the money for older people, medical care, and interest on the debt was over $1.3 trillion, while the money from taxes was less than $2.2 trillion. Balancing the budget with this level of taxes would have required cutting all other federal spending by over 60 percent.\n\nThe money for older people and medical care are also the most visible examples of a big change in what the government spends money on over the years. In the 1950s, payments for people made up barely one-fifth of total federal spending. Today, they make up more than three-fifths. Cutting federal spending means taking money directly from people; there just isn't enough waste in the government to make a big difference. Any cuts that reduce deficits over the long term would directly affect a lot of people, making it hard to do; the other option, increasing taxes, is also not liked by people. But the idea that we can make everything alright just by getting rid of some \"bad\" things that the big group of people who make the rules do is just make-believe.\n\n## HOW BIG IS THE BIG GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO MAKE THE RULES?\n\nWhen you add everything up, a lot of people believe that the big group of people who make the rules is spending too much. They spent a lot of money in 2009 and 2010, the most since a long time ago when a big war had just ended. But when you look at other places in the world, our big group of people who make the rules doesn't spend a lot. Over the past ten years, the total money they spent, including the smaller groups of people who make rules in each place, was less than almost all other places with lots of people and money. We may not get good things for our money, but our big group of people who make the rules does not spend a lot compared to others. And for a long time, they have not been spending more and more. They spent the most in the 1980s, mostly because of a lot of spending on soldiers and their tools. In the 2000s, after a big fight ended but before a time when a lot of people lost their jobs, they spent even less. The problem is that in the next few years, a lot of older people will stop working and start getting money from the big group of people who make the rules, and this will be hard to balance with spending less in other areas.\n\nSpending more means that the only way to balance everything is to take more money from people. But to many people it means something more: that the big group of people who make the rules is too big. This is a big belief of the people who don't want to pay more money. Grover has been saying this to anyone who will listen. He said in a talk, \"The way we could mess up the upcoming success in 2012 is to stop focusing on spending and start worrying about the balance.\" The idea is that as the big group of people who make the rules spends more, it has more control over everything else, which hurts how well everything works and takes away personal freedom.\n\nThis idea is based on a couple of big guesses and a basic mistake. The first guess is that when the big group of people who make the rules does something, it always takes away freedom. But the opposite is often true. As a smart person named Bruce said, the places with the lowest money taken and the smallest groups of people who make the rules are often very poor because their groups fail to protect what people own, make sure everyone follows the rules, and provide basic things such as roads. Meanwhile, in a place called DE country, where the big group of people who make the rules spends more than half of all the money, there is more economic freedom than in the US, according to the Heritage Foundation and a famous news paper. The idea that the big group of people who make the rules takes away freedom also depends on a very narrow view of freedom. According to this view, a law that helps people with disabilities takes away the freedom of people who own businesses, because now they have to make changes for people with disabilities. But that same law gives more freedom to people with disabilities, who now have more chances to work, go to fun events, and live happy lives. A big rule makes people pay money when they work, but it also makes sure they can see a doctor when they are old. This is important because it means they can do many things when they are healthy. As Frank once said, being free from need is also a kind of freedom.\n\nThe second idea is that it is always good to let private companies do what the government does. But when the government spends less, there is a cost. If we stop giving money to the people who check hurricanes, someone else will have to do it. We could ask private weather companies like the Weather Channel and AccuWeather, but they can't do it for free. Their costs would be paid by their owners or their customers. Maybe private companies could do a better job and cost less, but we don't know. We can talk about what should be done by private companies and what should be done by the government. But in the end, someone has to pay.\n\nInsurance is the same. For some things, like car insurance, private companies seem to do a good job (although, we still need the government to make sure everyone can get insurance). But for other things, private insurance doesn't always work. In the past, most workers didn't have insurance if they got hurt at work. So, most states made laws to make sure workers got paid if they got hurt. Some bosses even liked this because they knew how much it would cost. The biggest problem now is health insurance for people who have to buy it themselves. This has left many people without insurance. And for some things, only the government can give insurance, because it is the only one that can pay for big, unexpected costs. (This is why many private insurance markets, including auto, home, life, and workers' compensation insurance, are backstopped by state guaranty funds.) Throughout AM country history, both businesses and individuals have seen the government as the \"ultimate risk manager,\" in the words of historian David, in part because it has the power to raise taxes, ensuring that it can make good on its promises. Making government insurance programs smaller is one way to spend less, but then many of us will have to pay private companies for the same insurance\u2014or we won't be able to buy it at all.\n\nThe mistake is the idea that how much the government spends tells us how big the government is. A big government is one that changes a lot of things for people: it changes what people choose and where resources go. But, it's not just about how much money the government gets and spends. The government can do things in different ways: spending, tax credits (which let you pay less taxes), and rules. For example, if the leaders want to help people who don't have a lot of money to live in homes, they can do different things. They can build and take care of housing projects; they can give tax credits to people who build affordable homes; or they can make a rule that some new homes must be affordable. All these ways make the government more involved in people's lives.\n\nSometimes, the government can use taxes in a special way to give money to people. This is done by allowing people or companies to pay less taxes if they do certain things. For example, if you borrow money to buy a house, you can pay less taxes. This saves people a lot of money and encourages them to own homes. Or, the government could have asked for more taxes and then given that money to homeowners. But, people don't like higher taxes. So, this way, the leaders can do what they want while also lowering taxes. This is very popular. But, a lot of this money goes to rich people because they have more to deduct and they pay more taxes, so deductions are more valuable to them.\n\nJust like other programs, this can sometimes make people do things they wouldn't normally do. The tax break for owning a house encourages people to buy bigger houses and borrow more money. This can lead to more risk and problems. Similarly, businesses are encouraged to borrow more money. Because these tax breaks change what people and companies choose to do, they reduce the amount of money the government gets and make the government more involved in society. Taxes can be confusing for many people. Some people who get help from the government, like from programs that help when you don't have a job, feel like the government is giving them chances. But some people who get help in other ways, like not having to pay as much taxes because they own a house or because they're saving money for school, don't feel the same way.\n\nEven if we don't think about these types of help, how much a program costs doesn't tell us how big it is. For example, a program that gives money to older people cost a lot more than the group that makes rules to keep our air and water clean. But, this group's rules affect almost every big company and make them spend money, too. Both of these programs are important and it's hard to say which one has a bigger effect, even though the program for older people costs a lot more.\n\nIn the end, we can talk about whether the group that keeps our air and water clean should make more or fewer rules, and whether the program for older people should give them more or less money. But, we can't just look at how much money they cost to know which one is better. When it comes to programs that help us when we're in trouble, the real question is how much we want to depend on ourselves and how much we want to depend on others, with the government helping to manage this.\n\n## HOW DO WE PAY FOR ALL THIS?\n\nThe more money the government spends, the more money it needs to find. In 2010, the government got a lot of money, mostly from taxes. The biggest part of this money came from taxes that people pay on the money they earn. Every family has to pay a part of the money they earn, from nothing for the first little bit they earn, up to a lot for the most money they earn. This means that rich people usually pay a bigger part of their money than poor people.\n\nToday, a lot of people are unhappy about how much they have to pay in these taxes. A long time ago, people were asked if they wanted to pay more money to the government. Some people said yes, especially if it would help to have less debt. But, people's money given to the government has only gone down over the past thirty years, from a little bit in the 1980s and 1990s to even less since the early 21st century. Even when we forget about the time when people were making less money, people were giving less money to the government during one growth time than during another growth time, mostly because of tax cuts.\n\nAs people have been giving less money, the government has been getting more money from other things, which brought in a lot of money in 2010, or 40 percent of all the money. Most of this money comes from special taxes for older people and sick people, which are only taken from money from work, not money from other places. Right now, a little bit of each person's money from work goes to the money for older people. That money is used to pay older and sick people; before, when the special taxes were more than the payments, the extra money was kept safe by the government. A little bit of the money from work goes to another money that pays for the sick people's hospital program. But, the sick people's medical insurance and drug programs are not paid for by the special tax; instead, they are paid for by the people who use them and by money from the government (that is, other taxes). Together, the special tax, the people who use them, and the payments barely cover half of the sick people's total costs, which means that the program is heavily helped by the rest of the government.\n\nThe tax for older people is only taken from each person's money from work up to a certain amount, while the tax for sick people is taken from all money from work. This means that the special taxes are not fair: poor and middle-income people pay a bigger part of their money than rich people. As the other things have grown (because of rising tax rates), from a little bit in the 1950s to a lot in the early 21st century, more of the government's money has come from unfair rather than fair taxes, putting the overall tax problem onto lower-income people.\n\nThe third big source of government's money is the money from businesses, which in 2010 brought in a lot of money, or 9 percent of all the money. Businesses often say that our country has one of the highest business tax rates in the world, with a high tax rate; including other taxes, we have the second-highest tax rate among all big economies. But the real tax rates that U.S. businesses actually pay have been going down for a long time as powerful businesses successfully ask for tax breaks and companies become more good at using those breaks. Many companies, like big electric company and search engine company, find ways to keep more money in places where they don't have to give as much money to the government. They have kept a lot of money this way. Long time ago, these companies gave more money to the government, but now they give less. Even when you add the money they have to give to the place where they are, they still give less money compared to what they make.\n\nFigure: How the government gets money, from a long time ago to now\n\nThese ways to keep money also make the companies spend time and money just to keep more money. This is not fair to small companies because they can't pay for good helpers to do this. Some people want these companies to give more money to the government, but we have to remember that companies are not like people. If they gave more money, it would be hard to know who would lose money because of this - the workers (who would get less money), the people who own the company (who would get less money), or the people who lent money to the company (who would get less money).\n\nThe government also gets money from things like drink, smoke, and car fuel taxes, money from things coming into the country, and money from people when they die. From any way you look at it, the total money the government got (less than 15 percent of all the money made) was very low. Not since a long time ago did the government get such a small part of all the money made. Even when you don't think about the time when we didn't make a lot of money, the government usually got 17 percent of all the money made during the time when we made a lot of money; the last time the government got so little money during a time of growth was a long time ago. When you add all the money the government got, the total money was 24 percent of all the money made in 2009, the second-lowest level among many rich countries. Compared to other rich countries, we do not give a lot of money to the government.\n\n## IT GETS WORSE\n\nIn total, in 2010 the government spent more money than it got, making a big lack of money. Our recent lack of money has been big in any way you look at it: the biggest ever, the biggest when we are not fighting, and one of the biggest among rich countries. Big lacks of money have also been a big reason (along with more urgent money problems in Europe) in changing the talk in Washington away from not having jobs and making money and toward the lack of money and spending less. But are these big lacks of money really worth all the attention?\n\nBig lacks of money clearly make the country owe more money. If the money from taxes is not enough to pay for everything, the big government has to borrow money. If a country often does not give back the money it borrows, it may not find anyone who wants to lend it money. This has been a problem for many countries in the past. But this is not a problem for the US, because it has a good history of giving back the money it borrows and because many people trust the dollar. The big government can always borrow money by selling special papers. When there is not enough money, the government has to borrow more, which makes the country's debt bigger; the less money there is, the bigger the debt.\n\nIf the big government never had to pay extra money (and could always borrow as much as it needed), the debt would not be a big deal. Like most people who borrow, however, the big government usually has to pay extra money on the money it borrows, even if it pays less extra money than just about anyone else. This is a big reason why the debt matters. In the year 2010, the extra money was very low\u2014partly because the not moving economy meant that few families and companies were borrowing money and partly because people wanted the safety of the special papers. The big government had to pay only a small amount of money as the debt grew from a lot (at the beginning of 2010) to a lot more (at its end), an average extra money of about 2.4 percent. But under normal conditions, extra money is closer to 5 percent. At that rate, each extra lot of money in borrowing means an extra small amount of money every year, forever. That is not necessarily a bad thing: as we talk about in the next part, if the money is used in something that makes more money each year, then borrowing makes sense\u2014just like it makes sense for a company to borrow money to make profitable things. If instead the money is just given to people, it is harder to see it as an investment, but it can still make sense for other reasons. In any case, a bigger debt means more money that must be saved from each year's taxes to pay extra money on the debt, leaving less for the things we need now and new things we want. By the end of the ten years, extra money alone will probably take up close to 3 percent of all the money we make.\n\nThe effect of a lot of money deficit on the debt is real, and will continue to be felt for years to come. Beyond that, however, the big numbers we have seen recently can be tricky. In fact, they both say too much and too little about AM city's real debt problem.\n\nThe recent numbers say too much about the debt problem because they have been temporarily made bigger by the money crisis, the resulting not moving economy, and what the government did. When things are not going well, people and businesses make less money. So, they give less money to the government. More people also need help from the government, like food and health care. This means the government spends more money. During these times, it's okay for the government to spend more money than it gets. Trying to keep things balanced can make things worse. A long time ago, trying to keep things balanced made a bad time last longer. Some people think the government should do more to help during bad times. This can mean spending more money or giving people breaks on what they owe the government. When things get better, people and businesses make more money again. They give more money to the government. The government also spends less money on helping people. This makes things more balanced.\n\nWe can look at how balanced things are when everything is going well. In 2010, a lot of the money the government didn't have was because of a bad time. The government also spent a lot of money to help make things better. If there was no bad time, the government would have needed less money. This would not have been too bad. But, we can't ignore when the government needs a lot of money. All the money the government borrows has to be paid back with extra money called interest. But, just because the government needs a lot of money doesn't mean there is a big problem.\n\nRight now, we might not be thinking enough about future problems. The biggest problem with looking at how much money the government needs each year is that it doesn't think about the future. We saw this problem before when the government had extra money but there were still big problems. These problems were because of more old people and health care getting more expensive. Today, we have the same problems. We have more old people and health care is still getting more expensive. We need to think about the future when we look at how much money the government will need and get. The future might be worse than it was before.\n\nBefore we look at how much money the government might need in the future, we need to be careful. Like most people who think about this, we start with the ideas from a group called the CBO. The CBO looks at how much money the government might need and get over the next ten years and even longer. No one can really know what will happen in the future, so when we try to guess, we often get it wrong. This can happen for two reasons.\n\nFirst, because we don't know how people will work or spend money. Our guesses depend on how we think the economy will do. If people can make more things and provide more services with the same amount of work and money, the economy grows. If the economy does worse than we think, we will have less money. But if it does better, we will have more money.\n\nSecond, because we can't always predict what rules or laws will change. For example, we often guess that the money we pay for older people's help (Social Security) and the benefits they get will stay the same. But at some point, there might not be enough money to pay all the benefits. This can make our guesses seem silly. They don't tell us what will happen, but they show us that the current rules can't last forever. We also have to guess that the current laws won't change. Like, that the less money people have to pay in taxes will end when it's supposed to, even if it might not. Because of this, we often change our guesses to what we think will most likely happen.\n\nNow, let's try to guess what will happen in the future. Over the next ten years, we don't think there will be a money crisis. One possible path shows that from the year 2017 to 2021, the government will have more money than it spends. But because the country is already in so much debt, the government has to pay a lot of money in interest every year. This is not the best situation, because our debts will cost us a lot of money every year. Also, the government will spend less money than it has since a long time ago because of some rules agreed in the past. But this is still okay if the economy grows a little bit.\n\nThis picture changes if we keep the laws that make people pay less taxes. If these laws stay, we will have less money, the interest will be higher, and the debt will be close to 4% and keep growing. In simple words, for the next ten years, we do not have a money problem but a problem with less taxes. If you are worried about this, you should tell the people who make rules to stop the tax cuts. \n\nFor now, the money problem is not as big as it seems. But in the future, it could get worse. Sometimes, what we think will happen in the future can be wrong. But, we know some things for sure. We know that more and more people are getting older and need more help. This means the government has to spend more money on health care. This is a problem because we spend a lot on health care, more than other countries, and the cost is growing fast.\n\nThe cost of health care is very high in our country. We pay a lot of money per person, more than other countries, but we are not healthier. There are many reasons why our health care costs so much and is not very good. One reason is that doctors and hospitals get paid for every test and treatment they do, even if it is not needed. This makes them want to do more tests and treatments. People also use a lot of health care because they only pay a small part of the cost. One idea is that big hospitals can make the cost higher; another idea is that big insurance companies can make the cost higher. In any case, dealing with many different insurance plans makes the cost higher. We also pay our doctors a lot of money, more than other countries. One idea is that big money given for doctor mistakes make the cost of doctor mistakes insurance go up (which adds to the cost of health care) and makes doctors do extra tests and procedures to protect themselves from getting sued.\n\nFor any reason, health care in US country is costly, and as people get older, the big boss will have to pay more for it. This problem is bigger because the cost of health care has been growing faster than inflation and faster than the economy for many years, even after considering changes in population, and there is little reason for it to slow down. The most common reason for rising health care costs is spending more on medical technology: new procedures, tools, and medicines that can help patients, but at a higher cost. More money also adds to higher spending by asking for more health care. Again, it's not clear that our increasing spending on health care is buying us very much health. From an old time to a not so old time, the years people live from birth increased a little; this gain was the second-lowest among many countries (even though we were only in the middle before).\n\nIn the future, average money is likely to continue growing (although maybe not middle incomes), and there is no reason to believe the speed of medical innovation will slow. The Big Health Care Act (the Obama health care fix) does contain several steps designed to reduce the growth of government health care spending, from formulas that limit the growth of Old People Care payment rates to pilot programs trying out new ways of paying for health care. There is a lot of talk about how effective these steps will be (and talk about whether the entire thing should be removed), but in any case health care costs are still likely to grow faster than the economy in the long term.\n\nAs health care becomes a bigger and bigger part of the economy and of big boss spending, it will become increasingly difficult to balance the budget. In a not so old time, big boss spending on health care, including Old People Care, Poor People Care, and the Children's Health Insurance Program, was a small part of the economy; by a future time, it is likely to be around a bigger part of the economy, more than half of that because of Old People Care. It is true that health care costs cannot grow faster than the economy forever, but without big change in the health care industry, there is also little reason to expect their growth to slow down a lot. In addition, half of the expected growth in government health care spending over that period is due simply to people getting older and not to the idea that health care costs grow faster than the economy.\n\nAlongside growing health care costs, Social Security, which helped reduce federal deficits over the past decade (because payroll tax revenues were more than benefit payments), will instead start adding to the overall budget deficit. The main factor pushing Social Security into the red is the aging of the population and the resulting decrease in the ratio of workers (who give money) to retirees (who get benefits). There are two things happening. First, rich people are making more money. Because they only pay taxes on some of their money, the more they make, the less they pay. This is what's happening: a long time ago, rich people didn't pay tax on 10 percent of their money. But now, they don't pay tax on 16 percent of their money. It's thought that this will keep going up. Second, in the past, the money from taxes was enough to pay for things like help for older people. But now, it's not enough. This problem will get bigger as more people get old, there are fewer workers, and people live longer. If nothing changes, the problem will be very big in the future.\n\nThe big problem is that the government will spend more on helping older people and on health care than it will get from taxes. In one idea, where all the tax cuts stop and the government stays the same size, the problem will get big around the future. If the tax cuts keep going, the problem will be even bigger. In this idea, the economy won't be able to grow fast enough to pay for everything. At some point, something will have to change.\n\nThe short-term problem comes from tax cuts. The long-term problem comes mostly from health care. If the tax cuts stopped and health care spending stayed the same, there wouldn't be a long-term problem. The government would spend about the same amount of money as it gets from taxes. But, health care spending can't just stay the same. So, there is a big problem with the budget, and it comes from a problem with health care.\n\nFigure 4-6: Picture about the National Debt\n\nThe government buys a lot of health care, so it can help control the price. But, it can't control everything. The government can say how much it will pay doctors for something, but it can't make doctors see patients. So, to work, it has to pay close to the normal price. Health care costs have been going up for a long time, both for the government and for other people. This is because of new things in medicine and because people are making more money. Without changes, the cost of going to the doctor might not get lower. In the past, the money we spent on health care was not so much, but now it is a lot, and in the future, it will be even more. This means that people will have to use more and more of their money to pay for doctor visits and medicine. And this will leave less money for other things.\n\nOur problems with health care are big. We could get rid of the money problems if we stopped helping old people and children go to the doctor. But that would not be nice and it would make families spend more money. In 2011, a group of people in the House of Representatives, led by a man named Paul, suggested a plan to change how we help old people get health care. But this plan would make us spend even more money. This plan would only be good if we only cared about the money of the government and not about the real health of the people. We must find a way to stop the government from spending too much money without making old people and poor people pay for health care on their own.\n\nLooking at the future, it may seem like there is no way to balance the money of the government. But it is possible. The best solution would be one that makes the cost of health care lower for everyone. There is no rule that says we have to pay so much for health care. The law that was passed to make health care more affordable was a good first step, but it may not solve the problem completely.\n\nEven if we don't find a good solution to the cost of health care, we should still be able to afford everything that the government does if we want to. The UN city is one of the richest countries in the world. And we pay less in taxes than most rich countries. If we really want to balance the money of the government, there is no reason why we can't pay more taxes to keep up with the cost of health care. As long as health care is becoming more expensive, we all have to pay for it, one way or another. It is true that, at some point, higher taxes can make people not want to work. But the highest tax rate now is lower than at any point since a big war except for a short period, and there are many other ways to solve that problem, such as closing tax loopholes or making more people pay taxes.\n\nYou might not want to give more money to the government. Instead of giving more money, you might want to get less help from the government when you're old or sick. This is one way to save money for the whole country. The only way to save money for the whole country is to give more money to the government, spend less money, or do both. From a money point of view, any of these ways will work. We have a lot of money; we just have to decide how we want to use it for our own needs and for helping each other.\n\nIn a world where we give less money to the government and get less help, you have more money in your bank (if you have enough money to give to the government), but you might run out of money when you're old or not have enough money to take care of your health; in a world where we give more money to the government and get more help, you have less money in your bank, but you're safer. Rich people can take care of themselves, so they get less from helping each other, so they might be happier in a world where we give less money to the government and get less help; poor people can't take care of themselves, so they get the most from helping each other, and they will be happier in a world where we give more money to the government and get more help. If we cut the help so we can keep our money, it's like taking from the poor and giving to the rich; if we give more money so we can keep the help, it's like taking from the rich and giving to the poor. But both ways will work. All we need to do is decide, as a big family, what we want from our leaders.\n\nThis is really a decision about who should be in charge, which is why saving money for the whole country seems so hard. Today, some leaders don't want to give more money and want to cut the help in the name of saving money. Others, led by a big leader, are ready to give more money and cut the help, but don't want to only cut the help. As long as this fight continues, the money we owe will continue to grow.\n\n* * *\n\na These are the money rates we give to the government, meaning that even if you're in the 35 percent rate, you only give 35 percent on money above a certain amount, now around a lot of money. The current rates were set by a big cut; if it is allowed to end, the top rate will go back up to 39.6 percent. Technically speaking, there is no 0 percent rate, since we start giving at 10 percent on any money we make. In reality, the personal exemptions and the standard deduction make sure that some of your money is not taxable.\n\nIn simple words, when a person works, they and their boss each pay a part of the tax from the money they earn. A while ago, a change was made to lower a part of this tax.\n\nLet's say, a person who earns a lot of money in a year, like $50,000, usually pays a part of this money, like $7,650, as tax. But a person who earns even more money in a year, like $200,000, pays more money, like $19,043 as tax. But because of a rule, this is a smaller part of their total earnings.\n\nWe start with a plan from a big group (CBO) and make three changes: (1) we think the number of people sent to far away places will go down as planned; (2) we think the money doctors get will stay the same and not go down by a lot, which is what the current rule says; and (3) we think the money limit for a different kind of tax will keep going up to match the cost of things. This plan thinks that there will be less money being spent than we earn over ten years because of a special group's actions. This group couldn't agree on a plan, but the rule says there will be a lot less money spent. For more details, see the last part.\n\nThat means, the extra money a person has to pay for a doctor's visit or a treatment (the copayment) is much less than its actual cost; but we do end up paying the full cost in different ways.\n\n# _Five_\n\n# DON'T WORRY\n\nRight now, it's important to say that all of the banks in IR country are making money and have enough money.\n\n\u2014A big company, September 28, 2008\n\nAdam may have won the discussions about money rules in the old times, but Thomas had the final say about how people think about the country's debt. In the early 19th century, he wrote, \"I think being careful with money is very important, and public debt is the biggest danger to be afraid of.\" For Thomas, the country's debt could ruin the basic rules of our government. That way of thinking\u2014not a calm look at the good and bad sides of borrowing\u2014has shaped how people talk about the government's money for most of our history. People in power still talk about the money the government owes as if it's a bad thing, like a spot on our flag\u2014so clearly bad that no more talk is needed.\n\nBut the money the government owes is just a number. A big debt of over $10,000 might be a lot for each person in the country, but no one is asking you for your part of that money. The real question is: why should we worry about the big debt?\n\n## THE GOVERNMENT IS LIKE A FAMILY\n\nThere is one thing that everyone can agree on. On a summer day, during the talks about making the debt higher, President Oliver said, \"Government has to start living with what it has, just like families do.\" He was saying what Benjamin, then a leader in the House, had said two years before: \"AM country families are using less. But they don't see government using less.\" In the same year, Ryan, a new senator from KE state, wrote a book titled _The Tea Party Goes to WA_ ; its cover showed a big building with a belt tied tightly around its middle.\n\nThe idea that the government is like a family is easy to understand. It means that the government has to earn enough to pay for what it spends, and if it doesn't earn enough, it has to spend less; in other words, it has to balance its money. There is truth in this point. If the government borrows money to spend more today, it has to pay back that money (with extra) tomorrow. The big debt never has to be completely paid off, because the government keeps going, and so there is no final payment. Still, the need to pay extra means that some of the government's money must be used to pay for past spending, and, in normal times, a government cannot keep spending more (not counting extra payments) forever. Likewise, the more money that a family borrows, the more of its future money will be used for extra payments. But this idea is not perfect. First, the government isn't like a family in some very important ways. Second, even if the government were like a family, that still wouldn't mean that balancing the money is always a good idea.\n\nThe most clear thing is, the government has the power to ask for and collect taxes. This gives it a lot more control over its money than a normal family has. But it doesn't have to ask for more taxes now: the simple fact that it can ask for more taxes in the future means that the government can spend more this year and plan to earn it back later. (A family could make the same plan, but it would be hoping for future money that might not come.) This was GB country's strength in the old times, which Alexander tried to copy. Asking for more taxes in the future can be bad, especially if those taxes change the economy a lot, so spending more is not free. But it certainly gives the government a lot more choices with money than the average family.\n\nBesides the power to ask for taxes, the government also has the power to make money. In simple words, a big group of leaders could make more money to avoid needing more. But making more money can make things cost more - like it happened in the North and the South during a big fight. If a group of leaders is known for making money to pay for things, things can start to cost too much too fast. That's why, even if people think otherwise, the big group of leaders does not make money and keep it. Instead, money is made by big banks, who use it to buy things. These banks don't take orders from the leader or the group of leaders, which stops them from making money whenever they want more. Instead, the main job of the bank's work is to keep interest rates and the amount of money good for everyone.\n\nEven if the group of leaders were like a normal family, what would that mean? Families often spend more than they make in a year and borrow money: they need more money to pay for houses, cars, school, emergencies, and many other things. There is no rule that says that a family can't borrow money, or that it's a bad idea to borrow money. Sometimes borrowing money makes sense, like when you take a student loan. On average, the more money you can make with a college degree makes up for the interest you have to pay on your loans (especially since that interest is low, at least for loans given by the big group of leaders). Sometimes you have no choice, like in the case of a medical emergency: it makes sense to borrow money, get better, and try to pay the money back later\u2014just like it makes sense for a country to borrow money to fight a fight, end the fight on good terms, and pay the money back later. Sometimes it's just a bad idea, like borrowing money from a bad person to play games.\n\nThe same goes for businesses. Ross, who got 19 percent of the votes in a big election by promising to use his business knowledge to balance the budget. In 2011, Matthew also said his business experience taught him how to balance budgets. But what many people don't realize is that debt is a normal part of business. In this way, the group of leaders is more like a family business than like a simple family. In a family business, it makes sense to borrow money if you can use it in a good project, like opening a new shop. This is even more true if some family members don't have a job, because then the new investment can also give them work, making both the family business and the family members better off. Sometimes, it makes sense to give older family members things after they stop working for the family, instead of making them leave. What's true for families is also true for big businesses. All together, the companies in the BI 500 have a lot more debt than money, which means they use a lot of borrowed money. They often borrow a lot of money to start new things, or just to buy back parts of their company. And no one expects these companies to pay back all their borrowed money; if they did, people would say they don't have enough borrowed money. What businesses are good at, and governments are not always good at, is knowing when they can borrow money at low cost and use it to make more money.\n\nSo even though the government is not like a family or a business, there is an important lesson to learn. Borrowing money is not always a bad thing. What makes it good or bad is what you use it for. For a government, it's usually a good idea to borrow money to pay for useful things. What a \"useful thing\" is, is a good question. For example, roads and bridges are often thought of as good things because they help the economy\u2014but not the famous \"Bridge to Nowhere.\" And even if roads are good things, people disagree about whether the government or other people should build them.\n\nThere's one more problem with comparing the government to a family. The government is not supposed to act like a family: that's why we have a government. The government is there to solve problems that families and businesses can't solve on their own, like keeping the country safe; to do that, it uses resources from those families and businesses. In terms of money, this means that the government should do things to soften the blow of hard economic times. In a recession, families have less money and buy less, causing businesses to make less and put off investments, reducing jobs and making families spend even less. This can go on for years, especially if the government also spends less by trying to balance its budget despite having less money coming in, as happened at the start of the Great Depression. Government spending should go up, at least because more people need help and other programs, and the money coming in should go down, at least because people are making less; this will require larger deficits and more borrowing. One of the reasons we have a government is to do things that are good for everyone but that families and businesses won't do on their own, which in this case means higher deficits. (The other side of this is that the government should take in more money or spend less during good times\u2014something governments have never been good at doing.)\n\n## THE GOVERNMENT HAS NO MONEY\n\nSometimes, families, businesses, and leaders borrow money when they can use it for good things. But what if you can't find the money to pay your monthly bills, you've used all your credit, and you can't borrow any more money? After becoming the leader of the HO group in early times, Jack became Benjamin, talking about the chance that less spending would mean fewer jobs in the big leader group, \"If some of those jobs are gone because of this, it's okay. We have no money.\" When they showed their money plan that spring, the HO money group, led by Patrick, said that the country was \"very close to having no money.\" The big leader and hopeful president Ron became Ryan, saying, \"The main facts show this country has no money.\"\n\nThis sounds scary. Having no money usually means that you don't have enough cash to pay your debts, which means you have to give up. Giving up can mean sad things, like losing your house or, sometimes, having your earnings taken away. And there is often a strict limit on how much a family can owe. If you lose your job and a health problem takes away all your savings, at some point no one will let you borrow any more money, and you will have to say you have no money.\n\nThe rules are different for big leaders, though. If you borrow money for a house, there are laws that say what happens if you don't pay, and the bank can go to the judge to make those laws work; saying you have no money gives you some safety from the people you owe money to, but also lets a judge decide what to do with your things. Because there is no world leader, there are no same laws for big leader debts. So even if a leader can't or doesn't want to collect enough taxes to pay its debts, it has other choices. For one thing, a big country like the US usually borrows all or most of the money it needs in its own money: the money department sells bonds for US dollars, and when the bonds are due it gives them back with US dollars. One choice, used many times before in different countries, is for the leader to simply make more of its own money and use that to pay off its debt.\n\nBesides collecting taxes or making money, a big leader has a third choice for dealing with its debt: it can break its promise. A money bond is just a promise to pay by the big leader, and leaders break their promises all the time. The US leader's promise not to break its debt promise is a special kind of promise\u2014one that has rarely been broken, and that money places all around the world think will not be broken\u2014but not all leaders' promises are like that. In today's world, it is not common for a leader to simply give up and ignore the people it owes money to, because then it will have little or no chance to borrow money. Sometimes, people need to change how they pay their money they owe. They might need more time to pay it back, pay less money over time, or pay with new promises to pay back later instead of with money. How this is done can be decided by the people who owe the money, or it can be agreed with the people who are owed. At the end of the day, it's about who has more power. No one can make someone pay money they don't want to pay. But if they need more money, or need to be able to trade with other people, they can't just ignore the people they owe; they need to make a deal that works for everyone. So, while people sometimes don't pay their money they owe, they have more control than a family or a business.\n\nThis doesn't mean that not paying is easy. Not paying is like taking money from the people who are owed; it makes them have less money, which can hurt everyone (unless all the people who are owed are from other places). Not paying or changing how you pay will make people less likely to lend money, and so they will need to pay more money over time to borrow\u2014which can make it more expensive for others to borrow. After not paying, people are more likely to lend money in a way that the person who owes can't control. So, for example, the UK might not be able to borrow money by making promises to pay back in pounds, and might instead have to make promises to pay back in US dollars or in EU money. But again, this is a choice. People who need to decide whether or not to not pay or change how they pay need to think about the benefits of paying less money now against the problems now and paying more money over time later.\n\nIn any case, a person can only get to this point if they can't borrow money in a way that works for them. Otherwise, they could always pay their current money they owe by borrowing more money, just like businesses roll their money they owe by making new promises to pay back. And for this reason, the US is far from not having any money. Despite our problems, our government still has the best trust in the world, with both short- and long-term cost to borrow at very low in 2011. Even after our promises to pay back were downgraded by a big company in August 2011, the market made the cost to borrow even lower to record low levels.\n\nThere is some evidence that, if we do nothing about our long-term deficits, the cost to borrow will eventually go up, making it more expensive for the government to borrow money. But even in that case, any decisions we make about paying our money we owe will be based on money factors\u2014whether it would be better to borrow money at high cost, raise taxes, or change our money we owe\u2014not on whether or not we can come up with the money. There's a big rule that the US country has. If the people who make rules don't say it's okay, the US can't borrow more money. If this happens, the US would have to use only the money it has right now. If it doesn't have enough money, it might not be able to pay back the money it borrowed. But this is not something the US needs to worry about today.\n\n## OUR GRANDCHILDREN WILL PAY\n\nIn 2010, President Oliver said, \"We need to think about our children and grandchildren. We can't keep spending more money than we have. It's not fair to them.\" This idea is something that people from different groups agree on. In 2010, Matthew, who wanted to be president, said, \"We can't keep spending more than we have. It's not right to leave our children with so much debt.\" Now this sounds like a strong idea: if we spend a lot of money today, our grandchildren will have to pay it back.\n\nBut this idea is not completely right. Just because our country spends more money than it has today doesn't make us richer or our grandchildren poorer. The happiness of a society depends on the things people can use and enjoy. When the government borrows money, it doesn't take away things that our grandchildren could enjoy. Instead, it borrows money from people who are alive today\u2014people who would rather lend their money to the government than use it to buy more things.\n\nLet's make it simple. Think about the US as a place that doesn't deal with other places. The government needs money to do things\u2014like building roads, taking care of parks, and protecting the country. One way to do this is to ask everyone for money. But there's another way: the government can sell bonds to people who have extra money. After some time, the government decides to pay back its debt. To do that, it asks everyone for more money and gives it to the people who bought bonds (who have given the bonds to their grandchildren). We have pushed the need to ask for money from now to our grandchildren, but as a whole their generation doesn't lose anything. The money just moves from one group of grandchildren to another\u2014it doesn't make them better or worse off than before. (And this is just like what happened in our time, where the people who bought bonds paid for things that we all enjoy or for things that will help future generations.)\n\nThis picture is simple but not perfect. It matters what the big group of leaders does with the money it borrows. If the leaders use money on something, how they got that money doesn't matter to our grandkids. But what the leaders use the money on does matter. Our grandkids' future depends on the world we leave to them, which depends on the things we make and do between now and then. From a simple view, families can do two things with their money: buy things or save it. The saved money goes to businesses, which use it to build and make things for more work. So, as a big family, we can either use our money to make us happy now, or we can save it, which will make the world better for our grandkids.\n\nWhen the leaders borrow money, this can mean less money for businesses to use. But the leaders don't just throw that money away: they use it on important things. If they use it well, everyone will benefit and our grandkids will be better off. But if they use the money on things like buying health care for people, this can mean less money for our time, which could make our grandkids a little worse off. This makes it sound like spending money on health care is bad for our grandkids, because we're using borrowed money for things now, not for things for the future. But we have to think about why we have health care programs, which can make people healthier and better at work, and give important help to everyone. In short, what the leaders use its money on matters more than how they got that money.\n\nAnother thing is that our country is not alone. When the leaders sell bonds, the buyers aren't just from here, but also from around the world\u2014who are happy to buy them, since they are seen as very safe. But this means that if our grandkids want to pay back the debt, they will have to send money overseas to the grandkids of the people who are buying bonds today. (In real life, most of the buying is done by other governments and big groups, but that doesn't change anything here.) This seems like it's making us richer and our grandkids poorer: we can borrow money from overseas and have more fun today, while they will have to save money so they can pay our debts. But it's not necessarily so bad. Businesses borrow money from \"outsiders\" all the time, meaning they have to use some of their future profits to pay back their bondholders, but no one thinks that's a bad idea. The big bosses borrowing money from other countries to make things can be good for our grandkids. But if they borrow money to buy things, our grandkids will have to pay for it. Because the big bosses can sell their promises to pay back to people from other countries, every extra money they borrow doesn't mean less money for other people to make things. Even though the money borrowed by AM country people (including families, businesses, and big bosses) represents money that will have to be sent to other countries in the future, the total money from other countries almost matches the money Americans give to other countries; our growing debts to foreigners partly show the world is becoming one big place.\n\nStill, we can't be sure that the big bosses are using the money they get from other countries for things that will make us better off in the long run. We know that a lot of the money the big bosses spend is given to old people\u2014so today's debts could force our grandkids to pay more without giving them any benefits. Some smart people developed a way of calculating how the costs and benefits of big boss decisions are spread over different generations. This technique predicts that if things don't change and the big debt must be paid back someday, future generations will have to pay much more or get much less than people who are alive today. But this involves some big problems. First, like any calculation that involves a long time, it requires us to value money that will be used in the far future, and the results depend a lot on that value. Second, the difference in taxes between current generations and future generations partly results from the assumption that the burden of change will fall only on the future and not on the present.\n\nEven if borrowing money from other countries to pay for things like caring for old people does put a burden on future generations, that doesn't necessarily make it bad. Since these systems are funded by themselves (to different degrees), the \"problem\" could be seen not as spending too much today but as not enough taxes in the past (when current beneficiaries were working). Policies that reduce transfers to the old also affect the young and the unborn: for example, without help, working-age adults would have to spend more money taking care of their parents, leaving less to spend on their kids. More generally, there is nothing wrong with a system that transfers income from the young to the old, even if it may not be the best for growth (since investing in the young will have a bigger impact on future productivity).\n\nThis is especially true since, as a group, our grandkids are likely to be richer than we are, just as we are richer than our grandparents were. A society's way of life is determined by the total amount of things it can make per person. Living better is all about doing more work: if we can do more this year than last year, then there will be more stuff for everyone. People have been able to do more work every year for a long time now. In about 50 years - about the time from grandpa and grandma to you and me - people should be able to do about three times more work. This is good because more people will be old and not working.\n\nBut just because people can do more work doesn't mean everyone will, or that everyone will get more money. (In fact, many people haven't gotten more money for a long time.) Our grandkids might have the same problems we do now. If we borrow a lot of money from other countries, our grandkids will have to pay them back, which means they won't get to keep as much of the stuff they make. So, even though they can make more stuff, they might not be able to keep as much of it.\n\nHow much stuff our grandkids should have compared to us is a tough question, and there's no easy answer. We want them to have more than we do, but we also have to think about other things. We have to make sure they have a good place to live and a clean world to live in. That means we need to take care of our world and our schools. Thinking about our grandkids doesn't make it easy to decide what to do.\n\n## BORROWING TOO MUCH CAN BE BAD\n\nA long time ago, when President Clinton was in charge, he thought the government was borrowing too much money and it was hurting us. He said if the government borrowed less, we could do more work and have more money for things like schools and hospitals. Things seemed to get better after that, but there are many reasons why that could have happened.\n\nHow much the government borrows can be a tricky thing. Some people think that if the government spends more money when things are bad, it can help us do more work and make things better. Other people think that if the government borrows too much, it makes it harder for us to do more work. Both ideas can be true, it just depends on what's happening.\n\nWhen things are bad, it's usually good for the government to spend more money or let people keep more of their money. This can help us do more work. For example, in a really bad time a while ago, people stopped buying things and businesses had to let go of many workers. In simple words, when the leaders of the country decide to spend more money or ask people to pay less taxes, people will have more money. They will then buy more things. This will make businesses want to make more things and hire more people. It's like a good cycle. This was the idea behind some big plans in 2008 and 2009. If not for the 2009 plan, many people would have lost their jobs. Spending more money and asking for less taxes mean that the country will have less money, but if everything goes well, the country will get more money from taxes and everything will be balanced. But spending less money or asking for more taxes can slow down how fast everything is growing.\n\nBut, if the country spends too much money, it can be bad for how fast everything grows. This is because the country has to borrow money and they do this by selling bonds. These bonds are like promises to pay back the money. But these bonds have to compete with other bonds. More borrowing by the government means they need more money from the people who invest in bonds. So, the price of borrowing money goes up. This can make it harder for businesses to grow and families to buy houses, which are good for the economy. This is called \"crowding out\" and it can make everything grow slower.\n\nSo, spending a lot of money can be bad for how fast everything grows, but sometimes it can help. This can be confusing for the leaders who have to decide what to do. In 1993, two big people, a man from the president's team and a man from the money team, agreed that high borrowing was bad for the economy. So, they decided to borrow less. In 2001, when borrowing was not a big problem, the president thought that asking for less taxes would help everything grow faster.\n\nToday, when the country is borrowing a lot and everything is growing slowly, people are arguing about what is the best thing to do. Some people think we should spend more money and ask for less taxes to make everything grow faster. Others think we should spend less money and ask for more taxes to borrow less. Even though most people think that borrowing less will make everything grow slower, it is possible that in some situations it can help. This has been a big topic for the past two years. Usually, the people from the blue team think that when everything is growing slowly, we should spend more money. The people from the red team usually think that we are borrowing too much and we should spend less money. But these opinions can change. For example, in 1984, a man from the blue team thought that borrowing too much was making everything grow slower and he thought that asking for more taxes was the solution.\n\nLuckily, we can use numbers to understand this better. People used to think that having a lot of debt was bad for everything. They thought it would make things cost more. But, the cost of things has stayed pretty low, only about 3 percent more in 2011. And, it doesn't seem to change when the debt goes up (see Picture 5-1). It has been lower than it was after other bad times. Low costs usually mean that people are more worried about not having enough money than having too much debt. It's like people who lend money are telling the big government it's okay to borrow more money because they are not charging a lot for it.\n\nBut, that's not all. Even if having a lot of debt doesn't make things cost more now, some people think it will eventually. The low costs now might be because people aren't buying a lot of stuff. And, if businesses aren't making new things, they won't need a lot of money, which could make things cost less. As things get better, costs should go up. And, if the big government keeps borrowing a lot of money, that could make things cost more even faster. In 2011, some smart people who know a lot about money thought that the cost of a certain type of debt would go up to 8.75 percent by 2021 because people are worried about the debt. But, even if we lower the debt, it might not make everything better. Those same smart people thought that a plan to lower the debt would actually make things worse, making more people lose their jobs by almost 2 percent. At least for now, the good things about lowering the debt would be less than the bad things.\n\nPicture 5-1: Big Debt and Cost of Things\n\nIn the future, we don't know when the big debt will start to hurt everything. A new writing by two smart money people, Carmen and Kenneth, shows that bad things might happen if the big debt is more than 90 percent of everything we make and sell. They show that when countries have debt over that amount, they grow a little slower (about 1 percent) than countries with less debt. This could be a good warning, but it's hard to know what it means for us because even their results for developed countries are average over sixty years of twenty different countries\u2014nineteen of which did not have the special benefits of being the country that makes the world's most used money. (Carmen and Kenneth also don't find proof that higher debt will make prices go up.)\n\nIn general, higher costs and slower growth are a good reason to worry about the big debt. If we don't do anything about our long-term debts, they could hurt everything before the end of this decade. But this doesn't mean we need to cut what we spend or ask for more money right now, when a lot of people don't have jobs and it's cheap to borrow money. The best thing to do is to help the economy grow now and promise to save more money later, when things are better. But this is hard to do because it means doing two different things at the same time, and trusting that the hard part won't be undone after the easy part is done. With the way things are now, we may have to make hard choices.\n\nA long time ago, when GR country started using the same money as other countries, it did very well. People thought it was a good place to lend money to, even though it owed a lot of money. The government and people could borrow money easily, and the country grew fast. But then, there was a big problem in the world and a lot of people lost money. The government of GR country had to save money, and people were not happy. A new government said they owed even more money than people thought. People who lent money started to worry they wouldn't get their money back. The government had to pay more to borrow money, and it was hard for them to pay back what they owed. They might not have been able to pay back the money, and this would have been bad for the people who lent them money. This could have caused a big problem, especially because people thought other countries might have the same problem. To stop this from happening, other countries and a big organization helped GR country with a loan, but they had to save more money and ask for more money, which made people unhappy. But things were still not good, so they had to save even more money and ask for another loan.\n\nThis is what we call a \"money crisis\". Instead of the government owing a lot of money and it slowly causing problems, everything goes bad quickly: people stop lending money, the government can't borrow money to pay back what it owes, and it either can't pay back the money or gets help from a big organization. Either way, the government has to cut what it spends and ask for more money just to keep going.\n\nA money problem happens when people who invest money start to worry. We have seen in the last twenty years that markets for things like houses or shares can change quickly if the people who invest in them start to feel differently. This can happen with bonds too. For a long time, people might not worry about a place like GR country borrowing a lot of money because they think the economy is doing well. But one day something changes - maybe the economy isn't doing as well as people thought, or the interest rates go up, or the government doesn't do something people were hoping for - and suddenly no one wants to buy bonds from GR country anymore. Agencies that tell people how safe it is to lend money to GR country start to say it's not safe. When the interest rates go up, people get even more scared and the rates go up even faster.\n\nBut could that happen here?\n\nThe problem with theories about money problems is that it's hard to prove they're wrong. During the recent money crisis, every time someone said that interest rates were going to go up, they stayed low. But even if you keep saying something bad is going to happen and it doesn't, it could still happen. GR country is having a big money problem that is making life harder for its people and causing problems for the group of countries that use the same money. In theory, the US could have a money problem too: if we borrow too much money, if we're spending too much, and if it looks like we won't be able to spend less, we could end up like GR country. We don't know when that could happen.\n\nWe don't know because the US is different from every other country. We have been careful with money for two hundred years. We also have a strong economy and we can borrow money in our own money, which means we can make our money worth less to make it easier to pay back our debt. But the most important things are that we are a safe place for people to put their money when they're worried about the economy, and that our money is used by people all over the world.\n\nAt one point during the recent economic boom, there were rumors that our money might not be as important in the world economy. In 2007, a famous singer in a music video showed lots of 500-euro bills, and there were rumors that a famous model wanted to be paid in euros. But when the money crisis happened, the world wasn't ready to stop using our money. In uncertain times, people want our money: not euros, with Europe having its own money problems; not yen, with JA country's economy growing slowly and its government debt very high; and not yuan, with a strong government in power in CH country. In general, rich governments and banks keep their extra money in our money. Every time the world's money market gets shaky, people sell their risky things and buy US safe things\u2014even more during a big scare, when everything else lost value and the US safe things got so valuable that people were actually paying the US to keep their money for them. This comes with a risk, though. Today, the price of these safe things is heavily influenced by a small group of people who care more about safety than about making more money. So if these people decide that the US is no longer safe, prices could go up quickly\u2014faster than if our safe things were only owned by regular people. \n\nAs long as our money is the safest in the world, it's hard to imagine the US having a big, sudden money problem at our current level of debt. There might be a limit to how much debt people are okay with, but it's probably higher for us than for other countries. Things would have to go really bad before people would stop trusting the US, and they would have to go worse than anywhere else. Most big problems that would seriously hurt our economy would also hurt other countries; the big money scare, for example, started in the US but quickly spread to the rest of the world, and demand for our safe things went up as a result. To lose our special position quickly, we would probably have to mess it up\u2014for example by not raising the debt limit and then not paying our debts (and even that might not do it).\n\nLike all good things, though, our current status won't last forever. Powerful countries come and go, whether in war or in money. As growing countries get more mature, they might start investing more at home, reducing overall demand for our money. Maybe, one day, CH city will become the world's safe place, but that would need big changes in its politics and economy. People's trust in the EU money is currently falling, not rising, but another possibility is that the ongoing EU debt crisis will force weaker countries out of the EU, leaving a smaller group centered on GE city; this new EU could then be a serious competitor for safe money status. The most likely possibility is that we will enter a world where central banks and government funds hold different mixes of dollars, euros, and yuan, depending on who they trade with most. In that case, our money would still be important internationally, but demand for our money would be lower than it is today. This is unlikely to happen in the next three years, in part because it is hard for banks and markets to shift away from dollars. But it could happen in the next thirty, at which point our special money buffer could disappear. In the future, we might become more like a normal rich country. This could mean that we have trouble with owing a lot of money. This should give us time to fix our money problems before we have big problems like what happened in GR country.\n\nBut will it?\n\n## NO ONE WILL SEE IT COMING\n\nIn the beginning of 2007, IR country was doing really well. Its money had been growing 7 percent every year for ten years, making it one of the richest countries in EU place. They were making a lot of new houses which made more jobs; at its busiest time, one in five people in IR country worked in making houses. The banks in IR country also grew very fast during this time, taking money from all over the world and giving most of it to the people who were making and buying houses. Because the money was growing so fast, the money that the country owed went from over 90 percent to just 12 percent by 2007.\n\nBut then the prices of houses started to go down, AM country banks started to fail, and suddenly the now big banks in IR country couldn't pay their debts. As IR country went into a big problem\u2014the money would go down by 10 percent\u2014the government of IR country decided to promise to pay the banks' money (relying partly on a letter from a big bank saying that the banks were okay), effectively moving their debts to the government and its people. The money that the government owed jumped to more than 60 percent by 2010 as the banks' money got worse, needing more and more government money. With no growth and over 13 percent of people without jobs, IR country could no longer grow its way out of its problems. In November 2010, the government of IR country had to ask for help from other European countries and the big money fund. But the money that the government owed continued to grow\u2014to more than 90 percent\u2014making the money rating company lower IR country's money rating because they were scared that another help package would be necessary.\n\nAccording to our safe plan (in which the money from working and big money when people die are kept), the money that US country owes should grow from close to 70 percent of the money today to around 76 percent of the money in 2021. For the reasons we talked about before, we think that these money levels are not likely to cause a big money crisis during this time. But the money that IR country owed was only _12 percent_ as recently as 2007. The lesson from IR country is that bad things can happen quickly.\n\nAll guesses about future money problems depend a lot on what we think will happen\u2014about government decisions, about money conditions, and about the world. We believe that the big money office generally does a good job of coming up with good guesses of government decisions and money trends (and its guesses are the same as and as correct as those of private guessers), but no one can see the future. This makes two types of risks. The first is that money growth will be lower than expected. For example, at the happiest time of money guessing in May 2001, when people were talking about having more money for decades, the money had already started to slow down which was making less tax money and reducing the extra money. The second kind of risk is that something very surprising can happen. Long ago, nobody could predict two big things: a very bad event that made the economy slow down, led to more spending on safety, and started a war; and a big money problem that led to the worst money crisis since a really bad time long ago. These two things together made the country owe a lot more money.\n\nEvery guess about the economy has some uncertainty, and if growth is less than expected, the money we owe will be more. But guesses can be too low as often as they are too high; guesses in the past were sometimes too high and sometimes too low. But the second kind of risk\u2014big, unexpected surprises\u2014seems to be more likely to be bad, at least for the country's money. We have seen the impact of surprising bad events, wars that cost more than expected, and a near breakdown of the world money system; by a time in the middle of the year, our economy was still not as big as it was before a time at the end of the year. Most of the other surprises that could affect the country's money also seem to be bad: sickness that spreads fast, natural disasters, or a big problem with energy. The biggest good \"surprise\" was when a group of countries stopped being together, which let two administrations reduce spending on defense. This extra money, however, is unlikely to happen again, since current guesses already think about the planned reduction of forces in two war places. In short, this second kind of risk is unbalanced: if something is going to suddenly change the money we owe one way or the other, it is more likely to go up than to go down.\n\nThe fact that bad things can happen has two big effects. First, a big surprise can cause a quick increase in the money we owe, making a country closer to a money crisis, as happened in IR country. Second, to deal with a big surprise, a country may need to quickly spend more money, cut taxes, or owe more money. During a time in the past, the US government was able to stop the money system from falling apart because it could promise a lot of money to support big money institutions and protect them from running out of money. The government was also able to use almost $1 trillion in new spending and tax cuts that helped limit the badness and length of the money crisis. The government was able to do these big things for two reasons. First, it had \"money space\": there was still a big difference between the money we owe and the point at which people might get worried and stop buying government bonds. If the leaders don't have enough money, they might not have been able to save the money system, and the big problem could have made everyone sad for a long time. Also, the leaders only had enough trust to use that money: even with the support of the big leader, both leader candidates, and leaders of both groups, the program to help the money system needed two votes (and a drop in the money market when the first vote failed) to be accepted.\n\nHaving enough money matters because you need it to protect against the sudden increase in debt caused by a problem and because having that money helps you fight that problem. This is an idea that Alexander would have known, even though he was more used to old-time wars than big money problems. It was shown to the UK during a big problem in 1956, when it had to pull its soldiers from EG country\u2014to get needed US support for a quick loan from the big money fund. The final fall of the world's biggest empire, it turned out, was marked by a rush on the UK money\u2014because their money was no longer the world's reserve money.\n\nSadly, it's impossible to know how much money you have at a specific time. How people feel can change quickly, so you may not know you are running out of money until you have none left. A government may be able to borrow at low rates until a bad surprise\u2014like a downturn, money crisis, or finding out that the previous leaders lied about the numbers\u2014makes the interest rates go up. For example, GR country could borrow money at a rate of less than 5 percent until late 2009; a year later, it had to pay more than 11 percent; and in 2011 interest rates went above 25 percent. Money also depends on political things: whether or not the government is willing to raise money in the future to pay off the extra debts it needs to get now. Since there's no way to know how a government will act in the future, a country's past actions\u2014how willing it has been to pay back debt in the past\u2014affects how much people trust it today. According to a guess by big money fund people, based on past experience, the US probably could handle a shock that increased the national debt by half of all the money it makes, but probably could not handle a shock that increased the debt by all the money it makes\u2014at least not without something changing a lot.\n\nStill, half of all the money the US makes is a lot of money\u2014more than $7 trillion. Do we need to worry? We do know one thing that can add that much to the national debt quickly: a money crisis. As we talked about in chapter 3, the recent money crisis made our expected national debt level go up by almost half of all the money we make in less than two years. This is a big reason why we really need to fix our money system soon. In WA city, people talk a lot about how much money the country owes. You would think that they would want to stop the same things from happening again that caused the money problem. But, the rules that were made in 2010 left the money system pretty much the same as it was when it failed in 2008. Since the new leaders were chosen in 2010, the ones in the main group in the House of Representatives have been trying to make the rules weaker, saying they want to save money. This could make it more likely that the money system could fail again, which would make the country owe even more money.\n\nBut, a money system failing is not the only problem. Wars can also make the country owe a lot. The wars in IR country and AF country have added a lot to the country's debt. And by looking at history, IR country's war was a small one, with less than 200,000 soldiers at one time. In comparison, more than 500,000 soldiers were sent to VI country in the late 20th century, and over 300,000 to KO country in the mid 20th century. The amount of money the country owes will limit how much we can use soldiers against threats from other countries.\n\nHaving not enough money and being at risk of a big problem are serious issues. But how much we should worry about them is hard to say. We don't know how much money we have, or how likely we are to have a big problem. If everything else is the same, having more money is always better. But everything else is never the same. It's hard to choose between not nice options today, like higher costs or less money for things people need, and problems that might happen in the future. That doesn't mean there is a magic amount of money we need to have, but it's another reason why we should try to owe less money in the long run. Right now, with problems in EU region, a slow money system in US country keeping costs low, and no good alternative to US country's money, we could probably handle a big problem. Any limit on the government's ability to respond to a problem is likely to be made by the leaders in Congress, not by the market. But we should not think that we will always have this ability.\n\n## WHAT THE DEBT MEANS TO YOU\n\nToday, with a lot of people not working and wages not going up, many families are worried about how to pay for everything they need. Compared to the everyday problems of paying for a house, food, clothes, power, school, and health care, the government's money problems seem far away and hard to understand. People in AM country might not know where less money comes from and why it's important.\n\nUsually, the big money that the country owes doesn't really touch people's lives: if the money grows and the government keeps borrowing, it can make it harder for people to borrow money, slow down how fast things grow, and make everyone not as happy. But there are a few ways the big money could directly touch how middle-class people live.\n\nOne way is if our leaders keep going for another ten or twenty years, with less money growing because of lots of tax cuts, more old people, more money spent on health care, and the government not doing anything. At the same time, EU country fixes its money problems; CH country keeps growing and also becomes more open, making it a good place for countries to put their extra money; and those newly rich countries start buying more and saving less, reducing their foreign investments. The big money department needs to borrow more and more money, but faces a global money market that has less and less appetite for its bonds. As it gets harder to borrow money, investors quickly become nervous about the government's ability to pay back its rapidly growing pile of money; they ask for more money to lend, which makes it even harder to borrow, and suddenly there is no one willing to lend new money. The money-making place could print new money to pay off the debt, but that would make things cost more (and make it harder for us to borrow money in the future). Or, the UN city would need an emergency loan, but those loans usually come with strict rules. One way or another, we would be forced into big tax increases and spending cuts that would make the economy not as good, causing a sad decrease in living standards. The result could be lots of people without jobs and poor. This is what GR country is going through today, and it could happen here\u2014though it would take some time for us to reach that point.\n\nThings could also get bad faster. Imagine the money crisis of 2018, when our biggest banks, their money all tied up with things backed by houses or stuff or whatever the latest bubble is made up of, are suddenly unable to pay their debt and the global money system almost falls apart. In 2008, it was basically the big credit lines of AM country and some EU countries that saved the money system and the global economy: no one doubted that the money-making place and the big money department could absorb lots of losses if necessary to keep the system working. In 2018, with the national debt twice as high as in 2008 and still growing fast (and with EU still recovering from a decade of money crises), investors might have their doubts. More likely, if the current mood continues, the leaders will be unwilling to sign a blank check and the government will be unable to help the money system\u2014at least not until things got much worse than they did in 2008. Deficit worry in 2011 was almost enough for the leaders to make the government not able to pay its debts rather than raise the debt ceiling. In the future, with a much larger debt, the people in charge might decide to risk a money problem rather than help the bankers again. Without a quick, strong action, the next money problem could cause a lot of mess and another bad time.\n\nWe don't have to wait for the future. The big debt is already causing serious problems for regular people\u2014not direct money problems like higher cost for borrowing money, but problems in how things are run. Like it or not, most of us depend partly on the big government for our basic needs, either now or later. We mostly depend on money given to old people and health care to maintain our income and pay for our health care when we are old. It's not just old people who depend on these. If the health care for old people did not exist, we would all need to save a lot more money for health care when we are old\u2014and even then we might not be able to buy health care insurance, at any price\u2014in addition to taking care of our old family members. One in four people depend on health care programs for their health care. Without the big debt caused by the recent money problem, these liked programs would not be under attack in the big city as they are today. The acting about the debt has also made it impossible for the government to do anything to decrease people without jobs, which stays high years after the worst of the money problem; it has made it difficult to even do the smallest things to help struggling families and keep valuable human abilities, like giving more time for jobless insurance benefits for the many people who have been without work for more than six months; and it has even been used for purpose such as stopping money for certain groups and stopping enforcement of new money rules. In all these ways, the debt is already, through the working of the political system, hurting regular people.\n\nWhat could many years of this kind of politics look like? Every time growth goes down and debt goes up, we'll cut spending on government services and make small reductions to the money given to old people and health care benefits. Growth will come back as the business cycle turns up, debt will come down for a few years, and the big debt will be forgotten in the political agenda. But then the debt will come back because of a bad time or because of people and health care trends. Then we'll repeat the process, cutting spending some more. Each time, services and social insurance programs that lower- and middle-income people depend on will bear the most of the spending cuts, erasing away our already small social safety net. Since many government programs, in general, distribute money from the rich (who pay more in taxes) to the poor (who benefit more from social insurance), these periodic rounds of debt cutting will have the net effect of reversing this flow, shifting resources back toward the rich and increasing inequality above its already high levels. A few rounds of this and our country will look like a typical country, with the super-rich living on private islands in the sea, a comfortable professional class that holds the good jobs, and a large, struggling lower class.\n\nOur country does have a big money problem for the future. Right now, the big money problem is used to stop needed help and take away from the little help that benefits poor people and the middle group. As long as we have the chance of big money problems in the future, our leader system will be controlled by panic, mean talk, and confusion. Given who has the power now, the most likely thing to happen is that government money problems will be used to cut spending that normal people need--while more tax cuts make sure the money problems never go away. In other words, if we don't fix our money problem the right way, it is sure to be fixed the wrong way. Our challenge is to calm our big money problem in a way that is believable and fair, that keeps our ability to make important helpful investments, that keeps the services that most people like and need, and that helps economic growth for many years to come. We are now turning to this challenge.\n\n* * *\n\na The S&P 500 is a thing that shows how 500 of the biggest companies in the US are doing.\n\nb There is one idea, named after the money person David but most closely linked with the money person Robert, that says that even in this case our grandkids are not worse off. According to that idea, if the government borrows money for spending now, each person will think that taxes will have to go up in the future to pay back that borrowing. So, people in total will reduce private spending by the same amount that the government increases public spending; they will save the extra money, giving it to their grandkids to pay the future taxes. By the same idea, attempts to make the economy better will not work, since people will automatically save more to make up for tax cuts or spending increases. Most money people don't think people actually behave this way; anyway, the effect is likely to only make up for some of the current money policy. Robert presented the modern theory of David's idea in Robert's \"Are Government Bonds Net Wealth?\", a famous writing.\n\nc According to David's idea, however, neither will have any effect. People say that if we spend more or have less taxes, it doesn't matter because families will save more money thinking about future taxes; more loans from the government don't matter because that extra saving means there is more money in the money market.\n\nAnother idea for reducing loans later is that then the big bank can balance the effects of loan reduction through helpful money policy\u2014that is, lowering the cost of borrowing. That would be hard today because the borrowing rate that the big bank controls\u2014the rate at which banks borrow money from each other for short periods of time\u2014is almost nothing, and so it cannot be made any lower.\n\nA newspaper reported in 2010 that a country's government had earlier made deals with a big bank to hide the true size of its budget loans and meet the rules for being in the eurozone. Benjamin, \"How a big bank helped a country to hide its true loans,\" newspaper, 2010. Also, Taylor, \"A bank's secret money swap,\" a blog, newspaper, 2010.\n\nMy friends and I have been treated very well by a rich-friendly Congress for too long. It's time for our government to get serious about sharing the burden.\n\n\u2014William, 2011\n\nDuring a big discussion in 2011, some people, who signed a promise not to increase taxes, insisted on reducing the loans only through less spending. As a house speaker said, \"Except for increasing taxes ... everything is on the table.\" The other group's position was that the loans should be reduced through a mix of less spending and more taxes, with a leader even ready to agree on a plan that included $5 in spending cuts for every $1 in tax increase, despite some people in Congress being unhappy. Half of the people in the house voted against the final bill to increase the loan limit, mostly out of frustration that it only included spending cuts.\n\nThe loan limit agreement created a \"supercommittee\" to come up with a plan to reduce the loans. The members chosen by some leaders included people who were against taxes and walked out of loan limit talks over the issue of tax increases. (All six members signed the promise against taxes.) The supercommittee did not succeed, mostly because the two sides could not agree on how much to increase taxes and how much to cut spending.\n\nSometimes, it seemed as if the only thing that mattered to people in power in Washington was one number: the balance of tax increases to spending cuts. Some wanted the balance to be zero; some wanted it to be 1 to 1, or maybe 1 to 2, but at least something more than zero. The second group's position was closer to what the public wanted, but that leaves aside the bigger question: whether the balance has any real meaning. We talked about this in book 4, taxes and spending money can be confusing. The big group of leaders \"spends\" a lot of money in the form of tax breaks. Also, \"spending less\" could mean anything from less money for older people to less planes for the army; \"more tax money\" could mean anything from no more child tax break to more taxes for very rich people. We first need to know what we want to do. Then we can make specific choices.\n\nAny big plan to reduce debt should be based on a few important rules. It should help our economy grow: when we talk about budget, it's about how we use our limited things, and if we have more of these things we will be better off. It should be fair: if we have to give up something, it should not only be one group of people\u2014especially not those who have less money. And, if possible, it should solve big problems we have like not enough money for old age, big dangers, or changes in weather. These rules may sound good to everyone, but different people have different ideas about what helps the economy grow, what is fair, and what big problems we have. This book tells what we think they mean and what they mean for our rules.\n\nOne way or another, we will solve our big money problem. Even not paying is a way to solve it, though it's probably the worst way. How we solve that problem will decide what role our leaders play in future AM city and the world our children and grandchildren will live in. We could have a small group of leaders that protects us, runs the courts, and mostly lets people and companies do what they want, with only local leaders making rules. We could have a system where the leaders make sure everyone has what they need, like food, a home, health care, and school, from when they are born until they die. Or we could have something in between. Any big plan to reduce debt tells us what kind of world we want. This is why any talk about the big money problem must start with important rules, not just a list of numbers.\n\n## GROWING THE ECONOMY AND DOING THINGS WELL\n\nWe live in a place where our success depends on the decisions made by all the people around us. As Adam said in a long time ago, when people do what's best for them, they help everyone get richer, even if they didn't mean to. When this system works, it's because what people want to do in their everyday lives is good for everyone: people go to work because they like working (they like the money and the job) more than not working; companies make things and services because they can sell them for more money than they cost to make; people buy those things and services because they like them more than other things they could do with their money; and on and on, we make more and more of the things that we want. When people who only care about themselves work together in a market, they can make things better for everyone. This is an important idea in how we think about money and things today.\n\nBut sometimes, this doesn't work. Sometimes, the market doesn't make things better for everyone. That's why we need leaders to help. Without leaders, we wouldn't have things like safety or clean air, because you can't sell those things in a market. Leaders also make sure we have basic things like the right to own stuff, which is important for a good way of living. But leaders can also change how people behave. For example, because people don't understand how good vaccines are for everyone, we want leaders to make rules that change how people act. But making rules is hard. It's hard to figure out the right amount of rules for keeping the environment clean, or to make rules that balance the needs of people and businesses. If a business makes bad things at a high cost, it might go out of business because another business makes better things at a lower cost. This is one way markets can make things better for everyone. But this doesn't work with leaders, because they don't have competition. Instead, leaders have to deal with people's opinions, which can't always be trusted to make the best things happen for everyone.\n\nLeaders should try to make rules that make things better (like safety and clean air) while not making things worse. But sometimes, things get worse no matter what. For example, leaders need money to work, and getting money can hurt the way we live. If leaders ask for more money from people's jobs, some people might not want to work as much because they earn less. But other people might want to work more because they need more money. If leaders ask for more money from people's savings, people might not want to save as much and might want to spend their money now. Sometimes, this can be a good thing: asking for more money from cigarettes can make people smoke less, which is good for everyone's health. But sometimes, this is not good: asking for more money from things made in other places can protect jobs here, but it can also make things more expensive for us (and can make other places ask for more money from our things, which hurts jobs here). Usually, if you ask for more money from something, you get less of it; if you ask for less money, you get more of it.\n\nThe ideas about a good way to collect money for the country are easy. The money that people should give \u2014 which comes from what they buy or own \u2014 should be taken from as many things as possible, so that people don't have to give too much. If we only ask for money from some things, then people will try to only do those things that don't need to give money: if we only ask for money from work on weekdays, then suddenly everyone will want to work as much as possible on Saturdays and Sundays. A system that only asks for money from a few things also needs to ask for more money to get the same amount, and asking for more money can make things difficult. Also, the way we ask for money should be easy. A more complicated system not only means more work and cost for everyone but also gives chances for people to not give money, either by breaking the rules or not. For example, a big company sends its money from places in Europe through a company in IR country, a company in NE country, and another company in BE place to not give lots of money. This not only means less money for the country but also sends lots of money to people who's job is to find ways to not give money. These ideas mean that the best way to get more money is to close the ways people can avoid giving money, which will make more things to give money from and make the rules easier.\n\nBut doesn't asking for money always make it harder for the country to grow and cause less jobs? This is what some people think, that we should only spend less money, not ask for more. There is a little truth to this: in the short term, asking for more money, by making people have less money, makes them spend less and slows down how much is happening. But spending less also does the same thing because it also makes people have less money. So if we want to spend less money than we have, asking for more money is not worse or better than spending less in the short term\u2014and there is some proof that changing how much we spend affects the country more than changing how much we ask for.\n\nThe main argument against asking for money, known as a popular thought, is that asking for more money, especially from rich people and especially on money from investments, will hurt the country's growth in the long term by making people want to work and invest less. This is hard to see because it's hard to separate asking for money from other things that affect the country's growth, but it seems weak. In the high-asking times from the late 20th century to the mid 20th century, when the most we asked ranged from half to almost all, the country's growth was 3.5 percent every year; in the low-asking times from the late 20th century to the early 21st century, when the most we asked ranged from a little over a quarter to almost half, the country's growth was 3.0 percent every year. Detailed looks have found that asking for more does make people earn less, but this effect is small\u2014and most of it happens not because people work less, but because they do other things to not give money. Taxes on money from selling things for more than you bought them have not changed as much as the ones on income, but since the late 20th century, in years where the most we asked was a quarter or more, growth was 3.4 percent every year; in years where it was less than a quarter, growth was 3.2 percent every year (not including the recent bad times). Changes in what people pay for selling things can change when they decide to sell, but they don't seem to change how much people save. Also, the idea that low payments are good only works if they don't make the government owe more money. If the government has to borrow more money, it can be harder for companies to borrow money for their work.\n\nThe government spends money on things they think are good for us or to help people they need for their jobs. Sometimes, they can be wrong about what is good. Because of this, the government sometimes gives money or help to certain groups. This includes giving money to farmers, helping to make energy, and spending on things we don't need. We can't stop all of this, because this is how the government works. But, payments and help that change things should be used to solve problems. For example, being healthy is good for everyone, so spending on health is good; and the market will not give food to people who can't pay, so programs like food help make sense.\n\nA way to solve our money problems should also make the government work better and be clearer. Right now, most people don't know what the government does and how it gets money. This makes it easy for people in the government to add things to laws that help their home places. Generally, the more people are confused about what they pay and what they get, the more they question the government. This is hard to avoid because the government is big and complicated. But, the government is more complicated than it needs to be, with different parts doing similar things. For example, two parts of the government look at how trading works. The government has found many ways it could save money. Making the rules about money and the big group of workers easier could help us spend less, make the big group of workers do a better job, and make the money plan easier for everyone to understand. This could help us make better choices in the future.\n\n## FAIRNESS\n\nWe might all agree that the job of spending less should be shared by everyone, but that leaves us with a big question: what is fair? One way to think about fairness is that everyone should do the same amount of work, so a rich man's taxes should go up by the same amount that your grandma's money goes down. But most people would not think this is fair. It's also not easy to do: in 2010, we spent too much money, meaning that to balance the budget each family of four would have had to give more than $16,000.\n\nAnother way to figure out how to share the work of spending less is to ask people. For example, when people were asked about five ways of spending less money, the most liked option was making rich people pay more taxes, while the two least liked were spending less on money for old people and spending less on defense. Many questions show that a lot of Americans think we should make rich people pay more taxes to spend less money, while they generally don't want to cut programs that help a lot of people. This means that most people think that rich people should pay more in taxes, while regular people should not pay more in lower benefits. But just because most people want this doesn't mean it's fair: people could just be thinking about what's best for them.\n\nThere's a deeper way of thinking about what's fair. Today, when we choose between different rules, we know who we are\u2014rich or poor, working or not working, old or young, sick or healthy\u2014and so we know whether we will benefit from those rules or not. What if we didn't know if we would gain or lose? What choices would we make then? In a famous book, a thinker named Jack argued that a group of people who didn't know their situation would agree on two basic ideas. First, everyone should have the most basic rights that everyone can have. And second, if there are differences between people, they should help the people who have the least and give everyone the same chances. Jack's idea has been talked about a lot. But the main point is that we should measure rules not just by how they affect certain people in today's world, but by how they affect people who don't know whether they will have a lot or a little.\n\nIn that way, both fairness and overall well-being need rules that help people who have less. The question isn't just whether cutting money for health care hurts sick people more or less than it helps healthy people (by letting them pay less taxes and premiums). The question is whether changing care benefits for old people helps or hurts someone who doesn't know if they will be healthy or not healthy. This is not just a pretend question. Most of us know something about now and what might happen later, but we don't know a lot of things: how good we will be at our jobs in the future; how long we can work; how much help our parents will need; if our children will be healthy; if we will be healthy when we are old; how long we will live after we stop working; how our saving will do; and how well our children will do in a future we can't guess.\n\nScholars Matthew and David tried to study what people believe about fairness. They asked people to choose how money should be shared in the world, thinking that they could end up anywhere in that sharing. People in the US mostly liked how money is shared in SW country more than in the US. That means, without thinking about their own lives, most people think there should be less difference in how much stuff people have than there is now. A lot of people even think the big government should help make the difference between rich and poor people smaller. Fairness is a bigger problem than the government not having enough money, and the goal of making the government have enough money is not only to make fairness better. But a plan to make the government have enough money should not make fairness worse, and many people think that asking rich people to help more is not only good for them but also very fair. This is one reason why we have a system where rich people give more of their money than poor people. This system is fair and makes everyone better. In general, having more money helps a poor person more than a rich person, so up to a point asking rich people to give more to help poor people makes everyone better. Economists Peter and Ethan have said that everyone would be better if rich people gave more of their money to help poor people.\n\nThis system is one thing that might be liked if people didn't know who they would be (and people do like it). Another is insurance from the government. A big reason for our money problem is the government's big programs to help old people and sick people. Other programs from the government, like health care for poor people and children, also help a lot of people. One clear way to solve the money problem is for the government to give less help. This was what President George wanted to do with the program for old people. A long time ago, a man named Paul had a plan about a special kind of help for old people. He wanted to give them some money to use when they needed to go to the doctor. Another man, named Matthew, thought about a different plan. He wanted people to save money while they were working. They could use this money when they didn't have a job. These plans are different, but they all make people look after themselves more. If the help for old people changed, people who live longer would have to make sure their money lasts. If people had to pay for their own doctor visits, they might have to pay more if they are not healthy. If each person had to save their own money for when they didn't have a job, it would depend on how much they saved while working.\n\nBut people want to know that they are safe. They want to know that if something bad happens, they won't have to worry about having a place to live or going to the doctor. People usually don't like to take risks. They are more scared of bad things happening than they are happy about good things happening. That's why people like help that makes things less scary. If a thousand people put money into a big pot to rebuild houses that burn down, they all feel safer. Even if only a few houses burn down, everyone feels better for having helped.\n\nWhen we think about big, long-term risks, there's only one group that can really help: the leaders of our country. They can ask everyone to give a little bit of money to help pay for big problems, like when a lot of people get sick or when the money system breaks down. Private companies can help with smaller, more predictable problems, like car accidents. But the leaders of our country are better at helping with really big problems. If the money system breaks down, the money of private companies might not be safe. If there are more bad people doing scary things, private companies might not know how much to ask for to help. The leaders of our country are also better at helping with problems that might happen far in the future.\n\nHelping each other when bad things happen is a good thing to do. It makes sure that people are safe from things they can't see coming. No one who is starting work today knows how much they will need to take care of their health when they are old, or how much it will cost. They can't buy a promise from a company that will make sure they are taken care of from now until they die. It's fair to make sure everyone helps take care of these things, which is why we have programs to help each other. Taking apart these programs to save money would be bad for people in the future who need help.\n\n## BE NICE\n\nOwing money is not the only problem we have. It might not even be a problem: the real problem is what might happen because of it, and those things haven't happened yet. But we do have some big problems that are very real. Fixing our money problems should also help fix these other problems.\n\nThe biggest danger to us is if bad people or groups get really dangerous weapons and use them against us. Another big war doesn't seem as likely, because we spend a lot more on our army than any other country. We already have the strongest army in the world, so keeping safe from bad people and groups will mostly be about talking to people, making friends, knowing things, and special jobs\u2014not the big armies we used to fight big wars. These things don't cost a lot of money, except for the knowing things part, which has cost a lot more in the past ten years, reaching a lot of money in 2010. For example, even though people warn about really bad weapons, the programs that help other countries keep their really bad weapons safe only cost a tiny bit of our safety money. The money we need to keep safe from bad people should not stop us from fixing our money problems in the long term.\n\nOther problems we have are connected to how we spend our money. The cost of taking care of our health is going up and that's a problem for our money and for making sure everyone can have a good life. A lot of people today don't have health insurance\u2014a big part of our people. This is one reason why, compared to other countries that are doing well, we are not doing well in keeping our people healthy; for example, we have a high number of babies who die. Being sick makes it harder to work: we are one of the sickest countries when we look at people dying early and people who can't do things because they are sick. Paying more for health care means that our businesses also have to pay more, which they can't control. For example, in 2004, each car from a big company cost a lot more to make because of health care costs\u2014much more than for a different company. This makes it harder for our businesses to sell things to other countries and easier for them to move their work to other countries. As we spend more money on health, we might have less money for other things.\n\nHealth care costs are a big reason why our government is in debt, but just moving the cost to people or businesses\u2014or making the problem worse\u2014is not the real answer. As the biggest buyer of health care, the government can affect both prices and how much care people use. Government rules, like not taxing health benefits provided by employers, also shape the private market. Ideally, the government should use its power to lower its own debt and to lower costs for businesses at the same time.\n\nHigher health care costs also make it harder for countries with many older people, fewer babies being born, and longer life spans. In the US, because the first baby boomers are retiring and because of the recent bad economy, the money from Social Security taxes is not enough to cover the program benefits. But just cutting Social Security benefits is not the real answer because many middle-aged Americans are not ready for old age. In 2009, only 63 percent of households close to retirement had any retirement accounts; of those households, the median value of those accounts was only $86,000. Against this backdrop, big cuts to Social Security\u2014the biggest source of income for most retired Americans\u2014would only make families' retirement security even weaker. Instead, policies to lower the federal government's debt should try to increase saving by or for people who are still working.\n\nThe most dangerous long-term threat, though the least predictable, is changes in weather, which is likely to speed up over this century as higher amounts of greenhouse gases in the air create new pressures on the world's ecosystem. A full plan to limit the effects of changes in weather is far beyond the scope of this book, but money policy can help address this big challenge. One reason for high levels of greenhouse gas is that companies and people do not pay the full costs of the energy they make and use. A coal power plant has to pay for its coal, but not for the hospital visits by children who have breathing problems due to air pollution; customers of the power plant have to pay for their electricity, but not to protect cities near the sea from rising sea levels in the future. A plan that makes buyers and sellers of energy recognize these costs, by taxing carbon emissions or by selling emission permits to companies that make energy, could both raise more government money and help cool the planet.\n\nThis is not a full list of the important priorities we face as a country. The important thing to remember is that the purpose of a government is to make the lives of its people better, not to balance its budget. Paying off the big money the country owes but not helping the regular people from big problems is not a good deal. Instead, changing the country's budget for the next many years is a chance to focus on the most important problems and where the country can help the most.\n\n## QUICKLY BUT CAREFULLY\n\nAs Adam knew over two hundred years ago, there can be good reasons to have a country owe money. One of his reasons\u2014connecting the people with a lot of money to the country\u2014may not seem very important today. However, the country's bonds still play an important part in the world market as the accepted promise for deals. A market for the country's debt also makes it easier for the country to borrow a lot of money fast if needed. More importantly, there is no strong reason why the debt needs to be all gone. Paying off debt is the opposite of borrowing: it means using money now to save on future payments. Just like borrowing only makes sense if money today will give you more benefits than the cost of future payments, paying off debt only makes sense if lower payments in the future are worth the cost of the money today.\n\nA country needs to keep its debt at a level where it can borrow money at a fair cost and where it can respond to big problems in the future. This means that the country's debt must be stable or it must be likely to stabilize. If people think that the country's debt will keep growing, they are unlikely to lend money at a reasonable cost, at least not for a long time.\n\nThe big question is at what level the country's debt should be kept stable, and there is no magical right answer. As discussed in chapter 5, economists Charlotte and Kevin have suggested that a country's debt above 90 percent of all the goods and services is connected with lower economic growth, but we find it unlikely that this rule applies to the UN city\u2014at least as long as the U.S. dollar remains the major global money. But this special status will not last forever, and we think its life expectancy is probably measured in decades, not centuries or years. Someday, the UN city will become a regular rich country, at least as far as our ability to attract investments is concerned. At that point, we think that a useful target would be keeping the country's debt at 50 percent of all the goods and services.\n\nThis target does not come from a special formula, but from practical thinking and comparisons. It is close to the debt level that seems to be naturally stable for most countries, according to research by money experts based on different countries' past records. This big amount of money owed might give just enough help for the leaders of our FR country to deal with a big problem that, like the big money problem from a while ago, could make the money we owe a lot bigger. In that case, the money we owe would be the same as all the money we make, which is a very scary thing. The big money problem and bad times might make four countries owe more money than all the money they make; three of those countries are having a lot of trouble because of the money they owe. (The fourth, JA country, has been able to owe a lot of money because people save a lot and businesses don't borrow a lot of money.)\n\nEven though it might seem like we're being too careful, owing money that is half of all the money we make is still a lot. Before the big money problem, the last time we owed that much was a long time ago when it was going down fast from the time of a big war; the average for all the time after the war was less than half. While it's hard to guess how much we'll grow in the future, it might be a little less than after the war because there are fewer people working, making it harder to keep owing the same amount of money. Our goal of owing half of all the money we make is based on the guess that at some point our money won't be the only important money in the world, which will make it harder to owe money than it has been before. Because it's hard to guess what will happen and a big money problem could be very bad, we also think it's good to be careful\u2014just like we should be doing things now to slow down the change in the weather because it could be very bad. Finally, as we show in the next part, it's possible to keep the money we owe at half of all the money we make without needing to cut a lot of help or make taxes a lot bigger. If we had to do hard things to save money, then maybe this goal wouldn't be worth trying for\u2014but that's not the case.\n\nThe next question is _when_ we need to keep the money we owe steady. Again, this question doesn't have a simple answer, because no one knows when our country will lose its special place in the world's money markets. In our opinion, we should try to bring the money we owe down to a safe level by the time a little bit from now because it's totally possible that a change in who has the most money could be starting by then. In theory, sooner is better than later, but there is almost no way that the money we owe will be less than a little more than half of all the money we make by the end of this ten years. The office that makes guesses about our budget, which thinks that all of the tax cuts from the last ten years will end when they're supposed to, guesses that the money we owe will be a little more than half of all the money we make in ten years. Also, the US country is still getting better from a big problem that made us lose four years of growing. Trying to fix the problem faster could hurt us now.\n\nIdeally, new ways to fix the problem should wait until we are growing strong again, which may take more time. Many of these ways should start slow, so they don't fully happen until later. Then these ways will have time to bring our big money problem down to our goal by a far away time, or at least show that the problem is getting better. This is not exact, since changes can make the problem bigger or smaller, but the plan is simple. We have a long problem, and it needs a long solution. Our money problems are so big that any changes must take a long time. And while we should start making those changes soon, we should not do it if it risks making the longest time of not growing in more than seventy years even longer.\n\nIf our goal is to make the big money problem half of our total money by a far away time, what does that mean for our yearly plans? Under now's ways, if the old tax cuts end on time, the big money problem in a far away time will be close to 70 percent of our total money and getting bigger. To meet our long goal, we would need to make our yearly problem smaller by 3 percent of our total money by a later time. In that case, the big money problem would fall to 40 percent of our total money in a far away time and keep falling for more years. (Note that this would not completely balance our money in the 2030s, but would make yearly problems small enough to keep the big money problem under control for many decades.) The big money problem would not reach now levels until a very far away time. Given the limited value of trying to guess so far into the future, and all the things that can happen between now and then, we think now is not the time to worry about the problem of a very far away time.\n\nIf all the old tax cuts are kept, however, and other now's ways continue, the big money problem in a far away time will be over 100 percent of our total money and getting bigger fast. To stop that and meet our goal, we would need to make our yearly problems smaller by 5.5 percent of our total money by a later time, a much harder job. In that case, the big money problem would still be 53 percent of our total money in a far away time, but it would fall to 50 percent just two years later. In this story, the money that the country owes would keep getting less for another ten years and would not be as much as it is now until a long time from now.\n\nLuckily, there are many ways to get more money or spend less money. In the next part, we talk about a few ways, including the ones we like. Other people might like different ways. But, our leaders will only choose any of these ways if they really want to control how much we owe. Right now, people talk a lot about how much we owe, but the leaders who talk about it the most only want to use it to spend less money or to make their opponents look bad. Being responsible with money is talked about a lot, but not many people really care about it compared to either paying less taxes or protecting things like Social Security and Medicare. In the end, either the people who vote will make sure that the money the country owes is at a level we can handle, or the people who lend us money will do it for us, like they are doing to GR country and IR country. One way is much better than the other.\n\nFigure 6-2: How Much the Country Owes: Taxes Do Not Get Lower\n\n# _Seven_# _Seven_\n\n#\n\n# WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?\n\nA lot of money here, a lot of money there, and soon it's a lot of money.\n\n\u2014Said by a big leader (long time ago)\n\nA scary thing is happening in the Western world: the scary thing of having to spend less. New leaders in GR country, IR country, IT country, PT country, and UK country have all said that the government owes a lot of money to justify things like making people pay more taxes and spending less money on public things. Spending less has a story that makes sense: after years of living with more than we have, it is now time to face the truth, take responsibility, and make sacrifices\u2014or else we will end up like the Roman Empire.\n\nIt's a good story\u2014but that doesn't mean it's true, at least not everywhere. We take the money the country owes seriously (so seriously that we wrote a lot of pages about it). The government does need to fix a problem in its long-term budget that is from 3.0 percent to 5.5 percent of GDP (depending on what happens with the taxes). But we can fix that problem without getting rid of our important social programs, without getting rid of the small safety net for the poor, and without making people pay the level of taxes that they did from World War II until the 1970s. We can control the money the country owes in a way that helps the economy grow, keeps the important services and programs that many people rely on, and spreads the work of spending less or paying more taxes fairly across the people. This part shows how.\n\nOf course, we don't think that our ideas will magically fix the problem of how much the country owes. The problem is not that we don't have enough plans to reduce how much we owe; in fact, the past few years have had a lot of such plans, many with more famous people. \n\n## TAX CUTS\n\nThe first important question is what to do with the tax cuts that are due to expire under current law, most notably the income and estate tax reductions originally passed under President Bush in 2001 and 2003.a They are big: extending the income and estate tax cuts alone will increase the 2021 deficit by almost 3 percent of GDP and increase the 2021 national debt from 60 percent to 76 percent of GDP. As discussed in the previous chapter, extending them would also increase our long-term budget gap (the amount by which annual deficits must be reduced) from 3.0 percent to 5.5 percent of GDP. The tax cuts also represent a unique opportunity to reduce the deficit in our difficult political climate. Because they are already scheduled to expire under current law, Congress simply has to do nothing. Given how hard it is for Democrats and Republicans to agree on any spending cuts or tax increases, it is hard to imagine Congress enacting _anything_ that would reduce the national debt by 16 percentage points within a decade. When it comes to expiring tax cuts, gridlock can help reduce deficits.\n\nIn addition, letting the tax cuts expire is good policy. The major provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, as extended in 2010, are:\n\n\u2022 Reductions in all income tax rates, with the highest rate falling from 39.6 percent to 35 percent;\n\n\u2022 Reductions in tax rates on long-term capital gains, with the highest rate falling from 20 percent to 15 percent;\n\n\u2022 Taxation of stock dividends at lower rates (rather than at ordinary income tax rates);\n\n\u2022 Elimination of existing rules that reduced the ability of high-income taxpayers to lower their taxes through personal exemptions or itemized deductions;\n\n\u2022 Increases in the child and dependent care tax credits;\n\n\u2022 Gradual repeal of the estate tax; in 2010, Congress reinstated the tax on estates over $5 million (up from $1 million in 2001).\n\nIn addition to extending the 2001 and 2003 income and estate tax cuts (through 2012), the December 2010 tax act also reduced the Social Security payroll tax by 2 percentage points (through 2011, later extended through February 2012) and extended some tax cuts introduced in the 2009 stimulus bill.\n\n If the big group of leaders were just giving away money, this might have been okay because most families got a little bit of money back (but not families that only pay a certain type of tax). But most of the money the big group of leaders spends is used to help people (like older people's checks, health care, school money, and so on), which clearly helps real people; the fact that it's hard to get the big group of leaders to agree to spend less money shows that most other spending must help someone. Since the biggest part of the money spent is on programs that help all working people, giving more money back to rich people must eventually mean less help for the middle class\u2014unless they are paid for by future taxes that mostly affect the rich. There is a good argument to be made that both taxes and spending are too high and therefore both should be reduced. But that argument means that taxes and spending should be reduced at the same time; it does not justify always reducing taxes on rich people that will be paid for through future spending cuts that must mostly affect the poor and the middle class. In short, the cuts on income and big money taxes were bad a decade ago, and keeping them is just making bad policy stay.\n\nThe Bush tax cuts had another reason, which was that lower taxes would make people want to work and save more, making the economy grow in the long term. But there is not much proof that they had the effect claimed by their supporters. The economy grew less following the tax cuts than in the \"high-tax\" 1990s, even before the big money problem caused by the recent big financial crisis. It is hard or impossible to separate the effect of the tax cuts from everything else that has happened since 2001, but there is a basic reason to doubt that they have helped the economy in the long term: although lower taxes can make the economy grow by making people want to work and save more, lower taxes that are paid for through bigger money problems mean less saving, higher interest rates, and slower growth. In the words of two people who study the economy at the Brookings Place:\n\nSeveral studies have looked at the different effects noted above in different ways and used different models, yet all have come to the same conclusion: Keeping the tax cuts is likely to reduce, not increase, the country's money in the long term unless the reduction in money coming in is matched by an equal reduction in government consumption.\n\nIn 2010, the Congressional Money Office analysis also showed that extending the tax cuts would increase economic growth in the short term but decrease it in the long term (because higher government borrowing would take away private investment), making the economy smaller in 2020 than it would have been otherwise. Again, there is a valid argument that tax cuts along with spending reductions could be good for the economy\u2014but that argument does not apply to extending the Bush tax cuts on their own.\n\nThe last argument against extending the income and big money tax cuts is that you shouldn't raise taxes when the economy is weak. This is a reasonable argument. Since there will likely still be a lot of people without jobs at the end of 2012, it would be better to extend some of the tax cuts until the economy is getting better and then let them end, maybe even by passing a law that left them in place until the economy hit certain goals. In practice, however, the Republicans in the big group of leaders are highly unlikely to agree to any plan to phase out the tax cuts; and each time a tax cut is extended, the more it seems like a permanent part of the tax law, and the harder it is to get rid of. We might want to end the money help and use some of the new money to help with things that give people more jobs and don't last forever (like buying things or getting money back once). But it's hard to get people to agree on this. So, where the only choices are no money help or money help forever, we think the right choice is no money help. This could slow things down now, but should make things bigger in the next ten years. More importantly, this is the biggest step we can take toward making sure we have the money needed to pay for things like old age help, health help, and other insurance that people need in the long term.\n\nSadly, it is very likely that most or all of the money help for income and property will stay. President Oliver wants to keep all of the money help for families making less than a lot of money\u2014which makes up most of their value. The red team has always wanted to keep all of the money help, and Gabriel has said that any deal that only keeps some of the money help would count as asking for more money and hence would break the promise to the people. With everyone agreeing that most of the money help should stay, even the power of not being able to agree will probably not be enough to stop them. Because of this, the rest of this chapter thinks that all of the income and property money help will stay. (If this does not happen, then our long-term money problem will be smaller, and fewer of our other ideas will be needed.)\n\nBesides the big money help started under President George and kept by President Oliver, many other money helps are set to end over the next ten years, ranging from help for race horses to help for certain factories. Most of these are pretty small; the biggest are a bonus help (which lets businesses get money back faster) and a money help that keeps companies from having to pay U.S. money for money they make in other countries. If they all stay (in addition to the income and property money help), they will together add a little bit to the 2021 money problem and make the 2021 money owed to 80 percent of everything we make. As a general rule, we think that all of these money helps should end. A temporary money help should only be there if people thought it was only needed for a certain time; in that case, it should only stay if people decide that the reason is still good. If a money help really is a good long-term idea, it should be checked and kept forever, even if it needs a lot of votes. In this case, different from the income money help, we think it is pretty likely that many other money helps will end; for example, the biggest help is the bonus one, which has usually been used to make the economy better and should end when the economy gets better.\n\nSocial Security is how most Americans get money when they retire. But, there are more people retiring and less people working. This means there will be less money in the future. Around the year when most of the older people have retired, the money will be less by 1.3 percent. The money will then stay at that level for many years before slowly rising because people are living longer. Over the next many years, the money we pay and the benefits we get will be less by 2.2 percent.\n\nSome people want to change Social Security. President George, for example, wanted to make it like a saving plan where each person would put some of their money into their own account. This would mean the government wouldn't have to pay as much in the long term. What older people get will depend only on how much they saved and how well their investments did. The government will just help manage the accounts, so there can't be less money in Social Security.\n\nBut, changing Social Security in this way changes what we know it to be today. Social Security is meant to give sure income when people retire and protect them against many risks like getting sick, a spouse dying young, living too long, or investments not doing well. By shifting these risks to everyone, through the government. Individual accounts do not protect people against these risks unless they are added with more features that make them like traditional Social Security. By making Social Security like other retirement plans, more Americans might not be ready for retirement. A much simpler solution to the long-term Social Security problem is to admit that the money we pay won't be enough to cover benefits in the long term and either increase the former or reduce the latter.\n\nThere are many ways to fix this problem. We like a mix of four changes: increasing the cap on earnings that are taxed, tying the age of full benefit to life expectancy, including all new state and local government employees, and increasing the tax rate. The tax is currently 12.4 percent of earnings, but is only charged on the first $106,800, an amount that is adjusted for inflation. When the cap was set in 1983, it covered 90 percent of all wage earnings in the country. A long time ago, the money that didn't get taxed went up from 10% to 16%. This happened because some people started earning a lot more money. (Because rich people make more than $106,800, as they earn a bigger part of all the money, more money doesn't get taxed.) We should make sure that 90% of all money made gets taxed, like in 1983, and keep it that way. This would make the money we need to find for the next seventy-five years smaller by 0.5%.\n\nThe age when you can start getting full benefits from Social Security is sixty-six for people retiring now, but will slowly go up to sixty-seven for people born after 1960. (You can start getting benefits when you're sixty-two, but you'll get less each month.)b People living longer makes the number of retired people bigger compared to the number of working people, which is one of the reasons why Social Security needs more money; at the same time, because people collect benefits for longer, Social Security is more useful to them. If the age when you can retire goes up as people live longer (starting with sixty-seven for people born after 1960), the number of retired people compared to working people can stay about the same, except for changes because of more or less babies and people moving here. Over time, the age when you can retire would go up by about one year every twenty-five years; on average, that means each person would work about one year longer than their mom and dad. This change would make the money we need to find for the next seventy-five years smaller by 0.6%.\n\nRight now, Social Security doesn't cover more than six million workers of local and state governments that chose not to be part of the system. These workers don't pay the tax and won't get retirement benefits (at least not for the years they spend as government employees). We should make sure all new government workers are part of Social Security. This would let them be part of a very dependable pension system, which is very important because of the current political and money pressures on state pension systems. Social Security can work with another retirement plan (like for every worker in the private sector who has a traditional pension or a 401(k) plan), so local and state governments can choose to keep or make smaller their existing retirement plans for new workers. Making more people part of Social Security would make its money situation better because most new workers would pay into it for many years before starting to get benefits. This change would make the money we need to find for the next seventy-five years smaller by about 0.2%.\n\nFinally, adding a little more to the money we all pay for our old age would make a big difference. We like this idea better than giving less money to old people because they don't get a lot of money to begin with, only about $13,000 a year. Since many people don't save enough for when they are old, now is not the time to give them less. These four changes would make things better for the next seventy-five years. They would also help with the money the country has to spend each year.\n\n## HEALTH CARE\n\nOur health care costs a lot of money but isn't very good. Many businesses have trouble paying for their workers' health plans. This makes them charge more money to their customers, give less money to their workers, stop giving health benefits, or send jobs to other countries. Lots of people don't have any health insurance because it's too expensive. Even families with insurance can have a lot of trouble if someone gets sick or hurt: more than half of all people who have to declare bankruptcy do so because of medical bills, and most of these people had health insurance when they got sick or hurt. Health care keeps getting more expensive. The government has to pay for health care for about one hundred million people, including old people, poor people, people who have served in the military, and people who work for the government. This is expected to cost more and more money.\n\nWe can spend less money on health care in two ways: by making health care cost less overall, or by making the government pay less of that money. The first way is clearly better for everyone, if we can do it without making people less healthy. If we only make the government pay less, that just makes businesses and families pay more, and doesn't make anyone better off right away. The problem is that it's not clear how to make health care cost less. There's lots of proof that we could spend less money without making people less healthy\u2014other countries spend less money and are just as healthy or healthier, and places in the UN city that spend less money don't have worse health\u2014but it's not clear how to do that: just spending less money could mean we stop doing things that are really helping people. Some people are studying this to find out which treatments really help and which don't. For example, giving strong treatments to very sick people can cost a lot of money and make their last days very hard. On the other hand, care programs that focus on making people feel better and have a good life can save money, make patients feel comfortable, and sometimes even help them live longer. But even with this knowledge, it is hard for doctors to stop doing unnecessary things or to be responsible for how their patients feel.\n\nOther countries have everyone covered by health insurance which comes in different types. Some places like EN country have a health service that takes care of everyone and is paid for by taxes. Other places like CA country and FR country have both public and private sectors that take care of health care, but everyone gets insurance from the government and it's paid for by taxes. Lastly, there are places like NE country and SW country where everyone must buy health insurance from private companies, but the government makes sure everyone can get a basic plan.\n\nHaving everyone covered by a government health plan is one way to control costs. If everyone is part of one basic plan that is paid for by premiums, deductibles, taxes, and copayments\u2014just like the big health plan today\u2014that plan would be able to decide how much it pays for services and medications. This would make it possible to control how much is spent in the future without making care hard to get. Unlike today, when doctors and hospitals can say no to patients if they don't get paid enough, a health plan for everyone would be the only payer for many services, making sure that providers would accept its payment rates. Different levels of copayments could be used to guide people toward preventive care and away from procedures with questionable benefits. This big insurance would require higher taxes than we pay for the big health plan today, but those higher taxes would replace the amount we currently pay in health insurance premiums. Over the long term, such a plan could reduce total health care spending\u2014the number that really matters to our wallets\u2014because the big plan could control how much it pays for services.\n\nA big health plan would have other benefits. Over time, it could change payment practices that make providers more responsible, such as bundled payments for a given episode of care (as opposed to paying for each service individually) or a system of bonuses and penalties based on quality measures. It would also separate health insurance from jobs, making sure that people do not lose their coverage when they leave their jobs\u2014which is often when they need it most. Of course, nothing is free: if the government pays too little, hospitals will close and fewer people will want to be doctors, which could reduce the overall availability of health care services. Other places show us that it is possible to have good health care that doesn't cost a lot with a plan that everyone can join. Anyway, this would let us decide how much money to spend and what we get for it. Right now, everyone agrees that we are spending too much money, but we don't know how to change it.\n\nA health plan that everyone can join is probably not going to happen today. The president's health plan, which uses private insurance, just barely passed and would not pass today. This means we need to find other ways to slow down how much we spend on health care and close the government's money gap. The best way to spend less is probably to change how we do health care so that the people who give the care are responsible for the cost and the quality. This will make them want to work together, use the best ways to help people, and focus on making people better instead of just making more money. The health care law of 2010 tried to push the system in this direction, but no one knows what it will take to change the big ship of health care spending.\n\nIn this unsure time, we need to do more to lower the government's health care debt. The first place to look is the tax break for health plans that employers give, which are not taxed even though they are valuable to employees. This tax break will cost the government a lot of money in 2012, and it also adds to the problem of high health care costs. Because of the tax break, it is cheaper for companies to give their workers health benefits instead of money. This means that they buy more generous health plans than they would without the tax break. This increases the demand for health insurance and probably increases health care spending. It makes people stay in their jobs, making it harder to switch jobs and cutting them off from health care when they lose their jobs. And it is not fair, since rich people are more likely to have health plans from their employers and the tax break is worth more to people who pay more taxes.\n\nBecause of these reasons, the tax break for employer health plans should be slowly stopped. Some people are worried that this would make less people have health plans from their employers, which is still how most people get health insurance. The health care law, however, made a system where insurance companies offer plans that meet basic standards. These insurance plans must be available to anyone, cannot cost more based on existing health problems, and cannot be taken away. There's a plan to help families who don't have a lot of money get health insurance. We think some of the money saved should go to these families. It's hard to say how much money this could make, but we think it could be a small part of all the money our country makes.\n\nThere are other ways to save money on health care without making it harder for people to get the care they need. One big way is to make sure the government pays the same amount for medicine no matter who is buying it. Right now, the government gets a bigger discount on some medicine than others. There are other things we can do to save money too, but these won't save as much.\n\nThe last way to save money on health care is to get more money from the people who use it. We could do this by making people pay more when they use health care or by taking more money out of people's paychecks for health care. We think it's best to spread the cost between people who are working and people who are old. We could do this by slowly making people pay more for one part of the health care program. This would make people pay about $240 more each year in today's money, and would make more money in the long run. This way of making more money is fair because people with less money are protected, and people with more money pay more. \n\nLastly, we suggest increasing the health care tax that is taken out of people's paychecks, which is used to pay for hospital care. For most people, the amount of money taken from their pay for health care has not changed a lot since a long time ago. This money helps pay for hospital visits when they are old. We suggest taking a little bit more money for health care. This means that someone earning $50,000 a year would have to give up to $500 more every year. This is not a nice picture, with more money taken from workers. The better solution is to change how we look after people's health, so that we spend less and get better care. But we can't just hope that will solve all our problems. We need to be ready for a world where health care gets more expensive. We need a way to pay for these higher costs without making people miss out on the care they need. \n\n## PROTECTING OUR COUNTRY\n\nAlong with looking after people and keeping them safe, another big part of the money the government spends is on protecting our country. We spend a lot on this: more than in any year since a big war a long time ago; more than in any year since 1992, when the army was getting smaller after a time of tension; a big part of all the money the government spends; and a big part of all the money spent on armies in the world, almost six times that of any other country. Even if we don't count the current problems in IR country and AF country, we spend more on protecting our country than we did during a time of tension, when we had a big enemy. It's not clear if all this money we spend on protection\u2014which pays for a lot of things like big weapons and a big navy\u2014gives us the safety we need today. Since 2001, our main enemies have been bad groups that someday may get big weapons. Maybe one day, when CH country has built many big ships, we will need the eleven big ships we have now. But that day is not today. \n\nIn a simple way, it should be possible to slowly lower the money we spend on protection to levels from a long time ago or even lower without making our country less safe. As Larry, who helped a past leader, has said, it was this not too costly military that quickly made two bad groups leave power. The budget given by leader Oliver in 2011 already said that the money for protection would fall to around 3 percent by 2021. People from different groups have also agreed on steps that could be taken to spend less on protection. For example, a group, another group with people from both sides, and a leader named Thomas all said yes to several ways to spend less such as having fewer big ships, buying fewer of the F-35 and V-22, having fewer soldiers in EU and AS places, making the big dangerous weapons smaller, and changing the health care system for the protection department\u2014steps that would save a lot of money over the next ten years. The ten years after a bad event also saw the growth of a big and costly group that gathers information, with a total cost of more than $80 billion each year (most of which is not part of the military budget). With work split across many government groups and private groups, it is likely that removing work that is done more than once could both save money and actually make us safer by improving communication\u2014although it is hard because of how complex and secret it is.\n\nWe do not count any savings from the military or the group that gathers information toward our long-term goals because we think that these or similar cuts will be necessary to meet the limits placed on spending by a big act. These savings, however, suggest that our current high levels of spending on protection can be lowered as needed without making our country less safe.\n\n## ENERGY\n\nOne of the big problems we face as a country is the need to move away from old energy sources and toward new ones. Over a long time, the price of old energy sources is likely to go up as we use up more easily gotten oil, coal, and gas, and especially as growing countries like CH and IN use more energy. At the same time, old energy sources cause big problems, including dirty air (and its bad health effects), depending on different not nice groups around the world, and long-term weather change. Yet our current energy \"plan\"\u2014a mix of help and tax breaks for new energy sources, fuels like ethanol, and old energy sources\u2014is unlikely to make sure we have energy for a long time or to lower the amount of bad things in the air.\n\nThe basic problem is that the total cost of using old energy sources are not reflected in their prices; because they are too cheap by this standard, we use too much. The simple solution is to put extra costs on things like oil, gas, and coal that make the air dirty. Usually, we think extra costs change the way people use things. But in this case, extra costs can make things better because they make people use less oil, gas, and coal. We could put a \"dirty air cost\" on each ton of dirty air from big sources\u2014like power plants, cars, factories, and homes. If we do it right, this could cover about 90 percent of all the dirty air in the US. Over time, it would make companies and families better at using energy, which means less dirty air.\n\nIdeally, the extra cost per ton of dirty air should be equal to the total cost that ton of dirty air puts on everyone. But it's really hard to figure out what that cost is because it depends on a lot of things we're not sure about, like how the weather is changing, how much that change costs us, and how much we care about things that will happen in the future. Another way is to figure out how much extra cost we need to make the air clean enough to avoid big weather changes. Some people who study this think the price should be around $20 per ton of dirty air and should go up from there (to make people reduce dirty air more and more). To understand this, $20 per ton of dirty air is like an extra 18 cents for each gallon of gas\u2014a price that is not too big, but it's not too small either. A dirty air cost at that level would bring in extra money starting at about 0.6\u20130.8 percent of all the money we make in a year and going up by an extra 0.1 percent by the early time in the 21st century.\n\nA big problem with a dirty air cost is that it is not fair. Even though rich people use more energy than poor people (they usually have bigger houses that need more heat, for example), poor people have to spend a bigger part of their money on energy (because everyone needs a basic amount of heat, electricity, and transportation). The reason for a dirty air cost is to make up for the cost of dirty air while bringing in extra money\u2014not to change who has more or less money. So, the dirty air cost should ideally be made fair: that is, it should increase everyone's total costs by the same percentage amount. This can be done by changing the amount of money people pay in income taxes (raising them for rich people and lowering them for poor people) to make the dirty air cost fair. Or, if changing income taxes is too hard, up to half of the money from the dirty air cost should be given back to poor families to help them with the cost of the tax.\n\nThere are two different ways we could put in a dirty air cost. One idea is a tax on bad air stuff, where each factory has to pay for each gallon of fuel it makes. (That cost would be given to drivers when they buy fuel.) The other idea is to set a limit on bad air stuff and sell the right to make bad air; each factory would need to buy enough rights to cover the fuel it makes. People have talked a lot about which idea is better; to make it simple, one side thinks a direct tax is better, the other thinks a limit is easier to do. In reality, most parts of one idea can be used in the other, depending on how each is done. We think either idea would be much better than now, for money reasons and for the big money plan.\n\nFinally, a bad air tax would cover the bad air made by our cars, but not all of the other bad things made by driving, which makes traffic, accidents, and local bad air. To cover these things\u2014costs to all of us that are not in the cost of driving itself\u2014taxes on fuel would have to be about $1 per gallon, double what it is now, or even more. Making the big fuel tax 50 cents more per gallon would help all of us by making people drive less, reducing traffic, accidents, and bad air, and would also make more tax money by about 0.3 percent of all money. Or, the fuel tax could change\u2014higher when oil prices are low and lower when oil prices are high\u2014to make fuel prices more steady. In any case, a fuel tax is harder for the same reasons a bad air tax is harder, and so we suggest either changing income tax rates to make it fair or giving half of the extra money as money back to lower-income families.\n\n## MONEY STUFF\n\nOur current money problems are mostly because of our money business. As talked about in part 3, the money problem of 2007\u20132009 and the bad times after made our national debt bigger by almost 50 percent of all money. Taking away 50 percent of all money has a big effect on any guess of future national debt. If there was no money problem and the old tax cuts ended, our long-term money problems would be small and easy to handle; even if the old tax cuts stayed, the long-term national debt would look big, but not as big as it looks now. Also, the risk of another money problem\u2014and the need for money space to fix such a problem\u2014is a big reason to worry about now. For these reasons, rules that lower the risk and effect on taxpayers of a money problem are very important to our long-term money health\u2014even ignoring any want to make the money business pay for all the trouble it has made.\n\nBefore, we said the best way to make the money business less risky and big is to set a limit on how big a money business can be. But people did not agree with this idea. There are other ways to make the money business safer, like making big money businesses have more money saved for emergencies. These big businesses can sometimes do bad things, like taking big chances because they know the government will help them. They should also help in reducing the money the government owes.\n\nFirst, big money businesses should pay a fee for the cost of future help from the government. Because our biggest banks are bigger than they were before, they are too big to fail. This means that they will need help from the government in a future problem. This help should be less generous than before, but it will still cost money. These too-big-to-fail businesses should pay a fee based on their size and how risky they are. For example, the more a bank borrows, and the more it is at risk, the more it should have to pay. A fee that gets bigger with borrowing will help stop businesses from borrowing too much. If it is done right, it will stop financial businesses from taking too much risk, which will make the financial system safer. This fee could bring in a small amount of money each year. It will also help our future money situation by protecting future people from the costs of future money problems, which will happen for sure.\n\nThe second idea is a tax on money activities to stop too much risk taking in the money business. Many money businesses borrow a lot of money, which makes them take big risks. If things go well, the owners and managers keep the money, but if things go bad, other people will lose money. These risks are like bad air: good for the banks but bad for everyone. In theory, the solution is to tax risk taking so the money business will only take as much risk as is good for everyone. But it is hard to know which risks are good and which are bad. One solution is to put an extra tax on big profits made by money businesses. This will make risky strategies less attractive and reduce risk taking. Such a tax would only be on very high pay and very high profits. Economists think that a tax could raise a small amount of money. This tax is not just to help with money problems, but to make people in the money business take less risks that can be bad. Together, these rules will help make the money business safer and help get some of the money needed for the next problem.\n\n## THE SMALL STUFF\n\nThe big group of people who help run our country spends money on a lot of different things like help for school, help for homes, and research for medicine and space. We can't talk about all of these things in detail, but there are places where they could spend less money and make things work better.\n\nThere are two groups called Fannie and Freddie that are a good (but complicated) example of a program that changes the way things work. Before the big money problem, Fannie and Freddie were groups that had to help the home market. They did this by buying loans from lenders, promising to pay for loans if people couldn't, and making new loans, which made it easier for banks and others to give out new home loans. Because Fannie and Freddie were very involved in the loan market, they both failed when home prices fell and were taken over by the big group of people who help run our country in 2008; they continue to buy and promise to pay for loans and to make new loans. Right now, they charge less for promises than private groups would charge; they do this to help loans and keep the home market going, and they can do this because, as part of the big group of people who help run our country, they can borrow money cheaply. This rule lowers the cost of borrowing, making families go more into debt; because it makes it easier to take out a big loan, it also makes the price of houses go up.\n\nEven though Fannie and Freddie did not contribute a lot to the money frenzy that created the home bubble, the last ten years should have shown the dangers of rules that promote owning homes by helping with debt. We think that Fannie and Freddie should slowly raise their promise fees to levels that private groups charge, which will increase their money and improve their long-term money position while reducing this change in the price of loans. We also suggest slowly lowering the limits on the loans that Fannie and Freddie can buy or promise, which will reduce help for homes further, particularly for people who buy more expensive houses.\n\nAnother complicated program that changes the way things work is our system of help for farms. In 2010, the Department of Farms gave out over $15 billion in help through several programs. Direct payments give people cash based on how much their land used to make (whether or not it is still used as a farm); payments pay farmers when crop prices fall below a target, effectively setting a minimum price; loans also guarantee a minimum price while allowing farmers to benefit if prices are higher than the target; crop insurance protects them from losses due to natural causes, with premiums heavily helped by the big group of people who help run our country; and in addition to crop insurance, the big group of people who help run our country also gives direct help to farmers affected by bad weather and other natural things.\n\nThese rules make people grow too much of some plants like corn and beans (because the big boss takes the risk that the price will be low)\u2014which is why we eat so much sweet corn syrup. The big boss also helps our companies send corn, cotton, and other crops to other places cheaply, which is not fair to farmers in growing countries. In the year when I was 5, a big group said no to the US in a case brought by BR country about US cotton help; now, the big boss is giving over a lot of money each year to _BR_ cotton farmers. While farm help is often shown as a way to keep small family farms safe, more and more money goes to the biggest farms (and another part goes to people who don't farm at all). In this case, farm help could be cut a lot, leaving markets and things to keep most farmers safe from bad weather and big price changes. If keeping small family farms safe is an important rule, then the big boss could give them help with insurance and help in dealing with changes.\n\nA better energy rule, as talked about above, would also let the big boss cut back on help for moving things. For example, the big boss now gives about 4 billion dollars each year to help trains go between cities and another 2 billion dollars each year to help build big bus systems. While long trains and big bus systems would help make the air cleaner, slow the rate of weather change, and make roads less busy, both a tax and a higher gas tax should make them more fair compared to cars and planes, thus reducing the need for help. The big boss also helps air travel in different ways. For example, new fees added after a big sad day, cover less than half of spending on plane safety, and big and personal planes do not pay their share of air traffic control costs.\n\nEven though the possible good things are often said to be too big, the big boss could also save money simply by making its work better. For example, the big boss now spends about a very big number each year on things and services. In the year when I was 9, about a big number in spending promises were made in contracts where there was no competition, and more billions were spent in \"competitive\" contracts where only one bid was received. In some cases, this can't be avoided right now, because there may be only one supplier for a given special product or service. The Big Boss Accountability Office, however, has found cases where federal agencies could use competition to cut costs. The big boss could also follow the lead of many big companies in making buying decisions in one place to increase its buying power and get lower prices.\n\nMarket forces should be able to make a reasonable amount of home loans or corn. But a free market on its own will not make enough public goods, such as education and basic research, because they make good things for society that are not captured by the people who pay for them (think of all the people who have benefited from the Internet, which was originally a Defense Department research project). For this reason we do not suggest cutting federal spending on education, although there may be ways to cut waste and make the way that spending is delivered better. Our future will depend on how hardworking our people are, which is mostly based on how good our schools are. Right now, when our students are not doing as well as kids from many other places in math, it's not the right time to give less money to schools from the government. We also do not think it's a good idea to stop giving help like lunches at school, food help, or temporary help for families who need it. More than 15 out of 100 people in our country don't have enough money (about $22,000 for a family of four), the highest since a long time ago; in 2009, 15 out of 100 people couldn't buy enough food, the most since people started collecting this information. Even though giving basic things to poor people might not be the best for the economy, we think it's important for the government to protect its people from very bad situations.\n\nSpending (other than for old people and health care) is spread out across many departments, agencies, and programs, of which we have only talked about a few. The reductions to FR and FR and to farm help we talked about would reduce spending by about a little bit. Spending cuts in areas like transportation help and through better buying will be necessary to bring spending down to the levels required by a law from 2011; since our projections already think that Congress follows that law, we do not count these spending cuts toward our long-term goal.\n\n## TAX\n\nOne of the big things that happened during President R's time was the Tax Act of 1986, which made the tax code easier by getting rid of a lot of loopholes. Since then, however, Congress has slowly created new tax breaks, which reduce tax money, increase costs, and cause complicated tax avoidance behavior\u2014effort and expenses that serve no purpose other than reducing taxes. Many of these exemptions, deductions, or other loopholes are tax expenditures\u2014the same as government spending programs, since people receive money (in the form of lower taxes) for doing certain activities (such as buying houses). These tax expenditures, reduce federal tax revenue by about a lot of money, or 7 out of 100.\n\nGetting rid of or reducing tax expenditures is a rare \"win-win\" chance: it increases money (reducing the deficit) without increasing tax rates, keeping the incentives to work and to save; and it increases efficiency by reducing government influence on people's decisions\u2014a point made by Martin, a chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under President R. Some of the higher revenues could theoretically be set aside to lower tax rates, as suggested by some people who want to change tax or a \"flat tax.\" This would only be a good idea, however, if the B tax cuts were allowed to end; otherwise the revenues from getting rid of tax breaks will be needed to reduce long-term deficits. Sometimes, the money that people don't have to pay in taxes helps them do good things, like save for when they are old. But we need to think about each one of these things one by one. There are too many of these to talk about all of them, so we will only talk about a few big ones.\n\nThe biggest one is when people don't have to pay taxes on the money their job gives them for health things. We think this should slowly go away. The next biggest one is when people don't have to pay taxes on the money they spend to borrow money to buy houses (and holiday houses, for the lucky ones). This makes people want to borrow more money to buy bigger houses, which can make problems. It also helps rich people more than poor people. It's supposed to make people want to own homes, but it doesn't really help the people who are trying to decide if they should buy a house or rent one. And after the problems with houses and money a while ago, we're not sure if it's a good idea to make people want to buy houses.\n\nBecause of these reasons, we wish this thing didn't exist. But if we got rid of it now, it could cause big problems: without it, people couldn't pay as much for houses, and houses would be worth less. This would make it harder for people to borrow money against their houses and more people might lose their houses. So, we think we should slowly get rid of it over many years. Today, people can get this thing on $1.1 million of money borrowed to buy houses. We would lower that to $1 million in 2014 and lower it more to $400,000 by 2020; since not many houses in the US cost more than $500,000 today, most houses should not become worth less right away. This would mean people would pay more taxes in 2020, and even more in 2030.\n\nAnother bad thing hidden in the tax rules is when people don't have to pay taxes on the money they earn from bonds from the government in their city or state, which will make the government not get $50 billion in 2012. This is money that the government in Washington gives to city and state governments because if people don't have to pay taxes on their bonds, they will be okay with lower interest rates. But about one-third of the money ends up in the hands of the people who buy these bonds. If the government in Washington gave the money directly to the city and state governments, they could give the same amount of help for less money. This change would make the money the government gets from taxes a little bit more, starting in a few years.\n\nThe big government also helps the smaller governments by letting people pay less in taxes if they already paid some to the smaller government. This will make the big government get less money, about 74 billion dollars less, in one year. This means that the big government is basically paying some of your taxes for the smaller government, which makes it easier for the smaller government to get money. This is not very good because more money goes to places that have higher taxes and more money goes to places that have more rich people (since this only helps people who count all their taxes, and these people usually have more money than others). Mostly, this helps places with expensive houses more than places with inexpensive houses because the former get a lot more in taxes from houses than the latter. We suggest stopping this entirely and turning half of the new money into gifts to the smaller governments; the smaller governments could then decide whether to use the gifts to lower taxes or give more services. After thinking about the gifts, stopping this would make the money the government gets from taxes a little bit more.\n\nNot only does the big government help the smaller governments, but it also helps organizations that don't make a profit through the tax break for gifts to help others. If you pay a lot of taxes, for every dollar you give, the government is actually paying part of it. This is sometimes said to be a way of helping people who don't have a lot, but places that help the homeless and give food to people compete for gifts with a famous music place, a big school, and even groups that think about politics. In effect, the big government spends a lot of money (53 billion dollars in one year) on organizations that don't make a profit\u2014but lets rich people (the ones who give most of the money) decide who gets the money. There are many ways to change this that would not hurt the organizations that don't make a profit a lot. For example, only allowing the tax break for total gifts above a little bit of the money you make would increase the money the government gets from taxes a little bit but reduce total gifts by only a little bit. To put it another way, the big government (meaning people who will pay taxes in the future) would get five times as much as the organizations that don't make a profit would lose.\n\nAnother big thing about taxes is that the tax rates on money from investments, including profits from selling things for more than they cost and money given by businesses to their owners, are lower. Taxing this money is a hard problem that has been thought about by people who study law and money for a long time because there is no perfect answer. Taxing profits from selling things makes people not want to sell things they would want to sell otherwise. Because businesses already pay tax on their profits, taxing the money given to their owners is like taxing it twice. One reason for a lower (but not zero) tax rate on profits from selling things is that some of the \"profits\" are really due to things getting more expensive, not real investment returns. But a lower rate on profits from selling things makes people want to avoid paying a lot of taxes by changing normal income into profits from selling things. Also, the money people have to give the government when they sell something and make money from it is already low. People say this is good because it makes people want to save more money, which helps everyone. But, the proof that this really works is not strong. It makes less sense when the government has to borrow money because of it. We have had a lower money give back for most of the time, but the 15 percent from the 2003 change is very low. And most of the time, the people who have a lot of money get the most help from this. 96 percent of the help goes to families making more than a lot of money per year, with 67 percent of the help going to families making more than a very lot of money per year.\n\nBecause we owe a lot of money now and will in the future, it makes sense to ask for more money from people when they sell something and make money. Any less money people save will be made up by the government not having to borrow as much. We think the most money people should give back should be 28 percent, which is a little more than it used to be in the past. At first, people might not want to sell their things, but eventually they will. This should give the government more money.\n\nAnother problem is when people die and leave their things to their family, no one has to give money to the government for the things that were sold. This makes people want to keep their things until they die. We don't think families should pay less money just because they can give things to the next family. One reason for this was that it may be hard for the family to know how much the person who died paid for something, but now, this should be easy to find out, at least for the money things and houses that make a lot of money. This money thing will cost the money department a lot of money this year; if we stop it, we can get more money. We also want to change another money thing that does not count money from selling a house. The amount of money that is not counted should be made less, from a big number to a smaller number. This would still help most families not have to give money because of getting more money, but it would give less help to the rich. We think that making this money thing less would give us more money.\n\nNot all money things are bad. The different money things for plans and accounts for when you are old cost a lot of money, but these things are made to help people save money and save for when they are old\u2014both things that people do not do enough. Other money things that are talked about a lot, like the child money thing and the earned money thing, are more like things that change how the money tax is given out based on how much you can give than like hidden spending programs. But besides the examples talked about above, there are a lot of other money things that may not be good, like the money thing for life insurance things.\n\nSince some money things are better than others, we like to look at them one by one. But this might not be possible because each one helps a different group that will fight for it: the house and land businesses for the house interest thing, the life insurance business for the life insurance thing, and so on. Other people and groups have said we should just stop all the money things. The boss of our country's group for money and being responsible said we should just stop all the money things or, instead, stop all of them except the earned money thing, the child money thing, and less versions of a few other popular money things. Stopping all money things would give us more money, solve our money problems for a long time, and would usually be fair, since the rich get more from money things overall. But it could also cause big problems as house prices fall, saving for being old falls, poor families lose the earned money thing, and groups that do not make money have to get smaller.\n\nAnother big approach that would not hurt the economy as much is limiting the amount any family can get from tax deductions. Some people have said that limiting benefits from money things at a small amount of each family's money would have given us more money last year. This idea would give us more money and make things less unfair, but would make all money things less, no matter how good they are. In addition, it would be a flat tax increase, since all money groups would see their taxes go up by about the same amount of their money; so while it might make up much of the money lost in the old tax cuts, the overall money system would end up being much less fair than before a long time ago. A better way might be to limit how much you can use deductions to lower taxes. Today, if you have a $1,000 deduction, it's worth $350 to someone who pays a lot of tax, but only $100 to someone who pays a little tax. If we only let deductions be worth 15 percent of the amount, no matter how much tax you pay, we could get more money for the country. This would only affect people who pay more tax and use deductions, so it would be fair. It would also stop us from having to talk about each tax rule one by one. But, it wouldn't affect some tax rules that don't look like deductions, like lower tax rates on money from selling things like houses.\n\nBy doing some of these things, we could lower the amount of money people get from tax rules by 1\u20132 percent while keeping things the same for work and saving money, and not hurting the economy. We could get even more money if we're willing to get rid of tax rules that encourage saving (like tax rules for retirement accounts) or take risks (like by getting rid of the tax rule for mortgage interest).\n\nThe tax for businesses doesn't have as many chances to raise money and make things better because business tax rules are much smaller than tax rules for people. Still, the tax code has over $30 billion worth of tax breaks for certain industries like energy (both old and new types), wood, farming, or making things. Getting rid of all of these tax rules would get more money for the country without raising taxes, while making things more fair. There are other bigger problems with our business tax system: it encourages businesses to borrow more money and to keep their money in other countries for as long as possible. But fixing these problems won't likely bring in more tax money and help solve our long-term money problems.\n\n## SPENDING AND SAVING\n\nFamilies in our country don't save a lot of money. The amount of money families save\u2014the percentage of money they have left after tax that they don't use to buy goods and services\u2014was around 9.6 percent in the 1970s and then went down steadily from the early 1980s until the peak of the housing bubble in 2005\u20132006, falling as low as 1.5 percent. This long-term drop in savings probably has many reasons. Many middle-class families, which have not seen their wages go up for most of the past three decades, started to rely more on borrowing money to keep or improve their way of living; while prices haven't gone up much since the 1990s, the rising prices of health care and education forced many families to borrow more money; new ways of lending money, like the strange home loans that fueled the housing bubble, made it easier for people to borrow money even if they didn't make much; and the housing bubble itself, by making people feel richer, encouraged them to spend more and worry less about saving. Not having enough money saved and owing a lot of money can cause problems. It can make things worse when bad things happen, like when the price of houses goes down a lot. Not having enough money saved can mean people don't have enough money for when they are old. It can also mean there is not enough money for businesses to use to grow.\n\nSome people think we should change how we pay taxes. Right now, we pay taxes on money we earn. Some people think we should pay taxes on money we spend instead. This would encourage people to save their money instead of spending it. But, if we start a new tax and don't get rid of other taxes, people won't save more money. We might have to start this new tax because we need more money for things like helping people who are old or sick.\n\nA kind of tax that is used in other countries is called a value-added tax. This tax is added to the price of things we buy. It doesn't make it harder for businesses to work and it doesn't stop people from saving money. Because it's added to a lot of things, even a small tax can bring in a lot of money. For example, a small tax on things like school, health care, and government services could bring in a lot of money.\n\nBut, this kind of tax can be unfair. People who don't make a lot of money end up paying more of their money in taxes. This is because people who make a lot of money can save more and spend less. Our idea is to change the income tax to make it fair. We could make people who make a lot of money pay more taxes, and people who make less money pay less taxes. This would make it so everyone's taxes go up the same amount. Some families mostly use Social Security. If we introduce a new tax, the prices may go up once. But, the Social Security money they get changes with how much things cost, so they will be okay. We could also use half of the money from the new tax to help families that don't have a lot of money. This could be by making their income or payroll taxes less, or giving them extra money. This way, we can still lower the debt by a little bit, even if we make the tax rate two times bigger.\n\nIntroducing a new tax, and doing what we said before about reducing tax expenditures, would help us have less debt in the long run. It would also make sure our tax system doesn't cause too many problems. It might not make the tax rules less complicated and more efficient in general\u2014something tax experts have been saying for a long time. But, the most important thing right now is dealing with our growing national debt. While making the tax system better is a good idea, we don't think it should stop us from reducing the long-term debt.\n\nThere are other ways to help families save more money, especially by encouraging people to save more in their retirement accounts. There are some problems with these retirement plans: many people don't sign up in the first place; those who do don't save enough and don't increase their savings as their earnings increase; some of the money gets taken out early and never makes it to retirement; and even the money that stays in the account gets less because of unnecessary fees. These are all reasons why, even though people think that a retirement account is the way to a comfortable old age, the average family that was close to retirement only had a little bit of money in its retirement accounts as of 2009. Recent research has shown that simply changing the default options for retirement plans can help people save more: for example, if employees are automatically signed up but can opt out, more people will participate than if they are not signed up but can opt in\u2014even though the two situations are the same.\n\nMany big companies have started to automatically sign up employees for retirement accounts, but there are many other ways to increase retirement savings. In addition to making companies automatically sign up employees for retirement plans, Congress could make other default options: for example, plans could be required to automatically increase each person's savings rate over time, although people could opt out of those increases. In these cases, people still have freedom of choice, but they are likely to save more\u2014something that most Americans admit they should be doing anyway. The government could also change plan rules to make it harder for people to take money out early (while still allowing them to borrow from their accounts), which would increase the amount of money actually available for retirement. We can do things to save more money. This will help in two ways. First, it will give more money for the government to borrow. This is important if places like CH country start to save less. Second, if people save more money, they will be ready when they are old. Then, we can spend less on helping old people without making them poor.\n\nThere are many ways to save money and earn more money. These ways will also make things better and fair for everyone. This is not a full list, but just some ideas. There are other good things we can do that will help the government save money in the long run. One is to welcome more people to our country, because more workers help with the money for old people. But they have to be here legally. Another is to invest in things that will make our country better in the long run. This includes studying science and teaching young kids. These things will help earn more money and reduce our debt.\n\nOur ideas in this chapter show a way to reduce our debt without changing the programs that help people a lot. Some people think that we need to cut a lot of spending on helping old people, but this is not true. We need to reduce our debt by about 5.5% in the long run to make our debt half of our total money around the year 2030. The ideas in this chapter would reduce our debt by about 6% and only change a little bit the benefits for old people. We can find more ways to save money if we look closely at other programs.\n\nOur ideas do not just move the spending to people's homes. They also solve some big problems that we have. These ideas would stop people from borrowing too much money like what happened with houses recently; reduce money for owning homes; make big banks pay for the help they get from the government; reduce taking too many risks in banks; reduce too much money for farming; stop the government from choosing which businesses win or lose; reduce bad gases and help use new energy sources; and encourage people to save instead of spend. They would also reduce tax breaks for rich families and replace them with programs that help everyone equally.\n\n**Table 7-1: Ideas to Save More Money**\n\nBecause nothing is free, our ideas mostly fill the money gap by making people pay more taxes. People who only look at the government by how much money they use and spend might say our ideas mean \"big government.\" As we told you in chapter 4, this is not a good way to see the true effect of government on people and businesses. A big part of those higher taxes comes from cutting back on hidden spending in the tax rules. From a money point of view, this is like spending less money, not making people pay more taxes. Some money comes from taxes that fix problems made by energy and money businesses. These taxes, by making people and businesses pay for their actions, are needed for markets to work right. Lastly, more taxes for Social Security and health care show the increasing value of these programs to people. Health care, for example, is a plan that all of us buy from the government, and as health care gets more expensive, the value of that plan goes up. In general, because we keep Social Security and health care as they are, the government's role in saving for retirement and health care for old people will stay the same. The amount of money involved will go up not because the government does more, but because there will be more old people and health care will be a bigger part of the economy.\n\nThese ideas make rich people pay more taxes, because rich families benefit the most from the hidden spending we target. Our plan will have a much smaller effect on their choice to work and to save. The top tax rate will go up by only 1 point (because of our idea to increase the health care tax rate); assuming that the tax cuts are made permanent, the top rate would still be a lot lower than it was under a past leader. Our plan also keeps the tax rates on money made from selling things and getting money from businesses at the levels set by a past law.\n\nThe total effect on regular families is harder to see. Although hidden spending like the home loan deduction benefit the rich more than regular families, they do help regular families too. Higher taxes will also reduce the money all working families have. And the money back that we suggest to soften the effect of several of our ideas will not fully protect regular families from paying higher taxes. This is not a perfect answer. But if the goal is to make rich people pay more taxes, the easiest way to do that is to let the tax cuts expire; it is far easier for the leaders to do nothing than to pass a law that increases tax rates. We think it's very important to keep things like savings for older people, health care, and help for the poor the same as they are now. This is what our plan does.\n\nIf the tax cuts for rich people and big money gifts go away, we only need to save a little bit of money to reach our goal. Our goal is to have our country's debt be half of all the money our country makes in a year by the late 21st century. If that happens, we would suggest doing some of the things in Table 7-1. We would focus on things that are good to do no matter how much money we have. For example, taxes on energy, fees on banks that are too big to fail, and getting rid of taxes that make the market unfair. More of the money from these taxes could be given back to poor and middle-class families. Money from getting rid of business taxes could be used to lower taxes for companies. A new tax on things people buy could be \"revenue neutral,\" with the money used to lower taxes on the money people make. We would have a lot more choices. But for all this to happen, the tax cuts need to go away.\n\nLike we said before, there have been a lot of ideas for reducing debt in the past few years. While our plan shares many parts with other recent plans\u2014for example, most include getting rid of at least some taxes\u2014we offer a different path toward long-term financial health. Our differences with traditional liberals and conservatives are clear. The Congressional Progressive Caucus, for example, relies much more on higher taxes: its proposed budget increases taxes to 45 percent on income over $1 million and 49 percent for income over $1 billion, while taxing capital gains as ordinary income. By contrast, we favor a top tax rate of 39.6 percent, the level set by President Cameron in 1993. The proposal of the Republican-led House Budget Committee reduces the long-term national debt by fundamentally changing the nature of Medicare, shifting the risk of rising health care costs from the government onto beneficiaries, and even cuts the top income tax rate from 35 percent (the level set by President Benjamin in 2001) to 25 percent. As should be clear by now, we strongly oppose proposals that reduce deficits by shifting risks from the federal government onto individuals and families.\n\nThere are also clear differences between the approach laid out in this chapter and the various bipartisan proposals that have been put forward by the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform (established by President Oliver in 2010, known as \"Simpson-Bowles\" after its cochairs), the Bipartisan Policy Center's Debt Reduction Task Force (known as \"Domenici-Rivlin\" after its cochairs), the \"Gang of Six\" (a group of senators that created a plan during the 2011 debt ceiling standoff), or the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB). All of these plans talk about the same normal idea: help programs\u2014especially the big help program\u2014need to be made smaller (though not as much as in the House's plan) and taxes need to be made smaller. For example, one plan says that the money the big government spends on health care can't grow more than 1 point faster than the money we all make together (which is a lot slower than what we need because of how many people we have and how much health care costs); another plan sets the same limit on how much the big help program can grow by giving people vouchers that grow at a set rate, no matter how much health care really costs; and another group says we have to stop making \"endless\" health care promises. At the same time, these ideas\u2014all of which say they're about making the money we owe less\u2014include big tax cuts. The 2001 tax cut made the biggest income tax rate 35 percent, which will go up to 39.6 percent if the tax cut is allowed to end. Both plans set the biggest income tax rate somewhere between 23 and 29 percent; another plan makes it 27 percent; and another group wants smaller tax rates. These plans also get rid of different tax costs, but they still make tax money a lot less than it would be if the old tax cuts were simply allowed to end.\n\nOur way is different from these plans in two big ways. First, we do not agree that the answer to our government's money problems is to make families deal with those problems. The best answer for everyone is one that makes the overall cost of health care for everyone less. But if that can't be done, plans that deal with rising costs simply by making the old and the poor pay for them do not make all of us better off. For this reason, we do not put fake limits on government health care spending and we do not limit what the big government gives to the big help program. Second, we think that now is not the time to cut taxes\u2014and big money we owe should not be used to make the money we owe _bigger_ by cutting taxes. We would rather let all of the old tax cuts end, not to make income tax rates even smaller.\n\nThe bottom line is that our long-term money problems can be solved without making our big help programs or our little safety net a lot smaller. We can do it the easy way, by letting the old tax cuts end and adding some clear rules that reduce the money we owe and make the economy run better. Or we can make the tax cuts stay, which will need a much longer list of tax increases and spending cuts. Even in that world, we can still close the long-term money gap while making the economy stronger and keeping the important programs that we all depend on. Whether we choose to do so is a question not of money, but of politics.\n\n* * *\n\na In this part, we think that the special minimum tax (AMT) will be changed to match inflation to protect a lot of middle-class households from having to pay it. We think this is a lot more likely than the extension of the other recent tax cuts such as the reduction in income tax rates and the smaller rates for extra money and money from stocks.\n\nb We are not saying we should start giving early help at a higher age, so people can still start getting help when they are sixty-two. But, the way we calculate early help means that the help would be less if we don't change the normal age to stop working from what it is now.\n\nc Usually, we guess what the effect of a plan to reduce the deficit will be when the plan is all done. We use many sources for our guesses (which are shown at the end). Our guesses about GDP (for the bottom number) are from the CBO. CBO, _The Budget and Economic Outlook: An Update,_ August 2011, Table 1-2, pp. 4\u20135. For guesses based on years before 2011, we use GDP numbers from OMB, _Fiscal Year 2012 Budget of the U.S. Government: Historical Tables,_ Table 1.2.\n\nd Unless we say otherwise, guesses about how much money we lose from tax expenditures are static guesses.\n\ne This could be done by putting a limit on how much health help can be left out of income for tax reasons (which would be different for individual and family coverage) and letting that limit go down over time. Or, the Obama health care reform bill put a tax on plans above a certain amount that will go up with inflation; that amount could instead go down to zero over time.\n\nf The Budget Control Act put limits on appropriations for discretionary spending in future years, leaving it up to future Congresses to decide how to reduce that spending. There is no specific cap for defense spending, but assuming that defense and nondefense spending fall by the same proportion, defense spending would have to fall to 2.7 percent of GDP by 2021. CBO, _The Budget and Economic Outlook: An Update,_ August 2011, p. 21.\n\ng The increase in tax revenues would have been only $138 billion, or 0.9 percent of GDP, not counting the employer health plan exclusion, which we talked about earlier.\n\n# CONCLUSION\n\nA good Government, without good information, or the way to get it, is like a funny or sad play; or, maybe both. Knowledge will always be better than ignorance: And a people who want to be their own leaders, must have the power that knowledge gives.\n\n\u2014James, 1822\n\nAM city has to make a choice. It might seem like we have to make a boring, somewhat technical choice between different ways of dealing with budget deficits and the national debt. But how we deal with the long-term debt problem shows a more basic choice of the kind of government that we want to have: what services we want it to provide, what risks we want it to protect us from, and what role we want it to play in our lives. Many people may want to say \"none at all,\" but this is not a possible answer. National defense is something that few people would be willing to give up; more importantly, without government enforcement of property rights and contract law, it's not clear what kind of society could exist in the first place. There are places with very small governments. These places are usually not very safe or rich. \n\nThe kind of government we choose shows what kind of place we want to live in. The big government doesn't make our country what it is. It's made by the actions of many, many people. But through the government, we make the rules for our places and markets. Do we want to help poor people through charity groups? Then we should have rules that encourage giving to charity, like the current tax rule. Do we want everyone to have the chance to go to college, no matter how much money they have? Then we need grants and loans for students (or rules that make sure schools give everyone a chance). Do we want people to save more money for when they're old? Then we need rules that encourage saving for retirement, like tax rules for pensions and retirement accounts. These are all choices that we want our elected people in WA city to make. Even a decision to make fewer choices is a choice for a certain kind of place.\n\nWe have strong feelings about the kind of place we want our children to grow up in. It should be a place where new ideas, creativity, and hard work are rewarded. But people who don't have the skills that jobs want right now shouldn't have to go hungry or without a home. It should be a place where you can get rich if you succeed, but your chances to succeed aren't decided by your family's money. It should be a place where markets decide who gets fancy gadgets and bags, but not clean air and water. It should be a place where people worry about whether their businesses will do well or not, but not about whether they'll be able to afford basic health care when they're old.\n\nThe government is very important in this kind of place. Almost everyone agrees, it gives the basic things that make a market economy possible: owning stuff, the rule of law, money, a strong financial system, and so on. It spends money on public things that make us more prosperous but that a free market doesn't make enough of, like roads, education, and basic research. It gives protection against risks that people and businesses can't protect themselves against, even with insurance. These protections come in many forms: keeping the country safe, helping after disasters like hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, and wildfires; watching out for worldwide sicknesses; making rules and checking to keep toxins out of our food, water, and air; programs through which Americans protect themselves against losing jobs, save for retirement, and pay for health care when they're old; and programs that make sure poor people get a basic amount of food and health care. People can take risks because they know they are safe if things go wrong. There are lots of new small businesses in SV place because people aren't scared to fail. If you can only get good health care from your current job, you might not want to quit and start a new business.\n\nThe big government's job as the last safety net was very clear during the money trouble that started in 2007. At the worst part, there was a real fear that the money system of the whole world would stop, and we didn't know what bad things could happen. Matthew, the boss of one of the biggest money firms, asked his wife to get as much money as she could from the machine because he didn't know if banks would be open. The Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve gave a lot of money to keep banks going no matter what. In the end, the government kept the banks open, and instead of a second Big Sad Time we only had the worst slow time since the big war.\n\nThe lesson of the money trouble should be that in today's complicated and dangerous world, government protection from big risks is more important than ever. Other changes in the US over the past few years have also made many people more exposed to a lot of risks that they can't handle by themselves. The decrease of traditional pensions (which assure workers a specific level of income during retirement) has exposed more people to the risks of not saving enough and poor investment performance, making them more dependent on Social Security. The increasing cost of health care has left fifty million people uninsured and made all of us more reliant on Medicare to cover us in old age. The decrease of unions has decreased job security, increasing the risk of losing a job and the importance of unemployment insurance. Global competition in making things and some service industries may be good for Americans overall, but makes it more likely that people will suddenly find themselves without useful skills in the middle of their career. In many ways, the big idea of the free market\u2014open markets and lots of competition\u2014has made all of us more vulnerable, as individuals, to luck.\n\nAnd yet our current big debts\u2014which are the direct result of a nearly catastrophic money trouble brought on by a not-controlled banking sector\u2014are being used as a reason to dismantle the protections provided by the big government, from taking care of the environment to Medicare. Yes, government costs money. Yes, if we want to have good social insurance programs and a basic safety net, we must be willing to pay for them. And yes, as of today, we are not paying for them: we have already run deficits for a decade, Social Security faces a moderately sized long-term deficit, and there is no plan on the books to pay for expected increases in health care costs. Just because we don't pay for some things doesn't mean we can't or shouldn't pay for them. In a world where nothing is really free, people need help now more than ever. It wouldn't be right to stop helping because things have gone wrong and there's less money.\n\nIn the last chapter, we talked about how it's possible to keep things balanced, be ready for future problems, keep helping people, and make things better, all at the same time. Different people will have different ideas on how to do this. Some might want to change how much we pay in taxes or how we spend money. But the important thing is, we can solve our money problems without doing anything too extreme. Our economy is big and growing, and people will still want to lend us money. Even though we've had some big problems, things aren't as bad as in some other places. Our money problems aren't a scary monster that will eat up everything unless we give up everything we care about. It's something we can deal with if we're clear about what we're willing to pay for and what choices we're willing to make.\n\nThe government gets money from us (when we're working) and uses it to help us. So when we talk about money problems, we're really talking about how we use what we have. It's not just about taking money from the rich to give to the poor. It's about how much we all put together today to help us with things we can't see coming tomorrow. In the old days, one big job of the government was to keep people safe from attacks. Today, we need the government to help us with lots more things, like not having a job, getting sick, and not having enough money when we're old.\n\nThe big question is, how much risk should people take on themselves, and how much should we all share through the government? We think we should keep helping people the way we are now\u2014especially because things are getting tougher for ordinary families because of things like global competition, rising health care costs, less retirement money, and a world where only a few people win big. Sharing when things go wrong is only fair. Bad things can happen to anyone, like getting sick, losing a job, or losing money. Is it right for people to become poor or not get medical help because of bad luck?\n\nWe live in a place where the people's votes decide what rules are made. But, our system is not working well right now. Many people do not understand things like money, debt, and how the government works. These are hard topics that are not fun to learn about. But, it is important to understand them because they affect our lives. Many people do not know where their taxes go, what the government does, and how it helps us. Some people believe things that are not true, like thinking they do not get help from the government or believing that we will never have a big money crisis.\n\nSometimes, leaders do not want to fix the money problems. A past leader, Ronald, talked about fixing money problems but made them bigger. When George, another leader, tried to fix the money problems by asking for more taxes, people in his group did not like it. This made him lose the next election. When Bill, another leader, did the same thing, his group lost a lot in the next election. Then, Dick said, \"Money problems do not matter.\" He was not talking about money, but about winning in politics. In this situation, leaders get rewards for talking about money problems, but not for fixing them.\n\nIn the early 19th century, the leaders wanted to fight with another country, GB, but they did not want to ask for more taxes to pay for it. This caused a big money problem that made it hard for the country to protect itself. Today, we know that as people get older and medical help gets more expensive, the government will have to spend more money. This is especially true because many families do not have enough money saved for when they get old. Until now, the big group of leaders has not wanted to ask for more money or to make less popular things for everyone.\n\nBut at the end of the day, how we deal with our big money problems will affect you, and you can tell your leaders what to do about it. So the question for you is: how much danger do you want to face? There are people like Benjamin, William, the Wilsons, and the Kings who can handle any money danger. If you are not so lucky, are you ready for your old age money to depend only on your saving, your choices, and the changes of the market? Are you ready to pay for your own health care in old age, no matter how much it may cost by then? Are you sure that you have the skills to find a new job quickly if your boss stops his business? What would you do if you could not work at all? And could you pay for years of long care in a care home, either for you or for your parents?\n\nIf you are like most people, we think the answer to these questions is no, especially after many years of the same real wages was followed by the worst time since the 1930s. Most people, we think, are made better by things that need money today but give protection against things you can't see and can't avoid in the long term. The question we leave you with is this: Are you and your family ready to face these dangers alone, not knowing what will happen in the future, or do you want to live in a community that will protect you from bad things that are beyond your control? This is what the talk over the big money problems comes down to, and the result depends on you. There are some rules about how we spend our money. One rule says that we can't spend too much in the future. But sometimes, we can change the rules. For example, there's a rule that says we have to pay more tax if we make a lot of money. But we've changed this rule before so it doesn't affect too many people. We also have a rule that says doctors get less money for helping older people, but we've stopped this from happening before too.\n\nNext, there's a rule about taxes from 2010. This rule says that some people have to pay less tax. But this rule is supposed to end in 2012. Some people want to keep this rule, but some people think it should end. We think it should end, but we also look at what could happen if it doesn't. There are also other rules about taxes that are supposed to end. We think none of them will continue.\n\nIn the future, we think our money situation will look like what a group called the CBO said in 2011. They made a guess about what will happen until 2085. They mostly talked about what will happen until 2035. But then, there were some big changes in 2011. So, we tried to guess what the CBO would say now. We used their guess from August 2011 to help us.\n\nThe big report from 2011 talks about two ideas: one where things stay the same, and another where things change. For the first, it's like thinking about what will happen in the next ten years if everything stays the same. For the second, it's like thinking about what will happen if things change (like if all the tax cuts keep going).\n\nWe also talk about two ideas: one where the tax cuts from 2001-2010 stop, and one where they keep going. We think about these ideas in the same way; the only difference is where we start in 2021. Here's what we think:\n\n\u2022 The money the government gets will grow from what it was in 2021. We use the average rate given by the big report's second idea in its 2009 long-term forecast.\n\n\u2022 The money spent on helping older people will grow from its 2021 level until it stays at 6.1 percent of all the money we make in the early 2030s.\n\n\u2022 The money spent on Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, and help for health insurance will grow from its 2021 level. Spending in this idea is more than in the first idea.\n\n\u2022 Other spending will stay the same as a percentage of all the money we make at its 2021 level.\n\n\u2022 Other ways of getting money (changes in government accounts that affect how much the government borrows) will go from 0.3 percent of all the money we make in 2021 to 0.1 percent in 2023.\n\n\u2022 The average real interest rate on government debt in the long term will be 2.7 percent and the average rise in prices will be 2.5 percent. We think these rates will change linearly from their 2021 values to reach their long-term values in 2031.\n\n\u2022 The average annual growth rate of all the money we make will be 2.1 percent over the 2021\u20132035 period and 2.2 percent over the 2035\u20132085 period. The change in prices (another way of looking at inflation) will grow at 2.2 percent per year.\n\nIn simple terms, our ideas are like what we thought in 2011. The big change is we thought that the money the government gets will stay the same starting in 2021. We think this is too careful, because it says that even if we need more money, the people in charge will not ask for more but will even ask for less. (If everything stays the same, the government will slowly get more money because people will be making more money.) We think a better idea is that the people in charge will not do anything (except make sure people pay their fair share), and so the government will get more money slowly.\n\nThese are the only changes we make to the ideas from before, so we are using the same thoughts about the economy. These thoughts might be too hopeful or too worried, but we do not know which one. The thoughts about the economy do not think about what would happen if we owe a lot of money; if we do owe a lot of money, it could make things harder for the economy and make it cost more to borrow money and slow down how fast the economy grows. Because of this, our idea where the tax cuts from 2001-2010 stay forever is probably too hopeful; in that case, while we show that we will owe money equal to all the money we make in a year around 2030, it would probably happen even sooner. This worry is not as important in our idea where the tax cuts end because the money we owe in that idea stays the same. (For the same reason, this worry is also not as important in our \"money fixing\" ideas, described below, in which we show what would happen if we spend less money each year.)\n\n## THE MONEY CONTROL ACT OF 2011\n\nThe Money Control Act of 2011, which stopped the fight about how much money we can owe in 2011, put a limit on how much money we can spend through 2021 that made us spend $900 billion less than we thought we would. We think that this limit will work. This is a hopeful thought (from a money-saving point of view) because the people in charge could just agree to spend more money in the future.\n\nThe Money Control Act also made a group of people from both sides to come up with a plan to spend $1.2 trillion less in the next ten years. Since we did not know what the group would suggest, we just split that $1.2 trillion in savings equally over the 2013\u20132021 period. Our ten-year thoughts use this idea. Our long-term thoughts, however, think that whatever makes us spend $1.2 trillion less in the next ten years will not make a difference in later years. This is a careful thought, since it is very unlikely that any plan to spend less money could have a big effect through 2021 and no effect after that. The group's failure does not change this because, under the big rule, the large amount of money they were supposed to find is just replaced by the same amount of money in automatic spending cuts, mainly to programs. We think that those automatic cuts will lower the amount of money by the same amount over ten years but will have no effect in later years, which is still a safe thought.\n\nIn short, it is hard to tell what the long-term effect of the big rule will be. The two big questions are whether its caps on spending will be followed by the group and whether its automatic cuts will have an effect on later years, and there is no way to know the answers to those questions today. Our thoughts are hopeful (lower money) on the first question and safe (higher money) on the second question.\n\n## MONEY CHANGES\n\nIn chapters 6 and , we talk about the effect on our thoughts of lowering money by a big amount (in the case where the tax cuts end on time) or a bigger amount (in the case where the tax cuts are kept). In each case, it is not likely that such changes would be made all in one year, and in many cases our ideas are for changes to be brought in slowly. For easy understanding, though, we think an improvement in the balance by a big amount (or a bigger amount) that starts in the future and continues in every year after that. This may be a safe thought, since our ideas could be used tomorrow, in which case the start period could begin soon (although it would still last for several years). On the other hand, it is more likely that any big plan will not be used for several years and then will need years to start, so a middle start date of the future seems reasonable.\n\n* * *\n\na The level at which the AMT applies is not itself linked to prices going up. Sometimes, the group changes the level to take prices going up into account, protecting most middle-class homes from having to pay the AMT. These \"fixes,\" though, are always temporary, so if one were to end without being replaced by another, the level would go back to its previous, lower level, right away affecting many middle-class taxpayers.\n\n# _Notes_\n\n## SHORT NAMES\n\nBEA | Big Economic Group  \n---|---  \nCBO | Big Budget Group  \nIMF | Big Money Fund  \nNBER | Big Research Group  \nOECD | Big Economic Group  \nOMB | Big Budget Group\n\n## START\n\n1.

No scary things, no horrors, no heroes getting hurt.\n\nI can't promise that there won't be any sad parts. But, scary things were not my job.\n\nMake it fun, exciting, make me think, don't make me scared. Open a window, watch the story inside. Close the curtains. Try the next house, look into the fridge, drop cold ice cubes down sleepy necks.\n\nThirteen different kinds. Sizes come after the recipe. Don't worry about what's inside, just how long it is. Three thousand best words, here please, and eight thousand or so there. Newspapers and magazines like to make the story fit the space. (Don't get me wrong, I like the game.) So some of the stories are long and some are short. Some are tight, others are loose.\n\nSome are old, some are new. Meet some old friends here. See if new friends say hello.\n\nIf I have to be clear, eight of these thirteen stories were asked for by different papers who only told me how long, not what to write. The other five stories are new, their length\u2014and what they're about\u2014was my choice.\n\nWhen the thirteen stories were ready to start, there was a question like always, \"Who goes first?\" Should the book start with the first story written? Did the first one get to go first?\n\nLeave it to luck, we said in the end, so we picked a random one.\n\n\"We,\" in this case, meant four of us having a drink before lunch. \"We\" are my wife, Mary, my son Frank, my book helper Andrew, and me.\n\nWe wrote the titles of the thirteen stories on thirteen sticky notes and folded them carefully, and put them into a big glass ice holder that was given to my wife and me by Penelope and Victor as a gift for our new home by the sea.\n\n(Mrs. Penelope is the boss of PE company, my book company in the U.S.A.)\n\nThe four of us took turns to mix the folded notes in the holder and pick one out.\n\nEach choice was unfolded, read and stuck in order onto a board. Thirteen notes.... three choices each, and the last one was mine.\n\nWe chose happily. Honestly, we thought we'd want to change the result. But to our surprise, it was good, so we didn't change it.\n\nThe stories are in a book exactly as we chose them from the cooler ... and yes, after that, we put a drink in the cooler ... and toasted to the choices ... what else would you think?\nRAID AT KI Place\n\n_Time has a funny way of making stories real. The story of a scary thing at KI Place\u2014an imaginary racetrack\u2014was made up for readers of_ The Times _newspaper in LO city in the 20th century. Years later the pretend story became real, when a pretend scary thing stopped the big horse race in AN place, EN country._\n\n_Things have changed a lot since Thomas had his big idea. At KI Place and in the book, money and things have been changed._\n\nOne afternoon, Thomas scratched his arm without thinking and decided that a horse wasn't worth betting on in the early afternoon race. Thomas sat in a big chair with a half-finished drink close by and a big color TV showing him the first race of the three-day meeting at KI Place. Only silly people, he thought happily, would be working in the hot July weather that was as hot as the desert. Smart guys like himself sat at home with the windows open and their shirts off, letting their beards grow while the hot afternoon turned into evening.\n\nIn winter, Thomas thought that only silly people tried to get to work through the snow and cold, while smart guys stayed warm in front of the TV, betting on the horses; and in spring there was rain, and in the autumn, fog. Thomas at thirty-four had made not working into an art and thought the idea of a full day's work was a joke. It was Thomas' wife who went out in all weathers to her job at the supermarket, Thomas' wife who paid the rent on the flat and left the exact money for the milkman. Eleven years with Thomas had made her happy, not mad, and practical. She had waited without feeling through his two times in prison and accepted that one day he would be back there. Her dad had been in and out all her childhood. She felt comfortable with small bad behaviors.\n\nThomas watched a horse race and felt bad about himself. He drank his last beer and thought everything he did was bad. He didn't have a lot of money and sometimes had to drink and smoke less. He wanted to trick people into giving him money. He used to sell fake tickets until the police caught him. He couldn't trick tourists anymore.\n\nHe suddenly had a great idea while watching another horse race. He was very happy and couldn't believe his own idea.\n\nThomas was not very smart.\n\nOn a Friday, Kevin, the boss of the horse race place, went to a meeting. Everyone in the meeting did not like each other. The horse race place was not doing well because of bad decisions.\n\nKevin was not the best choice for the job. He was the third choice and not as good as the first two. He was chosen to avoid arguments. Because of this, the horse race place had a not very good boss. Kevin was a nice man but not a good boss.\n\nThe meeting on Friday quickly became an argument.\n\n\"We need more security,\" said Benjamin firmly. \"It's the most important thing. Starting today.\"\n\nBenjamin was thin and had a serious face. He looked at everyone at the table. Rachel, in her usual slow voice, disagreed with him.\n\n\"Security costs money, my dear Benjamin.\"\n\nBenjamin talked down to Ryan, knowing that nothing made Ryan more angry. Ryan's face turned very angry, and the safety of the race place, like so much else, depended on a personal fight.\n\nRyan said, \"We need bigger walls, extra locks on all doors and twice as many police. Work must start now.\"\n\n\"Race people are not bad, my dear Ryan.\"\n\nCameron sighed inside. He found it boring enough already, on non-race days, to check everything, and he didn't like to follow the rules that already existed. Bigger walls would mean he could not climb over or through, but would have to walk the long way round. More locks meant more keys, more time-wasting, more trouble. And all for the sake of stopping the few people who tried to go from a cheaper to a more expensive area without paying. He thought he would very much prefer things to stay the same.\n\nThe anger grew around him, and the voices also. He waited patiently for a chance to speak. \"Er ...\" he said, clearing his throat.\n\nThe group that supported Ryan and the group that supported Benjamin both looked at him hopefully. Cameron was their way out; except when his idea was really good, when they both said no because they wished they had thought of it themselves.\n\n\"Extra safety would mean more work for our people,\" he said quietly. \"We might need to hire more people to handle it ... and after the big initial cost there would always be maintenance ... and ... er ... well, what bad thing can anyone do to a race place?\"\n\nThis weak argument calmed everyone down enough for both sides to stop arguing with their opinions still the same.\n\n\"You have a point about the people,\" Ryan said reluctantly, knowing that two extra people would cost a lot more than locks, and that the race place couldn't afford them. \"But I still think that better safety is very important and very much needed.\"\n\nCameron, in his relaxed way, privately disagreed. Nothing bad had ever happened before. Why should anything bad happen in the future?\n\nThe discussion continued for half an hour, and nothing was done.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, Thomas went to the races having taken some of his wife's holiday money from the best teapot. The trip was to check out the place, and Thomas, walking around with his greedy eyes wide open, couldn't stop himself laughing. It did cross his mind once or twice that his happy, solo way of doing things was a waste: the big boys would have had a big plan and would have aimed high in their serious way. But Thomas was a solo guy who stayed away from gangs because it felt like too much work; being bossed around all the time, and with no breaks in the future.\n\nHe drank small glasses of apple juice at different places and bet small amounts on the game. He looked at the horses in the parade ring and recognized those riders whose faces he knew from TV, and he watched the races closely. At the end of the day, with small winnings keeping him okay, he laughed his way home.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, Mrs. Alice sold two game tickets to Thomas, and hundreds to other people whom she knew as little. Her mind was not on her job, but on the pile of unpaid bills at her house. Life had been hard on her since her fiftieth birthday, taking away her looks, because of worry, and her husband, because of a woman. Left alone, divorced and without kids, she could have been okay living alone if not for the big drop in comfort. Her natural hope and good mood were slowly going away in the hard struggle to make ends meet.\n\nAlice looked longingly at the money she took through her game window. Lots of it passed through her hands each working day, and only a little of what people wasted on betting would, she felt, solve all her problems nicely. But being honest was a habit for life; and besides, taking from the game was impossible. The money from each race were collected and checked right away. If someone stole, it would be found out right away. Alice sighed and tried to accept that she might lose her phone.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Thomas dressed himself carefully for the job. His wife, if she was not at the supermarket, would have said no to the bright orange socks. Thomas, seeing himself in the bedroom mirror only up to his knees, was sure that the dark suit, simple tie and brown hat gave him the look of a proper race-going guy. He had even, without thinking twice, cut his hair a little, and shaved off his big mustache. Complete with a big binoculars case on his shoulder, he smirked at his new look with happiness and set off with a light step to catch the train to KI Hill.\n\nAt the racetrack, Major Kevin made his race-day check with his usual lack of attention. Lazy gaps in his management resulted also in the police arriving half an hour late and not enough; and not enough cards had been ordered from the printers.\n\n\"No worries,\" said Kevin, shaking it all off easily.\n\nMrs. Alice traveled to the racing place in a big coach, along with many friends. She looked out the window at the passing houses and thought about the cost of light.\n\nOn a Saturday afternoon at a time after lunch, she was busy giving out tickets and taking money, focusing on her work and feeling happy. She organized her money box, ready for the big race of the afternoon. There would soon be a lot of people waiting in line outside, and being quick and good at her job was not only her duty, but also something she was proud of.\n\nA little before the race, Cameron was in his office trying to figure out a problem with the pay for some workers. The phone next to him rang many times and he answered it while still thinking about the pay issue.\n\n\"Cameron,\" he said without thinking.\n\nA man with a different way of talking started speaking softly.\n\n\"What?\" said Cameron. \"Speak louder, please. There's too much noise here... I can't hear you.\"\n\nThe man repeated what he said in the same quiet voice.\n\n_\"What?\"_ said Cameron. But the man on the phone had already hung up.\n\n\"Oh no,\" said Cameron, and reached for the button that let him talk to everyone at the racing place. He quickly looked at the clock. It showed almost time for the race, and at that moment the horses for the race were being led to the starting place.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" said Cameron, his voice coming from all the speakers at the racing place. \"We have been told that there is something dangerous in the stands. Please leave quickly and go to the middle of the racing place while the police look for it.\"\n\nEveryone was shocked for a moment: then the big crowd moved like a river down the steps, up from the tunnels, out of the doors, running towards the safe open spaces on the other side of the racing place.\n\nThe places where people get drinks emptied quickly with glasses knocked over and broken in the rush. The lines for tickets disappeared instantly and the ticket sellers followed the crowd. The race officials left their high box quickly and the people who write about races ran to the exit without stopping to tell their newspapers. The people in charge could wait a little while. Dangerous things wouldn't.\n\nThousands of people quickly left the race place. Only a few stayed, and the most important was Kevin, a brave man who felt he had to stay.\n\nThe few policemen gathered outside the room where they weigh things, trying to look brave. They hoped it was just a trick, like it usually was. Their leader started to look for the danger and told Kevin to go somewhere safe.\n\n\"No, no,\" said Kevin. \"While you look for the danger, I'll make sure everyone's gone.\" He looked worried but went into the weighing room with a purpose.\n\nHe checked the room where the riders clean up, the judge's box, the picture room, the kitchen, the warm room, the betting place, the offices, the storage... He moved quickly from building to building, knowing where to look for anyone who might not know what was happening.\n\nHe didn't see any people. He didn't see any danger. He went back outside to the open area and waited for the slower policemen.\n\nAround the stands, a man named William was doing his big plan. He was happy about his trick earlier (he thought it was good enough for acting), and he moved quickly from bar to bar and other doors, filling his big empty glasses case with stuff. He thought it was funny how people forgot things when they were scared.\n\nTwice, he met policemen.\n\n\"Everything's fine in there, officer,\" he said each time, pointing back to where he had been. Each time, the policeman looked at his brown hat, dark suit, dull tie, and thought he worked at the race place.\n\nOnly his bright socks stopped him from getting away. One policeman saw the bright color between his pants and shoes and started to follow him slowly.\n\n\"Hey ...\" he said.\n\nWilliam turned his head, saw the policeman coming, got scared and ran. William was never the smartest man.\n\nOn the weekend afternoon at four o'clock, Kevin made another announcement.\n\n\"It looks like the danger warning was just another trick. \"It is now safe for everyone to go back to their seats.\"\n\nThe crowd started walking back and went to the snack bars. The barmaids went back to their places and started shouting loudly in surprise.\n\n\"Somebody took all the money!\"\n\n\"How dare they! They took our extra money, too!\"\n\nIn the ticket selling buildings, the ticket sellers were very shocked. Most of the money for the biggest race was gone.\n\nAlice looked with shock at her own empty money box. Shaking, she joined the loud voices. \"The money's gone.\"\n\nCameron heard report after report with a worried face. He knew no doors had been locked after the rush to the exit. He knew no safety steps had been taken. The racetrack wasn't ready for this. The big group would surely blame him. They might even let him go.\n\nIn the afternoon, he heard surprising good news from the police that a man had been caught and was now helping to explain why his binoculars case was full of used money notes, many of them with a new mark from a wet drink glass being used as a paperweight.\n\nOn Monday morning, Thomas appeared sadly in front of a judge and had to stay in jail for seven days. The big plan hadn't worked out after all, and they would surely send him to jail for more than nine months, this time.\n\nOnly one thought made him feel better. The police had tried all weekend to get information from him, and he had not said a word. Where, they wanted to know, had he hidden the most of his stolen money?\n\nThomas said nothing.\n\nThere had only been room in the binoculars case for a little of the stolen money. Where had he put the rest?\n\nThomas didn't say.\n\nThey told him it would be easier if he gave back the rest.\n\nThomas didn't believe it. He smiled and shook his head. Thomas knew from before that he would be treated better in jail if he had a lot of hidden money. He would be respected. He would be important. Nothing would make him tell.\n\nOn Monday morning, Major Cameron went with his red face to an urgent meeting of his big group and agreed without a fight with Benjamin's opinion that the racetrack security was bad.\n\n\"I told you,\" Benjamin said again and again. \"I warned you all. \"We need more keys. There are some good close-tight things for the money-boxes in the game place. I hear that all money can be kept safe really fast. I think we should put these things in right away.\"\n\nHe looked around the table. Ryan kept his eyes down and only made a face, and KH place decided to lock its doors now that the horse was gone.\n\nOn Monday evening, Alice had a big drink, turned on the TV and put her feet up. Next to her was a pile of letters, each with a check to pay one of her big bills. She sighed happily. She would always remember how shocked she was to see her empty money box. She would always remember how scared she was. She would always remember how relieved she was when she found out that everyone had been robbed, not just her. Because she knew it was one of the other sellers whose money she had picked up in the rush to the door. She had thought it was silly to take the money from her own place. She didn't know there would be another thief. It would have been silly to steal from her own place. And besides, there was more money at the other window.\n\nOn Monday evening, Kevin sat in his home thinking about the second search of KH place. All day Sunday the police had looked everywhere, but slowly, without fear, looking not for a big noise but a money place. Kevin had helped, but nothing had been found. The money was gone.\n\n\"Thomas must have had a helper,\" said the officer sadly. \"But we won't hear anything from him.\"\n\nKevin, still in his job, smiled softly at the memory of the past few days. Kevin, quick and brave, had made the most of the chance Thomas had given him. Kevin, who was always brave, had left on Saturday evening with the big win from the game place.\n\nHe leaned over the arm of his chair and patted his full case.\nDEAD ON RED\n\n_First shared here, \"Dead on Red\" is about a time in the past (in the late 20th century, to be exact) because the rules about bringing small guns from Europe to EN country were made tighter as part of a rule in the late 20th century._\n\nEmil, a man from FR country, was really scared of flying. Even pictures of airplanes, and especially the loud sound of still jet engines at airports, made his heart beat fast and made him sweat a little. So he traveled from his home in PA city by car and boat on his trips around the world, the slower trips actually fitting his careful nature better. He liked to plan his work carefully, thinking about every possible thing that could happen. He believed that getting scared and not knowing what to do when something unexpected happens was silly.\n\nEthan was a bad man, who hurt people without getting caught. He was a quiet person who didn't like to be noticed, but by the time he was a big boy, he had hurt many people, including businessmen, wives, and a child.\n\nEthan was, of course, a lot to handle. But he was also trustworthy, creative, and didn't have a kind heart.\n\nHe lost his parents when he was a small boy, and grew up in places where there were many kids like him. He had never felt loved, nor had he ever felt a strong friendship for anyone or anything (except a dog). Being in the army taught him how to use a gun, and being good at it, along with wanting to feel powerful, made him want to teach others how to use guns at a club, where people often talked about hurting others.\n\nEthan would get letters from someone he had never met, offering him \"chances\" to hurt people. But he would only say yes after doing a lot of research. Ethan thought he was very important. He didn't like being called a \"hit man\", which he thought was a rude word. He would only say yes to an offer when he was sure that the person who hired him could pay him, would pay him, and wouldn't feel bad about it afterwards. Ethan also made sure that every person who hired him had a strong excuse, and this was sometimes the deciding factor on whether he would take the job or not.\n\nAnd so it happened on a special Tuesday. Having a strong excuse and feeling confident about the job, Ethan got ready for a short trip to EN country.\n\nEthan's English, which was simple and not fancy, had helped him so far. Simple phrases like \"my car's broken down\" had kept him safe from people being too curious about him and had also let him stop his mission if he felt unsafe before doing the job. He had, indeed, already stopped twice at a late stage from the current job: once because of bad weather, and once because he didn't like the sickness excuse that was proposed.\n\n\"Not good,\" he said to himself.\n\nThe person who hired him, who had paid a lot of money in advance, was getting more and more upset about the delays.\n\nOn the Tuesday, however, Ethan, as confident about the excuse as he could be, having packed his bag and told the gun club that he would be away, started his journey in his simple white car to go to CA city to cross the cold waters of the EN Channel.\n\nAs usual, he took with him the tools of his job: small guns, ear protectors, and many certificates that proved he was a licensed teacher at a top-class PA city club. He carried everything in a locked suitcase, like photographers do. This was a time when people were still allowed to have small guns in EN country. If he had problems entering, he would have just gone home.\n\nEthan, a bad man, had no problems on this Tuesday in December. He drove happily through the sleeping fields of southern EN country, thinking about his bad plan.\n\nThat year, the horse racing scene in EN country was ruled by an unlikely team of a man from a gypsy family and a nobleman.\n\nJack (or Jack) had a special connection with animals that was like magic. To make Jack happy, racehorses would remember their old instincts and understand that being the leader was the goal of life. The leader of the group won the race.\n\nJack gave his horses the right food and exercise that was best for their hearts. He whispered secret words of encouragement to them while he prepared them for races. He was successful and most people admired him, but for Jack it was never enough. He always looked for a rider who would understand his horses. He looked for someone young, brave, talented and good.\n\nEvery year he watched and studied the new riders while he took care of his regular horses; and for five years he did not find what he wanted. When he did find it, he quickly made sure everyone knew it was his.\n\nSo, Jack surprised everyone in the spring of 1986 by offering to work with a happy-go-lucky amateur who had only raced for one season and hadn't won anything big. All the amateur had to do was get a professional license right away.\n\nRyan (he had red hair) heard Jack's offer on the phone and was just as surprised as everyone else.\n\nFirstly, not many contracts like this were offered to horse riders. Secondly, Jack already had two professional riders (without contracts) who were doing well, since Jack was fifth on the list of most successful trainers. Thirdly, Ryan, who had just finished school, was considered a beginner.\n\nBut Ryan, the \"beginner\", applied for a license right away.\n\nRyan, now a professional, met Jack in person for the first time when he went to check out the parade ring before the big race at SA park in April. Gabriel, at forty years old, was very confident. Some people laughed at him for letting a young lord who had never ridden a horse before race in a big event. People said bad things about Gabriel in the newspapers for not using his two good, loyal and angry jockeys and \"throwing away the chance of a golden trophy for a show.\" But Gabriel trusted his feelings and was not scared.\n\nYoung Ryan, meeting Gabriel before the race, thought he was a messy man with long hair and wished he hadn't promised to always do what the trainer said.\n\nThe two future friends shook hands in front of many people watching on TV, and Ryan thought he was just excited about the race. Gabriel, however, smiled to himself, and was the only one not surprised when his horse won the gold by a little bit.\n\nRyan had always been a good rider: he had spent all his free time as a teenager on a horse, although his parents wanted him to focus on school. His rich mom and dad were happy their son was a hobby rider, but did not like the idea of him being a professional. His mother complained.\n\nRyan thought being a professional was better. He wanted to do well at the race, so he tried really hard and felt a strange connection with the horse. He had never felt anything like it. His whole body reacted. He and the horse jumped over the obstacles together. He felt like he and the horse were one as they ran around the last turn and up the final hill. He felt the same strong will as the horse. When he won, he felt like he belonged.\n\nIn the winner's area, Gabriel and Ryan smiled at each other like they were part of a secret group. Gabriel knew he had found his man. Ryan was excited about his future.\n\nUp in the stands, the two jockeys who were not chosen watched the race and the win with increasing anger. One of them, David, felt his anger was right. \n\nGabriel was a tough boss (David thought), but his horses raced often, were well trained, and had given him\u2014David\u2014a good life and many girlfriends for the past five years. David's love for girls, once a big talk at the race place, was now seen as normal; and on the other hand, \"The Rock\"'s dark good looks were known to attract girls. David's anger at losing the big race and the money he would have gotten was small compared to the hurt to his pride.\n\nHe never thought that if he, and not the winner Ryan, had been riding the horse, it might not have won.\n\nNathan, the helper rider at the stable, was angry for The Rock. Nathan, who would never be a star himself, liked being The Rock's friend, always feeling the same things, the same wins, the same complaints. He was as angry as David at being replaced, and even more so. David felt good about Nathan's strong liking for him and didn't see its dangers.\n\nOn the Monday after the big April race, Gabriel looked at the angry faces of his two riders as they came to his stable yard for the morning exercise and training session.\n\nHe said to them in a straight way, \"As you've probably guessed, Ryan will be my first rider from now on. You, David, can stay here as a training rider, which you're good at, and ride the occasional race, or if you want you can try for top stable rider with a different trainer.\"\n\nDavid listened in unhappy silence. Being Gabriel's first rider had been a big thing in the racing world. The lower place the trainer was giving him not only meant a big drop in respect and money, but also that he would not be as attractive to girls. He liked to be in charge of girls. He liked to show them who's boss and make them ask for love. He felt better than them. He often wore his rider boots, seeing them as a sign of strength.\n\nFinding a job with the same respect was not really an option: there weren't enough good rider jobs. David looked straight at Gabriel's uncaring decision to lower him and felt the first feeling of strong hate.\n\nNathan asked in a strong way, \"What about me, then?\"\n\n\"You can keep doing what you were,\" the trainer told him.\n\n\"Just getting what's left? It's not fair.\"\n\n\"Life is never fair,\" Gabriel said. \"Haven't you noticed?\"\n\nGabriel's old ways turned out to be very right. Ryan and Jack's horses excited each other on track after track while the main part of the jumping race ended towards summer. The cheers for one win hardly stopped before they started for another. The owners of the horses were very happy: new owners offered horses every day. By the time the next long season started in August, the trainer had rented a lot of extra barns and the rider was happily humming to himself as he drove his car from one win to another. Through September and October and November it seemed he could do no wrong. He was the best rider.\n\nHis parents became happy with his success and started to brag about him, but his two older sisters, who were not married, got jealous of his fame. He still lived in the family house in the big city, which his fancy mother liked more than walking around fields on weekends and fighting with wetness in an old cottage. Ryan liked his mom's city comfort while planning to buy his own house with his prize money, but not necessarily close to Jack. The lives of rider and trainer stayed separate as before their team came together at SA place, but the feelings between them stayed the same. They always smiled the same understanding smile, but they never drank together.\n\nRyan\u2014friendly, simple, kind\u2014didn't hang out much with the other riders, who were amazed by his great skill, and he happily ignored the bad feelings he saw in David's eyes, and the same copycat feelings in Nathan's. Because there were more horses in the barn, David, Ryan thought happily, still rode a lot of races, even if not on the best horses, and even if not with the same surprised and respectful coverage in the news. It wasn't his fault, he told himself, that Jack had picked him and given him such a great and satisfying chance.\n\nHe didn't know that it was the end of his strong love life that made David most angry; and David didn't realize that it was his constant complaining that made women not like him. For the first time in his life girls liked Ryan, who thought their flirting was funny: and his amusement made his angry rival more upset.\n\nIn December, when David broke some small bones in his foot in a race fall, Ryan sent him a message to say sorry. David thought it was mean and didn't reply.\n\nRyan kept his car in the city street outside his parents' house and drove from there each day to wherever he was going to race. Usually he went north on a road which took him through tall black fences into the grassy big park. \n\nOn one Friday morning in December, while he waited, humming, at the stop light, a man approached his stationary car and tapped on the passenger side window. He was dressed as a tourist and carried a large street map, to which he hopefully pointed.\n\nRed Millbrook pressed a button and obligingly opened the electrically controlled window. The tourist advanced the map politely into the car.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" said the tourist, \"which way to Buckingham Palace, please?\"\n\nHe had a foreign accent, Red Millbrook thought fleetingly. FR country, perhaps. The jockey leaned towards the window and bent his head over the map.\n\n\"You go ...\" he said.\n\nEmil Jacques Guirlande shot him.\n\nTruth to tell, Emil Jacques enjoyed killing.\n\nHe took pride in being able to bring death so quickly and cleanly that his prey hadn't even a suspicion of the need for fear. Emil Jacques considered he would have failed his own high standards if ever he'd seen eyes widen with desperate fright or heard just the beginning of a piteous plea. Some assassins might take pleasure in their victims' terror: Emil Jacques, for a murderer, was kind.\n\nRed Millbrook had looked exclusively at the map held half open in Emil Jacques's left hand. He hadn't had time to see the Browning 9mm pistol with its efficient long silencer slide smoothly out from within the map's lower folds. Emil's right hand had a speed and sweetness of touch with a gun that no magician could have bettered.\n\nThe fire-hot bullet instantly destroyed Red Millbrook's brain. He felt nothing, knew nothing, made no sound. The faint \"phut\" of the Browning lost its identity in the beat of the radio's music.\n\nWithout hesitation Emil Jacques withdrew his map, the pistol again hidden in its folds. He made a gesture of thanks in case of onlookers and walked casually away.\n\n\n\nNot too bad, he thought. It was a bit tough in the end, but it worked out.\n\nIn the late fall, when he was asked to do the job, he checked out the area without any tools, learned about the daily life of the person he was supposed to watch, and saw that there were a lot of traffic lights at one entrance to HP park. With a timer, he drove the same path that his target would normally take many times. He learned how long the longest and shortest waits at the traffic lights could be. Ryan usually left home at different times but almost always took the park way to avoid traffic. Sometimes, he was stopped by the lights. Every time the lights stopped him, he sat in his car without any protection. Emil knew he could do it, if he was quick.\n\nHe practiced at home with a map and a toy gun through his own car window until he could do the pretend attack in just a few seconds. He then said yes to the job and in November, when he got the first part of his payment, he moved from DI place to NE city with his toy gun suitcase declared and cleared.\n\nVery quickly, things didn't go as planned. Ryan left LO city and went to SC country for a two-day race, and then took a long time coming back south, staying with friends and owners while he won races all over the north. Emil waited in LO city and felt open and unsafe. When Ryan did finally come back to his parents' house, the weather turned very bad with strong winds, hail, and lots of rain. It was the type of weather that no tourist would want to walk around in, asking for directions with a map.\n\nFinally, Emil read a racing newspaper carefully, and with the help of his language book, realized that the sick excuse of his customer was not safe anymore. He also noticed that the lady at the small hotel's front desk was starting to like the quiet guest with the foreign accent. Emil stopped his plan completely and carefully went home.\n\nIt was three weeks later, when the weather was cold but sunny on a Friday morning in December, that Ryan stopped at the traffic lights and fell asleep forever.\n\nThe shock that hit the racing world surprised Emil in FR country. He hadn't realized how much the BR country people loved their sports stars, and he was surprised to hear that he (the attacker) would be in big trouble (at least) if found. A fund was being set up, with a lot of support at every racetrack gate, offering a big reward for the attacker's capture.\n\nEmil sat at his usual hidden table in the caf\u00e9 near his apartment and slowly, word by word, translated the nice words said about the young star in the English racing news. Ethan made a face and felt sad.\n\nThe big man, who had a large apron and thick mustache, stopped at Ethan's side and shared his thoughts. \"Only a bad person,\" he said, looking at Ryan's nice picture, \"would hurt such a good guy.\" He sighed about the bad things in the world, adding, \"And there's a letter for you, Sir.\" He gave Ethan a funny look and a poke in the side and brought out a letter from beside the cash box. The big man thought the letters he sometimes gave to his regular customer were secret notes from ladies looking for fun.\n\nEthan always took the letters with a wink, never telling his host the truth: and this way, at the end of a three-step chain he got messages and sent them. The letter that evening had the rest of the agreed money for the job on Ryan: no smart person ever risked not paying what they owed to a bad guy.\n\nIt could have been guessed that the smart city police boss in charge of finding Ryan's bad guy would never be friends with Jack. Jack was a man who trusted his gut and had a great accountant. Trusting his gut won the races, the accountant made his client rich. Jack worked on a deep level of feeling. The policeman and the accountant worked on facts and logic.\n\nThe police boss thought all racing people were a bit shady and Jack thought the same about the police. The police boss didn't believe Jack's real sadness. Jack wondered how such a slow-thinking boss had gotten that job.\n\nThey met in Jack's office at the horse house, watched closely by a local top detective who seemed mostly worried about \"territory.\"\n\n\"Who cares where he was hurt,\" Jack yelled. \"Put your silly heads together and find out who did it.\"\n\nOne by one the two top guys did put their heads together, but without any sudden smart idea. They talked a lot to the two ladies who'd been behind Ryan's car at the stoplight, who'd honked at him when the light turned green, and had gone to yell at him, and had found his hurt body and would never have peaceful sleep again.\n\nThey hadn't seen anyone, they said. They had been talking. There weren't many people in the park. It was winter.\n\nEthan had left no clues in Ryan's car: no fingerprints, no threads, no hairs. The bullet, hopefully found in the car, didn't match anything on anyone's record, nor ever would. Careful Ethan never hurt anyone with a gun he'd used before. Despite everyone's hard work, the mystery stayed unsolved.\n\nThe big boss in the city started to think differently about Gypsy Joe and slowly began to respect him. He understood that this man, standing with him in his windy yard, was the last person to hurt the gone rider; and with that, he could ask for his help. He didn't believe in seeing the future or telling fortunes, but one never knew. And Gypsy Joe had found Red from nowhere: had seen his hidden talent and let it shine. What if... just what if the gypsy's understanding could do what good detective work couldn't.\n\nThe big boss shook his head to get rid of such thoughts and said in a practical way, \"I've asked people, you know. It seems most of the riders were jealous of Red and the bookmakers hoped he'd fall, but that's different from actually hurting him.\" He stopped. \"I'm told the person who disliked him most was his second person, David, your former number one.\"\n\n\"He couldn't have done it,\" Gypsy Joe said sadly. \"He has a perfect excuse.\"\n\n\"He couldn't have done it,\" the big boss agreed, \"because at the relevant time he was in the hospital here on crutches, getting help for his broken foot.\"\n\n\"And his close friend, Nigel, couldn't have done it either, because he was here under my very eyes, riding my horses when Red ...\" Gypsy Joe stopped, his voice closing up. The loss and ruin of the high talent he'd let loose on his horses brought Gypsy Joe closer to tears every day than he would have thought possible. He knew he would never find another Red: a match like that to his horses happened only once in a trainer's lifetime.\n\nWhen the big boss had gone, Gypsy Joe's dislike for Red's hurter continued to burn like a slow constant fire in his heart. He would know, he thought. One day, in the way that things became clear to him, he would know who'd hurt Red, and he would know what to do.\n\nHis horses, meanwhile, had to race in their planned races. The owners called asking for it. Life had to continue. David's broken foot healed quickly and Gypsy Joe, with doubts he didn't fully understand, let his former number one take his old place again.\n\nThe horses missed Red. They won races, but not happily in big numbers. The best days were gone. Some people at the race cheered; some cried. Gabriel was sad.\n\nIt was at the gathering to remember Red's life that The Rock made a big mistake. In the church, not knowing that Gabriel was standing quietly behind him, David turned his head to Nathan and smirked.\n\nGabriel first saw the mean look on his face and felt only simple disgust. But as the day went on and through the night, he figured out what he was looking for.\n\nIn the morning he called the big city boss.\n\n\"A paid bad guy?\" the boss asked with doubt. \"Those kind of bad things don't happen a lot, you know. It's not likely that this is one.\" He thought to himself that most bad things happened in families\u2014family stuff\u2014quick decisions\u2014and he knew most were solved. Often, bad stuff was the reason for deaths that no one could explain, but not this time, he didn't think. There was no sign of it. And no sign of it being about big people fighting, which was normally big and led to someone being caught, either right there, or soon after.\n\n\"So, where does that leave you?\" asked Gabriel.\n\n\"Looking at what's going on inside Red's family. We think the young man knew the person who did it. We think the person who did it knocked on the window and the young man, knowing who it was, opened the window to talk. The sisters are no angels ...\"\n\n\"I don't believe it.\" Gabriel was sure. \"Red's family didn't do it. I saw a mean, bad look in David's eyes at yesterday's gathering. You are not thinking enough about how strong hate can be. Nearly everyone does. I saw him happy about Red's death. I'm sure he had him killed. I'll go after him and make things happen.\"\n\nThe boss, not sure what to believe, and not sure that Gabriel's thinking could be trusted, told him weakly, \"Be careful, then, there's a bad guy out there.\"\n\nGabriel took the warning seriously but went around everyone he thought might show him a clue. No one gave him clear directions to a bad guy but at last, when his search had become the talk of every race, someone told him to look right in front of him. Nathan, he eventually found out, had a brother who'd once been in trouble for taking cars that weren't his. Not really helpful, he thought. A kitten when he was looking for a lion.\n\nWith nothing but a strong feeling to keep him going, Gabriel started asking David questions. Lots and lots of questions, again and again and day by day.\n\n\"How did you find the bad guy? Who did you ask?\"\n\n\"How did you give him money? Did you send him a note?\"\n\n\"He'll ask for more things from you, right? He'll want more and more.\"\n\nHe kept talking.\n\nHe was not nice to David's feelings, but kept asking him to join games. The questions were hard for David, but he needed the game money. His hands started to shake. Gabriel, who was always around, said in his ear, \"Bad guy.\"\n\n\"I didn't do it,\" David yelled, scared.\n\nGabriel, no matter what, said \"Bad guy\" again and again, and did not let his friend feel calm.\n\nDavid and Nathan went to WA place for games together, Nathan driving his own car and hoping David would give some gas money. It seemed like the old days were gone, when David would always pay for their things. David, Nathan thought sadly, was not the hero he admired anymore.\n\nDavid's good looks had quickly lost their charm since the smooth skin on his face had become loose and not bright. The pride of the boots no longer walked with confidence from the game room to the show ring. The master no longer hit his leg with his game stick. People who knew David from before hardly recognized him as the big guy of the games, the one who would make moms worry about their kids.\n\nDavid, under Gabriel's hard words, was feeling very bad.\n\n\"He's sure I did it,\" David said sadly. \"He never leaves me alone. He wants to know who hurt his precious boy and I can say again and again that I don't know and he just keeps asking.\"\n\nNathan looked at his friend who was not doing well. He\u2014and everyone at the game place\u2014could clearly see David's strong personality and skill fading. The horses with him were not doing well.\n\n\"You can't tell him who hurt Red because you don't know.\" Nathan was getting frustrated. He had said the same thing many times.\n\n\"I tell him again and again I don't know,\" David said. \"He thinks I just went to someone who has a gun and said, 'Hurt Red for me.' He's so simple it's sad.\"\n\nGabriel, who was not simple or sad, watched David's weak games that afternoon and had to say sorry to his owners.\n\nEven after asking Gabriel many times, Jack still didn't know who had hurt Red. Jack started to think that Gabriel really didn't know who had done it. He still thought that Gabriel had done something wrong.\n\nAfter a long day, the coach told Gabriel that it was harder to find good owners than good riders (except for Red). He had given Gabriel many chances, but the owners were very unhappy and it was time to say goodbye. Gabriel didn't say anything, but he was very angry and didn't think he had done anything wrong.\n\n\"What about me?\" asked Nathan. \"Do I get Gabriel's job? The main rider?\"\n\n\"No, you don't. You're not ready. If you want, you can keep doing what you were doing.\"\n\n\"It's not fair,\" Nathan said.\n\nOn the way home from the race, Gabriel was very angry about losing his job.\n\n\"Find that bad man for me,\" Gabriel said. \"Tell him I need his help again.\"\n\nNathan drove the car in a worried silence. With blonde hair and light eyebrows, Nathan felt sad about Gabriel. He had liked Red, and working for Jack had been good, all these years. A steady job, better than most...\n\n\"Do it,\" Gabriel said again. \"Tell your brother to fix it again.\"\n\n\"It'll cost you,\" Nathan said weakly.\n\n\"Just do it,\" he was told.\n\nNathan's brother, who had gotten in trouble before, knew someone who could help. In early winter, the owner of Ethan's local caf\u00e9 gave him a sweet-smelling pink envelope.\n\nThe owner smiled widely, nudging Ethan in the ribs. Ethan smelled the scent and with many a wink put the note away to read later.\n\nEthan later stood at the window of his nice tall apartment and thoughtfully watched the small boats busy below on the river. The pink envelope had only a small black and white picture of Jack, with his name, address, age and job written in pencil on the back. Underneath, in small letters, he read, \"Gabriel, rider.\"\n\nBecause he had hurt a popular boy, Ethan had started to be interested in the sport. He sometimes bought BR country racing newspapers and tried to read them, so he needed a FR country-English dictionary less and less. His English, like in a fast horse game, got better and better.\n\nHe thought about hurting Gabriel Joe.\n\nUsually, he said no to two bad things in the same small friend or work group, thinking that doing it twice made it more risky. Also, two bad things asked by the same person so quickly scared him a lot. But David, a horse rider, had paid him quickly for hurting Ryan and probably knew he would ask for the same amount of money again.\n\nEthan cared nothing about why his clients wanted him to do bad things, which he thought were mostly because of wanting more things, wanting someone too much or hating someone. He only cared about doing his work well, getting away safely and keeping the money in a secret way. He didn't care about Ryan or Gabriel Joe Smith. Ethan was always a cold soldier for hire.\n\nHe decided it would be safe enough to check out the Gabriel Joe situation. So, with a small bag (no dangerous tools) he went across the big water with his car, feeling sick because of a big winter storm at sea. Early February snow fell and stayed in south EN country, stopping horse games, the weather again helping to keep Ethan's target safe.\n\nEthan could only sometimes check on Gabriel Joe's daily life without making people notice him, but he learned the trainer's morning routine of going up by car to the white snowy hills and watching the long line of horses running past for exercise up a track that could be used in any weather. He listened to the horse boys' talk in the local places to eat and drink in the evenings and learned their colorful language, along with the general flow of life around horses.\n\nHe learned that Gabriel Joe's love for his horses included a late-night visit to each of them, to see that all were comfortable and at peace, and one evening he came to the stable yard and stopped at a hidden distance, watching.\n\nGabriel Joe came out of his house alone at ten o'clock and checked on his horses, leaving his much-loved horses safe until morning. At ten the next evening he checked on them again, and at ten the next evening, again.\n\nIt was there, in the quiet yard, Ethan decided, that one night soon a quiet end would come out of the dark.\n\nDuring the night of Ethan's decision the snow melted and made EN country brown and green, and next day Gabriel Joe took his racing horses to SA park.\n\nThe two months since Ryan's bad end had not made Gabriel Joe's sad feelings less, and he couldn't stop remembering that it was here on this hard track that the red-haired boy's special talent had first fully shown. While he watched his friends run and play in FE month, Gypsy Jack missed the old times and promised to keep looking for David The Rock. No matter how long it took, he would make the mean guy feel sorry and tell the truth.\n\nDavid, that afternoon, had only one race to run (given by a small-time trainer). He was almost last because his mind was not on the race. He spent his time looking angrily at Gypsy Jack, hoping for an answer from Nathan's brother.\n\nEthan, sure that neither man would know him, went to the SA park races and stood close to both.\n\nGypsy Jack, his target, looked briefly at the neat young racegoer reading his racecard six feet away and felt no bad feeling that his family would have expected. Gypsy Jack looked at Red's wrongdoer and didn't know him.\n\nAn hour later, on the stands before the fifth race, Ethan rubbed shoulders with David The Rock and heard him complaining to Nathan about mean trainers, slow mails and the unkindness of ungrateful people.\n\nEthan, not liking him, decided to ask for more money.\n\nWhen the idea got to David three days later, he was very angry; the big payment he had to make right away would use all of his savings. But Gypsy Jack's pointing out his wrongs was making him upset and crazy, and he would do anything, he thought, to stop the whispers in his ears. \"You did wrong. You did wrong. You did wrong. Admit you did a bad thing.\"\n\nDavid sent all the money asked for, leaving nothing for later. He was foolishly risking that the bad guy would not come looking for more money after the thing was done.\n\nA week later, at the beginning of MA month, the man of the caf\u00e9 gave two letters to his lucky customer with the busy life. The customer winked and smiled and thought about moving to a different mailbox.\n\nEthan took his letters home. One, a thick sort of package, had all of David's hard-earned savings. The other asked for the quick hurt of a big person in BR place, to happen within ten days, before an important vote.\n\nEthan stood by his high window and looked down on the river. Care told him that BR place was too soon. His unknownness, he thought, depended in part on the rareness of his acts.\n\nHe had gotten away with Red's wrong easily, but the search would be stronger after Gypsy Jack's. A bigger reward might make the scary act worthwhile, but another scary act in BR city, his third in a short time, might make the police notice him. He didn't want that at all.\n\nStill, the offer from BR city was a big reward for quick work, and he thought he was the _best._\n\nThe next day, he put Adam's money in the bank, spent the morning teaching with new guns at the gun club, and in the afternoon and evening drove across BE country to BR city. He would check out the job in BR city, he decided, and would say yes or no before going to EN country to stop Gypsy Joe. He would be careful, he thought, and go one step at a time.\n\nHe spent three slow days in BR city following a man around the big building, finding that the man was hardly ever alone and even in the bathroom had many guards. What was worse, there was a loving wife and lots of smart children with little sharp eyes. Children were a problem for people who did scary things.\n\nEthan, in a hurry and feeling the heat, unusually said yes to the BR city job in a letter without clearly planning his attack in advance, sure he would think of a good plan in plenty of time. Meanwhile, as he waited for the BR city money to arrive, he would finish Gypsy Joe: he would spend the weekend in EN country, earning the Adam money. He started on this plan but almost at once things started to go wrong. Even before he'd left the city, his car stopped working. Ethan was upset.\n\nIt was Friday morning. He was told his car would be fixed by Monday lunchtime. Ethan was very upset.\n\nHe went into a travel agent's office to look at his choices and found himself talking to a kind older woman who liked her young customer and gave him lots of helpful ideas.\n\nDid Mister want to spend the weekend in EN country? Well, of course, he must _fly._\n\nThe BE country airplane company, had many flights every day to HE airport.\n\nThe kind woman pointed to a poster on the wall showing a lot of big airplanes, all taking off.\n\nEthan shuddered and began to sweat.\n\nMister could rent a car at HE airport. She, the kind woman, would arrange it.\n\nEthan was very brave and said he would go by sea, by car ferry, as he had planned. The kind woman said the delay meant that he would miss the boat he'd planned to take, but he could go later by a different route and she, the kind woman, could arrange a rental car to meet him at DO place.\n\nEthan agreed.\n\nWith a happy smile, Alice was busy with the phone while her customer cleaned his forehead.\n\nShe told him in a nice way that soon he would be able to go to EN country through a big hole. The digging would start this year. Wasn't that great? In one moment, Ethan went from being scared of flying to being scared of tight places.\n\nAlice gave him tickets and things to save his spot and a pass to get on the boat because he liked water.\n\nShe said, \"I'm sorry, but the trip takes a long time, but I've saved a car for you at DO place. I'm sorry about your car.\"\n\nEthan, still feeling a little scared, thanked her with a weak smile and paid her. Then he went by train to the coast. He took with him his suitcase and a bag for overnight, and he kept telling himself that if this new way of doing things looked too scary, he would go back and see Joe at a later, calmer time.\n\nHe got on the big boat, along with lots of other people, many of whom were going home with bags labeled \"No Tax.\" Ethan found a seat in the place where drinks are served and ordered water, and kept his suitcase close to him.\n\nThe big boat left its spot on a day in March, in the evening. At a little after six, the boat left the port and went faster towards the open water.\n\nA little while later, the boat sank.\n\nFROM THE OFFICIAL STORY OF WHAT HAPPENED, PUBLISHED BY THE QUEEN'S PAPER OFFICE.\n\n_On a day in March, the big boat for people and cars, named Big Freedom, left from a spot in the port at ZE place in the evening. The Big Freedom had a crew of 80 people and was carrying lots of cars and other vehicles._\n\n_About 459 people were on the boat for the trip to DO place. The Big Freedom left the port a little after six. The boat turned over about four minutes later. During the last moment, the Big Freedom turned quickly and only didn't sink all the way because it hit the ground in shallow water. The Big Freedom stopped with one side above the water. Water quickly filled the boat below the water level and lots of people and crew members lost their lives._\n\n_The Big Freedom turned over because it went to sea with its front doors open._\n\nThe big doors at the front were open because they were not closed after cars and other things were put in for the trip to DO city. No one checked if the doors were closed.\n\nThe ship filled with water and turned over quickly in a short time.\n\nThe part of the ship above the water was painted a bright red.\n\nRed like stop lights.\n\nRedder than Ryan's hair.\n\n_Red._\n\nIn EN country early in the morning on a day in March, David, crying, borrowed enough from Nathan to get a drink. He had no money, no job, and was scared of a bad man, so David blamed everyone else.\n\nWhen the ship turned over, Ethan's metal suitcase full of heavy things slid away from him. He tried to catch it, fell, and the last thing he saw was the wall of water that covered him.\n\nLate that evening, while the cold water was still moving around the ship that had sunk, Jack left his house and checked on his sleeping horses, just like he would do the next night, and the night after that.\n\nThe stars were bright.\n\nFor some reason, Jack felt calm.\nSONG FOR MONA\n\n_There are bad things that you can't go to jail or pay a fine for. There's no official bad thing called Hurting_ Someone's _Feelings. Being mean on purpose can happen more than just with hurting someone\u2014but being mean can be stopped by being nice._\n\n_\"Song for Mona\" is a new story about a very old bad thing._\n\nJessica went with her mom to the horse races and did not like it at all. Jessica was embarrassed by how her mom dressed, talked, and lived; that is, she did not like the old hat and tight coat her mom wore, did not like how her mom talked, and did not want to tell others that her mom took care of horses for a living. Jessica went with her mom to the first day of the big horse races\u2014one of the biggest races of the year\u2014only because it was her mom's sixtieth birthday, and Jessica wanted her friends to think she was nice. Even before the first race, she planned to get away from her mom as soon as she could, but she could not understand why so many people smiled at the woman she did not want to be near.\n\nMadison\u2014Jessica's mom\u2014loved her daughter and would not admit to herself that Jessica did not like her very much. Jessica didn't like Bella touching her and moved away from any try at a mom-like hug. Bella, if she thought about it, though she didn't often because it made her sad, could think Jessica's change from young rebellion to not liking her came from a certain big, happy, smooth-talking Patrick Vine in the local play group. He worked with old and beautiful things.\n\nPatrick, Jessica told her mom, came from a \"good family.\" Patrick, who spoke fancy English with no sound of Wales, soon had Jessica copying him. Jessica (he never called her Jessica) had grown tall and pretty and Patrick, although his parents had hoped for a rich wife, agreed to Jessica's rule of marriage first. He saw this as being good, not a trick.\n\nJessica, by then living away from home and working in a flower shop, told Patrick and his parents that her mom was \"odd\" and a \"loner,\" and didn't want to meet them. Patrick and his parents believed her, even though it made them mad.\n\nJessica didn't invite her mom to the wedding. Jessica not only didn't ask her but didn't even tell her that her only child would be walking up the aisle in a wedding dress. Jessica didn't let her mom have her big day of mom pride and happiness. She sent her a picture from a faraway place: \"Married Patrick last Saturday, Jessica.\"\n\nBella bravely put the picture on her shelf and toasted the match in a drink.\n\nIt wasn't until months later that Patrick met Jessica's mom, and saw for the first time the clothes, the voice, and the job; everything. He was, as Jessica had known he would be, scared. His thought, like Jessica's own, was to hide the embarrassment. They moved to the next town. Patrick did better in his job and Jessica joined a fancy tennis club. They wanted to be more social.\n\nBella, living as always in the small house that had once been Jessica's home, continued to ride her old bike morning and evening to work in a kid's horse riding school, where she looked after a row of hard-working ponies. One evening she rode into the stable yard to find the riding-school owner not alive on the ground of a heart attack, several children screaming and the stables on fire.\n\nBella handled it: saved the ponies, calmed the children, called the fire helpers, covered the scary body with her old coat and became a bit of a hero on TV and in the newspapers.\n\n\"Madison, mother of Mrs. Jessica, wife of a famous person.\"\n\nMadison, standing in her little house doorway, happily said on screen in her strong accent that she was \"very proud of her daughter Jessica.\"\n\n_Embarassing. Cringe._\n\nJessica wanted to show everyone that she valued her mom. That's why she said she would take her mom to see the horse races on her sixtieth birthday.\n\nOne morning after the horse races, Madison hummed a little song to herself as she took care of a brown champion jumping horse.\n\nShe hummed with her lips closed so that the dust from the horse's shiny coat would not go into her lungs. She hummed in the old way, and, like others, she spit from time to time.\n\nShe really liked her new bosses, who had found her because of the news about the fire at the horse school. After being without work for three weeks since the horses had been sold, she had opened her little house door one day to a knock and had found outside a man and a woman whom she recognized as the Olympic-gold-medal rider Oliver and his famous singer wife, the AM country and friendly Cassidy.\n\nOnce, people had thought that Oliver and Cassidy had got married quickly just to get attention. But, after four years of being together all the time, people found it hard to think of one without the other.\n\nThe famous pair had come in a big black car that had made many of the people on the plain street come out of their houses; and they were carefully followed by a driver in a black uniform and a careful bodyguard whose eyes moved around like a light looking for something.\n\n\"Mrs. Madison?\" Oliver asked.\n\nMadison just opened her mouth and nodded.\n\n\"Can we come in?\"\n\nMadison moved back into her little front room and her visitors followed. They saw a way of living very different from their own happy and rich life but they also saw that everything was clean and neat. Madison showed them to her two chairs near the fire and quietly closed her door.\n\nOliver, tall, thin and rich, looked slowly around the room with pink flower wallpaper, the floor covering, the blue pillows on the brown chairs, the flower curtains at the window. No money and no fancy things, he thought; but that didn't mean no love. He was good at knowing how much things were worth. He also knew about Mona's good work with horses. Some people said she was not very polite, but they also said she was helpful.\n\n\"My husband has horses that jump in shows,\" the singer said in a simple way. Dressed in normal jeans with a big cream-colored sweater, Charlotte, with messy blonde hair and soft pink lipstick, looked both casual and beautiful. Mona liked her a lot. Charlotte also liked Mona a lot. They both saw that the other was a good person.\n\nOliver and his wife said they had just bought a house with a place for three of his best horses not too far from town. Mona, who had read about it in the local newspaper, nodded. Oliver and his wife traveled a lot, they said. His wife also gave concerts. When they were away, they needed someone to live and take care of the horses. When Oliver took his horses to faraway places for competitions, he needed the same person to travel with them.\n\nThey thought Mona, even though she was not young, would be a good fit.\n\n\"I want to keep my little house,\" Mona said right away, meaning she wanted to keep her freedom.\n\n\"Of course,\" Oliver agreed. \"When can you start?\"\n\nSo Mona hummed as she took care of the best jumping horse (and the strong gray one and the most talented ten-year-old horse, the one who won an important prize) and she talked to them in the same way she talked to the smaller horses\u2014and many other horses before them\u2014but these three horses seemed to look down at her, as if she was just their helper, not their friend.\n\nMona, who was very wise, didn't hold it against them, just like she didn't hold it against Jessica and Patrick.\n\nThese two, finding out that people were laughing at them behind their backs, moved to another town and became important people again without having to talk about the fact that Jessica's mother worked with horses. (Mona had a funny way of saying it.) Patrick became a big auctioneer and acted like he was better than his customers. Jessica helped a group of local women organize big parties to raise money for charity.\n\nAs the weeks and months went by, Mona became more and more loyal to Oliver and his wife, but she just did her job when it came to their horses. Oliver was happy with his three horses as he trained them patiently every day. He really liked their strong spirits. He was thankful for having Matthew, who took care of his horses. Matthew always sent the horses to races with a strong will to win.\n\nOliver was known as one of the best horse riders in the country and he didn't tell anyone about how good Matthew was with horses because he was worried someone else might try to hire him.\n\nCharlotte paid someone to make her living area in the stable look nice, but Matthew, who didn't like fancy things, preferred to ride his bike from his small house every day. Charlotte let him do what he wanted.\n\nCharlotte also went to a place in LO city where she spent most of her time with music, not horses. She practiced and made music. She also had to try on costumes. She was okay with having a driver and a bodyguard because her insurance company wanted her to. She kept quiet when she wanted to say something.\n\nOliver drove himself to horse shows in a strong red car, and Matthew went ahead with the horses. Oliver signed a lot of autographs, got upset when he didn't win and always wanted to be perfect.\n\nEven though they were famous, Oliver and Charlotte liked to spend time alone together. They did not only love each other, but they also liked to argue loudly. They didn't argue about money or fame, but mostly about the stress from their work. Small things could make them argue. They would slam doors and throw things. People who heard them might think their marriage was over.\n\nBut it wasn't. They would cool down after arguing. Oliver would walk around loudly. Charlotte would play her piano very loudly. Then they would laugh. But their loud arguments made their cook leave and they never found a new one. Instead, they ate food from restaurants. They didn't eat very healthy but Oliver was still good at jumping over obstacles with his horse and Charlotte was a great singer.\n\nOne day, Matthew walked into a big argument to tell Oliver that one horse was not feeling well. Matthew was surprised and just stood there, listening to the noise.\n\n\"Don't just stand there,\" Oliver yelled at him. \"Make us some food for dinner.\"\n\n\"She's not the cook,\" Cameron yelled.\n\n\"She can make some eggs, right?\"\n\nSo Madison made egg meals. Madison made three egg meals because her bosses asked her to and ate with them at the table in the kitchen. Oliver smiled at her and then laughed.\n\nThey didn't really make a plan, but after that Madison sometimes cooked while the other two rested, and they started to argue less and less. Madison with her old face, her different way of talking, the smell of the farm on her clothes, all these simple things made her bosses' lives feel more real and peaceful until it was time for bed.\n\nMadison saw them as horses that needed her calming touch. Their fame in the outside world didn't matter to her: they were Oliver and Cameron, her people. Oliver and Cameron couldn't imagine life without her. The three of them fell into a routine that made them all happy.\n\nJessica and Patrick decided not to have children, and one of Jessica's many reasons was that Madison wouldn't get to be a grandma. Jessica would never have to explain Madison to curious and chatty kids.\n\nPatrick didn't like babies, little kids, teenagers, or any age in between. Patrick heard boys being rude to their dads and didn't like it. Patrick didn't understand why people would want to worry about medical problems, school costs, drug use, and false accusations. Patrick liked a quiet house, nice parties and money.\n\nPatrick started to act more and more important, and he also managed to forget about his wife's real family. Jessica made up a story about her family being rich and important and convinced herself it was true.\n\nAll five of them, Patrick, Jessica, Oliver, Cameron and Madison, lived one long summer in a way that made each of them happy. Each in their own way felt successful. Oliver won lots of prizes. Cameron's new music sold a lot. Madison, proud of the horses, spent money happily on new tires for her bike. The brown horse, the big gray one and the quick brown one made her proud.\n\nPatrick's auctions became big events: SO's and CH's paid attention. Jessica, tall and beautiful in fancy (borrowed) dresses, was in the colorful pages of big shiny magazines.\n\nMadison, simply proud of her daughter, cut out the growing number of pictures and kept them in a box along with many articles praising Charlotte's great singing and Oliver's beautiful horses.\n\nMadison wrote a simple note to Jessica telling her about her happy life with the Bolingbrokes, including cooking times in the kitchen. Jessica tore up the letter and didn't reply.\n\nBecause of her strong pride, which Jessica didn't deserve, Madison took her box on her bicycle one day when she went to work and showed the contents to Charlotte.\n\n\"This is your daughter?\" Charlotte asked, surprised.\n\n\"Isn't she beautiful?\" Madison smiled.\n\n\"It says here,\" Charlotte read, \"that she's related to the important people of FL place.\"\n\n\"That's just her way,\" Madison explained kindly. \"She was just Jessica by birth. Her dad was a horse helper, like me. He had an accident, poor man.\"\n\nCharlotte told Oliver about the pictures and out of curiosity Oliver wrote to Patrick\u2014care of PA and Co., Quality Sellers\u2014and invited him and his wife to lunch.\n\nJessica at once told Patrick she didn't want to go, but then thought again. To have met\u2014to have _had lunch_ with Oliver and Charlotte\u2014would give her a chance to talk about important people. Madison's existence could be completely ignored.\n\nMadison wished Oliver had asked her first, but in both men curiosity overcame doubt. On the day they had decided, the Vines in their big car drove into the big yard where the Bolingbrokes and Madison were waiting for them.\n\nOliver knew at once that he'd made a big mistake when he heard Jessica call her mother \"Madison,\" and saw her coldly stop Madison's try at a hug, but with good manners he ignored the awkward moment and moved everyone into the living room for a drink before food. Patrick, Oliver noticed with a frown, quickly looked over the furniture, guessing its value.\n\nMadison, staying back, was gently brought by Charlotte's linking an arm through hers. Charlotte too realized the occasion to be a bad one. Madison's reluctance had been right.\n\nMadison, trying her best, wore clean pants and a white shirt pinned above the top button by her most fancy dress item, a small pearl pin. Charlotte felt very sorry for her, and like Oliver, wished things were different.\n\nAfter awkward minutes of talk between the two men (mostly about the difference in selling furniture and horses), Charlotte with a fake smile moved her guests into the dining room where places at the table in silver and crystal had been set for five.\n\nJessica said, without thinking, \"So you're expecting another guest?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Cameron, confused. \"Just us.\"\n\n\"But,\" Bella's eyebrows went up, \"Isabel will be eating in the kitchen, right?\"\n\nEven Bella knew she'd made a big mistake when she saw the surprised looks on the faces of her friends. She tried to explain, \"I mean ... I mean ...\" but it was too late.\n\nPatrick tried to think of something\u2014anything\u2014to say.\n\nOliver, who was the quickest thinker, laughed and said, \"Cameron, my dear, Bella has a great idea. Let's all eat with Isabel in the kitchen, like we usually do. Let's pick up our forks and napkins and cups and go to the kitchen.\"\n\nHe picked up the things from his place at the table and signaled for the others to follow him. Then, with a big smile, he led everyone through the door into the big, cozy kitchen where he and Cameron usually ate with Isabel.\n\nBut lunch was difficult. Everyone was glad when the Vines left early, with their cheese still on their plates and their coffee untouched. Oliver said sorry to Isabel before the Vines' car had even left the yard, but Isabel, always forgiving, was the least worried of all.\n\nCameron led a busy life, as a singer and a wife. When they met, she was attracted to Oliver's good looks, his manners, and how good he was at riding a horse. She knew that it was her feelings for Oliver that made him feel the same way about her. People thought they would get bored and say goodbye, but they were wrong. The horse rider and the singer became good friends.\n\nWhen they met, Cameron had been travelling around her country, singing songs about the big river. She travelled by bus with her manager, musicians and other helpers. Everything she needed for her shows followed along. Everyone depended on her to be talented, energetic and popular, and she was. She could light up and make her audience feel excited.\n\nBut it was tiring. Oliver had almost tripped over her one night as she sat on a big box, outside the big bus that would take her to the next town, to the next rehearsal, the next crowd of fans.\n\nOliver, who we'll call Oliver, was there because someone thought it would be fun for Cassidy, who we'll call Charlotte, to ride a horse on stage in cowboy clothes. The boss, who didn't know much about horses, got a very energetic horse instead of a slow one. Oliver, who was staying with the horse's owner, was asked to help Charlotte. Because of his quick teaching, Charlotte's first time riding a horse on stage went well.\n\n\"Come with me,\" she said. \"We can find a horse to ride in every town.\"\n\nHe sat next to her and said, \"That's not the life for me.\"\n\n\"Is it too noisy and flashy for you?\"\n\nAfter the tour, she had moved to England to live Oliver's kind of life. But when that wasn't enough, she mixed her old ways with the new ones and still sparkled on stage in shiny clothes and made the crowds cheer. She always had music in her. She saw life's stories in sounds. One afternoon, after a bad lunch party, Charlotte played a sad song on her piano and told herself that one day she would get Joanie Vine, who we'll call Jessica, to appreciate her amazing mom.\n\nOliver, walking by, understood the music and what Charlotte was trying to say.\n\nHe said, \"Why don't you write a song yourself, especially for Mona? You used to write more.\"\n\n\"People like the old songs.\"\n\n\"But the old songs were new once.\"\n\nCharlotte made a face at him and played old songs because she didn't feel like writing new ones.\n\nMona, who we'll call Madison, tried to make Charlotte and Oliver feel better. They were both upset because their lunch party had gone so badly and Jessica had been very mean to her mom.\n\nMadison said she'd been used to it ever since Jessica hadn't invited her to her wedding. Oliver and Charlotte would have been very angry with Jessica if she was still there.\n\n\"Don't think about her,\" Madison told them. \"Maybe I couldn't give her enough when she was little. I didn't have much money, you see. Maybe that's it. And anyway,\" she added, being very smart, \"I'm not going to ruin her life now, am I, by showing up at those fancy parties she has and saying I'm her mom, am I? I wouldn't want you to do that, either. Let her be, if she's happy, that's what I say.\"\n\n\"You're a very good person, Madison,\" Oliver said.\n\nIt took a while, several weeks in fact, for Oliver, Charlotte, and Madison to feel comfortable again about having dinner in the kitchen. And during that time, the Bolingbrokes, who we'll call the BR family, were arguing loudly and throwing things as they did before. Madison, hearing Adam's voice loudly complaining and Charlotte's loud refusal, walked into the kitchen after work one day and stood there not liking what she saw with her hands on her hips.\n\nWhen she came, Adam and Charlotte stopped fighting for a little bit, then Adam asked, \"What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"Eating eggs?\" Madison joked.\n\n\"Oh no.\" Charlotte started to laugh. Adam left the room but came back with a smile and three cups of juice. Madison cooked eggs, and Charlotte told her that they were fighting about a long trip she\u2014Charlotte\u2014was going to take in AM country. She would be away for two months and Adam didn't like it.\n\n\"Go with her, boy,\" Madison said.\n\nWith calm and thought, they made a plan. Adam would do his work for the first month and travel with Charlotte for the second month, coming back home with her in a month we call after October. Madison would stay at their home, to take care of the place, and while he was away, Adam would get a helper to help her.\n\n\"It's all so simple.\" Adam said. \"Why did we fight?\"\n\nWhile they were still eating cheese and thinking about ice cream, their old friend who helps with important papers called (because they forgot) to get their names on some tricky money saving plans.\n\nAdam went to the front door to say hi to him and brought him into the kitchen, where he, like Adam, ignored the simple look of the third person at the table.\n\nMadison, speaking in a strong accent, right away offered to leave. The friend, being as nice as Adam, asked her not to. A person to see them sign was needed. Madison cleaned up the dinner and wrote her name on some lines.\n\n\"And now,\" the friend said in a fun way, \"now, Mrs. Watkins, how about some plans for you too?\"\n\nMadison, confused, asked about what.\n\n\"A will?\" the friend suggested. \"If you haven't made a will, let's do it now.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said Adam, who wanted to thank Madison for her signature without making her feel bad. \"Everyone should make a will.\"\n\n\"I did talk about it once,\" Madison said. \"Patrick wanted me to leave everything to Jessica.\"\n\nThe friend smoothly took out a simple will from his bag and smilingly wrote on it, from what she said, Madison's name and address.\n\nThen, with his pen ready, he asked her who she wanted to give her things to.\n\n\"What?\" Madison asked.\n\n\"The people you want to give your things to after you are gone.\"\n\n\"Like my bicycle,\" Madison nodded. \"Well ...\" She paused. \"... Well, Jessica wouldn't want my old bike. I'd just ask Charlotte or Oliver to give my old bike to someone who needs it. What if I just ask them to do what they want with my old stuff?\"\n\nThe helper wrote \"Charlotte Ward\" in the spot for \"only person to get things\" and he and Oliver went with Madison on her bike to the local bar on her way home and got two people there to see Madison's name, thanked by glasses of drink.\n\nCharlotte thought the least she could do for Madison was to give out her \"old stuff\" as Madison would have liked, but hoped not to have to do it. Oliver came back from the bar with a smile and took his wife to bed happy.\n\nWhen the time came, Charlotte went on her long trip in AM country. Oliver, though lonely, won a big horse race and was picked as Sportstar of the Year. Madison, traveling with Oliver to look after the horses, thought she'd never been happier.\n\nAt the end of the first half of Charlotte's trip, Oliver carefully settled Madison into the small room in the stable and checked that the stand-in helper (an old man even older than Madison) would come (on his own bike) every day to help with the horses. Madison with confidence sent Oliver off to join Charlotte and started to enjoy the next few weeks with the fridge full of food, the color TV, and not having to put coins in a machine to pay for electricity to cook with, or to keep warm. Madison in her own small house carefully paid for everything. She saved a little each week for \"rainy days.\" She had always managed on little.\n\nOliver, talking to Charlotte in AM country as they relaxed at the end of her big wins before starting the long trip home, suggested that they should give Madison more money when they got back.\n\n\"We already give her a lot for a helper.\"\n\n\"She's worth more,\" Oliver said.\n\n\"Okay, then.\" Charlotte yawned. \"And you need another horse ... The brave big gray's too old now, didn't you say?\"\n\nMadison, far away, cleaned up after the heavy smart gray and sadly knew Oliver would give him away soon. He was fifteen and the spring was leaving his legs.\n\nMadison felt hot and sick as she worked on the gray, but didn't mind. Like all healthy people, Alice didn't know when she was not feeling well.\n\nSeeing her red face the next morning, the old helper said he would take care of the horses, and she was to ride her bicycle to see the doctor. Alice felt bad enough to do as he said, and was happy to learn that she had a sickness called \"flu.\"\n\n\"There's a lot of it around,\" the busy doctor said. \"Go to bed, drink a lot, you'll soon feel better. Flu is caused by tiny bugs. I can't give you medicine to make it go away, as the usual medicine doesn't work against these bugs. Take something for your headache. Stay warm. And drink a lot of water. Tell me if you cough a lot. You're a healthy woman, Mrs. WA. Go to bed, rest and drink water and you'll be fine.\"\n\nAlice slowly rode her bicycle back to BO place and told her helper what the doctor said.\n\n\"You go to bed now,\" he said. \"I'll take care of the horses.\"\n\nAlice was happy to put on her warm night clothes and get into bed. The bicycle ride had made her feel much worse. She remembered she should take something for her headache, but she didn't have any. She slept and dreamt about the perfect horse race.\n\nThe old helper was too shy to go into Alice's little room, as her bed was very close to the door. He opened the door and talked with her in the morning and evening, and when she didn't seem to feel better after three days, he rode his bicycle to see the doctor himself.\n\n\"Mrs. WA? Flu takes time, you know.\" He looked at some papers in a thin file. \"I see she has a daughter, Mrs. VI. Let's ask her for help.\"\n\nBeing a nice man, he called Joanie himself to save the old helper's money.\n\n\"Flu!\" Joanie said. \"I'm sure Alice is fine, if you are taking care of her.\"\n\nThe doctor didn't look happy. \"She needs some simple care. Change her sheets. Make her cups of tea. Give her orange drinks, or even apple juice. Things like that. It's very important she drinks a lot. If you can ...\"\n\n\"I can't,\" Joanie said, cutting him off. \"I have meetings all day. I can't cancel them.\"\n\n\"But your mother ...\"\n\n\"It's too difficult,\" Joanie said firmly. \"Sorry.\"\n\nThe doctor, shaking his head, wrote Jessica's phone number on a card and gave it to the horseman.\n\nThe next day, the horseman called Jessica and told her that Madison was the same, but he thought she needed her daughter.\n\n\"Why doesn't Charlotte look after her?\" Jessica asked. \"She likes her well enough.\"\n\nThe horseman explained that Mrs. Charlotte was coming home from AM country, but wouldn't be back for two more days.\n\n\"Two days? That's okay then,\" Jessica said, and hung up the phone. She felt relieved. The thought of caring for her mother made her feel sick.\n\nMadison, not unhappy, lay in bed without wanting to eat or drink. She thought she would get better: meanwhile she'd sleep.\n\nWhen the Charlottes came back, Charlotte went into her room, which was hot and smelly, with Madison in and out of sleep on the bed. Charlotte did what she could, but worried, she and Oliver called the doctor. He came quickly and, after spending time with Madison, called for a help car and told Charlotte and Oliver, \"But I _told_ her, I _insisted_ she should drink. She says she hasn't drunk anything for a week. She hasn't had the energy to make a cup of tea.\" He was very sad. \"I will have to tell Mrs. Penelope that we have a big problem here ... May I use your phone?\"\n\nJessica, as expected, was not worried and said she was sure her mother was in good hands. The doctor was very sad and, even with all the help, and Charlotte's prayers, Madison left us quietly and died late that night in the hospital.\n\nThe hospital told Jessica about the death, not the Charlottes. It was the doctor who told Oliver, \"So sad, poor lady. If only she'd drunk. People don't understand the danger of not drinking ...\"\n\nHe was sad, Oliver thought: but Madison had not listened to his advice.\n\nOliver and Charlotte sat in the kitchen and were sad for their missing friend.\n\nWhen the old horseman told them about the doctor and himself calling Jessica without results, the Charlottes' sadness turned to anger.\n\n\"Jessica _hurt_ her.\" Charlotte was very angry. \"She really hurt her.\"\n\nAdam thought that Jessica didn't mean to: didn't know how her carelessness would turn out. No one would say she did something bad, even if it was by mistake, or even worse. No one would ever talk about it.\n\nAdam, remembering Madison's simple wish, decided to ask Madison's next door neighbor right away about what to do with Madison's \"things\" that she gave to Cameron. If the neighbor wanted them, they would have a good place. Leaving Cameron sad in the house he drove his car into town and found a van of Patrick's company\u2014\"Patrick's Quality Helpers\"\u2014parked outside Madison's little home, with workers carrying out her sad things and furniture, to take them away.\n\nMadison's neighbor, with rollers in her hair, slippers on her feet and a pretty apron over her dress, stood cold out in the November street, looking upset.\n\nAdam stopped the workers and talked to the neighbor.\n\n\"Madison had not been gone long,\" she said upset, \"when Jessica herself came to look through her mom's things. I think she didn't find what she was looking for. She was throwing things around and she drove away mad. That's why they're clearing out the house so fast now. They're not being nice. Madison left her home book with me, see, and the home money for when she's been away at your place. You don't think that's what they want, do you? It's not very much. What should I do about the home money?\"\n\nAdam said he would take care of the home money, and everything else. On his small phone he called Patrick and told him about Madison's wish. \"So please tell your men, my friend,\" he said nicely but firmly, \"to unload the van.\"\n\nPatrick thought about it and did as Adam asked. He had sent the van because Jessica asked him to, but she hadn't explained why they needed to hurry: it wasn't like Madison's things were worth a lot. Jessica (Patrick told Adam, just between them) sometimes rushed things. She would be very mad, though, he thought, when she learned Madison had given her old things to someone else.\n\n\"About Madison's goodbye,\" Adam said, \"Cameron and I would like to be there. We liked her a lot, as you know.\"\n\nPatrick asked which day would be good for them.\n\n\"Any day but this coming Wednesday,\" Oliver said. \"Charlotte is going to FR country for a music show on that day and I have a lunch talk which I cannot change.\"\n\n\"It was Madison's own fault she got sick,\" Patrick said, sounding upset. \"Jessica offered to take care of her, but Madison didn't want her. She called several times and told Jessica to stay away. Jessica was very sad.\"\n\nOliver said slowly, \"There isn't a phone in that room where Madison was sick. It was very cold outside, I think, and it's a long way to any door into our house, which was cold while we were gone.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Where did Madison call from?\"\n\nPatrick's silence lasted long enough for him to change the subject to pictures of Jessica when she was a kid. If Oliver found any ....\n\n\"I'm sure,\" Oliver told him calmly, \"that Charlotte will give Jessica everything Madison would have wanted her to have.\"\n\n\"Funeral any day but Wednesday,\" Patrick said, sounding a bit nicer. \"I'll let you know.\"\n\nWhen Oliver got home Charlotte was not sitting at the kitchen table anymore but had moved to the living room where she could play her piano.\n\nOliver sat quietly on the wide stairs where he could listen to her without being seen. Charlotte sang a new song, a sad song, a song without many words, a song about being sad.\n\nAll good songs, she'd told Oliver once, were about love or wanting something or losing something. Charlotte's new song had all three.\n\nShe stopped playing all of a sudden and, seeing Oliver on the stairs, sat down next to him.\n\n\"What did you think?\" she asked.\n\n\"Wonderful.\"\n\n\"It doesn't have a name yet ...\"\n\n\"But you wrote it for Madison,\" Oliver said.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWith Oliver next to her, Charlotte took her new song to the musicians in her big city studio, where her song writer, who often wrote sad words, loved it and wrote words about being sad and having hope. Charlotte sang it very softly, almost whispering. Everyone in the studio heard a beautiful sound in her voice.\n\nCharlotte, always very tired after making songs, slept in the big car going home with her head on Oliver's shoulder. Oliver spent the time making plans that he thought Madison might not have liked. When, after the big car had left and Charlotte had gone to rest, the old man (who wasn't so new anymore) told Oliver that he'd heard Madison was going to be cremated in two days' time, on Wednesday, Oliver's plans became very certain.\n\n\"Wednesday!\" He said, \"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"They said so, at the place where people gather.\"\n\nOliver called three people who take care of those who have passed away before finding the one dealing with Madison.\n\n\"Mrs. Wendy? Yes, in the middle of the week.\"\n\nOliver asked questions. The answers were \"a simple goodbye,\" and \"Yes, any other day would have worked because it doesn't take much time, but the family wanted it to be on a Wednesday.\"\n\nOliver's slow plan started to move faster.\n\nJessica was not giving her mother the last respect, the honor of having the famous people she worked for be at her goodbye.\n\nOliver and Charlotte sent a big bunch of white flowers. Madison's neighbor told them later that Jessica had left it on the side, not noticed. Jessica had told the few people there that the Bolingbrokes simply hadn't come.\n\nMadison's ashes were spread on a bed of roses in the garden, with no marker. Jessica, happy in freedom, could now make up stories about her difficult mother and give her the respect after she was gone as \"a lovely horse rider,\" as Peter put it nicely.\n\nAlthough Oliver and Charlotte chose to live a quiet life, both of them knew that to the public they were famous. Both had worked hard to be famous and each wanted to keep it as long as possible. Oliver, after Madison's simple goodbye, decided to use his power to the maximum, whether Madison would have wanted him to or not.\n\nWith Charlotte's agreement, Oliver went to see the people planning the big annual horse show, the five-day Christmas Show at OL place, with five shows in the afternoon and five more in the evening.\n\nApart from the big jumping contests, in which he would be taking part, he, Oliver Bolingbroke, as the big race winner and Sportstar of the Year, would also be leading the end of each of the ten shows in the famous Ride of Champions. The parade couldn't really happen without him. Oliver Bolingbroke, in short, was someone the people planning had to listen to. He suggested an extra part to the end of all ten shows.\n\nThey listened.\n\nTheir eyes got big. Finally they agreed.\n\nOliver shook their hands. Then he went home and patiently taught his smart old horse a lot of new tricks.\n\nCharlotte's manager wrote a lot of agreements. Her musicians made beautiful sounds. Factories made new tracks. Charlotte's new song about love and loss and longing became known to the people.\n\nOliver invited Jessica Vine to be part of a show on TV to remember her mother. Jessica's strong reaction almost made her unable to breathe. Patrick tried to stop Oliver's project but couldn't give a good reason. \"The Life of Mona\" was in the shiny magazine that showed Joanie's fancy dresses and put them next to pictures of a small, dark house. People laughed at Patrick, but they hid it behind their hands.\n\nEvery seat in the big OL stadium was filled for the first of the five afternoon shows. People sat in the walkways, which wasn't allowed. Word had spread. All ten shows were sold out.\n\nIn the dark, Oliver's voice said that this show, which was free, was for his best horse helper, Mona, a simple woman from the valleys. She knew how to get a top-class horse ready like no one else.\n\n\"I owe her,\" he said, \"so ladies and gentlemen, here, to remember her, is her friend, my wife Charlotte, with a 'Song for Mona.'\"\n\nSuddenly, music filled the dark from big speakers up high around the arena, playing a pretty tune that everyone knew because they had learned it before.\n\nA single light turned on, shining on the big gray horse standing still at the entrance to the ring. On the horse's back sat Charlotte, dressed in shiny clothes, Western style, with glittering strings, shiny gloves and a big white hat. The outfit that had made people cheer in the MI country made people in LO city cheer too.\n\nCharlotte and the gray horse walked around the ring with lots of different colored lights making pretty colors on the shiny clothes and white, with bright lights on the sparkling strings. Every few steps, the gray horse would spin around fast, standing tall with Charlotte holding on, clearly having fun. The old jumping horse was the star, and the crowd, who knew who he was because of a long introduction in the program, laughed and cheered him until, back at the start, Charlotte took off her big hat and let her shiny hair loose.\n\nOliver had been a little worried that the shiny show that had done so well in Tennessee might be too much for a horse-show crowd in England, but he didn't need to worry. Charlotte's helpers were very good at their jobs, musicians, light people, electric people, and they had promised\u2014and were giving\u2014an exciting show no one would forget.\n\nAt the end of the colorful walk around the ring, Charlotte rode to the middle of the ring and got off the horse's back, giving the ropes to Oliver, who was waiting there in the dark. Then, in a moment that always made people gasp and stamp their feet, Charlotte took off her riding clothes in a shiny pile and, in a white, big-skirted, crystal-decorated evening dress, walked up small steps to a platform where a microphone waited.\n\nCharlotte took the talking stick and sang the \"Song for Emma\" with Emma in her mind, a song about a woman who missed the love she remembered but had lost. Charlotte sang not of Emma by name, but of all lonely people looking for a warm new friend. Charlotte sang the song twice: once softly, sadly, and then loudly, filling all of OL city, calling for hope.\n\nShe held the last high note until it seemed she might run out of breath, then suddenly the loud music from the speakers stopped. The bright lights turned off, as Charlotte, leaving the shiny dress in the last light, left just a pile of sparkle while she left the stage in black.\n\nShe came back for a moment to loud clapping in a black coat with a shiny inside. She waved thank you with her arms up, and was gone. The old trick that had worked so well in NA city had spread its wings and flown free at OL city.\n\nToo sad, some people complained; but sad songs reached the hearts of many, and so it was with Charlotte's \"Song for Emma.\" By the end of the ten shows at OL city, the long-lasting tune was coming from discs and radios everywhere, on its way to being a well-known song.\n\nJessica and Patrick, with tight teeth, watched the happy show the night it was on TV. Such a pity, the TV person said with regret, that top seller Patrick and his fancy wife Jessica, who was Emma's only daughter, had not been able to come to any of the shows.\n\nJessica was silent with anger. Patrick wondered if it was possible to start over in another town: but the \"Song for Emma\" was sung everywhere, from shows to sing-along. Patrick looked at his beautiful selfish wife and wondered if she was worth it.\n\nA bit after the good times at OL city, Oliver and Charlotte cooked in their kitchen and ate without fighting. Even though they were used to Emma's absence, her spirit seemed to them to be around, telling them to break eggs, not dishes.\n\nAfter everything was done, Charlotte had given all Emma's \"stuff\" (including the pretty pin and the bike) to the neighbor with curlers in her hair, who happily took them in, and only sometimes did either of the B family wonder what Jessica had so urgently looked for on the morning her mother died.\n\n\"You know,\" Charlotte said over the mushroom eggs, \"that old box Emma brought with pictures of Jessica in her fancy dresses ... there were pictures of us in it, too.\"\n\nOliver took down the forgotten box from a high shelf and poured its contents onto the table.\n\nUnder the pictures of Jessica and themselves, they found two old pages from a newspaper in a small town. The newspaper doesn't exist anymore; the pages were old, delicate, and brown around the edges.\n\nOliver gently opened them, making sure not to rip them, and both of the boys learned what Jessica had been trying so hard to hide.\n\nOn the front page was a picture of three people: a younger Madison, a child who was clearly Jessica, and a short man who didn't smile. Next to it, the big letters said: _\"Local man says he did a very bad thing to a child, has to stay away for ten years.\"_\n\n_Isaac, a boy who worked with horses, husband of Madison, and father of Jessica, said he did the bad thing and has to stay away without even going to court._\n\nThe second delicate brown-edged page had a story but no pictures: _\"Boy who worked with horses dies from a fall.\"_\n\n_Isaac, who just came back after being away for six years for doing the very bad thing, died from a hurt head on Thursday. He leaves behind a wife, Madison, and a daughter, Jessica, 13._\n\nAfter a while, Oliver said, \"It tells us a lot, I guess.\"\n\nHe made copies of the old pages and sent them to Jessica. Cameron, agreeing, said, \"Let her worry that we'll tell her secret and ruin her life.\"\n\nThey didn't tell, though.\n\nMadison wouldn't have liked it.\nBRIGHT WHITE STAR\n\n_A magazine from the country,_ Cheshire Life, _sent me a letter._\n\n_\"Write us a story,\" they said._\n\n_I asked, \"What about?\"_\n\n_\"About three thousand words,\" they replied._\n\n_It was winter then, and I often drove up and down a hill where a man who didn't have a home once lived in a hole. So I wrote about a man without a home in winter._\n\n_This story tells how to take a horse from a sale._\n\n_Don't do it!_\n\nThe man was very cold. It was freezing outside, and heavy clouds full of snow hung over the afternoon like a warning. The black branches of bare trees creaked in the wind, and the fields were empty and dark, waiting.\n\nWalking down a small road, the man was cold and hungry and filled with a strong feeling of unhappiness. By this time in winter, he liked to be safe in a cozy spot, sheltered in a hole in the ground on the side of a hill with trees, covered by a thick roof of crossed branches and big brown cardboard. He liked to lie on a warm bed of dry leaves and plastic sheets and bags. He liked to have his wood fire burning all day near his door, with the ashes staying red all night. He liked to stay warm during the cold and rainy days, and then leave when spring came.\n\nWhat he didn't like was when someone else ruined his home, like they did that morning. Three people... the man who owned the land where he was living, and two people from the town group, a stern man and a bossy woman with a list. Their loud voices and silly comments made him angry.\n\n\"I've told him every day for the past week that I want him off my land...\"\n\n\"This home needs a special permit...\"\n\n\"In the town there is a place where people with no homes can sleep for one night...\"\n\nThe town man started to ruin his home made of branches and cardboard, and the other two helped. He could tell that they didn't like his smell, and they didn't like touching what he had touched. He was angry, but because he didn't like talking to other people, he just walked away, looking shapeless in his big clothes and boots, and feeling upset and smelly.\n\nHe had walked a long way since then, slowly.\n\nHe needed food and a place to hide from the coming snow. He needed a home, and a fire. He was more and more angry at people with every slow step he took.\n\nIn LO city that same day, the boss of the Race place was looking sadly out of his office window at the cars in PO square. Behind him in the bright room, Mr. Matthew was complaining, like he had done every day for the past two weeks, about the bad security at the horse selling event, from which someone had stolen his very expensive new horse.\n\nMatthew gave so much money to the BR country horse industry that his complaints couldn't be ignored, even though it was really a job for the police and the people who sold the horses, not the Race place. Matthew, who was fifty and very pushy, was as angry that anyone should dare to steal from him as he was about the theft itself.\n\n\"They just walked out with him,\" he said for the fiftieth time. \"And you've done very little to get him back.\"\n\nThe boss sighed. He didn't like Matthew very much but hid it well under a friendly manner. The boss, who was very clever and had a lot of ideas, wondered what else he could do, other than hoping for a miracle, to find the missing horse.\n\nIn the past, a trail was cold. Matthew, a man, didn't know he had lost something for more than a month after selling some things. He had bought, like always, about ten young horses who would race next summer when they were two years old. He had them moved, like always, to the trainer who would teach them and ride them and help them get used to going in and out of small houses. And, like always, after some time, he had gone to see how his horses were doing.\n\nHe was confused at first by what should have been his best horse. Confused, then worried, and then really angry. He had paid a lot of money for a big, fancy young horse and instead he got a skinny horse with a weak neck. The horse he bought and the horse he got were only the same in two ways: the color of their body, a dark brown; and the big white spot on the forehead.\n\n\"It's not fair,\" said Matthew. \"I'll spend my money in FR country, next year.\"\n\nThe big boss thought that stealing racehorses was very rare and that keeping the sales safe was more about papers than locks: and usually the papers were safe enough.\n\nEvery new baby horse had to be written down soon after birth, the paper giving who the parents were and when it was born but also the colors of the skin and where the hairs on the body grew in swirls. The colors and swirls had to be carefully drawn onto pictures of the sides, front and back of horses.\n\nLater, when the baby horse was grown up and ready to race, another chart of his colors had to be filled in by a doctor and sent to the office. If the baby horse's paper and the grown-up horse's paper matched, all was good. If they didn't, the horse couldn't race.\n\nThe baby horse paper of the young horse Matthew bought definitely did not match the horse he got. The color and the white star were right, but the swirls of hair were all in different places.\n\nThe big boss had told his helper to check the horse against the 20,000 baby horse papers in that year's office, but so far none of them had matched. The big boss thought that the horse, which he had seen, was very likely a half-bred horse, which hadn't been allowed in the Big Book in the first place, and of whom there would be no official paper anywhere.\n\n\"That door check is silly,\" grumbled Matthew.\n\nThe men at the sales gates, the big boss admitted to himself, were there only to check that there was a paper for each horse from the sellers, and that the horse had the same number, stuck onto its back, as was written on the paper. They were not there to see if anyone had changed the numbers on the horses. It wasn't their fault that the horse number one-eight-nine that had come out with the ticket one-eight-nine was a weak horse, and not the expensive, top-notch horse of Mr. Matthew. They didn't know under what number the expensive horse had left. They couldn't know, and they didn't.\n\nThe director had found out some things about how the switch had been made, and guessed the rest.\n\nAt the big horse selling event, the horses were kept in small houses. Horse number one in the list was given house number one and had number one put on his side. Horse one-eight-nine would be in house one-eight-nine and have one-eight-nine on his side. The customers would walk around all the houses, looking and poking and deciding whether or not to buy. After each horse was sold, the old owners put it back in its house and left it there. The new owners would pick it up from there. The people who sold and the people who bought often never met.\n\nThe boy who came with one-eight-nine had taken it from the selling place back to its house, and left it there. Mr. Matthew's boy had picked up the horse from house one-eight-nine and sent it to the trainer, and it was the wrong horse.\n\nThe switch, with so many horses and people moving around, could be (and had been) done without anyone seeing.\n\nThe director thought that the bad guys must have brought their horse to the selling event, and set a very high price on it, so that no one would buy it. He thought that the wrong horse must have been one of the ones that didn't sell between numbers one and one hundred and eighty-eight, but the people who ran the selling event couldn't remember one horse out of so many from a long time ago. They sold hundreds of horses every week. They didn't ask where the horses came from or where they went. They kept track of the horses that no one bought, but thought that their owners had taken them back.\n\n\"And your big plan to tell everyone,\" Mr. Matthew said in a mean way. \"Lots of talk and no results.\"\n\nThe director turned tiredly away from the window and looked at the newspaper on his desk. In a week with no big news, the people who made the newspaper had been happy to use the story he had given them, and no reader could miss the \"Where is he?\" pictures of the missing horse. The newspapers had used sad stories. The serious newspapers had shown the baby horse's papers. TV news people had shown both. Two days of telling everyone, however, had not found the horse. His \"call anytime\" number was quiet.\n\n\"You bring him back,\" Matthew said very upset, before he finally left. \"Or I send all my horses to FR country.\"\n\nThe boss thought of his wife and kids who were getting ready for a party that night and would be happy to see him come home. I won't think about that young horse for two days, he thought: and meanwhile he gave in and really hoped for something amazing to happen.\n\n\"What I need,\" he said out loud in his quiet office, \"is a white star. A bright white star, not moving in the sky, shining over a stable, saying, 'Here I am. Come here to me. Come find me.'\"\n\nPlease forgive me for saying that, he thought; and went home in the afternoon.\n\nIn the country that afternoon, Jack and Victoria spread out four papers on the kitchen table and looked at them over cups of tea.\n\n\"They won't find him, will they?\" Jack said.\n\nVictoria shook her head. \"A brown horse with a white star... very common.\"\n\nThey thought about the fancy young horse in their old stable outside, but it had been a few weeks since they took him, and time had made them feel safe.\n\n\"And anyway,\" Victoria said, \"these papers are two days old, and nothing's happened.\"\n\nJack nodded, feeling better. He knew he could never have done it all without Victoria. It was she who had said that what they really needed, to get him started as a horse trainer, was one really good horse. The kind, let's be honest (she said), that no one would give to a retired horse racer who was never very good and who had been in trouble twice for taking money to lose on purpose.\n\nAs Jack would take money to lose any time anyone offered, two times in trouble had been not bad. He wouldn't have minded retiring to a job helping in a big stable, where the chances for taking money to lose grew like ripe berries. Victoria had wanted to be a horse trainer's wife, not a helper's, and you had to say this about her\u2014the girl was smart.\n\nIt was Victoria, with her good eyes, who had seen how they could take a top young horse from the sale. It was Victoria, a brave little lady, who had cheered Jack on when he got scared, who had done the switch in stall one-eight-nine; she who had taken the fancy horse and Jack who had left the other one.\n\nVictoria, deciding that they should use a half-bred unregistered horse to get into the sale, had bought one from a place that took old horses for very little money; a brown horse with a white star, very common. She had said there would surely be one a bit like him to trade with, they would swap him for any great one that came after him, and sure enough, the one-eight-nine had been perfect.\n\nVictoria, thinking ahead, would send Kevin up north when spring came with all their saved money to buy a cheap two-year-old horse, a brown one with a white mark, that looked okay. Then Kevin would get the animal doctor to fill in the new horse's marking paper, which would match its baby paper in the registry; and Kevin, the horse trainer, would have in his barn a brown horse with a white mark checked and registered and free to race.\n\nKevin and Victoria knew, as the boss did, that young horses changed as they grew older, like kids into grown-ups, so that there would be little chance of anyone recognizing the fancy horse by sight. It could race forever in its new name, and no one would ever know. Victoria couldn't see how anything could go wrong, and never thought of the long-term stubbornness of the boss, who was already thinking about checks of brown horses with white marks for years to come.\n\n\"In the summer,\" Victoria said, \"we'll make the place look nicer. Some paint. Pots of flowers. Then in fall when the young horse starts winning and people notice, we'll have a place new owners won't mind coming to.\"\n\nKevin nodded. Victoria could do it. She was really smart, Victoria was.\n\n\"And you'll be famous, Kevin, and none of those mean ladies who are trainers' wives will look down on us ever again.\"\n\nThere was a sudden loud noise just outside the back door, and, immediately scared, they both stood up quickly and went outside.\n\nA messy, untidy person stood there, with his hands going through the house trash in their trash can, already turning to leave.\n\n\"It's a hobo!\" Victoria said in disbelief. \"Stealing our trash.\"\n\n\"Go away,\" Kevin said, moving forward. \"Go on, go away.\"\n\nThe hobo moved a few steps, very slowly.\n\nKevin went back into his kitchen and picked up the gun he used to scare away rabbits.\n\n\"Go on,\" he yelled, coming out again and pointing the gun. \"Leave and don't come back. I don't want people like you here. Go away.\"\n\nThe hobo moved slowly away towards the road, and the Turners, feeling okay again, returned to their warm kitchen.\n\nThe land boss spent the afternoon feeling sorry about what he'd done in the morning. It was not a nice day, he thought, to make a man leave his home, even if his home was just a hole in the ground.\n\nWhen they broke the nest, the two workers and him, he found a bag full of the ends of smokes. He didn't dream much, but he thought about how he took everything the man had, his home and all his things. He looked up at the sky, and felt cold.\n\nIn the afternoon he walked around his big space, hoping to see the man, to feel better; but he was surprised when he saw him walking on the edge of his land.\n\nThe man walked slowly, and he was not alone. A horse was with him.\n\nThe man stopped, and the horse did too. The man had a treat for the horse in his hand, and the horse ate it.\n\nHe looked at the two of them, the dirty man and the clean horse with its neat blanket.\n\n\"Where did you get that?\" he asked.\n\n\"Found it. On the road.\" The man's voice was scratchy from not talking, but the words were clear. They were not true.\n\n\"Look,\" he said, \"you can build your home again, if you want. Stay for a few days. Is that okay?\"\n\nThe man thought about it but said no, knowing he couldn't stay, because of the horse. He had let the horse out of its house and taken it with him. They would say he stole and catch him. In his past he had run away from places, from homes for kids and then the soldiers, and if he couldn't live in a small house, he couldn't live in a small room in jail. Cold and hunger and freedom, yes. Warm and food and a locked door, no.\n\nHe walked away, telling the man to take the horse, to touch its head and do the right thing. The man did so.\n\n\"Wait,\" he said, as the man walked away. \"Look ... take these.\" He took out a pack of smokes and held them out. \"Take them ... please.\"\n\nThe man came back and took the gift, nodding to say thank you. Then he walked away down the road, and the snow started to fall, big white pieces covering him in the late afternoon.\n\nWhere will he go? The farmer felt uneasy: and the wanderer thought calmly that he would walk all night through the snow to stay warm, and in the morning he would find a place to stay, and eat, as usual, what others had thrown away. The wanderer's earlier anger, which had been directed at Jack, had now faded away, and all he felt, as he moved away, was his usual strong wish to be alone.\n\nThe farmer looked at the horse and the white mark on its head, and shook his head at the thought that came to him. Still, after he'd put the horse in a place behind his house, he took out old newspapers, and looked at the big words \"Find the Bright Star\" and at the paper about the young horse in the \"serious\" paper. And then he carefully called the police.\n\n\"Found a horse, have you, sir?\" said a happy police's voice strongly. \"And you're not the only one, I'll tell you that. There's horses all over the place, here. Some silly person opened all the places at Jack's place and let them all out. It might be a wanderer. Jack says he chased one away earlier. We're looking for that one as lived on your land. But it's dark and it's snowing and I'm short of men, of course, as today's Christmas Eve.\"\n\n_Christmas Eve._\n\nThe farmer felt first a wave of irritation with the wanderer, and then, suddenly, understood that he wouldn't have let the horses go if he hadn't been turned out of his own place at Christmas. He decided not to tell the police that he'd seen the wanderer with the horse now in his own place, nor which way the wanderer had gone.\n\n\"I'll tell Jack to come and fetch that horse, sir,\" said the police. \"He'll be happy to have it back. He's very worried, he is.\"\n\n\"Er,\" said the farmer, slowly, not wanting to look silly, \"I don't know if you've read the papers about that lost horse, police, but I think instead of giving this one back to Jack right away, we might try that 'call any time' number for reaching the boss of the Racecourse Safety Service.\" He paused. \"I don't think that the boss believes in Christmas miracles, but the horse I have here in my place is a young brown horse with a bright white mark on his head...and marks in all the right places...\"  \n_NO bad things here. No blood._   \nNot liking others, _sure, and_ pride, _OK,_   \nThis isn't a story about Alice, Bella, and Charlotte, this is a story about an editor who lost his job and a boss who made a mistake.\n\nWith a cup of strong coffee next to him, the editor of the \"CO newspaper\" sat at his desk and read the flashy story that would be the main story in the sports section of the newspaper the next day, unless he stopped it. The words were blurry. He was upset about losing his job.\n\nTwice a week, on early week day and weekend day, from a plain building in an industry area west of OX town, the \"CO newspaper\" sent a lot of exciting news to the towns and villages on the CO hills.\n\nOn early week day, the news was mostly about current events and opinions, and on the weekend it was about sports, clothes, and fun games. There was something for everyone, the newspaper said. Something for Moms, Dads, kids, and relatives. News about new babies, people passing away, and ads for things people wanted. Lots of energy. Star signs, rumors... All interesting stuff for readers.\n\nThe current editor of the \"CO newspaper\", who was twenty-nine years old when he was surprisingly chosen, had in four short years made the newspaper twice as popular while people often thought he was just a helper.\n\nHe was short and thin, he could see really well, hear really clearly and could smell things like oil in the north wind and sheep in the west wind. He talked like people from BE area, WI area, and a big school in CA town. He could read really fast, his brain was like a sponge. He was named Adam, and he could get angry really quickly. His team, who knew he was in charge, were careful around him and called him Adam when he asked them to.\n\nThe editor\u2014Adam\u2014looked at the main story in the sports section again. Focus, he told himself. Don't leave quietly.\n\nHe read:\n\nThose with heart problems, don't read on. Everyone else, do some exercises while you're sitting down on the weekend. Open a drink. Ready? Let's start!\n\nThe story was technically perfect; neat typing, double spacing, a perfect printout from a computer. This sports writer never made his stories messy with changes.\n\nReading through a few more flowery paragraphs encouraging laziness finally showed that the main point of the story was advice on buying parts of racehorses.\n\nBenjamin was confused. Talking about racehorses that many people owned together wasn't usually interesting news. What made this different was that the important part of it said that the horses, when bought, wouldn't go to a trainer that everyone knew, but would start a new team with a new trainer, someone named David.\n\nThe _Voice_ told its readers that this plan was an exciting thing to spend money on. Buy, buy, and buy some more.\n\nThe boss picked up the interesting paper and walked slowly down the long room to where his main writer about races was waiting to hear what he thought. The whole busy room was very quiet because the boss, during his first weeks in charge, had gotten rid of the last of the loud clacking type-writers and put dark blue carpet that sucked up noise over the squeaky floor. The crazy activity that newspapers usually had was gone with the noise, but people were getting more work done. The older workers wanted the noise to come back.\n\nThe boss sat on a rolling chair next to the writer's desk and, holding the typed pages in front of him, asked without being mean, \"What's all this really about?\"\n\n\"Well ... groups of people owning horses together.\" The racing writer, who was lazy, middle-aged, and had a big mustache, showed more energy in his writing than in real life.\n\n\"This David,\" the boss asked. \"Have you met him?\"\n\n\"Well ... no.\"\n\n\"Where did you get the story?\"\n\n\"From the man who's putting the groups together.\"\n\n\"Do you know _him?_ \"\n\n\"No. He called on the phone.\"\n\nThe boss drew a line through the advice to buy and buy, and put his initials on the rest of the column to say it could be published. There wasn't much else that was interesting: it was August, a slow month for newspapers and races.\n\n\"Find out more about the story,\" he said. \"Write about who David is. Get a picture. If there are no bigger stories and no one beats you to it, we'll put it in the paper next Saturday.\"\n\n\"What if he's a fake?\"\n\n\"Fakes are news,\" the boss said. \"Just make sure you know the facts.\"\n\nThe racing writer looked worried, watching the boss walk away. He was very lazy and once wrote a funny \"eyewitness\" story about a big parade that everyone was looking forward to but that had actually been canceled because of heavy rain. The boss had been so mad that the racing writer had gotten sick to his stomach. This time, he thought sadly, he would actually have to get up and find out who the wannabe trainer was. (The racing writer thought in the same way he wrote.) The only good thing for him was that after next Saturday, his boss would be on vacation for a week. The writer about races could be more relaxed in his writing, he happily thought, when the boss wasn't always around asking for more work. The writer liked to get his information on the phone, sitting down. He picked up the phone and talked to the person who arranged things.\n\nBenjamin went back to his desk and drank his leftover warm coffee, his thoughts as dark as the drink. The _News_ used to belong to a family whose nice head had recently died. The family, wanting to split the money, had sold their biggest thing to a big company as just one more local paper in their business. The new people did not want anything different. They wanted as much money as possible. As much as possible, their bunch of local papers would all talk about money in the same way. So, they would choose their own boss for the _News_. It was good that ex-boss Benjamin was due for a week off. He could clean his desk and not come back.\n\nBenjamin had known the family would one day sell and that he would move on. He'd known there was a new harshness in the tough newspaper world. Knowing hadn't prepared him for the suddenness, the harshness or the total lack of even a little bit of niceness from any side. There had been no handshakes, no sorry, certainly no good wishes, just a straight firing message among his private messages.\n\nFrom the general quiet in the long room he realized that the new owners had so far told no one else about the change of bosses. It was okay with him. His last three papers\u2014Saturday, Tuesday and Saturday\u2014would be the best he could do. And after that ....\n\nGetting his mind ready, he pulled onto his screen the names of all newspapers made in LO city, along with their owners. He had done his time in the small towns\u2014like the horses going up and down on the outside ring of a roundabout\u2014and he thought he had earned a chance to be in charge. If he didn't tell the bosses he was free out there and willing, he thought, mixing his ideas happily, how would they know?\n\nHe phoned and wrote letters and messages and sent copies of the _News_ all over the place. His work history was impressive, but the bosses seemingly did not hear.\n\nFrom a big company known for treating their writer staff badly, he did at least get one sure offer to meet. Dinner for four at a place of Benjamin's choosing. Outside LO city, they said. Benjamin to pay.\n\nIt was by then Thursday of his last week at the _News_. Once the Saturday paper was out, he would be done. Philosophically, Patrick agreed to the big group's invitation and made a plan to go to a restaurant by the RI river, south of OX city. His friend who writes about food had talked a lot about this place.\n\nThe _Voice_ 's writer about races, after asking a lot of people over the phone, had finally found the hopeful David. David didn't know yet that the \"crossing out\" boss would no longer be after him after the weekend, so he had actually driven a long way to meet face-to-face.\n\nWhen he tried, the writer about races was often right about people and horses, which was why Benjamin put up with him. The writer saw things that were wrong and told the truth, and often he was right.\n\nHe saw things in David that others might have thought were good, but the first of them was that David believed too much in himself. David's dream in life _began_ at being the best trainer: after that, the whole world.\n\nThe writer listened to the bragging with tired disappointment and took notes as if there were no such thing as tape recorders. He would have called David a proud, annoying, self-important fake if he wasn't sure that the little \"crossing out\" devil would only let him say \"ambitious.\"\n\nAt the age of thirty, David had a plan for his life which involved becoming famous quickly. He would be friendly with any successful person. He would show respect to everyone who had a title. He would do favors that needed favors in return. He needed a first step in public for this upward move and the _Cotswold Voice_ sports pages' main article would give it to him.\n\nHe told the writer with a bit of proud defiance that since he was too big to be a top jumping rider he had spent six years as a helper, \"doing his two\" and living in a bad place in a hostel.\n\n\"Was that part of the plan?\" the writer asked.\n\n\"Sure,\" David said, but he was not telling the truth.\n\nThe writer wrote on his notepad, \"The time to make friends with this guy is NOW.\" He asked, \"What do you plan to do next?\"\n\nDavid told him all about it. He would charm the owners of the horses he'd taken care of to send him some to train. Their horses had won, he would tell them with a smile, because of his knowledge. Then he would make the groups famous and welcome all part owners warmly. He would be given a trainer's license because he'd finished all three of the BR school's official courses\u2014in horse, business and people management.\n\n\"The top runner,\" the story writer noted, and later wrote one of his best stories for the _Book,_ giving Kevin a chance.\n\nBenjamin, still the boss the next day, walked down the quiet office floor holding the shiny pages and gave his story writer a sincere compliment. Then he gathered his team and calmly told them that a different boss would be in charge from Sunday.\n\nBenjamin, whose quirky father gave him long names, spent his school years hiding his smartness so he wouldn't be picked on. His teachers thought he was puzzlingly slow: not silly themselves, they saw moments of hidden smartness and said \"I knew it\" when Benjamin, against their advice, aimed high and tried for a big school, winning lots of awards and getting top marks.\n\nAs a student, Benjamin started and edited a _School Paper,_ which quickly became very popular. Dr. Benjamin, smart at twenty-seven, said no to a teaching job, left the big school, and humbly worked as a traveling writer until the _Country Voice_ team liked his writing style and hired him as a chance.\n\nHis quick anger mostly controlled and kept inside, Benjamin spent his breaks (and much of his life) alone. Unlike many alone people, though, he was a fun person who didn't take himself too seriously: which was why, in what he now thought of as the \"Summer of the Lost Voice,\" he decided not to change his relaxing plans for his week off, but to rent a boat up the Big River, as he'd planned, and guide it down to OX city.\n\nHe thought that since he had planned the dinner meeting with the not good group at a restaurant down the river from OX city, and since he had no job to rush back to, he would extend his water trip in time and distance, and rest his hurt feelings while thinking about how to get good stuff from a hard group.\n\nAt LE town, the town at the highest point on the Big River where boats can go, the boat place had given one of its newly fixed boats to Mr. Benjamin, because he had paid extra for the best. The paint on the strong wood was rich and dark and there was new blue soft cloth on the wide comfortable seat that would stretch out to be a bed for sleeping on.\n\nA big blanket could be pulled out from both ends of the boat, meeting in the middle to keep out the dark and rain. The boat also had ropes to tie it up, a light, places to put the oars, and oars to move the boat. There was a long stick with a hook on it and a longer stick to push the big flat boat on the water.\n\nAdam had learned to push the boat on a small river in CA city, and felt happy on the boat that didn't have a motor. He liked to push the boat more than row it. He smelled the new paint and tested the long stick. He asked questions that made the boat people happy and bought some things from their shop. He was going to travel far on the river, but they agreed to keep his car safe and pick him and their boat up when he was done.\n\nAdam brought a sleeping bag, a tool to see far away, swim shorts, pens and paper, clean clothes, a tool to shave and ten books. He put all these things in the boat, took off his sweater, and jumped onto the boat. He didn't look like the boss of a newspaper.\n\nHe pushed his boat along with ease, and the boat people watched him until he was out of sight. Adam, looking back at the small town with its shiny church tower, felt free. There was nothing to worry him, no problem to make him go back to work. He didn't even bring his phone.\n\nTwo days before, his Saturday paper had sold out. He had used all the good ideas he usually spread out over the year, and he felt happy as he sat in a bar and watched people buy his paper. It was amazing.\n\nOn Monday, as the sun was setting, Adam steered his boat to a nice-smelling bank and tied it to a tree. The little sounds of birds settling for the night, the whisper of the wind in the dry grass, and the quiet sound of the water moving past his boat made him forget about the noisy world outside. He was surprised at how peaceful it was. Once upon a time, there was a brave man who would fight for what was right. \n\nOne week, he was on a slow boat on a big river. Other faster boats with loud music would pass him by. People fishing by the river would get upset because his boat would pull their fishing lines. The people who kept the river locks were not happy either when his boat, which was guided by a long stick, had trouble getting in and out of the locks.\n\nThe brave man's name was Benjamin. Despite all the shouting, Benjamin was good at what he did.\n\nHe enjoyed watching the sunsets when the busy river was quiet. He would listen to the birds on the meadows above the big city and eat at a place where peacocks lived on the roof. Once, he even saw a rare bird hunting.\n\nHe saw many things while on his boat. He saw birds and flowers growing wild. He looked at swans and herons up close.\n\nBy the time Benjamin reached the public place to park his boat in the big city, he was happy and strong from pushing the boat with the long stick. He had written a story and read nine of his books.\n\nHe went to buy food and called his message service from a public phone. There were many messages from unhappy readers of his stories. No one had offered him a job.\n\nIn the big city, he bought all the local and big city newspapers he could find and went back to his boat.\n\nIt was a day in the week. He had been traveling down the river for eight easy days and would reach the restaurant for his dinner meeting in two more days. He knew that a lot depended on what the people he was meeting thought of him. He read their newspapers first.\n\nThere were two newspapers, the BN newspaper and the DT newspaper. Both were divided into two parts, with sports, art, and money news coming second.\n\nHe knew that both newspapers were serious and did not show anything not suitable for children. He also knew that they were trying hard to have more readers than other newspapers. Because of this, they had added more exciting stuff on Sundays. He thought that day's edition of the DT newspaper was boring and he was upset to find the same story printed on two different pages. He was not sad at all, but felt like shaking the big boat because it was so slow.\n\nLater, he comfortably read a newspaper under a beautiful tree. He read it with a calm heart, that day's news. He had read two old newspapers in a pub, which had some of his own work. This Tuesday's news, the third one since the new owners took over, was just like the old news before young Victor got his hands on it.\n\nVictor sighed.\n\nThe person who writes about races in the newspaper missed the little blue pencil a lot (as he said it).\n\nHe was told by the new boss, a big man who liked to boss around, that in future the newspaper would use a common opinion piece as their main story on the race page. The current race writer would write the second story, and yes, he could write a follow-up story this week about David and his groups, if the newspaper had helped David's training career. After that, the race writer would not write more features, but focus on predicting winners.\n\nUpset, the race writer called David, and they made up a story about the new trainer being flooded with requests to take horses from excited group owners, thanks to the support of the newspaper.\n\nThe new boss nodded at the story and said it was good to publish. The old boss shook his head, and, knowing his race writer and reading his weekend story in a bar, didn't believe a word of it.\n\nVictor traveled two days from OX city to the meeting place, a restaurant by the river\u2014called Mainstream Mile\u2014and tied his boat neatly to the pier in the late afternoon sun. He agreed with his food writer's statement that, from the water, the dining room of Mainstream Mile was one of the most beautiful on the river, with tables set on terraces behind a big glass, so that diners could watch river traffic.\n\nThere was a small rose garden between the building and the river, with a path leading up from the pier. Down the path, as Victor stood on the pier, relaxing in his jeans and T-shirt after his journey, a young man in a dark suit came with a proud air and told the visitor to leave immediately because he was not welcome.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" Victor said, thinking it was a joke. \"What do you mean, go away?\"\n\n\"The eating room is all booked for tonight.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Ben laughed. \"That's okay. I booked a table for tonight two weeks ago.\"\n\n\"You cannot have!\" The young man began to lose his calm. \"It's not possible. We don't allow boats.\"\n\nSurprised, Ben looked around him. He said, \"This eating place is called MY place. It's by the big river. It has a spot to park boats, where you see my boat is parked. How can you say you don't allow boats?\"\n\n\"It's the rule here.\"\n\nBen got really angry. \"You go tell them,\" he said strongly, poking the young man's chest with his finger, \"that I booked a table here two weeks ago, and nobody said anything about not allowing boats.\"\n\nThe newsroom of the _CO Voice_ knew it's not good to argue with an angry Ben. The young man stepped back nervously and said, \"What name?\"\n\n\"Ben. Four people. When it's dark. I am meeting my three friends here at the time when it starts to get dark. You go back and tell that to them.\"\n\nMrs. Rachel drove from LO city in a bad mood made worse by the sun shining straight into her eyes.\n\nBeside her sat Frank with Nathan behind her sitting in the back seat. Rachel had wanted the company driver, not herself, to drive the big car for this annoying trip, but the others thought it was better if she drove because the driver talks too much if given enough money.\n\nMrs. Rachel, Mr. Frank and Mr. Nathan all owned the newspaper group, The LI News Group. All of them were serious. All of them were fifty, smart and worried. The number of all newspapers had dropped because of TV, but theirs more than most. They argued a lot. Each of the three owners didn't like the other two, and it was the arguing between them that had led to the last bad choice of person in charge for the _Daily TR._\n\nRachel thought it was completely pointless interviewing a thirty-three-year-old from the countryside, and only desperation had made her go on this trip.\n\nThe LI News Group's big car reached the MY place eating place at seven-thirty-five and the owners walked into the bar. There were several groups of people sitting at small tables with no one looking like Rachel's idea of a newspaper person in charge. Her look swept over the young boy standing to the side, holding a big paper folder, and she felt sad realizing, as he shyly walked towards her, that this, a waste of time, was the person they had traveled all that way to meet.\n\nFrank and Ryan shook his hand, introducing themselves, and both were surprised by his young age. In dark pants, white shirt and blue jacket he looked good for a summer Thursday dinner by the river, but not right for their idea of leading a newsroom. Benjamin, more worried about his job chances than he would say, was also upset by the restaurant's ongoing rudeness towards him, for which he saw no clear reason. Why should he not come in a boat?\n\nIn the bar Benjamin seated his guests at a small table and ordered drinks, which took a long time to come. The bar filled up with people and then began to empty again as a headwaiter in a fancy suit started handing out menus and taking orders and leading guests away to sit them in the eating room. Other guests: not Benjamin's group.\n\nAnnoyed at being ignored, Benjamin asked the headwaiter for menus, as he walked by with happy customers following. The headwaiter said, \"Sure,\" looking unhappy, and took five minutes to come back.\n\nMrs. Rachel was angry at the rude treatment and waited, getting more and more upset, for her host to do something. Benjamin twice asked that the headwaiter sit them for dinner, but he and his guests were last out of the bar, and last in the eating room, and were given the worst table, in a corner. Benjamin was close to hitting the smug look off the headwaiter's face.\n\nUnbelievable, Mrs. Rachel thought. The food she ordered came late and cold. Frank and Ryan tried to figure out this Benjamin's ability to run a newspaper, which was why they were there, but were distracted by the restaurant staff's rude service at every turn.\n\nBenjamin, with clenched but useless fists, angrily asked for better manners from the waiters and didn't get it. When Mrs. Rachel asked for coffee, she was told it was available in the bar.\n\nEvery table in the bar was by that time filled. Mrs. Rachel went straight out of the exit door to the parking lot without looking back. Frank and Ryan shook their heads at Benjamin and vaguely said they would let him know. Benjamin gave to Frank the big paper folder he'd been holding all evening, and Frank, though looking at it as if he thought it contained something dangerous, held onto the folder, carefully at first, and then strongly gripped it, and followed Mrs. Rachel and Ryan out to their car.\n\n\"See, I told you,\" Mrs. Rachel said strongly, pushing out her jaw and going away quickly. \"A little boy who can't even make a sandwich.\"\n\nFrank said, \"I thought that Benjamin would have hit that waiter if we and everyone else hadn't been watching.\"\n\n\"No way,\" Mrs. Rachel said, but Frank knew what he saw. He held the papers that had been given to him and decided to read them in the morning.\n\nBenjamin went back to the eating room, which was now empty of guests and being set up for the morning, and asked to see the waiter. None of the busy helpers rushed to help him, but one finally told him that the waiter had gone home, his work done for the night.\n\nBenjamin, stiff with anger, stood still and insisted on seeing whoever was now in charge. The helpers moved a bit nervously. People on boats were supposed to be calm, not look as if at any minute they'd have everyone walking the plank at the end of the pier.\n\nMaybe he should see the boss, one of them weakly suggested.\n\n\"Right now,\" Benjamin said.\n\nThe boss, in a small room down a hallway behind the bar, was a big woman in a red and gold dress counting money. She was sitting at a desk. She did not ask Benjamin to sit in the chair across from her, but he did, anyway. She looked down her long thin nose.\n\nShe said, sounding as if such a thing were impossible, \"I'm told you have a problem.\"\n\nBenjamin strongly described his ruined night.\n\nThe boss showed no surprise. \"When you asked for a table,\" she said, not arguing that he had asked for a table, \"you should have said you would be coming on a boat.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"We do not allow boats.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"People on vacation on boats act badly. They break things. They're loud. They make our bathrooms dirty. They have wild kids. They complain about our prices.\"\n\n\"I asked for a table in the normal way,\" Benjamin said slowly and clearly, \"and I am mad.\"\n\nThe truth of that statement made the boss shake a bit, but she repeated, \"You should have said you were coming on a boat. When you asked for the table you should have said it. Then we would have been ready.\"\n\n\"When I asked for the table, you didn't ask, 'How will you be coming?' You didn't ask, 'Will you be coming in a fancy car?' 'Will you be coming on a tractor?' \"Did they come on a bike?\" \"On foot?\" My three friends came in a big car and you acted like they were here to take your spoons.\"\n\nThe boss lady shook her head, closed her lips and looked blindly at the upset and steaming customer. She wanted him to leave. She didn't want to argue.\n\nBenjamin, who did like to argue, felt the boss lady give up and, as always when he had won, his own anger went away. Letting your guard down is dangerous, he'd been told many times, but he never liked to hurt someone who was already down. He got up from the boss lady's chair and went out into the cool night air and the path through the flower garden and the blue cushioned bed in the boat.\n\nHe changed his clothes, put back the boat's rain covers and lay in his sleeping bag looking up at the dry clear sky. He knew he had lost any chance of working on the _Daily News._ He spent the night not sleeping but always thinking about the mean things that were done to him for no reason and his own failure to make a big fuss. And would making a big fuss have won him the _News?_ Would it not more likely have turned into a funny story, whereas now, if he understood Mrs. Rachel right, the evening would only give her a \"I told you so\" in her fights?\n\nHe dreamed about a good payback, doubting if he could do it. As a former worker he couldn't get the food writer to write a bad review: the same writer that had given the new restaurant a great review. As Mr. Normal Guy, he might be angry without costing the big street a bit of his sleepless night.\n\nThe morning didn't bring him any nice dreams. Full daylight found him getting the boat ready, though there was no happiness left in his trip. In the next town down the river he would call the people to get their boat.\n\nDown the path through the flower garden came the same waiter dressed in dark clothes as before, but this time without the mean smile.\n\n\"The boss lady,\" he said, \"asks you to have coffee on land.\"\n\n\"Coffee?\"\n\n\"Served in the bar.\"\n\nHe turned away and left without waiting for an answer.\n\nBenjamin didn't know, in fact, what answer to give. Was coffee a peace offering? An apology? He didn't feel like accepting either. Could coffee, though, be a first step to not having to pay for his credit card slip? Had the boss lady decided he shouldn't have to pay for their terrible treatment?\n\nThe boss lady had not. It wasn't about the money that made Benjamin angry, since leaving the _Voice_ had cost the new owners a lot. He walked into the food place planning to take back some money unhappily, but didn't get anything.\n\nHe went into the closed and dark place in the morning. A helper came in slowly and put on a small table a tray with a cup and dish, a jug of milk, sugar, and a pot of coffee.\n\nAnd that was all. Bill, not believing it, drank two cups of really good strong coffee. No one else came into the place. No one said anything.\n\nIf the coffee was supposed to be a peace offering, it was also rude. After he finished the second cup, Bill got up from his small table and, walking across the room, opened the door that led to the car area outside. Over the door of every place in BR country that sells drinks, the name of the person in charge had to be shown by law. Bill, without a clear plan, went to see at least the name of the person who had been rude.\n\nThe name over the front door was Pauline. \n\nPauline. It was strange, but just a chance happening. Bill went back into the place and found it not empty this time. The lady in charge from the night before was there, with four of her team. They stood stiffly, like guards, but also watching that she wouldn't blame them for what they had done.\n\n\"Are you,\" Bill asked the woman slowly, \"Pauline?\"\n\nShe nodded, but didn't want to.\n\n\"Do I get a sorry for last night?\"\n\nShe didn't say anything.\n\nHe asked, \"Do you know a guy named David?\"\n\nBill only noticed the quiet getting deeper. Pauline's eyes looked at him darkly, not saying sorry at all. He wanted to push her against the wall and scare her into talking, but didn't because he thought about getting arrested.\n\nPauline was happy to see her difficult customer go back to his boat and leave, and she thought she wouldn't hear from him again. She didn't even talk about what she thought of as \"the bad time\" when her nephew David came for one of their usual business talks. David, always good at talking, had first convinced his unmarried aunt to sell her house to start the food place and then had borrowed money on it to become a horse trainer. His aunt Pauline didn't want to put the money from her house directly into a horse place because she didn't like horses. But other than that, in her eyes David could do no wrong. David chose the comfortable chairs in the food place and the nice dishes, David got a famous cook, David got her to wear nice clothes, David got newspaper writers to come and impressed them with how good everything was, and David, too, made the rule of no boats.\n\n\"Food places in LO city turn away people they don't want,\" he'd told his aunt. \"And I don't want messy hire boats blocking our pier and bringing a lot of people.\"\n\n\"No, David,\" his aunt said strongly, understanding what he meant.\n\nHer nephew heard about the customer in the boat from the kitchen helpers, and, feeling a bit worried by their unclear explanations, he asked his aunt what had happened.\n\nDavid was only a little upset. Even if he'd been treated badly, one unhappy eater couldn't ruin a very successful business.\n\n\"This boat guy,\" he said, looking at the books, \"he really had reserved a table?\"\n\n\"Yes, he had.\"\n\n\"Then you should have served him nicely, same as everyone else.\"\n\n\"But you said no ...\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, but use some sense.\"\n\nHis aunt's reservation book was open on the desk. David, looking at it, asked, \"Which reservation came from the man in the boat?\"\n\n\"That one.\" His aunt pointed. \"The first one for yesterday. William, four people, early in the evening. We took his phone number too, of course.\"\n\nDavid looked at the phone number and his whole body jumped. He knew that number. He couldn't believe it. _Wouldn't_ believe it. He moved his aunt's phone towards him, pushed the buttons and heard the woman answering saying, \"Good morning.\"\n\nAlmost speechless, David asked to speak to the writer, who as usual was leaning back in his chair cleaning his nails.\n\n\"William?\" the writer said. \"Sure, I know him. He used to be our boss. Very good at it too, though I wouldn't tell him. It was thanks to him you got all that attention for your racing teams and such. He sent me to interview you, that day we had the photographer for the pictures. What do you need him for?\"\n\n\"I ... er ... I just wondered.\" David's throat felt dry.\n\n\"Be careful with him,\" the writer said with a serious warning. \"He may look small and harmless but he can be very angry.\"\n\nFeeling dizzy, David spoke to the food writer who'd made his aunt's food very popular.\n\n\"William?\" the food man said. \"He used to like me to do recipes. The new boss likes simple food. William asked me\u2014well, he was probably joking, but he asked me where to take three business people to dinner who could make or break his whole future, so I said your aunt's place, and I know he called right away.\"\n\nDavid put down the phone with his whole brain repeating \"Oh no, Oh no,\" over and over.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" his aunt asked. \"You look scared.\"\n\n\"That man William...\" David sounded worried. \"What did you do to make him happy?\"\n\nPenelope wrinkled her forehead. \"I gave him some juice.\"\n\n\"Juice! And a big sorry? And his money back? And a big sorry?\"\n\nConfused, she shook her head. \"Just juice.\"\n\nHer nephew, scared, yelled at her, \"You silly. You very silly. That man will make us have no money. He writes for papers. And I owe him... God, I owe him... and he'll make us have no money because of last night.\"\n\nHis aunt said stubbornly, \"It's all your fault. It was you who said to turn away boats.\"\n\nIn LO city that afternoon the LK Group had a monthly meeting. The meeting had the three big bosses, the business managers of all the Group's many papers and magazines and some money helpers. No writers or journalists were ever invited to this kind of meeting: to Mrs. Rachel Dawkins\u2014acting as leader\u2014they were just the helpers.\n\nMrs. Dawkins talked about the urgent need for a new editor for the _Daily News_ \u2014fourth on the list\u2014as if she needed a butler. As long as he knew his place and was good at keeping things clean, she could ignore if he liked juice in the afternoon. The worried managers politely tried to say that the _current_ editor's liking for afternoon juice was most of the problem.\n\nRyan forcefully said that Adam William, ex-editor of the _CV paper,_ who they had at first considered, doesn't need to be thought of, and Frank declared that Adam William at a young age was too young, had too many school degrees and couldn't make people do what he wanted.\n\nSome of the managers held their breath, not least a smart but blocked woman from the _Daily News_ who knew from experience that when Frank and Ryan agreed _against_ a thing Mrs. Rachel Dawkins would suddenly be _for._ As the one who owned most shares she would _insist,_ and the two men would give up and agree.\n\nThe _Daily News_ manager knew that most great editors become top in their middle age: that like music leaders they either have or don't have the talent. She listened to Mr. Frank complaining to Mrs. Dawkins that also William couldn't even write, and then she read a part of only one of the copied sheets that Frank had been giving out all around the table from a folder, and felt the instant impact of the great William talent on the page. Not write? This was a big deal.\n\nLooking up, she saw Frank watching her. He smiled. He wants this apple, she thought.\n\nThat same day, David's first big anger against his aunt had grown painfully like a burn from a hot stove. He sat with his head in his hands, trying to figure out a way out of a lot of money problems.\n\nHis aunt kept saying, \"It was you who said no boats.\"\n\n\"Be quiet.\"\n\n\"But ...\"\n\n\"Forget the boats,\" David said loudly, and his aunt, dressed in a blue, silver and purple dress that David had chosen, went to her small room that held all that was left of her old home. She'd given David everything else. She couldn't stand his anger. She didn't like horses. She didn't like the man in the boat.\n\nDavid's plans relied entirely on Main Street being the talk of the town. Despite the newspaper writer's nice words, there hadn't been enough people interested in his horse races to fill even a few stalls, let alone the big stable he wanted. To trick the horse-racing people into thinking that he had enough horses, he'd made up a few and brought in others from their retirement fields; and in a moment of overconfidence he'd promised to sponsor a big race\u2014the David Cup. He thought fame would follow. Rich people, impressed, would eat at his restaurant and send him lots of horses. Fame and riches attracted fame and riches. He'd seen it. He, David, would have both.\n\nHis problem was, he was in too much of a hurry. He had that very morning sent out news to every newspaper that knew about racing. His invitations to every important person couldn't be taken back from the Mail. He would in effect be shouting, \"Look at me, I'm great,\" and the mean man in the boat could print and publish, \"Look at him, he's a liar,\" and the things people would write about him would be mocking instead of admiring.\n\nDavid let out a loud groan.\n\nBen bought a copy of the local newspaper the next day, Saturday, and winced his way from the headlines onwards.\n\nOn the racing page his racing writer, now moved to halfway down the page, was happy to let readers know that their very own horse trainer was sponsoring a race the following Saturday. \"Be there!\" \"Go for it!\" said the _Voice._ \"Kevin can win.\"\n\n\"Run to the big race!\" said the food column. \"Kevin's double win is amazing!\"\n\nTo feel better when he was sad and upset, Bill stretched for a pencil and paper and wrote about his feelings.\n\nHe wrote with a lot of energy, and was very upset. He wrote about feeling embarrassed and wanting to get back at someone. He made fun of Pauline for the fancy clothes she wore and for not allowing boats. He was very mean about the lies of the glamorous racing stable and he made fun of Kevin himself for being a show-off, a fast-talker, a person who lied to himself. He wrote a piece that was meant to hurt and destroy. It would probably never be read by others.\n\nOne of Kevin's fancy press releases ended up in the office of the Lionheart News Group's F. Harold. F. Harold, was about to throw it away, but he saw the words \"big race\" and took a quick look at it.\n\n\"Warm Welcome,\" he read, and smiled. He did not have a good memory of the headwaiter.\n\n\"Race sponsored by trainer Kevin, co-owner of the big race. Lunch. Restaurant chef. Chance to buy a share in a team!\"\n\nF. Harold, who liked to bet, decided to go.\n\nBill, Kevin and F. Harold met at the racetrack.\n\nDuring the last week, the warm days of August had been replaced by the cool mornings of early September.\n\nDuring that week Bill wrote five opinion pieces and sent them to the big papers in LO city that had published his work before. They were nice on the phone, but no one needed an editor.\n\nDuring that week Kevin finally received a half-paid-for but talented horse from the team fixer, complete with an entry in the Kevin's Cup. Kevin knew how to train horses and make them look good. When the team horse walked before the Cup, its coat shone in the sun.\n\nKevin spent the rest of his week borrowing money and using up all the food in the restaurant.\n\nDuring that week F. Harold visited the managers of the Lionheart Group one by one and left them all liking Bill. Russell agreed. Mrs. Robin, still thinking her colleagues were going to say no, said, \"I think you're wrong to leave him, Harold.\"\n\nHolding his special invitation, F. Harold walked from his big car up to the private box where Kevin, though now running out of money, was trying to make a good future for himself by giving out a lot of champagne.\n\nDavid, not knowing half the people drinking his fizzy juice, said a big hello to Frank and put an arm around his guest's shoulders. Frank, who was a serious businessman, didn't like the arm around him but he didn't move away. Instead, he looked at David and asked him why William, the previous editor of the \"CV\", was treated so badly by the people of Mainstream Mile.\n\nTo Frank, this was an important question: he wanted to know what would make William angry, and what would stop him from acting on his anger. Frank often judged people by their reactions when they were angry. Unless Mrs. Robin, who had overruled him last time they chose an editor, said otherwise, Frank usually made good choices.\n\nDavid quickly took his arm off Frank. He had been feeling unwell all week and couldn't sleep or eat properly. Every day he was worried about what was going to happen. But he was surprised that the man standing in front of him didn't match the description of the angry writer he had heard about. This couldn't be the angry man in the boat.\n\nFrank said, \"As William's guest, I was treated badly and I don't know why. Tell me why all the newspapers and magazines I own shouldn't speak badly about you.\"\n\n\"But ... he came in a boat,\" stammered David, surprised by this new problem.\n\n\"He ... what?\"\n\nDavid quickly left and went into the men's room. He had been taking medicine for a tummy bug, but nothing could prepare him for the big problem he saw coming.\n\nFrank, still not happy, went to watch the horses walk around the parade ring. David's big Cup was two races away. Frank passed the time by winning a little money on the Tote.\n\nBill went to the races in MA city after reading too much about David's successes all week. David this and David that ... Kevin's horses, Kevin the trainer, Kevin at the river. Every racing page seemed to have a free lunch. The _CO paper_ published a happy encouragement, but the racing writer himself stayed at home to watch on TV with a couple of cans.\n\nThinking about \"know your enemy,\" Benjamin went to MA place races to see what Kevin looked like. He saw the big show but not the man himself, who was feeling sick in the bathroom. Instead, he met with the big decision maker who had said no to any dreams of _troubadour_ days.\n\nFrank had expected more than silence from his host, Adam. He'd seen the clenched fists. He now asked the reason clearly.\n\n\"Why did you want to hit that restaurant's waiter? And why didn't you?\"\n\nBenjamin explained, \"He was rude to me because the restaurant's boss told him to. You don't get mad at the messenger because of the message.\"\n\nHe took out a paper from his pocket and gave it to Frank, a copy of the strong words he'd written about Kevin. Frank looked at it and started reading, eyebrows slowly rising.\n\n\"Don't give that paper to anyone but Kevin,\" Benjamin said. \"I didn't write it for others to see.\"\n\nKevin, looking pale, came down to the parade ring before the Kevin Cup and acted bravely as owner, sponsor and big boss, all to get attention from the media. Side by side, Benjamin and Frank watched from far and felt sick.\n\nTwenty minutes later their sickness got worse, as the group horse, running fast, won the Kevin Cup.\n\nKevin's happiness and growing pride filled the TV screens of the country. He said he was the best trainer of the future, and, he believed it. Winning the race solved at least half of his money problems, and surely, now, the rich and famous would come to his stable.\n\nIt was while he was showing off in front of many cameras that Frank gave him Benjamin's strong words.\n\nThe clapping crowds moved on to the next race. Success at races was short-lived.\n\nKevin stood reading the surprising paper in his hand and he faced his two unhappy customers feeling that even though he'd won the big prize he was going to lose it. Lose it over a single bet. It wasn't fair. He'd worked so hard ....\n\nIn upset sadness he said to Adam, \"What do you want for not publishing this article?\"\n\n\"Blackmail?\" asked Benjamin, surprised.\n\nDavid stuttered. \"Give the horse? Will that help?\"\n\n\"It's not yours to give,\" Benjamin replied.\n\n\"What then? Money? Not the... \" David's voice was filled with fear. \"You can't ... you can't do that...\"\n\nBenjamin saw the real fear and thought it was enough.\n\n\"I'll take,\" he said slowly, \"an apology, and my money back... and a sign in your place and on your menu saying that people are welcome, especially if they have reserved a table.\"\n\nDavid blinked, swallowed, wavered, clenched his teeth and finally nodded. He didn't like it\u2014he hated to lose\u2014but it was better than the worst.\n\nFrank reached forward, took the piece of paper from David's hands and tore it up.\n\nHe said to Benjamin, \"Come and see me at my place on Monday.\"\nSTORY\n\n_\"Story\" was asked for by_ The Big Paper _some time ago (three thousand words, please)._\n\n_\"Story,\" set in a place with horses, U.S.A., tells how to take a valuable horse and her baby._\n\n_Don't do it!_\n\nFor three years after his father passed away, Matthew gave up his job. To do well he needed a friend, and friends as skilled as his father were hard to find. Matthew looked at his savings, listed his things and decided that with a little work to fill the days he could live comfortably, waiting for life to bring a suitable replacement.\n\nA day's travel put him a good distance from the place of his sad memories, although they themselves traveled with him, as hard to escape as habit. The Big Food Company gave him a month's trial as a seller and when the orders grew everywhere he went, a permanent job. Matthew relaxed behind the wheel of the company car and easily moved around his new area, visiting horse farms and race places and convincing their managers that even if The Big Food's products were no better than anyone else's, at least they were no worse.\n\nThe customers of The Big Food saw a big man in his late thirties with a serious face and a way of narrowing his eyes. The usual friendly expression of a seller was nowhere to be seen, nor was there any sweetness in his voice. The one thing which brought out the handshakes, the pens and the checkbooks was his impressive knowledge of horses. He was really good at understanding horses and could give good advice without taking credit for it. \n\n\"You've tried changing the horse's shoe, right?\" he would ask, or \"Don't vitamin shots help build strong bones?\" People started to see him as a trusted friend.\n\nHe was doing well.\n\nBut, he was having problems. He couldn't sleep well. When he slept, he would always wake up from a bad dream, his heart beating fast, his skin cold and sweaty. He always dreamt about the same thing\u2014his father's scary death. Sometimes he saw his father's face, dead but still talking, with red liquid coming out of the mouth. Sometimes he saw a big black wheel touching his father's belly.\n\nSometimes he felt like he was inside his father's body, slipping and getting hurt by a big car. Sometimes, but not so often, he saw the face of another man who was there, a mean man in dark clothes, looking at his dying father and not helping him, not saying anything.\n\nEvery morning, Matthew would stand tired under the shower, washing his body and wishing he could also clean his mind. Every day, getting into the car, he left his night thoughts behind and thought about the future. He saw baby horses born, watched them grow, followed their lives at markets and beyond. He knew a lot about the horses he fed with special food.\n\nAfter almost three years, he knew many people\u2014but he didn't have many friends. He knew every horse in a big area and many that had been sold. He was the best salesman in his company. And his bad dreams were becoming less and less.\n\nOne late afternoon in the early spring, he met Jack. Jack was a tall thin young man with light hair, wearing old clothes and carrying some extra clothes in a bag. Matthew, feeling happy, thought he was a college kid on vacation and agreed to take him to the next town.\n\n\"Have I seen you before?\" he asked, feeling a bit confused, as Jack sat in the front seat next to him.\n\n\"I don't think so.\"\n\n\"Well ...\" He thought about it. \"Yes, I've seen you. A few days ago. Where was that?\"\n\nJack took his time to answer. Then he said, \"I go up and down this road a lot. Maybe you saw me asking for a ride.\"\n\nMatthew nodded several times. \"Yes, yes. That's it.\" He sat back in his seat, happy to have figured out the small puzzle. He liked to be sure of things. \"That's where I've seen you. On the road. More than once.\"\n\nThe young man nodded briefly and said he was glad Matthew had stopped for him because he had a meeting with his friend.\n\n\"I don't usually stop for people asking for rides,\" Matthew said, and thought with fun that three easy years must have made him kinder.\n\nThey drove happily together for a little bit and passed by the white fences of a big farm. Matthew looked quickly at the small groups of animals eating the new spring grass but didn't say what he was thinking.\n\nIt was Jack who said, \"It's strange you never see a black and white horse.\"\n\n\"You know about horses?\" Matthew asked, surprised.\n\n\"Sure. I grew up with them.\"\n\nMatthew asked him where, but the young man didn't say much. He said he'd had some problems at home and left quickly, and he didn't really want to talk about it. Matthew smiled. He dropped Jack in the next town and drove on towards where he was going, and it was only when he stopped to fill up his car that he stopped smiling as quickly as people who lose money.\n\nJack had taken his wallet. Matthew kept it in the inside pocket of his jacket, and his jacket, because the car was warm, had been lying on the back seat of the car. He remembered Jack putting his bag on the floor behind the front seats, and he remembered him leaning over to pick it up. His face became serious, something his friends had never seen, and his eyes became very focused. The amount of money he had lost was small compared to how upset he was.\n\nFor several days he drove around his area looking for Jack, remembering things about him from their drive together. The pause when Matthew had said he'd seen him before. The not saying where he'd come from. The quick way he'd seen and taken the wallet. Matthew looked for him with a serious face but without luck, and finally after two or three weeks he accepted the fact that the young man had gone to another place, where angry people in cars were not looking for him.\n\nEvery month Matthew visited the farthest farm in his area, and it was as he left there, early one evening, that he saw Jack again. Standing by the road, asking for a ride, maybe pausing when he saw Matthew's car.\n\nMatthew drove quickly next to him, stopped quickly, opened his door, and stood up smoothly outside it. For a tall man he moved like well-oiled toy, exact and effective; and he held a toy gun. \"Get in the car,\" he said.\n\nJack looked at the toy gun pointing straight at his tummy and turned pale. He swallowed, his throat making a funny movement in his neck, and slowly did as he was told.\n\n\"I'll give back the toys,\" he said worriedly, as Matthew slid onto the seat beside him. The toy gun was held loosely now, pointing at the floor, but both knew this could change.\n\n\"I should tell the teacher,\" Matthew said.\n\nThe young boy just shook his head.\n\n\"Or you could do a small task for me instead.\"\n\nThe young boy looked at Matthew's serious eyes and visibly shivered.\n\n\"Is this a game?\" he asked him.\n\n\"I'll give you toys, if you're good.\"\n\n\"Doing what?\"\n\n\"Collecting toy horses,\" Matthew said.\n\nHe made his plans as carefully as in the old days with his father, secretly buying a two-toy horse trailer and a toy car to pull it, and hiding them away in a city toy garage. He decided against the large type of motor toy horsevan he had used with his father, mostly because of the scary dreams about those wheels. Besides, he was not sure if his new friend would be suitable for long-term planning. They would do one trial run\u2014a test, Matthew thought, before he offered a steady partnership for the future.\n\nJack had greeted Matthew's announcement of his chosen game with a big happy smile.\n\n\"Sure,\" he said. \"I can collect toy horses. Which ones?\"\n\n\"It's not so easy round here,\" Matthew said. \"Toy stables and stud farms have good security systems.\" But he knew them all; he had been studying them for three years.\n\nHe gave Jack a list of toys to buy and some toy money for himself, and two days later they looked at the resulting toy wrench and bolt cutters together.\n\n\"There is no time to waste,\" Matthew said. \"We will start tomorrow night.\"\n\n\"So soon?\"\n\nMatthew smiled. \"We are taking two toy mares. One is near to having a foal. We want her safely away before that happens.\"\n\nJack looked at him in long surprise. \"Why don't we take good fast race horses?\" he said.\n\n\"They're too easily identified. Tattoo marks and registrations see to that. But toy foals, now. Newborn toy foals. Who can tell which is what? So we take a very good mommy horse, who is going to have a baby by a top daddy horse, and we take her far away to sell her at the end of the trip to someone who is happy to get a baby horse with great parents for less money than it would cost at a sale.\n\n\"The star baby horse is switched soon after birth with any other baby horse around, and is named and marked in its new name. Its new owner knows what he really has, so after racing it he keeps it for having more baby horses. Some of the people I've worked with in the past have made lots of money from these baby horses. I always get a little bit of the money.\"\n\nJack listened with his mouth open.\n\n\"This is not just taking things,\" Matthew said with some pride. \"This is like taking a famous painting.\"\n\n\"But what happens to the mommy horse afterwards? And to the other baby horse?\"\n\n\"Some of the people I work with care about doing the right thing. For these people, for some money, I take the mommy horse and baby horse and leave them in any field that's handy. If the person who owns the field is honest, she gets found and sent home.\"\n\nJack did not ask what happened when the person did not care about doing the right thing. He swallowed.\n\n\"Do you already have a person who wants to buy the two we're taking tomorrow?\" he asked.\n\n\"Of course. You don't take a famous painting just because.\" Matthew laughed at the idea, showing strong teeth. \"When we've got the mommy horses I'll tell you where to go. You will go alone. And you will bring back the money.\"\n\nJack was surprised again. \"Can you trust me?\" he asked.\n\n\"I want to find out.\"\n\nThe next evening when it was getting dark they got the new car they bought and attached the trailer. Matthew had trouble moving the two connected things in the small yard around the garage, and Jack, trying to help, went to the back of the trailer to tell how much room there was for going backwards.\n\n\"Get away from there,\" Matthew said quickly. \"Get away right now.\" He stood up out of the car and Jack saw that he was shaking.\n\n\"I was only ...\" he started.\n\n\"You are never to go behind the trailer. Understand? Never.\"\n\n\"Well, okay. If you say so.\"\n\nMatthew took a few big breaths and wiped his hands on his pants. He was very surprised at how strong his own reaction was. Three years, he thought, had hardly made the scary feeling less at all. He wondered if, because he was so nervous, it might be better to stop the whole thing. He thought about why it took him three years to go back to his work. Maybe he was scared deep inside.\n\nHe licked his lips. His heart slowed down. This time, there would be no surprise when he took the horses. Last time, a person he was selling to told the police about him, but this time it was safe. This person had bought three good young horses before and was happy to hear he could have two more. Matthew relaxed back into the car, and Jack sat next to him.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Jack asked.\n\n\"I saw a bad thing happen once. A man fell behind a big horse cart.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nMatthew closed his mouth, not wanting to talk about the scary details, but he couldn't stop thinking about them. The surprise. Bright lights from the police before his dad was safe in the car with him. He had to move a little to get away from the police cars and the fence. He had to go fast backward\u2014he would never forget his dad's shout. Never.\n\nJust one shout, then quiet. He got out of the car and saw the car hurt his dad, saw the blood...and another man, a policeman, just standing there not helping.\n\n\"Help him!\" Matthew had said quickly.\n\n\"Help him yourself.\"\n\nHe jumped back into the car, scared and knowing his dad was gone.\n\nGone. Past help, past saving, past everything.\n\nHe moved the big car forward off his dad and kept going. He surprised the police. He drove fast for a little while, and before they caught up he left the car and ran into the forest.\n\nThe police didn't know his name, which he never told to the people he sold to. All the police saw was him running away, which was not enough, and getting away was the least of his worries.\n\nHe always remembered the face of the policeman who looked at his dad. A high-ranking policeman, wearing a badge. He saw him too often in his bad dreams...\n\nMatthew shook off the sad past and focused on the job at hand. He thought he would feel excited, happy, his heart racing. He didn't feel any of these things. He felt old.\n\n\"Let's go,\" said Jack. \"Or it will be morning again before we finish.\"\n\nMatthew nodded slowly and they both began the task. Half an hour later when they stopped in a quiet side road, he had managed to push away his worries and was ready to face the next half hour calmly and sensibly.\n\nThey got out of the car quietly and opened the back of the car. The night was all around them\u2014small sounds, a gentle wind, stars appearing in groups between slowly moving clouds. Cars on the main road half a mile away went past now and then, more a flash of lights than a loud noise. Matthew waited for his eyes to get used to the dark, then he gently touched the young man's arm.\n\n\"This way,\" he said. His voice was a soft whisper and when he moved his feet made no sound on the grass. Jack followed him, surprised at the big man's quietness and easy speed.\n\n\"Where are we?\" Jack whispered. \"Whose horses are we taking?\"\n\n\"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nThey came to a gate, locked. The tool made it easy. They went through into the field. Matthew whistled softly in the dark, a charming sound.\n\nHe pulled out a handful of horse food and called gently into the darkness ahead.\n\n\"Come here, girl. Come here.\"\n\nThere was a soft sound and movement somewhere out there in the darkness. Then they came, slowly, curiously, moving towards the sound of his voice. They ate the food he held out and didn't mind when the two men took hold of their head collars.\n\n\"You go first,\" Matthew said softly to Jack. \"I'll be right behind you.\"\n\nThey went easily, the two big horses, heavy with their unborn babies. Out of the gate and down the road to the car. Easy as always, thought Matthew, once you knew what to do. Jack led his horse into the back of the car and tied her there.\n\nAnd that was when the scary part started again. That was when the lights shone out, blinding Matthew's eyes. That was when the man came out to face him. The same man. The face from the dreams. The same unkind face, dark clothes, high-rank badges.\n\n\"Matthew,\" he was saying, \"I am arresting you ...\"\n\nMatthew wasn't listening. He was thinking wildly that it couldn't be true. This particular customer would never betray him. Never.\n\nThe police took the horse from his hands and put handcuffs on Matthew's wrists.\n\n\"How did you come here?\" he asked in surprise.\n\n\"We have been searching for you for a long time,\" said the police officer with a proud smile. \"A few weeks ago, we found you. But we had no strong proof against you, so we have been watching you.\"\n\nJack came out of the house, and Matthew thought it was tough for the boy, getting caught on his first mistake. The stern police officer walked over to him, looking happy.\n\nHe did not bring out any chains. He patted Jack on the shoulder.\n\n\"Good job, Officer Jack,\" he said.\nA CARROT FOR A HORSE\n\nSuddenly, in the late 20th century, I was asked by a famous AM country book to write a small story\u2014length and topic were my choice. I hadn't written a small story before, but the result, \"A Carrot for a Horse,\" must have been good because they invited me to stay in LE city with the book team there to cover the big horse race. I was asked to write a race-day story for the big horse race issue the following year.\n\nCharlie stood and sweated with the carrot in his hand. His head felt light and he couldn't feel his feet on the ground, and his heart beat loudly in his ear. A sick feeling shivered in his tummy.\n\nBetrayal was making him feel sick.\n\nThe time: early in the morning. The morning: cold. The strong swirling wind was getting ready to blow harder, and a thick cloud was fighting against the hint of light. In the clean horse houses around the yard, the sleeping horses hit a random foot against a wooden wall, rattled a chain, sneezed the hay dust out of a wet black nose.\n\nCharlie was late. Two hours late. He'd been told to give the carrot to the tall horse early in the morning, but early in the morning it had been raining hard\u2014hard, slanting rain that soaked a man in one minute flat, and Charlie had thought it would be too hard explaining away a soaking early in the morning. Charlie had thought it would be better to wait until the rain stopped, it couldn't make any difference. Early morning, later morning, what the heck. Charlie always knew better than anyone else.\n\nCharlie was a thin, unhappy nineteen-year-old who always felt the world should give him more than he got. He had been a bad-tempered, arguing child and a strongly defiant teenager. The habit of always being angry was what was causing problems for him now as a grown-up. Not that Cameron would have agreed, of course. Cameron never agreed with anyone if he could avoid it. Always knew better, did Cameron.\n\nHe was not ready for how strong the feelings of fear were. He usually did not respect anyone in charge (and no one in charge had ever really hit him across his grumpy mouth). Horses had never scared him because he was used to them and had grown up riding all kinds of animals easily. He believed in his heart that no one could really ride better than he could. He was wrong.\n\nHe looked worriedly over his shoulder, and the moving pain in his tummy got worse. He felt a strong need to use the bathroom. That simply couldn't happen, he thought wildly. He'd heard about people needing to use the bathroom when they were scared. He hadn't believed it. It couldn't happen. Now, all of a sudden, he feared it could. He held his muscles tight and the pain slowly went away. It left new sweat all over his skin and no spit in his mouth.\n\nThe house was dark. Upstairs, behind the black open window with the light curtain moving in the cold air, slept Adam, the trainer of the forty-three racehorses in the stables below. Adam usually didn't sleep deeply. His ears were sharper than half a dozen guard dogs', his helpers said.\n\nCameron forced himself to turn his head away, to walk in view of that window, to take the ten open steps down to the brown horse's stall.\n\nIf the boss woke up and saw him ... Gosh, he thought angrily, he hadn't expected it to be like this. Just a simple walk down the yard to give a carrot to the tall brown horse. Feeling guilty and scared and like a traitor. They ignored his angry mind and made his body feel strange instead.\n\nHe couldn't see anything wrong with the carrot. It hadn't been cut in half and filled with bad things and tied together again. He'd tried pulling the thick end out like a plug, and that hadn't worked either. The carrot just looked like any old carrot, any old carrot you'd watch your mom chop up to put in a soup. Any old carrot you'd give to any old horse. Not a very young, juicy carrot or a very old carrot, twisted and hard. Just any old ordinary _carrot_.\n\nBut strangers didn't ask you to give any old carrot to one special horse in the middle of the night. They didn't give you more than you earned in half a year when you said you'd do it. Any old carrot didn't come wrapped carefully alone in a plastic bag inside an empty cheese-cracker packet, given to you by a stranger in a parking lot after dark in a town six miles from the stables. You didn't give any old treat in the middle of the night to a brown horse who was going to run in a big race the next morning.\n\nBen was feeling dizzy from holding his breath when he finally reached the brown horse's home. Trying not to cough or make any noise, he carefully started to open the door, little by little.\n\nIn the daytime, he could open and close these doors easily. But now, in the dark, he had to move very slowly and carefully.\n\nHe finally got the door open without making too much noise. The top part of the door opened outwards. There was no loud sound, just the quiet sound of metal moving against metal. Ben took a deep, shaky breath, trying to stay calm. He felt scared, but he reached his arm through the open door anyway.\n\nInside, the brown horse was asleep, standing up. The door opening made the air move around and woke the horse up a bit. He could smell the treat. He could also smell Ben: he could smell that Ben was scared.\n\n\"Come on,\" Ben whispered quietly. \"Come on, then, boy.\"\n\nThe horse moved his nose towards the treat and then, slowly, moved his feet. He took the treat from Ben's hand, chewing it slowly. When he finished eating, he looked for more, but there was nothing else. The door closed again, and the smell of Ben and the treat faded away. The horse went back to sleep, standing in his usual way.\n\nIn his stomach, the treat, which had something inside it to make him sleepy, started to work. It was slow, and it had started later than it was supposed to.\n\nAdam was in his yard, watching his workers load the brown horse into the big truck that would take him to the race. He watched everything carefully, but he was feeling happy inside. The brown horse was the best one he had: it won a lot, people liked it, and it made him proud and rich. The big race at CH place was perfect for the horse, and Mr. Morrison was good at getting a horse ready for a special race. Nobody thought the brown horse would lose. The news writers said it would win and the people betting on the race were scared to bet against it. Mr. Morrison felt a little happy and smiled a bit as the men closed the big doors of the horse truck and drove it away.\n\nMr. Morrison didn't usually show his feelings. He usually looked focused and unhappy. Being like this made him good at training race horses, but not many people liked him. He knew this, but he didn't care. He cared more about being successful and respected than being liked.\n\nAcross the place, a boy named Chick was watching the horse truck leave. He looked unhappy. Mr. Morrison thought Chick was annoying. He was always complaining, rude, and trying to get more money. Mr. Morrison didn't think life should be easy for boys. He thought a little hardship was good for them. Chick didn't agree about when things were too hard.\n\nChick saw Mr. Morrison's unhappy look and felt scared. He felt guilty and worried. He thought Mr. Morrison couldn't know there was anything wrong with the horse, or else he wouldn't have sent him to the race. The horse looked fine, just like always. Maybe there was nothing wrong with the carrot... Maybe it was the wrong carrot... Chick looked around nervously, knowing he was trying to trick himself. The horse might look fine, but he wasn't.\n\nAt the races, Mr. Morrison got his horse ready, and Chick watched him from a little distance, trying to hide in the excited crowd that wanted a close look at the favorite horse. More people wanted to see the brown horse than any of the other seven horses, and the betters had made their odds shorter. Mr. Morrison was starting to worry. He made the horse's belt tight and fixed the buckles automatically, knowing that he was starting to feel worried instead of satisfied. The horse was not acting like himself. He wasn't moving around a lot, wasn't nipping playfully, wasn't reacting to the crowd; this was a horse that usually acted like a movie star in front of people. He must not be feeling well, and if he wasn't feeling well, he wouldn't win. Matthew made a serious face. If the horse was not feeling good enough to win, he would rather it not run at all. Losing when everyone thought you would win would be embarrassing. Especially because Matthew's oldest son, Thomas, was going to ride the horse. The news people would say mean things about both of them.\n\nMatthew made a choice and called for the animal doctor.\n\nThe rules of horse racing in EN country said very clearly that if a horse was supposed to race, only an animal doctor could say it was okay to not race in the last bit of time before the race started. The CH place animal doctor came and looked at the brown horse and, after talking with Matthew, took it to a quiet place and checked if it was sick.\n\n\"His temperature is normal,\" the animal doctor told Matthew.\n\n\"I don't like how he looks.\"\n\n\"I can't find anything wrong.\"\n\n\"He's not feeling good,\" Matthew said.\n\nThe animal doctor made a face and shook his head. There was nothing clearly wrong with the horse, and he knew he would get in trouble if he let Matthew not race the horse because it didn't look good. Not only that, this was the third time he had to think about letting a horse not race that afternoon. He said no to the other two, and the brown horse was not looking any worse.\n\n\"He has to race,\" the animal doctor said for sure, making up his mind.\n\nMatthew was very mad and went to find a rule keeper, who came and looked at the brown horse and listened to the animal doctor and said that the horse would have to race whether Matthew liked it or not. Unless, that was, Matthew wanted to make the horse's owner who was not there pay a big fine?\n\nWith a hard face, Matthew put the saddle back on the brown horse, and a helper led him out to the show area, where most of the waiting people cheered and a few smart ones looked closely and quickly went to change their bets.\n\nWith a shake of fear, Charlie saw the horse come back out and for the first time felt bad about what he'd done. That silly animal doctor, he thought very madly. He can't see what's right in front of him, he wouldn't see a barn if it was really close. Anything that happened from then on was the animal doctor's fault, Charlie thought. The animal doctor's problem, for sure. The man was causing trouble, letting a horse run in a race with bad stuff in its eyes.\n\nThomas joined his father in the show area and together they were watching with worried faces as the brown horse walked slowly around the round walking track. Thomas was a strong, short professional horse rider in his late years with a happy smile and a kind way of thinking about life that was very different from his father's. He had the same strong mind but had used it to leave home at eighteen to ride for other trainers, and had only agreed to ride for his father when he could make his own rules. Adam, as a result, respected him a lot. Together, they had won a lot of races.\n\nCharlie didn't really dislike Thomas, even though, as he saw it, Thomas was in his way. Sometimes Adam let Charlie ride a race if Thomas was busy or couldn't make the weight. Charlie had to share these chances with two or three other boys in the yard who were, even if he didn't believe it, as good as he was at riding. But though the jealousy made him feel bad and the mean words came out sharp and sour, he had never really come to hate Thomas. There was something about Thomas that you couldn't hate, no matter how good the reason. Charlie hadn't thought about the fact that it would be Thomas who would have to deal with the effects of the carrot. He had only thought about his own gain. He wished now that it had been some other rider. Anyone but Thomas.\n\nCharlie suddenly knew in his mind as he looked at Thomas and Adam standing there worried that he had never believed the horse would actually run in the race. The stranger, Charlie said to himself, had told him the horse would be too sick to run. I wouldn't have done it, else, Charlie thought. I wouldn't have done it. It's very dangerous, riding a drugged horse. I wouldn't have done that to Thomas. It's not my fault he's going to ride a drugged horse, it's that animal doctor's fault for not seeing. It's that stranger's fault, he told me the horse wouldn't be fit to start ....\n\nCharlie remembered with a bad feeling that he'd been two hours late with the carrot. Maybe if he'd been on time the drug would have come out more and the animal doctor would have seen ....\n\nCharlie quickly pushed away this terrible thought because no one can tell how much any particular horse will react to a drug or how quickly it will work, and he told himself again that the stranger had promised him the horse wouldn't even start\u2014though the stranger had not in fact said any such thing. The stranger, who was at the races, was very happy with the way things were going and was about to make a lot of money.\n\nThe bell rang for the riders to get on their horses. Charlie put his hands in his pockets and tried not to think about what could happen to a rider jumping at high speed on a drugged horse. Charlie's body started to feel strange again: he could feel the sweat running down his back and the heartbeat in his ears.\n\nWhat if he told them, he thought. What if he just ran out there and told Tommy not to ride the horse, it couldn't jump properly, it would surely fall, it could hurt him easily because it wouldn't be able to react in time.\n\nWhat if he did. How they'd look at him. His mind went blank thinking about their angry faces because it didn't match his high self-confidence. He couldn't, just _couldn't_ face their anger. And it might not stop there. Even if he told them and saved Tommy's life, they might tell the police. He wouldn't be surprised. And he could end up getting in trouble. Even in jail. They wouldn't do that to him, not to _him._ He wasn't going to give them the chance. He should have been paid more. Paid more because he was worth more. If he'd been paid more, he wouldn't have taken the money from the stranger. Adam had only himself to blame.\n\nTommy would have to take the risk. After all, the horse didn't look too bad, and the animal doctor had said it was okay, hadn't he, and maybe the food being two hours late was a good thing and it wouldn't have done its job properly yet, and in fact it was really thanks to Charlie if it hadn't; only thanks to him that the medicine was two hours late and that nothing much would happen, really, anyway. Nothing much would happen. Maybe the horse wouldn't actually _win,_ but Tommy would be okay. Of course he would.\n\nThe riders climbed up on their horses, Tommy among them. He saw Charlie in the crowd, watching, and waved to him. The wish to tell and the fear of telling made Charlie feel like he was being pulled apart.\n\nTommy took the reins and clicked his tongue and led the horse slowly onto the track. He was sad that the horse wasn't feeling well but not worried. It hadn't crossed his mind, or Adam's, that the horse might be sick because of the medicine. He rode down to the start line standing in his stirrups, thinking about his plan now that he couldn't rely on his horse being at its best. It would be a hard race to win now. Too bad.\n\nCharlie watched him go. He hadn't decided, to tell or not to tell. The moment just passed him by. When Tommy had gone he lifted his heavy feet and walked off to the stands to watch the race, and in every corner of his mind little excuses popped up like weeds. A feeling of shame tried to sneak in, but he pushed it away quickly. They should have given him more things. It was their mistake, not his.\n\nHe thought about the pile of paper the new person had given him with the orange food. Things before the job. The new person had believed in him, which was more than most people seemed to. He'd gone into the washroom and counted the papers, counted them twice, and they were all there, just like the new person had promised. He had never had so many things at once in his life before... maybe he never would again, he thought. And if he'd told Adam and Thomas about the bad stuff, he would have to give up those things, give up the things and more... \n\nFinding a place to hide the things was hard. The pile of used papers was big, and he didn't want his mom to find them when she was looking through his stuff. He'd solved the problem for now by rolling them up and putting them in a tin with many colors which used to have sweet food but which he used for years for keeping brushes and shiny stuff for cleaning his shoes. He had covered the things with a cloth and pushed the tin back on the shelf in his room where it always stood. He thought he would probably have to find a safer place, in the end. And he'd have to be careful how he used the things\u2014there would be too many questions asked if he just went out and got a car. He'd always wanted a car... and now he had the things for one... and he still couldn't get the car. It wasn't right. Not right at all. If they'd given him more... Enough for a car... \n\nUp on the high part of the place set aside for people who train horses and the people who ride them, a small person with warm dark eyes touched Charlie's arm and talked to him, though it took a few moments before Charlie started to listen.\n\n\"... I see you are here, and you're free, will you ride it?\"\n\n\"What?\" said Charlie, not really listening.\n\n\"My horse in the beginner race,\" said the little man quickly. \"Of course, if you don't want to...\"\n\n\"I didn't say that,\" Charlie talked softly. \"Ask the boss. If he says I can, well, I can.\"\n\nThe small trainer walked across the place to where Adam was watching the brown horse very closely through the glasses and asked the same question he'd asked Charlie.\n\n\"Charlie? Yes, he can ride it for you, if you want him to.\" Adam gave the other trainer a little bit of his attention and went back to watching his horse.\n\n\"My helper fell from his horse in the first race,\" the small man explained. \"So many people are running in the Newbie Hurdle that we don't have enough helpers. I saw your boy, so I asked him quickly, see?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Matthew, not really interested. \"He's okay, but don't expect too much.\" Matthew was worried because his horse was not moving well. He wondered if the horse was getting sick.\n\n\"My horse won't win. Just out for practice, you might say.\"\n\n\"Yes. Okay, talk to it with Charlie.\" Matthew thought other stables also had sick horses. His horse couldn't have picked a worse day to get sick.\n\nCharlie, who usually liked riding, was so busy that the small man wished he hadn't asked him. Charlie was only thinking about the horse, who seemed ready to start. Charlie told himself that everything was okay. It was silly to be so worried.\n\nThe start of the race was down the track to the left, with two jumps before the horses passed the people watching and turned left again. Because it was a jumping race, there were tapes instead of stalls, and Toddy was near the inside rails, ready to take the shortest way home.\n\nIn the bookmakers' area, they were offering better chances now and some were even. The horse had run past them on his way to the start, not looking his best. The bookmakers were feeling more hopeful. They thought they would have a bad day, but if the horse lost, they would win. One of them would win a lot\u2014just like he would lose a lot if the horse won.\n\nAdam (since 1898), real name Harry, had done this a few times before. He looked at his hands, not shaking. There was always a risk that the boy he had paid would get scared at the last minute and not do the job. Always a chance, it was. But this time, this boy, he was pretty sure of. You couldn't go wrong if you picked a little show-off with a big grudge. They were easy, every time.\n\nHarry was a smart middle-aged man from the east of LO city. He never really knew right from wrong, and he thought that if you could cheat a little now and then, why not? Taxes were hurting betting.... you had to make money fast where you could ... and there was nothing quite so sure or fast as making money on a sure thing and knowing for certain that you weren't going to have to pay out.\n\nDown at the start line the starter put his hand on the lever and the ropes went up with a rush. Thomas kicked his brown horse gently in the ribs. From his spot on top of the stands the speaker started his talk. \"They're off, and the first to show is the gray ...\" Adam and Cameron watched with hearts beating from different types of worry, and Henry closed his eyes and hoped.\n\nThomas moved forward at once into the first three, the brown horse beneath him running strongly, pulling at the bit, thudding his hooves into the ground. He seemed to be going well enough, Thomas thought. Strong. Like a train.\n\nThe first fence was only one hundred yards ahead now, coming nearer. With a practiced eye Thomas measured the distance, knew the brown horse's stride would meet it right, collected himself for the jump and gave the horse the signal to take off. There was no response. Nothing. The brown horse made no attempt to bunch his muscles, no attempt to gather himself onto his haunches, no attempt to waver or slow down or take any avoiding action whatsoever. For one unbelievable second Thomas knew he was facing a big disaster.\n\nThe brown horse ran straight into the three-foot-thick, chest-high solid fence with an impact that brought a gasp of horror from the stands. He flipped over the fence with a flurry of thrashing legs, threw Thomas off in front of him and fell down on top and rolled over him.\n\nCameron felt as if the world were turning gray. The colors drained out of everything and he was halfway to fainting. Oh no, he thought. Oh no. _Thomas._\n\nThe brown horse scrambled to his feet and ran away. He followed the other horses toward the second fence, stretching out into a relentless stride, into a full-fledged thundering racing pace.\n\nHe hit the second fence as straight and hard as the first. The crowd gasped and cried out. Again the flip, the spread-eagled legs, the crashing fall, the instant recovery. The brown horse surged up again and ran on.\n\nHe came up past the stands, moving unstoppable, the stirrups swinging out from the empty saddle, bits of foam flying back now from his mouth, big dark patches of sweat staining his sides. Where the track curved round to the left, the brown horse ran straight on. Straight ahead, across the curve, to hit the fence around the outside of the track. He hit the hard wood with his chest and broke it in two. Again he fell and got up quickly. But this time he didn't run away. This time he took three steps, hurting and limping, and then he stood still.\n\nBack at the fence, Tommy was on the ground with helpers looking over him with worry. Adam ran down from the seats towards the track and didn't know which way to go first, to his son or his horse. Cameron's legs gave out and he sat down, confused, on the concrete steps. And down in the betting area, Henry's first happy reaction was spoiled by wondering if Tommy was hurt badly, would that silly boy Cameron be scared enough to stay quiet.\n\nAdam turned towards his son. Tommy had been knocked out by the fall and couldn't breathe because of the horse's weight, but by the time his father was close he was starting to wake up. As soon as Adam saw Tommy move, he turned quickly around and hurried off toward the horse: he didn't want to show Tommy how worried he was. Tommy wouldn't respect him for it, he thought.\n\nThe horse stood by the broken fence, only a little aware of the dull pain in the front leg that couldn't hold his weight. Adam and the animal doctor came to him at the same time, and Adam looked angry.\n\n\"You said he was ready to run. The owner is going to be very upset when he hears about it.\" Adam tried to control his growing anger at the unfairness of it all. The horse wasn't just any horse\u2014it was the best he'd ever trained, had made him win more races than he was ever likely to win again.\n\n\"Well, he looked okay,\" said the animal doctor defensively.\n\n\"I want a test done,\" Adam said strongly.\n\n\"He's broken his shoulder. He'll have to be put down.\"\n\n\"I know. I can see. But I want a test first. Just being sick wouldn't have made him act like that.\"\n\nThe animal doctor agreed to take a blood test, and then he put the horse to sleep. The best horse in Adam's stable became only a name in the record books. The eaten carrot was taken away with the horse but its harm was far from over.\n\nIt took Cameron fifteen minutes to realize that it was Tommy who was alive and the horse that was dead, during which time he felt sick and very confused. It had seemed so small a thing, in the beginning, to give a carrot to the horse. He didn't think it would make him feel bad. He never dreamed something like that could make you really sick.\n\nWhen he found out that Toddy didn't break any bones, was awake now and would be up and walking in a little while, he started to feel better. When the small helper came to remind him that he needed to get ready to ride in the big race, he felt good enough to do it, even though he kind of wished he didn't have to.\n\nIn the changing room, he forgot to tell his helper he needed a light saddle and a special belt. He forgot to tie the cloth around his neck and would have gone out to ride with it flapping around. He forgot to take his watch off. His helper noticed everything and thought he looked silly.\n\nThe horse he was going to ride wasn't very good. It was young and not trained well. He didn't care. He was too busy to look at the book that told him about the horse's past races. He just got on the horse without thinking and didn't listen to the helper who was trying to give him instructions. He thought he knew better. Just do it, he thought. How could he listen to all these details when he had so much on his mind?\n\nAs he was leaving the room, he passed Adam, who looked at his racing clothes and said, \"Well, don't mess it up too much...\"\n\nAdam was still thinking about how the death of a horse was going to change things and he didn't notice that the comment made him feel annoyed.\n\nHe's always like that, he thought. He never thinks I can do anything right. If he'd given me more chances... and more money... I wouldn't have... Well, I wouldn't have. He rode down to the starting post, thinking about that comment, \"Don't mess it up,\" because it made him feel like he had a good reason for doing what he'd done. He didn't want to feel bad about it. He told himself anything to avoid feeling that way.\n\nHenry noticed that Charlie had a surprise horse in the young race and thought he was safe, the boy wasn't going to mess up. Still, he packed up his stuff and left his spot for the day and went home, telling his friends he didn't feel good. And he really didn't. He couldn't forget the sight of the brown horse jumping at the barriers like it couldn't see. The horse had been blind. A great racer who knew he was in a race. Didn't understand there was something wrong with him. Ran because he was asked to run, because he knew it was the right place for it. A great horse, with a great racing heart.\n\nHenry wiped the sweat off his forehead. They must have checked the horse for bad stuff, he thought, after something like that. None of the others he'd done before had acted that way. Maybe he'd given the wrong amount or the wrong time. You never knew how individual horses would react. Giving bad stuff was always a little unpredictable.\n\nHe poured himself some juice with hands that were still shaking, and when he felt calmer he decided that if he was not caught this time he would be happy with what he'd done, and he wouldn't mess with any more food. He just wouldn't risk it again.\n\nCharlie stood at the starting spot in the middle of the field, even though the teacher had told him to start on the outside to give the new horse an easy start over the first few jumps. Charlie didn't remember this because he hadn't listened, and even if he had listened he would have done the same, always wanting to disagree. He was thinking about Todd standing on this spot an hour ago, not knowing that his horse wouldn't see the jumps. Charlie didn't know bad stuff could make a horse blind. How could anyone think that? It didn't make sense. Maybe the bad stuff had made the brown horse so confused that even though its eyes saw the barrier, it didn't understand that he was supposed to jump over it. The brown horse couldn't have been really blind.\n\nCharlie was scared at the thought and forgot to check that the straps were still tight after warming up to the post. His mind was still on the scary thought when the race started, so he was surprised and slow to start. The small teacher on the stand made a noise of annoyance, and Adam raised his eyes to the sky.\n\nThe first jump was next to the first barrier, and all the way to it Charlie was scared that his horse wouldn't jump it. He spent the attention he should have given to setting his horse right in trying to convince himself that no one could have given it bad food. He couldn't be riding a horse that wasn't feeling well ... it wouldn't be fair. Why wouldn't it be fair? Because ... because ....\n\nThe jumping horse tried to go over the big stick, hit himself hard on the wooden frame, and landed almost standing still. The small horse teacher started to say bad words.\n\nCharlie fixed one loose rope and then the other, and the jumping horse went side to side, unsure what to do. He needed to be ridden with care and to be taught how to move and how to keep his beat. He needed to be put right before the jumps and to be quickly put together afterwards. He didn't have experience, he didn't know how to decide and he needed a rider who could help with both.\n\nCharlie could have done an okay job if he'd been trying. But, with feeling sick and feeling very tired taking away what skill he had, he was busy showing that he'd never be very good.\n\nAt the second jump he saw in his head the brown horse flipping through the air, and turning the corner his eyes moved to the broken fence and the messed-up grass in front of it. The brown horse had died there. Everyone in the stable would be sadder for it. He had killed the brown horse, he couldn't avoid it any more, he'd killed it with that carrot as surely as if he'd done it himself. Charlie cried suddenly, and his eyes filled with tears.\n\nHe didn't see the next two jumps. They went under him very fast. He stayed on his horse without thinking, and the tears ran down and were swept away as they trickled under the edge of his riding glasses.\n\nThe green jumping horse was scared and didn't know what to do. Another jump was right in front, and the horses in front went through it fast, knocking one part half over and leaving it there slanted. The jumping horse waited until the last minute for help or instructions from the man on his back and then in a confused way dived for the leaning part, which looked lower to him and easier to jump than the other end.\n\nFrom the stands, both the small horse teacher and Adam could see that Charlie had not tried to keep straight or to tell the horse when to jump. It landed with its front feet tangled up in the sloping jump and threw Charlie over its head.\n\nThe thing that should have made Charlie curl into a ball to protect himself wasn't working. He fell through the air flat and straight, and his last thought before he hit was that the silly little horse teacher hadn't taught his horse properly. The animal didn't know how to jump.\n\nHe woke up much later in a tall bed in a small room. There was a little light somewhere. He could not feel any hurt. He could not feel anything at all. His thoughts seemed to be floating in his head and his head was floating in the air.\n\nAfter a while, he started to think that he was not alive anymore. He was calm about this thought and was proud of himself for being calm. After a longer time, he started to understand that he was not dead. There was something around his head, making it comfortable. He couldn't move.\n\nHe opened and closed his eyes on purpose and wet his lips to make sure that they were working. He couldn't remember what had happened. His thoughts were mixed up but peaceful.\n\nFinally, he remembered a carrot, and all the hard feelings came back. He shouted and tried to move, to get up and go, to run away from the impossible, very bad feeling. People heard him and came into the room and stood around him. He looked at them without understanding. They were wearing white clothes.\n\n\"You're okay, now,\" they said. \"Don't worry, young man, you're going to be okay.\"\n\n\"I can't move,\" he said.\n\n\"You will,\" they said in a calming way.\n\n\"I can't feel ... anything. I can't feel my feet.\" He became scared suddenly. \"I can't feel my hands. I can't ... move ... my hands.\" He was shouting, scared, his eyes big and open.\n\n\"Don't worry,\" they said. \"You will in time. You're going to be okay. You're going to be okay.\"\n\nHe didn't believe them, and they gave him something to make him calm. He couldn't feel the small poke. He heard himself screaming because he could feel no hurt.\n\nWhen he woke up again he knew for sure that his neck was hurt badly.\n\nAfter four days, Adam came to see him, bringing six new eggs and a bottle of fresh juice. He stood looking at the body that couldn't move with the big bandage around its shoulders and head.\n\n\"Well, Charlie,\" he said in a difficult way. \"It's not as bad as it could have been, right?\"\n\nCharlie said in a not nice way, \"I'm glad you think so.\"\n\n\"They say your back isn't cut, it's just squashed. They say in a year or so you'll be able to move a lot. And they say you'll start to feel things any day now.\"\n\n\"They say,\" said Charlie in a mean way. \"I don't believe them.\"\n\n\"You'll have to, in time,\" said Adam in a frustrated way.\n\nCharlie didn't answer, and Adam tried to think of something to say to make the time pass until he could leave in a good way. He couldn't go see the boy and just be quiet. He had to say _something._ So he started to talk about what he was thinking about the most.\n\n\"We got the result of the test this morning. Did you know we had the brown horse tested? Well, you know we had to let it go anyway. The results came this morning. They were not good _.. Not good._ The brown horse had some bad stuff in it, some long name. The owner is really upset about it and so is the company that helps when things go wrong. They're trying to say it's my fault. That I didn't keep things safe enough. It's silly. And all this after losing the horse itself, losing that really great horse. I asked everyone in the stable this morning as soon as I knew about the bad stuff, but of course no one knew anything. Gosh, if I knew who did it I'd be really mad.\" His voice was shaky because he was so upset.\n\nHe thought then that Chick being Chick, he would only be worried about himself and wouldn't care about anyone else's problems. Adam sighed deeply. Chick did have his own problems now, that was true. He couldn't be expected to care that much about the brown horse. And he was looking very weak, very pale.\n\nThe doctor who checked on Chick's condition lots of times a day came quietly into the small room and shook hands with Adam.\n\n\"He's doing well,\" he said. \"Getting better nicely.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" Chick said.\n\nThe doctor made a face. He didn't say that Chick was the hardest patient in the hospital. He said, \"Of course, it's hard for him. But it could have been worse. It'll take time, he'll need to learn everything again, you see. It'll take time.\"\n\n\"Like a little baby,\" Chick said loudly.\n\nAdam thought, a baby again. Well, maybe this time they could do better with him.\n\n\"He's lucky he's got good parents to take care of him once he goes home,\" the doctor said.\n\nChick thought of his mother, always cutting up carrots to put in the soup. He'd have to eat them. His throat felt tight. He knew he couldn't.\n\nAnd then there was the money, hidden in the shoe-cleaning tin on the shelf in his bedroom. He would be able to see the tin all the time when he was in his own bed. He would never be able to forget. Never. And there was always the chance his mom would look inside it. He didn't want to go home. He didn't want to deal with it, but he knew he had to. He didn't have any other option. He wished he wasn't there.\n\nAdam sighed heavily and took on his new problem with the strong mind he always had. \"Yes, he can come home to his mom and me as soon as he's well enough. He'll always have us.\"\n\nKevin felt very sad and closed his eyes. His dad tried to not get annoyed, and the doctor thought the boy was not being nice.\nTHE STORY\n\n_\"The Story\" is the one told in_ a Sports Magazine _'s big race issue of a long time ago. The magazine renamed the story \"The Big Day of Flowers and Drinks,\" talking about the real blanket of flowers put on the winning horse, and the pretend drinks in the story._\n\n_\"The Story\" given to Frank, though, was worth a lot more than flowers._\n\nWhen the morning plane from NE city was still a bit away from LO city, Frank took out some papers and began to write down what he spent.\n\n_Taxi to airport, $40.00._\n\nEven though a neighbor, who worked far away, had given him a free ride: a little creativity in the money department made him earn a bit more (not taxed) than the _Big City Star_ paid him for the true things he wrote about every week in his Monday racing column.\n\n_Food on trip,_ he wrote. _$25.00._\n\n_Money spent for getting information, $30.50._\n\nTo make that money seem right he ordered another big drink from the plane helper and raised it quietly to wish good luck to a man sleeping across the way, the owner of a not-so-good horse that had hurt her legs two weeks ago.\n\nAnother big race. His mind jumped around like a scratched old movie about the days to come. The same old trip to the stables in the mornings, the same endless looking at old races, trying to guess the future. The same unsure practices on the track, the same bad talk, same chat, same not-funny jokes, same not-smart trainers, talking too much.\n\nThe bright excitement that had made his writing famous was gone. The happiness for the big day, the talent for finding a story where no one else did, the sharp sense which knew what was true, he had all these. All had left him. Now there was only boredom and always being tired. Instead of new stories he now gave his paper old ideas of other race writers, and a couple of times recently he had not even done that.\n\nHe was forty-six.\n\nHe had a drink.\n\nIn his busy NE city office, the sports editor of the big newspaper looked at Frank's story from last week about the big race and wondered if he should have sent him to this week's race.\n\nThat man, he thought sadly, was not doing well. It was too bad. Too bad he couldn't stop drinking. No one could drink and write at the same time. Write first, drink after; sure. Drink a lot, maybe. But after.\n\nHe thought that he would have to let Frank go soon, that he should have started looking for someone else when Frank first came to the office too confused to type right. But that man had everything, he thought. A great sense for a story, and a gift for making it so exciting that the words jumped right off the page and kicked you in the head.\n\nNow, all that was left was a name and a memory: the style was still there, but the person behind it was fading.\n\nThe sports editor shook his head over the race story and put it aside. Twice in the past weeks, Frank had not been able to write a story at all. Each time, they had made up a story in the office and put Frank's name on it, but two missed times were one too many. Three, and it would be over. The bosses were complaining more than ever about the high costs, and if they found out that in return they had twice received only silence, no amount of good memories would save him.\n\nI did warn him, thought the sports editor worriedly. I told him to make sure to do a good one this time. A great story, like he used to. I told him to make this race one of his best.\n\nFrank checked into the room that the newspaper had saved for him and had three quick drinks from the bottle he had brought in his bag. He pushed the sports editor's warning to the back of his mind because he was still sure that drunk or not, he could write better than any other writer, if there was a good story. There just weren't any good stories anymore.\n\nHe took a taxi to the big racetrack. (Taxi cost, he wrote on the way, and paid the driver less.)\n\nWith three days to go to the big race, the racetrack looked clean, new, and ready. Bright red flowers stood tall under the blue sky, and patches of green grass looked fresh and clean. Fred walked up to the big room at the top of the building without noticing them. Inside, some men were busy working on their small computers, some were watching the race outside, and most were talking.\n\nFred got himself a drink and went to his spot, saying hello to the people he knew. He lived in different hotels, moving from place to place since his wife Sylvie got tired of him not being home and drinking too much and took the kids to her mom's house in NE state. He saw the press rooms as his real home. He felt comfortable there, and knew people respected him. He didn't know that the respect he once had was slowly turning into pity.\n\nHe sat comfortably in his chair reading some of the day's news.\n\n\"Trainer Henry reports no problem with the horse's leg after running on the track this morning.\"\n\n\"There is no truth in the rumor that the horse was sick last night, says vet Jack on behalf of the owner Mrs. L (Lily).\"\n\nHe thought to himself, news about nothing happening is not really news.\n\nHe stayed in the press room all day, drinking his drink, talking about this and that with writers, picture takers, people who share news and radio people, watching the race on the small TV, and sometimes going outside to look at the crowd far below. He didn't need to go down there like he used to, he thought. He didn't need to try to talk to people in private. Everything and everyone he needed to know about came to the press room.\n\nAt the end of the day, he took a ride back to the city in a friend's car and in the evening, after having a drink in his room, he went to the yearly dinner of the writers' group. The people in the big room were happy to see him, and he moved among the pressmen, trainers, riders, breeders, owners and their wives and girlfriends like a fish in his own pond. Before dinner, he had four drinks, and during dinner and the long speeches after, he kept drinking. At half past eleven, when he tried to leave the table, he couldn't control his legs.\n\nHe was surprised. He didn't know he was dizzy until he tried to stand up. His mouth was still working fine and his thoughts seemed clear. But when he tried to stand, his legs didn't work and he sat back down. Later, when the big room was almost empty because everyone was going home, he was able to stand up.\n\n\"I guess I drank too much,\" he said quietly, smiling a little.\n\nHe held onto the backs of chairs and leaned on the wall to get to the door. He stumbled through the door and into the hallway, then into the front room, and then outside into the night.\n\nThe cool evening made him feel worse. It felt like the ground was moving under his feet. He stumbled and walked into a brick wall. The wall hurt him and made him more confused. He put his hands on the rough wall and rested his face on it, but he didn't know where he was.\n\nMatthew and Patrick didn't see Frank leave before them. They walked together, talking like people who just met at the end of a party. They didn't look like they had been looking at each other all night and thinking about what they would talk about.\n\nIn a place where betting on races was okay, Matthew might have been a good citizen. But his only skill led him to a life of quick thinking and quick moves. He made bets with young people who later became important, and they didn't bother him when they got powerful. The one thing Matthew was really good at was picking the young person who would become important.\n\nThe two men went through the glass doors and stopped outside where the light from inside shone on them. Matthew didn't like to talk in corners because it looked too suspicious.\n\n\"Did you get the boys to agree?\" he asked, standing with his hands in his pockets and his belly sticking out over his belt.\n\nPatrick slowly lit a cigarette, looked at the sky with stars, and took a deep breath of smoke.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he said.\n\n\"So who's picked?\"\n\n\"Adam.\"\n\n\"No,\" Matthew disagreed. \"He's not good enough.\"\n\nPatrick took a deep breath. He was hungry. He needed to be lighter for tomorrow, but had only a small piece of meat in his stomach. He didn't like people who ate too much, especially rich people who ate too much. He was saving up his own money in houses and good savings, but at his age, he was finding it hard to keep going. He was thinking about how to make a lot of money quickly. \n\nHe said, \"He's honest. It has to be him.\"\n\nMatthew thought about it, not liking it, but finally agreed.\n\n\"All right, then. Adam.\"\n\nPatrick agreed, and got ready to leave. It wasn't good for a horse rider to be seen with Matthew for too long, especially if he wanted to keep working for a good farm, which he definitely did.\n\nMatthew asked, \"Did you think about a trick with the horse?\"\n\nPatrick hesitated.\n\n\"It'll cost you,\" he said.\n\n\"Sure,\" Matthew agreed easily. \"How about a lot more money?\"\n\n\"Used money. Half before.\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\nPatrick decided to do it, throwing away his last bit of honesty.\n\n\"OK,\" he said, and walked away to his car, feeling very tense.\n\nFrank had heard everything, and he knew, without looking, that one of the voices was Matthew's. Anyone who knew about horse racing would know that voice. He knew that Matthew was planning a cheat, and also that a good cheat would make his writing interesting. He thought vaguely that he needed to know who Matthew had been talking to, and that he should turn around to see.\n\nBut he was a bit dizzy, and when he tried to look in the right direction, both men had gone.\n\n\"Mean people,\" he said to the quiet night, and another person leaving the hotel helped him to a car. He made it back to his room before he fell asleep.\n\nSince he left the airport that morning, he had drunk six small beers, four small drinks, one big drink (by mistake) and nearly three bottles of strong drink.\n\nHe woke up late the next day, and couldn't believe it. He looked at the small clock next to his bed.\n\nLate morning.\n\nHe had missed the big buildings and the whole morning fun in the field. He felt cold when he first realized this, but there was more bad news. When he tried to sit up, everything spun and his head hurt a lot. When he pulled back the blanket, he found he had been sleeping with all his clothes and shoes on. He couldn't remember how he got back the night before.\n\nHe slowly walked to the bathroom. His face in the mirror looked scary, wrinkled and red-eyed, looking much older. He had felt bad many times before, but this was worse. He felt like something very bad had happened, but it wasn't until he had taken off his coat, shirt, pants, and shoes, and laid down on the messy bed, that he understood what it was.\n\nThen he realized with a shock that he couldn't remember not only how he got back to his room, but almost nothing about the whole night. Bits of talking from the first hour came back to him, and he remembered sitting at a table between a grumpy old writer from BS place and a serious woman from LE city, both of whom he didn't like; but he couldn't remember anything after the chicken.\n\nHe had heard of times when people drink too much and can't remember anything, but he didn't think that could happen to him; and he, Frank, was not like that. Of course, he would admit that he did drink a bit. Well, a lot. But he could stop whenever he wanted. Of course he could.\n\nHe lay on the bed and felt hot, thinking that one time of not remembering might lead to another, until he started seeing things. The warning from the sports boss came back to him, and for the first time, he started to worry a bit about his job because he had missed his writing twice. Within five minutes, he had convinced himself that they would never fire him, but just to be safe, he decided to stop drinking until after he had written his article about the big race. This decision made him feel good about himself, which helped him get through a very bad day.\n\nAt the race track, three other men were also worried. Patrick kicked his horse into the starting area and worried about what Gabriel, the big farm's trainer, had said when he found out he was a bit too heavy. Gabriel always acted like he was better than all the riders and talked to them rudely, whether they won or lost.\n\n\"Don't tell me that,\" he said to Benjamin's reasons. \"You went to the big dinner last night, what do you think?\"\n\nBenjamin looked sadly back over his evening with its single juice and said he'd had a hard time that morning.\n\nHenry looked upset. \"You stay away from the food tonight and tomorrow if you want to ride CC in the big race.\"\n\nBenjamin really needed to ride CC in the big race. He nodded quietly to Henry with sad eyes, and climbed onto the horse.\n\nInstead of helping him, the worry of not riding CC made him not focus, so he started the race slowly, ran the first part too fast to reach third place, went too far on the turn and lost his speed. He finished sixth. He was a very good rider. It was not his day.\n\nOn the big stand, Matthew put down his looking glasses, shaking his head and making a noise. If Benjamin couldn't do better than that when he was trying to win, what would he do on CC?\n\nMatthew thought about the very many things he was risking on Saturday's little event. He had not yet decided whether to tell some guys, in which case they would cover the risk at no risk to him, or to take the bigger profit of doing it alone. He sat down and worried about how a fixed race could change.\n\nSamuel worried about his job, which was not doing well.\n\nSamuel picked pockets for a living, and was tired of credit cards. In the old days, when he'd learned the skill from his grandpa, men carried their wallets in their back pants pockets, easy for everyone to see. Nowadays all these bad guys had ruined the market: few people carried more than a few dollars with them, and those that did hid it.\n\nFifty-three years Samuel had lived: forty-five of them by stealing. Some short times in jail had been bad luck, but not a reason to stop stealing the first wallet he saw when he got out. He had tried to be good once, but he hadn't liked it: couldn't face the regular hours and the awful feeling of working. After six weeks he had left his good job and gone back thankfully to uncertainty. He was happier taking ten dollars than getting fifty.\n\nTo get the most at the races, you either had to spot the big money before it was gone, or follow someone who won a lot away from the window. Either way, it meant staying near the betting place and watching. The problem was, too many guards at the race had figured out what he was doing, and would watch people who were just standing there watching.\n\nBenjamin had a bad week. The biggest wallet he thought had lots of money, had little money but a lot of bad pictures after he followed it for half an hour. Benjamin, not liking those kinds of things, was not happy about this.\n\nFor his first two days of work, he only had fifty-three dollars, and five of these he found on some stairs. His small room in LO city was costing him forty a night, and with travel and food to think about, he thought he'd need eight hundred to make the trip worth it.\n\nAlways hopeful, he was happy thinking about the big race day. It would definitely be easier to find things when more people came.\n\nFrank's own rule of not drinking lasted all through Friday. Feeling better when he woke up, he took a taxi to CH place at early morning, writing down what he spent on the way. He wrote down many things he didn't really buy the day before, thinking it was better for the people at work not to know he was very sick on Wednesday night. He added more to the total: after all, drinks were costly, and he would be drinking again by Sunday.\n\nHe was not as shocked about not remembering, because during his day in bed he remembered little things that he was sure happened after the chicken. He still didn't remember how he got from dinner to bed, but he was not as scared about it. Sometimes he thought there was something important about it he should remember, but he made himself believe that if it was really important, he wouldn't have forgotten.\n\nNear the big barns the groups of news people were already around the trainers of the most expected race runners. Frank walked over to the edge of HE place, and the other people made room for him without talking about him not being there the day before. This made him feel better: whatever he did on Wednesday night, it couldn't have been bad.\n\nThe notepads were out. HE person, used to this and liking the attention, waited after every sentence to give time for all to be written down.\n\n\"PM horse ate well last night and is calm and cool this morning. In the book we should watch SB horse, unless the track is wet by Saturday.\"\n\nEveryone was smiling. The sky was blue, the weather was good.\n\nFrank listened without caring. He'd heard it all before. Everyone had heard it all before. And who cared?\n\nIn a different group two barns away, the trainer of Big Salad was saying his horse was better than Pinchy on the HE form, and could run on any ground, wet or not.\n\nGabriel got fewer news people, as he didn't have much to say about Crispy. The three-year-old had been beaten by both Pinchy and Big Salad on different days, and was not expected to win.\n\nOn Friday afternoon Frank spent his time up in the news room and said no to some free drinks. He was busy with different owners at the track.\n\nPatrick tried very hard in the sixth race, lost by a little bit and felt very weak from being hungry in the jockey's room afterwards. Gabriel, not knowing this, only noted that Patrick had made the weight, and said that he would ride Crispy tomorrow.\n\nSome friends of Patrick, helping him to a bed, asked him quietly if tomorrow's plan was still on. Patrick nodded. \"Yes,\" he said quietly. \"All the way.\"\n\nMatthew was happy to see Patrick riding better, but decided anyway to share his bet with the group.\n\nBilly took two wallets, with fourteen and twenty-two dollars in them. He lost ten of them betting on a sure thing in the last race.\n\nPinchy, Big Salad and Crispy, watched by men in uniforms with guns at their sides, looked over the stable doors and with small shakes in their muscles watched other horses go out to the track. All three would have liked to go too. All three knew well enough what the trumpet was sounding for, on the other side.\n\nSaturday morning, nice and clear.\n\nCrowds in the thousands came to CH Downs. Excited, waiting, talking, dressed in bright colors and buying sweet drinks in take-away souvenir glasses, they came through the gates and over the field, reading the latest sports news on Pinchy versus Big Salad, and dreaming of picking outsiders that won at big odds.\n\nBilly had just enough to pay his motel bill, but he wanted to have better luck with the lifts. His small lined face with its busy eyes looked almost desperate, and the long fingers moved and stopped moving in his pockets.\n\nPatrick, with a weight to make on Crispy, had an egg for breakfast and decided what to buy with the money which had been given to him the night before, and with the extra money (both legal and not legal) he should get that day. If he tidied up safely that afternoon, he thought, he could do the same thing again, even after he stopped riding. He hardly noticed his mind changing from not wanting to be dishonest to often being dishonest.\n\nMatthew spent the morning calling different friends, offering them something good. They said yes. Matthew felt happier and walked with a spring in his step to a place a few blocks away, where a careful man counted out a lot of money in notes that couldn't be traced. Matthew gave him a paper saying he got the money, signed properly. Business was business.\n\nFrank wanted a drink. Just one, he thought, would not hurt. It would make him feel better, make him sharp. One little drink in the morning would not stop him from writing a good story that night. The big newspaper wouldn't mind just one drink before he went to see the horse races, especially as he had stayed away from the bar the night before by going to bed early. Not drinking had taken a lot of willpower: it would be right to reward such good behavior with just one drink.\n\nHowever, he had finished the bottle he had with him on Wednesday night. He checked his wallet to see how much he had: eighty-three dollars, plenty to buy a new bottle for later and a quick one in the bar before he left.\n\nHe went downstairs. But in the lobby, his friend Cameron again offered a free ride in his car to the race track, so he decided he could wait for his one drink for half an hour. He gave himself little mental pats on the back all the way to the racetrack.\n\nBenjamin, moving among the groups of people at the back of the grandstand, saw Matthew walking by in the sunshine, leaning backwards because of the weight in front and breathing heavily in the growing heat.\n\nBenjamin licked his lips. He knew the big man by sight: knew that somewhere around that big body might be enough money to last him through the summer. Matthew would never come to the horse race with empty pockets.\n\nTwo thoughts made Benjamin wait as he slid like a fish in Matthew's wake. The first was that Matthew was too clever to let himself be robbed. The second, that he was known to have powerful friends, and if Matthew was carrying their money Benjamin wasn't going to risk stealing it, which was how he got his nickname in the first place.\n\nSadly Benjamin left the quarry, and went back to the crowd in the comforting shadows under the grandstand.\n\nAround lunchtime, he sneaked into a crowd of people waiting for an elevator.\n\nA minute later, he took Frank's wallet.\n\nMatthew kept his money in smart pockets under his arms, holding them tight in a crowd, scared of thieves. When the time was right, he would go to as many different windows as he could, quietly giving out the money. He would give Patrick almost half of the tickets (and the second bunch of old notes), and keep the other half for himself.\n\nA good little plan, he thought happily. And no reason why he shouldn't do it again.\n\nHe bought a sweet drink and smiled nicely at a girl showing more chest than shyness.\n\nThe sun warmed up the day. The smaller contests happened one after another with waves of cheering, each one just a smaller part of the big one, the big race, the end, the ninth race, the one they called the Roses, because of the blanket of red flowers that would be put on the winner.\n\nIn the riders' room, Patrick changed into the clothes for a horse named CC and started to sweat. The closer he got to the race the more he wished it was a normal race day. He calmed his nerves by reading a newspaper.\n\nFrank found out his wallet was gone upstairs in the news room when he tried to pay for a drink. He said bad words, searched all his pockets, made a mess in the news room, got the keys to the car from Cameron and went all the way back to the parking lot. After looking and not finding anything there he walked angrily back to the big seats, thinking bad things about the very bad person who had taken his money. He thought it must have been an old hand; maybe even an old man. The new mean young ones used force, not skill.\n\nHis problems were not too big. He didn't need much money. Cameron was going to give him a ride, the hotel bill was going straight to the newspaper and his plane ticket was safe in his room. He could borrow some money, maybe, from Cameron or others in the news room, to cover important things.\n\nGoing up in the elevator he thought that losing his money was like a sign from the sky: no money, no drink.\n\nBenjamin made sure Frank didn't drink all afternoon.\n\nThree horses, PM, SB and CC, were led from their houses, into the tunnel under the cars and people, and out again onto the track in front of the big seats. They walked relaxed, used to being seen but knowing from experience that this was just the beginning. The first sight of the day's big horse race got the people in the crowd moving towards the window like colorful fish.\n\nPatrick walked out with the other riders towards the fence where the horses, trainers and owners were grouped in each stall. He started to feel like he wasn't really there: he couldn't believe that he, a good rider, was about to mess up the big horse race.\n\nGabriel repeated the plan they had agreed on for about the fortieth time. Patrick nodded seriously, as if he was really going to do it. He didn't really hear what Gabriel was saying; and he didn't hear the music and the singing when the race horses were led out to the track. The song \"My Old KE Home\" made a lot of people feel emotional and start to cry, but Patrick didn't even blink.\n\nDuring the parade, the warm-up, the circling round, and even when they got into the starting gates, Patrick still felt like he wasn't really there. Only then, when he saw how nervous the other riders were, did he start to feel real again. His heart started beating really fast and he felt like he had a lot of energy.\n\nNow, he thought. It is now, in the next half minute, that I earn myself a lot of extra money; and after that, the rest.\n\nHe pulled down his goggles and held onto his reins and his whip. He had PM horse on his right and SB horse on his left, and when the gates opened he went out between them really fast, leaning forward and standing up in the stirrups with his head almost as far forward as CC's.\n\nAll along past the stands the first time he tried to stay in the middle of the group, as hidden as possible, and around the top bend he was still there, sitting quietly and not doing much. But down the back stretch, about tenth in a group of twenty-six, he earned his money.\n\nNo one except Patrick ever knew what really happened; only he knew that he'd pulled the left rein with a quick twist of his wrist and pushed CC's side with his right foot. The fast-running horse did what he wanted, turned sharply left and bumped into the horse beside him.\n\nThe horse beside him was still SB. When he got bumped, SB bumped into the horse on his own left, rocked back, stumbled, lost his balance and fell. The two horses behind him fell over him.\n\nPatrick didn't look back. The sudden turn and bump had made him lose some places, which CC would have been unable to get back. He rode the rest of the race just like he was supposed to, finishing as fast as he could in twelfth place.\n\nOut of the many people watching the race at the big race place, only a few could see the crash on the far side of the track. The buildings in the middle and the big crowds had hidden the crash from nearly everyone on the ground and most in the stands. Only the news people, high up, had seen. They sent out people to find out what happened and were busy like bees.\n\nFrank, out on the balcony, watched the photographers running to take pictures of the winner, Patrick, and was sad that no one would have taken close-up pictures of the second favorite, Salad Bowl, fallen on the dirt. He watched the dark red flowers being put on the winner and the big show of the trophies, and then went inside to watch the race again on TV. They showed the Salad Bowl incident forwards, backwards and sideways, and then showed it slowly in a series of still pictures.\n\n\"See that,\" said Cameron, pointing at the TV over Frank's shoulder. \"It was Crinkle Cut caused it. You can see him bump into Salad Bowl ... there! ... Crinkle Cut, that's the tricky one.\"\n\nFrank walked over to his spot, sat down, and looked at his typing machine. Crinkle Cut. He knew something about Crinkle Cut. He thought hard for five minutes, but he couldn't remember what he knew.\n\nInformation and words came up to the news room. All fallen riders shaken but not hurt, all horses the same; Leaders in a panic, checking everything and watching the camera film over and over. No trouble for Piper Boles thought likely, as people usually ignore rough riding in the big race. Piper Boles had said, \"Crinkle Cut just suddenly moved. I didn't expect it, and couldn't stop him bumping Salad Bowl.\" Lots of people believed him.\n\nFrank thought he might as well write a few words: it would bring the first drink nearer, and boy how he needed that drink. With an ear open for new information he typed out a detailed account of an incident he had hardly seen. When he began to read it through, he saw that the first words he had written were \"The tricky move on Crinkle Cut stole the after-race scene ...\"\n\n_Tricky move_ on Crinkle Cut? He hadn't meant to write that ... or not exactly. He looked worried. And there were other words in his mind, just as silly. He put his hands back on the toy keyboard and pretended to type.\n\n\"It'll cost you ... a lot of pretend money ... half before.\"\n\nHe looked at what he had pretended to write. He had made it up, he must have. Or dreamed it. One or the other.\n\nA dream. That was it. He remembered. He had had a dream about two boys planning a race, and one of them had been Matthew, talking about a game on Candy Land.\n\nFrank relaxed and smiled at the thought, and the next minute knew quite suddenly that it hadn't been a dream at all. He had heard Matthew and Peter planning a game on Candy Land, and he had forgotten because he'd been sleepy. Well, he told himself, no harm done, he had remembered now, hadn't he?\n\nNo, he hadn't. If Candy Land was a game, what was he a game _from?_ Perhaps if he waited a bit, he would find he knew that too.\n\nBenjamin spent Frank's pretend money on two pretend hot dogs, one pretend drink and five pretend bets. On the winning side, he had collected three more pretend wallets and a pretend purse: total pretend money, a hundred and ninety-four. Sadly he decided to call it a day and not come back next year.\n\nMatthew moved from window to window of the pretend betting station and the pretend judges asked to see the boys involved in the Salad Bowl game.\n\nThe kids, hot, tired and a bit grouchy, began to leave in the yellowing sunshine. The bands marched away. The stalls which sold pretend souvenirs packed up their wares. Pretend Horse had his picture taken for the thousandth time and the runners for the tenth, last and least interesting race of the day, walked over from the barns.\n\nPeter was waiting outside the pretend judges' room for a summons inside, but Matthew used the best pretend messengers, and the package he entrusted was safely delivered. Peter, nodded, slipped it into his pocket, and gave the pretend judges a performance worthy of a movie star.\n\nFrank put his head in his hands, trying to remember. A drink, he thought, might help. Game. Candy Land. Amberezzio.\n\nHe sat up sharply. _Amberezzio._ And what the heck did that mean? _It has to be Amberezzio._\n\n\"Charlie,\" he said, leaning back over his chair. \"Do you know of a pretend horse called Amberezzio?\"\n\nCharlie shook his bald head. \"I've never heard of it,\" said Frank.\n\nFrank called to some people, \"Do you know a horse named Amberezzio?\" Finally, he got an answer. \"Amberezzio isn't a horse, he's a helper.\"\n\n\"It has to be Amberezzio. He's good.\"\n\nFrank stood up so fast he knocked over his chair. They had already said it was almost time for the last race.\n\n\"Can you give me a hundred dollars, friend?\" he asked Cameron.\n\nCameron, knowing Frank had lost his wallet, agreed and started to take out his money.\n\n\"Quick, please,\" Frank said urgently.\n\n\"OK, OK.\" Cameron gave him the hundred dollars and went back to his work.\n\nFrank grabbed his paper and moved through the noisy crowd to the window where you bet on horses. He looked at the pages ... Tenth race, Homeward Bound, eight horses ... He found what he was looking for.\n\nPatrick Amberezzio, riding a horse Frank had never heard of.\n\n\"I want to bet a hundred on number six,\" he said quickly, and got his ticket just before the window closed. A little shaky, he went back through the crowd, and out to the balcony. He was the only newsman watching the race.\n\nThey did a great job, he thought. You wouldn't have known if you hadn't known. They kept him in the middle and then at the perfect moment let him go. Amberezzio won by a little bit, with all the others trying as hard as they could.\n\nFrank laughed. That little guy probably thought he was really great, winning with all the big guys trying to catch him.\n\nHe went back inside and everyone was looking at Henry, who had the owner and rider of another horse with him. Frank wrote down some things to talk about, but he was thinking about the other story, the big one.\n\nHe would need to be careful, he thought. He would need to do his best, and be careful not to say anything bad while making it clear that someone needed to look into it. He was a little excited. He would write his story in his quiet room. He couldn't do it here at the race place, with everyone watching.\n\nIn the room where the riders changed, Patrick quietly gave out the tickets that Matthew had brought: each of the seven riders in the tenth race who didn't win got tickets worth a lot of money, and Patrick got even more for himself. Each rider asked a wife or girlfriend to get the money they won and some of them could have been easy targets for Ben, if he had not already left.\n\nMatthew's money had made the odds on the horse better, but the horse still won at twelve to one. Matthew moved from window to window, getting his winnings bit by bit. He didn't have room for all the money in his pockets and finally put some in places that were easier to reach. Too bad about Ben.\n\nFrank collected a handful of winnings and gave back the money he borrowed from Cameron.\n\n\"If you knew the horse would win, you could have told me,\" complained Cameron, thinking of all the costs old Frank would surely say he had because of his free rides to the horse race.\n\n\"It wasn't a tip, just a guess.\" He couldn't tell Cameron what the guess was, because he worked for a different paper. \"I'll buy you a drink on the way home.\"\n\n\"I should hope so.\"\n\nFrank immediately wished he hadn't offered, which he did without thinking. He remembered that he had planned not to drink until after he had written. But, maybe one ... And he really needed a drink. It felt like a long time since his last one, on Wednesday night.\n\nThey left together, walking out with the last of the crowd. The racetrack looked tired and messy at the end of the day: the red petals of the flowers lay on the ground, the green grass was dusty gray and covered with trash. Frank only thought of the money in his pocket and the story in his head, and both of them made him feel happy.\n\nA drink to celebrate, he thought. Buy Cameron a thank-you drink, and maybe just one more to celebrate. It wasn't often, after all, that things went his way so wonderfully.\n\nThey stopped for the drink. The first one made Fred feel warm all over. The second made him feel great.\n\n\"Time to go,\" he said to Cameron. \"I've got my story to write.\"\n\n\"Just one more,\" Cameron said. \"This one's on me.\"\n\n\"I better not.\" He felt good about himself.\n\n\"Oh come on,\" Cameron said, and ordered. With a little bit of worry, Frank had his third: but couldn't he still write better than every other person who wrote about horse races? Of course he could.\n\nAfter the third thing, Frank bought a bottle of juice for later, when he had finished his story. Back in his own room he took just the smallest sip from it before he sat down to write.\n\nThe words wouldn't come. He tried six times and then poured some juice into a glass.\n\nMatthew, Cameron, Patrick, Adam ... It wasn't all that simple.\n\nHe took a sip. He didn't seem to be able to help it.\n\nThe boss would give him a prize for a story like this, or at least there would be no more arguing about stuff.\n\nHe took a sip.\n\nPatrick had gotten ten thousand coins for bumping into Salad Bowl. Now how did you write that without getting into trouble?\n\nHe took a sip.\n\nThe riders in the tenth race had decided together to let the only honest one among them win. How could you say that?\n\nHe took a sip.\n\nThe judges and the news people had been so focused on the crash in the big race and had not really noticed the tenth race. The tenth race had been fixed. The judges wouldn't be happy with him for pointing it out.\n\nHe took another sip. And another. And more.\n\nHis time to call his story into the office was ten o'clock the next morning. When that time came, he was asleep and snoring, fully dressed, on his bed. The empty juice bottle was on the floor next to him, and his winnings, which he had tried to count, were scattered over his chest.\nA NEW SEASON\n\nA magazine for women asked me for a story for them. (Five thousand words, please.)\n\nThey would let me decide what to write about, they said, but they would like a story that their women readers would like.\n\n\"A New Season,\" which I really liked writing, was the result.\n\nLooking back, Mrs. Alice could remember the exact moment she fell in love with her rider.\n\nAlice, round, motherly and fifty-two, watched the twenty-four-year-old man walk into the parade ring at the horse races in her shiny pink and white clothes, and she thought: \"How young he is, how strong, how thin ... how brave.\"\n\nHe crossed the bright grass to talk to her for a few minutes before taking her horse away to its two-mile run, and she looked at the way the sun-tanned skin lay tight over the cheekbones and agreed that yes, the spring sunshine was lovely, and that yes, the dry weather should suit her Billy better than the rain of the past few weeks.\n\nIt was a day like any other. Two racehorses had become the new favorites of Alice, who used to like Edward. Alice liked to go to horse races to see her favorite horses run, cut out stories about them from the newspaper, and call her trainer, Cameron, to ask how they were doing.\n\nAlice was a kind and happy woman, but she thought everyone was as nice as her. Like kids who pet tigers, she thought people would be happy when she was nice to them, not get mad.\n\nDavid, the horse rider, saw Mrs. Alice as the older woman who owned Billyboy and Hamlet, the horses he rode. He was always nice to her because he needed the money she paid him for riding her horses. His job, he thought, was to make the owners happy before and after each race as well as doing his best in the race. He knew that most owners were very happy when a rider said nice things about their horses, so he always tried to be positive even when he didn't really mean it.\n\nWhen he walked into the horse ring at CH place, looking for Mrs. Alice and seeing her across the grass in her green coat and brown hat, he was thinking that since Billyboy didn't have a good chance in today's race, he should prepare her for the disappointment and make sure she wouldn't blame him for it.\n\n\"Nice day,\" he said, shaking her hand. \"Just like spring.\"\n\n\"Nice.\" After a short silence, when she didn't say anything else, he tried again.\n\n\"Billyboy will do better now that the rain is drying up.\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm sure you're right.\"\n\nShe wasn't talking as much as usual, he thought. Not the normal excited chat. He watched Billyboy walk around the ring and said in a hopeful way: \"He should run well today... though the other horses are very good, of course.\"\n\nMrs. Alice, looking a little lost, just nodded. David, not really sure what to think, gave her a half-real smile and thought (wrongly) that if she had something on her mind and didn't want to talk, it wasn't his problem.\n\nA step away from them, also looking at the horse, stood Billyboy's trainer, Cameron. He was strong and almost sixty, and had always been a charming person. He had become successful more because of his personality than any special skill with horses. He wore nice clothes. He could talk.\n\nUnder his nice outside, there was a coldness that his quiet wife, his grown-up and married kids, and anyone who really knew him could see. He was fun to be around, but didn't show much care. He was friendly on the outside, but only cared about himself on the inside.\n\nCameron was experienced with riders and owners, and he respected the two in front of him: David, because he made the owners happy and rode well, and Alice because she cared about the horses more than the prizes they could win.\n\nLadies who were like mothers, in his mind, were the most forgiving owners, and he didn't mind their excited phone calls because they usually paid his bills quickly. Towards Alice, who had a nice house near a golf course, he acted in a fun and playful way. This behavior kept many women loyal to his stable, even though there were rumors that he might cheat them.\n\nAlice, like many other women, didn't believe the rumors. Cameron, sweet, fun Cameron, who made owning a horse so much fun, would never cheat her.\n\nAlice stood next to Cameron to watch the race, and felt very worried; not just for the safe return of dear Billy, but also for the man riding him. She watched him through her binoculars, thinking about the risks he was taking. Before that day, she had only thought about if he was riding at the right speed, or if he had taken a good path, or if he had finished strong. But during that race, her feelings for him changed from just thinking to feeling, a change that she didn't fully understand at the time.\n\nDavid, by pushing the horse when it was tired, made Billy finish in fourth place near the finish line. He knew that Alice would like fourth place better than fifth, sixth, or seventh. Cameron smiled to himself as he watched. Whether the horse was fourth or seventh, it didn't win any money; but David, with his good looks and clever ways, knew how to make the owners happy.\n\nHolding her binoculars close to her, Alice felt relieved after all the excitement. She thought that fourth place wasn't bad considering the tough competition, and Billy had been running strong at the end, which was a good sign...and David had come back safely.\n\nWith her trainer, she quickly went down to meet the returning pair, and watched Billy breathe heavily from his usual post-race sweat, and listened to David talking to her while he loosened the straps on the saddle.\n\n\"... made a bit of a mistake when jumping over the third last, but it didn't stop him... \"He should win a race soon,\" he said.\n\nHe gave her a special smile and hurried to get ready for the next race. Alice watched until he was not visible anymore and asked Cameron when her horses were running next.\n\n\"One of the horses was not feeling well this morning,\" he said, \"and the other horse needs two weeks at least between races.\" He looked at her, joking. \"If you can't wait that long to see them again, why don't you come one morning and watch their training?\"\n\nAlice was happy. \"Does David ride during training?\"\n\n\"Sometimes,\" he said.\n\nThe next day, Alice thought about getting another horse.\n\nShe called David.\n\n\"Find you another horse?\" he said. \"Yeah ... sure ... I think another horse is a good idea, but you should ask Mr. Cameron .. Cameron ..\"\n\n\"If Cameron finds me a horse,\" Alice said, \"will you come with me to see it? I'd like to know what you think before I buy.\"\n\n\"Well ...\" He wasn't sure about spending his free time like that but knew that another horse for Alice meant more work for him. \"All right, I'll come, Mrs. Alice.\"\n\n\"That's great,\" she said. \"I'll call Cameron right away.\"\n\n\"Another horse?\" Cameron said, surprised. \"Yes, if you like, though it's a bit late in the season. Maybe you should wait ... ?\"\n\n\"No,\" Alice interrupted. \"Dear Cameron, I want it now.\"\n\nCameron heard but couldn't understand why she was in such a hurry. Four days later, however, when she came to see her two horses work\u2014making sure that David would be there\u2014he understood completely.\n\nAlice couldn't keep her eyes off David. She watched him ride the horses and walk around, and she kept looking at his face while he talked. She asked him questions to keep him near, and seemed less lively when he went home.\n\nCameron, who had seen this kind of thing before, was more flirty with her than ever and kept his smile to himself. He had found a third horse for her, he said, and would take her to see it.\n\n\"Actually,\" Alice said shyly, \"I've already asked David to come with me..\". And he said he would.\"\n\nCameron, that evening, called David.\n\n\"Does she like me a lot?\" said David. \"That's silly. I've been riding horses for her for more than a year. You can't tell me I wouldn't have noticed.\"\n\n\"Keep your eyes open, boy,\" Cameron said. \"I think she wants this other horse just to see you more often; and that being so, boy, I've a little idea for you.\"\n\nHe talked about the little idea for a while, and David found out that he cared more about getting something right away than Mrs. Hannah's best interests.\n\nHe went to her house at WE place a few days later, and they went on together in her car, with David driving. The horse belonged to a man in YO place, which meant, Alice thought happily, that the trip would take all day.\n\nShe told herself that she just wanted another horse because she was more interested in racing, and also she told herself that she wanted to go to YO place because she wanted to see what Cameron had said was \"a good deal at twenty thousand, a horse that will make you proud, my dear Alice.\"\n\nShe thought she could just afford it, if she didn't go on a vacation this summer, and if she spent less on clothes. She did not admit to herself that what she was buying at such cost was a few scattered hours out of David's life.\n\nGoing north from WA place, he said: \"Mrs. Hannah, did Mr. Cameron tell you much about this horse?\"\n\n\"He said you'd tell me. And call me Alice.\"\n\n\"Er ...\" He cleared his throat. \"Alice ...\" He looked at her as she sat beside him, happy and relaxed. It couldn't be true, he thought. People like Mrs. Hannah didn't have crushes. She was far too old: fifty ... an age he couldn't imagine at twenty-four. He moved around in his seat and felt a little guilty about what he was about to do.\n\n\"Mr. Cameron thinks the horse is really good. Only six years old. Won a race last year ...\" He went on with the sales talk, carefully telling her the few true things which she could check if she wanted to, and making everything else sound good. \"Of course, the cold and snow has kept him from racing during the winter, but I'll tell you, just between us ... er, Alice ... that Mr. Cameron thinks he might even enter him for the big race. \"He might even be in that group.\"\n\nAlice listened happily. The big race, planned for in a few weeks, was the last big race of the year. To have a horse ready to run in it, and to have David ride it, felt like the highest point in her racing life that she had never thought of. Her happiness grew bigger.\n\n\"Oh, how wonderful,\" she said very happily; and David almost looked uncomfortable.\n\n\"Mr. Samuel wondered if you'd like me to help you lower the price,\" he said. \"To make it cheaper.\"\n\n\"Dear Cameron is so nice.\" She gave David a slightly worried smile. \"But don't make it so cheap that I lose the horse, okay?\"\n\nHe promised not to.\n\n\"What is its name?\" she asked, and he told her: \"Magic.\"\n\nMagic was kept in a place that should have told Alice to be careful, but she had heard many times that in the IR country, champions had been bought from very simple places, and she was not worried at all. Dear Cameron would certainly not get her a bad horse, and with David himself with her to give advice... She looked trustingly at the simple brown horse brought for her to look at and only saw her dreams\u2014not the muddy ground, not the old wood around the stable doors, not the old leather of the horse's things.\n\nShe saw Magic walking up and down the small stable yard and she saw him running a bit on a leash in a small field; and she didn't see the worry David couldn't hide on his face.\n\n\"What do you think?\" she asked, her eyes still bright despite everything.\n\n\"Good strong shoulder,\" he said thoughtfully. \"Maybe needs a bit more food to get better, perhaps.\"\n\n\"But do you like him?\"\n\nHe nodded firmly. \"Just right.\"\n\n\"I'll take him, then.\" She said it without any doubt and he pushed down the worries that were bothering him.\n\nShe waited in the car while David talked with Magic's owner, watching the two men as they stood together in the stable yard, shaking their heads, spreading their arms, shrugging and starting again. Finally, to her relief, they agreed on it, and David came to tell her that she could have the horse for a lot of money if she wanted.\n\n\"Think about it,\" he said, making it sound like she didn't have to.\n\nShe shook her head. \"I've decided. I really have. Should I give the man a check?\"\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"Mr. Samuel has to get a report from a vet, and arrange for transport and insurance and so on. \"He'll do all the writing and fix the horse, and you can give him all the money at once. Easier that way.\"\n\n\"Sweet Cameron,\" she said happily. \"Always so kind and thoughtful.\"\n\nCameron entered Magic for the big race at SA park, and also for what he called a \"warm-up\" race a few weeks before the big day.\n\n\"That will be at ST place,\" he told Alice. \"In the PR Cup, first week of Spring.\"\n\n\"How wonderful,\" Alice said happily.\n\nShe called David several times for long, nice talks about Magic's chances, and she liked his positive thinking like the best story. David filled her thoughts from morning to night: dear David, who was so brave and charming and kind.\n\nCameron and David took Magic out to the racetrack at home and found the \"exciting deal\" didn't want to keep up with any other horse there. Magic moved his tail around and kicked his legs and seemed very grumpy. But Cameron and David told a happy Alice that Magic was a very good boy and doing well.\n\nWhen Alice came to watch Magic work one morning, he had been sent out by mistake with the first group at sunrise, and was now resting. She was a little sad, but David was there, not riding but walking with her, full of smiles and laughter and friendship. She loved it. She trusted him completely, and she showed it.\n\n\"Good job, boy,\" Cameron said thankfully, as she left later. \"With you here, our Alice wouldn't notice a big shake.\"\n\nDavid, watching her leave, felt sad and sorry. It wasn't really fair, he thought. She was a nice lady really. She hadn't hurt anyone. He started to not like himself.\n\nThey went to the ST races all hoping for different things: David that Magic would at least finish, Alice that her horse would win, and Cameron that he wouldn't stop right at the start.\n\nThree miles. Quick track. Hard ground. Eighteen jumps.\n\nAlice's heart was beating fast as Magic, to the relief of both men, started off in the normal way, and decided to run steadily in the back half of the group. After nearly two miles of this, both men relaxed and knew that when Magic got tired and stopped, as he was bound to do soon, they could tell Alice, \"He needed the race,\" and \"He'll be ready for the big race,\" and she would believe it.\n\nA mile from the finish line, from habit, David gave Magic the signals to go faster by squeezing with his legs and making a clicking sound and moving the reins. Magic, the horse, made a mistake jumping over the fence, hit it hard, and landed on the ground.\n\nThe horse got up and walked away. The rider stayed on the ground.\n\n\"Derek,\" Alice yelled, scared.\n\n\"He messed up,\" Cameron said, upset, coming down from the watching place. \"Threw him off.\"\n\nAlice watched with worry as Derek, who wasn't moving, was put carefully onto a bed and taken to a big van; then she walked quickly to the room where he would be brought back.\n\nI shouldn't have gotten the horse, she thought, sad. If I didn't get the horse, Derek wouldn't be ... might not be ...\n\nHe was okay. She saw his hands move when the men in blue opened the big van doors. Her relief was as big as her fear. She felt weak.\n\nDerek had broken his leg and didn't care about Alice's feelings. He knew she was there because she tried to get to his side\u2014stopped by the men with the bed\u2014asking him again and again: \"Derek, oh, Derek, are you okay?\"\n\nDerek didn't answer. He was thinking about his leg, which hurt, and getting into the big van room without being moved too much. There were always a lot of people around the door trying to see. He looked at the faces looking down and didn't like their interest. It was nice to him, as always, when they took him through the door and closed out the people looking.\n\nInside, waiting for the doctor and lying on a bed, he thought sadly that he deserved this problem.\n\nOutside, Alice walked around without a plan. She thought that she should worry about the horse, but she couldn't; she could only think about Derek.\n\n\"Don't worry, miss,\" a voice said happily. \"Your Magic is okay. Walking in the middle there and they're having a hard time catching him. Don't worry.\"\n\nSurprised, she looked at the strong man with the different way of speaking who stood in her way.\n\n\"That horse came from my brother,\" he said. \"I'm here special to see him run.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Alice, not really understanding.\n\n\"Is the boy okay? The one who rode him?\"\n\n\"I think he's broken his leg.\"\n\n\"Oh no. That's not good. He made a tough deal with my brother, that boy.\"\n\n\"Did he?\"\n\n\"Yes. My brother said Magic was a fast runner, but your boy, he didn't agree, said the horse didn't look very good, and seemed quite useless to him. My brother wanted seven thousand for it, but your boy got him down to five. I came here, see, to learn who was right.\" He smiled brightly. \"To be honest, the horse didn't run very well, did it? I guess your boy was right. But don't worry, lady, there will be another day.\"\n\nHe waved and moved away. Alice felt out of breath, as if he had surprised her.\n\nNear the exit, she turned and walked out, her legs taking her to her car. Shaking, she sat in the driver's seat, and drove all the way home. \"The man must be mistaken,\" she thought. \"Not seven and five thousand, but twenty and nineteen.\" When she got home she called the previous owner of Magic.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"Five thousand, that's correct.\" His cheerful voice travelled through the phone. \"They charged you a bit more, did they?\" He laughed. \"A little bit more, maybe? You can't blame them for that, lady. They have to make a living. That's just how things are.\"\n\nShe hung up the phone, and sat on her sofa, staring into nothing. She realized for the first time that she loved David. She understood that Cameron and David must have seen it in her long ago, and because of it had been unfair and taken advantage of her in a way that was very unkind.\n\nAll the love she had given them, all the happiness ... they had taken it and hadn't cared for her at all. They don't even like me, she thought. David doesn't even like me.\n\nThe pain of his rejection filled her with a sadness she had never felt before. How could she, she wondered sadly, have been so silly, so unaware, so childlike.\n\nAfter a while, she walked through the big house, which was so quiet now that Ethan wasn't there, and went into the kitchen. She made herself a cup of tea, and cried.\n\nWithin a week she visited David in the hospital. He was lying in a big room with his leg up, and for a moment he looked like a stranger: a thin young man with his head back on the pillows and his eyes closed. She thought he looked more like a sick child than a strong young man.\n\nThat was not true.\n\nHe heard her come to his bedside and opened his eyes. He was surprised to see her there. He looked embarrassed. He smiled. His smile was not nice. Alice felt a little sick.\n\nShe sat by his bed. \"David,\" she said, \"I've come to say well done.\"\n\nHe was confused. \"Why?\"\n\n\"For getting more money: the difference between five thousand and nineteen.\"\n\nHis smile went away and he looked away from her. He felt trapped and angry and sad, and he wanted her to leave.\n\n\"How much of it,\" Alice said slowly, \"was yours, and how much was Cameron's?\" There was a long silence.\n\nThen he said: \"Half and half.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" Alice said. She stood up, pushing back the chair. \"That's all. I wanted to hear you say it.\"\n\nAnd to know for sure, she thought, that she was better; that she didn't care about him anymore\u2014and she didn't.\n\n\"That's all?\" he said.\n\nShe nodded. \"What you did wasn't wrong, just ... well, bad. I should have been smarter.\" She took a step away. \"Good-bye, David.\"\n\nShe had walked away a bit when he called after her, \"Alice ... Mrs. Hannah.\"\n\nShe turned around and walked halfway back.\n\n\"Please,\" he said. \"Please listen. Just for a minute.\"\n\nAlice walked slowly back to his bedside.\n\n\"You might not believe me,\" he said, \"but I've been thinking about the horse race ... and I think Magic might not be bad after all.\"\n\n\"No,\" Alice said. \"No more lies. I've had enough.\"\n\n\"I'm not ... This is not a lie. Not this.\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"Listen,\" he said. \"Magic didn't do well in the race because no one asked him to\u2014except at the end, when I tried to make him run faster. And then he fell because I did it too close to the fence ... and when I told him to go, he ran fast as if he was scared.\"\n\nAlice listened, but she did not believe him.\n\n\"Some horses,\" he said, \"don't run fast at home. Magic doesn't and so we thought ... I thought ... that he couldn't race either. But I'm not certain now.\"\n\nAlice shrugged. \"It doesn't change anything. But I'll find out when he runs in the big race.\"\n\n\"No.\" He looked uncomfortable. \"We never planned to let him run in the big race.\"\n\n\"But he's entered,\" she said.\n\n\"Yes, but ... well, Mr. Samuel will tell you, a day or two before the race, that Magic is not feeling well, or has hurt his foot, or something, and can't run. He ... we ... planned it. We thought you wouldn't fuss about the price if you thought Magic was a big race kind of horse ...\"\n\nAlice let out a sigh. She looked down at the young man who was nervously playing with his sheets and not looking at her. She saw his discomfort and the tiredness and the pain from his leg, and she thought that what she had felt for him had been as hard on him as it had been on her.\n\nAt home, Alice called Cameron. \"Dear Cameron, how is Magic?\"\n\n\"He's fine, Alice, I'm glad to say.\"\n\n\"How wonderful,\" she said warmly. \"And now there's the big race to look forward to, isn't there?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed.\" He laughed. \"Better buy a new hat, my dear.\"\n\n\"Cameron,\" Alice said sweetly, \"I am counting on you to keep Magic healthy and well-fed and not hurt in any way. I'm counting on him showing up to start in the big race, and on him showing us just exactly how bad he is.\"\n\n_\"What?\"_\n\n\"Because if he doesn't, Cameron dear, I might just find myself talking to a few people ... you know, news people and even the money man, and people like that ... about you buying Magic for a little money one day and selling him to me for a lot of money the next.\"\n\nAlice listened to the silence coming loudly through the phone, and she smiled. \"And Cameron dear, we'll both tell his new rider to win if he can, won't we? Because it's got to be a fair race, don't you think? And just to encourage you, I'll promise you that if I'm satisfied that Magic has done his very best, win or lose, I won't mention to anyone what I paid for him. And that's a deal, Cameron dear, that you can trust.\"\n\nCameron put the phone down hard and said a bad word. \"Grumpy old woman. She must have found out.\" He called to YO country and discovered she had. He was upset and worried about looking silly in front of other race lovers, because he was using a not-so-good horse like Magic in one of the big races. This would not make people think good of him.\n\nCameron did not feel guilty at all. He had, after all, tricked many silly ladies the same way. But if Alice spoke\u2014and she could talk a lot when she wanted\u2014he would find that the trusting widowed ladies were suddenly careful and buying their horses from someone else. Magic, he thought angrily, would have to be trained as well as possible, and ridden by the best horse rider available.\n\nOn a special morning, Alice asked her friend to promise to back up Magic for her: a lot on both sides on the To place.\n\n\"Anything can happen in a race,\" she said.\n\nIn the show ring at SA park, Alice was back to her old self: nice and excited and bright-eyed.\n\nShe talked to her new horse rider, who was very different from David. \"I guess you've talked with sweet Cameron,\" she said happily, \"but I think it would be best, don't you, if you keep Magic a bit behind all the other runners for most of the way, and then about a mile from the end tell him to start winning, if you understand what I mean, and, of course, after that it's up to both of you just to do what you can.\"\n\nThe horse rider looked unsure at the serious face of Cameron. \"Do what the lady wants,\" Cameron said.\n\nThe horse rider, who knew his job, did as told. A mile from the end he pushed Magic a bit and was surprised at the response. Magic\u2014young, not much raced and carrying light weight\u2014passed several older, tired horses, and was fifth near the last fence.\n\nCameron could hardly believe what he was seeing. Alice could hardly breathe. Magic jumped over the last fence and ran fast up the straight and finished third.\n\n\"There,\" she said, \"isn't that wonderful?\"\n\nSince almost no one else had backed her horse, Alice won a lot of money from the To place; and a few days later, for exactly what she'd paid, she sold Magic to a metal seller from KE.\n\nAlice sent David a get-well card. A week later she sent him a case of special drink and a simple message: \"Thanks.\"\n\nI've learned a lot, she thought, because of him. A lot about wanting too much and being too trusting, about pretending and results and how love can change quickly. And about running fast... too much.\n\nShe sold Ben and Henry and went on a fun trip.\nA LUCKY GUESS\n\n_In the late 20th century, Jack,_ a big _member of The Guessing Club, had a plan to make money for the Club's empty money box. As the head, he asked a lot of mystery writers to write a short story for a book called_ Guess of Thirteen: A Guessing Club Book.\n\n_Since I'm not good at writing about court, I wrote a story about a race called \"Twenty-one Good Men,\" and that's what it was published as by a big book company in BR country and another one in US place, both in the late 20th century. In EN place, the story was also shared by a weekly magazine_ Women's Book, _who gave it the name we use here, \"A Lucky Guess.\"_\n\nAdam whistled while he made his cup of coffee and put instant cheap coffee into the old blue cup from BR place. The whistling didn't have a melody or rhythm, but it showed he was happy\u2014with everything in general and what he was about to do. Adam, as always, was going to watch the races: and as always, if he made a guess, he would win. Neat, careful, professional, he would use his perfect system and get richer, one thing leading to the next just like chickens and eggs.\n\nAdam at forty-five was a man who liked being alone, a thin man used to taking care of himself, a man who found talking with others annoying. Like a sailor\u2014even though he had never been to sea\u2014he kept his place clean and organized, keeping his life in plastic bags and food he warmed up again.\n\nThe one small problem for Adam was his wealth. Getting the money was what he enjoyed the most. Spending it was something he put off to a far-off and dreamy future, when he would trade his simple apartment for a never-ending fun time under tropical trees. It was where to keep the money for now that was making him, if not really worry, at least sometimes frown with doubt. He might, he thought, as he mixed dry milk into a brownish drink, have to find room for another wardrobe in his already full bedroom.\n\nIf anyone had told Adam he was a miser, he would have said no strongly. True, he lived simply, but because he was used to it not because he was obsessed: and he never took out his money just to look at it, and count, and feel happy. He would not have called it being a miser the warm feeling that came over him every night as he went to sleep, smiling because he knew all around him, filling two wood-finished cheap bedroom sets, was a lot of paper that was worth money.\n\nIt was not that Adam didn't trust banks. He knew that money won from guessing games couldn't be taken away by a cost. He wouldn't have kept his winnings with him if his guessing system wasn't also a clever trick.\n\nThe best tricks are found out by accident, and Arnold couldn't imagine such an accident happening to _him._\n\nJack woke up to his usual darkness and had three separate thoughts as soon as he woke up. \"The sun is shining. It's the middle of the week. They are having a race today here at home.\" He reached out and touched his bedside recorder. There was a cassette there. Jack smiled, put the cassette in the recorder and turned it on.\n\nHis mom's voice spoke to him. \"Jack, don't forget the man is coming to fix the TV at mid-morning and please put the dirty clothes into the machine, dear, as I am very busy this morning, and could you have the same soup again for lunch. I've left it in a pot ready. Don't lose all that money this afternoon or I'll unplug your music player. I'll be home a little while after dinner, love.\"\n\nJack's mom, who was not old, supported them both with her earnings as a nurse, and she had done a good job, her son thought, of taking care of a child who couldn't see. He was fifteen. He studied at home with special books and did well on tests.\n\nHe got out of bed and put on his clothes: a blue top, blue pants. \"Blue is Jack's favorite color,\" his mom would say, and her friends would say, \"Really?\" and she could see them thinking: How could he possibly know? But Jack could tell what blue was as surely as his mom's voice, and red, and yellow, and every color there is, as long as it was daylight.\n\n\"I can't see when it's dark,\" he had said when he was six, and only his mom, from watching him move surely by day and stumble by night, had understood what he meant. She called him walking radar. Like many young people who couldn't see, he could easily sense the light, and tell the tiny changes of light reflected from colored things close to him. People who didn't know him thought he was strange. Jack believed everyone could see that way if they wanted to, and couldn't clearly understand what was meant by seeing.\n\nHe made and ate some toast and opened the door to the TV fixer with relief. \"In my room,\" he said, leading the way. \"We've got sound but no picture.\"\n\nThe TV fixer looked at Jack's eyes and shrugged. If the boy wanted a picture he could have it, just like everyone else who paid their rent. \"I need to take it back to the fix place,\" he said, while pushing buttons.\n\n\"The big race is happening,\" Jack said. \"Can you fix it by then?\"\n\n\"Race? Oh yeah. Well ... Tell you what, I'll give you another one. Got one in the car ...\" He walked away with the broken one and came back with a new one. \"You have a lot of radios, don't you?\" he said, looking around. \"Why do you need six?\"\n\n\"I use them for different things,\" Jack said. \"That one\"\u2014he pointed\u2014\"listens to planes, that one to the police, those three over there are for normal radio stations, and this one ... local stuff.\"\n\n\"You need a thing to send out messages. It will connect you with everyone.\"\n\n\"I'm working on it,\" Jack said. \"Starting today.\"\n\nHe closed the door after the man and wondered if betting on a sure thing was bad.\n\nGabriel had no such worries. He paid to get into the AS place, and walked off to get a sandwich and drink. Two years now, he thought, eating, since he first started: two years since he had changed his ideas for better life and stopped being sad.\n\nThose fifteen months of hard times felt like a long time ago; the terrible time when his safe world fell apart. It didn't help to know that changes and cuts had made a lot of people like him lose their jobs.\n\nAt fifty-two, with a lot of good experiences and skills, he thought he would easily find another good job; but every door was closed, and everyone said, \"Sorry, Gabriel,\" \"Sorry, old friend,\" \"Sorry, Mr. Gabriel, we need someone younger,\" made him very upset. And it was just when, despite trying to save money, his wife couldn't even give their two kids money for swimming, that he saw a strange job ad:\n\n_\"Jobs for grown-ups who have been without work for at least twelve months.\"_\n\nPart of him thought he was being asked to do something wrong, but he went to the meeting in a LO city pub anyway, and he felt better when he met the very normal man offering help\u2014a man like him, middle-aged, middle-educated, wearing a suit and tie.\n\n\"Do you go to the big races?\" Adam asked him straight, looking at him closely. \"Do you play games for money? Do you watch horse races? Play to win?\"\n\n\"No,\" Gabriel said, a bit upset, seeing the job chance go away but feeling proud anyway. \"I'm afraid not.\"\n\n\"Do you bet on dogs? Go to fun games? Do some guessing games? Play card games? Like spinning games?\" the man kept asking.\n\nGabriel shook his head no and got ready to leave.\n\n\"Good,\" said Adam, happily. \"People who play games for money are not good for this job.\"\n\nGabriel felt happy about himself. \"What job then?\" he asked.\n\nAdam wiped away Gabriel's happy feeling. \"Going to the races,\" he said plainly. \"Betting when I say bet, and never at any other time. You would have to go to race games most days, like any other job. You would be betting on sure things, and after every win I would expect you to send me my reward.\" He said a very fair amount. \"Anything you made above that would be yours. It is safe and sure. If you do it in a serious way, and don't get tempted into the silly game of betting on your own guess, you'll do very well. Think it over. If you're interested, meet me here again tomorrow.\"\n\nBetting on sure things ... every one a winner: Adam had been as good as his word, and Gabriel's life had gone back to normal. His worries went away once he learned that even if the trick was found out, he himself would not be in trouble. He did not know how his boss got his always right information and, if he wondered, he didn't ask.\n\nHe knew him only as Benjamin, and had never met him since those first two days; but he listened to his warning that if he didn't go to the named race games or didn't send his agreed payment, the money would stop.\n\nHe finished his sandwich and went down to join the people who take bets as the horses ran down to the post for the start of the first race.\n\nFrom high on the stands Adam looked down through big glasses, spotting his workers one by one. The perfect workers, he thought: no missing days, no problems, no complaints.\n\nThere were twenty-one of them at the moment on his list, all happily getting his information, all dutifully sending their fair amounts, and none of them knowing about the others. In an average week, after costs, he easily added a thousand or more to his secret stash.\n\nIn the five years since he had started in a small way to make his plan work, he had never picked a person who didn't pay. The thinking-it-over time gave the scared and the honest an easy way out; and if Adam himself had doubts, he simply didn't come back on day two.\n\nThe others, slowly added to the group, lived happily and peacefully, hoping that their kind friend would never get into trouble.\n\nAdam himself couldn't see why he would ever get into trouble. He put down his looking glass and began to get on with his day's work in his usual careful way. There was always a lot to do, like filling out papers, checking tools and making sure the close-by telephone was working. Adam never left anything to chance.\n\nAt the starting place, sixteen young horses jumped and danced as they were fed by the handlers into the stalls. Young horses, thought the starter with a sigh, looking at his watch, could behave like a group of drama queens on a hot day. If they didn't hurry with that brown horse that was presently squealing and backing away, he would let the other runners go without him.\n\nHe knew the TV cameras were pointing at him, waiting for him to make a mistake. Starters who got the races started late were not liked. Starters who got the races started early were asking for official complaints and everyone's bad words, because of the tricks that had been played in the past.\n\nThe starter ruled the brown horse out of the race and pulled his lever at time plus three minutes twenty seconds, writing down the time carefully in his records. The gates opened loudly, the fifteen remaining horses ran out of the stalls and along the stands, the rows of race glasses followed their run over the five short distances.\n\nAlone in his special box, the judge watched carefully. A big group of young horses running over five short distances was a problem, sometimes even his experienced eyes had a hard time telling who came first.\n\nHe had learned all the horses by name and all the colors by heart, a task he shared every day with the race-telling commentators, and from knowing them for a long time he could recognize most of the riders by their riding style alone; but still the shame of making a mistake went through his dreams.\n\nUp in his high place, the TV commentator looked through his strong looking glass, which was mounted very steady like a telescope, and spoke slowly into his microphone.\n\n\"Among the early leaders are Benjamin and Madison, followed closely by Patrick, Jack, David Boy and Gabriel ... Coming to the short distance marker the leaders are close together, with Jack, David Boy, Benjamin all showing ... One short distance out, there is nothing to choose between David Boy, Jack, Gabriel, Patrick ..... One short distance out, there is nothing to choose between David Boy, Jack, Gabriel, Patrick . In the last hundred steps ... Jack, David Boy ...\"\n\nThe horses stretched their necks, the riders swung their whips, the crowd stood on their toes and yelled loudly, which drowned out the commentary, and in his box the judge's eyes hurt from trying so hard. Four little toy horses named Darling Boy, Jetset, Gumshoe and Pickup ran past the finish line all together, and a voice from the big speakers said: \"Picture. Picture.\"\n\nFar away in his room, Jack listened to the race on TV and tried to imagine what was happening. He didn't understand much about races. He knew what horses looked like from his toys, but he didn't know how big or fast they really were; he didn't know what a big racetrack looked like, or how big trees were.\n\nAs he grew older, Jack realized he was lucky to have his mom, and he tried to protect her instead of arguing, which sometimes made her cry. He was happy when the TV fixer came, because he knew his mom liked to hear the sounds from the TV, just like he liked to see the pictures.\n\nEven though he tried a lot, he couldn't see much on the TV with his fingers. The colors on the TV didn't feel like real colors.\n\nHe sat tight at his table, with the phone on his right and a radio on his left. He didn't know if the strange thing would happen again; but if it did, he would be ready.\n\n\"One more small bit to go, it's too close to tell ...\" said the man on TV, his voice getting louder and more excited. \"In the last bit, Jetset, Darling Boy, Pickup and Gumshoe ... At the finish line, all together ... maybe Pickup won, but we have to wait for the picture. Let's watch the end of the race again ...\"\n\nThe TV showed the race again, and Jack waited with his fingers over the big numbers on the phone.\n\nOver at the racetrack, people were making bets as fast as they could. People always liked to bet on close races.\n\nSome people really trusted their own eyes; others wanted to bet again to make sure they didn't lose. A picture was their second chance, their way to save themselves from losing their bets.\n\n\"Pickup to win,\" shouted young Benjamin, from his spot in the front row facing the stands. \"Pickup to win.\" Lots of people came to him from the crowded steps.\n\n\"Ten on Pickup, right sir. Five on a game, right sir. Twenty, you're up, sir. A hundred? Yes, if you like. A hundred on a game, why not?\" Benjamin, who thought our friend won the game by a tiny bit, was happy to take the money.\n\nGabriel took Benjamin's ticket for a hundred on the game and hurried to repeat his bet with as many people as he could reach. There was never much time between knowing and the winner being announced. Never much, but always enough. Two minutes at least. Sometimes as much as five. A determined player could make five or six bets in that time, if they were brave and pushed a bit.\n\nGabriel thought he could get to the front of the closest crowd after all those years of rush-hour travel, and he managed, that day at the fun place, to use all the money he had brought with him; all on the game.\n\nNeither Benjamin, nor any of his friends, felt suspicious. Sure, there was a lot of support for the game; but so there was for the three other games, and in a finish like this one a lot of money always changed hands. Benjamin welcomed it himself, because it gave him, too, a chance of making more money on the game.\n\nGabriel noticed one or two others hurrying with money to the game, and wondered, not for the first time, if they were working for Mr. Smith. He was sure he'd seen them often at other games, but he did not want to go up to one of them and ask. It was safer to not know\u2014for him, for them and, of course, for Bob.\n\nThe judge in his box looked carefully at the black-and-white picture, figuring out which was our friend, and which was the other. He could see the winner easily enough, and had said its number out loud as he wrote it on the pad next to him.\n\nThe microphone linked to the loudspeaker waited quietly at his elbow for him to decide on second and third places, a task that seemed very difficult. Number two, or number eight. But which was which? Time was passing.\n\nIt was quiet in his box, the hurrying and shouting among the people below hardly reaching him through the thick window.\n\nAt his shoulder a person from the fun place waited patiently, his job only to make the actual announcement, once the decision was made. With a bright light and a magnifying glass the judge looked at the pictures. If he got them wrong, a thousand people who know a lot about pictures would let him know it.\n\nHe wondered if he should get new glasses. Pictures never seemed so clear to him these days.\n\nGabriel thought sadly that the man in charge was taking too long. If he knew he would have had so much time, he would have brought more money. But, he knew he would get more money soon for his afternoon's work, and he would give Mr. Samuel a little bit of it with a thankful heart.\n\nGabriel smiled happily, and quickly, he touched the small listening device he wore hidden under his hair and hat behind his left ear.\n\nJack listened carefully, his head down, his curly dark hair falling onto the radio he was listening to. He heard a soft sound from the radio, but he waited with a fast heartbeat and a feeling of excitement. If nothing happened, he thought quickly, it would be really boring.\n\nEven though he was ready, he almost missed it. The radio said one word, \"Eleven.\" The sound from the radio kept going, as if nothing had happened, and it took Jack's brain two whole seconds to start laughing happily.\n\nHe pressed the buttons and called the local betting place. \"Hello? This is Jack. I have some money with you for this afternoon. Well... please will you put it all on the close finish of this race they just ran at the racing place? On number eleven, please.\"\n\n\"Eleven?\" said a normal-sounding voice on the other side. \"Fast plane?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Jack said patiently.\n\n\"Eleven. Fast plane. All even, right?\"\n\n\"Right,\" Jack said. \"I was watching it on the TV.\"\n\n\"We all do, friend,\" said the voice before hanging up.\n\nJack sat back with a feeling of doing something sneaky. If eleven really had won, he was just taking money from the betting place. But who could know? How could anyone ever know? He wouldn't tell his mom, because she would not like it and might make him give the money back.\n\nHe thought about what his mom would say if she came home and found out he had made more money. He also thought about what she would say if she found out he had lost all the money on the first race betting on the finish that he couldn't even see.\n\nHe didn't tell her that it was because of the numbers on the radio he wanted to bet. He had said that he knew people often bet from home while they were watching racing on TV. He had said it would be a fun new thing to do while she was at work.\n\nHe had easily convinced her to lend him something and make things right with the book people, and he wouldn't have done it if he wasn't sure it would work.\n\nWhen he first got the radio that could hear airplane sounds, he spent a lot of time listening to the big planes flying overhead to and from the big airport. But after a while, he got bored and started listening less and less.\n\nOne day, by accident, he was turning the dial on the radio looking for something fun to listen to, but he didn't find anything and forgot to turn the radio off. Later that day, while he was watching the horse races on TV, the radio suddenly said a number: \"Twenty-three.\"\n\nJack turned the radio off but didn't really pay attention until the person talking on the TV about the horse race said the same thing. \"Twenty-three... Swan Lake, number twenty-three, is the winner.\"\n\n\"That's weird,\" Jack thought. He left the radio alone and turned it on again the next Saturday, while watching more horse races on TV. There were two really close races, but the radio didn't say anything. The same thing happened at other horse races, and Jack thought it was just a weird coincidence. But two weeks later, at another horse race, he decided to try it one more time.\n\n\"Five,\" said the radio quietly, and later, \"Ten.\" And sure enough, the horses number five and ten won their races.\n\nThe person deciding who won the races was tired. He gave his final decision to the person waiting to announce it on the microphone.\n\n\"First, number eleven,\" he said. \"A tie for second place between numbers two and eight. First Jetset. Tie for second, Darling Boy and Pickup. The distance between first and second a short head. The fourth horse was number twelve.\"\n\nThe judge sat back in his chair and wiped his forehead. Another close race was over, but it was definitely making him nervous.\n\nAdam picked up his binoculars to better see the people who won money from the horse races. His twenty-one trusty men had certainly had time today for a lot of work. Gabriel, especially, was doing really well; but then Gabriel, with his great skills, was always, in Adam's opinion, the one most likely to do best. Gabriel's success made Adam as happy as his own.\n\nBen gave Gabriel his winnings without looking twice, and also gave money to five other people whose small radios were hidden by their hair. He thought he had lost a lot with the picture betting, but his bets for the race were in good shape. Benjamin, feeling good, started thinking about the next event.\n\nJack laughed loudly and hit the table with a happy hand. Someone, somewhere, was talking on an open microphone, and if Jack was lucky enough to hear it, why not? He thought of the information as a lucky break, not cheating, and he waited with simple joy for another group of horses to finish close together.\n\nBetting on sure things was okay, he thought, as long as you got the information honestly.\n\nAfter the fourth race, he made a phone call to bet on number fifteen, making his winnings bigger.\n\nGabriel went home at the end of the day with a problem of where to keep all his money, almost as big as Adam's problem. He found out that there is a limit to the amount of money you can keep in a normal suit, and he finally had to wrap the money in a newspaper and carry it home under his arm, like fish and chips.\n\n\"Two in one day,\" he thought happily. \"A big win. A day to remember.\" And there was always tomorrow, back here at AS place, and Saturday at SA place, and next week, according to the list that had come in the mail, NE city and WI city. With a little luck, he could soon get a new car, and Jessica could start planning the ski trip with the kids.\n\nBenjamin packed up his stand and equipment, and with the help of his helper carried them the half-mile to his betting shop in AS main street. Benjamin, when he was eighteen, had surprised his teachers by not going to college and instead learning about betting from his local bookie. Benjamin, when he was twenty-four, had taken over the business, and now, three years later, was ready to make it bigger.\n\nHe had had a good day overall and, after adding up the total and locking the safe, he took his betting-shop manager to the pub.\n\n\"Funny thing,\" said the manager after their second drink. \"That new account\u2014you know, the one you set up yesterday, with that nurse.\"\n\n\"Oh yes ... the nurse. Gave me money in advance. They don't often do that.\" He drank his drink.\n\n\"Yeah ... Well, this Jack, while he was watching the TV, he made two bets, both on the results of the pictures, and he was right both times.\"\n\n\"We can't have that,\" said Benjamin, pretending to be serious.\n\n\"He didn't make other bets, see? \"That's strange,\" he said.\n\n\"What's his name?\" Ben asked.\n\n\"Adam,\" he replied.\n\nThe lady at the bar came closer, smiling warmly. Her pink shirt was very tight. \"Adam?\" she said. \"He's a nice boy. It's sad that he can't see.\"\n\n\"What?\" said Ben.\n\nThe lady at the bar nodded. \"He and his mom, they live close by in the new houses, next to my sister. He mostly stays at home, studying and listening to his radios. And you wouldn't believe it, but he can tell colors; he really can. My sister says it's strange, but he told her she was wearing a green coat and she was.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it.\"\n\n\"It's true,\" said the lady at the bar, a bit upset.\n\n\"No,\" Ben said. \"I don't believe that even if he can tell a green coat from a red one, that he could see colors on a TV with three or four horses running. Even if you can see, it's hard to do.\" He sat and thought. \"But I did lose a lot today because of those pictures.\"\n\nHe thought more. \"We all lost a lot because of those pictures. I heard some of the other people who take bets complaining about the many bets on Jetset.\" He looked worried. \"I don't see how it could be fixed, though.\"\n\nBen put down his glass with a loud noise that made everyone in the bar jump. \"Did you say Adam listens to radios? What radios?\"\n\n\"How should I know?\" said the lady at the bar, a bit upset.\n\n\"He lives close to the racing track,\" Ben said, thinking hard. \"So what if he somehow heard the photo result before it was announced. But that doesn't explain the delay ... how there was time for him\u2014and probably quite a lot of others who heard the same thing\u2014to place their bets.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you're talking about,\" said the lady at the bar.\n\n\"I think I'll go and see Adam,\" said Ben. \"And ask who or what he heard ... if he heard anything at all.\"\n\n\"That's a bit of a stretch,\" said the boss. \"The only person who could delay things long enough would be the judge.\"\n\n\"Oh my,\" said Ben, shocked by the thought. \"What about the judge?\"\n\nArnold did not know about the plan being made in the bar. To Arnold, Ben was just a name on a betting stand. He couldn't imagine that smart Ben would go to a bar where the lady at the bar had a sister who lived next to a blind boy who had heard his secret message on a radio that was left on and could pick up certain signals.\n\nAdam traveled happily home with his small talking machine hidden inside his jacket pocket, its small stick hidden out of sight.\n\nThe way the talking machine worked, he thought, was safe, as only a flying machine was likely to hear it, and no pilot would think a simple number spoken in the air was about the winning horse race.\n\nBack at the horse race, Adam had carefully packed away the very special and costly machine that belonged to the company that employed him. Adam was not the judge. Adam's job was to operate the camera that took the picture at the finish line. It was he who watched the picture develop; he who could take his time delivering it to the judge; he who always knew the winner first.\n\nThe way to fairness is winding, long, costly and slow, and sometimes never arrives. \"Corkscrew\" gets there, more or less, teaching lessons on the way.\n\nFirst lesson: if you aim to be kind, be careful.\n\nSamuel leaned on the white rails of a private training track in SC state (U.S.A.) and tried to understand the quiet man beside him.\n\nBoth were English. Samuel was trying to sell to the other (Jack) the two-year-old SC-born horse presently being fast-run round the track by the top exercise rider employed by Samuel whenever he wanted to make a big sale.\n\nHis talk about the horse's family and early speed was truthful. The excitement he put into his admiration of the fine head, the kind eye and the big chest was in fact deserved. The horse at that moment was earning every compliment paid her\u2014it was only the future, as in all of life, that couldn't be predicted.\n\nJack watched the horse's smooth run and listened to the real excitement in the salesman's voice. He thought Samuel good at his job, but beyond that paid more attention to the fast two-year-old that seemed to be all he needed.\n\nThe exercise rider finished two circuits\u2014one walking and trotting, one a fast run\u2014and, stopping, trotted to the two watchers on the rails.\n\n\"Thanks, Patrick,\" Samuel nodded.\n\n\"And thanks,\" Jack added. He turned to the salesman. \"If a horse doctor says the horse is healthy, I'll buy her at the price we agreed.\"\n\nThe two men shook hands on the deal and Jack without excitement got into the dark green car waiting nearby and drove away.\n\nSamuel called the animal agency he worked for and told them about the successful sale. His boss, Ryan, who owned the agency, liked Samuel, mostly because he was good at selling but also because he was a good person. Ryan saw Samuel's strong body, gray hair, and kind voice as good things that made customers trust the agency and want to give them their money.\n\n\"Our Mr. Henry,\" Samuel reported, \"is a quiet man. I don't think he knows much about horses. He agreed to buy the young horse but, like you told me, I didn't ask him for any money right away.\"\n\n\"What did he look like?\" asked Ryan.\n\nConfused, Samuel did his best to describe him. \"Well, he was not very tall. Maybe around fifty years old. Normal. He had a fancy English accent. He wore a gray suit and a tie. He wouldn't stand out in a crowd.\"\n\n\"Our Mr. Henry,\" Ryan said calmly, \"the Mr. Henry you just described, I think, is a computer creator. An inventor. A business owner.\"\n\n\"What does that mean for us?\" Samuel asked.\n\n\"He can buy a lot of young horses.\"\n\nThe quiet Mr. Henry was buying the beautiful two-year-old horse as a gift for the happy lady who had decided she wanted to marry him. Her first two husbands were bossy and then they died and left her a lot of money: Henry, who was even richer, enjoyed letting her make the decisions. The lady loved him.\n\nShe knew a lot about horses and loved spending days at the horse races. Before he met her, Henry didn't know much about the big horse race. He spent his days making and improving tiny computer parts and was quiet because he was always thinking deeply.\n\nWhen these two first had dinner and spent the night together, they found that their different interests and personalities worked well together. Time had made their relationship even stronger.\n\nIn England, Samuel's mother packed her suitcase with excitement and tried to calm down her two excited grandchildren, Bob and Madison (ten and eight), who were going to South Carolina to spend two weeks of their Easter school vacation with their father.\n\nSamuel, who was divorced, didn't see his children very often. The upcoming visit, and that of his mother, made him very happy. Two whole weeks! He had told Ryan not to give him any work during that time.\n\nHe had paid for all his family's travel: his mother, who was a widow, lived on a small amount of money and his ex-wife, who had remarried, had said if he wanted the children to stay with him, he had to pay for them. He went to pick them up from the big plane place and was very happy to give them hugs and kisses. His mom, in new clothes, wiped her eyes and the kids, who had never left EN country before, looked at the big open space of AM country with surprise.\n\nSamuel lived in a rented place near a lake with a great view of boats, trees, and the water. He drove for an hour to get to the place where he worked. He worked for Ryan who paid him with cash.\n\nOn the day the kids arrived, things were going well for Samuel. He was living a good life without too much worry.\n\nThe kids, and his mom, were excited about eating fast food like burgers and fries. They learned new words like \"Hold the mayo\" and thought it was fun.\n\nThat was a Tuesday. On Wednesday morning, Samuel put on a light robe over his sleep clothes. He left his family to explore different kinds of breakfast food and went to buy a newspaper.\n\nThere was a man named Bill in the lobby who did lots of jobs. Samuel said hi to Bill and didn't pay attention to the two police men.\n\nBut, Bill said, \"That's him\" to the police men. They quickly grabbed Samuel and told him to put his hands up and legs apart.\n\nSamuel had been in AM country long enough to know that it was better not to argue. The police men were scared and wanted to make sure he didn't have a gun. They put his hands behind his back and told him that anything he said could be used against him in court.\n\n\"What did I do?\" he asked.\n\nThe police men didn't know. They were only told to bring Samuel in for questions.\n\nSamuel asked if they could go up with him so he could get dressed and tell his kids he would be gone for a little while. The police didn't answer but pushed him towards the doors.\n\n\"Tell my mom, Benjamin,\" said Samuel, looking back. But he wasn't sure if Benjamin would do it. You couldn't count on Benjamin for even the smallest help.\n\nSamuel still didn't take being caught by the police seriously. He laughed a lot to himself when the police drove around in circles because they couldn't find the way back to the main road. But even if it was funny, it became scary when at the police station he was pushed into a small room with bars and locked in.\n\nEven though he didn't like it, he was finally allowed to call someone. He called his friend who was a lawyer to come and help him and to tell his family that he was okay.\n\nThis was the first time Samuel needed a lawyer because he'd done something wrong (he'd never been caught by the police before). He didn't know that his friend was better at having fun than helping people. He also didn't know that his friend was the reason he got caught because he said something he shouldn't have.\n\nPatrick, the lawyer friend, said he was trying to find out why Samuel was caught. The only thing he could find out was, \"The money people want you because of something about money from three years ago.\"\n\nScared and confused, Samuel found himself in a big room with a judge on Thursday (after a bad night in the small room with bars). The judge didn't seem to know why he was there either but had a way to make everything better. When Patrick said that Samuel should be let go, the person who wanted to keep Samuel said that he might leave the country before they could finish looking into things. So, they said Samuel couldn't go free.\n\nThe judge, who looked tired, hit his little hammer and said Samuel could go if he paid a lot of money.\n\nPatrick knew this would happen, but for Samuel, it was a big problem. He didn't have that much money, and the bank wouldn't lend it to him unless he had something to give them in return. But if he didn't get the money, he would have to stay in the small room with bars until his time to see the judge again. And since no one knew what he had done wrong, they didn't know when that would be.\n\nPatrick told Samuel that they could get the money fast. After all, the people who gave them the money would get it back when Samuel saw the judge again.\n\nThey figured out how much money they had: some from Samuel, some from his mom, who called and borrowed money from her friends and her bank in EN country, and some from Ryan, who gave his own money, not his company's, because he believed Samuel when he said he hadn't done anything wrong.\n\nBy late afternoon on a day, they were still very short on money. The money that was on its way from a faraway country and the money already collected in a place named SO were thought to be with the US clerk by night. He would let Sandy go free only when he had all the money. If, he kindly added, if the missing money were with him by noon the next day, he would tell the place where Sandy was kept, and if they got the message by early afternoon, they would do the needed work and let Sandy go free that afternoon. Then he could spend the weekend and the rest of their stay with his mom and kids.\n\nMrs. Nora, crying, called Ryan, who she had never actually met, and asked him to get Sandy out. Ryan could not give more than the big amount he had already given. \"But,\" he said slowly, \"if it's the last option you might try a man to whom Sandy sold a horse a few weeks ago. He's rich and he's from the same faraway country... he might listen to you, you never know.\"\n\nSo Mrs. Nora called Jack and told him her problems in her local English.\n\n\"Sandy told me not to bother you,\" she ended sadly. \"He was very sure when I talked to him. He says Mr. Ryan should never have suggested I ask you, but the kids have come such a long way from home, and they are scared... and I don't know what to do.\" She was so upset and confused that she could not speak, and Jack felt sorry for her, not for her son, who probably did something bad. Jack still believed in justice.\n\nHe told Mrs. Nora, \"No promises,\" but wrote down the place and phone number of Sandy's home and said he would call her back.\n\nJack sat for a while with the phone in his hand thinking about the sadness that he could help with. Then he called Ryan and asked for his opinion.\n\n\"If Sandy says he'll come back when the time comes,\" Ryan said, \"then he will. I totally trust him. What's more, his mom has borrowed money all over the place in the faraway country for that big amount of money, and there's no way he's going to run away and leave her in trouble. \"If you give money for his bail, you'll surely get it back. I wouldn't have used my own savings if I wasn't sure about it.\"\n\n\"But,\" Jack asked, \"what did he _do?\"_\n\n\"He says he didn't do anything wrong. He thinks the tax people think he's been hiding money, but he hasn't.\"\n\n\"Well ...\" Jack hesitated. \"Did he?\"\n\n\"If he says no, then he didn't.\"\n\nRyan's sureness didn't totally convince Jack, but as the computer whiz realized that the main question wasn't guilt or innocence but whether or not Sam would give up to his bail, he called his money person and asked him what he thought.\n\n\"If you want to do it, then do it,\" the money person said. \"There's no reason you shouldn't.\"\n\nIt was late in the city's Thursday afternoon offices: Jack's day-to-day lawyer had left and would be gone until Monday, unavailable for advice. Jack drummed his fingers and looked out of the window and thought of poor Mrs. Nora, and finally called her and put her worries to rest.\n\n\"Oh!\" she said, out of breath. \"Oh! Do you mean it? Do you really?\"\n\n\"You'll have to tell me what to do.\"\n\n\"Oh. Oh ...\" She slowly recovered. \"Sam's lawyer,\" she said. \"His name is Patrick. Well, he's gone to TE place.\"\n\n\"He did _what_?\"\n\n\"He had another case there. He said he had to go tonight. But he's told a sort of friend of his ... well, someone who shares office space with him ... to deal with Sam's bail.\" Her voice shook with uncertainty and doubt, a mirror reflection of Jack's own feelings. He wished sadly that he'd never bought the horse from Sam: that he'd never thought of giving his friend a horse.\n\nMrs. Nora said quickly, \"It's all right, I'm sure it is. Sam's friend says if you get to his office with a check in time for him to send it round to the District Clerk by early in the morning Sam will be freed in the afternoon.\"\n\n\"Well ... who is this friend?\"\n\n\"He's a lawyer too. His name is Cameron. He said to give you his phone number, and ask you to call him just before nine in the morning, when he will be in his office.\"\n\nJack, looking worried, wrote down the number, and felt he couldn't properly go back, much as he wanted to.\n\n\"I'll handle it, Mrs. Nora,\" he promised her. \"Do you have any money for food?\"\n\n\"Mr. William gave us some. He's been very nice,\" she said.\n\nOn a Friday morning early, Jack called the lawyer who worked with Patrick and asked him what to do next.\n\nThe colleague, Cameron, gave simple instructions without feeling: Jack should go to his bank and get ten thousand dollars on a check. Mr. Jack should then drive to his\u2014Cameron's\u2014office near the big buildings. He, Cameron, would take the check, give Mr. Jack a paper saying he got it, and send it right away to the big building where they make decisions.\n\nCameron gave clear directions to his office and said he was sure everything would be okay. Getting money for bail was very normal.\n\n\"Um,\" Jack said, \"do I make the check out to you?\"\n\n\"No, no. I'm just helping Patrick because he's not here. Have your bank make it out to him. Come as soon as you can. My office is a good hour's drive from where you are, and we need to be quick, as you know.\"\n\nWith a small sigh, Jack did everything he was told and got to a very normal lawyer's office in a building a bit away from the city center. He parked outside at a time before lunch.\n\nA busy lady at the front desk showed him into the room full of books where Cameron was. Cameron was big, had a beard and was about the same age as him, fifty.\n\nJack, feeling better, shook his hand. Cameron saw a small, thin man who didn't look very special and whose somewhat fluffy hair was turning gray; and as usual he had no trouble in leading the meeting.\n\n\"You brought the check?\" he asked, guiding Jack to a chair; and when he held the expensive piece of paper in his big hands he checked it carefully, nodding his head.\n\nHe pushed buttons on his phone and told Jack that he was right away talking to the important office in the big decision building.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said into the phone, \"the last ten thousand for Nora is here. Check, yes. I'll send it to you right away. And you do say that Nora will be let go this afternoon? Great. Thanks very much.\"\n\nHe put down the phone, asked for his helper to make a copy of the check, and wrote and signed a paper, giving it to Jack.\n\n\"What's next?\" Henry asked.\n\n\"Nothing,\" Charlotte told him. \"When Sam gives himself up, you'll get your things back. Until then ... you just wait.\"\n\nAfter the rush, Henry drove home without anything happening. Sam was let out at three o'clock. Mrs. Sam cried happy tears when he walked in through his front door, and the kids ate a lot of happy food.\n\nMrs. Sam called Henry to thank him, and after fun boat trips on the lake, Sam's family flew safely home. Sam sold more horses. The court moved on to other cases. Henry, happy with his girlfriend, only thought about his adventure when the horse Sam had sold him won again and again.\n\nThree months passed.\n\nTowards the end of that time Henry married his lovely lady and took her on a trip to FR country. While they were away Sam was called for trial.\n\nSam, helped by his friend Patrick, proved in court that the money people had made a mistake and were blaming him by mistake. The judge agreed and ended the case. As Sam had given up to his promise, the court person gave out the one hundred thousand things in his care.\n\nAnd that should have been the end of a normal event ... except that it was only the beginning.\n\nWhen Henry came back from FR country he called Ray, asking him to find him another good young horse as a wedding gift for his new wife.\n\n\"And by the way,\" Henry added, \"any news of Sam? Is his trial date set yet?\"\n\nRay told him the charges were dismissed and said that all was well. The U.S. court person had returned his\u2014Ray's\u2014things, and Henry would no doubt get his own in a few days' time, now that he was home again.\n\nThe few days passed and became three weeks. Henry wrote to Patrick, Sam's lawyer, and explained that as he was home again, he was ready to receive his ten thousand things.\n\nA week later he received not ten thousand things but a short sharp letter:\n\n_Dear Mr. Henry,_\n\n_I am not giving the ten thousand things received from the U.S. court person but made payable to me, as Sam has told me you wish me to use that sum to pay my fees for helping him._\n\n_Yours,_\n_Patrick_\n\nMild Jack positively gasped. He seldom lost his temper, but when he did it was in a cold sweat of fury, not a red-roaring rampage. He walked quickly into Ryan's office and laid the letter on his desk.\n\nRyan, not wanting to lose a top customer, but alarmed by his manner, read the page apprehensively and went pale in his turn. Sandy, summoned urgently by phone, found himself facing two upset men.\n\nHe gave the letter on the desk barely a glance and he shook with his own rage as he forestalled accusation.\n\n\"It's not true,\" he declared intensely. \"I never said that. What's more, he sent a letter like that to my mother, and I've had her on the phone ... she's _frantic._ She _borrowed_ that money. She borrowed a lot of money ... and however will she pay it back if Patrick keeps the money? She borrowed against her pension left by my dad. She borrowed from her neighbors and friends and on the security of her sister's house ... and I've yelled in Patrick's face but all he does is give me a silly grin, and he says he'll have me back in court if I make a fuss ...\"\n\n\"Could he?\" Jack interrupted. \"Could he have you back in court? And for what?\"\n\n\"Doing bad things,\" Sandy said fiercely. \"Which I didn't do. But when he tells lies, people believe him.\"\n\nPatrick felt safe in taking a lot of money from Mrs. Sandy and some money from Jack because he believed both of them to be weak foreigners who wouldn't do much beyond the first upset squawking. He could make them believe that he wouldn't be able to disprove further bad claims against Sandy if his fees weren't paid for the first case. The big guys had believed and acted on his allegations the first time and, because of its habitually suspicious outlook, he had faith it would do it again.\n\nPatrick, happy with his clever plan, used the bail money to pay off his own scary debts. He had borrowed too much at high interest rates from dangerous people, and had come very close to their debt-collection methods, but no longer now need he fear being punched in a dark alley. Not a violent man himself, he shrank from even the thought of the punch. He felt very relieved indeed to have been able to take the old people's money to get himself out of the certain of pain, and no flutter of remorse troubled his self-satisfaction.\n\nPatrick and Cameron had a plan. They knew that Samuel would send money every month to his mom to pay back what she borrowed. They thought that it would be too expensive for Samuel to get lawyers to help get his mom's money back. But, they didn't understand that the small, quiet man named Jack, whose money they took with the help of Cameron, was not as easy to defeat as they thought.\n\nCameron, a big man with a beard, thought that Jack was easy to beat because he didn't know much. Cameron then said that he deserved half of the stolen money because he told Jack to make the check payable to Patrick, not to the court clerk. After some argument, Patrick offered one thousand and they settled on two.\n\nEven though Jack didn't know much about money matters, he still believed in justice. He started looking for a smart lawyer to help him. Through some smart people, he finally met a young, energetic man named David.\n\n\"Mr. Jack,\" David said, \"even if you get your money back, which I have to tell you is doubtful, it will cost you maybe double in lawyers' fees.\"\n\n\"Your fees, do you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes, my fees. My advice to you is to forget about the loss and learn from it. It will cost you less in the end.\"\n\nJack spent some time looking at David. He had expected David to be older and bigger, like Cameron. But then he remembered that a lot of smart people, like him, had their big ideas when they were young. He had asked for the best, so he had to trust that David was the right choice.\n\nDavid spent that same time thinking about what he'd heard about Jack: that Jack was very smart. He had taken this case because he was interested in Jack's smart mind.\n\n\"Mr. David,\" Jack said, \"it isn't about the money.\"\n\n\"Is it about pride?\" David asked. He wanted to know why Jack wanted to fight this battle.\n\nJack smiled. \"Maybe because of pride. But for sure because of rules.\" He paused, then said, \"I don't know the tricky parts of the AM law. I need someone who does. I want Patrick to be sad he ever thought of taking from me, and I won't stop unless you say we can't win.\"\n\nDavid thought quietly, happily, that Patrick had taken from the wrong person.\n\nThe client and the lawyer met again a week later.\n\nDavid said, \"To stop lots of bad money from moving, there is a rule in AM that says banks and other money places must tell the tax people, whenever a lot of money is put in or taken out from a personal account in one day.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Jack nodded, \"I know.\"\n\n\"Samuel was caught because nearly three years ago he had put into his account three big amounts of money within two days. The payments were a lot of money. The case against him was let go not because there was no proof but because of notes from Ray and others that legit sales had by chance been paid to him in cash in that time. He had declared the cash as income and paid tax on it. Case then let go.\"\n\n\"End of story.\"\n\n\"Not quite.\" David smiled a little. \"The tax people had caught Samuel in the first place because of a tip from a so-called friend he had unwisely trusted. A lawyer friend who saw all sorts of ways to gain.\"\n\nJack said, \"Oh no.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" His lawyer nodded. \"Patrick got Samuel first jailed and then bailed and is, I'm told, now stirring things up to have Samuel back in jail on a charge of selling bad stuff, if he doesn't pay Patrick a lot more money for a fee. I have to say that in Patrick's sneaky plans, your money is small change.\"\n\nJack said blankly, \"What can we do?\"\n\n\"There are two ways to go.\" David was happy: he liked a good fight. \"You can take him to court for the money, and you can complain to the SC lawyer group in an effort to stop him from being a lawyer.\"\n\n\"Which do you suggest?\"\n\n\"Both.\"\n\nHearing nothing from Jack for quite some time, Patrick told himself proudly that he'd been absolutely right, the scared little guy from EN had found out it would cost him too much to fight and had given up without making trouble.\n\nPatrick, who was almost 40, had been doing work that was not very nice for many years. He wanted to be a good lawyer in big cases, but usually lost small cases in local courts. Most of his job was doing not nice things for other not nice lawyers. Getting people like Sandy was rare for him.\n\nHe was very surprised when he got a letter that said Jack was going to take him to court because he had taken his ten thousand dollars. He didn't like that another lawyer, David, wanted to ask him questions. Patrick thought that the small man should have learned his lesson and stopped trying. Patrick was going to make sure that the small man not only lost his case, but also lost a lot of money because of it.\n\nPatrick was not scared of the questions. He would promise to tell the truth and then lie from the start to the end. He had done this many times. People usually believed what was said because lying after promising to tell the truth could lead to jail.\n\nPatrick was very good at lying and avoiding questions. He told lies that sounded real for nearly two hours, and he looked like he really meant what he was saying.\n\nJack met his lawyer David for breakfast in a hotel. David liked to eat in dining rooms more than offices, because there were no bugs listening and because he was always hungry.\n\nWhile eating cereal, eggs and bacon, he talked about Patrick being nice, smooth and believable during the questions. While eating strawberries and waffles with syrup, he talked about Patrick's answer to Jack's complaint. Patrick said that Jack had told him on the phone to use the ten thousand dollars for his fees. Patrick didn't understand why Jack would want to change the agreement.\n\n\"Patrick had a lawyer with him when he was being asked questions,\" David said. \"The lawyer's name was Carl. Is he the one who told you to give your check to Patrick? Is he the one who took the check, gave you a receipt and took it to the court?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\n\"Why is it good?\" Jack asked.\n\n\"Because I can get him not to be Patrick's lawyer ... Er,\" he explained, seeing Jack's confusion, \"Carl is also a witness, right? If we go to a judge in a small room\u2014that's just a room smaller than the whole court\u2014I hope to convince him to make Patrick get a different lawyer, and _that_ will cost Mr. Patrick a lot of his own money, which I heard he doesn't have, because he has already spent the thousands he took.\"\n\n\"It seemed such a simple thing,\" Jack sighed, \"to give a little money for a bail bond.\"\n\n\"Don't be sad.\"\n\nDavid ate warm bread spread with apple jelly and watched the sad face of his friend become happy as they were joined by a lively woman who wore nice clothes as easily as overalls.\n\n\"My wife,\" Henry said, introducing her proudly. \"She thinks I was silly to listen to poor Mrs. Nora, and she's interested in Patrick.\"\n\n\"It was for your wife,\" David asked, \"that you got the young horse and met Sandy Nora?\"\n\nJack Henry nodded. David looked at them both and thought Patrick had no chance of blaming bad things onto people like this.\n\nEven though the judge agreed with David that Patrick should get a different person to defend him in court, it was still Carl who acted for him when he demanded a statement from Jack.\n\n\"I'll be sitting next to you,\" young David told his friend, \"but I'm not allowed to answer the questions. You'll do that. Remember that you've promised to tell the truth. Think before you answer. They'll be trying to trick you. Hard questions. If they confuse you, we'll lose in court.\"\n\nSo comforting, Jack thought. He and David went to the office of Carl and in a big room there Jack came face to face with Patrick for the first time. He thought he might see trickiness, but Patrick's success in the world was based on being believable.\n\nPatrick looked at Jack as a fool wasting good money and didn't understand the mind of the man he was facing. In the context of a world with wars and hunger, Jack considered the argument over a lot of money to be not important. Yet he still believed that fairness mattered, whether big or small, and he would try to the end to prove it existed.\n\nApart from the four men sitting opposite each other at one end of a long shiny table\u2014Carl and Patrick opposite Jack and David\u2014there was a woman who, on her fast typing machine, wrote down every word. There was also a video camera recording everything, so that if needed the spoken words could be matched with the video, to prove there was no cheating.\n\nJack promised to tell the truth, and did so. Carl tried to get him to admit he had agreed that, when the Clerk returned the bail money, Patrick should keep it as his payment.\n\n\"Absolutely not,\" Jack said.\n\n\"You gave the money check to Mr. Gabriel, didn't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, you told me to.\"\n\n\"Did you write on the check what it was for?\"\n\n\"You knew it was to help Sandy get out and see his family.\"\n\n\"Just answer the question,\" Cameron said. \"Did you write on the check what it was for?\"\n\n\"Well ... no.\"\n\n\"Did you write on the check that you wanted it back?\"\n\n\"No,\" Henry said. \"And why didn't you tell me to give the check to the office? Ray did that, and got his money back easily. You told me to give the check to Gabriel. If you knew this wasn't a good idea, why did you tell me to do it?\"\n\nCameron didn't answer. He said he was the one asking questions.\n\nThey talked for a long time.\n\n\"They won't want to use this talk in court,\" David said happily later. \"You sounded real.\"\n\n\"I said what's true.\"\n\n\"But people don't always believe the truth.\"\n\nThings were very slow. It was a long time since the day Henry got the horse that David called him to say that the people who could help were ready to hear him.\n\n\"My what?\" Henry asked. He was thinking about how to keep memories in small things to help people who were confused. His nice wife, happy with her horses, helped him not to walk in front of buses.\n\nDavid said, \"Three weeks from now, at night, at eight, in the hotel where we have breakfast.\"\n\n\"I thought we were going to court.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" David said. \"Remember, I told you there are two ways. One is to go to court and talk a lot, and the other is to talk to the group who can help. Your problem with Gabriel is now at the top of their list.\"\n\n\"Twisted ladder,\" Henry said.\n\n\"What? Yes, I suppose so. \"Will you come to the meeting?\" asked someone.\n\nSamuel, for the same two years, had been in and out of a place where they keep people who do wrong. Patrick, his old friend, had once again made up stories about him and got him in trouble, but this time Samuel, with his family safe in a far away land, didn't try to get out. He just waited for the day of his big talk.\n\nHe wanted to have someone else help him, not Patrick, but a person who helps for free. Even though he lost and they said he did wrong with a little bit of money from selling horses, the big bad thing about selling bad stuff didn't stick. They only said he had to stay the time he had already stayed, which meant he could leave right away. A guy named Ryan was happy to give him work again\u2014but paid him with checks, not money.\n\nAs Samuel, for his mom, had also told the people at the big meeting the same thing as David, they decided to talk about both things at the same time. Samuel's mom, as strong in her way as a guy named Jack in his, used the last bit of her money and flew over the big water again.\n\nShe met Jack for the first time in a big room in the place where the big meeting was being held. No one said who they were, but they started to talk to each other until Jack (in a gray suit) said to the old lady in her best dress, \"Are you ... er ... ?\" and she said, \"Mr. Jack, is it?\"\n\nThey talked about their problems. Samuel was sending a little bit of money to help her, even though he had to leave his nice house by the lake. She thought Patrick was a very bad guy. Jack thought about the day when he had helped her and thought he would do it again if he had to.\n\nJack's wife, who was very happy and said she wouldn't have missed the meeting for all the horses in a far away place, was nice to Samuel's mom and made her laugh, making everyone feel better. Samuel's mom got stronger. Jack's wife said, \"Good job!\"\n\nJack figured out that the people who were going to talk about the problems were already talking in a big room across the way and, when David came, he said it was true. The fourteen people who were supposed to listen to the problems had been listening to Patrick's lies for almost an hour.\n\n\"They will believe him!\" Jack said, feeling sad.\n\nDavid looked at him and then at Mrs. Nora. \"You two need to show them there is a good reason.\"\n\nJack asked again, \"What is a good reason?\"\n\n\"If the group thinks there is a good reason, they might later decide if one of their friends did something bad.\"\n\n\"Like doctors?\" Mrs. Nora asked.\n\nDavid nodded. \"Yes, like that.\"\n\nThe group asked to talk to Mrs. Nora first, alone. Jack's turn came 30 minutes later. They each walked into a big room full of light where the 14 serious people sat around a long table. The group leader, at one end of the table, asked Mrs. Nora and then Jack to sit in one of the empty chairs and answer questions.\n\nMrs. Nora sat in the middle of the table, but the leader asked Jack to sit in the only empty chair at the end, next to Patrick. Next to Patrick was a man named Carl. Jack was scared. He sat in his chair and started to answer the leader's questions, but it was hard because Patrick was so close to him.\n\nJack knew he was not doing well. The people at the table did not believe his answers and Patrick, next to him, looked happy. Carl made a noise with his nose.\n\nJack remembered David's voice. \"People don't always believe the truth.\" If they don't believe me, he thought, it's my fault.\n\nThe leader, looking at his notes on the table, asked Jack when he had told Patrick on the phone that he could keep the big money when it came back from the court.\n\nThe leader, who was big and often had a tummy ache, was bored. Half of the other people were trying not to fall asleep. Patrick was smiling.\n\nJack took a big breath and said loudly, \"I would never have agreed to pay any money for Sandy Nora.\"\n\nOne of the sleepy people opened his eyes wide and said, \"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because I didn't know him.\"\n\n\"But ...\"\n\n\"When I gave the money for his bail, I had met him only once. That was the day I bought a horse from him. A good horse, actually. A female one. \"You might want to pick her for the game tomorrow.\"\n\nSome laughter woke up the sleepy ones.\n\n\"If you didn't know Nathan\"\u2014the leader made a face\u2014\"why did you give money for his promise to return?\"\n\n\"Because of his mom's sadness. I did it for her.\" Jack motioned towards her. \"I did it because she was sad. I did it because she's from here, and so am I. You might have helped someone from here if they asked you for help in a far place. I did it because I wanted to.\"\n\nThere was a short quiet time. Then a lady in the group cleared her voice and said with a laugh, \"If you don't mind me asking you, Mr. Jack, is a lot of money a big deal to you?\"\n\nJack smiled. \"Not really. I don't ask you to make Patrick give back what he owes me because I need the money. It's because of the rule involved. It's because he is disappointing you all.\"\n\nJack took another deep breath and in the continuing quiet said, \"If I couldn't lose a lot of money, I wouldn't have helped Mrs. Nathan. But I would never have agreed to pay her son's legal costs. Why should I? I did not talk about costs with anyone, not Patrick nor Carl nor Nathan. I trusted Nathan to keep his promise, which he did. I trusted a helper to return the money he knew I'd given in trust for a promise, and he has kept it. I trusted a horse seller and I trusted a helper. Who would you have given _your_ money to, out of those two?\"\n\nThe problem-solving group talked among themselves and the next day said that they found no \"likely reason\" and that the matter was done.\n\n\"I messed up,\" Jack said sadly at breakfast later in the week.\n\n\"You did _not,\"_ David assured him. \"I've been told the group nearly all believed _you,_ not Patrick.\"\n\n\"But ... then why?\"\n\n\"They almost never kick out a fellow helper. They may know Patrick is wrong, but if there's the smallest chance of putting any question into their talks, they'll let him go. All question is reasonable, didn't you know?\"\n\nJack watched David begin to eat a lot of pancakes with bananas.\n\n\"Even so,\" Jack said, \"Patrick has gotten away with it.\"\n\nDavid put some fluffy butter on his pancakes and, having fun, waved his fork. \"Patrick,\" he said, \"has not done that.\"\n\n\"He still has my coins.\"\n\n\"I did tell you at the start that you might not get them back.\"\n\n\"Then how can you say he didn't take them?\"\n\nDavid quietly ate his pancakes. \"I know a lot. I'm told things, you know. I'm told you did well at the meeting. They say you tell the truth.\" He paused. \"They all know it is you who will be believed if Patrick goes to court.\"\n\n_\"If!\"_\n\n\"That's what I want to talk about. The way to court goes from saying someone did wrong, to telling it to a judge, and then there's a chance to solve the problem without going to court. Only if that doesn't work does it go to a trial. Well ... Patrick has agreed to try to solve it.\"\n\n\"I don't understand why you're so happy,\" Henry said.\n\n\"You will.\"\n\nThe wheels of the problem turned slowly on the road to solving it, but eventually David took his friend to a meeting with a solver who was like a wise grandma, Mrs. Nutbridge.\n\n\"Our goal,\" she said, \"is to agree on how to solve the problem between Mr. Patrick and Mr. Henry without the time or cost of a trial in court.\" She paused. \"I've talked to Mr. Patrick.\"\n\nNo one said anything.\n\n\"He is willing to talk,\" she said.\n\nDavid, being a little funny, said, \"I guess that means he's willing to avoid losing his house and car and his office things and all that he owns. He's willing to avoid big fines. He's willing not to have to pay extra. How nice of him!\"\n\n\"What can he give that you will take?\"\n\n_Oh wow,_ Henry thought suddenly, _Patrick is saying he did wrong._\n\nPatrick indeed, having to choose between getting in trouble for taking things he shouldn't and not being able to work as a lawyer\u2014between that and giving back some of what he'd taken from Henry and Mrs. Nutbridge, had suddenly found out that there were jobs to be had in the outside world, even if it meant putting things on shelves in the store.\n\nThe solver said, \"Mr. Patrick offers you five thousand coins: half of the sum you gave for the bail bond.\"\n\n\"Mr. Patrick,\" David said nicely, \"can double that. If my friend was mad, he could quadruple it.\"\n\n\"Mr. Gabriel used the bond money to pay off people who would otherwise have been mean to him.\"\n\n\"Let's all be sad,\" David said to her. \"Mr. Gabriel took Mrs. Nora's money she had saved.\"\n\nJack listened with interest.\n\n\"Sandy Nora,\" the helper said back, \"is giving back to her what she used to help him. Mrs. Nora's debts are her son's problem.\"\n\n\"Patrick Gabriel tricked Sandy Nora to the tax people,\" David pointed out seriously. \"His plan from the start was to take a lot of money in unnecessary lawyer fees from his so-called friend. Mr. Jack's big bond money came as an unexpected extra.\"\n\n\"Mr. Gabriel will give back half of Mr. Jack's money.\"\n\n\"No,\" David said calmly. \"All of it.\"\n\n\"He has no money.\"\n\n\"Mr. Jack will wait.\"\n\nFrom old wise eyes she looked with amusement at bright David; young enough to be her son, too young to feel sorry for a bad guy. She set a future date for a final decision.\n\nJack's loving wife decided that as Jack was giving her a new horse for their third anniversary she would go to Ryan herself, to the head of the helper, for advice.\n\nRyan, valuing her above all others, found her a two-year-old promising horse for the big race next year.\n\nMrs. Jack asked if there was any news of Mrs. Nora, whom she had liked at the meeting. Sandy Nora had finally saved enough to ask advice from David, Ryan told her, and now Patrick Gabriel had angrily agreed to help in her case too.\n\nMrs. Jack said to Jack before sleep, \"Even if she gets most of her money back, I don't think Mrs. Nora will help anyone like that again.\"\n\nHer husband thought of what he'd learned, and of the money he had happily paid in lawyer fees to defeat Patrick Gabriel. \"I'm told,\" he said, \"that there's a way to help people by just promising the bail money and paying in full only if the person runs away, but it's expensive. It might be better, might be worse. I'll have to ask our young helper, David.\"\n\nThey met quietly at another big table, paired as before: Patrick Gabriel and Carl opposite Jack and David.\n\nThe helper, sitting at the head of the table, gently handed out simple papers, asking them all to sign.\n\nJack's respect for fairness filled him strongly: here they all were, fighting a battle with pens, not guns. Patrick might take things from people, but he didn't hurt anyone.\n\nSadly, Patrick knew he didn't think about both Jack's hard work and David's good job with rules. The boss of the complaint team also said scary things: any bad behavior would make Patrick lose his license. But with time, Patrick thought, he would find another chance, would find another person.\n\nHe grumpily signed the paper that said he would pay back Jack in four parts of a big amount of money each.\n\nThe paper was like saying he did everything.\n\nThe people with rules ignored Patrick and didn't give him any more jobs.\n\nFor a year he worked in jobs that didn't pay much, not happy about paying Jack on time instead of going to court.\n\nFor four more years, he worked hard to pay back Mrs. Nora. He knew that punishments could have been much worse.\n\nWhen he finally didn't have any more debt, but still not honest, he moved to another place and sold tricky insurance.\n\nA man he tricked there didn't want to wait for justice like Jack, and in a dark street, he hurt Patrick badly.\n\nTHE DAY OF THE LOSERS\n\n_People go to the big race to win: riders, betters and, in this case, the police._\n\n_On a lucky day for the losers, those that think they have lost may have won, and those that win may have lost._\n\n_It depends on what they bet._\n\nAdam set off to the big race with a lot of new money in his pocket and a mix of guilt and bravery in his mind.\n\nAdam knew he had promised not to use this special bunch of money too soon. Not for five years, he had been told seriously. Five years would make everything cool down and the big robbery would be old news. The police would be chasing new bad guys and the hot serial numbers would be forgotten on old lists. In five years it would be safe to spend the small treasure he had been paid for his part in helping the robbery boss get out of unwanted jail.\n\nThat was all good, Adam told himself, looking out of the train window. But what about more expensive things? In five years' time the small treasure might not be worth the paper it was printed on. Or the color and size of the money might be changed. He'd heard about a safe opener long time ago who'd done twelve years and gone home to a stash full of the old thin white stuff. All that time for a load of old, useless junk. Adam's face showed he felt sad at the thought. It wasn't going to happen to him, he was sure of that.\n\nAdam had bought his train ticket with normal money, and same for the cans of juice, wrapped up sandwiches and a sports newspaper. The special new money was safely kept in an inside pocket, not to be used before he got to the big crowd at the AN place, a big city. He was smart, he thought happily. A neat bunch of money, clean, new and in order, might catch anyone's eye. But no one would look twice now that he had mixed them up and made them look old with hands dirtied on purpose.\n\nHe cleaned juice off his mouth with his hand: a thin man in his forties with neat, thin, gray-black hair, moving eyes and an overall look of thinking he's important. A life near bad things had given him lots of doubtful friends, a good memory of information and a good understanding of how to ask for extra money without making it too obvious. No one liked him very much, but Adam didn't notice.\n\nCloser to the front of the same train, Jack sat and felt too hot for three reasons. For one thing, he was used to being outside, and found the heat too much, and for another, because of drinks and fun, he was running out of time and might lose his job if he was late; but mostly, he was scared.\n\nJack at thirty-two had lost his courage and was trying to keep doing his job as a horse rider without anyone finding out. The old days when he used to ride with a clear mind and thought little of small hurts were long gone. For months now he had gone to the races with fear, imagining sharp pieces of bone sticking out of his skin, imagining a hurt face or a broken back ... imagining pain. For months he couldn't take risks he once didn't think were risks at all. For months he couldn't make his horses go into spaces, when only that would win, and couldn't stop himself from slowing his horses to jump, when only making them go faster would work.\n\nThe skill which had made him the best was now used to hide the problems, and the good name he had built up helped the reasons for losing he gave to horse owners and trainers. Only the most sharp-eyed saw the hidden signs of falling apart, and fewer still had said their private doubts out loud. The great BR country crowd, looking at the list of big race runners for a good pick, thought good old Jack was a plus for the third favorite, Haunted House.\n\nA year ago, he thought sadly, as he looked out at the passing fields, he would have known better than to go to a party in the big city the night before the big race. A while back, he had stayed near the track, maybe had a couple of juices, gone to bed early, slept alone. He wouldn't have thought of making a long ride south after Friday's games, or having too much juice, or going to bed late with a girl he'd just met.\n\nHe wouldn't have wanted to forget the thought of Saturday afternoon's long game, but would have looked forward to it with joy, thrill, and endless hope. Oh no, he thought sadly, what has happened to me? He was small and strong with soft brown hair, deep eyes and a nose that looked like he fell a lot. A farmer's son, good with animals, and nice manners because of doing well. People usually liked Jack, but he didn't really notice.\n\nThe crowd happily went into AN place ready with hope, belief, and money. Adam used the first of his warm money at the entrance, and happily watched it go into the box. He safely got change for another in a crowded place for drinks and for a third from a place selling game sheets. Easy money, he thought jokingly. It didn't make sense, keeping the stuff for five years.\n\nThe betting place, as always, had opened its windows early to take bets on the big game, because there wasn't time just before the game to sell tickets to everyone who wanted to buy. There were long lines already when Adam went to place his bet, for like him they knew from experience that it was best to bet early if one wanted a good view in the stands.\n\nHe waited in the line for the betting place window, writing his bet on his gamecard. When his turn came, he said, \"A hundred to win, number twelve\u2014in the game,\" and counted off the shuffled money without a worry. The busy woman behind the window gave him his ticket with a quick but sharp look. \"Next?\" she said, looking over his shoulder to the man behind. Easy peasy, thought Adam proudly, putting his ticket into his jacket pocket. One hundred on number twelve to win. No point in worrying about place money, he always said. Mind you, he was a pretty good judge of the game. He always was proud of that. Nothing in the game had a better chance than the third favorite, HH, and you couldn't want a better player than Jack, now could you? He walked happily back to the bar and bought another juice.\n\nIn the changing room, Jack had no trouble hiding his tiredness or his fear. The other players were worried with the usual game tension, finding their mouths a little dry, their thoughts a little lost, their funny talk not so much.\n\nTwice over the big jump, Jack thought, feeling hopeless; the big turn, the big chair, how am I going to face it?\n\nWhile Jack was worried, Chief Officer Cameron, the boss of the local police, was thinking about some new information he just got. He needed, he thought, to talk to the very top man at the race, if he wanted the best results.\n\nThe top man at any race, the big boss of the Jockey Club, was having a party with some important visitors in a private room when Chief Officer Cameron interrupted the lunch.\n\n\"I need to talk to you urgently, sir,\" the policeman said, bending down to the Turf's top man.\n\nSir William looked at the policeman's blue uniform.\n\n\"You're the boss here?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Can we talk in private?\"\n\n\"I guess so, if it's important.\"\n\nSir William got up, looked at his half-eaten lunch and led the policeman to a private place high in the grandstand. The two men stood in the cold air, and talked against the noise of the big crowd and the shouts of the people giving odds on the first race.\n\nCameron said, \"It's about the big bank robbery, sir.\"\n\n\"But that happened a long time ago,\" William said.\n\n\"Some of the stolen money has shown up here, today, at the race.\"\n\nWilliam frowned, he knew about the big robbery, the theft of a lot of money, and the bad guys getting away. It had been talked about more than anything else.\n\nFour men and a little boy had been hurt by the explosion, and two moms and two young policemen had been hurt later. The bad guys had come in a fire truck. Before the noise stopped, they had taken the money for \"safekeeping\" and driven away with it. They were only caught at the very last moment by a confused policeman, who was answered with a lot of bullets. Only one of the bad guys had been caught, tried and put in jail for a long time; and he had only been in jail for a few days before escaping. Catching him again, and finding his friends, was a top police job.\n\n\"This is the first clue we've had in a long time,\" Cameron said seriously. \"If we can catch whoever came here with the stolen money ...\"\n\nWilliam looked down at the many people.\n\n\"He said he thought it was impossible.\n\n\"No, sir.\" Cameron shook his head. \"A smart checker at the game saw one of the notes, and now they've found nine more. One of the sellers remembers selling a ticket for a hundred early to a man who paid in notes which felt new, even though they had been folded and wrinkled.\"\n\n\"But even so ...\"\n\n\"She remembers what he looks like, and says he only bet on one horse to win, which is unusual on big race day.\"\n\n\"Which horse?\"\n\n\"Haunted House, sir. And so, if Haunted House wins, our guy will bring his ticket with his single big bet to get his prize, and we will catch him.\"\n\n\"But,\" William objected, \"what if Haunted House doesn't win?\"\n\nCameron looked at him. \"We want you to make sure that Haunted House does win. We want you to fix the big race.\"\n\nDown in the game area, Adam gave two hot bank notes to a bookmaker who put them quickly into his bag without looking and gave a ticket to win on Spotted Tulip at eight to one in the first. In the noise and rush of the last five minutes before the first race, Adam pushed his way up the stands to find the best view of his horse, only to see it finish slow and last. Adam tore up his ticket in anger and threw the pieces into the air.\n\nIn the changing room, Jack put on his thin white pants and struggled with the buttons on his shiny red and white striped shirt. He was feeling like he wanted to run away, and the feeling was getting stronger with every passing minute. He had trouble focusing and didn't really hear when anyone spoke to him. His hands were shaking. He felt cold. He had another hour to wait before he would have to go out to the parade ring, get on the horse, go down to the start and ride around the big race course with its thirty big fences.\n\nI can't do it, he thought. I can't face it. Where can I hide?\n\nThe four people in charge of the race sat sadly around their big table, reacting with surprise and worry to what Chief Superintendent Cameron was saying.\n\n\"There's no rule for this,\" said one.\n\n\"It's impossible. There isn't time,\" said another.\n\nA third said, \"You'd never get the trainers to agree.\"\n\n\"And what about the owners?\" asked a fourth.\n\nCameron didn't like horse racing as much as he didn't like dishonest politicians and thought that catching the bad guys was more important than any horse winning. He was really mad at the stubborn reaction of the leaders, and you could hear it in his voice.\n\n\"The bad guys from BI city hurt nine people,\" he said strongly. \"Everyone should help the police catch them.\"\n\nBut not if it messes up the big race, the leaders said.\n\n\"I understand,\" Cameron said, \"that in most races, there aren't many valuable horses, and in this year's race, all the horses are boys. It's not like we're asking you to mess up the big book by fixing the big race.\"\n\n\"Still, it wouldn't be fair to the people who bet,\" said the leaders.\n\n\"The people who got hurt were the people who bet. The next people to get hurt, in the next bad bank raid, will also be the people who bet.\"\n\nSir William listened to the arguments with a calm face. He had done well in life by not sharing his thoughts until everyone else had shared theirs. His calm comments often seemed like the truth, even when they were just simple common sense. He watched Cameron and the other leaders argue and start to get angry. He sighed inside, looked at his watch and cleared his throat loudly.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said calmly and clearly. \"Before we make a decision, I think we should think about these things. First, possibility. Second, secrecy. Third, consequences.\"\n\nThe leaders and police looked at him with relief. \"Race riders,\" William said, \"are all different. Who do you think is going to convince them to fix the race?\"\n\nNo one answered.\n\n\"Who can say that the horse called HH won't fall?\"\n\nNo one answered.\n\n\"How long do you think it will be before someone tells the news? Do we want the big fuss that would follow?\"\n\nNo one answered, but a lot of shaking of leaderly heads.\n\n\"But if we say no to Chief Cameron's request, how would we feel if another bank were hurt and more innocent people were hurt, knowing we didn't do anything to stop it?\"\n\nEveryone looked at him in silence, waiting for him to lead.\n\nJack's head felt like a balloon floating somewhere above his wobbly body. The call of \"Riders out please\" had found him still unable to think of a way to escape. Too many people knew him. How could I run? he thought. How can I get to the gate and find a car when everyone knows I should be walking out to ride the horse called HH? Can I pretend to faint, he thought. Can I say I'm sick? He found himself going out with the others, his heavy legs moving on their own while his spirit felt weak. He stood in the parade ring with his mouth dry and his eyes feeling like they had sand in them, not hearing the nervous small talk of the owner and trainer before the race. \"I can't,\" he thought, \"I can't.\"\n\nThe big boss of the horse club, Mr. William, came to him as he stood still in his sad spot.\n\n\"Let's talk, Jerry,\" he said.\n\nJerry, whose new name was Jack, looked at him with empty eyes. Mr. William, who had seen that look before, felt worried. Even with Mr. Cameron's disagreement, he had the full support of the bosses. The big horse race couldn't be cheated\u2014even to catch bad guys. He realized that it was both practically and morally impossible. The police would just have to watch future races more closely, and maybe one day, they would catch the bad guy when he tried to cheat again.\n\nStill, Mr. William saw no harm in wishing Jack good luck; but he realized now that Mr. Cameron had no chance of catching his bad guy today. No horse rider in this state of fear could win the big race. The people who bet on Haunted House would be lucky if their horse lasted half a mile before he stopped or ran off or refused to jump because of the tight grip on his reins.\n\n\"Good luck,\" said Mr. William, feeling sorry.\n\nJack didn't answer, even a simple thank you was too hard for him.\n\nUp in his high spot in the stands, Austin, now called Adam, watched the long line of horses walk down the track. Ten minutes to race time, with half the people who take bets having sore throats and the crowd getting more excited. Adam, who had lost his money on Spotted Flower in the first race, and a lot more to the people who take bets in the second, was biting his fingers over Haunted House.\n\nJack sat like a bag in the saddle, shoulders hunched. The horse, feeling his rider's mood, walked slowly, not sure if he should react to the crowd or not. To Adam and many others, the horse and rider looked like they would lose. Mr. William shook his head sadly and Mr. Cameron wondered why that one horse, out of all of them, looked half asleep.\n\nJack got himself ready for the start by blocking out every thought. The fear was full and trying to overflow. Jack, pale and sweaty, knew that in a few more minutes he would have to get off the horse and run. Have to.\n\nWhen the race started, Haunted House was standing still. Getting no signal from the saddle, he started slowly after the other horses. The horse knew his job\u2014he was there to run and jump and get ahead of the rest. But he was feeling lost, without the help and direction he was used to. His rider stayed on him by habit, his years of training helping him, his trained body moving in a way that didn't need thinking. \n\nHaunted House jumped last over the first fence and was still last five fences later near a big jump. Jack saw the horse in front of him fall and knew that if he kept going straight he would land on him. Almost without thinking, he moved his right hand on the rope and Haunted House, feeling this tiny sign, moved a little, gathered his strength and jumped over the danger. Haunted House knew the track, had won there with Jack before, in shorter races. His sudden jump over the big one melted his rider's fear and made him scared again.\n\nOh no! Jack thought, as Haunted House took him towards the Canal Turn, how can I? How can I? He sat there, fighting his fear while Haunted House carried him safely round the Turn and over Valentine's and all the way to the Chair. Jack thought forever after that he'd closed his eyes as his horse took the last few steps towards the most scary jump in the world, but Haunted House did it perfectly and cleared the huge jump without any stumble. Over the water jump in front of the stands and out again towards the big jump with the whole track to jump again. Jack thought, If I stop now, I've done enough. Horses beside him got tired and stopped or slipped and fell but Haunted House ran at a steady speed with little care for what would happen.\n\nAdam on the stands and William in his private box and Officer Charlie watching on a TV all watched with faster heartbeats as Haunted House moved through the field. By the time he reached the big jump on the second round he was tenth, and seventh at the Canal Turn, and fifth after the third last fence, a mile from home.\n\nJack saw a gap on the rails and didn't take it. He slowed his horse before the second-last fence so they jumped it safely but lost two lengths. On the stands William groaned aloud but on Haunted House Jack just felt very scared at his own fear. It's no use, he thought. I'd be better off not here.\n\nThe leader of the race had sprinted a long way ahead and Jack saw him ride over the last fence while Haunted House was a good distance behind. One more, Jack thought. Only one more fence. I'll never ride another race. Never. He closed his mouth tight as Haunted House gathered his strength and jumped at the green-faced fence. If he rolls on me, Jack thought.... If I fall and he falls on top of me ... Oh God, he thought, help me jump over this fence safely.\n\nThe horse named HH landed safely, its rider balanced by natural skill. The last fence was behind them, all jumps done.\n\nThe horse leading far ahead, very fast and carrying a lot, ran the last flat half-mile very quickly. Jerry and HH had started too late to try to catch up, but with a burst of energy, they raced past everything else to the finish line.\n\nAdam watched HH finish second by a long distance. A little upset for not caring about second place, he took out his ticket, tore it in half, and let the pieces fly away. William wondered if Jerry could have won if he had tried earlier. The police officer was upset about the long distance that his target would escape.\n\nSir William took his special guests down to watch the happy scenes around the winner in the off-saddle area, and was met by worried officials with shocked faces.\n\n\"The winner can't pass the weight check,\" they said.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" William asked.\n\n\"The winner didn't carry the right weight! The trainer left the weight-cloth in the saddle box when he put the saddle on the horse. The winner ran all the way with much less weight than he should have ... and we'll have to disqualify him.\"\n\nForgetting the weight-cloth was a common mistake; but in the big race!\n\nWilliam took a deep breath and told the shocked officials to tell the public over the loudspeakers. Jerry heard the news while he was sitting on the weight check and watching the pointer move to the right mark. He understood that he'd _won_ the big race; and he felt not happy but very ashamed, as if he had cheated.\n\nThe police officer placed his men carefully and alerted all the betting payout windows. Up on the stands, Adam searched for the pieces of his ticket in anger, picking up every torn and stepped-on piece and looking at it anxiously.\n\nThe ground was covered with torn-up paper. The bright colors of the betting tickets made it hard to find the ones from the bets, and there was also the mess from the other races. Somewhere there was his torn ticket from the horse ST, for instance. Tearing up losing tickets and letting them fly away was a way gamblers showed they didn't care about losing.\n\nAdam was looking and looking until his back hurt from bending down. He was not the only one who had not followed the rule of not throwing tickets away until after the game was over, but seeing others looking as hard as he was did not make him happy. What if someone else found his pieces of ticket and took his prize? The thought made him very angry; and what was more, he couldn't stay at the game place forever because he had to catch his train back. He couldn't be late; he had to work that night.\n\nCameron's friends were moving around as time went by and they were left there while the crowd got smaller and smaller and went out through the gates. When the game place closed for the day, the big boss told them to stop in an angry way and said that they would have to wait for another chance, and such a good one would not come again.\n\nIn the room, Jack got all the good words as best he could and told the surprised people on TV that he would stop doing his job after this big win.\n\nHe didn't know he had done the bravest thing in his life. When the good words were over he locked himself in the bathroom and cried for his lost bravery.\n\nAdam traveled home with nothing and in a bad mood, not knowing that his lost ticket had saved him from being caught. He said bad words to his wife and kicked the cat, and after a quick dinner, he put on his neat blue clothes. Then he went to work his usual night job in the nearby big building.\n\nChristopher's END\n\nWhat if? _is the beginning of a story._   \n_What if Christopher ended when he shouldn't?_   \n_There could be a hundred things happening at once,_   \n_but anyway, here there are three._\n\nNot knowing that it was for the last time, Cameron moved his small electric shaver over his face and watched it in the bathroom mirror.\n\nCameron's beard grew strong and black; he thought it was not fair, when his hair was getting less and less. Sighing, he made the line between beard and hair beside each ear straight, and blew the cut-off ends of whiskers carefully into a small bag always ready for it.\n\nAs he got older and a little fat, Cameron had started at forty-two to wish that he had done more fun things, had crazily tried to fly around the world in a balloon or spent a summer taking pictures of penguins in a far away cold place or had gone up a big river to the big falls. Instead he had worked every day as a person who helps animals eat better, and as the biggest thing he had done, acted as the judge at races.\n\nOn a certain Friday morning, Chris looked forward to the busy first day of the two-day WI city Spring Meeting. He enjoyed his ride to the WI city racetrack from his home (which felt empty now that his wife had left with a TV repairman), enjoying the sunshine on the new green leaves of the trees. Happy enough without his wife (actually, relieved), he wondered about dog-sledding in AL place or driving across the vast red-dust lands of AU country: could a travel agent arrange it?\n\nBeing careful by nature, he packed imaginary bags for his dream trips, wondering if snowshoes would work on both types of snow, and choosing audio books for the long nights. Dreams filled the empty spaces of his busy life.\n\nHe was one of the fifteen judges called to decide the winner and placed horses of the races. As there were fifteen judges but not fifteen race-meetings every day (there were rarely more than four except for public holidays), being a judge was to Chris a sometimes and unpredictable fun more than a job. He never knew long in advance to which meeting he might be sent: none of the judges always worked on the same track.\n\nChris missed the old days when the judge's word was law: if the judge said someone had won the race, then he had won it, even if half the racegoers put another horse in front. Nowadays the photo-finish camera gave clear short-head results, which the judge just announced. Fairer, Chris thought, but not as fun.\n\nThe photo-finish camera at WI city races had been broken last time, though the problem (more officially called a malfunction) had happened to another judge, not Chris; and it had now reportedly been not only fixed but thoroughly tested. A pity, Chris thought.\n\nChris parked his car (for the last time) in the \"Only for Officials\" parking lot and walked happily towards the weighing room (the place where the officials worked), saying \"good mornings\" to gatekeepers and arriving riders as he passed.\n\nThe judge was feeling good that day. He felt the newness of the year in himself and, as often before, but more strongly this time, decided that as he could realistically expect thirty more years of life, he should change direction soon. The feeling was clear: the destination, still unclear. He would have been surprised to learn that it was already too late.\n\nChris was greeted as always with a smile by the people in charge, the person who ran the course, the starter, the person who checked the weights and all the passing crowd of race organizers in the weighing room. The judge was popular, not only because he did his job without mistakes, but for his natural kindness, his good nature and his calmness in a problem. Some people thought he was boring, but they didn't know his exciting thoughts. What if, he thought, I joined a group that put out big fires?\n\nBefore each race, the judge sat near the weighing area and learned the colors each rider was wearing. He also learned the name of each horse and made sure the riders had the right numbers. Cameron, after years of practice, was good and quick.\n\nThe first three races were easy. There were no close finishes to decide by photo, and he could confidently say who won. He was having fun.\n\nThe fourth race, the big race of the day, required Cameron to quickly recognize all eleven runners: it was very bad if a judge hesitated.\n\nNumber 1, he noted: Lily.\n\nNumber 2, Fairy tale.\n\nNumber 3, Big Storm.\n\nHe kept going down the list. He knew all the runners' names from other days, but he didn't know how important the first three runners in the big race would become.\n\n_NUMBER 1. LILY_\n\nEarlier that Friday morning, when Cameron was getting ready and dreaming his dreams, Wendy sat in front of her mirror. She didn't see her light skin, her brown hair or her blue-gray eyes; she only saw worry and a problem she didn't understand and couldn't solve. An hour ago, she thought, life was simple and safe.\n\nThere were four kids upstairs with a nurse: three girls and a baby boy. Downstairs, there was a cook, a housekeeper, a helper, and in the house by the gate, a driver-gardener with his wife and daughter. Wendy managed her big team with friendliness so that they all lived together happily. She knew exactly what she could ask from each person, and what would be considered too much.\n\nThe house was big and old: it was comfortable for everyone but had a problem that couldn't be fixed. One day soon, she thought peacefully, she would move everyone to a new home.\n\nShe had a lot of money when she got married, and like her mother, she had given it to her husband to take care of.\n\nAt thirty-seven she was calm, even if not overwhelmingly happy. She could admit to herself (but to no one else) that Jack, her husband, had not been always faithful since they got married. But she depended on him as a friend, so she chose to ignore why he sometimes didn't come home for a night but came back very happy, giving her flowers and small gifts. When he came home in the morning with nothing, it usually meant that he had been playing games all night in his favorite place. He was a nice but not very helpful man, and most people liked him.\n\nEarly in the morning on a Friday, while she was still in bed thinking about her day, Wendy got a call from the family's money helper who urgently wanted to talk to Jack.\n\nJack's side of the big bed was empty, but he often slept in the next room when he came home late, so his wife went to wake him without worry.\n\nThe bed in the next room was made neatly; no Jack.\n\n\"He isn't here,\" his wife said, going back to the phone. \"He didn't come home last night. You know how he is when he's playing games. He'll play all night.\" She made light of his not being there like she always did. \"When he gets home, do you want me to give him a message?\"\n\nThe money helper asked softly, already knowing the answer, if Wendy had read the money news in the papers today. No, Wendy had not.\n\nWorried by then, Wendy wanted to know what was wrong and wished she hadn't asked when she heard the answer.\n\n\"Basically,\" the money helper said sadly, \"the firm that was looking after your money has run out of money, which means ... it's hard to say this ... but it means that Jack's money\u2014and some other people's money\u2014is, how shall we put it, in big trouble.\"\n\nWendy asked quietly, \"What does 'in big trouble' mean, exactly?\"\n\n\"It means that the person who Jack and others trusted with their money used all their money for a project and ... well ... lost it.\"\n\n\"That can't happen!\" Wendy said.\n\n\"I did warn him,\" the money helper said sadly, \"but Jack trusted the manager and signed papers giving him too much power.\"\n\n\"But there's my money,\" Wendy said. \"Even if Jack has lost some of his, we can live on my money just fine.\"\n\nAfter a scary pause, the bad news left her speechless.\n\n\"Mrs. Wendy .\"Wendy, you let Jack control all your things. Maybe you gave him too much power. Your money is gone with his. I hope we can save enough for you to live okay, but not as you do now. There are things for the kids, things like that. I need to talk to him about what he's going to do.\"\n\nWhen she could speak, Wendy asked, \"Does Jack know about this?\"\n\n\"He found out yesterday, when the news came out in the city. He is a good man. I'm told he's been trying to find money, to pay off his debts from games. I know, for example, that he's trying to sell his racehorse, Lily.\"\n\n\"Lily! He wouldn't do that! He loves that horse. She races today at WI place.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid... in the future Jack won't be able to keep racehorses.\"\n\nWendy couldn't bear to ask what else he wouldn't be able to have.\n\nJack had already been told. Like many before who lost a lot of money because of something they didn't do, he didn't understand why, or how much, he had lost.\n\nHe wasn't dumb, though not very smart either. He had a lot of money, but didn't know how to use it for business. He had left \"all that\" to the trusted man at SP place, which led to a meeting of others in the same situation. Women were angry and crying: men were shouting or quiet. Jack felt sick.\n\nJack tried to do the right thing, even when everything was going wrong. He paid the people he owed money to, like his clothes maker and his wine seller, and his pipe fixer (not all the money, but enough to show he wanted to pay). He could pay for his home for one more month if he told all the helpers at home they had to leave. That left the big debts to the people he bet games with, who would be very upset when they heard the bad news.\n\nThe only thing he had that was worth a lot, he thought sadly, was his fast horse, Lily. His other three horses were old now, and not worth much.\n\nBy midnight Thursday he had lost a lot of money at the games, trying to win his way out of trouble. At four o'clock in the morning, having won back some of his losses, he made deals with the people he owed money to about Lily that even they thought were not good. They knew by then about his very tough times. They took his signature seriously and, because they liked him, they really hoped things would get better for him.\n\n_STORY 2. TALE._\n\nOn a Friday morning, while Cameron was getting ready for the day, two brothers, Adam and Alex, were in their yard working on Tale, their horse, far away in the north.\n\nAs the morning got brighter, they neatly made the horse's mane into braids and brushed his tail, tying it tightly so it would look clean and nice. They put oil on his hooves (which looked good) and gave him some oats to eat so he would have energy and keep warm on the trip.\n\nAdam, who was a rider, and his older brother Alex, who trained the horse, said hello to the person who came to change Tale's regular horseshoes to thin ones for running fast. This person was careful that his nails didn't hurt the hooves: Adam and Alex were known for playing tricks if they got upset.\n\nThe brothers, Adam and Alex, were not very honest: everyone knew it, but no one could prove it. Tale had gotten to Number 2 in the race by winning and losing in a way that was as hard to follow as a ghost's steps. Both brothers had been asked to explain \"strange things in running.\" Both, with innocent faces, had said that horses are not machines. Because people were suspicious but not sure, Alex had been made to pay money and Adam had been told to take a short break. Both had said in public that they were upset and in private that they were happy. The people in charge wanted to catch them and tell them off.\n\nThe horse's owner\u2014a cousin of Adam and Alex\u2014had made things more confusing by always betting the same amount of money on his horse, whether he won or lost. The horse's owner had asked the rider and trainer not to tell him what was going to happen so that he would really feel happy or sad.\n\nOver the years, mostly with horses that were not as good as Tale, the three of them who planned together\u2014the owner, the trainer and the rider\u2014had made a lot of money that they didn't have to pay taxes on.\n\nOn the day of the big race, they still didn't know what to do. They hadn't decided whether Tale was going to try to win or lose. They didn't think he was fast enough to ever beat Lily, but\u2014annoyingly\u2014no one had paid them to let him try. It seemed to Adam and Alex that Tale would have to do his best and try to get second or third place.\n\nThis kind of honesty was not like Adam and Alex at all.\n\nOn a Friday morning, two hours before Cameron started getting ready with full focus for the spring event in WI city, Matthew quietly left the young woman he was with and turned off his noisy alarm clock.\n\nMatthew's head hurt from too much fun the night before, his mouth felt dry. Matthew, a horse rider, had to perform at his best that afternoon at the WI city racecourse in two short races and one long race; but the person he rode for\u2014Jack\u2014wanted him to show up for morning practice at least clear enough to sit straight on his horse.\n\nFriday was training day, meaning horses ran fast to strengthen their muscles. Experienced riders like Matthew, fit as a cat and twenty-four years old, could ride half asleep. That Friday, he looked at himself in his own bathroom mirror as he tried to freshen up with a toothbrush and tried to smile like the one that had made a young woman come to his house when she should have been safe in her own house on the other side of the racing town of LA city.\n\nSarah; now _there_ was a girl. There was Sarah, definitely in his bed. Also, he hadn't spent the few hours of his night just sleeping. What a shame, he thought, that he could remember so little of it clearly.\n\nWhen he'd put on his riding clothes and made a pot of strong coffee, Sarah was up, dressed and saying, \"Tell me I didn't do this. My father will be mad. How do I get home without being seen?\"\n\nThe curious eyes of LA city woke up with the sunrise. By the evening, everyone was talking. Sarah, daughter of the top horse trainer, did _not_ want people to know about her unplanned adventure with the charming horse rider who rode for Jack, her father's biggest competitor.\n\nAwake and grinning at the problem, Matthew gave her the keys to his car with instructions not to leave until the horses had left for the training grounds. He told her where to leave the car and where to hide the key, and he himself ran on foot through the town to Jack's stable, which didn't help his headache.\n\nSarah! He thought with a laugh.\n\nIt had all happened because of a birthday party they had both gone to the night before at The Deer, one of the best places in LA city area. It was mainly because of the fun atmosphere and specifically because of the last round of drinks ordered by the host, that had mixed badly with the earlier drinks.\n\n_Milk Shakes._\n\nNever again, Matthew decided. He seldom had too much sugar and didn't like feeling sick. He remembered offering Sarah a ride home, but couldn't remember how they ended at _his_ house, far away from The Stag, and not hers, which was closer. Because he had too much sugar, Sarah had been driving.\n\nMatthew, though a top horse rider, wouldn't normally have thought of Sarah as someone to hug and kiss, mostly because of her dad's influence and strength. Percy's well-known rules about who his smart nineteen-year-old daughter could spend time with didn't include anyone who might want to marry her to get his horses. He had already scared away a lot of boys, and his daughter, who was smart, used his rules as a shield against anyone she didn't like. Which made Matthew wonder, which made him wonder, how come the pretty Miss Sarah, the chosen Miss of the town, had come up his stairs without saying no?\n\nJack watched the pain in each step of his rider's arrival but just shrugged. The fast horse runs were done to his liking (which was all that mattered) and he offered a breakfast to plan for his Winchester runners.\n\nAt a little after breakfast time, while Wendy, far away, still sat in shock on her stool, Jack, big and bossy, told his rider that Storm Cone was to win the fourth race\u2014the Church Race\u2014at all costs. Matthew must somehow make it happen.\n\nJack had been doing his math, and the prize of the Church Race would put him in the leading spot on the list of trainers who won the most. The big prizes were few at that time of year, as the main part of the horse riding season was over: the very last was on the next day, Saturday, but Percy had no suitable horses. With luck Jack could win the Church Race and stay ahead of Percy for the few weeks that were left.\n\nJack _really wanted_ to be the top trainer, and to show up Percy.\n\n\"Find a way,\" he told his rider, \"of beating that horse Lilyglit. He must have a weakness somewhere.\"\n\nMatthew knew all about Lilyglit, having followed the bright horse twice past the winning post before. He doubted that Storm Cone would ever beat Lilyglit, but was too polite to say so. He ate dry toast to stay light and let Jack's hopeful thinking go over his head.\n\nSophia drove Matthew's car back to park it outside the big building, as he'd asked, and hid its key in a secret box.\n\nSince it was day, she took the short way home across the fields that she was scared of at night, and was sitting in the kitchen, clean, changed and eating breakfast when her dad came back from seeing his horses run.\n\nPatrick, her dad, taking off his jacket and helmet, just asked if she'd had fun at the birthday party.\n\n\"Yes, thank you,\" she answered. \"Matthew very kindly drove me home.\"\n\nHer dad looked worried. \"Don't be too friendly with him.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nShe thought about a fun drink she had. A bit of salt, a sip of a strong drink, and a piece of lime. She had felt free. Being with Matthew had become fun and just a \"why not?\" thing to do. She looked inside herself for feeling bad and only found a smile.\n\nPatrick talked a lot about a horse. \"The silly owner wants to sell him. I've told him he needs to keep him safe, but he keeps not doing it. Why don't very rich people keep things safe? He says that people will want to steal the horse. Jasper, nice enough, but silly. You've met him a lot, of course. I told him the horse can be a champion, given another year. I can't think what's got into the man. He sounded scared on the phone yesterday, telling me to find someone to buy the horse right away. At least wait until after he wins the big race, I said, but he's scared of another horse, with better chances in the race. He seemed to think I could tell the other horse's rider something. No way. I told him to try it himself.\"\n\nHis daughter looked surprised over her breakfast. If Matthew did something bad, she was done with him, she thought.\n\nMatthew, like many other riders, stayed fit by running a lot, and many, also, left their cars outside at night so they wouldn't drive after drinking, so no one cared when Matthew ran to the big building, got his keys from the secret box and drove himself home.\n\nWhen he got home, the phone started ringing: he picked it up hoping the call would be quick. He felt cold, the warm run ending. He wanted a hot shower and to sit in a warm big sweater while he drank more coffee and read the papers.\n\nA quick, nervous voice said to him, \"I want to talk to Ryan. It's Benjamin here. Jack ... er ... Benjamin. I own a horse named Lily ... er ... do you know what I mean?\"\n\nRyan knew very well. He said he was Ryan.\n\n\"Yes. Well ... er ... I'm selling my horse.\" Benjamin took a deep breath and tried to speak more slowly. \"I've arranged a sale ... for a good price of course ... really a good sale ...\"\n\nRyan said shortly, \"Good job.\"\n\n\"Yes, but, well, do you see, it's a _special_ sale.\"\n\n\"Hmm?\" Ryan murmured. \"Special _how?\"_\n\n\"Well ... actually, special if he wins this afternoon. Wins the big race, to be exact ...\"\n\n\"I see,\" Ryan said calmly, and indeed he did understand.\n\n\"Yes ... Well, Patrick didn't want to talk to you about this, but ...\" he spoke faster, \"this is not a bad thing I'm offering you, not at all. I wouldn't do that, absolutely not.\"\n\n\"No,\" Ryan said.\n\n\"What I'm offering, do you see,\" Jack continued, trying to get to the point, \"is something like a _reward._ If my horse Lily wins the big race, I can finalize the sale on better terms, and ..._ If my horse Lily wins the big race, I can finalize the sale on better terms, and . well, if you and your horse could have helped in any way, then you would have earned a reward, don't you see?\"\n\nWhat I see, Ryan thought to himself, is a quick way to get in trouble. To Jack he replied reassuringly, \"Your horse Lily is good enough to win without help.\"\n\n\"But think of the challenge. It changes everything. And last time Lily only beat my horse by a little bit ...\" The voice rose in worry.\n\n\"Mr. Benjamin,\" Ryan said patiently, feeling a bit cold, \"there are eleven horses in the race. It could be anybody's race because of the challenge, and if my horse gets to the front, I won't stop him.\"\n\n\"Are you saying you won't help me?\"\n\n\"I'm saying good luck.\"\n\nThe phone stopped working suddenly. Jack, thought Matthew, as he walked towards the shower, was one of the last people he'd thought would try to win by tricks.\n\nMatthew didn't know about the boss at a big company.\n\nJack sat next to the phone, looking at the carpet of a small hotel room next to his club. The agreement he had made with his bookie and the club owners didn't seem so great now, but he had to admit that they'd been fair. He'd realized too late, though, that Lily had to win the big race for him to have enough to keep his head up. If Lily won, the prize would help pay his debts. Lily's worth would go up and selling her would leave some extra. If Lily lost, the money from selling her would be eaten up by debt. If he lost the race he would be worth less than he would get at that moment. The person who owned Lily agreed that her value should go down a little with every step she was behind.\n\nJack thought betting on Lily to win was a way out, but his bookie had said no to more debt.\n\nJack made a list of other things he could sell, none of which were old things or pictures. He and Wendy had always lived around special things that would belong to the next generation. Even his old house, falling apart, belonged to his son and his son and his son, forever.\n\nJack, until that day, would never have tried to bribe someone. He was only a little aware of how nicely Matthew said no, and he could only think about his own sadness.\n\nHe read again the newspaper's thoughts on the big race that was in front of him on his breakfast tray.\n\n_No. 1. Lily. Likely to win, needs to fight hard._\n\n_No. 2. Story. In the good strong hands of Arthur, will he or won't he be able to come and join the fun? No. 3. Storm. Rider, Matthew. They'll try hard, and the weights are in their favor, but can they finish fast?_\n\nJack felt nervous and called a friend who could help him talk to the Arthurs. He then talked to Victor Arthur, who listened without excitement.\n\nJack found it easier, the second time, to offer a \"prize.\" He almost believed in it himself.\n\n\"What you want me to do,\" Victor said, making things clear, \"is to stop Stormy from beating Lily.\"\n\n\"Er ...\"\n\n\"And I don't get anything unless Lily wins and I've in some way helped to make that happen. Is that right?\"\n\n\"Er ... yes.\"\n\nVictor sighed. It wasn't much of a plan, but the only one they'd been offered.\n\n\"OK,\" he said, \"I'll do it. But if you don't keep your promise, I'll tell the judges.\"\n\nJack wasn't used to threats. Victor's straightforwardness forced him to understand how far he'd gone towards being dishonest. He felt bad and upset. He didn't change his mind.\n\nHe called Patrick and asked him to place a big bet for him on Lily to win. Patrick, who had done this before, agreed without arguing and called his own bookie, who accepted the bet.\n\nCameron, sitting at his table in the weighing room, smiled at each jockey as he checked colors and number cloth.\n\nLily, the favorite, was to be ridden as usual by the longtime champion jockey: married, three kids, a face well known to the public. Trainer Patrick stood by, ready in case of trouble.\n\nNext on the judge's list came Victor, partner of Fairy. Victor, though a bad guy from head to toe, still made Cameron smile, who tried to keep his smile small. The judges in Cameron's hearing had promised to watch Fairy every step of the way in the race with sharp cameras, trying to catch him doing something wrong. Cameron thought of warning the jockey but, looking at Victor's cheeky confidence, thought he probably knew.\n\nStormy's jockey next. Moggie the cat, very good at moving, smart, liked by good-looking women and quite likely to be a future star for the sport.\n\nWhen he'd learned and checked off all the riders, Cameron stood in the parade ring for a final check and watched the jockeys go out to race; watched them\u2014young, thin and not afraid\u2014and wished he could be them. What if, he thought, what if I'd gone to a racing stable at sixteen, instead of school and university? What if it's still not too late to learn to do tricks in the air? To try walking on wings?\n\nBut it was already too late for both of them.\n\nThe big chair at the horse race in WI city was in the main part of the big stand, one level above the room for the leaders and (of course) right in line with the finish line.\n\nAt some races, especially small ones in the country, the big chair was on the grass, marking the finish line itself, but Cameron liked being high up in places like WI city, where he could look down at the track and see the fast horses more easily.\n\nHe climbed to his spot for the big hurdle race and put his notes on the shelf by the window that was there for that. He had a tool to see far away for watching the far parts of the long track and a helper whose job was to say \"Picture, picture\" over the loudspeaker if Cameron told him to: and Cameron told him to whenever the first horses finished really close to each other. The finish-line camera at WI city was operated by helpers in a room above the big chair.\n\nCameron counted the horses as they walked to the start: eleven, all correct. Through his tool to see far away he watched the horses circle and line up for the start. There were no boxes in jump racing, and no draw. Lily lined up on the inside rail and, when the starting ropes flew up, was easily first and fast away.\n\nPatrick with Sophia beside him watched Lily from the stands. Neither Jack nor Wendy had found enough bravery to come to the horse race. Patrick hoped Matthew would be as honest as people said: his daughter promised it.\n\nWendy sat at home in front of the TV in her small private room with her hands clenched, her hair messy and tears on her cheeks. Jack hadn't called her and she didn't know where he was. She had tried the bookmakers, the club and the hotel. She had tried the phone in his car. Jack had left no messages anywhere and his wife was becoming afraid.\n\nLily, always a fast horse, jumped over the first few hurdles like a fast animal running from a lion. Storm was fifth, with Fable behind him.\n\nOn the stands the Adams\u2014trainer and owner-cousin\u2014happily watched young Victor start in Matthew's shadow with the secret plan to end Storm's chances by flipping his rider over the rails. With Storm out of the way, Lily had the best chance to win. Victor had no plan to let anything else get in Lily's way\u2014except that if Fable himself should fly unexpectedly ... well then ..... well then . liking the prize began at home.\n\nStorm Cone's owner, and Jack, his trainer, stood on the balcony of the owner's private box up high, with no one to block their view. The owner, almost as rich as Jack had been a few days earlier, had been trying for several years to be the top owner, but he, like many before him, had found that if money can't buy love, neither can it make you win the big horse race.\n\nJack had used all his skill to prepare Storm Cone for this test with everything working well. If Matthew gave away an unneeded inch, and he, Jack, lost his best and maybe only chance of being the top trainer, he thought he would probably be very angry.\n\nDown on the grass feelings were simpler. To the champion rider, comfortable on his regular partner, Lily, it was just another race, which he would win if all went well. He liked being in front. Lily jumped the hurdles cleanly.\n\nTo Matthew also, it was just another race, though he would try hard to give Jack his championship if Lily blinked. Storm Cone sent energy and good feeling through the reins, the best signs for his rider.\n\nThe eleven horses ran past the stands first time round, and turned around the top bend to start on the last mile. Christopher watched them, counted them, checked that Lily still led on the inside.\n\nIt was on the turn at the top of the long bend, where the horses were backside-on to the judges and half hidden by white rails, that Victor put his hand under Matthew's boot and pushed upwards with all his strength.\n\nMatthew, greatly unbalanced, felt his foot come out of the stirrup as his head swung over the horse's neck and down towards the thundering shoulder and the ground below. Matthew's fingers locked in the horse's mane. His weight was all on one side of the big creature running beneath him. He had dropped his whip. _There was a row of hurdles ahead, as soon as one cleared the turn._\n\nVictor couldn't believe that Matthew was still technically on the horse, even though clinging there with his fingernails and with his balance off sideways. Matthew let Storm Cone adjust as well as possible to jump the hurdle ahead, and accepted that he would probably be thrown off into the path of the other big horses, all trying to keep their positions at thirty miles an hour.\n\nHe later told that he was really scared of falling among the horses' feet that made him cling onto Storm Cone's neck, trying really hard not to get stepped on. It was just a few steps before he reached the dangerous wooden jumps ahead, a hand reached down, grabbed his bright shirt, and pulled him up.\n\nMatthew, who helped him, was with one of the other runners. He said later, \"You'd have done it for me, buddy\". What he did then gave Matthew precious time to grab the saddle, get on Storm Cone and balance before his horse jumped over the dangerous hurdles as if it was flying.\n\nMatthew had no hands on the reins nor feet in the stirrups, but he still wanted to win. Storm Cone was maybe ten lengths behind Lily, but both the horse and Matthew, not ready to give up, sped down the backstretch. Matthew gathered the reins, the horse thankful for the control. Around the final bend they raced into clear second place, with only Lily still there to beat.\n\nVictor was really angry, seeing no hope of catching Storm Cone again for another try. Up in the judges' box the three men there were really happy. They had all seen Victor's attack on Matthew, whether he was on the horse or not. The camera would have recorded it, and it doesn't lie. This time, _this time,_ they had caught Victor doing something really bad, and they would have another meeting, and this time kick the bad guy _out._\n\nCameron, one level above them, was amazed that Matthew, without his feet in the stirrups, was still on the horse at all, even though, with Lily far ahead coming to the final hurdle, he had no hope of winning. Tired, indeed, Storm Cone would find it hard, Cameron thought from his long judging experience, to hold on to finish second. Two horses he had passed were catching up again.\n\nThat clear thought was Cameron's last clear thought.\n\nHe saw Lily approach the final hurdles. He saw the horse make a mistake in jumping too early to reach the other side without stumbling. He saw Lily's nose go down in the classic way of fallers ... and before Lily had fallen to the ground at high speed, his own heart had stopped.\n\nThe helper of the judge did not know much about helping sick people and was not quick to think. When Cameron fell down next to him, the helper was scared and did not know what to do.\n\nHe heard Cameron's head hit the floor and he heard him stop breathing. He saw Cameron's face turn a weird color and then go white. He tried to help Cameron by loosening his tie and calling his name.\n\nCameron's eyes were a little bit open, but he and his scared helper did not see the end of the race. No one said who won the race over the loudspeaker.\n\nOne of the race helpers ran up the stairs to the judge's box to ask why it was so quiet. When he saw Cameron's still body, he could not speak. He knew that Cameron was gone forever. After making sure Cameron was really gone, he sent the helper to get the doctor and went downstairs to tell the others the sad news.\n\n\"We, as race helpers,\" he told the others, \"will have to figure out who won from the picture of the finish. As you know, it's in the rules.\" He asked for a picture of the moment when the horses crossed the finish line, saying he needed it quickly.\n\nA worker came fast, but he was red in the face and did not have the picture. He was very sorry and explained that the old problem with the camera had come back, and it had stopped working when the horse named Lily was in front, before the last jump, two parts of the race from the end.\n\nThe race helpers, shocked, were told by the race official\u2014the person who knows all the race rules\u2014that if the judge is not there (and Cameron, being gone forever, could be counted as not there) and if there is no picture of the finish (the camera having stopped working) the race helpers themselves could say who had won.\n\nThe race helpers looked at each other. One of them was sure Storm Cone had won by a little bit. One thought Moggie Reilly had gotten tired and let Storm Cone get behind in the last two steps. One of them had been looking down the track to see if the horse named Lily had hurt himself.\n\nNot knowing what to do, they said over the speaker that there would be a race helper's meeting.\n\nThe place where people bet on the race, not knowing who had won, did not give any money to anyone. People were shouting about what might happen but they didn't guess right. People with microphones were running around.\n\nCameras, high up near the roof, showed a blurry tie.\n\nThe two other riders thought that the horse, Storm, had won by a little bit, but no one asked their opinion.\n\nMatthew had ridden most of the race without his feet in the foot holders (like Tim once did in a big race). He'd sat on Storm's neck and squeezed with his legs and kept his balance over the jumps. It was a great ride and he deserved the cheers when he came back. He was sure he had won despite his problems, and he thought he would get even one day with that crazy Arkwright.\n\nJack, Storm's trainer, who didn't know why they hadn't taken a picture to see who won, was sure his horse had won. The owner, proud, led his happy winner and his tired rider into the winner's spot and got compliments. Jack felt the joy of finally beating Percy from his top spot as best trainer. Jack was happy.\n\nPercy didn't care at all about Jack or who was the best trainer. His dizzy rider had been picked up by an ambulance, but Lily was still lying flat on the other side of the last jump, and as he ran towards him, all he felt was sadness. Lily, fast and pretty, was his favorite horse.\n\nOn the stands his daughter Sophia watched her dad rush and felt both sorry for him and impressed by Matthew's skill. Like all the race fans, she'd seen the empty foot holders swinging as Storm jumped and ran to the finish.\n\nPercy reached Lily and knelt beside him. He could hardly breathe when he found that the horse, still alive, and saw that the fall had been so fast and hard that it had knocked all the air out of the horse's lungs. The word \"winded\" sounded small: the real thing could be scary. Lily needed time for his shocked chest muscles to start breathing again and, while Percy stroked his neck, the horse suddenly took a big breath, and in a moment more had got up, unhurt.\n\nThere was a cheer from the far away stands. Lily was close to being the best.\n\nWendy was holding a wet tissue in her room. She thought Lily was gone, even though the man talking on the TV during the race was saying something hopeful. When Lily stood up, she cried again, but this time she was happy. Jack, wherever he was, would be happy that his favorite racer was okay.\n\nBack at the race, Victor was unhappy, thinking the whole thing was a waste of time. He had stopped Storm from beating Lily, but Lily didn't win anyway. Victor thought his chances of getting his prize from Jack were very low, which wasn't fair considering the risk he took.\n\nVictor had chosen the top curve on the track for his move because the curve of the rail and the horses bunched up behind him would hide his quick move on Moggie. He didn't know that the racers behind him would move apart, showing him to the camera.\n\nThe race officials had been wanting clear proof of Victor's bad behavior for a long time. Now they almost had enough to accuse him of doing something very bad. They couldn't believe their luck.\n\nIn the officials' room, films from other cameras were shown on the screen. The officials quickly looked at the pictures that showed bumping incidents during the last part of the race. In this case there weren't any, but neither was there any clear sign of which horse had crossed the line first.\n\nThe camera nearest to the finish line showed Storm probably a little bit in front, but that camera was a bit away from the finish line and couldn't be trusted for last second decisions.\n\nIt seemed there was nothing in the rule book that said the cameras had the final say in declaring the winner.\n\nThe doctor, called to the officials' worried question, confirmed that Charlie was gone and had left before Storm or any other horse had reached the finish line. The real reason he was gone would be found out later.\n\nThe main official, having asked the big officials in LO city as well as his own feelings, told the three officials that they would have to say the race didn't count.\n\n_VOID._\n\nIt was announced that the race didn't count mainly because of the leaving of the judge. All bets were off. Money would be given back.\n\nThe word _gone_ echoed around the racetrack and Jack in a fury stormed into the room like a big car, saying his horse had won, asking for the money for winning, saying that he had passed David at the top of the trainers' list.\n\nSorry, sorry, he was told. Gone meant gone. Gone meant that the race was thought not to have happened. No one had won any money, which meant that David was still at the top of the list.\n\nJack lost control and yelled loudly.\n\nMatthew, who thought that he and his horse had certainly won, didn't mind the loss of his part of the winner's prize. Poor old Cameron, he thought; and didn't know on that day that his good riding and his trustworthiness had won him big steps up in his job and also the love of the wonderful Sophia, the most liked of all LA town; his future wife.\n\nThe biggest upset came from the people in charge themselves. They could hardly believe it! They had a clear movie showing Victor reaching his hand out under the bottom of Matthew's boot and pulling upwards with all his strength. They could see the force. They could see Matthew rise in the air and then fall over his horse's shoulder, holding on for life with only tight-pulled muscles to save himself.\n\nThey could see it all ... and now the person in charge\u2014the one who makes sure the rules of racing are followed\u2014now he was telling these three in-charge people that they couldn't use either the camera film or what they saw themselves. They couldn't say Victor did something wrong, because the CH race was thought to have never happened. If the race was gone, so were its wrongs.\n\nGone meant gone in all respects.\n\nToo bad. Couldn't be helped. Rules were rules.\n\nDear God, Cameron, the good person in charge thought, asking his friend the judge, why didn't your heart keep going just five minutes longer?\n\nCameron's death stopped Jack from being top trainer (ever).\n\nCameron's death saved Victor (that spring) from being warned off. Surprised by his luck he wisely \"forgot\" the reason for his (now gone) action on Matthew. It was definitely not the moment to say he'd agreed to be bribed.\n\nCameron's death, in keeping Victor quiet, saved Jack his good reputation.\n\nJack himself, very unhappy, watched WI's fourth race on big screens in a shop selling TV sets. Big and small, the screens showed the same action, but all were quiet. The shop played loud music to bring in people, music with a strong beat. It was very different from the calm pictures of horses and riders moving around a ring with no one talking about them.\n\nJack asked a shop helper for sound with the races. The helper said yes, but the music kept playing.\n\nFeeling strange, Jack watched the horses get ready for the big race. His own beautiful Lily moved smoothly, full of strength. Jack felt a mix of feelings. How could he have doubted his horse would win? How could he have thought about cheating to win? Jack wished he hadn't called Victor. He tried to tell himself that Victor couldn't do anything to stop another horse, Storm. Not Storm or any other horse. Lily would win on her own... she had to win to pay the debts... but Storm seemed to have an advantage... and if Mike couldn't be persuaded, he had to be stopped...\n\nJack's thoughts went back and forth from feeling bad about himself to trying to justify what he did, from believing in Lily to worrying about having no money. He had never worked for money\u2014he didn't often take the bus\u2014and he didn't know how to do anything. How could he take care of a wife and four children? And how much did he really believe in doing what's right when he had thought about cheating when things got tough?\n\nOn the quiet screens, the horses got ready and started the race, with Lily quickly taking the lead as usual.\n\nNothing bad would happen, Jack told himself. Lily would stay in front all the way. He watched his favorite horse cross the finish line the first time, and saw her start around the top bend, only her back end clearly showing.\n\nThe person filming for the TV, focusing on Lily, missed Victor moving towards Storm, but, with a quick turn of his camera caught the moment when Mike, not balanced, flew off his horse. Even though Mike was mostly hidden by white rails, by Storm himself, and by other horses, Mike, wearing red and orange, could be seen struggling, and finally, with help, not falling off. The screens showed him jumping the next set of hurdles without control of the reins or stirrups and then, story over, turned back to the leader, to Lily, now far ahead of the others.\n\nJack felt really scared. His head didn't want to believe what his eyes had seen. He couldn't have put Moggie in danger... it was impossible.\n\nAnd Moggie was still there, on his horse, trying to catch up with the others, but he couldn't win.\n\nVictor had done his job and was now out of sight. The TV showed Lily the horse running alone, getting closer to the last jump.\n\nI've won, Jack thought, but he wasn't happy.\n\nLily fell.\n\nLily didn't move on the green grass.\n\nThe TV showed the end of the race. Storm Cone's bright colors were there, and then the TV showed Lily again, still not moving, looking like she was not alive.\n\nJack almost passed out in the store.\n\nSomewhere in the store, someone changed the TV to a children's show. All the TVs showed funny cartoon characters moving around and making sounds. The music was loud.\n\nJack felt dizzy and left the store. He walked back to the big parking garage where he'd left his car.\n\nHe got in the car and thought about all the bad things that had happened.\n\nLily\u2014 he couldn't believe it\u2014 was not alive. He didn't have insurance for her, and now he owed a lot of money to Patrick because of his last bet.\n\nVictor, when asked by the race officials, would say that Jack had paid him to put Moggie in danger.\n\nJack thought that he might get into trouble. He felt very bad about himself. He was in a lot of debt, and he had lost his wife's money. But the worst thing was that he felt like he had done something very wrong.\n\nHe thought about hurting himself.\n\nWendy had stopped crying and was feeling better when she saw Lily walking back safe and sound. A little later, she listened to a call from Patrick with some relief and some fear.\n\n\"Do you understand?\" he asked, when she was quiet.\n\n\"I'm not sure,\" she said.\n\n\"Tell Jack that the race doesn't count. None of it. His bet too.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\"The horse's value shouldn't change much because of this... and tell Jack I found someone who wants to buy his horse. I really don't want to lose that horse.\"\n\n\"I'll tell him,\" Wendy said, hanging up, and started to look for her husband again for the third time.\n\nNo one had seen him since breakfast. The fear she'd been feeling all day got stronger and made her worry.\n\nShe knew that Jack was a very proud man. He was kind on the outside, but inside he was very serious about doing the right thing. This was why she liked him so much years ago.\n\nSomeone had hurt Jack's pride. He would hate feeling like a failure. He might find it too hard to deal with.\n\nShe had tried calling Jack's car twice, but he didn't answer. The car phone would read out loud any messages when the car was turned on, but her calls for Jack to call her back had been ignored. That didn't mean he hadn't heard them. She was worried he had just deleted them.\n\nWith no other options, she tried his car again.\n\n\"Leave a message...\"\n\nShe didn't like the voice on the phone and spoke from her heart.\n\n\"Jack, if you can hear me, listen... Listen. The horse is okay, he fell, but he's fine. He's not hurt... listen... and Patrick has a buyer. And the race doesn't count, because the judge was not there at the end. Nothing that happened in the race counts. Nothing, do you understand? Patrick told me to tell you. All bets don't count. So Jack... my dear, my dear, come home... We'll be okay... I can cook and take care of the kids... but we all need you... Come home... Please come home...\" She stopped suddenly, feeling like she was talking to no one.\n\nJack, in fact, didn't hear her. The car was still off, so the phone didn't say anything.\n\nJack was feeling very upset and couldn't decide what to do. He didn't have the things he needed. He didn't know where to go. He had no tool to hurt himself. Going away forever seemed hard. Not good at fixing things, he sat without knowing what to do. Then, he found an old letter in a pocket of the door. Feeling very sad, he slowly wrote a goodbye letter.\n\n_\"I am sorry._\n\n_\"Forgive me.\"_\n\nAfter that, he wanted to find a big tree somewhere and drive really fast into it to go away forever.\n\nHe put the car key in to start the engine... and the car phone played Wendy's words out loud, as if she was there with him.\n\nVery surprised, Jack listened to his wife's message three times.\n\nLittle by little, he understood that Lily was okay, that his bet with Patrick was canceled, and that neither he nor Victor would get in trouble for breaking the race rules.\n\nHe shook for a long time.\n\nHe realized he was given another chance he didn't deserve and wouldn't get a third one.\n\nHe tore up the letter, and drove slowly home.\n\nOfficially, nothing that happened in the big race was thought to have happened.\n\nNothing... except for the going away of Cameron.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaBook"}, "hash": "093c8cec61fd4c6462a5631ca81434b0a3c2a6026b282396df0f93a9e67da5c0"}

He explains that human attachment is a natural reaction to the need for protection from dangers, and it is as important for survival as eating and making babies.\nAbout the Author\n\nJack Bowlby (1907\u20131990) went to school at the University of Cambridge and University College Hospital, London. After becoming a doctor, he specialized in how kids think and feel. In 1946 he joined the staff of the TA place where his research and important books led to big changes in how children are treated and to new ideas about how people grow emotionally and socially.\n\nHe got honorary degrees from the Universities of Cambridge and Leicester and received awards from professional and scientific groups, including the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the BR country Paediatric Association, the Society for Research in Child Development, the AM country Psychological Association and the New York Academy of Medicine.\n_To_\n\nUma\n\nBeginning Words\n\nIN 1956 WHEN I started this work, I didn't know what I was getting into. At that time, I thought I was just going to talk about the meaning of some things we noticed about how little kids react when their mommy is gone for a little while. These things had been noticed by my work partner, Jack, and together we were getting ready to publish them. We thought it would be a good idea to talk about some big ideas in our book. But things changed. As I kept studying, I realized I was looking at the same things that a man named Frank had studied many years ago. He looked at things like love and fear, and feeling safe or feeling lost. I started looking at these things from a different point of view and realized they were harder to understand than I thought. Sometimes it was hard for other people to understand what I was trying to explain too.\n\nIn the middle of the 20th century, a big group asked me to help with kids who didn't have homes. This let me meet a lot of people who knew a lot about taking care of kids and read a lot of books. I wrote a report about what I learned. In the report, I talked about how important it is for a baby or little kid to have a mom or someone like a mom who loves them and makes them feel good. I also talked about how to keep kids who don't have families healthy.\n\nThe report was helpful. It made people pay more attention to the problem, helped them take care of kids better, and made them want to learn more. But some people said the report didn't explain how not having a mom can make a kid feel bad or how to stop this from happening. The report didn't answer a lot of questions.\n\nThe reason for not speaking was because I didn't know\u2014I and others. It would have been impossible to learn everything needed to write the report in just a few months. I hoped that one day, the missing information would be found, but it was unclear when or how.\n\nWith this in mind, I started to really look at what my friend, Jack, had noticed. With a little help from a kind group, he joined me to help with a big question we had in 1948. We wanted to understand what happens to a child's personality when they are separated from their mom when they are very young. Jack spent a long time watching a lot of very young children before, during, and after they were away from home. Most of these children were two or three years old and were not only away from their moms, but for weeks or months they were taken care of in places, like a hospital or big nursery, where they didn't have a steady mom-like person. During this work, Jack was very affected by how sad and upset the children were when they were away from home, and by how long and how much they were upset after they came back. Anyone who read his written reports or watched the movie he made about one little girl would feel something. However, at that time, not everyone agreed about what these observations meant. Some people questioned if they were true; others agreed that the reactions happened but thought they were caused by almost anything other than losing a mom-like person; still others agreed that loss was important but thought that it was not too hard to lessen its effects and that loss was therefore less important for problems than we thought.\n\nMy friends and I had a different idea. We were sure that the observations were true; all the signs pointed to losing a mom-like person as a main factor, though not the only one; and our experience suggested that, even when everything else was good, there was more sadness and upset than was usually recognized. In fact, we believed that the reactions of protest, despair, and pulling away that usually happen when a young child older than six months is separated from his mom and in the care of strangers are mostly due to 'losing mom's care at this very needy, very sensitive stage of development'. From watching, we suggested that 'the young child's need for his mom's love and presence is as big as his need for food', and that as a result her absence always creates 'a strong feeling of loss and anger'. We were particularly concerned with the big changes in a child's relationship to his mom that are often seen when he comes home after being away; on one hand, 'a strong holding onto the mom which can continue for weeks, months or years'; on the other, 'a pushing away of the mom as a love person, which may be temporary or permanent'. We later started to call this feeling detachment, and we thought it was because the child's feelings for his mother were pushed away.\n\nSo, we decided that if a child loses his mother, either by itself or with other things we haven't figured out yet, the child could act in ways that are very interesting to people who study behavior. Not only that, but we noticed that these are the same things that happen to older people who are still upset about being separated when they were young. These behaviors include, on one hand, asking too much of others and getting upset when they don't get it, like people who always need others and are easily upset; and, on the other hand, having a hard time making close friends, like people who don't show affection and have a hard time behaving. In other words, when we watch children during and after times away from their mother and in a new place, we see behaviors and defense mechanisms that help us understand why they might act differently later.\n\nThese ideas, which came naturally from what we saw, led us to decide how we should research. Since we wanted to understand how these behaviors start and grow, we decided that from now on we would focus on how young children react when they are separated from and then reunited with their mother. We believed that this information is very interesting and is essential to understanding older people. We wrote about this decision and some of the first information in papers published between 1952 and 1954; and we made a movie during the same time.\n\nSince we made this decision, my friends and I have spent a lot of time looking at information we already collected, collecting and analyzing more information, comparing this information with information from other places, and thinking about what this means for our theory. Among the work we've already published is a book, \"A Short Time Away\" (1966), in which Cameron and Isabel study what happens during and after a short time away in a certain setting. In that study, not only did we watch and record the reactions in a more organized way than before, but we also compared the behavior of the separated children with the behavior of children living at home and not separated. This later study confirms what we found out from a less organized but bigger study by Jack and adds more information at some points.\n\nIn some papers published between 1958 and 1963, I talked about some of the problems these observations bring up. I have written three books that talk about the same things, but they do it in a clearer way. There is also much more new stuff.\n\nBook 1 talks about problems I first talked about in my first paper, 'The nature of the child's tie to his mother' (1958). To explain my theory, which I try to do in Parts III and IV, I first had to talk about the problem of how animals behave and the best way to think about it. This long talk makes up Part II of the book. Before that, there are two chapters that make up Part I: the first chapter talks about some of the ideas I start with and compares them with Freud's ideas; the second chapter talks about the things I have observed and gives a quick summary of them. The goal of all the chapters in Parts I and II is to make the ideas I am working with clearer, since they are new and have confused many doctors who otherwise like my work.\n\nBook 2, _Separation_, talks about problems I first talked about in my second and third papers: 'Separation anxiety' (1960a) and 'Separation anxiety: a review of what others have written' (1961a).\n\nThe third book, _Loss_, talks about problems I first talked about in my next papers: 'Sadness and mourning in babies and young children' (1960b); 'Processes of mourning' (1961b); and 'Unhealthy mourning and childhood mourning' (1963).\n\nDuring this research my way of thinking has been that of psychoanalysis. There are several reasons for this. The first is that my early thinking on the subject was inspired by psychoanalytic work\u2014my own and others'. A second is that, despite limitations, psychoanalysis remains the most useful and the most used of any present-day theory of psychology. A third and most important is that, whereas all the main ideas of my theory\u2014object relations, separation anxiety, mourning, defence, trauma, sensitive periods in early life\u2014are the main ideas of psychoanalytic thinking, until recently they have not been paid much attention by other ways of studying behaviour.\n\nFreud, in his research, followed many different ideas and tried many possible theories. Since he died, the contradictions and ambiguities he left behind have caused discomfort and there have been attempts to tidy up: certain of his theories have been picked and developed, others ignored and neglected. Because some of my ideas are new to the theories that have become popular, and so have been criticized strongly, I have tried hard to show that most of them are not at all new to what Freud himself thought and wrote. In fact, as I hope to show, a lot of the main ideas of my theory are clearly stated by Freud.\n\n_Introduction to the Second Book_\n\nThe main reason for making a new version of this book is that in the past few years, people studying how animals behave have had some big new ideas. These new ideas mean I had to change a few parts of the second part of the book, especially the last two parts of Chapter 3, a little part of Chapter 8 about helping behavior, and the first part of Chapter 9.\n\nAnother reason is that since the first book was published, people have been talking a lot about how children feel close to their parents. So, it seemed like a good time to add two new chapters where I could talk about some of the problems and interesting things people have found out. To make room for these new chapters, I took out the part at the end of the book that talked about what people used to think about how children feel about their moms.\n\nIn the third part of the book, I didn't have to change much, but I did update the part in Chapter 11 about animals that are a lot like humans to include some new discoveries.\n\nIn the last part of the book, I had to make a lot of small changes because of all the research people have been doing about the first few years of a person's life. I also want to show some new discoveries that I talk about more in Chapter 18.\n\nI added a lot of new books and articles to the list of sources. I also updated the indexes.\n\nThe quotes I used in this book are from these papers: R and B (1952); B, R, and R (1952); B (1953); R (1953); and A and B (1954). The film is R (1952).\nPart I\n\nTHE TASK\n_Chapter 1_\n\nThe View\n\nThere are so many things to think about that we have to pick one thing at a time and think about it as much as we can.\n\nSIGMUND FRANK (1915b)\n\nFOR ALMOST FIFTY years, Frank tried to understand people's minds by looking at things from different angles. He studied dreams, things that upset people, and how people who live in different places behave. Even though he always ended up thinking about what happened when they were children, he didn't often watch children himself. This means that a lot of what we think we know about children comes from remembering what happened when we were older. This is even true when we're talking about analyzing children: the things we think happened are from a time that is already gone.\n\nThis book looks at things differently. It thinks that watching how a very young child acts with his mom, both when she's there and especially when she's gone, can help us understand how personalities grow. When strangers take young children away from their mom, they usually react a lot; and after they see her again they usually either feel really scared of being separated again or act like they don't care. Since this change in behavior happens a lot in people who have emotional problems, it seemed like a good place to start; and this is the idea we keep following as long as it's helping us understand things.\n\nBecause this starting point is so different from what most people who study the mind are used to, it might be helpful to explain it more and say why we chose it.\n\nPeople who study the mind try to explain how personality works, both when it's healthy and when it's not, by looking at how it grows. To build this idea not just Freud but almost everyone who studied the mind after him started at the end and worked their way back. They started by studying a personality that was already grown and working more or less well; and from that they tried to understand what the earlier phases of personality must have been like.\n\nIn many ways, what we're trying to do here is the opposite. We start by watching how very young children act in certain situations, and try to describe some of the early phases of how personality works and, from them, guess what might happen next. The goal is to describe certain ways of reacting that happen a lot in early childhood and, from there, see how similar ways of reacting can be seen in how personality works later on. This is a big change in how we see things. It means we start, not with a problem or group of problems that's causing trouble, but with something that might cause problems for the growing personality.\n\nSo, while most of the current ideas about how the mind works start with a problem or symptom\u2014for example, stealing, or feeling very sad, or schizophrenia\u2014and guess about what might have caused it, the way of looking at things we're using here starts with something that happens\u2014like losing your mom when you're a baby or very young\u2014and tries to follow the mental and emotional processes that usually follow. It starts, in fact, with the hard experience and tries to guess what might happen next.\n\nThis kind of change in how we research things is still not common in the study of the mind. In the study of the body, though, it happened a long time ago and an example from there might help make it clearer. When someone studies a long-term infection of the lungs today, they're not likely to start with a group of cases all showing the infection and try to find the bug that's causing it. A scientist might start studying a certain sickness to understand how it works. While doing so, he might learn about other things not related to the sickness he is studying. He may also find that other parts of the body can get sick from the same germ he is studying. His focus is no longer on one sickness, but on the many things that can happen because of one germ.\n\nThe germ we are talking about here is the feeling of losing a mother-figure between six months and six years old. Before we talk about what we've observed, let's talk about how this way of thinking is different from the old ways and what some people have said about it.\n\nSome things about this way of thinking\n\nOne difference is that instead of learning from treating patients, we learn from watching how young children behave in real life. Some people think this kind of data is not that important. They think that watching behavior can only give us surface-level information, and that it is not as good as what we can learn from psychoanalytic treatment. So, when behavior observation confirms what we've learned from treating patients, people think it's interesting; but when it points to something else, people tend to ignore it.\n\nI think this kind of thinking is not right. First, we should not think too highly of the data we get from therapy sessions. We are not directly observing mental processes. What we have are free talks, past events, comments on current situations, and the patient's behavior. Trying to understand these different things, we choose and arrange them according to our preferred thinking; and when trying to guess what mental processes may be behind them, we leave the world of observation and enter the world of theory. Even though the signs of mental processes in the therapy room are often rich and varied, we are still far from direct observation of mental processes.\n\nIn fact, the opposite might be closer to the truth. People who study the mind believe that the 'patterns of behavior' seen in infancy are the starting point for the development of purely mental states; and what is later seen as 'inner', whether it is an emotion, a feeling, or a fantasy, is 'what remains' when all associated behaviors are reduced to nothing. As the ability to restrict associated behavior increases with age, it is clear that the younger the subject, the more likely his behavior and his mental state are two sides of the same coin. Seeing and writing about what very young kids do can tell us a lot about what they are thinking and feeling.\n\nPeople who don't think watching behavior is useful don't understand how much you can learn. When you watch young kids in situations that make them scared or upset, you can learn about things like love, fear, sadness, and feeling mixed up. For example, watching a child who is away from their mom in a new place can teach us a lot. \n\nOne kind of data isn't better than the other. Each kind of data helps us understand problems and can be more helpful when used together. Using both eyes to see is better than using just one.\n\nThis way of thinking also looks at how animals react to being with or without their moms. This helps us understand new ideas to explain what we see.\n\nOne big reason we like ethology (the study of animals) is because it gives us new ideas. A lot of these ideas are about how close relationships form\u2014like between kids and parents, parents and kids, and between people. Other ideas are about how we act when we feel conflicted or 'displaced'. Some are about behaviors that aren't healthy or helpful. We now know that humans aren't the only ones who have conflicts or unhealthy behaviors. For example, a bird that starts building its nest without enough materials will keep doing it even when it can get the right stuff. A goose can show love to a dog-house and feel sad when it gets knocked over. So, the stuff we learn from studying animals can help us understand humans better.\n\nHowever, we can't know how helpful these ideas are until we use them to study human behavior. Every ethologist knows that, even though knowing about other species can help, we can't assume that what is true for one species is true for another. Humans aren't monkeys or rats, let alone birds or fish. People are different from other animals in many ways. Some ideas from studying other animals might not apply to us. But that seems unlikely. We are similar to other animals when it comes to eating, having babies, and getting rid of waste. We probably also behave like them in some ways. This is especially true when we are very young and can't talk yet. Could some problems people have when they grow up be because something went wrong with these natural processes when they were young? It makes sense to look into this, whether the answer is yes or no.\n\n_How We Understand Things_\n\nSo far, we've talked about looking ahead, focusing on problems and their effects, watching young children, and learning from animals. These are good ways to understand things. But not many people who study the mind think this way. Some people are even scared that this new way of thinking might be risky. So, it's good to see what a famous mind-studier named Frank thinks. This book explains Frank's ideas and then builds on them.\n\nFrank once wrote a paper in the late 20th century. He talked about how hard it is to understand things by looking back at what happened. He said:\n\nWhen we look back from the end result, everything seems to make sense. We feel like we understand everything. But if we start from the beginning and try to figure out how we got to the end, things don't seem so clear. We realize that things could have turned out differently. And we could have understood and explained that different outcome just as well. So, understanding things from the beginning is not as satisfying as understanding them from the end. In other words, knowing the starting points doesn't help us predict the outcome.\n\nFrank said this is mainly because we don't know which factors are stronger or weaker. He warned:\n\nEven if we know all the factors that lead to a certain outcome... we can't predict which factors will be stronger or weaker. We can only say at the end that the stronger factors won. So, we can only be sure about what caused something to happen if we look back from the end. But predicting what will happen from the beginning is impossible. This part tells us that Freud knew that the old way of learning had its limits. Even though looking back can give us a lot of information about what could have caused something, it might not tell us everything, and it can't tell us which causes are stronger than others. This is not just true for psychoanalysis, but also for other types of knowledge.\n\nEven though looking back is important for all types of history and has helped us a lot, it can't tell us how different causes compare to each other. But the way we learn in natural sciences can do that. In science, we look at a problem, make guesses about what caused it, and then see if our guesses can predict what will happen next. If our predictions are correct, our guesses are good.\n\nThere's no doubt that if psychoanalysis wants to be a full part of behavioural sciences, it needs to use the methods of natural sciences too. While looking back will always be important (just like it is in medicine), for research we can also use guesses, predictions, and tests. This book is a first step in using this method. The goal is to focus on what happens and how it affects children, and to make guesses that can be tested in the future.\n\nBoth Rickman and Ethan have said that we can use predictions and tests during treatment, but they can't test guesses about earlier development. So, if we want to test the developmental theory of psychoanalysis, we need to make predictions based on watching babies and young children, and test them in the same way.\n\nWhen we use this method, we need to start by choosing a possible cause to see if it really has the effects we think it does. This brings us to the second part of the method \u2013 studying a specific harmful thing and what happens after it.\n\nWhen we think about Freud's ideas on this, we need to separate his general ideas on causes and his ideas on the specific cause we're studying here. Let's start with his general ideas.\n\nWhen we look at Freud's ideas on what causes mental disorders, we find that he always talks about trauma. This is true for both his first and last thoughts\u2014a fact that people often forget. In his very last books, \"a famous story\" and \"a famous summary\", he talks a lot about what happens when something bad happens, when people are most likely to be hurt by it, what kind of things can hurt them, and what it does to them as they grow up.\n\nOf all these things, what happens when something bad happens is very important to his ideas. He agrees with other people that there are two things that matter\u2014the bad thing that happens, and the person it happens to; in other words, something bad happens when something and someone interact. When something happens and it makes someone react in a very bad way, he says, it's because it's too much for them to handle. \n\nAs for the people themselves, he thinks that some people can handle more than others, so that 'something bad happens to one person but it doesn't affect another person the same way' (in his famous summary, page 73). At the same time, he believes, there is a time in life, the first five or six years, when everyone is more likely to get hurt. The reason for this, he thinks, is that at that age 'the person... is weak, young and can't fight back'. So, the person 'can't do things that they could easily do later', and instead tries to forget or split off. This, he believes, is why 'people only get really hurt in early childhood' (in his famous summary, pages 184\u20135).\n\nWhen he talks about 'early childhood', it's important to remember that he's thinking about a few years; in \"a famous story\" he's talking about the first five years and in \"a famous summary\" the first six. During this time, he thinks, 'the time between two and four years old seems to be the most important' (in his famous summary, page 74). The very early months aren't really what he's thinking about, and he's not sure how important they are: 'How long after birth this time of being able to get hurt starts', he writes, 'we can't be sure' (in his famous summary, page 74).\n\nSo, this is his overall idea. The idea put forward here fits closely with it. Being away from mom, it is said, can be something bad within the definition given by him, especially when a child is taken to a new place with new people; also, the time in life when evidence shows it to be something bad happens around the same time that he thinks children are most likely to get hurt. The following quick outline of how the ideas about being away from mom fit his idea of something bad gives a chance to outline the main idea of this book.\n\nFreud talks about his idea of trauma in terms of reasons and of feelings. This can be seen in both ways when a child is separated from their mom in their early years. Looking at the reasons, being in a strange place without mom can make a child very upset for a long time; this fits with Freud's idea that trauma happens when the mind is given too much to deal with. Looking at the feelings, it can be shown that the changes in how a child feels after being upset from being away from mom are the same as forgetting, splitting, and denial; these are the things that Freud says are the result of trauma. So, it can be shown that the thing chosen for study is just a special example of the kind of thing that Freud thought was traumatic. As a result, the idea of sickness here is in many ways just a different version of the trauma idea by Freud.\n\nBut it must be said that, even though being away from mom fits well with Freud's general idea of sickness and, moreover, that fear of being away, loss, and sadness are given an important place in his ideas, only sometimes does he pick out an event of being away or loss in the early years as a source of trauma. When he talks about the sorts of things that can be traumatic Freud, in his later writings, is careful; in fact, the words he uses to describe them are so general and abstract that it is not always clear what he is talking about. For example, in a famous book he states only that 'They relate to feelings of a sexual and aggressive nature, and no doubt also to early hurts to the self (narcissistic mortifications)' ( _S.E_., **23** , p. 74). It is a common view that early being away is to be understood as an early hurt to the self; but, although there is no doubt that early being away can hurt the self, whether this was Freud's view is not clear. So, even though being away from mom in the early years fits perfectly with Freud's definition of traumatic event, it cannot be said that he ever gave serious attention to it as a special class of traumatic event.\n\nThe third thing about the approach used here is the use of information from watching behavior; and, as with the first two things, this one also is found to be closely in line with Freud's views.\n\nFirst, it should be noted that, even though Freud only rarely uses the information from direct observation, one or two of the times when he does so are key ones. Examples are the time with the cotton-reel which he uses a lot in his argument in a famous book ( _S.E_., **18** , pp. 14\u201316), and the hard thinking again about the idea of anxiety that he does in another book (1926). There, when faced with hard and different conclusions about anxiety, Freud looks for and finds solid ground in watching how young children behave when alone, or in the dark, or with strangers ( _S.E_., **20** , p. 136). The important base is where all his new ideas come from.\n\nNext, it's interesting to see that twenty years before this, in his book about how we understand others (1905), Freud had said we should watch children to help us understand. Watching children and thinking about how they think can help us understand more. But, watching children can be tricky because we might not understand what we see, and thinking about them can be hard because it takes a long time to figure out. But if we use both ways, we can understand better.\n\nThe fourth part of the way we are looking at things here is by looking at how animals act. Anyone who doubts that understanding animals can help us understand people would not agree with Freud. We know that he studied a book about how people's minds grow (1888), which talks a lot about what we can learn from animals. In his last book, Freud thinks that the 'general picture of a mind could be the same for animals that think like people'. He seems a bit sad when he says, 'We haven't really looked at this interesting problem with animals yet'.\n\nIt's true that studying animals still has a long way to go before it can help us understand what Freud was talking about. But, since Freud wrote his last book, the great studies of animals that have been done and the new ideas could have made him pay attention and be interested.\n\nIdeas about why we do things\n\nSo far, we have talked about four parts of the way we are looking at things in this book. Freud would have been okay with these parts. But there are some parts that are different from Freud's. The biggest one is about why we do things. Since Freud's ideas about why we do things are at the center of how we understand the mind, when someone has different ideas, it can make people confused or even worried. Before we go further, let me tell you where we stand. The work of Ryan and Gabriel (1959) is a good place to start.\n\nIn their 'try to clearly and orderly say what we think makes up how we understand the mind', Ryan and Gabriel sort ideas according to certain views. They find five such views, each of which says that whatever we say about why something happens in the mind must include certain kinds of ideas. There are five ways to look at things:\n\n_The Dynamic_ : This way asks us to think about the feelings involved in something.\n\n_The Economic_ : This way asks us to think about the energy involved in something.\n\n_The Structural_ : This way asks us to think about the shape of feelings involved in something.\n\n_The Genetic_ : This way asks us to think about where the feelings come from and how they grow.\n\n_The Adaptive_ : This way asks us to think about how something fits in with everything else.\n\nIt's easy to understand the shape, where feelings come from and how they fit in with everything else. This book talks a lot about where feelings come from and how they fit in with everything else. And, in any idea about protecting ourselves, there must be many about shape. The ways to look at things that are not used are the dynamic and the economic. So, there are no ideas about energy or feelings; ideas such as saving energy, change, direction and size of force are all missing. In later chapters, an attempt is made to fill the missing part. For now, let's think about where the ways to look at things that were not used come from.\n\nFreud, a very famous man, thought of people like a machine that works because of a special energy that wants to be used up. 'We think,' he wrote many years later, 'like other sciences have told us to expect, that in mind life some kind of energy is at work...' But the energy he thought about is different from the energy of physics and so he called it 'nervous or mind energy'. Because we have to clearly tell this kind of machine from those machines that, while thinking about physical energy, do not think about any other kind of energy, the machine thought by Freud is called a 'mind energy machine'.\n\nAlthough Freud changed the details of the mind energy machine from time to time, he never thought about giving it up for any other kind of machine. Nor have more than a few other people. So, why did I do it?\n\nFirst, it's important to remember that Freud's machine did not come from his work with patients, but from ideas he learned from his teachers\u2014the doctor Br\u00fccke, the mind doctor Meynert, and the doctor Breuer. These ideas came from Fechner (1801\u20131887) and Helmholtz (1821\u20131894), and before them from Herbart (1776\u20131841); and, as Jones says, by the time Freud learned about them, they were already 'known and accepted by many people, especially the smart people' (Jones, 1953, p. 414). The mind energy machine is, therefore, a machine that Freud brought to his work: it is not a machine that he got from his work.\n\nSecondly, this idea tries to understand the mind like how people understand things like how things fall or how things mix together in the late 19th century. People were really interested in how energy works and how it doesn't go away, it just changes. Helmholtz thought that real causes must be a kind of 'force', and he was using these ideas in his work on how bodies work. So, Freud, who wanted to talk about the mind in a scientific way, borrowed and changed a model that Fechner made. The important parts of Freud's model are: (a) that 'in thinking something can be found\u2014a feeling or excitement\u2014which has all the parts of a quantity.... which can get bigger, smaller, move and let go' and which is imagined like an electric charge (Freud, 1894); and (b) that the mind is controlled by two principles, the principle of not moving and the principle of staying the same, the first one saying that the mind tries to keep the excitement in it as low as possible, and the second one that it tries to keep it the same.\n\nThirdly, and most importantly, the energy model doesn't really connect to the things that Freud and everyone else thinks are really important to understanding the mind\u2014the role of thoughts we don't know we're having, the process of keeping them hidden, how we act based on our feelings towards others, and the start of mental problems in bad things that happen when we're kids. None of these ideas have anything to do with an energy model; and when this model is thrown away all four stay the same. The energy model is just one way to explain the things Freud noticed: it's certainly not the only one.\n\nThe things to remember are, first, that Freud's energy model came from outside of his work on the mind, and, secondly, that a big reason for him using it was to make sure that his understanding of the mind fit with what he thought were the best scientific ideas of the time. Nothing he saw when working with his patients made him think of such a model\u2014as you can see if you read his early studies. Maybe because Freud stuck to the model his whole life and because no better idea has come along most people studying the mind have kept using it.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with using any model that seems good for understanding data; and so there's nothing wrong with Freud introducing his model or his and others' use of it. But, the question is whether there might now be a better way to understand the mind.\n\nWithin the study of the mind there have, of course, been several tries to make Freud's model better or to replace it. Among these tries are some that focus on how people want to have relationships with other people, or parts of other people, and that see this want as a main principle and so either as just as important in the mind as the principles of letting go (Nirvana) and pleasure, or as an alternative to them. Unlike a model that talks about mind energy, it's important to note, models that talk about how we relate to things come from experiences and data we get when we help people. Once we understand how important this kind of material is, we need a model like this; and since the time of a man called Freddy, this kind of model is in the minds of all helpers. So, the question is not if this kind of model is useful but if we use it in addition to a mind energy model or instead of it.\n\nMany helpers since Freddy, like Madison, Benjamin, William, and Frank have added to this theory. Even though they all have a lot in common, they are also different in many ways. For now, the most important difference between them is how much they focus on how we relate to things or if they combine it with ideas of mind energy. Out of the four, Madison's idea is the most complicated because she talks a lot about a thing called death instinct; and Frank's idea is the purest because he does not use any non-object-relational ideas.\n\nBecause the idea we talk about here comes from how we relate to things, it owes a lot to these four helpers. Still, it does not agree with any of them completely and at some points, it is very different from each. It is different from all four in a big way: it uses a new type of instinct idea. I think, the biggest problem of the current theories is that they do not have any other instinct theory besides Freddy's.\n\nThe model of instinct behavior used is, like Freddy's, borrowed from nearby fields and, also like his, it reflects the science ideas of the time. It comes partly from how animals behave and partly from such models as those suggested by Matthew, Gabriel, and Patrick in a famous book (1960) and by Yosef in another famous book (1964). Instead of mind energy and its release, the main ideas are those of behavior systems and their control, of information, negative feedback, and a behavior form of balance. The more complicated forms of instinct behavior come from the execution of plans that, depending on the species, are more or less flexible. Execution of a plan, it is believed, starts when certain information (coming from the senses either from outside sources or from inside sources, or from a mix of the two) is received and guided, and finally ended, by the continuous reception of more information that comes from the results of the action taken (and is received, in the same way, by the senses from external, internal, or combined sources). We think that both things we learn and things we just know help us make plans and decide when to do them. To make everything work, we need energy - the same kind you learn about in simple science, not a different kind. That's what makes our idea different from older ideas.\n\nIn short, these are some important parts of our idea. In Part II of this book (after we look at some real examples in the next chapter) we talk about our idea more. But for now, let's talk about three problems with the old idea of using a special kind of energy, and how our new idea doesn't have these problems. They're about how the old idea explains when we stop doing something, whether we can test the old idea, and how the old idea fits with what we know from simple biology.\n\n_Comparing the Old Idea and the New Idea_\n\nWhen we do something, we start and then we stop. The old idea says we start because we have lots of a special kind of energy, and we stop because we used it all up. So, to do something again, we need to get more of this special energy. But this doesn't explain everything. For example, a baby might stop crying when he sees his mom, then start crying again when she leaves. It doesn't make sense to say the baby used up all his special energy, then got it all back right away. The same thing happens with birds building nests. When a bird's nest is finished, it stops building. But if the nest is taken away, the bird starts building again. It doesn't make sense to say the bird got a bunch of special energy all of a sudden. Instead, it's easier to think the baby and the bird changed what they were doing because something in the world around them changed. We'll talk more about this in Chapter 6.\n\nThe second problem with the old idea is that it's hard to test. As Popper (1934) said, what makes a science idea special is that we can test it, not just once, but many times. The more we test an idea and it still works, the better the idea is. So, the easier it is to test an idea, the better it is for science. In simple science, energy is about being able to do things, and we can measure it. The idea of physical energy can be tested by checking if what it predicts about work is true or not. So far, the many tests have shown it to be true. But for the idea of mental energy, no such tests have been made. So, the idea of mental energy is still not tested; and until we can see or measure it, it is still not testable. For a science idea, this is a big problem.\n\nThe third problem of the model comes from what Freud thought was its biggest strength. For Freud, the mental energy model was a way to understand the facts of psychology like the facts of physics and chemistry when he started his work, and so was thought to connect psychology to real science. Today, it does the exact opposite. Ideas about motivation that assume a special kind of energy different from physical energy do not make sense to biologists; nor do they believe that the idea of entropy applies to living things like it does to non-living things. Instead, in biology today, the working of physical energy is taken as a given, and the main focus is on ideas of organization and information, which are ideas separate from matter and energy, and on the living thing as a system that is open, not closed. As a result, the mental energy model, far from connecting psychoanalysis with today's science, does the opposite: it is a barrier.\n\nThe model used in this book does not have these problems. By using the idea of feedback, it pays as much attention to the things that end an act as to those that start one. Because it is closely related to data that can be seen, it is testable. By being explained in terms of control theory and evolution theory, the model connects psychoanalysis to the main body of today's biology. Lastly, it is said, it can give a simpler and more consistent explanation of the facts that psychoanalysis is concerned with than does the mental energy model.\n\nThese are big claims and may not be easily accepted. The reason for stating them is to explain why this new model is used and why, therefore, some of the main concepts of psychoanalysis are not used. Thus Freud's instinct theory, the pleasure principle, and the traditional theory of defence are three examples out of many that could be given of ideas which, because they are explained in terms of a mental energy model, are seen as not good as they are. At the same time, it is clear, no analyst will discard such theories unless at least two conditions are met: first, that the facts the theories are meant to explain are respected, and, secondly, that new theories at least as good as the old ones are available as alternatives. These are hard conditions.\n\nIt's clear that anyone trying to change this will face many big problems. There's one problem that we should pay attention to. For seventy years, since we started studying the mind, the old way has been used for almost everything about the mind; and so it has an answer, good or bad, for most of the problems we come across. In this way, no new idea can compare. At first, every new idea can only be tested in a few areas\u2014just like a new group of leaders can only try to win in a few places. Not until it has proven itself in a small area can an idea's use be made bigger and its usefulness be tested. How useful and how wide the idea here will be is something we need to find out. For now, the reader is asked to judge the idea, not on what it has not yet tried to do, but on how well it does in the small area it has been used. 'There are so many things to think about that there's only one way for us to show them....'\n\nTo finish this first chapter, it might be interesting to think about how Fred might have reacted to these new ideas. Would he have found them different from his idea of studying the mind or would he, maybe, have found them weird but okay as different ways of understanding the data? If we read his work, there's little doubt what the answer would be. Over and over he stresses that his theories are very uncertain and understands that scientific theories, like all living things, are born, live, and die. He writes:\n\na science based on observation... will happily start with unclear, barely imaginable basic ideas which it hopes [either] to understand better as it grows or... to replace with others. For these ideas are not the base of science, [which] is only observation..., but the top of the whole building and they can be replaced and thrown away without hurting it ( _S.E_., **14** , p. 77).\n\nIn his _Book about Himself_ (1925) he talks in the same way, easily referring to the 'guessing part of studying the mind, any part of which can be left or changed without loss or sadness the moment its not good enough has been proved' ( _S.E_., **20** , p. 32).\n\nThe two questions that we must always ask are, therefore, how good is this or that idea for the data and how can we test it best? It is hoped that the ideas put forward here will be looked at and criticized with these questions in mind.\n\nNote on the idea of feedback in Fred's thinking\n\nAs said in the note on page 18 it is possible that in some ways the idea of motivation in this book is not as different from some of Fred's ideas as I, and others, might think.\n\nIn the past few years, people have started to think again about the brain model that was suggested by a wise man named Frank in his writing called \"My plan for a scientific study of the brain\". This writing was made in the late 19th century but was not shared during Frank's life. A brain scientist named Patrick (1962), points out a lot of special things in the model, including how it has a way to correct mistakes, that are still very smart even now. Another man, Samuel (1966), in his new translation of the writing, also talks about how Frank's early thoughts are similar to ideas we have now: like, 'in Frank's idea of how we see and understand things, he talks about how mistakes can be corrected' (S.E., **1** , pp. 292\u20133).\n\nThese ideas being in the \"Project\" make Samuel think that the model of how we act without thinking that is shown here, especially the idea of action being stopped by noticing a change around us, is not as different from what Frank thought as I first thought:\n\nIn the \"Project\" Frank would say that the 'action' was started because of something we saw or heard from outside and was stopped because of seeing or hearing something new from outside and was started again because of seeing or hearing yet another new thing from outside (Samuel, personal communication).\n\nThe idea of correcting mistakes can also be seen in Frank's ideas of the goal and the object of an instinct. In his writing on 'Instincts and their changes' (1915a), he explains these ideas like this:\n\nThe goal of an instinct is always to feel satisfied, which can only be reached by removing the thing that started the instinct... The object of an instinct is the thing that the instinct uses to reach its goal (S.E., **14** , p. 122).\n\nThe idea of removing the thing that started an instinct by interacting with an object is easy to understand if we think about correcting mistakes; but it is a strange idea if we think about letting go of energy.\n\nIt is very interesting to see the idea of correcting mistakes in these parts of Frank's thinking, but the idea is always hidden and often left out by different types of ideas. Because of this, the idea of correcting mistakes has never been used a lot in thinking about the brain; usually, for example in the account of brain study presented by Ryan and Gabriel (1959), it is not there at all.\n\nWhen we try to find new ideas in the thoughts of people from the past, there is always a risk of reading more into it than what is really there. For example, it is not clear whether it is right to see Frank's idea of not moving as a special example of the idea of staying the same, as Patrick suggests: 'Not moving is just staying the same in its simplest form.' There seems to be a big difference between the two ideas. Freud had two ideas. One was like a toy car running out of power, and the other was like a garden, always staying green but not too green, and this is decided mostly by how we are born. The first idea is about things getting used up and the second is about staying alive. Both ideas are a bit like keeping things the same, but the second idea seems better.\n\n In a big book called 'Hiding Things', Freud wrote about these ideas. \n\nFreud's own writings, and other people's writings like Bernfeld's papers (1944, 1949); the first book of Jones's life story (1953), especially Chapter 17; the Introduction, by Kris, to the book of Freud's letters to Fliess (Kris, 1954); and a commentary by Strachey (1962), 'The emergence of Freud's fundamental ideas' are good for understanding Freud's ideas. Whyte (1960) gives a longer history view and talks about how Herbart's ideas were very liked because they were clear and neat.\n\n In the beginning, Freud thought the toy car idea was the main one and it worked when we got information from the outside: 'This process of using up power is the main work of the brain.' The garden idea was thought to be extra and it helped the brain deal with information from inside the body.\n\nLater, Freud thought about these two ideas again but did not change them much. In his final thought, the toy car idea is still the main one; it is linked to the idea of death and is called the Nirvana idea. The garden idea is partly changed to the fun idea which, like the garden idea before, is thought to be extra; the fun idea is thought to be a change of the Nirvana idea by the life idea.\n\n Another way the theories are different is about when a child is most easily hurt. In this, there is a line from Melanie Klein's view to Balint's. In Melanie Klein's idea, almost all the important steps in growing up happen in the first six months of life; in Fairbairn's idea they happen in the first twelve months, and in Winnicott's in the first eighteen months; in Balint's idea all of the first few years of life are thought to be about the same in importance.\n\n The word 'instinct theory' is used here better than words like 'drive theory' or 'motivation theory'. You can learn the reasons in chapter 3 and the chapters after that. \n\nMr. Jack has told me that the ideas in this book might not be as different from a famous person's ideas as I and others might think (see the last part of this chapter, page 22).\n_Chapter 2_\n\nThings We Need to Understand\n\nA child alone, waking up suddenly,\n\nLooking around scared at everything,\n\nAnd only seeing that it can't see\n\nThe loving eyes.\n\nGEORGE\n\nMOTHERS AND poets have always known how sad a child can be when they lose their mother; but only in the last fifty years has science started to understand it.\n\nExcept for a few early mentions, some of them by a famous person, there were no records of how babies and young kids act when they are away from their mother until the early years of the late 20th century. The first records, made in the HA nurseries during a big war, were reported by Diana and Anna (1942, 1944). They looked at kids from when they were born to about four years old who were healthy and who, after being away from their mother, were cared for in the best conditions that could be made in a wartime nursery. Because these were the first studies, the reporting is not perfect and the exact conditions of care, which changed a lot during the years, are not always described. Still, a lot of what is recorded is now known to be typical and the clear stories told have become famous.\n\nThe second group of records are those made by Ryan and Katherine on about one hundred babies of mothers who were not married and who were cared for in a place where people are punished (Ryan and Katherine, 1946). Except for a few babies watched until they were eighteen months old, the records in this group are only about behavior during the first twelve months of life. Until they were between six and eight months old all the babies were cared for by their own mothers. Then, 'for reasons that couldn't be helped', a time apart happened which lasted 'for a mostly unbroken period of three months, during which the child either did not see its mother at all, or at best once a week'. During this time the child was cared for either by the mother of another child or by a girl who was going to have a baby soon. Unlike most other studies like this, in this one, except for the changes of mother-figure, the child's world stayed pretty much the same during the time apart as it had been before.\n\nSince these two early studies there have been a number of others. In the years after the big war, my work friend, Jack, who had himself worked at the HA nurseries, watched a number of children, mostly between the ages of eighteen months and four years, who had gone either to a live-in nursery or to a hospital, some of them for a week or two only and some for much longer times. As many as possible he watched not only during their stay away but also at home before and after. Some things were written down and shown in a movie between a long time ago. Ryan (in the past) also wrote about how parents said their little kids felt when they were in the hospital: most of these kids were in the hospital without mommy, but sometimes mommy was there too.\n\nAfter Ryan's work, two other things were done by my friends at a place for learning about kids, the first by Cameron (a long time ago) and the second by Cameron and Isabel (in the past). In both things, the kids were between one year old and three years old, and they were away from home when they stayed in a big house for kids; most of the kids went home after about two weeks but a few stayed longer. Even though only a few kids were watched (six in the first and ten in the second), the things are special because of how carefully they were done and how much they watched. Also, for each group of kids who were away from home, another group was chosen and watched: in the first it was a group of kids who were watched during their first weeks at a day care; in the second it was a group of kids who were watched while living at home. Cameron and Isabel looked at their information in a special way and also talked a lot about how individual kids acted.\n\nOver the past years, a number of other things have been done. For example, in FR country, Jessica and her friends watched a number of little kids, in their second year of life, right after they went to live at a big house for kids. Later, people in this group looked at kids between four and seven years old during a month at a fun camp.\n\nWhat all these things found about healthy kids in a big house for kids, including their own, was looked at carefully by Cameron and Isabel in later parts of their book (in the past). There is a lot of agreement between what was found.\n\nSome things about how young kids act during and after a stay in the hospital have also been written down. Some have been by doctors for kids: for example, in US country by Patrick and others (a long time ago); in EN country by Isaac and Henry (a long time ago); in JU country by Matthew (in the past); and in PO country by Bella and Oliver (in the past). Others have been done by people who study how people think and feel, and include a thing in SC country by Samuel about how kids under a year old acted when they went to the hospital and when they went home, and a big thing in CZ country by Liam and Matthew (in the past). A big book about hospitals was shared by Victor and his friends (1965).\n\nDifferent kids were studied in these books. They were different in age, where they live, where they go, the care they get, and how long they are away. They also differed in whether they are healthy or not. But, even with all these differences, the findings were very similar. If a child is older than six months, he tends to react in certain ways when he is separated from his mom. The ideas shared here are mostly based on the observations of Jack.\n\nJack watched how kids act in their second and third years of life when they stay in nurseries or hospitals for a short time and are cared for in the usual ways. This means the child is taken away from his mom and other familiar people and places and is cared for in a strange place by new people. He also watched how the child acted at home in the months after coming back and heard reports from his parents.\n\nIn this situation, a child of fifteen to thirty months who has a good relationship with his mom and has not been away from her will usually show a certain pattern of behavior. This can be divided into three parts based on how he feels about his mom. We call these parts Protest, Sadness, and Letting go. Even though we are separating them clearly here, in reality they blend into each other, so a child may be changing from one part to another or going back and forth between two parts for days or weeks.\n\nThe first part, protest, might start right away or might be delayed; it lasts from a few hours to a week or more. During this time the young child is very upset about losing his mom and tries to get her back with everything he can do. He might cry loudly, shake his bed, move around a lot, and look for any sign that his mom might be coming back. All his actions show that he strongly expects her to return. In the meantime, he often doesn't like other people who try to do things for him, though some children will hold on to a nurse very tightly.\n\nDuring the second part, sadness, the child still misses his mom a lot, but he seems to be losing hope. He moves around less or stops moving, and he might cry in a boring way or off and on. He is quiet and doesn't do much, doesn't want anything from others, and seems very sad. This is a quiet time, and sometimes, people think he is feeling better, but that's not true.\n\nWhen the child starts to show more interest in things around him, people think it's a sign he is getting better. The child doesn't push away the helpers anymore; he takes the care, food, and toys they give, and might even smile and be friendly. Some people think this change is good. But when his mom visits, it's clear that things aren't okay, because he doesn't act the way a child his age normally would. He doesn't seem to recognize his mom; he doesn't want to be close to her and he seems uninterested; instead of crying, he just turns away. It seems like he doesn't care about her anymore.\n\nIf he stays in the hospital or nursery for a long time and gets used to the helpers leaving and coming, he will start to act like he doesn't care about people. After being sad about losing several people he cared about, he will stop trusting new people and will stop caring about anyone. He will start to only care about himself and, instead of caring about people, he will only want things like sweets, toys, and food. A child who lives in a place like this will stop being upset when helpers change or leave. He won't show feelings when his parents visit; and it might hurt them when they see that, even though he likes the gifts they bring, he doesn't care about them as special people. He will seem happy and okay with his strange situation and easy and not scared of anyone. But this friendliness is not real: he doesn't seem to care about anyone anymore.\n\nWe had some trouble finding the right word to describe this time. In the beginning, we called it 'denial'. But that caused problems, so we started calling it 'detachment'. Another word could be 'withdrawal'; but this word could make people think of a child who doesn't do anything and stays away from the world, which is not what usually happens. Also, 'withdrawal' is often used in a way that we don't want to use it. 'Detachment' doesn't have these problems, and it is a good opposite to 'attachment'.\n\nIt is clear that many things can change how a child reacts and what their reaction looks like. For example, a child who is alone a lot and stays in their bed a lot will protest more; but a child who is in a familiar place and is taken care of by one person who is like a mom will be less upset. Things that seem to make the reaction less strong are having a brother or sister, even a very young one, or being taken care of by one person who is like a mom, especially if the child has met her before when his real mom was there. \n\nOne thing that is often linked with more upset, both during the time apart and after coming back home, is how long a child's time apart is. This was very clear in a study and it is something that almost all other people who study this also say.\n\nEven though there is strong evidence that the most important thing that changes the behavior we have been talking about is not having the familiar mom-figure, not everyone agrees with this. Instead, they think other things are to blame. Some of the things that have been suggested are: a strange place, the condition of the mom, and the kind of relationship a child has had with his mom before. So, it is suggested that in many of the studies reported the child is not only being taken care of by strange people but also in a strange place; that when a healthy child is sent to a place to live it is often because his mom is going to the hospital to have a new baby; and that many other children go to this place because things at home are not good. Could the behavior, therefore, not be because of loss of mom but because of the strange environment, or expecting a rival, or a not good relation with mom before?\n\nIf these objections were important, the case for thinking that being apart is important would fall apart. There is, however, strong evidence about the impact of each type of thing and in no case does it support the people who doubt. Let's think about it.\n\nEven though in many studies, including those of a person, the children are faced not only with strange people but with a strange place also, there are some studies in which this does not happen. One is the study by two people already mentioned. The babies whose behavior led one person to describe the 'sadness' stayed in the same place during the absence of mom. Not only so, but, if it happened within three months, only one change was needed to make them feel like before\u2014the return of mom.\n\nTwo other reports confirm that, whatever effects change of place may have, a main thing is always not having the mom-figure. One is a report by a person of a little boy who was taken care of by nannies because his mom was working. When he was only two, his first caretaker left and a new one came. Even though he stayed at home and his mom was there every night, he acted differently when his usual caretaker left. The night she left, he cried a lot, couldn't sleep, and wanted his mom to stay with him. The next day, he didn't want the new caretaker to feed him, and he became messy again. For the next four nights, his mom had to stay with him and tell him she loved him, and he still acted differently during the day. It wasn't until the sixth day that he started to act more like himself, but it took nine days for him to fully be himself again. Even though it was clear he missed his usual caretaker, he never said her name and didn't want to talk about her not being there.\n\nThere is a similar story about another little boy about the same age who lived in a place in IS country and his parents were gone for several weeks. In this case, the boy stayed in his usual place with his usual caretaker and friends. But, as his mom tells it, he was very upset when his parents were gone.\n\nWe just got back to our home. Our being away was very hard for Yosef. The caretaker tells me that many nights he didn't sleep. One night, the guard found him standing in front of our door, sucking his thumb. When his dad, who came back a week before me, got home, Yosef didn't want him to leave in the evening and cried when he did leave. When I got back, Yosef didn't know who I was, and he ran to his dad. Now, when I leave him in the evening, he always asks me: 'You're never going to leave me again, right?' He's very scared about being left alone again. He started sucking his thumb... I have to stay with him at night until he falls asleep.\n\nYosef was also mad when his dad went on a trip later. Now a little older, Yosef told his mom: 'Dad went to TE city. All the kids will be very mad at my dad.' His mom asked if _he_ was mad at his dad, and he said: 'All the kids will be mad at Dad.'\n\nThis shows that how a kid acts can't just be blamed on a change of place. Sure, a new place matters, but what matters more to a kid is if his mom is there or not. This is backed up by how a kid acts when he's in a new place but his mom is with him.\n\nFamily trips show us how kids act in new places when they are with their mom. Some kids, especially the ones in their second year, may feel a bit scared in new places; but usually, as long as their mom is there, they don't stay scared for long. Most young kids even like family trips because they get to see new things.\n\nWe can also see this when we look at how kids act in the hospital.\n\nThere are now many studies that show that, when a kid goes to the hospital with his mom, he doesn't act scared or upset like a child who is there alone. One story is about a little girl of two, which was recorded on film. There are also stories from doctors, who have seen how much better a child acts when his mom is with him in the hospital. One doctor tells a story about a little girl aged thirteen months who was in the hospital for a sickness:\n\nAlice was healthy and well cared for. She was brought to the hospital without her mother and was alone for a few days. She was very quiet all the time and didn't want to eat, but she only cried in her sleep. During check-ups she didn't struggle. I tried to get her to sit up but she just laid back down.\n\nOn the third day her mother came. The moment she saw her mother the child got up and started to cry. Then she calmed down and was very hungry. After eating she started to smile and play. When I saw her the next day I could hardly believe it was the same child, she was so different. She was smiling in her mother's arms, not sleeping like I thought she would be. It was hard to believe that a child who had been so sad and had slept so much could become so happy overnight. Everything made her happy and she smiled at everyone.\n\nThere are many other stories like this, including those written by parents.\n\nAnother study of thirty children who had their mom with them in the hospital and of a group of children who were in the hospital alone (though visited daily) shows the same thing. When the children who were alone in the hospital went home after a few days, they acted like young children who have been in a strange place without their mom: they were more clingy, got upset more easily during any further brief separation, had accidents more often. The children who had their mom with them in the hospital, on the other hand, didn't act this way.\n\nBeing in a new place is not the main reason why a child feels sad when they are away from their mom. But if mom is not there, the child will feel sadder. We talk more about this in the next book.\n\nHaving a new baby brother or sister does not make a big difference either. We know this because children who don't have a mom that is going to have a baby also feel sad when they are away from their mom. We looked at how 13 kids with moms who were going to have a baby and 5 kids with moms who were not going to have a baby acted in the first two weeks they were away from their mom. We did not see any big differences.\n\nLastly, there is no proof that only kids who do not get along with their mom feel sad when they are away from her. In our studies, some of the kids who felt very sad had a good relationship with their mom. Some of the best facts about this come from a study. In this study, a lady named Isabel visited the homes of the kids who were away from their mom. She got to know the families and saw how the child and mom got along. The relationships were different - some were good, some were just okay. Even though the people doing the study thought they would see different reactions based on how good the relationship was, they did not. They found that kids who did not miss their mom when they were away from her usually did not have a good relationship with her. Or in other words, the more a child loves their mom, the sadder they are when they are away from her.\n\nBased on all of this, we think it is safe to say that the main reason why a child feels sad when they are away from their mom is because they miss her. This brings up some questions. Why does a child feel so sad just because they miss their mom? Why does the child worry about losing their mom again after they come back home? What is going on in the child's mind when they feel this way and when they start to not feel anything? Most importantly, how can we understand why a child loves their mom so much? These are the questions we try to answer in these books. But before we start, we need to talk about how we understand how a child acts based on their instincts instead of how Freud thought about it. The movie is named \"RO (1952)\".\n\nIt's important to know that in two main studies about children in the hospital, by Ryan and Samuel, a child who was really sick was not included. Most of the children were there either to find out what was wrong with them or for a small operation.\n\nIn this book, we often talk about 'mother' and not 'mother-figure', we mean the person who takes care of a child and who the child loves. For most children, that person is their real mother.\n\nWhen quoting this report, a few small changes have been made, so we don't use real names.\n\nA report by Ulysses (1965) suggests that young children who get upset during family trips are often children who had a hard time breathing when they were born.\n\nPart II\n\nNATURAL BEHAVIOUR\n_Chapter 3_\n\nNatural Behaviour: A Different Idea\n\nI am not sure if we can really understand and classify natural behaviors by just thinking about our thoughts. This thinking process actually calls for the use of specific ideas about natural life, and it would be good if these ideas could come from another field and be used in psychology.\n\nSAMUEL (1915a)\n\nThere's nothing more important in psychology than a solid theory about natural behaviors. But, nothing like that exists...\n\nSAMUEL (1925)\n\nBeginning\n\nIN THE LAST 50 YEARS since Samuel wanted a good theory of natural behaviors and was sad he couldn't find one, there's been a lot of progress. Many fields have helped with this progress. A big step forward has been made by studying nature and how things work, which have helped us understand the basic principles of behavior that helps us survive and reach our goals. Using this big step forward have been three sciences based on experiments: studying animal behavior, experimental psychology, and studying the brain\u2014Samuel's first love. Each of these three fields started in their own special way and have their own special interests, methods, and ideas; and so, it's no surprise that for a while they didn't really understand each other. Recently, though, they've started to understand each other's work better and have seen how they can all contribute in their own special way and how they work really well together. What used to be a problem has become a strength\u2014and finally the principles of a unified science of behavior are starting to show.\n\nEven the behavior of the simplest animals is very complex. Things can be different between different kinds of animals, and even between different animals of the same kind. For example, a big dog can act different from a little dog. Also, how an animal acts can change as it grows up, and it can even change from season to season, day to day, or minute to minute. But, there are some things that animals always do. These things are so important that we call them 'instincts'. Even if we use this word, we don't really know why animals do these things. We just know that they do them.\n\nThere are four things that we usually see when animals do something because of their instincts:\n\n  1. Almost all animals of the same kind do it in the same way;\n  2. It is not just a simple reaction to something, but a series of actions that usually happen in the same way;\n  3. It is usually something that helps the animal survive or helps make sure there will be more animals of the same kind in the future;\n  4. Animals usually do it even if they have not learned it from other animals.\n\nIn the past, people often argued about whether animals do these things because they are born knowing how to do them, or because they learn them from other animals. Now, we know that it is not one or the other. It is like how the size of a box depends on both its length and its width. Everything that an animal does is because of both what it is born with and what it learns from its surroundings.\n\nHere, we will use words that a man named Henry used. If something is not changed a lot by the surroundings, we call it 'stable'. If it is changed a lot by the surroundings, we call it 'changeable'. Things like eye color and the shape of arms and legs are 'stable'. Things like how much an animal weighs and the color of a lizard's skin are 'changeable'. There are lots of things that are somewhere in between 'stable' and 'changeable'.\n\nBehavior that we often call natural happens the same way in the same surroundings, or at least as long as the place stays the same where the animal usually lives. In such a place, it looks the same in all the animals of the same kind, and so we often say it's 'typical for the species'.\n\nPeople sometimes argue if humans have any behavior that we can call natural. Some say that human behavior changes a lot; it's different in different cultures; nothing like the stable and predictable ways of other animals can be seen. I don't agree with this view. Human behavior changes a lot, that's true, but not with no limit; and, even though there are big cultural differences, some common things can be seen. For example, even with obvious changes, the ways humans act, which are often very strong, that lead to having babies, taking care of babies and young children, and the bonding of young ones to parents are seen in nearly all humans and seem best thought of as parts of some common plan and, since they help with survival, as examples of natural behavior. Because we must remember that in all higher animals, not just humans, natural behavior is not the same movement but a unique act by a specific individual in a specific place\u2014yet an act that still follows some known pattern and that usually leads to some expected result that helps the individual or the species. It's not just for humans but for all higher animals, including birds, that a theory of natural behavior based on the idea of the same movement is not good enough.\n\nThose who argue against the idea that humans have behavior that is the same as what in other animals we call natural have a big job to prove their point. When it comes to human body and body functions a connection in structure with that of other species is undeniable. When it comes to his behavior, the connection may be less obvious, but if there was no connection at all everything we know about human evolution would be wrong. What is much more likely than no connection is, therefore, that the basic structure of human behavior is like that of other animals but has changed in a way during evolution that lets the same goals be reached by a much wider range of ways. The Romans could get to YO city by a few ways; today we can choose from hundreds. The ancient SA language gave only limited ways of talking; its modern versions give astonishing, seemingly endless, variety. But in each case the structure of the modern tool, whether roads or language, is based on and comes from the ancient structure. The old form is not replaced: it is changed, made more complex, and added to but it still decides the overall pattern. This is how I see natural behavior in humans. We think that some parts of our mind come from simpler parts that are also found in other animals. We think these simpler parts got bigger and more complex in some areas. \n\nBut what do these simpler parts look like? What kind of system can we think of that, in simpler forms, can explain how a fish acts, that in more complex forms can explain how birds and mammals act, and that, in the most complex forms, can explain how people act? Looking for these simpler parts is like looking for a simple hip bone when you start with the complex hip bone of a horse.\n\nModels from a thing called control theory can help us understand these simpler parts of how we act. Control theory has grown a lot in the past 25 years and has already been very helpful in understanding how our bodies work. Even though it's too early to think that this theory can solve all of our questions about how we act, it has already been helpful in understanding simple movements and it promises to help us understand more complex actions.\n\nWhen we talk about ideas from control systems theory, we will start with the simplest systems and move to the more complex ones. This will help us first understand the basic parts of this kind of system and then see how a simple design can become more complex and more well-suited to what it needs to do. But this way of explaining things also has a downside. It means that the systems we first talk about are so simple that some people might not think they can help us understand how people act. We hope other readers will be more patient.\n\nLet's first consider some basic parts of these special systems known as control systems. The two parts we will start with have to do with the old problem of purposefulness and the new idea of feedback.\n\nIn the past, saying that animals have a purpose or that people act on purpose would make you an outsider in the world of science. But the development of increasingly sophisticated control systems, like the ones that guide a homing missile, has changed that. Now, it's accepted that a machine with feedback can have a real goal. So now, saying that behavior has a purpose and thinking in terms of goals is not only common sense, as it always was, but also good science.\n\nThe special part that allows a machine to act with a purpose, in the sense of reaching a pre-set goal in many different ways, is feedback. This is like a process where the results of doing something are always sent back to a main control part. This part then looks at what the machine was first told to do, and what it has done so far, and decides what the machine should do next. This helps the machine to get better at doing what it was told to do. It's like a runner who wants to run very fast, and uses a watch to see how fast they run each lap, and then tries to run faster next time.\n\nThe easiest type of control system is a regulator, which keeps something the same. A good example is a room temperature controller, which keeps the room at a set temperature. To do this, the system is made so that it always compares the actual temperature with the set temperature. To make this comparison, the system needs a set temperature and information about the actual room temperature. This information comes from a thermometer, and the readings are sent back to be compared with the set temperature.\n\nA regulator can be a very simple device like a room temperature controller that just turns on heat when the temperature falls below the set level, and turns it off when the temperature rises above that level. But a simple device like this can have problems. If the outside temperature falls suddenly, the room temperature may also fall quickly and the system will take time to adjust. And if the room temperature rises above the set temperature, the system can't make it lower. To solve these problems and to make a system that keeps the temperature closer to the set temperature, we can make the system more complex. For example, when the temperature rises, the controller could not only turn off the heat but also turn on cooling. When the temperature drops, the system could take into account not just that the actual temperature is below the set temperature, but also by how much, and act so that the more the temperature is off, the more heat is turned on, and vice versa. Also, it could consider not just the actual temperature difference, but also how fast the difference is changing. And to make sure that the temperature is kept exactly right, all the machinery could be doubled or tripled, using perhaps similar but not the same processes; for example, heating could use oil as well as electricity.\n\nThis description of a complex room temperature controller might seem very different from a description of how people behave naturally. But it is given here for two reasons: first, to introduce the ideas of setting (or instruction), set-goal, and feedback as they are used in control systems, and secondly, because we now know that systems designed like this are used a lot in our bodies. For example, to keep the amount of sugar in our blood at a constant level, a control system using all the parts we have talked about is at work. This tells us that living things need control systems to work properly. But the kind of control system we've talked about so far is simple and doesn't really explain how even the easiest actions work. This type of system only has one setting and tries to keep things as close to that setting as possible. A better type of control system for us to think about is one that changes its setting over and over again. A good example of this is when you steer a car. When you turn the steering wheel, you're telling the car where you want the front wheels to go and the car's job is to make sure the wheels go there. When you turn the steering wheel again, you change where you want the wheels to go, and the car has to make sure the wheels go to the new place. \n\nSo far, all the control systems we've talked about are set by a person. For example, a person decides what temperature a thermostat should be set to, or where the front wheels of a car should go. But it's possible to design a control system that gets its settings from another system. For example, the system that controls an anti-aircraft gun can get its settings from a radar that tracks planes. The radar can also guess where the plane is going to be in the future. This way, the gun is always pointed in the right direction to hit the plane. \n\nWe think we have systems like this in our bodies. These systems help us hit a moving tennis ball or help a bird catch another bird in flight. The goal of hitting the ball or catching the bird is the set-goal of the system.\n\nControl systems and actions\n\nAt this point, the idea of a control system is starting to explain how simple actions work. The way a bird catches another bird in flight is a good example of an action. Every bird does it in a way that we can recognize, they don't need to learn how to do it, and it helps them survive. Even if we don't fully understand how a baby bird learns how to do everything, it's not too hard to imagine. It's a bit like how our body learns to work. Just like our heart knows how to pump blood to all parts of our body, a bird learns how to act in different situations. Sometimes, a bird can act differently from other birds of the same kind. For example, a bird that usually makes its home in trees might make its home on a cliff if there are no trees. A sheep that usually likes to be with other sheep might like to be alone if it grows up away from other sheep. This shows that even though a bird or a sheep usually acts in a certain way, it can change its behavior depending on where it grows up. \n\nEven ants, which usually know who is a friend and who is an enemy, need to learn this. If ants grow up with ants of a different kind, they will think these ants are friends and ants of their own kind are enemies. The way a creature acts is not something it is born with. What it is born with is the ability to learn how to act in different ways depending on where it grows up.\n\nIn simple words, different animals behave differently depending on where they live. Some animals, like lions and monkeys, change their behavior a lot depending on where they are. But even within one kind of animal, different behaviors might change more or less. To stay alive, animals need a good mix of behaviors that change and behaviors that stay the same. If an animal's behaviors don't change at all, they can be ready right away. But if they can change, it might take longer to be ready. However, being able to change can also make the animal better at living in its home. But, it can also lead to strange things, like a goose falling in love with a dog house. No matter if the behaviors can change or not, it's important to remember that no animal can live everywhere.\n\nWe need to understand that how an animal behaves can only help it stay alive and have babies if it lives in the right place. Like, a whale is great at living in the ocean, but not so good on land. A cow can eat lots of grass, but not meat. In the same way, an animal's behavior can be perfect for one place but not good for another. Birds can't have babies if there are no holes to build nests. Moths will fly into fire if there's no other light. In all these cases, the animal can't live because it's in a place it's not used to.\n\nWhen people make things, they think about where it will be used. With animals, how they are built depends on where they have lived while changing over time. Usually, this is the same place they will live in the future. So, every system, whether made by people or animals, is made for a specific place. I will call this place the 'home of the system'. Only in the right place can something work really well. If it's not in the right place, it might not work at all, or it might work in a weird or bad way. \n\nWe need to know that every animal and every part of an animal needs the right place to work well. Like a cat's heart and blood system will work well in a certain amount of air and heat; a monkey or a person's heart and blood system might need a little different air and heat to work well. In the same way, the way a mommy animal takes care of her babies will work in certain places and not others, and these places will be different for different animals.\n\nUnderstanding how animals change to live better is hard. It's even harder when we think about how animals behave, and it's the hardest when we think about people. Because of this, this book talks a lot about the 'right place'.\n\nAll the things animals do by nature usually help them live in their right place, but every thing they do is for a different part of that right place. Some things they do bring them to a certain home and keep them there; some things make them eat certain foods; and some things make them interact with other animals of their kind in special ways. Sometimes, the animal can tell it's in the right place because of something simple, like a flashing light; but most of the time, it needs to see a pattern. In all these cases, we think, the animal has a copy of that pattern in its brain and acts in special ways when it sees a matching pattern in the world and different ways when it doesn't see that pattern.\n\nSometimes, how the pattern is made in the brain doesn't change much with different places, like when a female duck knows and reacts to a male duck with a green head, even if she has never seen a male duck before; but other times, the pattern that is reacted to in special ways can change a lot with the place, especially depending on the place the animal was in at a certain time in its life. A little goose can learn to follow something that moves. After it learns to follow, it changes how it acts when it's scared. It will always follow what it learned, and if it can't find it, it will look until it does. People can make things that act like this, and they are getting better at it because they know more now.\n\nAnimals can learn about where they live. They can make a map in their mind. Even little rats in a lab will not run in a maze until they know more about where they are. Bigger animals, like dogs and monkeys, can learn so much about where they live that they can find the fastest way to a place like a house or trees from anywhere. People are the best at this. They can make a very good map in their mind of the world. They can make good guesses about what will happen because they use science.\n\nTo reach a goal, an animal needs to be able to see special parts of where it lives and use that to make a map in its mind. It needs to be able to move and do things too.\n\nAnimals can do things because they have bodies that can move and systems in their bodies that tell them what to do. This helps them live and have babies.\n\nAnimals can take care of their babies and keep their home safe for a long time. This means they can move in different ways like walking, running, swimming, and flying. They can also do special things like singing, scaring other animals, and fighting. They can do these things in an order that helps them and their family stay alive.\n\nBirds need to do a lot of things to have babies. This is what they need to do: The boy bird finds a place to live and a place to build a nest; the boy bird keeps other boy birds away; the boy bird gets a girl bird to like him; the boy bird and/or girl bird build a nest; they become a couple; the girl bird lays eggs; the boy bird and/or girl bird sit on the eggs to keep them warm; they feed their babies; they keep dangerous animals away. All these things are hard and each bird has to do many different things, like singing or building a nest. But they need to do everything at the right time and in the right order so that they can have babies most of the time. How do we think all this happens? What rules do they follow to do all these things?\n\nTo answer these questions, we need to think about how birds behave and how different birds can work together. But first, we need to understand some words, like 'adaptation', 'adapted', and 'environment of adaptedness', and how they relate to people.\n\n_Adaptation: system and environment_\n\n_Adaptation and Adaptedness_\n\nIn the last part, we said that nothing can work perfectly in every situation. This means that when we think about how something works, we also need to think about where it works. This place is called the system's environment of adaptedness. For something a person made, the environment of adaptedness is where it was made to work. For something in nature, it's where it slowly changed to work best. That's why we sometimes call the environment of adaptedness for something a person made its environment of _designed_ adaptedness and for something in nature its environment of _evolutionary_ adaptedness.\n\nNow, let's think more about how living things adapt.\n\nThere are many reasons why it's hard to understand adaptation and adaptedness. One reason is that the words\u2014adapt, adapted, adaptation\u2014can mean different things. Another reason is that living things adapt in unusual ways, and it's hard to understand how. A third reason, when we talk about people, is that people can change their surroundings to suit them. Let's think step by step:\n\nFirst, let's think about being suited for something and then, how we become suited for it.\n\nTo say something is suited for a job, we need: (i) a thing; (ii) a job that needs to be done; (iii) a place where the thing does the job. When the thing can do the job in that place, we say it is suited for that place. So being suited is all about the thing; but we also need to think about the job and the place.\n\nBecoming suited means the thing changes. There are two ways this can happen. First, the thing can change so it can do the same job in a different place. Second, the thing can change so it can do a different job in the same or a similar place.\n\nWe use the word 'suited' to talk about both the change and the state of being suited. To make it less confusing, let's call the state of being suited 'suitedness' (Weiss, 1949); hence 'place of evolutionary suitedness'. Let me give you an example.\n\nLet's think about a small car that is good for driving in LO city. This means that the car, as a machine, can do a job - taking people around - in a certain city. It can do this because of its size, speed, how fast it can stop and turn, and so on. These things not only need to be in certain ranges but also need to work well together. The car has been made specially for LO city.\n\nWe don't know if the car will be good for other places. Every new place that is different from LO city is a new question. Will the car be good on big roads? on mountain roads? in very cold places? in very hot places? Clearly, to be good in all these different places, the car would need many things that it doesn't need in LO city, and maybe even things that would be bad in LO city. So it wouldn't be surprising if a car that's good for LO city was bad in one or more of the other places. Until we know more, it's smart to think that the car is only suited for LO city.\n\nBut, the car could be changed to be good in one of these different places. If that happens, the car would go through changes so it becomes suited to the new place, which would then be its new place of suitedness. Changes can happen in many ways to fit into new places. So far, we've talked about one kind of change: making a thing able to do the same job, like moving, in different places. But, changes can also happen in other ways. For example, we could change a car so that it makes electricity instead of moving people around. This would be a different job for the car, maybe in the same place as before.\n\nChanging to fit into a new place and changing to do a new job are not the same thing, but we often call both of them \"changes\". This can be confusing.\n\nAnother problem is that sometimes, a thing can do its job better if we change the place where it works, not the thing itself. To avoid more confusion, I will call these changes \"modifications\". So, \"changes\" will only mean changes in the thing itself.\n\nTo understand this better, let's think about a small car. Let's say the car slips on the streets of LO city. We could fix this in two ways: change the car, like its tires, or change the place, like the road. The first is called changing the car, the second is modifying its place.\n\nNow, let's think about living things and their changes.\n\n_Changes in Living Things_\n\nIt's clear that animals and plants are very complicated and perfect for living in a special place. The more we study a living thing, the more we see that almost everything about it is changed to help it and its family survive in that place. A famous person named David showed this by studying flowers. He found that each type of flower is changed to attract a certain bug. When the same bug visits different flowers, it helps the flower seeds grow. These studies showed, first, that how living things are built makes sense only if we think about how they live in their special home; and, second, that once we understand that staying alive is the goal of all living things, features that have looked only pretty or strange or funny start to make sense: each feature helps, or has helped, the living thing to stay alive in its home.\n\nDavid said that what was true of the parts of a flower was also true of how animals act. In a chapter of a famous book, he says that each type of animal has its own special ways of behaving just like it has its own special body, and reminds us that 'how animals behave is as important as their bodies for the good of each type of animal'. In the words we're using in this chapter, this would be 'ways of behaving that work well in an animal's home are as necessary as the body parts for that animal to stay alive'.\n\nSo David and the people who came after him made the big discovery that the goal of all the parts of a living thing is just to stay alive. While things people make can have many different goals\u2014moving things, making power, fun, shelter, and so on\u2014for living things the goal is always the same\u2014namely, staying alive. So, when we're thinking about how well a plant or animal fits into a particular home, the question is whether or not its body is such that it can stay alive there. When it can, we say that the plant or animal is well suited to that home; when it can't, we say they are not well suited.\n\nUntil David's time, and even later, it was very hard to understand how a plant or an animal can be so well suited to its home that it achieves the goal that it clearly does achieve. For a long time, people thought that maybe something magical was happening, or that things were happening for a reason. Now, a hundred years after David suggested the answer, we think the problem is solved. How well a plant or animal fits into its home, whether we're talking about its body, how it works, or how it behaves, is seen as the result of nature's way of picking out, in a particular home, the plants or animals that reproduce the best, and therefore stay around, and at the same time getting rid of the plants or animals that reproduce less well.\n\nThough we've been thinking this way about the bodies and workings of animals for a long time, it's only more recently that we've also been thinking this way about how they behave. We have the people who study animal behavior to thank for this. Darwin, the father of studying animal behavior, said that every type of animal has its own special behaviors, just like they each look different and have different body parts. People who study animals try to understand why animals act the way they do to help them survive in their home place. They have learned a lot about animal behavior this way. This book says we need to do the same thing to understand how people naturally act.\n\n_What Does It Mean to Adapt?_\n\nIn the old days, people were not sure what part of nature changes to help animals survive. Some thought it was the whole type of animal, like all dogs or all birds. Some thought it was smaller groups of animals that have babies together. Some thought it was groups of animals that live together, like ant colonies or herds of animals.\n\nBut now, people think those ideas are wrong. They think it's all about the tiny parts inside every living thing, called genes. Some genes become more common because they help animals have more babies. These babies also have those helpful genes and can have more babies themselves. So, the genes keep getting passed on. This means an animal is well adapted if it can survive and have lots of babies. It can also help by helping its family members survive and have babies, because they likely have the same helpful genes.\n\nEven though the most important thing is for the genes to survive and get passed on, it can be easier to think about how well an animal is adapted by looking at how well it can do certain things. We can think about how good a body system works in different places. Like, how well your blood moves in your body or how well your body keeps away sickness. We can also think about how good animals find food in different places. (Like, birds find lots of bugs to eat in the summer, but not in the winter.) But, these things only help the animal right now. The real goal is always to keep the animal's genes alive.\n\nBooks to Read\n\nIf you want to learn more, you can read these books.\n\nThere's a book by SO that talks about how animals change to live in different places. He explains why some things in nature make us think they have a purpose.\n\nFor how control works in living things, you can read books by BA, GR, and a book by YO and CA. They talk about how living things control their bodies.\n\nFor how control works in how animals behave, you can read a book by YO. He explains the brain like how an engineer would explain a machine. You can also read a book by MF about how animals react to things.\n\nFor how the idea of 'plan' can be used to understand how people behave, you can read a very good book by MI, GA, and PR.\n\nThe idea of natural selection is explained well by WI in his book. He shows how social behavior in animals can be understood in terms of gene selection. DA also wrote a popular book about this idea. WI's book is also very detailed and interesting, but some people didn't like what he said about how people behave socially.\n\nA lot of the ideas in this and the next chapters come from HI's book. He talks about the work and ideas of ethology and comparative psychology. There are some books that tell us about how animals behave. One of them is by Henry. Others are a book about instincts by Thomas, a book about learning in animals by Liam, and a book about animals in zoos by Henry. \n\nIn Chapter 8, there's a part that talks more about some big words we use.\n\nWhen we talk about how things work, we use words like 'instruction' and 'goal'. But these are not the usual words. Engineers who work with control systems usually say 'command signal' for 'instruction' and 'equilibrium level' for 'goal'. You can find out why we use these words in the parts about 'Types of Behavioural System' (Chapter 5) and 'Problems of Terminology' (Chapter 8).\n\nHenry (a different one) also talks about how animals grow. As they get bigger, they need to change how they see and hear because their eyes and ears get further apart. They also need to change how they move because their bones get longer. These changes happen because of what the animal learns as it moves around. If they didn't happen this way, the animal would need to have a lot more information in its genes.\n\nSome very simple animals like protozoa and coelenterates don't seem to be able to do this, but insects definitely can (Peter, 1965).\n\nI've chosen to use the words 'adapt' and 'modify' in a specific way, even though people usually use them to mean the same thing.\n\n_Chapter 4_\n\nOur World\n\nIn the last chapter, we talked about how things work best in the place they're used to. This means that when we think about how humans behave, we first need to think about the world they're used to living in. This is a bit tricky.\n\nHumans are really good at doing lots of different things and coming up with new ideas. Because of this, they've been able to live in all sorts of places, from very hot to very cold. They've even changed these places to make new environments. These changes have led to a lot more people in the world. But they also make it harder for us to define what the human's natural world is like.\n\nWe should remember that we are trying to understand how people behave naturally. We know people can do many different things and change the world around them, but that's not what we are looking at right now. Instead, we are looking at how people behave in a normal, unchanged world. We are trying to understand how this behavior came to be. So, what kind of world would cause this behavior?\n\nFor most animals, the place they live does not change a lot. Because of this, animals today live in a world much like the one they have always lived in. This world is well suited to their behavior. For people, this is not true. People live in many different places now. Also, the world has changed a lot because of people, and this has happened quickly. Nature takes a long time to change things, so we know that the world people live in now is not the world that made their natural behavior.\n\nThis means that the world we should think about is the one people lived in for a very long time, before the world started to change a lot. This old world is probably the one that made people behave the way they do naturally. This does not mean the old world was better or people were happier. It just means that this old world was the one that shaped people's natural behavior. We can say that people's natural behavior is probably best suited to this old world.\n\nSo, how does people's natural behavior fit into all the other places people live now? This is a new question. It's like asking if a small car made for city streets is also good for other places. People might think that all of our behaviors are good for now and also for when people lived a long time ago. But this might not be true. We need to learn more to know the answer.\n\nSome might say that not just humans, but other animals too, change where they live to make it better for them. Like birds build nests, rabbits dig holes, and beavers make dams. But these changes are because of their natural behaviors and are not big changes. So, there is a balance between these animals and where they live. The changes that humans make are different. They are not because of natural behaviors but because of what we learn from others. Also, in the past few hundreds of years, because of new things we made, the way we live changes very fast. So, the relationship between humans and where we live is not stable.\n\nSo, even if it is very important to know if our behaviors are good for where we live now, especially in cities, this book is not about that. This book is about basic reactions that come from a long time ago. What is important here is that if our behaviors are good for where we lived a long time ago, we can only understand them by knowing about that time. Like Darwin could only understand a flower when he knew about the insects that visited it, we can only understand human behavior when we know about where it came from. For this, we need to look at studies of human groups living in simple conditions, studies of early humans, and studies of big monkeys.\n\nNow, not many people get their food only by hunting and gathering, and we do not have many stories about their life. But what we do know is that all of them live in small groups with men, women, and children. Some groups are stable, and some change a lot. But in all groups, the bond between a mother and her children is always there and does not change.\n\nSome people who study humans have said that the basic social unit is the mother, father, and children. But Fox (1967) said that even though in all societies women and children are always with grown men, these men are not always the fathers or husbands. They can be father, uncle, or brother. This and other things made Fox think that the basic social unit is a mother, her children, and maybe her grandchildren. And how different societies change is in how much the fathers are part of this unit: in some societies they are always part of one unit, in others\u2014where a man can have more than one wife\u2014they are part of many units, and in others they are not part of a unit much at all, e.g. The free societies in the WE islands. If Adam is right, the parts of people's lives are very similar to those of our closest animal relatives.\n\nIt seems clear that the old way people lived can be compared with how other big animals that live on the ground live. There are differences between people and animals, but for this book, their similarities are also important, maybe even more so.\n\nAll big animals that live on the ground, including people, live in groups with both boys and girls, and all ages. Groups can be as small as one or two families or as big as two hundred people. Girls and young ones are never found without grown-up boys (except with some animals) and grown-up boys are rarely found alone. The group usually stays the same throughout the year, though it may split and come back together from time to time; only sometimes do people move from one group to another. Mostly, people spend their whole life close to other people they know.\n\nThe group lives in a place that can be a few square miles or a hundred or more, and, though there may be some overlap of places, each group tends to stay strictly within its own place. For animals, food is mostly plants but meat is eaten when it is available. People are unusual because meat is a bigger part of their food. However, there are few societies where meat is more than 25 per cent of the food, and in many it is a much lower part. The advantage of eating all kinds of food, including meat, is that it helps a species to live in conditions of temporary drought and so to extend the variety of places in which it can live.\n\nAlmost every kind of animal shares its place with a number of very dangerous animals and, to live, needs to be able to protect itself. In the case of the animals living on the ground, dangerous animals are the big cats (especially leopards), wolves and jackals, and birds that hunt. In protecting from these dangerous animals, the organized group of the ground animal plays a very important part. When the group is threatened, the grown-up boys, whether monkeys or men, work together to drive away the dangerous animal while the girls and young ones go away. So only people found alone are likely to be caught. By learning this way of protecting themselves, ground-living animals are able to live in many different places instead of being stuck to areas with the trees and cliffs that are needed for the protection of other animals.\n\nRelationships are very different in the animals living on the ground. In many animals, there is a lot of changing partners within a group, though even in some animals there are times when a pair stays together. People are special because girls can have babies all the time and usually, but not always, a family is made of a mommy and a daddy who stay together for a long time. Sometimes, a boy or a girl might move to a different group of people.\n\nThere are many things that make people special. Some of these things we can see in animals that live on the ground, and some of these things we can see in baby form in these animals. Things that we can see in animals and in people are: a lot of different sounds, poses, and signs that help them talk to each other; using tools; and being a baby for a long time to learn the ways of the group. Things that we can only see in people are: grown-up boys working together to hunt food, and making tools. The most special thing about people is talking. Other special things are having a safe home where sick people can stay all day, and sharing food. In people, boys and girls do different things, and grown-ups and children do different things too.\n\nThis small picture is mostly based on the work and books of William and David. It is thought to give a pretty good picture of how people lived before they learned to farm, and of animals that live on the ground and are related to people. In all of these groups, the group helps to keep them safe from animals that want to eat them: the group is most clear when a dangerous animal comes. This way, children can live a safe life while they learn the things they need to know when they are grown-up. A second thing the group does, but probably much later, is help to get food by hunting together.\n\nWe think about people's behaviour in this picture of how people lived a long time ago. A lot of this behaviour, it is thought, is made in a way that helps boys and girls, and children and grown-ups, to find their place in the group that is special to people.\n\nThe idea of 'how people lived a long time ago' that we talk about here is, of course, a version of Henry's idea of 'how people usually live' (Henry, 1939), but one that is defined more clearly in terms of how things change over time. The new term makes it even more clear that animals are made to live in special places and it makes us think about the fact that not a single thing about an animal's body, health, or behaviour can be understood or even talked about smartly except in relation to how that animal lived a long time ago. Given constant reference to how people lived a long time ago, the different ways in which people behave become, it is thought, much less hard to understand than they are when we ignore how people lived a long time ago. In the next parts, we will talk more about how a child and their mom connect. We will also talk more about where the first people might have lived and how we act today might have started from there. We think about how we feel when we lose something or someone in the same way.\n\n_Note_: If you don't want to know more about how we act without thinking, you can skip to Part III, 'How We Connect'.\n\n A long time ago, about two million years ago, the first people showed up. People only started farming about ten thousand years ago. So, for most of the time people have been around, we have lived in the wild. Even though we live in houses and cities now, we are still a lot like the first people.\n\n This is something Vickers (1965) talks about. He says that when people change the place they live using tools, there are more people. And when there are more people, we need to use more and better tools. Instead of making things stay the same, this is making things change more and more.\n\n An exception is the small people who live in the rain forests in AF country. Turnbull (1965) talks about how they live very well.\n\n For proof that the first people were hunted by big cats, see C. K. Brain (1970) in _Nature_ , **225,** 1112\u201319.\n\n Washburn (ed.), _The Social Life of Early Man_ (1961); DeVore (ed.), _Primate Behavior: Field Studies of Monkeys and Apes_ (1965); see also South-wick (ed.), _Primate Social Behavior_ (1963).\n\n_Chapter 5_\n\nHow We Act Without Thinking\n\nIn the 'thirties, we didn't think we could study how we act 'scientifically' unless we did some kind of experiment... Even poking an animal would surely be better than just looking at it: _that_ would lead to just telling stories: that was what birdwatchers did.\n\nBut that is also what the first people who studied how we act did. They looked at how animals acted in the wild, not in experiments, and were able to see how animals normally act for the first time...\n\nP. B. MEDAWAR (1967)\n\nTypes of how we act\n\nSO FAR IN this book, we have talked a lot about how we act that, in controlling how we act, are made to take note of differences between the first instruction and what is happening now, a comparison made possible by means of feedback: to such ways of acting only is the term goal-directed, or better, goal-corrected, applied. There are two reasons why we study behaviour. First, a lot of how we act, especially people, is because of systems we have learned. Second, understanding these systems has changed how we understand life. Not all systems are complicated. Some are simple. We should study the simple ones first before we look at the complicated ones.\n\n_Simple Actions_\n\nThere are simple systems that control simple actions. This is a way of moving that is structured and is like a reflex. But it is different from a reflex because it can change depending on the state of the animal. Examples are some of the movements used by birds when they build a nest, and many of the ways that birds and fish show off to each other that often get a predictable response from others of the same kind. As their name suggests, simple actions are very set and, once started, they usually finish no matter what else is happening. We can guess that the system responsible for a simple action works without needing any input from the environment.\n\nThe system that controls a simple action could follow one of two rules. One is for the system to depend entirely on a preset program in the brain; the other is for it to depend partly on a preset program, but also partly on feedback from the muscles, which tells the progress of the action and makes sure it goes as planned. We need more research to know which of these is more common.\n\nSimple actions can be as simple as yawning and sneezing, or as complicated as certain social displays in birds. Compared to birds, humans and other primates don't have as many of them. But they are interesting to people who study human behaviour because they control facial expressions, and are especially important in babies before they learn more complicated behaviours. Rooting, grasping, crying, and smiling when they first appear are probably all examples of simple actions and all play an important part in the earliest phases of social interaction. There are actions that animals do the same way each time. This shows us that even simple things can be done in a certain way. But it also helps us think about actions that can be changed and adapted.\n\nAn action that is more changeable than one that is the same each time happens when an animal combines a usual action with a simple set of movements that changes based on what is happening around it. A good example is a goose that has an egg roll out of its nest. The goose does two things when this happens. One thing is it puts its bill over the egg and pulls it towards itself. It keeps doing this even if the egg is taken away. The other thing is it moves its bill side to side to match the egg's movements. It only does this when it can feel the egg and stops when the egg is taken away. The real action, which is a mix of both things, is a little awkward, but if it does it enough times, it usually gets the egg back to the nest.\n\nThis helps us think about two big ideas: one is how actions are aimed at something and how that is done, the other is the idea of goals. Both of these ideas are hard to understand and have a lot of different names.\n\n_Two Kinds of Things We Can Guess Will Happen_\n\nThe first thing we have to figure out is if we should use the word 'goal' to talk about what we can guess will happen when the goose rolls the egg, which is the egg getting back to the nest. There are good reasons not to. This is easy to explain if we compare how the goose gets the egg back to the nest with how a bird catches its food.\n\nWhen a bird goes after its food, it changes how it moves based on what it sees. By using its eyes, the bird gets a lot of information that lets it compare where it is, how fast it's going, and where it's going to where the food is, and it changes how it flies based on that. The system that controls how the bird goes after its food is set up in a way that it keeps checking how well it's doing. The fact that it usually catches its food is because it keeps trying to do better.\n\nThe two systems that make the goose roll the egg are very different. The way the goose moves is not changed by seeing the nest and it doesn't check how well it's doing. In this job, the fact that the egg usually gets back to the nest is because the goose does the same action over and over and moves based on how it feels the egg, while it stays sitting on the nest. If a goose is not on its nest, the egg will be somewhere else, not on the nest.\n\nIn these two examples, what happens next can be guessed, but the reasons are different. In the example of a big bird hunting, it's like a football player aiming at the goal. But, the goose's actions are not the same. It's like a kid at a funfair who pays a small coin to walk blindfolded down a strange path. The kid doesn't know where he is going and doesn't have a goal. But, a person watching can guess what will happen\u2014maybe the kid will meet a pretty fairy (or something not as nice). This, and the example of the egg, show that you can guess what will happen even when there is no goal.\n\nIt's important to use the right words when talking about actions that have a goal and actions that don't. We need a good word for what happens at the end of goal-based actions. The word 'goal' might seem like a good choice, but it's not. It's often used to mean something in the world around us, and we need a word for something that is not that. We need a word that can mean both something that happens once, like catching prey, and something that goes on for a while, like keeping a certain distance from something.\n\nThat's why I propose the word 'set-goal'. A set-goal can be something that happens once or something that continues, brought about by actions that are designed to make sure instructions are followed correctly. In this definition, a set-goal is not something in the world around us. It can be a certain action, like singing a song, or keeping a certain relationship with something in the world, for a short or long time. The goal of a bird's fast dive is not to catch the food, but to get to the food. Just like this, the goal of some other ways animals act might be to keep a certain distance between themselves and something scary in their home.\n\nTo describe ways animals act that have goals, the word 'goal-directed' is useful. A better word, however, is 'goal-corrected'. First, it tells us that the way the animal acts is always being corrected based on the difference between what it is doing now and its goal. Secondly, it may help us remember that some of these ways of acting may have goals that last for a long time. Thirdly, it helps to keep ways of acting that have a goal different from ways of acting that are really focused on a place, though they may or may not be goal-corrected.\n\nTo talk about a thing that is a part of a goal the word 'goal-object' is sometimes useful.\n\nFrom what we have talked about, it will be seen that the more or less sure and good things that can happen because of different ways animals act can be of at least two types: goals and those that are not goals. For the latter there is no agreed word. Both types of result can, however, be referred to as 'predictable outcomes', as long as we understand that the prediction depends on a number of things and that, if these change, the prediction is not right. The word 'predictable outcome' must therefore always be read as short for 'conditionally predictable outcome'. Goals are one type of predictable outcome.\n\n_Goal-corrected Acting_\n\nIt is easy to think that the way a simple animal acts is goal-corrected when it is seen to do many different things before it finally gets some particular result. To reach a predictable result, however, is not a sign of goal-correctedness; as has been seen, such result can be reached in many other ways. What makes a goal-corrected system special is not that it reaches a predictable result but that it does so by a special process: from a big group of usual or different movements, the system picks movements in a not-random way and in such a way that they bring the animal closer to the goal. The more clever the process the more good the acting. Efficient goal-corrected acting is different, not necessarily in the sorts of acting used, but in the big number of starting-points from which the goal can be reached.\n\nNot surprisingly, a way of acting responsible for goal-corrected acting is much more complex than is one responsible for other acting. To reach a goal, you need: (a) a way to remember the goal, and (b) a way to check if you are doing it right and change if you are not.\n\nBefore we had computers, it was hard to think about how we could remember all the things we need to do something, and then use them when we need them. Now, it's easier to think about, even though it's very complicated and smart.\n\nBut it's still hard to think about how we learn these things. For a computer, we tell it what to do. But for us, we learn from being around things and doing things, and from what we are born with. And we learn in different ways.\n\nSometimes, when we are trying to do something, we only need to think about one thing. Like when a person is singing a note, they listen to themselves and make small changes to stay on the note. They only need to think about the sound they are making.\n\nBut most of the time, we need to think about more than one thing. Like when a bird is trying to catch something, it needs to think about what it looks like and how close it is. And it can think about these things in a simple or detailed way.\n\nBesides these things, we often also need to have a picture in our mind of where we are. This helps us to get from one place to another quickly. Like when a group of monkeys needs to run away quickly, they know where to go.\n\nEven though this picture is important for reaching some goals, not all goals need it. Some things we do don't need us to move around, so we don't need this picture. But some simple things we do still need this picture.\n\n_Keeping Space Over Time_\n\nPeople used to talk a lot about actions that have a big ending, like a big cheer, but didn't talk a lot about actions that keep going, like keeping a certain space for a long time. But, it's important to know that this type of action happens a lot and is very important for most animals. Examples are when a bird stays close to its eggs and nest for weeks, when an animal stays in a certain place for months or even years, and when an animal keeps a certain distance from a scary predator for minutes or hours.\n\nPeople didn't talk about this type of action because it's hard to understand with words like 'drive' or 'energy'. But, when we use other words, it's easier to understand.\n\nActions that keep a certain space over time could be simple or complex. A simple action could be moving towards a goal, and stopping when the goal is reached. This could lead to always staying close unless other actions lead to moving away from the goal. This could lead to some back-and-forths, as one action or another becomes stronger.\n\nAnother type of action could be keeping a certain distance from a goal. In this case, the goal is to keep a balance.\n\nIn Chapter 13, a simple action is used to explain why a young child stays close to their mom.\n\n_Direction of Actions_\n\nThe talk about goals has already touched on the direction of actions. Any action that involves moving and is controlled by goals is, of course, directed, both in terms of having a direction in space and in terms of having a goal. Since actions that don't have a goal can also have a direction in space, we need to talk about direction separately from goals. The word 'direction' just refers to the space in which the action happens, which is usually around things in the environment.\n\nSince all actions happen in space, all actions have some direction. Some actions seem to be directed randomly, but more often they are directed in a non-random way. Animals do things in many ways, some of which we can see.\n\nFor example, when a bird flies fast towards something it wants, it keeps its eyes on the goal. It's like a toy missile that knows where to go.\n\nIn other times, the animal does not move, but it turns its body or eyes towards something. It's like a machine that follows a flying plane. A frog catching a fly is a good example. The frog turns its head towards the fly and shoots out its tongue straight to catch it. It's like a man pointing a toy gun.\n\nSometimes, birds know where to go without looking at the goal. They look at things around them, like landmarks, sun, and stars. It's like a ship that uses a map to go to a place. The bird knows where its nest is because it remembers the things around it. If these things move, the bird can get lost. The same thing can happen to a ship if the markers in the water move.\n\nThere are also other ways that animals do things, but we have not talked about them here. To put it simply, we can do many things in different ways to reach the same end goal. This is a good thing about learning because it lets us understand important things like direction, end result, and goal.\n\nBut we haven't talked about what starts or stops a movement. We have only talked about the way movements are done and how they are done in a certain place and structured to reach the same end result. In the next part, we will talk about how different behaviors work together over time. After that, we will talk about how behaviors start and stop. We will see that understanding this brings up new things to think about, different from what we've talked about so far.\n\nGetting Different Behaviors to Work Together\n\nJust like there are many different types of behaviors, there are many different ways their activities can be made to work together.\n\nMaybe the easiest way to organize behavior that has to change in a certain way over time is by thinking of it like a chain, with each link being a behavior. When we do this, behavior happens in the right order because what one behavior does, when thought about, not only stops that behavior but also starts the next one in the chain. So, one activity stops and another starts.\n\nWhat the first activity does may be felt by the body or seen or heard or smelled, or all together. An example of a behavior that depends on feeling is walking. Here, the end of the first part of the back-and-forth action is felt and, when thought about, stops the first part of the movement and starts the second. But most of the more complicated and interesting instincts depend on seeing, hearing, and smelling. Many examples are given in books about animals. The actions of a bee looking for food is a good example: parts of the chain of responses have been found by doing experiments with models.\n\nThe collection of honey by a bee starts with seeing; when seeing a flower shape of color yellow or blue from far away, the bee flies towards it until it is very close. The next part in the chain is controlled by smell: when smelling something in a certain range the bee lands on the flower and explores its shape. The third part is controlled by touch: when feeling structures of a certain shape the bee starts to suck. Usually, this results in the collection of nectar. Bees know how to find food in a special way. They do one thing after another, and each thing they do helps them get closer to the food. But if something goes wrong, like if a flower doesn't smell right because of a spray, then the bee can't find the food and has to go somewhere else. This way of finding food only works if everything is just right.\n\nBut bees can also do things in different ways. If one way doesn't work, they can try another way. This is like having more than one path to the same place. So, even if something goes wrong, the bee can still find the food.\n\nSometimes, the things bees do can be very complex. For example, when birds build nests, they do many different things, and each thing has a goal. But they do these things in a certain order, like links in a chain.\n\nThere are other ways animals do things too. Sometimes, many things they do are caused by one thing, like a hormone in their body or something they see. This is called a \"hierarchy\". But understanding this requires knowing more about how animals behave, which will be explained later.\n\nThere is another way to organize things that can be more flexible. It's called a plan hierarchy. \n\nWhen we think about how people behave, we can think about a 'plan'. A 'plan' is like a big goal with smaller goals inside it. Not all the smaller goals need to be there, but the big goal is always there.\n\nThis idea helps us understand how some complicated behaviors can be arranged. The big goal is always there, and many of the smaller goals are likely to be there too.\n\nLet's think about a routine we all do in the morning. We get up, wash, dress, eat breakfast, and go to work. All these actions can be part of the bigger goal of 'getting to work'. But these actions can change order or be different\u2014like eating breakfast before dressing or skipping breakfast altogether. The big goal of 'getting to work' doesn't change even if the smaller actions change. The big difference from chain organization is that, in a chain, the whole thing doesn't have a goal, but in a plan, the whole thing does have a goal. Like getting to school is the goal of the plan. The whole thing is then thought of as being controlled by a big plan made to reach a long goal. The big plan is made up of smaller plans each with its own smaller goal, and each of the smaller plans is made up of even smaller plans, and so on right down to tiny plans that control the smallest parts of what we do. To get to school, the whole big plan must be done, but the smaller plans that make it up can, a little bit, be changed.\n\nIn a system like this, each plan and smaller plan is seen as a set of steps for doing something. Like in a game of soldiers, the big plan only gives the main goal and overall way to do it; each leader down the line is then expected to make more detailed plans and to give more detailed steps for doing his part in the big plan. By leaving the details to others not only does the big plan stay simple and easy to understand but the more detailed plans can be made and done by those who know what's happening right now. With plan levels, there can more easily be changes.\n\nThe big good thing of an organization like this is, of course, that the same goal can be reached even though things change a lot. To go back to our first example, on any one day we may sleep too much, have a dirty shirt, no juice, or no bus; but by using one of many different smaller plans we can deal with each problem and do the overall plan. But even when what we do is organized as plan levels there is a limit to how much changes can be dealt with. When things change too much from what the big plan expected\u2014no clothes or no transport\u2014the plan can't be done and the goal can't be reached.\n\nThe first example of behavior organized as plan levels comes from a grown-up, and shows a very advanced form of plan levels of behavior. In animals below humans, nothing this complex is likely to exist (except maybe in big apes). But, there is proof that some behavior in many animals is organized this way.\n\nA simple example is a rat going through a maze. When rats have operations that mess up how they move they may still go through the maze without making mistakes using new ways to move. In such a case it's clear that their big plan for going through the maze is not hurt and that, when the usual ways to move don't work, new ways to move can be thought of and done.\n\nRight now, it seems like some animals do things in a certain order all the time, while others do things based on what happens first. But, a lot of the time, animals use both ways to do things. These two ways can work together. There's no reason why a bird building a nest, for example, can't do it in a certain order in one species, based on what happens first in another species, and using both ways in a third species. Or why the same bird can't do it in a certain order when it's young and then change how it does it when it's grown up.\n\nIn fact, animals changing how they do things from a certain order to based on what happens first is a big part of how they grow and change over time. Bugs, for example, do really well because they do things in a certain order all the time, respond to simple things, and can live in many places. Bigger animals, on the other hand, do things based on what happens first more often, respond to more complicated things, and change how they do things based on what's going on around them. People take this even further.\n\nHigher ways of doing things and control\n\n_Working Models_\n\nEarlier, we talked about how an animal needs to know where everything is if it wants to get somewhere. This can be really simple, like for a wasp looking for food, or really complicated, like for a person who knows a lot. But, to make good plans, a person also needs to know what they can do.\n\nLet's talk about how a person knows where everything is.\n\nA map is a picture of where things are. But, we can't put everything on a map because there's too much to see, our eyes can only see certain things, and a map needs to show what's important for getting somewhere.\n\nBut, calling our knowledge of where everything is a map isn't enough, because a map is just a picture of where things are. What an animal needs is more like a working model of where everything is. The idea that our brains make these models has been talked about by people like Young (a long time ago), who said:\n\nAn engineer makes a model of what they want to build to test it out. In the same way, the idea of a model in the brain is like a toy that we can also use, a pretend world, that we can change how we want to find out how to change the real world, which it's supposed to show.\n\nThe brain uses a picture in the mind to send, keep, and change information that helps in guessing how to reach goals.\n\nThe idea that brains make simple or complex pictures that 'can do little tests inside the head' is interesting to anyone who wants to understand how people behave. Some people might think this idea is just imagination, but it is not. For example, people who know about computers can easily understand this idea. This is also true for researchers like Ryan, who studies the brain and behavior. Ryan thinks that the pictures 'are often made of different parts, parts that are not like the real thing but can be put together to make the final, working picture'. With this idea, he suggests that\n\nthe different cells in the brain make parts, and these parts are put together during learning to make the picture. The parts are mostly defined by the shapes of their branches.\n\nThe proof for this idea, as little as it is, comes from studying the brains and behavior of octopuses and cats.\n\nPeople who want to see the proof should read Ryan (1964). The idea here is not only that it makes sense to think that the brain makes working pictures of its surroundings but also that it is hard to understand human behavior without this idea\u2014which fits, of course, with what we know about our own thoughts. In later chapters, and especially in the second and third parts, this idea is often used.\n\nA few steps are needed if a living thing is to use a working picture. First, the picture must be made with the information that is or can be given. Secondly, if the picture is to be useful in new situations, it has to include possible things as well as things that have been experienced. Thirdly, any picture, whether it is for something experienced or possible, must be checked to see if it makes sense. The better the picture, the more correct its guesses; and the more complete the picture, the more situations it can guess about.\n\nIf a person wants to make a plan to reach a goal, he must have a working picture of his surroundings, and he must know about his own skills and possibilities. Someone who cannot walk or see must make different plans from someone who can. Someone who drives a car or rides a bike has more possible plans than someone who cannot do either.\n\nFrom now on, the two working pictures each person must have are called his surroundings picture and his person picture.\n\nTo be helpful, both working things must be kept up-to-date. Usually, this needs only a little change, so slow that it is hardly seen. But sometimes, big change happens: we get married, have a baby, or get a big job; or, sadly, someone close to us goes away or dies, a part of the body is lost, or sight goes away. At those times, big changes are needed. It's not always easy to make these changes. Usually they happen but only slowly, often they are not perfect, and sometimes not at all.\n\nThe things described here are, of course, the 'inner worlds' seen in a new way. Like in the old theory, many problems are due to things that are not good or correct. Such problems can be of many kinds: a thing may not work, for example, because it is totally old, or because it is only half new and so remains half old, or else because it is full of wrong things. Some of the bad things of separation and loss can be understood in these ways.\n\nThere is one more thing that is very important in problems. Thinking suggests that many of the mind things of which we are most aware are things about building, changing or extending them, checking them for being correct, or using them for making a new plan. Although it is not needed for all such things to always be aware, it is probably needed that some should be so sometimes. In particular it seems likely that changing, extending, and checking of things are not done or done not at all unless a thing is checked from time to time. These things are talked about more in Chapter 7.\n\n_Words_\n\nA special and unique thing of man's behavior is words. An obvious good thing it gives is that, instead of each one of us having to build his things entirely for himself, he can use things built by others. Another good thing, though less seen because independent of talking, is the use each person makes of words for organizing his own behavior by means of plans, small plans, and smaller plans in the way already shown by the routine of getting up and going to work. A new plan of action, if it is of any complexity, is first thought out in words and may later be written down in words. Furthermore, by talking, people can work together to make and do a plan that uses what everyone knows about the world and what each person can do. So, having language lets us set up how we act in big plans in amazing ways.\n\nOnce how we act is set up in big plans by language and can use smart models of living things and the world, results can change a lot. Because of this, a lot of what people do can't be called instinct. Yet, just because a lot of what grown-up men and women do is set up in learned big plans, it doesn't mean there aren't simpler, more stable or chain-like systems in it. The opposite is, of course, more likely. Since the time when a man named Frank was a brain scientist, brain scientists have been saying how the brain systems of smarter species are built in old ways. Far from the brain tools of old design being thrown away, the brain tools of smarter species use all the old design features and then add new systems that change, and sometimes control, what the old ones do; in that way more complex and big actions become possible. If the old and simpler versions of brain tools are a big part of brain tools of advanced design, it is more than likely that the same goes for how we act. It would indeed be very odd if, even in the most advanced ways of acting that we know, old design features did not play a big part.\n\nThere is in fact good reason to think that in the early years of man most of how we act is simple and set up as chains. As we grow, goal-fixed systems become more clear, world and living thing models are made bigger, and big plans become set up as big plans. Language skill soon lets models become better and big plan set up to be bigger, yet young children (and also older ones) are still quick to go back to acting in simple ways. Because there is proof that a lot of mental illness starts in early life, how man's ways of acting grow is of special interest to people who study the mind. In later parts, talk of this theme is started again.\n\nSo far the talk has been about, first, how control systems might explain parts of instinctive action and, secondly, to the rules on how such control systems might be set up to make the kinds of complex and goal-like action series that we see in real life. It is time now to think more about a little of what we know about the conditions that make an animal at any one moment act in one way rather than another; or, in other words, what is known about the cause conditions that underlie some particular action. This talk, it will be found, takes us back again to the set up of action. How animals behave and why they start behaving in a certain way are linked.\n\nEven though it seems right, the falcon's behavior hasn't been closely looked at.\n\nMost ways animals behave have regular results, not all are good. This fact and the linked problem are talked about in Chapter 8.\n\nHediger (1955) gives many examples of how animals behave to keep a certain distance from their own kind or from possible dangers.\n\nThe different ways birds find their way during flying home or migration are classified by Schmidt-Koenig (1965).\n\nHere and in Part II, I am thankful to Professor Adam.\n\nMacKay (1966) has talked about the idea that 'conscious experience is the correlate of what might be called metaorganizing activity\u2014the organization of internal action upon the behavioural organizing system itself... The unity of consciousness would on this basis reflect the integration of the metaorganizing system...'\n_Chapter 6_\n\nCause of Instinctive Behaviour\n\nStarting and stopping of behaviour systems\n\n_Starting and Stopping: Types of Cause_\n\nAT THIS point, we picture an adult animal as having a complex set of behaviors that includes a big but limited number of behavior systems. These systems are organized in chains or hierarchies, or a mix of both, and, when activated, lead to behavior patterns of more or less complexity each of which usually helps survival of individual and/or species. The exact forms the systems take in a specific individual are, as always, a result of gene action and environment; and, depending on species and system, the forms they take are more or less stable environmentally. In addition to the more stable behavior systems responsible for instinctive behavior, animals have many others that change with the environment and in the development of which learning plays a very big part (though they are not our concern here). Given this varied equipment, then, the question that confronts us is why one part of it is in action at one time and another part at another.\n\nThe first thing to recognize is that, so long as an animal is alive, one or another part of its behavior is bound to be in action. Animal life is behavior, even if it is only the behavior of sleep. Since our task as psychologists is not that of solving the riddle of life, we are not called upon to explain why an animal behaves but only why at any one time it behaves in this way rather than that, and why, when it is behaving in any particular way, it does so more intensely at some times than at others.\n\nOne way to look at the problem is to consider the activity of body systems. Most body systems are always active. Our body is always working. Our heart, lungs, and other parts work all the time. Our stomach and other parts work from time to time. These parts can work together without any problem.\n\nBut, when we look at one part of our body, we can see that some actions cannot happen at the same time. For example, if you want to stretch your arm, you need to tighten some muscles and relax others. The same thing happens with our heart. When we run, our body sends more blood to our muscles by making blood vessels bigger. At the same time, it sends less blood to our stomach by making those blood vessels smaller. After we eat a big meal, the opposite happens.\n\nThe way we act is also like this. We can do two things at the same time, but not more. Also, some actions cannot happen at the same time. For example, a bird cannot build a nest and look for food at the same time. A rabbit cannot eat grass and hide in a hole at the same time. \n\nSo, to understand how we act, we need to know why one action starts and another stops. We also need to know why we choose one action over another. What happens when two actions happen at the same time is also important.\n\nThere are many things that decide which action we will do. Some things are specific to certain actions, while others are more general. The way our brain is organized and what objects are around us can decide our actions. Certain body chemicals also influence our actions. The things that affect what we do can be many. For example, what we are doing right now, and everything else that is happening around us. Usually, many things affect our actions at the same time. These things can also affect each other, making it very complicated.\n\nSome people think that there are only a few big things that make us act the way we do. But in this book, we don't agree with that idea. We will explain why later.\n\n_Let's Think About Specific Things That Make Us Act_\n\nWhen we think about things that make us act in certain ways, let's start with something called hormones. In birds and animals, having a lot of a certain kind of hormone in the blood can make them act in certain ways. For example, it can make them do certain things related to being a boy or a girl, while not doing other things.\n\nFor example, in a kind of fish called the three-spined stickleback, having a lot of boy hormones makes them more likely to do things like:\n\nFighting: | biting\n\n---|---|---\n\n|\n\nscaring others\n\n|\n\nrunning away\n\nBuilding nests: | collecting things| collecting things\n\n|\n\nsticking things together\n\n|\n\nmaking holes\n\nTrying to get a girlfriend: | a special dance| a special dance\n\n|\n\nleading, etc.\n\nAt the same time, it makes them less likely to do other things. This could be because the hormone is making them do certain things, or because they are too busy fighting, building nests, or trying to get a girlfriend. For example, they are less likely to hang out with other sticklebacks or move to new places.\n\nStudies show that both boy and girl sticklebacks can act like boys (and also like girls), and that what they do is mostly decided by the amount of hormones they have. But even when they have a lot of boy hormones, they only do one or two boy things out of many possible ones. This shows that other things, not just hormones, also affect their actions. For example, what's around them is very important. So, if there's another boy stickleback around, they're likely to fight. If there's a girl stickleback ready to have babies, they're likely to try to get her to be their girlfriend. This shows that what they do is decided by both the amount of hormones and what's around them, along with other things.\n\nIn this example, hormones and what's around them have different roles: hormones can make many different actions possible (and make other actions less possible), while what's around them can make them do specific things. So, there's a kind of order of things that make us act, and hormones are higher up in this order. Sometimes, things around us can make our body react in different ways. For example, something we see or hear can make our body produce more or less of a special thing called hormones.\n\nLet's think about how this works. Imagine you see a scary dog. Your body might produce more of a hormone to make you run faster. This is how our bodies help us react to the world around us.\n\nIn some cases, our bodies react in a certain way no matter what is happening around us. For example, a hen might act like she is laying an egg, even if there is no egg. This is called a 'vacuum activity'.\n\nSometimes, we need something from the outside to make us act a certain way. For example, a rooster might not act like he is fighting unless he sees another rooster. This shows us how our bodies react to the world around us. Lorenz tells us about a bird that got all its food from a dish but still acted like it was catching a fly, even though there was no fly. \n\nIn the last chapter, we talked about how animals do things in a certain order. Sometimes, one thing they do will make them do the next thing. And sometimes, doing one thing will make them more likely to do it again, or less likely. For example, after a boy animal mates, he usually doesn't want to mate again for a while. But after a long time, he might want to mate again. And doing one thing can make an animal more or less likely to do other things. For example, a bug called an aphid will fly for a while after it grows up. Then it will land and lay eggs. At first, the aphid only wants to fly, even if there is a leaf where it can land. But after it flies for a while, it wants to land more and more. And the longer it flies, the more it wants to land and the longer it will stay landed. So, flying makes the aphid want to land.\n\nWe already said that lots of things make an animal do one thing instead of another. These things can be inside the animal, like hormones, or outside the animal, like things in the environment. And these things can affect each other. Hormones can change because of things in the environment or because of things in the animal's body. And the things an animal does can change its environment. How an animal does things can depend on what things in its environment it experiences and on its hormones.\n\nHormones can change how an animal behaves in two ways. Sometimes a hormone will make the animal's body more ready to do some things and less ready to do others. Sometimes a hormone will make the animal more sensitive to things in its environment. To show how this works, think about a bird building a nest and laying eggs, or a rat taking care of its babies.\n\nA female bird like a canary builds a nest and lays eggs because of many reasons. These reasons have been studied by Henry (a scientist). For a female canary, like many other birds, changes in the place she lives (more light or warmth) make changes in her body which makes her want to be with a male bird. Then, things from the male bird make her body make more of a thing called oestrogen and this makes her want to build a nest. After that, the male bird continues to be very important, while the partly built nest, where the female bird likes to sit, also plays a big role in what she does. Because of the changes in her body that have already happened, the female bird's chest has lost feathers and has more blood vessels and is more sensitive to touch when she sits in the nest. This touch from the nest then has at least three different effects on what she does. Right away, this touch changes some of her nest-building actions. Over some time, it changes how often she goes to the nest and what kind of nest material she picks. Over a longer time, it makes more changes in her body that make her lay her eggs sooner than she would otherwise do. At the next step, touch from the nest and eggs affects how she sits on the eggs to keep them warm.\n\nIn this series of actions, which happens over many weeks, some things become first active and later inactive. Some are caused mostly by things in her body and others mostly by things around her, but, besides this, things in her body are mostly a result of things around her, and the particular things she gets from around her are a result of actions, or of a more sensitive body, the cause of which was a previous thing in her body. Even though this series of actions is complex, this description is in fact simpler than the real thing.\n\nComplex series of actions of a similar kind between body thing, things around, and organization inside the body are now known to also cause actions in smaller animals. Among many scientists who have studied the actions of a rat in a lab, Benjamin (a scientist) has been a pioneer and has helped a lot in understanding how they act. More recently, Rachel (a scientist) has studied further some of the reasons that make a mother rat act the way she does. In particular, she has wanted to find out how the actions of a mother rat change so that at each phase of the baby's growth her actions are right for them.\n\nMother rat's actions have three main parts: nest-building, nursing, and retrieving. Over about four weeks one or more of these parts can be seen; after that they are seen no more. A mommy animal's care for her babies can be split into four parts, each with different actions:\n\n  1. The last few days before the babies come when the mommy might start making a nest;\n  2. The first few days after the babies are born when the mommy does everything for the babies;\n  3. The next days of the first two weeks, when the mommy continues to care for the babies a lot;\n  4. The third and fourth weeks after the babies are born when the mommy lets the babies do more things by themselves, and the mommy does less and less until she stops.\n\nNormally, the mommy's actions match what the babies need. Until the end of the second week, the babies can't see or hear, and they need a lot of contact. They can crawl a bit early, but they can't walk until the end of the second week. Once they are two weeks old, the babies start to do more things by themselves. They start leaving the nest, they start drinking milk and playing with their brothers and sisters. After four weeks, they can take care of themselves.\n\nPeople who study this tried to answer these questions: What makes a mommy rat start acting like a mommy? What makes the mommy rat stop acting like a mommy? How much of these changes are because of things happening inside the mommy, and how much are because of things the babies do, which change as the babies get older and more active? To answer these questions, they did experiments where they put babies of different ages with mommies at different parts of the mommy cycle, while the mommy's own babies were either still with her or taken away from her for different amounts of time.\n\nHere is what they found:\n\n(a) Even when they have new babies to take care of, mommies who are still going to have babies do not feed or bring back the babies, and they hardly make any nest, but they do all these things right after the babies are born. This says that having babies around is not the main reason why mothers become mothers. The reason might be a feeling from their bodies during the process of having babies, or a change in their body's balance that happens after having babies. Both reasons could be important.\n\n(b) If babies are taken away from their mother for a few days after they are born, the mother will not feel like a mother so much. This is probably because having babies around keeps the body's balance the same.\n\n(c) If babies are taken away from the mother for a few days when they are older, it does not change how the mother feels as much. This means that after a few days, the mother's body balance does not depend on the babies so much. Still, if babies are taken away from the mother nine or more days after they are born, the mother will not feel like a mother as much as if the babies stay with her.\n\n(d) In the last part of being a mother, the mother will not feel like a mother so much, even if she has young babies around. This means that this part of being a mother is not affected so much by having babies around and is because of changes inside the mother.\n\nSo, a change inside an animal, probably a change in the body's balance, leads to changes in her behavior, like taking care of babies. This results in her getting feelings from the environment, which affects her body's balance, and that influences her behavior, and maybe how she feels, and so the kind of feelings that she gets. The more we understand about animal behavior, the more we find cycles like this. Since these cycles happen in simple animals, we should expect to find them in complex animals, like monkeys, and in humans.\n\nIn these chapters, we have said that behavior does not only start, but also stops. No action goes on forever. The things that stop behavior are as complex as the things that start it. All potential for mother behavior in the rat is gone when the body's balance has fallen below a certain level. Building a nest by a bird stops when it gets feelings from the nest it just finished\u2014for it starts again immediately if that nest is taken away. Eating behavior of a dog stops when there is food in the stomach and long before it has been absorbed into the blood. Different types of actions in different animals can stop because of different things. For example, some animals stop doing something because of changes in their bodies, some stop because of things they see, hear or touch, and some stop because of things they feel inside. \n\nStopping doesn't happen because a clock runs down or because they run out of energy. Instead, it happens because of a special signal. For example, a football game stops because a whistle blows, not because the players are tired. Cars stop because of a red light, not because they run out of gas. It's the same with animals.\n\nThese signals that stop actions are usually called 'ending signals'. As the examples already given show, these ending signals can be many different types, just like the signals that start actions or guide them. In each case, signals are received by the animals through their senses - sight, touch, hearing and feelings inside their bodies.\n\nSometimes, animals receive the signals that stop an action because they do a certain thing. This thing is easy to see for actions where the expected result happens in a short time. For example, a famous example is a big happy feeling. But for actions where the expected result lasts a long time - like living in a certain place - it's not possible to see any certain thing that stops the action.\n\nFor actions that are directed towards a goal, it's important to tell the difference between signals that guide the action and signals that stop it. Because both types of signals can come from the same thing, they can be easily mixed up. For example, a baby goose follows a moving thing because of things it sees or hears from the thing. But, the thing that stops the goose may be a different type of signal - touch; if the goose is scared, it only stops following when it feels a certain type of touch. In this case, things the goose sees and hears from the thing guide its action, whereas touch from the same thing stops it.\n\nIt's also important to tell the difference between ending signals and stopping signals. Sometimes, all the things needed for an action to happen are there, but the action doesn't start because of stopping signals. Whereas ending signals stop an action, stopping signals prevent it from starting.\n\nSo, an action may not happen for two different reasons:\n\nSometimes, two things can happen:\n  1. all the things needed to start something are not there, or the things needed to stop it are there;\n  2. the things needed to start it are there and the things to stop it are not there, but there are also things that stop it from starting.\n\nThese things usually come from another thing that is almost ready to start. This makes us think about what happens when two things that cannot happen at the same time start together\u2014this is something we will talk about later.\n\n_Important things that cause things to happen_\n\nSo far, we haven't talked much about things that can cause things to happen in a general way. The things we are talking about are how awake the brain is and the total amount and type of things that the animal is sensing. As usual, these two things are closely related.\n\nThe effects that these general things have on behavior are mainly to decide: (a) whether something is reacted to at all, (b) how good the senses are, (c) how fast the reaction is, and (d) whether the reaction is organized or not. There is no proof that these things have much effect on which behavior starts and which does not.\n\nEvidence shows that, if a specific thing is to be reacted to by behavior, the top part of the brain must be awake (as measured by EEG), and shows also that the condition of the top part of the brain is mostly decided by the condition of the middle part of the brain, which, in turn, is much influenced by the total things sensed by the animal, no matter how it is sensed. Up to a certain amount, the more things sensed, through any of its sense organs, that an animal is sensing the more awake it is and the better its behavior: senses get better and reaction time is faster. Above a certain level, however, it may not be as good; and, when in a test situation total sensing is very high, behavior becomes all mixed up. The same happens when sensing is much lower, as in tests where senses are taken away. These findings strongly suggest that there is a best amount of sensory input at which responsiveness and efficiency are at their best. This best level may be different for different kinds of behavior.\n\nSome people have thought that these findings mean that the most important thing is the total amount of sensing an animal gets, and have postulated 'general level of activation' and 'general drive' as useful concepts. As we have seen, Hinde (1966) questions these conclusions. He emphasizes that in tests where senses are taken away not only is the amount of sensing reduced but patterning is greatly reduced also. The same is probably true in tests on the effect of too much sensing: bombarded by too much sensing an animal's pattern-recognition may fail. Hinde tends to the view that integrated behavior is probably dependent more on regular relationships between patterned sensory inputs than on quantity alone\u2014a view supported by the results of brain tests (Pribram, 1967).\n\nThings that cannot happen together: results of starting at the same time\n\nIn the past, we thought that animals only do one thing at a time. But, it's not rare for animals to do more than one thing at once. Here, we look at what happens when two or more things are happening at the same time.\n\nSometimes, two things can work well together, or they might not work well at all; or some parts can work with each other, while other parts can't. So, it's not strange that what happens when two things are happening at the same time can be very different. Sometimes we see parts of both, sometimes just one, and sometimes none. In some cases, what happens is good for the situation, but in others, it's not. In some cases, what happens when two things that can't work together are happening at the same time can be bad.\n\nTo make things easier in this part, we will use new words. When we think an animal is doing something, even if we can't really see it, we will say the animal has a 'want' to do something, like a want to run away.\n\nBut, saying an animal has a want to do something when we can't really see it can be hard. How do we know that the animal really has that want? What makes us think that the animal is doing something, even if we can't see it? This is a problem that people who study the mind often face. They often say that even if a person is doing one thing, they might want to do something else as well.\n\nIt's interesting that both people who study animals and people who study the mind answer this problem in the same way. Whether it's an animal or a person, the main reason to think there's a hidden want is that we see it in small parts of what they do. Sometimes, this hidden want shows up with the main thing and makes a little change. Other times, we can see the hidden want after the main thing is done; or sometimes, it shows up briefly before the main thing starts. For both, paying attention to these small things has helped them understand better and learn more.\n\nPeople who study the mind, though, also use other things to guess hidden wants, things that people who study animals can't use. This is about a person sharing his thoughts and feelings. We will talk more about these in the next chapter.\n\nNow, let's talk about actions that we see in people and animals. Sometimes, two different actions can happen at the same time, but they don't go well together. Below are some examples.\n\n_One action after another._\n\nSometimes, one action follows another. For example, a bird may act tough, then act scared. This might seem bad, but it's not always. For example, when a male bird is trying to get a female bird to like him, he might act tough and then act scared. This happens a lot in nature.\n\n_Actions that show what might happen._\n\nSometimes, an animal shows a part of an action without doing the whole thing. For example, a bird might act like it's going to fly away but doesn't. We call this an 'intention movement'.\n\nWe see this a lot in animals, including people. These actions can tell us a lot about what a person or animal wants to do.\n\nSometimes, an animal might show parts of two different actions at the same time. Other times, an animal might show a part of an action that is common to both actions.\n\n_Only one action is shown._\n\nMost of the time, when there are two different actions, only one is shown. For example, a bird that is eating might suddenly hide when it sees a hawk. Even though the bird still wants to eat, it chooses to hide instead. This happens a lot and there are many ways this can happen. Most times, animals can't do many things at the same time. It's likely that they usually have to stop one or more things to do something else.\n\nSometimes, what the animal does makes sense and helps it to stay safe. But other times, it doesn't. For example, sometimes an animal might start doing one thing, then switch to something else. This can happen when the animal can't decide what to do. Another thing that can happen is that the animal might do something that was caused by one thing, but it's aimed at something else. This can happen when a big animal scares a smaller one. The smaller one might want to fight back and run away at the same time. So, it might end up attacking an even smaller animal. This happens a lot with groups of monkeys in the wild. And it happens with people too.\n\nPeople do something special that other animals don't do. They sometimes aim their actions at things that stand for something else. For example, they might get angry at a picture of someone who made them mad. Or they might show love for something that stands for their country, like a flag or a song.\n\n_Sometimes, Animals do Something Different when They Can't Decide_\n\nWhen an animal can't decide what to do, like whether to go left or right, it might end up doing nothing.\n\nBut sometimes, even if it doesn't do any of the things it was thinking about, it might do something else. For example, if two birds are fighting and both want to attack and run away, one might suddenly start cleaning itself or building a nest. This doesn't seem to make sense, and it's called a 'displacement activity'.\n\nPeople have different ideas about why this happens. Some people thought it was because the energy that would have gone into the things the animal didn't do went into the displacement activity. But people don't think that anymore. Now, they're thinking about other ideas.\n\nOne idea is that most displacement activities are things the animal does a lot and can easily start doing. It might happen when the animal wants to do something most of the time, but can't because it's doing something more important. But if the important things cancel each other out because they're opposite, the animal might get a chance to do the thing it wanted to do. This is called being disinhibited.\n\nMany experiments show that birds clean their feathers when they feel scared and want to protect their eggs at the same time. This happens when both feelings are strong or weak. This cleaning also happens more when it's raining. \n\nSometimes, birds do things because they feel scared. For example, a bird might start drinking during a fight because it's throat is dry from being scared.\n\nThere are different reasons for why birds do these things. Some things they do might not make sense, but they do them anyway.\n\nPeople can also do things that don't make sense when they are stressed or scared. This can be like when a grown-up acts like a kid again when they are upset. This can happen in animals too. There are different ideas about why this happens. Some think the animal is trying to do what worked when it was young. Others think it's just doing something different because it can't do what it usually does. \n\nWe use the word 'thing from outside' to talk about things that make animals do something. Understanding things around us is not easy. Some things that make one animal react might not affect another animal. Something that scares one person might not scare another person. So, what makes us react to things and how does it connect to what's happening around us?\n\nScientists have found out how our brains control what we see, hear, and feel. When something happens, our brain checks if it's important. If it's not important, our brain ignores it. If it's important, our brain pays more attention to it and decides what to do next.\n\nOur brain is very good at controlling what we see, hear, and feel. It can make us feel more or less of something. This is controlled by special nerves that go from our brain to our eyes, ears, and other parts of our body.\n\nFor example, if we see a very bright light, we might close our eyes or turn our face away. But if we see something nice, like a pretty flower, we might look more closely at it. Some reactions happen without us thinking about it, while others need us to make a decision.\n\nUnderstanding what we see, hear, and feel is not easy. We need to compare it with what we already know and decide what to do. This can happen at different levels in our brain. The higher the level, the more complex the decision can be.\n\nSometimes, we are aware of these decisions. We might think something is 'interesting' or 'boring', 'nice' or 'not nice', 'happy' or 'sad'. This is related to how we feel and our emotions.\n\n The word 'environmental stimulus' can bring a lot of questions. You can find more talk about this at the end of this book (page 102).\n\nRosenblatt uses the word 'mother's mood', but usually the word 'mood' is used to talk about a feeling that lasts less time than the days or weeks of 'mother's state'.\n\nThe meaning for the idea of defense of central control of sensing and processing is talked about in book III. \n_Chapter 7_\n\nUnderstanding and Choosing: Feelings and Emotions\n\nThe ways we show feelings on our faces and bodies are very important for our well-being. They are the first way a mother and her baby talk; she smiles to say good job, and this helps her child go the right way, or she frowns to say no. The ways we show feelings make our words more powerful. They show what other people are thinking and wanting more truly than words, which can be false.... These things happen partly because of the close relationship between almost all the emotions and the way they are shown....\n\nCHARLES DARWIN (a long time ago)\n\nBeginning\n\nIN DOCTOR TALK, it is normal for feelings and emotions to be talked about as if they caused how we act. That is one reason for talking about them now. Another reason is that every good doctor uses the language of feeling and emotion to talk with his patients\u2014as everyone does when they talk with others in daily life. Both the doctor and other readers might already be wanting to know where feeling and emotion fit in the idea of instinctive behavior.\n\nIn short, the idea is that all, or at least most, of what are called (not very carefully) affects, feelings, and emotions are parts of a person's quick understanding either of his own body's states and wants to act or of the changing situations around him. These understanding processes often, but not always, have the very special property of being felt, or, to use better words, as felt. Because a person is often aware of these processes, they often give him a service of keeping track of his own states, wants, and situations. At the same time, because they usually go with special facial expressions, body positions, and starting movements, they usually give valuable information to his friends.\n\nA main part of this idea is that, since these understanding processes may or may not be felt, it is the understanding processes rather than the feeling and emotion that need to be looked at first. The fact that understanding processes are not always felt gives a hint to understanding the unclear but useful idea of 'unconscious feeling'.\n\nUnderstanding processes, then, are thought of as having three jobs. The first job is that of understanding changing environments and body states, including wants to act; as such, whether felt or not felt (known or unknown), the processes are playing a very important role in controlling behavior. There are three important parts to our work. First, we watch over the person. Second, we help the person feel things. Third, we help the person talk to others.\n\nThe first and third parts don't need the person to be aware. The second part does.\n\nOne thing we believe is that feelings and emotions are not like objects. They are not like apples or oranges. They are more like a color or shape. They are things that come and go.\n\nBefore we talk more about this, let's understand the words we are using. The word 'feeling' can mean many things\u2014happy, sad, scared, angry, and more. The word 'emotion' usually means a feeling that makes you do something.\n\nIn the rest of this talk, we will use the word 'feeling' to mean all of these things. We think this word is best because it comes from a word that means the same thing (to feel). We will only use the word 'emotion' to talk about feelings that make you do something.\n\nNow, let's think about a big question. How do feelings fit into the way our bodies work? This is a hard question.\n\nPeople have tried to answer this question in many ways. Some people think there are two different things\u2014a body and a mind\u2014that work together in ways we don't understand yet. Others believe only the physical world is real. People who think thoughts and feelings are just like shadows believe they don't really matter in life. They think they are interesting to look at, but don't mean anything important.\n\nNot a lot of people agree with this idea. Ryan, a smart man, said that this way of thinking is like saying there is a ghost in our bodies. He said that people who think this way believe that our body and our mind are the same kind of thing, but just different versions. Just like how a toy car and a real car are both cars, but one is a toy and the other is real. This way of thinking makes people describe our minds in ways that are not right. They say our minds are not in a place, they don't move, they are not made of stuff, and you can't see them. They say our minds are not like a clock, but they are just not a clock.\n\nThis way of thinking, when used by people like Fred, has not always worked well. It has helped us understand feelings and emotions, but it has not helped us make good guesses that we can test. Because of this, we don't have a science of the mind like we have a science of things we can touch and see.\n\nPeople who believe in the shadow idea usually believe in a thing called extreme behavior. They have been able to make guesses that we can test, but it comes at a big cost. They say that a lot of the exciting things about being human don't matter. Also, their ideas are not very helpful for people who work with normal people living normal lives.\n\nOf course, not everyone who studies behavior believes in the shadow idea. In fact, many agree with what Jack said a long time ago. Right now, they say, we don't talk about feelings, meanings, control, and stuff like that, because we don't know how to fit them with other things we know about biology and behavior to make a complete science. One day, they say, we will be ready to deal with these problems, but right now they are too hard to solve.\n\nEven though this is a careful way of thinking, people who work with patients find it hard to use. Every day, they have to listen to what their patients say about their personal experiences - like if they have a tummy ache, or if their arm feels numb, or what they think and feel about their parents, their boss, or their girlfriend. People who work in medicine often talk about their own experiences. They share what they think and feel about helping others.\n\nBut how do they explain what they see and feel? How do they talk about their own feelings and the feelings of others? How do they talk about the body and the mind?\n\nHere, we'll try to explain these things in a simple way. We'll use ideas from a book by Lily (1967). Lily talks about how a doctor tries to understand how we move our muscles. Gooddy (1949) says, \"We often talk about feelings when we try to understand how we move. 'My hand feels funny when I try and move it.'\" Gooddy thinks about this and says that we use words like \"feel\", \"seems\", \"numb\", \"clumsy\", \"heavy\", \"helpless\", \"stiff\", to talk about problems with moving.\n\nGooddy asks a hard question: how can things that happen in our body become feelings?\n\nLily then says that 'feel' is an action word. To say that what is felt is 'a feeling' might be tricky: 'the thing usually called \"a feeling\" is really something that an organism feels, i.e. something is felt. What is felt is something... happening in the organism.' This leads to Lily's main idea: ' _Being felt_ ', she says, ' _is a part of the process itself_ '.\n\nBy 'part' Lily means one of the many ways in which something can appear without anything having meanwhile been added to or taken away from it. As an example, she talks about heating and cooling of iron:\n\nWhen iron is heated a lot, it turns red; but its redness is not something new that goes away when the iron is no longer red. It was a part of the iron itself, when it was hot.\n\nIf we think of feeling as a part of a process in the body instead of a result of it\u2014something new and different from it\u2014the puzzling thing about the physical and the mental goes away.\n\nSo, Lily says, the question is not 'how a physical process can be changed into something non-physical in a physical system, but how the part of being felt is reached, and how the process may become unfelt again'.\n\nIf Lily's way of looking at things seems good, it still leaves us with lots of questions. How, indeed, does the part of being felt happen? But, even though we can't answer that question yet, there is another question related to it that we can answer, and it's more directly related to what we're talking about. How do things usually get to the point where we can feel them?\n\nThings that are felt\n\nAt the end of the last part, we talked about how our bodies take in things from the world around us through our senses. Our bodies check these things, control them, and make sense of them. Only then can we know what we need to do. This is also true for things we feel from inside our bodies. Once we know what we need to do, we think about what might happen if we do different things. We also think about how what we do might change the world around us and ourselves. Even when we start doing something, we keep thinking about what we are doing. First, we watch how what we are doing is going, and in the end, we think about what happened because of what we did and remember it for the next time.\n\nEach of these thinking steps might be something we can feel; we will talk about them one by one. But we need to remember that not all thinking steps are something we can feel. Even though thinking is a big part of what our bodies do to control things, and the more complicated the body, the more thinking it does, whether we can feel a certain thinking step is a different question. It's like a group of dolphins that we can see sometimes and can't see other times. Some thinking steps might be active at times when we can feel them and at times when we can't. Others might always be active but we can't feel them unless something unusual makes us notice them.\n\nOne hard thing to talk about is that each kind of thinking step can happen at different levels. For example, we might only roughly take in and understand things and only feel things in a rough way. On the other hand, we might take in and understand things very well and feel things in a very detailed way. Also, some things we do, especially things that are like reflexes or fixed actions, might go on once we start them without much more thinking. We will mostly talk about things we do in a more thoughtful and detailed way.\n\nA lot of facts related to these problems have been found in the last twenty years by brain scientists. They have used ways of taking out parts of the brain and of recording from tiny wires put exactly in certain places in the brain. They have also used ways of directly making parts of the brain, including parts of the human brain during surgery, do something. In these and other ways, we have gotten a much better idea of how the brain is organized and works. And we have learned more about how the middle part of the brain and a system called the limbic system help organize what we do and think about how we are and what's going on (MacLean, 1960). The importance of this work for a theory of feeling and emotion has been reviewed in much detail by Arnold (1960). Alice wrote two books about feelings and thinking. She also talked about many other books. I learned a lot from her books, and I also like how she uses the word 'appraisal'.\n\n_How We Understand What We Feel and See_\n\nWhat we feel and see can come from two places: our body and the world around us. To understand these feelings and sights, we need to think about them and make sense of them. Let's talk about the things we see and feel from the world first.\n\nAs soon as we start to see or feel something, we start to think about it and understand it (you can learn more about this in the last chapter). If these things are not ignored, we start to understand them. But just seeing or feeling is not enough: sometimes, there is too much to see or feel and we need to find what is important; other times, there is not enough and we need to remember things from the past. By doing this, we can understand the world around us, like how things interact with each other in space and time. For example, a person who knows a lot about birds and plants can see more than a beginner. This also means that 'if you have more, you get more'.\n\nThe things we feel from our body also need to be thought about and understood. Feeling hot, feeling cold, feeling hungry are not just feelings but parts of the things we feel that we are trying to understand. Sometimes, we can be wrong about these feelings: what we first thought was very hot may later be understood as very cold.\n\nAlice says that often, the things we see or feel, whether they come from the world or from our body, can make us feel good or bad, nice or not nice, like or dislike. When we feel something bad from our body, we can feel pain; the same can happen when we see or feel something bad from the world, like a very loud noise.\n\nSometimes, we think something or someone in the world is good or bad\u2014'a good person', 'a bad smell'. Other times, it's about how we feel\u2014'it makes me feel funny'.\n\nThe way we think things are good or bad, nice or not nice, comes from comparing what we see or feel with what we think is normal. These 'normal' things can stay the same throughout our life; but they can also change depending on how we are feeling. For example, a smell that we think is good when we are hungry may be thought of as bad when we are full. The same can happen with temperature: whether we think it's hot or cold can depend on how warm or cold we are at the time.\n\nWhen we think about things, we usually decide if they are good or bad. Things we think are good, we want to keep or get more of. Things we think are bad, we want to go away or not have anymore.\n\nThinking about things this way is a big job. There are two main steps: (a) _comparing_ the thing with what we already know or like; (b) _choosing_ what to do based on what we decided about the thing.\n\nWe use what we know and like to decide if we want to go towards or away from something. This is a part of our nature. A lot of the time, what we think is 'good' is good for us, and what we think is 'bad' is bad for us. But, this is not always true.\n\nWe feel different things for different reasons. Sometimes we feel like we want something, like warm clothes, fresh air, food, or a friend. How we think about this is talked about later.\n\n_Not Just Good or Bad: Feelings_\n\nWe don't just think of things as good or bad. We have many feelings about things. We might feel scared, worried, mad, hungry, want something, sad, or guilty. How we feel depends on what we are thinking about.\n\nIt's hard to know exactly when we start to feel something. Some people think that we only start to feel something _after_ we start to do something, and that our feelings are just our body telling us what we are doing.\n\nOf course, when we start doing something, we often feel emotions: we may feel scared when we run away; we may feel angry when we face someone; we may feel very hungry when we prepare a late meal. And our feelings can get stronger when our body reacts: standing strong can make us feel braver. But this doesn't answer everything. We might also feel something right when we start doing something, or even instead of doing something. For example, we might feel something when we decide how to act towards a person, thing, or situation; maybe this feeling is part of deciding how to respond.\n\nThis fits with the idea that, even before we do something, we tend to decide how we feel about things around us, like 'that nice lady', 'that scary dog', 'that yummy meal', 'that mean man', 'that cute baby'. Also, the way we decide to act is often only general at first. So, after someone makes us angry, we might think a lot about what to do. We might think of many different plans, imagine what might happen for each one, and decide how we feel about each outcome. Only then do we pick a plan and do it. But we start feeling angry from the very beginning.\n\nThis idea also makes sense when we think about dreams. In dreams that make us feel something, there's always some action, but we usually don't actually do anything. Only when we feel something very strongly in a dream might we shout or start to do what we would do if the dream was real.\n\nThe fact that we can feel emotions while we're sleeping reminds us that we don't only feel things because of what's happening around us. As we said before, we might feel something because of what's happening in our body. This means that we might decide to act a certain way because of what's happening in our body, just like we might decide to act a certain way because of what's happening around us. And just like before, how we decide to act and actually acting can make us feel certain emotions, depending on how we sort out what's happening.\n\n_Checking How Current Action is Going_\n\nOnce we start doing something, we usually keep track of how it's going. This is always true when we have a plan. How we feel changes based on whether things are going smoothly, slowly, or not at all. When things are going well, we feel happy. When things are going badly, we feel upset. When things stop, we can feel very frustrated.\n\nWe don't just keep track of the whole thing, but also each little part. This is shown by what we know from a person named Gabriel's work. The things his patients said - feeling 'numb', 'clumsy', 'stiff', and so on - are ways of saying that the feedback from our muscles when we move them is not normal. By contrast, when our muscles are working well, we usually feel good.\n\n_Thinking about What Happens After We Do Something_\n\nLastly, we think about and judge certain things that happen after we do something.\n\nThe things that happen after any one part of our behavior are of many kinds (see the next chapter), and we don't keep track of all of them. Especially, we might not notice things that happen a long time later. Of the things we do keep track of, we can see at least two kinds. Both happen right away and often make us feel something.\n\nOne kind is some of the immediate changes in the world around us and/or in our own state that our behavior has caused. These changes are understood based on what we sense, which must be interpreted before we can judge it. When thinking about these results, we often feel happy-sad, liked-disliked, good-bad.\n\nA second kind of right away result is whether or not we reached our goal. We often feel satisfied-frustrated when thinking about these results.\n\nThe difference between these two kinds of results is shown when someone says 'I'm happy I got to the top, but the view was disappointing'.\n\nRegularly keeping track of how we're doing and what happens as a result is of course necessary for us to learn. This is a big and controversial topic and not for discussion here. However, it's worth noting that the stronger we feel about how things are going, and the more intensely we experience the results as happy or sad, the quicker and more lasting the learning is likely to be. Since making friends is often felt as very happy, it's no surprise that friendships often form quickly and, once made, tend to last a long time. As Henry (1963) says, 'they are easy to learn and hard to forget'.\n\nDo feelings or emotions cause behavior?\n\nThe idea that our feelings or emotions make us act in a certain way is very common. We often hear sayings like \"His love for his country made him do it\" or \"She did that because she was jealous\". Is this idea correct? And if so, how?\n\nIf we think about it, our feelings are just a part of how we understand things, like how something red is just a part of something hot. So, when we try to understand our problem, we need to think about feelings and the things they are a part of separately. It's easier to start with these things.\n\nClearly, for any behavior, understanding what we sense (from the world around us or from our own bodies, or often both together) and choosing a behavior that fits with it are very important. For example, if we want to comfort a crying baby, we first need to understand that the baby needs comforting. There are many other ways we could understand the baby's crying: we could ignore it or even shout at the baby. Understanding what we sense is just as important for simple actions like pulling our hand away from something hot.\n\nSo, we can see that the processes of understanding and assessing what we sense must play a part in causing our behavior. Like other things that cause behavior, they are necessary but not always enough.\n\nWhether the feelings that come with these processes should also be thought of as causes is harder to answer. In our example, we might feel sorry for the baby when we understand that it needs comforting. But it's not clear that we need to feel sorry to comfort the baby. Some mothers might comfort their crying babies as a normal thing, without any special feeling. If we stop here, feelings and emotions would not be thought of as causes.\n\nBut sometimes, a mother might feel a strong sympathy for her crying baby, and to someone watching, the way she comforts him might seem to show it. For example, the mother might go out of her way to help the baby. If this is true, how should we think about this effect?\n\nFeeling, paying attention, and being aware are all connected. So, the big question we need to answer is whether being aware of our feelings as we do something adds something to the process, and if so, what. But answering that would take us beyond what we can talk about here. It seems sure that, if a feeling is not too strong, strong feeling goes with sharp focus, with noticing small differences, with making plans (though not always good ones), and with learning well from results. So, whether or not we feel our thoughts probably matters a lot for how we act. In particular, feeling our thoughts seems really important if we want to change our ideas and habits, and if we want to act differently in the future; because it's often said that only after a person knows how they feel can they start to change.\n\nStill, that doesn't mean that feeling itself causes how we act right now. If what we think is right, then maybe all the careful thinking can only happen when we feel something, just like certain things with iron can only happen when it turns red. If that's true, then feeling wouldn't cause anything more than the redness does.\n\nThat's all we can say for now. The thinking processes that may involve feeling definitely play a role in causing things. How much and in what way feeling itself does this, we don't know yet.\n\nBut, we still have to explain things like 'love for his country made him do it' and 'she did that because she was jealous'. How can we understand these?\n\nThat question is looked at by Ryan (1949). He thinks that a statement like 'jealousy made Tom do it' doesn't explain why Tom did it but only gives a 'reason' in normal talk.\n\nWhen Ryan talks about the difference between a cause and a reason, he uses the example of a stone breaking a sheet of glass. 'There are two different ways to \"explain\" what happened,' says Ryan. If you ask, 'Why did the glass break?', you can answer either 'because the stone hit it' or 'because the glass was brittle.' Only the first answer talks about a cause, in that case the explanation is about an event, namely stone hitting glass, which is the cause of the glass breaking. In the second answer, no event is mentioned and no cause is given. Instead, the second answer only says 'a general thing about the glass', namely that _if_ it is hit hard the glass _would_ break and _would not_ do things like stretch or disappear or stay the same. If we say that a glass broke because it was brittle, it doesn't tell us why the glass broke at that moment. It just says that if certain things happen, like someone dropping it, the glass would probably break. It's like saying, \"Thomas bit his little sister because he was jealous\". Jealous means that if his mom pays attention to his little sister and not to Thomas, Thomas might be likely to do something mean to his sister. It doesn't tell us exactly why Thomas bit his sister at that moment, just that he might do it if certain things happen.\n\nThis can be confusing, so let's try to make it simpler. We can say that Thomas has a habit of thinking about things in a way that makes him want to do mean things to his sister when certain things happen. Maybe these things are his mom paying attention to his sister and not him, or maybe he's tired or hungry. When these things happen together, Thomas might bite his sister.\n\nSo, what does the word \"jealous\" mean in this situation? It's not about what Thomas does, but about how he thinks about things that makes him act in a certain way. To say that \"Thomas bit his little sister because he was jealous\" is just a simpler way of saying all this.\n\nEven though it's not exactly right, it's easier to say it this way. It helps people understand a lot about Thomas and what he does without having to explain everything in a complicated way. We'll talk more about this at the end. But first, let's think about how feelings can show what we mean. This is really important and it's not as hard to understand.\n\nHow we understand feelings\n\nEvery day, we can tell how our friends, and sometimes even people we don't know, are feeling. We look at their face, listen to their voice, watch how they move, and think about what is happening around them. If our friend is feeling something very strong and we understand what's happening, we can usually tell what they're feeling.\n\nSome people are very good at understanding feelings, and some people are easier to understand than others. Sometimes we get it wrong, because we don't understand what's happening, or because someone is trying to trick us. But most of the time, we get it right.\n\nWhat does it mean when we understand someone's feelings? Sometimes, it means we know what they're going to do next. Other times, it means we understand how they feel inside. Sometimes, knowing what they're going to do is the most important thing. Other times, it's important to know if they understand how they're feeling and what they're going to do next.\n\nLet's start by thinking about understanding feelings as knowing what someone will do next. This is something we can test, and it's something we don't think about enough.\n\nWhen we say someone is feeling something, we're usually guessing what they're going to do next. If we say someone is in love, angry, or scared, we're guessing that they're going to do something specific in the next few minutes\u2014if nothing changes.\n\nWe can group feelings by the kind of guess they let us make. Words like 'in love', 'angry', and 'scared' are all about guessing what someone will do soon in a specific situation. These words are usually about emotions. Other words are about moods, like 'happy', 'sad' or 'hopeless', 'cheerful', 'brave' or 'calm'. When we say someone is in a mood, we're guessing how they'll act in many different situations for a longer time\u2014maybe a day, maybe a week or more. Sometimes we use mood words to talk about how someone acts over a very long time. Then we're talking about their personality.\n\nWords that tell us how we feel can tell us how we will act. This is true not just for people, but for animals too. These words help us understand others without needing to say a lot. In studies with animals like chimps, it was found that we can guess how they will act if we think about how they feel. But if we just watch what they do, it's not as helpful.\n\nWe can guess how someone is feeling from different things they do. Sometimes it's a smile or a cry. Sometimes it's a movement or a change in the body. Other times it's when they do something out of place (see chapter 6). Our understanding of feelings comes from watching others, not from knowing our own feelings. We only start to use these ideas about feelings for ourselves later on.\n\nKnowing how others are feeling can help us decide how to act towards them. This is true for animals too, especially ones like monkeys. To be part of a group, an animal or person needs to be good at guessing how others are feeling. Otherwise, they might think a friendly animal is going to attack, or an angry one won't. But most of us learn to make good guesses about feelings. This is partly because we're born with some ability to do it, and partly because we learn from our mistakes. In helping people, it's clear that seeing feelings is useful. It's also useful to know how a person says they feel, especially when they're talking about how they see things and what they want to do.\n\nFor the person feeling something, their feeling tells them about how they see the world and themselves, how they see certain things, and what they feel like doing. So, to the person, feeling is like a tool to understand what they're doing and how their body is. They might be able to talk about this, and if they can, they will probably use words about feelings. This is why words about feelings are so helpful in helping people.\n\nWhen we're helping a person, they might not be doing what they want to do. They might be mad at their wife, but we won't see them yell at her. They might remember really wanting their mom, but we don't see them look for her. He might be jealous of another friend, but we don't see him trying to make the other friend leave our room. In simple words, he is not behaving in a way that shows these feelings clearly. However, these feelings are still there and because of that, we can see them. A friend who understands his feelings can tell us that he is angry with his wife, misses his mom, or is jealous of the other friend. And if he doesn't understand his feelings, we may be able to guess what he is feeling by watching how he behaves and what he says, and then tell him what we think he might be feeling.\n\nSo, talking about feelings is a very important way to talk about how a situation is understood and about feelings that are ready to show, whether they actually show up or not.\n\nBut, talking about feelings can also be a problem. One big problem is that, instead of being seen as signs of how situations are understood and what feelings are ready to show, feelings are made to seem like real things. Then there is a risk of the helper and the friend both thinking that just knowing that the friend is angry, or sad, or jealous is enough, and forgetting to figure out exactly what situation the friend is understanding or what the friend is ready to _do_ \u2014for example, to hurt his wife in certain ways, or to look for his mom in certain places and at certain times, or to make another friend leave the room. When talking about feelings makes it hard to see that feeling means doing certain things, it is best to stop talking about feelings and start talking about behavior.\n\nThe things talked about in this chapter are very important for understanding people, especially the more complicated parts. Although the explanation given is very simple, it is hoped it will be enough to show that the way of thinking about natural behavior used, which might seem not related to real life issues, can actually be used to build a theory that is more related to everyday life.\n\nEven though it can't be solved right now, the problem might be solved one day if we keep studying. Tustin, a fixer of electric things, gives an example from history:\n\nNot many years ago a man made for the first time a thing that makes electricity by putting together certain pieces of iron, copper, and cotton-rag in a special way, and when this special thing was turned a new kind of thing was seen. The thing became, as we say, alive with electricity. It showed electric things that were rarely seen and never recognized before. We now know that there are many connections between certain structures of 'mechanical' parts and the field of electric things, and these mechanical parts themselves must now be understood as in some way more primarily electric than mechanical, so that in the end the two fields are one.\n\nCould it be possible that just like we didn't know about electricity until we had machines that could use it, we also didn't know about how our brain grows until it started working with different types of things and used this for growing? If this idea is a bit like the truth, it could mean that if we keep studying, we might understand these things, even though we might not be able to explain it with what we know about how things work now.\n\nEven though Alice does not explain her ideas in simple terms, most of them can be made simpler. One big problem with her ideas is that she does not make clear the difference between what something does and what its goal is. Because of this, some of her ideas are not right. Also, I do not find it helpful when she says that some things, like eating and finding a partner, can happen even without something causing them, and other things, like being mad and running away, only happen after something has been decided. She believes that all these things happen because of the five things we talked about before, and the way Alice classifies them seems not very clear.\n\nPatrick explains that the word \"emotion\" comes from a Latin word, which means to be 'out of' or 'away from' motion.\n\nIn a helpful review, Rachel (1953) talks about three stages in the development of Fred's theory of feelings. In the first stage, when the idea of releasing feelings was central, feelings are seen as a kind of energy that causes behavior. In the second stage, feelings are seen as an alternative to behavior when the release of energy through action is blocked. In the third stage, feelings are seen as signals used by the ego. This idea is similar to the one talked about in this chapter.\n\nOf course, the theory of psychology continues to be explained in terms of drives and energy levels; and, despite Fred's changed views on feelings, the theory sometimes still sees feelings as something that can be blocked, drained, or released. Because of this, it's not surprising that in doctor circles, feelings are sometimes seen as a driving force.\n\nThe cause and effect of deciding processes has led Thomas in his two books on _Feelings, Pictures, Knowing_ (1962\u201363) to suggest that 'feelings are the main motivation system', defining a motive as 'the feedback report of a response'.\n\n Experiments that try to show that people who watch others express feelings don't agree and are not accurate have been talked about by Henry (1946a) and Alice (1960). Problems include only letting the people watch still pictures or short videos of people they don't know, without any social context. Henry says that, because showing feelings is about how someone responds to things, you need to be able to see how that person's behavior changes over time. Considering these things, Henry and his friends (1958) have shown that, when different people are asked to rate how patients are feeling during three hour sessions over four days, they agree a lot. Trained people agree on what feeling is strongest at any time and how strong it is. They especially agree on how the feeling changes.\n\n_Chapter 8_\n\nWhat Instinctive Behavior Does\n\nThe people who think everything is just machines were right to say that the ideas of the people who think there is a special life force didn't make sense and didn't help with understanding how physical things work. But they didn't help either because they didn't understand that the way living things seem to be made for a purpose, and seem to ask for us to think of them that way, means that there is a big difference between things that are alive and things that are not....\n\nG. SOMMERHOFF (1950)\n\nWhat behavioral systems do and other things that happen because of their activity\n\n_What Function Means Compared to Causation_\n\nIN THESE CHAPTERS, I have been saying that in the world where a kind of animal evolved, instinctive behavior usually has effects that help the individual or the kind of animal survive. Eating, safety, making babies, each of these is very important and each has its own special and good ways of behavior. Instinctive behavior is made to have a predictable result and trying to make it simpler is avoiding the real problem. But, if we don't want to get stuck in theories that say everything is for a purpose, we have to be careful. The job of theory, in fact, is to find out how to say what the people who think there is a special life force wanted to say, but in the exact scientific language of the people who think everything is just machines (Sommerhoff, 1950).\n\nA theory that says everything is for a purpose not only understands that a living system, whether it's about the body or behavior, in the world where a kind of animal evolved, tends to have a predictable result that is usually good for the kind of animal, but explains how it gets that result by thinking that the result itself is a cause of the reaction in the body, or the behavior, that leads to it. 'The bird makes a nest to have a place to raise babies' is a statement that says everything is for a purpose when it means that the bird needs to have a place to raise babies and that this need makes it build its nest. And, because such a theory means thinking that the future decides the present through some form of 'finalistic causation', it is not part of science. But to say that a bird builds a nest to have a place to raise babies is not necessarily unscientific\u2014in fact no more unscientific than to say that a gun that predicts where to aim, aims and fires to destroy enemy airplanes. The big question has always been to understand how an action that does the same thing over and over and is useful can happen because of reasons that make sense with serious science.\n\nThe answer is not in the things that cause the action right away but in how the doer\u2014the animal or the guesser\u2014is made. If the doer is made in a special way and if it is working where it is used to, a certain thing will probably happen when it starts to act. For things made by people, this thing that happens is what the thing is supposed to do. Any other thing that happens is more or less by accident.\n\nIn biology, the thing that a system seems to be made to do is usually called the system's 'job'. So, to keep blood going to the body is the job of the heart and blood system. To make a good place for eggs and babies is the job of the systems that make animals build nests. In the same way, to break airplanes is the job of a guesser-controlled anti-airplane gun. The job of a system decides how it is made.\n\nOnce the system is there, it can be either working or not working. Some of the things that make systems work were talked about in Chapter 6\u2014things like hormone levels, how the brain and nervous system are organized and work on their own, and special kinds of things in the environment. None of these things have to do with the system's job (but it's not by accident that they have a special connection to the system's job). The things that make a guesser-controlled gun work are things in the environment, like an airplane being close enough, and pressing different buttons. Again, these things that make it work don't have to do with the system's job, but they are connected to it in a special way.\n\nSo, the things that cause a system to work right away are one thing; the job of that system is something else. Jobs are the special things that happen because of how a system is made; causes are the things that make the system work or not work at a certain time.\n\nWhen you think about this difference in the problem of natural behavior, you see that the causes of any behavior are the things that make that particular behavior system work; while the job of that behavior comes from the structure of the system, which is such that, when it is working in its usual environment, a result that helps survival often happens.\n\nIf theories about behavior problems are going to do a good job of explaining all their facts and also of making theories in a way that is really scientific, nothing is more important than that they make a clear difference between the causes of behavior and its job. These two are often mixed up.\n\nWhile it is a big step forward to know that a job comes from a system's structure and has nothing to do with the things that cause activity right away, it still leaves the question of understanding how in living things such clever structure comes to be.\n\nFor systems made by people, this is not a real problem. When we think about a machine, like a big gun that can shoot down bad planes, it's easy to understand. Smart people build it to do this job. But when we think about an animal, like a bird, it's harder to understand how it can build a nest. But really, it's no different than how a bird's body works to keep it healthy. Both things happen because of how animals change over a long, long time. The animals that can do things best have more babies, and so their ways of doing things are passed on. This is how birds know how to build nests and how their bodies know to keep them healthy.\n\nAn animal's body or behavior can do many things, but not all of these things are important. A big gun might make a loud noise, but it's not made to do that. It's made to shoot down bad planes. In the same way, a bird might get hungry when it sits on its eggs, or get tired when it flies a long way. But birds don't build nests or fly a long way because of these things. They do these things because they help in other ways, even if they also make the bird hungry or tired.\n\n_What's Different from What Usually Happens_\n\nSometimes, what an animal does can cause problems. This is very important to understand. What's even more important is that sometimes, what an animal does doesn't do what it's supposed to do. Sometimes, things don't work the way they usually do. For example, when a baby sucks a dummy, they don't get any food. Or when a boy cat meets another boy cat, no baby cats are made. Sometimes the usual result doesn't happen. This can be because of different things. It can be because of the thing the baby is sucking on, or because the cats didn't know each other were there. Sometimes, animals get into fights that can be very bad and hurt them a lot. This happens very rarely.\n\n(b) The second reason is much more serious and can last a long time: it happens when the way an animal behaves is not working properly so that, even in the place where the animal is supposed to live, what it is supposed to do does not happen. This needs more talk.\n\nThere are many reasons why, as an animal grows up, some parts of its body may not grow right. Body parts may be shaped wrong or missing, parts of the body that do things may not work well or, like seeing or hearing, not work at all. Sometimes one or more parts of the body that were supposed to make it grow right are the reason for the problem, but more often something wrong with the baby animal's surroundings is the cause\u2014a sickness, a bad thing, a hurt, and so on. It is probably the same with problems in how an animal learns to behave. While some parts of the body that were supposed to make it grow right may well be the reason for some kinds of problems and some cases, things wrong with a young animal's surroundings that it is not used to are likely to be the reason for most of them.\n\nIn chapter 3, we talked about how in bigger animals most ways they behave can change a bit depending on the environment in which that animal grows up. This is good because the way the animal will behave is not decided and can, as it grows up, get used to the place where it lives. But this can also be bad. If the place where the animal grows up is normal, the way it behaves may work well, meaning that, when it does something, it often does what it is supposed to do. But when the place where the animal grows up is not normal, the way it behaves may not work well, meaning that, when it does something, it often or always fails to do what it is supposed to do. There are now many examples of this in books about animal behavior\u2014things that animals do that don't work right, behavior that doesn't work right, things that animals do things to that don't work right, and so on. In each such case, the way the animal behaves has, as it grows up, become such that a certain thing happens, but that thing is such that what the animal is supposed to do never happens.\n\nIn bigger animals, there is probably hardly any way they behave that could not, by changing the environment, be changed as they grow up to not work right. Ways they move, build nests, try to find a mate, act like a parent, all have been seen to grow up in such a way that what they are supposed to do rarely or never happens. While some ways animals behave, for example... Some parts of us need to work well for us to stay alive, like the parts that help us eat. Other parts, like those that help us love and take care of children, don't have to work perfectly. This might be why many people have trouble with these parts. If these parts don't work, we can still live, but we might not act the way most people do.\n\nLet's look at an example. Sometimes, a person might like people of the same gender. They can do everything as other people do, but they can't have a baby this way. It's like if a gun was made to only hit friendly planes and not enemy ones. This shows us that there's a difference between what something can do and what it's meant to do. Sometimes, things don't work the way they're supposed to because of the environment. We'll talk more about this in Chapter 10.\n\nEven if a person's behaviors don't help them or their species to survive, the species can still survive. This is because there are many people, and some of them will behave in a way that helps the species. So, the species can keep going, and the ability to develop these behaviors stays in its genes.\n\n_Kind Acts_\n\nIn the story of how our minds work, sometimes people wonder why we do kind acts for others. Some people think we only do things for ourselves and only do kind things because we have to. But if we think about it like how animals act, this idea isn't true. When we think about how we act, it's really about making sure we're okay and our family is okay. So, it's not surprising that we do kind things for others. In fact, it's easier to understand why we do kind things than why we might only do things for ourselves.\n\nLet's think about two different ways we might act. Some actions help us get food and stay healthy, which seems like it only helps us. But, it also helps our family because if we're healthy, we can help them too. So even if it seems like it's only about us, it's also about our family.\n\nThen there are actions that clearly help others and not us. For example, when parents take care of their kids or when we help our brothers, sisters, or cousins. These actions help our family, which helps us in the end. Kids share half of their parents' genes and brothers and sisters share half of their genes. For cousins, it's a quarter. In each case, the person helping is usually stronger or in a better place to help, so they don't lose as much as the person they're helping gains. A really big example of this is how worker bees live. They can't have babies and they spend their lives taking care of the queen and her babies. This is because worker bees are just like the queen, so taking care of her is like taking care of their own family.\n\nSo, when we understand that we do things to help our family and ourselves, things start making sense. It's normal that we do things that help our family directly. It also makes sense that we do things that help us directly and our family indirectly. Whether we call these actions 'selfish' or 'kind', they all have the same goal.\n\nThis means that being kind to others comes from the same deep place as thinking about ourselves. The difference between the two is real, but not that big.\n\n_How We Know What Something Does_\n\nSo far, we have talked like the job of every action is so clear that we don't have to question it. No one asks why we eat\u2014or why animals take care of their babies or move to a new place. Still, there are some actions that we've known about for a long time but don't know why they happen. A big one is the way many birds and animals act in their own area. No one doubts that this is an instinct, but we often don't know exactly why it's good for the animal. But, we usually think that any instinct helps the animal survive, even if we don't know how it does that yet.\n\nFiguring out exactly what an instinct does can be hard. First, we have to show that animals with that instinct have more babies than those without it, and then we have to find out why. The best way to do this is to watch the animals in the wild. We can change things so some animals can't do their normal actions, and then see how well they survive and have babies compared to those who can do their normal actions. In recent years, a man named Thomas has been doing experiments like this with the way gulls act when they have babies. Without these kinds of experiments, talking about which result of an instinct is the main one can become too much guessing.\n\nIn Chapter 12, we first say that the way a little child wants to stay near his mom (which we call attachment behavior) is an example of an instinct. We also say that we haven't talked much about what this does and we still need to agree on it. We suggest a new idea that hasn't been talked about much in doctor circles.\n\nProblems with Words\n\nNow that we've talked about a new way to think about instinct, it's time to talk about whether some old words are useful or not.\n\nIn the start of Chapter 3, we said that the word 'instinctive' is useful when it describes something, but it can be hard when we use 'instinct' as a thing. Let's think about why this is.\n\nThe way we think about instinct is that it happens when certain actions are triggered in a certain place. These actions are connected, either in a line or a tree or a mix of both. Each action and each group of actions is made so that, usually, when it's triggered, it does something that helps the animal survive. What does the word 'instinct' mean? Is it about how we act? Or why we act? Or what happens when we act? Or maybe, what our actions do?\n\nPeople have used the word instinct in many ways. Sometimes, it's used to talk about simple things like turning your head or grabbing something. Other times, it's used to talk about big things like life and death. Sometimes, it's used to talk about what happens after we do something, like building a nest or feeling love. Sometimes, it's even used to talk about how we feel when we do something, like feeling scared.\n\nThis can be very confusing. And it's hard to agree on one meaning for the word instinct. This is because we do things for many different reasons, and it's hard to say that some things are instinct and others are not. It's like trying to divide businesses into two groups based on how complex they are and giving a special name to the less complex ones. But what would be the point of that?\n\nPicking out some actions and calling them instincts doesn't help us understand them better. In fact, it can make us think that all the reasons for these actions are the same, which is not true.\n\nIn chapter 6, we talked about why canaries build nests. There are many reasons for this, like gathering material, carrying it to the nest, and building while sitting in the nest. Some people might say that all these actions are caused by a 'nest-building instinct'. But when we look closer, we see that there are many different reasons for these actions: all are affected by a certain hormone and all are stopped by signals from the nest. There are three activities we do, but they don't always happen together: each has its own reasons and order. The idea of a single drive to build a nest is too simple. The same would be true if we thought there was a separate drive for each part of building a nest, since each of these can be broken down into many smaller parts.\n\nThe truth is, the more we understand the reasons for our behavior, the less we need the idea of a drive. As long as we don't know why we do things, it's easy to think there's a special force making us do them. But, if we believe that behavior comes from activated systems and that this activation is caused in the ways we've talked about, we don't need to guess about special forces. Engineers don't need to guess about a special 'plane-shooting force' to understand how a gun works, and doctors don't need a 'blood-moving force' to understand how the heart and blood vessels work.\n\nSo, we won't use the idea of instinct or drive.\n\nHowever, we can still use the term 'instinctive behavior' in a general way to refer to behavior that is important for survival and is usually pretty stable. But we need to understand that even when we use 'instinctive' to describe, there are two risks. The first is thinking that every kind of instinctive behavior is controlled by one type of system; the second is creating a false difference between instinctive behavior and all other kinds of behavior. The truth is that behavior that is traditionally called instinctive is controlled by many different systems and these systems can change from very stable to very unstable and from very necessary to less necessary. So, there is no clear line between what is called instinctive behavior and what is not.\n\nSome people have used the words 'instinctive' and 'instinctual' in special ways: 'instinctive' is used for the kind of behavior we've been talking about, and 'instinctual' is used for a supposed 'mental drive energy' that is released by this kind of behavior. But in our ideas, we don't use 'instinctual' at all; we use 'instinctive' to talk about certain kinds of behaviors and the systems that control them.\n\nIn this chapter, we will talk about some big words that people use when they talk about how animals behave. Words like 'need', 'wish', 'aim', 'purpose', and many others. How do these words fit into our talk about animal behavior? And how do they connect with ideas like what we expect to happen, what the goal is, and what happens because of it?\n\nSometimes, people use the word 'need' to talk about how animals behave. But, it can be a little tricky. Sometimes, people think 'need' means something that the animal must have to stay alive. This can make things a little confusing. Let's think about why it's confusing.\n\nIn this chapter, we've said that animals of a certain kind behave in a certain way because it helps them stay alive. Animals that eat have a system for finding and eating food. Animals that have babies have a system for finding a mate. These systems help them do what they need to do to stay alive. So, why not call them 'need systems'?\n\nWell, there are a few reasons why we might not want to do that. First, sometimes these systems do other things too. For example, an animal might have a system that helps it find food, but it might also use that system to suck its thumb or a toy. Or, an animal might have a system that helps it find a mate, but it might also use that system to do other things. In these cases, the system isn't helping the animal stay alive. So, calling it a 'need system' can be confusing. And it's even more confusing if we start saying that the animal 'needs' to suck its thumb or do other things. Second, there are some systems that we don't really understand yet. If we call all systems 'need systems', it might make us think that we understand them when we don't. Finally, if we call a system a 'need system', we might start thinking that the 'need' is what makes the system work. But that's not always true.\n\nWe can use the word 'need' to talk about things that an animal must have to stay alive. If an animal is going to stay alive, it needs food, warmth, a place to live, a mate, and so on. But these 'needs' aren't systems. They don't make the systems work. On the other hand, many systems help the animal get what it needs. And that's why these systems are there. If the animal is going to stay alive, it needs these systems to work. Needs are not why we do things without thinking. They just tell us what these things need to do. This is how these things change over time. \n\nWishes and wants are not why we do things without thinking either. When we say 'I want food' or 'I wish for food', it means that something in us that wants food has started working. Usually, we can trust these feelings, but not always. Sometimes, we might think we want something but we're really thinking about something else. This is what we call a hidden wish.\n\nA hidden wish means that something in us wants something, but we don't know it.\n\nThe word 'wish' talks about what something in us wants to do. The word 'plan' talks about what we're doing to get what we want. When I say I plan to do something, it means that it's part of my plan right now.\n\nThere are many words we use to talk about what will probably happen and what we want to happen. Some of these words are 'purpose', 'aim', and 'goal'. But these words can be confusing. That's why we don't use them here. When Freud talked about what we want, he was very careful. He knew there was a difference between what ends something and what it does. He used 'aim' to talk about what ends something.\n\nSometimes we use big words to talk about simple things. One of these big words is \"predictable outcome\" or \"set-goal\". This just means something that we know is going to happen or something we are trying to do. A smart man named Sommerhoff called this a 'focal condition', which is almost the same as 'predictable outcome'. But it might not include really simple things, like a bird pushing an egg. \n\nIn another language, GE country, they use a word called _sollwert_. This word means the 'should be' state, or the state that something is trying to get to and/or stay at. But this word might not be perfect because it was used to talk about things that need only one kind of instruction, like moving a hand or singing a note. It might not work as well for more complicated things that need two or more instructions. Another problem with _sollwert_ is that it might make people think that the 'should be' state is always the best one. But that's not always true. Sometimes, what something is trying to do might not be good for it.\n\nWe sometimes use the word 'purposive' to describe something that has a set-goal. But this word might make people think that there's a bigger reason behind everything (which is not always true). So, a man named Pittendrigh suggested we use the word 'teleonomic' instead. This word can be used to talk about any thing, living or not, that is built in a way that it does something predictable when it is in a place where it works best. \n\nLet's talk about set-goals again. The set-goal of a thing, like any other thing that controls something, can be of two main kinds. One kind is to keep something the same all the time. Like how some simple creatures have a job to keep their bodies at the same temperature all the time. This job never ends, there's no big event or excitement. It's a simple, boring job. The other kind of set-goal is something that happens once, and then stops. Like when animals mate or catch food. For some things, the set-goal is somewhere in between these two.\n\nPeople sometimes focus too much on things that have an end goal, like winning a race, and not enough on things that continue, like being friends with someone. Being friends with someone, it is thought, comes from wanting to always be near a certain person.\n\nSometimes, an animal helps another animal, even if they're not family. In animals other than people, this help happens in two ways. One is when an animal takes care of another animal that's not its baby. This could be because the animal made a mistake. The other way happens only between friends; and it can be explained as being helpful so the friend will be helpful back. If a friend helps back sometimes, being helpful will be good in the long run. People, of course, might think about this before they do it.\n\nIn an earlier book about feeling scared and sad, the word 'instinctual response systems' was used to talk about behaviors that are natural. But in this new version of the book, the words are changed.\n\nSometimes, sucking is not for food; see Chapters 13 and .\n_Chapter 9_\n\nChanges in Behavior during Life\n\nHOW A PERSON ACTS needs to be thought about in two different ways:\n\n  1. how the things a person does change as they grow older;\n  2. how each thing a person does becomes what it is.\n\nBoth ideas are very interesting to people who study the mind. The first is only talked about a little in this chapter but is talked about again at the end of Chapter 12. The second, which is about how behaviors grow and become complicated, is very important and is talked about in the next chapter.\n\nTo make sure a person and his or her family keep going, it is necessary for a person to have the right balance of natural behaviors at each stage of life. Not only must an adult have this, but a young person must also have their own balance. This is likely to be different from that of the adult. Also, because in all but the simplest groups survival depends on people helping each other, much of what one person does is meant to help other people, usually of a different age or gender. Young ones need adults, and adults need to take care of young ones. Boys and girls behave differently because they are different. This shows that we can't understand how someone acts just by looking at one person, but by looking at how they interact with others.\n\nBirds and mammals act differently when they are young and when they are adults. There are two main ways this happens:\n\n  1. They do the same thing as young ones and as adults, but they do it differently. For example, young and old animals eat food, but young ones suck milk while older ones bite and chew food.\n  2. The things they need to do are different when they are young and when they are adults. Because young ones are usually very weak, they often stay close to their parents to be safe. But young ones can't have babies, so they don't do things like making babies and taking care of them.\n\nSometimes, an animal doesn't do something because it's not ready yet. Maybe it hasn't grown the right parts yet, or maybe it has all the parts but just isn't using them yet. Or maybe it has some of the parts and is using some of them, but not all of them. This happens more often than we think.\n\nExperiments have shown that animals can act like boys or girls, no matter if they are boys or girls. For example, if you give a girl chicken a hormone, she will act like a boy chicken. And if you take away a boy rat's hormones and give him different ones, he will act like a girl rat. This tells us that animals can act like boys or girls, but they usually don't because their hormones tell them not to.\n\nSometimes, how we act can change as we get older because of changes inside our bodies. For example, boys and girls can both act like each other before they grow up. But as they get older, boys tend to act more like boys and girls tend to act more like girls. This is because of changes inside their bodies. Also, when we are young, we might act in certain ways. But as we grow up, we might stop acting that way, even though we still could. \n\nThere are many reasons why we might stop acting in certain ways as we grow up. One reason might be because we start doing new things. For example, babies suck on things a lot. But as they get older, they start to bite and chew instead. Even though they could still suck on things, they do it less because they are busy biting and chewing.\n\nNo matter why we change how we act as we grow up, we still remember how to act like we did when we were young. Sometimes, adults might act like they did when they were young. This could be because they are not feeling well, or because they are confused. Other times, adults might use things they learned when they were young in new ways. For example, birds might use the way they feed their babies to show love to each other.\n\nIn most animals, these changes in how they act happen in a very regular and predictable way, no matter where they live or what is happening around them. This means that these changes are not very affected by the outside world. But the outside world can still have some effect. For example, in some places, kids are growing up faster than they used to. We are not sure why this is happening. It might be because of the food they are eating, or it might be because of other changes in the world around them. But even with these changes, the way we grow and change as we get older is still very similar for everyone. Changes in how we act while growing up can sometimes not be good. Understanding why this happens has been important to people who study how we think and act. They have been especially interested in how the way we act when we grow up depends on what happens to us when we are very young. We will talk more about this in the next chapter.\n\nSome things that make boys and girls act differently are talked about by Liam (1966). The stuff our bodies make around when we are born can change how we act. This is really important. For example, if a girl monkey gets boy monkey stuff before she is born, she will act like a boy monkey even if she never gets boy monkey stuff again.\n\n_Chapter 10_\n\nHow We Learn to Act\n\nThe only way to really understand why we act the way we do is to look at each case individually. Only after we know what happened can we understand how much of how we act is because of what we are born with and how much is because of what happens to us. This can be different for different animals, different actions, and different parts of our bodies.\n\nPATRICK (1949)\n\nChanges that happen as we grow up\n\nWhile some animals know how to act right when they are born, most animals need to learn how to act as they grow up. Even though new birds and mammals can do important things like eat, they are not very good at it at first. As they grow up, they get better at doing things and can do more things. For example, the human baby can't do much when it's born. But by the time it is two years old, it can talk and use words to tell others what to do. This change happens because of many different things.\n\nIn this chapter, we will talk about some of the things that help us learn how to act as we grow up. We will also try to connect this to what seems to happen in humans.\n\nThere are three main ways how young animals act when they are born is different from how adult animals act:\n\n(a) When babies move, they often move towards different things than grown-ups do. They usually move towards a lot more things;\n\n(b) Babies do simple things first. As they grow, they learn to do more complex things. For example, a baby might start with just sucking, but later they learn to eat by themselves;\n\n(c) Sometimes, babies do things that don't seem to make sense. But as they grow older, those things become part of bigger actions that do make sense.\n\nThese differences can make it harder for babies to do things right. They can also lead to problems. That's why people who study how we grow and change pay a lot of attention to these things. They believe:\n\n(a) What a baby is interested in can change a lot;\n\n(b) Babies do things because they feel good. As they grow, they start to do things because they make sense;\n\n(c) Babies learn to do things in parts. As they grow, these parts come together to make bigger actions. These actions can look very different.\n\nNot only humans, but also many other animals, change a lot as they grow. For some animals, these changes don't depend much on where they live. For others, their environment can greatly influence these changes. Sometimes, there is a special time when these changes happen. This time is called a 'sensitive period'. Different animals have their sensitive periods at different times. Usually, these times happen early in life and sometimes even before they can do things by themselves.\n\nPeople have noticed that there are special times in early life that can greatly influence how a person will behave when they grow up. This is also an important part of how we understand growing up.\n\nModern ideas about instinct suggest that we can learn more by comparing how people and animals behave. \n\nSome actions are the same for all young birds and mammals of the same species. For instance, birds naturally know how to peck and groom themselves. Baby mammals know how to drink milk and use the bathroom. Some mammals even know how to hunt from a young age. These actions don't need practice, they happen naturally and in the right situations. \n\nIn people, babies know how to find food (rooting), drink milk (sucking), and cry from the moment they're born. Later, they learn to smile and walk. It's also likely that some actions men and women do are also natural. These actions seem to be part of a system of behavior that doesn't change much, no matter where a person grows up. They happen when the right time in a person's life comes, and respond to certain things. This fits with what Freud said about instincts.\n\nThese actions are ready to happen as soon as the right moment comes. They don't need to be learned. But, whether they work the way they're supposed to or not depends on other things. For example, the action itself is one thing, what it's aimed at is another.\n\nThe action only works if it's aimed at the right thing. For example, a newly hatched bird might peck at the ground. If there are seeds there, the bird gets food. If there are only wood chips or chalk, the bird doesn't get any food. In the same way, a baby might suck on something. If it's food, the baby gets nourishment. If it's not food, the baby doesn't get any food. The systems that make birds peck and babies suck are ready to go as soon as the right things are there to make them happen. Whether they work or not doesn't matter.\n\nEven though a lot of things can make these systems go into action, not everything can. From the start, certain things cause certain actions. Some researchers have suggested that how young animals respond to things depends on how strong or weak the thing is. Young animals tend to go towards things that are low, regular, and limited in how strong they are, and tend to move away from things that are high, irregular, and have a wide range of strengths. Even though this way of telling apart things isn't perfect, it often helps young animals stay away from possibly scary places and go towards safe ones. Many things we've seen in smaller animals support this idea, but we don't know how far it goes. Most people who study bigger animals think that the way an animal behaves is decided early on, at least partly by what it sees and hears.\n\nThe examples show that for big animals, young and inexperienced ones can react to a lot of different things. But as they get older, they start reacting to fewer things. For example, in just a few days, a baby chick learns to peck mostly at seeds and ignore things it can't eat, and a human baby prefers milk when it's hungry. Young birds at first will follow a lot of different things they see, but after a few days, they only follow things they've already followed. A human baby will smile at any picture that has two black dots on a pale background; but after a few months, a real human face is needed; and by five months, the baby only smiles at the face of someone it knows. William knew about this and called it the 'Law of habit stopping instinct'.\n\nBut how does it happen that first, babies start reacting to fewer things, and second, a certain reaction gets connected to a certain thing?\n\nOne way is that as babies grow, they get better at telling things apart. As long as they can't tell things apart well, they might treat a lot of different things as if they were the same. Some improvements seem to come from the body growing and not from learning, but other improvements come from experience. This is called 'learning by seeing' or 'learning by being around'. For example, in animals like dogs and cats, being able to see and react to a shape like a circle or a square seems to depend on the animal having seen different shapes before. Sometimes just being familiar with something is enough\u2014the animal doesn't have to have been given a treat. But other times, just seeing isn't enough for the animal to get better at telling things apart. For example, for a kitten to be good at doing things based on what it sees, it has to not only have seen its surroundings, but also have had a chance to move around in them.\n\nOnce babies can tell things apart, there are a few ways that they can start reacting to fewer things. Animals learn to do things by trying again and again. For example, baby birds will keep pecking at things that they can eat and stop pecking at things they can't eat. Baby birds also learn to eat the seeds they can open easily.\n\nAnimals also learn to like things they know and avoid things they don't know. For example, young animals like to go close to things they know. They are not scared at first. But after some time, they learn to know what is safe and what is not. They start to stay away from things they don't know. They also start to act tough when they see things they don't know.\n\nSo, animals learn to like things they know and avoid things they don't know. They also learn to act tough when they see things they don't know. This helps animals stay safe. They stay close to friendly animals and safe places. They stay away from dangers like bad animals.\n\nBut sometimes, animals learn strange things. For example, when young animals of different kinds grow up together, they can become friends. Even a cat and a mouse can become friends if they grow up together. Or, animals that grow up in a small place may act weird. Some animals don't really think about what they do. They either stay away from everything or go to everything. For example, if you look at two-year-old monkeys who live in small areas, they don't play with new things and the smaller the area they live in, the more scared they are. On the other hand, puppies who live in small areas will go to every new thing, even if it's not safe. In both cases, the animals don't really think about what they're doing, which is not good for staying alive.\n\nAnimals usually learn to react to certain things in certain ways by only reacting to a few things out of many possible things. Sometimes though, they learn by starting to react to more things. For example, mother mice will react to more things that are like babies, like even dead babies, after they have had real babies than they would before they had real babies.\n\nThe times in their lives when animals can start to react to more or fewer things are often short. Look at the parts about sensitive times and imprinting.\n\nIn newborn animals, there are some behaviors, like those for making babies, that are either not there at all or are there but not good enough to work. We'll talk about how these behaviors grow in the next part. Right now, we're only talking about behaviors that work from the start.\n\nIn Chapter 5, we talk about the many different ways a behavior can be arranged\u2014from the kind that makes the simplest actions to the kind that makes the most complex actions. Compared to grown-up animals, the behaviors in newborn animals are usually simpler. As they grow, more complex behaviors start to work, and a simple behavior that worked at first might be replaced by a more complex behavior.\n\nFor example, baby geese will follow any moving thing in their first day. After a day or two though, they will only follow a thing they know and if that thing is not there, they will look for it. So a behavior that was simple at first quickly becomes part of a plan. In the same way, baby monkeys change from just grabbing things to following and holding onto things, which are also part of a plan.\n\nThe change from a simple behavior to a more complex one usually happens because the simple behavior becomes part of the more complex one. Once it's a part of the simpler system, it's not as easy to start it as before. Instead of starting right away from simple things (big or small), it doesn't start until very special things happen. These special things can be waited for, or they can be helped by different but right actions - like a baby duck looking for something.\n\nIn grown-up meat-eating animals and monkeys, actions sometimes seem to be set up in simple plans. For example, how lions catch other animals to eat or how a group of monkeys change their shape to keep safe from animals that want to eat them is easiest to understand this way. However, such smart ways of setting up actions are only done by animals that are quite grown-up: young lions and young monkeys can't do this.\n\nA change in the type of system controlling actions from a simple thing-response type to a goal-corrected type is often seen as a change from actions guided by try and fail to actions guided by understanding. By Piaget it's seen as a change from actions set up on the base of sense-motor smartness to actions set up on the base of symbol and pre-idea thought. To show what he means by this step in growing, Piaget (1947) writes: 'sense-motor smartness acts like a slow motion film, in which all the pictures are seen one after the other but without joining, and so without the continuous vision necessary for understanding the whole', whereas the more advanced way of setting up is like a film shown at the right speed.\n\nIn humans, growing in the mind is marked not only by simple systems' being replaced by goal-corrected systems, but also by the person's becoming more and more aware of the set-goals he has chosen, by his making more and more smart plans for achieving them, and by his increasing ability to relate one plan to another, to find when plans don't match and to put them in order of importance. In mind-study words these changes are described as being due to the replacing of id by ego.\n\nThe first steps in such growing are shown by the change that happens during a child's first two or three years of life in the types of system effecting bladder control, a process studied by McGraw(1943). During the first year of human life letting out of bladder contents is controlled by a reflex action, sensitive during the first six months to a wide range of things and becoming restricted during the second six months to a more limited range. Early in the second year the action loses the automaticity of a reflex action. The baby seems, however, still unaware both of the action itself and of its results, and for a short time he may become more co-operative and predictable in his actions. This phase also passes, however, and many children become especially un-co-operative for a while. By the end of the second year, little ones learn to use the bathroom on their own. They wait until they find the right place before they go. This is a goal they work towards. To reach this goal, they follow a simple plan. First, they look for the potty, then sit on it. They learn this step by step. \n\nIf they can find the potty, it means they remember where things are in the house. \n\nA simple reaction to many things becomes a plan to do something very specific.\n\nPeople think the same thing happens when children learn to love others. In the beginning, they just move towards people. In the second and third years, they start to make plans and goals. These plans get more complex and might include changing how the person they love behaves. This will be talked about more in Part IV.\n\nAnother example is how children learn to eat. At first, eating is just a reaction to being hungry. They root, suck, and swallow. After a few months, they only start eating when they see their mom ready with food. By the second year, they learn new ways to eat, like grabbing food, bringing it to their mouth, biting, and chewing. As they grow, the plan to eat gets more complex and takes more time. They learn to buy food, prepare it, cook it, and so on. Even in simple communities, eating becomes part of a big plan that might take a year and includes growing, collecting, storing, and cooking food.\n\nSo, while babies and children can only make simple plans, teenagers and adults can make very complex plans. As a child grows, they learn more and more. They start to use symbols, like language, to understand the world.\n\nPeople often say that humans don't have instinctive behavior. This is because as we grow, our simple actions become more complex and change. Instead of acting on instinct, we start to think and make choices. For example, a baby might cry when they are hungry, but as they grow older, they learn to wait for their meal.\n\nOur brain grows as we grow, and it helps us to learn and do more things. At first, a baby's brain can only control simple actions, like moving their eyes to follow something. But as they grow, different parts of their brain start to work and they can do more complicated things. For example, they start to recognize patterns and can wait for a short time. But even after two years, some parts of the brain are still not fully developed, so a child's thinking and planning are still quite simple.\n\nEven when a child is two years old, some parts of their brain are still not fully developed. These parts of the brain help us to think ahead and make plans. So, only when a child is older, they can start to make choices based on things that are not happening right now.\n\nSo, it's clear that a child's ability to learn and do things depends on how much their brain has developed. If the brain is not ready, a child can't learn certain things. And until they can learn these things, they act more on what feels good than on what is real.\n\nAs we grow, we start to replace simple actions with more complex ones. This helps us to adapt and work better. But there can also be problems. Sometimes, when we switch from one system to another, things can go wrong and the new system can be less efficient.\n\nLearning how to do things step by step\n\nSo far, we have talked about things that work right away and as they grow, they get better but still do the same job. But, some things don't work at first and only start working when they join with other things. When they first start, each part only does a little bit on its own, or does something at the wrong time or in the wrong order.\n\nTake a squirrel hiding a nut for example. It's a lot of steps, like digging, putting the nut in, pushing it down with its nose, covering it up, and stamping. Each part of this starts at a certain time and doesn't need practice, but if the whole thing is going to work, the squirrel usually needs to practice. For example, a young squirrel might dig a hole and put a nut in, but cover up the wrong spot. Only with practice does the squirrel do it right so that it can find the nut later.\n\nYoung animals sometimes do things by instinct that don't work yet. This happens when they are learning how to have babies. A young bird might start to make pieces of a nest, or try to sing a mating song, but it does it at the wrong time or in the wrong place. Young animals of many kinds, both boys and girls, will climb on each other but they don't know how to mate properly. People have seen this happen in monkeys, which is very interesting.\n\nYoung monkeys don't become adults until they are older than four years. But, they start to show parts of mating behavior when they are very young. Young boy monkeys have been seen to have erections when they are about six weeks old, especially when their mother is grooming them. They start to make humping movements a little later and not always when they are in the right position. They might do this to their own mother.\n\nErections and humping have also been seen in baby chimpanzees. In both monkeys and chimpanzees, these can happen when the animal is excited; for example, when they see a friend after being apart, at mealtime, when there are strangers around, and when they are being held still. Looking at all this, one person concluded that 'the different parts [of male mating behavior] seem to show up at different times as the animal grows and are related to experience and what causes them'.\n\nThese observations show that pieces of mating behavior that don't work yet happen in young members of many, maybe all, types of primates and often first happen towards parents. Little kids sometimes show signs of liking each other very much, just like grown-ups do. But they don't really know what it means, they just copy what they see. They might hug each other, or lie close to each other, but they don't really know why.\n\nJust like that, little girls, and sometimes boys, might act like a mommy to a doll or a real baby. They might hold them, feed them, and take care of them just like a mommy would. But then they might get distracted and forget about the doll or baby.\n\nThese things that kids do are just bits and pieces of what grown-ups do. But how these pieces come together and make a whole picture, that's something interesting. For example, a baby chicken will follow anything that moves, look for a safe place when scared, and look for warmth when cold. In a farm, all these things lead the baby chicken to its mommy chicken.\n\nThings that we do can be linked together. For example, a puppy can learn to eat when it is hungry and not just when food is given to it. Or a bird can learn to peck for food instead of always asking its parents for food.\n\nSometimes, what we do can change based on how we feel. For example, a cat might act differently when it is happy or when it has experienced something new.\n\nThese changes can happen in many animals, not just cats or birds. When these changes happen, the animal can do things more easily and might not need the same things it needed before to do them.\n\nFor example, a person can learn to do many different things and can change how they do things based on what they have learned. This means that what a person does can be different from what another person does, even if they are trying to do the same thing. People act different before and after they learn about certain things, like when they learn about hugs and kisses. After they learn, they might do things faster and skip steps, and they might not feel as happy as they thought they would. Sometimes, people know what will happen when they do something, like when they eat food or give a hug. But sometimes, they don't know, like when they don't know that eating food makes them grow, or that giving hugs makes them feel happy. Sometimes, people might do things without knowing what will happen, like eating food that doesn't make them grow, or giving a hug but not feeling happy. \n\nIt's important to know that how a person acts when they grow up depends a lot on how they grew up. Sometimes, how a person acts can change a lot depending on where they are in life. Sometimes, they can be very sensitive to what's happening around them, and other times, they might not be.\n\nThere are times when people only do certain things when they see or hear certain things. Like how baby birds will follow the first thing they see moving after they are born. They will only follow that thing and will not follow anything else. Learning quickly about things that are common and then following them is called 'copying'. This also happens in young animals. Because these things are really important to talk about how a child feels about his mom, we will talk about it in the next part.\n\nSometimes, the things that other behaviors are pointed towards can also be limited at certain times of life.\n\nAn interesting example is how we choose what to like as we get older. We usually don't see full love behaviors in birds or animals until they are a certain age. But, the things that they will like when they are older are often decided before they are grown up. This is very clear when an animal grows up with animals of a different kind and then likes those kinds of animals: in animals that grow up in a human home, they sometimes like men and women.\n\nWe don't know a lot about when young animals decide what they like. That's why recent experiments with young ducks are interesting. Samuel (1965a) found that what a grown-up male duck likes is influenced by what kind of bird they spend time with when they are about three weeks to eight weeks old, which is before they show full love behaviors. When they grow up with a mom or siblings of their own kind, male ducks always mate with females of their own kind. The same is true when they grow up with birds of their own kind and a few others of different kinds. But, when they grow up with only birds of a different kind, two-thirds of them only mate with a female of that other kind. However, when they grow up with birds of a kind that is not related to them, like chicken or another bird, the male ducks do not like individuals of this other kind.\n\nThese findings show that what a male duck likes is biased towards birds of his own kind from the start; that it can change to like birds of a closely related kind; but that it never changes to like birds of an unrelated kind.\n\nAnother finding of Samuel is that growing up with a mom of another kind is more likely to lead to a liking for a female of that kind than growing up with siblings. However, it is rare for birds that grow up together to mate with each other, so the liking established in these early weeks is for members of the kind in general and not for any individual of it in particular.\n\nIn 1965, a man named Cameron told a story about how a male duck will pick another male duck as a partner if it only grows up with other male ducks for at least seventy-five days. After that, the male duck does not like female ducks anymore and only wants to be with the male duck it picked. Even when they can't have baby ducks together, the male duck still likes the other male duck more.\n\nThis is not strange because it happens in many animals. Even when it is not good for having babies, once an animal likes a certain kind of partner, it usually does not change even if a better partner comes along. This can be seen in humans too.\n\nMaternal behavior, or how a mother behaves towards her babies, can also be influenced by the environment in many birds and mammals. For example, small birds will take care of a baby cuckoo bird that appears in their nest even though it is not their baby. Many birds will act as parents to baby birds of a different kind, and there are many stories of female mammals acting as mothers to babies of another species. However, this behavior is not permanent; once they have the experience of taking care of a different species, they do not always prefer that species.\n\nBut, in some mammals, the baby towards which the mother shows care is chosen shortly after the baby is born. For example, shepherds know that a female sheep who loses her baby will only take care of the lost baby and will not easily take care of another baby sheep. This behavior is also seen in a story told by Henry, Matthew, and Ryan in 1958. They said that a mother goat who had two babies refused to take care of one baby because it was taken away for two hours after it was born. This shows that the mother chooses who to take care of very quickly after giving birth.\n\nThe ways animals move and behave are also influenced by their environment. For example, many animals who grow up alone in a small cage have certain ways of moving that are different from other animals. Even if things don't change, once we learn something, it stays with us even if things around us change. This is like when we play games that need our bodies to move in a special way. If a person learns to hit the ball in a certain way in a game like tennis, it is very hard for them to change that and learn a better way. They will keep going back to the way they first learned.\n\nThis is why Henry believes that if we do something once, we are more likely to do it again.\n\nWe have also seen that in some animals, they learn what type of things they like before they grow up. In monkeys, there is clear proof that they also learn how to act when they like someone when they are still young. After many tests where monkeys were raised in different ways, Henry says:\n\nWe have seen that the way monkeys act when they like someone is greatly affected by what happens when they are young, and if baby monkeys don't form strong relationships with other baby monkeys, they may not be able to form strong relationships when they are grown up (Henry and Hannah, 1965).\n\nIn the past, Henry and Hannah said that monkeys develop normally if they can play with other monkeys their age, even if they have no experience of being cared for by a monkey mother. But more recent findings show that there are big differences between monkeys and that not all of them grow up to be normal. Henry says: 'I am now sure that there is no replacement for monkey mothers in the early part of the monkey's life.'\n\nHenry and Hannah also found that male monkeys change more based on their environment than female monkeys do. They found a similar thing in chimpanzees. In a study looking at how male monkeys and chimpanzees grow up, Matthew (1965) says:\n\nMonkeys start doing adult things earlier than chimpanzees... If the male monkey has enough other monkeys to be with, it starts acting like an adult monkey before it grows up, but the chimpanzee doesn't... On the other hand, a male monkey that doesn't start acting like an adult by the time it grows up probably won't start later, but the chimpanzee can still learn... A male monkey that doesn't have enough other monkeys to learn from when it grows up is probably going to have a hard time because it will be too playful and aggressive.\n\nMatthew's last sentence reminds us that if monkeys want to be successful, they need to learn to control some of their behaviors. For example, boys can act tough when dealing with bullies, and sometimes when dealing with other boys. But, it's not good if they act tough with girls or younger kids. Also, being nice and caring should show at the right times. To be a good friend, a grown-up animal must know when to show different feelings and keep a balance.\n\nWe are not sure when and how these feelings grow in animals that are like humans. We also don't know what things need to happen when they are babies, kids, and teenagers to make these feelings grow in a good way. This is even more true for humans. We think there are important times in human growth, but we need to learn more about them. Until we do, we need to be careful. If a human child's life is very different from the life of children long ago (which was probably with mom, dad, brothers, sisters, grandparents, and a few other families they know), they might not learn how to act in a good way.\n\nLearning by Heart\n\n_What the Word Means_\n\nSince people often ask if human babies learn by heart, it's good to understand what the word means and how we use it today.\n\nThe word 'learning by heart' is used in two different ways today, both from Lorenz's early studies of baby ducks and geese (Lorenz, 1935). One way is narrow, the other way is broad.\n\nIn the narrow way, the word is closely tied to Lorenz's first ideas about learning by heart. In his early papers, Lorenz noticed that in many kinds of birds, the feeling of love quickly focuses on a certain thing, or type of thing. He also suggested that the way this happens is special: 'learning by heart has special features that make it very different from just learning. No other animal, especially a mammal, has something equal to it' (Lorenz, 1935). Lorenz said learning by heart has four special features: (i) it only happens during a short important time in life, (ii) it can't be undone, (iii) it is learning beyond the individual, and (iv) it can influence actions that have not yet developed in the animal, like choosing a mate. Lorenz also said learning by heart is the learning that happens in a young bird when it follows a moving thing.\n\nIn the thirty years since Lorenz said these things, our understanding has changed. We now know more about the things Lorenz noticed and that the important time and the fact that it can't be undone are not as clear as he thought. We also know that the same type of learning can happen even when the young animal is not following something \u2013 when it sees a still pattern, for example. Thanks to a man named Liam's work, we now know that some things we thought only happened with imprinting can happen with other types of learning too, even in mammals. So, what we first thought was only black and white, we now see as different shades of grey.\n\nBecause of this, the word imprinting now means more things. Now, it can mean how a baby bird or mammal starts to like one or more things more than others. It can also mean how other types of behavior start to be aimed at certain things, like how a mom acts towards her babies or how animals act towards their mates. A man named Benjamin in 1966 said:\n\nEven though many responses only happen to the first things that caused them, social preferences in birds is a very clear example. So clear, in fact, that how other preferences and habits are learned are often classified by how similar they are to it. This process that makes social preferences aim at a specific group of things is usually called 'imprinting'.\n\nOther types of behavior that are also called imprinting include an animal's liking for a certain home or place (for example, a man named Thomas in 1956 talked about this).\n\nIn the later part of the 20th century, people stopped asking which was the better use of the word, the narrow or the broad. In two standard books on the topic, the authors, a man named Samuel in 1965 and Benjamin in 1966, use it in its broad sense. The truth is that, even though some of Liam's first ideas were wrong, the things he pointed out are so interesting and the word he introduced is so useful that, whatever the exact processes may be, the word is here to stay.\n\nWhen we use the word in its broad sense, it always means: (a) the development of a clear preference, (b) a preference that happens quickly, and usually during a certain part of life, and (c) a preference that, once it's there, doesn't change much. While the responses that might be caused by the preferred thing can be of many types, and can change as an individual grows up, they are all about approaching (including sometimes approach-attack).\n\nBut, current use of the word leaves many things open. It doesn't say if the processes that cause the phenomena in different species are all the same or if they differ from species to species, from order to order, or from class to class. This is important because, as a man named Henry always says, the evolution paths that led to birds on the one hand and mammals on the other separated a long time ago, back in the time of the early reptiles. Animals show love to their parents in different ways. Some animals learn to love their parents from the start, and some learn it over time. This love can look the same in different animals, but it might be because they learned it in similar ways, not because they are the same.\n\nWhy do we look at how birds love their parents? Because we have learned a lot from studying birds. We call the way birds learn to love their parents \"imprinting\".\n\n_Learning Love in Birds_\n\nThis is what we learned from people who study birds like Sluckin and Bateson and Hinde:\n\ni. Just after they are born, baby birds of many kinds show love for anything they see or hear. They want to stay close to it, follow it when it moves, and look for it when it's gone. They also change their sounds depending on if the thing they love is there or not. When it's gone, they make sad sounds, but when they find it, they make happy sounds. This shows that a lot of what the bird does is affected by what it loves.\n\nii. Baby birds can learn to love a lot of things they see or hear, but some things are easier to love than others. For example, they can learn to love something that moves or has lots of colors faster and longer than something that doesn't move or is plain. Also, for some birds, hearing sounds like quacking can help them love something they see more. So, from the start, a baby bird is more likely to learn to love some things more than others.\n\niii. Lorenz thought that birds learn to love something really fast, maybe even just from seeing it once. But now we know that the more a bird sees something, the more it loves it.\n\niv. The way birds learn to love looks a lot like the way we learn to know things by seeing them a lot. This doesn't have to do with getting something good. This makes Hinde and Sluckin agree with Lorenz that the way birds learn to love is different from other ways of learning because it's not like training.\n\nv. There is a time when baby birds can learn to love something very easily. Some learning can happen before and after the time when we learn the most. So, Liam's idea that there is a special time for learning with a clear start and end might need to be changed a bit, especially about the end.\n\nvi. The time when baby birds start to learn a lot is not really changed by what they experience after they hatch. This means that the start of this time is because of how the bird grows and doesn't change much because of what's around them.\n\nvii. The time when birds stop being ready to learn a lot can change more. What changes this time and how it changes is something people still talk about.\n\nA lot of tests show that if a baby bird is kept alone in a boring place it doesn't learn a lot and can still learn; but once it has learned about one thing it gets harder to learn about other things. So, keeping a bird alone can make the learning time longer (but not forever); but, once learning has happened, the learning time ends. If this was the only thing happening we could just say 'learning stops when learning happens'.\n\nEven though Benjamin (a long time ago) thinks this is true, it looks like for some animals at least, there is another thing happening at the same time. The second thing, thought of by Henry (also a long time ago), is that as the animal gets older it gets easier to scare and harder to get used to things.\n\nWhether this is true or not, there is no question that, once a bird has learned about one thing, it is likely to be scared of every other thing it meets. If it can, it will stay away from anything new, so it doesn't spend much time with it and can't learn about it. The more the bird has learned about the first thing, the more it will avoid anything new.\n\nIf a young animal is made to stay with a new thing, however, it might get a little or completely used to being scared. In this case a new thing might eventually be approached and even followed; and it might even be liked more than the original thing. Whether this happens probably depends on a lot of things, one of the most important being how much the animal has learned about the first thing. But, because sometimes a new thing can be liked more, it is clear that there are some situations where learning can be undone.\n\nviii. It is clear that Liam was not completely right when he said that learning cannot be undone. How much an animal likes something can be very strong or very weak and depends on many things: including the kind of animal, how long the young animal has been with the thing it learned about, and the behavior being thought about, i.e. Whether it's a young animal following its mom or dad in the days or weeks after it first sees them, or how it acts when it grows up, even if it can change, what it likes once it really likes it tends to stay the same: there are many stories of animals liking something a lot even when it's gone for a long time.\n\nThere's something we still don't understand about how an animal learns what makes it different from other animals and what makes its type of animal different from other types. At first, Lorenz thought that when an animal first sees something, it learns about a whole group of things, like all birds, not just one bird, and that this helps it learn how to act before it can even do those things. Now, there's some proof that both of those things can happen in some animals. But, when a baby bird learns what its mom or dad looks like and follows them, it's clear that the baby bird is learning about its own mom or dad, not all birds. (As Hinde (1963) said, a baby bird that can't tell its mom or dad from other birds could get in trouble since a different mom or dad bird might try to hurt it.)\n\nWe talk about this in mammals and whether people do it too in later parts, especially Part 12.\n\nWe talk about old and new ideas about instinctive behaviour\n\nIn this and before, we've talked about how many people who study behaviour today think about instinctive behaviour, some problems they have and some ideas they've thought of. During this, we've had many chances to show that the current ideas about instinct are dealing with the same problems that old ideas about the mind have and are thinking of ideas that are either the same as or very close to those old ideas. Whether or not the new ideas will explain things better than the old, they don't ignore either the facts of the old ideas or those ideas that come easily from the facts. It's only when we think about things on a higher level that the two groups of ideas are really different.\n\nThe kind of idea we're talking about is, as we've said, directly from the idea Darwin talked about in _The Origin of Species_. It sees instinctive behaviour as the result of behavioural structures that start when something happens and stop when something else happens. Complex sequences of behaviour are seen as because of the order in which behavioural units start and stop, their order being controlled by a higher behavioural structure organised as a chain, as a cause hierarchy, as a plan hierarchy, or as some combine of them all. In some of these ways the idea proposed includes ideas Freud thought of in works like _Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality_ (1905) and 'Instincts and their vicissitudes' (1915a), in which he talks about part-instincts, differentiates the aim of an instinct (namely the conditions that stop instinctive behaviour) and its function, and notes how flexible are the objects towards which any particular sort of instinctive behaviour is directed.\n\nIt is known that the new ideas are different from certain other ideas that Mr. Frank talked about. One such is that of energy that flows and can be released in different ways. Others are those found in a famous book and later works, in which Frank tries to understand certain ways of acting as expressions of very general forces, the life and death instincts. Whereas Frank's later theories imagine the organism as starting life with a lot of unstructured energy that during growth becomes more structured\u2014'where id is there shall ego be'\u2014current theory, in line with many of Frank's earlier ideas, imagines the organism as starting with, or developing, a big but limited number of structured behavior systems (some of which are active at birth and some of which become so later) which during growth become so advanced through processes of learning and integration, and in man by copying and the use of signs, that the resulting behavior is of amazing variety and flexibility. Whether or not it is also adapted depends on the many and different events of growth.\n\nIn the system of theory suggested, the belief that to understand the strange and often not well adapted changes to which instinctive behavior is subject needs a theory of a general purpose energy is rejected as not needed. When a behavior structure is activated physical energy is, of course, used; but there is no bigger need to suggest energy to account for the behavior of an animal than there is to suggest it in order to account for the behavior of a mechanical control system. The existence of not well adapted behavior and of behavior that appears as though it is a substitute for some other behavior can be explained in a number of ways none of which calls for the idea of an energy that can be diverted from one way to another. Similarly, changes in the intensity of a piece of behavior are due to changes in the activating conditions present and to the developmental state of the behavior systems activated, and not to a raised pressure of energy. Frank's concept of _Trieb_ , so unfortunately translated as 'instinct', is therefore done away with; and with it, of course, the 'economic' approach.\n\nThe good points of a scientific theory are to be judged in terms of the range of things it covers, the internal consistency of its structure, the precision of the predictions it can make and the practicability of testing them. On each of these criteria, it is held, the new type of theory scores well. In particular, with concepts such as those advanced and with observational and experimental methods derived from ethology and comparative psychology, it is now possible to undertake a wide-ranging programme of research into the social responses of man, from the preverbal period of infancy onwards. In that way the repertoire of behavior systems mediating human instinctive behavior may be catalogued and the mode of development of each identified. We can study each thing to understand what starts it and what ends it, and why some people start and end things differently. We can look at why some actions are too small or too big, and why they stay that way. We can also study what happens when two things that don't work together start at the same time and how this is managed. Finally, we want to understand the times when we learn to manage these problems and what makes one way of managing become the main one in a person.\n\nThis short description talks about a lot of things. Some doctors will think differently about it and how it connects to the old way of learning about early growth by looking at later growth. But, we are just starting to see the results of this new way, so it's too early to say if it's good. For many, this new way brings hope that by using better ideas and methods to study early emotional growth, we might start a time when we have more trustworthy information to make better theories.\n\n A lot of what comes next, including examples, comes from a book about animal behavior by H. This book talks a lot about how behavior grows.\n\n There is proof, talked about by B in 1965, that when babies are learning to move their big body parts, it is controlled by parts of their brain. When only these parts of the brain are working, babies can only notice changes in how big something is. To respond to changes in patterns, other parts of the brain need to help. The fact that these parts of the brain are not very important in early babyhood for some animals, including people, fits with what S said. But, it doesn't mean that when we start to respond to changes in patterns, it's because we learned it.\n\n S in 1965 said that the term 'learning to notice' can mean many different things. For this reason, he likes the term 'learning from seeing', first suggested by D: 'It clearly means that the animal is noticing the place where it lives.' The results seem to be because the animal has learned about the thing it's seeing, and not because it has connected any thing with a response.\n\n For example, new watching of grown-up monkeys who grew up alone in another place does not agree with H's idea that they have big problems with boy-girl behavior. Some smart people, like Matthew (1965) and Henry, don't agree on their findings.\n\nBateson (1966) doesn't fully agree with two other smart people. He thinks learning from seeing and learning from doing are not very different. But, none of these people agree with a thought from Mr. M (1960), that a young creature's liking for an object comes from feeling safe around it. As another smart person (1965) says, such an idea is not necessary and is too complicated. It only makes sense to people who believe that all learning must be connected with lessening worries.\nPart III\n\nBEING CLOSE TO SOMEONE\n_Chapter 11_\n\nA Child's Close Connection to his Mother: Being Close to Someone\n\nI started by saying two things that are new to me: that a girl's strong liking for her father is just taking over from a strong liking for her mother, and that this first stage has lasted for a long time.\n\nEverything about this first liking for the mother seemed so hard to understand...\n\nSAMUEL F (1931)\n\nDifferent thoughts\n\nUNDERSTANDING WHY a child reacts to being separated from or losing his mother-figure needs an understanding of the bond that ties him to that figure. In some writings, this has been talked about in terms of object relations. So in any talk about traditional theory, the words of object relations have to be used; but in a new theory, words like 'being close' and 'figure of being close' are better.\n\nFor a long time, people have agreed that a child's first relationship with a human is the base of his personality; but there is still no agreement on what that relationship is like and where it comes from. Because it's very important, people have strong feelings and sharp differences. Even though everyone agrees that in a year almost all babies have a strong liking for a mother\u2013figure, there is no agreement on how fast this happens, how it stays, how long it lasts, or what its purpose is.\n\nUntil 1958, when Henry's first papers and an early version of the ideas talked about here (B, 1958) were published, four main theories about the nature and start of the child's tie were in the writings. They are:\n\n  1. The child has several needs like food and warmth that must be met. If a baby becomes interested in and likes a human figure, especially mother, it is because the mother meets the baby's needs and the baby learns that she is the source of his happiness. Let's think step by step:\n 1. There is a way of thinking that says kids learn to love the one who gives them food and care. We can call this the 'food-love' idea.\n  2. Babies like to be close to a person, to feed from them and to be with them. Later, the baby learns that the person who feeds them is their mom and they start to love her too. We can call this the 'first love' idea.\n  3. Babies also like to be close to and hold onto a person. They 'need' someone to hold just like they 'need' food and warmth. We can call this the 'hug-love' idea.\n  4. Babies don't like it when they are born and want to go back to the warm place inside mom. We can call this the 'back-home' idea.\n\nOut of these four ideas, the one that most people believe in is the 'food-love' idea. Some smart people have said things like:\n\nlove starts from the need to be fed (a smart person, long ago).\n\nmaybe when a child is being fed, they learn to like being with others (two smart people, not so long ago).\n\nI wrote a paper about this a while ago and I talked about what other smart people had said up until then.\n\nWhat I want to say is different from these ideas. I think that a child's love for their mom comes from lots of different ways of behaving that make the child want to be close to their mom. This can be different for each child and can change as the child gets older. Once a child can move around and is in their second year, they usually show love for their mom. This love is easily seen when the mom leaves or if the child is scared. The things that calm the child the most are the sound, sight, or touch of their mom. Until about when a child is three years old, they easily show love to their mom. Then, as they get older, they show love less easily and they also start to show love to other people.\n\nBeing close to others is seen as a kind of social behavior just as important as making friends and taking care of others. It is thought to have a special purpose that has not been talked about much.\n\nIn this idea, we don't talk about 'needs' or 'drives'. Instead, being close to others is seen as what happens when certain behaviors are turned on. These behaviors are thought to grow in the child because of his experiences in his usual surroundings, especially his experiences with the most important person in those surroundings, his mother. Eating and food are thought to not play a big part in their growth.\n\nOf the four main ideas found in books, the ones about sucking and holding on to the main object are closest to the idea we are suggesting: each one suggests a natural tendency to behave in a certain way towards things with certain qualities. The theories with which the current idea has nothing in common are those of secondary drive and wanting to go back to the womb: the first one is talked about; the second one is rejected as unnecessary and not likely from a biology point of view.\n\nThe idea suggested is a development of the one I suggested in the late 20th century. The main change is due to a better understanding of control theory and to recognizing the very complex forms that behaviors controlling natural behavior may take. In the current version of the idea it is suggested that, at some stage in the growth of the behaviors responsible for attachment, being close to mother becomes a goal. In the earlier version of the theory five behaviors\u2014sucking, holding on, following, crying, and smiling\u2014were described as contributing to attachment. In the new version these same five behaviors are still thought to be very important, but it is suggested that between the ages of about nine and eighteen months they usually become part of far more complex goal-corrected systems. These systems are so organized and turned on that a child tends to stay close to his mother.\n\nThe earlier version of the theory was described as a theory of instinctual responses. The new version can be described as a control theory of being close to others behavior.\n\nBefore this theory is described in more detail, with some of the evidence it is based on (see chapters 12 and ), it is helpful to compare the being close to others behavior seen in human children with that seen in young animals of other species and to think about what is known about the natural history of such behavior.\n\nBeing close to others behavior and its place in nature\n\nIn the countryside in springtime there is no more usual sight than mother animals with young. In the fields, cows and calves, mares and foals, ewes and lambs; in the ponds and rivers, ducks and ducklings, swans and cygnets. So usual are these sights and so much do we take it for granted that lamb and ewe will stay together and that a group of ducklings will stay with mother duck that the questions are rarely asked: What makes these animals stay in each other's company? What purpose is fulfilled by their doing so?\n\nIn some types of animals, babies can move around a few hours after they are born. They usually follow their mom if she goes somewhere. In other types, like meat-eating animals, mice, and humans, babies need more time to move around. But once they can, they also like to stay close to their mom. Sometimes, the baby might wander off, and the mom will bring it back. But other times, if the baby finds itself alone, it will find its way back to mom.\n\nThere are two main things about this behavior. The first is staying close to another animal and getting back to them if separated. The second is knowing who that other animal is. Usually, a parent can tell their own babies apart from others just hours after they are born or hatched. And the babies can also tell who their parents are from other grown-ups. So, both parents and babies act towards each other in special ways that are different from how they act with other animals.\n\nSometimes, things don't go as usual. A baby might start following a different animal or even a thing that's not alive. But this doesn't happen a lot in nature, so we don't need to worry about it too much.\n\nThere are different ways babies stay close to their moms. For example, a baby might call out to its mom, or it might move towards her. Since all these things result in the baby being close to mom, we call them 'attachment behavior'. Any one of these things can be considered a part of attachment behavior.\n\nThere is also a term for the behavior of parents that goes with the attachment behavior of babies. We call it 'caregiving behavior', and we will talk more about it in Chapter 13.\n\nAttachment behavior and caregiving behavior are common in birds that nest on the ground and leave the nest soon after hatching. They are also found in all types of mammals. Unless something goes wrong, babies usually show attachment behavior towards their mom. In animals where the dad helps raise the little ones, they might start to like him a lot too. In people, they might also start to like a few other people (we'll talk about this more in Chapter 15).\n\nHow long this kind of liking lasts can be different for different animals. Usually, it lasts until they grow up, but not always until they are fully grown. For many birds, this kind of liking stops when the young ones are ready to find a mate, which might be after their first winter, or, like in geese and swans, after their second or third winter. But for many animals like sheep, deer, and cows, it's different for boys and girls. The girls might keep liking their mom until they are very old. So, a group of sheep, or deer, is made up of little ones liking their mom, who likes her mom, who likes her mom, and so on. The boys of these animals, however, stop liking their mom when they become teenagers. After that, they start to like older boys and stay with them all their lives, except for a few weeks each year when they are looking for a mate.\n\nMonkeys and apes like their mom a lot when they are babies and little kids, but when they become teenagers, they don't like their mom as much. Even though people used to think that they stop liking their mom then, new facts show that, at least for some animals, they still like their mom when they are grown-ups; because of this, there are groups of animals that all have the same mom. Looking at the facts from Sade (1965) for rhesus monkeys and from Goodall (1965) for chimpanzees, Washburn, Jay, and Lancaster (1965) say that these family groups are made because the mom is always with her newborn baby, which makes close groups between brothers and sisters; and they think 'that this kind of close relationship between a mom and her babies will be found in other types of monkeys'.\n\nBecause human babies are born very young and take a long time to grow, no animal takes so long to start liking their mom. This is probably one reason why until a few years ago, people did not realize that the way a human child likes his mom is the same kind of way that many animals like their mom. Another reason might be that it's only in the last twenty years that people have started to really study how animals like their mom. Whatever the reasons, it's now very clear that a child's liking for his mom is the same kind of liking that we see in many other animals; and that's how we look at this kind of liking.\n\nWe need to be careful. The ways animals changed over time to become birds or mammals are different. They started being different a long time ago when there were only reptiles. So, it's very likely that the way young animals become attached to their parents also developed differently in these two groups. We also know that birds' brains are very different from mammals' brains. So, it's also very likely that the things that make young animals become attached to their parents are different for birds and mammals. So, when we talk about what we know from watching birds, we need to remember that it's just a guess. But when we talk about what we know from watching young mammals, we can be more sure. And if we see something in monkeys or apes, we can be pretty sure that it's the same in people.\n\nWe don't know a lot about how babies become attached to their parents and how this changes as they grow up. To help us understand this better, we're going to talk about what we know from watching monkeys, baboons, and apes.\n\nAttachment in monkeys and apes\n\nWhen they are born, or soon after, all baby monkeys and apes, except for people, hold on to their mothers. During their early years, they are either touching their mother or only a few steps away from her. The mother also keeps the baby close to her. As the young ones grow older, they spend less of the day touching their mother and they start going further away; but they still sleep with her at night and run to her when they are scared. In some types, it's likely that the young ones feel close to their mother until they are teenagers, and in some types this feeling continues, but it's weaker, when they are adults.\n\nGirl monkeys and apes are less active and less curious than boys. When they are teenagers, girls are likely to be found in the middle of a group, often close to adult males, while teenage boys are likely to be found at the edge of the group or even by themselves.\n\nNext, we will talk about how baby monkeys and apes become attached to their mothers in four types\u2014two types of monkeys, the rhesus monkey and the baboon, and two types of apes, the chimpanzee and the gorilla. We chose these types because:\n\n  1. All four types, and especially baboons and gorillas, live on the ground;\n  2. We have good studies for all four types;\n  3. For two types, rhesus monkeys and chimpanzees, we also have experiments.\n\nAlthough we will say things in a simple way, we need to remember that animals in the same type can behave differently and that animals in one group of a type can behave differently from animals in another group of the same type. Some differences between groups of animals can be explained by where they live, but some are because of new things one animal started doing and showed to others in its group.\n\n_Monkey Behavior_\n\nMonkeys have been watched in places close to their natural homes and also in places made for them to live in. They are found a lot in a place in the north part of IN country. Some still live in forests, but many live in villages and on farmland. They spend a lot of their day on the ground, but at night they go up into trees or on top of roofs. Groups of monkeys have both male and female adults, young ones, and babies, and they stay together for a long time in a small area. The groups can be as small as about fifteen monkeys or as big as over a hundred monkeys.\n\nThe monkeys grow up at about four years old, are fully grown at about six years old, and can live for about twenty more years. Until they are about three years old, baby monkeys stay close to their mothers. At that age, most boys leave their mothers and hang out with other young monkeys at the edge of the group or go to other groups. Girls probably stay with their mothers for longer. Boys with mothers who are leaders sometimes stay with their mothers, and when they grow up, these boys usually become leaders in the group.\n\nSome researchers have given a very detailed description of how baby monkeys and their mothers behave with each other during the first two and a half years of the baby monkey's life.\n\nWhen baby monkeys are born, some of them immediately grab onto their mother's fur, and they also tend to climb up her body. Other babies, however, at first keep their arms and legs bent and are then held only by their mother. No baby monkey starts to drink milk from its mother until several hours after it's born, the longest time being over nine hours. Once the baby finds the place to drink milk, it holds on for a long time, though only a small part of that time is spent drinking.\n\nDuring the first week or two of its life, the baby monkey is always touching its mother, spending almost all the daytime hours holding onto its mother with its hands, feet, and mouth, and at night-time being held by her. After that, the baby starts to go on short trips away from its mother and she away from it during the day; but until it is six weeks old, almost none of these trips is further than two feet away\u2014close enough, in fact, for mother to bring the baby back to her whenever she wants. After that, its trips go further and last longer. Only when it is about ten weeks old does a baby start to spend half the day away from its mommy. After its first birthday, the baby spends more than 70 per cent of the day away from mommy.\n\nDuring their second year, babies spend most of their day where they can see mommy, but are not touching her. But they still spend a lot of the day\u2014usually between 10 to 20 per cent of it\u2014in actual contact with her, and the whole night. Only after their second birthday does the time spent touching mommy during the day become really small.\n\nWho decides when to break and start contact is sometimes the mommy and sometimes the baby. This changes as the baby gets older. During the first few weeks, the babies sometimes want to explore bravely, and the mommies often stop them. After the first two months, this starts to change. Mommy stops less and sometimes says no. From this time, the baby plays a bigger role in staying close to its mommy. But mommy still plays a big part, maybe telling the baby not to get too close when she's sitting quietly and there's no danger, but quickly going to the baby when she's about to move or gets scared.\n\nWhen mommy moves any distance, the baby usually travels under her belly, holding onto mommy's fur with hands and feet and a nipple with its mouth. During the first week or two, some mommies give a little extra help with a hand. Babies quickly learn to be carried this way and to respond to a light touch of mommy's hand on the back of their neck or shoulders, which seems to tell them that she's moving. After they are three or four weeks old, babies may sometimes ride on mommy's back.\n\nIn the weeks after the baby first leaves mommy, if it's on the ground and she moves away, it usually follows; and even though it can barely crawl it still tries to follow.\n\nThese early tries to follow are often helped by the mommy, who moves away only slowly and hesitantly, often looking back at the baby, or even pulling at it to make it come.\n\nIf mommy moves too fast or leaves suddenly, the baby makes a sound and the mommy responds by hugging it to her. Sometimes when it's away from its mommy, it may make a short, high squeaking sound, and this too makes mommy come quickly to pick it up. A baby that loses its mommy makes very long calls, and this may make another female come to pick it up. If something scary happens when the baby is away from its mommy, they both run to each other; the baby clings to her and takes the nipple. This behaviour continues for some years.\n\nThough after they are two and a half or three years old, young ones usually move away from their mommies, there is evidence that the bond may still last and play a big part in how they relate to others when they are grown up. In a half-wild group that has been watched for many years, and where we know the family story of the animals, it is clear that in each small group there are stable smaller groups. These are made up of several big animals of both boys and girls, and a number of young ones and babies all of which stay close to one another. All the members of such a small group may be the children and grandchildren of one old female.\n\n_Behavior of Baboons_\n\nThe baboon, which is about twice the size of a monkey, has been watched in its home in several places in AF country, where it is very common in the bottom half. Some groups live in forest ground but many live in open grassland. In either case they spend most of their day on the ground, going to trees or cliffs for sleeping and for hiding from animals that eat them. Like monkeys they live in stable groups, with adults of both boys and girls, young ones, and babies. Groups are different in size from about a dozen to over a hundred. Each group stays to a limited area of ground, though areas of nearby groups overlap. The groups are friendly with each other.\n\nThe growing rate of young baboons is a little slower than that of monkeys. They become big at about four years and the female first has a baby at about six years. The male, however, who grows to be far bigger than the female, is not fully grown until nine or ten years.\n\nA baby baboon stays close to its mother throughout its first year of life and, with some breaks, during its second and third years also. After that the growing of boys and girls is different.\n\nAlmost all of its first month of life a baby baboon spends holding on to its mother, just like the monkey. After about five weeks of age the baby leaves its mother from time to time, and it is at this age too that it begins to ride on mother's back. By about four months of age its trips from mother are more often and it may move as far as twenty yards from her. This is also the age when riding mother like a horse becomes popular, and playing with others begins. From six months onwards playing with others increases and takes up a lot of the young baboon's time and energy. Still, until about twelve months it stays fairly close to mother and always sleeps with her. It rides her less and follows more often on foot.\n\nThe second year of a young baboon's life is spent mostly with others and sees times of big fights with its mother. As long as she is giving milk a female baboon does not go through her normal cycles; but when the baby is about one year old and milk is stopping, cycles and mating are started again. At these times the mother pushes her baby's tries either to take the nipple or to ride on her back, and is pushing away even at night-time. When babies are pushed away, David says, 'they seem to want to be in her arms more, to hold her in its mouth, and to go back to the sleeping trees with her'. When she is not as big anymore, a mother 'often takes the baby back'. Even when they are pushed away, if the baby or mother is scared, they look for each other; and, when her baby is in trouble with friends or with big boys, mother tries to keep it safe.\n\nAt the end of its second year, a baby's mother is likely to have a new baby but the older child continues to be near her and often sleeps with her at night. When scared, a two-year-old often still runs to its mother but, if a big boy it knows is closer, it may run to him.\n\nBy the time they are four years old, girls often join big girls and act like adults. Boys take another four or five years to grow up and during this time they start to be interested in other groups; and by the time they are fully grown most boys have moved to another group and don't see their mother anymore. A girl, by contrast, stays close to her mother all her life, and in some cases stays close to her sisters too.\n\n_Behaving with Love in Chimps_\n\nChimps have been seen in the forest areas and high lands of CE place, which is where they live; and they have been watched a lot in labs. Even though they are good at moving in trees and sleep in trees, when they go more than fifty steps they usually walk on the ground; and they always run from a stranger on the ground. Unlike most other animals studied, chimps do not stay close together in stable groups. Instead, the ones that are thought to be a single group of from sixty to eighty animals split into changing groups. Each small group can have animals of any age, boy or girl, or number; but two kinds of small group are often seen, one a group of several boys together and the other a group of several girls with babies.\n\nChimps grow up slower than monkeys or baboons. Watching in TA place by Patrick (in 1978) show that girl chimps become big girls at about nine years and first have babies two or three years later. Boys also become big at about nine, but take several more years to fully grow. Although animals are usually found with others, friends are always changing so the only stable group is that of a mother with her baby and older children. Grace (in 1975) says that in most cases where we know, close relationships between a mother and her children, and also between siblings, stay throughout life.\n\nLike all other baby animals, the baby chimp spends all its baby time close to its mother. In the first four months, a baby animal sticks to its mom and rarely leaves her side. If it tries to go too far, she pulls it back. If she sees a danger coming, she holds it tighter.\n\nFrom six to eighteen months old, the baby spends more time on its mom's back than on her belly. It starts to spend more time not attached to mom. By the end of this time, it can be away from mom for about a quarter of the day, usually playing with friends its own age. But it's never out of mom's sight. If it's playing and mom wants to go somewhere, she lets it know. The baby comes right away and gets ready to go with her.\n\nThe next eighteen months, up to three years old, the young one is more active away from mom and spends a lot of time playing with friends. It can be away from mom for about 75 to 90 percent of the day. But it still rides on her back and sleeps with her.\n\nBetween four and seven years old, the young ones eat and sleep on their own and spend a lot of time playing with friends. But they still spend time with mom and go places with her. For example, in a study at the GO place, Patrick (1978) saw that four young females who still had their moms spent a lot of time with them. Only after they became adults did they start spending less time with mom and more time with adult males. Young males also spent a lot of time with mom, even after they became adults. The young ones always decide when to leave and come back to mom. No one has seen a mom push away her kid.\n\n_Gorillas_\n\nGorillas, like chimpanzees, live in the rain forests and woods of CE place. They've also been studied a lot recently. Though animals often sleep in trees and the young play in them, gorillas spend most of their time on the ground. Besides a few adult males, they live in groups with both males and females of all ages. The number of gorillas in a group can be from half a dozen to nearly thirty. The groups change over time, more so in some than in others. Boys and girls may leave their first group when they grow up. When gorilla groups meet, it's not always friendly: sometimes, single gorillas, or gorillas from other groups, attack female gorillas and hurt their babies. Chimpanzee groups also don't get along well.\n\nWe know from science that gorillas and chimpanzees are like our close family.\n\nGorillas grow up at about the same speed as chimpanzees. Baby gorillas and their moms act very much like baby chimpanzees and their moms.\n\nIn the first few months, a baby gorilla can't hold on to its mom very well and she has to hold it. By three months old, it can hold on well and may start to ride on her back. Between three to six months old, the baby starts to walk a little bit by itself while mom watches. But if it goes too far, mom pulls it back. Until about eight months old, the baby doesn't know when mom is about to leave and she has to pick it up. After that, it knows when mom is about to move and quickly comes back to her.\n\nWhen they are one year old, the babies may walk around the group and may be out of sight of mom for a little bit. They also start to sit next to mom instead of on her lap. When they are one and a half years old, moms often don't want to carry them anymore.\n\nA common sight was a mom walking slowly with her baby following her. But if there is danger or they have to move quickly, all babies up to nearly three years old run to their moms and climb up.\n\nYoung gorillas from three to seven years old act a lot like young chimpanzees. They don't get carried anymore, and they eat and sleep on their own. They spend a lot of time with other young gorillas. But they still have a relationship with their mom; even if mom has another baby, they still pay attention to each other. As they get older and more independent, they spend less time with mom and more time with other grown-up gorillas.\n\n_Young Monkeys and Apes and Other Animals in their Groups_\n\nDuring the baby period (up to one year for some monkeys, and up to three years for big apes) the baby spends little time with grown-ups other than its mom. When a baby animal is not with its mother, it might be playing with other little ones. Sometimes, grown-up females without their own babies want to take care of a baby, and sometimes they can. In most types of animals, the real mom doesn't like this and gets her baby back quickly. But, the monkey from IN country lets other grown-up females hold her baby; and a man in the late 20th century described how two baby gorillas were seen to be close with females who were not their moms: one of six months would spend up to an hour or more with the 'aunt', and another over a period of six months during its second year 'spent most of its time... with a female and small baby, returning to its mom only sometimes during the day and probably at night'.\n\nIn most types of animals, grown-up males are interested in moms with babies and let moms carrying young stay close to them and might stay behind specially to go with them. Usually, though, grown-up males never or only rarely carry young themselves. But, the monkey from JA country (a relative of the rhesus) is different. In a few groups of that type of monkey, grown-up males of high rank commonly 'adopt' a one-year-old baby after the mom has had a new baby. For a limited time their behavior 'is quite like the behavior of a mom toward her baby, except for the lack of feeding' (Itani, 1963). This dad-like behavior is not shown by the IN country rhesus male, who is either uninterested in young or doesn't like them.\n\nIn many types of animals, as the young get older, they spend more time with grown-up males, but the age at which this happens seems to change a lot. Among savannah baboons a mom with a young baby usually spends time with one (or sometimes two) particular male(s). Her baby is likely to become close to this male and the relationship often continues after its mom has had another baby (Altmann, 1980). So it's not surprising that as early as their second year young baboons when scared start to run to a grown-up male rather than to mom. Baby gorillas like the big male and when the group rests often sit by or play near him. Sometimes they climb on to him or even get a ride. As long as the play is not too wild the male is very patient. Young gorillas also sometimes want to be with a grown-up male and will leave the group to follow him. These friendly relationships are not reported for chimpanzees; when they become teenagers, however, chimpanzees of both sexes often spend time with big males. Since in all these types of animals mating within a group is not picky, people watching have so far thought that there is no way for the animals to know which male is the dad of which baby. But new learning shows that, in at least some animals, dads spend more time with some babies than with others, and usually these babies are the children of moms with whom the dad spent time when the baby was most likely to be made (Benjamin and others, 1982; Alice, 1980).\n\n_How Baby and Mom Connect_\n\nFrom what has been said it is clear that during the first months of being a baby moms of all these kinds of animals play a big part in making sure that their babies stay close to them. If the baby can't hold on well, the mom helps it. If it goes too far she pulls it back. When a big bird flies overhead or a person comes too close she hugs it to her. So even if the baby wanted to go far it is never allowed to do so.\n\nBut all the things we know show that the baby does not want to go far. This is shown when a baby is raised away from its mom, as babies of many different kinds of monkey and ape have been. In a few cases where a baby has been raised in a person's home, we have a story about it. Good examples are those by Rachel (1965) of a young monkey, by Benjamin (1963) of a young patas monkey (also a ground-living kind, and with a growing rate similar to that of a baboon), by Kevin and Katherine (1933) and by Henry (1951) of young chimpanzees, and by Matthew (1955) of a young gorilla. Of the cases in which a baby has been raised with a toy mom the most famous reports are those of Henry and his friends (Henry, 1961; Henry and Henry, 1965).\n\nAll those brave people who have acted as a new parent to a young animal tell about how strong and long the baby holds on. Rachel writes of the little monkey she looked after (from the fifth to the eleventh week of age): 'when scared by a loud noise or a quick move he ran to me and held very hard to my leg'. After she had had the baby ten days: 'he did not let me out of his sight, and did not want a toy or apron, but held on the more tightly'. Of the little patas monkey that Benjamin cared for from a few days old he writes that from the first 'he held any thing put in his hand and cried out if it was taken away' and that 'his love quickly grew closer and closer until in the end it was almost too strong to break'. Henry, telling about Victoria, the girl chimpanzee she raised from three days old, tells how, at four months old when Victoria was walking well, 'from the time she left her bed until she was put to bed at night, with rest for only an hour's nap, she held to me like a baby'. All the stories are similar.\n\n_Little Monkey and Mom_\n\nBeing close to someone is important. While we know baby monkeys of all kinds like to hold onto things very tightly, we don't know when they start to know one monkey from another, and start to like one monkey best.\n\nHenry thinks that a baby monkey 'learns to like a specific mom ( _the_ mom)' during the first week or two of life. Nathan agrees with this: he says that, within a few days of being born, a baby monkey likes its mom more than other monkeys. For example, at the end of its first week it may leave mom briefly and crawl towards another female; but it soon turns around and moves towards mom. A baby monkey knowing a particular monkey so soon is less surprising now that we know monkeys can see patterns when they are born.\n\nWhat human parents say about this is also interesting.\n\nBenjamin's little monkey started to know people in the house very soon after it arrived, when it was between five and fourteen days old. This was shown only three days after it came when the monkey, which had been looked after mainly by Miss Bella, ran after her to the door, screaming, when left with Dr Benjamin, and stopped crying when she came back and picked it up.\n\nIn the next days, the monkey liked me more than my daughter, and it liked me so much that I had to carry him on my shoulder wherever I went... until he was 3 months old he could be very troublesome if left with another family member.\n\nEven when the monkey was five months old and spent a lot of time with other people and monkeys, it still liked Dr Benjamin best, especially when it was upset; and it still liked him best four months later (when it was nine months old) even though Dr Benjamin had been away the whole time.\n\nRachel's baby baboon was about five weeks old when she became its mom. In the first week, the little baboon could tell who it knew from who it didn't and could know who took care of it. At first, if it was not hungry, it was happy to stay alone with its toy and its caregiver's apron. After ten days, however, 'he wouldn't let me out of his sight.... If he saw me move or even looked at me he would drop the toy and run to me.'\n\nSo, these stories show that in some kinds of old monkeys, being close to someone comes, within a week or so, to be directed especially towards a certain liked individual, and once it is so directed the liking is very strong and stays.\n\nChimpanzee babies seem to be slower to show they like their caregiver a lot. But when they do, they like their caregiver just as much as monkey babies do. For example, a man named Henry tells a story about a baby chimpanzee named Victoria. Victoria was about three months old when she started to show she cared who was with her. When she was a little older than four months, she went to a party. At the party, she explored and also stayed close to her caregiver. When she accidentally grabbed a lady's dress, she cried and quickly climbed up her caregiver.\n\n_Changes in Love Behaviour_\n\nWhen baby monkeys in the wild get scared, they quickly run to their mother. If they're already close, they hold on tighter. This happens every time they're scared. It helps us understand why it happens and why it's important.\n\nSometimes, baby monkeys show they want to stay close, or they show it more intensely, when they are raised by people. For example, Rowell says that when her baby baboon was hungry, he would try to stay close and cry a lot if left alone. Both Rowell and another person, Benjamin, say that when the baby monkey gets a little older and starts to explore, any sign that the caregiver is leaving makes the baby monkey quickly cling. Being away for a short time also has the same effect. Benjamin says that when his baby monkey was let out of a cage after being left for a few hours with other monkeys,\n\nhe would cling to me and refuse to leave me out of sight for the rest of the day. At night when he was asleep, he would wake up with small cries and cling to me, looking very scared when I tried to let him go.\n\n_The Lessening of Love Behaviour_\n\nWhen talking about young monkeys in the wild, they start to spend less time with their mother and more time with other monkeys as they get older. This is usually because of what they want to do. The mother monkey sometimes helps make this change happen. How much the mother helps seems to change a lot depending on the type of monkey. A baboon mother pushes her baby away a lot after it is ten months old, especially if she is going to have another baby. The mother of a different kind of monkey also does some pushing away. But mother chimpanzees and gorillas don't seem to do it very much.\n\nFrom what we can tell, even if a mommy is always there, after some time, the child's need to stay close gets less strong and happens less often. There might be many reasons for this. One could be that the way the child shows this need changes. Another could be that the child gets more curious and wants to explore more, which some people think is very important.\n\nOne person talked about how a baby monkey he had didn't want to stay close as much over time. He said that from the very first days, the monkey liked to look at hands and faces. It always liked to look at things that don't move, and this got more and more. By the end of its second month living with him, it liked to climb on the furniture a lot. When it was almost four months old, it had so much fun with a group of students that it didn't want to come when called; this happened more and more. He thinks that the young monkey's fun in playing and exploring 'got in the way of staying close and took over it during his playtime'.\n\nHow quickly the need to stay close gets less can be affected by many things. One is how often scary things happen: everyone agrees that when they get scared, even older children want to get close to their mom right away. Another is how often they are made to be away at too young an age. The person describes how his little monkey would cling onto him after he had been made to punish it, for example by locking it out of the house or putting it in a cage. 'Every time I tried... it made the monkey's growth worse. He became more clinging, more naughty and more difficult.'\n\nEven though the need to stay close to the mother naturally gets less in monkeys and apes, it doesn't completely go away. But, we don't know enough from watching them in the wild to be sure about what it means when they grow up, and the same is true for animals raised in captivity.\n\nAll the monkeys and apes raised by humans that these reports talk about have been put in zoos or in science places while still young. Usually, these animals get along well with their own kind, but they still like humans a lot more than animals raised in the wild. Some of them even get romantic feelings for humans. So, who the baby animal wants to stay close to can have long-term effects.\n\nHow humans want to stay close\n\n_Differences from and similarities to that seen in monkeys and apes_\n\nAt first, it might seem like there is a big difference between how humans want to stay close and how monkeys and apes do. When a baby animal is born, it sticks to its mom right away. But human babies take a little bit more time to know their moms. Even though this is true, we shouldn't think it's a big deal.\n\nWe know that baby gorillas, a big kind of monkey, can't hold themselves up when they're born. For a few months, their mom holds them. Also, in simple human societies, moms carry their babies on their backs instead of putting them in beds or strollers. So, baby gorillas and humans are not that different. From the smallest monkeys to humans, there's a pattern. In the less advanced monkeys, like lemur and marmoset, the baby has to hold onto its mom all the time. It gets no help from its mom. In the more advanced monkeys, like baboon and rhesus, the baby has to hold on most of the time, but its mom helps a little bit in the early days. In the most advanced, gorilla and humans, the baby continues to hold on but can't hold on for long by itself. So, for some months the mom has to keep the baby close by her own actions. This is true in all human societies, except the ones that are more developed, especially in the WE places, where babies are often not with their mom for many hours a day and often during the night too.\n\nThis change in who takes the initiative to keep contact has a big result. A baby rhesus monkey holds on strongly before it learns to tell its mom from other monkeys. But a human baby can tell his mom from other people before he can hold onto her or move towards her. This fact makes it a bit hard to decide how to judge when a human baby starts to show attachment behavior.\n\n_Growth of Attachment Behavior during the First Year_\n\nWe have good proof that in a family setting most babies of about three months are already responding differently to mom compared with other people. When he sees his mom a baby of this age will smile and make sounds more readily and follow her with his eyes for longer than he does when he sees anyone else. So, the baby can tell the difference. But we can't say that there is attachment behavior until there is proof that the baby not only knows his mom but also tends to behave in a way that keeps him close to her.\n\nWe see this behavior most clearly when mom leaves the room and the baby cries, or cries and also tries to follow her. Alice (a researcher) tells us that, in one group of African babies, crying and attempts to follow happened in one baby as early as fifteen and seventeen weeks respectively and that both kinds of behavior were common at six months of age. Almost all of these little ones tried to follow their mom as soon as they could crawl.\n\nIn this look, Alice was watching little ones of a tribe in UG country. She would visit their moms for a bit in the afternoon when the moms were usually resting after work and often having friends over. Any little one awake at this time either is held, sat in the lap, or is free to crawl around. Since a lot of grown-ups were always around, different responses and love for mom were easily seen. Visits to twenty-five moms with twenty-seven little ones were made every two weeks for about seven months. By the end of the look, the two youngest little ones were still only six months old but most of them were between ten and fifteen months; all but four were showing love for mom.\n\nAlice's findings make it clear that in almost all of the tribe's children, love for mom is clearly there by six months old, and is shown not only by the child's crying when mom leaves the room but also by his happy greeting for her when she comes back with smiles, lifting of the arms, and happy noises. The crying was more likely to happen when the child was left alone or with strangers, but at this age it did not happen every time. During the next three months, however, while the little one got older from six to nine months old, all these things were shown more often and with more energy 'as though the love for mom was getting stronger and stronger'. Children this age followed mom when she left the room; after she had been gone they first greeted her and then crawled as quickly as possible to her.\n\nAll these ways of behaving continued during the last part of the first year and throughout the second year of life. By nine months children could follow mom more easily when she left the room and after that their crying on these occasions lessened. Clinging to mom, too, became especially clear after the age of nine months, especially when a child was scared, e.g. by a stranger's presence.\n\nEven though love for mom was shown by these children also towards other familiar adults, towards mom it was nearly always shown earlier, more strongly, and more consistently. Between the ages of six and nine months any child whose dad came home regularly would greet him happily when he showed up; but the actual following of a familiar adult (other than mom) who left was not seen until after the age of nine months. From then on if his mom was not there a child tended to follow any familiar adult he happened to be with.\n\nWhile twenty-three of the twenty-seven tribe's children watched by Alice showed clear love for mom, in four little ones no love for mom of any kind had been seen when watching ended. The ages of these four children were then eight and a half months (twins), eleven months, and twelve months. Possible reasons for their slower growth are talked about in the next part.\n\nThe age when children start to show love and attachment in GA place, as seen by Alice, is not much different from the age when Sophia and Ethan saw it in SC children. They watched sixty babies from when they were born until they were one year old. Every four weeks, they talked to the parents. They looked at how the babies reacted when their moms left; seven different situations, like being alone in a room or left in bed at night, were looked at, and how upset the baby got was recorded. They did not watch the babies a lot and did not look at how the babies said hello.\n\nIn the SC place, one-third of the babies showed love and attachment by six months old and three-quarters by nine months. Like in GA place, a few babies were slow to show it: for two babies, it was still not seen when the babies were one year old.\n\nIf we just look at what Sophia and Ethan found, it seems like SC children are a little slower to show love and attachment than GA children. This could be true and would make sense because GA children are known to be able to move earlier. Another idea is that the differences are because of the different ways they looked for love and attachment and how they watched the children. Because Alice was there and watching the babies herself, she may have seen the first signs of love and attachment, while Sophia and Ethan, who were relying on what the mothers said, may not have. However that may be, both groups agree on a lot of things. These include how there is a big range in the age when children first show love and attachment\u2014from before four months to after twelve months. This big difference between children should always be remembered; why it happens is talked about in Chapter 15.\n\nThere is also agreement on how often children show love and attachment to people other than their moms. Sophia and Ethan found that, in the month after the children first showed love and attachment, one-quarter of them were showing it to other family members, and by the time they were eighteen months old all but a few children were showing it to at least one other person and often to several others. Dad was the most common other person. Next were older children, 'not just much older children, who might sometimes do the mom's usual care activities, but also preschool children'. Sophia and Ethan did not find any evidence that love and attachment to mom was less strong when the child also showed love and attachment to other people; in fact, in the early months of attachment the more people a child showed love and attachment to, the stronger his love and attachment to mom was likely to be.\n\nBoth groups also found that there is a lot of difference in how quickly children develop and that in any one child, how strong and regular love and attachment are can change a lot from day to day or hour to hour. The things that cause these short-term changes are of two kinds, things to do with the child and things to do with the environment. Among the things that make children cry and follow their parents are hunger, tiredness, sickness, and sadness; this was noted by two people called Adam and Samuel. They also noted that children act more attached when they are scared. Adam had a good chance to see this because he looked different and the children were more likely to be scared of him. At first, no children showed fear, but after a certain time, most of them did: 'Children we met for the first time seemed very scared of me.... They held on to me because they were scared.' Samuel also noticed that children acted more attached after their mother had been away.\n\nAll these things that make human babies act more attached in the short term are the same as those that make monkey and ape babies act more attached.\n\nEven though there is a lot of evidence to show that the care a baby gets from his mother plays a big part in how his attachment behaviour develops, we must not forget that the baby himself can start interactions and shape how they go. Both Adam and Samuel, along with other observers, have noted that the baby plays a very active role.\n\nReflecting on his observations, Adam writes:\n\nOne thing about attachment behaviour that stood out to me was how much the baby himself starts interactions. From at least two months of age onwards, and more so through the first year of life, these babies were not just passive recipients but active in seeking interaction.\n\nSamuel writes similarly about his observations:\n\nChildren often seem to make their parents act by the strength of their demands, as many mothers we talked to said they had to respond more than they wanted to...\n\nApart from crying, which is hard to ignore, a baby often calls out and, when he is attended to, looks at and smiles at his mother or other companion. Later, he greets her, goes towards her, and tries to get her attention in many cute ways. Not only does he make his companions respond, but 'he keeps their responses going and shapes them by encouraging some and not others' (Ryan, 1966). The pattern of interaction that slowly develops between a baby and his mother can only be understood as a result of what each contributes, and especially how each influences the other's behaviour. This idea is explored more in Chapter 16.\n\n_How Attachment Behaviour in People Develops Over Time_\n\nWhile we have a good idea of how attachment behaviour grows during the first year of life, we do not know as much about how it develops in the following years. Most kids show a strong connection to their parents during their second and third year. This is not less than how they feel at the end of their first year. But as they grow, they start to understand more about the world. This changes how they show their attachment.\n\nOne change is that a child starts to know when his mom is about to leave. In his first year, a baby mostly cries when his mom leaves him. But later, a child who is busy with something else begins to notice when his mom is gone. After this, he always wants to know where his mom is: he spends a lot of time watching her or, if he can't see her, listening for her. Around his first birthday, he starts to know when his mom is about to leave and begins to cry before she goes. Many parents of two-year-olds try to hide when they are leaving to avoid crying.\n\nMost children show a strong connection to their parents until almost the end of their third year. Then, something changes. This is seen a lot by teachers at playschool. Most kids under three years old are upset when their mom leaves them at playschool. Even if they stop crying quickly, they often want a lot of attention from the teacher. This is very different from how they act if their mom stays with them. But after their third birthday, they usually handle their mom leaving better and play with other kids. For many kids, this change happens very suddenly. This suggests that they grow up a bit at this age.\n\nAnother big change is that after their third birthday, most kids start to feel safe with other people they trust, like a family member or a teacher. But this feeling of safety has some conditions. First, these people must be familiar to the child, and they should have met them while their mom was with them. Second, the child must be healthy and not scared. Third, the child needs to know where his mom is and be sure that he can see her again soon. If these conditions are not met, the child is likely to become or stay very attached to his mom, or show other changes in behavior.\n\nThe growing confidence with age is shown well in a story told by Murphy and her friends (1962). They talked about how children between two and a half and five and a half years old react to being asked to come play. During a first visit to a kid's family, the helpers made a plan to visit again in a few days to take the kid by car to a fun place. Even though the kids were told to go on their own, if the kid didn't want to or the mom wanted to come, it was okay. The moms knew the helpers, but the kids didn't, except for seeing them during the first visit.\n\nWhen the helpers came to take the kids to the fun place, most of the little ones didn't want to go unless mom came too. This happened more with the younger kids. Most of the four- and five-year-olds listened to mom and were happy to go alone with the helpers, but only a few of the two- and three-year-olds did. Most of the younger kids not only wanted mom to come, but also wanted to stay close to her by sitting next to her, holding her hand, or pulling her along. But with mom there, they felt better and more confident during later visits. Most of the older kids went happily on their own to the first visit and soon started to enjoy the toys and games. None of the kids older than four and a half years showed the sticking close to mom behavior like the younger kids. To show these differences, a helper named Matthew shared some stories about the kids' behaviors.\n\nThe kids Matthew talked about in this study were all from families where the parents were good at their jobs and mostly from old AM country families. Their parents were usually strict. They weren't spoiled, and there's no reason to think they were different than other kids.\n\nKids in EN country are the same. The behaviors of a group of 700 four-year-olds in a place in EN country are well recorded by two helpers named Nora and Nathan. To a question whether their four-year-old 'ever comes sticking close wanting to be babied a bit', the moms of 16 per cent answered 'often' and of 47 per cent 'sometimes'. Even though the moms of the rest answered 'never', in some cases it seemed like they were just hoping that was true. Common reasons for a kid who didn't usually stick close to show it were being sick or being jealous of a younger brother or sister. Almost all the moms said they listened to their kid's needs, but a quarter of them said they only did it reluctantly. In this, Nora and Nathan talked about a common theme they heard from moms, which was the power that a kid has to get what they want. This is a truth, the NE family says, 'that most moms and dads learn, but books about taking care of children don't tell them often'.\n\nSo, even though most children after they turn three don't show they need their parents as much as before, it is still a big part of how they act. Even though it becomes less, the way they need their parents is not very different from when they were four years old and continues while they are in early school years. When out walking, five and six-year-old children, and even older, sometimes like to hold their parent's hand, and get upset if the parent says no. When playing with others, if something goes wrong, they go back to their mom or dad, or someone like their mom or dad. If they get really scared, they want to be with their parent right away. So, during the early years of a normal child, needing their parent is a big part of their life.\n\nDuring the teenage years, a child's need for his parents changes. Other grown-ups may become as important or more important than the parents, and liking other kids their age begins to change the picture. Because of this, people become even more different from each other. Some teenagers stop being close to their parents; some stay very close and can't or won't show they need other people; in the middle are most teenagers who still need their parents but also need other people a lot. For most people, the bond to parents continues into grown-up life and affects how they act in many ways. In many places, the bond of a daughter to her mom is more obvious than that of a son to his mom. As YO and WI (1957) have shown, even in a western city society the bond between grown-up daughter and mom plays a big part in social life.\n\nLastly, in old age, when needing others can no longer be directed towards older people, or even the same age people, it may come instead to be directed towards younger people.\n\nDuring the teenage years and grown-up life, needing others is often directed not only towards people outside the family but also towards groups and institutions other than the family. A school or work group, a religious group or a political group can become a less important attachment-'figure', and for some people a more important attachment-'figure'. In these cases, it seems likely, the development of attachment to a group is helped, at least in the beginning, by attachment to a person who is important in that group. So, for many a citizen needing his state is a result of and at first depends on his attachment to its king or president.\n\nThat needing others in grown-up life is a simple continuation of needing others in childhood is shown by the things that make an adult's need for others show up more easily. In sickness and bad times, adults often become demanding of others; in conditions of sudden danger or disaster a person will almost certainly seek to be close to another known and trusted person. In such circumstances an increase of needing others is recognized by all as natural. Saying that showing love and wanting to be close to others is only for babies is wrong. People need to feel loved and close to others from the time they are babies until they are very old. \n\n_How We Show Love_\n\nIn a past talk (Bowlby, 1958), five ways of showing love were listed. Two of them, crying and smiling, make the mother come to the baby and stay close. Two others, following and holding tight, make the baby come to the mother and stay close. The fifth way, sucking, is harder to understand and needs more study. A sixth way, calling, is also important: after four months, a baby will call his mother with short sounds and later, by saying her name.\n\nWe will talk more about these ways of showing love later.\n\n_Using Mother as a Safe Place to Explore_\n\nTo describe how babies start to show love during the first year, we look at two things: crying and following when mother leaves, and greeting and coming close when mother returns. Other things we look at are smiling more at mother, usually around the fourth month, and moving to mother and holding tight when the child is scared. Another thing is how a child acts differently when his mother is there and when she is not.\n\nIn her study of GA children, Ainsworth (1967) saw that, soon after a child can crawl, he does not always stay close to his mother. Instead, he goes on little trips away from her, looking at other things and people and, if allowed, he may even go out of her sight. From time to time, though, he comes back to her, as if to make sure she is still there. But if the child is scared or hurt, or if the mother moves away, he comes back to her as quickly as he can, sometimes showing signs of being upset, or else crying. The youngest GA child in whom Ainsworth saw this behavior was twenty-eight weeks old. After eight months, most of them did this.\n\nFrom this age on, a child acts very differently when his mother is there compared with when she is not, especially if the child is in a strange place or with a strange person. With mother there, most children are clearly more brave and ready to explore; without her, they are much more scared and often become very upset. Experiments showing these reactions in children of about twelve months old are reported by Ainsworth and Wittig (1969) and by Rheingold (1969). In each of these learnings, what we find is very clear and amazing. We talk more about this in Chapter 16.\n\n_Feeling_\n\nNo way of acting comes with stronger feelings than when you love someone. The people who we feel this for are loved and their coming is met with happiness.\n\nWhen a child is near a person they love a lot, or they can get to them easily, they feel safe. If they think they might lose this person, they feel scared, and if they really lose them, they feel sad; both these things can also make them angry. We talk more about all these things in the second and third books of this work.\n\nThis way of talking comes from a very old idea where the thing that you want is seen as 'the thing that you can get what you want with or through' (a smart man said this in the early 20th century).\n\nIn Chapter 2 we explained that, even though this book usually talks about mothers and not people who are like mothers, we mean the person who takes care of the child and who the child loves, not just the real mother.\n\nIn this way of talking, 'first' and 'second' mean whether the way of acting comes on its own or if it comes from learning from a more simple system; this is how we will use these words. The words don't talk about when in life the way of acting comes or the first and second ways of thinking that another smart man talked about.\n\nFor ways of acting, see the work of some smart people (1965) on monkeys in NO country; other smart people (1963 and 1965) on the partly wild group on a small island off PR country; more smart people (1964, 1967) on monkeys living in small groups (one adult male, three or four adult females and children); and a number of things written by more smart people (e.g. a smart man, 1961; a smart man and a smart woman, 1965) on what happens when you bring up young monkeys in very strange ways.\n\nIt seems that brothers (half-brothers) like to stay close to each other and sisters (half-sisters) also like to stay close together. Since when they grow up brothers tend to leave their mother whereas sisters do not, a group of family of many ages usually has more females than males.\n\nSee the two things written together by two smart men in _Monkey Behavior_ (ed. a smart man, 1965) and the thing written by a smart man (1963) on mother\u2013baby relations in free monkeys. For newer work see a smart woman and others (1977) and the book by a smart woman (1980) on mothers and babies.\n\n There are books about wild monkeys by Grace (1965, 1975), Ryan and Rachel (1965), and Penelope (1978). You can read about how they behave when they are kept by people in books by Yosef _Monkeys: A Place Where We Keep Them_ (1943) and other books by Yosef, and also by Matthew (1965b).\n\nThere are also books about wild big monkeys, see the books by Samuel (1963, 1965) and recent studies by Fiona (1979) and Hannah (1979).\n\nThe way female monkeys who are not mothers behave is in a paper by Henry (1965a). The real mothers of the baby monkeys don't let other monkeys take their baby.\n\nYosef says that baby monkeys take some months to know each other. For example, two baby monkeys who were twins didn't know each other until they were five months old (Thomas and Yosef, 1935).\n\nA group of GA children started to crawl when they were twenty-five weeks old. This is different from white AM country children who start to crawl at seven and a half months old (George, 1940). In many ways, GA children do things faster than white children (Gabriel, 1956).\n\nThere was another baby who was only three and a half months old at the end of the study, so she was not included in this summary.\n\nSchaffer and Emma found that babies cried a lot when their mother left them. They think that mothers might not have told them about the first few times this happened.\n\nSchaffer and Emma say that they don't know why sometimes the babies cried more and sometimes they cried less. They think that if they had been there more often, they might have noticed things that the mothers didn't tell them.\n\nMurphy doesn't give exact numbers.\n\nR. S. Weiss has done many studies of how adults feel about each other. To read about what he found, see Weiss (1982).\n\nChapter 12\n\nAbout Attachment Behaviour\n\nYou know\u2014I have told you often,\n\nThat Children should not\n\nLeave their Nurses in a Crowd;\n\nNow this was Jack's problem,\n\nHe ran away when he could,\n\nAnd on this bad day\n\nHe ran away!\n\nHe had just started when\u2014Bang!\n\nA lion jumped out,\n\nAnd began to eat\n\nThe Boy, starting at his feet.\n\n* * *\n\nHis Father, who was calm,\n\nTold all the children to pay attention\n\nJames didn't have a good ending,\n\nAlways stay with the nurse\n\nBecause you might find something worse.\n\n'Jim'\u2014by a famous writer\n\nTalking about why we like to be with others\n\nIn the last part, we talked about how five types of monkeys and people act as they grow up. Now, we will try to understand why they act like this and what makes them act like this.\n\nA lot of people think that we like to be with others because they give us food. As Dollard and Miller said: '... maybe when we eat, we can learn to like being with others. This can make us want to be with others.' Or, as Freud says: 'The baby wants to see its mom because it knows from experience that she gives it everything it needs right away' (1926); and later, 'love starts from wanting to be fed' (1940).\n\nThe first thing to know about this idea is that it comes from a guess, not from watching or doing experiments. Hull thought that we only have a few basic needs\u2014like food, drink, warmth, and love\u2014and that everything else we do comes from learning. Freud thought the same. Both ideas were then made more detailed because they thought their guess was right and didn't talk about it more. Because there was no other idea, this idea became almost like a truth that everyone knows.\n\nThis idea was first questioned by Lorenz's work on how baby ducks and geese act. Even though he published his work in 1935, most people didn't know about it until 1950, and it only really changed how people think about 10 or 20 years later. What he showed was that baby ducks and geese can start to follow others without getting food or any other reward. In the hours after they are born, these babies tend to follow anything that moves, like a mother bird, a person, a balloon, or a box; once they have followed something, they like that thing more than others and after a while will only follow that thing. The process of learning what the thing they follow looks like is called imprinting.\n\nAfter Lorenz's experiments were done again and his findings were checked, it was natural to think about whether mammals and people act in the same way. There is now a lot of proof that it does so. Those who still like the idea of secondary drive must, therefore, show some strong proof if they want others to believe their idea in the future.\n\nFor animals other than people, strong proof that attachment behavior can grow and be directed towards an object that provides none of the traditional rewards of food, warmth, or fun is only for small animals, dogs, sheep, and monkeys (see review by Adam, 1966a).\n\nIn one set of experiments, Samuel (1963) shows that small animals isolated within four hours of birth follow a flat white wooden shape when it moves. Responses include not only following but a number of other social responses, e.g. sniffing, licking, and contact-seeking. In another experiment baby small animals stayed with mother for five days in complete darkness. They were then taken away from mother and exposed to the light and to the moving model. Again they responded to the model by following and other social responses. Since they had been raised in darkness there was no chance of visual generalization from mother, and, since following came before contact with the model, any effect of previous contact with mother could be excluded.\n\nEven though the experiments of Scott and his friends with puppies (reviewed by Scott, 1963) are a little less strict, the results are still impressive. The puppies, while totally isolated from man, stayed with their mother and brothers and sisters in the light until experiments began when they were two or three weeks old or older. The questions asked were whether a puppy who had neither seen a man nor been fed by one would follow one, and, if so, at what ages and in what conditions.\n\nIn one experiment, puppies were first exposed to a sitting and inactive man when they were at one of several different ages; the exposure was for ten minutes each day for a week. All the puppies first exposed to a man when they were either three weeks or five weeks of age immediately followed the experimenter and spent the whole ten minutes with him. Those first exposed at older ages were more often afraid and none of those first exposed at fourteen weeks followed. Thus in the weeks after they can first crawl about puppies will follow a human being despite his being inactive and their having had no chance whatever of associating food with him.\n\nIn another experiment one of Scott's friends (Frank) kept puppies in complete isolation after they had reached three weeks of age and arranged for them to be fed by mechanical means. For a short time each day thenceforward they were let out and their response to a walking man was observed. All of them followed him. One group of puppies not only received no sort of reward but were punished each time they attempted to follow 'so that their only experience with human contact was painful'. After several weeks the experimenter stopped the punishment. The little dogs stopped running away from him after a while. They even spent more time with him than with other little dogs who got lots of petting and kindness.\n\nThere were also tests with baby sheep that showed the same thing. From about six weeks old, a baby sheep was kept alone but could see and hear a working TV. The baby sheep liked being near the TV and when it was taken away from the TV, it looked for it and went to it when it found it. In other tests, baby sheep were kept where they could see, hear, and smell a dog; they couldn't touch each other because of a wire fence. After a while, the baby sheep started to see the dog as a friend, crying when they were separated, looking for it, and following it everywhere. So, baby sheep can make friends with just seeing and hearing something, without needing to touch it.\n\nLike little dogs, baby sheep will make friends even if their friend is mean to them. When a baby sheep and a dog are kept together in a cage without anything stopping them from moving, the dog might bite and hurt the baby sheep. Even so, when they are separated, the baby sheep will immediately look for its dog friend and go to it. None of these things match with the idea of a secondary drive theory.\n\nThere were also tests with monkeys that do not support the secondary drive type of theory. In these tests, baby monkeys were taken away from their mothers at birth and given fake mothers made of wire or soft cloth. They were fed from a bottle that could be put in either fake mother. This let the testers see the effects of food and of something comfortable to hold on to. All the tests showed that being comfortable led to the babies making friends, but food did not.\n\nIn one test, eight baby monkeys were raised with the choice of a cloth fake mother and a wire fake mother. Four babies were fed from the cloth fake mother and four from the wire fake mother. The time the babies spent on each fake mother was measured. The results showed that, no matter which fake mother gave them food, the babies quickly spent most of their time on the cloth fake mother. While babies from both groups spent an average of fifteen hours a day holding on to the cloth fake mother, no babies from either group spent more than an hour or two out of the twenty-four with the wire fake mother. Some babies who got their food from the wire fake mother managed to lean over and drink from the bottle while still holding on to the cloth fake mother. The testers finished with:\n\nThese facts show that feeling safe and comfy is very important for a baby to start liking its pretend mommy [i.e. model] and that food doesn't seem to matter much. As the baby grows up and learns more, a baby fed by a wire mommy who gives milk doesn't start to like her more, like some might think. Instead, the baby likes its cloth mommy who doesn't give milk more and more. These findings are different from the thought that babies start to like their mommies because their mommies feed them.\n\nThere are more experiments done by Henry that support this, especially those where he compared babies who grew up with a cloth mommy who didn't feed them and babies who grew up with a wire mommy who did feed them. Two of these experiments looked at how a baby monkey behaves (i) when it is scared and (ii) when it is in a new place.\n\nWhen a baby monkey who grew up with a cloth mommy who doesn't feed gets scared, it quickly goes to the cloth mommy and holds on to her (just like a wild monkey would quickly go to its real mommy and hold on to her when scared). After doing this, the baby monkey becomes less scared and might even start to look at the thing that scared it. When a similar experiment is done with a baby who grew up with a wire mommy who gives milk, the baby behaves differently: it doesn't go to the mommy, and stays scared and doesn't look around.\n\nIn the second experiment, a baby monkey is put in a new room (6' cube) with lots of toys. As long as its cloth mommy is there, the baby monkey plays with the toys, going back to the cloth mommy from time to time. But without the cloth mommy, the babies\n\nwould run across the room and throw themselves face down, grabbing their heads and bodies and crying out loud.... The wire mommy being there didn't make them feel better than having no mommy at all. Tests on monkeys that from birth only had a wire mommy who gave milk showed that even these babies didn't like her and didn't feel better when she was there (Henry, 1961).\n\nIn both these experiments, the baby monkeys liked the cloth mommy who didn't feed them more than the wire mommy who did feed them.\n\nThis is the same as what Rowell found with the baby baboon she took care of. The baboon was fed from a bottle; it also had a dummy to suck and its caretaker to hold on to when it wanted to. In this situation, the bottle was only interesting when the baboon was hungry. At these times the baby would grab the bottle quickly. At all other times it liked the dummy or its foster-mommy more: 'the bottle, though sometimes put in the mouth, seemed no more interesting than any other thing of the same size' (Rowell, 1965).\n\nIn Henry's experiments, the only thing that food seems to do is make one cloth mommy a little more liked than another one. So, if you give a baby two cloth toys, one green that feeds it and one tan that does not, the baby spends more time with the green toy. But by four months, the baby treats both toys the same. \n\nIt's interesting that, just like puppies follow more even when punished, and lambs do the same, baby monkeys cling more when they're scared. In one test, a cloth toy could blow air at the baby monkey. A noise would warn the monkey before the air blew. Even though the baby monkeys learned what to expect, instead of running away, they held on tighter. This also happened with baby monkeys whose mothers were very mean to them. This strange behavior is because anything scary makes the baby want to cling more. We will talk more about this later.\n\n_How This Works for People_\n\nEven though these tests seem to show that other mammals don't just want food, it's still not clear for people. The evidence for people is not clear. But, some things suggest that what makes people want to be close to others is not very different from other mammals.\n\nFirst, we know that a human baby is born with a strong grip. This was first seen by someone named Fred. Second, babies like being around people. Even when they're very young, babies like being picked up, talked to, or touched, and they soon like watching people move around. Third, babies babble and smile more when an adult pays attention to them. They don't need food or care, although these things can help. So, it's clear that human babies like social things and like interacting with others quickly. We will talk more about this in a later chapter.\n\nLittle kids like to make friends. They can even become good friends with other kids their own age. They can become so close that when one kid leaves, the other one will cry and follow. When the kid comes back, the other one will be happy and run up to them. Some smart people, like Sophia and Alice, noticed this. They also noticed that a group of six little kids, who were three and four years old, only liked to play with each other. \n\nIt's interesting because a little kid can become good friends with someone even if that person doesn't give them food or take care of them. This was noticed by some smart people who were studying sixty little kids. They found that one out of five of the kids' best friends didn't feed them or change their diapers. They think that a kid will become good friends with someone who talks and plays with them a lot. \n\nSome experiments show that kids do better at things when they are praised by other people. For example, a baby that is two weeks old can learn to look at things if an adult plays peek-a-boo with them. Also, kids do better at simple tasks when they are praised for doing it right. \n\nAll this shows that little kids can become good friends with other people even if those people don't give them food or keep them warm. Some people still think that kids only like people who feed them. But this idea doesn't make sense anymore. \n\nSome people think this idea is still good because it explains why some people who are not feeling well act like little kids who only want to eat. According to this idea, when people act like this, they are just acting like little kids again. If we can't use that reason anymore, what else can we think of? There are three ways to think about this. First, even though we think loving behaviour can grow without food, it can't grow without sucking\u2014this is a puzzle we will talk about more in the next chapter. So, the idea of going back to a younger state is not completely wrong. Second, sometimes a person might think that something they do with their mouth is the same as having a relationship with a person; for them, a small part represents the whole thing. Third, it seems likely that in many cases, something a person does with their mouth is something they do when they can't do what they want, and it seems to happen out of nowhere. We will talk about possible ways this can happen when there is a conflict in Chapter 6. Since these ideas are at a basic level, a short talk about their role in human life might be helpful.\n\nWhen we work with people, we are used to seeing one activity replace another because the two are symbolically the same. It might be hard to think that similar replacements can also happen at a basic level. Here are two examples. A child who is in trouble sucks his thumb; a child who is away from his mom eats too much. In these situations, it is possible to think of the thumb and food as being symbols of the mom as a whole or at least of the nipple and milk. Another way to think about it is that these activities are replacements made by the mind at a basic level, like the nest-building behaviour of fighting birds; in other words, to think that when a child's love for his mom is stopped sucking or over-eating grows as a non-symbolic out-of-place activity. It is important to note that something like this almost certainly happens in non-human animals. Both monkey and chimpanzee babies who grow up without moms to cling to show a lot of self-sucking. Nissen says that, though thumb-sucking is not seen in baby chimps raised with their moms, it happens in about 80 per cent of those raised alone. It is the same with monkeys. In Harlow's lab, a grown-up female monkey sucked her own breast and a male sucked his own private part. Both had been raised alone. In these cases, what we would all call mouth symptoms had grown as a result of the baby being taken away from a mom-figure and by means of things which seem clearly basic. Could it be the same for mouth symptoms in human babies?\n\nThe observations of Alice and Sophia on the six children from a bad place are suggestive: 'Patrick, Rachel, Jack and Lily were all constant thumbsuckers'. The authors believe that all of them were let down by the world around them. They keep going:\n\nWhen the kids sucked more because their world was changing a lot, they knew they were leaving BB place at the end of the year, and started to suck more during the day. This sucking... changed depending on how the kids felt about what was happening around them...\n\nIf this kind of change can happen in little kids, maybe a process happening at a lower level can explain some of the mouth symptoms that show up in older people when their world becomes hard, for whatever reason?\n\nWhether this way of thinking about mouth symptoms is right or not, we need to do more research to find out. It's talked about here to show that the idea of attachment behavior we're suggesting can be a good alternative to the old ways of explaining mouth symptoms based on secondary drive theory.\n\nThe question about imprinting\n\nOnce we stop thinking about secondary drive and start looking for clues in the work of LO and those inspired by him, the question is whether the way we develop attachment behavior in people is like imprinting.\n\nIn his first thoughts about imprinting, LO (in the middle of the 20th century) said that this doesn't happen in mammals. But over time, viewpoints have changed. On one side, the ideas of imprinting have gotten bigger (see Chapter 10). On the other, experiments with mammals that are not humans have shown that, in a few species at least, development is enough like that of birds that leave the nest early to make comparing them useful. So, as long as we don't make easy assumptions like HI (in the middle of the 20th century) warned against, it's good to think about whether something like imprinting happens in people. This brings up the question of whether something like this happens in mammals that are not humans.\n\n_Not Human Mammals_\n\nEnough has been said in the part before this to show that the way attachment behavior develops in a number of mammal species is a lot like the way it develops in birds that leave the nest early. So, at first, many actions that are directed at a mother can be caused by a wide range of things. Usually, there's a narrowing down of things that work, due to learning from exposure and the reinforcing properties of some things you can perceive, like touch, movement, and the sound of motherly calls. Once the individual characteristics of an attachment-figure are learned, the responses are mainly or only directed towards it. Once a figure is chosen, preference for that figure tends to be stable; and a shift of attachment behavior from a familiar figure to a new and strange one becomes harder and harder. A big reason for this is that in mammals, as in birds, the reaction to any strange figure is, as the animal gets older, more and more likely to be one of fear and running away.\n\nThe story of how baby dogs and baby monkeys learn to be scared is a good example of this. \n\nWe can learn a lot from Scott's tests with baby dogs. If a baby dog meets a person before it is more than five weeks old, it is not scared. But, if the baby dog first meets a person when it is seven weeks old, it is scared for the first two days. If it is nine weeks old, it is scared for the first three days. If it is fourteen weeks old, it is scared for a whole week. The older the baby dog is when it first meets a person, the longer it is scared. Even after a long time, the baby dogs who met a person when they were fourteen weeks old are still a bit scared of people.\n\nHarlow and his friends found out the same thing with baby monkeys. Baby monkeys are not scared of new things or animals until they are six or seven weeks old. But, if a baby monkey is alone for the first three months of its life, it is very scared when it meets other monkeys. It does not move or eat. After a while, it starts to play with the other young monkeys. But, if a monkey is alone for the first six months of its life, it does not get better. It is very scared of new things and monkeys, and it stays scared for a long time.\n\nSo, both baby dogs and baby monkeys have a time when they can easily learn to like new things. After this time, it is harder for them to like new things.\n\nBirds and mammals are very similar in this way. Even though they are different types of animals, they are similar because they all have to learn how to survive.\n\nThe next chapters will talk about how human babies learn to like things. Like baby dogs and monkeys, human babies also learn slowly. There are many clues that tell us the following things about how children like to be around certain people more than others:\n\n  1. In baby humans, the ways they act around others first come from seeing many different things and later from seeing only a few things, usually from one or a few special people.\n  2. Babies seem to like some things more than others.\n  3. The more a baby spends time with a person, the more the baby likes that person.\n  4. Babies learn to tell different faces apart after they spend time looking and listening, which suggests that they learn from what they see and hear.\n  5. Most babies start to really like a special person during their first year. It seems like there's a special time in that year when they start to like a person the most.\n  6. It's not likely that this special time starts before about six weeks and it might start a few weeks later.\n  7. After about six months, and especially after eight or nine months, babies are more likely to be scared of people they don't know, and more likely to be really scared of them, than they are when they are younger. Because they get scared more often and more intensely, it becomes harder for them to start liking a new person towards the end of the first year and after.\n  8. Once a child really likes a special person, he usually likes that person more than anyone else, and this usually stays the same even if they are apart.\n\nWe'll talk more about why these things are true in later parts.\n\nSo, we can say that the way a baby human starts to like certain people more than others is a lot like the way it happens in other animals, and even birds, if we use the word \"imprinting\" to mean a general thing. To say otherwise would be to make a big and unnecessary difference between humans and other animals.\n\nWhy children like to be around certain people\n\nIn an earlier part, we made a clear difference between why a certain behavior happens and what that behavior does. If we think about a behavior like a system, things that make it start can be things like hormone level and certain things in the environment. What the behavior does, though, is help with survival. For example, boy animals acting in certain ways around girl animals is usually caused by hormone level and the presence of a girl animal; what it does is help with making more animals.\n\nIn old talks about a child's bond with his mom, the reasons and uses of the bond were not clear. So, there's no real talk about what the bond's use might be. Some people think the bond comes from hunger and it's good because it keeps the baby near his food. But this is not really talked about.\n\nSome might think that famous thinker Freud thought the main reason for a child's bond to his mom is to make sure he gets food. But Freud actually thought differently. In his first big talk about the problem, he said that the biggest danger for a baby is having too much need that he can't handle alone. But his mom can stop that danger. So, the baby, knowing from 'experience that she takes care of all his needs quickly',... 'wants to always see his mom'. The end of this talk seems to say that the bond between the baby and mom is good because it makes sure the mom is there to stop the baby from getting too much need. Food is important here because it helps take care of too much need.\n\nBut all the facts show that, no matter how it's thought about, the idea that the bond comes from hunger is wrong. And food only plays a little part in how a child bonds with his mom. So, we need to think again about why a child bonds with his mom.\n\nA view I've already shared is that the bond helps protect the child from bad animals. Another idea is that it gives the baby a chance to learn from his mom about things needed to live. This idea is sometimes talked about and seems to be hinted at in a paper by a person named Murphy.\n\nNow, these two ideas don't go against each other. Not just that: both are very possible. If there are bad animals around, a child's bond with his mom no doubt helps keep him safe. With his mom, a child can also learn things that are good for living. Since both of these things come from the bond, and they're good things, why can't we agree that both are probably uses?\n\nBut to decide that way is to avoid a problem. As we talked about in Chapter 8, the use of a certain behavior is not _any_ good thing that comes from it. The use is actually more specific: it's the thing that over time has made the behavior part of a kind's biological tools. Some behaviors help us survive and have more babies. Some people are born with these behaviors and can learn them quickly. Because they can learn these behaviors quickly, they have more babies who can also learn quickly. Soon, everyone can learn these behaviors quickly. We want to know why these behaviors help us have more babies.\n\nOne behavior is sticking close to mom. We don't know why this helps us, but we can guess. Maybe it helps because babies can learn important things from their moms. Babies watch what their moms do and copy them. This helps babies learn what to eat and how to act. Staying close to mom lets babies learn a lot.\n\nBut there are things we don't understand. Why do we still want to be close to mom when we are grown up and don't need to learn anymore? And why do we want to be close to mom a lot when we are scared? We don't know why.\n\nAnother guess is that being close to mom helps protect us from animals that want to eat us. This is something that people who watch animals in nature know, but people who study the mind might not think about. All animals need to find food and have babies without being eaten by other animals. So behaviors that help us not get eaten are very important. This might be why we want to stick close to mom. There are three main reasons why this makes sense. First, we know from watching many types of birds and animals that an animal who is alone is more likely to be attacked by a bad creature than an animal who stays with others. Second, animals who are young, or sick, or mamas about to have babies are more likely to stick close to others because they are easy targets for bad creatures. Third, when an animal feels scared, it wants to be close to others. This is usually when they think a bad creature might be near. No other idea explains these things.\n\nWe also found that when a child is punished a lot, they want to be close to the one who punished them. This is hard to explain with any other idea, but it makes sense if we think that being close to others protects us from bad creatures. This is shown when a big, strong animal senses a bad creature or danger, he often scares or even attacks a child that gets too close to the danger (Hall and David, 1965; Kevin, 1963). The big, strong animal's actions scare the child, which makes the child want to be close to an adult. Many times, the child will go to the very animal that scared it, and by doing so, the child moves away from the danger.\n\nEven though these ideas are strong, there might be some doubt because of what we see when we study animals like monkeys. We don't see bad creatures attacking monkeys very often, and we never see them attacking chimps or big monkeys. Some people even think that these two types of big monkeys live in a safe place with no enemies. But, we don't know if this is true. Washburn and his friends (William, Jack, and Liam, 1965) ask this question:\n\nStudying how bad creatures and their food get along has been hard. Rare things, like a big bird attacking (Henry, 1952...), might be very important for animals to live, but we don't see these things happen often because when people are watching, it bothers the bad creature or the animal it wants to eat. We think that people don't think bad creatures eating animals is important because it's hard to see and because most of the time when we watch animals that live freely, we are in places where people have scared away or killed the bad creatures. Most bad creatures come out at night, and we still don't know a lot about what monkeys or apes do at night.\n\nWe have to stop there. Overall, we think that being close to others to keep safe from bad creatures is the most likely reason for this. That's what we'll assume in what we talk about next.\n\nA note on a big word: 'dependence'\n\nIn this story, I will not use words like 'dependence' and 'dependency'. These words come from the idea that a child needs his mom because she makes him happy. But these words come from an idea that is most likely not true. \n\nThe truth is, needing a mom and loving her are different things. For example, a baby needs his mom to take care of him, but he doesn't love her yet. On the other hand, a two or three-year-old child who is taken care of by strangers may still love his mom even if he doesn't need her at that time.\n\nThe word 'dependence' means one person needs another person for his life; it talks about what they do. But 'attachment', as I use it here, talks about how someone acts and doesn't talk about what they do. Because these words mean different things, we see that a baby needs his mom the most when he is born and less as he gets older, but a baby doesn't love his mom until he is more than six months old. These words are not the same.\n\nEven though these words are not the same, some people might say we could use 'dependency behaviour' instead of 'attachment behaviour', because many people are used to the word dependency. But there is another reason not to use it. The word 'dependency' has a bad meaning, but 'attachment' has a good meaning.\n\nPeople usually think it is better to be independent than dependent. In fact, calling someone dependent is usually not nice. But calling someone attached is nice. It is good for family members to love each other. On the other hand, it is not good for a person to not care about other people. So, being dependent is something to avoid, but being attached is something to cherish.\n\nBecause of these reasons, using the words 'dependence' and 'dependency need' can be confusing when we are talking about behavior that keeps people close. Even Sigmund Freud and Anna Freud, who believe in the idea of secondary drive, use the word 'attachment'.\n\nOther words that have been used are 'cathexis of object' and 'affiliation'.\n\n'Understanding feelings' has two problems. The first big problem is that it comes from a theory about energy, which is hard to understand. The second problem is that it does not talk about the differences between liking someone as a friend and liking someone in a special way, which we will talk about later in this chapter.\n\n'Friendship' was introduced by Matthew: 'This word includes all signs of being friendly and kind, and wanting to do things with others.' As such, it is a much wider idea than attachment and is not meant to cover behavior that is directed towards one or a few special people, which is the sign of attachment behavior. Matthew himself sees this difference and suggests an additional need \u2013 'helping'. In Matthew's idea, depending on someone is seen as a mix of friendship and helping.\n\nAnother problem with 'friendship' is that it is thought of in terms of 'needs', which are hard to understand. Since the word continues to be used in Matthew's original sense, it is clearly not a good alternative for attachment.\n\nAttachment and other ways of behaving in a group\n\nIn this chapter and the one before, we have talked about a child's bond to his mom without talking about any kind of social behavior. Instead, attachment is shown as a way of behaving that has its own order and serves its own purpose. Also, as far as romantic behavior has been talked about (see Chapter 10), it has been referred to as a way of behaving separate from attachment behavior, and one having a different growth and, of course, a different purpose. Does this mean, you might ask, that in the new idea no links between attachment and romantic feelings are thought to exist? If so, doesn't this ignore one of Freud's biggest ideas?\n\nThe short answer to these questions is that, even though seen as different ways of behaving, attachment behavior and romantic behavior are believed to have very close links. The new idea, therefore, clearly recognizes the problems that Freud's theory was meant to explain, but offers different explanations of them.\n\nSome parts of Freud's ideas about child's romantic feelings were meant to explain the fact that strange romantic behaviors usually start during childhood. In Chapter 10, we talk about a number of growth processes now known to be common in young animals that, if they go wrong, could lead to a different growth of the order of romantic behavior, and so may well be responsible for strange growth in humans.\n\nOther parts of theories about child's romantic feelings have been meant to explain the fact that the way an individual behaves romantically when he is an adult is much influenced by the way that individual behaved towards mom and/or dad when he was young. In traditional theories, the existence of such a link is explained by saying that the two ways of behaving, child and adult, are simply the different ways of showing a single force of love. On this idea, we understand that two things can connect and change each other; what we need to explain is how they are different. In a new idea, we understand that two things are different; what we need to explain is how they connect.\n\nThere are three big reasons why it is smart to think of liking someone and loving someone as two different things. The first reason is that you can feel them at different times. The second reason is that you can feel them towards different people. The third reason is that you start feeling them at different ages. Let's talk about these reasons one by one.\n\nYou usually start to like someone when you are very young and it can be very strong; when you grow up, you might not feel it as much. You start to love someone when you are older; when you are young, you might not understand it well.\n\nA big example of how liking and loving become active at different times is seen in animals. For example, a baby sheep follows its mom when it is young and, if it is a girl, keeps doing so. So, a group of sheep is made up of babies following moms following grandmas, and so on, and it is led by the oldest sheep. So in female sheep, and in girls of many related animals, the behavior of liking remains strong from birth until death. Loving in these animals is, by contrast, sometimes. When they are almost grown up the boys leave the group and stay with other boys. Only once or twice a year, they go to the girls and try to find a mate. Then the boys leave again and both boys and girls live without loving until the next season. So not only do the actual ways of liking and loving differ but the times when they are most active differ greatly also.\n\nAgain, who these different behaviors are directed towards can in some cases be quite different. For example, a baby duck that has liked a man may nonetheless love birds of its own kind. The reasons for this are, first, that different things can make each behavior happen and, second, that the times when each behavior becomes focused may differ as well. In mallard ducks experiment shows that the time for following is the first two days or so of life whereas that for loving behavior is from three to eight weeks (see Chapter 10). Even though we don't know a lot about animals, it's very likely that they choose their friends and the ones they like a lot at different times. In humans, it seems that people often choose a special thing they like around their third birthday, which is much later than when they choose who they like to be with.\n\nEven if that's not true, studies with animals like monkeys have made Henry very sure that in animals, the behaviors of liking someone and liking someone a lot are different.\n\nIn a recent look at their work, Henry and Hannah (a time long ago) talk about five ways of liking\n\nwhich bring together different individuals within a [monkey] group in good and helpful ways.... Each way grows through its own stages and is different in the things that make it happen. Usually the stages happen at the same time.... These five ways of liking, in order of growth, are: (1) The baby-monkey-mommy liking, which makes the baby monkey like the mommy [called here liking behaviour]; (2) the mommy-baby or mommy liking; (3) the baby-baby, same-age, or friend liking through which baby monkeys and child monkeys interact... and grow lasting liking for each other; (4) the boy-girl liking, ending in teenager liking and finally in those grown-up behaviors leading to having babies; and (5) the daddy liking, broadly defined in terms of positive responsiveness of grown-up males toward babies, children, and other members of their particular groups.\n\nThe reasons given by Henry and Hannah for separating these ways of liking from each other are, it will be noted, the same as those already given here, that 'Each way grows through its own stages and is different in the things that make it happen'. The tests that make them believe this are in their science papers.\n\nSo, there is good proof that in monkeys as well as in other kinds of animals the properties of liking someone and liking someone a lot are different; nor is there reason to think that humans are any different. However, different though the two ways are, there is good proof also that they can affect each other and influence how each other grows. This happens in other species as well as in humans.\n\nLiking someone is made up of a number of parts and the same is true of liking someone a lot. Some parts are shared. They are thus seen as elements in both types of behavior, though usually more typically in one than in the other. For example, movements seen typically during liking a lot in some kinds of ducks are seen also in baby ducks, in which case the movements are directed towards whatever object makes them follow (Fabricius, a time long ago). In people, holding on and kissing are things we do when we like someone or when we are friends with someone.\n\nAndrew (1964) found that young male birds and young male guinea-pigs, when given a special thing to grow faster, show friendly behavior towards anything they are used to. But if they are not used to anything, they don't show friendly behavior. This means that being friendly and liking someone may have some things in common.\n\nIt might be that being friendly, liking someone, and taking care of others have some things in common. For example, in birds, the male feeds the female in the same way they feed their young ones, and the female asks for food from the male the same way their young ones do (Hinde, 1966).\n\nIn people, it's common for someone to treat the person they like as if they were their parent, and the other person might act like a parent in return. This might mean that the person who acts like a child has kept this behavior from when they were a child, which is not usual.\n\nWe need to learn more about these things. But it's clear that being friendly, liking someone, and taking care of others are different things that can happen at the same time.\n\nFor more information about this, see the work of Maccoby and Masters (1970).\n\nSome people who study learning think that the way we act friendly can be explained by how we learn from others (Gewirtz, 1961). But this doesn't consider that we might be born with certain ways of acting. If we ignore this, there might be problems.\n\nRecently, Murphy (1964) suggested a different idea, but didn't show any new facts to support it. So, even though Murphy said that food might not be the only important thing, he didn't provide any new information. She thinks that a baby only likes his mom because she makes him happy, keeps him safe, and takes care of him. Babies do not like their mom just because they follow her. If this was true, babies would not like other kids or adults who don't do these things.\n\nWhen talking about animals and birds, Henry says that if they seem the same, it might just be because they live in similar places, not because they are really the same. \"Looking at one problem,\" he says, \"may make the other problem clearer, but it won't solve it. We have to look at each problem carefully.\"\n\nIn another experiment, Frank and Cameron found that if puppies who were alone were given a small amount of medicine before meeting others, they were not as scared. Because of this, puppies who were alone from three weeks old to fifteen weeks old were less scared when they met new things than puppies who didn't get medicine. They were not as scared to meet the person doing the experiment, and they started to make friends.\n\nThis idea was also suggested by Kevin.\n\nMatthew says: \"... the mother not only feeds the baby and takes care of him... but also helps him grow up...\"\n\nKevin talks about young monkeys who have left their mom but are not grown up yet. When a big monkey scares them, they always run to the biggest monkey they can find, usually a big male. But sometimes, this big monkey is the one who scared them in the first place, so they run to the monkey that scared them (told by Thomas, 1959).\n\nWhen talking about how to study animals eating other animals, William says that the best way is to watch the animals who might eat others. So, even though people have studied monkeys a lot, no one has seen a leopard attack them. But, a recent study by Samuel shows that 27% of leopard droppings have parts of these monkeys in them. The new proof that being eaten is a big reason for how monkeys look and act is also talked about by William.\n\nIn this book, we use some words to talk about how social animals behave.\n\n_Chapter 13_\n\nHow Being in Control Affects Making Friends\n\nThey must be free\n\nLike fishes in the sea\n\nOr birds in the sky\n\nWhile you stay\n\nThe place where they come back without a plan.\n\nFR country Lady\n\nStarting\n\nFOR A SECOND kind of idea the facts of sticking close behaviour prove hard and stubborn. For a control kind of idea, they present an interesting challenge. Once we start to think this way, the big ideas of possible solutions are not too hard to see.\n\nIn Chapter 5 it was said that much animal behaviour keeps an animal for a long time close to certain things in the world. Examples are sitting-on-eggs behaviour, which keeps the animal close to eggs and nest for weeks, and home behaviour, which keeps the animal in a certain place for months and sometimes for years. It was also said that behaviour with this kind of expected result could be simple or more complex. A simpler version, for example, could make it more likely to move towards a certain thing the further away from that thing. A main idea of this chapter is that sticking close behaviour is organised in this way.\n\nThe above idea is, of course, just the basic part of the theory to be suggested. To explain the behaviour that is actually seen, more detail is needed. First, the intensity with which sticking close behaviour is shown by a young child changes not only from day to day but from hour to hour and from minute to minute; so it is important to look at the conditions that start and stop sticking close behaviour, or that change the intensity at which it is started. Second, big changes happen during babyhood and childhood in the way the different systems showing sticking close behaviour are organised. Before these things are talked about, however, the role of the mother as partner must be thought about. Because not only may increased distance be caused by movement either of mother or of child, but decreased distance likewise can result from movement of either of the two parties.\n\nThe roles of child and of mother in mother\u2013child interaction\n\n_Interaction a Result of Several Kinds of Behaviour_\n\nAnyone who watches how a mother and her one or two-year-old child behave over a period of time will see that each shows very many different patterns. While some of the behaviour of each partner makes them closer or keeps them close, much of it is of a completely different sort. Some is not about being close: mother cooks or sews; child plays with a ball or empties mother's handbag. Other behaviour is against staying close: mother goes to another room or child leaves to climb the stairs. Other behaviour again may be a saying no to wanting to be close: sometimes, usually rare, either mother or child may feel so annoyed and angry as to act in a way that makes them farther from the other. Staying close, therefore, is only one of many results that the behaviour of the two partners may have.\n\nEven on a normal day, a child and his or her mother usually don't go too far away from each other. If they do, one of them will likely do something to get closer again. Sometimes the mother might call the child or go to see where the child is. Other times, the child might run back to the mother or start crying.\n\nSo, there is a balance between the mother and child. Even though they might do different things, they usually stay within a certain distance from each other. To understand this, we can think about four types of actions:\n\n  1. The child wanting to be close to the mother;\n  2. The child doing things that take him or her away from the mother, like exploring or playing;\n  3. The mother taking care of the child;\n  4. The mother doing things that are not related to taking care of the child.\n\nSometimes, the child or the mother might not do any of these actions. Also, what one of them does can affect what the other one does. For example, if the mother leaves, the child might want to be close to her more and stop exploring. On the other hand, if the child goes too far while exploring, the mother might stop what she's doing to take care of the child. In a happy pair, these four types of actions work well together. But, there's always a chance of conflict.\n\nThis shows that the child wanting to be close to the mother is just one of four types of actions. Two of these actions are by the child and two are by the mother. These four actions make up the relationship between the mother and child. Now, let's talk about the action that takes the child away from his or her mother.\n\n_Exploring and Playing_\n\nIn the past ten years, a lot of people have started to agree with a thought that Piaget had a long time ago: exploring and learning about things is as important as eating and other important actions.\n\nWhen a child explores, there are three main things that happen: First, the child looks and turns his or her body towards the thing they want to explore. This helps the child get ready to explore. Second, the child goes closer to the thing, which helps the child learn more about it. Third, the child touches or plays with the thing to learn even more about it. Birds and animals, especially the ones like crows and monkeys, do a lot of looking around. This is more common in young ones. They are usually interested in new or complex things. If you leave a new thing in a cage with an animal, be it a monkey, rat, or big animal, they will check it out. After a while, they lose interest because it's not new anymore. But if you give them another new thing or bring back the old thing after some time, they get interested again.\n\nSometimes, an animal will keep pushing buttons or opening things for a long time if they get a new toy or get to see a new thing. They don't need food for this. Also, if there is food and a new thing at the same time, the animal will usually look at the new thing first, even if it's hungry.\n\nHumans, especially children, do the same thing. Every mom knows that a baby loves to look at changing things. A baby as young as four months can learn to touch a ball if it means they get to watch a short movie. Moms also know that a baby will stop eating if something new comes into view. That's how much babies like new things. So much so that we say 'like a child with a new toy' when someone is really focused on something.\n\nLooking around is not just something animals do when they're eating or doing other things. It's a behavior all on its own. It's like a system that helps them learn about their surroundings. It starts when they see something new and stops when they are familiar with it. This behavior turns new things into familiar things.\n\nOne interesting thing about this behavior is that the same things that make an animal want to look around can also scare them. Because of this, an animal or child might approach something with interest but also pull back because they're scared. Usually, they start by being scared of something very new. Then they look at it from a distance for a long time. If the thing doesn't move or make scary sounds, they will get closer to it and look at it more - at first carefully, then more confidently. Being around a friend or mom, especially for young ones, makes this process faster.\n\nPlaying with friends seems to start like exploring and playing with things that don't move. What some people wrote about little monkeys probably is the same for kids:\n\nThe things that make a monkey look at and touch things are probably the same things that make them want to look at and touch other monkeys.... A monkey can have fun with things that move, but nothing can give a baby monkey as much fun as playing with other monkeys.... Playing probably starts as doing things alone with lots of different things.... These ways of playing alone... are probably the start of the fun ways of playing with others that come later.\n\nIf a kid is taken away from his mom, he will want to explore and play. This is the opposite of wanting to be with his mom. On the other hand, if a mom goes to her kid, this is like wanting to be with him.\n\n_Taking care of kids_\n\nIn all animals that feed milk to their babies, including people, moms do more than one thing to take care of their babies. In some animals it is good to think about feeding, building a home, and bringing back. Each thing is important if the babies are going to live, but for now, bringing back is the most interesting.\n\nBringing back is when a mom or dad does something that makes sure the babies are brought back to the home or close to mom, or both. While some animals use their mouth, monkeys use their hands and arms. Also, animals of most kinds use a special sound\u2014often a soft, low note\u2014that makes the babies want to come to them.\n\nIn people, bringing back has been called many things: 'taking care of', 'mom's care', and 'love' are some of them. Sometimes the more general term 'mom's care' is better; other times 'bringing back' is better. Especially, 'bringing back' makes us realize that a lot of what a mom does is about making the distance between the baby and mom smaller, and keeping the baby close to her. This important fact can easily be forgotten when we use other words.\n\nThe bringing back behavior of a monkey mom brings the baby into her arms and holds him there. Because it ends up like the behavior of the baby wanting to be with mom, it is probably best understood in the same way\u2014namely, as being caused by a number of behaviors the predictable result of which is keeping the baby close. The things that start and stop these behaviors can be studied. Among the things that affect when they start, the hormone levels of the mom almost certainly play a part. Among the things in the environment are where the baby is and what he is doing: for example, when a baby goes too far away or when he cries, a mom is likely to do something. If a mother sees her baby in danger or taken away by others, she tries very hard to get him back. She only stops when her baby is safe with her again. When her baby is happy playing with others she knows, she might just watch. But she's always ready to get him back if she needs to.\n\nJust like a child likes to be close to their mom, a mom likes to be close to her baby. A baby knows their mom after a few hours or days of being born. Once the baby knows their mom, the mom takes care of that baby only.\n\nA mom staying close to her baby helps to keep the baby safe. This is true for all animals, not just people. The baby is kept safe from bad things like falling or drowning.\n\nEven human moms do this. In some places, a mom stays very close to her baby, always able to see or hear him. If the mom or baby gets scared, the mom will do something right away. In other places, a mom might ask someone else to help take care of her baby for part of the day. But most moms want to be close to their babies and little kids. Whether they stay close or not depends on many things, like who they are, where they live, and how much money they have.\n\n_What Moms Do That Is Different From Taking Care of Their Babies_\n\nWhen a mom takes care of a baby, she does other things too. Some of these things can be done at the same time as taking care of the baby. But some things can't be done at the same time as taking care of the baby.\n\nThings that can be done at the same time as taking care of a baby include things like cleaning the house. Most of the time, these things can be stopped quickly if the mom needs to take care of the baby. But some things are harder to stop, like taking care of other family members, especially the dad and other little kids. So, a mom sometimes has problems, and this can affect how she takes care of her baby.\n\nBut, if a mom is just busy with other things and not able to spend time with her baby, it's different from if she doesn't want to touch the baby or doesn't like when the baby cries. This can make a mom want to stay away from her baby. A regular mom might stay away sometimes, but not a lot, and she will start taking care of the baby again when she needs to. But, a mom who is very sad might stay away a lot and not take care of the baby as she should.\n\nIn the same way, a baby wants to be with its mom, but also wants to explore and play. A mom wants to be with her baby, but she also has other things to do.\n\nThis is a short way of talking about how a mom and baby act with each other.\n\nIt's important to remember that all of this makes the mom and baby feel really strong emotions, either happy or sad. When everything is going well, both the mom and baby feel happy when they are together and showing love to each other. But, when there's a lot of problems, either the mom or baby might feel very scared or sad, especially if one of them is not being nice.\n\nIn the big idea from Chapter 7, this means that the mom and baby both want to be close and loving to each other. Being close and loving feels good, but being far away and mean feels bad. This is how most people feel, and it doesn't usually change. So, we expect that babies will love their moms and moms will love their babies. But, if someone feels very different, we might think that something is wrong.\n\n_Change in Who Keeps Baby and Mom Close_\n\nDuring the time when a baby is growing up, the job of keeping the mom and baby close together changes from the mom to the baby.\n\nIn all animals like us, including people, when a baby is very small, it can't hold on or move around. So, the baby might go too far away. So, there's a time when the mom has to keep the baby close. At first, she holds the baby to her, like other animals do and like people used to do. In today's world, this is the time when a mom puts her baby in a crib or carrier. The mom takes care of her baby all the time. She never goes far away without asking someone else to look after her baby.\n\nThe next step is when the baby can move. For small monkeys, it happens in a week or two, for big monkeys, it's a month or two, and for humans, it's about six months. In all these types, even though the baby wants to stay close to his mom, he can't do it all the time. If his mom is not moving, he likes to play around but sometimes he goes too far for his mom to see. When his mom is walking, he can't follow her well. So, during this time, the baby stays close to his mom because she keeps him close, not because he can do it himself. In humans, this lasts until about three years old. During these two and a half years, the baby wants to be close to his mom, but he can't always do it well.\n\nIn the next step, things change. Now, the baby can stay close to his mom better and he knows when he needs to be close to her and when he doesn't. Sometimes, the mom tells him to stay away a little. But if the mom gets scared, she looks for her child and holds him tight. And if they are in a new place, the mom keeps a close eye on her child to make sure he is not too curious. In humans, this step lasts a long time, depending on how the family lives. For example, in big cities, most children are not allowed to go far from home alone until they are ten years old.\n\nSlowly, this step changes into the last step where the mom lets the child decide how close he wants to be. From then on, unless there is an emergency, the mom doesn't do much.\n\nHow a child shows he wants to be close to his mom can be seen in many ways like crying, calling, babbling, smiling, clinging, sucking not for food, and moving to get close, follow, and find. From an early age, each of these ways results in the child being close to his mom. Later, each of these ways becomes part of bigger systems.\n\nAll ways of showing closeness are aimed at a special person, usually the mom. For this to happen, the child has to focus on his mom; he does this in different ways. For example, by six months, most children are good at knowing their mom from other people and at following her movements by looking and listening. A baby knows where their mom is so they can show their love to her. They look for her and then show their love. They can show their love in two ways:\n\n  1. They make noises or move to get mom to come to them;\n  2. They go to mom.\n\n_Making Noises_\n\nCrying, smiling, and making sounds, and later calling and making signs, are ways to get mom to come. But, each noise or sign is made at different times and makes mom do different things. For example, crying can mean different things. It can be crying because of hunger or crying because of pain. Crying from hunger starts quiet and gets louder over time. Crying from pain is loud right away. \n\nBoth kinds of crying make mom act, but in different ways. The pain cry makes mom come fast. The hunger cry makes mom come slower. In the first case, she is ready to help the baby right away; in the second, she is ready to feed him or make him feel better.\n\n_Smiling_ and _making sounds_ happen at different times than crying, and make mom act differently as well.\n\nUnlike crying, which works from when a baby is born, smiling and making sounds do not work until about four weeks later. Also unlike crying, smiling and making sounds happen when a baby is awake and happy, not hungry, alone, or in pain. Finally, while crying makes mom act to protect, feed, or comfort her baby, smiling and making sounds make mom act differently. When a baby smiles and makes happy noises, a mom smiles back, talks to him, touches and pats him, and maybe picks him up. They both seem happy to be with each other, and this makes them spend more time together. We could call this 'mom's loving behavior'.\n\nThe baby's smiles not only make the mom act this way right away, but they also probably make her act this way more in the future. Adam (a person who wrote about this) said that when a mom sees her baby's first social smile, it makes her even more likely to respond to him. When she is tired and upset with her baby, his smile makes her feel better; when she is feeding him or taking care of him, his smile is a reward for her. In scientific words, a baby's smile makes a mom more likely to respond to his signals quickly and in a way that is good for his survival. Hearing her baby's happy noises probably does the same thing.\n\nAt first, crying, smiling, and making happy noises are not aimed at anything. The baby just makes a noise and either the mom responds or she doesn't. When she does respond, the baby usually stops crying or smiling. As many people know, a good way to stop a baby from crying is to pick him up and rock him, or maybe talk to him. What fewer people know is that when a baby is picked up he also stops smiling (Adam said this).\n\nMaking happy noises works a bit differently. When a baby makes happy noises, the mom usually makes happy noises back and they go back and forth like this for a while. But picking the baby up usually makes him stop.\n\nWhen a mom doesn't respond to a signal from the baby, different things can happen. Sometimes, like with crying, the baby will keep making the noise for a long time. Other times, he might stop, or maybe start making a different noise. If a baby's smile isn't responded to, he won't keep smiling forever; he might start crying instead. Similarly, an older child who starts by calling for his mom might start crying if she doesn't come.\n\nA very different kind of signal that is very interesting is when a baby raises his arms. This can happen when a baby about six months old sees his mom near his bed, or when a crawling or walking child gets close to his mom or she gets close to him. The mom always thinks this means the baby wants to be picked up, and she usually picks him up.\n\nThe way humans raise their arms is a lot like how monkeys reach out to grab onto their mom's sides. This happens in baby monkeys as part of how they cling to their mom. It seems that when little kids raise their arms, it might be a way they learned to send a message. Another way they send messages is by trying to get mommy's attention. Among the twenty-three kids studied by a person named Shirley, the first one who started trying to get mommy's attention was thirty-two weeks old, and half of them were doing it two weeks later.\n\nFrom about eight months old, babies and little kids really want their parents to pay attention to them and they're not happy until they get it. This can sometimes be annoying. But if we think of it as part of how kids get attached to their parents, it makes sense, and we can be more understanding. When a kid is under three or four years old, it's really important that mommy knows where he is and what he's doing, and is ready to help if there's danger. So it's good for him to keep telling her where he is and what he's doing until she says she got the message.\n\n_Approach Behavior_\n\nThe two best-known ways that kids get close to mommy and stay there are, first, getting closer and following, using whatever way of moving they have, and, secondly, holding on tight. Another way, which is not so easily noticed, is sucking or grabbing at mommy's chest when they're not hungry.\n\nGetting closer to mommy and following her usually starts as soon as a human kid can move. Soon, and usually during the last part of the first year, this behavior gets organized around a goal. This means that if mommy changes her position, the kid changes his direction to follow her. Also, once a kid's thinking has grown enough that he can start to think about things that are not there and look for them, which a person named Piaget says starts at about nine months, a kid can be expected to not only get close and/or follow a mommy whom he can see or hear but also to look for her in places he knows when she is not there.\n\nTo reach his goal of being close to mommy, a kid will use any way of moving he can. He will crawl, shuffle, walk, or run. If he can't move well, for example because of a condition, he will still get to where he wants to be, even if it means rolling. These observations show that the behaviors are organized around a plan: the overall goal is always the same; the ways of reaching it can change.\n\nEven though human babies are not as good at holding on as monkey babies, they can still hold on when they are born. After four weeks, they can do it even better. At thirty days old, a baby can hold onto a rod with their hands for half a minute. But then, in some places, they get less good at it because they don't do it much. After about eighteen months, they get better at it again, but in a different way.\n\nThere are some things that can make a baby hold on more. Like when they don't have any clothes on or when they feel like they're moving too much. When a baby feels scared, they hold on really tight. For example, when a nine-month-old baby is with a stranger, they might hold on so tight that the stranger can't put them down.\n\nSome people used to think that babies holding on was because people used to live in trees. But really, it's just like how monkey babies hold on. It's not as good, but it's for the same reason. At first, it's just a simple thing that babies do without thinking. Later, it becomes a thing they do on purpose.\n\nBabies also like to suck on things. It's not just for eating. All baby monkeys and humans like to suck on things like nipples, even when they're not eating. Human babies like to suck on their thumbs or toys. Monkey babies that don't have a mom do it all the time. If they do have a mom, they suck on her nipple. This means that sucking and holding onto the nipple helps the baby stay close to the mom. This is why sucking on things is like holding on.\n\nSo, holding onto things and sucking on things are two things that babies do. One is for eating, and the other is for staying close to their mom. Each of these things is important in its own way. It would be wrong to think that eating is more important and sticking close is less important. In fact, babies spend more time sucking for comfort than they do sucking for food.\n\nBecause sucking has two different purposes, it's not surprising that the way babies suck changes depending on what they're doing. The way they suck for comfort is less strong than the way they suck for food. A lady named Rachel noticed this. The baby baboon she was taking care of made it very easy to tell the difference. When the baboon was hungry, it sucked on a bottle; when it was scared, it sucked on a comforter. The baboon didn't think the bottle could make it feel safe, and of course, the other way around too. When it was scared and sucked on the comforter, the baby baboon quickly felt calm and happy.\n\nThese things help us understand why human babies spend so much time sucking for comfort. In some places, a baby will suck on his mom for comfort. In other places, a baby will suck on a pacifier, thumb, or comforter. No matter what the baby is sucking on, a baby who can suck for comfort is likely to be happier and calmer than one who can't. Just like with monkeys, a human child usually sucks for comfort when they're upset or scared. These things make us think that sucking for comfort is its own thing, separate from sucking for food, and that it's a big part of how babies feel close to their moms.\n\nThis is a quick look at some of the main ways that babies feel attached to a mom-figure. In the next chapters, these ways and others are talked about in more detail.\n\n_How Strong the Attachment Behaviour Is_\n\nBecause there are many ways and steps that can make a baby feel attached, there's no simple way to measure how strong it is. Instead, each way a baby can feel attached can be stronger or weaker, and as it gets stronger, more and different ways may start to show up. So, the ways that usually show up when the attachment is not very strong are smiling, moving relaxed, watching, and touching. When the attachment is very strong, the baby is likely to move quickly and cling. Crying is always there when the attachment is very strong, and sometimes it's there when the attachment is not very strong.\n\nLet's talk about how little ones behave when they want to be close to their mom.\n\nIn Chapter 5 of a big book, there's a part that talks about how little ones behave differently. Some of them have a goal in mind and some don't. When little ones behave in a certain way, there is usually a result that we can guess. For example, when a bird dives down fast to catch its food, it does it with a goal in mind. But when a goose rolls her egg back to her nest, she doesn't really have a goal. She just does it because that's what she does.\n\nWhen we talk about how little ones want to be close to their mom, some do it with a goal in mind and others don't. The little ones who don't have a goal in mind are usually very young. But as they get older, especially after their first birthday, they start to behave with a goal in mind more and more.\n\nLet's think about two ways little ones behave that make their mom come close to them, but they don't really have a goal in mind. When a four-month-old baby sees his mom after she's been away for a little bit, he usually smiles. His mom sees his smile and comes closer to him, smiles back, talks to him, and maybe even picks him up. The baby's smile makes his mom come closer, but the baby doesn't smile more or less if his mom is coming closer or not. The baby just smiles because he sees his mom's face and likes it, especially when she's looking straight at him and not from the side. The baby stops smiling when his mom picks him up.\n\nAnother way little ones behave that makes their mom come close is crying. When a baby cries, his mom usually comes to him. But the baby doesn't cry more or less if his mom is close or far, or if she's coming or going.\n\nAfter about eight months, and especially after their first birthday, little ones start to behave in more clever ways to be close to their mom. Sometimes, a little one will keep a close eye on his mom, happy to play as long as she's there but following her when she moves. This shows that the little one is behaving with a goal in mind: he wants his mom to be in sight or touch, and if that changes, he'll do something about it. Once it is turned on, the child keeps moving, fixing their path as needed, until they can see or touch their mom again, then the system stops.\n\nAnother way that children show attachment is by calling out. During the second year of life, a child often starts calling for their mom in a new way. How they call changes based on where they think their mom is and what she's doing, getting louder if they think she's far away or leaving, getting quieter if they think she's close or coming to them.\n\nAfter a child moves or calls out in a goal-focused way, they often show another kind of attachment behavior like lifting their arms up or reaching out to grab a hand, which usually ends with the child and mother touching. In these cases, the actions seem to be linked together like a chain. The second action only happens when the child and mother are close enough.\n\nTypical behavior of two-year-olds in different situations\n\nThe specific actions that show attachment and the combinations in which they can appear at different ages and in different situations can be very different. But, after a certain age, like fifteen months, certain actions and combinations of actions tend to happen often, and certain ones usually happen when a child is in one of a few specific situations. One main way to describe these situations is by where the mom is and what she's doing; another way is by whether the place is familiar or strange to the child.\n\nWhat comes next is an attempt to describe typical behavior in a few common situations. But because there are so many things that can affect behavior, and because different children act in different ways, and because there aren't many careful studies, only a rough outline can be given.\n\n_How a child behaves when Mom is there and not moving_\n\nOften, a one or two year old child in a familiar place is happy for half an hour or more to play and explore, using their mom who is sitting still as a base. In these situations, the child stays close by looking at her, keeping in mind where she is, and moving around. Clinging, sucking, and crying are all missing. Looking at each other and sometimes smiling or touching lets each one know the other one knows where they are.\n\nObservations of how young children act when they're with their mom in a quiet part of a park are reported by Anderson (1972). Anderson watched children thought to be between fifteen months and two and a half years, whose moms were sitting quietly letting them run around in what was probably a familiar place, and noted each child's movements relative to their mom over a period of fifteen minutes. Of the thirty-five children observed, twenty-four stayed within about 200 feet of their mom the whole time, moving away from her and back again without her doing anything to keep them close. Anderson notes how the children were able to keep their attention on their mom while moving a distance away from her. Out of the remaining eleven children, eight went further, drawn by swings or similar things; in each case, mom followed to keep an eye on her child. Only three children had to be brought back because they went too far or mom couldn't see them.\n\nMost of the time, the children moved either directly away from mom or directly towards her, moving in short steps with many stops. Going back to mom seemed to be done in longer steps and quicker than the journey away. Stops near mom were rare but lasted longer; those far away were more often and much shorter.\n\nAdam says that only very rarely did the going out or coming back relate to what was happening: 'With no clear reason other than wanting to be on his feet away from her, he wiggles free and moves a few steps away, there to stand until he starts moving again'; most times the journey back starts without him even looking at his mom. Out of forty-nine times kids went back to mom, only two seemed to have been because of something to do with mom: on each occasion she had been joined by a friend.\n\nKids can stop some distance from mom, a few feet from her, or touching her. In about a quarter the child touched mom by climbing on her lap, leaning against her knee, or pulling her hand. Just as many times he came close but didn't actually touch her. Half the time he stopped at a distance.\n\nNeither children nor moms talked to each other unless they were close. When more distant a child didn't talk much, and then only to himself. Moms didn't often try to get their child back by calling him, and when they did, it usually didn't work.\n\nAlthough not reported in detail by Adam, we know from other people that, when playing near a mom who is not moving, a child often wants her attention and is not happy until he gets it. In a story about how thirteen-month-old kids interact with mom at home, Alice and David (1965) describe one child who didn't often touch mom and their interaction was mostly watching each other. After noting how mom watched her son and gave him many things to play with, they continue:\n\nBen watches his mom a lot.... He wants to be looked at and doesn't like it when mom gets too focused on her work.... He then becomes whiny and frustrated, very much as he does when his mom goes away....\n\nCompared to this pair, Alice and David found other couples who interacted as much by touching as by looking.\n\n_When Mom is Present and Moving_\n\nThere's a time in a child's life when he can keep close to a moving person by walking towards them. This age is probably around the third birthday and is therefore much later than most people think. Even if a two and a half year old kid can walk well and go on long trips while mom stays still, once she starts to move, he can't walk very well. Not many people know this about little kids, and it can make parents very frustrated. We learn this from Alice's work.\n\nUsually, when the mom of one of the kids Alice was watching stood up after sitting for a while, she would tell her kid. If she asked him, he would happily get in his stroller. But if mom wanted him to walk, things got hard unless she walked really slow and held his hand. Most of the time, Alice says, mom would get upset, pick her kid up by his arm and pull him away.\n\nIf mom stood up suddenly without telling him, maybe to get something, the kid would probably just stay where he was. If she then wanted him to come to her, she would have to be very patient and kind; otherwise he would probably just stay where he was.\n\nAlice also watched twelve more kids of the same age who were walking while their moms walked in the park, and she saw that they didn't follow very well. Over and over a kid would stop, often far from mom, so that every mom spent more time waiting for her kid than walking. Eight of the kids walked away and had to be brought back. Half of them were being carried by the end of the short time Alice was watching, three because the kid wanted to be and three because the mom wanted to.\n\nAlice's work shows that kids younger than about three years can't keep up with someone moving, and that until this age, being carried by mom is the best way. This is shown by how quickly kids this age want to be carried, how happy and balanced they are when they're being carried, and also by how strongly and suddenly they ask to be carried. Alice tells how a kid walking by his mom's side would suddenly turn to face her, with arms up. It was so quick that mom could easily trip over him and even knock him over. The fact that the kid keeps doing this even when he gets knocked over shows that it's a natural thing for him to do when he sees his mom moving.\n\nWe know from what we can see that, in all kinds of places, parents usually carry kids younger than three years when they're going somewhere. In places like ours, this is usually in some kind of stroller; but being carried by a parent is not rare. In a research by Ryan and Katherine, they looked at more than five hundred kids being carried by grown-ups (mostly mom and dad) in public places in WA city. They found that almost 89 per cent were younger than three years old, and the number was about the same for each of the three years. Kids older than three years old were not carried as much: 8 per cent were in their fourth year and only 2 per cent were older.\n\nAfter they turn three, most kids can walk and keep up with their mom or dad even when they are moving. But for a couple more years, many kids still want to hold their mom or dad's hand or the handle of a stroller. Most kids stop holding hands after they turn seven, but not all kids are the same.\n\n_When Mom Leaves_\n\nAfter they turn one, and sometimes even before, kids often cry when they see mom leave. The cry can be small or very loud. They often also try to follow her. But how they act depends on a lot of things. For example, younger kids are more likely to cry and less likely to follow. Another thing is how mom leaves: if she leaves slowly and quietly, the kid is less likely to cry or follow, but if she leaves quickly and loudly, the kid is more likely to cry and try to follow. Another thing is if the place is familiar or not. If the place is familiar, the kid may be okay; if the place is not familiar, the kid is likely to cry or try to follow.\n\nSeeing mom leave makes kids act differently than when they are just alone. Many kids who cry and try to follow when they see mom leave are okay to play by themselves if they know where mom is and can go to her if they want. They may play for up to one or two hours before they show signs of missing mom\u2014usually either looking for her or crying, depending on how old they are and other things.\n\n_When Mom Comes Back_\n\nHow a kid acts when mom comes back depends on how long she was gone and how the kid is feeling when she comes back, which also depends on how the kid and mom get along (see Chapter 16).\n\nAfter a short regular time away, a kid is almost certain to look at his mom and go to her. He may smile. If he is crying he is likely to stop, especially if she picks him up. When there has been a lot of crying he is likely to hold on to her and not let go when picked up.\n\nAfter a longer and not regular time away, a kid may be very upset when his mom comes back. If a child is feeling upset, he might not respond right away when he sees his mom. He might even pull away. If he's not crying, he might stay quiet for a bit and then start to cry. Once he's close to his mom, he'll likely stop crying. He might want to hold on tightly and not want to be put down. He might also do a lot of sucking that's not for eating.\n\nIf a child has been away from his mom for a few days or more, especially in a strange place, how he acts when he sees his mom again might be different than usual. It might be more intense or it might seem like he's not reacting at all.\n\nNo matter how a child reacts when he sees his mom, some of what he does is meant to get a certain result, while some of it might not be.\n\nSeeing how a child acts during his second and third years of life, when he really shows how he feels about his mom, can be different at different times. One moment the child might be happy exploring, with his mom out of sight and out of mind. The next moment, he might be looking for her desperately or crying for her. One day he might be happy and not need his mom much. The next day, he might be whiny and want his mom a lot.\n\nThinking about why a child might act differently at different times is like thinking about what makes a child start or stop showing how he feels about his mom.\n\nIn this part, we only think about actions that are meant to get a certain result and what affects them. We'll talk about actions that are not meant to get a certain result in the next part. We'll also talk about why a single child might act differently over months or years and why different children might act differently.\n\nIn the first version of this book, the idea was pretty simple, but more study has shown that it's not enough. So, in a later part, the idea is explained more. But for now, we start with the simple idea.\n\nLike most actions, how a child shows he feels about his mom can be a little bit or a lot. A big part of the idea is that what makes a child stop showing how he feels about his mom can be different depending on how much he's showing it. If he's showing it a lot, only being close to his mom will make him stop. If he's not showing it as much, seeing or hearing his mom might make him stop. Being close to someone else he likes might be enough if his mom's not there. These things can be different from very strict to relaxed.\n\nMany things can make a child show how he feels about his mom. The simplest might be just being far away from his mom. Anderson's observations show how important it is. Almost all children he watched stayed close to their mom; they would go back to her if they went too far. Time also matters. Even though we don't have a lot of facts, we know from watching toddlers that they look for their mom from time to time when they're busy playing. This shows that they want to be close to her.\n\nThere are three big reasons why children want to be close to their mom:\n\n  1. How the child feels:  \ntired  \nhungry  \nhurt  \ncold  \nsick\n  2. Where the mom is and what she's doing:  \nmom is not there  \nmom is leaving  \nmom is not letting the child come close\n  3. Other things around the child:  \nscary things happening  \nbeing pushed away by other adults or children.\n\nLet's first look at how the child feels.\n\nEvery mom knows that a child who is tired, hungry, cold, sick or hurt wants to be with her a lot. The child doesn't want to lose sight of her and often wants to sit on her lap or be held by her. When the child feels this way, he only stops wanting to be close to her when he can touch her. If the mom moves and breaks this touch, the child will cry, follow, cling - until they are touching again. But, when the child is not tired, hungry, cold, sick or hurt, he is happy even if mom is a bit far from him or just within earshot. So, these five feelings make the child want to be close to mom a lot and make it harder for him to stop wanting to be close to her.\n\nThe same happens when the child is scared or pushed away by another adult or child - things that happen around him.\n\nThings that are likely to scare a child are those that cause a big change, like bright light, sudden darkness, loud noise; and things that are strange or appear unexpectedly. A child who is really scared by these things will run to his mom; in other words, he wants to be close to her a lot and it's harder for him to stop wanting to be close to her. He might also cry or cling to her. But, if the child is only a little scared, he doesn't want to be close to her that much and it's easier for him to stop wanting to be close to her. Sometimes, a child may want to be a little closer to his mom, or he might just look at his mom to see what she's doing. \n\nLastly, how a mom acts towards her child can change how much the child wants to be near her. If a mom doesn't let her child sit close to her or threatens to leave, the child might want to be near her even more. This is because the child wants to feel safe. If the mom is ready to be near her child whenever he wants, he will be happy and might even go play a little far away.\n\nSeeing their mom hold another baby can make children want to be close to their mom. The older child might want to sit on his mom's lap or act like a baby. This could be because he feels that his mom is not paying attention to him. But, sometimes, even if the mom is paying attention to the older child, he might still act like this. \n\n_Changes as Kids Get Older_\n\nAs children get older, they don't need to be near their mom as much. They might not show it as often or as strongly. But, they will never stop wanting to be near their mom. This is because they feel safe when they are near their mom. Older children might be okay with just a gentle touch or a nice look from their mom.\n\nWe don't know why children don't need to be near their mom as much when they get older. Learning from things we do and see can help us understand and not be scared of things that were once strange to us. But it's not just learning that makes us grow and change. For example, when we talk about how we behave when we like someone a lot or when we take care of someone, our bodies have special things called hormones that are very important. The same might be true for when we feel very close to someone. We also see that girls may feel this closeness a bit more easily than boys. \n\nAs we grow up, we can feel close to someone in many ways. For example, looking at their picture, reading their letters, or talking to them on the phone can make us feel close to them as long as we are not feeling too strong feelings. \n\nThere are more details about these changes in the last chapters of this book. \n\nThis book is meant to help us understand how we feel close to others and why. It's also meant to encourage more studying. With this kind of model, we can guess how we would behave and check if we're right.\n\nThere are some useful books and studies about how we explore things, how mothers behave, and how babies cry, smile, and talk. \n\nSometimes, babies can start to respond to things when they are as young as fourteen weeks old or as old as thirty-seven weeks old. \n\nMy daughter, Madison, pointed out to me that when we are naked, we might behave differently.\n\nIn a study with little girls aged from three and a half to four and a half years, it was found that, when scared, the girls would stay close to whoever was in the room with them (sometimes their mother, sometimes a stranger). The girls would stay 50% closer when they were scared than when they were not scared. However, they did not ask for attention or help more when they were scared than when they were not scared.\nPart IV\n\nGROWING UP\n\nChapter 14\n\nStarting to Love\n\nWe are born with some ways of behaving, but as we grow, we learn and change.\n\nPhases in learning to love\n\nIN A TYPICAL child, the ways of showing love grow and change in a certain way in the normal family where most children grow up. What do we know about this growth and what affects it?\n\nWhen a baby is born, he is not a blank page. He already has some ways of behaving ready to start, and each way is already set to start by certain things, stop by other things, and get stronger or weaker by yet other things. Some of these ways are the building blocks for learning to love. For example, a newborn baby can cry, suck, hold on, and turn towards things. After a few weeks, he adds smiling and babbling, and a few months later, crawling and walking.\n\nAt first, each of these behaviors is simple. Some of the movements are only a little more complicated than a simple action, and the things that start and stop them are only roughly understood. Even so, there is some understanding from the start; and also from the start, the baby has a strong tendency to respond in special ways to several things that usually come from a person\u2014the sound of a human voice, the sight of a human face, and the touch and movement of human arms and body. From these small beginnings, all the complicated ways of showing love to certain people grow.\n\nIn Chapter 11, a simple picture is given of how a baby learns to show love. For further understanding, it is helpful to divide this learning into several phases, though it must be understood that there are no clear lines between them. In the next paragraphs, four such phases are briefly described; their more complete discussion makes up this and the following chapters.\n\n_Phase 1: Turning and Making Sounds with Limited Understanding of People_\n\nDuring this phase a baby behaves in certain typical ways towards people but his ability to tell one person from another is limited to smells and sounds. The phase lasts from birth to at least eight weeks old, and more usually to about twelve weeks; it may last much longer in difficult conditions.\n\nThe ways a baby behaves towards any person near him include turning towards that person, following movements with his eyes, reaching and grabbing, smiling and babbling. Sometimes, a baby stops crying when they hear a voice or see a face. This kind of behavior can make the baby spend more time with the person. After about twelve weeks, the baby starts to show more friendly actions. Then, the baby starts to show joy and excitement when they see people (Rachel, 1961).\n\n_Phase 2: Looking and Showing Things to One (or More) Special Person (s)_\n\nIn this phase, a baby still likes people, but they start to like their mom more than others. They start to notice sounds around four weeks and can see things around ten weeks. If a baby grows up in a family, they start to show these behaviors from twelve weeks. This phase lasts until about six months, or longer depending on the situation.\n\n_Phase 3: Staying Close to a Special Person by Moving and Showing Things_\n\nIn this phase, a baby starts to treat people differently. They start to follow their mom, say hi when she comes back, and use her as a base to explore. At the same time, they start to be less friendly to other people. Some people become other special people to the baby, but not everyone. Strangers start to make the baby feel scared and they start to avoid them.\n\nIn this phase, the baby starts to show their love to their mom in a way that everyone can see.\n\nPhase 3 usually starts between six and seven months but may start later, especially in babies who have not been around a main person a lot. It probably lasts through the second year and into the third.\n\n_Phase 4: Making a Goal to Stay Close to a Special Person_\n\nIn Phase 3, the baby starts to stay close to a special person. They start to remember where the special person is and try to get to them. But, the baby does not understand why the special person is moving towards or away from them, or what they can do to change the special person's behavior. The baby does not understand that the special person has their own goals, and that they can guess what they are and act accordingly. This is too hard for the baby to understand.\n\nBut, sooner or later, this changes. By watching how his mom acts and what changes her actions, a child begins to understand some of his mom's goals and her plans to reach them. From then on, his idea of the world becomes more detailed and he can change his actions more easily. In other words, a child is starting to understand his mom's feelings and reasons for doing things. Once this happens, the child and mom can start to have a more complex relationship, which I call a partnership.\n\nThis is clearly a new step. Even though we don't have a lot of information yet, what we do have, like from some studies in the early eighties, suggests that for some children this starts to happen around the middle of their third year. We'll talk more about this in chapter 18.\n\nOf course, it's up to us to decide when a child has become attached. Obviously, he's not attached in Phase 1, but clearly he is in Phase 3. Whether and how much a child is attached during Phase 2 depends on how we define attachment.\n\nIn the rest of this chapter and the next ones, we'll try to describe some of the things inside a child and conditions around him that make a baby's actions develop through these phases. As we follow its growth, we'll keep referring to principles we talked about in Chapter 10, namely:\n\n  1. a tendency for the range of things that affect a child to become smaller;\n  2. a tendency for simple ways of acting to become more complicated and to be replaced by more advanced ones;\n  3. a tendency for ways of acting to start by being useless and later to become useful.\n\nBut before we start on this journey, let's take a moment to look at our starting point, namely the actions a baby knows how to do when he's born.\n\nActions a newborn baby knows how to do\n\nA lot of silly things have been written about what a newborn baby knows how to do in his first months of life. Some people have described the baby as though his reactions were completely messy and unformed; others have said that a small baby can think and act like a child in Phase 4. The ability to learn that people have said a baby has ranges from almost none to the same as a three-year-old child.\n\nEven in the sixties, these ideas were wrong. Now, in the early eighties, thanks to a lot of careful study by many child researchers, we know a lot more than we used to. If you want to know more, you can read the big collection of articles put together by Oliver in 1979. A long time ago, Ryan made a guess: 'If we look carefully with better ways, we can always find out that things can feel more than we thought' (long time ago).\n\nTests show that when a baby is born, or soon after, all his senses are working. Not only that, but in a few days he can tell the difference between the smells and voices of different people. By moving his head or sucking more, he shows that he likes the smell and voice of his mom better (Macfarlane long time ago; David and Frank, long time ago). His eyes are not as good, but he can look at a light and follow it for a little bit, and in a few weeks he can see patterns.\n\nHow well a baby can tell the difference between things is found out by seeing if he acts differently when given a choice or when things are changed. By seeing how he acts to different things, we can learn what a baby likes. So, some sounds make him cry while others make him quiet; he pays attention to some things he sees and not so much to others. Some tastes make him suck and look happy, others make him move away and look not happy. By acting differently to different things, a baby can control what he gets to sense, getting more of some things and less of others. Over and over, we find, these built-in likes help him to learn to interact with people.\n\nIn one of the first tests like this, Henry and Thomas (long time ago) let babies hear lots of sounds\u2014some loud, some soft; some from a person, others from toys or dishes. From the first days babies acted very differently to the loud and the soft sounds. They didn't like the loud ones and acted upset, but they looked up calmly, slowly stretched their arms and made happy sounds to the soft ones. From the third week on, the sound of a person's voice got special reactions. When they heard the voice, the baby started to suck and make happy sounds. When the voice stopped the baby started to cry and showed he was not happy.\n\nA lot of work has been done to find out how fast a baby's seeing gets better and, especially, what he likes to look at; for more, see Charlie and others (long time ago). Although a lot of tests have made people think that a baby can't tell a person's face from any other thing before about four months old, Thomas (long time ago) has said this is not right. When you look at what each baby likes (instead of averaging what a lot of babies like), he shows that a like for things that look like faces is found as early as five weeks. In one of their studies, Thomas and Jack showed babies between 2 to 9 months old four pictures\u2014an oval shape, a mixed-up face, a normal face, and a real face in a picture. From the youngest baby, the more a picture looked like a face, the more the baby liked it.\n\nBut, it seems babies can't tell faces apart until they are about fourteen weeks old. From then, a baby living at home can clearly recognize his mom's face and greets her with a bigger and quicker smile than he gives to anyone else.\n\nBecause babies are born ready to focus on certain things, different behaviors are caused by different things around them and they pay more attention to some parts of the world than to others. Not only that but, because what happens after a behavior can change future behaviors, some actions are quickly increased while others are quickly decreased. Changes of both these types can be seen in babies as young as two or three days old and their effects, building up over the first weeks and months of life, can be very big.\n\nPeople used to think that a baby's behavior is mostly changed by whether or not he gets food after he does something. This focus on food as a reward had two bad effects: it caused a lot of guessing and it made people forget about all other rewards, some of which are much more important than food in learning to like people. Even with sucking, where getting food is shown to increase the action, it's not the only thing that can increase the action: as Liam has shown, the shape of what's being sucked is also important.\n\nThe rest of this chapter talks about the different behaviors that help a baby like someone. First, there is the baby's ability to see and how it makes him focus on his mom and get to know her. Second, there is his ability to move, especially his hands and feet, head and mouth, which, when given a chance, tend to keep him in contact with her. Third, his ability to signal, crying and smiling, babbling and moving his arms, which have a big effect on his mom's actions and how she treats him. We focus especially on how these abilities develop during the first months of life, when a baby is still in the first phase of liking someone, the phase of 'focusing and signaling with limited telling apart of people'. Talking about things that are known or thought to influence these developments is saved for a later chapter.\n\nWhen they are very small, babies do not know about people. But, they can see and hear things from people and their bodies know how to react to those things. Often, babies act in ways that make them see and hear more from people. For example, they like to look at shapes that look like faces and listen to voices, especially if the voice is a woman's voice. They also cry when the voice stops. From the start, they like to look at things that move more than things that do not move.\n\nNot only do babies act special towards people, but moms also act special towards their babies. A mom can hold her baby so that he can look at her face. By holding him close to her, she can make him turn towards her more and give him a chance to touch her with his mouth, hands, and feet. The more they do this, the more they want to do it. This is how a mom and a baby start to interact early on.\n\nLet's think more about how a baby looks at things and how this helps him interact with his mom. While being fed, a newborn who is awake and has his eyes open will often look at his mom's face. This is not surprising when we know that a baby likes certain patterns and can only see things clearly that are eight or nine inches from his eyes. Also, once he has looked at something, he tends to follow it with his eyes and head. At first, he does this only sometimes and not very well, but by two or three weeks, he does it more often and better. The face of a mom feeding her baby is in the perfect place to be looked at and followed like this.\n\nBy the time he is four weeks old, a baby's liking to look at a human face more than other things is getting stronger. This is also shown by a person who studied how babies learn to focus their eyes and noticed how much more a face makes them focus than a thing that does not move. It may be that the reason for this is that a face has more lines than any other thing she tried, since another person found that, from three months on, babies tend to look especially at anything that has a lot of lines. Another big reason that gets more important as time goes on is how a face moves and changes. Wolff, a smart person, once said that movement is very important for babies who are two months old.\n\nBabies like to look at human faces. Especially after fourteen weeks, they like to look at their mom's face more than other faces. When they are about eighteen weeks old, they keep looking at their mom even when she is a bit away from them:\n\nThe baby, when away from his mom but able to see her, keeps looking at her. He may look away for a bit, but he keeps looking at her. When held by someone else, he is not ready to play with the adult holding him or to rest in her arms.\n\nAt least four things help the baby to grow this way:\n\n  1. Babies like to look at certain things more than others, especially things that move;\n  2. Babies learn by seeing familiar things and new things;\n  3. Babies like to go to familiar things (and later to move away from new things);\n  4. When a baby does something and something happens after that, the baby will do that thing more if he likes what happened and less if he doesn't like what happened.\n\nUsually, people think that food makes babies do more things. But, there is no proof that food makes babies look more at their mom. Instead, the more a baby looks at his mom, the more likely she is to come closer to him and to do things like talk to him or hug him. This makes the baby look more at his mom.\n\nNot only is it fun for the baby to watch his mom, but it is also fun for him to listen to her. The sound of a female voice can make a three-week-old baby very calm. Hearing a voice can make a baby turn his head and make happy noises. Wolff found out that even on the first day after birth, babies react differently to different sounds:\n\nWhen a sharp clear sound was heard by the quiet baby in a quiet room, he turned his head and eyes to the left and right as if to find where the sound came from... a soft noise made him move more clearly than a loud one.\n\nA recent study showed that by the third day, the baby can already tell his mom's voice apart from others.\n\nAlso, just like with looking and following with their eyes, a baby's listening and following the sound are helped by learning and feedback. When a baby is interested in mom's voice, the mom talks more. The baby then listens more because mom's voice and actions are interesting. This way, both the mom and baby talk and listen more and more to each other.\n\n_Baby Turns and Sucks_\n\nA baby touches other people mainly with their head and mouth, hands and feet.\n\nThe way a baby moves their head to touch mom's nipple has been studied by a man named Patrick (1958). He found two main ways a baby does this.\n\nThe first way is a back-and-forth movement. This movement happens when the baby feels something touch near their mouth. This happens a lot when a baby is hungry. Even though this movement can change in speed and size, it always happens the same way and doesn't change based on where the touch is felt.\n\nThe second way is when the baby turns their head towards where they feel the touch. When the touch is kept in one place for a while and then moved, the baby's head follows. This shows that the movement is caused by touch and that it changes based on where the touch is felt.\n\nThe back-and-forth movement can be seen in babies who are born early at twenty-eight weeks. The head-turning movement develops later. Even when the baby is born at the normal time, only about two-thirds of babies show head-turning. Some babies show both movements at the same time. But for some, there is a gap of one or more days between the back-and-forth movement and the head-turning movement.\n\nBoth movements lead to the same result, which is eating. The steps seem to be (Patrick, 1958):\n\n  1. the baby moves their head so their mouth touches mom's nipple;\n  2. when the baby feels a touch on their lips or nearby, they open their mouth and hold the nipple with their lips;\nWhen a baby feels something in his mouth, he starts to suck;\nWhen there is milk in his mouth, he starts to swallow.\n\nLook at the order: moving head, holding the milk source, sucking\u2014all before getting food. As some smart people say:\n\nThe idea that a baby eats because he is hungry is not right. If you put an empty bottle in a baby's mouth, even right after he is born, the baby tries to eat. This is different from when he is given a little milk that just goes to the back of his mouth.\n\nOnce a baby starts eating, his behavior starts to change and grow. For example, in the first days of life, it has been shown, the strength of a baby's sucking can be made stronger or weaker. Food makes it stronger. So a weird shaped thing that gives food is sucked more than the same thing when it does not give food. But, food is not the only thing that makes sucking stronger: the shape of the thing sucked is also important. When the shape is a normal one, like a rubber milk source, it is sucked more and more even when it gives no food; when the shape is very different from the normal one, like a rubber tube, and still gives no food, it is sucked less and less.\n\nAnother kind of growth that happens in the early days of life is that a baby starts to look towards the breast or bottle before his face and mouth touch it. Some people saw this happen as early as the fourth meal; and by the twelfth it was normal. Once it happens, a baby opens his mouth and moves his free arm up to his mouth and to his mom's coming breast as soon as he is put in a feeding position, which is when his body is touching his mom's but his face is not. Some babies were slow to do this. These were babies who, while being fed, were not touching their moms very much.\n\nAt first, a baby's moves before eating are caused not by seeing the breast or bottle but by the feeling he gets when he is put in the feeding position. Not until his third month are his moves before eating guided by what he sees.\n\nSince the movement of turning the head towards something described by some smart people is especially easy to make happen when a baby is hungry and since it usually brings mouth to milk source, it is clearly a big part of eating. In addition to that, however, turning the head towards something has the effect of making the baby look towards mom even when there is no feeding. This point was made by Benjamin. Benjamin and Matthew (a time in the past) show how well a baby can turn his head when something happens. For example, when something touches his ear and moves towards his mouth, a baby turns his head to meet it; and when something moves the other way, he turns his mouth to follow it. In both cases, the baby ends up facing the thing that touched him.\n\n_Holding, Clinging, and Reaching_\n\nA newborn baby can hold on to things and support his own weight, just like other baby animals can. This is something that people have thought for a while now. Recent research has shown that this is probably true, and has also shown how a baby learns to hold on to things on purpose. Two things that a newborn baby does that help him learn to hold on are the \"Moro\" response and the grasp response.\n\nA long time ago, a doctor named Ethan Moro was the first to talk about the \"Moro\" response. According to Patrick (another time in the past), the \"Moro\" response is 'a very complicated thing that is made up of several parts'; it happens when a baby is suddenly moved, lifted, or dropped. The thing that causes the \"Moro\" response is definitely the baby's sense of balance and might also be the baby's sense of where his body is.\n\nPeople have argued a lot about what the \"Moro\" response really is and what it does. A big part of why people are confused and arguing is because they have been studying the \"Moro\" response in places that are not like where a baby usually is. When the \"Moro\" response is studied in a place that is right for a baby, the problems make more sense and the answer is clear.\n\nUsually, the \"Moro\" response happens when a baby's hands are not holding anything. Then the response usually has two parts, during the first of which the baby moves his arms and fingers outwards, and during the second, the baby moves his arms inwards; meanwhile the baby moves his legs, but not in a regular way. Patrick shows, however, that the \"Moro\" response is very different when it happens while a baby is being held in a way that makes him hold on with his hands and arms. Then, when he is suddenly dropped, he doesn't stretch out but instead, holds on tightly. Patrick thinks that to make the \"Moro\" response happen when the baby's arms are free is not the right way to do it and leads to a strange movement that is hard to understand. Once the \"Moro\" response is thought of as part of how a baby holds on, however, it makes sense. The new ideas, says Patrick, match what we see in young monkeys. When the mommy monkey moves fast, the baby monkey holds on tighter so it doesn't fall. In other words, Moro was right in thinking the baby wants to 'hug' its mommy.\n\nThe way human babies hold on has been looked at by Henry (1937) and by David (1950, 1958). David talks about three different ways babies react, each one a bit more clever than the last.\n\nThe most simple is when a baby curls its hands and feet when it feels like it's falling. The next way is a two-part reaction. First, the baby's hand or foot closes a little when something touches it. Then, the hand or foot closes tightly when the muscles used to close it feel something.\n\nBoth of these ways don't have a direction. But the next way does. This starts a few weeks later. Like before, it has two parts. First, when the baby isn't touching anything anymore, its hand moves around like it's searching. Then, as soon as the hand feels something again, it closes quickly.\n\nLater on, the baby learns even cleverer ways to react. For example, it starts to use its eyes to decide what to grab. It doesn't just grab the first thing that touches its hand. Instead, it can choose what it wants to hold.\n\nThe way babies learn to reach out and grab things while looking at them has been studied by William, Cameron, and Henry (1964). They found that a baby doesn't learn to move its arm and hand based on what it sees until it's two months old. In the second and third month, a baby reaches for a moving toy, tries to hit it, but doesn't try to hold it. By four months, though, the baby's hand is open as it reaches, it looks back and forth between the toy and its hand as the hand gets closer, and then it grabs the toy. At first, the baby isn't very good at this, but a few weeks later, it can reach out and grab the toy quickly and directly.\n\nBy the time the baby is five months old, it can recognize its mommy and probably spends most of its time with her. That means it's likely to reach out and grab parts of her, like her hair. A month or two later, he starts to really stick to her, especially when he's scared or not feeling well. Six months was the earliest time when Adam saw the little ones stick to their mom in GA place, and some didn't do it until they were nine months old. After that, they would stick to their mom when they saw someone they didn't know, especially when mom tried to give them to the stranger.\n\nWhen they looked at their tests on how the little ones learn to reach for things they see, William, Cameron, and Henry found that different parts of the body learn to work together:\n\nThese include the eyes and arms, the eyes and hands, and the touch of the hands. These parts seem to learn at different times... and may not work together at first... but gradually they learn to work together as a big system which uses all their skills.\n\nThe authors think that this learning is helped by a lot of things the little ones do by themselves when they are with their family. An example is when a baby grabs and plays with his two hands: when these movements are watched, seeing and touching are linked 'by a double feedback system. For the eyes see what the hands feel, which is each other, but each hand also touches and is being actively touched.' If a baby didn't have a chance to practice this, it's likely that the usual learning of reaching for things they see would never happen, or would happen late and not very well. This is another example of the general idea that, even though the baby is more likely to learn in certain ways, it won't happen unless the baby is being cared for in the right environment.\n\n_Smiling_\n\nThe smile of a little one is so cute and makes his parents so happy that it is no surprise to find that a lot of people from Darwin (in the late 19th century) onwards have studied it. The many books on this are reviewed briefly by Frank (in the mid 20th century) and looked at in detail by Alice (around the mid 20th century).\n\nIn the past, people thought that a baby learns to smile and that a baby smiles at people because they feed him. But there's no proof for these ideas. Today, the ideas that most people agree with are: (i) that the way a baby smiles is natural; (ii) that, although many things can make a baby smile, the baby is more likely to smile at some things than others; (iii) that in the right environment the things that make a baby smile are more likely to be his mom and other family members than anything else; (iv) that, by learning, the things that make a baby smile are mostly human, especially human voice and face; (v) that, by more learning, a baby smiles quicker and more at a voice (at about four weeks) and a face (at about fourteen weeks) he knows than at others. To these ideas about why a baby smiles we may add (vi) that a baby's smile makes his mom (or other person smiled at) respond in a loving way that makes them spend more time together and makes it more likely that she will act like a mom in the future (see Chapter 13); and (vii) that the reason for a baby's smile is to make his mom spend more time with him and stay close to him.\n\nDuring the first year, a baby's smile changes in four main ways:\n\n(i) First, the baby smiles without a reason. This starts when the baby is born and lasts for about five weeks. At first, the smile is very small and doesn't make people feel happy. During the fourth and fifth weeks, the smile gets bigger and starts to make people feel happy. \n\n(ii) Next, the baby smiles at everyone. The things that make the baby smile are mostly people's voices and faces. The baby's smile makes people want to play with and love the baby. This usually starts by the end of the fifth week.\n\n(iii) Then, the baby starts to smile at only some people. By the fourth week, the baby smiles more at people it knows. About ten weeks later, the baby smiles more at the person who takes care of it than at other people. Until the baby is six or seven months old, it will still smile at new people and even masks, but sometimes it might not want to.\n\n(iv) Lastly, the baby starts to act differently with different people. The baby smiles a lot at people it knows, especially when playing or saying hello. But the baby might act scared, shy, or friendly with people it doesn't know.\n\nThe first kind of smile. We know about this because of the work of a person called William (1963). He watched eight babies for many hours a day, for their first weeks of life, first in the hospital and then at home. He wrote down everything he saw. Another person, Frank (1965), studied twenty pairs of twins with his friend.\n\nJust a few hours after they were born, all eight babies that were watched by William sometimes made faces that looked like they were smiling. But, these smiles were short and their eyes didn't smile too. Sometimes, only one side of their face smiled. These early smiles happened by themselves and could also be made to happen. They usually happened when the babies were sleepy and their eyes were closing. We don't think they were caused by gas, and we think they're best thought of as 'empty actions'. Most babies stop doing these smiles after their first month.\n\nDuring their first two weeks, William says, almost the only time a baby smiles is when it's sleeping but not too deeply. During the second week, a baby can also smile when it's full and awake, but looking blankly into space. In both cases, a quick smile can sometimes be made by gently stroking the baby's cheek or belly, shining a soft light in its eyes, or making a soft sound. But, the smile doesn't always happen, takes a while to appear, and once it happens, it can't be made to happen again for a while. During the first week, all kinds of sounds work equally well, but during the second week, a human voice works better than other sounds, like a bell, a bird whistle, or a rattle.\n\nBecause all smiles during the first two weeks are quick and not complete, they don't really affect people watching. In other words, they don't really do anything.\n\n_Phase of non-selective social smiling_. William found that a new phase usually starts around the fourteenth day and is usually well established by the end of the fifth week. This new phase is marked by two big changes: (a) the baby is alert and bright-eyed when it smiles; (b) its mouth moves more when it smiles and its eyes crinkle. Also, it's now clear that its smile is most easily caused by something human. However, the smile is still slow to appear and doesn't last very long.\n\nDuring the third week, the thing that most often causes this early social smile is sound, and the most effective sound is a human voice, especially a high-pitched one. By the fourth week, William found that a lady's voice can make a baby smile even if the baby is crying or eating. When a baby is crying, a lady's voice can stop the crying and make the baby listen. After the third time the lady speaks, the baby might smile. When a baby is eating, hearing a voice can make him stop eating, smile, and then go back to eating.\n\nFor the first four weeks, seeing things doesn't make a baby smile. Only hearing a voice makes a difference. For example, seeing a head nod can make a voice more effective, but on its own, it doesn't do anything.\n\nDuring the fifth week, the voice doesn't make a baby smile as much. Instead, seeing a face makes a baby smile the most. After that, the baby smiles more when he sees happy faces.\n\nAround the same time, feeling things becomes important too. During the fourth and fifth weeks, William found that the feeling of playing a patting game can suddenly make a baby smile a lot, even if the baby can't see or hear the person playing with him.\n\nBefore a baby smiles at what he sees, he usually spends a few days or a week looking really hard at faces. For the first three weeks, a baby might look at a face, but he doesn't seem to really see it. After about three and a half weeks, it looks different. From then on, William says, the baby seems to really see the person's face and look them in the eyes. It's hard to say what's changed, but the person playing with the baby can tell. Within a few days of William noticing this change, the baby's mom started saying things like 'Now he can see me' or 'Now he is fun to play with'. And she started to spend a lot more time playing with her baby.\n\nDuring the fourth week, the baby is usually looking really hard at things. Some babies might start to smile at what they see. But most babies don't start smiling at what they see until the fifth week. From the start, looking into someone's eyes is really important:\n\nFirst, the baby looks at the person's face, at the hair, mouth, and the rest of the face. Then, as soon as the baby makes eye contact, he smiles. Other babies who did the same thing later all did it the same way. They looked at the rest of the face before looking at the eyes and smiling (William, 1963).\n\nBy the end of the fifth week, almost all babies start to smile and their smiles last longer. They also start making sounds, moving their arms, and kicking their legs. So, the mother sees her baby in a new way.\n\nEven though almost all babies smile a lot during the second and third months, their smiles are still slow, not very big, and don't last very long. But after about fourteen weeks, most babies start smiling more easily, more widely, and for longer.\n\nFrom the time babies start smiling at things they see, the thing that makes them smile the most is a moving human face. And a face makes them smile even more when it is well lit, coming closer to the baby, and when it is also talking and touching the baby. In other words, a baby smiles most and best when he sees a person moving, looking at him, coming closer to him, talking to him, and touching him.\n\nWe are not sure if a baby smiles at things other than a face. Some people say that babies do not smile at their feeding bottle. But others have seen babies smiling at familiar toys\u2014like little balls of wool or plastic\u2014when they are between ten and sixteen weeks old. In his work, Piaget says that the toys are familiar to the baby, and he thinks: 'the smile is mainly a reaction to familiar things, to what has already been seen'. From this idea, he thinks that the reason why the smile is only caused by people is because people 'are the familiar things most likely to come back and be repeated'.\n\nPiaget's idea that familiarity is important is similar to much recent work. But his belief that familiarity is the only thing that makes smiling become limited to people is probably not true. As we have talked about, it seems more likely that a baby is born with certain habits, one of which is to look at a human face more than other things. Another habit seems to be to smile at a human face more easily than anything else, especially at a moving human face.\n\nSince the important work of Kaila and of Spitz and Wolf, many people have tried to find out what it is about a human face that makes it so good at making babies smile. When we think about this work, we need to see the difference between a good enough thing and the best thing. Any thing that can sometimes make a smile can be called good enough, but it may be clear in many ways that it is not the best. In general, a good thing makes a smile that is fast, long, and big; a not so good thing makes a smile that is slow, short, and not very big.\n\nEven though a moving human face soon becomes the best thing to look at, from two to seven months old, babies can sometimes smile at simple drawings of faces. Almost all of these drawings have two dots that look like eyes. This matches what Wolff found, that a baby's sight of another person's eyes helps make them smile. It also matches the finding that a side view of a face doesn't work as well.\n\nIn one set of tests using different masks, Ahrens (1954) found that a two-month-old baby will smile at a pair of black dots on a card the size of a face, and that a model with six dots works better than one with two dots. He also found that even during the third month, a baby will smile at a mask that only has eyes and eyebrows, with no mouth or chin. As the baby gets older, the mask needs to have more and more detail to make the baby smile, until by eight months, only a real human face will do.\n\nEven though these tests show that until he is about seven months old, a baby is not too picky about who he smiles at, it doesn't mean that he can't tell the difference. In fact, Polak _et al_. found that by the end of the third month, a baby can tell a real face from a big colored picture, and that, even though the picture can still make him smile, it's not as good as a real face. His smiles at a human face are quicker, longer, and stronger.\n\nBabies who can't see also smile, and looking at how smiling grows in them can help us understand how it happens in babies who can see (see Freedman (1964) for more info).\n\nIn babies who can't see, the sound of a voice and touch are the main things that make them smile, and a voice alone works pretty well. But, until they are six months old, babies who can't see don't smile like normal. Instead of the long smile of babies who can see, the smiles of babies who can't see are very short, like they are in half-asleep babies during the first weeks of life. Before their smiles get long, at about six months old, babies who can't see go through a time when their smiles are made up of a bunch of quick smiles.\n\nSo in babies who can't see, the human voice, which is the main thing that makes babies who can see smile during the early weeks, continues to be the main thing during later babyhood. But, the voice alone isn't enough to make the long smile seen in babies who can see until the baby who can't see is six months old. This supports the idea, from watching babies who can see, that what keeps a baby who can see smiling after he has reached five weeks old is his ongoing sight of the things that make him smile. For example, a little baby who can see might keep smiling when he looks at someone's face but stop smiling when the person turns their face away.\n\n_The time when babies start to smile more at certain people_. By his fourth week, a baby smiles more often when he hears his mother's voice than any other voice. But with things he sees, he doesn't choose what to smile at for a longer time. Until the end of his third month, a baby smiles just as much when he sees someone he doesn't know as when he sees his mother. Babies in places with lots of other babies don't start to smile more at familiar faces until the end of their fifth month.\n\nOnce a baby starts to know the difference between people he knows and people he doesn't, he smiles less at strangers. For example, when a baby is thirteen weeks old, he might have smiled a lot even at a stranger's still face, but two weeks later he might not smile at it at all. But he still smiles at his mother just as much, and maybe even more. There are many possible reasons for this change. While a baby might start to be scared of strangers during the third and fourth parts of his first year, in the second part it seems unlikely to be the main reason. Instead, the main reasons are probably that the mother smiles or behaves lovingly when she sees her baby smile, or simply that she's there a lot.\n\nThere's good evidence that when a baby's smile is answered with a loving smile, he smiles even more strongly afterwards. In an experiment with eight three-month-old babies, a lady made a baby smile by showing her face to him. Every time the baby smiled she smiled back, made happy noises, picked him up, and cuddled him. After a few times of this, all the babies started to smile more often. But when the lady stopped answering their smiles, they gradually smiled less and less until they stopped. Her results fit well with the idea of learning by rewards. They also fit with many other observations about what makes a baby become attached to a certain person: these are talked about in the next chapter.\n\nWhen a baby smiles a lot of other things happen too. Not only does he look at the person coming towards him but he also turns his head and body, waves his arms and kicks his legs. He also makes babbling noises. This leads to the second of the two strong and typical responses that human babies have and that help them to start communicating with the people around them.\n\n_Babbling_\n\nThe role of babbling in social interaction is quite similar to that of smiling. Both happen when a baby is awake and happy, and both usually make the baby's companion answer in a friendly way and start a back-and-forth interaction with him. Both also start to work as social signals at about the same age, which is five weeks, and, because both are brought on by the same things, both often happen at the same time. The main difference is that smiles and moving hands are things you see, but babbling is something you hear.\n\nWhen a baby first makes little sounds, which he does when he is about four weeks old, he does this mostly because he hears a voice. This also makes him smile. For about a week, a voice makes both babbling and smiling, but then it stops making so much smiling and mostly makes babbling. This works very well. From about six weeks old, it's possible to have a back-and-forth of sounds with the baby. Even at that age, a mother's voice works better than others.\n\nBut babbling also happens when the baby sees something. As soon as a baby starts to smile at a moving human face, he also babbles at it, though not as much as he smiles. When he sees a moving face and hears a voice, he babbles the most.\n\nSo babbling, like smiling, usually happens more when people are around. But it can also happen in other situations. A three-month-old baby might smile and make sounds when he sees and hears a rattle, but a five-month-old baby won't. This is probably because a rattle doesn't react to the baby's smiles and sounds, unlike people.\n\nJust like a baby's smile can be made more by responding to it every time with a smile, little sounds, and picking him up, other people have also made babies babble more by responding in similar ways. They did this with twenty-one babies who were three months old. The person made the baby babble by leaning over the baby and looking at him with a blank face for three minutes. On the first two days, the person did not react to the babbling. On the third and fourth days, she reacted each time the baby made a sound: she smiled big, made three 'tsk' sounds, and lightly squeezed the baby's belly. On the fifth and sixth days, she didn't react again. The results were clear. When the babies' sounds were reacted to, the babies made more sounds: on the second of the two days with reactions, the sounds had almost doubled. When the babies' sounds were not reacted to, they made fewer sounds.\n\nIt's not known if a baby's babbling can be made more by other things, and if so, what kind. But making a doorbell sound every time a baby babbled didn't make any more babbling.\n\nThe results we have show that little sounds and smiles from babies are ways they connect with their mom or caregiver. This helps keep them close and encourages talking and playing.\n\nBabies usually start to make more sounds when they're with their mom or caregiver than with others. Some people noticed this when babies were only five or six weeks old. Another person didn't notice it until the babies were twenty weeks old.\n\nBy the fourth month, a baby can make many different sounds. They start to use some sounds more than others, and in the second half of their first year, they start to copy the way people around them talk. This seems to be because babies like to copy the sounds people make and because people like to encourage the sounds the baby makes.\n\n_Crying_\n\nWhile smiles and sounds from a baby are usually enjoyed by their caregivers, crying is not. Caregivers usually try to stop the baby from crying and try to make sure it doesn't happen often. When a baby is crying, caregivers often try to make it stop and prevent it from happening again.\n\nIn the previous section, we mentioned that there are different types of crying. Each type has its own sound and cause, and each affects caregivers in different ways. Usually, a mom will try to stop the crying right away, like when she hears a sudden cry of pain, or when the baby starts crying slowly and rhythmically. A baby's cry is hard to ignore. This is because each baby's cry sounds different, so it's hard to get used to it.\n\nEvery mom knows that each baby cries in their own special way. Even the way a baby cries can help identify them, just like fingerprints can. Moms usually learn to recognize their own baby's cry. In a group of twenty-three moms, half could recognize their baby's cry within forty-eight hours of the baby being born. After that, none of them made a mistake. From then on, they choose carefully, taking care of their own baby but not necessarily others.\n\nBabies have two types of cries that we know about\u2014crying because they're hungry, which starts slowly and has a pattern, and crying because they're hurt, which starts all of a sudden and doesn't have a pattern. A third kind of crying sounds like a donkey and is usually because the baby is angry. A fourth kind of crying is only by babies with a hurt brain and Wolff says it is not nice to hear and makes people upset and want to go away from it.\n\nThe most common cry of a young baby has a pattern, but it can be because of many things other than hunger. It might, for example, start all of a sudden, because of something outside the baby; or it might start with fussing and build up slowly, because of something changing inside the baby or because the baby is cold.\n\nThe things outside the baby that make them cry in a pattern include sudden noises, and quick changes of light and how the baby is sitting. They also include being naked: Wolff says that, especially during the second, third, and fourth weeks of life, many babies start crying as soon as their clothes are taken off and stop as soon as they are dressed again or covered with a heavy blanket.\n\nBabies that are hungry or cold are likely to tell us by crying in a pattern that slowly builds up and that stops when they are fed or warmed. But some babies that have been recently fed and are kept warm also cry in a pattern. The reasons for this kind of crying, which is common, are a little hard to understand.\n\nThere are several ways a mother knows why her baby is crying. If it's pain, the kind of crying might give a clue. If it's something outside the baby, she might have seen what happened. If it's hunger or cold, the situation might give a hint, and giving food or warmth can test if she's right. If it's none of these things, a mother might be confused.\n\nThe interesting thing about crying that's not because of the things we've talked about so far is that it usually stops with things that, in a normal place, are almost always because of people. These things include sounds, especially the sound of a person's voice, and the feelings that come from sucking on something that's not food and from being rocked. Let's think about what we know about how each of these things from people can stop a baby's crying.\n\nDuring his study of the early social responses of fourteen infants cared for in their own families in BO city, Wolff made many observations on crying and carried out many experiments (Wolff, 1969). He says that when a baby is born, different _sounds_ can stop the baby from crying. In the first week, a rattle or a bell sound works as well as a person's voice, maybe even better. But this changes quickly. It might be because the baby can hear the bell or rattle sound over their own crying. But, in the second week, a person's voice works best to stop the crying, and in the third week, a woman's voice works better than a man's. After a few more weeks, the baby likes the mother's voice the most\u2014it can make the baby stop crying and even smile.\n\nMost moms know that _sucking_ can make a baby quiet. In WE countries, they use rubber comforters for this. One big study in MI place (NE and NE, 1963) showed that half the moms who were good moms gave their baby a dummy\u2014no bad stuff happened. In less developed countries, a mom usually gives a crying baby her breast, even if there's no milk.\n\nPeople have studied how _non-food sucking_ can quiet a baby. KE and LE (1963) watched thirty babies who were between one and three days old. They wanted to see how well a short time of sucking a rubber dummy worked to quiet a baby compared to being gently touched on the forehead. They looked at how much the baby moved and how much the baby cried. The results were clear. After half a minute of sucking, a baby moved half as much and cried four-fifths less. After the same time being touched, a baby moved and cried a little more. The people doing the study said that maybe the baby was quiet because before the baby had gotten some food by sucking. But WO (1969) says this is probably not true. Babies who can't eat through their mouth still stop crying when they can suck something.\n\nWO ( _same one_) also says that having a comforter in the mouth works even when it's not being sucked. He says that if a baby falls asleep sucking a comforter and isn't in a deep sleep, taking the comforter away might make the baby wake up and cry.\n\nIt's been known for a long time that rocking a baby often helps to calm him down. But in recent times, people have focused more on feeding the baby, and have forgotten about the benefits of rocking. So, let's think about what we've learned from looking after babies in their first three months in two different places.\n\nThe first story is from a doctor in the UK:\n\nA big reason why babies cry is because they are lonely or want to be held. It seems like this is why they cry, because the crying usually stops when the baby is picked up and cuddled. It's surprising how many mums don't realize that babies want and need cuddling, and make the mistake of thinking that all crying is because the baby is hungry. The main difference between crying from hunger and crying from loneliness is that picking up the baby doesn't stop the crying if the baby is hungry or uncomfortable (Doctor, 1955).\n\nThe second story is about mums in a far-off place in Africa:\n\nMums know that sometimes in the first three months, the baby cries in a way that can't be stopped by feeding... Most of the time at night... the mum turns on a light, ties the baby to her back and walks around in the house, bouncing him up and down. With his face pressed against her back, the baby often stops crying when he is jostled like this. During the day, older kids also use bouncing, either on the back or in the arms, to calm down a little baby who cries but doesn't want food (People, 1963).\n\nA few years ago, Adam (1969 and personal talk) started to study what things help in these situations. He watched one baby, who was five days old, every afternoon, starting after the baby had been fed and changed. Each baby lies in his bed, which is on a machine that can rock and measure the rocking. The machine is still at first, and the baby is watched for about an hour while his behavior and body reactions are recorded.\n\nIn these situations, a baby might lie quietly, awake or asleep, without crying the whole time. But sometimes, he starts to cry, usually for no clear reason. Sometimes the crying stops soon after it starts; other times it keeps going. When crying goes on for as long as two minutes, the baby is rocked. The rocking is done at different speeds to see if some speeds are better at stopping the crying than others.\n\nThe first results show that in these situations, every baby stops crying when he is rocked. The rocking is up and down, about three inches. Rocking at slow speeds, like thirty times a minute, doesn't stop the crying. When we move something back and forth very fast, like fifty times in a minute, it can help to stop crying. If we move it even faster, like sixty times in a minute, every baby stops crying and they usually stay quiet. Their hearts also beat slower, they breathe normally, and they feel relaxed. Some babies need to be moved seventy times in a minute to stop crying. Moving less than fifty times is not very helpful. Rocking a baby every day is a good way to keep them from crying.\n\nAdam tried some other things to stop babies from crying. He found that giving a baby something to suck on, like a pacifier, can also help to make them quiet, but rocking is better. When we rock a baby, their heart beats slower, almost like when they are resting. But when they are sucking on something, even if they stop crying, their heart still beats faster than when they are resting.\n\nSo, if a baby is not hungry, cold, or in pain, the best ways to stop them from crying are, in this order, talking to them, giving them something to suck on, and rocking them. This is why people say that babies cry when they are lonely and want to be held. They stop crying and feel happy when they are rocked and talked to, especially by their mommy.\n\nIt's really interesting that rocking a baby in a certain way always seems to work to stop them from crying. The speed that works best, sixty times a minute, is like the slowest speed that a grown-up walks. So when a baby is carried by their mommy, they are moved at this speed and they don't cry, unless they are hungry or in pain. This might be because of how people have changed over a very long time.\n\nSo, rocking a baby is as good as feeding them to stop them from crying. When a baby is hungry, feeding helps; when he is not hungry, rocking him helps. Neither works for long if the baby doesn't need it.\n\nRocking a baby not only stops crying but also delays it. This was shown by a test done by two people. In a hospital, babies from a few hours to ten days old are put in a room for an hour every afternoon. Since they have just eaten, most are quiet. For eighteen days, one of the quiet babies was chosen to be rocked for half an hour. Then, for another half hour, someone stayed in the room to see if any of the quiet babies started to cry. The results showed that the baby who had been rocked was less likely to cry than the babies who had not been rocked.\n\nAs a baby grows, what makes them cry and stop crying changes. What a baby can see becomes important. Around the fifth week, many babies start crying when a person they are looking at leaves their view, and they stop crying each time the person comes back. At this age and for a few months after, it doesn't matter who leaves and comes back; even a pet leaving and coming back can make them cry or stop crying. But from about five months, who comes and goes matters a lot.\n\nA report about Ganda babies tells that, from about five months, a baby often starts crying when his mother leaves the room even though there is someone else with him. After about nine months, he often cries less because he can follow his mother better. How much a baby cries when his mother leaves changes depending on the baby and the situation. For example, how a one-year-old behaves when his mother leaves the room depends a lot on how she leaves. If she leaves quietly, the baby is likely to not cry much; if she leaves quickly, the baby is likely to cry loudly.\n\nNear the end of the first year, babies become more aware of and scared by unknown faces and situations. From then on, unfamiliar things often make a baby cry and look for his mother. Because this is closely related to how a baby forms attachments, fear of unknown faces and places is talked about more in the next part.\n\nAround the same age that a baby starts to cry when he sees a stranger, he may also start crying when he thinks something bad is going to happen. For example, at a doctor's office, a baby may cry when he sees the doctor getting ready to give him a shot like he got a few weeks before. Before they are one year old, very few babies act in this way. However, when they reach eleven or twelve months old, a quarter of them start to. This behavior is part of the child's growing understanding of the world around them.\n\nNature and care\n\nThe way a child behaves is shaped by both nature and care. As long as the child's surroundings are okay, it seems like the differences in behavior between children are mostly because of their genes. But when their surroundings change a lot, we can clearly see the effects.\n\nOne example is how boys and girls pay attention to things differently. Some people studied babies who were 24 weeks old and found that girl babies liked looking at faces more than non-facial things. Boy babies didn't have this preference.\n\nThere's also evidence that genes affect when babies first start to turn towards and smile at people. A study of identical and fraternal twins found that identical twins start doing these things at closer ages than fraternal twins. Since all the twins in this study lived in the same family, their surroundings were very similar.\n\nBut when children's surroundings are more different, we can see how this affects their development. Many studies have looked at children who live in families versus children who live in institutions. For example, one study found that babies who live in families start to smile earlier than babies who live in institutions. Another study found that babies in institutions babble less than babies in families. As time goes on, babies in institutions start to behave more and more differently from babies in families. They are slower to recognize faces and to try to interact with people. Even when they are one year old, they don't seem to have formed a strong bond with any particular person. This is especially noticeable when they are upset: they rarely turn to an adult for comfort.\n\nThere's been a lot of discussion about why institutions have these effects. Some people think it's because the children there get less stimulation. Others think it's because the children don't have a mother figure. Adam (a smart man from old times) once said that a baby's mom is the biggest source of new things for the baby in the early days of life. Besides giving new things, a mom also lets her baby explore the world with his eyes and hands. This was first said by Patrick (another smart man from old times) and is proven by new studies by William and Henry. A baby who grows up in a place with few things to explore will miss a lot\u2014like new things to see, new things to learn, and new things to do on his own.\n\nWe should always remember that where a baby grows up can make a big difference in how he grows. We'll talk more about this in Chapter 16.\n\nHenry and Thomas think that a baby likes a woman's voice at three weeks because he links it with food. But this isn't necessary. And it's not true because, at the same age, noises from making a bottle don't make the baby react differently.\n\nNew studies, especially those by Kevin and Katherine, Benjamin and friends, Samuel, Sophia, and Sophia, show that a healthy newborn baby can start simple social interaction and a good mom can do it well. By two or three weeks after birth, a baby has times of lively social interaction and times of rest. At first, a baby starts and stops interaction on his own, while a good mom adjusts her behavior to match his. Later, the baby adjusts his behavior to match his mom's. These interactions develop quickly and are enjoyable, which shows that both the baby and mom are ready for them. For a good review of these studies, see Sophia (from a few years ago).\n\nThe same series of events is described by Ryan (from old times). The change, as Benjamin says, may signal the start of a new control system in the brain.\n_Chapter 15_\n\nLooking at a Figure\n\n'Ah', said the Cat, 'what does the Baby like?'\n\n'He likes things that are soft and tickle,' said the Bat. 'He likes warm things to hold when he goes to sleep. He likes to play. He likes all these things.'\n\n_From a famous story_ \u2014ROBERT KENNEDY\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the last story, we talked about how little ones start to notice people and things around them. In this story, we will talk about two more ways little ones learn about their world. When little ones are growing up in a regular family, they usually learn these things:\n\nStep 2\u2014'Noticing and reacting to one (or more) special person (s)';\n\nStep 3\u2014'Trying to stay close to the special person by moving and making sounds'.\n\nWe will talk about Step 4, 'Making a plan to stay with the special person', in future stories.\n\nTo learn about Step 2, we look at what some babies do. These babies are from different places like BO city and WA city, and some are from the GA people. To learn about Step 3, we look at what some other babies do. These babies are also from the GA people and from some babies in GL city.\n\nIt's good that we can see what babies do in different places, like in the countryside of Africa and in the city of Scotland. This helps us know what all babies might do. But it's hard to compare because different people look for different things. Some people only look at whether the baby cries when someone leaves. Other people look at more things, like whether the baby is happy to see someone or uses someone as a safe place to start exploring.\n\nHow babies act differently\n\nAs we've said before, as babies grow, they start to react only to certain things. This is especially true when babies are friendly or crying.\n\nA baby can tell who their mom is by her smell and voice. They react more to their mom than to other people. They might suck more when they hear her voice. This happens very fast in the first few days of life. By the fifth week, some babies smile more when they hear their mom's voice than when they hear their dad's voice or someone else's (Wolff, 1963). Yarrow (1967) also saw that some babies acted differently towards their mom than a stranger at the end of the first month, but not all babies did this. Yarrow found that 20 per cent of babies at one month old liked their mom more. By three months 80 per cent did, and by five months all the babies did so.\n\nAlice (a smart person from a long time ago) talks about many different ways a baby behaves in their first year. Babies start showing these behaviors mostly towards one person. Here is a short version of what Alice said. She says that if we look carefully, we could see these behaviors a few weeks or even months earlier than she saw them. Since babies are all different, and things can change based on what's happening around them, we can only guess when these behaviors first start.\n\n_Talking Sounds_\n\nThe baby makes more sounds when they are with their mom than with other people. William (another smart person from a long time ago) noticed this when the baby was five or six weeks old.\n\n_Stops Crying When Mom Holds_\n\nThe baby keeps crying when someone else holds them, but stops when their mom does. Alice saw this in a baby who was nine weeks old.\n\n_Cries When Mom Leaves_\n\nThe baby starts crying right away when their mom leaves the room, but not when other people leave. Alice saw this in a baby who was fifteen weeks old.\n\n_Smiles More at Mom_\n\nThe baby smiles more often, more quickly, and bigger smiles at their mom than at anyone else. Alice saw this in a baby who was ten weeks old. In London, Ambrose (another smart person) found that babies smiled most at strangers when they were about thirteen weeks old, but after that they mostly smiled at their mom.\n\n_Watches Mom More_\n\nWhen someone else is holding the baby, they keep looking at their mom and seem to want to go to her. Alice saw this in a baby who was eighteen weeks old.\n\n_Says Hi to Mom in Special Way_\n\nThe baby says hi to their mom in certain ways when they see her after she's been gone. At first, saying hi means smiling, making sounds, and moving around a lot; later it also means lifting their arms. Alice saw a baby doing all of this when they were twenty-one weeks old, but she thinks some parts of it could have been seen a few weeks earlier. As soon as a baby can crawl, they also crawl towards their mom to say hi.\n\nThere are two other ways babies say hi that are pretty common, but they seem to depend on where the baby is from. Babies like to clap their hands. This was often seen in GA babies after about thirty weeks. But, it was not seen in a group of white AM country babies. Babies also like to give kisses and hugs. This was not seen in the GA babies, but was seen in babies from Western cultures in their first year.\n\n_Different Ways They Act_\n\nOne way we can tell is if a baby crawls towards their mom when she is in the room with other people. This sometimes happens when the mom comes back into the room and the baby is happy to see her. This was seen in one baby who was twenty-eight weeks old.\n\n_Different Ways They Follow_\n\nAnother way is if the baby tries to follow their mom when she leaves the room. They do not try to follow other people. Babies started to do this as soon as they could crawl. This was seen in most of the GA babies at about twenty-four weeks. Younger babies would cry and follow. After about nine months, they often followed without crying if their mom did not move too quickly.\n\n_Different Ways They Climb and Explore_\n\nAnother way is if a baby climbs over their mom and plays with her face, hair, or clothes. They do this less with other people. This was first seen in a baby who was twenty-two weeks old.\n\n_Different Ways They Hide Their Face_\n\nAnother way is if a baby hides their face in their mom's lap or somewhere on her body. This only happens with their mom and not with anyone else. It was seen in one baby who was twenty-eight weeks old and in others a few weeks older.\n\n_How They Use Their Mom to Explore_\n\nAnother way is if a baby leaves their mom to explore and then comes back to her. They do not do this as much with other people. It was seen in one baby who was twenty-eight weeks old and was common at eight months.\n\n_How They Run to Their Mom for Safety_\n\nAnother way is if a baby is scared, they move as fast as they can away from what scared them and towards their mom. They do not do this towards other people. This was seen in babies at about eight months. In a study, about half the babies as young as three months looked towards their mom when they were upset, hoping to be comforted.\n\n_Different Ways They Cling_\n\nBabies cling to their mom especially when they are scared, tired, hungry, or not feeling well. Even though it was not studied specially, it was reported to be very common during the last part of the first year.\n\nTo sum up these and other findings: it can be said that before sixteen weeks babies do not show many different responses and are only seen when watching very closely. Between sixteen and twenty-six weeks, babies show more and more different responses. And, in most families with babies of six months and over, they are easy for everyone to see.\n\nPeople kids like\n\nSo far, we've talked like a kid only likes one person a lot, maybe their mom or someone like a mom. But this can be confusing. Here are some questions we need to answer:\n\n  1. Do kids usually like more than one person a lot?\n  2. If they do, do they start liking all these people at the same time, or do they like one person first and then others?\n  3. If a kid likes more than one person, do they treat all these people the same or do they like one person more than the others?\n  4. Can someone other than a kid's real mom be the person the kid likes the most?\n\nThe answers to these questions are all related. So, before we talk about each one, here's a quick answer: from very early on, many kids like more than one person a lot; they don't treat all these people the same; and a kid's real mom doesn't have to be the person they like the most.\n\n_Main and Other Liked People_\n\nIn their second year, most babies start to like more than one person, and sometimes several people. Some babies start to like more than one person as soon as they can tell people apart, but most probably do this a bit later.\n\nA study of fifty-eight Scottish babies showed that 17 (29 per cent) started to like more than one person from the time they started showing they liked anyone. Four months later, half the babies liked more than one person, and some liked as many as five or more different people. By the time these babies were eighteen months old, the number who only liked one person had fallen to 13 per cent. This means that it's quite rare for an eighteen-month-old to only like one person. Another study of Ganda babies showed a similar result: almost all were showing they liked more than one person by nine or ten months old.\n\nBut, even though by twelve months most babies probably like more than one person, they don't treat all these people the same. In both the Scottish and Ganda babies, there were clear differences. For the Scottish babies, a scale was made to measure how much a baby didn't like being left by each person. The results showed that most babies didn't like being left by one person more than others, and could be arranged in order from most liked to least liked. Alice found that GA kids often liked one special person the most. Until they were about nine months old, if a child had more than one person they liked, they still only followed one person. Also, when a child was hungry, tired, or sick, they usually went to that one person. But when the child was feeling good, they would play with other people. This might be an older kid who liked to play with them.\n\nThese things show that from a young age, different people might make a child act differently. So, it might be confusing to call all these people \"liked people\" and to call all the behavior \"liking behavior\". In future studies, we will need to pay more attention to these differences. How a child goes to a friend and how they go to a \"liked person\" as defined here might be very different. This is a question that we will think about more later. For now, let's remember Alice's conclusion:\n\nI have seen nothing that says a baby will not like one person,... even if there are many people who can take care of them (Alice, 1964).\n\n_The Main Liked Person_\n\nIt is clear that who a child picks as their main liked person, and who else they like, depends a lot on who takes care of them and who else is in their home. Usually, the people in question are most likely to be his real mom, dad, older brothers and sisters, and maybe grandparents. It is from these people that a child is most likely to pick both his main liked person and his other liked people.\n\nIn both the SC study and the GA study, only children who were living with their real mother were picked for watching. In these situations, it is not surprising that in almost all cases a child's main liked person was his real mother. There were, however, a few exceptions. Two GA children of about nine months, one a boy and one a girl, were said to like both mother and father but like father more, even when the boy was tired or sick. A third GA child, a girl, showed no liking to her mother even at twelve months, but instead liked her father and a half-sister.\n\nAmongst the SC infants, mother was almost always the main liked person during the first year of life, but in some cases shared the role, usually with father, during the second year. There were, however, three out of fifty-eight SC infants whose first liked person was said to have been someone other than mother: two chose father and a third, whose mother was at work all day, chose grandmother who took care of him most of the day. Sometimes, it is hard to understand certain things because of the way they were studied and explained by people like Samuel and Ethan.\n\nWe have seen many times that even though usually a child's real mom is the one he likes the most, other people can also play this role well. As long as a person acts like a mom towards a child, the child will treat her just like his real mom. What does it mean to act like a mom? We will talk about this later. But, in short, it means to play and interact with the child, and respond quickly when the child needs something.\n\nEven though a person who is not the real mom can act like a mom to a child, and many people do, it might be harder for this person than for the real mom. For example, we know from other animals that certain things that happen after a baby is born and things that the newborn baby does can make a mom act like a mom. If this is also true for humans, then a person who is not the real mom might have a harder time acting like a mom. This person might not have the same feelings as a real mom, and she might not spend much time with the baby until he is already a few weeks or months old. Because of these things, this person might not act like a mom as strongly or as often as a real mom.\n\n_Other People_\n\nWe have already said that we might need to be more careful when we talk about people who a child likes and people who a child plays with. A child looks for the person he likes when he is tired, hungry, sick, scared, or doesn't know where this person is. When he finds this person, he wants to stay close to him or her and might want to be held or cuddled. On the other hand, a child looks for a playmate when he is happy and knows where the person he likes is. When he finds a playmate, he wants to play with him or her.\n\nIf we think about it this way, the roles of a person who a child likes and a playmate are different. But, these two roles can be done by the same person at different times. For example, a child's mom can sometimes play with him and sometimes be the person he likes the most. And another person, like an older child, who usually plays with him can sometimes also be a person he likes.\n\nSadly, the two first studies that we are using for our information do not make these differences clear. So, it is hard to know if the people they call 'other people who a child likes' should always be called this. In this story about their discoveries, all these other people are just called 'other people', because some are mainly friends, others are mainly playmates, and a few are both.\n\nFor both the Ganda and the Scottish kids, the most common other people were dad and older brothers and sisters. Others included a grandparent or other people living in the house, and sometimes a neighbor. Both studies agree that each of these additional liked people is clearly different from those not liked. Adam (a scientist) notes that 'the way kids choose who they like among familiar people is very surprising'; for example, one brother or sister may always be greeted happily, others are not.\n\nOf course, for each child both the number and the names of these additional people change over time. Samuel and Ethan (two scientists) write about how, for a particular child, there might be a sudden increase in the number of additional people and later perhaps a decrease. Usually, but not always, such changes show clearly who happened to be at home at the time.\n\nIt is not sure whether social behavior starts to be directed towards other people at the same time as it is first directed towards a main friend or whether it is directed towards other people a little later. Using as their guide protest at being left, Samuel and Ethan present their findings as supporting the first view. Adam, on the other hand, believes that the direction of friend behavior towards other people happens a little later than it does to a main friend. Neither of these studies, however, used methods good enough to solve the issue.\n\nWhen a child has more than one friend it might be thought that his friendship to his main friend would be weak, and, conversely, that when he has only one friend his friendship to that one would be very strong. This, however, is not so: indeed, exactly the opposite is reported for both the Scots kids and the Ganda. In the case of the Scots, the kid who starts by showing a strong friendship to a main friend is reported as much more likely to direct his social behavior to other people as well, whereas a kid who is weakly attached is more likely to keep all his social behavior to a single person. Adam notes the same thing in the Ganda kids. She thinks that the more unsure a child's friendship to his main friend is the more scared is he likely to be in developing friendships to other people. Another explanation that can be given, either as an addition to Adam's or as an alternative to it, is that the more unsure a child the more scared is he in developing play relations with other people.\n\nWhatever the true explanation of the connection may turn out to be, one thing seems clear: it is wrong to think that a young child spreads his friendship over many people in such a way that he gets along with no strong friendship to anyone, and therefore without missing any particular person when that person is away. On the contrary, both the older evidence and that more recently available (Robert, 1981, Adam, 1982) supports a theory suggested in an earlier paper (Benjamin, 1958), namely that there is a strong tendency for friendship behavior to become directed mainly towards one particular person. People have noticed that young children in a place where they live and learn together, like to stick close to a certain teacher. For example:\n\nBella (2\u20132  years) loved Teacher Jessica very much. When Jessica was not there for a few days and came back, Bella kept saying: 'My Jessica, my Jessica'. Lily (2  years) once said 'my Jessica' too, but Bella said: 'It's my Jessica, it's Lily's Rachel and Kevin's very own Isabel.'\n\nI believe this special liking for one person deserves a special word. In the past, I called it 'liking one person most'.\n\n_Things that are not Alive_\n\nSo far, we have talked about people that children may like a lot. But sometimes, children also like things that are not alive very much. For example, they may like to suck on things or hold things tight.\n\nIt is also very common for children to suck on a bottle for food. But since eating is different from liking someone or something a lot, this is not what this book is about.\n\nIn very simple places, a baby may be with his mother almost all the time. Then, he may like to suck on things or hold his mother tight. But in other places, including our place, a baby may like to suck on a toy or his thumb, or he may like a certain cloth, blanket, or soft toy very much. He wants to take it to bed with him, and he may want it with him at other times too, especially if he is upset or tired. Often, these soft things are sucked as well as held tight, but not always.\n\nMore than one person has collected stories about these special things from parents. These show that in our place right now, a lot of children have such special things. Of twenty-eight children aged one and a half years, two people found that eleven, over a third, liked a special soft toy very much. Also, a third liked to suck their thumb. It's interesting that almost all the kids who had soft toys and who sucked their thumb also liked being hugged by their moms a lot.\n\nWhile thumb sucking usually starts very early, having a favorite soft toy doesn't usually start until about nine months old or even later. In a group of forty-three kids who had a favorite toy, nine started loving it before they were one year old, twenty-two started between their first and second birthdays, and twelve started after their second birthday.\n\nBoys and girls are the same in this.\n\nMoms know that the favorite toy is very important for their child's happiness. If the toy is there, the child is happy to go to bed and leave their mom. But if the toy is lost, the child may be very sad until it is found. Sometimes, a child may have more than one favorite toy. For example, Matthew, the oldest of three kids, always had his mom's full attention:\n\nMatthew sucked his thumb until he was four and a half, especially when he was stressed or at night. Before he was fourteen months old, he would pull up his blanket with his left hand, suck his right thumb, and wrap the blanket around his left hand. Then, he would hit his forehead with his wrapped up hand until he fell asleep. His blanket was called his 'cloak' and went with him everywhere\u2014 to bed, on trips, and so on. From the age of three, he also had a wooden squirrel, which he would wrap in his 'cloak' at night and put under him.\n\nThere's no reason to think that having a favorite toy is bad for a kid. In fact, there's a lot of evidence that it can go along with having good relationships with people. If a kid doesn't like soft toys, that might be a reason to worry. For example, some babies who were taken care of in a place where they didn't get much attention didn't have a favorite toy. Some babies even don't like soft toys, and that might mean that something is wrong with their social development. Thomas, for example, didn't like soft toys from a very early age. He was not liked by his mom and was left by her later, and it seemed like his dislike for soft toys might be because he didn't like his mom.\n\nSometimes, little kids like to hold onto soft toys or blankets. This doesn't mean they don't like people. In fact, many kids keep their favorite toy or blanket even when they start going to school. Some people might think this means the kid is not feeling safe, but we don't know that for sure. It's different if a kid likes a toy or blanket more than people, though. Here are some examples:\n\nAdam's mom told me that if Adam fell down, he would ask for 'Say', his cloth, instead of asking her for help. Two moms told me that when their sons woke up after getting better from being sick, the first thing they asked for were their objects.\n\nOne of these kids was Matthew who, when he was six, had to get his throat checked. When he woke up, he asked for 'Squirrel', his toy, and after getting it, he slept peacefully.\n\nMaybe a kid could like a toy or blanket more than people. If this lasts for a long time, it might not be good for the kid's feelings. This idea is supported by people who watched monkeys who only liked a fake monkey more than real monkeys. When these monkeys were later put with other monkeys, they didn't know how to act.\n\nSome people have talked about why kids might like toys or blankets. One person said these are 'transition objects'. He thought these items have a special role in how kids learn to relate to things and people. He thought these objects belong to a phase when a baby is just starting to understand symbols. Even though many people use this term now, not everyone agrees with the idea behind it.\n\nA simpler way to look at these items is to see them as substitutes for something else. For example, instead of sucking on mom's body, a baby might suck on a pacifier; and instead of holding onto mom's body, hair, or clothes, a kid might hold onto a blanket or soft toy. We can guess that these objects mean as much to the kid as the most important person in their life does\u2014at first, they're just something that makes the kid feel good, then they're something the kid can recognize and expect, and finally, they're something that lasts over time and space. Until we know more, there's no reason to think that these so-called transition objects play a special role in a kid's growth, whether it's mental or something else, so a simpler name for them might be 'substitute objects'.\n\nThis simpler theory is supported by studies and by watching baby monkeys who grew up away from their mothers. Just like human babies, monkey and ape babies quickly learn to drink from a bottle and like to suck on a pacifier or thumb. They might suck on other parts of their body, like their toes or even their own nipple or other parts. Baby monkeys like to cling to a soft doll that looks like a monkey mommy.\n\nWhen a human takes care of them, monkeys and apes think of that person as their mommy and hold on to her really tightly. Sometimes, they can be tricked into holding a piece of cloth instead. This is what happened with a baby chimpanzee named Victoria, who was raised by a human. Victoria loved a towel and would carry it everywhere. If she couldn't find her towel, she would get very upset and grab onto her human mommy's skirt until she got a new towel.\n\nThere are many other stories like this of baby monkeys and apes who were raised in different ways.\n\nSo, it seems that whether it's human babies or monkey babies, if they can't have their real mommy, they will find something else to hold on to. Even if it's not alive, like a towel, it can be very important to them, especially when they are tired, sick, or upset.\n\nThe last part is about how babies choose who or what to get attached to. There are four ways they do this. \n\n  1. They are born with a liking to look at and listen to certain things more than others, which makes a very young baby pay special attention to the people taking care of him;\n  2. They learn about who is taking care of them and can tell that person apart from all other people and things;\n  3. They are born with a liking to go towards what is familiar, which makes a baby, as soon as he can move, to approach such familiar person or thing that he has learned to know.\n\nThere is a fourth way of learning that makes you do something more if you get a good result from it. This is like when a baby does something and people around the baby respond in a good way, the baby will do it more. \n\nPeople used to think that a baby loves someone because that person feeds the baby and takes care of the baby's needs. But, now, there is a lot of proof that a baby will love someone more if that person responds well to the baby's actions. \n\nSome people watched babies in Scotland and in GA country and found out the same thing. They wanted to know why some babies love their moms a lot and why some babies don't love their moms that much. They found out that it doesn't matter how the baby is fed, or if the baby is a boy or a girl, or if the baby is the first or second child in the family. What matters is if the mom responds to the baby when the baby cries and if the mom plays with the baby a lot. \n\nFor example, some moms who respond quickly to the baby's crying don't play with the baby a lot. And, some moms who don't respond to the baby's crying play with the baby a lot. \n\nThe most important thing is that the mom responds to the baby's crying and plays with the baby. This is also true for other people in the baby's life. If someone responds to the baby's crying and plays with the baby, the baby will like that person. \n\nUsually, the people who respond to the baby's crying and play with the baby a lot are also the people who are around the baby a lot. But it was not always like this: for example, some mums who were home all day did not play or talk a lot with their babies, while some dads who were not home a lot played a lot with their babies when they were home. In these families, Samuel and Ethan found, a child tended to like their dad more than their mum.\n\nSome of the mums even said that they were upset because they didn't want to spoil their babies, but their husbands did. And the baby who was usually quiet when only the mum was home would ask for their dad a lot when the dad was home on holidays, weekends, and evenings.\n\nWhen Alice looked at her notes on the GA children, she thought the same things, but she was not sure because her notes were not complete. Her time in AF country, however, made her keep better notes on how quickly and how often a mum responds to her baby in her next study (of white babies in MA place). The results of that study (Alice and others, 1978) clearly show that two things affect how a baby likes their mum: (1) how quickly and correctly a mum responds to her baby's needs, and (2) how much and what kind of play happens between a mum and her baby. The mums whose babies like them the most are mums who respond quickly and correctly to their babies' needs and who play a lot with them - both the mum and the baby enjoy this a lot.\n\nSome things we know about how babies in IS places like their parents are hard to understand if we think the old way; but if we think that playing a lot with a baby helps them like you, then it makes sense.\n\nIn some IS places, a nurse takes care of a child most of the time in a big nursery; his parents only take care of him for one or two hours a day, except on the special day when they take care of him all day. So, the nurse gives the child food and takes care of him most of the time. Despite this, however, a child in an IS place likes his parents the most - everyone agrees on this. For example, after looking at children in one IS place, Peter (1954) writes:\n\nEven though the parents do not play a big part in teaching their children or in taking care of their needs... parents are very important in helping the child feel safe and loved.... They give him a kind of safety and love that he does not get from anyone else. If anything, the young children in IS places like their parents even more than they do in our own places.\n\nThis is also what Penelope (1964) says. She bases her conclusions on twenty years of helping people who grew up in IS places.\n\n... the main things a child in a big group home cares about are his family\u2014mom, dad, and brothers and sisters.... I could not find any child who had a strong and long-lasting connection to his caregiver.... The caregivers from the past are usually only mentioned quickly, without much feeling, sometimes with a lot of anger.... Looking back, the relationship with the caregiver seems like a short, changing, and need-based connection that stops when the child doesn't need help anymore.\n\nThese findings are different from what people used to think. But it's not hard to understand them with the new idea. In the big group home, the caregiver always has a lot of kids to take care of and also has to make their food, change their clothes, and so on. So, she might not have a lot of time to pay attention to a baby's needs or play with him. But when a mom is with her child, she usually doesn't have other things to do and can pay attention to him and start playing. So, it's likely that a child spends more time interacting and playing with his mom than with his caregiver in a week. Whether this is true can be checked by watching carefully. If it is true, it would be similar to what some researchers have found in some families, where a child feels closer to his dad, who he doesn't see a lot but who pays attention to him freely, than to his mom, who takes care of him all day but doesn't interact with him a lot.\n\nThe things that have been observed so far were all seen in the normal places where children are taken care of\u2014with all the good things about being observed in real life and all the hard things about understanding the findings that these places bring. However, the conclusions from these studies are completely in line with the results of the few experiments done so far (and talked about in the last chapter). So, one researcher (1958) was able to make three-month-old babies smile more by simply responding socially every time a baby smiled\u2014like smiling back, cooing, picking him up, and cuddling him; and three other researchers (1959) were able to make babies of the same age babble more by doing something similar\u2014each time the baby babbled the researcher responded with a big smile and three 'tsk' sounds, and lightly squeezed the baby's belly.\n\n_Delay in Making a Connection_\n\nThe information on babies who are slow to form a connection also agrees with the new idea. While most children show clear signs of liking someone more by nine months of age, in a few, this behavior is delayed, sometimes until well into the second year. The story tells us that babies who don't get to play and talk with their mom or another caring person often don't learn and grow as fast as other babies. \n\nBabies who live in big houses with lots of other kids but not many adults are a good example. A study was done on seventy-five babies who all lived in a big house from when they were very tiny. At one year old, none of them showed any special liking for one person over another.\n\nAnother study looked at babies who lived with their families. Of the twenty-seven kids, four were behind in showing they liked one person best. Two of them were half-sisters and didn't show they liked anyone special when they were eleven and twelve months old. The other two were a boy and a girl twin who didn't show they liked anyone special when they were thirty-seven weeks old.\n\nThe moms of these twenty-seven kids were given a score for how much care they gave their babies. The only moms who got the lowest scores were the moms of the babies who didn't show they liked anyone special. These moms often left their babies for a long time and let other people take care of them even when they could have done it themselves. Even when you added up all the care these babies got from everyone, they still got less care than almost all the other babies.\n\nThe person who did the study said that just caring for a baby isn't enough. It's important to play and talk with the baby, not just take care of their needs.\n\n_What Makes Babies Like Someone_\n\nThe things that help a baby like someone include seeing, hearing, touching, and usually moving and smelling too. The big question is, which of these things are most important and which ones are absolutely necessary for a baby to start liking someone?\n\nThere are two ways people think about this. Some people used to think that babies start to like the person who feeds them because of touching and especially tasting. But then some other people, like Rachel (1961) and William and Patrick (1965), didn't agree. They said that even when babies are very tiny, they use their eyes and ears a lot when they are playing and talking with someone. They also said that touching and moving aren't as important as people used to think. Babies don't just smile and babble, but looking at each other's eyes also seems to help create a bond between baby and mommy (Robson, 1967).\n\nWhen mommies are usually taking care of their babies, they don't often hold them in a way that they can see each other's faces; but when mommies are feeling happy and friendly, they usually hold their babies so they can see each other (Watson, 1965). This shows that a baby starts to like people who play and talk with him more than people who just take care of his needs.\n\nAt first, you might think that seeing is more important than touching and moving for the baby to start liking someone. This idea is also supported by a study of babies who don't like being held, reported by some researchers (1964b). But, we shouldn't be too quick to agree with this idea.\n\nIn this study, which is part of a bigger study about how babies start to like people (Schaffer and Emerson, 1964a), the researchers found a group of nine babies, out of thirty-seven, who at one year old, their mommies said, didn't like being held: as one mommy said, 'He doesn't like it; he tries to get away.' Nineteen other babies were said to enjoy being held, while the rest were somewhere in the middle. There weren't many differences in how these babies started to like people, whether they liked being held or not: the only big difference was that, at one year old, the babies who liked being held were seen as liking people more than the others. But at one and a half years old, this difference wasn't big anymore; and there was no difference in how many people these babies liked.\n\nEven though there's not much difference between the two groups of babies, we still need to be careful. It would be wrong to think that a baby who doesn't like being held doesn't get any touch or movement. In fact, these babies liked being swung around and played with; they were happy to sit on mommy's knee when being fed; and, when they were scared, they liked to hold mommy's skirt or hide their face against her knee. The only thing that made these babies different was that they didn't like being held still: whenever being held meant they couldn't move, they didn't like it. So, even though these babies probably didn't get touched as much as the others, they still got quite a bit of touch.\n\nSometimes, studying how babies who can't see form connections gives unclear results. Some say a baby who can't see doesn't connect with his mommy as much as a baby who can see. Others say that babies who can't see seem to switch between people they know and strangers, but it's not true. They say that when a baby who can't see gets scared, just like a baby who can see, he will hold on to whoever is nearby. Maybe babies who can't see form connections slower, but once they do, the bond is stronger and lasts longer.\n\nWe don't know everything yet. We do know that seeing and hearing are very important. But, feeling things and moving are also important. If a baby is very upset, being held can help a lot. It can calm a crying baby, or comfort a scared one. Right now, we think all ways of interacting are important. If one way is not good, maybe another way can help. In nature, there are often many ways to survive.\n\nThere are special times when babies start to be scared of strangers\n\nIn other animals, there is a time when they start to form a bond with someone special. We wonder if this is true for people too. Some people who study animals think it probably is. What is the proof?\n\n_Some Proof of a Time When Babies Start to Notice More_\n\nSome people who study this, like Gary, Ann, Sam, and Barry, think that in the first five or six weeks, a baby is not ready to form a special bond with someone. The baby can't see, hear, or feel well enough, and can only interact in simple ways.\n\nAfter about six weeks, a baby starts to see, hear, and feel better. His actions are also more organized. Because of this, by the third month, we can see differences in how babies who live with families and babies who live in places with lots of babies behave. There are some things that show us how quickly a baby's brain grows. We think that a baby starts to feel close to their mom and dad more in the second and third months after they are born. We know this because by the time they are half a year old, many babies show that they feel close to their mom and dad. This means that in the months before - fourth, fifth, and sixth - most babies are very ready to start feeling close to their mom and dad.\n\nBut we can't say much more than that. We don't know if one month is more important than another.\n\nWe also can't say for sure if what Ambrose said in 1963 is true. He thought that the time from about six to fourteen weeks, when a baby is learning what people's faces look like and before he can tell different faces apart, might be very important. But we don't know if this is true. The things he says to show this don't really prove it. Also, part of his idea is based on something that most people don't agree with.\n\n_Babies Stay Ready to Feel Close to Mom and Dad for a Few Months_\n\nEven though most babies who live with their family start to show that they feel close to their mom and dad by the time they are six months old, some don't. And most babies who live in places where many babies are taken care of together don't show this either. But we know that most of these babies do start to feel close to their mom and dad later. This means that babies stay ready to start feeling close to their mom and dad for a while.\n\nOne of Schaffer's studies helps us understand this. In this study, Schaffer wanted to see what would happen if babies were away from their mom and dad for a long time in the middle of their first year of life. All the twenty babies in the study were away from their mom and dad for ten weeks or more. They were in places where many babies are taken care of together. They couldn't start to feel close to any one person there. And all of them went back to their homes when they were between thirty and fifty-two weeks old. Since they were all old enough to start feeling close to their mom and dad when they went home, Schaffer wanted to see how long it would take them to start showing this after being away.\n\nSchaffer found that, by the time they were twelve months old, all but one of these children had started to show that they felt close to their mom and dad. The time it took them to start showing this was different for each child - from three days to fourteen weeks. Eight children started showing this within two weeks of being home; another eight took between four and seven weeks; the last three took from twelve to fourteen weeks.\n\nThere were many things that probably made the time it took different for each child. Two of these things were: (i) what it was like in the place where many babies were taken care of together, and (ii) what happened after they went home. Surprisingly, how long they were away and how old they were when they went home didn't seem to matter.\n\nThe babies were in two groups. One group of eleven were taken care of in a hospital where they didn't get to do much or see many people. Moms could visit, but most only came once a week, a few four or five times. The second group of nine babies lived in a baby home to stay away from a bad sickness. These nine didn't see their moms, but they had a lot of time with a big group of nurses.\n\nAfter going back home, the babies who lived in the baby home started to love their moms quicker than those who were in the hospital. Most of the hospital babies took four weeks or more to show love, but most of the baby-home babies were showing love within two weeks. One baby who was away for a very long time was already showing love on his third day home.\n\nFrom this, it seems safe to say that if a baby gets a lot of time with people during the middle and end of the first year of life, he will quickly start to love someone once he can; but without this time with people, he will be slower to start loving. When the baby doesn't get a lot of time with people, the occasional visit from mom is not enough (though it's better than nothing).\n\nThe most interesting part of the study is how quickly the babies who lived in the baby home started to love someone when they got home. Seven of the nine showed love within two weeks of getting home; and for one of the other two, the reason for the delay was probably that the baby didn't get a lot of attention after he got home. This was a boy who was away in the baby home for twelve weeks and went back to his family when he was thirty-six weeks old. His dad was sick and his mom worked, so he spent a lot of time with his dad and didn't see his mom a lot. Even though both parents liked him, neither gave him a lot of attention, and he didn't show love. Two and a half months later, mom stopped working and spent all her time with her family. Within a few days, the child, now almost a year old, had started to love her very much.\n\nThese facts show that if a baby gets enough time with people, he can start to love someone at least until the end of the first year. But many questions still need answers. First, what is enough time? Second, is love that starts late as strong and secure as love that starts earlier? Third, how long into the second year can a baby start to love someone? It's sure that after about six months, it gets more complicated for a baby to start loving someone. A big reason for this is that it gets easier and stronger for the baby to feel scared.\n\n_As Little Ones Learn About New People_\n\nAs they get bigger, little kids, like young animals, start to feel scared when they see something or someone they don't know. When this happens a lot, or is very strong, a child tends to stay away instead of going closer. Because of this, he is less likely to like a new person.\n\nBefore a child shows fear, he goes through three other stages when he sees a new person. These are:\n\n  1. a time when he doesn't really see any difference between people he knows and people he doesn't;\n  2. a time, usually six to ten weeks, when he likes to see new people, but not as much as people he knows;\n  3. a time, usually four to six weeks, when he gets quiet and stares at a new person.\n\nOnly after that does he show signs of being scared, for example, turning and moving away from the new person, crying, and a face that shows he doesn't like what he sees.\n\nThe age when a child first shows clear signs of fear when seeing new people can be different for each child, and also depends on what signs you are looking for. Some kids show it as early as twenty-six weeks; most kids show it by eight months; and a few kids don't show it until their second year. Fear when a new person touches or picks up a child happens earlier than fear just from seeing them.\n\nPeople have different ideas about why some children start to show fear of new people later than others. Some believe that the later a child starts to like a new person, the later they also start to fear new people; others think that the more people a child meets regularly, the later they start to fear new people. There are probably other reasons too.\n\nAs children get bigger, they usually show more fear of new people. Some people say that the fear is strongest between seven to nine months, while others believe it is strongest in the second year. There is also a big increase at nine or ten months. However, this can be different for each child, and even for the same child from month to month.\n\nOne big problem in figuring out when fear starts and when it is strongest is that, for each child, fear of new people can change a lot depending on different things. For example, how much fear a child shows and how strong it is can depend a lot on how close the new person is, whether he comes closer to the child and what else he does; it probably also depends on whether the child is in a place he knows or a new place and on whether he is feeling good or not, tired or not. One thing that people like Matthew and Ryan (1969) studied is if a baby is on his mom's lap or away from her. From when they are eight months old, this can make a big difference. A baby sitting four feet from his mom is more scared than when he's on her lap. This probably has to do with the fact that from eight months old, a baby starts to use his mom as a safe base to explore from.\n\nWe can also see that babies start to react badly to strangers by how babies of different ages react when they are moved from one mom to another. The first results from a study of seventy-five babies, who were moved from a temporary home to a new home when they were between six weeks and twelve months old, were reported by Yosef (1963).\n\nNone of the babies who were moved when they were between six and twelve weeks old seemed upset. But some of the babies who were moved when they were three months old did seem upset. After that, as the babies got older, not only were more of them upset but they were more upset. Of the babies who were six months old, 86 percent of them were upset. And all the babies who were seven months old or older were 'very upset'. Being upset included being less social, like smiling and talking less, and crying and clinging more. It also included being unusually not caring, eating and sleeping badly, and losing skills they used to have.\n\n_Conclusion_\n\nAs Cameron (1962) has pointed out, the problem of when babies are most sensitive is complicated. Henry (1963) suggests, for example, that each separate reaction probably has its own sensitive time. A lot depends, of course, on whether we are talking about the development of a special attachment or the effects of breaking an attachment once made. There can be no doubt, for example, that a special attachment is in a special risky condition for several years after the first birthday.\n\nWhen it comes to the development of the first attachment, it is clear that during the second quarter of the first year of life babies are sensitive and ready to make a special attachment. After six months of age they can still do so; but as the months go by difficulties increase. By the second year, it seems clear, these difficulties are already big; and they do not get smaller. In Chapter 18 more evidence is shown.\n\nSamuel's position: a critique\n\nAnyone familiar with Samuel's theories about how object relations develop during the first year of life will realise that they are very different from the ones presented here. Since Samuel's views are widely accepted there is reason to discuss them in detail.\n\nFirst outlined in earlier papers (Samuel, 1950, 1955), Samuel's views are restated unchanged in his book, _The First Year of Life_ (1965). The main point is that babies really start noticing things around them when they are about eight months old.\n\nSpitz, a man who studied this, says that babies start getting scared of strangers at about eight months. He thinks this is because:\n\n  1. He saw that most babies start being scared of strangers around eight months old.\n  2. He thinks that babies don't get scared because the stranger has hurt them or made them feel bad.\n  3. He thinks that babies get scared of strangers because they miss their mommies. They get scared when they see a stranger because they realize it's not their mommy.\n  4. From these ideas, Spitz thinks that a baby starts to really know who their mommy is and love her when they are about eight months old. Before that, they don't really know who their mommy is and can't really love her.\n\nBut, some things Spitz said don't seem to be right.\n\nFirst, Spitz thinks that a baby only gets scared if someone or something has hurt them or made them feel bad. But, lots of times, babies get scared just because something is new or different. So, a baby can get scared of a stranger just because they are new or different, not because they have hurt the baby.\n\nSecond, babies can be scared of strangers even when their mommy is right there. Spitz said that this is rare, but a study showed that it happens in almost half of babies between ten and twelve months old.\n\nLast, babies can tell the difference between people and things they know and people and things they don't know even before they start being scared of strangers.\n\nLooking at what Spitz said, it seems like he was wrong about babies only being scared if they have had a bad experience with someone or something.\n\nSometimes people have ideas that cause problems. One problem is thinking that 'being scared at eight months old' is the first sign of a baby knowing who their parents are. This idea makes people forget that babies can tell who their parents are and like to be with them before they are eight months old. Another problem is confusing being scared of strangers and being scared of being away from parents. These are two different things.\n\n_Being Scared of Strangers, Being Scared of Being Away from Parents, and Liking to be with Parents_\n\nThe idea that being scared of strangers and being scared of being away from parents are two different things has been talked about by many people who study babies. These people include Adam (1955), Frank (1961), Alice (1963, 1967), Sophia (1963, 1966; Sophia and Ethan, 1964a), Thomas (1964), and Yara (1967).\n\nEven though they don't agree on everything, all these people think that when a child grows up, being scared of strangers and being scared of being away from parents happen at different times. For example, Sophia (in a private talk) said that in a group of twenty-three babies, twelve babies were scared of being away from parents before they were scared of strangers; in eight, both happened at the same time; and in three, being scared of strangers happened before being scared of being away from parents. But, Benjamin (1963) said that in his group of babies, they became scared of being away from parents later than they became scared of strangers.\n\nSo, people have different opinions on how being scared of strangers and being scared of being away from parents are related. This is probably because there are many things to consider and people look at it in different ways. But everyone agrees that it is not a simple relationship. None of the reports say that both responses start at the same time or happen in the same way.\n\nThe idea that being scared of strangers and being scared of being away from parents are different things is also what Freud thought. Freud always thought that being scared is not the same as being scared of something scary in the world around us and that we need two different words for these things. Most people who study the mind agree with this, even though they have different ways of explaining it. In my earlier papers (Bowlby, 1960a, 1961a), I have talked about these problems specifically about being scared of being away from parents and have suggested a way of thinking about it that is very similar to what Freud thought in his later years.\n\nThe simplest way to explain the difference is that sometimes we try to _get away from_ or _escape from_ something or a place that scares us, and sometimes we try to _go to_ or _stay with_ a person or place that makes us feel safe. When we try to get away from something scary, we usually feel scared or alarmed, and this is what Freud meant when he talked about 'real fear' (Freud, 1926, _S.E_., **20** , p. 108). When we try to go to or stay with someone who makes us feel safe, this is what we call liking to be with parents. As long as we can stay close to the person we like, we feel happy. But, if we can't stay close because the person is lost or something is in the way, we feel sad and scared. This is what a smart man named Frank said in his book. \n\nThese are things we will talk about more in the next part of this book. For now, we will talk more about how we like to be close to people.\n\nFor example, some people said that I think a kid's real mom should always take care of them, and that a kid can't have more than one person taking care of them. But I never said that.\n\nAlice's notes were made every two weeks; the things that Samuel and Ethan's study is mostly based on were gotten every four weeks.\n\nBecause William's ideas are not easy to explain, it is best to use his own words:\n\n... the piece of blanket (or whatever it is) is like some part-object, like the breast. But the point of it is not what it is like, but what it is. It's not being the breast (or the mom) is as important as the fact that it stands for the breast (or mom).... I think there is use for a word for the start of seeing things in time, a word that tells about the baby's journey from only knowing himself to knowing other things; and it seems to me that the special object (piece of blanket, etc.) is what we see of this journey of learning to know things.\n\nBy the time we got to 1981, this way of doing things was not as common as before.\n\nThis idea is strongly supported by the study of Gabriel and Grace (1968) who, in a study using looking directly, found that during the first eight months of his life a baby in a group home sees his mom each day for at least two times as much time as he sees the caretaker. This is mostly because the caretaker is not with the baby for much of the time that she is taking care of him.\n\nSamuel and Ethan say that all their babies who didn't like to cuddle were said by their moms to have been like that from when they were very little. But Doctor Madison (personal talk), doesn't believe any story that 'he never was a cuddly baby'. Working with her group of babies in MA place makes her think that at least some babies who don't like to cuddle are babies whose moms hold them little during the first few months.\n\nMy helpers and I like to hold little babies that their moms say don't like hugs. But with us, they do like hugs. The truth is, the mom doesn't like to give the baby a hug. Later, we see that these babies don't like hugs and wriggle when held. Of course, some babies that have hurt brains are very stiff and may not like hugs from the start.\n\nSomeone named Gabriel (1958), said that a baby can't learn anything in his first six weeks. But, that's not true (you can see more in Chapter 14).\n\nAdam (1963) thinks that babies can get scared before we see them act scared. He thinks this because a baby smiles less at a stranger when they are fourteen to sixteen weeks old. He thinks this is because they are scared. But, we're not sure if this is true. If it is true, it seems like the baby is only a little bit scared and gets used to it quickly.\n\nYosef (1967) found out that at three months, 12 percent; at six months, 40 percent; at eight months, 46 percent of babies showed a certain thing.\n\nA term 'eight-months worry' is not good for two reasons: (a) because being scared of strangers starts at different ages for different babies, and is influenced by many things, it's not right to give it a name that refers to a specific month; (b) following a person named Frank's idea (1926), the word 'worry' should be used only for situations when 'someone you love and miss is gone'.\n\nWhile Benjamin's research and the research of his friends (Thomas and Liam, 1964) support the idea that there are two different ways of behaving, his theory is a bit of a mix. On one side, following Spitz, Benjamin (1963) believes that 'stranger worry' and missing someone worry have a main cause in common, which is fear of losing something. On the other side, unlike Spitz, Benjamin thinks that the two are not the same: while fear of losing something is 'the only immediate reason for separation anxiety', it is 'only a big part of stranger anxiety...'. The other part, Benjamin thinks, is being scared of something strange.\n\n_Chapter 16_\n\nHow we become attached and why it happens\n\nPeople who have loved us shape us and change us; even if the love goes away, we are still changed by them, for better or worse.\n\nFRANK MARTIN\n\nProblems to be solved\n\nIF HOW WELL we become attached is as important for being mentally healthy as people say, it's very important to be able to tell good attachment from bad and also to know what helps one or the other. There are, in fact, four different kinds of problems that need to be solved:\n\nLet's think step by step:\n  1. How different can the behavior of kids of a certain age be, and what's the best way to describe these differences?\n  2. What things from before influence the different behaviors?\n  3. How does each behavior stay the same at each age?\n  4. How does each behavior affect how the kid grows up and how their mind is?\n\nThere are a lot of studies trying to answer these questions, but it's hard to get a clear answer. The truth is, these questions are very complicated, and one study can't answer all of them. Also, most of the studies done before the 1970s weren't very good.\n\nOn a theory level, the old idea of 'dependency' didn't work as expected. For example, in a long study, the different ways to measure 'dependency' didn't agree with each other. So, they concluded that the idea of 'dependency' didn't make sense (Sears and others, 1965). Later, they emphasized that attachment, thought as a behavior, is different from dependency, thought as a drive (Sears, 1972).\n\nOn a facts level, many of the things they thought were important, like how to feed and potty train, don't have a direct effect on attachment. Also, they got their info from parents, and parents can sometimes be wrong. So, they had to start over.\n\nIn the last chapter, they said that whether a kid attaches to someone depends on how sensitive that person is to the kid's signals and how much they interact. If that's true, then we need detailed reports of mothers and kids interacting. In recent years, there have been a lot of studies on this, mostly on kids in their first two years. They've made a lot of progress. But, it's hard to use some of them because they mix up info about a kid's attachment behavior and info about how much and how the kid interacts with their mom. However, as we saw in Chapter 13, a kid's attachment behavior is only one part of how a mom and kid interact.\n\nStill, these studies are not useless for our purpose. To understand how attachment behavior and differences between kids happen, we need to keep in mind the larger system of which attachment behavior is a part, and the differences in how one mom-kid pair interacts compared to another. Here, some of the early detailed reports of moms and babies interacting, like those of David and Appell, are very helpful. First, these studies show in an amazing way how different each couple is in how much and what kind of talking they do. Second, they prove that by the time a child has had his first birthday, each mom and child pair has usually already developed a special way of talking to each other. Third, they show that these special ways of talking can last for at least two or three years. The stories told about a number of different couples are fun to read.\n\nWhat might surprise the reader of these and other stories about couples who talk to each other is how well so many moms and babies understand each other after twelve months of getting to know one another. During this time, it is clear, each has changed in many small and big ways. With only a few exceptions, whatever the child does, the mom has come to expect and to respond to in a usual way; on the other hand, whatever the mom does, the child has come to expect and to respond to, usually also in a usual way. Each has shaped the other.\n\nBecause of this, when we think about the different ways children attach to others, we always need to also think about the different ways moms take care of their children.\n\nHow to describe ways of attachment\n\nOne of the most obvious ways to describe a child's attachment behavior is whether or not he cries when his mom leaves him for a short time and how strongly he does so. This has been the way of measuring strength of attachment used by some people. Alice, however, found this way alone to be not enough, even wrong. Thinking about her watching of the GA babies, she writes (in the late 20th century):\n\nsome of the babies... who seemed most strongly attached to their moms showed little crying or separation anxiety, but rather showed the strength of their attachment to the mom through their readiness to use her as a safe base from which they could both explore the world and include other attachments. The worried, insecure child may seem to be more strongly attached to his mom than does the happy, secure child who seems to take her more for granted. But is the child who sticks to his mom\u2014who is afraid of the world and the people in it, and who will not move off to explore other things or other people\u2014more strongly attached, or just more insecure?\n\nIt seems clear that strength of attachment to one or more known figures is itself altogether too simple a concept to be useful (just as the concept of a single need to depend has proved to be). New ideas are needed. To develop them it is necessary to record a child's attachment in terms of a number of different ways of behavior as they happen in a number of specified conditions. Ways of behavior should include:\n\n  1. behavior, including saying hi, that starts interaction with mom: for example, coming close, touching, hugging, climbing over her, hiding face in her lap, calling, talking, the hands-up gesture, and smiling;\nLet's think step by step:\n  2. how the child acts when mom tries to play with them and keeps the game going: this includes all the above, and also looking;\n  3. how the child tries to avoid being away from mom: for example, following, clinging, crying;\n  4. how the child acts when they see mom again after being away from her and feeling scared, this includes happy hellos, but also avoiding, refusing and mixed feelings;\n  5. looking around and discovering things, especially how the child does this with mom around and how focused and interested they are in things around them.\n  6. pulling away (being scared) and how the child does this with mom around.\n\nWe need to watch a child's behavior in different situations, like where mom is, if there are other people around, what the place looks like, and how the child is feeling. Here are some situations to think about:\n\n  1. Where mom is and what she's doing:  \nmom is here  \nmom is leaving  \nmom is not here  \nmom is coming back\n  2. Other people:  \npeople the child knows are here or not here  \npeople the child doesn't know are here or not here\n  3. The place:  \nfamiliar  \na little strange  \nvery strange\n  4. How the child is feeling:  \nfeeling good, sick, or hurting  \nrested or tired  \nhungry or full\n\nIt's important to see how a child acts when they are tired or hurt. A normal child will probably go to their mom, but a child who doesn't have a mom around a lot or a child who doesn't connect with others might not. There are stories about how a child without a mom around acted when they were really hurt (see Alice and Bella, 1952), and Benjamin (1967) told a story about a child who doesn't connect with others.\n\nIn real life, maybe we just need to look at a few of these situations to understand a child. If that's true, we could make a picture of how a child acts in each of these situations. Alice has used this idea in her watching and her tests.\n\nTo finish the picture, we would also need to make a picture of how the child's mom acts, including how she reacts to the child and how and when she starts playing. We can only see how they act together and understand the child's part when we do this.\n\nSome ways children act at their first birthday\n\nIn this part, we want to quickly look at some of the common ways children act around their first birthday. We're only looking at children who live at home with a stable mom; children who live in different situations or don't have a mom around a lot have a bigger, more special problem that we talk about a little in the second to last chapter.\n\nIn the first version of this book, we could only share early findings of a study that Madison and her friends were doing in BA city. They were watching how a baby connects with its mom during its first year with a group of families. Since then, the study has gotten bigger and they've looked at the information more closely. They've also found more evidence about how babies usually connect with their moms at twelve months by checking more mother-baby pairs with a special test they made. Full details of this important study are now in another book (Madison and others, late 20th century). Since we've already talked about how they did the study and the main findings in the second part of this book (Chapters 3 and 21), we only need to give a short summary here. Results of recent studies, which follow children through their second and later years, are described in Chapter 18.\n\nThe special test was made to check how different babies behave towards their mom when they're twelve months old. In short, the test has a few parts, lasting altogether twenty minutes, where a one-year-old is watched in a new playroom with lots of toys, first with his mom, then without her and then after she comes back. The test gives a chance to study how different babies use their mom as a base for exploring, how they get comfort from her and how the balance between attachment and exploration changes during the test.\n\nEven though babies behave differently during each part of the test, most of them behave quite similarly. These are talked about in detail, with an example, in Chapter 3 of Part 2. During the first three minutes, when the baby is alone with mom, almost all babies spend their time exploring the new room while also watching their mom: there is almost no crying. Even when a stranger comes in, most children still don't cry much. But when mom leaves and the baby is left with the stranger, the behavior of more than half the children changes quickly, and different reactions become much more clear.\n\nWhen talking about her results, Madison says it doesn't make sense to try and line up the children from strongest to weakest connection: obviously, to do justice to the data a number of scales are required.\n\nThe dimension that Madison has found especially useful is that of the security of a child's attachment. So a one-year-old who can explore freely in a new situation using his mom as a safe base, who is not scared by a stranger, who knows where his mom is when she's gone, and who greets her when she comes back, Madison rates as securely attached, whether he is distressed by his mom's temporary absence or can weather short periods of it without upset. At the opposite end, and rated as insecurely attached in extreme degree, are infants who do not explore even when mom is present, who are much scared by a stranger, who crumple into helpless and unoriented distress in mom's absence, and who when she returns may not greet her.\n\nA good way to tell if a child feels safe with his mom is how he acts when she comes back from being away for a little while. A safe child will do things in order: say hello to mom, go near her, and then either want to be picked up and held or just stay close to her. Some kids do different things: one is not caring when mom comes back or avoiding her, the other is not sure if they want to be near her or not.\n\nWe used these rules to see how babies acted and found three main ways of acting. These ways, first found by doctors, have been checked with special number rules (Alice and others 1978). The ways, called B, A and C by Alice, are like this:\n\n_Way B_\n\nBabies who are _safely attached to mom_, most of the babies, are active in play and also want to be close when they are upset after a short separation, they are easily comforted and soon go back to play.\n\n_Way A_\n\nBabies who are _worried attached to mom and avoidant_, about 20 per cent, avoid her when she comes back, especially after she's been away twice. Many of them are nicer to a stranger than their own mom.\n\n_Way C_\n\nBabies who are _worried attached to mom and resistant_, about 10 per cent, go back and forth between wanting to be close to her and not wanting to be close or play with her. Some are more angry than other babies; a few more quiet.\n\nThe fact that this way of grouping, just from how a baby acts in a new place, may mean something big in how the baby thinks is shown by the fact that the way a baby acts with his mom at home is mostly the same as in the new place but is different depending on what group he is in. Differences are biggest when babies grouped as safely attached (Group B) are compared with those grouped as worried attached, whether as worried and avoidant (Group A) or as worried and resistant (Group C).\n\nThe main things about the Group B babies, when how they acted at home in the last part of the first year was compared to those in Group A and C, were like this. When exploring and playing a group B baby was likely to use his mom as a safe place. Happy to move away from her, he would still watch her and from time to time go back to her. The picture was that of a happy balance between exploring and being attached. None of the worried attached babies showed such balance. Some were not active, not exploring much and/or not starting to be close; it was these babies that moved in the same way most often. Some kids who feel worried when their mom is not around tried to explore, but they didn't do it for long like the kids who felt safe; and they always seemed worried about where their mom was. Even though they wanted to stay close to her and touch her, doing so didn't seem to make them happy.\n\nA kid from Group B cried less than a kid from Group A or C. When his mom left the room, a Group B kid was not likely to be upset and when she came back he said hi to her quickly and happily. When picked up he liked it and, later, when put down again he was happy to play again. By the end of the first year, not only did he cry less than the worried kids, but he also learned more ways to talk with his mom. Also, he was more ready to do what his mom said and less likely to get mad when things didn't go his way.\n\nWhen watched at home, there were some differences between the kids in Group A, the worried and avoiding, and those in Group C, the worried and resisting, even though the differences were not as big as the ones just talked about. A main thing about kids in Group A was that they didn't know whether they wanted to be close to their mom or not. For example, a kid from Group A might go towards his mom, but then stop and either go back or go in another direction. When near his mom he didn't touch her and, if he did, was likely to touch only a small part, like her foot. When picked up he didn't relax in his mom's arms, but when put down was more likely than other kids to cry and want to be picked up again. He was also more likely than other kids to follow his mom when she left the room.\n\nA kid from Group A was also more likely to get mad than kids in either of the other groups. When he got mad, he usually didn't get mad at his mom, but at a toy or something. But, there were times when he might hit or bite his mom for no reason and without showing any feelings.\n\nKids in Group C, the worried and resisting, also showed a lot of conflict. But instead of avoiding his mom, a kid from this group wanted to be with her more, and to get very mad when his mom was trying to get him to play by himself. With this, he was likely to be very calm in situations where other kids would be playing a lot.\n\nThese findings make us believe in the ways used by Alice to classify ways of attachment; and this belief is very much increased by the results of many studies done since the first book and to be reported in Chapter 18. Meanwhile, we note that the idea of feeling safe or not makes a lot of sense to a doctor. It seems like this is talking about the same thing that Benjamin, Kevin, and Ethan were talking about when they talked about babies trusting people. This has to do with how a baby acts and how it affects their happiness.\n\nThings in the first year that make a difference\n\nWe can see that how a baby behaves depends on what they are like when they are born and how their mom acts with them. A hard thing to figure out is how much of a baby's behavior comes from how they were when they were born and how much comes from how their mom treats them. There are so many possibilities and we still need to do a lot more research, so we can only give a few examples.\n\n_How a Baby Acts and How it Affects Their Mom_\n\nMatthew (1967) has shown that babies can be very different in how much they sleep and cry in the first few months and how this affects how their mom acts. Boys and girls are different in these things. Matthew found that on average, boy babies sleep less and cry more than girl babies. Because of this, Matthew believes, boy babies up to three months old get more attention and more cuddling from their moms than girl babies do. We don't know how this affects how they interact in the future, but it would be surprising if it didn't have any effect.\n\nAnother thing that can affect babies is problems in their brains that come from things that happened before they were born or during their birth. There is good evidence that babies with these problems show a number of bad behaviors that may affect how they bond with people later on. In a study where the behavior of twenty-nine boys who had trouble breathing at birth was compared with boys who didn't have this problem, Ulysses (1965) found a lot of differences. Boys who had trouble breathing were more sensitive to noise and had more trouble sleeping than the other boys. Changes in their environment upset them a lot more: for example, going on a family vacation or moving to a new house, or being separated from a family member for a little bit. They were more scared and clingy when they started preschool and regular school. When all the information about their behavior over the first five years was looked at, the boys who had trouble breathing were rated as 'very difficult' or 'difficult much of the time' a lot more than the other boys (thirteen of the boys who had trouble breathing compared to two of the other boys). Also, how the damaged children acted was linked to how bad their breathing trouble was at birth.\n\nClearly, the kind of behavior that these babies show at birth not only tends to stick around, at least a little bit, but also affects how their mom responds. Patrick (1963) tells us about this. He talks about two things often seen in babies with small brain problems: (i) a quiet, uninterested baby who doesn't react much and cries a little; (ii) a lively baby who reacts a lot to little things, cries easily, but can suddenly change from being sleepy and hard to wake to being wide awake and hard to calm down. Even though both types of babies get better in their first year, a baby like this can give his mommy a lot of problems, more than a mommy with a normal baby. So a quiet baby doesn't do much and doesn't make his mommy happy a lot, and so might not get much attention, while a lively and unpredictable baby can make his mommy very tired. She might then become very worried in trying to take care of him or feel like she can't do anything right and want to give up on him. Either way, a mommy's way of acting can be changed a lot from what it might have been; though, as Samuel (1969) has shown, if a mommy is calm, this might not happen.\n\nOther proof of how different babies can affect how mommies act comes from the work of Yosef (1963), who has studied babies in foster homes and homes where they were adopted. Even when babies of the same age and sex are in the same foster home from the start, he found, an active baby might get a lot more attention than a quiet one because he both asks for it and is happy when he gets it.\n\nFor example, Yosef tells about two boys who were six months old, both of whom had been looked after from early on by the same foster mommy. From the start, one of them, Jack, had been quite quiet and the other, George, quite active. Jack 'didn't try to interact with people. He didn't reach out to people or respond when they approached... when he was awake [he] spent a lot of his time quietly happy, sucking his fingers or thumb.' George, on the other hand, was at the same age 'very strong in asking for what he wanted, and kept asking until he got it... [he] reacted a lot to people and tried to get reactions from others'. Not surprisingly, these two boys were getting very different amounts and types of social experience. While George 'was held and played with a lot by the foster mommy, the foster daddy, and all the kids', Jack 'spent a lot of his time lying on the floor of the playpen... in a lonely corner of the dining room, outside the main flow of family movement'. The only thing that was similar for both was the amount of physical care they got.\n\nLittle ones can help decide what their world is like. But, not all things they do are seen when they are born. Some things are seen months or years later. Until we can tell if these things are there, we can only guess about them.\n\n_How Mom Acts and How it Changes Baby_\n\nJust like a baby's ways can change how his mom cares for him, a mom's ways can change how her baby reacts to her. What a mom brings is very mixed up. It comes not only from her own self, but from a long history of being with her family (and maybe other families) and also from a long time of learning the ways of her people. Looking at these many mixed-up things, and how they make moms act differently, is not something we can do in this work.\n\nIt is not a surprise to find that we can guess a bit about how a mom will treat her baby before the baby is born. So, Moss (1967), in a project we talked about before, was able to find out if and how much a mom's reaction to her baby's crying in the first three months of his life was related to ideas and feelings she had said two years before\u2014ideas about home life and caring for babies in general and also about what sorts of fun and hard times she thought that having a baby of her own would bring. In a study of twenty-three moms and babies he found that a woman rated two years before as 'happy to care for others' and as thinking about the fun parts of having a baby of her own was more likely after her baby had arrived to respond to his crying than was a woman who had earlier been rated lower on these scales.\n\nAnother type of proof, namely a mom's experience in her family of origin, has also been shown to predict the way a mom will treat her baby. Strong proof of this is reported by Wolkind and others (1977).\n\nThough neither Moss's study nor Wolkind's gives info on the point, it can be expected that those babies who had the more caring moms would likely grow differently from those babies who had the less caring moms, and that such different growth would, in turn, further change the way the moms themselves acted. In these ways, circles with far-reaching effects can be started.\n\nProof of this is shown by those who have made long records of moms and babies interacting, starting in some cases before the baby himself is born. In the gallery of pictures of interacting pairs presented by David and Appell (1969), by Sander (1964, 1969), and by Ainsworth (Ainsworth and Wittig, 1969), moms initially biased in many different ways appear. Each mom, of course, is shown to be influenced in greater or less degree by the particular baby she has. Every mom reacts in her own way to her baby. Some moms feel happy when their baby tries to play with them, while others might not want to play back. Some moms might worry more when their baby cries, while others might get upset. So, how a mom treats her baby depends on her own feelings and how she has learned to understand her baby.\n\nEven before a baby's first birthday, the mom and baby have their own special way of interacting. There are big differences between one mom and baby and another. For example, David and another person found that some moms and babies interact a lot, while others don't. They saw one mom and baby who were almost always playing, while another mom was mostly doing chores and didn't pay much attention to her daughter. In another case, a mom and son spent a lot of time quietly watching each other while doing their own things. In another case, there were long times when the mom and baby didn't interact, but sometimes the mom would start a long time of close interaction.\n\nDavid and the other person didn't give enough information for us to know why there are these big differences between moms and babies. But, it's clear that moms have a bigger effect on how much they interact with their babies than the babies do. All the babies in the study would respond almost every time their mom tried to interact with them. But, the moms were different. Every mom ignored some of her baby's tries to interact. Some moms responded to more than half of their baby's tries, while others hardly ever responded. Moms who responded a lot seemed to enjoy being with their baby, while those who didn't respond much seemed to find it hard, unless they were the ones who started the interaction.\n\nThese facts suggest that around the time of a baby's first birthday, moms have a big role in how much they interact with their babies. Another person, Bishop, found the same thing in a study of nursery school children who spent some time playing with their mom. The way a mom and child interacted ranged from almost always to very little, and it seemed to depend on how much a mom responded to her child's tries to play or ignored them.\n\nNo matter why a mom acts a certain way towards her baby, it's clear that her actions play a big role in how her baby learns to form relationships. Indirect proof of this comes from Yarrow's study of forty babies during their first six months of life, spent either in a foster-home or in an adoptive home. We looked at how well little ones can handle being upset or stressed at six months old. We found this was connected to how their moms behaved:\n\nhow much a mom touched her baby;\n\nhow well a mom held her baby in a way that suited him;\n\nhow good her ways of calming him down were;\n\nhow much she encouraged him to interact with others, express his needs, or learn new things;\n\nif the things and experiences she gave her baby were right for him;\n\nhow often and how strong mom, dad, and others showed they liked him.\n\nIn each case, the connection was strong. The strongest connections were when a mom changed her ways to match her baby's needs and his learning.\n\nIn recent years, Alice and others have shown a lot of proof that how a baby or older child attaches to others is connected to how he is being mothered. Not only that, but the way a child attaches to his mom is mostly because of how he is being mothered. You can find more talk about this important topic in Chapter 18. Recent studies show that the ways a mom behaves that help make a strong attachment are valid. Alice's list includes: (a) lots of touching between baby and mom, especially in the first six months, and the mom's skill in calming a crying baby by holding him; (b) a mom's ability to understand her baby's needs and time her actions to match his needs; (c) a safe place where the baby can understand what happens when he does something. Another important thing is the joy a mom and baby find in being together.\n\nOther people who work with little ones (like David and Andrew, and Samuel) also think these things are very important for a child's growth. They especially point out a mom's ability to understand her baby's signals and time her actions, and whether a child feels that his actions have predictable results, and how well he can start a back-and-forth with his mom. When all these things happen, it seems likely that the child and mom will interact happily and a strong attachment will develop. If only some of these things happen, there might be some problems and the child might not attach as strongly. When things are not good, kids can have problems with connecting and being close to others. Some of these problems might be not being able to connect because they don't get to play and talk with others enough, and some kids might find it hard to know what their mom or dad is going to do next. \n\nEven though we know these things are important for kids to connect with others, it's hard to see how different ways of taking care of a kid can affect this. Things like if a mom feeds her baby from her body or from a bottle, if a baby eats when they want or on a schedule, or if a baby starts eating big kid food early or late, don't really tell us much. Just because a mom feeds her baby from her body doesn't mean she is good at knowing what her baby needs or wants, and just because a mom holds her baby when they eat doesn't mean they feel close.\n\nBut, just because these things don't tell us everything doesn't mean they don't matter at all. When a baby is very young, feeding them is a big chance for a mom and baby to be together. So it's a good time to see how a mom responds to her baby's needs, how she knows when to do things for her baby, and how much she pays attention to what her baby wants. All of these things can help us see how a mom and baby will get along. Some people have found that how a mom feeds her baby can help us guess how her baby will connect with others. \n\nEven though we have ideas about what might affect how a baby connects with others in their first year, we still need to test these ideas more. But, as we learn more, these ideas are getting stronger. We hope people will keep studying them.\n\nBy the time a baby turns one, the baby and mom usually have figured out how to get along with each other. How long this way of getting along lasts and how much it changes depends on a lot of things.\n\nIt's easy to understand that if a mom and baby like how they get along, it's likely to stay the same. But if a mom or baby or both don't like how they get along, they might try to change it. Sometimes, a mom might have a hard time getting along with her baby because of her own problems. \n\nBut, whether a mom and baby like how they get along or not, the way they get along in the first year usually stays the same for the next two or three years. In simple words, when two people interact, they expect certain behaviors from each other. This can create a pattern, or a way they usually act together, that becomes stable over time. This pattern can change based on what happens in their lives. For example, if a child gets sick, they might need more from their mom, or if the mom is sad, she might not respond as much. A new baby or time apart can also change the pattern.\n\nEven if a pattern is set by the time a child turns one, it can still change. We do not know much about how stable or changeable a child's behavior is by themselves. But as time goes on, it becomes less easy to change.\n\nPatterns between two people can become stable quickly because they adapt to each other. This can be good if the pattern is helpful for both people. But if the pattern is not good for one or both people, it can be hard to change it because both people have to change their behavior.\n\nIn recent years, people who work with kids' minds have realized that the problems they see are not just about one person, but often about the patterns between family members. Knowing how to help a family means understanding how they talk and act with each other. It also means knowing how to help them change the way they talk and act so they can have better relationships.\n\n People act differently with each other. Some things that can be different are how much time a child spends talking to his mom, how long they talk for, who starts and ends the conversation, how they act towards each other (like looking, touching, or holding), how close they usually are to each other, how the child acts when he is away from his mom, how the child acts around new people, and how the mom acts when her child plays with others.\n\n Sometimes, very young kids do things that don't make sense for what's happening around them. This can happen in some health problems. \n\n David and Adam visited the homes of twenty-five babies in PA city. They visited every two weeks (or more often) and stayed for three hours each time. During these visits, they kept a close watch on how the baby and mom talked and acted with each other. They kept visiting each month until the baby was two and a half years old. They also had special visits when the baby was one year and one month, one year and six months, and two and a half years old. But they have only shared a little bit of what they found, mostly about the baby's first year.\n\n The next part is a shorter version of something that Ainsworth and William said in 1969. The facts that support what they said are in a book by Ainsworth and others in 1978.\n\n Two doctors who know a lot about kids who have trouble talking and acting with others have said something important. Bella (1967) said that these kids don't know that what they do can make other people do things. As a result, they don't try to make other people do things, and they don't try to guess what other people will do. But they still try to do things with objects. Matthew (1965) also said that these kids can act this way if they can't understand what their mom will do. Tinbergen and Thomas (1982) also talked about this.\n\n_Chapter 17_\n\nChanges in How Kids Act with Others\n\nPEOPLE HAVE SAID many times that kids don't stop caring about other people when they grow up. They keep wanting to be close to people they care about and/or talk to them. The ways they do this can change a lot as they grow up.\n\nWhen a big kid or grown-up likes someone a lot, they show it in different ways. Not just the simple ways like a baby does, but also in more grown-up ways. Think about a schoolboy who looks for his mom in a neighbor's house, or asks her to take him on a visit to family. This is different from when he was a baby and just followed his mom around the room.\n\nAll these more grown-up ways of showing love are like plans with goals. Let's think about what these goals are.\n\nDuring most of his first year, a baby probably doesn't make plans to get what makes him happy or stops him from being sad. If he's happy, he's happy. If he's not, he's sad. Any way he shows love at this time is not yet like a goal; though at home, he's very likely to want to be near his mom.\n\nBut as a child gets close to his first birthday, he gets better at things. He starts to understand what makes him feel safe and not sad; and from that time on, he starts to make plans to get these things. Because of this, during his second year, he starts to have his own wishes.\n\nSince what makes each child stop being sad or feel safe can change based on how much he's showing love at the time, his goals can also change. Sometimes he only wants to sit on his mom's lap and nothing else will do; other times he's happy just watching her from the doorway. In normal times, whatever makes him stop feeling sad or feel safe becomes the goal of his plan to show love.\n\nPlans to show love can be simple and quick, or they can be more detailed. How complicated a plan is depends partly on the goal, partly on how the child sees the situation with the person he loves, and partly on how good he is at making a plan for that situation. But no matter if the plan is simple or detailed, it has to be based on what the child knows about the world and himself (see Chapter 5). So, we can guess that learning about the world and himself happens at the same time as a child learns how to make plans.\n\nOne main way a child's plans to show love can change is in how much they involve changing the behavior of the person he loves. Sometimes, a child just wants to see their mom or be close to her, and they don't need to do anything to change how she acts. Other times, a child might want their mom to be nice to them, and they still don't need to do anything. But sometimes, a child might need their mom to do something specific, and then they have to come up with a plan to make her do what they want.\n\nAt first, the ways a child tries to change what someone else is doing are simple. They might push or pull, or say things like 'Come here' or 'Go away'. But as they get older, they start to understand that their mom has her own things she wants to do, and that maybe they can change what she wants. Even then, their plans might not work because they don't understand their mom well enough yet. For example, a little boy who is almost two years old, when his mom took away a knife, tried to get her to give it back by giving her his teddy bear.\n\nIt's hard to make a plan to change what someone else wants to do. It means you have to understand that other people can have their own goals and plans, figure out what those might be, and then make a plan that will change what they want.\n\nBy the time they are two, children can understand that other people have goals. But understanding what those goals are is harder. One reason for this is that to understand what someone else wants, you usually have to see things the way they do. And that takes time to learn.\n\nBecause children are still learning this, it can make their relationships with others difficult and people might not understand them. This might be a good time to talk about this a little more.\n\n_Not Understanding Other People's Views_\n\nA man named Piaget was the first one to talk about how hard it is for young children to understand that other people see things differently than they do. He called it 'egocentrism'. He thought that children couldn't understand other people's views until they were seven years old, but other people who have studied this think he was too pessimistic. Even so, young children do have a harder time dealing with other people than adults do, as the following examples will show.\n\nWhen a child under six years old talks to others, they don't always think about what the other person needs to know. The child thinks everyone knows what they know. So, they only talk about the new and interesting things. This can be hard to understand if you don't know what they're talking about.\n\nIn a simple test, children from three to six years old had to pick a gift for their mom, show a picture upside down to someone else, and tell if a stick was soft or pointy. Half of the three-year-olds could not do these things. But most of the six-year-olds could do them all.\n\nOne three-year-old gave his mom a toy truck for her birthday. This is like a little boy who tried to get his knife back from his mom by giving her his teddy bear.\n\nDuring these years, a child is learning more about their mom. Slowly, they learn how to plan to make their mom act a certain way towards them.\n\nA study by Light shows that a child learns to understand others faster if their mom considers their point of view. More details are in the next chapter.\n\nIt's important to remember that being egocentric is different from being egotistical. A child is not more selfish than an adult. Recent studies show that a child cares a lot about others and tries to help. But, sometimes, a child's help is not what you want. When a child tries to help someone, they sometimes don't know what the best thing to do is. They try to understand what is good from the person's point of view.\n\nIf we think more about this, we have to ask big and hard questions about how a child slowly builds their own 'world'. We think this starts at the end of their first year and is very active in the second and third year when they learn to talk. A child is busy making simple ideas about how the world works, how their mom and other important people act, how they should act, and how everyone interacts with each other. They use these simple ideas to understand their situation and make their plans. And they use the ideas of their mom and themselves to understand special parts of their situation and make their attachment plans.\n\nHow these simple ideas are made and how they influence the way a child sees and evaluates things, how good they are for planning, how true or wrong they are, and what helps or hinders their growth, are all very important for understanding how attachment behavior changes as children grow up. But, these are big problems and big disagreements, so we will think about them later. In the next parts of this book, we will look at related facts and make a concept framework to fit them.\n\n_Working Together and Conflict_\n\nOnce a child's attachment behavior is mainly based on a goal, the relationship between a child and their mom becomes more complex. True teamwork between the two becomes possible, but so does hard conflict.\n\nWhen any two people are working together and each can make plans, they might share a common goal and a common plan. When they do, the interaction becomes different. It's best to call this a partnership. By sharing a common goal and working on a plan together, partners feel good about their common purpose; and they are likely also to identify with each other.\n\nBut partnership comes at a cost. Since each partner has their own goals to achieve, working together is only possible if one is ready to give up or adjust their own goals to suit the other's.\n\nWho does the adjusting depends on many things. In the case of a regular mom-child pair, each is likely to adjust a lot to suit the other, though each at times is also likely to insist on their own way. But in a happy partnership, there is constant give and take.\n\nEven when friends like each other, they may not always want the same things. This is normal. Sometimes, a mom might say yes to what her kid wants, but sometimes she might say no. For example, she might tell her kid to stay in his room when she has friends over, or to stay close to her when they are in a store. Sometimes, she might ask him nicely, or maybe offer a treat if he does what she asks. This is how a mom tries to guide her kid's behavior.\n\nJust like his mom, the kid also tries to change her behavior. He might want her to play with him or to leave him alone. As he grows up, he becomes more independent and begins to understand things better. For example, he might be okay with his mom going out because he knows when she will be back. This makes him feel safe even when his mom is not around.\n\nBy the time a kid is four years old, he understands that his mom will be there for him when he needs her. But when he is two years old, he might not understand this yet.\n\n_The Balance of Caring_\n\nA question that moms and others often ask is how much a mom should give in to her kid's demands. If a mom always says yes to her kid, will he become too demanding? Will he think she should always do what he wants? And will he ever learn to do things on his own? How much should a mom care for her kid?\n\nThe question is like asking 'How much food is good for a child?' The answer is simple. It's best to follow what a child wants. When he wants more food, it's good for him; when he says no, it's okay. As long as he is healthy, a child can decide how much and what kind of food he wants. So, a mom can let him choose most of the time.\n\nThe same is true about love and care, especially when a child is very young. In a normal family where a mom takes care of her child, it's good for him when she gives him as much time and attention as he wants. So, like with food, a young child can decide how much love and care he wants. When he is older and goes to school, it's okay to slowly teach him to be more independent.\n\nIt's hard to know how much a parent should encourage a child to be independent, and at what age and in what situations. This needs more study. In some places, parents might push their children too hard too soon; in others, maybe not enough. During the early years, it's best when a mom understands her child's needs and responds to them right away. If she does this, her child will be happy and their relationship will be good. But if she doesn't understand or respond to her child's needs, or if she gives him something he doesn't want, problems can happen.\n\nThere are many kinds of problems with love and care. In my opinion, the most common problems in the Western world are caused by not enough care, or care from too many different people. Problems from too much care are less common. They happen, not because a child wants too much love and attention, but because his mom feels a need to give him too much. Instead of following her child's lead, an over-caring mom takes charge all the time. She always wants to be close to her child, to keep his attention or to keep him safe, just like a mom who overfeeds her child always wants to give him food. In later chapters, a lot of attention is given to the problems caused by a parent acting this way.\n\nOther problems with love and care can be caused by the way a child is cared for being twisted or wrong. This place is not the right one to talk more about how we make friends; in a few lines, it could be too simple.\n\nThis is a short part and not enough for its topic. The things we are touching on are not only very interesting but they are what make us different from animals. Our ability to talk and use other signs, our ability to make plans and build things, our ability to work with others for a long time and to argue, these make us what we are. All these things start during the first three years of life, and all of them are used in the way we make friends. So, is there nothing more to say than this about how we make friends during the second and third years of life?\n\nIn the first version of this book, I answered my question by guessing that there was probably not much more and also saying that the least studied part of human growth was the part where a child is learning all that makes him most like a human. At the end of the book, I pointed to the big area of unknown that still needed to be explored. Since then, many smart people have been exploring. In the parts that follow, I try to tell a few of their findings.\n\nThe tests by Patrick, which have been done again with FR country-speaking children in CA country, and with similar results, by Cameron (1965), show that it's very rare for a child to make a plan before he is seven months old: most children are already eight or nine months, and some are older still. At these ages, and for a few more months, the ability to make plans is just starting and only in the simplest situations (Patrick, 1936, 1937). Frank (1963) has written a complete explanation of and guide to the books by Patrick. Patrick himself does not use the words 'plan' or 'goal', but 'want' and 'wanting'.\n\nSome of the problems that come up when one person tries to change his world by making another person change his goals have been talked about by Matthew (1964). When two people are each trying to change the other's goals, 'it may become hard to separate the two goals. The people have then gotten a relationship where they have partly become one.' See also Henry (1979).\n\nCurrent ideas about how things change over time, using the survival of parts in our body (see Chapter 3), suggest that some amount of arguing becomes unavoidable between mother and child as the child gets older (Thomas, 1974). What this would mean if we applied these ideas to the special case of the human family is yet to be found out.\nPart V\n\nOLD DISAGREEMENTS AND NEW THINGS FOUND\n_Chapter 18_\n\nKeeping and changing friend patterns\n\nThe best way to learn about stars is to think of the night sky as a little group of stars that belong to your own home.\n\nGE person\n\nMore about babies who are friends in a safe or worried way\n\nIn chapter 16, we talk about how Mary can see if a baby of 12 months is safely or worriedly friends with their mom. We believe this is important because babies who are friends in these ways behave in a similar way at home. Also, being safe or worried is related to trust or not trust, something long talked about by doctors. The way a baby is friends with their mom is strongly related to how the mom treats him. This matches what many children's doctors have seen and suggests a helpful relationship.\n\nToday, we believe this way of seeing is even more important because we found that if a family's home stays the same, these friend ways are likely to stay during the second year of life and also the next years. They match, as we thought they would, with ways of being social and playing with adults and children other than mom. So, we finally have a way to see those parts of personality that keep growing, which was hard to find before.\n\nEvidence that Mary's way of seeing gives stable assessments for most babies between 12 and 18 months comes from studies by C person (1976, quoted by Mary and others, 1978) and W person (1978). C person saw 47 babies at 12 months and again at 18 months and found that the friend way at the two ages was the same for 81 per cent of the babies. In the study by W person of 50 babies 96 per cent were found to show the same pattern.\n\nEvidence that the friend way a baby shows at twelve months predicts his social and exploring behavior many months later comes first from an early study in BA city (M person, 1973; M person and T person, 1982) in which it was found that, when babies seen on the strange situation at 12 months were given a chance nine months later to play freely and play with a stranger adult, those seen earlier as safely friends played for a longer time in each play episode, showed more interest in toys and paid more attention to detail, and they laughed or smiled more often than did those seen earlier as avoidant or ambivalent. In addition, the safe babies were more cooperative, both with mom and with other people (L person and M person, 1981), a finding confirmed in another group, in MI city, by M person, A person and S person (1978). In yet a third group, in BE city, M person and W person (1981) looked at the responses of babies to an adult who first tried to play with the baby and later showed distress. The little kids we said were safe before were ready to play and some were worried when the grown-up was upset. But the little kids we said were not safe before did not want to play. In another look at this (by Waters, Wippman and Sroufe, 1979), kids who were safe or scared at 15 months, using video tapes made by W. Bronson, were seen again at 3 years in preschool. In this place, with no mommies, kids who were safe at 15 months were better at playing, more curious and kinder to other upset kids, than those who were not safe before. So, by preschool age, the good ways of the safe kids have become a part of the kid and, as we thought, do not need mommy to be there.\n\nEven though what we found so far is only from 12 to 42 months old, it is very important because we found, reported by Arend, Gove and Sroufe (1979) that the same kind of difference between kids, safe or scared before, keep showing up during their fifth and sixth years. Since as a kid grows up, we need different ways and scales to get important information, a short talk about those used is needed: they were made by Jack and Jeanne Block (1980).\n\nUsing information gathered during the thirty years covered by the two famous Berkeley long studies and also from a number of their own studies, the Blocks have made two parts of personality which they think to be of social and clinical value and also to be stable over time. One they call ego-control, the other ego-resilience. Ego-control changes from over-control, through moderate-control to under-control, with the best in the middle. Ego-resilience changes from high to low, or brittle, with the best at the high end.\n\nSome things of the over-controlled person are held back and stopped responses, less showing of feeling, and narrow limit of the information used. Some things of the under-controlled person are acting fast, easily distracted, open showing of feeling, and too little limit on the information used.\n\nEgo-resilience talks about a person's ability to change his level of control according to things around him. Some things of the highly resilient person is being good at adapting to changing things, a flexible use of his behaving ways, and an ability to process different and conflicting information. By contrast, a brittle person shows little flexibility and responds to changing and stressful situations either by keeping rigidly in his original response or else by becoming disorganised. Different and conflicting information makes him very worried.\n\nIn making their procedures to see ego-control and ego-resilience the Blocks use data from two main sources: (a) the looks of teachers who have known the children well in preschool, recorded by means of a Q-sort, (b) the performance of the children in a large group of lab tests. People make lists of data from many different places and put together similar data. This makes their lists better and more real than a list from one place.\n\nThey show how useful their ideas are by studying boys and girls, people of different ages, and different groups. They get information by watching, testing and asking people (Block and Block, 1980). In a long study of over 100 kids of different backgrounds, starting at three years and still going on, they found that their ideas are good at predicting how the kids will be when they are seven.\n\nA long study by Arend and others (1979) looked at kids from 18 months to 5 years old. Out of a group of babies, 26 were found when they were 4 or 5 years old: 12 were safe and happy and 14 were worried. Now, three or four years later, all these kids were at nursery school or a day-care centre. Two ways to check their happy and control feelings were used: one by a teacher who knew the child for at least 8 months, the other a part of the Blocks' lab tests. Results were as expected. Happy feelings were higher for the 12 safe kids than for the 14 worried kids. For control feelings, the safe kids were ok, 8 of the worried kids had too much control and 6 had too little control. (Lab tests showed no differences.) Another thing they found was that, on three different ways of measuring curiosity, the safe kids scored higher than the worried kids.\n\nOne thing to remember is that these five-year-olds were checked in school and lab, without their mom. So, the safe kids were shown to be ok without their mom. For more studies like this, see Sroufe (1979).\n\nResults of another long study agree with these findings, and talk about what they mean for helping and teaching kids, are also reported by Sroufe (1982).\n\nThe way kids attach: from changing to stable\n\nThere is a lot of evidence that in the first year or two the way kids attach is more about the couple the child is with than the child himself. But as time goes on, the way the child attaches becomes more stable. When things stay the same, it gets harder to change them. \n\nWe know that how a child feels about their parents can change from different studies. In some studies where everything is good at home, the child feels the same about their parents for a long time. But in families where things are harder, the child's feelings can change. In one study of 100 children from these harder families, the child's feelings changed in one third of them after six months. Sometimes it changed for the better, sometimes for the worse. When the child's feelings changed from good to worried, their moms had more hard things happen to them. When the child's feelings changed from worried to good, sometimes it was because a grandma helped. \n\nIn another study, children can feel different about their mom and dad. They studied sixty children and found that how a child feels about their mom is usually the same as how they feel about their dad. But when they looked at each child, they saw that how a child feels about mom does not always match how they feel about dad. The child's feelings about mom and dad can affect how they act with new people and new things. Children who feel good about both parents are most sure of themselves. Children who do not feel good about either parent are least sure. And children who feel good about one parent but not the other are in the middle.\n\nWe have evidence that the way a child feels about their parents is really important. There is a lot of evidence that shows this. In one study, babies who had moms that took care of them when they cried, cried less at the end of the year. But babies who had moms that let them cry, cried more at the end of the year. So, while the mom's behavior stayed the same, the baby's behavior changed.\n\nThere's a new study by Ethan, David, and Samuel (see Samuel, 1982) that says there's a strong connection between how sensitive a mom is in the early months and how the baby acts at one year old. In this study, they also measured how the baby acts when it's just born; but this didn't explain the very different ways babies act at one year old.\n\nThe big effects of a kid's early experiences on how they act and grow up are very clear in kids who have been hurt by a parent or who have lived in a big house with lots of other kids.\n\nGabriel and Matthew (1979) watched ten little kids between one and three years old who had been hurt and compared how they acted in day care with ten other kids from families with problems. The hurt kids acted out more often, like hitting other kids, bothering and threatening to hit the adults taking care of them, and not wanting to play with other kids or acting unsure about it. In these ways, the kids tend to be by themselves and make the adults who could help them not like them, which keeps going in a cycle. We see similar behaviors in kids who avoid others in regular samples and this is connected to a mom not liking to touch her baby and acting mad towards him (Matthew and William, 1982). These findings show well how each person is affecting the other and how their current way of acting with each other comes from their past together.\n\nThomas and Henry (1978) report on how 51 kids acted at eight years old, all of whom had lived in a big house with lots of other kids for their first two years. Half had been adopted, 20 before they were four years old and another 5 after that. (Of the other 26, 13 had gone back to their parents, 6 had been taken care of by other families and 7 had stayed in the big house.) Of the 25 adopted kids, 20 seemed to have a close loving relationship with their new parents; but 5, a small group, had not. At school at least half of all these kids who were adopted late were very troublesome. They were restless, fought a lot, didn't listen, didn't like being told off, and seemed to really want attention from teachers and strangers.\n\nWhether or not a kid felt close to his adoptive parents depended a lot on how they treated him. The more they accepted his need for attention and care, and the more time they spent with him, the more he felt close to them. The kids who were not adopted showed the same clear connection. As expected, the kids who didn't feel close were more likely to be 'too friendly' than the ones who did. Even so, many of the kids who were said to be very close to their mom were also very friendly to everyone. The way kids feel about their friends is really important. Some studies (like the one by Ryan, 1981) show that there is a time when kids are really young when it's easier for them to make strong friendships. After this time, it gets harder for them to change how they make friends. This means that the way a kid makes friends when they're little tends to stay the same as they grow up. This is really important and a lot of people are studying it now.\n\nThe way a kid grows up depends on how they're taken care of, but it also depends on the kid. How a mom treats her baby depends on her personality, her ideas about babies, and her past experiences. It also depends on what's happening now, like how the baby behaves. An easy baby might help a mom who's unsure about how to take care of them. But a difficult baby might make it harder. But studies show that even an easy baby might not grow up well if they're not taken care of well. But, luckily, even a difficult baby can grow up well if they're taken care of well (like in the study by Samuel and Charlie, 1975; David, 1979). A mom who can take care of even a difficult baby well can help them grow up well, and that's really good news.\n\nKids also learn how to understand what other people are thinking. In some parts of this book, we talk about how kids learn to understand that their mom has her own goals and interests that are different from theirs. Some studies (like the one by Matthew and others, 1976) show how kids learn this. When kids turn three, only a few of them can do this. But by the time they turn five, most of them can probably do it. They're most likely to learn this when they're four and five years old.\n\nThomas (1979) talks about what people think about this. He says that some studies have problems. For example, some only look at how kids see things, and only look at things that don't involve people. And they only look at differences between groups of kids of different ages.\n\nThomas studied 56 kids (half boys and half girls) right after they turned four. This is around the time when kids start to learn how to understand what other people are thinking. Each child, who was seen in their own house, was given eight tasks. The most interesting thing is the very big range of scores. So, with a maximum of 40, scores went from 9 to 37, with an average of 22, showing that some four-year-olds can understand different points of view very well while others don't really get it. The big problem of basing ideas on group averages is clear.\n\nSince the group of children tested is part of a bigger study (being done in CE city), there is a lot of other information about the children and their families. This let Liam find out whether scores on understanding different points of view are related to other things about the children or their families. No relation to whether the child was a boy or girl was found nor was there one with what kind of job the father had. Nor did children who spent the most time with friends score higher than the others. When the children's scores were compared with the way a mother described herself as seeing and treating her child, by contrast, strong and consistent relationships were found.\n\nEach mother was given a long talk, lasting one or two hours, in which open-ended questions, mostly related to very specific situations, were asked in a flexible order, ending with some more general questions about her ideas about children and how best to raise them. Mothers of children scoring high on understanding different points of view were different from mothers of children who scored low in the following ways. Mothers of high scorers cared as much about a child's feelings and plans as about his actual behavior and were ready to make fair changes when the situation needed it, whereas mothers of low scorers were more strict. This difference was clearly shown in the answers mothers gave to the question: 'What happens if you ask him to do something for you and he says he can't because he's busy, in the middle of a game or something?' To this a mother of a high scorer might answer: 'If he says he's doing something, I'll say \"do it when you've finished\" and he will'; whereas a mother of a low scorer is more likely to say that she would say: 'you'll do it now\u2014I've told you to do it'. So, mothers of high scorers tend to make changes and to propose deals whereas mother's of low scorers are more likely to give punishment. Children given physical punishment were notably low on understanding different points of view. It is clear, therefore, that a mother who usually takes account of her child's point of view and interests is likely to have a child who gives back by taking account of his mother's point of view and interests\u2014yet another example of the strong effect of a parent and also, we may guess, of learning from an example.\n\nLooking back on his findings, Liam concludes that the difference in children's scores is probably mostly a result of 'the child's general level of _awareness_ of different points of view and of the need to adjust to them', rather than of differences between children of natural origin. When we think an adult is only thinking about themselves, Light says, it's not that they don't know other people might think differently. We think they can understand this, but maybe they're not used to thinking about it or they just don't want to.\n\nLight and others have seen many kids who are four years old and can understand that people have different thoughts. So, we wonder, what is the youngest age that kids start to understand this if their moms help them? A study by Bretherton and Beeghly-Smith gives us some ideas. They looked at 30 kids from families where the parents had good jobs. About a week before her child turned two years and four months, a mom was asked to see if her child used any words from a list and how they used them. The words were about what the child and other people see, feel, want, can do, and think is right or wrong. The moms told the researchers what they noticed.\n\nMost of the kids used words like 'see' and 'hear', and words for feelings like 'cry', 'mad', 'scared', 'fun', 'happy', 'sad', and 'know'. Eight out of ten kids talked about why things happen, mostly things they do to feel better. Almost six out of ten kids used the words to talk about other people too. The researchers found that these kids understand what they and other people think and feel, what they expect to happen, and why they feel a certain way. They think that by the time they are three, kids can understand what other people want and why, especially if their moms are understanding. This makes us wonder if, for people and maybe other animals, it's natural to think about what we and other people feel and want, just like it's natural to understand the world around us.\n\nChapter 19\n\nQuestions, Misunderstandings, and Clearing Things Up\n\nCharles Darwin said that without making guesses, we wouldn't be able to learn from looking at things.\n\nThe Idea of Attachment\n\nIn the twelve years since the first version of this book came out, a lot of people have talked about the idea of attachment. Some people don't think it's a good idea. Some people like this idea and have added more to it. It has helped guide more learning and research. This part of the book is to talk about some of the disagreements, to clear up any confusion and to highlight things I think are important. \n\nOne area of confusion was because I didn't clearly explain the difference between being attached to someone and acting attached. Luckily, this has been fixed by some of my friends, like Madison in some of her books (1969, 1972 and in Chapters 1 and  of her co-written book in 1978). Others who have helped include Benjamin (1975), Samuel and William (1977) and Bella (1980).\n\nWhen we say a child is attached to someone, it means the child really wants to be close to and touch a special person, especially when they are scared, tired or sick. This wanting to act this way is part of the child and doesn't change quickly over time and isn't affected by what's happening right now. Acting attached, on the other hand, is how a child behaves to get and keep the closeness they want. At any time, this behavior can be there or not, depending on what's happening.\n\nThe idea of attachment I'm talking about is trying to explain both the behavior of wanting to be close, which can come and go, and also the long-lasting attachments that children and older people have to special people. In this idea, the main thing is the idea of a behavior system, which chapters 3 to  in this book talk about.\n\nWhen this idea was first suggested as a way to understand how a child behaves with their mom, the idea of a behavior control system was new to people who study how children grow and to doctors who help children. So, it's not surprising that many people who were used to other ideas either didn't understand it or didn't want to try. But, for anyone who knows about how the body works and the idea of balance, there shouldn't be a problem. Whether we're talking about keeping blood pressure or body temperature within certain limits, or any other body measure, the idea needed to explain this is a control system in the body, which works according to the principles talked about earlier in this book.\n\nThe idea of a behavior control system is used to explain how a child keeps their relationship with their special person within certain limits of distance or availability. This is just using what we already know to explain a different kind of balance, one where the limits are about the child's relationship to things in their world and where the limits are kept by behavior instead of by the body. The idea of keeping a child within certain limits in relation to a special person is just one example of what can be called environmental balance. In chapter 5, we talked about how a bird stays close to its nest and eggs, or how an animal stays in its home. \n\nOnce we understand the idea of a system that controls behavior, we realize that the specific actions used to keep the animal or person within certain limits are not that important. They are just different ways to reach the same goal. For example, a child can get to their mom by running, walking, crawling, shuffling, or even rolling if they can't use their arms and legs properly. What's important is that they get to their mom. The different ways of moving are just options, so it's not surprising that they don't always go together. Some people thought that attachment theory would predict this, but they were wrong. This idea was well explained by Sam and William.\n\nThe idea is that a child's behavior towards their mom or dad is controlled by a system inside them. Instead of focusing on the behavior itself, we look at the system that controls it. This system is always working\u2014it's an important part of who the child is. For the system to work well, it needs to be able to sense what's going on around it and make sense of it. In the case of the attachment system, it's looking out for danger or stress, and also keeping track of where mom or dad is. If the child feels scared or sick or insecure, they'll act to get closer to mom or dad. They'll keep going until they feel safe and comfortable again.\n\nWhen the system decides what actions to take, it thinks about the ideas or \"models\" it has of mom or dad, the world around it, and the child themself. These models are already stored in the system. By thinking about these models and how the system uses them, we can understand how a child's experiences with their parents shape the way they form attachments.\n\nBy suggesting that there is a system inside us with very specific features, we can see that this idea has some of the same basic properties as other theories that talk about structures or forms, like the theories of Patrick and Peter. It's different from theories that just talk about behavior. This book talks about how people behave. For example, a child may want to be close to a friend, just like a grown-up may want to be near a friend who likes the same things. But this is not the same as when a child wants to be close to their mom or dad to feel safe. This is called attachment behavior. \n\nIt's not right to say that attachment behavior is only about being close to a certain person. There are ways to tell the difference between wanting to be close to someone because of attachment and wanting to be close to someone for other reasons. Most of the time, these are different situations, with different feelings and actions. Sometimes, it might be hard to tell the difference.\n\nWhen we say that attachment behavior is about feeling safe, we mean that it helps protect the child from danger. For example, in the old days, one big danger was being eaten by wild animals. This idea might be new to some people who study how children grow and learn, and it might not seem important. \n\nBut I think it's very important. How we think about attachment behavior can change how we treat each other. If we see a baby, a child or an adult wanting to be close to someone they like, we should respect that. It's as natural as wanting to eat or wanting to be loved. When a helper meets with someone who is feeling mad, worried or sad because they have lost someone, they see it as normal. Even if it's hard, it's how people react when they are in that situation. The helper then tries to help in any way they can.\n\nBut when we think about these feelings and actions as something that we learn, it looks different. When a baby has just been fed and is crying, it is seen as just wanting attention and picking him up might make him cry more. When a child is upset because his main caretaker is gone and wants her back, he is seen as being spoiled. A teenager or adult who is scared of being left by their caretaker is seen as being too dependent, dramatic or scared. The helper's actions might then be disapproving and not helpful. These thoughts made me wonder if the traditional ways of thinking about learning were useful for understanding these problems. I decided to use a different approach that would be better for understanding the problems that all helpers face, whether they work with children, teenagers or adults.\n\nSome people, like Rajecki and others in a review article (1978), have said that attachment behavior doesn't really protect because sometimes it's directed towards things that don't protect, like a fake mother for monkeys or a favorite blanket or toy for humans. But this isn't a good argument. When the way a young animal is raised is not normal, it's not unusual for them to act towards things that are not appropriate. For example, they might show love behavior towards the same sex, another species, or a thing. But no one would say that because in these cases the behavior doesn't result in having babies, that love behavior itself doesn't have that function.\n\nOne type of bond is the bond between a caregiver and the one being cared for. In this book, we are focusing on this type of relationship. Since people sometimes use the word 'attachment' for other relationships, it's good to be clear about how we are using it here.\n\nFollowing Hinde (1979) and Bretherton (1980), a relationship can be said to exist between two people when both of them have made shared plans of interaction. These relationships can look different. For example, they can be different in the main shared plan and whether both people play similar or different roles in it, in the number of different shared plans, in how well each plan works, in how unique they are, and in how long they are expected to last. So, there are many relationships, like buying things from a shopkeeper, that are likely to be small and short; others, like a work relationship, might be bigger and/or longer; and others, like a family relationship, might not only have a lot of shared plans but also a promise from both people to keep the relationship forever. The word 'friendship' is used for the special bonds between people who really care about each other.\n\nParents and their kids usually have this bond. Even when the kids are very young and don't understand what this means, their parents still believe that they are connected. \n\nLike many other types of bonds, the parent-kid bond works like a team. This means that what a mom does is usually very different from what her kid does. However, they work together well. This makes us think about friendship again.\n\nIn this book, we have been looking at one part of this team, which is the child. The other part is the parent who takes care of the child. Because this bond involves two people, it should be seen as a friendship between the child and the caregiver.\n\nMany people believe that the word friendship should only be used to describe the behavior of the child towards the parent. The parent's behavior towards the child should be called caregiving. If we use these words, we can say that both the child and the parent are bonded. Friendship is then only used for the behavior usually directed towards someone who is seen as stronger; while caregiving is used for the behavior directed towards someone who is seen as weaker. In most friendships between a caregiver and a child, the roles do not change. \n\nHowever, roles can change in some situations. For example, in marriages, it is normal and healthy for roles to change. Role change can also happen when an adult child takes care of their old parent. But, if a child or a teenager has to take care of their parent for a long time, it is usually a sign that something is not right with the parent and it can also cause problems for the child.\n\nThe study of caregiving as a behavior that is different between moms and dads is an important topic that needs more attention. In another place, I suggest that it will be helpful to study its development in a way similar to how we study the development of friendship behavior. This would mean looking at how it develops as a result of both the natural tendency to develop certain types of behavior and the different environments that the child experiences from infancy onwards.\n\nOne last point needs to be made. A relationship between a mother and a child, or a father and a child, includes more than one shared team. For example, there is also a team for feeding where the behavior of one partner usually works well with the behavior of the other. There are different ways kids play together. Sometimes they do the same thing, sometimes one is the teacher and the other is the learner. For example, a mom or dad and their kid can do many things together, not just take care of each other. That's why we say a child and his mom are close, because they do so many things together. \n\n* * *\n\nTo wrap up, let me explain how a child grows up. When a child has a kind and supportive mom, and later a dad, he feels good about himself. He thinks people are helpful and he learns how to get along with others. He also feels brave to explore and learn about the world around him. As long as his family keeps being nice, these good thoughts and behaviors stay with him. He grows up to be a person who can handle things well and keep going even when things get tough. Sometimes, things that happen when a child is very young can make them less able to handle things well when they grow up. These effects can last a long time. How a person deals with hard things later in life, like being left alone or losing something important, can depend a lot on how they grew up.\n\nIn her writing, Isabel talks about ideas that were not fully explained before.
