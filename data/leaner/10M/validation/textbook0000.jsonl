{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Day and Night Patterns in Our Body\n\nIntroduction:\nDay and night patterns are natural things that happen every day. They help control when we sleep, eat, and how warm or cool our body is. There is a special part in our brain that controls these patterns. In this lesson, we will learn about a special thing in our brain that helps control these patterns.\n\nCore Value:\nThe most important part of this lesson is that there are two types of a special thing in our brain. These two types do not change when it is day or night in a rat that is always in the dark. This shows that the day and night pattern of this special thing in animals that live in day and night is because of the eyes.\n\nSection 1: Learning About Day and Night Patterns\n\nTopic 1: What are day and night patterns?\nDay and night patterns are natural things that happen every day. They help control when we sleep, eat, and how warm or cool our body is.\n\nTopic 2: What is the special part in our brain?\nThe special part in our brain is a group of tiny things called neurons. It helps control the day and night patterns in our body.\n\nSection 2: The Role of the Special Thing in Day and Night Patterns\n\nTopic 1: What is the special thing?\nThe special thing is something that changes one thing into another thing. This other thing helps send messages from one tiny neuron to another.\n\nTopic 2: How does the special thing affect day and night patterns?\nThe special thing is very important in controlling day and night patterns by controlling the making of this other thing. This other thing calms down our nervous system, which helps keep a balance in our brain.\n\nSection 3: The Lesson\n\nTopic 1: What did the lesson show?\nThe lesson showed that the two types of the special thing do not change when it is day or night in a rat that is always in the dark.\n\nTopic 2: Why did the teachers make this lesson?\nThe teachers wanted to find out if the day and night pattern of this special thing in animals that live in day and night was because of the eyes.\n\nSection 4: Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, this lesson shows that the two types of the special thing do not change when it is day or night in a rat that is always in the dark. This shows that the day and night pattern of this special thing in animals that live in day and night is because of the eyes.\n\nGlossary:\n- Day and night patterns: Natural things that happen every day and control when we sleep, eat, and how warm or cool our body is.\n- Inside our heads is a group of tiny things that help us know when to wake up and when to sleep.\n- Our bodies have special stuff that helps us send messages between the parts of our body.\n- We have tiny things in our eyes that send what we see to our brains.\n\nWhat we are talking about:\nHow does learning this help us every day?

{"text": "\n\nLesson: Understanding Sickness in Deer\n\nIntroduction:\nThere is a sickness that makes deer, elk, and moose very unwell. It is caused by bad stuff in their brains and bodies. This sickness always makes them die, and there is no way to make them better. In this lesson, we will learn about what makes them sick, how it makes them feel, and what it does to all the deer.\n\nSection 1: Learning about the sickness\n\n**Question 1:** What is the sickness in deer?\n\n**Answer 1:** The sickness in deer is a bad thing that happens to their brains and bodies.\n\n**Question 2:** How does the sickness spread?\n\n**Answer 2:** The sickness spreads when deer touch each other or their spit, blood, and pee. It can also spread when they eat food or drink water that has the sickness.\n\n**Question 3:** How does the sickness make deer feel?\n\n**Answer 3:** The sickness makes deer lose weight, stumble, breathe hard, and drink and pee a lot. Deer with the sickness might also act strange, like being very grumpy or mean.\n\nSection 2: What the sickness does to all the deer\n\n**Question 4:** What does the sickness do to all the deer?\n\n**Answer 4:** The sickness can make fewer baby deer be born, make more deer die, and change how deer act with each other. In places where lots of deer have the sickness, there might be fewer deer because the sickness hurts them a lot.\n\n**Question 5:** How does the sickness change the place where deer live?\n\n**Answer 5:** The sickness can change the place where deer live because deer help keep everything in balance. For example, if there are fewer deer, there might be more of the plants that deer don't eat, and this could change what other animals eat.\n\nSection 3: Stopping the sickness in deer\n\n**Question 6:** How can we stop the sickness in deer?\n\n**Answer 6:** We don't know how to stop the sickness in deer, but we can do things to make it less likely to spread. This talks about how to take care of deer and keep them safe. We should not move deer from one place to another. We should also not use food to catch them.\n\n**Question 7:** How do we keep deer safe?\n\n**Answer 7:** Keeping deer safe is not easy. We don't have any way to make them better if they get sick. We try to stop the sickness from spreading and help the deer as much as we can. This can include watching the deer, not letting them move around too much, and learning more about the sickness.\n\nWords to know:\n- Sickness: When someone or something is not feeling well.\n- Spread: When something moves from one place to another.\n- Plants-eater: An animal that eats mostly plants.\n\nIn the end:\nIn this lesson, we learned about a sickness that can hurt deer. We learned how it affects them and how we can stop it. We also learned how the sickness can change the way plants and animals live together. By learning about this, we can help keep the deer safe and keep everything in nature in balance.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 2895, "idx": 33490, "original text": "Feb. 25, 2014\n\nLoading Photo Galleries ...\n\nWritten by\n\nFor Wisconsinoutdoorfun.com\n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:\n\nTami Ryan, DNR Wildlife Health section chief, 608-266-3143\n\nMore\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMADISON \u2014 Through 12 years of ongoing surveillance efforts, Department of Natural Resources officials are able to maintain a current picture of trends and prevalence of chronic wasting disease within the area previously known as the CWD management zone in southern Wisconsin.\n\nBased on 2013 test results for the western monitoring area, encompassing western Dane and Eastern Iowa counties where sampling has been occurring annually since the disease was discovered, current prevalence is near 25 percent for adult male white-tailed deer, 10 percent for adult female deer, about 7 percent in yearling males and about 6 percent in yearling females. Prevalence has increased in all categories.\n\n\"Sampling deer from these areas where there has been long-term monitoring of disease patterns is important to understanding the dynamics of this disease,\" said Tami Ryan, DNR Wildlife Health section chief. \"Prevalence has been increasing as expected, and we continue to find that prevalence is higher in males than females and higher in adults than yearlings.\"\n\nFor 2013, DNR staff tested deer from within and outside of the CWD-MZ in south central and southeastern Wisconsin. The sampling strategies were aimed at detecting changes in the location and trends in prevalence of the disease. Monitoring plans focused surveillance on adult deer, which are most likely to have the disease.\n\nBeginning in 2014, with the approval of the Deer Trustee Report rule package, DNR will have a new funding source available beginning this fall to provide hunter service testing statewide. The funding comes from having the authority to apply $5 from each additional antlerless deer permit sale in CWD-affected counties towards CWD testing and monitoring.\n\n\"Prior to this change, DNR received no money from additional permits sales. We are pleased to now have a consistent funding stream for CWD testing and monitoring,\" said Ryan.\n\nAlso emerging from the rule is the Deer Management Assistance Program and the formation of county deer committees, both of which give DNR flexibility to work locally to develop cooperative approaches to disease surveillance and management.\n\n\"It's important to be able to work cooperatively with hunters and landowners, as their participation is essential to CWD surveillance,\" said Ryan. \"It's also very important that we connect with the local communities so they can stay informed on deer disease and DNR's approach to monitoring. They are also the conduit for public sentiment, sharing information with us in addition to taking information back to their community.\"\n\nMore information on CWD or details on 2013 sampling and prevalence is available at dnr.wi.gov, search keyword \"CWD.\"", "hash": "8bc31ae7c97744799479da006d995c6ed0e0db0b808772ee5a79d88a99130a43"}

{"text": "Lesson: Understanding How We Sort Plants\n\nSay Hi:\nPlants are sorted based on how they look, where they live, and what they are made of. In this lesson, we will learn about how we sort plants and why it helps us understand how different plants are related.\n\nSection 1: Sorting Plants\n\nTopic 1: What is sorting plants?\nSorting plants is how we group plants that are alike. This helps people understand how different plants are related and helps them sort plants into different groups.\n\nTopic 2: How do we group plants?\nWe group plants using a way called the plant grouping system, made by a person named Carl. This way splits plants into seven big groups called classes. These classes are split into smaller groups.\n\nTopic 3: Why is grouping plants important?\nGrouping plants is important because it helps people understand how different plant types are related and how they changed over time. This information can be used to study how plants change, their life, and where they live.\n\nPart 2: Grouping Plants in Real Life\n\nTopic 1: How do we use plant grouping in everyday life?\nWe use plant grouping in many ways every day. For example, when you go to a plant store to buy plants, the plants often have their science names so that you can be sure you are getting the right plant for what you need.\n\nTopic 2: How does grouping plants help protect them?\nUnderstanding how different plant types are related can help people know which plants need to be protected. By studying plant grouping, we can make plans to protect plants that are in danger and the places they live.\n\nPart 3: Practice Questions\n\nQuestion 1: Which group do plants with flowers belong to?\nAnswer: Plants with flowers belong to a group.\n\nQuestion 2: What is the name for the common daisy?\nAnswer: The name for the common daisy is a daisy.\n\nFinish:\nIn this lesson, we learned about grouping plants and how it is used in everyday life and to protect plants.

They play a big role in keeping children safe from bad things. In the story of Alice, helpers knew about problems at her home. But, they could not help before she got very sick.\n\nQuestions for Discussion:\n- What is the role of helpers in keeping children safe?\n- How do helpers become part of a child's life?\n- What things can stop them from being able to help in bad situations?\n\nSection 2: Understanding Things to Make Good Choices\nThinking hard is very important for making good choices. It involves understanding things, spotting patterns, and making conclusions based on clues. In the story of Alice, helpers had worries about her but could not act. This makes us question how good their help methods are and if they need to talk and work together more.\n\nQuestions for Discussion:\n- How can we get better at thinking hard to make good choices?\n- What role do clues play in making our choices?\n- How can we make sure we are thinking about all important information when making choices?\n\nSection 3: Using Skills to Solve New Problems\nThe skills we learn in understanding things and making good choices can be used for many problems. For example, we can use thinking hard to check if sources of information are trustworthy, spot patterns of behavior, and make conclusions based on clues. These skills are very important for making good choices in all parts of life, from friendships to picking jobs.\n\nQuestions for Discussion:\n- How can we use the skills we learn in this lesson in other parts of our lives?\n- What are some examples of situations where thinking hard and understanding information would be useful?\n- How can we get better at these skills over time to become better problem solvers?\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, this lesson has shown how important helpers are in keeping children safe. We have also talked about the need for thinking hard and understanding information to make good choices. By using these skills for new problems, we can become better at solving problems and make better choices in all parts of our lives.\n\nGlossary:\n- Helpers: groups that give help and support to people and families who need it\n- Problems at home: bad things caused by a family member or someone living with you\n- Helping: doing something to keep someone safe or fix a problem\n- Thinking: looking at things, seeing patterns, and making ideas about what you see\n\nReferences:\n- BB News.

{"text": "Lesson Title: Wind Power - Good and Clean Energy\n\nBeginning:\nWind power is a good and clean energy that people have used for a long time. It is a clean and never-ending source of energy that can help us use less bad energy. In this lesson, we will learn about wind power, why it's good, and how it works.\n\nPart 1: What is Wind Power?\n\nWind power is a kind of never-ending energy that comes from changing the moving power of the wind into electric power. The wind makes the blades of a wind machine spin, which makes a machine make electricity.\n\nGood Things About Wind Power:\n- Wind power is a clean and never-ending source of energy that does not make bad air or other bad things.\n- Wind power is never-ending and can be got from all over the world.\n- Wind power can help us use less bad energy and make less bad air.\n\nPart 2: How does Wind Power Work?\n\nWind machines are made to catch the moving power of the wind and change it into electric power. The wind makes the blades of the machine spin, which makes a machine make electricity. The electricity made by the wind machine can then be used to make light and power for homes, businesses, and other things.\n\nHow Wind Machines Work:\n- Wind machines have long blades that are made to catch the power of the wind.\n- When the wind blows, it makes the blades spin, which makes a machine inside the machine.\n- The machine changes the moving power of the wind into electric power, which is then sent through lines to homes and businesses.\n\nPart 3: Real Examples of Wind Power\n\nWind power is being used in many parts of the world to make electricity.

{"text": "Lesson: How to Make Little Trinkets\n\nIntroduction:\nMaking little trinkets is a fun way to create things like necklaces, bracelets, rings, and earrings. In this lesson, we will learn about the stuff we need to make trinkets, and how to make a simple trinket.\n\nMaterials:\n- Beads (like glass ones, rock ones, metal ones, and others)\n- Chain (like gold, silver, and others)\n- Clasps (like locking ones, spring ring ones, and others)\n- Small beads that we can squeeze\n- Jump rings\n- Wire (like gold-filled, silver, and others)\n- Pliers (like round nose, chain-nose, and others)\n- Pliers that we can use to squeeze things\n- Flat nose pliers\n- Hammer\n- Saw\n- Mandrel\n\nTools:\n- Bead board\n- Measuring tape\n- Scale\n- Tweezers\n\nSteps:\n1. Think about your trinket: Start by drawing your trinket on paper or using a computer program to make a picture of your trinket. Think about the kind of trinket you want to make (like a necklace, bracelet, ring, and others), the stuff you will use, and how big and what shape the beads or rocks will be.\n\n2. Get your stuff: Once you know what you want to make, get all the stuff you need. This may include beads, chain, clasps, small beads that we can squeeze, jump rings, wire, and any other things you need.\n\n3. Cut the chain: Use a saw or chain-nose pliers to cut the chain to the right size. Check the size of the chain and use a scale to make sure it's right.\n\n4. Put on the clasp: Connect one end of the chain to the clasp using jump rings. Make sure the clasp is tightly attached and will not fall off when worn.\n\n5. Put on beads or rocks: Put the beads or rocks on the chain using wire or thread. Use small beads that we can squeeze to keep the wire or thread in place and stop the beads from falling off the chain.\n\n6. Finish the trinket: Once the beads or rocks are on, use pliers that we can use to squeeze things to connect the ends of the wire or thread to the small beads that we can squeeze. Use chain-nose pliers to squeeze the small beads that we can squeeze and make sure they are tightly connected.\n\n7. Make it shiny and smooth: Use a cloth or steel wool to make the trinket shiny and smooth and get rid of any rough parts or things that are not perfect.\n\nConclusion:\nIn this lesson, we learned about the stuff we need to make trinkets, and how to make a simple trinket. By following these steps and practicing, you can make pretty and unique trinkets that show your creativity and style.\n\nGlossary:\n- Bead board: A board used for putting beads in order while working on trinket projects.\n- Mandrel: A tool used for making wire into loops or spirals.\n- Measuring tape: A bendy ruler we use to see how long things are.\n- Scale: A tool we use to see how heavy things are.\n- Tweezers: A tool we use to pick up tiny things.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 1016, "idx": 20574, "original text": "Moss Follows.

They think it's important to believe in Jesus and to have faith.\n\n### Section 2: History of Simple Churches\n\nSimple Churches started a long time ago. Some people in a church started to think it was important to believe in Jesus and to read the Bible. This idea spread across many places a long time ago.\n\nIn the old times, Simple Churches became more common, thanks to Adam, who helped build a big church in NE city. Since then, Simple Churches have spread to many places around the world.\n\n### Section 3: What do Simple Churches Believe and Do?\n\nSimple Churches believe in many things like other churches. They believe in the Bible, they think it's important to believe in Jesus and to have faith, and they think we need to be saved by Jesus. But they also have some special things, like they use a special way to worship and they are connected to other Simple Churches.\n\nSimple Churches usually follow a special calendar, which includes daily prayers and weekly services. They also use a special book for their worship, while still focusing on reading the Bible.\n\n### Words to Remember\n\n- Simple Churches: A big group of churches that believe in the same things, like reading the Bible and believing in Jesus.\n- Believers: A word used to describe people who believe in the Bible, think it's important to believe in Jesus and to have faith, and think we need to be saved by Jesus.\n- Worship: A special way to show love to God used by a church.\n- Protestants: A word used to describe people who believe in the Bible and don't follow the Pope or the Catholic Church.\n\n### Wrapping Up\n\nIn this lesson, we learned about Simple Churches, their history, what they believe, and what they do. We also learned about their special way to worship and how important it is to believe in Jesus and to have faith.

He raised public subscriptions to pay for the construction on a site close to his home of Newland Grove at a cost of \u00a31,650. The church was consecrated by the Archbishop of York on 23 September 1833.\n\nThe original building was of a simple box construction with a balcony at the rear. It could house a congregation of around 500, which at the time was about the population of the local area, although average attendance was closer to 100.\n\nInitially, Saint Jack\u2019s was a daughter church to Saint Mary\u2019s in Cottingham, and services were held on Sunday afternoons to accommodate the ministers\u2019 schedules. Avison Terry, not being satisfied with this less than ideal arrangement, set out to raise further money so that St Jack\u2019s could have a minister of its own. In October 1862, The Reverend Jack Pickford was selected by Reverend Charles Overton of St Mary\u2019s Cottingham. In 1863, the vicarage at St Jack\u2019s was completed, as well as a parish school, again by funds raised by Avison Terry.\n\nAvison Terry died in 1866, and was buried in the vaults which then existed beneath the church. Later modifications to the building removed the vaults and his grave is now found in the churchyard close to the south side of the church building.\n\nIn 1881 the Reverend Joseph Malet Lambert was appointed vicar of Saint Jack\u2019s, and remained with the church for 30 years. He was instrumental in expanding the original building and added the chancel to the east in 1893. In 1902 more significant works were carried out, extending the nave westward, removing the balcony and adding a north aisle separated from the nave by an arcade of six stone arches. The burials in the vaults were removed to the churchyard and the floor level lowered, and the windows changed from a tall narrow design to wider arched structures. \n\nA creche and office rooms were added to the west end in 1958, and the exterior of the building remains much as it was then.\n\nIn 2013, the fixed pews were removed and the seating arrangements turned 90 degrees. A screen, projector, cameras for streaming the services and a new sound system were installed blending the original architecture with 21st\u00a0century congregational needs and evangelical belief and practice.\n\nPresent day \nThe present day incumbent, the Reverend Melvin Tinker, was installed as Vicar in 1994. He was one of the founding members of the Evangelical group REFORM and is a well-known international speaker and author.\n\nThe church of over 500 people (including 100 children) is known for having a strong Bible expository ministry and has developed various evangelistic tools to foster Gospel outreach. The congregations are multi-ethnic and diverse in composition with a vibrant student work linked to the neighbouring Hull University. The leadership team includes two associate ministers, the Reverend Scott Mackay and the Reverend Peter Birnie.\n\nThe parish church of St Jack\u2019s has the daughter churches of St Faith\u2019s, Dunswell, and Riverside Church expressing the vision of being \u2018one church- multiple congregations\u2019.\n\nSt Jack\u2019s has connections with REACH South Africa, \u00a0George Whitefield College in Cape Town, Champion Forest Baptist Church in Houston, Texas, and the Lanier Theological Library, Houston, Texas. It is also a member of GAFCON.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nExternal links\n\n St Jack Newland (official site)\n\nCategory:Diocese of York\nCategory:Church of England church buildings in the East Riding of Yorkshire\nCategory:Churches in Kingston upon Hull\nCategory:Grade II listed churches in the East Riding of Yorkshire\nCategory:Conservative evangelical Anglican churches in England", "hash": "0c29426e6198611d0a018974b5fc21914971bdfd74119d0c7a585914830a158a"}

{"text": "Story: Learning about Plant Food\n\n## Chapter 1: What is Plant Food?\nPlant food is something we add to dirt to help plants grow. It gives plants things they need to grow big and strong. The three main things plants need are called N-P-K.\n\n## Chapter 2: Why do Plants Need Plant Food?\nPlants need plant food because they can't make their own food. They use the things in the dirt to grow. Without these things, plants can't make the energy they need to live.\n\n## Chapter 3: Kinds of Plant Food\nThere are many kinds of plant food. Some come from things like animal waste or plants. Others are made from stuff that's not from nature and are often used on big farms.\n\n## Chapter 4: How Does Plant Food Work?\nPlant food works by giving plants the things they need to grow. When plants take in these things through their roots, they use them to make energy and new parts. The kind of plant food used can change how fast a plant grows and how much it makes.\n\n## Chapter 5: Buying and Selling Plant Food in IN Country\nIn the last few years, more people in IN country have wanted to buy plant food because there are more farms. But, some things have changed that have made buying and selling plant food different. For example, the people who make the rules have started a plan to give less help for buying plant food, which has made the price go up.\n\n## Chapter 6: IN Country Among Other Countries\nIN country makes a lot of plant food compared to other countries in the same area. But, there are also many other countries that make and use plant food. These countries include CH country, JA country, AU country, and SO country. Each of these countries has different things going on that can change how much plant food they make and use.\n\n## The End\nPlant food is a big part of farming and is very important for helping plants grow. Knowing about the different kinds of plant food and how they work can help farmers decide which plant food to use and when to use it. By looking at how buying and selling plant food in IN country has changed, we can understand better how these things affect how much plant food is made and used in the area.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 516, "idx": 385040, "original text": "This report discusses fertilizer demand in India for the years 2005 and 2010, with forecasts for 2015.

{"text": "Lesson Title: Removing Sticky Stuff from Black Stones\n\nIntroduction:\nBlack stones are often used to clean up messes, as they can stick to messy things and stop them from getting into our bodies. However, some stuff, like sticky stuff, can be tough to get off the black stones. In this lesson, we'll learn about how to get sticky stuff off black stones and how washing the whole tummy can help this process.\n\nSection 1: Removing Sticky Stuff from Black Stones\n\nQuestion: What does it mean to remove sticky stuff from black stones?\nAnswer: Removing sticky stuff from black stones means letting the sticky stuff come off the black stones. This can happen when things change, like how warm or cold it is, or if other stuff is around.\n\nQuestion: How does washing the whole tummy help get the sticky stuff off black stones?\nAnswer: Washing the whole tummy, which uses a special wash, can change how sticky stuff sticks to black stones. This can make more sticky stuff come off the black stones.\n\nSection 2: Sticky Stuff Sticking and Coming Off\n\nQuestion: How does sticky stuff stick to black stones?\nAnswer: Sticky stuff sticks to black stones through a process called sticking. This happens when sticky stuff sticks to the outside of the black stones, stopping them from getting into our bodies.\n\nQuestion: How does sticky stuff come off black stones?\nAnswer: Sticky stuff comes off black stones when it comes off the outside of the black stones. This can happen when things change, like how warm or cold it is, or if other stuff is around.\n\nSection 3: Sticky Stuff Coming Off Experiment\n\nQuestion: How was the experiment made to see if the special wash changes how sticky stuff sticks to black stones?\nAnswer: The experiment was made to shake sticky stuff with black stones in either water or the special wash, at each of three black stones:sticky stuff amounts (1:1, 3:1, and 10:1). How much was in the leftover water was found out by a special machine, and the most amount of sticky stuff that black stones can stick to was figured out from a special math problem.\n\nConclusion:\nIn this lesson, we learned about how to get sticky stuff off black stones and how washing the whole tummy can help this process. We learned about how sticky stuff sticks and comes off, and how these things can be changed by other stuff. Lastly, we looked at an experiment made to see if the special wash changes how sticky stuff sticks to black stones.\n\nGlossary:\n- Black powder: It is a special kind of dust that can clean air and water, and remove bad things from our body.\n- Slippery stuff: A kind of material that is used to help us go to the bathroom and make medicines.\n- Big machine: A big machine that can separate different things based on their size, shape, and what they are made of.\n- Math problem: A special math problem that helps us understand how tiny things stick to a surface.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1999, "idx": 424135, "original text": "Theophylline desorption from activated charcoal caused by whole bowel irrigation solution.\nWhole bowel irrigation with polyethylene glycol electrolyte lavage solution has been recommended as an adjunct to traditional overdose management. Although combined activated charcoal and whole bowel irrigation could enhance the efficacy of both modalities, this improvement remains largely speculative. An in vitro experiment was designed to determine whether polyethylene glycol electrolyte lavage solution alters the adsorption of theophylline to activated charcoal. Theophylline was agitated with activated charcoal in either water or polyethylene glycol electrolyte lavage solution, at each of three activated charcoal:theophylline ratios; 1:1, 3:1, and 10:1. The concentration in the supernatant was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography, and the maximal adsorptive capacity of activated charcoal for theophylline was calculated from the Langmuir equation. The percent of theophylline adsorbed by activated charcoal in water was 16 +/- 4%, 67 +/- 5%, and 97 +/- 3% for the 1:1, 3:1, and 10:1 ratios, respectively. This was decreased to 17 +/- 5%, 37 +/- 3%, and 62 +/- 2% when polyethylene glycol electrolyte lavage solution was added. A statistical difference (p less than 0.05) occurred at the 3:1 and 10:1 activated charcoal:theophylline ratios. Similarly the maximal adsorptive capacity was decreased 23% from 264 mg/g to 203 mg/g when polyethylene glycol electrolyte lavage solution was added to activated charcoal prior to theophylline. Polyethylene glycol electrolyte lavage solution significantly decreases adsorption of theophylline to activated charcoal in vitro. In vivo studies are required to confirm these findings. If activated charcoal is to be used clinically for theophylline toxicity, the authors suggest the possibility of larger quantities of activated charcoal, and administering activated charcoal in a slurry of water before the initiation of whole bowel irrigation.", "hash": "d334e8f9cf5d6cbcf99159adb6b43203bfcf86ee059dacdf72fd5d1e9b9a3bb0"}

This lesson will tell us about this special plan, why it's good, and how we can use it.\nPart 1: What is the Special Plan?\nThe special plan is a way to make sure we always make the best things. It has the following steps:\n1. Find out what makes a thing good.\n2. Find out what we need to do to make a thing good.\n3. Make a plan to make sure we always do what we need to make a thing good.\n4. Make a plan to keep an eye on things that could go wrong and stop them before they do.\nGood Things about the Special Plan:\n1. It makes sure we always make the best things by focusing on what makes a thing good and what we need to do to make a thing good.\n2. It stops things from going wrong by making a good plan.\n3. It keeps people safe by stopping bad things from happening.\n4. It helps us do things the right way by giving us a good plan to follow.\nPart 2: Using the Special Plan to Make Good Things\n1. Find out what makes a thing good: The first step is to find out what makes a thing good. This could be how strong it is, how pure it is, if it's safe, and if it works well.\n2. Find out what we need to do to make a thing good: The next step is to find out what we need to do to make a thing good. This could be things like the temperature, pressure, how sour or sweet something is, and how much of something we use.\n3. Make a plan: Once we know what makes a thing good and what we need to do to make a thing good, we need to make a plan to make sure we always do these things. We can use special tools and plans to help us do this.\n4. Make a plan to keep an eye on things: Finally, we need to make a plan to keep an eye on things that could go wrong and stop them before they do. This might mean using tools to find out what could go wrong, like looking for mistakes and their effects.\nPart 3: A Real Example\nLet's think about making a special medicine to help people with a bad sickness. The important things for this medicine might be how well it works to beat the sickness, how clean it is, if it is safe, and if it helps people get better.\nThe things that might matter for making this medicine could be how the medicine is made, like how warm it is, if the water is just right, and if it has enough food.\nTo make sure everything goes right, the people making the medicine might use special tools to keep an eye on how it's made and other tools to see how well the medicine works and how clean it is.\nIn the end, they have to have a plan to find out what could go wrong, like if the medicine gets dirty or if it could make people feel bad, and have ways to stop these things from happening.\nIn the end:\nSo, this way of doing things is a good way to make sure the medicine works well. By looking at the important things and how the medicine is made, this way can help the people making the medicine make sure it works well all the time. By having a plan to stop bad things from happening, they can find and stop things that might make the medicine not work well.\nWords to Remember:\n- Important Things: Things that show if the medicine is good.\n- Things That Matter: Things that can change the Important Things.\n- A Good Way: A way to make the medicine work well.\n- Special Tools: Tools used to watch and keep things right.\n- Other Tools: Tools used to see and make sure the medicine is good.\n- Plan to Stop Bad Things: A plan to find, look at, and stop things that could make the medicine not work well.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 1027, "idx": 125013, "original text": "Quality Expert Urges Firms To Adopt QbD Approach When Developing Cell Therapies.

Painting schools like to teach more about the fun side of moving pictures, like drawing, coloring, and telling stories. They also have classes on old ways of making moving pictures, like drawing by hand and making things move by taking many pictures. On the other side, big schools like to teach more about the hard parts of moving pictures, like 3D shapes, computer pictures, and moving pictures on the computer.\nTo go to a painting school, you usually need to show them your drawings, which show your ability to draw and have fun ideas. Some painting schools may also need you to take a test or talk to them. The way to apply for big schools, on the other side, usually needs taking a hard test and giving them your school reports, letters that say good things about you, and a letter from you.\nAbout the difference between studying moving pictures with a degree from a painting school versus a big school, it really depends on what you want to do and like. If you like the fun side of moving pictures and want to work on things like drawing people, making story pictures, or thinking of art, then a painting school may be better for you. If you like the hard parts of moving pictures and want to work on things like 3D shapes, computer pictures, or computer reality, then a big school may be better for you.\nIn all, studying moving pictures can give you the things you need to do well in this work. Whether you choose to go to a painting school or a big school, make sure to look up the specific program and what it needs to make sure it fits with what you want to do and like.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 744, "idx": 2525, "original text": "hi , i ve been doing some research after reading the advice given by the senior members to bandita and the others on how to start pursuing a career in animation.

I am not fully aware about how to get into art schools ,but i think the basic thing to do to pursue an MS is writing GRE , so does the same thing apply even to art schools that teach animation?? ..

{"text": "Lesson: How to Learn and Understand Stories\n\nIntroduction:\nStories tell us about things that are happening. We can find stories in books, on the internet, and on TV. To learn and understand stories, we need to think about them and the information in them. In this lesson, we will learn how to understand stories by looking at an example.\n\nSection 1: Learning Stories\n\nStep 1: Look at the Title\nThe title is the first thing you see in a story, and it can give you a clue about what the story is about. In the example, the title is \"Jack decides not to talk from his house balcony, plans to show a video in BE city.\" This tells us that Jack wanted to talk from his house balcony but changed his mind and will now show a video in BE city.\n\nStep 2: Look at the First Paragraph\nThe first paragraph is the beginning of the story and should tell us more about the story. In the example, the first paragraph says, \"Jack decided not to talk from his house balcony on a day because he had some special information about his safety. He then decided to show a video in BE city.\" This tells us why Jack changed his mind and also gives us some information about why he did it.\n\nStep 3: Look at the Rest of the Story\nThe rest of the story is where we find out more details about the story. In the example, the story talks about how Jack has been living in a big house for five years and how some people think that his decision could be a big surprise. The story also tells us that Jack said he has something very important to share.\n\nSection 2: Thinking About Stories\n\nStep 1: Find the Main Idea\nThe main idea of the story is that Jack decided not to talk from his house balcony and will instead show a video in BE city.\n\nStep 2: Find the Important Details\nThe important details in the story are the reasons why Jack changed his mind and the information about why he did it.\n\nStep 3: Think About Different Views\nIn the story, there are no clear views or opinions, but some of the things that Jack and other people say could be seen as having an opinion.\n\nSection 3: Real Examples\n\nExample 1: A story about a new rule could have words from people who like or don't like the rule. By thinking about these words, we can understand how people feel about the rule and if it will work.\n\nExample 2: A story about a big storm could have information about the things that the storm broke and how people are helping. By learning the story, we can understand how the storm affected people and how people are helping those who were affected.\n\nWords to Know:\nHeadline: This is the top part of a news story.\n- First paragraph: This is the beginning of the news story that tells us what the story is about.\n- Story body: This is where we learn more about the news story.\n- Main point: This is what the news story is really trying to tell us.\n- Supporting details: These are things that help us understand the main point better.\n- Opinions: These are what people think about the story.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 3228, "idx": 11709, "original text": "Julian Assange canceled a dramatic London balcony address on Tuesday in favor of a video presentation in Berlin after WikiLeaks developed \"specific information\" regarding Assange's safety, the leaked emails clearinghouse tweeted on Monday afternoon.\n\nSome believe the video announcement by the WikiLeaks founder could be an \"October surprise\" geared towards the U.S. presidential election.

Those revelations surfaced in August, just before the party\u2019s convention, proving embarrassing to Clinton\u2019s campaign.

WikiLeaks on Monday tweeted an alleged quote from a 2010 State Department meeting at which then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton asked if Assange could be killed in a drone strike. That same year, former Democrat strategist Bob Beckel said on Fox News Channel that \"a dead man can't leak stuff.\"\n\nAssange also has hinted that deceased DNC staffer Seth Rich may have been a source for WikiLeaks. Rich, 27, was found with multiple gunshot wounds to the back at a Washington, D.C., intersection in July. He died soon thereafter. Authorities believe Rich was the target of a botched robbery, but his death has inspired conspiracy theories.\n\n\n\nWikiLeaks has published more than 10 million leaked emails, including sensitive information about prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, U.S. military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and a cache of diplomatic cables from U.S. embassies around the world.", "hash": "a15d79f849aabd013c803d14aaba8b6b4420a0dbe8a328f3a0d2339d5b24eb69"}
{"text": "Lesson: What \"General Good\" Means in the Big Paper\n\nBegin:\nIn this lesson, we will learn about what \"general good\" means in the Big Paper. We will see how people have thought about this over time and how it changes what we do today.\n\nPart 1: Big Ideas\n\n**Question:** What does \"general good\" mean?\n\n**Answer:** \"General good\" means that everyone in our country is doing well. It is linked to things that help all people, no matter how much money they have.\n\n**Question:** How has what \"general good\" means changed over time?\n\n**Answer:** What \"general good\" means has changed as time has passed. People thought about it differently depending on what was happening in the world. In the old days, \"general good\" meant that everyone in the country was doing well. But later, it came to mean doing things to help people who don't have much.\n\nPart 2: Real World Examples\n\n**Question:** Can you think of something that helps the \"general good\"?\n\n**Answer:** One thing that helps the \"general good\" is called Social Security. It helps old people and people who can't work. It makes sure they have things they need like food and a place to live.\n\n**Question:** How does what \"general good\" means change what we do today?\n\n**Answer:** What \"general good\" means can change what we do today. For example, when President O wanted to change healthcare, some people said it wasn't for the \"general good.\" But others said helping everyone get healthcare was for the \"general good.\"\n\nPart 3: Talking About It\n\n**Question:** Should we do things that help the \"general good\"? Why or why not?\n\n**Answer:** There's no one answer to this. It depends on what people think is important and what they think the government should do. Some say that the leaders should make rules that help everyone to make things fair. Others think that the leaders' main job is to keep everyone's rights and freedoms safe, and that rules that help everyone can sometimes get in the way of these rights.\n\nIn the end:\nKnowing what \"helping everyone\" means in the US rule book is important for talking about rules.

But, some kids find it hard to count, and it can be tough to see how they're doing. That's where a Counting Book helps.\n\n**Part 1: What is a Counting Book?**\n\nA Counting Book is a thing that helps teachers see how their students are doing in counting. It has first tests, last tests, lists for special tests, quick cards for one-on-one tests, and finish tickets.\n\n**Part 2: Why use a Counting Book?**\n\nUsing a Counting Book helps a lot. First, it lets teachers see where kids are having trouble, so they can give extra help. Next, it lets teachers see how a student is doing over time, so they can change how they teach if needed. Lastly, it gives a way to see how much a student is growing and getting better, which is important for knowing how good the teaching is.\n\n**Part 3: How to use a Counting Book**\n\nTo use a Counting Book, do these steps:\n\n1. Start by giving a first test at the start of the school year or half-year. This will help you see what your students already know and where they need extra help.\n\n2. As you teach each counting part, give chances for students to show they understand through special tests. These can include practice problems, short tests, or big tests.\n\n3. Use quick cards for one-on-one tests to give quick help to students who are having trouble. This will help them fix any wrong ideas or mistakes before they get stuck.\n\n4. At the end of each lesson or part, give a finish ticket for students to do. This will help you see how well they understand what you taught.\n\n5. Last, give a last test at the end of the school year or half-year to see how much a student has grown and gotten better. Compare the results with the first test to see how much students have learned.\n\n**Part 4: End**\n\nTo end, a Counting Book is a very important thing for any counting teacher. It lets you see and check student progress, see areas of trouble, and change your teaching ways if needed. By doing the steps above, you can use a Counting Book to make your students' understanding of counting better and make sure they are getting better at their goals.\n\n**Words to Know:**\n- First test: A test given before teaching to see what is already known\n- Last test: A test given after teaching to see how much a student has grown and gotten better\n- Special tests: Tests that are made for each student's needs\n- Quick cards: Cards used to give quick help to students who are having trouble\n- Finish tickets: Short tests given at the end of each lesson or part to see understanding\n- Before learning check: A check we do before we learn something new to see what we already know\n- After learning check: A check we do after we learn something to see how much we have grown and improved\n- Special checks: Checks that are made just right for each student's needs\n- Help cards: Cards used to give help right away to students who need it\n- Goodbye quizzes: Small quizzes given at the end of each day or topic to see how well we understand", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 546, "idx": 458896, "original text": "Math Instant Assessments For Data Tracking Book.

Epidemiological data have suggested that coffee consumption is inversely related to CRC risk, which may be attributed to chlorogenic acid (CGA), an ester of caffeic acid (CA) and quinic acid. This study was conducted to determine whether chronic dietary CGA supplementation would attenuate tumorigenesis and oxidative stress in a mouse model of azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colon cancer. Mice (4-wk old; n = 15/group) were fed CGA (0%, 0.01%, or 0.1%) for 20 wk and received 6 weekly intraperitoneal AOM injections (10 mg/kg). CGA and CA dose-dependently accumulated in the small intestinal mucosa.

Hepatic GSH/GSSG and Cys/CySS ratios were unaffected by AOM, but CGA at 0.1% increased these ratios by decreasing GSSG and CySS. CGA did not affect the ratios of small intestinal GSH/GSSG or Cys/CySS, which were decreased in response to AOM treatment.

{"text": "Lesson: Introduction to Taking Care of Old People\n\n## Section 1: Understanding Taking Care of Old People\nTaking care of old people is an agreement between a helper and a person that gives financial protection when someone we love is not with us anymore. It gives money to special people when the person is not with us anymore. Taking care of old people can be a very important part of an old person's plan, giving peace and safety for their family or people they love.\nWhy do old people need special care?\nOld people might need special care to give money help to their families or friends after they are gone. This can help pay for goodbye party costs, money they owe, or give money help if they can't work. Plus, special care can be used as a plan to make sure everyone gets the same amount of things when they are gone.\n## Part 2: Kinds of Special Care for Old People\nThere are two main kinds of special care: time-limited and forever.\n### Question: What is time-limited special care?\nAnswer: Time-limited special care gives help for a certain time (usually between 10 and 30 years). If the person who has it goes away during the time, the care-giver will give the goodbye money to the friends. Time-limited special care is usually less money than forever special care but gives help for a limited time.\n### Question: What is forever special care?\nAnswer: Forever special care gives help for the person's whole life, as long as they pay. It gives a goodbye benefit with a saving part that can add cash over time. Forever special care is usually more money than time-limited special care but gives help all life long and a possible saving part.\n## Part 3: Things to Think About When Getting Special Care for Old People\nWhen getting special care for old people, several things should be thought about, including:\n### Question: How much help do I need?\nAnswer: The amount of help needed depends on the person's money situation and goals. A common idea is to calculate 10 times the yearly money needed to replace lost money or provide money safety.\n### Question: How much will it cost?\nAnswer: The cost of special care changes depending on several things, including age, health, and the type of care. Usually, old people can expect to pay more for special care than young people because of more health risks and less life time.\n### Question: What is the care-giver's reputation?\nAnswer: It's very important to look up the care-giver's reputation before buying a care plan. Look for care-givers with strong money ratings and good customer reviews.\n## Part 4: Ending\nIn the end, special care for old people can give money safety and quiet mind for their families or friends. By understanding the different kinds of special care, thinking about things such as how much help and cost, and looking up care-givers, old people can make smart choices about their special care needs.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 787, "idx": 611068, "original text": "Guide to the Best Senior Life Insurance for Seniors.

{"text": "Lesson: Bike Riding Tips\nIntroduction:\nIn bike riding, going at a good speed is about how you manage your energy during a race to do your best. In a race, you must ride at a good speed to finish as quickly as you can. But, when the wind changes, like strong wind in your face or wind at your back, it can be hard to keep a good speed. This lesson will teach you about different ways to keep a good speed that can help you do better in bike races with pretend strong wind in your face and wind at your back.\nMain Idea:\nThe main idea of this lesson is that ways to keep a good speed are very important for doing your best in bike races when the wind changes. By knowing and using different ways to keep a good speed, bike riders can do better in their race.\nPart 1: Understanding Ways to Keep a Good Speed\nTopic 1: What are ways to keep a good speed?\nWays to keep a good speed are things that bike riders do to manage their energy during a race to do their best. These ways involve adjusting how hard you are trying based on the race, like changes in the road or wind.\nTopic 2: Why are ways to keep a good speed important in bike races?\nIn bike races, riders must keep a good speed to finish as quickly as they can. But, when the wind changes, like strong wind in your face or wind at your back, it can be hard to keep a good speed. Ways to keep a good speed help bike riders manage their energy to do their best in these conditions.\nTopic 3: Types of ways to keep a good speed\nThere are several types of ways to keep a good speed that bike riders can use in races with pretend strong wind in your face and wind at your back. These include:\n- Same: Riding with the same energy throughout the entire race.\n- Changing: Adjusting your energy based on the changing wind. For example, riding with more energy during the strong wind in your face and less energy during the wind at your back.\n- Strong start: Starting the race with more energy to use the wind at your back and then slowly reducing the effort as the strong wind in your face increases.\nPart 2: Using Ways to Keep a Good Speed\nTopic 1: How to use a same way to keep a good speed\nTo use a same way to keep a good speed, you should:\n- Warm up properly before the race to make sure that you are ready for the effort.\n- Use a tool to watch your effort throughout the race.\n- Stay focused on your effort and try not to get too excited or too careful.\n- Watch your heart beat or how hard you feel you are trying to make sure that you are riding with the right energy.\nTopic 2: How to use a changing way to keep a good speed\nTo use a changing way to keep a good speed, you should:\n- Use a tool to watch your effort throughout the race.\n- Adjust your energy based on the changing wind. For example, riding with more energy during the strong wind in your face and less energy during the wind at your back.\nThink about this:\nWhen you ride your bike and the wind is blowing against you, you have to pedal harder. But when the wind is blowing from behind you, you can pedal less hard.\nAlways check how tired you are to make sure you are riding your bike at the right speed.\nNow, let's think about a boy named Jack. Jack is riding his bike in a race. First, he has to ride against the wind. Then, he gets to ride with the wind behind him. Jack decides to pedal harder when the wind is against him. And he pedals less hard when the wind is behind him. By doing this, Jack can finish the race as fast as he can.\nIn the end, knowing how to ride your bike when the wind is against you or behind you is very important. It helps you finish the race faster. Always remember to check how tired you are and change how hard you pedal if you need to. Don't get too excited or too lazy. With practice, you will get better at riding your bike in a race.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 3166, "idx": 157422, "original text": "Pacing strategies during a cycling time trial with simulated headwinds and tailwinds.\nThe aims of this study were to examine the effects of one self-selected and two enforced pacing strategies (constant and variable power output) on cycling performance during a time trial in which variable wind conditions were simulated. Seven male cyclists rode their own bicycles on a Computrainer cycle ergometer, which was programmed to simulate a 16.1 km time trial on a flat course with a 8.05 km h(-1) headwind in the first half of the race and a 8.05 km h(-1) tailwind in the second half of the race. Subjects rode an initial time trial (ITT) at a self-selected pace to the best of their ability. The mean power output from this trial was then used to calculate the pacing strategies in the subsequent two trials: Constant (C)--riders rode the whole time trial at this mean power output; and Variable (V)--riders rode the first headwind section at a power output 5% higher than the mean and then reduced the power output in the last 8.05 km so that the mean power output was the same as in the initial time trial and in trial C. Power output, heart rate and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were recorded every 1.61 km. Finish times, 8.05 km split times and blood lactate levels, pre- and post-exercise (to calculate delta lactate), were also recorded in each trial. In the ITT, riders chose a mean +/- SD power output of 267 +/- 56 W in the first 1.61 km which was 14% higher than the overall race mean +/- SD of 235 +/- 41 W. Power outputs then dropped to below the race mean after the first few kilometres. Mean +/- SD finish times in the C and V time trials were 1661 +/- 130 and 1659 +/- 135 s, respectively. These were significantly faster than the 1671 +/- 131 s recorded in the initial time trial (p = 0.009), even though overall mean power outputs were similar (234 - 235 W) between all trials (p = 0.26). Overall mean RPE and delta lactate were lowest in trial V (p < 0.05). Perceived exertion showed a pacing strategy by race split interaction (p < 0.0001), but it was not increased significantly during the first 8.05 km of the V condition when power outputs were 5% higher than in condition C. Heart rate showed no main effect of pacing strategy (p = 0.80) and the interaction between strategy and race split did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.07). These results suggest that in a 16.1 km time trial with equal 8.05 km headwind and tailwind sections, riders habitually set off too fast in the first few kilometres and will benefit (10 s improvement) from a constant pacing strategy and, to a slightly greater degree (12 s improvement), from a variable (5% +/- mean) pacing strategy in line with the variations in wind direction during the race. Riders should choose a constant power when external conditions are constant, but when there are hilly or variable wind sections in the race, a variable power strategy should be planned. This strategy would be best monitored with 'power-measuring devices' rather than heart rate or subjective feelings as the sensitivity of these variables to small but meaningful changes in power during a race is low.", "hash": "a3fdd04e3bd1ab2f92e10d21b32f85e4d9e25921d92d0932e95854bcae3cfef9"}

We will look at what was the same and what was different about these two times.\n\nIn both of these times, people had strong feelings about who should be their leader. In the late 20th century, the country was dealing with a big war, people wanting equal rights, and a big problem involving the leader. In the early 21st century, the country was dealing with a big sickness, people wanting equal rights, and a big problem involving the leader.\n\nBut there were also some big differences between these two times. In the late 20th century, there were not a lot of computers and internet. But in the early 21st century, people used the internet a lot to talk about who should be the leader. Also, in the early 21st century, a lot of people voted by mail because of the big sickness.\n\nAnother big difference was what people cared about. In the late 20th century, people cared a lot about a big war. But in the early 21st century, people cared about many different things like equal rights and taking care of the earth.\n\nChapter 3: End Thoughts\n\nIn the end, there are some things that are the same between the two times we talked about, but there are also many things that are different.

Live long enough, and you come to realize the truth in that simple but power-packed piece of wisdom.\n\nAs we face the presidential election next year, consider the following political landscape:a Republican president reviled by the left and the media; the corresponding growth of a radical, collectivist resistance; and a Democratic Party blinded by hate, overcome by nonsensical policy prescriptions driven purely by emotion, and consequently prepared to nominate a far-left candidate for president. And somehow believing such a candidate could take down a despicable president elected by a previously silent majority.\n\nRichard Nixon\n\nWe\u2019re talking 2020, right? Actually, it was 1972.\n\nRichard Nixon had won a narrow victory in the presidential election four years earlier in 1968, when the nation was riven by the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy, race riots across the land, and growing protests over the Vietnam War. Revolution was in the air. Nixon appealed to voters who were turning against the war but rejecting the growing violence and anti-Americanism in the anti-war and hippie movements, which shook the country to its core and threatened the status quo.\n\nOnce Nixon captured the White House, the resistance turned up the heat. And in 1972, a senator from the far-left fringe of the Democratic Party, George McGovern, wrested the presidential nomination from establishment figures Ed Muskie and Hubert Humphrey and, believe it or not, segregationist George Wallace (in those days, the Democratic Party was more, shall we say, eclectic). Wallace was the victim of an assassination attempt while campaigning, rendering him a paraplegic (though incredibly he won primaries in Maryland and Michigan the following day), and the establishment candidates split the vote, allowing McGovern to seize the nomination and face Nixon in the general election.\n\nBoth Nixon and Trump were positioned by the left as radical conservatives, when in fact both supported multiple positions in accord with left-of-center thinking. In addition to his groundbreaking policy of detente with the Soviet Communists and historic reestablishment of relations with China, Nixon ended the military draft, established the Environmental Protection Agency, signed Title IX restrictions outlawing gender bias, and implemented wage and price controls. But none of that mattered, because the left believed Nixon to be evil.\n\nTrump has decried the Iraq War and followed a non-interventionist foreign policy, which historically the left has favored. He has opened negotiations with the North Korean Communist regime, initiated trade deals that protect American unions, and supported criminal justice reform, campaign finance reform, infrastructure buildout, and protection of entitlement programs such as Social Security. But like Nixon, those positions are of little consequence to leftists repulsed by the 45th president.", "hash": "bd069e1483201b4acc02669e5fed5e420c093bd0f495cd3cfc64f3c59be4a1b4"}

{"text": "**Lesson: How to Understand Picture-Maps**\n\n**Beginning**\n\nPicture-maps are pictures of the Earth's surface or a part of it. They are used to show where different things are, like paths, rivers, towns, and countries. Understanding picture-maps is a useful skill that helps us find our way, plan trips, and learn about our world. In this lesson, we will learn how to understand different kinds of picture-maps and use them well.\n\n**Part 1: Kinds of Picture-Maps**\n\nThere are many kinds of picture-maps, each with its own use and features. These include:\n\n1. Country picture-maps: These picture-maps show the boundaries of countries, states, and cities. They often have flags or pictures to represent different countries.\n\n2. Nature picture-maps: These picture-maps show the Earth's surface, such as mountains, rivers, and forests.\n\n3. Hill picture-maps: These picture-maps show heights and shapes of the Earth's surface, good for walking and playing outside.\n\n4. Path picture-maps: These picture-maps show big roads, small streets, and other ways for walking or driving.\n\n5. Fun picture-maps: These picture-maps show fun places to visit, landmarks, and other interesting things.\n\n6. Theme picture-maps: These picture-maps focus on one thing, like how many people live somewhere, what the weather is like, or what plants grow there.\n\n**Part 2: Understanding Picture-Maps**\n\nTo understand a picture-map well, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the key: A guide or key is usually in the top right corner of the picture-map. It explains the symbols and colors used to show different things.\n\n2. Find yourself: Find where you are now on the picture-map. This can be done by looking at a compass picture or a picture-map grid.\n\n3. Identify landmarks: Look for things you know, like rivers, mountains, or cities, to understand where you are.\n\n4. Follow the scale: The scale of the picture-map shows how much of the Earth's surface is shown. For example, a picture-map with a scale of 1:100,000 means that one mark on the picture-map represents 100,000 marks in real life.\n\n5. Use direction arrows: Direction arrows help you put the picture-map the right way up and understand where different things are.\n\n6. Read the picture-map's title and caption: These give you more information about the picture-map's use and what it shows.\n\n**Part 3: Real Examples**\n\nLet's say you want to plan a trip from NE city to SF city. You can use a path picture-map to find the best way and guess how long it will take. You can also use a fun picture-map to find interesting places to visit on the way.\n\n**Word List**\n\n- Picture-map: A picture of the Earth's surface or a part of it.\n- Guide: A key that explains the symbols and colors used to show different things on a picture-map.\n- Size: The size on a map compared to the real size of the Earth.\n- Map flower: A picture used to show north, south, east, and west on a map.\n- Net: Lines on a map used to measure how far places are.\n- Special thing: A thing you can easily see, like a big hill or city.\n\n**End**\n\nLearning maps is a good skill that helps us find our way and learn about the world. By learning how to read different maps and doing the steps in this lesson, you can become good at reading maps and make smart choices when going on trips or finding new places.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 423, "idx": 354064, "original text": "Vidiani.com - -.
