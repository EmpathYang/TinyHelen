I'm going to win that.\" \"Yes!\" \"It's perfect!\" \"I love this car!\" \"Now, Emma, there's some things on this car that are different from the other one.

No one wins all the time, sweetie. Come on, go to bed. Vroom! Vroom! Vroom! Vrooooooooom! So, did you win? Don't do that. Boy, I can't wait until I get to drive one of these. You have a few more years to wait. When I get mine, we can race. Uh, no way. I'll still be older than you, so forget it. But we'll have the same kind of car. Forget it. Why? Because if I win, I just beat a little kid, and if, and I mean if, you somehow win, then I lose to a little kid. It's a lose-lose for me. You're really funny, you know that? You take it so seriously. How am I supposed to take it? It's just a race. When you lose a race, which is rare. Okay. But even when you win, like, if you don't do well in the trials, you sulk, slam doors, and stuff. I do not. Do too. Charlotte, do me a favor. What? Get out of my car. Repetitive. Repetitive. Repetitive. Tired. Tired. Tired. Happy. Happy. Happy. Sad. Sad. Sad. Excited. Excited. Excited. Calm. Calm. Calm. Angry. Angry. Angry. Thoughtful. Thoughtful. Thoughtful. Happy. Welcome back, race fans, to the big race in TE city. Let's go! Lane one, Charlotte. Yes! And Charlotte wins with a time of not very long at all! And that beats the previous record that was held by, that's right, her big sister, Emma. How about that? That's what we call keeping it in the family. Wow! Did you see that? Did you see that, huh? Huh? Congratulations. Now we're both in the record books. Yeah. Well... Isn't that great? What's the matter? You had a good time, that's all. That's all?\" \"That's it.\" \"I don't care.\" \"Why do you spend time making your face pretty,\" \"when you will wear a hat and no one will see?\" \"So what?\" \"Hi, Emma.\" \"Jack Thomas.\" \"I talked to you for a big magazine.\" \"Hello, Mr. Thomas.\" \"I will be ready soon.\" \"Actually, I am here to talk to your sister.\" \"Oh.\" \"Ok.\" \"For you.\" \"Try not to mess up your hair.\" \"Charlotte, hi.\" \"Hi.\" \"I have some questions for you.\" \"Of course, I'm happy for her.\" \"I mean, she's my sister,\" \"and I love her, but sometimes...\" \"Ohh!\" \"She just makes me crazy sometimes.\" \"Don't let her.\" \"I can't help it.\" \"And it's not like she does it to make me mad.\" \"Not always.\" \"Like today.\" \"When I talk to people, I get all nervous,\" \"and I usually can't speak well,\" \"and my mouth gets dry, like I don't know what.\" \"I've seen it, remember?\" \"Right.\" \"But Charlotte, you know,\" \"it's easy for her.\" \"Even racing.\" \"I mean, she tries less hard than I ever did,\" \"and she's just as good as I was when I was her age.\" \"I mean, everything is easier for her.\" \"Well, she had a big help.\" \"What?\" \"She had you to teach her a lot.\" \"I mean, she's good,\" \"but she's a lot better because of you.\" \"You know, for a boy,\" \"you say some smart things sometimes.\" \"I'll take that as a compliment.\" \"Should I go?\" \"I don't want to ruin your love life.\" \"I have to have a love life before you can ruin it.\" \"I'm gonna find you a girlfriend.\" \"Me?\" \"What about you?\" \"Where's your boyfriend?\" \"I'm away racing every weekend.\" \"Not every weekend.\" \"I don't know what it is.\" \"I mean, maybe they're scared or something.\" \"Because they're just learning to drive,\" \"and you've been racing since you were 8.\" \"I can't even get them to talk to me,\" \"and she's got them all around her.\" \"I don't get it.\" \"Well, it's simple.\" \"She loses.\" \"Sit, Girl, Sit.\" \"Just Looking.\" \"Well, Put Your Eyes Back In.\" \"It's Time To Play.\" \"Look at This.\" \"It's Our Racing Girl.\" \"She Thinks She's So Cool.\" \"Yeah, Big Deal.\" \"She Drives A Car.\" \"Think She Eats Candy, Too?\" \"The Second One Of Them Breaks A Nail,\" \"They'll Call For Help.\" \"Also, They're Just Jealous.\" \"Why?\" \"They're The Liked Ones.\" \"Just 'Cause They're Liked\" \"Doesn't Mean Everybody Likes Them.\" \"Let's Go, Girls!\" \"2 Lines.\" \"Outside Playing.\" \"Let's Go!\"\"Let's Go!\" \"Let's Go!\" \"Choose To Join Us For A Real Game, Emma?\" \"If You Get Tired Or Anything, Take A Break.\" \"Are You Saying What I Do Is Not A Game?\" \"Well, It Doesn't Take A Lot Of Exercise\" \"To Sit On Your Seat.\" \"Don't Forget, She Has To Push The Pedal, Too.\" \"Ever Drive A Fast Car?\" \"The Feeling Is So Strong, It Pushes You Into The Seat.\" \"You Can't Breathe, Really 'Cause Of The Pressure On Your Body.\" \"Makes It Kind Of Hard To Move Your Head And Arms,\" \"And, Trust Me, You Need To Do Both.\" \"So You Really Have To Make Your Arm And Shoulder Strong,\" \"And As For Hand And Eye Playing,\" \"You Make A Mistake, You Lose A Point.\" \"I Make A Mistake, Someone Can Get Hurt.\" \"So, Sorry.\" \"I Have To Disagree With You.\" \"It Does Take A Little Exercise To Do What I Do.\" \"Very Good, Emma!\" \"Oh, Man.\" \"Can You Tell Me What's Wrong With This Picture?\" \"I Give Up.\" \"What's Wrong?\" \"We've Got Almost The Same Times,\" \"Same Records, And Look.\" \"Jack Got, Like, A Lot of Friends,\" \"And I Can't Even Get One.\" \"Is That What's Making You Sad?\" \"Yes.\" \"I See It All The Time.\" \"There's Kids Here, Kids I've Won Over,\" \"And They've All Got Friends.\" \"Because They're Boys.\" \"That's The Only Reason.\" \"It's Not Fair.\" \"I'm Sorry, Dad.\" \"I Mean, I Know It's A Lot Of Coins\" \"You Let Me Worry About That.\" \"But You Wouldn't Have To If I Could Get A Friend.\" \"I'm As Good As, Or Better Than, Those Kids,\" \"And They've All Got Friends.\" \"It's because I'm a girl. It's not fair. I'll talk to Mr. William tomorrow about help for your race. Keep racing, okay?\" \"Okay.\" \"Hello.\" \"Hello.\" \"Hello.\" \"How did it go?\" \"What did they say?\" \"Did you get it?\" \"I'm sorry, darling. I talked to Mr. William and he said his company couldn't help you because, well, he was truthful, he said there are a lot of people who are upset because you keep beating the boys. Just wait, darling. When you get closer to the big race, they won't be able to ignore you. Why are people like this? People are slow to change. Anything new or different scares them. And you are different, darling. Now, I know you're not the most patient person. Neither am I. So you get it from me. But you're just going to have to wait. They'll come around. Thanks for trying, Daddy. Ouch! Are you hurt? No. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. Are you sure? I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. Are you sure? Yes. Yeah. All right. Let's go back to practice. Yeah. Okay. Here. You should see a doctor. I'm okay. You can't even lift your arm. If I tell my parents, they won't let me race this weekend. So, take a weekend off. Okay. Okay. Silly thought. Hello, honey. Hello. Emma hurt herself at ball game today. She's got a big bruise on her shoulder. Why didn't she say something? Why do you think? It's too much for her, Gabriel. She's got to cut back on the racing. She'll never make the big race if she does that. I don't care about the big race, Gabriel. I'm worried about her. You're pushing her too much. Darling, the only one pushing Emma is Emma. Oh, you help, Gabriel. You do. I just want her to be good. For who? You or her? You know, when she first started, I admit, I was a little jealous.\" \"Once, I thought,\" \"Well, she's better at driving than I ever was.\" \"But it wasn't that, dear.\" \"It was her love for it.\" \"That child truly loves this,\" \"And she's known it since she was 8 years old.\" \"She's still a child.\" \"I know.\" \"But, dear,\" \"The first time she was in a car,\" \"I could see that she knew how to do things that can't be taught.\" \"Only the best drivers have that...\" \"That...\" \"That feeling.\" \"You're born with it,\" \"And to me, if you're born with a talent like that,\" \"It should be encouraged.\" \"But she's at such a tough age for a girl.\" \"And then she has to deal with things that most kids don't.\" \"I don't like to think she's missing out on being a child.\" \"Hey,\" \"If Alice or Charlotte ever want to stop racing,\" \"I won't stop them.\" \"Welcome to today's race, everyone.\" \"These young drivers will be racing against time\" \"And trying not to be out.\" \"Those with the best times continue to the next race,\" \"So every moment counts.\" \"Jack, you've been doing really well in the NE city,\" \"What brings you to HO city?\" \"Well, my helper sent me here for the Spring races.\" \"That was great.\" \"So good today.\" \"I know.\" \"Going to take it easy today?\" \"Never.\" \"What is he doing here?\" \"You just made the front of Junior Racer\" \"For the third month in a row.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Who else?\" \"Want to bet I beat him\" \"In the race tomorrow?\" \"And this time,\" \"He won't know what happened.\" \"It's not good to take this too seriously.\" \"I can't help it.\" \"I still have bad dreams\" \"About the time he beat me.\" \"What do you think of the other racers so far?\" \"Not much.\" \"But, uh,\" \"I think I might meet one of them here\" \"For the big race, so I had to see for myself.\" \"Boys?\" \"Did you hear that?\" \"Boys?\" \"In Lane 2, Jack.\" \"Alice, let's go.\" \"Monkey, relax.\" \"It's just a race.\" \"And that's Jack with a time of early in the morning.\" \"Early in the morning.\" \"I Can Do Better.\" \"In line one, Emma.\" \"An 8.89 for Emma.\" \"So, what was my time?\" \"That was 8.89, dear.\" \"Yes.\" \"You did better than him.\" \"We're coming to get you.\" \"Dad, stop.\" \"Hey, Jack.\" \"Mr. Kevin.\" \"Those are for your son,\" \"In case he starts crying when I beat him in the final.\" \"It was just a joke.\" \"No, it wasn't, Emma.\" \"For the first time in your life, you embarrassed me.\" \"Oh, but it's ok when he does it?\" \"You're not him!\" \"You've been taught better.\" \"You want to act badly?\" \"Go ahead, be like the Kevins.\" \"A while ago, I had to teach you how to act when you lose,\" \"But I never...\" \"Never thought I'd have to teach you how to win.\" \"Dear,\" \"I know it would feel good for a few minutes\" \"to throw it back at him, and to be honest,\" \"I've wanted to do it myself a few times,\" \"But, in the end, all you do is make yourself look bad.\" \"You're better than that.\" \"You haven't been scolded by me in a long time.\" \"Yeah, well, don't make me do it again.\" \"I don't like it.\" \"Me, neither.\" \"Well, this is the one we've been waiting for, friends.\" \"NE state champion Jack taking on\" \"the SW champion Emma.\" \"This is not the first meeting between these two.\" \"Something tells me it won't be the last.\" \"This is the one we've all been waiting for.\" \"Both cars are ready.\" \"This is going to be exciting.\" \"Ladies and gentlemen, Emma left\" \"before the light turned green, which will disqualify her.\" \"And which makes today's winner Jack.\" \"Yes!\" \"All right!\" \"I messed up!\" \"You'll beat him next time.\" \"You drive.\"\"You drive.\" \"You drive.\" \"You all drive.\"\"You all drive.\" \"You all drive.\" \"I drive.\"\"I drive.\" \"I drive.\" \"We drive.\"\"We drive.\" \"We drive.\" \"You drive.\"\"You drive.\" \"You drive.\" \"May I?\" \"Sorry.\" \"Thank you.\"\"Thank you.\" \"Thank you.\"
