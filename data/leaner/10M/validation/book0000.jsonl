{"text": "This is a book by David. It is a book about a big company and it is printed in CA country. The company is in many places, like BL place, NS place, and WI place. The government of CA country, the MB department, and NS province helped the company. The company is also helped by the arts council of CA country. \n\nDavid is the writer of the book. The book is about the big company and its work in different places. It also talks about how the company works with the government. \n\nThe book has different parts. The first part is about the company and the CA country. The second part is about a project in CH country and TI place. The book also talks about problems with the project and what people in CA country think about it.

This book would not be possible without things we learned from groups like Stop the Wall, Women for Peace, Big Group of Workers, Free Tibet, and many others.\n\nSecond, I want to thank my friend and helper, Hayden. Three years ago in my home, I told him my first ideas about a book on the Big Company and my three main stories. He said that using ideas from studying how people take over other people's land would be helpful in understanding what's happening in the three stories. This idea really changed how I thought about the book and how I teach and do research.\n\nI also want to say thank you to the great help I got from students at a big school over the past several years. The following students did work that helped with this project: Chris, Tyler, Tessa, and Jill.\n\nFernwood Publishing has been a great company to work with, and I am thankful for their help with this project. In particular, I thank editor Candida for her work with the words in the book. Her understanding, feedback, and helpful criticism were very important in finishing this project.\n\nFinally, I thank my family, friends, and helpers for their support during the writing of this book.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nBIG COMPANY, THE STATE, AND A PROBLEM\n\nJoseph-Armand was only 15 years old when he began making his own snow vehicles. In 1937, when he was 30, Joseph-Armand started selling his invention and made a big snow car that could hold seven people. But it wasn't until 1969 that the Big Company, then with Joseph-Armand's son-in-law, Laurent, in charge, became a public company and started doing other things through buying other companies in the train sector. The Big Company would become \"the North AM country leader in trains\" by 1982, while also starting to work with planes during the 1980s. More growth and buying other companies in the 1990s made the company a big player in both planes and trains by the early 2000s. From simple beginnings, BO company grew into a big company in CA country and then all over the world. BO company has won many awards over the years. In 2014, \"BO was listed as one of the top 100 companies in the world for being good to the environment by a company in TO city.\" And in 2015, BO was chosen for the ninth year in a row to be part of an important list for companies that are good to the environment.\n\nBO company is based in MO city, QU province, and is now one of the biggest transportation companies in the world. It made a lot of money in the year ending on the last day of 2016. The company has about 65,500 workers in more than twenty-eight countries. BO company is really big in its two main areas \u2014 flying and train transportation \u2014 and you can buy shares in the company on the TO Stock Exchange. According to the company's website, BO Aerospace has \"the most kinds of planes and we are the biggest in business and regional aircraft,\" and BO Transportation \"is a global leader in the train industry\". Indeed, BO is considered one of the most successful CA companies in the modern era, and what it does affects many parts of the world. This is why we want to look at BO's projects in other countries and how the company is part of CA's investment in other countries.\n\nBO has often been in the news in CA over the past several years. The news has talked about problems like a trade fight with another company, BC, which said that BO was selling planes for less money in the US, big pay increases for the top people in the company while the company is having money problems, free loans given to the company by the CA and QU governments, and people saying that BO officials did bad things to get contracts in AZ country and SA country. While these stories are important and we need to pay attention to them, we don't often hear about what BO does in other countries. As BO is a big CA company with dealings in lots of foreign countries and has been a big part of the CA business world for decades, it is surprising that very little is known in CA about its relationships and projects in other countries. This book is to talk in detail about three important projects that BO is part of in other countries \u2014 in CH country/TI place, SA country, and IS country/PA place \u2014 and to look at the problems that exist for companies like BO that choose to be part of projects that people disagree about a lot.\n\nThis look at BO is part of a growing number of books that look at the impact of CA companies in other countries, especially in mining. Scholars and activists have carefully shown the problems with the environment and people that often come with CA mining activities at home and abroad, and the fights by communities to stop mining projects. Gabriel and William (2016) talk about digging in a place called LA country, with a focus on understanding the bigger picture of how the world works. Other writers also talk about how our companies work in different places, which is an important part of this book. This book adds to the conversation by also talking about the transportation business, especially the BO company.\n\nThis book also adds to more writing that talks about how we act in different places. A lot of writers today question and break down the idea that we are always nice, kind, peaceful, and helpful when we interact with other countries. A recent book on HO country talks about how we reacted to a big change in 2009 in ways that didn't help the people there but helped our businesses (Shipley 2017). Another book (Thompson 2017) talks about how we haven't always respected human rights. This book, while talking about one company, also talks about our role in the world.\n\nTalking about BO is important for a few reasons: Even though BO is a famous company, not a lot of people have studied it; talking about more than just digging businesses lets us understand our businesses in other countries better; and the cases in this book show us important questions about being fair, being in charge, and deciding for ourselves, and also highlight parts of taking away that go with the existing writing on digging industries. Plus, this work shows how our businesses in other places are an important part of how we interact with the world, and asks people, thinkers, decision-makers, and normal citizens to think more closely about these relationships when talking about important decisions.\n\nEach of the three cases picked for this analysis of BO's businesses in other places is different; however, they also have things in common. All three cases look at fast train projects, and all show the issue of taking away. Using the idea of taking away, I question BO's involvement in projects that have serious political, economic, environment, and social effects for people in the affected areas. While it might seem that BO is just doing business with recognized and legitimate countries, a closer look at each place raises many difficult questions about the benefits and costs of the train infrastructure for local people. The main point is that BO is doing business in very sensitive and politically sensitive areas of the world and that the projects suggest a degree of involvement in processes of taking away.\n\nThe first story is about a fast train project finished in 2006 in CH country. The fast train connects different parts of CH country to a place called TI place, and a company provided the train cars. Some people believe that TI place should be its own place, or at least have more control within CH country, and they want to decide this for themselves. Some people say that the new train makes CH country have more control over TI place and that the good things from the train are mostly for CH country and the people from CH country living in TI place. This story is important because the fast train gave the company a good start in the CH country train market, was the first project from the company to have a lot of pushback from people in CA country and other places, and is about a fight over land that has TI people wanting to decide for themselves against CH country saying TI place is a part of CH country. I picked this story because of its importance to the company, the pushback it has gotten, and the big questions about who gets to decide about the CH-TI fight. The company finds itself working with the CH country in what many see as taking over TI place. It's hard to get good information from TI place, but my story is based on good books in this field, detailed reports from groups working in TI place and outside, public talks by the CH country, and works by writers who have traveled and lived a lot in TI place.\n\nThe second story is about a fast train line finished in 2010 \u2014 the GA train \u2014 in the GA place of SA country. The GA train connects the big city places of JO city and PR city, while also connecting to the big airport in JO city. This new train was said to make jobs and help the economy and reduce traffic between the two big cities. However, some people say that there was not enough planning and talking, other choices were not really considered, there is no help to the environment from the new train, and, most importantly, the train makes it harder for some people to move around in the region. The city places of the old bad times are arguably not changed by the new train, but rather made stronger, as the train mostly helps rich SA people and leaves out the poor majority. While this story does not have the big politics of the other two stories in the book, it shows important ways that taking away can happen under normal-looking situations. I chose this story because it is the first fast train line on the AF continent, and it exists in a time after the bad times that is still deeply divided along lines of color and class. My story is based on work done in 2011 and a detailed look at both first and second sources.\n\nThe third story is about a fast train line in the unsettled and historically fought over space of IS/PA place. Connecting the cities of TA city and JE city, this railway is planned to be finished in 2018. The big worry in this project is that the chosen path of the train goes into the WB place two times. This brings up big questions about laws, especially the jobs of a leader towards the people they lead. A company from GR country even left the project, saying they were worried about laws and how to act right. People in the affected parts of the WB place have asked the world to make IS country change the path of the train \u2014 but it didn't work. Also, this train is part of a bigger problem of people losing their homes in the area and also a global movement against IS country. I picked this case because it is in one of the most argued about places in the world, and it gives a chance to look at claims of companies doing very bad things against laws. The research for this case includes reports from IS and PA groups, school papers, government papers, news, and a careful reading of the right laws.\n\nCA company, the CA country, AND CA IDENTITY\n\nThe CA country often tries to make more and better chances for CA companies, and so, the government has helped the CA company do well over the years. As the case of IS/PA shows, CA sometimes helps directly to open up new markets for the company. This usually includes trade trips led by the CA government into countries of interest, with bosses from CA companies like CA company. These trips can maybe even result in trade deals, as was the case in the late 20th century with the signing of the CA\u2013IS Trade Deal.\n\nOn top of this help, several government funds and groups directly help CA company and other CA companies. Export Development CA (EDC), Technology Partnerships CA (TPC), and CA Account have all helped CA company to do its making, selling, and research activities abroad. A 2009 CA company advertising paper says: \"Since the late 20th century, it [Government of CA] has put a total of $142 million in research and new plane designs under the Technology Partnerships CA (TPC) Program.\" Export Development CA (EDC) \u2014 CA's export credit agency \u2014 has also put a lot of money in helping CA company to get good contracts abroad. A Crown company, EDC often gives money to foreign companies to encourage them to buy products and services from CA company. The job of EDC in promoting CA company, and the bigger aerospace industry in CA, made the president and CEO of EDC to comment in 2009: \"EDC's history and that of CA's aerospace industry are closely linked\" (Siegel 2009). CA company (2009) also recognizes the vital help of EDC to its operations: \"Export Development CA (EDC)... has been an important source of market-based financing for airlines buying CA company passenger aircraft around the world.\"\n\nLending billions of dollars to possible CA company customers is an important government help to the company's activities.3 In addition, government help through CA Account has been given to CA company in cases where EDC thinks the risk to be too high. CA place is managed by EDC, but the big people in the government decide when to give out money. According to EDC, CA place is used to help with selling things we can't normally sell, but the minister thinks it's good for our country. This is usually because of many risks, like how big the deal is, how risky the market is, how much we can do in a country, who we're lending to, and the conditions of the loan. We manage these deals like we do with our regular work, but the government takes the risks. \n\nCA place has given money at least five times in the past few years to help sell the planes made by a company called BO. BO has also gotten money directly from both the local and the national government: a lot of money from QU province for a part of the C series in 2016, and a loan from OT city that doesn't need to be paid back right away in 2017. A writer named Richard (in a book called \"The WA\") says that the company has gotten so much help from the government, that it's hard to imagine the company without it. Since a long time ago, it has gotten nearly a lot of money from both local and national governments.\"\n\nBO tries to show itself as an important part of our country in the world. Through its ads and promotional stuff, the company says a lot about being from here and wants people to feel proud of it. A main promotional booklet, called \"Our Country's BO\", talks about the company's big achievements, and how it's connected to people and the government here. It also says the company is very connected to our communities: \"As a leader in the industry, BO helps create wealth and helps our communities grow\" (BO 2009). In addition, BO's ads on TV in the late years 2000s wanted people to feel proud when they see BO trains running in other countries they visit. We see this same message in the company's print ads as well. The company's role in making the 2010 Olympic Torch is another way it tries to make people feel patriotic. In a news release in 2010, the company's big boss explains: \"Making the 2010 Olympic Torch has let us use our skills in a way that makes people here feel inspired.\" BO tries to show people that it's doing good things both here and in other countries. These pictures and stories use feelings of patriotism and nationalism, which makes people feel proud of the company's identity. This helps distract people from the potentially bad things about BO's work in other countries, as shown by the case studies in this book.\n\nThe big company from CA country makes people feel proud and happy about their country. This company is a good example of how a company can make people feel good about where they come from. This company also helps people see themselves in a good way. \n\nPeople from CA country help the company in many ways and they also get something good from the company. The company makes money and people can buy parts of the company with their money. This is how people can make money from the company. The company also gives money to the government. So, there are many ways that people and the company are connected. We should think about how the company works in other countries and how people can make money from it.\n\nTHE BIG IDEA OF THIS RESEARCH\n\nThe big idea of this research is about how things are taken away. This idea comes from many smart people like Glen, Nicholas, and Dawn. They say that we need to think about how things are taken away in different places, especially in places where people have come to live from other places. They say that if we only think about how people work and how money is made, we might miss some important things about how things are taken away. In a simple way, Henry (2016: 39) says that \"learning about people who came and took over the land has made us understand how important land is in stories about taking things away.\" The importance of land, and taking land, adds more understanding to many stories of taking things away, as the stories of CH country/TI country and IS country/PA country show. While my look at the SO country story fits a more regular way of understanding, understanding the ways of taking things away in the other two stories needs this extra focus on land, taking over, and people who came and took over. Combining the two ways gives a strong way of understanding for the study at hand.\n\nTaking by Taking Away\n\nTaking by taking away, an idea thought of by famous geographer David, gives a helpful understanding tool for understanding the new structuring of space and place to make the collection of money easier. Building on Marx's idea of first accumulation and Luxemburg's theory of empire, David thinks about how money creates and reproduces the conditions under which collection can happen most profitably. In simpler words, David is interested in explaining the ways through which the social world around us is re-organized regularly in order for money-making to continue to grow.\n\nMoney collection can best be understood as the process by which those who own the tools of making things make profit and build more stocks of money. Although we can easily identify and explain the process of collection at the place of making \u2014 for example, owners who take extra value from workers in a factory \u2014 scholars like David focus on how social spaces and institutions are also shaped to create the conditions for money collection. Given money-making's tendency towards over-collection, extra money needs to be put back into work constantly, which requires the opening up of new spaces for money-making production, such as city building projects in the southern part of the world.\n\nDavid starts with Marx's idea of first accumulation, whereby the relation of money is created in new geographical spaces by taking away people's ability to sustain themselves through collective or non-money-making ways of making things. Taking by taking away, however, includes a bigger range of processes and as David (2005: 145) notes, can include\n\nthe selling and private owning of land and the forceful pushing away of peasant populations; the conversion of various forms of property into exclusive private property rights; the taking away of rights to the common lands; the selling of work power and the taking away of other (local) ways of making and using things; empire, neo-empire, and imperial ways of taking of assets (including natural resources); the changing of exchange and taxation, particularly of land, into money; the trading of slaves; and lending money, the national debt, and ultimately the credit system as radical ways of first accumulation.\n\nDavid's point is that these processes are not part of old history but continue to happen today. People used to share things like land and water together. But now, some people are taking these things to make money. This is like what happened a long time ago when farmers were forced off their land. Now, it's happening in cities where things like water and schools are being sold to make money. \n\nThe country CA has helped its companies make money in other countries. This happened with a company called BO, which got a lot of help to sell its things overseas. \n\nThese days, things that everyone used to share are being sold. This is happening with things like water, schools and houses. It's like when a group of people share something, but then one person takes it to use for themselves. This happened in SA country with a project called GP. Even though the country still owns the project, the company makes money from it. This is like selling something that everyone used to share. \n\nSometimes, selling things that everyone used to share doesn't cause a lot of problems. But sometimes it does, like when people are forced off their land. The GP project in SA country is a good example of this. Even though it looks like a normal business deal, it's still taking something that everyone used to share. Even though it's not as big a deal as in the mining area, it's still not fair because it makes the areas that were created under white people's control stronger.\n\nTaking Things Away, Old Control, and New Control\n\nNowadays, scholars have written many books that look at how new control is different from old control. Two main differences are important for this study. First, old control is about controlling land and using the work power of the local people, while under new control, the goal is to get land and make the local people go away. European control of many African lands, for example, involved using local people to get minerals or work on farms. In most cases, the old control needed local people to get and make the things they wanted to send back home. On the other hand, new control, in NA country, AU country, and maybe IS country, does not need the work of local people but rather needs the local people to go away to get the land. It is a project of change: the goal for newcomers is to \"change local societies with their own\" (P 2014: 147). Patrick (2006: 388) explains that \"land is the specific, important thing\" and that this is the \"main reason for making go away.\" In other words, under new control, \"the most important thing is land/water/air/underground earth... Land is what is most valuable, fought over, needed\" (T and Y 2012: 5).\n\nThe second main difference is that old control powers take resources and use the controlled land from far away, while under new control, the newcomers make a new \"home\" in the controlled land with no plans of leaving. Eve and K. (2012: 5), in their important article \"Decolonization is not a Metaphor,\" summarize this difference between new control and other forms of control by saying that \"newcomers come with the plan of making a new home on the land, a homemaking that insists on newcomer power over all things in their new area.\" In other words, newcomers do not see this as a short project, and thus the process of taking things away becomes very different. Audra (2014: 19) refers to the work of Patrick when explaining these two main parts of new control:\n\nHe [Patrick] argues that new control is defined by a land project \u2014 the getting of land \u2014 whose single focus makes it different from other forms of control. Although the newcomer type wants things, unlike other controls, it is not work but land that it wants... The wanting for land makes \"the problem\" of the local life that is already living on that land.\n\nI am saying that it is important to understand how taking away land is happening in both IS country and CH country, and how trains are involved in both cases.\n\nSome smart people (for example, Cameron 2014; Ben 2014; and Henry 2016) have shared important ideas by thinking about taking away from people's land and how money is involved, talked about before. These new ideas say that while it's useful to think about problems with how money is gathered, it doesn't pay enough attention to how land is taken away because of people moving in and taking over. Henry (2016: 44) says: \"Talking about money doesn't focus enough on people moving in and taking over. This might be more useful for understanding big money trends, with examples in far away places.\" Yes, taking away to gather does a good job of explaining the many ways gathering happens with buying and selling things. However, Ben (2014: 4) says that it is not enough on its own:\n\nBy thinking about the relationship between taking away and people moving in and taking over, the usual meaning of the first is changed by the second. And it is changed, I think, in ways that make thinking about money more relevant to fighting against taking over. Thinking about people's land, in other words, lets us think about how taking away works when people move in and take over.\n\nFor people to move in and take over, \"land is made into something you can own and how people relate to land is only about owning\" (Thomas and Yosef 2012: 5). This is a big attack on how many people who were here first understand their relationships to the land. Moreover, moving these people from the land is not just about moving them somewhere else but also about destroying how they live. Lily (2017: 42) says that moving bodies from the land \"gets rid of the ways our bodies relate to our land.\" Relationships to the land are very important to keep political, spiritual, cultural, and language wholeness in many societies of people who were here first, not to mention the physical need to stay alive. So, moving these people from the land under people moving in and taking over, even if it does not need killing, is like getting rid of a culture. It is important to understand the specific ways of taking away within taking over to make the framework stronger. Cameron (2014: 12) emphasizes this point:\n\nBy not paying enough attention to the wrong of taking away land, thinking and strategies not only risk being part of the very things it should be against, but it also risks not seeing what could be very valuable insights into the practices and conditions needed to build a more fair and lasting world.\n\nIn simple terms, it is not enough to look at taking away without looking at the specific relationships that people who have been taken away from have with the land and how much destruction being taken away from the land involves.\n\nThis book talks about some important things that happened in two places, IS country/PA land and CH country/TI land. Some people think that what happened to the people in PA land is like what happened when one group of people takes over another group's home. For example, in this book, we talk about how IS country took over some land in a big fight with their neighbors, and then moved their own people into that land, which is not allowed. We will talk more about this in Chapter 4, but for now, it's important to remember that we can learn a lot about what happened to the people in PA land by looking at what happens when one group of people takes over another group's home.\n\nThis is also true for what happened in CH country/TI land. The leaders of TI land, who live in another place now, say that CH country taking over TI land is like one group of people taking over another group's home. The big boss of the TI people, Liam, says very strongly, \"There is no fairness in TI land. There is people taking over\" (Samuel and Liam 2011). There are many things about how CH country controls TI land and how the TI people fight back that make us think about what happens when one group of people takes over another group's home. For example, the land is very important to the TI people, and their history of taking care of the land is a big part of why they fight against CH country's rules in TI land. Even though people don't usually say that what's happening in TI land is like one group of people taking over another group's home, it definitely has a lot of the same things, and it helps us understand what's happening if we think about it that way.\n\nIt's important to think about when and where these things happened, because that helps us understand why people fight against one group of people taking over another group's home. Alice (2014: 7\u20138) reminds us that people taking over another group's home is not something that just happened a long time ago, but something that is still happening and people are still fighting against: \"People taking over another group's home is still happening. In this way, it does not do what it is supposed to do: get rid of the original people; take their land.\" Or as Henry (2016: 25) explains: \"People taking over another group's home is always fighting against the original people saying no and fighting back.\" Even though these people mostly study what's happening in NO country, their ideas can help us understand what's happening in many different places. People are still fighting against one group of people taking over another group's home in the stories in this book, and \"fighting and surviving are the only way to really move past people taking over another group's home\" (Victor 2011: 8).\n\nThe other big thing that is important to understand is how important the land is to the people who are fighting against one group of people taking over another group's home. It is hard for people in CA country who are not part of the original group to really understand how important the land is to the original people. We think about land as a thing we can own and use. But this does not mean we do not care about the place. On the other hand, the Indigenous people see the land as a source of learning and power. Their way of ruling, managing resources, and their traditions are all tied to the land. Taking the Indigenous people away from their land is very harmful. It hurts their most important beliefs and ways of organizing. They have written a lot about their relationship with the land and how it has been hurt.\n\nOne of them said, \"All my life, the people I've met who live on the land don't want to give it up. Even if it is hard, they stay on the land. They don't want to own the land. They want to be connected to it. They want to have a good relationship with it.\"\n\nWe can learn from this different way of thinking about the land. We can start to understand why taking away the land is so harmful. Another person explained what this means for their fight against being taken away from the land:\n\nTo put it simply, their fight is not just for the land as a thing, but also for what the land teaches us about how we should live with each other and nature in a good way.\n\nHe used the word \"grounded normativity\" to describe the idea of living in a good way with others and the land. This helps us understand why the Indigenous people's relationship with the land is so different, why taking them away from the land is so harmful, and why the land is so important in their fight against being taken away.\n\nWe need to think about these things when we are looking at projects in IS country and CH country. People in two different places have lost their land. People in both places are fighting for their land and freedom. In TI country, the people have lived with the land for a long time. They are not happy with the CH country because they did not ask before using the land.\n\nThis book talks about people losing their land. It also talks about how the land we are on, in CA country, was taken from the MI people. Long ago, the MI people made a promise with the BR kingdom. They did not give up their land or the things on it. The MI people wanted to be kind and peaceful with the BR people. \n\nIt is important to remember this when we talk about people losing their land. We must remember that people in CA country are part of this problem, even if they are far away. We also need to remember that taking land from others is wrong.\n\nNOTES\n\n1. Some people have written about this. We can look at their work to learn more.\n  \n2. Many people have different ideas about this problem. We can read their work to understand more.\n\n3. It's important to know that the support from the CA country ended up making them lose a big trade argument with the BR country. In 2001, a big trade organization said that the loans from CA country to a big airplane company were not fair and broke the rules of international trade. You can see the full rule at a website.\n\n4. It's also possible that the big airplane company's campaign in the late 20th century was partly because of the criticism they got for what they did in CH country/TE place. This is analyzed in Chapter Two.\n\n5. For two good books on understanding simple gathering, see books by M. (2001) and D. (2001).\n\n6. Rosa's main idea on the topic is about the idea that a closed money system could not use all the extra money made within the system. Thus, the money-makers would need to keep expanding internationally to find new places for money, often in places where non-money making ways of living exist. See Rosa (2003).\n\n7. For a modern discussion of the concept \"too much money,\" see B. (2006). \nCHAPTER TWO\n\nTHE CHINA\u2013TIBET CASE\n\nThe world's tallest train track, reaching very high above sea level at its highest point, started working in 2006 and fulfilled a big dream of connecting TE place to the rest of CH country via train. The completion of the QH\u2013TE Railway was a big accomplishment for the CH country, as former President H. said at the time: \"This is a great thing done by the CH people, and also a miracle in train history\" (BBC World News 2006). However, because of the difficult history between CH country and TE place, the train project has also caused a lot of opposition and criticism since it started. These criticisms have been about problems related to the train track, to serious concerns regarding the impact on TE place people's way of life, identity, culture, autonomy, and self-determination.\n\nThe TE place cause in general has attracted a lot of interest around the world from people, and the railway in particular was an important focus of this attention in the early 21st century. Actor Richard (2006), chair of the International Campaign for TE place, argued:\n\nThis railway across the top of the world will result in more CH military in TE place, speed up the already bad exploitation of its natural resources and increase the number of CH settlers, pushing the TE place people to the side even more.\n\nIndeed, the new train track is an important part of the CH country's attack on TE place independence and self-determination. The train line makes the occupation of TE place deeper and helps several processes of gathering and change in TE place that are causing a lot of pain for the TE place people.\n\nBombardier and some friends helped provide 361 train cars for the QI\u2013TE line. Bombardier's work in this big project caused some problems. Some people view CH rule over TE as a form of control. The CH plan to make TE better is focused on CH people and follows a pattern of development. The western region and especially the TE plateau will, according to this plan, provide resources for a big city\" (Norbu, a long time ago). As the QI\u2013TE train line is a big part of this process, it helps us think about the role of Bombardier in a tough situation far away.\n\nUNDERSTANDING THE PAST OF CH-TE\n\nIt is important to understand the past of CH/TE to understand the problem of Bombardier's work in the QI\u2013TE fast train project. The project is in a context of a long-lasting argument about the status of TE, and many of the problems with the train are related to the disagreement about the place of TE within (or outside of) CH. It is important to give a short description of the main points of this long political argument.\n\nSince TE is a place many people argue about, there are different ideas about what TE really is. The CH state sees TE as\n\nthe TE Autonomous Region (TAR), which is the southern part of the TE Plateau, far from BE city. But only half of all TEs live there, and the area only includes half the TE Plateau. The other half of the 6 million TEs live in the CH provinces of QI, GA, SI and YU, making them less seen. (Lafitte, a long time ago)\n\nThe TE Autonomous Region (TAR) is the name the CH state gave to the administrative unit containing the capital of TE \u2014 LA \u2014 a long time ago. However, there are TEs living in nearby CH provinces, and even outside the CH borders, in a bigger space called the TE Plateau. Breaking the TE Plateau up into the TAR and four additional CH provinces was a way for the CH state to keep its hold on TE and deny attempts to join historic TE to resist CH rule. The TAR is often understood as \"political TE,\" while the bigger geographic space is referred to as \"TE for TEs.\" And for TEs, this difference is often described as the difference between \"TE\" and \"Bigger TE,\" which also includes TEs living in the neighbouring states of NE, BH, and IN. TEs argue the small geographic view of TE asserted by the CH state, saying instead that TE should be seen as the bigger geographic space of the TE Plateau. In this book, I use the way the people from TI place describe their home. Gabriel explains why this is a good idea:\n\nTI place is special because the way the people live and the land are very linked. This is unique to this place in the middle of the big land. Whether you look at the high land, the language, the food, the crops, or how things are made, everything points to TI place being a special place. If you look at the areas that CH country says are ruled by the people from TI place, it covers almost all of TI place. This includes different parts like TA, QI, GA, SI, and YU areas.\n\nSo, in this book, TI place doesn't just mean TA area but the bigger area that people often call \"people from TI place's land.\" When talking about the part that is ruled by the people from CH country, I use \"the TA.\"\n\nThere are many different ideas about what TI place is, or is not. These ideas come from different views of history and more than sixty years of rule by CH country over TI place. Officials from CH country and people from TI place who love their home have different ideas about the history of TI place. This is important for understanding what is happening in TI place today. According to the people from CH country, \"for more than 700 years, the main government of CH country has ruled TI place, and TI place has never been its own country. There was no word for 'its own country' in the language of TI place in the late 20th century.\" However, this view of history \"does not deal with the fact that the people from TI place are from TI place and that before 1950 most areas of TI place... were mainly ruled by the people from TI place in their own language.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the Government of TI place in Exile argues: \"From a law point of view, TI place has not lost its statehood. It is its own country under illegal rule. Neither CH country's army invasion nor the continuing rule by the PLA [People's Liberation Army] has given the rule of TI place to CH country.\" This history is unavoidably a topic of argument, with both sides using history and reasons to support their view. On one side, the state of CH country says that TI place has always been a part of CH country, while on the other side, the people from TI place who love their home say that TI place has always been its own country. Barry and June point out that, \"as with many arguments about who owns what, the many words written in arguments over historical claims have not made a sea of wisdom.\"\n\nIt's important to talk about the word \"first people\" when we talk about the people from TI place. The big country says there are no \"first people\" in their land and calls the people from TI place a small group of people. They say that \"all people from our country are first people\". People from TI place, both inside and outside their home, don't often call themselves \"first people\". For people in TI place, saying they're \"first people\" is too much under the current rules; instead, it's only right to call them a small group. It looks like a smart choice in TI place to talk to the big country in a way that is best for the people from TI place, which means following the rules about different groups and ideas set by the big country. For people from TI place who live outside, and especially the main group (or the group outside), \"being first people means having power but not leaving, which limits leaving the big country\" (LI 2017). This is based on their understanding of \"first people\" movements as usually not wanting to leave the country they live in; the group outside prefers to show its identity as a land that was taken and maybe wants to leave the big country (or at least have lots of power inside the big country). However, recent ideas may suggest some people from TI place who live outside are thinking about this differently, especially as the idea of being \"first people\" changes and helps bring together different movements against taking lands. DA LI (2017) explains this idea like this:\n\nPeople from TI place living in NO place, for example, have thought about these possibilities by supporting \"first people\" movements like the ID movement in CA country, and recently the NO DA movement in US country in group places. These movements also became ways for people from TI place like me to think about being \"first people\" as a way to fight against taking lands, power, saying no, and possible support.\n\nThis new way of understanding the identity and fight of people from TI place outside their home means that \"regular people from TI place in NO place are now thinking about being 'first people' as defined by 'first people' movements to talk about the recent history of taking land in TI place and the ongoing history of people from TI place.\" While understanding the bigger picture of how people from TI place usually see themselves, I use LI's new idea in this discussion as a starting point to carefully talk about the people from TI place as a group that was taken over, with many parts of the big country's takeover looking like taking and settling lands.\n\nOne big idea is said over and over in the books about the history and fight between the big country and the people from TI place: \"There is no clear history that can say if TI place was always a free land or a part of the big country\" (AN 2006: 287). More importantly, saying the relationship in such strong words is quite new for both groups. Long ago, when TI country was invaded in the year that started with '1' and had four numbers, the people of TI country used different words to talk about their relationship with other countries. These words are not used in the WE world today. David (2008: 21) talks about the relationship with the invaders:\n\nTI country became part of the invader's big place, but the rulers of the big place let the leaders of TI country control it. This was a special kind of friendship known as ch-y. The leaders of TI country gave the big place's ruler a special kind of power. He, in return, let the leaders of TI country control their own things. From then on, the people of TI country used this special friendship to deal with both the invaders and the people of CH country, with different results.\n\nThis special friendship also existed when MA country ruled. It showed that both parties in the friendship were important and let the people of TI country do things their own way. Matthew (1991: 44) says that in the past, \"for the people of TI country, the Da Lama and the Ma emperor were seen as a teacher and friend rather than a servant and boss.\" So, the time that started with '1' and had four numbers brought a world where both sides needed to change to the main language of being free, choosing for oneself, and being independent that controlled the world community. While CH country has always said that TI country is a part of it, the people of TI country who resist this say that TI country should be free and independent (or at least do things their own way). This change to new words to talk about what both sides want is an important historical change in the relationship and has made it hard to agree even today.\n\nThe people of TI country, known for having a special language, way of life, belief, and way of organizing things, have lived on the TI place since at least the time that started with '7'. This is the time when TI country became one under the rule of Song, and Bu belief came to TI country from NI country. People who study history often start with the rule of Song and the spread of Bu belief at this time, as this belief played a big role in defining the political, spiritual, and cultural lives of the people of TI country from then on. However, the people of TI country lived on what is now known as the TI place for many years before Bu belief came, with some stories saying that TI empires existed as far back as the time that started with '1' and had four numbers (Central TI Administration n.d.b.). Overall, there is a long history of a special people called the people of TI country, who have lived as a unique political and social community for a very long time in what is now known as the TI place.\n\nAbout the relationship with CH country, \"a big stone in front of the Jo Temple in LA city remembers a friendship between TI country and CH country from the year 822, which happened after many fights, including a short time when the people of TI country's soldiers were in the Ta Dynasty's big city at CH\" (David 2008: 21\u201322). In the next many years, TI land was taken over and ruled by the MO people, and then by the MA people from CH country from a time long ago until the late 19th century. But, the real control and rule over TI land by its \"rulers\" during these times was not much. A famous person, Matthew, argues: \"By the mid-19th century, the MA people's influence was very small. For example, the big fights between TI land and DO place, between TI land and NE country, and the invasion of TI land by the BR people were fought and settled without help from the CH people.\" Despite the debate over how much control the CH people had over TI land during those years, most people agree that from the early 20th century until the mid-20th century, TI land was free from CH country. After the CH people overthrew the MA rulers,\n\nthe Dalai Lama sent away the last MA soldiers and... said TI land was a free country. From the early 20th century until the mid-20th century, TI land was a free country, controlling its own things, as well as its borders and relations with other countries. It joined as an equal with BR country and CH country at a big meeting, called to draw the borders between IN country, TI land, and CH country. \n\nMatthew repeats this point: \"Though the nature of the relationship between CH country and TI land before the early 20th century may be open to dispute, TI land unquestionably controlled its own things during the period from the early 20th century to the mid-20th century and tried many times to secure recognition and validation of its freedom.\" Yet it is also true that the people in charge in CH country continued to believe that TI land was historically part of CH country, and that it needed to be eventually joined with the \"mother\" country.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, under the leadership of Mao, CH soldiers entered TI land in order to bring the territory under CH control. The Dalai Lama first tried to work with Mao on a peaceful change toward making TI land part of CH country as a free region, as the CH forces were clearly stronger than the TI resistance. In addition, Mao believed that the joining of TI land into CH country needed to go slowly and with the agreement of the TI people. Van, a writer, summarizes Mao's approach as follows:\n\nSo Mao thought that TI land's joining with CH country was non-negotiable. Yet he had no intention of simply doing away with the old system and imposing CH rule in TI land. Knowing that there was no support for socialist reform in TI land, he adopted a more gradual approach. Thus, between the mid-20th century and the end of the 1950s, the CH Communists got along with the TI nobles and did little to change the old social system in TI land.\n\nBut this was not to last. One of the key changes was the first Five-Year-Plan, announced by the CH people in 1953, which involved reorganizing farming across the country. According to Victor (2011), \"this meant that land was to be 'shared,' with the aim of changing from the old system of land owners and farmers to the creation of friendly groups.\" The move to change land ownership was not liked by monasteries, wanderers, and land-owning classes in TI country. This led to fights between people in TI country and the CH country authorities (Victor 2011).\n\nMatthew's big plan in 1958 was another point of disagreement for people in TI country. The plan involved joining together farmer groups into big groups, with the goal of making more things. However, as summarized by Victor (2011: 226), \"Matthew's big plan was bad, leading to one of CH country's worst food shortages and many people died.\" Others, such as Frank (2011), say the number of people who died was even bigger. These events led the leader of TI country to leave in 1959 and live in North IN city along with many of his followers. The people who left TI country have since worked towards freeing their country and building good communities for themselves in IN city and other places. They decided that it was no longer possible to find a good place for TI country within CH country. The CH country sees their move into TI country as freeing the region and finishing a project to make clear their historical position regarding TI country. On the other hand, the people from TI country see the move as a violation of their rights. They see themselves as a country under control and argue that CH country is not respecting their rights to decide things for themselves in many ways. As we look at the various problems with the train line in this chapter, it will become clear that, despite what CH country says, the people from TI country are indeed under control and at risk of losing many important parts of their way of life.\n\nFor those who stayed in TI country, being under control meant that \"a harsh effort had begun to replace TI country's culture with a different ideology\" (Cameron 2008: 5). The way of life in TI country, based on a spiritual and material connection to the land, was about to undergo a big change. After centuries of relative freedom and self-rule, TI country was now under total control of the CH country. The CH country's treatment of people in TI country has been widely documented since the control began in 1950. A group that watches for fair treatment summarizes its 2017 findings in TI country: \"Authorities in TI country continue to severely restrict freedom of religion, speech, movement, and assembly\" (HRW 2018). When describing the one-party state in recent years, HRW (n.d.) explains as follows:\n\nSince President XI took power in 2013, the government has detained and prosecuted hundreds of activists and defenders of human rights. It has increased control over organizations, activists, media, and the internet through new laws that see activism and peaceful criticism as threats to state security.\n\nFor people from TI place, many parts of their way of life are seen as wrong by CH country. In recent years, their language is not allowed to be the first language in schools anymore. If their language is gone, it would be very bad for them, like it would be for any group of people. Also, CH country does not like people who speak against this. A group called AI documented a case of a person named Thomas, who wanted schools to teach in their language. Thomas was accused of causing trouble for being in a NE paper talking about CH country not allowing their language and culture. He was found guilty and had to go to jail for five years. Another person, Tenzin, from an international group, said that Thomas was seen as doing something wrong for showing CH country's failure to protect the right to education and for trying to get their language taught in schools. Thomas's case shows a larger attempt by CH country to erase the identity and way of life of people from TI place. I will talk about this again later when discussing problems with the rail line.\n\nIn addition to the problems about the status and control of TI place, there have been big economic problems about TI place being part of CH country. When CH country started controlling TI place in the past, they inherited a simple economy that was mostly farming and nomadic. CH country started to modernize, including building two big roads into TI place, along with a hospital, bank, and post office in the capital by the middle of the 20th century. However, people from TI place did not necessarily benefit from the fast and long-lasting economic growth that happened in many parts of CH country in the past half century. This eventually led to a bigger economic plan for TI place from the CH country authorities:\n\nRealizing that TI place and other areas in western CH country were left behind in CH country's economic boom, in the late 20th century, the leader of CH country, Jack, announced a big investment plan called XZ, \"Open Up the West.\" That same year, teams of scientists were sent to TI place to work on secret projects about the resources there.\n\nThis plan to develop the western parts of CH country more started a time of big state spending in TI place that resulted in strong economic growth in the region. As I argue later, this economic growth in TI place represents a type of \"disempowered development,\" as the policies have been decided by people not from TI place and by the changes of political dynamics happening outside TI place in ways that have little to do with actual conditions within TI place. The plan also included moving more people from CH country into TI place, which had already been happening quickly for years. We talk again about new people coming to live in TI place when we talk about the fast train, but for now it's important to know that this part of CH rule over TI place is really important to understand why many say the growing money in TI place is not fair. Norbu gives us a money look at what the impact of new people coming to TI place is:\n\nThe new people coming to TI place has had big bad effects on the people who lived there first. The new people and their children get better houses, jobs, schools, businesses, and hospitals than the first people, who are pushed to the edges of this new money world as things for tourists to look at. In 1992, a tourist did a secret look at the TA place. He saw that there were 12,227 shops and restaurants in LA city (not counting the BA place) and only 300 were owned by the first people. In TS place, southern KH, the new people owned 133 businesses while the first people only owned 15. This owning is the same in other first people towns: 748 to 92 in CH city, 229 to 3 in PO place.\n\nSo, it looks like the CH rule over the land of TI place and the money project has given more to the new people and the CH rule, and less to the first people of TI place. We talk about this part of taking things away later in the chapter.\n\nTHE QU\u2013TI TRAIN PROJECT AND BO\n\nTrains have been an important part of moving things and people all over the world since the 19th century, and the CH rule has been very interested in connecting its main things in the east to the west parts of the country, including TI place. After CH rule started in 1949, train building went faster, and \"by the early 1990s, CH had a pretty good train network, with two-thirds of cities connected by train\" (Wang et al. 2009: 769). It was also during this time that the CH rule started building train things towards the west parts of CH. One of the first steps was the building of a train line from LA city to XI city in 1959, \"marking the first time a train came to the TI high place\" (Arya 2008: 107). This line was made longer in 1979 from XI city to GO city, which became the future place of the extension to LA city in the early 21st century.\n\nThe QU\u2013TI train project made one of Mao's first big goals for the CH rule come true: the building of a fast train line into TI place. Shailender Arya (2008: 107) writes about the process in the 1990s like this:\n\nIn July 1994 the Third Big Meeting for Work in TI place was held at BE city by the Party. It told officials to take away TI place's being alone from CH and help create \"a link that can't be broken\" between the two money worlds. Soon, on the 7th October 1994, the push towards LA city was officially said. In the late 20th century, CH country made a plan. They wanted to build something big. They started building in 2001, and finished in 2006. They made a long path for trains that took a lot of money to build. When they finished, CH country was very proud because they had a lot of trains like big countries. In 2007, they had many trains only less than US and RU countries. The leader of CH country was proud because it showed that CH country was strong and could do big things. They also wanted to build more train paths in TI place and other places near TI place. They wanted to build another path to LH city from CH city. They also had plans to build more paths near the borders of IN, BH and NE countries. Building this big path changed the people in TI place a lot, and it helped CH country go to TI place easier.\n\nA company called BO started working with CH country many years ago. They helped CH country by giving them things for trains. But, it was not until the late 20th century and early 21st century that BO became a big company in CH country. BO had many workers in CH country and they had offices in BE, SH, GU and HO cities. They made many trains and planes in CH country. They were proud that they had made many trains and planes for CH country.\n\nIn this way, BO got the job to give trains for a big project in CH country. In 2005, they said that they and their partners got a job from CH country. They would make and give 361 cars for a new train path to LH city in TI place. The order was for a lot of money, with part of it going to a big company. They also talked about the train cars:\n\nThe order included 308 normal cars and 53 special cars for tourists. The trains will have special stuff like extra air systems and protection from the sun. The special tourist trains will be really nice with personal showers, windows for seeing everything around, and places for eating and having fun.\n\nThe trains were made and have been working well since a year ago.\n\nThe project is a big part of a plan to make the western parts of a big country better. The train line is important for bringing different parts of the country together. People say that the project is good because it will help the area grow and get better. They think that having better ways to move things around will make things cheaper in the area and also help sell things from the area to other parts of the country. But, some people don't agree with this plan and think it might not be good.\n\nPROBLEMS WITH THE PROJECT\n\nSome people say that the new train line will bring lots of good things to the people in the area and will help bring the western parts of the country closer to the rest of the country. Building the railway was a big part of the money that was spent in the area since 2001, as the plan to make the west better has been moving fast. According to some reports, the result of this plan in the area has been fast and good growth. The government says: \"In a recent year, the area had a lot of growth, for many years in a row\" (source). Fast growth in the area is usually because of more tourists, more mining, spending on buildings and other things, and more trade. Moreover, a lot of this good \"growth\" is because of the new fast train line. A person who knows a lot about the area from a big school in AU country, says that \"a good thing about the train is that it makes things cheaper for the people in the area, who, like everyone else in the world, like things for their homes, but usually had to pay a lot\" (quoted in source).\n\nSo, the big country's two main ways of helping the TI place's economy \u2014 visitors and digging for things \u2014 are all said to help a lot with making TI place better and helping people not be poor. While it seems that the train has helped some parts of TI place to grow, there are many worries about the kind of growth that is happening and some big issues with the project. Teachers, TI place people who want freedom, and groups around the world that help the TI place people have a lot to say against the QI\u2013TI train line. In general, they say that the project helps the big country keep control of TI place, including being able to quickly send soldiers and other people to keep things under control. There are also other criticisms that have to do with money, culture/spirit, and the environment.\n\nBefore we talk about the many problems with the train line, it's important to say that it's very hard to get true information from inside TI place. A writer and news person from CA country who has traveled a lot in TI place explains how hard it is to get real news from there:\n\nGetting any kind of information on TI place is very hard because there's no news allowed in TI place. It is like a dark hole. News doesn't get in, news doesn't get out. People from other countries who write news are not allowed in TI place; a few of them get to go there for short, planned trips where every step is watched by big country people. And getting information can be risky in the big country. Information disappears, along with the person who brought it. Anything to do with TI place is a big secret for the big country's government. So, getting information out of TI place is seen as \"telling government secrets.\" For people in TI place, being accused of this could mean many years in jail, though it is never said what these government secrets are.\n\nThe reason it's hard to get true information is because of the big country's strict and unfair control in TI place and the total lack of basic rights. In a place where more money is spent on keeping things under control than on keeping the country safe (CA writer 2014: 19), the experience for people in TI place is one where saying anything against the government is very dangerous. A group that watches out for people's rights did a study from 2013\u201315, which looked at 479 cases of people from TI place being held, tried, or found guilty in the big country. This report shows what people who care about rights in TI place have been saying for years: the big country is doing a campaign of scaring and hurting any kind of political, social, or cultural resistance to big country's rule in TI place. The report summarizes its findings like this:\n\nOur study shows that the government is being less and less patient with ways of talking and gathering that are protected under international law. This has been marked by an increase in government control over daily life, more criminalization of peaceful forms of protest, and sometimes too strong responses to local protests. These measures, part of a policy known as \"stability maintenance,\" have led the government to target more and more activities and issues for control in TI place, especially in the countryside.\n\nMany of the things HRW looked at happened in the country parts of TI land, and a lot of the people were \"local leaders, people who care about nature, and villagers who do things in their community, as well as local writers and singers.\" It's hard to hear from the people of TI land about what's happening because of very strong rules, especially against those who might not agree with CH rule. Also, a group that talks about freedom for news people, in its report from a little while ago, says CH is very low in the list of countries that let news people do their work. This makes it hard to get true information. So, this part relies on a lot of information from outside of the rail project, both from people who know a lot and writers who have been to TI land a lot and from people with strong connections to communities in TI land and who have had to leave TI land.\n\nThings to do with Soldiers\n\nThe first big worry about the train has to do with how fast the CH state can send soldiers and other safety people along the train line, as well as things to help these people. The ability to send military/safety things into the area has two main uses: inside, it's used to control and stop disagreement within TI land, and outside, it's used to show military power toward IN country and other places in the area. A man named Henry (2005) explains these two goals simply, saying that the train\n\nwill replace many of the long trucks on dangerous roads that take guns, oil, coal and food to the big group of soldiers along TI land's border with IN country, as well as the groups of soldiers and armed police in the inside to stop pro-freedom activity.\n\nIn the past, TI land was a big problem for the CH state in terms of moving soldiers and supplies fast enough. To control pro-freedom activities, like protests, riots, and soldier uprisings, the CH government has had to use ground travel a lot. It often took days, if not weeks, to send people and supplies to the TI land high flat area. The new train line has changed this problem a lot:\n\nThe travel time from GO city to the TI land capital has been cut down a lot from 72 hours to 16 hours which affects the movement of soldiers. As reported by a news agency, the CH government itself has praised the railway as a way of moving soldiers, saying that not only will the railway make the army better, but the army will make the railway better. (Adam 2008: 117\u2013118)\n\nOne writer talks about a time where trucks with armor were sent along the QI\u2013TI land train line to help stop trouble in TI land in a month in 2008 (Adam 2008: 118). These movements are much faster and easier for the CH state and help it do its big job of stopping disagreement across the big area of TI land.\n\nThe CH government can also use the new train to show its strength and make sure its western borders with places like IN country are safe. The train line, together with the second train line being built, will allow the CH government to quickly move soldiers, weapons, and other supplies to its border with IN country. After a short fight in the late 20th century, both IN country and CH country have kept their soldiers in much of the disputed land. Sometimes, there are problems in several disputed areas, most recently in BH place, when in a certain year CH soldiers crossed into land claimed as part of the BH place. BH place immediately asked for help from IN country, and a stand-off between IN and CH soldiers happened. While this type of confrontation is not usually expected to get bigger, the CH government is getting the ability to quickly send and supply the military along the border with IN country. Furthermore, the goal of political stability in a certain place is essential to any military hopes outside. It is a known fact that one of the main reasons for the soldiers to pull back after a one-month occupation of certain places was the serious unrest in a certain place at the time. Thus, the goal of securing a certain place works together with showing military strength outside.\n\nEconomic Impact\n\nThe second big problem with the train involves the challenge of understanding the economic impact of the train for people. While the CH government boasts of the benefits of increased visitors, mining, and trade for the economy, there are many layers of understanding the economic legacy of the train. First, one should always read CH economic statistics with a lot of caution. An article from a famous newspaper notes: \"The CH government says a lot of visitors will enter the region this year, a big increase in a decade since it opened a train route across the high-altitude plateau. It is projecting arrivals to rise to more visitors in a couple of years.\" However, with a bit of digging, the journalists discovered that when the CH government counts tourists, they count the total number of places visited instead of the number of people. This inflates the numbers by a lot. The article also states: \"In a certain year, a committee also examined the CH government's 'contradictory' tourism data, noting that reported train arrivals in a certain year exceeded the railway's carrying capacity.\" The CH government has an interest in making it seem as though its investments in a certain place are mostly beneficial, and hence its information has a propaganda component.\n\nMore importantly, there are serious concerns regarding the impact of tourism on the people. First, there is the question of who benefits financially from the rush of tourists entering a certain place. Most of the economy within cities is dominated by businesspeople, and very little of the tourism revenue trickles down to the people. The people from CH country came to live in TI place, bringing many of their own people with them. This made it hard for the TI people to have a say in important things, like inviting people to visit their place. A man named Adam (2005: 52) who studied the TI economy very well, said this about the problem:\n\nThe fact that big companies from outside TI control a lot of the inviting-people business makes it so that a lot of the money from this business just leaves TI after a short time. For example, most of the visitors in TI are people from CH and they usually stay in places owned and run by CH people in the west side of TI city, near a lot of CH food places and fun places.\n\nInviting people to visit TI is a big part of their economy that makes it hard for TI people to be included. We will talk about this problem again when we discuss the challenges with the new train line, as the changes to TI's culture and religious ways could be a much bigger problem than the unfair money gains. It is also hard to separate each of the effects, as they are all connected.\n\nAnother money problem with the train involves the second big part of CH's money plan in TI: taking resources. While it is hard to get sure numbers, it is generally known that there are a lot of important minerals in TI, like copper, gold, lead, zinc, and others. The CH state is eager to use these minerals to get much-needed raw materials for its continuing factory boom, and it is also important to note that \"big mining in TI would not be possible without the train to carry minerals in a money-saving way\" (Benjamin 2014: 22). The new train line is very important to making sure that mining in TI can make money and was one of the big reasons for such a big investment in moving things around. Also, getting these minerals needs the moving (and sometimes replacing) of the TI people from the land in ways that match our theory talk about how people come to live in other places described in Chapter 1.\n\nPutting aside the nature worries with mining in TI for a moment, the money and people effects have shown worrying trends. There have been many claims that many TI people have been made to move to make way for mining projects. Nearly half of the TI people are herders and have lived a moving-around life for a very long time, which has made it hard for CH plans to take minerals all over TI. People rights groups have been watching and telling about claims of forced moving in TI for many years, and some sources say that more than two million TI nomads have been moved from the land they have lived on for generations (Free TI n.d.). In the early 2000s, the leaders of CH country made some big changes to the places where a lot of people from TI land lived:\n\nThey told many people who took care of animals to stop doing that and move to new houses in or near towns, changing their old way of life.\n\nThe leaders of CH country wanted to make TI land more modern and hoped the people there would join in the new way of doing things. But, many people did not want this change, and it made things very hard for them. \"Without their old way of life, these people find it hard to join in city life and business, and they worry about their future,\" said a big news company. Not long ago, some people from TI land who live in IN country said that \"between a lot and a lot more people who took care of animals in TI land have been made to leave their lands, while places to find gold and other things have been growing\" (KH year). The problem of making people from the country move was also watched by a man from the UN named Oliver. He said:\n\nIt's wrong to take away how people live, and it's important to respect how people who've been around a long time take care of nature (art. 8 (j)). CH country has agreed to these rules. Oliver asks CH country's leaders to stop making people who take care of animals leave their lands and stop making other people in the country move or live in new houses. (UN year)\n\nMaking people from TI land leave might make CH country break some big rules. Oliver's work shows what many groups have been saying about how making people leave hurts them.\n\nMaking people from TI land leave so others can find things in the ground is like many other things that have happened around the world. Here, finding things and taking them away makes people who used to live there leave. This is happening in TI land too, where the leaders of CH country are making people from TI land leave so they can take more things from the ground. This is not fair to the people from TI land, and it makes their lives very hard. The people who take care of animals, who are many and have lived on the Plateau for a long, long time, \"see themselves as people who take what nature gives; all they need to do is keep moving, never staying too long\" (LA year: 19). People in TI country, who move from place to place, live by growing a type of grain, making wool and butter. Their land has enough to make them comfortable and give them food if they know how to use it well. Their belief and way of life are shaped by their connection to the land. Taking them away from their land is a very bad thing. It is hard to think that people who have lived with the land for a very long time can just move to a new place and start a new life. But this is what has happened to them.\n\nThere is also the question of who gets the good from digging out things from the ground and why the local people were not asked about this. A man named Gabriel, who has spent time with these people, has written about how this digging hurts the people and how the people who don't agree with it are treated badly. He tells many stories from the people who live where the digging is happening. They say that a big businessman from CH country made a deal with the rulers and started digging. The people were not asked about it at all. They just started digging. The people have not gotten anything from it, but it looks like some rulers are getting good from it.\n\nSome people don't want the digging to happen, no matter who gets the good from it. Others think it will happen anyway and want the good to be shared with the local people. Gabriel's book has many stories from the people, almost all of whom did not want their names to be known to avoid trouble. The book tells us that almost all of the people who work in the digging are from outside TI country, the local people were not asked, and the bad things that happen to the local people are more than the good things. Gabriel says that because the local people are not treated fairly and are not part of the decisions, they feel they are the ones who have to deal with the bad things and don't get any of the good. They are sad about the digging and about being ruled by CH country.\n\nSome people, including the rulers of CH country, say that TI country is better off because of the money coming in from outside. But, not everyone in TI country is benefitting from this money. Scholar Adam has studied the economy of a place we'll call TI country. Adam notes the fast growth in TI country over the last 20 years, but warns that it's \"not fair growth.\" The growth in TI country - from more mining, visitors, big building projects, and better roads - has mostly helped the people from CH country and not the people from TI country. Adam explains this:\n\nThis means that even with the fast growth, or because it's not fair and depends on money from outside, most people from TI country are left out. In other words, they can't join or benefit from the fast-growing parts of the economy, while their traditional farming and herding jobs can't support them as well.\n\nWhile the average person from TI country is a little better off than 20 years ago, this is not surprising to Adam because of the big amounts of state money put into TI country. He suggests that \"what is surprising is how little actually reaches the people.\" The big economic problem seems to be that people from TI country are not benefiting enough from, or controlling, their economy \u2014 a problem made worse by the new railway. Also, the problems with people being forced to move are more than just about money. Politically, it's an attack on their right to decide for themselves, and it affects their culture and spiritual life.\n\nEffects on the Spiritual and Cultural life of people from TI country\n\nThe third worry about the overall impact of the railroad involves the spiritual and cultural aspects of life for people from TI country. This worry connects with both the economic and environment problems related to the rail project, and the general control of life in TI country by people from CH country. The cultural and spiritual life of people from TI country is based on Buddhism and many years of living a balanced life in a tough climate. It's well known that \"religious practice and Buddhist rules are a part of daily life for most people from TI country\" and that monks and nuns \"work hard to protect and promote TI country's environment, language and culture\". Their spirituality, culture, and language are deeply connected to the land where they have lived for many years. \n\nThe land is filled with meaning for the people from TI country. It's important to understand the connection between their identity and the land to understand the true impact of the occupation of TI country by people from CH country. The people from CH country are making a lot of changes in TI land. They are making new things and moving the TI people away. This is making the TI people lose their land and their way of life.\n\nThe holy houses and holy men are very important in TI land. People like Benjamin and Jessica say: \"Being holy and being a leader are connected in TI land.\" The big holy man, David, is also the leader of the TI people who live far away. This has made problems with the CH people living in TI land, because they don't trust the holy men and their connection to the leaders. Since the CH people came, the TI people can't practice their faith freely. The number of holy houses and holy men is controlled. The holy houses that are left are watched closely, and in most places in TI, you can't have a picture of David. Many TI people see the CH people living in their land as a big threat to their faith and to their special identity as TI people. Moving the TI people and limiting their faith are seen as attacks on the TI people's identity and their leaders. The TI people believe that being holy and being a leader are connected, so the holy houses are not just holy places, but also important places of leadership and resistance. So, the CH people try to control the TI people's faith to stop them from resisting.\n\nThe TI people are worried that the new railway brings in a lot of visitors, CH settlers, and takes away their resources. This could hurt their unique culture and religion. The TI people often call the new settlers coming in after the railway was built the \"second invasion.\" The CH leaders don't say how many CH people are living in TI, but it is believed that most of them live in cities like LA and that more than half of the people in LA are now CH people. The worry is that LA will lose its TI identity as more and more CH settlers come to live and work there. When the railway was being built, David said that \"some kind of culture ending is happening. In general a railway is very useful to grow, but not when it's used to change the people\" (said in WA 2005). David's warning about the culture ending is not just about the changes in the people living there. Some people living in a place we'll call TI country are being replaced. This makes their culture disappear. This also includes moving people who move from place to place in TI country, losing their language and spiritual freedom, hurting the earth, and damaging the way they used to live. These are the real changes happening because of new people coming to TI country.\n\nThe money from people visiting can be good for the economy, but the CH people's plan to increase visitors can also hurt the spirituality and culture of the people in TI country. There are stories that the CH leaders have turned religious places into places for tourists against the wishes of the local people. According to a group that helps free TI country (2017), \"Some religious places have been changed to turn them into places for tourists, or changed to make space for eating places, hotels and shops. People who study religion have reported lots of tourists coming to their religious places every day, disturbing their studies and way of life.\" Another group \u2014 TI Centre for People's Rights and Freedom (TCHRD) \u2014 shared stories about a religious place that was partly broken to make room for tourists in eastern TI country: \"La Gar, the world's largest TI religious school, looks like a cut fruit, a year after CH leaders broke thousands of places where people lived and study religion\" (TCHRD 2017). The TCHRD says that this is part of an ongoing plan by the CH leaders to change the site into a place where tourists can come and spend money. They say that the CH leaders are turning religious places and practices into shows for tourists and that it is happening without the agreement of the local people. An article in a big newspaper (2016) says that, after the damage done to La Gar and the sending away of people who study religion, \"three women who study religion have reportedly ended their own lives\" and \"of the more than 140 people from TI country who have set fire to themselves since 2011 to protest against CH rule, many were pushed to do so by harsh rules at their own religious place.\" Setting yourself on fire is a sad way of protesting that is sometimes used in TI country when other ways to express unhappiness do not work, and its common use over the past ten years shows the level of sadness faced by people from TI country to the big changes they are against.5\n\nThe Earth's Health\n\nThe fourth and final big thing to think about when looking at the impact of the train project is a lot of concerns about the earth's health. To start, there are many challenges with the actual building and running of the railway itself. The hard things that need to be solved include developing new technology to build and keep the tracks on frozen ground; making sure the rare animals in the region are safe; protecting the grasslands and wetlands; and getting rid of the construction waste in a way that is good for the earth (Q and Z 2010: 860). Many people have looked at the challenges with building the project, as it truly is a big thing to achieve. Most people suggest that the CH leaders, and the companies involved in the project, have done extra things to make sure that the above concerns are taken care of. For example, cooling systems are used in the rail to stop the frozen ground from melting, and \"33 animal passageways were built along the railway to help the animals move and mate\" (Q and Z 2010: 862). People say that we need to be careful about the changes a new train can make to the land and the animals that live there. This train can help bring more people and things to TI place. This can cause problems for the land and animals. Some people are worried about the digging for rocks and building of big water walls. The train is part of bigger plans to use the land and water of TI place. \n\nThis place has a lot of ice mountains and big rivers start from there and go to other big places. One man says, \"Almost 2 billion people need the water from TI place for drinking, farming, fishing, and making things.\" He says in his book that the big water walls are making people leave their homes, hurting the grasslands because of water, and making it hard for people to get food and water. \n\nAnother woman, Jane, says that TI place is very important. It has a lot of ice, but the ice is melting very quickly. In the last 50 years, 82% of the ice mountains have become smaller. In the last 10 years, 10% of the frozen ground has melted. If this continues, it will change the water for a lot of people and change the air over half of the world.\n\nThe land and animals of TI place need a lot of care in the next years to keep the ice, water, and frozen ground safe. The plans to use TI place more can cause a lot of problems. Jane's study shows that the big water walls are not helping the people or the land, but causing more problems. This will not only affect the people of TI place, but everyone in the world.\n\nDigging in TI place can cause many problems for our Earth. Some people say that it can hurt the dirt, mountains, and grass from digging; make water sources dirty with bad chemicals; change how water flows under the ground by digging; and cause landslides and rockslides that can hurt animals' homes. An organization named \"GE\" (2014) also talked about the problems with digging in TI place; they looked at a very big coal mine on a big plateau, which is \"14 times bigger than LO city.\" They say: \"After many trips to the far away region, looking at satellite images and talking to legal experts, GE campaigners have found out that the coal development... breaks a number of water protection laws and local nature reserve rules.\" Li, a GE East Asia Climate and Energy Campaigner, talks about how bad the situation is: \"CH city's need for coal is not only making the air very dirty in the country's biggest cities, it's also using up a lot of water, making some regions face water shortages and turning into deserts.\"\n\nThe damage from digging in TI place is causing real problems for many people living there. Besides moving people away from their homes, those who stay in the digging regions have to deal with many Earth problems. A person from TI place talks about how digging, and the new workers, are hurting their land and resources:\n\nThe workers take water through metal pipes from the top of the mountain, and local people have been facing water shortage since they came. For generations, people have been living near the big river and both people and animals drink the water of that river, but now many new people are putting their dirty water into the river, as well as all the bad water from the gold processing plant. (quoted in La 2013: 64\u201365)\n\nHaving clean water is very important for many villages near the mines, for their own use and for animals. The heavy use of water in digging operations is making these resources less and less and is another reason for the ending of the farmer way of life in TI place.\n\nOne last point about the digging activities in TI place combines the Earth and spiritual health of people on the Plateau. They think much of the Earth, including mountains and rivers, is sacred. When mountains are exploded for digging, or rivers dammed to make electricity, people feel a sense of deep spiritual loss. One person interviewed by TW describes the issue as follows: \"Breaking the land, the digging of sacred mountains and holy lakes, are more than pollution and breaking of the Earth. It is a breaking of our tradition, religious beliefs and the breaking of our forefathers' legacy\" (FT n.d.).\n\nLong, long ago, even before people started to learn about kindness and peace, the people in TI land believed in many gods in nature. Historian Samuel shares this:\n\nSometimes, people say that the world is ruled by three types of spirit: the gods in the sky, the spirits in the air and on top of mountains, and the water spirits in the ground and rivers. The mountain gods were very special, with each family having its own mountain and the family leaders thinking they were children of the mountain god.\n\nIn his book about digging in TI land, Gabriel talks about how important the mountains, and other beautiful things in nature, are to the people in TI land. He shares stories by people from TI land in his book, which tell about the hurt and sadness caused to the people by the big changes made by the CH country in their land. Here is a story by a person from TI land about the damage in a place where people dig for gold and copper in the mountains:\n\nAt the bottom of the mountain is a special place where about a hundred men live, learning about peace and kindness. People say that inside the mountain there is a golden big animal and a white bird, and these are the gods of this area, especially of the special place... When the digging started, the special place was hit by falling rocks, and got broken... There are three villages nearby... where people only have animals to live on; the fields where their animals live got filled with rocks when the government started digging. Not only that, but they had to move somewhere else. Also, with all the big machines and loud noises, the animals nearby got sick and some died.\n\nThis story tells about the hurt to the land and the way of life in TI land. A news report talks about another place where people dig, which has made the local people unhappy: \"The digging place, in a valley known to the people of TI land as a special place and loved as the birthplace of a king, has been the focus of protests by locals who are upset about the damage to nature and other problems.\" Another news report quotes a nature lover in TI land, who didn't tell his name because he was afraid of the CH government: \"God is in the mountains and the rivers, these are the places that spirits live. When digging comes and the grassland is dug up, people believe worse disasters will come. It destroys the mountain god.\" This nature lover also said that people in TI land \"would oppose digging projects even if the companies promised to share profits with local communities, to fix the digging places after they were finished, and to make the places look natural again.\" This part is very important to talk about when we think about people losing their lands for this project: taking away and using up things is so bad for the people of TI place that it's hard to think about any kind of mining that would be okay. Yes, taking away things is happening, but the special love for the land in this situation makes it even worse. Instead of just talking about hurting the environment and moving people as problems, our thinking from studying about people taking over lands makes us look deeper into what it means for the people of TI place to be taken away from their lands. It's like taking away their culture: taking the people of TI place away from their land, and making it harder for them to stay as a unique group of people.\n\nStaying Strong\n\nIt's important to say that the people of TI place, even though they don't have a lot of rights, have always stayed strong against these things, even when it was very dangerous for them. Even though it's often hard to get clear and true stories of the people of TI place staying strong, there is a lot of proof that they have always fought against hurting their environment, their way of making a living, and their way of life. Groups like Watch Group, Free Group, Global Care Group, Rights Watch Group, Help Group, and Free Radio, along with reporters and people studying from outside of TI place, have all talked about how strong and determined the people of TI place are to stand up against the big CN power. The Global Care Group (in the past) says:\n\nPeople standing up against mining and to take care of TI place's special high-up environment have become more and more, and dangerous, as the CN powers speed up big mining in copper, gold, silver, and other things. People of TI place who even just worry a little about the impact of bad waste, cutting down trees, and big erosion risk are being put in jail, hurt, or killed.\n\nStaying strong has been shown in calm talks to the CN local powers, peaceful protests, meetings of worried people of TI place, and in very desperate cases, hurting themselves. One report from Free Radio talks about a situation where \"Thomas, a dad of two, hurt himself outside a gold mine in AM town in GS's SA county one morning in the past.\" These shocking cases of people hurting themselves should make the outside world wake up about how serious and desperate the situation of the people of TI place under CN rule is, but also about their will to stay strong. In general, the people of TI place have not been quiet victims, nor have they agreed to CN rule. Also, they have spoken out loudly against the environmental, spiritual, economic, and political problems of the CN occupation, which the train plays a big part in making stronger.\n\nCANADIAN ACTIVITY, BIG COMPANY'S ROLE, AND WHAT THIS MEANS\n\nFirst, we must say that the big company is not the only one from CA country with interests in TI place. Two other companies \u2014 PowerCo and NorthCo \u2014 were helping build the TI place train line. PowerCo worked with the big company in making the train cars, and NorthCo gave \"the line a way to talk without wires\" (CA TI Group n.d.). Also, some other companies in CA country have been working in the digging or dam-building parts of CH country's plan in TI place (Buckley n.d.). So, it is important to see this case with the bigger picture and things mentioned in the first chapter about CA country's companies working in other places. While the big company has had a big role as the maker of the train cars, and the railroad has been an important part of CH country's control in TI place, it is one of many CA country companies getting benefits from CH country's control of TI place.\n\nA group of CA country organizations, including the CA TI Group, International Help for TI, and Students for a Free TI, asked the big company to stop the project in the early years. These groups also made protests against the big company, including at the company's big yearly meeting in the sixth month of 2005. Lily, leader of Students for a Free TI, said at the time: \"To people in TI place, the railway is a very bad thing... The CH government already wants CH settlers to move into TI place to make TI people more like CH people and stop their fight against CH rule\" (International Help for TI 2005). Mary, leader of the International Help for TI, added: \"The big company does not care that TI people have not been asked about if they even want the railroad to be built. No matter what happens to TI people or lands, they have said there is 'no way' they will stop\" (International Help for TI 2005). Finally, Tom, leader of the CA TI Group, said:\n\nAs a TI person and a Q person, I'm sad that the big company is helping the CH government build the railway... I support making TI place better, but not if it is forced by Beijing and mostly helps the interests of the CH Party, rather than most of the TI people. (International Help for TI 2005)\n\nThis last point is very important, as many of the people against the train line, both in and outside TI place, are upset because TI people were not really asked about the project and that the good things are seen to mostly go to the CH state, not to TI people. Many TI people support some parts of \"modern things\" and \"making things better,\" but say that all of these things are happening without their control and not for their good. Doctor Liam (2017), a leader of a big group, says:\n\nWe are not against building new things in TI land, but we think that the real helpers of any building must be the people living in TI land. Any projects that CH country does must be good for nature, careful with culture and help the local people.\n\nThis idea was said by the Dalai Lama earlier in this story when he said that the train line, by itself, could be good for the people. The big problem is that the people don't have any control or say about the planning and doing of \"building\" activities in their land and that the good things from these activities are not shared enough with the people. And when the people try to talk about these worries with the CH country through acts of saying no, they are often told they are doing wrong and punished more.\n\nThe official answers from BO company to these worries say that the company does not get involved in big group issues, but rather focuses on doing business only. Former big boss Laurent told people at the 2005 big meeting: \"We don't think it's our job to solve the big group problems between CH country and TI land\" (Yakabuski 2005). In another talk, Jianwei, boss and chief country representative of BO company in CH country, said: \"The railway is not our job... We're just making the cars. BO's job is to make sure of our long-time work with CH country\" (York 2006). Saying no to any big group involvement in the host countries is a thing said again in the IS city/PA city case as well. Yet the train line into TI land is a big group project, with many big group effects. During the building time of the railway, former president Zemin said this in a simple way: \"Some people told me not to do this project because it is not good for business. I said, this is a big group decision, we will make this project work at all costs, even if there is a loss for business\" (NE Times 2001). The goals of making CH country's rule in the west parts of the country strong and getting more natural things in TI land are big group goals. Even though these big group processes were not started or planned by BO, the company is still getting money from, and helping, the finishing of this important project.\n\nThis brings us back to the main theme of the story \u2014 taking away \u2014 and how it is shown in the CH/TI case. As has been explained, there are certainly parts in the case that connect with the big group economy idea of getting more by taking away. The forced moving of people in TI land to make room for digging and damming projects shows a form of getting for the CH state and private companies that relies on the taking away from the people. In addition, the using of TI spiritual and cultural life for the purposes of making TI an attractive place for visitors also fits to the general shape of a getting more by taking away. In this story, the Tibetan people are losing control over their own special places so that many tourists can visit. \n\nBut just talking about the money and power is not enough to explain everything. So, we can use ideas from other studies to understand better what is happening in Tibet today. Mr. C (2014: 6\u201315) talks about how important land is when people are taken away from their homes. When people come to take over the land, they don't always need the people who lived there before to work for them. Mr. W (2006: 388) says, \"the new people come to stay: they don't just visit.\" The CH country government wants to use and control Tibetan land for two main reasons. First, they want to show their power and control the people in Tibet. Second, they want to build big factories, mines, and dams in Tibet. These things need a lot of land, and sometimes the people who lived there need to leave. The mines and dams are often built and worked by people from outside Tibet. And many of the places for tourists in cities like LA city are owned by Han CH country people. Even if these workers don't want to live in Tibet forever, other parts of taking over the land are helped by this way of thinking. These things show a special way of taking over that we need to understand better.\n\nThe way the land is being taken over is shown very clearly when we think more about how it affects the Tibetan people and how they respond. The Tibetan people love and respect the land they have lived on for many, many years. Their feelings about the land affect how they feel about the CH country taking over and using the land. They see the mining of mountains and blocking of rivers as a big attack on their way of life and who they are. So, they resist because they love the land and don't like how it's being used and taken. They try to stop or protest against the mining activities and the taking away of their land. In other words, the Tibetan people are not just fighting against the CH country because their things and work are being used, but also because they are losing control over their land, which is very important to their life and existence. Finally, in this situation, a company has chosen to work very closely with the CH country government and make a lot of money in this difficult and contested place. \"CH company has a big chance to do well in the future in CN country,\" (Kevin 2013). But, not paying attention to the problems that can come from big building projects means that CH company might be getting good things from bad actions. It's not good that the company doesn't seem to care about working with a bossy country. This should make people in CA country worried. \n\nNOTES\n\n1. Gabriel is a very famous person who knows a lot about TI place, and Gabriel (1991) gives readers a detailed history of TI place's wish for freedom from 1913 to 1951, and its relationship with the CN country. His later work (2007, 2014) finished a famous group of books on TI-CN history in the late 20th century.\n\n2. For a very good story about Jack, the boss of CH company in CN country, and how he did well in the CN market for CH company in the past years, see Kevin (2013).\n\n3. For more details on the lack of rights in TI place, see the yearly books on TI place by Freedom House. The short version of their 2017 report says: \"The CN government kept using very strict public watching and control actions in 2016 as part of a big increase of its 'keeping peace' policies in TI place... People saw a lot of breaks of basic rights, including a worrying number of people being caught, tried, and found guilty in TI place for peacefully using their freedom of speech, meeting, and religion.\" Freedom House gave TI place a score of 1 out of 100, with 0 being the lowest level of rights.\n\n4.

CH company is one of the big companies involved with the planning, building, and running of the G-train, which was finished and working in 2011. A big and costly project in the \"new\" AF country, the G-train has received different criticisms from scholars and activists in AF country. Activists say, a big project is mainly for a special group of people in the area. Even though many people need better ways to travel, this project is using a lot of money. Ryan (2006: 344) even thinks that the project might be making it harder for some people to move around, which the new government was supposed to help with. David's idea about how private companies make money from big projects is useful in understanding how this big project in SA country is working. Public funds, or money that belongs to everyone, are being used to help the companies involved with the project make more money.\n\nHISTORY\n\nA long time ago, people from other countries came to SA country. They took things from the people who lived there and built systems to help them take more things like natural resources. A big example of this was when the BR country made a law in 1913 that said the black population could only live on about 13 percent of the land, even though they were about 80 percent of the people (SA History Online 2013). The BR country government at that time wanted to keep the power for the white people and keep the races separate. This included taking most of the land, keeping non-white citizens from being involved in political life, and using the work of Black people to make money. They did this by forcing Black people to work for the white population.\n\nThe year 1948 was the start of a time in SA history called apartheid. After winning an election in 1948, the National Party made many laws to keep the races separate. This included a law in 1950 to put everyone in a racial group (Davenport and Saunders 2000: 378), a law against marriages between whites and other races, and other laws to keep the races separate and keep non-whites from being involved in the politics of the state. Apartheid was a system that kept the economic control over Black people and put more restrictions on their lives. People in SA country strongly resisted apartheid. For example, Nelson spent almost thirty years in prison for organizing against the system. A group of people came together to fight against apartheid, which included the ANC, the SACP, and the COSATU. A long time ago, there were people from different countries who were not nice and made bad rules. They did not like people with different skin colors and treated them badly. This was a big problem, and people everywhere started to say that it was not good. They did not want to play with them or give them things.\n\nBy the end of the 20th century, the people who made the bad rules had to let go of some good people they had put in jail. They also had to let other people talk about why the rules were bad. They started to talk about how to stop the bad rules. In the middle of the 20th century, they had a big vote and the good people won. This was the end of the bad rules.\n\nBut the bad rules had been there for a long time and they still affected how people lived. For example, buses and trains were important because they helped people go to work or school. But the buses and trains were not good for people with different skin colors. The cities were made to help people with the same skin color have good jobs, schools, and places to have fun, but people with different skin colors had to live far away in places called townships. These places did not have good schools, hospitals, or shops, and it was hard to get to them by bus or train.\n\nAlso, people with different skin colors were not allowed to go to the nice places in the city where people with the same skin color lived. This made it hard for them to have good jobs or go to good schools. A man named Matthew said that the buses and trains were only good for taking people to work, but they were not good for other things like going to school or the hospital. This was a big problem and people did not like it. They said it was not fair and they wanted to change it. Many people wrote about this and tried to help make things better.\n\nEven today, the bad rules from the past still affect how people live. It is important to remember this and try to make things better. Long ago, there was a very bad law that made people live apart in our cities. Even though this law was stopped in the early 90s, our cities still show signs of it. This is important to understand when we talk about a big train project that a company named Bombardier is working on. A smart man named Ronnie explained:\n\nOne of the biggest problems we have in our cities is that things are not fair and it's hard to get places because of this old law. A report from the early 90s said our cities were not very good at all. Our cities were (and still are) spread out, broken up, and separated, all of this made things not work very well and people were treated differently because of their color. For many years, black people were pushed aside when it came to where they could live, play, work, and travel. The way cities were built made people have to travel far to work.\n\nThis made our cities have two parts: a rich part where people use cars and a poor part where people walk, ride bikes, take minibuses, buses, taxis, trains, and sometimes cars or trucks.\n\nYears of a small group of white people being in charge and the city growing around mining made this separation in our city. The city and the areas around it are a mix of black neighborhoods and mostly white suburbs, some of which have gates around them. While rich (and mostly white) people can drive fast on highways, a black person living in a place like Soweto might need to use many different ways to travel, taking a lot of time and money, to get to work. When I lived in a suburb near the city center, the woman who worked in the house where I lived told me her trip to work took 1.5\u20132 hours and she had to use many ways to get there.\n\nThis separation comes from the bad thinking of white people who came here a long time ago, and it worked with a very unfair way of making money. These big problems about class and race still make our cities look the way they do after the bad law was stopped. Bombardier works in many countries, but because of the bad law, SO city is a special case for planning public transportation. People are still separated by class and race in a special way in our cities, and the city makes it hard for everyone to get places, so the government has to fix problems of people not being able to get to places equally. But, as this case shows, Bombardier has chosen to work on a project that will probably make things worse, not better, for people being left out in the province.\n\nThe challenge after the bad law was stopped was to change these parts of the city that leave people out and provide a fair and working system of public transportation. In 1992, people started talking about how to make traveling better for everyone in the FR country. This was the first time many important people talked about this together. In 1994, they made a plan called the Big Change Plan (BCP) that talked about what the new government wanted to do for the people.\n\nIt said:\n\nWomen, children, and people who can't walk or see well need to travel safely and not spend too much money. There should be buses and trains when it's not busy, and safe ways to travel late at night or in far places. They might think about giving more help to students, old people, and others who don't have a lot of money.\n\nPeople thought that being able to travel was a very important thing for everyone, like going to the doctor or school. They knew that not being able to get around was a big problem for the people. They wanted everyone to be able to get to where they needed to go safely and easily. But they didn't have a full plan for how to make traveling better when they had the first big vote in 1994. Even though they knew it was a big problem, they didn't make a plan until after 1994.\n\nIn 1996, they started to talk about traveling in a different way. They wrote a White Paper on Travel Policy. This was around the same time that the government changed the way they thought about the economy. They stopped using the BCP and started using a new plan called GEAR (Growth, Employment and Reconstruction). The BCP was a plan that a lot of different people agreed with. It said that the government should work hard to fix the problems caused by the bad old rules. GEAR, on the other hand, was about making businesses private, letting businesses do what they want, and letting people buy and sell freely. This change happened when the FR country became a democracy. Some people said this change was a \"short walk to the normal way\" or a \"big agreement\". At the same time, they also changed how they thought about traveling. They said that all kinds of travel should be run like a business, not like a service for the public. Instead of thinking that everyone should be able to travel, they thought that the people who could pay should travel. If the cost of a project could be paid back by the people using it, then it should be done.\n\nThis new way of thinking about travel also made it easier for different companies to compete for jobs. This meant that old companies that helped people move from one place to another, with workers who were part of a group and had good work conditions, would have to start working against companies that cost less. Jessica (in a book from a time long ago) talks about this change to a way of working where the best price wins: \"In the future, all companies would have to compete for their work. This would let new companies and companies from other places have a chance.\" When we think about bus services, Benjamin (from a book from an even longer time ago) says: \"The government's new system... is making people lose jobs and making work conditions worse for bus workers.\" Moving people and things from one place to another was not safe from the big changes happening at that time.\n\nThere were still some ideas that cared about the people, like talking about basic needs. But a big part of the plan was about making competition in the moving people and things sector and making the government less involved in making and running buildings and services. This can also be seen as letting the moving people and things sector be a place where private money can grow. As the case of the big train shows, letting private companies be part of planning, running, and building public buildings can result in money for the private companies in ways that take away from many people.\n\nIn a time not too long ago, the government made a paper called Moving SA: Toward a Plan for 2020, the purpose of which was to give more details about the ideas in the big plan and to make a real policy for the next many years (Jessica 2012). The main idea of the paper is described by Kevin (2001: 9):\n\nThe idea in the MSA is strong, but what makes it different from the old plan and the big plan on National Moving People and Things Policy is its clear use of the new language and its promise to make users pay. All through the MSA report is the changing of words, such as, \"passengers\" with \"customers\" and \"clients,\" in a clear market way of looking at moving people in SA.\n\nTwo years later, in 2000, the main government made the National Land Moving People and Things Act. This tried to clearly say what each level of government had to do in helping people move, support the making of moving people and things authorities, and make clear rules for competing. The Act also said a dream for making safe, cheap, and good land moving across the country.\n\nThe best proof about the failure of the new government to change public moving buildings during the first ten years of being free is in the Department of Moving People and Things's National House Travel Survey, done in 2003 and published in 2004. This survey is the first, and only, big national survey of SA people dealing with the subject of public moving. It gives a lot of information about how people live with the moving system and tells a sad story about big moving challenges. The story says that most people in SA country were not happy with the buses and trains. They said the buses and trains were too far from home, too costly, unsafe, or did not go where they needed to go. According to a summary by Benjamin, \"24% said the buses and trains are not there or too far, 19% said it was not safe, and 19% said it was too costly.\" About the cost, around one-third (32 percent) of families spent more than 10 percent of their money on buses and trains, which was too high. And 19 percent spent more than 20 percent of their money on buses and trains. Ten years after a big change, people still needed safe, affordable, and easy to use buses and trains. And it was at this time that the project in this story \u2014 the GA project \u2014 was started.\n\nThe SA government has not done a good job on this important part of planning. A teacher named Katherine says: \"In general, the government has not done well in helping people with low income who need to travel, who are most of the people living in the cities in SA.\" The Congress of SA Workers (CO 2014) agrees with this: \"Most people do not have access to reliable, affordable and safe transport.\" While some new projects do seem to help with the transport needs of most people in SA, the government has not done well overall. Furthermore, the GA project shows many of the problems with planning for buses and trains after the big change. We see money being used for big projects like the GA project, making companies like BO richer, while at the same time taking away the money needed to fix the basic needs for buses and trains for most people.\n\nABOUT THE GA PROJECT\n\nGA place in SA country is the place where most of the business and money making happens in the country, making up 35 percent of SA's money and 10 percent of the total money of the African continent (MO 2014). As the place with the most people in SA, GA place makes \"about 40.3% of the things made, 33% of electricity and gas production and water output, 43,8% of the building and 35.2% of the selling and buying in SA\" (MO 2014). However, the buses and trains have not kept up with the growing economy and population in the place. Big problems exist for people across the place (and the country) about how easy it is to use, how costly, and how safe the buses and trains are. The big city in SA country has a lot of money and is growing fast, but not everyone is getting a fair share. Many people are poor, do not have jobs, and do not have enough to eat. This is a big problem for the city and for the whole of SA country.\n\nIn the year 2000, Matthew, who was a leader in the city, said that they would build the first fast city transport in Africa. This idea came after Thomas, the person who was the leader before Matthew, went to GE country in 1997 with Jack to learn about fast trains. After studying the idea, Matthew decided to go ahead with the plan. They finished studying the plan by 2001 and started to look for people who could do the work in 2002. The city leaders decided to work with private companies to build and run the train. This way, the city still owns the train, but the private companies make it and run it.\n\nAfter asking many companies, the city leaders chose to work with a big company that is made up of six smaller companies. Four of these companies are from SA country, and two are from other places. These two companies from other places own half of the big company, and the companies from SA country own the other half. Bombela's job in the team \"include making, building, helping to pay for, running, and taking care of the system,\" and the agreement lasts over a \"long time of building and development followed by many years of running and taking care of the system\" (Bombela Team 2011).\n\nThe goal is to connect TS city, JO city, and the big airport, the Fast Train Project is a \"top-quality public transport system\" that travels very fast (Fast Train Team n.d.a). It has ten stops over a long distance, a small area of SO country, and hopes to get car riders between JO city and TS city to take the train instead. This project may work with proposed road tolls in GA place by Sanral (SO Country Roads Team Ltd), which sees tolls as a reason for car users to switch to riding the Fast Train. The train project also targets airport passengers. The Fast Train Team (n.d.b) expects a lot of passengers per day, and the fares \"will be cheaper than the cost of using a car.\" Keeping in mind the city layout explained earlier, the train's route mainly connects the rich areas of JO city and TS city to the city centers and the airport outside of JO city. It does not connect to any of the surrounding towns. As such, the train is made to service a professional group of people in the province, and thus keeps and reproduces the places of exclusion and separation that were set under old times.\n\nThe GA government gives multiple reasons for the project: to lessen heavy traffic between TS city and JO city; to boost economic growth by directly creating jobs related to the project, and also wider growth through visitors; and to develop a more nature-friendly way of transport for the region (Fast Train Team n.d.c). The first part of the train was finished in time to help travel during the Big Game in July 2010, while most of the remaining parts, which were delayed due to water getting into the tunnel, were opened on a day in 2011.\n\nPOSSIBLE GOOD THINGS ABOUT THE PROJECT\n\nOne of the main goals of the Fast Train is to lessen road traffic on the N1 Big Road between JO city and TS city. This is one of the most crowded roads in the country, and the long drive can take one to two hours during the busiest times of the week. The GA government says: \"Traffic on the N1 Road is currently thought to cost a lot of money per year, including lost work time during travel, higher transport costs and more accidents. Also, too much traffic makes life hard. If the train gets 120,000 riders a day, and about 20 percent of drivers start using the train, this will help with the traffic problems. But, more and more cars are coming each year, so there will still be more cars after the train is done than before it was built. But, things would be much worse without the train. So, if a lot of people use the train, it will help with the traffic problems on this busy road.\n\nWhen making the final deals with the BO group, the province made sure that the train project would help the community. This meant that the partners in the project had to promise to create local jobs, help Black people, and hire people who usually don't get jobs. Different people say different things about how many jobs the project made, but the BO group thinks it made about 92,900 jobs by the end of May 2009. The big boss of the province announced in March 2009 that about 11,700 jobs were made. Most of these jobs were only for the time of building, and about 2,700 jobs will be needed to run the train after it's done. In addition, in 2009 the BO group said they did more than they promised for the train project, including:\n\n\u2022 10,310 local people got jobs, when they only had to hire 5,046.\n\n\u2022 9,345 people who usually don't get jobs got jobs, when they only had to hire 3,851.\n\n\u2022 593 women got jobs, when they only had to hire 298.\n\n\u2022 52 people with disabilities got jobs, when they only had to hire 47.\n\n\u2022 Workers who didn't know much got to go to more than 11,390 classes to learn more.\n\n\u2022 The BO group promised to train women, and they started in February 2007. By April 2009, 90 women had been in this program.\n\nThe BO member was in charge of this last task about training women. The company trained women and helped them, which resulted in 121 women finishing training by the end of 2010. These women were picked through a fair process and learned a lot about business and technical things. For example, Katherine (2011) learned about managing people and then worked for the company as a people manager. Kevin (2011) finished classes about how to make things work with electricity, and then he started working at a big company. Both Kevin and Katherine said that learning at the big company changed their lives. Katherine said: \"It changed our lives... and gave a lot of us a chance, a really good chance.\" Even if not all the people who learn there will work at the big company after they finish learning, it will still help them find other jobs. Kevin (2011) said, \"Even the people who leave the company [because most jobs are temporary], the name of the big company opens big doors for them.\"\n\nThe big company also taught people how to put together big train cars. These train cars were made at a big factory in the UK city. Seventeen workers from the big company in SA country were sent to UK city to learn how to put together the first fifteen train cars. The rest of the cars were then put together at a factory in SA country. At the factory in SA country, the big company \"asked a group of about ten experts from the UK city to work with South Africans... to make sure that the things they make are as good as the ones in the UK city\" (Train Management Group 2008). This made sure that a lot of the big train cars were put together in SA country and that the workers in SA country learned new skills. But, it's also important to say that most of the pieces needed to put the trains together are made in the UK city and can't be replaced by companies in SA country. If they need new pieces, they will have to bring them from other countries.2\n\nAnother goal of the project is to make the economy in the province of GA place better. The people who looked at how the train would affect the environment (EIA) in 2002 said that the train would help the economy. They said: \"The fast train project will help the economy of GA place by about one per cent\" (Environment Company 2002a: 17). This is based on the jobs that will be created, the money that will be invested, and how having better transportation will help the economy. We will need more information in the future to see if this is true, but building the project definitely created a lot of needed jobs. There might also be more houses and offices built around the train stations. A person who studies money, Chris, thinks that \"the train's 10 stations will be places where a lot of development happens and will change how cities are built and designed\" (in Person 2011a). Hart talks about the \"important train\" as a \"big helper for people to make money\" in the province. He thinks that lots of business activity will grow around each station. Even though this business activity may not help with the big problem of some people having much more money than others in Gauteng, it does give the chance for growth and more opportunities along this special train route.\n\nAt the end, we have to think about how the \"important train\" can affect the environment, especially when the people in charge of the \"important train\" say that \"it is better for the environment than other ways of moving around\" (Train Management n.d.c). The big study from 2002 about how this project will affect the environment looked at how it might change the plants, open spaces, water on the ground, water under the ground, and animals. The study says: \"Because the 'important train' route goes through a city area, most of the changes are about how people live. There are not many changes to the natural world\" (Environment Group Ltd. 2002a: 25). So, the project is not really bad or good for the environment. The idea that thousands of people who drive cars might start using the train could mean less bad air from cars, and less dirty air in the province. In fact, the Train Management group (n.d.e) says this:\n\nPublic transport makes 95% less bad air, 90% less bad chemicals and about half as much bad air and bad gas per passenger-km as private cars. Because of this, the 'important train' will make the air much cleaner because it is expected that the 'important train' will make about 70 tons less bad air.\n\nBut, this study does not think about the more bad air that power stations make when they give electricity to run the 'important train'. This is important to think about in SO city, because most electricity comes from coal power plants. What the EIA says about the debate on bad air is surprising. After looking carefully at the data on bad air, the EIA says:\n\nThere is no change in the total amount of bad air when we compare the more bad air (from the power station) and less bad air (from fewer cars). If we only look at bad air, this suggests that the 'important train' will not change the amount of bad air. (Environment Group Ltd. 2002b: 40)\n\nIn fact, less bad air in the busy area between Johannesburg and Tshwane/Pretoria will be balanced by more bad air from coal power plants in other provinces, like the nearby Mpumalanga. Even though the air will be cleaner in Gauteng, this bad air will just move to other parts of the country.\n\nWe should also remember that building the 'important train' is part of the SO country government's bigger plan of making big projects to help with big events. Since 1994, SO city has hosted several big international events, like the 1995 Rugby World Cup, the 2002 World Meeting on Taking Care of the Environment, the 2003 Cricket World Cup, and the 2010 Football World Cup. People think big events can make the place they are held better. This is because they believe these events will bring more money to the place. To hold these events, a good place is needed. This is all I will say about this, but some people have talked about whether it is a good idea to hold big events in SO city. They say building a big train is part of making the place better.\n\nThere might be problems with the big train\n\nPeople have said there might be problems with the big train. The problems are connected: it might make it harder for some people to move around; it might use money that could have been used for poor people; the cost for the train has gone up a lot; and other ways to help people move around were not thought about enough. Each problem helps us understand why some people get more and others get less. The cost going up shows that some companies are getting more than they said they would. Understanding why some people can't move around and the problems with city things in the place helps us see why some people are getting less. Looking at this case also shows the special parts of planning and building, and how some people get more by others getting less.\n\nFirst, it is important to remember that the big train is mostly for people who have cars now. The big train boss, Jack, says, \"Our focus is on the car user... if you have enough money for a car, you have enough money for the big train\". The big train goes through areas where \"professional\" people live. It was made to help an important group of people who live in different places from the poor majority. A group from the country's government was worried about this in 2005 and said the project should not go ahead: \"The cost of tickets, where most of the stations are... these and other things have all been chosen to give a rich part of the community a first-world way to get around\". While it makes sense to build safe and good ways for rich people to get around, there is a risk that there will be two levels of ways to get around that keep the old patterns of leaving people out and separating them.\n\nCritics say that spending a lot of public money on this project might not do much to help the separate areas in cities. In simple words, some people might not be able to go places because of the new train. This means that some people cannot join in the everyday life of the community because they can't go to the places they need to because of the new train. The new train might make this problem worse when the government should be trying to fix it. The Transport Group says: \"The rail-line is far from most of the big towns, and there hasn't been much thought about making sure it connects with the other ways of transport used by town people\" (2005: 4). The train does not go into any of the towns and mostly goes to the rich areas of JO city and PR city. Patrick, a speaker for the SO country Work Union (SAWU), says this:\n\nThe train will actually, if anything, make it worse because it will go to what were previously all white areas, where still only a few black people probably live... And it is precisely the former black areas that are still so badly served by the existing transport system. (2011)\n\nAlso, a lot of money is being spent on the new train project at a time when the public transport for poor people is getting worse. The National Transport survey shows that the lack of safe, accessible, and good public transport is a big problem for people living in GA place. Given the history and the city shapes created by these processes, it is important to ask whether the new train works to make the problem worse or better within the area. If the project tends to make the problem worse, as seems to be the case with the new train, we can see this as a process of taking away from the majority population. A lot of public money is being used to make the problem worse, while private companies like Bombardier make the profits.\n\nConnected with asking about the overall impact of the new train on the city shape of the area, scholars and civil society actors within SO city have criticized the use of public money for a rich class of citizens. Despite the big and pressing need for more safe and efficient transport for the majority of South Africans \u2014 who are living in poverty \u2014 the new train caters to the wealthy few. In fact, the SO country National Land Transport Transition Act of 2000 stated clearly: \"Public transport services are planned where possible so that subsidies are aimed to assist currently marginalised users and those who have poor access to social and economic activity\" (Republic of SO city 2000: 11\u201312). Madeleine (2015: 1211) points out that, from a rights-based point of view, \"it is against the SO country Constitution, which guarantees all citizens equal rights and privileges to access socio-economic opportunities.\" Both the Act and the Constitution were made to protect against the type of taking away inherent in projects like the new train. In a year long ago, when SA country's strong worker group threatened to stop working because of the planned big train, the question of what's most important was a big issue. A worker group statement at that time said, \"The big train does not solve the biggest transportation problems in GA place.\" The worker group clearly pointed out the main problem with moving people around in the province: there was no good system to take people from small towns to big cities. Jessica, a former research officer at the SA transport workers' union, also emphasized the issue of what's most important to spend money on: \"The transport workers' union has always been against spending so much money on the big train when the rest of the transportation system is not getting enough money.\" The worker group also said: \"The big train takes away limited money that could have been used for projects aimed at getting rid of poverty.\" Scholars like Ryan also share the concerns of the worker group and argue that using so much public money for the big train ignores the more urgent needs of the poor.\n\nTransportation expert Dr. Victor points out the problems related to spending money on the big train in the SA country context:\n\nNo country has two layers of train systems \u2014 one for rich people and another for the \"poor people.\" Most train systems just have different levels of comfort in the same train. In fact, most city train systems worldwide do not even have different levels. SA country cannot afford to build new \"fancy\" train systems while its existing train systems have many unresolved problems. (These include lack of investment, lack of working together with other types of transport, unreliable services, not safe, etc.) These problems need to be solved first.\n\nPeople and transport scholars in the country have consistently raised this concern about government spending priorities. This was especially clear in the yearly budget in GA place, where money for building things was cut from a big number to a smaller number \u2014 a fact that a person from the GA finance department, Jack, admitted was because of spending on the big train. In other words, the provincial government is giving up other areas of building things to fund the big train. This adds to our understanding of the concept of taking away by force. In addition to the lost chance of spending limited resources to fix, rather than make worse, problems with moving people around, this project ensures that longer-term exclusion will continue in the province. This is a kind of taking away by force that is perhaps only found in cases of public transportation system development where situations like those described by Victor exist. And once again, along with taking away by force, is the aspect of gathering by the private sector partners.\n\nThe first thought was that it would cost a lot of money to build the GA train, about the same as a billion dollars. They used this amount of money to decide if it was a good idea to build the train. But, the total money they needed ended up being much more. It's interesting to compare this to other money spent on public travel and who this will help. Keep in mind that this very expensive project will only help about 60,000-70,000 people. In 2005, they set aside money for old and broken train tracks, which are used by about 7 million people. The group that decides on transportation things argues that\n\nthe very big amount of public money for the GA train project and the small number of people it will help needs to be thought about seriously compared to our public travel system which is in a very bad state, with many people not happy. (2)\n\nIn other words, the group was not sure that the good things from the project were equal to the cost, especially thinking about other more important travel needs for more people. Indeed, the number of people using the train since it started makes us question the benefits of the train, especially when compared to the guesses used to justify it. The GA train group (n.d.b) at first guessed that the train would carry 100,000 passengers per day, going up to 120,000. But the number of people per day in 2013 and 2014 was between 40,000 and 52,000 passengers (Van der Westhuizen 2017: 546). One person (Louw 2014) summed up the problem of spending this money on the GA train: \"No sooner had the transportation group looked at the evidence and advised against the GA train than the government went ahead with it, which means it took a lot of money from the poor, who never use the GA train, to the rich, who love it.\"\n\nThe increasing costs to the public for transportation projects is not a problem only for the SA case or new thing. Scholars Benjamin, Matthew and Samuel (2002) did a detailed study of the actual and estimated costs of 258 transportation projects all over the world, which was the first important study of its kind. They found that costs were underestimated in nine out of ten cases and that rail projects were especially problematic in this regard. Moreover, the authors conclude: \"Cost underestimation cannot be explained by error and seems to be best explained by strategic misrepresentation\" (290). While BA cannot be blamed for the GA government's underestimation, or perhaps misrepresentation, of the costs, it certainly works to BA's advantage that the project proceeds despite the increasing cost estimates. This adds to what Benjamin (2017: 12) describes as \"the 'iron law of big projects:' Over budget, over time, under benefits, over and over again.\" Also, Mr. F talks about something he calls the \"big project problem\":\n\nOn one hand, big projects for public and private things are very popular, and there are more and bigger projects than ever before. On the other hand, doing these big projects often doesn't go well and hasn't gotten better for a very long time, when we look at things like cost going over the plan, delays, and not getting the benefits expected. (12)\n\nEven though we can't say for sure that there was a plan to trick people about the total costs of the big train project, we can't just ignore what Mr. F found in his research. The big difference between the planned and actual costs of the big train project shows at least bad planning and at most a plan to underestimate the costs to get the project approved.\n\nThe province could afford the first plan of 7 billion, but as the costs grew, the province had to ask the national government in 2005 for more money to finish the project. It was then that the National Cabinet said yes to the project, even though the Transport Committee said not to. One of the big reasons why the National Cabinet said yes to more money for the big train project was that it was already in the middle of planning and building. By then it was almost impossible to stop the project, with big train project leader Jack arguing that stopping would send a bad message to people who might invest money and risk making the country look bad before the big soccer event in 2010. This case seems to match what Mr. F found about the big project problem, and that underestimating cost could keep being a big problem for future big projects like this.\n\nThe last worry related to growing costs on the project involves the province's debt payments for building the train and the chance of ongoing and expensive public money to run the big train. First, \"the province owes the national government about 4.2 billion and a bank nearly 1 billion; these loans are to be paid back over several years\" (Flanagan 2012). Even though we don't know the details of the contract between the province government and the private companies, reports of a \"patronage guarantee\" given to the private companies by the province have come up. This seems to be a normal part of public-private partnerships to cover some of the risk for the private investments (see Dlamini 2011b). For the 2011\u201312 fiscal year, the province Department of Roads and Transport included 259 million to cover \"patronage guarantee\" costs (see Flanagan 2011). According to the big train Management Agency's 2015\u201316 annual report, the patronage guarantee for the financial year was 1.190 billion (2016: 37). In the beginning, the national government didn't know everything about the partnership plan. Deputy Minister of Transport, Jack, knew there was a promise, but no exact numbers were talked about. He says: \"We were never told how much they were promising... We asked that question a lot\" (in Flanagan 2011). This is related to the idea of Harvey's theory. No matter how many people use the service or how \"successful\" the project is, Bombardier and the other companies are promised to make money, even if it means getting money directly from the SO country state. Bombardier makes money while the result for most South Africans in the region is not having enough.\n\nThe help is not there to cover less than expected users but to make sure a minimum money level for the Bombela Group. Commenting on the deal between the public and private partners, Dr. Jack Middleton of the World Bank says: \"The deal that the operating group got was so good they will never lose money. But, it's not sure if the government will ever get a return on its investment\" (Railways Africa 2011b). This quote explains the problem with many contracts between the public and private sectors involving big projects, and the Gautrain is not different. While the private partners are sure to make money from the project, benefits to the public sector are less certain, and the question of ongoing help remains a challenge. In fact, there has been an additional unknown payment directly to Bombardier from the Gauteng government. It was reported by the opposition Democratic Party that \"the Gautrain Management Agency (GMA) together with the Gauteng Treasury and Department of Roads and Transport has paid out a big sum to Bombardier, the Gautrain operating company in an out of court settlement\" (Campbell 2017). The payment was made to settle \"all outstanding matters relating to phase one of the Gautrain project.\" Subsidies, and other costs, for the Gautrain could potentially mean less money for other transportation needs in the province. This concern was pointed out in 2005 by the Portfolio Committee on Transport: \"The Committee is worried that a big part of the Gauteng province's public transport budget could be used up in ongoing help for the Gautrain at the expense of other priorities\" (2005: 4). Even the Automobile Association (Engineering News 2015) has spoken against the level of help to the Gautrain: \"The Gautrain help is now using almost a quarter of the Gauteng Department of Transport's budget.\" They believe this money could be used better on other transportation needs, especially roads. While it is impossible to know exactly how much money Bombardier itself will make from this venture, the P3 format will make sure that steady profits will flow to the group for the duration of the contract.\n\nAnother big worry with the Gautrain is that other options, especially less costly ones, were not properly looked into or publicly talked about before the decision to start the project. In 2006, a big group (CO group) was sad because they didn't talk about other important things and ways of moving people and things. They said, \"We need to talk about other ways.\" A smart person, Jack, in 2007 said, \"Other ways of moving people and things don't seem to have been looked at well, and we don't know why they want to spend so much money on the GA project.\" He talked about other ways to do the GA project, like a special lane for buses, electric buses, and a light rail system, all of which would be less money. But, there is little proof that the local government talked about these other ways in a good way. In fact, a good look at the cost and benefits of the GA project shows some big problems with the benefits of the project compared to the big amount of public money used. A city moving expert, Ryan, from a big school in CA city, agrees: \"In my view, other ways of moving people other than the GA project have not been talked about enough\" (in Stephen 2005). He thinks that people traveling on a bus in a special lane could possibly travel between TS city and JO city in 69 minutes, compared to 60 minutes on the GA project, but it would be much less money. But, the province went ahead with the project without talking about and rigorously debating alternatives to fast rail in the region.\n\nOn the issue of being clear, critics also question the way this project was decided and talked about. This chapter already talked about the failure to tell about the nature of the promises in the talk phase of the project. A smart person at a big school in SA place, Madison, in 2015, argues:\n\nBeing clear about the GA project included not telling about the partnership information, not enough budget information, bad actions and the absence of clear bidding criteria. Talks between the public and private partners were done in closed, private places, on the idea of \"business secrets,\" including a part in contracts between governments and private groups to make sure secretiveness in partnerships.\n\nAgain, this type of secrecy is a common problem with the negotiation of P3s all over the world, but it has special characteristics in this context. SA place's bad action watchdog started an investigation in 2015 into talk that a big company had paid a lot of money to important people to get the GA project for the group. In a talk with the Globe and Mail, \"Mr. ZA man said he got a success fee of $3.5 million from the big company for his work on the GA project, in which he worked with a SA place lobbyist and businessman who is close to the ruling party, the AN party\" (York 2018b). This investigation is still going on, and according to a CA country reporter, Geoffrey York (2018b), \"has been delayed by not enough budget and a backlog of other alleged corruption cases.\" A big news center in SA country first shared the news in 2012 that \"A train company hired a controversial helper, Yosef, from TU country and agreed to give him a lot of money if he could help get a train contract\" (Samuel and Charlotte 2015). It was also said that Yosef made a deal with Peter-Paul, \"to get his help in getting the contract for the company\" (Frank 2015). The CBC (Samuel and Charlotte 2015) said:\n\nCBC News got an old version of the deal between the train company and Yosef as well as the deal Peter-Paul made with Yosef. Both are not very long and don't have a lot of details about the work they were supposed to do for the money they were promised. Experts say, usually, deals that don't have many details make people worry about possible bad things.\n\nEven though the train company is helping with the investigation and says they didn't do anything wrong, these types of payments to get contracts are still very suspicious.\n\nThe payment of \"success fees\" is not just in the SA case but seems to be a bigger thing for the train company. In 2017, a big newspaper did an investigation into the payment of this money by the train company, which took reporters to many places around the world, including SA country, TU country, SO country, and MA country. A person who used to work for the train company, who didn't want to say their name, said: \"What is a 'success fee'? It's a bribe. It's money that gets given to a helper \u2014 but do you get a lot of money just because the train company gets a contract? No, that money gets passed around\" (Big Newspaper 2017). The words \"success fee\" mean that the money is only given if the bid is successful, and the person who told the secret said that it was usually about 5 percent of the overall price. Even though it might be normal in many parts of the world to pay people like Yosef to help get contracts, this shows that the day-to-day world of big business is not very clear. It also makes people ask important questions about fairness and responsibility if contracts involving a lot of public money can be gotten this way, especially those involving the delivery of public things/services such as the big train. At last, it shows that the train company is good at competing for big projects, even though people say there is not a lot of transparency and/or there might be corruption. In other words, to make profits, companies like the train company need to be good at using the services of helpers like Yosef.\n\nAnother case of possible corruption in SA country involving the train company has recently come up. In 2014, the train company was one of four companies given a contract to supply trains to the state-owned freight company. In a recent year, the new leader of SA country, Cameron, started to clean up some big companies, including one called \"TR\". Patrick, the person in charge of public companies, mentioned a report from a law firm about a big train contract with a company that suggested the contract should be stopped. The report said that the contract was not done correctly and there was bad behavior. This case helps us understand the company's bigger role in SA country. It also shows how the CA country was involved in the company's work in other places. The CA country \"gave a lot of money to the train project to help the company become one of four companies in the deal\". This shows the clear connection between the company and the CA country, as government help is often important to the company getting contracts in other places.\n\nWhen thinking about other options for the train project, people have asked important questions about the lack of long-term planning and connecting of public travel in the province. Matthew (2011: 2) talks about the big problems related to connecting in Gauteng:\n\nThere is no complete travel system in Gauteng or in SA country. Public transport is broken up, not enough in terms of where it goes and how often, and has not grown with the city. There are no connected tickets, times, or branding. Different companies offer different services with different rules. Users do not see public transport as a connected product.\n\nIndeed, the train project \"is still very much a separate system\" that does not connect with already existing travel in the province (Cronin 2006). This includes a regular train called the Metrorail, buses, and minibuses/taxis. Another travel expert, Jessica (2014) from a big school in JO city, talks more about this lack of connection and planning with recent projects like the train project:\n\nThese projects, however, are not connected in a smart way into the bigger public transport system and are often called stand-alone because of a lack of managing public transport in terms of connected transport plans. The traditional train, bus and 16-seat taxi industries therefore work in separate areas and, in the case of the bus and train industries, are planned and funded separately from each other, leading to a further lack of connection.\n\nThe train project was built without thinking about how it could connect with these other systems, and works as a separate system of travel for the \"professional\" people.\n\nOne possible change to this trend, and one of the more hopeful projects currently being done in SA country, is that of Fast Bus Travel (FBT). The big bus system was first thought of in 2007. It's a system of buses that have their own lanes and stops for people to get on. The bus systems that are working now are the Rea Vaya in JO city and the MyCiTi in CA city. In GA place, the Rea Vaya helps people from a big town near JO city get to the center of JO city. It also goes to other places where people who don't have a lot of money live. This is a good thing because it helps people who can get to the stops. It's also cheaper to build than a fast train and is more affordable for riders. But, the big bus system had to be planned and put in place after the fast train was already done. People didn't think about and talk about it before they built the fast train. They didn't think about how it might work with other ways of getting around, like a big bus system. So, even though the big bus system could work together with the fast train, they weren't built with that in mind.\n\nThe problem of not planning and working together is made worse by the fact that there are many groups of people in charge of transportation in the area, and they don't work together. This is clear with the fast train, because two of the big city governments in the area weren't asked enough during the planning of the project. One city said: \"The people in charge of transportation weren't involved, or asked, in the studies done for the project by the people who built the fast train\". The fast train was managed by the provincial government on its own, even though city governments are usually in charge of planning public transportation. A story from 2006 in a website for a political group talks about this problem:\n\nCities are supposed to make transportation plans and put them into action... But with the fast train, we have a project that was pushed by the province. The province has ignored the spirit of the law and of national policy by making the fast train a separate public company. The project has ignored the transportation planning of the three big cities in GA place, all of whom have had to make it fit into their plans after the fact, hurting their own plans and maybe taking away money for more important things.\n\nSo, the provincial government's process of planning and putting in place the fast train project has resulted in a fast train system being put in the area without much thought for how it might work with city transportation plans. This story talks about a group of people who wanted to plan a better way for everyone to travel. They were asked to come up with a plan for the next five years and for the next twenty-five years. This group included people who knew a lot about planning for transport, people who studied a lot, people who worked for the government, and a person who worked for the workers who help with transport. They were asked to do this because a lot of money had been spent on a big transport project. But, this project was finished before they could plan how to make it work with other ways of traveling. This made some people worry. But, this group might be the best way to make sure things are planned better in the future.\n\nNext, the story talks about a big transport project. Some people knew there were problems with this project before it started. So, why did it still happen? A person who knows a lot about this says it's because of what this project means. Big projects like this one are often linked with the people in charge at that time. And, this project is quite a big deal. Even though this project used a lot of money and might make it harder for some people to travel, it shows that our place is important. It shows that we want to be seen as modern and connected. This is really important when it comes to big projects in other places, too.\n\nThis person also says it's useful to think about this project in relation to a big sports event that happened here. The idea that this project was needed for the sports event fits with the wish to show the world that we are modern and connected.\n\nThe big train, often called the \"SE train\" in SA country, has many problems for most people living there, which makes us think about the meaning behind it. The SE train makes people think of one man's dream to have a smart train and leave something behind with his name on it. This wish to be \"modern\" and leave something behind might have made Jane and others who first said yes to the SE train not think clearly. This might be why a project with so many big issues was allowed to go ahead without a lot of talk or thought about cheaper choices, or other important things to spend money on for the province in the area of getting around.\n\nDespite the many issues with the SE train talked about in this part, the people in charge of the SE train are planning to make the train tracks bigger. They have finished a study to see if this can be done, and it has been given to the big money holders and to the important people that were asked during the study (2017). The new project would make the train tracks almost two times longer, and add nineteen new stops. The study was finished in 2016, and \"the project is now waiting for a yes from the big money holders\" (Venter 2017). The people in charge of the SE train are waiting for a yes from the big money holders before formally asking for interest from private companies, but based on the first study, they are making similar predictions about the good things that will come from making the SE train bigger:\n\nThe study says that making the SE train tracks bigger will give big economic and transport benefits to the province and the country; that it is worth the money, and the risks are fair if it is a partnership between public and private. (SE Train Management 2017)\n\nThe bigger train would possibly make the traffic less, and help to connect more places to the fast train network. According to the people in charge, the economic benefits include \"211,000 jobs created in building; lots of money spent on black owned companies; more black ownership of companies in the train sector; a strong focus on local stuff in the supply chain, and more ability in the train sector through learning.\"\n\nAlthough no money numbers have been given for the bigger plans yet, this would certainly be another big spending of public money on the SE train. Also, the bigger train would not necessarily solve many of the problems talked about in this part about people not being able to get around, spending a lot of public money on a project for the rich, or the breaking up of public transportation in GA. Many people didn't like the idea of making the big train called GA bigger. They said it was too expensive. Jeremy (2017) said: \"I told people in a big meeting that the big train was a bad idea. It was taking money that could be used for other things. I still think this is true.\" Jeremy said clearly: \"Don't make the big train bigger\" (TV 2015). A big group (2016) agreed with Jeremy about the cost: \"People spend a lot of their money on getting around. It's not right that we use money from everyone to make a fancy train for only a few people.\" Mr. M also didn't like the idea. He said it would be better to put money into buses (JL n.d.). It's too soon to know if making the big train bigger is a good or bad idea, but it might have some of the same problems as the big train. It's also important to know that a big company could make a lot of money if the big train gets bigger. Y (2018b) said: \"The big company might get a big job to make up to 350 more coaches\" for the big train. This would be a lot more than the 96 coaches the big train has now.\n\nBIG COMPANY AND TAKING\n\nWhen we look at the big company, we can see that it's part of a bigger problem. The big company is making money from a project in SA that could cause a lot of problems. But this also helps us understand how taking happens in a different way. The big train is not like other cases where people are taken from their land for mines. But taking is still happening because money from everyone is being used for a few people. The big train also makes it harder for some people to get around. By looking at how money is spent on trains and how cities are set up, we can understand more about taking. The big train seems like a normal project. It doesn't hurt the environment, hurt people, or break any big rules. But it still helps us understand more about how things work. The idea is to change how we see a big company's work in SA country. From thinking it's good, to thinking about what it really means for the people getting this work.\n\nThe big train might be a new way of using public transport money for rich people in GA place and companies like the big company that will get money from the project. The question of right and wrong about getting money from such a project is not just for the big company but for the CA government and its people too. In the first part, I talked about how the CA government helps the big company in many ways, like helping with talks and giving money through different programs, and even lending the company money. This is public money. Even though the government does not seem to be helping the big company with this specific project in SA country, it's hard to separate one project from the big company's overall work and health as a company. The CA government has helped make sure the big company is good and can compete in world markets. Also, people in CA own parts of the big company, both on their own and through money saved for when they're old, and so they put money into and get benefit from the big company doing well.\n\nUnderstanding this specific case, and where it fits in a bigger look at world money-making, helps us understand the big company's work better. In some ways the SA case is very different than the other two big cases looked at in this book. It is not in a place that was taken over by another country but in a place that is trying to get better from a long and hurtful history of unfairness and being ruled by another country. It does not deal with questions of international law and world politics as in the IS/PA case, nor with questions of deciding for oneself, being free, and hurting the environment as in the CH/TI case. However, the SA case shows a way of understanding how people lose things that goes beyond just looking at land and shows how the big company's work in other places can be understood as different ways of taking things away from people.\n\nNOTES\n\n1. For a good look at the history of how JO city was created and grew, see BE (2004).\n\n2. The writer saw things himself at the big company's place in JO city, SA country, on June 7, 2011.\n\n3. It's also important that this requirement was taken out of the later version of the National Land Transport Act passed in 2009. One could guess that this was done to make the Act weaker, which would let projects like the big train go ahead without a court challenge.\n\n4. Committee Chair Jack has written a lot about the problems of the big train and why the Committee did not like it. For example, see Jack (2005).\n\n5. See \"V's book\" (2007: 335\u2013342). He talks about four big problems: \"the link between the costs and the people who will use it; how well new and old transport systems work together; if the public supports it; and finally, how long it will take\" (338). \nCHAPTER FOUR\n\nTHE IS CASE\n\nIn two small villages \u2014 BI village and BS village \u2014 people have fought against bad guys taking their land for many years. While the bad guys have taken land around these villages to build homes and a big wall, the most recent land taken is for a different reason \u2014 to build a fast train line connecting TE city to JE city. This train will move people over the 56 kilometres between the cities in 28 minutes. The route goes through the occupied land in two places and crosses the Green Line \u2014 a line between IS and its neighbors that was agreed after a big war and stayed until a time long ago.\n\nThis chapter explores the role of a big company in this train project. The company currently provides and services big coaches for the train system in and around TE city and will probably continue to do so when the new TE-JE Electric Line, or A1 fast train, is finished. The fact that the train line goes through the occupied land for about 6 kilometres brings up both legal and ethical questions for companies from other countries participating in the construction of the project, as well as for those who profit from its operation, such as the big company. There is strong evidence to suggest that the construction of this train line is against world law. Furthermore, the completion of this project must be looked at in the bigger picture of taking and losing land that has characterized the bad guys taking over the land since a time long ago. Similar to the CH city/Tibet case, this case study presents a chance to look at losing land that highlights a specific context rooted in taking land from others. When considering these two points, the big company's approach to this project may be surprising or unsettling for people who are interested in a fair solution to the IS-PA city problem. Moreover, resistance to the project, especially in the form of the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement, will eventually become a problem, at the least for the big company.\n\nThe case of the big company in IS/PA is important to study for the following reasons: the case has not been talked about much in CA, despite its importance in one of the most troubled and contested places on earth; it repeats and strengthens themes of losing land, described in Chapter 1, especially ideas surrounding colonial dispossession; and it involves important parts of international humanitarian law that make the case unique, but it also highlights aspects of dispossession that go with existing books on the extractive industries. In addition, this chapter also places CA foreign investment and trade as an important part of how people interact with the world beyond our borders and asks for scholars to look at these relationships more closely when engaging with important foreign policy debates. This story talks about some big questions about companies doing things that might not be okay, and how the country of CA helped a company go to the IS market.\n\nTHE STORY SO FAR\n\nTo understand the story of a fast train project, we need to first understand the story of a group of people who lost their home. They were Jewish people and they lived in different parts of Europe and RU city. Almost everywhere they lived, they were not treated well. In the old times, many Jewish people started to feel a strong love for their own culture. Some of them wanted to build a home for all Jewish people. A writer named Gabriel wrote:\n\nJewish people started to love their own culture in the 1880s in a place in RU country where they were forced to live. This happened because they were not able to fit in well in RU country and there were a lot of bad things happening to them.\n\nA small group of Jewish people, who were called Zionists, wanted to find a new home. They were trying to find out where to make their home. In the year that was a long time ago, a man from BR country named Henry went to JA place with a group of 21 Zionists. They wanted to see if PA land would be a good place for a Jewish home. At that time, Jewish people were a very small part of the people living in PA land. But \"by the year that was a long time ago, Jewish people were more than a quarter of the people living there.\" In the year that was a long time ago, BR country said they would help to make a Jewish home in PA land, which was a part of OT Empire. After the big war and a very bad time when a lot of Jewish people were killed by NA GE city, the UN started to officially make the Jewish state. Nathan wrote about how the land was divided:\n\nWhen the UN suggested dividing the land in the late 20th century, Jewish people were less than a third of the people and owned very little of the land. The UN's idea, which was not liked by the leaders of PA land and the AL, gave most of the land to the Jewish people. The plan was approved by the UN, and a war started the next day.\n\nThis led to the making of the IS country in the late 20th century. PA people call this event the \"big bad thing.\" In a book written by Isaac in the late 20th century, he talks about how a lot of people had to leave their homes in PA land. Isaac says: \"Half of the people living in PA land had to leave, half of their villages and towns were destroyed, and only a very few of them ever managed to return.\" Many other people have also written about this, talking about the problems between the new country and the people who lived in PA land.\n\nPeople use many ways to explain the problems in IS country and PA land since IS country was created. When talking about the political project, Gabriel argues: \"IS country building has followed from its very beginning the method of slowly taking over the land that also happened in CA country, AU country, SA country, and the SP country-speaking countries... the main feature of their society is not the use but the replacement of the local population.\" This process got more intense after a war in the late 20th century between IS country and some of its neighboring Arab countries, resulting in IS country controlling what is known as the Occupied PA Territories (OPT). Today the OPT include the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem, and the occupation is seen as a major break of international rules (Thomas 2012). The IS country occupation of these territories, especially the ongoing building of illegal IS settlements in the OPT, is one of the main problems to reaching a lasting peace in the region. The occupation can also be seen as a project as \"the construction of settlements in the West Bank means the separation, by law and by force, of the land itself from the people living on it\" (Gabriel 2017: 4). Building of settlements and the moving of IS populations into the West Bank are both part of the project of Zionism. Some scholars have changed their descriptions of the problems in order to more accurately describe its occurrence in this particular context. Sophia uses the term \"space-death\" to describe the manner in which IS country has removed PA people from the land, suggesting that the project \"targets land for the purpose of making the 'voluntary' transfer of the PA population, mainly by targeting the space upon which the PA people live.\" For Sophia, this started with the leaving of 750,000 PA people during the formation of the IS country and continues through annexations similar to the one described in this case study. \n\nStephen Graham (2002: 642) uses the term \"urbicide\" to describe certain aspects of the IS country state's dispossession of Palestinians. Writing after Ariel Sharon ordered the bulldozing of the centre of the Jenin refugee camp in April 2002, Graham argues that the purpose of urbicide is \"to deny the PA country people their collective, individual and cultural rights to the city-based modernity long enjoyed by Israelis. Sharon's was a deliberate strategy to compel Palestinians to indefinite poverty.\" Graham cites the large-scale destruction of urban infrastructure during times of conflict and the disproportionate levels of investment in modern infrastructure in the settlements as opposed to PA country communities, as evidence to suggest that the IS country state is attempting to deny Palestinians access to vibrant, modern urban spaces.\n\nIn addition to the academic literature in this area, several non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have documented the processes of dispossession on the ground. B'Tselem, an IS country human rights organization, has dedicated considerable effort to detailing the IS country state's ongoing demolitions of PA country structures in the West Bank.3 PA country civil society actors have also documented this aspect of dispossession, with a report written by the PA country Grassroots Anti-Apartheid Wall Campaign \u2014 Stop the Wall focusing on the rural communities Al-Hadidiya and Um al-Kheir. These communities are located in a peripheral part of the West Bank often referred to as \"Area C,\" which has been under \"temporary\" IS country military and civilian control since the Oslo Accords in 1995, with the intention of eventually handing the territory over to the PA country Authority. However, Stop the Wall (2017: 12) argues that temporary measures \"are used to legitimize the steady colonization and concomitant expulsion of the PA country population from over half of the West Bank.\" This includes denying building permits to Palestinians and then demolishing structures that are built \"illegally.\" Stop the Wall summarizes the impact of the repeated demolitions of hundreds of PA country structures: \"What is at stake is the expulsion of Palestinians from territory that the IS country government seeks to dominate and incorporate into the borders of the state\" (9). This organization also uses the lens of settler colonialism to describe the nature of dispossession in these peripheral areas:\n\nFrom our perspective displacement, military occupation, civil control over Area C, and home demolitions are all particular expressions of a deeper settler colonial logic... Like the Wall, forced removal is justified by IS city as necessitated for security reasons... In effect \"security\" for IS city hinges on securing settler homogeneity through indigenous removal. (14)\n\nBOMBARDIER IN ISRAEL\n\n A little while after the big leaders in CA country made a deal to trade freely with IS country, people from a big company named BO and lots of other people went on a trip to IS country. The goal of the trip was to start the new trade agreement, which started on the first day of the new year and helped CA businesses to sell things to IS country. This trip happened in the second month of the new year, and it was said that \"IS country wanted to talk about their plans for a new train network in a big city, an area where companies like BO are really good at\" (IS person). Another trip was arranged by the CA leaders in the second month of two years later, which included two important sales people from BO. The efforts of the CA leaders and BO to work with the IS train market started to work very quickly. In the hot season of the same year, the company got its first agreement with IS Trains to deliver four big trains. The trains were worth a lot of money and consisted of one driving coach and three middle coaches; the agreement also included \"options for more trains in the first and second phases\" (G&M Report). This was the start of a partnership between BO and IS Trains that still exists today \u2014 a partnership the CA leaders had a big role in making.\n\nA little while after making its first deal in IS country, BO tried to get a deal to build and operate a light rail system in JE city. People were upset because part of the rail system was to be built in a part of JE city that IS country had taken over. People from PA country did not want the rail line to be built, seeing it as \"an attempt by IS country to keep their control of lands taken over\" (AD person). ZA, then PA leader for JE city, explained the objections like this: \"IS country is trying to change JE city and create more facts to make these changes permanent. This is on land that was taken over and any act that IS country does on that land is not right. And anyone who will help in this act would be helping in a not right act\" (AD person). Even though the CA leaders do not accept IS country's take over of East JE city, they did not oppose \"CA companies working on the rail project, saying that is a 'business choice.'\" So, the CA leaders continued to support BO, even with the questions about the status of East JE city and the potential involvement of BO in IS country's alleged breaking of big rules. BO left from the group of companies trying to get the contract in the early part of the new year, as did another CA company named SNC-LA. A person from a big train company said: \"We decided to stop trying to make trains for a place because of business reasons\" (Scheer, late 20th century). But, people from IS country thought it was because of things the PA people said. No matter why they stopped trying, the train company then tried to become the main train maker for IS country.\n\nFrom the start to the middle of the 21st century, the train company slowly became the main maker of big trains for IS country's train work \"used in the city and for going to other places\" (Train company, middle 21st century). At the start of the 21st century, the company made a deal worth a lot of money to give six trains, which made \"23 big trains ordered by IS country, with 14 already given\" (News, early 21st century). This was followed by a deal two years later to make 54 more cars (News, early 21st century). More sales ended in a deal ten years later of 78 big train cars in a deal that made the train company the only one in the deal (News, early 21st century). The deal ten years ago was big because the train company also agreed to build a place to fix the trains in IS country. A man, named Yosef, who was the main person from the train company in IS country, said in the same year that \"The train company will grow from having seven people to 70 in the middle of the 21st century, and more depending on if our trains are bought.\" In the middle of the 21st century, IS country asked for 72 more train cars, which made the total number of big train cars bought from the train company to 222 (News, middle 21st century). A deal worth a lot of money was made five years ago for the train company to give 62 more electric trains, as the train company is helping a lot in making the trains use electricity (News, middle 21st century). Last, the train company made a deal two years ago for 54 big train cars \"for use on the new fast city-city train road\" to be given by this year (News, late 21st century). So, over the last many years, the train company and IS country's train work have made a good and long partnership. With the help of the CA country, the train company has become the main maker of big train cars for the travel system in and around the big city. This is important for what comes next, as the train company's train cars will be used on the talked-about city-city train road that is being built now.\n\nWe should know that there is no proof of direct help from the CA country for the train company's work in the A1 train work. The CA country has not said what they think about the right or wrong questions about the A1 work and has not given direct help to the train company for making the train cars. The big country of CA helped a big company start selling things in the IS country. The big country's help was very important for the company to do well in the new place. The big country of CA and the company worked so close together that you can't tell them apart. The big country of CA has also been a good friend of IS for a long time, which makes companies from CA feel welcome in IS.\n\nThere used to be a train line from TE city to JE city a long time ago. It was built by a big empire to connect different places. The train line was used for a long time, but then better roads were built and people stopped using the train. The train line was closed for a little while after IS became a new country, and then it was closed again:\n\nIn the last years, one train went every day and it took almost two hours. It was more for people who wanted to see pretty mountains and valleys than for people who needed to get from TE city to JE city. Buses left every 15 minutes, and it took less than an hour to get from one city to the other.\n\nIn 1993, the group that takes care of ports and trains in IS started planning a new fast train between TE city and JE city. They talked about a lot of things, like keeping the mountains and valleys pretty, building more houses, and where to build the train line. They also had to think about how much it would cost to build tunnels and what other countries would think about the train line.\n\nThey planned to finish the train line by 2008, but now they plan to open it in the fall of 2018. The delay was because of many reasons, like not enough checks and not having all the permissions to build. They also didn't think about how building the train line would affect the environment, which caused problems with groups that care about nature.\n\nThe main issue about the train path I'm looking at is that it goes into a place where people are not free, called WE area, in two places. First, the path goes into the WE area to make the route straight, and second, it crosses the line \"to make some people happy who didn't want tracks near their houses\" (a paper in 2010). The train path goes about six big steps across the Green Line - the line between IS country and its neighbors from a long time ago - in the WE area. This makes people worry about the rules of building the A1, especially about IS country's promise to follow good people's law. People have written a lot about the wrong things of the IS country's control of the WE area, which can be seen as a never-ending act of settlers taking over.7 CA country - one of IS country's best friends - does not agree with IS country's full control of the controlled areas (Global Affairs CA city n.d.), and many UN Security Council (UNSC) decisions and UN General Assembly (UNGA) decisions have said bad things about the IS country's continued control of PA areas and not following the Fourth Geneva Convention. The UNSC passed Decision 2334, in 2016,\n\nsaying no to all things trying to change the people, character and status of the PA Territory controlled since a long time ago, including East Jerusalem, including, among other things, building and expanding of settlements, moving of IS settlers, taking of land, destroying of homes and moving of PA people, against good people's law and important decisions.\n\nThe taking of land inside the controlled WE area to build the train line must be seen in this situation.\n\nTo check if the train line is okay, one must look at those parts of good people's law that talk about the use of public and private things in controlled territory. The Hague Rules (1907), the Fourth Geneva Convention (1949), and the Rule of the International Court (ICC) are the three main rules. The Hague Rules were made to make rules for countries to follow about war on land, and most importantly for the case at hand, rules about control. Even though there were only thirty-eight countries that followed the Hague Rules in 1907, they \"are seen as rules of good people's law. As such they are also binding on Countries which did not formally agree to them\" (International Committee of the Red Cross n.d.). Article 55 of the Hague Rules says\n\nthe controlling Country should be seen only as administrator and user of public buildings, real things, forests, and farming lands belonging to the other Country, and situated in the controlled territory. It must protect these properties, and use them following the rules of use. (International Committee of the Red Cross n.d.)\n\nEven though this Article has been understood in many ways, most people argue that it means that the controlling power is not allowed to make permanent changes in the controlled territory.8 Besides, the limits in the Article \"say no to the controller from messing with the work of the controlled territory to get benefits for itself\" (Azarov 2012). Train tracks are often seen as something that stays for a long time, and the A1 project is made mainly for people living in IS country. People living in the OC area will usually not be able to use the areas where the train runs, except for some people living in JE city.\n\nA rule from a big book of rules is also important for this:\n\nAny breaking by the ones in charge of things that belong to individual people, or to the state, or to other big groups, is not allowed, unless such breaking is absolutely needed for fighting. (International Friends who help out n.d.)\n\nBuilding the A1 train track on OC land could be breaking this rule. Also, the train project does not have fighting uses and has never been said to be needed for fighting. A big book of rules gives more ideas for understanding the legal parts of taking land in times of war and charge. One part, which talks about big bad things related to war, says \"breaking or taking the other side's stuff unless such breaking or taking be absolutely needed by the needs of war\" (Ro book of rules 2002) is a bad war thing. Even if IS country is not a part of the big group, this is important when talking about companies doing bad things. One report sums up the legal worries like this:\n\nBreaking its rules under big helping and people rights law, IS country as the one in charge has, without fighting need, taken privately owned PA land with the aim of building long lasting things, mainly to serve the needs of its own people. (BAD Friends who help out with PA living and moving rights n.d.)\n\nA last legal point is about the materials that have been taken from the train tunnels. Part of the train crossing into the OC area will be running in underground tunnels, and a big amount of dirt and rock has been dug up and taken away from the area during the building phase. According to Who Gets from the Charge (2010: 8),\n\nabout 530,000 cbm are estimated to be taken from the first tunnel alone, almost all from within the occupied PA area. Another 515,000 cbm will be taken from the two other tunnels which cross into occupied areas, two thirds of which is estimated as reusable material, to be used by the builder or sold for use in the building industry.\n\nIn a legal idea given by Al-H, an independent PA group helping with human rights based in RA, WB, the taking of these materials has legal parts. Using specifically one part of the Ha Rules, quoted above, it says that \"they [the materials] should be seen as non-renewable resources which are part of the land and whose substance cannot be used for the benefit of the ones in charge\" (2013: 5). Al-Haq says that if these dug up things are taken from the OT land and used to help the people in power, or the companies doing the building work, this would be very wrong.\n\nIn response to these worries, an IP planning group first said that there are plans to make the train line go to PC cities in the WB area, like RA city, and even to the coast of GA. So, they said, the train project could help both IPs and PCs in the OT land and does not break any big rules. But, because the OT land situation has been going on for a long time, PC people do not want the train, GA is still under control, and PC people living in the OT land can't move around easily, this claim does not seem very strong or honest. In fact, these first plans seem to have been changed with a new plan to just connect the JR light train network to several IP homes in the WB area.\n\nThe IP state says that the rules and principles of the big GC, along with other parts of big people rules and human rights rules, do not apply to the OT PC territories because they were not previously recognized as part of a big state. This position was disagreed with most clearly by the 2004 advice of the UN ICJ, when it ruled on the wrongness of IS city's separation wall. The ICJ said: \"The Court thinks that the big GC is applicable in the PC territories which before the 1967 conflict were to the east of the GL and which, during that conflict, were occupied by IS city.\"\n\nGNR (DB) decided to stop its work on the building of the A1 train in 2011, because they were worried about the route going through the WB. GTM PR announced at the time: \"This IP train project which goes through OT is problematic from a foreign policy standpoint and is potentially against big rules\". The GS-owned company made this decision in response to worries raised by members of the GP, the PC foreign affairs minister, and civil society organizations. A spokesperson for GE city's federal MTBUA, VM, explained GE city's position regarding the company's activity: \"The federal government makes sure that this activity does not include projects that might be sensitive politically or with regard to big rules.... That is a rule and applied in all countries.\" So, at least one of the companies involved with the first building and planning of the high-speed line was worried enough about the legal implications of crossing into OT to end its participation in the project. This principled stance is different to the support the CG offers the IP state, even in the face of potential violations of big rules. DB is owned by the GR, which makes the link between its business operations and the GE country government (and its foreign policy) more clear, and allows people to demand a level of responsibility from DB that Canadians may not be able to demand from private corporations such as B. There was a big company that got lots of help from the country. People think we should be able to ask this company questions about what they do in other places, because it's connected to us and our country.\n\nAnother company from IT country that helped build the project was also talked about a lot. A group called Stop That Train wanted this company to stop working on the project. Because of this, some cities in IT country said they did not like what the company was doing. The group said that the company was not following the rules about treating people nicely and not taking things from others. This company became very important for a group that looks at if people are following the rules. This group said:\n\nThe company from IT country could be in trouble because they are helping with things that are very bad and not following the rules about war and not taking other people's things.\n\nEven though people were upset and said the company was doing bad things, the company didn't stop working.\n\nTHE TRAIN PROJECT AND TAKING THINGS AWAY\n\nWe also need to think about how the train project is part of a bigger story about people losing their things. First, some people who live in the area were hurt by the train project. A group from IS country did some research in two places that were hurt a lot by the train \u2014 BE town and BI town. BE town had already lost a lot of its land to a big wall before the train project started, while BI town had lost a lot of its land to new houses and the wall. The group's research showed that in BE town,\n\nafter the big wall was built, people who worked during the day couldn't work in JE city anymore, and they didn't have jobs. About 30% of the town's money comes from farming: they grow plums, olives, and tomatoes and cucumbers in greenhouses. For many villagers, farming was not possible anymore because a big wall stopped them from getting to much of their land. \n\nThe people were afraid of losing more land, this time to the big train project. This fear became real when the people in charge took 50,000 big steps of land from the village of BE town. \n\nThe people of two villages did not want the chosen path for the train and had told the people in charge about their worries but nothing changed. They said that the new train would take away farming land and asked for help from people in other places. BE village council said: \"This train line would bring troubles and noise, without any good things, as the train is for places that village people... are not allowed to go\". They asked for help and said: \"We, the people of BE, do not want the train line on our land. We think it's very important that people of the world help us decide what to do with our land and help us change the path of this train line\". So, the train track is being built on their land even though they do not want it. In the end, the train did not get the okay from the PA group, which was needed to take the track through the WE land. Instead, the PA group did not like the new plan and asked for help from people in other places to stop it.\n\nEven though the amount of land lost and the number of people directly affected by the train is small, it is important to understand this within the bigger story of the place. While some books and reports use different ways to explain and understand what is happening, one thing that is always there is that the people in charge have slowly taken more and more land for their own uses since they took over in the late 20th century. They have taken land to build homes, check places, and the big wall. It is important to see the connection between the building of the railroad and these other projects. The leader of the BE Council, Adam, says: \"We do not know where to start: the check place, the wall, more homes on our lands, people attacking, soldiers in the valley. The train is just one part of it all\". This clearly shows the place of the train line within the bigger experience of losing land experienced by the people in the OT places.\n\nTHE TRAIN STORY\n\nThere is a big train company called B. They want to work with the train company in IR country for a long time and make a lot of money. They don't think there is anything wrong with their work in IR country. When someone asked about the train going into a new area, the boss of the B company, Benjamin, said this:\n\nThis is not a problem. What do we make? Train systems for everyone, no matter where they come from. There is no unfairness in IR country. Everyone can use a good and fast train, no matter where it goes. We can work on all train projects in IR country, even the one in the big city. We don't think about politics. \n\nAnother company called D doesn't think the same. They don't want to work on projects in other countries if it's against the rules. But B doesn't care. They even want to work on the train project in the big city. They tried to do this before in the early years. They think making money is more important than politics. They also worked on a fast train project in CH country. They say they just do business and don't think about politics. But because of the problems between PA and IS people and the importance of the area, it's hard to believe that working on the project is not political.\n\nBenjamin also said that \"there is no unfairness in IR country.\" But some people think there is. The big organization called UN did a study about unfairness in IR country. They read a lot and thought a lot about the rules. Their report said:\n\nIR country has made an unfair system that controls the PA people. Knowing this is a big claim, the writers of the report think that the evidence shows without a doubt that IR country is guilty of doing things that are against the rules of fairness as defined in international law.\n\nThis long and controversial report was taken back after pressure from the boss of UN, Antonio. Rachel, the boss of the UN part that did the study, quit her job after that. She said: \"I quit because I have to tell the truth about a clear wrong, and I stand by everything in the report.\" Some people think that Antonio made them take back the report because of the influence of the US. The big group called PBNC said: \"It's not news that a big boss at the UN gave in to pressure from the TR country leader to keep IS country safe\" (Adam 2017a). Even with all the noise after the report came out, the report is one of the clearest and strongest calls for people all around the world to see the situation as not fair. The report also came after a big report was given to the big meeting at the UN in 2007 by Jack, a really smart man who knows a lot about the rules that countries should follow, from SO country. His report (2007) said:\n\nThe people all over the world have pointed out three things that are bad for people's rights - taking over other people's land, not being fair, and foreign control. IS country is clearly in control of the OPT. At the same time parts of the control are like taking over other people's land and not being fair, which are against the rules that countries should follow.\n\nIt joins a growing number of reports by smart people that say the IS country fits the legal definition of not being fair (Frank 2017; Benjamin and Alice 2016; Thomas 2012; and Cameron 2016).\n\nBombardier's work in IS country also happens at the same time as a growing movement to stop supporting IS country. In its own words, the movement \"works to stop international support for IS country's unfair treatment of Palestinians and pressure IS country to follow the rules\" (BDS Movement 2016a). About 170 groups in PA country started the movement in 2005 as a peaceful way to put pressure on the IS country. According to smart people Abigail and Yasmeen (2009: 42), \"the BDS call is special because it is clear and all of PA society supports it.\" It is a call for help from people all around the world to \"start big boycotts and stop investing... [and] to pressure... countries to stop supporting IS country\" until IS country follows the rules by:\n\n1. Stopping its control and taking over all Arab lands and taking down the Wall.\n\n2. Treating the Arab-PA country citizens of IS country as equals; and\n\n3. Respecting and protecting the rights of people from PA country to go back to their homes and lands as said in U.N. rule 194. (BDS Movement 2016b)\n\nThe BDS campaign is a perfect example of what smart people in the field of global society call the \"boomerang\" effect. This means that when people can't change their own country, they reach out to friends and other countries around the world to bring the \"boomerang\" back to put pressure on their own leaders. This way is often used in cases of people's rights being abused, and the goal is to work with friends in other countries to make things better at home. In this story, people in many places heard about a group called BDS and started to join in their goals.\n\nWhile some people don't like BDS, it has been able to do a lot of things since it started. These include big money groups taking their money away from companies that do bad things in IS country, famous people supporting a boycott, and many school groups agreeing to support BDS.14 Apart from the GE company we talked about before that left the A1 building project, another company from FR country also left all its work in IS country, which also included leaving the JE city train project (Global Rail News 2015). This happened after BDS people kept asking them to leave for many years.15 BDS has also been focusing on the A1 train project and the foreign companies that help to build it. In 2010, the BDS group in PA country (n.d.) said that \"IS country's A1 fast train project to connect JE city and TE city breaks important rules\" and asked \"private businesses to leave the project right away.\" This became the reason for groups in both GE and IT countries to start campaigns against the companies in their countries that were involved with the project. Even though the GE company owned by the government left, the IT company Pizzarotti kept working on the project.\n\nAs for Bombardier, they are just starting to face people in CA country not liking their work on the A1 line. This is probably because the train line is not finished yet, so people have mostly been focusing on the companies that are helping to design and build the track. But, in late 2015, Independent Jewish Voices (IJV) CA, a Jewish group in CA country that asks the IS government to follow international rules, posted a letter to Bombardier on its website that publicly criticized the company and encouraged Canadians to sign the letter. The letter says: \"I am upset to have read that Dr. Liam of Bombardier said that he has no problem with IS trains going beyond the Green Line, the line that everyone agrees is the border of IS\" (Independent Jewish Voices \u2013 CA n.d.). As the opening of the fast A1 line gets closer and more people around the world start to support BDS, this will probably not be the last time Bombardier faces pressure. Both Bombardier and the CA government may face more questions about their work in IS country in the future.\n\nLuckily for Bombardier, the CA government does not like BDS. In January 2015, former foreign affairs minister Jack Baird met with his friend from IS country, Avigdor Lieberman, and after their meeting, Baird said: \"CA will fight any efforts internationally to make IS country look bad, including the disturbing Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) Movement\" (Government of CA 2015). The election that brought the Liberals to power in 2015 does not seem to have changed the CA government's position on BDS. A long time ago, a vote was held in CA country, where many people were against others who did not like IL country. Almost all members of a big group supported this. This shows that CA country has always been a good friend to IL country. They often vote against things that try to punish IL country for not following the rules. For example, in the late 20th century, CA country was one of only seven places that voted against a big rule that said IL country was doing wrong things and should follow the rules. So, a big company named BO is safe in its work with IL country, because what it says and does is the same as what CA country does. However, a letter from a group might mean that more people will start to not like what BO is doing in IL country. BO, and CA country, will need to think more about how to respond to this.\n\nOn the other hand, it seems like the normal people in CA country have different thoughts. A group did a study in the early part of a year, and found out some things. First, most of the people think that it's okay to punish countries that do not follow the rules and do bad things to people, and many people think it's okay to not like IL country. Second, more than half of the people do not agree with the vote that happened a year ago, while less than a third of the people do agree with it. This shows a big difference between what the people think and what the people in charge do. Daniel, a news writer, a lawyer, and a person who used to speak for a green group, said to a news website: \"These numbers are surprising... Our government's support for IL country is not just wrong and unfair, it's not smart, because it's not a good way to get votes to be for IL country \u2014 the opposite is true\". This shows that the people in CA country might hold BO, and CA country, responsible for their part in the new train project in IL country.\n\nIn a talk with a news writer named George, a man named Oliver said:\n\nMany people are realizing that IL country is doing wrong things, and are therefore doing things to make it follow the rules. IL country is realizing that companies are leaving their projects in IL country that do not follow the rules, big money groups are doing the same, big artists are not wanting to play in TA city. As more people join the BDS movement around the world, people in CA country can and should help. Big groups in CA country, like the ones for peace and justice, are getting people to join the BDS movement. This is important because the government is still supporting the IS state. An artist and activist from PA city who lives in CA country says: \"BDS doesn't need the help of the Western governments... As the actions of IS state continue, we need to put pressure on them more than ever.\" The case of a big company could make people pay more attention to how CA country is connected to this project. It also shows us how activists are trying to fix the bigger problems in that area. \n\nLAST PART AND LESSONS\n\nThe case of the big company in IS/PA involves a different situation and lots of challenges about the rules of the world and what the IS state should do. Even though what's happening to the people of PA is different from other cases, there are many similar themes to the stories about big companies from CA country. The basic idea of a company from CA country making money in another country under these conditions is the same in all the cases. The big company and the government of CA country make us think about our role in investing and trading in other countries. As the story of the A1 train shows, the big company is making money from a difficult project in this troubled area. It is also possible that the big company is involved in breaking the rules of the world that this chapter talks about. People in CA country are helping to pay for and are making money from the company's projects in different ways, from owning parts of the company, to using tax money to support the company, and to the tax money that the company pays to the government of CA country.\n\nThe questions about the right and wrong of funding and making money from the A1 project go beyond the company itself and affect the government of CA country and the people of CA country. The government of CA country believes that \"the rules apply in the occupied areas and say what the IS state should do,\" and that \"the settlements are also a big problem for peace\" (GA CA city n.d.). I say that it is hard for the government of CA country to agree with this belief and the fact that a company from CA country \u2014 the big company \u2014 is providing trains for the A1 fast line. The government of CA country not only helped the big company get into the IS market, but it also criticizes those who support the BDS movement and doesn't say much about the IS state's illegal occupation of PA territory. The big company is doing business in an area with deep divisions and problems, while being the target of a big movement that wants to pressure the IS state to follow the rules of the world.\n\nThe story about the IS country and the PA country can help us understand the story about the CH country and the TI place better, especially the part about taking things that don't belong to you. Both stories are different, but they both talk about taking things. This makes us think more than just about money and power. The story in IS country and PA country makes us see how important land is when people take things that don't belong to them. People in PA country have lost land because of new homes in IS country and a big wall, and now there is going to be a train track too. Some smart people, helpers, and big bosses have said that this is like taking things that don't belong to you. Over many years, IS country has slowly taken more and more land from PA country, and while doing this they have tried to make the people from PA country leave their land. This is shown very clearly when homes in PA country are knocked down in the edges of the WE bank, as written by Stop the Wall (2017). However, a quieter example of taking things can be seen in the villages of BE place and BE place, both affected by the train track. As more and more of their land is taken, it becomes harder for them to live on their land, and the train track is making things worse.\n\nTo really understand the taking of things in PA country, it is very important to look again at how the people from PA country are fighting against IS country. A famous smart person from PA country who lives in AM city, named Edward, said many years ago that \"the main parts of life in PA country are being taken from, being sent away, being scattered, losing rights (under the power of IS country), and, very importantly, fighting against all these things\" (said by someone else in 2017: 131). This fight is seen in the people from PA country trying to make the bosses from IS country change the path of the train and then asking helpers from around the world to make these problems bigger. We also see it in the fight of the helpers in PA country to start a big NO movement against IS country. But there is a special part of this fight that is like the story from TI place and it tells the story of taking things across both stories. The word \"sumud\", meaning being strong or never giving up, for the people in PA country has come to mean \"the art of living to survive and do well at home even when things are hard and under bad rules\" (Marie, Hannigan, and Jones 2017: 10). More specifically, sumud is very connected to the people from PA country's love for the land, because \"staying on the land is not just about power, but about things you can touch as well\" (Stop the Wall 2017: 21). In writing about the continuous fight against IS country and their rules, Stop the Wall (30) shines a light on what sumud means for groups fighting against taking things, such as the Popular Council for the Protection of the JO city Valley and the Land Defense Coalition:\n\nThese helpers understood that sumud, or being strong, in the face of people taking things required both helping the needs of the people so that they could use and live off the land as well as coming up with plans to directly fight against IS country trying to take it. People need things to live and also to fight against bad things. You can't fight without things you need and you can't have things you need without fighting against the bad things. \n\nTheir love for their land and their want to stay on their land are very important to fight against bad things. This love for land is very important to have things they need and to fight against bad things.\n\nIn a time of spring and summer, people from GA place remembered a very bad thing that happened many years ago by having a big walk back march. Out of many people, most of them were made to leave their land when IS country was made in the old times. People had a walk to the wall that separates them from their land to ask for their right to go back to their land. The soldiers of IS country hurt many people in a way that a big group of good guys said was very bad. Many years later, the people from GA place still love their land, and this love shapes how they fight. Here again, we see how important it is to understand how taking land from people is from a bad guy's point of view. Looking at these two things together lets us understand better the effects of taking land from people, while also seeing the meaningful connections between different cases.\n\nNOTES\n\n1. For example, look at books by Sh, P, and K. Also, P maps out the history of this study and its place in today's learning.\n\n2. For example, look at R's work.\n\n3. For a detailed talk about the destroying of houses and the talks about laws, look at B's work.\n\n4. For a good story about how JE city changed since the bad things started, look at T and A's work.\n\n5. It is also important to note that the agreement to build a place to fix things in IS country put B in the middle of a long work problem between IS Railways and H. The deal was made without telling the union, and they saw this as a big act of giving their work to others. For more understanding of the problem, see N and B's work; B and S's work; and K and N's work.\n\n6. For more about trains in this place, see a book by Cameron (a long time ago).\n\n7.

One good thing for the people in the area could be jobs while the project is being built. For example, a news website said: \"About 200 people are working on digging tunnels in the WE area, as part of the big A1 train project, the biggest project in IS country in ten years\" (Peter a while ago). However, it also found out that \"some of these men said they are not treated well in BI village, a village near JE city where two tunnels are being dug. One man from the area said he was hired by someone to get workers for the construction site. The person who hired him takes more than half of what he earns.\" So, some of the bad things that happen under control might be happening with the jobs on this project.\n\n11.

Even though Victoria's company did not say the decision was because of pressure from people, companies almost never do. The normal thing is for a company to say it's a business decision so it doesn't look like they are doing anything for political reasons. \nENDING\n\nPOLITICAL THINGS AND GOING AHEAD\n\nEach of the three things we looked at in this book is different, but they all have the same thing: taking away. All three things show the hard part of doing business in places where there are fights about politics and geography, and how a company can be involved in these processes of taking away. These findings add to the growing work of scholars and people who want change talking about the CA country mining industry. This book also adds to the more general books on CA country foreign policy and why it's important to look at non-state actors, like corporations, when looking at how CA city interacts with the rest of the world. Instead of thinking a helpful, giving, productive role in the world, CA country companies like Bombardier are doing business that has bad effects on many people in the places they go. Also, the CA country government is involved in making these trade and investment deals. There is a big company called 'B'. Both the CA country and the company are part of some big plans. These plans have lots of problems involving people and the earth.\n\nThere are some big ideas about how people take land from others. These ideas help us to understand these big plans. Without understanding how people take land, we might miss some important things about power and control in these plans. These ideas also help us understand how people fight against having their land taken. So, these ideas about how land is taken can help us think about how the CA country's companies work in other countries.\n\nThe company 'B' says it is just doing business and not getting involved in politics. But, big projects that cause a lot of arguments are always about politics. For example, the relationship between CH country and TI place is very difficult, and the new train system is important for CH country to control TI place. Even though 'B' did not start the problem, it is making money from this difficult project and helping it succeed. In the IS/PA case, 'B' is part of a project in a place with a lot of problems and it is involved in a situation that many people say is not right. Both of these projects show how big projects in difficult places are always about politics. Even in the case of the fast train in SA place, where big fights do not directly involve politics, it is still not right to say this project is just business. A person named 'VA' (2017: 552) reminds us that big projects like transportation are always about politics. The fast train case is a perfect example of how a country's decisions about transportation can affect the people and can make some people feel left out. The stories in this book show how these train projects are very much about politics and it is important to understand this.\n\nThese cases also help us understand more about politics between countries. The CH-TI situation talks about big ideas like who is in charge, who can do what, and problems from a long time ago about who owns what. The QI-TI Train can be seen as a thing that makes CH country stronger and helps it get more things, or as a thing that does not respect the TI people's want to do things their own way. Also, this situation makes us think about keeping our world clean and using things wisely. These are all big ideas that companies from far away, like the BO company, get into when they choose to be a part of such projects. The IS-PA situation is like the CH-TI situation in a lot of ways, but also has the added problem of breaking big, world rules. The important rules about where the A1 train goes should be thought about by the IS country, but should also worry companies that might break big, world rules.\n\nThe SA situation is different because it doesn't have the same clear links to ideas of human rights, big world rules, doing things your own way, or harming the world. But, the GA Train situation shows a kind of not nice thing that points to more sneaky ways of taking things away. Paula's work about mining in Africa is very important for understanding why we shouldn't just focus on the really obvious bad things when talking about unfair things far away. In talking about not nice things, she quotes some people:\n\nOften, the most not nice acts are things that are okay, pushed for, or seen as good or right. Most not nice things are not bad behavior, not not liked, but the opposite, they are seen as good things that help normal social, money, and political ideas. (Butler 2015: 87)\n\nAs Paula (2016: 287) says, her goal is \"to show the normal, everyday, not flashy way in which bad things happen,\" even though it gets \"little media attention and even less people worrying and getting mad.\" She also wants to show\n\nhow that not nice thing \u2014 the not nice thing of everyday unfairness related to taking things \u2014 is okay by normal people (who are generally not called \"settlers\" or \"colonizers\") from a normal modern democratic country (which is, outside of school, not often called a \"white ruler country\").\n\nIn the SA situation, the GA Train was okayed by a real, democratic government, with the BO company being a part of an open and fair process to get a job. Also, the company in question is from CA, a country that is known around the world for being nice to people. This is exactly the kind of normal, legal, and accepted way of doing business that Paula talks about that usually doesn't get attention while at the same time could cause a lot of harm.\n\nWithout the more extreme worries about human rights and big world rules that the CH-TI and IS-PA situations have (at least since the end of a bad time), the GA Train situation makes us think more carefully about the normal business things that are part of deeply unfair power relationships around the world. Big companies like \"BO company\" can pay extra money to get jobs in places like SA country. They say \"this is okay and many companies do this in many countries\" (News 2017). The bad things of the fast train talked about in this book show a way of taking that is not so clear, but still important. At the same time, the past and the unfair laws are the reason for the problems of moving in the area, which connects the three cases. Many poor people in SA country have trouble with safe and good public buses and trains, while the government spends a lot of money on making the rich people's fast train better. This is the bad system talked about by Benjamin, as the problems with moving can keep the unfairness going in a normal and not special way.\n\nMORE CASES AND FUTURE LEARNING\n\n\"BO company\" has done a lot of transport jobs in many countries over the past years. Most of these jobs have not been checked by scholars and so there is very little learning material available on most of the cases. My job here is to talk about three important cases to start a talk, and a learning path, about the company's international jobs. I hope that others will continue my work, using this learning on other new and coming up jobs like the ones in SA country, EG country, and countries in the bottom of Africa.\n\nThe CA government has been talked bad about for saying okay to selling arms to SA country, which is CA city's \"top place for selling military goods outside of U.S.\" (Marcoux and Brewster 2017). The SA government bought over $142 million worth of CA arms in 2016, which was almost 20 percent of all sales outside that year. Groups that care about people's rights were very worried when the LI government allowed a $15 billion sale of armored cars to SA country to go on, even though there are serious worries about how people who disagree in SA country are treated and its part in the YE war. A group of society groups, including AIC and CJPM, argue that the CA government should have stopped the sale, even though it is good for CA people's money (Russell 2016).\n\nBut, the arms business is not the only part of the CA economy in SA country. \"BO company\" has gotten two jobs in the growing transport market in SA country. In the first, the SA government is hoping to finish a new public transport job in the capital RI city in 2018. The new metro \"will be 178 km-long with six lines and 85 stops, including under the ground, above the ground and on the ground\" (Railway Technology n.d.). This new project is expected to \"make traffic better and reduce dirty air by cutting the number of cars on the city roads\" (Estimo Jr. 2014). According to \"BO company\" (2013), the company\n\nThey got a job to bring new train technology for a new metro line 3 in RI country. The job needs them to manage things, plan and design, and also deliver 47 two-car trains without a driver equipped with special train technology. The total cost of the job is a very big number in US money and in euro.\n\nUnlike in SA country, this metro line is planned to work together with 85 kilometers of fast bus transport, with \"all stations of the metro... working with the bus network\". \n\nThe second job in RI country is a one-rail train system for the new money area of the capital city. It is a six-station one-rail train system covering 3.6 kilometers in the King's Money Area, and their part of the deal is worth a big amount of money. When talking about the impact of the deal, they said: \"The new city area will be eco-friendly, no cars allowed in the capital city of the RI country\". Between the two jobs and the chance for more jobs in the future, they are making progress in a new market in RI country \u2014 a market that CA country is trying to win for some big CA companies. Even though building train stuff is different than selling weapons, both give the CA country more reason to stay friendly with the powerful king in RI country and stay quiet about people's rights. While little is known about any possible criticisms of the two projects within RI country, one well-known RI woman who fights for rights, mentioned the metro while criticizing the government:\n\nThe government is giving money to EG country, JO country, and TU country, and using a third of the country's budget for this year to pay for the metro. Meanwhile, people in RI country are paying most of their salary on rent, private schools, and private hospitals \u2014 because public ones aren't good \u2014 while salaries have practically stayed the same.\n\nThese comments show similarities to the SA country case in terms of what the government chooses to spend money on. However, more study is needed into the RI country situation and the impact of these projects on the ground.\n\nThey are also trying to get a train job with the EG country. The first news of a possible project came out in 2015, when EG's house minister announced: \"CA's company and EG's OC company and Arab Builders will build a very expensive one-rail train near CA city\". However, nothing more was announced about this project, and they do not currently list any projects in EG country. Recently, it was shared that \"A big company has a plan to build a new train line in a big city, a project that could cost a lot of money\" (S 2017). A person from the big company said that the company will \"spend the next half a year making a plan for the construction of the city's new train line\" (S 2017). This will be important to watch over the next months and years, as the city is split into areas for rich and poor people (S 1999; H and W 2002). This situation might be similar to another where a lot of money was used on a project to mostly help a certain group of people. Also, groups that help people say that the current government is not nice. HRW (HRW 2017) says: \"People can't say bad things about the government in this country... Many people were hurt and taken away in 2016.\" Similar to the situations in other places, people who have different opinions might not be heard, which makes it more important to understand the project and the big company's part in it.\n\nIn the end, it is important to keep watching the big company's actions in Africa in the next years. Many countries in Africa are starting big transportation projects, and there is a chance for the big company to grow there. In addition to a project in SO city, the company has given technology for several train systems across Africa, including in E country, Z country, M country, and A country (B 2014a). Future projects in Africa need careful watching to see patterns and to understand the impact of these projects on the people and politics in each place.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nThe three situations in this book provide a serious look at the big company's actions in political spaces abroad. These are not simple business deals without political meaning but rather involve different forms of taking. Companies getting money, with the help and clear support of the state, in these projects abroad must be seen as a part of the taking and harm happening in each case. At the very least we need to think about what it means for a company to make money from these politically controversial projects. From there, we can start to think about how to be accountable and fair.\n\nWhen thinking about being accountable, we often look at one of the many rules or ethics that supposedly guide the behavior of companies. The big company's Code of Ethics and Business Conduct talks about its main values, including doing the right thing: \"We behave with integrity and in an ethical manner in everything we do and say\" (B n.d.e). The big company also looks to the UN Global Compact, which it joined in 2007, for guidance on how to behave. The Compact is \"a call to companies to play nicely with people, workers, nature, and to be honest, and do things that help society\" (UN Global Compact n.d.). CA country is also part of the group called OE group, which works on making the world economy better. The OE group has made rules for big companies in member countries to follow \"good business behavior in a global way, following laws and internationally accepted standards\" (OE group n.d.). There are lots of rules and guidelines for companies to follow when doing business, but the problem is that these are not mandatory. Other than having to follow the laws of the country they are in, there is no strong way to make companies behave in any particular way. Moreover, other than very bad behavior or breaking local laws, there is very little in the rules that would tell a company like B company about the problems described in each of the three cases. And even if there were, without a strong way to enforce the rules, the rules have no power.\n\nSome might suggest we ask the CA country government to make and enforce more meaningful rules of conduct for CA country companies abroad. The closest we have come to achieving this was Bill C-300: A Law About Corporate Behavior for Mining, Oil or Gas Activities in Developing Countries. This was a private bill that was voted on in the House in 2010, and it specifically proposed to hold several CA country government agencies accountable in relation to extractive industries. The bill proposed that state agencies would stop supporting a CA country company found to be involved in human rights or environmental abuses overseas. Although the bill was ultimately not passed in the House, it did bring many of these issues to the public's attention. While C-300 focused specifically on the extractive industry, civil society and foreign officials viewed it as \"a starting point for more comprehensive reforms\" (Keenan 2013: 116) to directly regulate overseas corporate operations. Despite these positive aspects of the bill's introduction no further legislation on the matter has arisen since its defeat.\n\nIn general, we cannot count on companies or the CA country government to take meaningful action on their own to deal with problems of corporate behavior overseas, and the mainstream media tends not to cover the actions of CA country companies very closely, with the exception of investigating and reporting on high-profile allegations of corruption in the B case. Companies and governments must be pressured to act, and the burden of this work typically falls on civil society actors both at home and abroad. Indeed, the fact that the CA country government was even debating corporate conduct in the extractive industries and Bill C-300 was the result of years of hard work by a lot of non-governmental organizations, independent media, and social movements to build relationships with affected communities abroad, investigate and collect information regarding corporate abuse, disseminate information to the public in CA country, and pressure government to act. Organizations such as MiningWatch CA country, Breaking the Silence, Mining Injustice Solidarity Network, the Mining Justice Alliance, and the CA country Network of Corporate Accountability were essential in shining light on harmful extractive processes both within CA country and abroad, and also educating CA country people on our involvement in this harm. In the case of a big company like 'BO company' (and others), getting people to speak out will be the best chance to make sure these companies are doing the right things and helping the communities they are in. People speaking out against the country 'IS country' is an example of how people all over the world can make companies and countries listen to them. This is a good way to make companies like 'BO company', and even the CA country government, listen. People speaking out is very important to make companies like 'BO company' do the right thing.\n\nIn the long term, we need to think of different ways to do things than just trying to make as much money as possible. This is a problem with the way things work now: we let private companies make things that are important because their main goal is to make money, not to help people and the earth. In other words, even if 'BO company' and other companies start to do better, many of the problems will not just go away. For example, in the case of 'IS country'/'PA country', a GE country transport company stopped working on a big rail project. Because the company is owned by the GE country government, it might have been easier for the GE country people to make sure they were doing the right thing than in the case of private companies like 'BO company'.\n\nBut thinking of different ways to do things will need more than just changing how we think about money. A scholar named Leanne (2017: 72-73) says that we might find new ideas in the ways Indigenous peoples think:\n\nIndigenous peoples have very good ways of not just thinking about money in our histories and today. I think it is important that we keep doing the work of our older family members in thinking about money, how it makes people lose things, and how it affects us from our own points of view. Indigenous peoples, in my mind, know more about not just thinking about money and how that system works than any group of people on the earth. We have thousands and thousands of years of experience building and living in societies outside of global money thinking. We have hundreds of years of direct experience with the bad things that money thinking can do. We have seen its bad effects on our lands and our animal and plant friends.\n\nBecause the cases in this book are about losing land and fighting back, Leanne's ideas help us understand the importance of listening to those who have been most affected by losing things - and seeing new possibilities for making the world a better place in the future.\n\nIt is my hope that this book helps people understand the effects of these big projects on local people, and how we might be part of the problem. With this story, I hope children in CA country will learn to ask questions about what our leaders and big companies do. These actions can sometimes cause problems and hurt others. \n\nREFERENCES\n\nDelphine talked about how CA country deals with mining.
