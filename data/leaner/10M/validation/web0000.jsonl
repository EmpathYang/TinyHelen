Among the bad things they did, one was sharing a picture of a big place known as BAC country, with a word that means wanting to be free.\n\nWith all the strange news in this country, many people may not have been surprised. First, there were talks about a new rule that could make people pay a lot of money if they protested on the streets without permission. And they could also be fined if they lost their important cards more than three times in five years.\n\nThere was also news that a man in charge of the country wanted to give a big award to the Virgin Mary. This award is usually given to brave officers who have been hurt or lost their lives while doing their job. Some people started calling the man's office a \"place of prayer\" and even asked for a similar award for a superhero named Spiderman.\n\nIt looks like the Virgin Mary was not able to keep an eye on Twitter, so the officers had to step in. They even named their mission \"Operation Spider\". It seems like it's about doing wrong and getting punished, or not getting punished at all.\nLet's talk about some messages that people share on the internet about things that scare them. \n\nIn one message, a person was upset because the government in his country called a group of people \"bad guys\" for doing harmful things. But, he said, every day big companies do bad things and nothing happens to them. He thinks the government should do something about this. \n\nIn his country, many people were losing their homes because they couldn't pay money to the banks. This was making some people very sad and they were hurting themselves. He wondered why it was wrong to talk about this.\n\nPeople were being treated unfairly because they shared pictures or ideas from famous thinkers. For example, some people shared ideas from a smart man named Antonio, and they got in trouble. But other people who shared ideas that were not nice did not get in trouble.\n\nHowever, some of these messages were not nice, and talked badly about people who were hurt by the \"bad guys\". But, as a smart man named Noam has said before, these \"bad guys\" didn't just appear out of nowhere. They were created because they were treated badly and not treated fairly.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "51215def81c82de379d474ecc336251e5f8900c988122fdccae378656cdf2f31"}

{"text": "Yummy Bread\nThe PH roll is fluffy, rich, and very yummy.\nBy Thomas | Shared a long time ago\nChef Thomas's fluffy, yummy dinner rolls might be the best we've ever eaten. The secret? A sweet syrup, a thick liquid sweetener that adds a bit of a special flavor. Want to know how to make Thomas's PH Rolls? \n\nFor many of us, there's a certain smell that we associate with the start of the day. It might be the nice smell of our first cup of juice, the smell of a parking lot, or the clean smell of a lobby. When I walk through the doors of my restaurant in NE city, it's yeast that I smell. Buttery, sweet, and welcoming, the scent of 500 baking PH rolls-the number we serve in a single night--hits me like a wave. (Each guest typically eats an average of three of the yummy rolls, given for free, during the course of a dinner.) Starting early in the day, the aroma floats from the kitchen through the dining room and bar, tempting the cooks, the servers, the friends stopping in with their deliveries, and, of course, me.\nI think the yummy, soft, and richly tasting Parker House roll is the best among all breads. I found out how to make it by chance.\nJust like in many homes, at my old restaurant in a big city, we always have Parker House rolls for Thanksgiving. We used to get them from a great nearby bakery, but one year we were too late to order and had to make the rolls ourselves. We baked them in groups of six in small rectangular metal pans (that's what we had, but a round eight-inch pan is also good). Then, we took them to the dining room, still warm from the oven, with their tops shining with melted butter and sprinkled with special salt. Our rolls were very well-liked, leaving only a few crumbs in the pans. People really loved them. Now, not only do we have them for Thanksgiving at my restaurant; we also start every meal with Parker House rolls at many of my restaurants in different places.\nParker House rolls, which are bread made with milk, first showed up in the mid-1870s at a restaurant inside a hotel. A long time ago, a baking recipe became very popular when it was shared in a special cookbook written by a lady named Mary. This recipe is still used today, and is loved by many people. In fact, some bakeries still use this old recipe to make their bread rolls.\n\nThese bread rolls are very similar to the ones from the old recipe. The bakers use a special ingredient called yeast to help the bread rise. They also add a sweet syrup made from a plant called barley to make the bread taste even better.\n\nThe best part about these bread rolls is when you first break them open. They have a crispy outside and a soft, fluffy inside filled with tiny air bubbles. To make sure the bread stays fluffy, it's important not to handle the dough too much. If you mix or knead the dough too much, it can make the bread tough instead of fluffy. So, it's best to only mix the dough until it starts to come away from the sides of the bowl.\nMaking bread at home can be tricky because you have to wait for the dough to puff up three times before baking it. In big kitchens, they use a special box that keeps the same warmth and wetness to help the dough puff up faster. At home, you can put the dough in a cool oven with a pan of water or a wet pizza stone. The wet air helps the dough puff up.\n\nOne kind of bread called Parker House rolls is usually made into a round or oval shape and then folded like a taco. But I like to make them into balls and bake six at a time in a cast-iron dish. The cast iron makes the outside of the rolls nice and crusty, and baking them together keeps the bread soft. The cast iron also keeps the rolls hot during a meal. But, if your family likes bread as much as mine, the rolls will be eaten up quickly!\n\nYou can try my Parker House Rolls recipe. It has a special ingredient: barley malt. This gives the rolls a sweet, tasty flavor.\n\nThere is a Cookbook Club where people try out recipes and talk about them online.\n\nAlso, you might want to know about the best knives to use in the kitchen, as suggested by our Test Kitchen.\nCut, split, and make your food smaller with these special knives. \nThe Best Cooking Knife for Every Kind of Little Chef\nAfter cutting lots of carrots, tomatoes, and green leaves, we found 10 that we liked the most.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "a5bf5af85c94c6805ed5d4939e3a29609fb02860cacfe0bc41d3423ceff10444"}

The story was about a man who was the last one to come from a faraway place as a worker who wasn't free. Now, this story will be shared on TV as a short series.\n\nThen, Samuel wrote about Benjamin again. This time, Benjamin was going to be in a show about a brave man. This show was based on a book that had already been turned into a movie.\n\nIn another story, Samuel wrote about Sophia and Benjamin talking about how some people treat them differently because of their skin color. They talked about this for a long time on a show.\n\nFinally, Samuel wrote about Matthew's mom, who wrote a book about Matthew's life. She shared the story to remember Matthew and his role in their community's history.\nThis year, a big music event celebrated some awesome girls who are great at making music. Special performances were given by three fantastic girls, including Queen Latifah, Lil Kim and Eve.\n\nTwo singers, Stephanie and Shanice, sang a beautiful song called 'Home'. The song is very famous because Stephanie first sang it in a well-known play.\n\nThere was a special day for a famous music album. This album was made by two talented guys when duos were very popular in the music world.\n\nA singer named Common stood up for his song when people didn't like it. A university didn't let him give a speech because some people were upset, but he still said he liked his song.\n\nPeople on the internet were not happy with Common's ideas about how to make things better. But Common said to everyone, 'I love you, let's make things better.' He is not just a singer, but also acts in movies about important times in history.\nJack and Cameron made a special song for a movie. They used their music to say something important. Later, Kevin and Cameron worked with a big group in a city to make jobs for young people. They said this would help 20,000 young people get work. Then, Cameron sang for workers in a part of the country.

Adam, who was 33 years old, was helping sick people in MO city. When he felt he was getting sick, Adam stayed away from others. Adam, who was the head doctor for the helper group's sick care center in MO city, has been in the country for some time.\n\n\"When the sickness came, he started helping with our direct care for the sick, but he was helping in a hospital in LI country before he started working with sick patients,\" said a lady from the group.\nA very bad sickness called Ebola spread in a place called WA country. It was the worst spread of this sickness ever seen. Many people got sick and many did not survive. This started four months ago, and many people were found to have this sickness. \n\nSome people were tested and found to have Ebola. Sadly, a lot of these people did not survive. Out of all the people who were thought to have this sickness, many did not survive. \n\nPeople were also worried that this sickness would spread to a big country in Africa with a lot of people, called NI country. A man from a place called LI country got sick with Ebola in NE city and did not survive. NE city is the biggest city in NI country and has more than 20 million people. The man got to the city and was found to be sick at the city's airport. He was then taken to a hospital.

This sickness, called E, is very bad and can make a lot of people very sick. But if people get help early, they can get better.\n\nThis sickness E comes from a jungle close to a big city in the WG country. The city has many people. Because people may not know they are sick at first, they can travel and make others sick too. After people get this sickness, they can get very sick and sometimes they cannot get better. \n\nThe sickness E doesn't spread until people start to feel sick. When they have a fever or headache or feel very tired, that's when others can catch it from them. \n\nPeople who help the sick, like David, can get this sickness easily because they are close to the sick people.

{"text": "Once, there was a talk about where the mouth of a river is. Some people wanted to use something called a maritime baseline, which is a way to decide where the sea starts. But others didn't think it was a good idea, because you can't see it with your own eyes. They also didn't think it was fair to say that a place like NE city had no seaside, but a place nearby did. They also talked about how we sometimes use shapes to show places in the sea that aren't clear, like bays and straits. Why do we let some things happen in one place, but not in another? Some people say that a certain thing you mentioned is not okay and has never been okay. They believe that some things in OSM are there even though they are not supposed to be. For example, I talked about the RS sea and how it's hard to know where it ends and the GA sea begins. \nWhile things are still being figured out, I've not added anything, even though I really want to. This is because I want to be able to name things on big paper maps that only show part of the bigger areas, and don't show any small things near their middle points. Without having areas in the database, it's hard to know how to name incomplete features. Having a separate place to keep the 'not allowed' multipolygon relations is tricky, because for similar reasons, anything in OSM that looks like a 'foreign key' and lets OSM objects be associated with an outside database is also not liked very much. \nWhen I say 'hard-liner', I do not mean to be mean. I just don't agree with them.\nSome people have very strict rules about what should be included on a map. They believe only clear, definite things should be marked and they want everything to have clear boundaries. People don't seem to mind including the names of features on a map. But, it's not sure if these strict rule-followers would want to leave out the name of a mountain peak, for example, if there wasn't a sign with its name. They definitely wouldn't want to use another map to find the name. They might not even want to ask people who live nearby what the name is because it's not their own knowledge. It's not sure how someone could learn the name of a place without someone else telling them. The only time this wouldn't be true is if the person making the map is the one who named the place. But, most people agree that we don't want people who make maps to start naming things however they want.

Then, there's a scary movie about a wedding night called 'Ready or Not'. It's a little bit different than most wedding nights. Another story is about a movie where four girls are told not to be eaten by a shark. It's called '47 Meters Down: Uncaged'. In another movie, a boy named Peter needs a break.

Nathan has worked at the newspaper for almost four years, covering stories in LP Town, EC County, and about leaders making rules. The newspaper was his first job after finishing school.\n\nTaking Nathan's place at the newspaper will be Chris, who used to be the News Director at a radio station. Chris will still work with North Country Radio. At the newspaper, he'll be covering LP Town, NE Town, and EC County, including stories about leaders making rules.\n\nChris was born and raised in SL Town and started his career in news at the sports department of the same newspaper. After finishing school, he covered stories for another newspaper. Chris later worked as an editor at a weekly newspaper in VT County. After that, he was the news editor at a publishing company and then worked at a radio station. When another person named Chris left the radio station to join the newspaper, Chris became the news director.\nBig changes have been happening in our local news teams. For instance, a man named Adam left his job at the AP Park Visitor Centers in JU month of a year not long ago. He went on to become the Assistant Managing Editor at a big publishing house. Another man, Jon, who used to work for the publishing house and a radio station, now reports news for NW county at the GF Post-Star.\n\nThe radio station is going through changes, according to their website. A man named Bob, who is the News Director at another radio station in MA city, has been helping out. He gives updates about the news and helps cover football games in SL Town. The radio station is trying to find a new News Director. In the meantime, a man named Josh comes in every morning to make sure the news is ready to go on the air. A man named George, who works on his own, also helps out with the radio station's regional report.\n\nI'm excited to tell you that a local news reporter and radio news director named Chris is joining us here. Chris grew up in SL Town and started his career reporting sports news for the local newspaper. He went to SL University and finished his studies in 2006. He learned a lot about writing and religious studies. Then he reported news for MT newspaper. After that, Chris moved to VT state and became the editor at the VT Times Sentinel, a weekly newspaper that people all over CC County read. Once, a man named David worked as a news helper at a big company. After a while, he became the news boss when his friend, also named David, moved to another job at a different company. Now, David shares stories about a place called the AD region. Sometimes, he also helps out at the NC Radio and writes for other places too.\n\nIf you think you've heard the name David before, you're right! David's dad, Don, used to tell stories about paddling in the AD region.\n\nThere was also a big event where 64 people were picked, but not everyone got chosen. Some of the ones who didn't get picked were not happy. But they said, \"We'll try again next time!\"\n\nNow, let's go back to learning more about the third and fourth groups of the big event.\nAdam and Cameron are Changing their Jobs\nTwo friends, Adam and Cameron, are going to stop doing their jobs. Adam used to work at the VS center. But one day, he sent a message to everyone saying he won't be working there anymore after June 25. He didn't say why he was leaving. He also used to write a weekly story called \"Adirondack Attic,\" but he won't be doing that either.\nCameron, another friend from the same town, is also leaving his job at MC. He used to be a host of a radio program called \"Talk of the Town.\" Cameron told everyone during \"The Morning News\" that he will leave MC soon. He started working there in 2001, just two days before a big event in NE city. The boss of MC, Ted, said they will miss Cameron. \"From the day he began, Cameron quickly became known as one of the top storytellers in our area,\" Morgan shared. \"People who listen to Cameron often tell me that his storytelling is so true to the real event, it feels like they were there. His careful storytelling and love for his work is what has made Cameron and our whole team well-known for sharing good and truthful stories.\"\nWhile Cameron was in charge of the news at the radio station, the morning news show grew from two hours to three. This gave Cameron the chance to share stories with more people in the FR country, from OF town to WI town. Now, the morning news show happens from early in the morning until mid-morning on weekdays on the radio station and the cable channel 2.\nThe town's talk, a well-known part of the morning news, did really well under Cameron. He made the show longer and helped create serious discussions about big topics in our town in a nice way.\n\"Cameron was able to make the show even better, by making the discussions longer, changing the Regional Report, and making the show more valuable to our listeners,\" Morgan shared. \"Cameron was really good at what he did. We have a great team who share news and stories. We make sure to keep doing shows like \"Chat of the Town\" and share news that is important to everyone around us. \nBesides \"The Morning News,\" Cameron also did \"The K & J Show,\" which was like the show we have now called \"Our Country Today.\" For the last few years, Cameron worked with David to do \"Control Alt Delete,\" a show with different kinds of music that you can listen to on ROCK105 every Thursday night. \nCameron loved being outside. He made a special show about the 46 tall mountains in the AD area. You can still watch this show online. \nCameron also helped make a special promise for the radio station. The promise was to work as a team to make fun and helpful radio shows for everyone to enjoy. The shows also help people learn new things and make life better in the places we live. \nCameron also did special shows to help raise money for important causes like the High Peaks Hospice and First Night SL Lake. \nAssistant News Director Adam will take over for Cameron in July. He said that working with Cameron was very special. \"He is definitely the best teammate I've ever worked with,\" Adam said. \"His hard work and promise to give the best news is truly special. He leaves behind a very important job - and I promise to do my best to continue his great work.\"\nA Friend in Far-off FR Country\nby MT\nOur town has a friend in a far-off country that used to be part of a big group of countries. This is happening while the country's problems with another country are very big and people are trying to make the president leave.\nJack, who worked here for three years as a news person, left in February to travel and meet new people across Europe and Asia, bringing gifts of sweet candy from our town.\nHe has traveled to many different places. \"I've started to really like places that are a bit different,\" he writes on his blog.\nWith local students helping him understand the language, Jack is giving news in this far-off country.

{"text": "At a place called ST school, many students often use a channel named ST on their computers to reach different kinds of learning resources. These resources are very helpful when you want to learn something new, even when you are not at school. \n\nRecently, the big library at ST school started working with a popular search website. Now, the same learning resources from ST can also be found on this search website. So, when you are at ST school and search for something on this website, you will see a special link that can take you to the full text.\n\nYou don't have to do anything extra. Just type what you want to learn in the search box, hit the search button and if what you are looking for is available, you will see a special link that takes you directly to it.\n\nIn another part of ST school, there is a department that handles important documents. They have a questionnaire that every person who wants to become a judge has to fill out. For example, a lady named Sonia filled out one of these questionnaires. All the decisions she made as a judge, the awards she got, and the groups she was part of, are all in this document. There are also written versions of many speeches she gave from a long time ago until just a few months ago. Our friend Jack is moving to a different place in our big school building. We are also getting ready to welcome a new friend, David. Even though Jack is not leaving us completely, we will miss him a lot. Now, let's remember all the good things Jack did for our school.\n\nJack was a very important person in our school since a sunny summer day in 2003. Before he came to our school, he worked at many other schools in different parts of the country. Jack knows a lot about how to solve problems and how to be fair. He worked in a big building in the FR country where people solve problems and he was part of a big team that makes rules about problem-solving. \n\nUnder Jack's leadership, our school started new learning programs and he emphasized how important it is to help others without expecting anything in return. Jack also wrote many books and articles. Some of these books and articles, along with pictures and other special things, are on display in our school until the leaves start to fall.\nJack will not be the head teacher after this summer, but he will still teach us full time. We will miss him being our leader, but we know he will still help our school and all of us kids. We hope he enjoys his new role!\n\nIn our school library, we have new information about a very important judge named Sophia. You can find lots of things she has written and other things about her. We will keep adding more things about her over time.

{"text": "In a place called DL city, there's a special trip for those who love coffee. Imagine smelling a wonderful, full cup of coffee called K's coffee. When you taste it, it's not too strong, but just right, with a hint of sweet caramel and nutty almond. It's different from the super strong coffee you find everywhere else. This coffee is smooth and makes you feel good all over.\n\nWelcome to the K's Coffee Farm and Roastery, where they make amazing coffee every day. The farm is run by a hard-working family, and they grow a special kind of coffee plant that was brought to this place many years ago. They also have workshops where you can learn how to make coffee the traditional way. You'll have to do some work, but you'll also get to drink lots of coffee and learn something new.\n\nDo you know where the first coffee trees in VN country came from? They're in a lovely garden cafe at K's Coffee Farm, surrounded by the sound of coffee trees. These trees have a long history that goes back to a long time ago. The FR country people were the first to bring coffee seeds to VN from Africa. Later, in a place not too far from DL city, they started a resort town and asked the local K' people to take care of their coffee trees.\nA group of people called the K'Ho were the first to grow coffee in the VN country. The K'Ho lived in faraway highland areas and enjoyed a rich life filled with crafting, stories, and music. A long time ago, they started growing plants in the rich soil around a big mountain. By the time of the early 20th century, they became the first coffee growers in the country. \n\nSometime in the 20th century, a K'Ho farmer named Benjamin found some special coffee seeds and planted them in his family's farm at the bottom of the mountain. Benjamin's family took care of these plants, but it took many years for his great-grandchild, Rachel, to turn it into a real business. With help from her family and her husband, a farming expert from the US country, Rachel started a coffee business in 2012. This business grows, roasts, and sells coffee that comes directly from those special seeds.\n\nWhen you visit the K'ho farm in BV village, the first thing you'll see is how simple and old-fashioned it is. They dry the coffee seeds outside their store. Inside, you can find lots of colorful clothes, fun crafts, and bags full of sweet-smelling beans. There's a small wooden house in the backyard where they make strong coffee. You can drink your coffee while looking at the beautiful farms on the big mountain.\n\nThis is a family business run by a girl named Rachel and her brother, David. They work together with 50 families from their community. These families grow, clean, and sell special coffee. They only use good ways of farming that don't harm our planet. By doing all the work themselves, these families can earn more money and they help to keep our planet healthy.\n\nThis is a new way to do an old job, and their coffee is very good. Their coffee always gets high scores when people taste it. If you want to learn how to make the best cup of coffee, you just need to spend a morning at the farm.\n\nThere are many steps to make their coffee. After a quick look at the farm, you can walk between the coffee trees to see the coffee berries. You can learn about different types of coffee and see how they farm in a good way. Later, someone will show you each step of making coffee, using the same methods they have used for years.\nMaking coffee is a fun process! At a place like KH farm, they use three different ways to make coffee: washed, natural, and honey. People pick the coffee by hand and get it ready at the same place. After it sits for up to 20 days, they use a wooden tool to remove the outer layer. The next challenge is picking out the seeds, which needs careful eyes and hands. Only the best seeds will go to the next fun steps of roasting, grinding and tasting.\n\nDuring this fun time, the KH guide will share little fun facts and make you understand the process better. The best part comes at the end when you get to make and taste your own coffee. You can enjoy your coffee in the beautiful garden under the warm spring sun. Knowing that your coffee is made in a good way and helps local farmers makes it taste even better. And it's so yummy! You might want to take some bags home with you.\n\nA short day spent at the KH farm costs a little bit, but it includes lunch. You can visit the gift shop and garden from morning to afternoon, from Monday to Saturday.

{"text": "Cloud City Idea\nPeople with a lot of money want to make a special city. This city would be different because it would not have shared things like parks or schools. This idea comes from a group of people who don't like paying taxes or having rules from the government. They believe these things stop them from doing their best work.\n\nThey have many plans for their special city. One plan is to move many people who think the same way to a place called NE state. Here, they want to make the state their special city without leaving the big country. Another plan is to live on a big boat that stays in the middle of the sea. This idea is liked by many different people. Some people like it because they don't want to pay taxes. Other people like it because they want to make a city that is good for nature.\n\nA man who studies history once described the idea like this: It's like two very smart men talking about a big party on a big boat in the sea.\nThere's a big idea to make cities into things we can buy and sell, not by changing things on the inside, but by changing how they look on the outside. Some people who have a lot of money want to act like they're heroes. They think about making cities on the sea, or on land, if they can find a place that's free. But when they do this, these cities often end up looking like special places where people can make a lot of money with little rules. These places might also have fewer taxes. This idea is being used in a project in a place far away. On their website, they call it a platform for economic development. This might mean it's a little bit like a place where people from different places can trade things, and a little bit like a place where things are made, but it's all made to look very nice and modern.\nThere is a plan for a new city. This city is not real yet, but there are some ideas about how it will work. The city will have a group of leaders and private helpers to keep the city safe. If people in the city have problems, they will go to a special place to solve them. The city will be part of a place called the HO country for now, and people living there will need to become citizens of HO country. Even though the city is trying to be free and different, it still has to follow the rules of the HO country. The city is also supported by its partners and some very rich people.\n\nThe city is being talked about as a good thing. The people who are helping to start it are happy about it. They want to create cities that are like new businesses, where the city is the product. But they also worry about the problems in today's world. They think that when systems don't work right, people suffer a lot. Some people have jobs that don't pay much and are unsafe. Kids aren't learning, grown-ups can't find good doctors, and people can't start their own companies to help their families. A person named Patrick thinks the problem is that people aren't dreaming big enough. He thinks we should build new and better cities to make a better future for everyone. \n\nA man named David, who works for a company that Patrick helps, writes things on a blog. He writes about how hard times can make us better, how important it is to mix old ideas and new technology, and why we should always be looking for new things. \n\nSome people might not take these ideas seriously if it weren't for the people who are helping Patrick. These include big names like Matthew, Ryan, Benjamin, Thomas, and most importantly Peter, who gave most of the money to Patrick's project. Even though $9 million may not seem like a lot compared to other companies, the fact that these important people are supporting Patrick makes us stop and think.\n\nPatrick's goal is to make new cities from scratch that people can buy and own. This is a big change from the way people usually think about making the world a better place. Instead of trying to make small changes from inside, Patrick wants to create a whole new world from the outside. Some people dream big and want to make the world a better place. They think they can make a brand-new city from nothing, just like in a game. Here's how they plan to do it:\n- First, get a group of people together online\n- Next, have everyone work from their computers\n- Make rules that are easy to understand\n- Be polite and nice to each other\n- Imagine the city's buildings in a computer game\n- Then, raise money to get a real place\n- Finally, build the city in the real world\nThey believe that if they do this right, they can make a perfect city. This city will have good jobs, good rules, and nice people. Plus, it will look just like the one they imagined in their game.\nPeople are talking a lot about things like friendship and being nice to others. This is a big change, because usually people just think about themselves. But it's hard to think that these talks about friendship will actually make a real group of friends. What people want to do is not make a real group of friends, but make something on the computer that looks like a group of friends. They want to make a perfect place, but it's not a real place. It's like a beautiful city that doesn't have a hill. \n\nSamuel writes that a group of friends can be made online. But even though he talks about a new society, all he really wants to do is make a fancy chat room with some cool features and a group of very excited users who come together because they all feel the same. He writes, \"We make the start of the state as a project everyone can work on, we make our inside economy around work from far away, we teach being nice to each other, we pretend to build buildings in VR, and we make art and stories that show what we believe in.\"\n\nWhat people want to do is not make a real group of friends, but make something on the computer that looks like a group of friends. \n\nFor Samuel's online societies, the goal is not to have a real place or to be a real country. This is what makes it attractive. Since it's all online, there's no need to worry about the things that a real group of people or a real country would need, like shared things and buildings. Imagine a place that doesn't exist in reality, but only in the sky. In this sky place, there are no houses, parks, or factories. There are no people living there. It's like a game where everyone pretends to be in charge.\n\nWhen a man named Samuel talks about creating this sky place, it sounds almost true. He can say this because he uses special tools that make things like \"society\" seem real. These tools, like pretend money and pretend agreements, let people treat relationships like they are things you can touch. They make the people in the sky place follow lots of rules. This means even though they aren't in a real place, they still can't do whatever they want.\n\nBut this makes us wonder: If this sky place is for sale, who would want to buy it? Who is this \"we\" Samuel talks about? Would anyone really want to live there? There is a group of people who believe in the idea of leaving instead of staying and fixing things. This idea is very important to them. In simple words, someone who might want to join a new city would be a person who likes the freedom to leave a group they don't agree with, instead of staying and trying to make it better. They want to have the choice to leave. This is the main reason behind these new city ideas.\n\nRight now, there are many things that help rich people who can move around easily. For example, there are websites that rank cities all over the world and let users move to cities with better weather, less rules for businesses, better internet, and lower cost of living. The wish to \"choose with our actions\" can be seen more clearly when big tech people moved from NE city because of high taxes and many social issues to a city in TE state and MI city, where things are cheaper, no state tax, and a helpful mayor named Francis. But what if things change in MI city?\n\nThese \"smart\" things, controlling how people of the cloud city interact, tie them closer to a big system of rules and transactions. They may have left the state, but they have not gone beyond it.\n\nThe first and most important thing for a successful startup city will be to make sure this group of tech workers who move around a lot stay and invest their money in the city. And even more important, they need to keep it there by continuing to support the city of MI. Imagine a city being like a toy or a game. The person who runs it might have trouble keeping people happy and making sure everything works. This could be because the city is trying to do too many things at once. The people living there might keep moving around a lot, or the technology might get old fast. The city might even get copied by others. A city that acts like a toy might not make people feel like they belong. Instead, it might make people feel like they're just visiting.\n\nRight now, this is just an idea. But it shows how real cities are feeling like they need to act more like businesses. They're trying to be the best at giving people a certain kind of life. They might focus on arts or technology, and try to do it all while spending as little as possible. They might not want people to complain about things. Even though it's hard to say, every city is like a toy or a game. This is true for all parts of the city, not just the pretty parts. The only difference is whether the city wants to admit it.\n\nSome cities, like a place in FR country, are still tied to the land they're on, which is changing because of things like the sea level going up. These cities still have people who care about different things and don't just want to make money off of new businesses. Adam and Patrick have a big idea. They want to change the way we think about places where people live, like towns or states. They think these places shouldn't need to have a certain number of people or be in a certain spot. Their biggest idea is to make these places more like businesses that don't need to worry about everyone.\n\nThis is how new town ideas can be worth a lot of money. If a town is like a business, it can focus on making money more than anything else. It doesn't have to worry about things that make everyone happy or safe. If you try to make a real town with roads, parks, and other things we need, it could cost a lot of money. So, their idea is not to make a real town, but an idea of a town that never really happens.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "3d6d93fadad874cf8db784306110600e674c49e30724da238a206d81cf93335a"}

{"text": "HELP FOR ANIMAL DOCTORS TO TRACK MEDICINE USE ON FARMS\nAnimal doctors can get help to get a new computer program that makes it easier to record medicine use on farms all over the NE country. A special project in NE country has made a computer program to compare medicine use. The group that looks after animals and meat in NE country will pay for the computer program in animal doctor offices all over NE country for a whole year. This program can also be used to record medicine use for a special program that makes sure beef and lamb farms are good quality, so animal doctors don't have to fill out a paper form anymore.\n\nShowing that medicines are used in the right way is very important for making food. A big problem for animal doctors and farmers is getting correct information about the medicines bought and used on farms. But, the cow, sheep and milk industry needs to listen to what its customers want. The comparing tool made with the special project and a farm doctor system is a web platform that is easy to use. It collects and watches medicine use at the farm. The tool takes data from animal doctor offices, and turns it into a report in a few easy steps. This saves a lot of time compared to making reports by hand. There's a helpful tool that gives important information to people who take care of animals on big farms. This information can help them keep their animals healthy and use less medicine. A man named Cameron says his group is happy to help pay for this tool. He says it's a good chance to help people take better care of their animals and use less medicine. He also says the tool is easy to use and doesn't need much information. Another man, Gabriel, says the tool can help people watch how much medicine they use for their animals. He is happy to help make this tool for everyone. He says this will be good for the people who take care of the animals, the animals themselves, and everyone else. This tool will help people make good choices and work together better.\n\nThe money to pay for this tool will be given to animal doctors in the NE country for one year. This money will be used to set up the software. If you want to use a special tool, you can talk to the company 'FR Systems' directly. They can help set it up for you. This tool is part of a big project that involves many people and groups. They all work together to make things better for animals. \n\nThere are some people you can talk to if you want to know more.

They have already started building parts of the system in a place called TO city.\n\"Something very big and exciting is happening, with people from all over the world joining in,\" Mr. Gabriel said.\n\"We at the special project team are here not just to use places, but to make them better and help them grow.\"\nEveryone in the team believes theirs will be the first special project for everyone to use.\nA special vehicle and a short test road are expected to start in the TO city later this year. This comes after the reveal of the goods center and idea place in the CO city in the BR country, a long plane ride away from the RE city.\nThe city's special project school will bring jobs and learning to a place in the MI region that needs more development.\n\"I have the most fun job with the special project team because I can create and think without limits,\" said Yara, an astronaut from the AM country who joined the special project team.\n\"While creating connections with the school to bring the best minds and skills, we can come up with ideas and solutions for local and worldwide changes in how we move around.\n\"This will bring more visitors, learning, care for nature, and lasting goodness.\"\nIn the late 20th century, Yara decided to be the health officer for a space mission to test a space vehicle, and is now using what she knows to help develop the special project all over the world.\n\"There is a lot to gain from growth and learning, so the school is very important for helping young minds grow,\" she said.\n\"Sometimes it feels like the future is racing to catch up with us. Technology is changing things, especially the way young people think about what's coming next.\"\nWe still have some work to do before people can zoom around in special tunnels at really fast speeds in the AE city. But the clever people at the place where they make these things are sure they can make it happen.\n\"Making new things that can be used in BR country and everywhere else is what we do at the place where smart people come up with new ideas,\" said Mr Adam.\n\"It's important for the people in AE city to know that we want to share this new thing with everyone - with TO city, BE city and AE city. That's where we'll all learn about it together.\"\nThe space people at the place where they build rockets and the people in RJ city who work on moving things around are all involved.\nThe people in AE city had to tell the UN that they would keep themselves safe after bad things happened. Bad people were trying to hurt as many people as they could in AE city, the messenger said.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "0feacc17c8d6f3f3bd6c76ea30513263692a42b055270beda944ac06b9087fb8"}

{"text": "Kevin and Samuel were getting ready for a big event in the CA place. At first, there weren't many people around, but soon lots of people came to watch. They were going to have a competition, and both of them had been practicing a lot.\n\nKevin, who had been waiting for a long time for this day, weighed a little less than Samuel. Both of them looked ready and strong.\n\n\"I am here to win,\" Kevin said after he left the stage. \"This is my time.\" But Samuel's team and many people watching might not agree. Still, nobody said that Kevin didn't have a good chance to win that day.\n\nIn fact, Kevin felt he was going to win. He said Samuel was \"going to lose,\" on that day. \"It's going to be very exciting for the fans,\" he added. He really hoped it would be. Benjamin is very good at his job but not many people know him in the US. He could become very famous if he wins against Patrick, especially since this is a big match. A surprise win like that would make a lot of noise, not just in their field, but everywhere. \n\nBut Patrick doesn't think Benjamin will win the match. He seemed very happy and sure of himself. Benjamin looked serious, but Patrick was relaxed. While Benjamin talked big, Patrick was calm. \n\n\"He looks nervous,\" Patrick said about Benjamin, \"It's not too hot, is it?\" \n\nA man named Adam said that Benjamin thinks Patrick is too proud. Patrick didn't agree. He said he was not proud, just sure of himself. He reminded everyone that he's still the same great athlete who beat other players in the past.\n\n\"If someone tries to be better than me,\" Patrick said, \"they have a big challenge.\"\n\nPatrick also explained there's a difference between doing a good job and doing a job that gets people excited, which is what Benjamin was trying to do. \"Winning is the most important part,\" said Patrick, \"no matter how exciting you are.\" Patrick also shared his plans to do his best on Saturday night. \"I need to do really well,\" he said, \"because that's what I ask of myself.\" If Patrick does his best, it will be against his third tough opponent in a row.\n\nPatrick's choice of opponents is different from Benjamin's, and even from Adam's and Matthew's, who have had easier matches this year. A player who is getting better should always try to impress, and Patrick wants to keep impressing everyone.\n\nBut meeting tough competition is part of being a serious player. The competition on Saturday night might be a real challenge for Patrick. \"I'm ready to give my all,\" said Benjamin. \"I'm bringing it.\"\n\nIf Benjamin does, it might be the people watching who feel like the real winners on Saturday.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "249a2372993d27aabc12483f4be9a9340ce84af34654ecdbc37d84b824a36080"}
{"text": "Tech Trips\n6 Fun Online Visits to Science and Art Places\nBy a friend named Monica\nAs many things start to open again, some places are also welcoming people back. But fun places like museums may take a bit longer to open. So for now, we can visit our favorite learning places online.\nHere are some ideas for six of the coolest online visits to museums that are all about Science, Arts and Math. These online visits are fun for kids and grown-ups, too.\nTry these online visits and maybe you'll find a place you want to visit for real one day!\nNE city's Science and Art Place (NE city)\nBuilt for a big fair a long time ago, the original building of this museum is still standing. It has more than 400 fun things to do and see, all about Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math.\nOn their website, the museum has things like \"Learning about Current Events: Being Sick\" and lots of stuff for learning at home.\nThe learning stuff is sorted by how old you are (little kids, middle kids, and big kids). There are online books about how science helps us understand things, digital comics, and more than 10 video workshops you can do at home with your parents.\nI really like the do-it-yourself light toys, which can teach you a lot about how electricity works.\nThere are instructions in two languages, English and SP country, for most activities. \nThere is a special museum that talks about the work of a man named 'Nathan'. This museum is in a place called 'SE country'. This place is far away so not many children can visit it. But, they made a special online tour so everyone can see it. They also show you another place called 'TE center' in 'LO city'. (This is not the same as the electric cars named after 'Nathan'.)\nYou can take a look around the 'TE center' in a very fun way. It's like you're really there! You can click on anything in the room and you'll zoom right in to see it. It's the closest thing to magic we have!\nThe museum also shows a video every day and has many new things to see online. Some of these things can't be seen in the actual museum. The SE country's website can also be read in English.\nThere's also a museum in 'TE city' that's all about children. It's like a playground for your mind! This museum will start welcoming visitors again soon. But, they still share fun learning activities every day on some websites where people share pictures and videos.\nIf you want to have fun learning at any time, you could use the free resources that teach you how to make wind vanes or light bulbs out of pencil lead. Are you ready to go out and see all the cool things for yourself? Remember to follow the new rules for safety. If your child finds it hard to understand things like other kids, tell the helpers so everyone can have a fun and safe time.\n\nLet's go to AL's Star House (a place in CH city). Do you love learning about stars? AL's Star House can teach you all about them right on your computer or phone. They have a fun page with lots of ways to visit without leaving your home. You can read a blog, see virtual displays, and listen to a podcast.\n\nYou can also watch their short videos every week on YouTube. These videos are calm and fun to watch. They show you what the sky will look like and a voice tells you about the stars and shapes in the sky.\n\nAL's worked with a big company and made 12 online displays. You can learn about the Milky Way, women who talk about science, and a new display about a brave captain's 13 stories. These displays, just like the ones you see in real life, tell stories with words and pictures.\nMaybe you've seen the stars from where you live, but there's a place called AD building where you can learn more about them. You can also use a special app on your phone that shows you the night sky to make your learning even more fun.\n\nEX place (SF city)\nIn SF city, there's a place called EX where you can learn lots of things without actually going there. They have fun activities you can do at home and videos that teach you new things. There's so much to see and do.\n\nI think it's best to learn by subject. They have them all listed on the left side of the screen, so you can pick what you want to learn about. No matter how old you are or what you like, there's something for you.\n\nOne of the best parts is that many of the videos are like little bits of science you can snack on. They're short and teach you something new. If you want, you can even do more with them. I watched one about how to make a cloud inside a box and then I made my own at home.\n\nSN Museum (WA city)\nIf you ever go to WA city, you have to visit the SN Museum. It's one of the best places in the country to learn about flying and space. You don't even need to go there in person to learn from them. They have lots of free online resources that are even better than what you would see if you were there.\nOn a website, you can learn about cool things like how things are built, how planes fly, and all about space. You can even take pretend 3D tours of different kinds of planes and learn how to make a kite.\n\nLots of people are very excited about going to space again because of the work that big groups in our country are doing. A really big museum about air and space has a website that will keep kids busy for a long time.\n\nPretend Trip to Mars\nThis isn't a museum, but right now, a lot of people are really interested in going to space. After a successful space flight, this pretend trip might make future astronauts excited.\n\nA big company and a space group worked together to make a pretend trip to Mars. It's based on a 3D copy of a robot's recording of Mars. Until we can all go to Mars, this pretend visit is a really good way to make us think.\n\nThese pretend visits aren't the same as walking around and trying things out at a real museum. But, they let people explore from home in a way that's easy and doesn't cost a lot.\n\nA group of geek travel guides can't wait to start going places again - and these 5 museums that focus on learning are at the top of their list. But they also hope that pretend museum tours keep being available so that anyone with internet can see these great exhibits.\n\nKeep checking on GTG and sign up for our newsletter to get free weekly updates as fun parks, museums, and places for fun across the U.S. start to open again.\nOur story talks about a lady named Monica. She works with computers during the day and writes words at night. She does a lot of writing for her work. Her words have even been printed in a book! Monica loves to read books about far off places and magical creatures. She once got a book signed by a famous author, which she treasures a lot.\nShe also helps with events in a big city. She's very smart and loves learning about new things, especially about space and other planets. \n\nWe also have another lady named Dawn. She started her own company, which helps other people with their writing. She writes a lot about computers, houses, and money. Her work can be seen on big websites. Dawn has been an editor for over 20 years and has worked on many different magazines. She loves to play a fun sport called Paintball. Like Monica, she also loves to learn about new places and share her love for travel with others. She has a website where you can learn more about her.\nLook at these articles by a writer named David:\nWhy a Show on AP TV is not very Good\nNew Shows Coming to NF TV Soon\nMTech\nGreat Presents for People who Love Space\nA Special Day in December, 2020 by David\nAdam, a Space Company, and NA Organization Celebrate People in Space, Sent from our Country\nEnd of May, 2020 by David\nA Space Rocket Brings More Stars into Space\nEnd of April, 2020 by David\nCould a Space Rocket Become Like a NA Space Ship?\nMiddle of April, 2020 by TJ\nWhat is Happening in BC Place?\nMMusings\nTeaching Makers: The \"Long-lasting\" School Project\nEnd of March, 2020 by TJ", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "2b855daa7e326e4765f39793888952cb050b0a0d0561cf78a4b40ab2ba117295"}
{"text": "In a place called OC town, a woman named Alice and her little girl Zoe had a big scare. They had to leave their house because of a fire next door. Alice says her little girl is very upset because of what happened.\n\nAlice and Zoe had to move from their house because of damage from smoke and water. Alice could only watch as the fire from the house next door got bigger and bigger. \n\nFour big red fire trucks came to help on a Saturday. The people living in the house next door had to get out through a window upstairs. \n\nAlice and Zoe were woken up by a man who smelled smoke and took them outside. Alice told a newspaper: \"We were in bed when a man came to tell us he could smell smoke. We went outside and saw the house next door was on fire. There was lots of black smoke and it was growing fast. It was really scary. A little bit later, the windows of the house broke and the roof caught fire.\"\n\"Alice asked a family member to pick up her daughter, but the little girl saw many scary things. The girl was very scared and keeps asking if their house is on fire. She's very upset by what happened. Alice was told she couldn't go back to her house until it was safe. She could only go in with a fireman after the fire was out to get a few things. Their house was hurt a lot by smoke and water. The things holding the house together can be seen,\" said Alice. \"We will need new things because of the smell and damage. But, people in the town gave us clothes and bedding. They were very nice.\" The house is very hurt and the fire bosses are still trying to find out what caused the fire. Two kids and three grown-ups had to go to the hospital because they breathed in smoke. There was a scary fire in the OC town. People asked for clothes for a lady - Alice - and her three kids. A lady from the fire and rescue team said: \"Four fire trucks and the big ladder came to the fire. The first fire truck from CB town was told about the fire at 10:00 in the morning, was on the way to the fire by 10:02 and was there by 10:06.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "1b1fe443b67bb4260b18392bc0b2e76fe98dd7adfe5b0de2457f70ab04efaa0f"}
{"text": "A big rule about a special lady named Mary was announced by a very important person in the church, named Patrick, a long time ago. This rule says that when Mary finished living on Earth, she went straight to a wonderful place called heaven. The church didn't say whether Mary left Earth before or after she stopped being alive.\n\nAt a place called ME town, Mary told a person that she went to heaven before she stopped being alive. This happened a long time ago.\n\nA few years back, a hidden paper was found. This paper told a story about Patrick seeing a special thing called the \"sun miracle\" four times. Patrick believed this special thing was like a sign confirming his rule about Mary. This special paper was shown to people in a big place called VA city a while back.\n\nA person named Antonio shared this story back then. He said that Patrick, the person who announced the rule about Mary, claimed to have seen the \"sun miracle\" four times.\nA long time ago, a person in charge of a display found an old note from a very important person. This note was found in a family's collection of old things. The note talked about a special moment called the \"sun's miracle\". This is when the sun seemed to dance in the sky. This event is famous because it happened in a place called FR country, on a special day in 1917. Many people saw this because they were told a miracle would happen that day. The rain had stopped suddenly and everything became dry. \nThe note said that the important person saw this \"sun's miracle\" in the year he was planning to announce a very important rule. He was in the VA gardens at the time. He said he saw this special moment more than once. He thought of it as a sign of his plan to announce the rule. \nThe note also mentioned that he saw this special moment at 4.00pm on a day in 1950, while he was on his usual walk in the VA gardens. He was reading and studying near a statue when he saw something amazing that he had never seen before.\nOne day, a man named Patrick looked up at the sky. He saw the sun looking different, like a bright ball surrounded by a shiny ring. It wasn't hard to look at and there was a tiny cloud in front of it. Patrick wrote about how the bright ball seemed to move around a bit, but he could still see everything clearly inside it.\n\nPatrick saw this special sight on four different days. He tried to see it again at the same time other days, but it was too bright to look at. He told some of his friends about what he saw, and even a lady named Penelope who took care of his house said Patrick really believed what he saw was real.\n\nWhen Patrick was the boss, he approved of a special event in the FR country in the mid 20th century and dedicated the whole world to a very kind lady.\nPeople often see special things in the sky in the ME town. The leader of the big church in the town, named Patrick, got very sick and passed away. He was old and had been the leader since 2007, taking over from Isaac. People could say goodbye to Patrick at the church. Later, they had a big church service and then they buried him near the resting place of another man named Samuel.\n\nThe new leader of the church in the town is now Matthew. Matthew is not very old and he was born close to the town. He has been helping at the church since 2010. His new job was suggested by Isaac and agreed upon by a man named Robert who was also at Patrick's funeral. Matthew can speak three languages.\n\nA big church leader talked to the head of all the churches about the ME town.\nBig boss Ben met with leader Cameron to talk about looking into something important in a place called ME town, a person who writes news tells us. Cameron's group still has a few months of work left. Even though the people they're studying made a good impression, most people watching don't think the group will clearly be for or against.\n\nBig boss Ben gets Christmas wishes from leader Cameron. By the next Christmas, the report on ME town should be done, Cameron told Ben, who had asked him to talk about the issue on a certain day.\n\nCameron's group looking into ME town has a few months of work left. By the end of this year, the group led by Cameron will end their work with a statement to a big group and then to big boss Ben.\n\nEarly on that certain day, this plan was shared by Cameron when Ben invited him to talk about how the look-into was going, the seasoned news writer Andrew informs in a news source.\n\nLike others before him, Andrew also says that the people being studied, Ivan and Jack, met with the group earlier this week, and that all six people being studied have now met with the group.\n\n\"Right now, it's not possible to guess what the final decision will be. Some wise people made a good impression on the important group members. But right now, in the sacred buildings, people think the same thing will happen as it did a while back. In that year, the leaders from a faraway country didn't decide if something special was true or not, and they said they needed more time to think about it. Some people thought that meant the leaders didn't believe in the special thing, but really, the leaders just didn't say anything about it. \nThe people who saw something special talked to the important group in a big room where the group keeps its important papers. A leader named Benjamin talked about a special place. He said the town could be a wonderful place where special things happen, but he also warned the people living there not to make their town too busy and noisy. Benjamin was at a special ceremony in the town recently.\nThere are two paths for a village named ME village, said Benjamin, a local leader. He told the children that one path could make the village like a special city where everyone is kind and good. \"You can help make this village a place where everyone loves and understands each other, not because they are rich, but because they are good people. Listen to what Peter said: 'Be sorry for what you've done wrong... and you'll get a special gift from above,'\" said Benjamin in his talk.\n\nBenjamin and the village's helper, Patrick, were seen walking together on the day they were telling the children about being good. Benjamin has been the leader since the year he started in 1993. He's always told people to think carefully about what's happening in ME village. He even talked about a city named BA city where people tried to build a tall tower to reach the sky, but then they couldn't understand each other anymore.\n\nA woman named Victoria also came to the special gathering. There was a story about two different places. The first place was filled with confusion, people couldn't understand each other, and everything was broken. This place was not happy. The other place was different. It was filled with understanding, respect, and unity. Everyone's gifts were valued and it was a place of peace. A man named Benjamin compared these two places.\n\nBenjamin spoke to his friends, \"Friends, we have a choice. We can make our town like the first place, full of chaos and confusion, or like the second place, full of understanding and peace. If we choose to only want more money and don't care about each other, we will create chaos. But we can choose a different path.\"\n\nBenjamin had a lot of power in the town but there was a time when another man, called Patrick, had power. Patrick's power was taken away by a man named Cameron, who is very important now. Cameron didn't agree with Patrick's ideas about their town. Instead, he gave the decision to a group of people from their country.\nCameron speaks about a special group in ME town\nCameron talks about his journey to ME town. He says it's not normal to talk about this kind of trip, but because so many people were interested in it, he did talk about it in the big city and shared what he thought.\n\nIn a special talk with a news group, Cameron, the leader of VE city, talked more about ME town. He also talked about a special group created by the big leader.\n\nCameron said he thinks the special group made by the big leader to look at what's happening in ME town will do a very good job and make good decisions. He also said he believes they are being very careful and thoughtful about something that has made 30 million people visit and done a lot of good, but also has some things that are not clear yet.\n\nCameron will have his birthday soon.\n\nThe special group found real good things, no tricks\nBy Jack M.\nA big group of people at a very important place talked about some special happenings in a place called ME town. They found that these happenings are real and good things have happened because of them. There were no bad things found and the good things are still happening. \nThe group worked for four years and said that ME town is a good place. \nThe group also gave a report to a very important group of people. They said that some things are still happening in ME town, so they can't say everything about it yet. But they found out that there were no tricks or lies. \nThe group was started by a very important person named Benjamin four years ago. The report from the group also talks about the good things from ME town.\nThe big building where people go to pray and a man named Cameron were thankful because people were becoming more loving and kind. They saw this as a good thing. Some people didn't think that a certain report would change how the special praying place would be run. But, some smart people thought it might. \n\nThere was also an idea to move the special praying place to a different area. This idea first came up a long time ago, but some people thought it wasn't a good idea. They suggested maybe making the praying place even more special and having someone else run it.\n\nAt the end of a special meeting, a man named Patrick asked everyone to join him in saying nice things to the mom of a very special person, named Jesus. This was done in a big city a long time ago.\n\"In tough times, a lady called Mary is always there to help those who are looking for comfort and healing. Her picture can be found in many places, such as churches, small prayer rooms, and houses, which reminds people that she is always there to protect and care for them. In some parts of the PA region, she is highly respected and is known as the Helper of people who believe in God. The leaders of the church have also named her as the protector of the OC region, calling her the Lady of Peace.\n\nMary's son, Jesus, whom she carried before he was born, represents a new world where kindness and justice exist together, a world of freedom and peace. God brought peace to the world through Jesus' sacrifice and comeback to life. God has also made Jesus the leader of peace for all places and times. May Mary, the Queen of Peace, help the people of the OC region to understand this peace and share it with others. As we enter the new time of belief, may real justice and peace be God's gift to the OC region and all the countries in the world!\"\n\nPrayer to the Lady of Peace\nOh Mary, Helper of believers,\nin our need we turn to you\nwith loving eyes, with empty hands\nand hopeful hearts.\nWe look to you so that we may see your Son,\nour Lord.\nWe lift our hands so that\nwe may have the Bread of Life.\nWe open our hearts wide\nto welcome the leader of Peace.\nMother of the Church,\nKids all around the world are saying thank you for the kind and truthful words that have been passed down from a long, long time ago. These words came from a heart that was once empty but is now full of goodness, ready to welcome good words to share with everyone so that everyone can become better.\n\nThrough you, we learn about a world that is full of kindness, peace, love, and fairness. This world is created from the deep meaning of the good words that have been shared. All the kids around the world join you in saying good things about him who has been kind and fair for a long, long time.\n\nO, bright star, light of all the big seas and boss of the deep, show the way to the people of OC country across all dark and scary seas, so they can find a safe and bright place. This place is prepared by him who calmed the sea. Keep all your children safe because the waves are big and we are far from home.\n\nAs we travel across the big seas of the world, and cross the dry lands of our time, show us, O Mary, your child, for without your child we are lost. Pray that we will never lose our way in life, that in our hearts and minds, in what we say and do, in hard days and in quiet days, we will always look to Christ and say, \"Who is this that even wind and sea listen to him?\"\n\nOur Lady of Peace, who makes all storms quiet, pray at the start of the new age\nThere was a special place called OC country. There, people always showed love and respect to each other. They believed in being good and kind, just like their friend, Jesus. They wanted everyone in OC country to feel happy and peaceful. They knew that being good and kind was the best way to live life.\n\nSometimes, they would ask their special friends for help. They would say, \"Help us to be good and kind. Guide us so we don't get lost. Keep us peaceful.\" They believed these special friends could hear their wishes. They made these wishes in a big city called RO city.\n\nOne day, a man named Ivan had a talk with another man named Isaac. Isaac used to be the leader of a place in OC country. Ivan wrote down everything they talked about. But then, some people said things that were not true about OC country. They said that Isaac had said things he did not say. This made Ivan and Isaac very sad. Thomas was told off by a big group of important people for not following the rules and saying things that were not true. Because he used to work in a place called ME town, people started to wonder if the special events that were supposed to have happened there were actually real.\n\nWhat does Ivan, a big leader from HE town and the old boss of ME town, have to say about this?\n\nIvan: I am surprised by these ideas, which I think are mean and not true. Everyone knows that the big group of important people is watching the events in ME town very closely and hasn't made their final decision yet. This big group is not trying to settle scores with anyone, especially not ME town.\n\nBut what about Thomas, who was told off? Doesn't this prove to people who doubt that the special events in ME town were just made up by the people from HE town?\n\nIt's not true that the special events in ME town were made up by the people from HE town. Anyone who really wants to know the truth and tries to find out about the start of the events in ME town, will easily see that the people from HE town who were working in ME town at that time, were very careful about these events.\nA reporter named Isaac asked if Victor was the one who made up the visions. What is the truth about what Thomas did in the ME town?\nThis idea is not true. It is known and can be shown that Thomas was not in the ME town in June 1981, when the first visions happened, as the six kids told. He didn't even know the kids. He went to the ME town because his leaders told him to in September 1981, after Jack was taken away. He worked in the town for less than 4 years, in 1985, he was moved to the VI town, and in 1988, he went to the IT country.\nWas Thomas the guide of the vision-seers? Did he pretend, even to the Big Leader, to be the one who \"leads the vision-seers\" because God wanted it?\nThis big house never picked or named anyone as the guide of the vision-seers. I think that none of the town leaders of the ME town ever had the job to guide them. The truth is that some of the Franciscans were listening to some of the vision-seers; they were, and still are friends with them and their families. Who is friends with who or who guides who, you have to ask the vision-seers. Nowadays, some thinkers say they don't agree with this type of leadership. Is the trouble that Mr. Thomas is facing related to what he did in ME town? Mr. Ryan, the leader of MO town, thinks it might be. \n\nAs far as I can tell from what I've read, Mr. Thomas has not been in trouble because of his past work in ME town, or because of the special things that happened there, or because of what he thinks about those special things. When he moved away from ME town, the leader did not stop him from doing any of his tasks! I don't understand why this would have anything to do with what he did in ME town or with the special things that happened there, and even less why this would mean that the big church in VA city doesn't like ME town.\n\nWhat does the HF group think about Mr. Thomas's situation? In 1992, he officially became part of the IT country group in AB place, where he lives and works. This means that since then, the HF group can't know what he's doing or working on. According to our group's rules, he doesn't have to tell the HF group about what he's doing, and he hasn't done so. A man works for a big group and a local team from the place where he lives. No one has ever told me about his work in IT country. There's talk about a new team that will look into something very interesting. Do you know about this? People are talking more and more about this new team that will look into this interesting thing, but our local office hasn't gotten any letters about it. Will this team work under the boss's watch? Has anyone been chosen to be on it yet? From what I've heard, it's supposed to be a team with people from all over the world, chosen by the big group. As the leader of our local team, and as someone who used to take care of a special place, I can say that we're ready to work with any team chosen by the big group. Since the start, this special place has been taken care of by people who were chosen by the local group. The people who work there want everything to follow the rules of the big group. This special place is not a plan made by one person or a small group, but a wonderful gift for all the people living today.\nWhat's happening in the special place?\nIn the special place called ME town, there's nothing hidden. Anyone, whether they believe or not, can come and see what's going on. Many people from all over the world come to this place. It's a very famous place where many people come to look for something special.\nLetters from a special person about ME town\nIn 2005, a book was published with letters between Adam and Zoe and a very important person who was no longer with us. These letters were in Adam's book about the important person, which was published in 2005.\nHere are some letters from the book:\n+ Dear friends!\nI want to thank Adam and Zoe for their letter. I also thank you for the good wishes. I wish you all the same. I hope that our special lady of the Bright Hill will help me on my journey in June. I ask you to pray for me. I always remember to pray for Father Andrew B. A very special well-wish goes to Madison on her big day of receiving her First Holy Communion. I also wish for a safe and smooth journey from the ME place to the RO city.\n\nWith all my heart,\nJack\n\nFrom the VA city, last day of March in the late 20th century\n(penned by hand)\nMay the peace and joy of Christ fill your hearts.\nHurray!\n\nWith blessings,\nJack, the Pope\n\nHello Mr. Matthew,\n\n\"...And every day, we return to the ME place in our thoughts.\" \n\nOn a winter day in the late 20th century (this note was penned by the Pope himself):\n\n\"Hello Mr. and Mrs. S,\n\n\"...I thank Mrs. Zoe for all the news about the ME place. I, too, visit there every day in my prayers: I join my prayers with all those who pray there or feel a call to prayer from there. Today, we understand this call better. I am happy that our time is not lacking people who pray and spread goodwill...\" \n\n\"Thank you very much for both of your letters. Mrs. Zoe has been telling me about the BA place. I think the ME place is better understood these days. This kind of \"urging\" from our Mother is better understood today when we see the big danger with our own eyes. People all over the world said a special prayer. This made us feel that good things will happen. We can have peace. That was the message on a special day of prayer. Mr. T. was there too.\n\nBecause of this, people are starting to think right again. This includes people in the PL country. Your writing shows that they are thinking right too. Maybe they will understand better now. They did not hear about \"winning\" but about doing the right thing.\n\nBlessings,\n(From: Kids' Stories)", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "c5dda133d2f5278974b376186f1c721cbef2ab1b1c9537034aab312278a7e52b"}
{"text": "We're going to talk about volcanoes. Did you know there are usually 20 volcanoes erupting somewhere in the world every day? There are so many, we can't talk about them all. \n\nFor example, there's a big volcano in AK state that sometimes sends ash into the air. This can make things difficult for airplanes. A few years ago, a volcano in IC country sent up a big cloud of ash that stopped more than 100,000 flights. That's a lot of people who had to change their plans!\n\nThere's also a volcano in HA state, where people love to live even though there's a chance the volcano could erupt. Last week, a house was covered by lava from the volcano. \n\nFinally, there's a volcano in SM country that's been spitting out hot ash and gravel. That's pretty amazing, isn't it? In a place like the JP country, PH country, and especially the IN country, people live close to active volcanoes. This can be a bit scary because these volcanoes might erupt. Many people around the world live in places where a volcano might erupt.\n\nOne of the big volcanoes in JP country erupted, and people were really surprised. Some people even got hurt. People are trying to figure out why this happened and why there were people near the volcano when it erupted.\n\nSome people wonder if there is something like a \"volcano season,\" because it seems like lots of volcanoes have been erupting recently. This has happened in places like IS country, HI land, IN country, and ME country. Some other places like PH country and PG country also had volcanoes that erupted not too long ago.\n\nIn IC country, a big volcano called \"BA volcano\" erupted. This reminds people of another time when a volcano erupted and caused lots of problems for airplanes in Europe and North AM city. David, a volcano expert, was paying close attention to a volcano in IC country. He thought it might erupt, which would be a big problem for airplane pilots. But then a volcano in PG country made the news instead!\n\nIn IS country, they're also watching another volcano. There were lots of little earthquakes, which might mean the volcano is going to erupt. They're taking it very seriously.\n\nIn ET country, scientists are studying their own volcanoes. They're about to start a big five-year project to learn more about them. \n\nIn the CA region, there's an island that's had a lot of trouble with volcanoes. But they're using the volcano's power to help themselves. A long time ago, a big storm called Hugo hit an island. It caused a lot of damage. Almost all of the island's buildings were ruined. \n\nPeople are very interested in volcanoes. They are very hot and can be scary, but they also show us how our planet works. Long ago, there were even bigger volcanoes!\n\nScientists have found three new volcanoes in AU country. They are really excited to learn more about them.\n\nThere's also a volcano in Antarctica, under the ice. It's even hotter than people thought!\n\nOn a far away planet called Mars, there are big valleys. Some people thought water made them, but now scientists think they were made by lava, which is what comes out of a volcano.\nA big mountain named as Sarychev, in RU country, burst out with a big bang. This was seen from a space station. You can discover a lot about such big mountains by watching these big bangs. The more we know about these big bangs, the more we can help people when these mountains burst out suddenly. There are many of such mountains...\n\nAnother mountain named as Mount Tambora, in IN country, had the biggest bang in history. This changed the 19th century a lot. A big fight named as Battle of Waterloo is known to many, but who knows about the mountain called Tambora? No school book talks about this big bang that happened just before a big defeat in a fight in BE country...\n\nShaking ground could tell us about the mountain's big bang. Shaking ground can warn us before these mountains burst out, according to new studies. Researchers have found...\n\nThese big mountains can help living things survive in cold places. For example, in the AN country, the big mountains help to keep life going. Once, AN country was covered in green, warm forests, where different plants and animals including big dinosaurs lived. Long, long ago, the land we now call the \"AN land\" was very different. Today, this land is covered almost entirely by snow.\n\nDid you know that volcanoes can change the weather? Since the year 2000, volcanoes have made Earth a little cooler. A man named Benjamin and his friends discovered this.\n\nThere are many people who study volcanoes and the Earth. Among them are professors, researchers, and lecturers. For example, there's Henry who is a professor, Robin who is a researcher, David who is a lecturer, and many others. They all work at different schools and universities, studying the mysteries of our planet.\nPatrick, a teacher who loves studying places and people, works at a bright and sunny school. Juliet, who enjoys learning about our Earth, teaches at a big school. Luca, who likes exploring how the Earth moves, teaches at a big school too. They shared their ideas a while back.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "ffd75a562d7ccd1385cb477acfced73567fbd5d8a380a0628a99d1583ac342b2"}

There are a lot of people buried in the cemetery, some we know their names, some we don't.

{"text": "This is a story about a man named Victor who was thinking about how people could live together peacefully. One day, a man named Howard shared a big idea. He said, \"What if we had two homes for two groups of people? One home could be for one group, with safe boundaries and their own flag. The other home could be for the other group, also with their own flag and their own plans for the future.\"\n\nThis idea was similar to what another man, Benjamin, had said before at a big school. Benjamin had shared his dream of peace, where two groups of people could live side by side in a small place, each with their own flag, song, and leaders. He said that one group shouldn't harm the other.\n\nBenjamin said that it was important for everyone to understand who the other group was. He also thought that the area where the second group lived should be peaceful and safe for everyone. \n\nBenjamin had other thoughts about how everything should be arranged, and everyone knew what those were. He felt that everyone needed safe boundaries and that the big city should stay united and be a place where everyone could practice their own beliefs freely.\nBenjamin made a big oopsie. People who didn't like him got mad because he stopped saying no to a new country for the Palestinians. People who were his friends didn't believe him. He didn't get anything good from Oliver, and people stopped believing he didn't like giving stuff to the PLO. The worst part was that the Americans and the PLO kept what he said, so it was hard for him or any other leader from IS country to change it. From that time, anyone could say \"IS country says yes to a PA country country.\"\n\nThe big problem is that the idea of \"two countries\" is really confusing. Everyone can think it means something different, even totally opposite things.\n\nBenjamin's idea of PA city would be a small country that couldn't have an army, control its own sky, borders, phone calls, or the JV area. It wouldn't be allowed to bring in weapons or make friends with other countries' armies. The PLO would have to say that IS country is the country of the Jewish people (but they probably would never do that).\n\nSome people in IS country say \"two countries for two people,\" which means they should recognize each other. In this idea, after IS country leaves some or all of JS and makes an Arab country, \"PA city\" would say it's okay for the Jewish people to have the remaining part of IS country. Two groups of people couldn't agree on who should live where. One group wanted a place of their own, without any people from the other group. This place would include all the big areas, except for some tiny spots. This group also wanted to be totally in charge of their place. Next to this, there would be another place where people from both groups could live. The people from the first group did not believe the second group was a real group of people, but just had a different way of thinking. This second place would also welcome anyone from the first group who wanted to come live there.\n\nSadly, these two ideas didn't fit together. Some people said that the leader of the first group was okay with the idea of \"two places for two groups.\" But in truth, he never said anything about two groups when he talked about \"two places.\" When this leader spoke recently, he hinted that anyone from his group should be able to go live in the second place.\nSomething nice would be if people stopped talking about the \"two-state solution,\" a term that has lost its meaning. In a time long ago, a man we'll call Benjamin might have been asked to use this phrase by the leader of a big country. But what about a group that likes the country we'll call IS? This group is worried because a survey showed that less support for IS is coming from one group of people. They are trying hard to get them back. On the same day that a man we'll call Adam talked, the leader of the group, a man we'll call Mort, said: \n\nTo my friends who think about things in a new way, I want you to know that we are working together on this. Your story about IS is just as good and important as the one told by people who don't like change. \n\nBut there are big things trying to pull you away from this place and this group and we cannot let that happen. We will not let that happen.\n\nThe group hoped to avoid fights from other groups by using a smart way of doing politics. By using some of the ideas of the people who don't agree with them, they hope to bring them closer, while the people who already support them will stay.\n\nBut this might not be a good plan because the new thinkers in one group of people don't agree with the group's main goal, which is to support IS. It's not that they believe, like some people in IS do, that changing the situation will bring peace, or that their idea of IS will be more fair, or that dividing the land of IS again will stop a big problem. Some people don't like a country called IS. They don't want to be friends with a group named AI anymore. This is true for some people who belong to a special group. They used to feel a connection with their own people, but now they feel a connection with other people who are not treated fairly, including a group called the Ps. \n\nIn my opinion, the best thing for AI to do now is to strongly support IS. The people who don't agree with them have already left, and this might make AI work better.\n\nThis is a thought about peace, a special group of people, IS and another group called PA. \n\nThere are many groups in AM country where people used to strongly support IS. But things change, and now it's different. Some people control everything there. They care more about being asked to a special garden for tea, shaking hands with a person named C, or trying to please people who don't like the special group. They have been friends since a long time ago, when new people came to the country. They were given a place to stay, food, a little money and were told how to vote many times with different names and looks.\nHere's a list of news and information sources:\n- News about different countries\n- Reports on a war that happened a while ago\n- Learning resources about an important idea\n- Timeline of an important idea\n- News from the BE company\n- Breaking news from the BR website\n- News from the CA country\n- Daily news alert\n- News from the DS city\n- Information center about intelligence and safety\n- News from the JP company\n- News service with the initials JT\n- News from the MN company\n- Network for news about a country named PA\n- Media from the SD city\n- Weekly news from the JW city\n- Daily news from around the world\n- Mission to protect birds\n- End to a something called BDS\n- Center named GL\n- Group named IT\n- Legal rights in a country named IS\n- Monitor of non-profit organizations\n- Facts about a country named PA\n- Territory that is very busy\n- Group protecting national lands named RE\n- Magazine named T\n- Organization about an important idea in the country AM", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "fc93fdccc0aea33b84e7e7bed0d2d0d8c021be049f3d92610eafa86a9195639d"}

But the best gift was what it did for Yara's mom and dad. Sometimes, special people would come and talk about important things.

{"text": "Miss Madison wrote a book about learning in different countries. She wanted to make it easier to understand the research done in this area. Madison, a researcher at the Big School, wrote this book with her friend, Benjamin.\n\nShe said, \"We wrote this book because we noticed that the research done about learning in different countries was a bit messy and all over the place. We thought that if we made a plan to organize this research, it would be easier for people to understand what has been studied, what hasn't been studied, and how different studies are connected.\"\n\nIn their book, Madison and Benjamin looked at important research done in the last few years. They focused on three big topics: students traveling to study in different countries, learning about the world, and comparing education in different countries.\n\nThey made a plan for these three topics, and talked about the questions that researchers ask and the problems they face. Some people have trouble finding information to help them learn new things. A person named Wendy says we can make learning better by comparing different kinds of information and trying new ways to understand it.\n\nWendy thinks it's really important to compare students who have studied in different countries to students who haven't, to see what they each learn. Some people think that when you study in a different country, you learn new skills and become more confident. But we're not sure if this is true because we haven't compared enough students.\n\nWendy wants to find out if studying in a different country changes students in any way. She says we need more information to understand this better.\n\nIt's important to know what the good parts of studying in different countries are because Wendy and others are trying to make studying easier for more students. This is especially important for students who go to local schools. Wendy says that by understanding which parts of studying in different countries need to get better, we can make the experience better for students and teachers. This would help people work together to solve big problems all over the world.\n\nWendy also said that the sickness that's spreading around the world shows us how connected we all are. It shows us that it's important to work together and understand each other. Big problems in the world need everyone to work together. We can't solve them all by ourselves. \n\nHere are three things we learned about studying at universities all over the world:\n\n1. We need to share information about studying at universities. Right now, we only know a lot about one place at a time. But we should know about many places to understand what is happening everywhere.\n\n2. We can learn more if we compare different things. We can look at different places or different times. This will help us understand what is special or different about each thing we are studying. \n\n3. We should use different ways to study. Some ways use numbers, and some ways use words. Both ways are good and can help us understand better.\n\nYou can find more information on this topic if you keep reading.\nHere we learn about a place where people study how to help community schools. They look at things teachers have written, learn about schools around the world, and share news.

Their music is a loud and exciting kind of rock, filled with great guitar sounds and strong beats. They love the rock music from the past but also like to mix in some new styles. They look up to other big bands and also get some ideas from local bands. In a year after they started, they made their first big music album.

Their music reminds people of the great rock songs from the past and has a lot of different sounds and stories in it. This song and the words in it are a promise to life in all its ways. The songs talk about what the songwriter has seen and felt in his life. He sings about hard times, like losing someone he loves, in songs like \"Broken\", \"Help Me\", and \"Bright Light\". He sings about a family member who got very sick and went away forever in the song \"Final Tune\".

We made sure to include many different types of profiles so that students could be chosen based on what they like,\" he said. \"In addition to this, we looked closely at how money and business were changing all over the world.

{"text": "In this lesson, we will learn about the ways people help others to feel better when they are sad or scared. Two important helpers, let's call them Adam and Arnold, have different ways to help.\n\nAdam was a school helper who learned a lot about how our minds work. He found out how to help people by talking to them and helping them think in a more happy and positive way. He taught many other helpers to do the same. He also helped a lot of people who were very sad or had big problems in their lives. \n\nFor many years, Adam also studied how to help people who found it hard to understand what is real and what is not. He found a way to help them find their own goals and strengths, and many of them were able to live happier lives because of him.\n\nArnold, another school helper, also has his own way to help people. We will learn about his methods in the next part. A smart man named Adam from a place called PH city had a new idea. He tried it in PA state and people liked it. Now, other places like GE state, MA state, NJ state, and UT state are trying it too. Adam and his friends are also working with a man named Gabriel. They are helping people in 27 different places in the world.\n\nAdam has written a lot about his work. He wrote 24 big books and many other things. People say he is one of the most important doctors in history. He even got a special award in 2006 for helping people who have trouble with their feelings. In 2017, he got another big award for his life's work.\n\nAnother man, Arnold, also did important work. He was a big teacher at RU University. Arnold was part of many important groups and got a special award for his service in the world of psychology. A very smart man finished studying a long time ago at a big school in a faraway land. He wrote a lot of books and many, many papers about what he learned.

Some people agreed with it, but some people did not. For example, a big leader decided not to be part of it anymore.\n\nScientists who study the weather have found ways to keep our earth healthy. They suggest we could use less things that make dirty air. This won't hurt how we live too much, but it will help our earth a lot.\n\nOne scientist named Alice was chosen to help make our earth even better. She was chosen by a big leader in FR country.

{"text": "Why Don't We Use Water to Cool Things?\nCameron\nCameron is a smart person who likes to learn about new things all the time.\nWe can find water everywhere in the world. So, why don't we use it to cool stuff down? Instead, we use different things like a special kind of gas. To know why we use these things instead of water, we need to learn how cooling works. Also, we need to know what makes something good for cooling. Lastly, we need to think about if water is good or bad for cooling. Then we can decide if it's a good idea to use water for cooling or not.\nHow Cooling Works\nKnowing how cooling works can help us decide if we should use water to cool things down or not. So, how does a cooler work? It works by moving a cold liquid around the thing we want to cool, like your snacks in the cooler. This cold liquid takes heat away from the thing and cools it down. The cold liquid gets warmer though. So, we need to make the liquid cold again so it can keep taking heat away from the thing. This is how a cooler works. It needs to keep making the liquid cold so it can cool the thing down.\nA fridge works in four steps to keep your food cold. First, a special liquid inside the fridge takes in heat from the food and turns into a warm gas. Next, a part called the compressor squeezes this gas to make it hotter. Then, this hot gas meets the outside air and becomes a liquid again. Lastly, this liquid has to pass through a tiny place that makes it very cold and turns it back into a liquid. This cold liquid is ready to start the whole process over again!\n\nThe special liquid that helps the fridge work well has some important features. Let's look at what they are.\n\nOne important feature is that the liquid should not freeze easily. This is because, in the last step, the liquid becomes very cold. If it freezes, it won't be able to do its job properly. So, it's important that the liquid can stay liquid even when it gets very cold. In our story, a special invisible helper called \"Flowy\" helps to keep things cool. Flowy has to be very good at flowing through tiny paths without getting stuck, so things don't heat up.\n\nFlowy is also very special because it can change from a liquid to a gas when it gets warm. This is very important for Flowy to help keep things cool. If Flowy couldn't turn into a gas easily, it would be hard for it to do its job.\n\nFlowy also needs to be good at staying cool when it's working. If Flowy gets too warm, it takes a lot of energy to keep it cool and that can be costly. So, it's better for Flowy to stay cool and not get too hot.\n\nWhen Flowy turns into a gas, it can take away a lot of heat from the things it's trying to cool. This is really good, because the more heat Flowy can take away, the cooler the things become.\n\nFlowy should also be able to handle a lot of heat and pressure. This helps Flowy to transfer heat better and work more efficiently. If Flowy can't handle the heat and pressure, then it will need more energy to do its job, which is not good. If we have too much air in a cooling machine, it might get too big and heavy. But if we don't have enough air, some might escape. The right amount of air will make the machine work just right, and it won't be too big or too small. \n\nThe kind of air we use in the machine is also important. Some air is thick and heavy, and some air is light. If we use heavy air, we can use a smaller machine and smaller tubes. If the air doesn't take up a lot of space after it cools down, the tubes and machine can be small too.\n\nRemember, the air can change if we put more or less pressure on it. So, we can make the air work better for the machine by changing the pressure.\n\nThere are other things we want the air to do in the machine. It should not catch fire or explode. It should work well with the parts of the machine, like the oil, seals, and gaskets. We should be able to find a leak easily. It should be safe for our world. We should be able to find it and store it easily.\n\nWater can also be used in a cooling machine. But not everything that we use in the machine is perfect. Sometimes, we have to pick the best one even if it's not perfect. \n\nWater is a good choice because it's not expensive and we can find it easily. It's safe, it doesn't ruin things, and it's good for our world. Water is special because it can absorb a lot of heat when it changes from a liquid to a gas. But there are two main reasons why water is not good for keeping things cool. The first reason is that it needs a lot of heat to change from a liquid to a gas. The second reason is that it needs a lot of cold to change from a liquid to a solid. The temperatures needed to change water from a liquid to a gas or a solid are too different.\n\nWhen we want to use water to keep things cool, we need to change it into a gas. But to do this, we need a machine that can make the pressure very low. But making the pressure very low is hard and needs a big machine. And even if we had a big machine, it would use a lot of energy. So using water to keep things cool is not a good idea because it uses too much energy.\n\nBut there are some coolers that do use water to cool the air. These coolers work by changing water into a gas. But they don't need a machine to change the pressure, so they don't use too much energy. Cooling with water's special trait is how evaporative cooling works. There's a neat video that explains this. Some people have shared their thoughts on this topic. One from SI country said it was well explained from the basics. Another said they learned new facts and theories. A person from SO country found the explanation interesting even though they study living things, not science. Others thanked for the helpful information and well-organized explanation. Once, someone wondered why we don't use water, something we have a lot of, to keep things cool. This question was answered with a simple explanation about how we make things cold. \n\nA little while ago, a person from a far away country said thank you. They were happy because they learned something new. \n\nAnother person, let's call him Adam, from another place also learned something. He didn't know how we make things cold before. But after reading about it, and looking up some more information, he now understands it. He thinks the explanation was done very well. \n\nThe story also talked about how things in our bodies and our weather work.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "6ed86889c423ebfb616e83065802543011493e1541061d77219d9c9bf7387c42"}

Todd has won this race three times. He also won with a horse named Rachel and a horse named Patrick.\n\nThe horses that did well in this race had a break after the first big race. They didn't run in the second one. This happened with five of the last nine winners of this race.\n\nThomas was number six in the first big race with twenty horses. Todd thought Thomas did a good job in that race. \"We thought Thomas could win this race,\" said Todd. \"Training at this place helped.\"\n\nIsaac was number ten in the first big race.

He did well too, but not as good as Tapwrit. It was a sunny day and lots of people came to watch the race. Another horse, Patch, who only has one eye, came in third place.\nPatrick, who trained Tapwrit and Patch, was very happy because he also trained another horse that won a big race earlier in the year.\nHe said, \"Winning the first race was great. The last few weeks have been so exciting. We were very happy because we knew both horses were ready to run the long race.

Another racer from a different country was also not able to race because he wasn't feeling well. \nSo, it was anyone's race to win. And in the end, a racer named Thomas won. He did a great job in the long race. \n\"Thomas was doing a great job,\" said Patrick. \"He did everything we talked about before the race. We hoped he had enough strength when it was time to really race. It looked like another racer, Isaac, still had some energy, but at the last moment, Thomas tried really hard and won.\" \nIsaac, who didn't do well in another big race, tried to lead the race. But another racer, Mike, who had won lots of races earlier, pressured him. \n\"It wasn't our plan to lead the race,\" said Gabriel, who coaches Isaac. \"We hoped someone else would lead, but we had to change our plan.\"\nIn a big race, Thomas the horse was in third place behind Adam and Benjamin, the leading horses. When the final turn came, Thomas was asked to run faster. It took Thomas some time to run his fastest. In the meantime, Adam left Benjamin behind and it seemed like Adam would win.\n\nBut just then, Thomas began to run really fast. It was a close race between Thomas and Adam, but Thomas took the lead at the very end. Victor, Patrick, Liam, and others came after them.\n\nUnfortunately, Henry the horse had an accident. He bumped into the horse in front of him and his rider, Frank, almost fell off. Henry got a little cut on his leg, but the doctor said it will be fixed with some bandages.\n\nFrank said, \"The race was really tough at the beginning.

{"text": "In a part of NA country called BR area, there is a place known as WK region. This place is located in the south-east part of BR area, close to a very big road. The WK region is surrounded by beautiful places like SL lake, KL lake, and part of the AL valley that goes down to the border of another country.\n\nThis region has many cities, towns, and villages. One of them is called N city, which is known as \"the Queen City\" of the WK region. It is a very popular city because of its fun outdoor activities and its rich culture. \n\nAnother city is called C city, which is like a meeting point in the WK region. Most people who visit the WK region will likely pass through this city. \n\nLastly, there is a city called CR city, which is located at the south end of KL lake. This city is close to some of the best farming areas in this region.\nIn a beautiful mountain town called RO Town, known for its snowy hills and bicycle trails, people love to go skiing. \n\nThen there's TR City, a place where a big factory makes things from lead and zinc. \n\nA pair of places called AI Village and BA Town sit on the edge of KL Lake. They have hot water bubbling up from the ground and a very long ferry ride that you don't have to pay for. \n\nKA Village is a lovely place by KL Lake, between two big mountain ranges. It's home to a very old boat called the SS Boat. \n\nSA Village is in the middle of three other places: NE Town, CA City, and TR City. It's called \"the Hub of the KO\".\n\nNear AR Lakes, NA Town is a medium-sized place by a river. \n\nND Village is a little place by SL Lake, not far from KA Village. \n\nAt the south end of CL Lake, there's a place called CL Town, where the lake water is warm and trees line the shores.\nGR town is a small place near the border of another country. It's a good place to stop for food and gas on a main road. \nNext, there's a tiny place called GW city, also near the border. It's famous for being the smallest city in its country. \n\nLet's talk about some cool places to visit. \nFirst, there's KG Park. It's in an area surrounded by roads that connect three towns. There's a campground near a popular part of the park at KL Lake. You can find a cabin a few hours walk from the GL trailhead. In the summer, you can walk there, but in the winter, you have to take a helicopter because it's popular for snow skiing.\n\nNext, we have CV Park. This is a wetland near CR town. It's mostly marshland and is very important to birds around the world. \n\nThen, there's SP Park. This is a place where mountain caribou live. \n\nFinally, there's SY Park. It has a rocky beach and you can do fun things like boating, camping, and hiking. \n\nOverall, the WK area is a bit harder to get to and travel around than some more crowded parts of the province. People who live in this place like it because it's quiet and peaceful. The roads are twisty, so you need to drive slowly. When there are lots of visitors, the locals don't like it because they drive too fast and make a lot of noise. Visitors should slow down and enjoy the beautiful things this place has to offer. People here don't like the busy city life brought by the visitors who are always in a hurry.\n\nThis area is not the same as the land between GE city and CR city. That's a different place. It's also beautiful, but it's not the same.\n\nSometimes, you might hear people say \"KT time.\" That means they'll do things when they are ready, not in a hurry. Some shops might not open exactly on time. That's okay. Don't worry, it's usually not a big problem.\n\nThere are lots of FS roads. These are roads made for forest work. You can see them everywhere because they are marked with brown signs. These roads are the only way to get to the deep parts of the forest. Some of these roads are very rough and steep, so you need a strong car to drive on them. Sometimes, you might see a car with a color you don't like. You might also see big trucks carrying lots of logs, or people who are not happy. It's easy to lose your way or get stuck, so you have to be careful.\nYou can travel south from a big city to a smaller town. You can also take a road from one place to another.\nThere are airports where planes can fly in and out. One airport is big, but sometimes planes can't fly because of fog, especially in winter. Another airport has fewer planes, but it's not often affected by fog.\nSmall planes can also land in other places.\nThere's a bus service that goes along a highway near the bottom part of a big area. The buses stop in many places, including big cities and small towns. There are two bus rides every week going to and from the city of CA. The bus stops at many places like OK town, HR town, CL town, LE city, FM town, PC town, SP town, FE city, CR city, CO town, SA town, NE city, and BA town. There is also a bus ride once a week.\nThe bus company is called \"SC Bus Company\", and you can ask them questions at s@travels.com. They have bus rides on many days of the week going from TR city to KE city. The bus stops at NE city, CA city, CL town, GF city, GR city, MI city, and RC town.\n\nThe best way to travel around KO is in your own car. There are not many buses in this place. You might not find a ride easily, especially when it's late or not tourist season. In the summer, many people like to ride their motorcycles here. Some people might like to ride their bikes here too, but remember, the hills can be tough to climb.\n\nThere are also some local buses you can use:\n* The BG bus system in GF city and GR city. You need to call them to book a ride.\n* The WK bus system in BA town, CA city, NE city, RO city, SL city, and TR city. This bus also goes to KA town, NA city, ND city, and SA town sometimes.\nBoats are used to travel from one place to another across rivers and lakes. These boats are called ferries and they carry people and cars. The government makes sure these ferries run smoothly. They work all year round, but sometimes during Spring, some ferries can't run because the rivers are too wild. You don't have to pay to use these ferries. Here are some of them:\n\nThere's a ferry that goes from one side of a lake to the other. It works every day and helps people and cars get across the lake. It's near a big road and not too far from a town. The ferry ride only takes about 5 minutes and it runs whenever people need it.\n\nAnother ferry crosses a big river every day. It's also near a big road and not too far from another town. This ride is even shorter, only about 3 minutes, and it also runs whenever people need it.\n\nThere's also a ferry that works all the time, day and night. It helps people and cars get across another big river. It's near a big road and a bit further from the town. This ride also takes about 5 minutes and it runs whenever people need it.\n\nLastly, there is a ferry that travels across a big lake. It's a bit further away from the town. This ferry helps people and cars get from one side of the lake to the other. Every day, as the sun is rising, a big boat begins its journey across the large lake in the FR country. This big boat is special because it doesn't need any money to ride! It's the longest ride like this in the whole world! It helps people get across the lake and it takes about 35 minutes. During the summer, the boat goes back and forth more often. \n\nIn the same country, there's another boat that goes across a smaller lake. It starts its journey early in the morning and finishes late at night. You can also ask for a ride anytime during the night. This boat ride is very quick, only 5 minutes! The boat goes back and forth every 30 minutes. \n\nThere's also a third boat that goes across another large lake. This lake is between two big hills in the FR country. Every day, a boat starts to sail early in the morning from SB Bay to GB Bay and the last trip is around the middle of the day. This boat helps people travel across a big lake. The trip takes about 20 minutes and a boat leaves every hour. This was last updated in the later part of the year.\n\nThere is a famous old street in NE city. This place is known for its very pretty views. Many towns in this area have special things to see.\n\nNE city is the biggest town in this place. It's known for being a great place for art and has lots of artists. CG city has a special art show every year where you can see hundreds of artworks.\n\nIn SM town, you can see a very big coin and a very old phone booth made from a tree from TL area. Every year in the first week of August, SM town hosts a big music festival.\n\nKL town has an old boat for people to see. It's the oldest boat of its kind that can still carry passengers.\n\nThere's a special place in ND city that tells the story of many people from JA city who had to move here during a big war.\n\nRM city has a museum where you can take a tour of an old gold mine that stopped working a long time ago.\nThe PR river is just a little way behind the SM dam. The WK area is a great place to visit, and the longer you stay, the more fun things you find to do. Not only can you visit parks, towns, and ski hills, but there are also lots of trails in the wild areas. To start exploring, a trails book can be helpful. But, talking to the people who live there and visiting again and again can lead you to some really amazing places. To reach many of these places, you might need a vehicle that can handle rough roads, and good maps to find your way.\n\nThe CV wildlife area is a protected place that has been made into a home for animals and birds. The SP park, which is west of C town, is really important because it protects the home of endangered mountain caribou. \n\nAt AL in NW town, there is a large sandy beach. It protects important DF forests and is one of the last examples of grassland ecosystems in the K area.\n\nNear T town, there are many trails for walking and riding bikes around VL and CL park area. \n\nThe NS hot springs have two pools filled with water from natural mineral springs. The springs are set in the forest a little way from the pools.\nIn the WK area, you can find food that is more than just regular quick eats. Many towns in this area have places where you can get really tasty food. These places don't all serve the same kind of food, but many of them offer options for those who eat everything and those who only eat veggies. They also try to use food that is grown nearby, and some have special dishes that you can't find anywhere else.\nThis area is also home to a lot of places that make their own drink. So, if you are visiting, you should try some of their special drinks.\nThey don't make a lot of grape juice here, though, because it's not hot enough and the dirt isn't right for growing grapes like it is in the OK area. There are two places where they make yummy grape juice in this area: CG Vineyard near TR town and SV Vineyard in CR town. \n\nWhen you're going on a trip in WK, you don't need to worry about bad things happening. The people here are nice and helpful. But, it's good to be careful because the roads are twisty and sometimes rocks can fall on them. In winter, snow can slide down the mountains. There are also animals like big, scary bears and fast, big cats. If you go far into the woods, you need to be ready for wild things. Sometimes, the weather can change fast in the mountains, and it can be hard to walk because it's very steep. It might take longer to get where you're going than you think.\n\nWW Play Place is the best place to go skiing near NE city. It's only a short drive away. This place gets a lot of snow in the winter. If you go skiing after a big snow, you'll understand why people love a \"fluffy snow day\". On these days, a lot of people will stop doing everything else to go make tracks in the snow.\nThe story here is about a fun place called WK region. This place is full of interesting things to see and do. You can learn about this place, what to look at, and how to get there. There are also stories about other exciting places to visit. If you're someone who likes exploring, you can use this story. You can even make this story better by adding your own ideas!", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "16840680c1a959c1c87dea7630b904dc523666dd58ce10c646f6de47debf24d3"}

Here's what you need to know about our parks.\nAll pets brought into the parks by their owners should be kept on a leash all the time and watched by their owners. Owners must clean up after their pets in the parks.\nA special park was opened in the middle of the year 2017 to celebrate our town's long history. This park is a favorite spot for people in our town to relax or meet friends. It's right in the center of our town, at the crossing of two big roads. This park is a perfect place for special pictures... any time of the day!\nNO town Community Center\nOn the top part of the town, near the crossing of NO road and EL street, is the NO Park.\nThis park has a place for picnics, which can be used (see below), bathrooms, a playground, and a place to play basketball. The community room, which can be rented, is also in NO Park, along with the second fire station. There is a park that starts with a path called \"Memory Lane\". This path has many trees, each one planted to remember someone special. Sometimes, the park's grassy areas might not be cut because it depends on the weather and if there are people available to do the job. This park is where you can find the famous \"Splash Station\" of the GA city.\n\nThe park also has a Community Room and a Pavilion, which can be used if you want to have a party or a gathering. You can use the Community Room until it's time for bed. There are some rules to follow if you want to use this room, and you need to pay a small fee. If you follow all the rules, you can get some of your money back.\n\nTo use the Community Room for the whole day, you need to pay a little more.

{"text": "News from some important people: People in AZ state cannot check their voting papers if they forget to sign them after the voting day. \n\nThere was a meeting of three important people who make decisions. They said that the old rules should not change. This means if someone forgets to sign their voting paper by the end of the voting day, their voting paper will not be counted. \n\nThey said that it is better to keep the old rules because the voting day is very soon. They do not want to make everyone confused with new rules.\n\nSome people were not happy with this. They said the old rules are not fair. They said if someone makes a mistake with their signature on their voting paper, they have five days to fix it. But if they forget to sign it, they cannot fix it. \n\nThey also said the old rules make it hard for people who are not good at English. They need more help to understand how to fill out their voting papers.\nAlice, who works for the blue team, said in a summer complaint that the rule of not counting papers without a signature is not fair to the people the blue team wants to help. She said lots of these papers were not counted in a big vote in MC area alone.\nMr. David, a judge, agreed with this in a fall ruling that asked the state to allow a five-day period to correct this.\nDavid said the voting day deadline for fixing a paper without a signature is not fair, especially for those who return their papers too late to be told they're missing a signature. He said no to the state's wish to pause his order during an appeal.\nBut the court on Tuesday said the current deadline is okay and at most, it's a \"little\" problem. It also said the deadline helps the state manage a complex voting process in a good way. David's idea to let the state allow more time for papers without a signature would make the state's job harder, especially so close to voting day, the court said.\nIn answer to the blue team's challenge that the state treats missing signatures different from wrong signatures, the panel said the different treatment is okay. They said when an official questions a signature, it's a decision that needs a review, but when a voter doesn't sign their paper at all, it's the voter's mistake.\nThere was a big rule about voting that some people didn't like. The higher court said it's okay for now because the rule might not change. They also said that other big courts have stopped changes to voting rules before big votes. \nThe office in charge of the voting in AZ country didn't answer questions right away on a Tuesday. \nThe rule isn't gone, but it will stay for a bit. There needs to be a big talk about it in court. If they want the big talk before the day of voting, somebody has to ask for it quickly. As of Tuesday, nobody had asked for it, said the person in charge at the higher court's office. \nThere's more to read about voting in AZ country this year. \nThe reporter, Charlotte, writes about important things like the environment and how young people are treated. There are other stories to read about safety and politics too.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "bcc5c03f0a72d7a7529cf2c105f36f7c583ea2c1266c4fce8d35a5fcc8a00cfa"}
{"text": "Let's Not Always Think About Now\nWritten by Rachel\nA while ago\nI am standing at the sink in my kitchen, after a long day filled with work, looking after my kids, doing chores and dealing with a lot of feelings because of a very difficult election. I try to focus on the leftover pasta in a can that I am cleaning up. But my mind keeps thinking about the shows I want to watch. I make myself think about the orange, messy pasta again. But then my mind starts thinking about the new president.\nI am not doing a very good job at \"thinking about what I'm doing while I'm doing it,\" which is what a friend told me to do on a social media site. People who know a lot about this tell us that to be really happy, we shouldn't just do our housework without thinking. Instead, we should be really \"in\" the moment and think about every single thing we are doing, like cleaning oatmeal or eggs. They say this kind of thinking can help us feel better about the fast pace of life today. But to me, it feels like it's making things more stressful. It's like I'm not just trying to keep my house looking like a picture from a popular website, but also my mind.\nIt seems like everyone agrees these days that being happy is all about thinking only about the present. The idea that we should always bring our thoughts back to what's happening right now, instead of thinking about the past, the future, or other things that aren't real, is becoming more popular. Even people who are spiritual leaders, bankers, folks who like to think about life, government workers, and people who work in offices are starting to think this way. Big companies and the army teach people to focus on what they are doing now to do better at their jobs. People in our country spend a lot of money every year on things to help them focus on now. But does focusing on now really help us? For some people, focusing on now can be good if their now is happy and easy. But for others, now can be hard or boring. \nSometimes, it's more fun to think about the future than to focus on now. If you've ever thought about getting better at something or finding lost things, you know it's nice to think about good things that could happen. \nOne amazing thing our brain can do is think about the past, now, the future, and what could happen all at once. It can make washing dishes more fun if we can think about being somewhere exciting or doing something fun at the same time. So, it's not clear why it would be better to only think about now and nothing else.\nPeople are special because we can think about what is happening and decide what it means. We can be happy because of the stories we tell ourselves about our experiences. \n\nSometimes people tell us we should think more about what is happening right now. They make us feel bad if we get distracted. They say if we don't live in the moment, we are wasting our life and it's our fault if we're not happy.\n\nThis way of thinking tells us to fix our problems by changing our thoughts. It says that being happy comes from how hard we try to think positively. It says that if we have problems, it's because we're not thinking right. But this isn't always true. Sometimes problems are just problems and it's not our fault. Sometimes, we might think our problems come from things like chores we don't want to do, or people who aren't fair to us. But, some people say the problem is really our own thoughts. They suggest that instead of trying to fix these problems, we should focus on keeping our minds calm and happy. For example, students in busy city schools are taught to stay calm, instead of trying to make their schools better. The same goes for office workers who are tired and stressed; they are taught to breathe and stay calm instead of getting more time off or better health care.\n\nBut, is this really the best way to be happy? A big study of a lot of other studies about staying calm and happy didn't find very strong proof that it works better than other ways of relaxing. Some ways they compared it to were exercising, relaxing your muscles, listening to calming sounds, or even just giving someone your time and attention. The study found that these things work just as well, if not better, at making people happy.\n\nSo, maybe instead of trying so hard to stay calm and happy all the time, we should just be happy that our minds can think about other things. This idea comes from a book written by Rachel.\nThis page talks about many different things, like meditation and what people believe in different parts of the world. Some people are trying to show the truth about things that aren't fair or nice. It mentions a lot of different stories and people.\nNews about Strange Groups\nAre people in some groups allowed to make their own choices? \nA mother in CA country wants to stop old ceremonies...\nThere are mysteries about a group and a big problem\nThe police don't always find children who are in danger...\nPeople in BE city remember a group that was ruined by bad actions...\nA person says they lost their job because they didn't say some words...\nA man who did bad things is trying to make a deal...\nA leader, named Jack, says bad things about another man's views...\nAn old way of thinking is becoming popular again...\nWhat's happening in CH country's hidden places?\nA person who was in jail is upset about not being able to follow his beliefs\nA man named Benjamin, who was an artist and knew a lot about mysteries, is remembered...\nPeople are saying good things about a wise teacher\nA way of thinking that helps people relax is becoming popular in a big business area...", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "f2a87d7337e79f236365ab3f0076c402f995ae18844e9a5d88874b71f46c1f6b"}
{"text": "Our story is about a woman named Rachel. Rachel loved art and she lived in a big city called DE city. She was a strong and special lady who had a job running an art gallery for many years.\n\nRachel was from a place called KA city. She went to a big school and learned about talking to people and how to make beautiful pictures. After she finished school, she moved to DE city and learned even more about making pictures at a special art school.\n\nIn DE city, Rachel met a friend named Charlotte. They worked together, and Rachel started to learn about running an art gallery from Charlotte. Soon, Rachel and Charlotte opened their own art gallery on a street called WA street.\n\nBut after a few years, Charlotte moved to a different job at a big art museum in BO city. Rachel decided to keep the gallery open by herself. She moved the gallery to different places in DE city, like SO street and the last place called RI place. Even though it was hard sometimes, Rachel kept the gallery open for more than 25 years.\nA lady named Rachel really liked art from the DR city. She helped a lot of artists become famous. These artists included David, Madison, Wesley, Mary, and Charlotte. Adam, who began at a famous art gallery, stayed with Rachel until she had to close her art gallery in a winter month. Rachel's last art project was an art show of Adam's work, which people could see at another art gallery until a winter day.\n\n\"It was tough for her to close her art space,\" artist Sophia said. \"Many times she kept her art gallery open even when it was hard. Rachel made you feel like she truly liked your art. She was so excited about the artists she worked with. She was like a cheerleader for art. She didn't just show art because she thought she could sell it.\"\n\nEvery time I visited Rachel at her art gallery, I was always struck by her strong belief in the art show and the artwork. It was never about selling art to her; it was about having a deep talk about the art. I will miss Rachel's happy smile and our talks.\n\nArtist Patrick said, \"She had a great eye for art and filled a special place, in DR city and the surrounding areas. She was very adventurous in the way she would try out artwork. If she liked your art, she would take it and do great things with it.\"\n\n\"Her help was beyond measure,\" artist Benjamin said. \"There was a lady who loved new and different art. She also liked art from young people who were just starting. She wanted them to have a chance to show their art. She also loved her city and thought it should be a place where artists can meet and talk.\n\nThis lady worked hard to make her city a place where people liked art from all over. She tried to get people in her city to collect art. But sometimes, she was sad because people in her city didn't care about art as much as she did. She kept hoping that people in her city would start to like art more.\n\nEven now, people are still hoping for a time when there are many people of all ages who like and support art in their city.\" There's a new art place in town. People who have art galleries in DE city are very bold, said Patrick. Patrick and Robin worked together. Their gallery was a special place to show art made by people from CO state, and they showed the best ones. Patrick knows that what is \"best\" can change depending on who you ask. But the gallery was always open to new ideas and new artists. That's what Robin wanted, even though the art market in town is still growing and not very stable yet.\n\nPeople also talked about how honest Robin was. Todd, who owns a clothes shop, even gave her a funny nickname because of it. \"Robin always told the truth,\" said Patrick. \"She never lied. If she didn't like an artist's work, she would tell them.

{"text": "Making a Paper\nMaking a paper means creating a new one and changing it when needed. We often need to fix or make the paper better. Sometimes, we might even throw the paper away before we use it.\n\nIf only one person makes the paper, it's not very tricky. For example, a big boss can tell someone what to write in a letter, check the letter, change anything, and finally say it's ready to send out. Even in this easy situation, we need some rules. Only letters that are allowed should be sent out. And this letter must be the one the big boss said is okay.\n\nUsually, more than one person needs to help finish a paper. Like when we get a bill from the store, we need to make sure we got what we bought, check that everything is okay, and check the price and other things before we can pay the bill.\n\nIn situations like the bill, mistakes can happen, or someone might cheat, if we don't have good rules for our papers. For example, we might pay a bill even when we didn't get what we bought. Good rules should control both the making of the paper and any changes made later.\n\nIf we're working on something like making a computer program or designing something, we need a team to help make the papers. Making something together, like a picture, needs people to share the picture. It's like passing a drawing around a table, but that can be tricky. What if the paper gets lost or ripped? So, we need to find a way to all work on the same picture at the same time, without losing or damaging it.\n\nThink of a big computer that keeps the drawing safe. Everyone can look at the drawing from their own smaller computer. But, what if more than one friend wants to color the picture at the same time? If they all color and then save the picture, we might only see the last friend's coloring. The other friends' colors might disappear!\n\nTo make sure everyone's coloring gets seen, there are special rules. One rule is that only one friend can color at a time. They have to wait their turn. When a friend finishes coloring, they save the picture. Then, it's the next friend's turn to color.\n\nFor very important drawings, like planning a new toy, there's a special way to keep track of the changes. This is called 'version control'. Sometimes, when we make new drawings or build new things, we can create new problems. When this happens, we might want to look at our old drawings or things to help find out what the problem is. \n\nIt's also true that different versions of the same thing can still be used. To help the users, we need to remember all the details of the old versions.\n\nControlling versions means giving each new version a special ID and keeping all the information about all versions.\n\nKeeping track of documents is tricky right from the start, when we first make them. Later, storing them, finding them, keeping them safe, and keeping them for a long time can be hard. We will look at these one at a time.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "f02f5d629bca33edbbeb02e3825c6540f60f1f9509bebe82a75cd436c8b6dffe"}

{"text": "Once, there was a tall building at NE city. The building had lots of floors, and on the 48th floor, there were some important offices. These offices had different names. One was called \"Adam's office\", another was called \"Nathan's office\", and there was even one called \"David's office\". These offices had special numbers and they were very important. But the most special thing about them was that they all belonged to a big team called \"New Mountain\". They worked together to do lots of important things. There are three groups: NE Company, NE Company HC, and NE Company H. Each one is like a team that plays a big game in the city. They each have a special ticket to play this game. This ticket costs just a little bit, like buying a small toy.\n\nPeople want to know if these teams are famous and good at playing this game. It's like asking if they are popular kids in school. For all three groups, we can say yes, they are popular.\n\nSome teams have to tell everyone how they are doing in the game. But these three teams don't have to. They all said yes, they don't need to tell everyone.\n\nThe teams also have to put their game moves on a special place, kind of like a website. People want to know if they have done this. We can say yes, they have.\nIn the big FR country, there were three groups named NE Group, DA Group, and NA Group. They had to show if they were late in giving information. They did this by putting a checkmark in a box. \n\nNE Group, DA Group, and NA Group also had to tell if they were a big fast group, a fast group, a not-fast group, or a small group. They did this by putting a checkmark in a box too. \n\nBut, there was no place where people could buy or sell things from NE Group or DA Group.\nA big company named NE Company had a lot of money because people bought a lot of their shares. The price of each share was $14.16 on a specific day, and they had a total of $501.7 million on that day. Some people who work for the company own some shares. \n\nThere are three different parts of the NE Company. Each part has different numbers of shares. One part has 47,896,693 shares, another part also has 47,896,693 shares, and the last part only has 100 shares. \n\nEach part of the company is separate and only talks about its own information. They do not talk about the other parts. \n\nThey will have a big meeting soon and will share some information from this meeting later.\nThis is a big report about three companies. They are NM company, NC company, and NA company. This report has a lot of parts. It talks about the things that might be risky for the companies. It also talks about the buildings they have. They even talk about some legal stuff and safety in mines. \n\nThe report also mentions how the companies' stocks are doing. It shares some important money numbers. The people in charge of the companies have a discussion about how the companies are doing. They talk about risks in the market. They also share some financial statements. \n\nThe report mentions changes in how they count their money and disagreements with the people who help them count it. It shares how they control things and other information. It also talks about the people who are in charge and how much money they make. It tells us who owns the most of the companies and other things about the people in charge. \n\nThe report also shares how much money they spend on their accountants and what services they get. It also has some exhibits and financial schedules. \n\nRemember, this report is about three separate companies: NM company, NC company, and NA company. If the report talks about one company, it will say so. The companies do not say anything about the other companies. \n\nThe report starts with information about the NM company.There is a big company named New Mountain. The company does many things and has a lot of rules to follow. It is looked after by another company, and also has a company that helps it with its work. This big company is part of a bigger group of companies. This group of companies is very good at helping smaller companies grow. They have been able to help a lot of companies and have used a lot of money to do so. The big company was not always called New Mountain. It was made by the bigger group of companies a long time ago. Once, there was a big company named Guardian A. This company was made from a part of a much bigger company called Mountain P. Later, Mountain P made another smaller company and named it Mountain G. All these companies together were called \"Old Companies\". \n\nAfter some time, a new company was made and it was named Mountain F. This company was different from others because it had special rules to follow. \n\nOne day, Mountain F decided to sell some parts of itself to the public. So, they set a price for each part and sold it. At the same time, they sold some parts to their own people at the same price. Once, there was a big company named NE Company. It was owned by another company named FR Company. Both companies were very important and had to follow many rules.\n\nNE Company was started on a special day in 2011. FR Company was the only company that owned NE Company. NE Company was a unique type of company called a BDC, which means it had to follow even more special rules. It also decided to be a type of company called a RIC, which means it had to follow another set of rules.\n\nNE Company started when it bought everything from an older company. It did this in a special way so that it wouldn't have to pay extra money for things the older company owned. Because of this, when NE Company gave money to its owners, it wasn't extra money they had to pay taxes on, but money they had already given to the company.\n\nIn the end, this story teaches us about how companies can be owned by other companies and how they have to follow lots of rules. It's important to be fair and follow the rules, just like NE Company and FR Company.\nA big company named Guardian Adam got some parts of another company. Then, Guardian Adam gave these parts to its new little company, AIV Holdings, and got some of AIV Holdings' stocks. AIV Holdings can swap its parts of the other company for shares of NMFC's stocks anytime.\n\nNMFC and AIV Holdings are like parents. They don't do anything themselves but own the other company. They joined an agreement with the other company and became members of it. NMFC bought parts of the other company using the money from the IPO and another deal. NMFC got the same number of parts as the stocks it sold. NMFC also got parts equal to the stocks it gave to the partners of a group named New Mountain Gabriel Partners, L.P.\n\nFrom the time NMFC started selling stocks until the end of a year, NMFC earned about $233.4 million from selling more stocks. It also gave stocks worth about $249.6 million to AIV Holdings for the parts they swapped. Adam's company got the same amount of things from the Operating Company as the number of its own shares it sold. There is a picture that shows how the companies were set up at the end of the year. Also, there are partners of a group called Guardian Partners. These things that the company got can be switched for shares of Adam's company stock one by one. The Operating Company controls its own smaller company called \"The Helper Company\". Adam's company and another company called \"H\" don't control the Operating Company. Instead, they use a special way of showing their interest in the Operating Company. This way is usually used when one big fund is owned by more than one smaller fund. It helps the people who own shares in Adam's company and \"H\" to understand their investment better. There is also a company that gives advice on investments. This company takes care of the day-to-day work of the Operating Company and gives it advice on investments. There's a team that looks for things to buy, checks them out, and keeps an eye on them. This team is guided by a group of five people who decide if they should buy or sell something that costs more than a lot of money. They also keep track of things like how much money they have and how much they owe, and they help other companies manage their business too.\n\nThey have to compete with a lot of other groups and companies who want to buy the same things. Some of these groups and companies have more money and more people, but they believe they can compete because they have experienced people, they make decisions quickly and efficiently, they offer good terms, and they know the companies and industries they invest in very well.\nThe company we are talking about has other companies that are similar to it. These similar companies might put their money in places where they can earn as much or less than our company. So, our company doesn't just try to beat them by offering more money to the businesses it supports. There are other things that can make things risky for our company.\n\nOur company has two main goals. The first one is to earn money now. The second one is to make more money in the future. It does this by lending money to other businesses and getting different kinds of promises in return. Sometimes, these promises can be like owning a small part of the business they lend to. \n\nOur company lends money in two ways. The first way is by giving money directly to other businesses. The second way is by buying promises from other businesses on the market. Our company mostly lends to medium-sized businesses in the US. These businesses are not getting enough support from other lenders. We think of medium-sized businesses as those who earn between $20.0 million and $200.0 million each year before they pay for things like interest, taxes, and other expenses. Our company mainly focuses on businesses that are growing in a safe way. These businesses usually have certain things in common: They grow steadily, it's hard for other businesses to compete with them, they have a lot of money left after they pay for what they need, they make good use of their money and things, and they are the top businesses in their small markets. Our friend, the Big Company, loves to help other businesses grow. They usually help 5 to 10 businesses at a time and give each one a big box filled with 10 to 50 golden coins. The size of the box can become bigger or smaller depending on how many golden coins the Big Company has. \n\nA few years ago, the Big Company had 59 friends (businesses). They gave almost half of their golden coins to the friends who needed the most help. They also gave a little bit of their coins to the friends who needed a little bit of extra help. And they even shared some of their other treasures. \n\nThe Big Company's treasure box was worth a lot of golden coins. Each year, they count their coins and their friends. They also look at how much they gave to new friends and how much they got back from their old friends. This helps them to know if they are doing a good job helping businesses grow.\nThere were some changes in the value of things in a few groups. Some went up, and some went down. For example, in one year, the value of things in 12, 22, and 17 groups changed. Also, in other years, the value of things in 45, 48, and 17 groups changed too. Sometimes, the changes were good, but other times, they were not.\n\nThe big group had a lot of smaller groups inside it. Each of these smaller groups had different amounts of things. For example, one group had 4.0% of the things, another group had 3.9% of the things, and yet another group had 3.6% of the things. These are just a few examples, but there are many more smaller groups in the big group.\nThere was a list of companies and what they did. Some were into making software, others were about teaching people things, and others helped businesses do their work. There were also companies that moved things around, helped the government, took care of people's health, made energy, made things for the news, made things to keep people healthy, and helped customers.\n\nThe company that was in charge had some rules for choosing who they would help. But, they didn't always follow these rules for every company they helped. Here are some of the rules:\n\n1. They liked to help companies that could do well when times were good and when times were not so good. These companies also needed to be big and keep growing so they could be worth a lot.\n2. They liked companies that were the only ones doing what they did, or it was hard for other companies to do the same thing.\n3. If they could, they liked companies that would keep making money in the future.\nThe company likes to put money into businesses that don't have a lot of regular costs. This way, small changes won't hurt the business too much.\n\nThe company also loves businesses that can make a lot of money without needing to spend a lot first. They don't want businesses that need to buy a lot of things or need a lot of money to keep running.\n\nThe company wants to put money into businesses that are the best in their small market. These businesses should have been the best for a long time.\n\nThe company likes to put money into businesses that have been around for a while and have been doing well. They don't want to put money into new businesses or businesses that don't have a good plan.\n\nThe company usually likes to put money into businesses together with other business sponsors they know and trust. These sponsors should know how to make a business more valuable.\n\nThe company also wants the businesses they put money into to have a team that has been doing business for a long time and knows how to run a business well. Usually, the company has worked with or knows about the important people in these businesses from before.\n\nThe company's adviser believes they have a good way to choose which businesses to put money into. They first find the best types of businesses and then try to become the best investor in those businesses. A group of smart people work together to decide what to buy and sell. Here's how they do it:\n\nFirst, they look for good things to buy. Then, they try to be the best in those areas. Lastly, they look for things that are doing really well in those areas.\n\nThe group includes people like Steven, Robert, Adam, Douglas and Jack. Other people in the company also join their meetings. This group decides if the company should buy or sell things that cost a lot of money. The boss of the company can also decide if they should buy or sell things that cost less. These rules can change.\n\nThe group's job is to decide what the company should buy or sell. They use their knowledge and different ideas to make these decisions. They help the company stay true to its buying and selling rules. The Big Group talks about how to best use their money. They meet to talk about what they can buy with their money and what they might get from it. They always think about how to keep their money safe and how to get more money back. They also think about how to help the companies they give money to do well.\n\nWhen they lend money, they make sure they get something in return. They make sure they get their money back first if something goes wrong. They also try to get more money from the companies they help. They decide how to do this based on what the company does and how it plans to do better. A big part of what they get back is the extra money the companies pay them for lending them money.\n\nWhen they give money to a company, they make sure they are the first ones to get their money back if something goes wrong. They usually lend money for about four to seven years. The companies have to pay them extra money for lending them money. If the company pays back early, they might have to pay even more.\n\nSometimes, they lend money but they are not the first ones to get their money back if something goes wrong. They usually lend money for about five to eight years. The companies also have to pay them extra money for lending them money. If the company pays back early, they might have to pay even more. Sometimes, when someone lends money, they can get extra money added to the amount they lent. This extra money is like a thank you for lending the money and it gets added to the total money that needs to be paid back. This usually happens when it's time to pay back all the money.\nThere are different types of lending. One type is when you lend money without getting something in return to keep until you get your money back. This usually lasts for about 5 to 10 years and the extra thank you money is set. Sometimes, the person who lends the money can also get a little piece of the business they lend money to.\nFrom time to time, the FR company may promise to give more money to a business in the future. \nWhen the FR company lends money, they may get a piece of the business. This is the same piece that the business gives to the people who gave them money. Sometimes, the FR company also gets a little piece of other businesses together with other people who lend money. The FR company tries to make sure it has some say in the business and can get its money back if something big happens. The FR company also tries to make sure it can sell its piece of the business if it wants to.\nThe FR company always checks how its businesses are doing, at least every three months. Adam is in charge of a toy store. He always keeps an eye on his toys to see if they are selling well or if the children don't like them anymore. Adam uses different ways to check how his toys are doing. \n\nHe looks at how many toys he sold every month, and he talks to the children who visit his shop to know what they like. He also meets with his helpers to chat about how the toy store is doing and how they can make it better. \n\nAdam also has a special way of checking how good his toys are. He uses numbers from 1 to 4 to rate his toys:\n\n1. Toy is loved a lot by the children.\n2. Toy is liked just as Adam expected. All new toys get this rating when they first come to the shop.\n3. Toy is not liked as much as Adam thought and may be removed from the shop.\n4. Toy is not liked at all and might be removed soon. The toy might not be sold anymore, and Adam might lose money.\n\nSo, Adam is always careful to keep his toy store fun and exciting for all the children who visit.\nThis is a story about how a big company uses its money. Imagine the company has four boxes to put its money in, each box is a different way to use money. At the end of a year, they looked at how much money they put in each box. They had the most money in box 2 and the least in box 4. \n\nSometimes, the company needs to take its money out of the boxes. There are four ways they can do this: they can sell something they own, they can use new money to replace the old one, they can wait until the end of a time period, or they can sell the money they put in. Sometimes, they can take some money out before the end of the time period.\nA big company, let's call it OC, keeps a close eye on the things it owns. This is important because it helps figure out how much the company is worth. Two smaller companies, we'll call them Company N and Company A, also do this because they are part of OC. They check how much they are worth every three months, or sometimes even more often if needed.\n\nOC uses special rules to figure out how much its things are worth. They do this every three months, or more often if needed. The people in charge of OC are the ones who decide how much everything is worth. They do this in a fair way, even for things that don't have a price tag or are hard to sell. The way they do this is very detailed and careful.\n\nIf something they own has a price that can be easily found, they use that price. If they can't find a price, they ask different people how much they think it's worth. They then use these ideas to come up with a fair price. For special papers called bonds, they get prices from special services. Let's say, there's a group of very smart people, we will call them Helpers. They work for a big company. They are like treasure hunters. But instead of treasures, they look at things to buy and sell. They have to make sure they are paying the right price for these things. \n\nWhen the Helpers find something they might want to buy, they have to check its price. They do this by looking at what other people are selling it for. If they can't find out the price this way, they use a special way to guess what it should be worth.\n\nThe Helpers also have to make sure that the price is right. They do this by talking to each other and using different ways to check. If they still can't make sure the price is right, they use their special way to guess the price.\n\nSometimes, the Helpers can't find a price for something anywhere. Then, they have to use a step-by-step way to guess the price. First, the Helper who found it makes a guess. Then, they talk about this guess with the big bosses in the company.\nImagine you have a jar of cookies. If you count the cookies and find out you have less than before for four times in a row, and if the number of cookies is more than what you usually have, you need to ask a cookie expert to count them again at least once every year. This expert is chosen by the people who help you manage your cookies; and\nWhen the people managing your cookies think it is needed, they can ask a cookie expert to count and check your cookies, even if you have not counted them first. The cookie experts will then check and confirm the number of cookies.\nFor cookies that you have promised to give to others but have not given yet, the number of cookies you have given is reduced by the number of cookies you have promised but not given. The number of cookies you think you have is also changed based on the increase or decrease in the number of cookies you have promised but not given. As a result, promising to give cookies but not giving them may make you think you have less cookies until you actually give them.\nThe number of cookies you think you have is based on what you know and it may not be the number of cookies you will actually have, since that depends on what will happen in the future and you won't know until you have given or received all your cookies. Because it is hard to know how many cookies you will have if you can't count them, the number of cookies you think you have may change from time to time and the change could be big.\nA company like a BDC has to follow certain rules. These rules are about how a BDC can invest money, how it can work with other companies, and how it can be run. A BDC has to be set up in the US country, and its main job is to give money and help to private companies. A BDC can use money from people who buy its stocks, and other places, to make long-term investments in businesses. People who own stocks in a BDC can sell them whenever they want, and they might also benefit from investing in private companies.\n\nBDCs also have a group of people who make decisions for them, called a board of directors. Most of the people on the board can't have a conflict of interest. BDCs can't protect any director or officer if they don't do their job properly, and they have to have insurance to protect the BDC.\n\nBDCs also have to follow a rule about how much they owe compared to how much they own. This means that the amount of debt can't be more than half of the value of the BDC's total assets or the BDC can borrow an amount equal to 100.0% of net assets. A big company keeps a close eye on its important rules. However, two smaller parts of the big company, let's call them Adam and Alice, don't have big responsibilities themselves. Their only job is to be part of the big company. They follow rules that say their only belonging should be their part in the big company and their people can vote along with the other big company voters.\n\nAdam might, if the rules allow, bring more money into the company. This would give more money to the big company too. Adam usually can't sell its part of the company for a price less than it's worth. However, Adam might sell its part of the company, or the chance to buy its part, for less money than it's worth if its leaders think it's the best thing for Adam and its people, and if its people agree with the sale. Also, Adam can usually give new parts of the company to people for less money than they're worth if it's offering to current people or in other special situations.\n\nAs a special type of company, the big company is usually not allowed to invest in any other company where their helper or helpers already have an investment.\nWe can't change what we do or stop being a special kind of business without getting permission from most of the people who own part of the business. This is because of a rule made in the late 20th century. This rule says that we need permission from either 67.0% of the people who own part of the business and are at a meeting if more than half of the people who own part of the business are there, or permission from more than half of the people who own part of the business. We don't think we will change what we do a lot. \n\nAlso, as this special kind of business, we can't give out parts of the business in return for work. \n\nThere are two businesses, let's call them 'N' and 'A', that have decided to be treated a certain way when it comes to taxes. This means 'N' and 'A' won't have to pay certain taxes if they give their profits to the people who own part of the business. But, the people who own part of the business will have to pay taxes on the money they receive. There are some special rules for certain kinds of money that 'N' and 'A' make.\nThere are two companies, let's call them N-company and A-company. They have to follow some rules to be a certain type of company. One of these rules is that they have to share most of their income with the people who own their stocks. This is like sharing your toys with your friends. They also have to make sure their income comes from different places, like getting candies from more than one store. \n\nIn addition to this, they have to pay some money as tax, kind of like when you have to give one of your candies to your teacher. But N-company and A-company try to share enough money with their stockholders so they don't have to pay this tax. However, there's no guarantee that they'll always be able to do this. For example, in a particular year, N-company had to pay a small amount of tax.\nThere are two big groups called NM and AI. To be a part of a special club (let's call it 'RIC'), they have to follow some rules. One rule is that they need to stay as part of another special group (let's call it 'BDC') all the time, every year. Another rule is that they have to get most of their pocket money, at least 9 out of 10 coins, from certain places like sharing things, lending things, or getting money from other groups. This is called the 'Big Pocket Money Rule'. Also, they must have a mix of different things in their toy box: half of their toys should be easy-to-get things like play money, pretend government papers, other group's toys, and some special toys. They can't have too many of the same toys from one friend or more than a quarter of their toys from one friend or a group of friends who play the same games or work together. This is called the 'Mixing Toys Rule'.\nIf Adam or Bella don't pass the big test or the different games during a year or part of the year, they can still be counted as good players. But, they might have to give away some of their toys or do other things. If Adam or Bella can't be good players and they can't use the special rules, they will have to follow the normal rules like all the other kids (and also follow the rules of their home and school), no matter if Adam or Bella share their toys with their friends. Sharing toys is not necessary. However, if they share toys, their friends will see this as a kind gift and, with some rules, their friends can keep these toys. If they give away too many toys, their friends will first return the toys they received, and any remaining toys will be seen as a special gift.\nThere are some rules that big businesses have to follow. For example, if a big business like Adam's company or Alice's company doesn't follow the rules for a while, they might have to pay some extra money. This could happen if they sell something that they owned when they were not following the rules. This rule can last for ten years or sometimes five years. But, Adam's company or Alice's company can choose to pay the extra money right away. They can also choose to be like a normal business for a year if they think it's a good idea.\n\nThere's also something called a \"Management Agreement\". Big businesses are often in charge of a lot of money, but they don't do anything else. They are like a big box that holds lots of smaller boxes. The only thing they do is own parts of other businesses. In simple words, a company named \"NM company\" and \"AI company\" don't need to pay any outside helpers for advice on how to use their money. But, the \"OP company\" does need help from outside and pays a helper named \"IA helper\" for this service.\n\nThe helper and the company have some rules they follow together. These rules are called the \"Important Helper Rules\". The helper is officially known as a helper under some old rules from many years ago.\n\nThe helper does a lot of things for the company under the rules. They help decide what the company should buy or sell. They find out what things the company should invest their money in. They check on these investments. They also do a lot of research before making these decisions. The helper also votes and makes decisions on behalf of the company.\nThe business that we're talking about gets help from another business with its money matters. This help includes advice about where to put their money and other help they may need. This help isn't only for them, it can also be given to other businesses.\n\nThis business has to pay for this help. The payment is made up of two parts. One part is a regular fee and the other is an extra fee if they do a really good job. Both these fees are paid by the people who are part of the business.\n\nThe regular fee is worked out every year and is based on how much money the business has. There are some things they don't include when working out the fee, like loans and cash. The fee is paid four times a year and is worked out based on how much money the business had in the last two quarters of the year. If the business gets or gives back some money during the quarter, they change the fee to match.\nMoney Rewards\nThere are two parts to getting a money reward. The first part is figured out and given four times a year. It's like getting 20% of the \"Before-Reward Money Made\" from the last three months. It needs to pass a certain amount, like a test, before it's given. \"Before-Reward Money Made\" means the money made from interest, dividends, and other sources during the three months, minus any costs to run the business (like management fees and other costs) but not including the money reward. It includes money earned from investments with a wait-for-it interest feature (like a special kind of debt, debt with extra interest, and no-coupon bonds), even if the money hasn't been received yet. \"Before-Reward Money Made\" doesn't include any gains or losses from selling investments, or changes in value of investments that haven't been sold.\nWhen a business named \"OB\" started selling shares to the public, it did not change the original value of its stuff to match the market price. The total value of OB's stuff at that time was more than its original cost. This means that OB might show different amounts of gain and loss in different times than if it had changed the cost to match the market price. This will continue until OB sells or uses up all its old stuff. \n\nOB keeps track of the market value of each thing it owns from the time it started selling shares. It adjusts its income based on how much it would have earned if it had bought each thing at the time it started selling shares or changed the cost to match the market price. This is called \"Adjusted Income\". OB also uses the market value of each thing it owns to adjust its gain or loss and any increase or decrease in value. \n\nThis \"Adjusted Income\", shown as a return on the value of OB's stuff at the end of the previous three months, will be compared to a minimum rate of 2.0% every three months (8.0% every year), subject to an additional provision measured at the end of each three months. There is a rule about how much extra treats the \"giving person\" can give to the \"doing person\". Here's how it works: \nIf the \"doing person\" doesn't do better than the agreed amount, which we can think of as the \"goal\", then the \"giving person\" doesn't have to give any extra treats. \nIf the \"doing person\" does a little bit better than the \"goal\", up to a certain point, then all of those extra treats go to the \"giving person\". This is like a bonus for the \"doing person\" doing a good job. \nIf the \"doing person\" does a lot better than the \"goal\", then the \"giving person\" gets some of those extra treats, but not all of them. This is after the \"doing person\" has reached their goal and gotten their bonus.\nAt the end of each year, or when the agreement ends, a certain part of the money earned is given out. This part is 20.0% of the total profit, if any, from the start till the end of each year. This is calculated after taking away any losses and the total amount of any previously given money.\n\nAccording to rules, the company keeps a record of a possible part of the profit based on the total profit and losses and the total increase and decrease in the value of investments at the end of each period. The actual amounts given to the adviser are based on the real profit, after considering all losses and decrease in value from the start till the end of each year as if everything was sold at a fair price.\n\nLet's understand with an example: The part of the money earned related to income for each quarter of the year:\nIncome from investments (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 1.25%\nHurdle rate(1) = 2.00%\nFee for management(2) = 0.44%\nOther expenses (legal, accounting, keeping safe, transfer agent, etc.)Sometimes, when people make money, they have to give a little bit of it to someone else. This is called a fee. Let's pretend there's a game where you have to earn some points. First, you have to earn a certain number of points, let's say 2. If you don't get to 2 points, you don't need to give away any of your points. But if you earn more than 2 points, like 2.26 points, you have to give away a little bit. So, you give away 0.26 points. \n\nNow, there's another rule. If you earn more than 2.5 points, you have to give away even more points. So, if you earn 2.86 points, you have to give away 0.50 points for the first 0.50 points you earned over 2 points, plus 0.07 points for the rest. So, in total, you give away 0.57 points. This is how the game works!\nLet's imagine a shop. This shop sells stuff and makes money. The money it makes is like the money your piggy bank would have if you put a coin in it every day. Now, let's say the shop had some things before it opened. The money it makes from those things is like counting the coins as if you started putting them in the piggy bank the day the shop opened. \n\nThe shop wants to make sure it earns enough money. So, it sets a goal, like you would when you're saving up for a toy. This goal is like saying, \"I want to save 8 coins every year.\"\n\nThe shop also has to pay for things, like cleaning and keeping the lights on. This is like giving 1.75 coins from your piggy bank every year.\n\nThe shop doesn't count the money it took to open the shop. That's like not counting the money you used to buy the piggy bank.\n\nNow, there's a special rule. If the shop makes more than 2.50 coins in any season, the person who helps the shop to make decisions gets a reward. This reward is like getting 20% of all the extra coins.\n\nLet's make up a story. In the first year, the shop buys two things: Thing A for 20 coins and Thing B for 30 coins. In the second year, they sell Thing A for 50 coins and find out that Thing B is now worth 32 coins. In the third year, Thing B is now worth 25 coins. In the fourth year, they sell Thing B for 31 coins.\n\nIn this story, the reward for the person who helps make decisions is like this:\nIn the first year: None\nIn the second year, we put some money aside because we made extra money when we sold Thing A. We saved 6.0 million dollars because we made an extra 30.0 million dollars when we sold Thing A. So, we put aside a little bit of that extra money. \nIn the third year, we didn't put any money aside. We made a little less money that year because we had to pay for some things that were broken. But we also took away the money we had already saved from the second year. \nIn the fourth year, we put a little bit more money aside. We saved 0.2 million dollars because we made a little bit more money that year. But we also took away the money we had already saved from the second year.\nIn the first year, we used our money to buy some things. We spent 20.0 million dollars on Thing A, 30.0 million dollars on Thing B, and 25.0 million dollars on Thing C. \nIn the second year, we sold Thing A for 50.0 million dollars. We also found out that Thing B and Thing C were worth 25.0 million dollars each. \nIn the third year, we found out that Thing B was worth a little more, 27.0 million dollars. We also sold Thing C for 30.0 million dollars.\nIn the second year, we also saved some extra money. We saved 5.0 million dollars because we made extra money when we sold Thing A. But we also had to pay for some things that were broken in Thing B. So we put aside a little bit of that extra money.\nIn a pretend game of money, we can think of three years. In the first year, we get a reward of pretend money. We got this by taking a big amount of pretend money, removing a little bit, and then taking a small part of what was left. But we also have to give some of it back from what we got last year. \n\nIn the second year, we get another reward. This time, we take a bigger amount of pretend money, take a small part of it, and then give back some of the rewards we got in the last two years.\n\nIn the third year, we don't get any reward. This is because we take a smaller amount of pretend money, find a small part of it, and then give back some of the rewards we got in the last three years.\n\nAll of this pretend money is just part of a bigger game. And, it's important to remember that in this game, we might not always win, and what we get can change. Also, the way we play this game could change based on some rules about how we got our pretend money.\nAdam and his friends run a toy shop. They earn some money when they sell toys. Sometimes, they earn a lot of money because they sell a lot of toys. But they also need to spend money to keep the shop running.\n\nHere are some things they need to spend money on:\n\n1. Making the shop nice and clean.\n2. Checking and counting all the toys they have.\n3. If they borrow money, they need to pay it back.\n4. When they sell toys, they need to pay for that too.\n5. They need to pay the people who help them run the shop.\n6. They have to pay other people to help them make and count the toys.\n7. They need to keep all the toys safe and in one place.\n8. They spend money to tell people about their shop (like going to toy fairs).\n9. They have to pay some money to the city and the country.\nPeople who run businesses have to pay for many things. Some of the things they have to pay for are:\n\n- Money for people who help them make decisions;\n- Paying people to help sell things;\n- Money to send letters and reports to people who own parts of the business;\n- Money to make reports for the government;\n- Money for people who check the business's money and for lawyers;\n- Money for following rules about businesses;\n- Money for insurance;\n- Money for printing, sending mail, and other things the business needs to do.\n\nThere are also special rules about what a business can own. A business can only own certain things. If they want to own something else, then at least 70% of what they already own has to be these certain things. For example, some businesses only own parts of other businesses. They follow the rules by looking at what those other businesses own. Our business deals with special things called assets. These can be things like special notes or tokens bought from a company or person. A company can be special if it's made in the US, doesn't work like an investment company, and follows one of these rules: It doesn't trade tokens on a big token exchange, it trades tokens but is worth less than a big pile of tokens, it's controlled by a group that includes us and we have a boss who helps run the company, or it's a small company with enough stuff and money.\nThe Company can keep things that it owns from other companies it looks after. They can also buy things privately if the person selling them is having money problems. The Company can buy things from any person if there is no easy way to sell those things and if the Company already owns a lot of that person's things. They can also get things in exchange for other things, or if they have special papers that let them get more things. They can keep cash, similar things to cash, things from the US government, or things that turn into cash in a year or less. The Company has to be in the US and it has to work for the purpose of buying and keeping the types of things we talked about. A few years ago, a small part of the Company's total things were not the right kind of things.\nHelping Friends in their Work\nSometimes, when a big group needs to make sure they have the right things, they need to either be in charge of the things or they need to offer help to the ones who are in charge of the things. This help is really important, but it's okay if another friend in the group offers to help instead. This help can be things like giving good ideas and advice about how to run things better. The big group's leader or their friend can offer this help to friends who ask for it. \n\nSaving Up for Later\nWhile waiting to get more of the right things, the big group can keep their stuff in things like piggy banks, safe boxes, or even in things from the US government that are really safe and will be used up in one year or less. These are called \"temporary savings\". Most of the time, the big group will keep their stuff in safe things from the US government. They can also use a special way of saving where they buy something and then agree to sell it back later for a little more money. This is like a promise between the big group and the seller. A company has many things it can use its money on. One thing it can do is to buy something called repurchase agreements. But, the company won't buy too much of these from just one other company. If it does, it might have trouble with some rules about how it uses its money. So, the company has made a decision not to buy too many repurchase agreements from one company. There are people who work for the company who will make sure the companies it is buying these agreements from are reliable.\n\nThe company can also borrow money or issue debt under certain conditions. But, when it does this, it has to make sure that it has enough assets. The company has a rule that it must have assets that are at least double the amount of the debt it issues. If the company has any debts, it can't give any money to its owners or buy back any of its own shares unless it has enough assets. The Company can borrow a small part of its total belongings when needed. It will also consider the belongings and debts of a group called NM for figuring out how much it can borrow. There are some dangers linked with borrowing too much, which we won't go into here.\n\nThe Company has rules to guide how workers can invest their own money. Workers can buy stocks for their own benefit, including the ones that the Company may also buy. But they have to follow the rules when doing so. You can look at these rules at a big office in a city far away. You can also get information about the office by calling a special phone number. You can get a copy of the rules by sending an email, but you might have to pay a small fee for it. You can also find the rules on a big website.\n\nThe Company and the Investment Team have rules to prevent breaking the law. They check these rules every year to make sure they are good enough and are being followed properly. The person in charge at the company makes sure all the rules are followed. He also helps decide how to vote when there are big decisions to be made. \n\nThere's another company that helps with this too. They look at every decision that needs to be made and think about how it might help or hurt the company. They always want to do what's best for the company. \n\nSometimes, things come up that might seem bad at first, but could be good in the long run. So, they might decide to vote for these things.\n\nThe people who make these decisions are very important at their company. They also keep a close eye on what's happening with the company's money and things. To make sure that the votes are fair and honest, they have some rules to follow. First, anyone who has a say in the vote has to tell the person in charge if there's something that might get in their way of voting fairly. They also have to say if they've talked to anyone who might want to change the vote. Second, the people who count the votes can't tell anyone how they think the vote will go. This makes sure no one can try to change the vote. \n\nIf you want to know how they voted, you can ask for free. You just have to write a letter and ask for the voting information. You send it to the person in charge at their big building in NE city.\n\nThe companies don't have any workers. The everyday work is done by another group. This group is paid back for the work they do and the money they spend. This includes paying the people in charge and their teams. \n\nThere's a law from the early 2000s. This law makes sure that companies and the people who run them follow certain rules. There are certain rules that businesses have to follow. Like one rule says that the top people in a company have to say that the money details in their reports are correct. Another rule states that companies have to share their thoughts on how well they are sharing important details. They also need to write a report on how they check their money details and get someone outside the company to check it too. Another rule says that companies have to share if they made big changes to how they check their money details after they checked them, including fixing any big problems. \n\nThere is also a big rule from 2002 that says companies have to check if they are following all the rules and make sure they keep doing so. They have to watch out for new rules and do what's needed to follow them.\nWe share important news and updates with a big group that checks our work. This happens regularly. You can find this information in a big building in WA city. You can also call them to learn more. They also have a website where you can find information about us. \n\nWe also put these updates on our own website for everyone to see without needing any money. The information on our website and the big group's website is not part of this big news update.\n\nWe care a lot about keeping your information safe. We have rules to protect your private information. These rules are for people who have shared or may share with us. We can change these rules anytime, but we will tell you if we do. These rules are more important than any older rules you might have from us.\nWe keep safe all the details we learn about you. We only ask for your name, where you live, how many shares you have, and your special number. We use these details to send you our yearly report and other things about us, and to send you other things the law says we must.\nWe don't share these details with anyone else unless we have to, like we explain below.\nWorkers Who Need to Know. Only workers who need to know your details can see them.\nHelping Companies. We might tell your details to companies that help us, like keeping records, doing your trades, and sending you things. These companies must keep your details safe and only use them for the reason they got them.\nCourts and Officials. If the law says we must, we might tell your details to a court or government officials. Only the details the law, or a court order, says we must tell will be told.\nWe try very hard to keep your private details safe. We only let workers and other people who need to know your details see them so we can help you. We keep your details safe in many ways.\nIf you're not sure about our rules or if you want to know more about your personal stuff that's not for everyone to see, you can talk to our big boss. Just call this number: (2-1-2) 6-5-5-0-0-2-4.\n\nBe careful! There are some important things you need to think about before you decide to be part of our team. We are going to tell you about some things that could be problems. But remember, we might not know all the problems yet. Some things that we don't think are big problems right now might turn out to be big problems later. If bad things happen, it could hurt our team and you could lose what you put in.\n\nThere are some things happening in the world that could make things tough for us. People are worried about money stuff in the US and some countries in the EU. If these places have money problems, it could hurt our team and how we do things.\nThere was a time when some people who keep track of money were worried about how much the government was spending. They said that the government might not be able to pay back all the money they borrowed. This made some people nervous and they thought it might be harder for companies to borrow money too. This could make it difficult for companies to do their work and could make their shares less valuable.\n\nThere was also a time when some countries in Europe had trouble with their own money. They had borrowed too much and people were worried they couldn't pay it back. This made things difficult all around the world. It made people less confident and they spent less money. More people couldn't pay their loans and houses became less valuable. We don't know what will happen next.\nThere were some problems with money stuff in a place called \"EU country\". People there were finding it hard to get money, and it was costing them more. We don't know if this problem will get bigger or if there will be enough help to fix it. If people keep being worried about this, it might make it hard for businesses to do well. \n\nA long time ago, there was a big group in the \"US country\" that decided to buy fewer special papers that help the country's money grow. They did this because they saw that things were getting a bit better. But, we don't know what will happen because they're buying fewer of these papers. Without these special papers, it might be harder to borrow money, and this could be a problem for businesses. \n\nIf the \"US country\" can't agree on how much money they're allowed to borrow, this might also be a problem for businesses. It might make things harder for them, and they might not do as well.\nA man who takes care of money for a big country warned that if they don't allow the country to borrow more money, they might not be able to pay their bills soon. If they can't borrow more money and run out of it, they might have to stop or delay paying for things they need. This could lead to big problems, like the country not being able to pay back its loans.\n\nIf the people who make the rules for this country can't decide on a plan for spending money before the old plan ends, they might have to stop many of their activities. This could create lots of problems, like making people worried and causing trouble for the markets where people buy and sell things. It could also make it hard for companies to get the money they need to run their business. This could make those companies worth less money.\n\nSo, all the uncertainty around these problems, including the recent stop of many activities and the questions about borrowing more money, could hurt the business and financial health of many companies in different places.\n\nOne more thing to remember is that our business is still new and we don't have a lot of experience yet.\nA big business named NB and another named AI started in the year after each other. Another company, called the OC, started even earlier and owned everything from older companies. NB and AI don't do anything themselves, they just own parts of the OC. Because of this, they might face some problems that new businesses usually face. These issues could make the worth of NB and OC go down a lot.\nThe OC might lose money.\nWhen you put money into small or medium-sized businesses, it can be a bit risky. This risk can get even bigger when the economy isn't doing well, like it has been in the US and other places.\nThe OC does not think it will do as well as the old companies or other companies that NM helped.\nThe OC doesn't believe it will do as well as the older companies or as well as the companies NM invested in. Even though the older companies started in tough times, it was a good time for OC because of its goals and plans. The Big Company has ways of doing things that may not be the same as the Mountain Group or their team. The Big Company and some others have rules they need to follow that the Mountain Group doesn't. Usually, the Big Company can't put money into businesses where the Mountain Group already has money. This might slow down the Big Company's work. Also, the Big Company might work differently than older groups did. The old groups did their work when times were good, but those good times might not happen again. We can't be sure if the Big Company's team can keep doing a great job like before.\n\nIt's hard to know how much the Big Company's business stuff is worth because most of it is in private companies and marked at fair price. Also, since NM and AH are parent companies, the fair price of the Big Company's stuff is decided by the Big Company's group of bosses following the Big Company's price rules.\nThe company has some things it owns that are special and not easy to know their exact worth. But, they have to figure out how much these things are worth. This is done by the company's big team, called a board of directors. They look at these things every three months, or even more often if needed, to decide how much they think it's worth. They use special rules to do this. \n\nThe company's board of directors also gets help from other people who know a lot about how to figure out how much things are worth. But, it's not always easy to do. Sometimes, they have to guess or make a smart decision about how much these things are worth. Even if they have some information about how much it might be worth, that information might not be very good or accurate.\nThere is a group of people who have a job to decide how much things are worth. They look at lots of different things to make this decision. They might look at what other similar things are being sold for, or how much money the thing can make. Sometimes, they might also think about any special rules that are attached to the thing, or if it comes with anything else that might be valuable. This can be a hard job, because sometimes the thing they are trying to price isn't being sold anywhere else, so they have to guess.\n\nSometimes, they might guess too high or too low. This can be a problem, especially if other people are trying to buy based on their guess. If their guess is too high, people might pay too much. If it's too low, people might pay too little. This is especially important for companies that own lots of these things, because their worth is based on these guesses.\nA big company's leaders are the same as those of two smaller companies. But this might change in the future. This can change how much money you might get if you own part of the smaller companies. The leaders of all companies talk to each other if they think the worth of the big company's things should be different. The way they figure out how much the big company's things are worth is the same as the smaller companies.\n\nEvery three months, the big company may change how much its stuff is worth, based on what its leaders think. Any changes are written down in a special report. \n\nThe big company's success relies on the smart people who decide what things to invest in. If these smart people, like Steve and Robert, were to leave, the company might not do as well. The big company really needs the good choices and relationships of these smart people to find, decide on, arrange, carry out, check on, and take care of its investments. In a big company, there are many helpful people who work together to do good work. In our story, we can think of this big company as a giant team. There were around 100 team members at the end of a year. They worked hard and helped each other to do their jobs well. They also got help from another big team to find new ways to do good work.\n\nThe team's success was because of the hard work of some very important people. If any of these important people left the team, it could make things harder for the team to do their job.\n\nThere was a small group in the team that watched over their work. This group had five members. If any member left without someone to take their place, it could also make things harder for the team to do their job. This could make things difficult for the team and it could affect their work and money.\n\nTo do their job well, the team might need to find, teach, and guide new people to help them. If the team can't find new people or it takes too long, it might be bad for their work and money.\nOur helper, let's call him Isaac, doesn't have much practice in taking care of a big toy box or a treasure chest, and this might make our playtime not as fun. Just like us, Isaac didn't take care of a big toy box or a treasure chest before. There are special rules for these big toy boxes and treasure chests that don't apply to other smaller toy boxes that Isaac has taken care of before. For example, Isaac must fill at least 70.0% of the big toy box with toys from US toy companies, money, money-like items, US government toys, and other good quality toys that can be played with for a year or less. Also, to be seen as a treasure chest, Isaac needs to follow rules about where the toys come from, the variety of toys, and giving out toys every year. Two of our toy boxes, we'll call them \"N's box\" and \"A's box\", don't have anything in them except for their ownership of pieces of a bigger toy set, and they don't have any big problems. So, \"N's box\" and \"A's box\" depend on the bigger toy set's toys and fun for following the rules for big toy boxes and the rules for treasure chests. If Isaac doesn't follow these rules on time, \"N's box\", \"A's box\", and the bigger toy set might not be seen as big toy boxes or \"N's box\" and \"A's box\" might not be seen as treasure chests, and we might have to pay surprise toy taxes and penalties, which would make our playtime less fun. Adam, who is new to taking care of a big box of toys, may find it hard to pick the best toys. If he doesn't follow the rules of taking care of the toy box, he might not be able to play with the toys the way he wants. He might even lose his toy box if he doesn't follow the rules.\n\nAdam's toy box is in a place where lots of kids want to play with toys. He might find it tough to play with the best toys. Other kids might also have big toy boxes and want to play with the same toys. Some kids might have bigger toy boxes and more toys than Adam. They might even have toys that Adam doesn't have. Some kids might also be okay with playing with toys that could break, while Adam might not want to do that. Also, some kids might know the toy box rules better than Adam or they might not have to follow as many rules. The company we're talking about might have some trouble because other companies might be able to do more things, make more friends, and give better deals than this company can. Some new companies have just started, and they might make it harder for our company to find good chances to grow. If our company can't give as good a deal as other companies, it might miss out on good opportunities. Our company doesn't try to beat other companies by giving better interest rates. We think some other companies might be able to give loans with lower interest rates than our company can. When our company tries to buy existing loans, it usually tries to give the best price. If our company tries to match other companies' prices and deals, it might not make as much money, get lower returns, and have a higher chance of losing money. If our company has to match other companies' prices and deals, it might not be able to get good returns on its investments or might lose a lot of money. We think our company has an advantage because we believe there aren't enough traditional banks and other financial sources helping middle-market lending. If more companies or bigger companies start competing in this market, our company might have to accept worse deals. There's a big company that sometimes has to share good ideas with other groups guided by the same helper. Even though the helper tries to be fair, sharing can mean less good ideas for the big company. This might not be the best thing for the big company or for the people who own parts of it. Also, we don't know if a good idea will really turn out to be good when it's shared. If the big company doesn't get enough good ideas, it might not do well, and this can affect the people who own parts of it. There's no promise that the big company will always find and use the best ideas.\n\nThe success of the big company and how it grows depends on how well it can handle getting bigger. \n\nThe big company's growth and goals depend on the helper's ability to find, invest in, and watch over other companies that fit the big company's rules. Doing this without spending too much depends a lot on how the helper arranges the investment process, how well it can provide helpful and efficient services to the big company, and if it can get money on good terms. The helper has a lot of important jobs under their agreement and might also need to provide extra help to the companies in the big company's portfolio. The job of the Business Helper and its team can be hard. They might be too busy to help the Working Group grow. The Working Group and the Business Helper might need more helpers to grow. But, the new helpers might not be good at their jobs. If the Working Group can't grow well, our work and money could be hurt badly. \nThe special reward might make the Business Helper take big risks.\nThe special reward given to the Business Helper might make them take big risks. This could lead to more losses, especially when times are tough. The special reward is given based on how much the Working Group earns from its work. This might make the Business Helper use more resources to earn more. Also, since the regular reward is given based on how much the Working Group has, the Business Helper might want to use more resources for more work. This could increase the chance of not being able to pay back, which could hurt the value of the shares of the Working Group and, as a result, the value of the common shares.\nThe money given to the Money Helper might make them want to pick things that will only give them money later, even if that doesn't help the Big Group give money to their friends now. In these cases, the Big Group would count the money it would get later, but it wouldn't really get that money until later, if at all. But when figuring out how much extra money to give to the Money Helper, the Big Group counts this money it hasn't gotten yet. So, some of the extra money given to the Money Helper is based on money the Big Group may never get. Also, the extra part of the money given to the Money Helper might make them want to get their money faster or slower, which could change when and how much money the Big Group can give out.\n\nThe Big Group might have to give the Money Helper extra money even if the Big Group loses money.\n\nThe Money Helper gets extra money every season based on how much extra money the Big Group made that season (before they give the extra money to the Money Helper), if it's more than a certain amount. In a big company, if the value of everything it owns goes down, it's easier to reach a set goal. The big company can still pay extra money to the company that helps it make money, even if it loses money or the value of what it owns goes down in a certain time period. This can happen even if the big company loses money overall.\n\nThe big company also borrows money, which can make the chances of making or losing money bigger. This can make it riskier to invest in the big company. We think the big company will keep borrowing money to help it make investments. Usually, the big company is not allowed to borrow more money or issue any debt without getting the right permissions. In a big company, there are different groups of people who have a say. Some people lend money to the company and they have the first right to the company's things. If the company's things become less valuable, those who lent the money and the people who own parts of the company might lose more money. The same thing could happen if the company makes less money. This could make it hard for the company to share its earnings. Also, if the company has things it can't easily sell and it can't borrow more money, it might lose money. Borrowing money can be risky.\n\nHow well the company does with its borrowed money mostly depends on how well it's doing and what's happening around it. Sometimes, when a group of people handles money, they might decide to borrow more. This could help them get more things, but it could also make things harder for everyone else in the group. For example, if the people who manage the money borrow too much, the rest of the group might have to pay more. This is a bit like if your friend borrowed your toy and then lost it - you would be upset.\n\nA few years ago, the group had a lot of money to pay back. They had borrowed some from one place, and some from another place. The group needed to pay a small part of what they borrowed every year. \n\nThe group might need to find more money to grow bigger. They get money from different places, like when they sell things to other people. When they get money, they use it to buy more things. They might need to find more money to buy even more things. They could do this by selling more to other people. Sometimes, a big company needs extra money to keep growing. It can try to get this money by borrowing from banks, or by selling special items called 'securities'. But there are rules about this. The big company, let's call it the 'OC', can't just borrow any amount it wants. It needs permission from the people who lent it money before. It's a bit like when you borrow a toy from a friend, and you need to ask them before you can lend it to someone else.\n\nThere's another company, let's call it 'N', which can only own special items from the OC. If 'N' sells its own special items, it gives the money to the OC. But if things get tough, like when it's harder to find jobs, it can be more expensive for the OC and 'N' to get money. They might even have trouble getting loans from banks. \n\nBoth 'N' and another company, let's call it 'A', need to give most of their earnings to their stockholders. This is like when you win a game, and you need to share your prize with your team. Because of this, they can't use these earnings to get more money. If 'N' or the OC can't get money from selling securities or from banks, they might not be able to grow their business. This could make the value of 'N' and 'A' securities go down.\nThere's a big company that has some rules to follow from a group called the Credit Team. If the company doesn't follow these rules, it could be bad for our work. \n\nThe Credit Team has many rules. Some of these rules say the company can't borrow too much money or do some things without asking first. These rules also say what happens if the company's bosses change. If the company doesn't follow the rules, it might not be able to do some things that could help it grow. \n\nFor example, right now, the company can't borrow more money. But, if the Credit Team says it's okay, the company might be able to borrow money in different ways. Also, sometimes the company might not be able to give money to its members because of the rules. This could make two groups, called NM Group and AI Group, pay more taxes.\nIf rules aren't followed and mistakes aren't fixed in time, it could lead to big problems for the company. The people who lend money to the company might want their money back all at once. If this happens, the company might not have enough things to sell to pay back the money. This could cause a lot of trouble for the company. If one part of the company gets into trouble, it could cause problems for other parts of the company too. If the company can't follow the rules or fix problems, it might not be able to get help or make changes. It might also not be able to borrow money again on good terms, or at all.\n\nThe company might also make a special kind of deal. This deal is like a short-term loan where the company uses its things as a promise to pay back the money. The company will get a loan based on how much its things are worth. When it's time to pay back the loan, the company will get its things back.\nA big company uses things it owns to get money to buy more things. But it can be risky. Sometimes, the things it buys can lose value, meaning they are worth less than before. Also, if the company that gave it money goes broke, it could be a problem for our big company. If the big company spends more money than the things it bought are worth, that's also not good. Plus, it costs money to get money this way, so the big company's value can go down, and sometimes it might wish it hadn't bought more things.\n\nIf the big company can't get more money, or if it can't borrow as much as before, it could be a problem for our business.\n\nSometimes, the big company might want or need to borrow more money, maybe when it has to pay back its loans. This money could be used to buy more things. There is a big group of friends who have a set of rules they play by. They made a promise that they can't borrow more toys without asking first. But, their playtime ends on a special day. If they can't borrow more toys or find new ones on their own, they might not have enough toys to play with. Also, if they can't get permission to borrow more toys, they might not be able to play at all. If they can't give back the toys they borrowed, or if they can't find new toys, they might not be able to play their games or do their usual activities. Sometimes, things they can't control can stop them from playing their games. These things could be like not being able to find toys, their toys losing their fun, or something bad happening to their toys or their game. This could really hurt their fun time and their ability to play.\nSometimes, if things go wrong in the big money world, it can make things hard for our business. We need to keep finding more money to help our business grow. If we can't find more money, we might have to do less business and miss out on new chances to grow.\n\nIn the past, the big money world has had some ups and downs. This makes people unsure about what's going to happen next. When things go wrong, it can make it hard to buy and sell things in the big money world. If this keeps happening for a long time, we might have to give out fewer loans and the things we own might lose value.\n\nBad times can also make it more expensive for us to find money, make it harder for us to get into the big money world, or make the people who lend us money decide not to anymore. These problems could stop us from growing our business and make things harder for us.\n\nIf things keep going wrong in the big money world, and if new rules are made because of these problems, it could make it harder for us to do our business. This could make things tough for our business and change how well we do.\nImagine a big shop owned by Oliver. Oliver needs to have a lot of things in his shop for it to run well. But what if he doesn't have enough things? This could cause problems. For example, he might not be able to get new things for his shop or pay for the stuff he already has. This could make running his shop very hard. \n\nAlso, Oliver relies on his friends Adam and Alice to help him keep his shop stocked. If Adam and Alice can't help him, Oliver might have trouble getting the things he needs for his shop. \n\nIn the last few years, some shop owners found it hard to keep their shops full because not many people were willing to help them. This made running their shops difficult. \n\nLastly, if the cost of things changes, it might affect how much money Oliver has left after he pays for everything.\nImagine a company that needs to borrow money to buy things. How much money the company makes can depend on the difference between the rate at which it borrows money and the rate at which it uses that money. If the rates of borrowing and using money change a lot, this can affect the company's income. For instance, when the cost of borrowing money goes up, the company's income might go down. The company can use different ways to manage these changes in rates. \n\nThe company also has to pay a fee to another company for helping it with its investments. This fee can sometimes be more than 20.0%. This happens because of the way the fee is calculated. We can't tell how or if this fee calculation would affect your own savings or shares in a company.\n\nLastly, there's no guarantee that the company will get a license to form and run a special kind of company.\nA big company in the US, called \"US\", gave a \"go ahead\" letter to a company with the initials \"NM\". This letter said that NM could continue trying to get a special license to create a new smaller company. This new smaller company would help NM get more money for a long time. Even though they got the \"go ahead\" letter, it doesn't mean they'll definitely get the license. NM still doesn't know if they'll get the license or when they'll get it.\n\nThere's something important about how NM works. They have a plan to give enough money to the people who are part of the company. This plan is so that NM and another company, AI, can keep a special status. This special status is called \"RICs\". To keep this status, NM and AI need to give almost all their money to the people who own their company's shares. But to keep growing, NM will need more and more money. If they can't get this money, or if it's too expensive, it might be harder for NM to grow.\n\nNM and AI want to keep their special status and not have to pay extra taxes. To do this, they will give enough money to their members. This is so they can keep their status as RICs. NM and AI also plan to give almost all their money that they earn in a year to the people who own shares in their company. But, NM might keep some money to put back into the company. This would be like giving money to their shareholders. There is a big company named 'Nathan's Magic Fun Company' or NMFC for short. This company needs to follow some special rules. One of these rules says that if NMFC shares out any money, it has to pay taxes for its stockholders. Because of these rules, NMFC might need to find more money from other places to make its business bigger.\n\nThe company also has a part called the 'Operating Company'. This company has to follow a rule about how much money and things it has. It needs to have twice as much money and things as it owes. This means that the company can't owe more than half of what it has. All of the company's loans and any special membership units are included in this.\n\nThe Operating Company also has to include the money and things from another part, called 'NMF SLF', when it is checking to see if it is following the rule. Because NMFC and another part called 'AIV Holdings' only own parts of the Operating Company and don't have any other money or things, they use the Operating Company's money and things to make sure they are following the rule. \n\nThese rules limit how much the Operating Company can owe. Since the Operating Company still needs more money to make its business bigger, these limits might stop the Operating Company from owing money and make NMFC find more money at a time when it might not be good to do so. There's a big company that might need more money to help it grow. We hope it can borrow some or get extra money from selling parts of itself. However, we can't be sure that it will get the money it needs. Also, rules say that it can't sell parts of itself for less than it's worth without asking the people who own a piece of it. Another company doesn't plan to borrow any money or sell any parts of itself. If the big company can't get more money, it might have to stop making new investments. This could make the big company and the other company worth less.\nThe big company also has some rules about working with companies it's close to. It can't do certain things with these companies without asking some people in the company who don't have a personal interest in it, and sometimes even the big rule-makers need to say it's okay. If someone owns a lot of the big company, they're considered close to it. The big company can't usually buy or sell things from or to these close companies. The big company also can't make the same investment as a close company without asking some people in the company and sometimes the big rule-makers. Let's say there's a big group with a lot of people. If someone gets more than a quarter of the group's special tickets, the group can't trade any tickets (except their own) with that person or their friends, unless they get permission from the Important Ticket Group. The same rule applies if the group wants to do any trading with their group leaders or their friends. Because of these rules, the main part of the group might not be able to trade tickets with any other groups that are run by friends of the group's guide, without getting permission from the Important Ticket Group. This might limit what they can do.\n\nThe group's guide has a lot of things that might make them choose what's best for the big group over what's best for you. This could make the things you get from the group not as good.\n\nThe group's leaders, as well as the people who might guide the group in the future, work or might work for other groups that do the same things we do or for other groups run by friends of the big group. So, they might have things they need to do for those other groups, and those things might not be best for you. Right now, we're the only part of the Big Mountain group that mainly focuses on getting the things we want to get. But in the future, the people who guide the group and/or the Big Mountain workers who help out might guide other groups that sometimes want the same things we do. So, they might get things that are like the things we want to get. Imagine a big group called \"IN company\" that helps other smaller groups make important decisions about money. Sometimes, they might have to choose which smaller group gets to join in on a big decision. They try to be fair, but sometimes one group might get left out or another might get more chances.\n\nIn the future, \"IN company\" might make more new groups. They will have to follow important rules if they want to let two groups join in on a decision together. Also, the smaller groups give some of their money to \"IN company\" for helping them. This means that when people give their money to a smaller group, some of it goes to \"IN company\" too.\n\nBecause \"IN company\" gets money this way, they might want to make decisions that are more exciting or risky. This could be a problem because it might not be the best choice for the smaller groups. If \"IN company\" isn't careful, it could cause big problems for everyone involved.\nThe group of people who help decide where to put money might sometimes know secret things that change how they can use the money.\nThese same people might also help run companies that we put money into. Sometimes, they might find out secret things about these companies or not be allowed to buy or sell from these companies because of certain rules. If this happens, it could stop us from buying or selling for a while, and this could change things for the people who have put their money with us.\nDeciding the value of some things we put money into can be tricky.\nSome of the things we put money into are not sold where everyone can see. Because of this, the people who help run things decide what these things are worth. To do this, they use information from the companies we put money into and guess what might happen to these companies in the future. Also, one person who helps run things, we'll call him 'Samuel', also has a connection to the people who help decide where to put money. The people who help the big company make choices about money could have problems because they also make money from the choices they make. This could cause them to make choices that are good for them, but not for the big company. \n\nSometimes these problems can come from working with other companies that they are close to. The big company has agreed to use the name of another company for free. The big company also pays back the other company for things like rent and the cost of important workers. This could cause problems that the big company's leaders have to watch out for.\n\nThe big company made agreements with the people who help them make choices and with the other company, but these agreements were not made in a fair way because they know each other. The big company might not stand up for itself because it wants to keep a good relationship with these other companies. There is a big company named NM company and another one named AI company. They have to be very careful with their decisions because they have a responsibility to the people who own parts of their company. They have a helper, IA helper, who is supposed to guide them in making decisions. But the IA helper doesn't have to take the blame if something goes wrong, unless they were really careless or did something really bad. Also, if the IA helper gets into trouble because of their work, the company will help them, unless the IA helper did something really bad. There's a person named Isaac who helps make big decisions about money. Isaac can choose to stop doing this job with a 60-day warning. If Isaac leaves, it might be hard to find another person who can do the job as well as Isaac did. This could make things difficult for the company and could even make the company lose money.\n\nIsaac can quit his job anytime he wants to, with a 60-day warning. Even if no one can replace him, he can still leave. If Isaac leaves and no one can take his place, it could be really hard for the company to keep doing its job. The company might not be able to make as much money as before, and this could make everyone in the company worried. \n\nIf the company can't find someone else who knows what Isaac knows, it will be hard for them to keep everything running smoothly. Even if they find someone new, that person might not know everything about the company and it could take some time for them to learn. This could make things harder for the company and could even make the company lose money.\nAdam can stop doing his job with a notice of 60 days. If Adam leaves, it could be hard to find someone else who can do the job just as well. If we can't find a new person quickly, it might hurt our work and we might lose money. It might also make it hard for us to do all the things we need to do to keep our place running smoothly. If we do find someone, it might take them a while to learn everything they need to do, which could also hurt our work and make us lose money. \n\nIf our places, called NE and AV, can't keep up with the rules, we might not be able to do things the way we want to. We follow the rules set in the old times. There are some rules that companies need to follow. For instance, they have to use most of their money to buy certain types of things, like parts of other small companies or safe investments that can be turned into money quickly. If they don't follow these rules, they could get into trouble with the people who make sure companies play fair. Also, if the company's owners agree, the company can choose to not be this type of company anymore. But if they do that, or if they don't do things right, they could have to follow more rules. Following all these rules could make it harder for them to do business and cost them more money.\n\nIf the company doesn't use enough of its money to buy the right types of things, it might not be allowed to buy certain things or might have to sell some things. This could make things hard for the company and affect how much money it makes.\nThe company in our story can only buy special things called \"qualifying items\". They need to make sure at least 70.0% of all the things they own are these special items. In the future, they might want to buy things that are not these special items, but they can only do that if they follow certain rules. If they don't follow these rules, they might not be able to buy new things or they might have to sell some of their things at a bad time. This could make things hard for the company. They might have trouble finding someone to buy their things and they might have to sell them for less than they want. \nAlso, there are some rules about the company buying things from public companies. They can only do this in certain situations. To make sure they can keep doing what they do, they need to have at least 70.0% of their things as these special \"qualifying items\". They need to make sure of this each time they buy something new. There are only a few times when they can buy things that are not these special items. There's a company that plays a big game. It can only pick toys (which are like other smaller companies) to play with if those toys aren't too popular. The toys should not be worth more than 250 shiny coins. Certain rules guide how this company plays. These rules can affect if the company can get more toys or not, and this can change how the company plays its game.\n\nThe company needs a lot of toys to play its game. The company can get more toys in different ways, like asking for more toys or borrowing toys. But sometimes, the company may not be able to get more toys, even if it wants to. This can make playing the game difficult.\n\nThe company can also borrow toys from banks or other toy stores, which are called \"big toys\". But, it can only borrow up to a certain number of big toys. The big rule from a long time ago allows the Big Company to make more things if they have at least twice as many things already. The Big Company puts together all the things from the Big Company and NMF SLF to check if they have twice as many things. If the Big Company doesn't have twice as many things, they can't make more things, and if they have made things already, they can't give things to their friends. Also, NMFC and AIV Friends can't give things away. But, at the end of a year, the only things they made were from the Credit Helpers, so at the end of that year, the Big Company could still give things away. If the things from the Big Company or NMF SLF become less, the Big Company might not pass the test. If that happens, the Big Company or NMF SLF might have to sell some of their things and pay back some of the things they owe when it might not be the best time to sell.\nThe Credit Helpers will stop helping on a day in the fall and they let the Big Company borrow a lot of things till the end of a year. The money box had a lot of coins in it. Later, it is expected to have even more coins. But, if they can't find more coins, they might not be able to buy new toys. Sometimes, finding more coins can be hard and it might even cause them to lose some of their old toys. In the old days, there were rules that could change how a company shares its things with others. Let's imagine a company named \"NM\". This company might get more things to use by sharing more parts of itself. These parts are like pieces of a pie. But, there are some rules for \"NM\". It cannot share its pie pieces if they are less valuable than they should be. If the value of \"NM's\" pie pieces goes down, this rule could make it hard for the company to share more parts. But, \"NM\" can still share its pie pieces if the company's leaders and the people who own these pie pieces agree that it's the best thing to do. In this case, the value of the pie pieces should be close to what people think they are worth. If \"NM\" gets more things by sharing more pie pieces, the people who already own some pie pieces might own a smaller part of the company. This could make their pie pieces less valuable. A big company named \"OC\" (short for Operating Company) might get more money by selling more parts of itself. They would use this money to buy more things that can help them grow. The future of OC's work can depend on making friends with other companies. If the people working for OC can't make or keep these friends, or if these friends don't help OC find good things to invest in, it could hurt OC's plans.\nIf OC's workers can't keep their old friends or make new ones who can help OC find good things to invest in, OC might not be able to grow. The people who are friends with OC's workers don't have to help OC find things to invest in. So, there's no promise that these friends will always help OC.\nWe might see changes in how well OC does each year or each few months because of what OC does. There could be changes in how well OC does based on many things, some of which OC can't control. These things include how well OC can find good companies to invest in, how much interest they get from the money they lend to others, how much money they lose if people don't pay them back, how much OC spends, when they make or lose money, how much other companies are doing the same thing as OC, and how well everyone's money is doing in general. Sometimes, things can change and we can't always guess what will happen next. The people in charge of a big company might decide to change how they do things, and this could be good or bad. They can change how they use money, what their goals are, and many other things. But, there are rules that say they can't stop being a certain type of company or end the company without everyone agreeing. It's hard to guess what will happen if they change things. These changes could make it harder for them to share money with the people who have part of the company. If they don't follow some important rules, they might have to pay a lot of money in taxes, which would not be good for them.\nTwo big groups, let's call them 'A Group' and 'N Group', want to keep a special title that saves them from paying some taxes. To keep this title, they must follow certain rules about sharing their money, where their money comes from, and what they own. But, 'A Group' and 'N Group' only own parts of another big company, which we'll call 'O Company'. They can't do any other business or own anything else. So, they depend on 'O Company' for everything they need. \n\nEvery year, 'A Group' and 'N Group' need to share a big part of their money and gains with their members to keep their special title. 'O Company' and another company, let's call it 'N Company', borrow money to run their businesses, so they have to follow some extra rules. One of these rules is about how much they own compared to how much they owe. They also have to follow some other financial rules. There are some rules that the Big Company and the Little Company need to follow. Sometimes, these rules can stop the Big Company from sharing its goodies with the Little Company, or stop the Little Company from sharing its goodies with its friends. If the Little Company can't find goodies from other places and can't share enough goodies with its friends, the Big Company and another friend named 'A' might get into trouble.\n\nThere are two important rules. One rule is about where the goodies come from. This rule is followed if at least 9 out of 10 goodies that the Big Company and 'A' get from the Little Company come from special places like treats, gifts, goodies from selling things, or similar places.\n\nThe other rule is about what kinds of goodies the Big Company and 'A' can have. To follow this rule, at least half of their goodies need to be things like coins, paper money, special papers from the US government, special papers from other friends who also follow these rules, and other good stuff. But, they can't have more than 1 out of 4 of their goodies be special papers from one friend, from two or more friends who are controlled by them and who do the same kind of thing, or from certain \"big friends that everyone knows\". If the Big Company doesn't follow the rules, it might have to sell some things quickly to stop bad things from happening. This could be hard because what they own are mostly private companies that are not easily sold. So, they might have to sell at low prices and lose a lot of money.\n\nPeople think the Big Company can count the things they own as part of what they need to follow the rules. But there's no guarantee. The rule makers might say that the Big Company doesn't meet the requirements because they can't use what the private companies own to meet the rules. If this happens, the Big Company would have to pay a lot of taxes.\n\nIf the Big Company can't follow the rules or keep their special status, and they can't get help from some special rules in the law, they would have to pay a lot of taxes. If this happens, they would have less money, less income to share, and less to give out. This could make the Big Company do poorly.\nLet's say you have a piggy bank with some coins in it. This piggy bank is like a \"NMFC\" that you own. Sometimes, you get more coins to put in the piggy bank. This is like the extra shares of \"NMFC\" you get. But, if you choose to get more coins for your piggy bank, you might have to give some candies (which is like paying tax) from your candy jar. \n\nYou can choose whether you want to get more coins for your piggy bank or not. If you don't want to, you have to tell this to the person who gives you the coins (like the plan administrator) before the next time they are going to give you the coins. \n\nRemember, even if you get more coins for your piggy bank, the person who gives you the coins (like \"NMFC\" and \"AIV Holdings\") might not always be able to give you more coins. They also might not be able to give you more and more coins over time. Sometimes, the coins they give you might be coins you already had (like a return of capital for tax purposes).\n\nThey will try their best to give you coins (like quarterly distributions) from the money they have. But they cannot promise that they will always be able to give you the same amount of coins or more coins every year. Suppose there's a big company, let's call it 'OC'. If OC can't follow some important rules, or if it breaks promises about borrowing things, it might not be able to share its earnings with its helpers. This could also affect two other groups, let's call them 'N' and 'A', and their ability to share earnings with their helpers.\n\nThe decision to share earnings is made by the leaders of OC. It depends on how much OC earns, how well it's doing, if N and A are following certain rules, if OC is following borrowing promises, and other things that the leaders think are important.\n\nSometimes, the amount N and A give to their helpers can be more than what they earned in a year. This means that some of what they give back might be considered as returning what was originally given, rather than sharing what they earned.\n\nAlso, since N and A are groups that hold things for OC, they can only share earnings they get from OC. OC plans to share enough earnings with its helpers so N and A can also share earnings with their helpers every three months, and keep their special status. But, there's no promise that OC will always be able to share earnings. So, N and A can't promise you that they will always be able to share earnings with you.\nAdam and Alice may find it hard to share their toys if they count their toys before actually getting them. Sometimes, they might count toys that they don't have yet, like a toy promised as a reward or a birthday gift that's coming. This can happen if they promise each other a toy in exchange for a favor or in other situations. They count these promised toys even before they actually get them. They might also count toys that they will never get.\n\nBecause sometimes they count toys that they don't have yet, they might find it hard to share their toys equally. They might need to give away some of their favorite toys, or they might need to ask for more toys. They might even miss out on getting new toys or have to do things they don't like just to make sure they have enough toys to share. There's a group of friends. They need to share their toys to keep the playtime fun. If they can't share, they might lose some of their playtime. \n\nNow, imagine if one friend can't share enough toys. Then, their friend, Adam, agrees to pretend he got enough toys. But Adam doesn't really have more toys, he's just pretending.\n\nSometimes, the rules of the game can change. This might make it harder for the friends to play. The rules decide what toys they can use. If the rules change a lot, it could make their playtime less fun. Sometimes, the rules about what a company can do with its money might change. This could make the company change how it uses its money. They might start doing things they don't know much about. This can make things tough for the company, and it might make your money worth less.\n\nOn a big day in the middle of summer a few years ago, a new law was made. This law made a lot of changes, but we still don't know everything it will do. This law, along with other ideas that are being talked about, might make it harder for the company to do its work. It might cost the company more money, make people watch the company more closely, or change how the company does its work.\nIn recent times, some people who lend money but are not banks have been watched more closely by the people in charge. This could mean new rules for them. We don't know what these new rules will be, but they could make things harder for these money lenders. They might have to spend more money, or have people watching what they do more closely. This could make it harder for them to do their job.\n\nChanges in our world's weather could also make things tough for some businesses. Some signs show that our weather is changing. This could be a problem because it can cause physical and money troubles. For instance, if our weather changes, people might use more or less energy like electricity. Changes in weather can affect how much energy costs, and that could make it more expensive for businesses to do their work. If people use less energy because of the weather, some businesses might not make as much money. Also, really bad weather can cause lots of troubles, like service breaks, and that can cost extra money. There are big companies that could get into trouble because they let out a lot of bad gases that hurt our planet. This could happen through people asking them for money because they hurt the planet, or the leaders of the land asking them to pay more money or follow new rules.\n\nThere is also talk about a new rule that could let the Big Company borrow more stuff than before. Right now, the Big Company can't borrow too much. But if the new rule is agreed on, then the Big Company could borrow more. This could make it riskier for people who have bought bits of the Big Company.\n\nBeing a big company that people can buy bits of also costs a lot of money. The Big Company has to pay for things like lawyers and accountants. They also have to follow a lot of rules, which can cost more money. This is all paid for by the Big Company.\nThere are some important rules that big companies have to follow. These rules help make sure that everything is fair and honest. But these rules can be hard to follow and can take a lot of time and money. If a company doesn't follow these rules, it could be a big problem.\n\nThese rules also say that the companies have to check their own work. They have to make sure they are doing everything right. This can take a lot of time and money too. If they find something wrong, they have to fix it. Sometimes, this can make things difficult for the company.\n\nSo, these rules can be hard and can cost a lot of money. But they are important to make sure that everything is fair and honest. The company needs to follow certain rules. If they don't, things might not go well for them. The value of their things might go down. \n\nThe company needs computers a lot for their work. If the computers stop working, this could be a problem. It might make the value of their things go down. They might not be able to give money to the people who own parts of the company.\n\nThe company uses a lot of computers and communication systems. If these stop working, it could cause problems. The company might not do as well. This could make the value of their things go down. They might not be able to give money to the people who own parts of the company. \n\nAlso, the company works with other companies that use computers and other technology a lot. If something bad happens, like a big storm or a problem with the computers, it could stop their work. This could cause problems and make the value of their things go down. \n\nThere are some risks with what the company does.\nThe Company puts money into smaller companies, but this can be very risky. Sometimes, the Company might lose all the money it puts into these smaller businesses. This kind of risk can get even bigger during times when the money situation in the country is not stable. \n\nThese smaller companies can face a lot of problems, like:\n\n- They might not have enough money and could fail to pay back their debts. If this happens, the Company might lose any extra money it could have made from its investment.\n- These companies are usually newer, with fewer products and customers, which makes them more likely to be affected by what their competitors do or by changes in the market.\n- They often rely on a small group of people to run the company. So, if one of these people leaves or can't work anymore, it could hurt the Company's investment.\n- These smaller companies can face unexpected problems, can be involved in legal issues, or can be in businesses that change quickly and whose products might soon be out-of-date.\nSome businesses need more money to help them grow or stay ahead of others. They often don't share a lot of information about how they work or how well they're doing. Sometimes, people from one company help another company by joining their team. But if something goes wrong, they might have to spend time and money to fix it.\n\nThis company likes to help other businesses that most people don't know about. This can be tricky because there isn't a lot of information about these businesses. So, the company has to trust its expert team to find out enough about these businesses to decide if they're a good choice to help. If they can't find out everything, they might choose to help a business that ends up not doing well. Also, these little-known businesses usually only sell a few things and aren't as well known as bigger companies. This means they might struggle if things get tough and their results might change a lot. There can be problems that make it hard for our Company to earn money. \nOur Company has put a lot of its money into a few types of businesses. If one of these types of businesses has trouble, it could make our Company lose a lot of money. For example, we have put a lot of money into software, learning, business help, and moving things from one place to another. If any of these types of businesses has trouble, it could make the companies we put money into lose money. This could make our Company earn less money.\n\nAlso, companies that make software can have troubles. They might only make a few things and not sell a lot. As new technology comes, the money they make from selling their products might go down over time. The same thing can happen to the companies we put money into.\n\nAdditionally, learning companies have to follow a lot of rules. These rules can change, and it can make it harder for them to get help from the government or can make it cost more for them to follow the rules. Just like how a rainy day can make us feel sad, companies in the city of \"Business Services\" (BS city) can have hard times when the economy is not doing well. They might not make as much money and things can get tough. \n\nIn another city called \"Distribution & Logistics\" (DL city), things can be even trickier. They have to follow many rules about airplanes, trucks, keeping the environment clean, keeping people safe, and treating workers fairly. These rules are not just in the US, but in other countries too. Also, big changes in the weather or new rules about the climate can affect them. If the cost to use energy goes up or down, that can change things too. \n\nIf a city where the Big Company has put a lot of money is having a bad time, it could hurt the Big Company. The Big Company might not make as much money, and that could make things difficult for it.\n\nThe Big Company sometimes gives money without asking for anything in return. But, these kinds of gifts might not bring enough money back to the Big Company. \n\nSometimes, the Big Company gives money without asking for anything right away. But, the person or company that got the money might have other things to pay for first. This can be risky because if that person or company is having a hard time, they might not be able to pay back the Big Company. If the Big Company gives money to a company that already owes a lot of money, it might be hard for that company to pay back the Big Company.\nSometimes, a big company might put its money in businesses that are having a hard time or are not doing well. This can be risky because the big company might not get any money back from these struggling businesses. \n\nFrom time to time, the big company may also put its money in other things that are not its main focus. For instance, it might invest in businesses that are struggling or even not able to pay their debts. This is usually seen as a risky move. When a business cannot pay its debts, it may take a long time to figure out how to pay it back. During this time, the big company might not receive any money back. \n\nFurthermore, the big company might face problems because it can't easily sell its investments. The big company usually puts its money in businesses whose stocks are not sold to the public. These stocks are hard to sell because there are rules that restrict their sale, or there are not many people willing to buy them. If the big company needs to sell these investments quickly, it might not get as much money as it hoped for. \n\nThese investments are usually hard to sell because there's no established market for them. Because most of the big company's investments are hard to sell, it might not be able to sell them when it needs to, or it might not be able to sell them at a good price. This could lead to losses for the big company.\nIf lots of people don't want to buy or sell something, like toys, it can make the price go down. This can also make the stuff that the Big Toy Company has worth less. The Big Toy Company has to say how much all its stuff is worth. If it can't find a price, it has to guess a fair price. Because the Little Toy Company only owns parts of the Big Toy Company and doesn't make or sell anything itself, how much the Little Toy Company is worth depends on how much the Big Toy Company's stuff is worth. The Big Toy Company looks at a lot of things to guess a fair price for its stuff:\n* how much similar toys are selling for;\n* how much a toy company is worth;\n* what kind of stuff a toy company has and how much it can sell for;\n* if a toy company can pay its bills and how much money it can make;\n* where a toy company sells its toys; and\n* if changes in things like how much it costs to borrow money might change how much similar toys might sell for in the future and other important things.\nWhen something big happens, like when a toy is sold, the Big Toy Company will use the price from that sale to help it guess a fair price for its stuff. A company named \"O\" keeps track of changes in the worth of things it owns. Sometimes, the worth of these things can go down. This can happen if the value of money or the ability to sell these things becomes less. If this happens a lot, it can make \"O\" company's overall worth go down. This can also affect the worth of other companies named \"N\" and \"A\" because they have shares in \"O\" company. \n\nIf the worth of these things continues to go down, \"O\" company might lose a lot of money. If this happens, it can make it hard for \"O\" company to do its business, make money, and have enough money to spend on things it needs.\n\nSometimes, \"O\" company invests more in the things it already owns to try to make them worth more or keep their value. This is like buying more pieces of a toy to make it bigger or better. But sometimes, \"O\" company might not have enough money to do this or might choose not to do it. Whether \"O\" company can do this depends on how much money it has. Sometimes, a big company may not invest more money in a smaller company it's helping. This can be because the big company doesn't have enough money, or it doesn't want to take more risks, or there are rules that stop it from investing more. This can be a problem because the smaller company might need more money to keep going and do well.\n\nThe big company usually gives money to the smaller company and expects to get paid back later. But the smaller company might also borrow money from other places. Sometimes, this borrowed money has to be paid back before the big company gets its money back. \n\nIf the smaller company gets into trouble and has to close down, the people who lent money to the smaller company usually get their money back first. The big company might not get any money back at all. Imagine a big company called OC. It gives money to smaller companies to help them grow. But sometimes, these small companies can't pay OC back because they use all their money to pay other people they owe money to first. If the small company has problems and needs to close down, OC might only get some of its money back, not all of it.\n\nOC also buys parts of these small companies. But when it sells these parts, it might have to promise that everything it knows about the small company is true. If something is not true, OC might have to give money back to the people who bought the parts. This could happen even if OC already spent the money it got from selling the parts.\n\nSometimes, OC's money might not be the first to be paid back if the small company has problems. This could happen even if OC tried to make sure its money would be the first to be paid back. A court could decide that other people get their money back before OC does. The Company could get in trouble if it does things that affect a helper's business or when it takes charge of the helper. Sometimes, the Company might have to face issues because of actions it took while trying to help a lot.\n\nWhen the Company lends things to its helpers, it might not always be the first one to get its stuff back if the helper cannot return it. There might not be enough things left for the Company to get back after the first helper returns the borrowed items.\n\nSometimes, the Company will lend things to its helpers and use the same things as a promise for returning what they borrowed. The first helpers who borrowed will be the first ones to get their promises back. They control when and how to return the promises. Also, how much the promise is worth when returning depends on different things like how many buyers are there and how the market is doing. There's no promise that there would be enough left after the first helpers get their promises back for the Company to get its promise back. Imagine a group of people named 'Operating Company'. They lend toys to their friends (called 'portfolio companies') and sometimes they use things like marbles or toy cars as 'collateral' which means if the friend can't give the toy back, Operating Company can keep the marbles or toy cars.\n\nBut, if the friend has already promised the marbles or toy cars to someone else (like a 'first priority senior debt' holder), the Operating Company might not get to keep them. This is decided by a rule called an 'intercreditor agreement'. \n\nUnder this rule, the person who the friend promised the marbles or toy cars to first can decide when and how to get them. The Operating Company can't change these rules, even if they don't like them.\n\nThe Operating Company can't tell their friends what to do all the time. Even if they are allowed to watch or give advice, and even if there are rules about what the friends can do with the toys, Operating Company doesn't control what the friends do most of the time. Sometimes, a Big Company can have problems because the smaller companies it has put money into might make choices that the Big Company doesn't agree with. These smaller companies might also do risky things that aren't good for the Big Company. Because the Big Company's money is tied up in these smaller companies, it might not be able to take its money out quickly or at a good price. This could make the Big Company's investments worth less.\n\nAlso, if the economy is not doing well, or if the government spends less money, it could hurt the smaller companies and therefore the Big Company. This is because the smaller companies may not be able to pay back the money they owe during tough economic times. The Big Company's investments might not do well and become worth less. Bad economic conditions might also make it harder for the Big Company to get more money, and the people who lend money might decide not to lend to the Big Company. Sometimes, things can happen that stop the Big Company from growing and doing well. \nAlso, it can be very hard to guess how much the leaders of the US country will want to spend in the future. If they decide to spend less money, this can cause problems. Sometimes, they might have to spend less money on everything, which is called \"cutting back\". This could mean they spend less money on things they are already paying for and new things too. This could cause problems for the Big Company. \nMany companies that the Big Company works with help the leaders of the US country. If these leaders change what they want to spend money on, or if they take a long time to give out money, this could cause problems for these companies. \nMany companies that the Big Company works with get a lot of their money from the leaders of the US country. It can be very hard to guess how much these leaders will want to spend in the future. There's a big box of money that gets shared out for different things. Sometimes, there might not be enough money to go around. This can happen in the country called the US. A few years ago, they had to cut down on the money they were spending. This could happen again, which would mean less money for everyone. Even if they don't have to cut down again, there might be less money because people are worried about how much the US owes. This could mean less money for companies that work for the US government.\n\nSometimes companies can't do what they promised. If a company can't do what it promised, it might not be able to pay back its loans. This could cause problems for other companies too. If this happens, then someone will need to step in and help sort things out. This might mean changing the rules a bit. But this can also cost more money. Sometimes, when a helper gets too involved in a friend's problems, they might end up being blamed for some of those problems. This could happen to our company, especially if we try to give too much help to the friends we lend money to. If one of our friends gets into big trouble and has to ask for protection, we might not get our money back before other people they owe money to, even if we were supposed to be first in line. \n\nSometimes, our friends might give us our money back sooner than we thought. This could change how much money our company makes. \n\nOur company might lend money to our friends, but they could pay us back before we thought they would. When this happens, we would usually put this money in a safe place until we find new friends to lend to. This safe place doesn't give us as much money as lending to our friends does. It might take us a long time to find new friends to lend to, and they might not give us back as much money as our old friends did. Imagine a big, strong tree called the \"Big Tree Company\". This tree has many branches, which are its many parts. Sometimes, these parts have to pay back the tree. But if they pay back too soon, it could make the tree not as strong. This could make the tree less valuable.\n\nSometimes, the Big Tree Company gets seeds from other trees. It hopes these seeds will grow into strong trees too. But sometimes, these seeds don't grow well or at all. This means the Big Tree Company might not get more trees from these seeds. If a seed does grow into a tree, it might not be enough to make up for the seeds that didn't grow.\n\nAlso, the parts of the Big Tree Company might not do as well as they did before. This is because the tree is now growing more seeds on its own, instead of getting them from other trees.\nLong ago, the Big Company had a plan to mostly buy things from the second-hand market. Later, the Big Company decided to also make more things on its own. Making things and buying things can be risky, but the Big Company may face different risks based on what it decides to do. \n\nMaking things takes a lot of time and effort, which might use up a lot of the Big Company's resources. Also, it's harder to decide how much these things are worth because there aren't many similar things to compare with. This means the Big Company might need help from another company to decide the value of these things. This could cost more money and the value of these things might change a lot. This new plan might make the Big Company earn different amounts of money than before. \n\nIf the Big Company decides to invest in things from other countries or do things to protect itself from risks, it might face more risks. \n\nThere are rules that say 70.0% of the Big Company's investments need to be in companies that are based in places like any state of the UN city, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands or any other possession of the UN city. The Company doesn't usually buy things from companies outside of the NE country. But, it might want to do that in the future if it's allowed. The Company thinks that buying stuff from outside will be like what it does in the NE country and will be good for its plan. But, buying things from other countries might be risky. There can be new rules about money, problems in the country, taxes, it can be harder to buy things, it can cost more, there might not be as many rules, laws might not be as good, it might be hard to make sure people do what they say, things might not be counted the same way, and prices might change a lot. Also, if the Company buys things with another country's money, it might lose money if that money's value changes. There are a lot of things that can change the value of money, like how much stuff a country sells and buys, how much interest money gets in the short term, how much things are worth in different money, chances to invest and make money in the long term, and what's going on in the country's politics. The Company might try to protect itself from these risks, but it can't promise that it will or that it will work.\nLet's say a company, like a piggy bank, has many different kinds of money. Sometimes, the company might want to protect this money from getting less valuable. This is like putting a shield around the money. But, even with a shield, the money can still become less valuable if something unexpected happens. The shield can also stop the money from becoming more valuable.\n\nAlso, sometimes it's hard to put a shield around the money. This could be because everyone already knows something might happen that will make the money less valuable. So, the company might decide not to use a shield at all. But, even if the company uses a shield, it might not work the way they want it to. This could make the company lose money.\n\nAlso, the company might use the shield to protect against money becoming less valuable because of changes in how much things cost in different countries or how much banks charge to borrow money. But if these things change in a way the company didn't expect, it could make the company's money less valuable. This could happen even if the company used a shield. Sometimes, when we try to match the changes in the value of things we have with the changes in the value of things we use to protect them, it might not work perfectly. This could happen because of different reasons. If this matching is not perfect, it could mean that we may lose some things. Also, we might not be able to protect things from changes in the value of money from different countries. This is because the value of these things can change because of reasons that have nothing to do with the value of money.\n\nThere are also worries about how a certain number is calculated. This number is used to decide the value of things that change with time. Some people have said that the banks that help decide this number might not be telling the truth. They might be doing this to gain more or to avoid looking like they don't have enough or to avoid a bad name. Some of these banks have agreed to make things right with those who make rules and those who make sure rules are followed because of these untruths. The people who make rules and those who make sure rules are followed are still looking into this.\nThere's a big group called BBA and some others who might decide to change how LIBOR works. LIBOR is something that helps decide how much money people make from certain things they own. If LIBOR changes, it could make things tricky for people who own these certain things. Also, if LIBOR changes a lot or changes really quickly, it could make these things less valuable.\n\nLet's also talk about two other groups, which we'll call N and A. N and A don't really do anything on their own. They rely on another group, which we'll call O, to help them with what they need. N and A only own pieces of O, and that's all they do. \n\nO makes decisions about what to do with the things it owns. There's a group of people who help make these decisions for O. But these people might not be the same people who help N and A. \n\nN and A can share their opinions on some things, but they don't really have any control over what O does every day. This means that the people who own pieces of N and A also don't have much say in what O does.\nThere are three friends: Nathan, Alice, and the Big Company. Nathan and Alice can't make money on their own. Their pocket money comes only from the Big Company. So, they need the Big Company to pay for things they need every day. \n\nAccording to their agreement, the Big Company will pay back the Money Manager for the share of the costs that Nathan and Alice owe. But if the Big Company can't or doesn't want to pay the Money Manager, Nathan and Alice might not be able to pay for their needs.\n\nAlso, because Nathan and Alice are like money holders, they can only give gifts to their friends when the Big Company gives them enough money first. The Big Company giving money to Nathan and Alice has some rules, because of some big laws and the agreement they signed. These rules might stop the Big Company from giving money. Also, the gifts and fee payments will depend on how well the Big Company is doing with its money. There is a big company that shares its money with all its members. This includes two smaller groups named 'N' and 'G'. 'G' owns a small part of the big company. Sometimes, what 'N' and 'G' want might not be the same as what you want. \n\nThere might be times when what the big company wants is not the same as what 'N's members want. The people who make decisions for both the big company and 'N' are the same. But, they might have to make decisions that are good for the big company but not good for 'N'.\nThere are things that might make the value of a company's shares go up and down a lot. These things can change how much people want to buy the shares. Some of these things the company can't control. They might not have anything to do with how well the company is doing. Some of these things could be:\n\n- If the prices of lots of shares are going up and down a lot.\n- How much people want to buy the company's shares.\n- If the prices and amount of shares of other companies like banks are going up and down a lot. This doesn't always have to do with how well these companies are doing.\n- If the company can't get more money by selling shares.\n- If the company can't borrow money or use its money well.\n- If the amount of money the company gets or the company's income changes a lot.\n- If the company isn't doing as well as other similar companies.\n- If the rules or taxes for companies like this one change.\n- If the company can't work like this type of company anymore.\n- If the company isn't doing well, or if people think it might not do well in the future.\nHere's what we need to know: \n\nA company's investments can change in value. This can depend on lots of things, like what's happening in the world or if important people leave the company. If the company loses a big source of money, this can also change things. \n\nThe company has to follow certain rules so it can stay on an important list. In the past, the company didn't follow a rule about telling people about something special they were doing. If the company doesn't follow the rules and gets taken off the list, it could be harder for people to buy and sell the company's shares.\n\nBuying shares in the company can be risky. The company might make choices that could lead to more risk or loss than other options. This means that buying shares in the company might not be the best choice for people who don't like taking risks. \n\nIf a lot of the company's shares are sold, it could make the price of the shares go down. This could happen if the company sells a lot of shares, or if other big groups decide to sell their shares. If people think this might happen, it could also make the price of the shares go down. A company named AIV Holdings is planning to sell its part of another company's business. This will happen when the time is right and the conditions are good. If AIV Holdings gets paid with special units, they can ask the company NMFC to help them sell any shares they have of NMFC. \n\nPlus, NMFC has given AIV Holdings, the head of the other company, a connected group, and others the chance to sell their shares whenever NMFC sells its shares. This could be during a new or another type of offering. They will have the first chance to do this. But, if people think this is going to happen, it could make NMFC's shares less valuable. This might make it harder for NMFC to sell shares and get money to run the other company's operations.\nThere are some rules that might make it hard for people to buy all of a company called \"N Company\". These rules can also limit what \"N Company\" can do, like selling things they own, borrowing more money, or joining with other companies. If someone tries to take over \"N Company\", they might have to pay back all their loans quickly. Also, there's a big group called \"G Group\" that owns a lot of \"N Company\", which might stop other people from wanting to buy it. \nPeople can buy parts of \"N Company\" called shares. Sometimes, people pay less for these shares than they're really worth. This happens a lot with companies like \"N Company\". Because of some tough times and problems in the money world, \"N Company\" shares have been worth less than they should be since they first started selling them many years ago. This might happen again in the future. The chance of \"N Company\" shares being worth less than they should be is different from the risk of \"N Company\" losing value. The Big Business can't tell if the value of its special shares will go up, stay the same, or go down. If the special shares are worth less than what they should be, the Big Business can't make more without asking its members and leaders. If there's no more money for the Working Group, the Big Business might have to stop or slow down new projects. This could make the Big Business worth less and affect how much it gives back to its members.\n\nYou might not get any rewards or the rewards might get smaller or not grow over time.\n\nThe Big Business can't promise it will do well or keep a certain status that will allow or need a certain amount of rewards or growth in rewards each year. Especially, the rewards from the Working Group, and in turn, from the Big Business, rely on how much they earn from their projects. If this income goes down, they might not be able to give future rewards.\n\nIf the Big Business makes preferred shares, the value of its special shares might change a lot.\n\nWe can't promise that making preferred shares would mean more earnings for the special share holders. Imagine you have two types of toys - special toys and regular toys. If you start getting more special toys, the number of your regular toys may change a lot more. If the special toys become too important, the regular toys might not seem as fun. But if the special toys become even more important than the fun you have with your regular toys, you might not enjoy your regular toys as much as before. If you lose some of your regular toys, you will feel sadder than if you didn't have any special toys. If the fun of all your toys goes down, you might feel even sadder about your regular toys. We might be in trouble of not having enough special toys, or of the special toys not being as good as they were. In a really bad case, we might not have enough fun to enjoy our special toys. If something like this happens, we might need to give away some special toys to make things better. Imagine a big company. They have two types of shares - normal ones and special ones. The company has to spend money to keep these special shares going. People who have these special shares might want different things than people who have normal shares. \n\nThose who have the special shares might have a big say in what the company does. They could even choose who gets to be in charge of the company. \n\nImagine if the company didn't give money (called dividends) to the special shareholders for two whole years. Those special shareholders would then get to choose most of the people in charge until they got their money. \n\nAlso, the special shareholders get to vote on some important changes in the company. So, they can stop any changes they don't like. There are rules about when the company can give out dividends to the special and normal shareholders. These rules could make it hard for the company to keep its special tax status. \n\nThe company might have to buy back the special shares to keep its special tax status. But, there's no guarantee they can do this in time.\nWe don't have any big buildings or lands that are really important for our work. Our main office is in a tall building in the NE city. We share this office with some other people. We think this office is just right for our work.\n\nSometimes, we may have to go to court because of our work. This is normal for us. Right now, we don't think this will cause big problems for our work or money. \n\nWhen we say \"we\" or \"us\", we are talking about our team. \n\nWe also talk about something called \"common stock\". This is something that people can buy and sell. Our common stock is bought and sold at a place called NYSE. This is a list about the worth of a company's shares. It shows the highest and lowest selling price of the shares. It also shows how much money the company gives back to its share owners every three months. This list starts from when the company first started selling shares to the public on a special day. It shows how the worth and prices have changed over time.\nThis is a story about a group of numbers that lived in the land of Math. Each group of numbers came from a different season. The first group came from the beginning of the year, and their leader was 14.05. They had a little challenge and their strength decreased by 2.14%. The second group came from the end of the year, and their leader was 13.60. They also faced a challenge and their strength decreased by 1.40%. The third group was from the middle of the year, and their leader was 13.32. They had a small increase in strength by 0.38%. The last group came after the third group, and their leader was 14.25. They had a challenge too and their strength decreased by 4.91%. \n\nAll these groups of numbers lived happily in the land of Math until a special day. On this day, a new group of numbers joined them. This group was not very strong at first, but they slowly grew. These numbers also had a special day when they got a little extra strength. This special day happened at the end of summer.\nThere was a company that had some money to give to its friends. They said, \"We will give you 34 cents for every share you have at the end of the year, and a special gift of 14 cents for every share at the beginning of next year. We also have another special gift of 23 cents for every share in the middle of the year, and again 34 cents for every share in the middle of the year.\"\n\nThe company was not for everyone to join. It had a big sister company and a little brother company. The big sister company's price was $14.79 for every share. The big sister company had one friend, who was the company itself, and many other friends who had shares. The little brother also had one friend who was a guardian.\n\nThe company and its siblings were like parents. They got gifts from the big company and then gave those gifts to their friends. They wanted to give enough gifts to their friends every season and also keep their status as special companies. They also wanted to give almost all of their gifts from the big company to their friends every season and almost all of their gifts in a year, but they may keep some for themselves to use later.\nThere's a big group called NM, and they have a plan for their friends. This plan says that when NM gives out pocket money, it will be turned into more pieces of the NM group, unless the friend wants to keep the pocket money. So, more pocket money means more pieces of NM.\n\nHow does NM do this? If the new pieces of NM cost more than a lot of their worth, NM will only use new pieces for the plan. They find out how many new pieces a friend gets by dividing their pocket money by the cost of each NM piece. The cost of the NM piece is decided by its last known price. If NM uses new pieces for the plan, they will get more pieces of a bigger group in return for the pocket money that's turned into NM pieces.\nWhen a company named N wants to give more shares to the people who already have shares, sometimes they have to decide if they will make new shares or buy some from the market. If they buy from the market, they will share them out to people based on how much they cost, without adding any extra costs. They can't know exactly how many shares will be out there until they decide how much each new share will cost and find out what the people who already have shares want to do. A company named A doesn't want to use its earnings to get more shares. \nThere is also some extra information in a special place called \"Item 8\" about how they handle money and shares. \n\nHere is a list of times when the company decided to give out money to the people who have shares:\n- They decided on November 8 and gave out $0.34 per share on December 31, 2013.\n- They decided on August 7 and gave out $0.34 per share on September 30, 2013.\n- They decided again on August 7 and gave out $0.12 per share on August 30, 2013.\nThere were many special days when something interesting happened. On one day, something special happened because of the work done by a group named \"YP Equity Investors\". On another day, there was a special event that was planned to help a group named \"NMFC\" save on their taxes. There was also a day when something special occurred because of the work done by two groups named \"Lawson Software, Inc.\" and \"Infor Lux Bond Company\".\n\nThere were also many days when important decisions were made by a group of people who were in charge. On one day, they decided to give away some money. On another day, they decided to give away even more money. And on one exciting day, they decided to give away a lot of money. These were important days because the decisions made on these days helped a lot of people.\nThere were many days when things happened. These things were important and they changed how things worked. A company called AH company had many parts. The company got some money and then they shared that money with the people who were part of the company. This money did not include the money that another company, called GA company, got from something they sold.\nAdam's company had a lot of shares in another big company. Adam's company got money as a gift because they had these shares. Then, the bosses of Adam's company decided to give the same amount of money as a gift to the people who also had shares in Adam's company. But this does not include the big gift that Adam's company gave to Guardian Adam's company from the money they got when they sold some of their shares. \n\nAdam's company again had more shares in the big company. They got money as a gift and the bosses of Adam's company decided to give the same amount of money as a gift to the people who had shares in Adam's company. They also gave a big gift to Guardian Adam's company from the money they got when they sold some of their shares. \n\nThey gave out the money gifts on a special day in the springtime. \n\nBut this does not include the big gift that Adam's company gave to Guardian Adam's company from the money they got when they sold some of their shares. \n\nThey gave out the money gifts on a special day at the start of the year. \n\nBut this does not include the big gift that Adam's company gave to Guardian Adam's company from the money they got when they sold some of their shares. \n\nThey gave out the money gifts on a special day in the summertime.\nThere were some companies that shared their earnings with the people who owned parts of them. These earnings were told to the owners at the end of the year. In the future, these companies may do the same thing. They will decide if they want to do this.\n\nSometimes, companies sell parts of themselves. This is called selling equity. In a certain year, we did not do this.\n\nSometimes, a company will buy back parts of itself. This is also about equity. In a certain three months, one company did not do this.\n\nThere's a picture that shows how well a company's part is doing compared to other parts. This picture looks at three different things over a certain time. It imagines if someone spent the same amount of money on each thing. The picture shows how much money the person would have now. It thinks about how the price changed and how much money was shared. It thinks the shared money was used to buy more of the same thing.\n\nThere's also a comparison of how much total return a company's part, and two other things have made.\nThis part of the big book talks about important money details. It's not asking anyone for anything and doesn't have to follow strict rules. The picture about how our money changes over time doesn't tell us exactly what will happen in the future.\n\nNext, we have some special money information. This information helps us understand other money details and talks we have in this book. It tells us about what happened in the last five years. All this information comes from our big money book checked by a group called 'D', who are really good at this.\n\nBelow, we have more special money details for our company. These details include how much money we made and how much we spent. Sometimes, we made more money and sometimes less. Sometimes, we even lost some money. But that's okay, it's all part of how a company works.\nThe numbers show how things changed. For example, the total things they had went up and down between 78,924, 73,996, 31,677, 63,792, and 125,680. Each unit had a value of around $14. The things they had also went up and down, and so did the gifts they gave out. The total things they had were a lot, like 1,147,841, 1,025,564, 730,579, 460,224, and 330,558. They also had some things from H place and S place. The total things they had after everything were also a lot. They had a good return on their things, which went up to 76.38%. They had a lot of different things at the end of the year, like 59, 63, 55, 43, and 24. They got a lot of new things during the year and they sold or gave back a lot of things too.\nAt the end of the year, the amount of money earned from the money lent was about 10.6%. It changed a little bit every year. Each year, a lot of things were bought and sold. Sometimes, it was close to half of everything. \n\nSpecial gifts were given in the year 2013. They received a small gift for every part they owned because of their part in a company named YP. Special gifts were also given in the year 2012. They received a slightly bigger gift for every part they owned because they made money from their part in two other companies. They also received a smaller gift because they wanted to pay less taxes.\n\nThe money for these special gifts was only given to AIV Holdings. The money was given out four times in the year 2012 and once in the year 2013.\nLet's think about a piggy bank. Every year, the piggy bank gets filled with coins. We're going to talk about three special years. In the first and second year, we're thinking that you put coins into the piggy bank on the first day of the year and take them out on the last day of the year. Any extra coins you get during the year, you also put in the piggy bank. \n\nNow, the third year is a bit different. We think about it in two parts. In the first part, from the first day of the year to a special day, the coins in the piggy bank increase based on how much you already have. In the second part, from the special day to the last day of the year, you put coins in the piggy bank on the special day and take them out on the last day. Any extra coins you get during this time, you also put in the piggy bank. \n\nFor the fourth and fifth year, the coins in the piggy bank increase based on how much you already have, but we also think about any extra coins you put in or take out. \n\nThere's also a special rule about how much each coin is worth. We think that all the coins are worth their fair value when you put them in the piggy bank and they will be worth the same when they come out, with no losses.\nBefore the big event of a company named NM (short for NMFC), they had a special way to calculate their money-making. They had another company, named NS (short for New Mountain Finance SPV Funding, L.L.C.), and they saw NS as a big part of NM, using the value of NS in their calculations. But when NM had its big event, they started to use a new way to calculate their money-making, using the average value over time, instead of the old way.\n\nThe old way of calculating, called \"Adjusted Yield to Maturity\", was like imagining that they bought everything in their company at a fair price at the end of a certain period, and kept them until they were no longer useful, with no early payments or losses, and they would get back the same amount of money they paid at the end. This didn't consider the existing money borrowed, except for the money borrowed by NS, which was seen as a big part of NM, and the value of NS was included in the calculations.\n\nThey also had a way to calculate the average value of the members' shares from May 19, 2011, to December 31, 2011, because on May 19, 2011, which was the date of the big event, the company started to have shares.\n\nThere are some selected financial details for NM below. These numbers represent the money earned from the main company, NM:\n\n- $ 90,876\n- $ 37,511\n- $ 13,669\nThe Big Business had some money that they used for different things. They spent some, they made some, and sometimes they lost or gained a bit. The amount of money they had changed over time. Sometimes they had more money, sometimes less. They also shared some money with others. They kept track of all this in a big book.\nIn the past, a company shared some of its money with its helpers. This money was extra, like a special treat. They got this treat because the company did well with their investments. The company made good choices and bought things that helped it grow. \n\nThe company shared its money every year. They calculated how much to share by looking at how well their choices worked. If their choices made the company grow a lot, they shared a lot of treats. If their choices didn't work very well, they shared fewer treats. \n\nThey also looked at how much the company was worth at the start and end of each time period. They used this to decide how much to share. If the company's worth grew, they shared more treats. If the company's worth didn't grow much, they shared fewer treats. This way, everyone got a fair share based on how well the company did.\nThis is a story about a company called AIV. This company had money coming in and going out. Sometimes it made more money, sometimes it lost some. The company also had a lot of things it owned, like buildings and machines. These things are called assets. The company counted how many assets it had, and it was a lot! \n\nAIV also gave out something called dividends. Think of dividends like sharing a big cake with everyone who helps run the company. Each year, the company would count how much money it made or lost, how much stuff it had, and how much cake it shared. \n\nJust like how we have days, months, and years, this company also had its own time periods. For example, one period was from the start of 2011 to the end of 2013. During these times, the company would check how well it did. If it did well, it was like getting a gold star! If it did not do so well, it was like having to try again next time.\nIn the past, a company shared some money with other people. This happened a few times, and the money was shared because the company made good decisions about what to do with their money. This sharing is like when you share your toys with your friends. The company also had to pay some money to the government, just like how we sometimes have to give away some of our toys. The company made these payments a few times during the year.\n\nThere were also some big people in the company who talked about how the company was doing. They looked at how much money the company had and how it was using that money. This is like when your teacher checks on how you are doing in school. There were three important groups in the company that looked at this. They all worked together to help the company do well. A company will talk about things that only relate to itself. They don't talk about things that only relate to other companies. \nWe need to understand our money situation. We also need to know how we're doing compared to before. We can learn this from our money records. We also need to remember there are things that could make it risky. \nThere are things in this report that we guess about the future. These guesses are about a big company and other smaller companies. Guessing about the future can be tricky. Here are some tricky things:\nSometimes, money markets don't have a lot of money for a long time;\nthe way the world works, like how much things cost, and how this affects the businesses we invest in;\nwhether the companies we invest in can reach their goals.\nThe group's ability to make choices about what it wants to buy;\nThe ability of the group's helper, 'Nathan', to find and keep good helpers;\nPossible problems between 'Nathan' and the group; and\nThe things that could go wrong.\nPeople know we are guessing what will happen next when we use words like \"hope\", \"think\", \"keep going\", \"could\", \"guess\", \"hope\", \"want\", \"might\", \"plan\", \"possible\", \"try\", \"should\", \"aim\", \"will\", \"would\" or similar words. What really happens might be different from what we guess because things can go wrong.\nWe made these guesses based on what we knew when we wrote this. We don't have to change our guesses unless we have to by law. Even if we don't have to change our guesses, you should look at any new things we tell you or reports we give to the 'SE group', including yearly reports, sign-up sheets, every three months reports, and current reports.\nThere's a big company called OC (short for Operating Company). It's in a place called DE state, and it's run by people from another place. It has to follow some important rules because it's a special kind of company. It's like a team that helps other businesses grow. \n\nThis company, OC, gets help from another group called IA (short for Investment Adviser). There's also an Administrator who helps with all the work that needs to be done. IA and the Administrator are part of a big group called NM group. NM group is really good at helping businesses grow. They have a lot of money to help businesses, more than 12.0 billion! \n\nNM group loves to help businesses that are growing in a safe way. They use different ways to do this. OC was once part of NM group and was called NM Guardian. It was created by NM group a long time ago. There was a big pot of money. Some of this money was used to make a group called 'G'. Later, another group was made called 'N'. These groups, along with others they own, are called 'Old Groups'. \n\nThere's another group called 'N'. It was made in the middle of a year. 'N' is like a piggy bank that keeps growing. It has to follow certain rules. It also wants to keep being a special kind of piggy bank under some important rules.\n\nThere's also a group called 'A'. It was made early in a year. 'G', a partner of 'A', owns all of 'A's shares. 'A' is also like a piggy bank that keeps growing. It has chosen to be a special kind of piggy bank under some important rules. A company called 'Adam's company' has to follow some rules. They decided to be and stay a special kind of company under these rules. On a day in the past, a company named 'Nathan's company' sold a lot of pieces of its company at a certain price. At the same time, they also sold some more pieces to some people who work for a place called 'NE city'. Plus, some other pieces were given to the partners of 'NE city'. Because of this, 'Nathan's company' now has all the things that were owned by the old companies.\n'Nathan's company' and 'Adam's company' don't do anything by themselves. The only thing they have is being part of the bigger company. They both agreed to be part of this bigger company.\nA big company named OC had something special called \"units\". A much bigger company, called NM, bought these \"units\" with a lot of money. NM also got some \"units\" from OC equal to the number of NM's own things called \"common stock\". This was all because of a big event that happened, which we call an IPO.\n\nOC was like a child to a company called GA. But after the IPO, GA got some \"units\" in OC. GA then gave its \"units\" in OC to a new company it made, called AH, and got something called \"common stock\" of AH in return. AH can swap its \"units\" in OC for NM's \"common stock\" any time it wants.\n\nFrom the time of the IPO until the end of a year, NM collected lots of money and gave AH \"common stock\" worth a lot of money for the \"units\" AH exchanged. NM also got more \"units\" from OC equal to the number of NM's \"common stock\" it sold. There was a big company with two main parts. One part owned most of the company, and the other part owned a little. They set things up this way so that the big part wouldn't have to pay extra money for things they already had. If they give money to their helpers, it's like giving back some of their own money, not like giving a gift. \n\nThe company's goal is to make money and grow. They do this by finding and getting different types of money things, like promises to pay back money and special papers that mean you own a part of something. Sometimes, they even get a part of other companies. They like to focus on companies that are growing, tough to compete with, make a lot of money, use their stuff really well, and are really good in their own special area.\n\nAt the end of a year, the company had a lot of money and things worth a lot of money. They had parts in many different companies and were expecting to make more money from these in the future. Once, a group of people had some valuable things. They decided to keep them safe until they were needed. They knew the worth of these things might change over time because of various reasons. \n\nThen, one day, the group heard that they might be able to get more valuable things. This was because a big, important group, called the \"SB\" group, might allow them to join a special club. Being part of this club could help them get more valuable things in the long run.\n\nHowever, getting a special letter from the \"SB\" group didn't mean that they were sure to join the club. The group didn't know if they would be allowed to join, or when it might happen.\n\nLater, the group decided to share some of their valuable things with others. They did this by offering pieces of their group to others at a certain price. They also allowed some extra pieces to be bought if people wanted more. Alice's shop didn't get any money from the sale of its shiny stones by Ben's company. The Big Shop and Alice's shop didn't have any costs for this stone sale. The costs were paid by the stone seller, Ben's company. After a while, Ben's company didn't own any parts of the Big Shop and Alice's shop owned all the parts of the Big Shop. Because of this, the groups' current setup might be made simpler in the future.\nLater, the Big Shop's group of helpers and then Alice's shop's group of helpers, decided to give a small gift of shiny stones to the people who owned parts of the shop. This gift would be given at the end of the month to the people who owned parts of the shop by the middle of the month.\nCreating a list of what the shop owns and owes, and sharing this information needs the helpers to guess and make decisions that affect the reported amounts of what the shop owns and owes, and the money made and spent during the periods reported. The actual results could be very different from these guesses. We have identified the following items as important rules.\nRules of Accounting\nThe Big Shop includes its own little shop, N Shop. Alice's shop and Ben's company do not include the Big Shop. Alice's shop and Ben's company use special rules for their interest in the Big Shop. There's a big company, we'll call it \"Big Company\", that has smaller companies inside it. These smaller companies are like little fish that eat from a big fish. When the big fish is doing well, the little fish do well too. This helps everyone understand how their money in the big fish is doing.\n\nNow, \"Big Company\" has to check how much all of its stuff is worth. It's like when you count all of your toys to see how many you have. This is very important because it helps the little fish know how much they are worth too.\n\n\"Big Company\" counts all of its stuff every few months, or even more often if it needs to. It's a bit like when you have to tidy your room and put all your toys away. The bosses at \"Big Company\" are the ones who make sure everything is counted right. They check on things that are hard to put a price on, like rare toys or things you can't buy in a shop.\n\nIf something in \"Big Company's\" toy box has been hard to price for a long time, the bosses ask a toy expert to help them. They do this every year to make sure they know how much all of their stuff is worth.\nWhen we talk about things like money and what they're worth, it can be a little tricky. Think about it like this: when you're buying toys, sometimes you might have to give some of your toys back. This is like buying a toy car but having to give some toy blocks back. Sometimes, the toy car might become more or less popular, and this can change how much it's worth.\n\nThere are different ways we can figure out how much something is worth. Let's think of them like levels in a game:\n\nLevel 1 - This is like when you can look at a price tag in a shop. Let's say you have a toy car and you can see the same toy car in a shop with a price tag. That's how much your toy car is worth. \n\nLevel 2 - This is when we can't see the exact price tag but we can guess. Imagine you have a toy car, but you can't find the same one in the shop. Instead, you find similar toy cars and look at their price tags. You can guess how much your toy car is worth based on those prices.\n\nSo, when we talk about things like money and what they're worth, it's a bit like trading toys and guessing how much they're worth based on other toys.\nThere are different ways to figure out how much something is worth. One way is by looking at things we can see or find out about easily. For example, we might look at how much it costs to make something or what similar things are selling for. Another way is by looking at things we can't see or find out about easily, but we can guess based on other things we know. \n\nSometimes, it's a mix of both. We might use things we can see and things we can't see to figure out how much something is worth. It's like when we play a guessing game, and we use clues to figure out the answer. \n\nBut remember, even if we use these ways, it's still a guess. It's like when we try to guess how many candies are in a jar. We might be right, or we might be wrong. That's why we need to keep checking and guessing. Sometimes, we might even change our guess based on new clues or information. A company has to organize its valuable things. These things can move from one group to another. When they move, it happens at the start of a part of the year.\n\nHere's a way to understand how the company groups these things at the end of a year:\n\nGroup III\nFirst group $ 553,549 $ -- $ 525,138 $ 28,411\nSecond group 468,945 -- 413,407 55,538\nThird group 26,863 -- 21,692 5,171\nFourth group 66,294 1,694 -- 64,600\nAll things $ 1,115,651 $ 1,694 $ 960,237 $ 153,720\n\nThere are two other companies, let's call them Company A and Company B. They don't do anything on their own, they just own parts of the first company. They show the value of their parts at the end of each part of the year.\n\nThe first company has a way of knowing the value of its things. It looks at how good the thing is doing, and how strong it is before they decide to own it. After getting new toys, the Toy Shop checks how each one is doing. They look at how much fun kids are having with the toys compared to last year and what they thought would happen. They also see if anything has changed that might make the toy less popular. The Toy Shop learns from this and tries to guess how popular each toy will be in the future. Sometimes, something big happens, like a toy being bought a lot, and this helps them guess the toy's worth.\n\nThe Toy Shop also looks at other toys in different toy stores that are doing well. They think about lots of things when they decide how much a toy is worth. These things include what kind of toy it is, how similar it is to the toy they are looking at, how risky it is, and how much it might grow. A company called \"OP\" uses a special way to decide how valuable their other smaller companies are. They look at what other similar companies earn and use it to calculate the worth of their own companies. They did this in 2013 and used this method to find out the value of six of their smaller companies.\n\nThere's another way the \"OP\" company uses too. They guess how much money the company will make in the future and use it to decide the company's value. They consider how much the company will earn and how likely it is to pay back all the money it owes. They used this method in 2013 to find out the value of eight of their smaller companies.\n\nThey also look at something they call \"First lien\", which was worth $28,411 in 2013. They use a method called \"Market approach EBITDA multiple\", which has numbers like 7.0 x, 10.0 x, and 8.5 x to decide how much the \"First lien\" is worth.\nThis is a story about how a store counts its money. It counts in different ways, like using a ruler to measure how much money it has. The store uses different numbers for the ruler, like 9.2, 10.2, and 9.7. It also uses a thing called \"second place\" to count its money, and it uses numbers like 5.0, 7.5, and 6.2 for this. \n\nThe store does the same thing with other ways of counting. It uses numbers like 10.1, 11.7, and 11.1 for one way, and 7.0, 9.0, and 8.0 for another way. It also counts something called \"equity and other\" and uses numbers like 1.3, 7.5, and 4.7 for this. \n\nThe store also uses a way of counting called the \"Black Scholes analysis\". It uses this to count how many years it will take to get more money, using numbers like 2.0, 4.0, and 2.6. It also uses this to count how much change there is, using numbers like 21.0, 36.6, and 27.9. And it uses this to count how much it can save, using numbers like 0.3, 3.0, and 0.8.\n\nThe store also has rules for how it counts the money it gets from selling things. It counts the money from selling and paying back in a special way. It also counts the money it gets from interest in a special way. This includes the money it gets from saving money and the money it gets when someone pays back a loan early. A company has some money that it has given out, and some of that money will get bigger over time. This is because of a special rule that says if you borrow money, you have to give back more than you took. This extra money gets added to the original amount and has to be given back at the end.\n\nSometimes, people who borrowed money can't give it back on time. When they are late by 30 days or more, or if it seems like they might not be able to give it back at all, then the company stops expecting to get the extra money. If they had already counted that extra money, they have to take it back. But if they had already added that extra money to the original amount, they don't take it back. If the company gets any money from these late payers, they have to decide whether to count it as extra money or as part of the original amount. If the late payers can give back all the money they owe and the company thinks they will keep paying on time, then the company can start expecting to get the extra money again.\n\nThe company also gets money from owning parts of other companies. They count this money when they are supposed to get it from private companies or when it's time for public companies to give part of their profits to their owners.\n\nThe company also gets money from other things, like when they get paid for waiting longer than they should for something, or when they get paid for agreeing to changes, or when they get paid for other little things. Sometimes, when they trade with others, they get paid extra if the trade takes longer than a certain number of days. Sometimes, a company can earn extra money by helping others with their money problems. This is like when you lend your friend your toy car, but they promise to give you two toy cars later. This helps your friend play now and you get more toys later. The company that lends the money is like you, and the friend is another company. But sometimes, the friend doesn't need your toy car anymore. Even then, you get something nice for being helpful. This is just one way a company can earn.\n\nNow, let's say there are two companies, let's call them 'N company' and 'A company'. Both of them earn money and spend money. They also have toys (here, toys are like investments). Sometimes, these toys become more valuable (like when everyone wants to play with toy cars), and sometimes less (like when everyone wants to play with toy trains). \n\nSo, every few months, they check how much their toys are worth. And then, they divide everything - the money they earned, the money they spent, and the value of the toys - based on how much each company owns. \n\nIf they sell a toy, they record how much they got for it. Also, they keep track of how much their toys' worth has changed. Like, if a toy car was valued as one chocolate bar earlier, but now it's worth two chocolate bars, they note it down. This change could be because of many reasons. Maybe because it's a rare car or maybe because it's from their first toy set. It's important to keep track of all these changes. A company named NM, using the money it got from selling its shares and from a private sale, bought pieces of another company called OP for $13.75 each. At that time, $13.75 was less than what each piece of OP was really worth. Because of this, NM's investment value went up right away. At the same time, another company, AI, who also invested in OP, saw their investment value go down by the difference between $13.75 and the real worth of each piece of OP.\n\nAll the costs, including those of NM and AI, are taken care of and written down by OP. The costs are shared out to NM and AI depending on how much of OP they own. OP also paid for all the costs related to selling shares and future sales. NM and AI marked down their share of the costs from their total assets and the cost of their investment in OP.\n\nIn case of any costs related to registering shares of NM's common stock given instead of AI's pieces of OP, AI has to pay directly for the costs of any registration (including any discounts or commissions) and their share of any extra registration costs.\n\nKeeping track of investments\nA big company, let's call it BigCo, keeps a close eye on the smaller companies it owns. BigCo checks how these smaller companies are doing at least four times a year. It's like when you check to see if your plant is growing well or if your pet is healthy. BigCo also tries to notice any big changes that might make them rethink their plans. \n\nBy the time the big snowman-building contest happens every year (that's around the end of December), all the little companies were doing really well. Only two were not doing as good. During the time when everyone was getting ready for the big snowman-building contest, BigCo had to let go of one of the smaller companies, which made BigCo lose some money. \n\nThis smaller company was not doing well at all, like a toy that no longer works. The two top spots BigCo had in this company had a low score because the company was having a hard time following the rules. This made the company perform poorly. \n\nBy the time of the snowman-building contest, the company was still not able to make payments because it didn't have enough money. It was like a piggy bank that was empty. During the time when the leaves start to change color (that's around the third part of the year), BigCo got some special shares in another company in relation to the struggling company. The company had some things that were worth a lot of money. They bought two things for a lot of money, but now they are not worth as much. But they still made some money from those things. They keep track of how much money they can make from their things. It was about the same in two years. \n\nThere are some new rules about how to keep track of money and things that are worth money. These rules were made by a group of people who know a lot about money. The new rules started after a certain time. The company doesn't think these new rules will change much.\n\nThere are two bigger companies that own the little company. These bigger companies don't do anything themselves. They just own the little company. So, whatever happens to the little company also happens to the bigger companies.\nIn the world of money and business, there's a company that had a big event. This event didn't change the value of the things the company owned. But, because the company's stuff was worth more than what they paid for it, they could count more money from those things over time. This will keep happening until the company sells those things or they become old. The company keeps a record of what each thing is worth now, and they use this to figure out how much they should pay in extra money. They use a special name, \"Adjusted Net Investment Income\", to talk about this. This special name helps them decide how much extra money to give and how much to share with others. For more information, look at Note 5 in the Financial Statements section.\n\nThe company also has a chart for a specific year. This chart shows what would happen if the value of the things they owned had changed during their big event. It also shows how the extra money would be divided based on this new value.\nOnce, there was a big store named \"Oscar's\". They kept a list of all the things they sold and bought in a year. They wrote down how much money they made and how much they spent. They sold things like apples, toys, and books and made a lot of money. But they also had to spend money to run the store. They had to pay for things like lights, cleaning, and the workers who helped in the store. At the end of the year, they saw how much money they had left after paying for everything. This is called \"profit\". \n\nOne year, they made a big change. They started to sell even more things and also made some changes to the store. They hoped this would help them make more money. And it did! They made even more money that year. But they also spent a little more money because of the changes they made. But even after spending more money, they still had more profit than before. \n\nSo, the big change was a good idea. Everyone at \"Oscar's\" was very happy. They knew that even though they had to spend more money at first, it would help them make more money in the end. And that's what happened! So, they decided to keep making changes and trying new things to make even more money. They knew this was a good way to keep the store running and to keep everyone happy. In the year that just finished, a company earned a lot of money. This money came from different places. Most of it came from their investments. They also got some money when people paid them back early. They even got some money from other places. The company made $66.0 million in total.\n\nThe company also had to put some money aside. They did this in case they made a lot of money from their investments. This money would be given to the people who helped them invest. At the end of the year, they still had some money they needed to give to these helpers.\nThe money made was more than the money we thought we didn't have. No money was given for the extra money made. The money from things that pay us was a lot. Some of that money was taken away, but we still had a lot left. We also made money from our stuff. All the money we got was a big amount. After paying a part of it, we still had a good amount left. We also got extra money from our stuff. Our things became more valuable too. In the past, we had to adjust the money we got for some reasons. But, after all, we had a big amount of money from our things. This money was from different sources. The Company made a lot of money during a year. They got money from different things and after taking away the costs, they still had a good amount of money left. This is like when you get pocket money and buy a toy, but still have some money left to buy an ice cream. It's important for a company to make money so it can keep running and do more things. Sometimes, they have to adjust the numbers because of rules, like when we count apples and oranges differently in our fruit basket. At the end of the year, the Company checked all the numbers and made sure everything was okay. The company named OC, short for 'Operating Company', had a lot of money from May to December in a specific year. Then, for three different years, they got money from different places. They got a lot of money from things like interest, dividends, and other sources. In one year, they got even more money than the year before because they did more things and invested more money. This was because they sold more shares, used more credit, and got more money from their investments. Plus, they also got more money from other things, like fees from other companies. A long time ago, a big company earned more and more money each year. The money came from two special groups they worked with. They got even more money in a year because they started new projects with the help of money they got from selling things in July and December. They also got money from three special services and 14 different groups they worked with. Plus, they got more money from two special groups. \nHere is how they spent their money:\nThey gave $14,905 for the boss's pay, $16,502 for extra rewards, $3,229 for extra rewards when they sold things, $12,470 for interest and other costs, $3,429 for office fees, $2,349 for expert fees, and $1,584 for other costs. In total, they spent $54,468.\nA company spent less money on some things and had more money left over. Over the years, the money the company had after spending went up and down. Sometimes, they had more money because they sold things and earned more than they spent. Other times, they didn't earn as much. The company also had to give some money to people who helped them earn more money. But this amount went down a bit because the company didn't earn as much from selling things. At the end of one year, the company still owed some money.\nThere was a plan about how money was to be looked after. The plan said that if more money was gained than lost, a special fee would be given. But until the end of a certain year, no such fees were given. \n\nDuring that year, the cost of borrowing money went up because more money was borrowed. So, more money had to be paid back. Also, there were some extra costs that year which were not part of the usual agreement. \n\nThe total costs of running the company went up a lot compared to the previous year. The fees for managing the company also went up. This happened because the company made more money from selling shares and borrowing money to invest in new things. A company made more money in 2012 than in 2011. This was because the company sold more items and had more money left after paying for things. They had to pay more money to the people who helped them make money. They started paying these people in a new way after they became a bigger company in 2011. Before that, another company was paying most of these costs.\n\nThe company had to pay more money for things like loans in 2012. This was mainly because they borrowed more money than before. For two big loans, they borrowed a lot more money in 2012 than in 2011. The company also had some other small costs in 2012 that they didn't have to worry about because they were small and under control. The company didn't spend any extra money during the year. They managed to increase their money from $7,253 to $18,851 to $16,252 over time. They also added to their money $7,994, then $9,928, but then lost $23,100. In total, they increased their money by $15,247, then by $28,779, but then lost $6,848. This was mainly because of selling things for more money than they were worth, and also because of getting money from an investment. But, they also lost some money when they changed the terms of an investment and when they sold part of another company. In a year, a company made more money because the market got better and the things the company owned were worth more. This made the company's things cost more. They sold some things that were worth more than they used to be, so they made even more money. But in another year, the company lost money because the market got worse and the things they owned were worth less. \n\nThe company uses the money it has, and any money it might get in the future, to pay back money it owes, to buy more things, to give money to the people who own parts of the company, or for other company stuff.\n\nAfter the company first started selling shares, they made a lot of money by selling more shares. The company also got the same number of shares from another company as the number of shares they sold.\n\nOn a certain day, the company sold a lot of shares. They sold some shares for themselves and some shares for another company. They sold each share for a certain amount of money. A company named \"Adam's Group\" had some extra shares. They sold these shares to other people. They sold 2,000,000 shares and got $28.4 million from it. But, they didn't get any money from the shares that \"Alice's Group\" sold. They only paid for the cost of selling their own shares, not for \"Alice's Group\". \n\nOn a sunny day in the middle of the year, \"Adam's Group\" sold 2,000,000 shares. \"Alice's Group\" also sold 4,000,000 shares for $14.55 each. They also sold some extra shares to other people. But they didn't get any money from the extra shares that \"Alice's Group\" sold. A big business, let's call it 'OB company', sold lots of its parts to others and got a lot of money. But, when 'AN company' sold parts of 'OB company', 'OB company' didn't get any money. Both 'OB company' and 'AN company' only had to pay for some of the cost of selling those parts. The money for the extra parts sold by 'AN company' was paid by 'AN company' itself.\nLater, 'OB company' sold even more parts and got even more money. At the same time, 'AN company' sold some parts too, but again, 'OB company' didn't get any money from that. The Company and another company only paid for the costs related to selling their own shares. They did not pay any costs for selling shares on behalf of another company. \n\nThe Company gets its money from different sources. It can get money from loans, from the money it makes, and from selling more shares. Sometimes, the Company might take on more debt or sell more shares. But they have to be careful because they have rules to follow about how much debt they can have. \n\nIn three different years, the Company had different amounts of money. They used this money for different things each year. The Business needs money to run its activities. They can get this money from the things they do and other places. There is a Big Bank that agreed to lend them money when they need it. This agreement was made a long time ago and it will end a bit further into the future. The most money the Business can borrow from the Big Bank is a very big number. \n\nAt the end of a previous year, the Business was allowed to borrow a certain part of the cost of important things they bought. This depended on whether the Big Bank said yes. The money the Business can borrow is secured by the things the Business invests in. All the costs related to getting the money are recorded and subtracted from their earnings over the time of the agreement. There is a special rule book for the Big Bank. This rule book says that the Big Bank must have enough things of value. The rules also say what should happen if the Big Bank does something wrong, or if someone else takes over the Big Bank. But the rules don't care too much about how much the things the Big Bank owns are worth. The rules care more about how well the companies that the Big Bank has invested in are doing. \n\nThe Big Bank also has to pay some money for using the money from other places. How much they have to pay depends on a special rate that changes sometimes. The Big Bank also has to pay a bit of money when it doesn't use all the money it could. \n\nHere's a little bit about how much money the Big Bank had to pay for the past few years: \nIn the first year, it had to pay 5.5 and didn't use 0.4. \nIn the second year, it had to pay 4.2 and didn't use 0.3. \nIn the third year, it had to pay 2.0 and didn't use 0.6. \n\nThe amount of money that the Big Bank owed in the first year was 184.1, in the second year it was 133.6, and in the third year, it was 61.6. \n\nThe amount of money that the Big Bank owed at the end of each year was a lot. In the first year, it was 221.8, in the second year it was 206.9, and in the third year, it was 129.0. A long time ago, there was a Big Company that had a big piggy bank. They had to make sure they followed all the rules about how they could use the money in the piggy bank. They did a really good job at this and didn't break any rules.\n\nThen, they made a deal with another company called \"WE company\". This deal was like a promise that they would share their toys, and it was supposed to last until a special day in 2016. They could borrow up to a really big number, $215.0 million, from their piggy bank.\n\nBut, there were rules about this too. The Big Company could not lose more than they had in their piggy bank. Also, the deal was protected by all the toys owned by the borrower.\n\nThere were fees, like when you buy a toy, for starting or growing this deal. These fees were counted in a big list of what the Big Company owned and what it owed, and were taken from their earnings.\n\nThere were also promises they had to keep and things that could make the deal end, like if someone else took control of the Big Company. But these promises didn't depend on the prices of the Big Company's toys, but on how well the other companies they had invested in were doing. In the late 20th century, a change was made to the rules of a big money place. Now, a company named \"Nathan's Money Friends\" can buy or sell things with another company that it knows. They can also move things between two big money places.\nAt the end of a cold winter, the money place allowed \"Nathan's Money Friends\" to borrow a lot of money. They could borrow up to 70% of the price of something very important or up to 25% of the price of something less important. They also had to get a \"yes\" from a big bank named \"William's Big Bank\".\n\nThe money place asked for more money if \"Nathan's Money Friends\" borrowed money to buy the important things or the less important things. If they didn't use all the money they could borrow, they had to pay a little extra. \n\nThey kept track of all the money they had to pay to the money place. They wrote it down at the end of every winter for three years. One year, they didn't have to pay anything extra because they didn't borrow all the money they could.\nThere was a lot of money that was not used up. It was less than 50 little golden coins. The money that was still there was a lot, like 214.7 million, 214.3 million, and 165.9 million golden coins. There was no time when the rule about using the money was not followed. \n\nThe company could use other things to help if they needed money. These things could be promises to give money or other ways to get money. These could have some risk, which means it could be a little dangerous. The company promised to give money to others if they needed it. They promised 15.5 million and 10.5 million golden coins. \n\nThe company could also make promises to give money in the future if they needed to. But the company didn't make any promises to buy debt. There was a Big Company that had a lot of money to pay back. They had borrowed a lot of money from two different places. The first place they borrowed money from was called the HC place. They borrowed a lot of money, almost $222 million! The second place they borrowed money from was called the SC place. They borrowed almost $215 million from there! \n\nNow, the Big Company had to pay all this money back. They had to pay the HC place back all the money they borrowed by a certain time, which was not too far away. After they borrowed the money, they still had a little bit of money left that they could borrow from the HC place if they needed to.\n\nThey also had to pay the SC place back all the money they borrowed by the same time. They had almost used up all the money they could borrow from the SC place. \n\nSo, the Big Company had a lot of money to pay back, and they needed to do it soon! A big company had some money left to use at the end of the year, around the same amount as 300,000 candy bars. The company also had promises to give more money in the future to some other companies it was helping. It had promised about the same amount as 15,500,000 ice creams. At the end of that year, the company didn't make any new promises that would require giving money in the future.\n\nThe company made a promise with a helper to get advice and services. In return, the company agreed to give the helper two things: a thank you gift and a special gift based on how well the helper did their job.\n\nThe company also made a promise with another helper. This helper agreed to set up a place for the company to work and provide things the company needs like office supplies and help with keeping track of things. This helper also agreed to help with, or make sure someone else helps with, keeping the company's money records, reports to the people who own part of the company, and reports to a big important group.\n\nIf any of these promises are ended, the cost for new promises that the company makes might be higher. Sometimes, if we want to get help from others for something we need, it can take a lot of time and effort. For example, let's imagine we have a big box of toys. We expect our friend David to help us manage these toys. If David cannot help us, we need to find someone else. This could take a lot of time and effort. \n\nLet's also talk about sharing. Imagine we have a big cake. In 2013, we shared this cake with our friends and gave away pieces worth $65.1 million. \n\nHere's a little game. We have a jar of cookies. Every few months, we count the cookies and share some with our friends. The number of cookies we shared each time is listed below:\n\n* At the end of the year, on a cold winter day, we shared 0.34 cookies.\n* In the middle of the year, during summer break, we shared 0.34 cookies, and then a little later, we shared another 0.12 cookies.\n* At the start of the summer, we shared 0.34 cookies.\n* In the spring, when flowers started to bloom, we shared 0.34 cookies.\n* At the very start of the year, we shared 0.14 cookies.\n* In the previous year, at the end of the year, we shared 0.34 cookies, and in the middle of the year, we shared 0.23 cookies.\n* Even before that, in another year, we shared 0.29 cookies.\nThis is a story about a company called AN company. AN company used to share its treasure with its helpers every few months. Here is how they did it:\n\nIn the time after the start of the year but before the middle, they shared a small treasure of 0.27. \n\nLater in the year, near the end, they shared a bigger treasure of 0.9.\n\nIn the time after the middle of the year but before the end, they shared a really big treasure of 2.2. Then, they shared a smaller treasure of 0.8.\n\nIn the time after the start of the year but before the middle, they shared a very big treasure of 3.8. \n\nAt the start of the year, they shared the biggest treasure of 5.5.\n\nIn the year before, near the end, they shared a big treasure of 2.3. Then, they shared the biggest treasure again of 5.5.\n\nIn the time after the middle of the year but before the end, they shared the biggest treasure ever of 6.9.\n\nIn the time after the start of the year but before the middle, they shared the biggest treasure ever again of 6.9. Then, they shared a big treasure of 4.6.\nIn a year, there are four parts. The first part was near the end of winter and beginning of spring. The second part was during the hot summer. The third part was when the leaves started to change color. And the fourth part was when it started to get cold again. \n\nThere are two big groups, called NM and AI. They get gifts from a big team they're part of. This big team wants to give enough gifts to NM and AI, so they can give smaller gifts to their own group members every part of the year. But sometimes, the big team might not have enough gifts for AI. If that happens, a friend named Gabriel might say it's okay, and act like he got enough gifts from AI. But Gabriel has to remember these gifts, even if he didn't really get them. AI plans to give gifts to Gabriel from whatever they have every part of the year. There's a Big Company that gets money from a smaller company it owns. It plans to share almost all of this money with its owners every few months, and almost all of its yearly profit, too. But sometimes, it might keep some money to use later.\n\nThe Big Company has a special plan where if the small company gives out money, the Big Company's owners get extra shares of the Big Company, unless they choose not to. If they don't choose, they get more shares instead of money. The Big Company uses these shares to get more from the smaller company. \n\nThere's another company called AI Company. AI Company doesn't plan to use any money it gets to buy more from the smaller company.\n\nBoth Big Company and AI Company own all of the smaller company. As of a long time ago, Big Company and AI Company own most and a little bit, respectively, of the smaller company.\n\nThe smaller company has a deal with the Money Helper, which is owned by a big money group. In a place called NE city, there was a big group of friends named New Mountain Buddies. They would always help their friend, Investment Adviser, with his work. They even shared their rewards with him after they finished their tasks.\n\nAlso, in this group of friends, there were Companies and Administrator. Administrator was a very close friend of New Mountain Buddies. The Administrator would often help Companies by arranging their play areas and providing toys and games. For this, the Companies would give the Administrator some of their snack shares.\n\nThe Operating Friend was another member of this group. He would help the Administrator by giving back some of his snack shares. This was for the Administrator's help with the games, snacks, and other fun stuff. The Operating Friend even set a limit to how much he would give back, like a big jar of cookies for a year. After a while, the Administrator could ask the Operating Friend for more snacks if he needed them. So, the Big Company might need to give back money to the Helper Company. This could change and we can't be sure when the Helper Company will decide to stop asking for money back. But we think the Helper Company will continue to help cover some costs for the Big Company.\n\nThe different companies and the Helper Company have agreed to use the name \"NE Mountain\" without having to pay anything. \n\nAlso, the Big Company has rules about how people who work there should behave. They also have to follow other important laws.\n\nThe Helper Company might also help other groups in the future. These groups might be similar to the Big Company. If the Helper Company finds a good opportunity, it might decide that the Big Company and these other groups should all invest together. A company can only invest as allowed by the rules and the guidance of an important group of people who oversee things. The company's guide also helps decide how to do this. \n\nAt the same time of an important sale, the company sold extra shares to some important people connected with a place called NE. \n\nThe company has to be careful of things that can change, like how much money they can get or lose when the amount of money they owe changes. Some of their loans can change too. At the end of a year, most of the company's investments were the kind that can change, while some were the kind that stay the same. \n\nThe company also has to pay back some loans that can change, based on a special rate. \n\nThere's a chart that guesses how much money the company could make or lose if the amount they have to pay changes by a certain amount. This is based on how much money the company can make from their investments at the end of the year. A company had two different ways to get money. They would get this money and then have to give some back. This is called interest. They would look at how much money they had at the end of the year. They would then decide how much interest they had to give back. Sometimes, the amount of interest they had to give back could change. It could go up or down. If it went up a lot, they would have to give back more money. If it went down a little, they wouldn't have to give back as much. This could change a lot, and it was hard to guess what would happen. They also had to make sure they didn't lose money when they used money from other countries. They didn't have to worry about this at the end of the year. They also had a lot of important papers that showed how much money they had and how much they used.\nThis is a story about a big group. Let's call them \"N\" group. They had a lot of things and they kept a record of it all. They did this every year. The record had different parts. They had a part about all the things they had and all the money they had. They had another part about the money coming in and going out. They also had a part about how much money they had left at the end of the year. They did this for three years. \n\nThey also had a big book where they wrote down everything. This book was checked by some important people. They made sure everything in the book was right. They looked at how much money \"N\" group had, what they bought, and how much money they had at the end of the year. They did this for three years and also looked at some special things for five years. We checked the money reports for two big groups called NE Corporation and NE Holdings. We looked at these reports for a few different years. The people who run NE Corporation and NE Holdings are supposed to make sure these reports are right. Our job was to look at the reports and say what we think about them.\n\nWe did our checking the right way, like the rules say we should. These rules help us make sure we do a good job checking. The big groups, NE Corporation and NE Holdings, don't have to check how they keep track of their money. We didn't have to check this either. But we did think about how they keep track of their money when we were checking their reports. This helped us decide what to check. But we didn't say if they are good or not at keeping track of their money. There was a big company called NE Corporation. They wanted to make sure they were doing everything right with their money. So, they had people check all their money stuff. This is like when your teacher checks your homework. These people also made sure the company was using the right rules for money. They even checked what the company thought would happen with their money in the future. They looked at all the money papers to make sure they were right. They also talked to the people who keep the company's money safe and the people who borrowed money from the company. If these people didn't write back, they found other ways to check. They think they did a good job checking everything.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "e1db32d147cafbf482ea0998b66222f91df90b6a1ed57428cb42177c03e4d908"}

{"text": "Alice shared some new ideas for boys and girls, both at home and in school. She showed everyone her new book. In her book, Alice talks a lot about boys and girls.\n\nAlice got many letters about her book. Some boys said, \"Just like girls had to do certain things a long time ago, now we have to do certain things too. We have to be the ones who get money for the family. If we try to do something different, people will say mean things. They will say we are not real boys.\"\n\nAlice said, \"We are not letting boys do the same things we let girls do. We should like boys for being kind as much as for being strong. I want boys to know they are very important. They are important to their kids and they can show a lot of feelings.\"\n\nAlice also talked about her plans to make things better in the world. Sophia was worried about how people in the US only care about work. \"We only think about work. We think work is the most important thing.\" She said we are missing something important, \"care.\"\n\"We need to care for old people and children. Care teaches us to be patient and control ourselves. We are not caring about what we should care about as people and as a society.\"\nSophia's talk was a mix of smart ideas and stories about her life. These stories were mostly about her own life, starting from her early school days, her career and family, up to now.\nShe remembered when she first sat in the big school hall in 1977 as a young student in a class about politics and countries. \"I was a girl who believed in equal rights,\" she said, as she saw her future, following the women leaders of the past, going to law school and becoming a lawyer, working in foreign policy.\nThen she talked about when she returned to her school in 2002 as the new head of the school, \"happy to be a mom\" with a three-year-old and a five-year-old. She believed that \"you can do this. You just need to want your job enough and make it work.\" But ten years later, in 2012, she realized that she couldn't \"do everything.\" She wrote and spoke about the choices she had to make. She had to leave her job in the government to take care of her family and go back to being a university teacher.\nEarlier, our friend Miss Sophia was back in a place she knew well, ready to talk about her new book at the WR School. Her book has a fresh idea to make caring for families as important as doing well at work. \n\nHer old boss, Miss Charlotte, who used to work at a big office, likes Sophia's book a lot. She likes Sophia's hope and belief that we can change how we see things and make rules so that all people can take care of their families and also do their best at work. Mr. Adam, who wrote a very popular book, agrees with Sophia. He thinks her idea is a big change and that her book can help us make that change.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "4348fb9114a137da16cdce833eb48ade6a9279fb8ae0b6f4fb5cb4b1cb2e9876"}
{"text": "Find your fun - do something for you\nGet in Touch with the Fun\nMom's Fun: Stories\nWelcome to Mom's Fun\nMaking Colors for a Living: One Mom's Special Job\nHere is the first story in my ABC (Always Be Creating) Guide for Staying Happy: A look into the life of Rachel, a mom of three who also has a fun tie dye business.\nWhen Rachel is around, you can tell.\nShe loves to tell stories and jokes, she is always talking and laughing. Her smile is even bigger than her loud voice and she seems to stand taller than she really is.\nShe's also got a special talent of being able to do lots of things at the same time. For example, one night when we were younger, she jumped over the counter at a music club, picked up some bottles and a drink mixer and started to throw them in the air and catch them behind her back, under a leg and above her head, all while looking in the other direction. The actual person who serves drinks might have asked her to leave, but because the crowd was cheering for her, he just stood there in surprise.\nThat's Rachel. She knows how to get everyone's attention.\nI've known Rachel since we were very little and many of my early memories of her involve lots of colors. Painting in bright pink paint. Painting our nails with blue polish. We had fun changing our hair to a purple color using a drink mix. We enjoyed eating sweet oranges and spitting the seeds into the yard. So, it's not surprising that she's made a successful job out of making special color swirl clothes. These clothes are very colorful, need lots of creativity and hard work.\n\nIn her words, it's like the craft chose her. She's always liked rainbows and bright colors. Her dad, who worked with wood, used to wear colorful straps to hold up his pants every day when she was a child. Maybe that's why she likes colors, or maybe it's the color swirl shirts we saw on our trips to a big music festival when we were in high school.\n\nI remember these trips too. My dad would take us on a long drive through the curvy country roads and we would have a warm bowl of soup and some crispy bread at the local bread shop. We visited many small shops filled with color swirl clothes, handmade jewelry, and glass made by hand.\n\nHer journey in making color swirl clothes started six years ago when she got a set for her oldest child's 8th birthday party.\n\n\"I fell in love right away,\" she said. \"I started gathering any cotton clothes I could find in the house and started making them into color swirl clothes. A lady loved to watch videos on a popular website. After a while, she learned to make colorful designs. She wore her own designs to her job, where people noticed and liked them. One man at her job really wanted one of her designs. But she had to wait because she was going to have a baby.\n\nAfter a year, she was able to work and make her designs again. She took old sweaters, made them colorful, and gave them as gifts. Her boss told her to bring in more designs to sell. She did and they sold quickly.\n\nThen she made a page on a social media site to sell more. People started asking for her designs. Her first design that went to another state was sent to a friend who played a ball game with her when they were younger.\n\nShe sold most of her designs in one day. She realized that this could be more than just a fun hobby. \n\nOne of her designs was a very special colorful sweater. She was happy because even though her friend could have chosen from many designs, she chose hers. Just like this one, many of the designs she made were very special. \"Mom likes the color purple, Jack wants the color orange, Dad prefers red. Some want zippers, others don't,\" she shared. \"Making them, smoothing them out, and sending them off, it felt so amazing. It felt special knowing someone would wear something I made.\"\n\nThe fun of making tie dye\nIt might be surprising that someone who made so many tie dye things can remember each one. But Bella promises that she does. \n\n\"Each piece is special to me, it's like they are all my little creations. I think about them even when they're gone.\"\n\nActually, Bella feels that her love for making art comes from a long time ago, even before she was born. Her Aunt Alice, from her dad's side, loved making art too. She passed away when she was 25, before Bella was born. But Bella always felt close to her.\n\nThe first time Bella tried to dye a big blanket, she felt like Aunt Alice was with her.\n\n\"I had never made something that big and didn't know how to do it. But when I finished, it was amazing. I felt confident that I could make bigger things.\"\n\nSoon after, her dad told her that his sister, Alice, had learned how to make tie dye in her school in AZ state in the old days.\n\"Bella said, 'It's clear now. Goodness is all around us.' Bella's Beautiful Tie Dyes at the PJ Fall Leaves Event. Now, Bella, the tie dye expert, is working on almost 200 pieces each month. This is a big task, especially when she has to take care of three children, two of whom are of preschool age. But, she shares that making these beautiful pieces is her special way to relax during these busy times. She also makes time for exercise, which she calls her 'mind medicine.' 'Every morning, I tell myself that today, I need to take care of myself and my little ones. If I manage to do anything else, that's a plus,' she says. And during those times when she's busy with lots of orders, and also dealing with the usual messes and meltdowns of her little ones, how does she stay calm? 'I just think about a future when my kids are grown up, and I'm selling my tie dyes on beautiful sandy beaches,' she laughs.

{"text": "People have different views about a serious topic. In one big city, NE city, some people made a new rule that says it's okay to choose not to have a baby. Another place, IL state, also made a new rule that says it's okay to choose not to have a baby any time during the time a woman is going to have a baby. There's another place, ME state, where people who are not doctors can also help women who choose not to have babies. These new rules have made many people feel unhappy.\n\nSome people want to make these rules even more open, but a lot of others don't agree. According to a big survey, most adults think it's okay to choose not to have a baby only in the first three months. Only a few people think it's okay to choose not to have a baby any time during the time a woman is going to have a baby. \n\nMost people said they don't want their money to be used to help women in other countries choose not to have babies. A lot of people also don't want their money to be used to help women in our country choose not to have babies. Many people don't think it's right to choose not to have a baby if the baby might have a problem called Down syndrome. \n\nMore than half of the people also think that doctors and nurses who don't believe in choosing not to have a baby should not be made to help in this.\nWhy do some people want to make it easier to stop babies from growing, even when lots of people don't agree? Some of these people said no to a rule that would help babies who were born when they weren't supposed to be. This isn't about helping people stay healthy. It's about deciding if a baby gets to live or not. One man from VA state, named Ralph, said that a baby born this way should be made comfortable while people talk about if the baby should live. These people don't seem to think babies before they're born are important. They don't agree with many people, 42% of whom think life starts when a baby starts to grow, and 56% of whom think babies before they're born are special.\n\nWhile some people are trying to make it easier to stop babies from growing, 10 places have made rules that make it harder. Some places passed big rules that made people want to protect the littlest among us. AL state made a rule that stops all stopping of babies from growing, unless the mom's life is in danger. GA, KY, LA, MS, and OH states made rules that stop it once a baby's heart starts to beat. Lots of other places made rules that limit stopping babies from growing. Some of these rules have been stopped by judges, even though the places wanted them.\n\nThe point is clear--most people don't want it to be easy to stop babies from growing all the time. Some people think that babies before they are born are just a bunch of cells, but that's not true. With all the things we know and the tools we have today, it's easy to see that babies before they are born are really people. Some grown-ups still don't understand this. It's time for them to learn and understand. \n\nThere are some things that people do that can hurt babies before they are born. We need to think about whether it's okay to do these things, even if they might help us learn new things or make people feel better. It's important to remember that babies before they are born are people too, and they should be treated with care and respect.\n\nSome time ago, there were some big decisions made about babies before they are born. These decisions were made by important people who didn't really know what they were talking about. This isn't fair, and it's something we need to think about and learn from.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "f89e76f3d562d25efe7f11623f702bc1f16a4faa9f760571667f93f813fa2d8b"}
{"text": "Once, a tall man with dark hair was sitting. He was the boss of a popular picture sharing website. There was another boss too, who ran a big social website. They both were the same age, 34, and were very successful. People often talk about how well they are doing. They say that being successful is like finding a treasure. On this picture sharing website, you could see many pictures posted by the boss. The big social website was very excited when it bought the picture sharing website. It was the biggest thing they had bought so far. At first, the picture sharing website had many different things, but it didn't have a clear purpose. A smart man named Kevin went to a big school and then worked on lots of things at a place called \"GO company\". Kevin was known as one of the richest young people. He had a big job at a picture sharing app, where he got to say yes or no to every advertisement! Around this time, a man named Zachary came to the same school. There were four people, including three women, who were very inspiring and important in their jobs, and they were all under 40 years old. This is the story of how Kevin became very successful. Kevin, who started the picture sharing app and then sold it to \"FA company\" for lots of money, even said that another app deserved credit for some ideas. Stephen, another man with good talking skills, got to meet some of the most important people in marketing. Kevin was 35 years old and had lots of money. There was also Larry, who was the boss at \"GO company\". Kevin and another man named Mike left the picture sharing app, which was a big problem for \"FA company\" as they were trying to make people trust them again. Kevin was ranked 39 in a list of important people under 40. There was also a man named Alexandr who knew lots of people and had done many jobs at different companies. A tool called Slack was first made to help with a game that doesn't exist anymore. What is Instagram? Instagram was made and started in the tenth month of a long time ago by two people named Kevin and Mike. A big school was opened a very long time ago on a farm. Kevin is very well-known (and has a lot of money) because of the company he started. He is now working at a money company to be the boss of a part of it that uses a lot of technology. Here is something he said: \"I'm looking at every ad,\" Kevin said at a big meeting. People like to share things he has said. Instagram lets people share photos very quickly and a lot of people use it more than other similar things. Kevin and Mike started Instagram, which is now the biggest place to share photos. There is a lady who has a lot of money and she has been quietly helping with important things. Kevin and another man named Mark, who started Facebook, are both the same age and are at the top of a list of important people under 40 years old. Kevin, a man who helped make a popular picture app, started his journey at a school known as ST University. He sold his picture app to another big company this year. Kevin was working at a coffee shop in a place called PA town in 2006 when the boss of the big company visited. New things in the picture app will let people like comments and remove followers. Kevin's money is valued at 1. The number of women on big US boards grew to 18. This page talks about the people at ST University, which includes students, old students, teachers, and people who work there. The man who helped make the picture app and the boss of the big company, both 34, are first place on a big list. After a big war, someone who's 100 years old. Kevin has started to make the big company's 1 billion bet on his company good in 2012, by showing sponsored ads for the first time in November 2013. A city named ST is out with its yearly \"40 Under 40\" list, and a known local face is on the list. The app was made when Mike and Kevin changed their old app to focus on just one thing: sharing photos. There's a special list made by a big magazine every year. It's called \"40 Under 40\" and it's full of young people who do really important things. This year, the boss of a popular website is the number one person on the list! This boss learned a lot from his teacher, who used to be number one but is too old for the list now. Another important person is the boss of a photo-sharing app called \"Picture Place.\" Even though his school was damaged by big shakes two times, they always fixed it. This boss, let's call him Kevin, is very good at talking to people and has met with some important people who know a lot about telling others about stuff. Kevin started learning about computers at his first job and now he helps make \"Picture Place\" better. Many people know about \"Picture Place\" - it was made really fast, in just two months, and now it has lots and lots of users! You might know some other people on the list too, like the boss of the popular website and even some famous sports stars. But not everyone can be on the list. \"Picture Place\" now has even more users than before, and Kevin, who started it, is not very old and studied at a big school. Kevin is also very rich because of his work on \"Picture Place.\" Kevin, a famous actor, was born under a special star sign. CH country stories tell us that this star sign can help us understand more about ourselves. In another place, there's a woman named Jane who has been helping people become better speakers for a very long time. She was born in a town called HO town, but perhaps she was always meant to go to SI place. There's also a special friendship between Ryan and Kevin because they both love food. Can you imagine, a kid who is as old as you has lived through a small part of our country's history? There's a way to make good things happen, and a lot of successful people know how to do it. There's a picture sharing app that now has a lot of users. The people who made this app, Kevin and Mike, have decided to leave the company. This means the company that owns the app will have to figure out how to keep things running smoothly. You might know some of these people, like Mark and Evan, and even some famous people, like Serena. In one place, there were big shakes that happened twice, but each time, they managed to fix everything. Kevin, who is a smart guy who knows a lot about computers, helped create the picture-sharing app and now he's part of a big company's team. Kevin started the picture-sharing app on mobile phones in 2010. If you want to look nice for a special event, you can take a tip from Kevin. Even though he works in a place where people usually dress casually, he knows that wearing a nice suit can make any event feel special. Two friends, Kevin and Mike, did something amazing. People are talking a lot about what they did. They even met with the Pope at a big palace. Kevin and Mike changed the way we take and share pictures with a wonderful idea called Instagram. They worked hard and even got money to help them start their idea. People everywhere liked their idea so much that they were put on a list of smart and successful people. Kevin loves taking pictures and sharing them. He was brave and took a chance, and it worked out great. He got help from friends and now everyone can enjoy what he made. Even though Kevin is not working at Instagram anymore, he is still excited about technology and wants to keep doing great things. We are going to take a break to find out more about the things we are interested in and to use our imaginations. This story is about a man named Kevin who made something that lots of people like. Kevin lived in a place we'll call CA country. When he was not very old, he made something really cool and became very famous. Kevin made a way for people to share pictures using their phones. This was in the early part of this century. Before he made this, Kevin worked at another company that is now known as a place where people send short messages. Kevin said that his picture sharing idea is doing really well. This news came after another important person decided to leave a different company. Every year, a group of people decide who the most important young people are in the world of business. Kevin was one of these people because of his picture sharing idea. He was recognized as being very important when he was under 30 years old. Kevin, and another man named Mike, had a lot of success very quickly with their idea for a new way to share photos. There was a big problem with some social media companies and everyone was talking about it. A man named Kevin was a big part of these companies and he was very famous. Everyone knew his name because he was always mentioned in big magazines and important lists. Kevin didn't like to take pictures of his friends because he didn't think they looked good in photos. He was also very rich and successful because he had created a popular app where people could share pictures. \n\nKevin and his friend Mark, who was also famous for creating a popular social media site, were both the same age and they were considered the best in their field. They had created an app that allowed people to share longer videos, hoping to attract more users. Kevin had shown everyone that a single picture could be very powerful. There were good and bad things happening in the world of business. There was a boy named Kevin and his parents were very upset with a man named Mark from a big app company. Kevin was very smart and even studied at a big school. But he and his friend Mike decided to leave their own picture-sharing app, which was bought by the big app company six years ago. This made the big app company face a new challenge. There was also a girl named Megan who was very important in the tech world. She did something very special - she built a big fortune before she turned 21. However, how much money a famous person has can change because of many things like taxes, how they manage their money, and other things. A lady named Olivia helps people become better. A man named Kevin said that people are using their gadgets too much. Kevin is known for creating something very popular. He decided to take a break to find new ideas and interests. Kevin's creation was sold for a lot of money. He originally wanted more, but they settled on a lower price. Kevin worked in a place where they use a lot of technology. He has two other friends, and they are very rich. However, being famous and rich can be complicated. There are many things to think about, like how much you spend and how much you save.

Because his picture-sharing company was valued at a very high price, Kevin, the boss of the company, became very rich.

Kevin and his friend Michel worked on their project that helped people share where they were and what they were doing. That project turned into the picture-sharing company we know today.

{"text": "Our friend, Kevin, visited our studio again after a long time. For a while, Kevin was in another country with his family because his wife was making a movie. \n\nKevin just came back from a trip to a place called UK country. He did something new there. He said, \"I was brave and wore a special skirt called a kilt in Scotland part of UK country. We all bought these skirts and wore them. It was fun!\" When asked if he wore it the right way, Kevin smiled and said, \"Of course, but I also had my own way of wearing it. I like surprises!\"\nSome of our friends shared about Kevin's show in NE city at a big music event a while ago. Jack mentioned that Kevin played a guitar, signed it, and gave it to someone watching the show. Kevin shared a funny tale about that show. After giving the guitar away, he realized he needed it for a tour in the UK country. So his team found out who got the guitar. They found him, and Kevin asked for the guitar back. The person was so surprised it was Kevin! But he sent the guitar back, they took it to the UK country, and then Kevin sent it back to him.\n\nWhen Madison and Ryan were our friends, they spoke about how Kevin had sung a version of their song \"Chasing After You.\" That story was shared with Kevin, and he said, \"The person who plays the guitar in my band wrote the song. The guitar part is special. It has a rhythm and a groove. The truth is, if I had kept with it, I could have made it my own. I'll admit, I hear their song, and it's one that I let go.\"\n\nAnother thing Kevin did while he was in AU country was be the voice in a cartoon movie called \"Back To The Outback.\" He told us, \"They asked if I wanted to voice this frog. There was a plan to make a toad that could sing. I thought, 'Why not? I've never done this before.' The funny thing is, I started making a funny voice for the toad. They asked, 'What are you doing?' I told them this is how the toad talks. But they told me to use my normal voice. So, my friend asked me to use my original voice. \"It was much more playful and lively. But they told me, 'Yeah, stop doing that.' I was surprised by how many people have seen it.\"\nKevin also shared fun stories this week about his friends, like Adam, Jack, Isabel, Henry, and Oliver.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "bcb6574e5ffa618ebd1b57bfb5f641e2212ca8dd5ce59b071ff5ab9db35745b1"}
{"text": "Pictures of Old Times in a Far Land\nLet's take a peek at some old pictures. These pictures tell us about the lives of people who worked at a special place. This place was in a far-off country and was run by people from many different countries, but most of them were from BR country. This place started in the mid-19th century and went on until the middle of the 20th century.\n\nThere were lots of people who worked there. About 22,000 men and women worked there in total, and half of them were from the far-off country.

{"text": "A big computer chip company is planning to create something new and exciting later this year. This company wants to make something that helps a special kind of technology called blockchain work better. Blockchain is like a big digital notebook that keeps track of things securely. The big computer chip company thinks they can make it work even better.\n\nA man named Isaac, who is a very important person at the company, shared that they are going to make a tiny, powerful piece of technology. This small piece of technology will not cause much change in how things are usually done.\n\nIsaac also shared that they think their new invention will be much better than what people are using now. He said it could be over 1,000 times better!\n\nIsaac reminds us that blockchain needs a lot of computer power, which also means it uses a lot of energy. They want to help their customers by making things that work better and use less energy. That's why they are working hard to make blockchain as good as it can be.\n\nThe company has even made a new team to work on this project.

{"text": "Adam was working hard on a new learning tool named \"GoNoodle\". His mind was filled with thoughts about it every day. The tool was being used by more and more people, but not everyone stayed. This made Adam think a lot about how to make it better.\n\nOne day, Adam was talking to a small group of the early users. They were sharing their thoughts about the tool. One person said something that Adam had heard before. It was a suggestion for making the tool better. But this would need a lot of work and time. Still, Adam knew it was important.\n\nAdam thanked the person for the great suggestion and told them they were already working on it. But the person replied, asking Adam to work harder and faster! This reply is something that Adam remembers often, and it always makes him smile. Once, I felt a bit upset because I was working very hard with my team on a project. But then I remembered that others might not understand how much effort we were putting in. They were just looking for us to solve their problem. After six months, we did it! We found a way to fix the problem and our project started to grow fast. This happened because we worked closely with the people who first started using our project. This helped us understand what we needed to focus on and how to grow.\n\nOur team always worked closely on the project. Here is what I learned from this experience:\n\nWe Had a Goal\nWe knew what we wanted to achieve. Our goal was to reach a big number of users by the end of the school year. We knew what a \"user\" was. We had a way to see how many users we had and how it was changing over the last 30 days. We used a special rule to make all our choices about our things. If we couldn't link a choice to the goal, we didn't pick it. \nWe Mixed Thing Making + Helping Users\nIn the beginning, I had to be both the thing maker AND the one who helps users. I admit, it wasn't my favorite job. Every message started with a problem or someone who was not happy, and I had to reply quickly. But it allowed me to listen to what our users wanted, and I got to talk to real people. This was very helpful for a thing maker with a new thing in the market. \nWhenever someone wanted to change their secret word, I used it as a chance to ask what they thought about our thing and how we could improve. I told them that they could directly talk to the people who made the thing. Each message was a chance to make our early users feel like they were part of our team. They helped us find and fix problems, and also find areas in our thing that we needed to work on. \nWe Made Helping Users Active, Not Just Reactive\nWe noticed that users were more involved after we helped them -- and with that as motivation, we tried to support them better before they would write to us. \nUsing our special tool, I made a bunch of emails to users that would be sent when their use suggested they needed help. We started with helping, but also tried to get everyone involved and excited. Here are some of our best messages:\nHey, you haven't played with FunGame for a while. Can I help you?\nI noticed you made an account but didn't start playing. Can I help with anything?\nYou really liked our game. We have a new game that you might like too....\nYou really enjoy FunGame -- you play a lot! Have you tried our new game? I'd love to know what you think.\nYou're one of the top 10 players in your area! How can we make FunGame better?\nHi! We're trying something new and you got to see it. I'd love to hear what you think.\nOur first players liked being \"part of the team.\" When we asked them personally, it showed we really cared what they thought.\nWe Made Friends with a Simple Sharing System\nAfter the game started, we saw that FunGame was making teachers feel special to their students. It made the classroom fun, and teachers liked seeing happy, excited kids.\nWe wanted to make a system to make FunGame grow, but found out the best system was really simple. We used information to find out who used our fun online game the most in a school. We would send them a message and offer to send a pack of stickers for their students if they talked about our game at their next school meeting. This was a trust system: all they needed to do was respond with a \"YES!\"\nEven though some of these responses may not have been true, it didn't matter -- the information showed good results. Besides the nice feedback (teachers would often tell us how many of their friends were now also using our game) we could see clear \"growth\" in schools where sticker packs were sent.\n(A little extra: a year later we tried to make a bigger plan and create a digital friend invite system based on teacher invite sign up links. The extra work wasn't worth it -- it didn't work as well as our sticker system, and we stopped it after a few months. Sometimes easier is better.)\nWe Used Information to Help with Real Research\nOur game's information was where we got all our main questions and ideas about our online game. With a tool, we could split user information into different groups, like:\nWhen they signed up\nFirst game they played\nHow many other teachers in the school were also active\nWe could compare groups based on how long they stayed playing to look for big differences. We'd make guesses for why this might happen, and then directly talk to those users to learn more through chats.\nOur team's love for directly talking with users helped us make our game even better. In our first year of school, we were happy because we had more than 100,000 kids using our product every month. We thought we knew how to make our product better, but the kids showed us the right path with their helpful comments. \n\nWe didn't do everything perfectly. The first year was tough and we made some mistakes. Here are some things we learned:\n\nFirst, it's important to have someone to help answer questions from the kids using our product. I felt really tired after a few months because the questions never stopped, even on weekends, sick days, or holidays. But after someone else started to help, I still made sure to understand what was happening.\n\nSecond, we heard many interesting stories from the kids using our product. We did a good job of collecting these stories, but we didn't do a great job of sharing them with other teams like marketing and sales. It's important to share what we're learning with everyone.\n\nLastly, remember not everyone is going to love your product at first. It's easy to listen to the kids who love your product, but it's also important to listen to the kids who don't understand it. We had to work harder to understand these kids, but when we did, we learned the most about how to make our product better for everyone.\nLearning from your mistakes is important. In our first year, we used a lot of information but didn't keep it neat and tidy. After some time, we found out that some of this information was not correct. So, we had to fix our mistakes during a time when lots of people were starting to use our stuff. This took a lot of time and effort and some people lost faith in us for a while.\n\nThe time when we first started and were growing fast was really fun, but also very hard work. I hope that others can learn from our mistakes and have fun without getting too tired!\n\nHere are some more things to read:\n\nABC, XYZ, and Other Things You Need to Know\nBy Adam\n\nWhy Being a Leader is Great\nBy Benjamin\n\n\"Why Do You Want to Be a Leader?\"\nBy Nathan\n\nThoughts from a Beginner Leader : Part 2\nBy Jessica\n\nUnderstanding the People Who Help You and Where to Find Help\nBy Sophia\n\nQuick Tips\nThe Most Important Thing for Leaders\nBy Jessica\n\nWorking with a Digital Team: Part 1\nThomas H.\nToy plans--so you believe you have one", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "d55eb0f9cfaffc4df9be5c0b3bb90c27ee3b00ee598d1153275a409e0598e14c"}
{"text": "A man named Benjamin likes to study how we remember things. He says learning feels easy for students, but they might be tricked because they might not be learning deeply or meaningfully.\n\nBenjamin can learn his students' names quickly, which is good because he teaches about memory. Interestingly, he's also good at forgetting.\n\nBenjamin says remembering and forgetting are closely related. He says our brains are made to forget things sometimes, and it's not a bad thing.\n\nBenjamin, who teaches about how our brains remember things, finds it interesting how memory helps us think, learn, and be creative.\n\nWhen Benjamin was learning more at the university, he became interested in something called \"forgetting because of remembering.\" Most of the time, when people study memory, they ask someone to remember a list of words. Benjamin says that when you remember some words, you might forget the others. This is called \"forgetting because of remembering,\" and people knew about it even before they knew why it happened.\n\"Sometimes when we learn new things, we forget other things,\" said Samuel. \"Our brain tries to remember important things and lets us forget less important things. This is how our brain works to help us remember.\"\nThis is why, when you are trying hard to remember to get milk and eggs from the shop, you sometimes forget to buy bread.\nIt's not that our brains can only remember a certain amount of things, like a computer that runs out of space. \"Our brains can remember lots and lots. But sometimes it's hard to remember everything,\" said Samuel. \"That's why sometimes forgetting helps.\"\nSamuel also told us that our brains are amazing but sometimes make mistakes. \nSamuel likes to think about how different things around us help us remember. \"After you learn something, even if it's been a long time, you will remember it faster the second time,\" he said. \"And you might remember it faster if something reminds you.\"\nThings that remind us can be stuff around us, how we feel, who we are with, or even questions in a quiz. \"These things help us remember and are very important,\" he said. \"They help us remember what we can at a certain time.\"\nOur memories can also change. Every time we remember something, it might change a little bit. In a science lab, it was found that all kinds of memories, whether happy, sad, or even scary, can change when we try to remember them. \"Our memories are not perfect,\" said Samuel. \"They help us make decisions.\" Memories help us to trust our instincts, he added.\n\nWhat happens when we use gadgets like computers or phones?\n\nAs we get close to 20 years of GO company being around, Samuel knows that many young people can't imagine life without the internet. How does using technology affect our memories and how we learn?\n\n\"We're not alone anymore,\" he said. \"We're remembering things with the help of machines.\"\n\nBut this relationship is tricky and full of surprises, as Samuel and his students are finding out.\n\nFor young people who love taking photos to remember everything, the study by a student named Jessica might be a surprise: Her research showed that taking pictures makes people forget events instead of remembering them better.\n\nSamuel's studies also show that depending on the internet for information can make learning less effective. It can make getting new information so easy that it skips the part of the brain that organizes information.\n\n\"When you get used to using GO company, you use your own memory less, which takes away a valuable learning experience,\" he said. \"Missing the chance to learn deep and high-level things.\"\nThinking and remembering are tricky. They involve blending information, connecting it, and coming up with fresh thoughts. \"Making new thoughts,\" pondered Mr. Samuel. \"Isn't that what we want as teachers?\"\nFeeling a bit scared is an important part of learning\nAs a teacher and someone who studies memory, Mr. Samuel is unsure about some common ways of teaching. Learning is more than remembering facts, he explains. True learning is about finding a love for knowledge, and helping kids take new information and link it to things they are interested in.\n\"We often try to make kids think learning is easy,\" he said. \"But they might be tricked, because they may not be doing the type of activities that lead to deep or meaningful learning.\"\nA lot of teaching and learning methods are about helping kids do well on tests -- even if they will forget the information the next day. Deep learning needs interaction. Kids who are unsure about something actually remember more, because they have to think harder, create new thoughts, and make connections to solve that uncertainty. This process puts new information into one's knowledge structures, or schemas. Without it, learning can be shallow.\n\"Kids who don't like challenges, who want it to feel easy, might not be learning a lot,\" said Mr. Samuel, who tries \"as much as possible\" to use teaching methods based on these ideas.\n\"Teachers need to make sure students understand,\" said a teacher. \"Fun activities and questions help students remember what they learned. They can think and link it to what they know and like. Learning should be fun and a bit hard, so it feels good. When students are interested, they learn better.\"\n\nA teacher gave students an idea to learn better. He said, \"try something new.\" Trying new ways to learn can help. Instead of just doing a practice test, try making your own and share it with your friends. If you usually highlight things when you study, try studying without doing that. (The teacher talked about a study on how highlighting helps remember things. The study found it can be helpful, especially for those who don't like to highlight.)\n\nThe teacher was a bit upset about people thinking some students can't learn as well as others. \"What makes me sad is people saying some students can't learn a lot,\" he said. \"That's not true. That's not how learning works. And it makes students think they can't learn. We can all learn a lot.\"\n\nRemembering things and being creative: Why some people forget things easily\n\nIf \"hints\" help us remember things, \"blockers\" can stop us from thinking of new ideas. When we forget things, it can actually help us think of new ideas. This is because forgetting helps us to think in new ways. \n\nIn a study, people were given a common thing, like a paper clip, and asked to think of new ways to use it. They were given some creative examples and then asked to think of their own ideas. The people who forgot the examples were able to come up with more new ideas. \n\nSo, if you're trying to think of a new idea and you're stuck, it can be good to take a break. You might go for a run or think about something else. This might feel like you're not being productive, but it can actually help you think of more new ideas.\n\nThis is what researchers call the \"helpful side of forgetting.\" If you keep thinking about the old ways, you won't be able to think of new ideas.\n\nFor the researcher, studying memory can be tough but also exciting. It can be hard to connect different areas of study, but there are so many interesting things to learn. \"I can't leave any of them behind. Thank picture sharing and picture taking apps for your fading memories.

{"text": "A story about connecting everyone at work\nWritten by Ryan\nToday, the way we learn things is different.\nThis change happened because of small gadgets we carry around. We send messages. We get notifications. We play with, record, and share videos. In fact, most grown-ups get their news from these small gadgets.\nShouldn't workers also get important news from their work on these small gadgets? A company called DC and another one called CS help make this happen.\nWe're a platform that makes sure companies always get important and useful news to their workers, no matter where they are, through our mobile app. That's why we're introducing a new, powerful connection between DC and CS.\nTogether, we connect companies and their workers through these small gadgets.\nCS makes sure that workers who use information for their jobs, who usually are workers working together on different projects, can share information easily and quickly. But what about other workers in a company who are in different places, and often aren't using laptops or computers?\nFor example, let's think about a big bank. Half of the workers work in the main office and work together using CS. Everything is great. They have the information they need to do well. The other half of the workers, like the people who help you at the bank, who might not use CS, but still need important information to do their jobs, might not have the same easy way to get that information.\nThere's a helpful tool called 'D' that shares important news with everyone. It doesn't matter how you like to get your news - be it through your computer at work, on a special website, or directly on your phone. \n\nWith 'D', people who share news can make sure everyone gets the same information. This means all workers can stay updated and do their best work. Everyone in the place they work can understand the same goals and aims. \n\nEveryone gets what they need in the way they like best. This makes sharing news easy and up-to-date. 'D' also works with another tool called 'C' to help workers get news in the most convenient way. \n\n'D' also allows places to check how well they are engaging with their workers, and then improve their news sharing, so they can reach workers even better and more efficiently. It's simply a modern, easy solution - both for the place and the worker.\n\nThis is the strength of 'D', now even better with our joining with 'C'.\n\n'C' and 'D' work very well together. In fact, 'C' has supported 'D' because it sees the benefit of connecting all workers, wherever they are, and however they get their information.\n\n\"We know how important it is for workers to stay connected and informed, so we're happy to support 'D' and keep working towards meeting the needs of the workplace,\" said a big boss at 'C'.\nA tool called CS helps people at work to make, share, and work together. Another tool called DS makes sure everyone at work knows what they need to know to do their job well. Both these tools are changing the way we work.\n\nThere's a story about how a big pet food company keeps their workers in the factory informed. There are some new ways to talk to and involve workers that will be important in the future. It also talks about how to stop too much information from confusing people at work.\n\nA man named Russel works with DS. He's done a lot of work on the internet and with marketing. He started some other companies too and helped them grow big and successful. He knows a lot about business because he studied it at school. He also helps other new companies grow.\n\nDS has a new thing you can try. It talks about how to get workers to help tell good things about their company. It also talks about how companies can talk to their workers better and the good things that can come from that. \n\nYou can find DS at a building in CA city. You can also call them. DS says it's important to do things right and keep people's information safe.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "be8d5fd51f3fe95f6b657f1e8c69a3f43c0a5cea7f0151256a75c6563b8c01af"}
{"text": "How To Leave The Star Hill Ride\nAlright, this isn't knowledge you'll need every day. Most people might never need these tips, unless you really, really like theme parks like I do. If so, you might already know all this. I'd like to share how to stay safe during an earthquake or get out of a burning building, but I don't know much about that. What I do know is how to leave the Star Hill ride safely, so I'll tell you about that.\n\nFirstly, you have to pause. Usually, there are two reasons why you might need to stop on the Star Hill ride. One reason is if there are too many cars waiting at the start. This might happen when a big group of friends come together and all want to ride in the same car. But they have a certain way they want to sit, and they want the ride helper to figure it out. If you stop for this reason, you'll sit in the dark for a little bit while the ride helper tells the group that they can't all sit in the front row. Once they understand, you'll be back on your way without any trouble.\nSometimes, when you are on a ride, it may stop because there is a problem. The ride will move to a safe place and wait. When this happens, lights will turn on. This doesn't mean you have to get off the ride. A voice will tell you to stay in your seat while they try to fix the problem. Most of the time, they fix it and the ride starts moving again. But sometimes, it might take longer.\n\nIf it takes a while to fix, a helper will come to check on everyone. They will tell you that they are working on fixing it. Most people think it's fun to be stuck on a ride, but some may get scared. They might think that something bad has happened. Usually, we can help them feel better, but sometimes they still feel scared. Then, it can be fun to lightly shake the ride and ask \"What was that?\" again and again. After all, we go to the fun park for our own fun, not just for others.\nSometimes, if a problem can't be solved, everyone needs to leave the ride. If this happens, a helper will visit each car on the track and open the safety bars. They have a special order in which they do this, but the only rule that is clear is \"Samuel's car comes last\". When they reach your car, they help everyone out (starting from the back and moving to the front, and then Samuel) and guide you out. As you leave, you will notice two things. First, the ride doesn't look that exciting when you can see where you're going. If it was outside in the sunlight, people might not wait in line to ride it. Second, the path to leave must be big enough for very tall people, as they would be the only ones who can comfortably walk along some parts of it.\n\nNow, let's talk about what happens next. The helper will guide you to the exit and show you the way out. They need to go back and help more people leave the car (unless you were riding with Samuel, then you know you're the last one to leave) so go and find the helpers who work at the start and end of the ride. Tell them you had to leave the ride early and ask if you can come back when the ride is working again. They have special \"sorry\" tickets which are good for up to six people for any ride in the park (except the fish ride) including rides that don't usually have fast tickets. Sometimes, there are not enough passes for everyone. At times, they are given out without asking, but sometimes they are not. Always remember to ask for your pass. \n\nNext, decide where to use your pass. Many people choose places like the Adventure Cave or the Waterfall Ride, but I like to use it on a ride that doesn't usually offer quick access, like the Flying Elephants. There aren't many chances to skip the line for the Flying Elephants. Yes, you do end up riding flying elephants in a circle, but that's the best part of having a breakdown at the Star Ride.\n\nNote: The passage also mentions several other topics, but they are not related to the main story.\nIs it Worth it to Visit a Big Fun Park Every Day?\nSophia in VE city\nHow I Made My Daughter Happy with Tickets\nYou Want to Learn WHERE??\nThe AZ Big Fair\nThe Incident at the PO Pool\nFancy Room at the RI\nOur Habit of Making Toy Bears\nNot Using Gadgets?

{"text": "Big ships had a hard time going up the YR river, so lots of the city's ships used docks and piers instead. In a place called WI town, a dock was built by people who had done something wrong, starting many years ago. This dock was part of a big pier that was finished a few years later. There was another dock opened for trains to get right to the ships to send out fluffy wool and grain. These docks are now used for bringing in oil. There was another dock opened to help the government's big boat slide. A dock called NE dock was finished later to let more trains get to the ships. It was named after a big ship. It became part of the shipyard later and was replaced by a new dock. RS dock was built for the city's harbor trust and was home to the tug boats for a long time. It also became part of the shipyard. AS dock was built and later taken over by the Harbor Trust for its boats. The oldest dock in the city was first ordered by a man named WI as a stone jetty. It was used many years ago and was known as the Old or Steamboat Pier until it took the name of its most famous ferry boat. There is a place where big boats stop. This place has been rebuilt three times! It has been used by different types of boats and now a boat that used to be in battles is there for everyone to see.\n\nIn the same place, there is another spot where boats stop. This spot was built so boats could come near the very first railway in this country in 1854. Later, in the years 1924-30, a new spot was built. This spot is very important for boats that carry people and was often used by big boats from other countries. It became famous because many people who came to live in this country from Europe first stepped off their boats here. The last boat carrying people who wanted to come live here came in 1978. Now, there are new boats that carry people for fun in the summer and a boat that goes to a far-off island.\n\nThere is another spot for boats that was finished in 1916. It was named after a prince who visited in 1920. This spot had the same things as the other spot but was usually used for boats carrying things, not people. There were some fights between people who didn't want to work and the police in the 1920s at this spot.\n\nThere was also a spot at the end of a street that doesn't exist anymore. This spot had a place to unload coal and a railway that went to a place where they made gas.\n\nFinally, there was a spot built in 1887 for fun near the sea. It had a place where people could play music and a club for boats. Today, people still like to go there to fish. A long time ago, there was a big wooden dock in the FR country. It was built two times, first in 1853, and then a stronger one in 1857. It was a special place where big ships would stop. Important people who came on ships would be greeted here. Of all the docks in the big city, this was the most loved. People liked to walk here and there was even a place to eat at the end of it. This eatery was opened in 1904, but a big fire destroyed it in 2003. They decided to rebuild it the next year. When the big sports event happened in the late 20th century, a wall was built in the water. Now, tiny penguins live there. \n\nThe story was told by a man named Cameron. Some other people also wrote about it. Bella and Sophia wrote a book called \"Hello and Goodbye: The Tale of the Big Dock\". Wilson wrote about many different ships in his book. Patrick wrote about the docks of the big city in his school paper.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "46e5ae0c3686672e30839e8822591f8cb26da8c8a5beab47dcb51f92d7be28d3"}

{"text": "A funny picture was drawn in the local newspaper. It was about an important choice made by the people in charge of OC town. The choice was about making a camping and boating place bigger. \nThe funny picture, in a part of the newspaper, showed a family in a half-sunk big car asking a person fishing, \"Excuse us, but is this OC Lake?\" The boat had a name tag of 'Freeman', who is one of the people in charge. Freeman said something funny at a meeting about this choice: \"We don't want anything to end up in the lake. That lake is how we earn money.\"\nThe funny picture gave a small laugh in a serious situation. OC town and other nearby towns and groups that care about nature don't want the camping and boating place to get bigger. They say it will make more people come, which is not good for the town's rules about flood areas and for the water's cleanliness. FR town has taken OC town to court because of this.\nThe third meeting about this happened last week. After the people in charge said 'yes' to making the camping and boating place bigger in September, FR town didn't agree with them. FR town said it was against the town's rules. There was a problem in town that needed to be solved. The important people in the town, let's call them the \"Z Team\", didn't want to hear about it at first. But then, a big person from a very important place told them they had to listen. So, they had a meeting. \n\nThe town next door, let's call it \"E town\", was also involved in the problem. The people there were upset because they didn't know about the meeting. The leaders of the first town offered to let \"E town\" talk about the problem, and they had another meeting. But, the result was the same. The \"Z Team\" said no to the appeal and agreed with the plan.\n\nThe work on the site is still paused. The problem is still going on in the important place where the big person works. Last week, a newspaper said that the town leaders said no to a way to solve the problem. But, the town has not shared what the solution was.\n\nThere's also a question about whether the town will be able to get help if there's a big flood. A person from the \"NH office\", who helps with flood things, met with the town leaders. But, no one has shared what they talked about.\n\nThere were some other stories at the end of the original story, but they are not important for us right now.\nThree people shared their thoughts about a big change happening in their town. \nSamuel said, \"Some people might like the change, but I don't know anyone who does.\" \nCameron shared, \"I think our town is not as good as it used to be because of the people in charge. They don't listen to us and only care about making money. We can only change this by voting.\" \nFinally, Fiona and Frank said, \"We are worried about the risk of floods and new plants that might come from boats. When we lived by the big water, new plants made it hard to swim and use our water scooter.\" The water was so dirty, it got pulled into the machine.

{"text": "Hello from the CR Country\nBy a writer on a date in the past\nDid you know that CR country has been working hard for over twenty years to take care of our planet? What can we learn from this?\n\nA lot of people are talking about how to take care of our planet, especially after getting through a big sickness that affected the whole world. Many hope that after such a big event, we can build a better world where we really take care of our planet. But did you know that Europe is not the first place to have such big dreams? CR country, a small country far away, has been working on this for over twenty years! What can we learn from what they have done?\n\nBefore we look at CR country, let's talk about what's happening in Europe. About 30% of a big amount of money that Europe has for getting better after the big sickness is supposed to be used to fight changes in our weather and make Europe have less effect on our planet by 2050. This is a big step towards a 'green recovery', but there's no clear plan on how this money will be used. This is really important because some countries that rely heavily on coal, like a country with the initials PO, will get a lot of this money. Some people say that we can't ask countries, whose money-making ways have been hurt by problems today, to completely change how they make money. This is especially hard when there are big countries who aren't doing a good job at looking after the world.\n\nIt's okay to not want to be weak with money, but the way the country CR country has done things shows us that looking after the world doesn't mean you can't also grow quickly. CR country didn't just look after the world, it used it to help it grow! CR country has a lot of the world's jungles. In the old days, a lot of trees were being cut down which was bad for the world and didn't really help CR country. So, the people in charge in CR country decided to control how many trees could be cut down, they set up a team to look after the forests, and they gave money to poor areas for looking after the world. After that, they also started to look at how they could use clean energy and said they would join in with big plans to look after the world.\n\nThese new ways of doing things really helped. Now, half of CR country is covered by forests and more than half of those forests are protected by the people in charge. Almost all of the energy made in CR country comes from clean sources, like water power, and they are working towards having more good things for the world than bad things by the middle of this century. The small country of LU and the big country of CR both make the same amount of air dirt. The small country is good at keeping its trees and land clean, which makes its people happy. They also like to have visitors who love nature, and this brings them a lot of money. This is why they are doing better than some big countries. But there are also problems. They have a lot of visitors who come by plane, and planes make a lot of air dirt. The small country is also growing, and they are trying to make sure they don't hurt the trees while they build more houses. They also have places where they dig for gold, which can be dirty. And some people say that making power from water can also make air dirt. But they still make a lot of money from keeping their country clean, which shows that it's good to take care of our planet. Sometimes, a country can face problems when they try to do good things. But, doing good can also help a lot. For example, there's a place called CR country. It was having a lot of trouble because it was losing money and things. But then, it decided to grow in a better way that includes everyone. Some people say that when we have problems, we shouldn't try to grow in a good way. But we can ask, \"if not now, when?\"\nA picture was made by a person named Tina. \nThis story talks about CR country, being a good leader, and growing in a good way. \nNext, let's talk about a big step for all people.\nHow to manage things and learn in a good way - Is this the secret to being sustainable at a place called ST town?", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "b608bb57b3fe4de10e00f2ffe2dd4d719e9d4fe629682e011828d7152305f161"}
{"text": "A tricky app named \"Updates for U\" was pretending to help people get the newest updates for their phones. But instead of helping, the app took them to a website full of ads and tried to make them buy a costly subscription.\n\nGetting new updates for phones can be difficult, and this is usually because of the phone makers. To get updates when they come out, buying a P phone is your best bet. Sadly, some people used this chance to trick others into updating a phone and released an app named \"Updates for U\".\n\nThe app didn't keep its promise to be \"easy and simple\". When people opened it, it took them to a website full of ads that had download links for the updates. But to get to the free download link, they had to ignore lots of ads and hope the link didn't stop working.\n\nWhen a man named Adam looked at the app's code, he found out that the free download options were really slow and usually stopped working before they were done. \"Updates for U\" offered a $35 special subscription that got rid of these problems for a fast download.\n\nEven the way they asked people to subscribe seemed to break the rules because it didn't use the payment system. GO company took off a certain app from their App Store because it was not good. But, it was too late because it had already been downloaded 10,000 times. It took someone else to point out the problem before GO company could do anything. \n\nIn other news, a car company made a new chip to help cars drive by themselves. But, the older models of the car do not have this chip. People who already paid for the self-driving feature were promised to get this new hardware for free.\n\nAlso, a big company named Amazon wants to send 3,236 satellites into space. They hope to provide internet all over the country. They are now asking for permission to do this. This might sound familiar, because another company named SpaceX did the same thing not long ago.\n\nLastly, some people who updated their Windows 10 computer found a problem. After the update in May 2019, the colors on their computer screens were not showing correctly. The company, MI company, said they fixed the problem, but some people are still having issues after the update. We hope a big company will soon fix a big problem. \n\nThere was a game everyone used to play on their phones, but not anymore. People have forgotten about it. Because of this, the company let some people go and tried to start a new game that costs money every month. But, we don't think a lot of people will want to pay for it. \n\nGetting news on the internet can be tricky. You might not like seeing ads, but they help companies give you the news. But now, a company that helps you browse the internet has a solution. If you pay a little money every month, you won't see ads anymore. Some of the money goes to the company, and some goes to the websites you read. \n\nA service that lets you watch movies has some bad news. They have to turn off their app and services for a little while. They promise to come back and not charge people while the app is down. They say they need to do this to make the app better. People who use the service can only hope they don't lose their money. A big company is trying out a new way to sign in to their cloud service. If you're using the test versions of their new phone and computer systems, you can try this new sign in option. Instead of having to type in your password, you can use your face or fingerprint to sign in. This new way is very easy to use and still keeps your account safe.\n\nThere is also a very special satellite called LightSail 2. This satellite was made possible thanks to many people who gave money to help build it. This satellite doesn't move around like other satellites. Instead, it uses a big sail to catch light and use it to move around. The first version of this satellite had some problems, but the team working on it think this new version will work much better.\n\nIf you want to see how LightSail 2 is doing, the team that made it has a special place where you can see updates and information about it. In the end, they want to show that we can use sunlight to power small satellites.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "2a2be7fecf0155a8f8ccd998bd21d6b632302ca4867138c5088a35ed9765b4b4"}
{"text": "In a popular TV show, we meet a character named Victor. Victor is a new friend of another character, Charlotte. Victor and Charlotte are in a scary house. We first see Victor in the middle of the show's 10th season. We learn more about him in another episode later on. \n\nVictor's name is special. It's the same as a famous poet from long ago, who helped a man named Dante in a famous story. Dante had a really tough journey, just like a character in the TV show named Michelle. Michelle goes through a lot of tough things because of Victor.\n\nVictor tries to help Michelle by giving her a special tea. But instead of making her feel better, it makes her see a different life. A life where she didn't help her friend Andrea, where she didn't become friends with Rick and David, and where she ended up in a bad place. Victoria told Victor about a very scary place he showed her. Like in a famous story, Victoria learns important things from this scary trip. She understands that being kind and forgiving has helped her live a good life even when things are tough. She even thinks it might help her find her friend, Ryan, again. \n\nThat's why Victoria decides not to be mean to Victor, even though he did something bad. The other people Victor had been mean to even invite him to join them on the last boat leaving the island, but he says no. He wants to stay on the island with his family who are now happy and peaceful. After all, Victor made a promise to his wife, Lisa, to give her flowers every day. He doesn't want to break that promise. Victor also thinks that staying alone on the island might be a good way to say sorry for the bad things he's done.\n\nBut who was Victor before he met Victoria? We find out from the people he used to work with, who he later treated badly, that Victor used to do important work on BI Island. We don't know exactly what he was working on, but it seems like he was learning about things that can make you see strange things, because he knew how to make Victoria see things in a strange way. He even used the same thing on himself so he could feel like he was with his wife and children -- Bobby and Jessica -- in a happy place.\n\nWhen everything first started to go wrong, Victor and his family were safe in the place where they worked on BI Island, which is near the big water by the MA state. Once, there was a peaceful island. Things changed when new people arrived looking for a home. In the beginning, Victor and his friends were kind to the newcomers, sharing food and a place to sleep. But when there was not enough for everyone, some people began to fight. Victor had to put the scary walkers in the lab, but he didn't know his family was in there too.\n\nVictor felt very sad and asked for help to clean the lab. He wanted to say goodbye to his family properly. After everything was done, Victor was alone and quiet again, just like he was with his family.\n\nBut the quiet time didn't last. Victor found his town empty when he returned. He met Charlotte, who had just come out of a dark cave. They decided to look for their friends together. But their trip took a scary turn when they found a spooky house.\n\nThe extra information like tags and additional articles are not needed for our story.\nA story talks about a scary show being a lot like an old story about a house. Another story asks who the scary people are in the show.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "b3e4d754698d1ccde37d0e36ba290a1b864ed41deadf9735175bce425ecf2049"}
{"text": "A group of helpers who rode horses to keep a large park safe is no longer working. This group has been helping others in the park since the 1980s. They would ride their horses through the park's hills and paths to help people in many ways. But, they found out last month that they won't be able to do this anymore.\n\nWhen people got sick from a big illness, the group had to stop their work. The people who take care of the park decided not to start the group again for a few reasons. They said they didn't have enough workers to help run the program and train the volunteers. They also didn't have enough space at the park buildings for the group's training.\n\nThe helper who had been with the group the longest, a man named Jack, is sad about this. Jack joined the group in 1995.\n\nHe said, \"It was a way to help the park and the people. We were like the helpers for the park guards.\" Helpers ride their own big animals and learn a lot before they take care of a very big place. This place has lots of green land and beautiful parks. They know how to take care of people who are hurt. The helpers always go in twos and they have special tools to call for help when they need it. They help when there are big events with lots of people at the parks. They also do simple jobs like giving out water and snacks to tired walkers. Most people who come to the park are very good and listen to the helpers. Even when the helper program stopped, two helpers still go out on the trails on their big animals. They say that they've seen more bad things in the park, like drawings on the walls, trash, and dogs not on a leash.\nPark helpers can't give out rules reminders or argue with park visitors not following the rules, but when they arrive in their uniforms, people tend to listen more.\nThe uniforms--tan shirts with black hats that have \"MVP\" on them--also let visitors know who to ask for help, said a park helper.\nIn one situation, a worried guest asked a helper for a bandage. But she needed more than that.\n\"Her friend had fallen from a hill,\" the helper said. \"But if she hadn't seen the helper in her uniform, she would have thought these were just some people riding horses passing by.\"\nTwo big problems that helpers often see are people feeling too hot and people falling off their mountain bikes.\nHelpers are still hoping for things to get better.\nThe park agencies keep talking with the group and are willing to change the program to let it start again, another helper said.\nDavid has started rewriting the helper guide and made suggestions for how the program can keep going. The hard part is working with the three park agencies and finding more helpers.\nThe group used to have 70 helpers. Now, it only has seven.\n\"We could have done everything ourselves, except we have to report to them (the agencies) and follow all the rules,\" David said.\nWe're going to talk about a few things that happened in different places. First, there was a time when people decided to make a new place for fun and games. They all agreed and so it happened. There were some people who helped make it happen. \n\nNext, we're going to talk about big cats called mountain lions. Sometimes, when there are big fires, these mountain lions have to move to new places. But moving can be dangerous. They might get hurt by cars or have fights with other mountain lions. \n\nFinally, we're talking about animals called coyotes that live in the city. Some people want to get rid of them, but others think we can live together. There was a lady who felt sad when she saw a hurt coyote.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "97c9a740143c1b522a768d62f89ce9e89ac87881659964fa1212172b8cf7cf8d"}

{"text": "A special promise was made to help more students in the EM school district go to college. After finishing school, these students will get to choose their classes first at RH College. If they get good grades and take the right classes, they can then go to a big university. The school principal, Mr. Kevin, said, \"We are telling students that many chances are there for you and you should grab them.\"\n\nIn this plan, helpers from the big university and RH College will check how well the students are doing in their important classes. They will also talk to the students' moms and dads about this. \n\nThe very best students in the school can go straight to the big university. This special plan is not just for the students in EM school district, but also for all high school students in CA state. But, it also has some special parts that are not found in any other similar plan in CA state, said Mr. Henry, who helps students at RH College.\nGabriel talked about a special chance for students at the local school to sign up early for classes at FR country School. Usually, new students are the last to pick their classes, but with more school work done, they can pick earlier. \"Classes fill up so quickly... if you are last to pick, there might not be many classes left,\" Gabriel said. \"This helps them start their school journey, letting them choose the classes they want.\"\nThis special chance will be really helpful for students who are the first in their family to go to school and may not know how to sign up for school, said the school leaders.\n\"NE city is maybe a short trip from here. But for some families and students, it feels like a very long trip in their mind to reach the door of a school,\" said a man named Matthew, who works at the big school. \nThe head of the local school, named Nathan, thinks this special chance will lead to a big increase in the number of students who go to school. \nThe number of students who go to school after they graduate is different at each school. \nAt one high school, 40 percent of students go to a public school in CA country, according to the latest data. More students might go to schools in other states or private schools in the same state, but that information is not known. At RH School, more than 8 out of 10 kids plan to go to college. A lot of them are really happy about this. Especially the ones who didn't think they could go to college before, said Mr. Samuel. The students were really happy when they found out they could go to RH College, and if they work hard and take the right classes, they can then go to IR College. Seeing the kids' hope and excitement was something Mr. Samuel didn't expect. It made him feel happy when a student, who thought about quitting, realized they could reach their goals after a few years, even if they had a tough time before.

{"text": "A long time ago, a scary movie called \"The Spooky Attic\" was made. The movie tells the story of Adam, a man who forgot all his past, living in a strange place with other people like Benjamin. Adam is not sure if Benjamin and others are really who they say they are. He's told to stay away from a big purple door in the attic, behind which a scary secret is hidden. There's also a suspicious doctor named David who makes him want to avoid scary treatments.\n\nThe movie took a long time to make and was almost left forgotten in the attic. But, finally, it was ready to be shown to people who like scary things. \"This is good for us,\" said the director, who we'll call Jack. \"Now more people will get to see our movie, even in big places like NE city.\"\n\nJack wished his movie could have been shown in more places, but at least it got to be seen in some big cities for a bit. \"Making a movie can be tough,\" says Kevin. \"There are many movies that people don't even know about, even ones with famous actors. Smaller movie companies have a hard time because there are too many movies and not enough time to show them all. It's a big challenge.\" Kevin liked working with a big video store company because they had a lot of money and people knew them. \"It was good because we could pay back the money people gave us to make the movie,\" says Kevin. \"Bigger companies wanted to work with us, but they wouldn't have treated our movie any differently.\"\n\nThe surprising thing for Kevin was that his movie, called Attic, was not changed at all. He thought that if a company in our country decided to show his movie, they would change the name. He says, \"We're really happy that the big video store company didn't change the name of our movie, even though it doesn't sound like a scary movie, and didn't change any part of the movie.\"\n\nBut, the funny thing is, in other countries, the movie will have a different name. Kevin suggested some other names like Scary Thing Behind the Purple Door, The Scary Attic, The Attic That Yells and The Evil Attic, but the person who sells the movie in other countries decided on Scary Things in the Attic. \"Adam was making a movie and wanted a title like those from old scary films, maybe something like 'The Scary House' or 'The Frightening Upstairs.' He thought calling his movie 'Scary Attic' would be like naming an action movie 'Street Explosions.'\nAdam did well with his first movie and even found someone to help him make more. But he hopes to find a better way to pay for his next movie. He doesn't want to ask his family and friends for money again, but he likes having control over his movie. He thinks making movies by himself is a good way to make a great film.\nThe review of Adam's movie in the NE City Weekly was good, and a movie magazine called it 'an impressive film from a new movie maker named Adam.'\"", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "1e241ea7727fa0fe60fbf60f6c33fef7cb28479e67d0af23bb19248c8b2ab5cd"}

{"text": "A writer from CR city is trying something new with her upcoming set of three books. Our writer, Bella, has been creating books for young adults and children for many years, but this is her first time trying out fantasy. The first book in the trio starts with a wise man and a dragon, and it will be ready soon. The story is set in a faraway land in a time long ago. Bella wanted to keep the story real and not too strange or confusing.\n\nShe says, \"If you're making a new world that no one knows, it can be tricky. You can get lost because you're not seeing the world as it really is. I think that's why I'm not a big fan of too much fantasy or space stories. They're too strange and the names are hard to say. I was okay with writing this because it's real enough that most of us can understand.\"\nA brave girl was excited to see new places. She was 13 years old and her name was Madison. Many people thought Madison was different. One day, Madison met a wise old man who told her that she had a special power. This changed everything for her. During her journey, she met a dragon who told her that their land was in big trouble and only Madison could help.\n\nMadison had a very important choice to make. This choice is what the story is all about. The whole story tells about her journey to discover who she really is.\n\nThe story is set in a world like ours, and it was very important to make sure all the details were right. With the help of a friend named Jack, small errors in the story were fixed. \n\n\"For instance, in my first version of the story, the wise old man was smoking a pipe,\" said the writer. \"But Jack told me that people didn't do that back then. So, we removed that part. It feels good when you know that the story is correct.\"\n\nThe writer also helps the reader understand the story better by talking about old traditions and taking them to real places in the land of the story, like an old place in IR country that is important in the story.\nA writer named Bella had a tough time sharing her new book with others in a year when it was hard to meet people. Usually, Bella would have fun events and sign books for people, but this year was different. She found a new way to keep people excited about her book. Bella also loves to draw, and she started sketching pictures of people and things from her book every day. She would then share these drawings on her picture sharing and friend sharing sites to get people excited about her book.\n\nBella would say, \"These are quick drawings of people and things from my book. I make a new drawing every day and share it with people online. I also tell them about the person in the drawing. This is getting people excited about my book.\"\n\nBefore her book's big day on a certain day in fall, some money from early orders will be given to a group that helps young people learn about being fair to everyone. This group is called EQ group.\n\nIn Bella's book, her main character Alice feels left out. She doesn't feel like she belongs. The book's message is about everyone being included. This fits with what the EQ group is all about. Until the big day in fall, for every early order of Bella's book, some money goes to help the EQ group with their important work.\n\nBella's book can be ordered early and will be available at a store called CO store and other places online.\nA story about a new book, written by an author from QU Island, talks about our big problems with nature.

{"text": "In a big meeting room, a bill called HB17-1088 was talked about. David, who brought the bill, told everyone about it. The bill said the State Department needs to check the signatures on important papers with the signatures they have in their big book of voters. This is for any important papers that are filed for an election happening after the first day of the new year. Right now, they check things like where the voter lives and if the voter can vote, but they don't check the signatures. This bill also says that if a signature doesn't match, a worker from the State Department can tell the candidate in three days. The candidate can fix the problem by getting a note from the voter whose signature didn't match, and a copy of the voter's identification within three days of getting told. If there's a problem with the circulator affidavit, a candidate can fix it by providing a new, corrected one within five days of getting told about the problem.\n\nThen, Sophia, who works for the State Department, said she liked the bill. After that, Emma, who works for a group called CC, also said she liked the bill.\nPeople answered questions from the group's members. There was a rule named HB17-1088.

{"text": "A doctor from a far away place said that the number of people who were sick in that place might not be true. In a picture, we see the leader of that place talking to sick people and doctors in a big hospital. The leader also visited the place where many people got sick. This sickness makes some people have a fever and cough. Older people and those who are already sick can become very sick because of it.\n\nPeople said that the place is getting better from the sickness. But, some people there don't think everything is really getting better. They said that there might be tricks to make it look like things are going back to normal. They said that shops are keeping their lights on and pretending that everyone is there, so they won't upset the people in charge. People living in apartments were seen shouting at visiting leaders. They were saying, \"It's not true, it's all made up.\" This happened about a week and a half ago.\nThen, another piece of news came out. This news said that the number of sick people in a big city might not be the real number. This was according to a local doctor who was helping the sick people.\nThis doctor, who worked at a place where sick people were kept, said the numbers given by the government \"cannot be trusted.\"\nAccording to him, the number of sick people being treated was being made smaller on purpose. This was to show the government's success in fighting the sickness, he said.\nThe doctor, who is in his 40s, and helps decide if a patient can leave the hospital, was very worried. He said that if people don't know the truth, the sickness could start spreading again.\nThe doctor said that the patients were not getting better before they were allowed to leave. They were still showing signs of being sick when they were let go. This was decided by a \"special person\" from the organization fighting the sickness.\nAccording to the doctor, \"a lot of sick people were let go.\" That's why the number of sick people seemed to go down.\nAlso, talking with patients who had signs of being sick like having a fever was made simpler, and tests to see if they were sick were stopped. Because of this, \"people who might be sick were let back into the community,\" he said.\nBecause of some untrue things that have been said before, it's easy to believe these things and hard not to doubt what the official government says. Things might be getting a little better. But they also know that everyone is watching them, and they might want others to stop focusing on them. They might also want to say it's not their fault. We've seen this happen before. If people who were sick are better, or if people they thought were sick are not, then the number of sick people will go down.

{"text": "This is a story about a book with lovely animals and a boy named Matthew. Matthew was left alone in the WI forests. He was taken care of by wolves. During his adventures, Matthew met many animals like a bear named Benjamin, a sleek black panther named Penelope, and a tiger named Samuel with bright eyes. The book also has other fun tales about animals. One story is about the fight between the good and the bad in \"Rabbit-Turtle-Turtle\" and another funny story is \"The Tree Climbers\". In this book, the author uses old animal tales, some big ideas, and memories from his childhood to show the relationship between people and nature. It's a book that kids will always love. There's a special book out there that has stories about the wild jungle. One of the stories introduces us to a little boy named Matthew. This book is very pretty and feels nice to touch. It even has shiny designs on it. The person who wrote this book was very good and won a big prize for writing. His name was Ryan and he was born in a faraway country called IN country. When Ryan was little, he and his sister, Taylor, lived with a different family in EN country for five years. During this time, he missed his mom and dad a lot. This feeling of missing them was so strong that it showed up in some of his stories. One of them was about a black sheep, and another one was a story about a light that couldn't shine anymore. Even when he was older, Ryan was still upset about the house where he and Taylor lived without their parents. He wished he could make it disappear forever. Ryan and his wife lived in a place called VE town. While living there, he wrote the stories about the jungle and a book about brave captains. A lot of people loved his books and he became very popular and successful. In a time long ago, a man named Ryan lived in SE country, where he wrote many popular books. These stories were loved by many, and he even won a big award for his writing. When he passed away, people had different thoughts about his books, but lots of kids continued to enjoy his stories.\n\nAlice was a very talented artist who made books look beautiful. She learned about letters and words at university and now she lives in LO city.\n\nThen the story goes to talk about a bird named Chil who tells us when it's night time. And a bat named Mang who loves the night. All the animals are resting in their homes, waiting for the next day to start. It's a time when animals feel strong and important. They know the rules of the jungle and they follow them.\n\nOne warm evening, in a place filled with hills, Father Wolf woke up. He stretched and yawned, trying to feel more awake. Mother Wolf was with her four little ones, who were making lots of noise. They all lived in a cave, and the moonlight could be seen inside. \"Ugh!\" said Daddy Wolf, \"I need to go find food now.\" Just then, a small shadow with a fluffy tail came in and said: \"I hope you find lots of food, Mr. Wolf. I also hope your kids grow up strong and kind, and always remember to share with those who are hungry.\"\nThe shadow was a sneaky jackal. The wolves didn't like the jackal because he was always causing trouble, spreading rumors, and eating junk from the town's trash. They were scared of him too because sometimes, the jackal would get very crazy. When this happened, he would forget to be scared and would run around biting everything. Even the big cat was scared when the jackal got crazy because it's not good for animals to act this way. People call this acting crazy, but the animals just call it \"the madness\" and run away.\n\"Come in, then, and look around,\" said Daddy Wolf, \"but there's no food here.\"\n\"For a wolf, maybe not,\" said the jackal; \"but for someone like me, even a dry bone is a great meal. We jackals aren't picky eaters!\" A little creature scurried to the back of a dark home, where he found a leftover piece of food, and began to eat it with joy.\n\"Yum! This is tasty,\" he said, cleaning his mouth. \"Wow, look at those brave kids! Their eyes are so big! And they're so young! Oh, I should have known that royal children are like grown-ups from the start.\"\nNow, the creature knew that it's not good to praise kids directly; and he was happy to see the kids' Mommy and Daddy feel a little awkward.\nThe creature sat still, happy about the trouble he caused, and then he said with a mean tone:\n\"The Big Cat, has moved his hunting area. He will hunt in these hills for the next moon cycle, he told me.\"\nThe Big Cat was the tiger who lived near a big river, a long way away.\n\"He shouldn't do that!\" Daddy Wolf started to say with anger--\"By the rules of the forest, he shouldn't change his home without telling everyone. He will scare all the animals within a long distance, and I--I have to find food for two, these days.\"\n\"His mommy didn't call him Limping Cat for no reason,\" said Mommy Wolf, calmly. \"He has had a bad foot since he was born. The big cat has only been bothering the cows so far. Now, the people living in the W village are upset with him, and he has come here to upset our villagers too. They will search the whole forest for him when he is not here, and we and our little ones must leave when the grass catches fire. Yes, we are very thankful to the big cat!\"\n\"Do you want me to tell him how thankful you are?\" asked T, the animal.\n\"Leave!\" ordered Father Wolf. \"Go and find your leader. You have caused enough trouble for one night.\"\n\"I will leave,\" said T, calmly. \"You can hear the big cat down there in the bushes. I could have saved my breath.\"\nFather Wolf listened, and down in the valley that leads to a tiny river, he heard the upset, snarly, song-like noise of a tiger who hasn't caught anything and doesn't care if the whole forest knows it.\n\"What a silly cat!\" said Father Wolf. \"To start his night's hunt with that noise! Does he think our deer are like his fat W village cows?\"\n\"Shh. He is not hunting a cow or a deer tonight,\" said Mother Wolf. \"He is hunting a human.\" The noise had changed to a sort of humming sound that seemed to come from all directions. There was a loud sound in the forest that scared the people camping there, making them run, sometimes towards danger. \n\"Human!\" exclaimed Father Wolf, showing all his white teeth. \"Yuck! Aren't there enough bugs and frogs in the ponds that he must eat humans, and in our area too!\"\nThe Jungle Rule, which always has a reason for everything, tells every animal not to eat humans unless they are teaching their kids how to hunt. Then they must hunt outside their own area. The real reason for this rule is that if an animal eats a human, soon people with big animals and loud noises will come. Then everyone in the jungle is unhappy. The animals think that humans are the weakest and it's not fair to hunt them. They also say--and it's true--that animals who eat humans become sick and lose their teeth.\nThe sound became louder, and ended with the loud roar of the tiger ready to attack.\nThen there was a strange noise--not like a tiger's noise--from Shere Khan. \"He missed,\" said Mother Wolf. \"What happened?\"\nFather Wolf went a little way and heard Shere Khan grumbling and stumbling around in the bushes.\n\"Daddy Wolf was grumpy. He said, 'A silly monkey jumped into a wood cutter's fire and hurt his feet. Now, Monkey is with him.'\n'Mummy Wolf said, 'Something is coming up the hill. Get ready.'\nThe bushes moved a little, and Daddy Wolf got ready to jump. Then, you would have seen something amazing. Daddy Wolf jumped, but then he tried to stop himself. He jumped up high into the air, and landed back where he started.\n'Oh no! It's a little human boy. Look!'\nIn front of him, a little boy was standing, holding onto a branch. He was as cute and chubby as a baby who came to a wolf's cave at night. He looked at Daddy Wolf and laughed.\n'Is that a little human boy?' Mummy Wolf asked. 'I've never seen one. Bring him here.'\nA wolf who is used to carrying his own cubs can hold an egg without breaking it. When Daddy Wolf picked up the little boy, he didn't scratch him at all. He put him down with the wolf cubs.\n\"Look how small and bare, and brave!\" whispered Mommy Wolf. The baby was wiggling his way between the pups to cuddle close to Mommy Wolf's warm fur. \"Wow! He's eating with the others. So, this is a human baby. Has any wolf ever had a human baby in her family?\"\n\"I've heard stories about it, but never in our family or during my time,\" said Daddy Wolf. \"He has no fur, and I could easily hurt him. But look, he gazes up and shows no fear.\"\nThe bright moonlight disappeared from the cave's entrance because a large tiger stuck his big head and shoulders in. A jackal, squeaking behind him, said: \"Boss, boss, it went in here!\"\n\"We're honored by the tiger's visit,\" said Daddy Wolf, but his eyes showed he was upset. \"What does the tiger want?\"\n\"My prey. A human baby came this way,\" said the tiger. \"Its mommy and daddy have left. Give it to me.\"\nThe tiger had jumped at a woodsman's fire, as Daddy Wolf had said, and was very mad because his feet were burned. But Daddy Wolf knew the cave's entrance was too small for a tiger to enter. In a tight spot, a big tiger named Samuel was uncomfortable, like a person would be if they had to fight in a tiny box. \n\"The wolves are free,\" said Father Wolf. \"They listen to the Pack Leader, and not to any tiger. The little boy is ours--we can decide if we want to hurt him or not.\"\n\"You can decide, but you can't decide! What kind of talking is this? I'm a strong tiger, do I have to wait in your den for what's mine? I am Samuel, the tiger!\" \nThe tiger's loud growl echoed in the cave. Mother Wolf jumped forward, her eyes shining in the dark, looking straight at Samuel's fiery eyes.\n\"And I am Rachel, who replies. The little boy is mine, Samuel--mine! He will not be hurt. He will live to be a part of the wolf pack, to hunt with us; and in the end, you who hunt little ones, you will be the one hunted! Now go away, or you'll be sent back to your mom, you burned beast, even more hurt than when you were born!\" \"Wow!\" exclaimed Father Fox, surprised. He remembered the time when he won over Mother Fox from five other foxes. She used to be part of a group and wasn't called 'The Scary One' just to be nice. Tiger Terry could have stood up to Father Fox, but he couldn't face Mother Fox. He knew she had the advantage, and she would fight till the end. So, he backed away from the cave opening, growling. When he was far enough, he shouted:\n\n\"Every dog has his own space! We will see what the group thinks about taking care of human babies. The baby is mine, and he will come to me in the end, you furry thieves!\"\n\nMother Fox lay down, tired, among the babies, and Father Fox told her seriously:\n\n\"Tiger Terry is telling some truth. The baby needs to be shown to the group. Will you still take care of him, Mother?\"\n\n\"Take care of him?\" she panted. \"He came alone, at night, with no clothes and very hungry; yet he was not scared! Look, he has already moved one of my babies to the side. And that mean butcher would have hurt him and run off to the RI river while the people here searched all our homes for revenge! Take care of him? Of course, I will take care of him.\" Be calm, little frog. I will call you 'Matthew the Frog'. One day, you will chase the scary tiger like it chased you.\"\n\"What will our group think?\" asked Father Wolf.\nThe rules of the forest say that any wolf can leave his group when he gets married. But when his babies can stand up, he must show them to the group's meeting. This meeting happens every month when the moon is full, so other wolves can see the babies. After this meeting, the babies can go wherever they want. If they haven't caught their first deer, no reason is good enough if a big wolf from the group hurts one of them. If this happens, the punishment is very serious. \nFather Wolf waited until his babies could run a bit. Then, on the night of the group's meeting, he took them, Matthew, and Mother Wolf to the meeting place. This place was a hill covered with rocks where many wolves could hide. Adam, the big grey lone wolf who was the leader, was lying on his rock. Below him were lots of wolves of different sizes and colors, from old ones who could catch a deer by themselves, to young ones who thought they could. The leader wolf had been guiding them for a full year. He had twice been caught in traps when he was younger, and once he had been hurt and left alone; so he understood how humans behaved. There wasn't much chatter at the big stone. The little wolves played with each other in the middle where their parents sat, and sometimes an older wolf would quietly go check on a little one, look at him, and then go back to his spot without making a sound. Sometimes, a mom wolf would push her little one into the bright moonlight, to make sure no one missed him. The leader wolf would call from his stone: \"You know the rule--you know the rule. Look carefully, O Wolves!\" and the worried mom wolves would answer: \"Look--look carefully, O Wolves!\" \nFinally, the moment came that made Mother Wolf nervous--Father Wolf pushed \"Mowgli the Frog,\" as they nicknamed him, into the middle, where he was laughing and playing with some shiny pebbles under the moonlight.\nThe leader wolf never lifted his head, but kept repeating: \"Look carefully!\" A muffled sound came from behind the stones--it was the voice of the big, scary tiger saying: \"The little wolf is mine. Give him to me. \"What does the wolf pack have to do with a human child?\" asked Adam, but he didn't really want an answer. He just wanted the other wolves to think about it. Some of the wolves grumbled, and one young wolf, who was only four years old, asked the same question. \n\nThe rules of the forest say that if any wolf cub is questioned, at least two wolves who aren't his parents need to stand up for him. \n\n\"Who will stand up for this human child?\" asked Adam. \"Who among the wolf pack?\" No one answered, and the child's wolf mom prepared herself, knowing she might have to fight. \n\nBut then Benjamin, the big brown bear who could go anywhere he wanted because he only ate nuts, roots, and honey, stood up. He was the only other animal who could be at the wolf meeting. \n\n\"The human child?\" he asked. \"I'll stand up for the human child. There's nothing wrong with a human child.\" \"I cannot talk very well, but I say true things. Let him play with his friends. I will teach him myself.\" \n\nThis is a part of a story written by a man named Ryan. His story also talks about other popular stories like 'Tales from 1001 Nights', 'Aladdin', and 'Ali Baba and His Friends'. \n\nSome other famous stories were written by Thomas, Adam, Cameron, David, Ethan, Frank, Gabriel, Henry, Isaac, Jack, Kevin, and Liam. Some ladies named Alice, Bella, and Charlotte also wrote great stories. These stories are loved by many people.\n\nThe stories take us on amazing journeys, to far-off lands, and to old halls. They teach us about love and friendship and many other things. And all these stories were made beautiful by a lady named Coralie.\nA famous story about a big white whale was written by a man named Henry. Henry, along with a woman named Charlotte, made this story into a book. There are also many other books written by people like Jack, Madison, Gabriel, and more. They all worked with Charlotte to make these books. \n\nThere is a special type of book set, made of hardcovers, that has all the stories written by a lady named Jane. Another man named Charles also has a hardcover book set with all his stories. \n\nThere are even more books! One is a collection of funny and silly poems, and there are books written by other people like William, Alex, and Victor. Another man, Charles, has a book that has been made extra special. \n\nA man named George and a woman named Bella also wrote books. They all worked with Charlotte to make their stories into books. There are even books by an author named Liam and a woman named Lily. All of these books are very special and beloved.\nWilliam, Charlotte, David, Alice, and others have written many stories. Some stories are about Christmas, some are about adventures in far-off lands, and others are about foxes, birds, and worms. Some stories are just plain tales, while others are about spies and magical things. These stories are written down in books, notebooks, and even on cards. Some of these books have been around for a long time, like 100 years! We also have poems and other kinds of writing. All these writings help us learn and imagine new things.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "fdbfb137d8c8f1a9b9e32b7aea090dfd2a2f60f040748f9bfd1aab2db374ef00"}

There's a place to watch movies, many places to eat, and some old-fashioned shops. There's a public pool, many football fields, an exercise circuit, a city arena, many squares with outdoor seats, a city library, and free internet in the main square. For school, there are four schools and a part of the Open University.\nThere's a really big dam in the PT country. It's not the biggest, but it's pretty big and it's built on a river. This dam made a huge lake, the biggest one people have made in Europe. The lake is so big it can hold a lot of water, more than any other place in PT country.\n\nPeople built this dam for a few reasons. One reason was to help water plants all over the region. Another reason was to make electricity. There were some other smaller reasons too. A lot of the things they needed to build for this have been finished, and some are still being worked on.\n\nNowadays, many people like to visit this dam for fun. They like to relax there on the weekends. There's a lot of things to do and see, like how people in the area live and the things they make. This has made the dam a favorite spot for a lot of people.\n\nThe idea to make a big water reserve on this river has been around for a very long time, over 100 years. The big project to really get it done started in the mid 20th century. This was when people made a plan to water the plants from the river.\n\nThey found a good spot to take water from the river, but because the river also goes through SP country, they needed to make a deal on how to share the water. So, PT and SP countries made a deal that let PT country take care of the part of the river between two smaller rivers. A long time ago, people made a plan. This plan was about building a big wall to hold water, like a giant bathtub. This big wall is called a dam. The dam was going to be built in a place called AL town. \n\nThey started to work on the dam in AL town, but then they had to stop. They only had time to make some things that would help them build the dam. \n\nA few years later, they decided to start working on the dam again. They made a group of people to help make the dam. They even asked people from other places to come and help. \n\nFinally, they started to put the big pieces of the dam together. After a while, the dam was done! They started to fill the giant bathtub with water. \n\nThere's also a castle in RE town. A brave man named Geraldo, or \"Gabriel\" as we will call him, took over this castle a long time ago. Now, all we can see is an old castle that shows us how people built things long ago. There was a big, strong castle in a place we'll call \"MO town\". It stood on the edge of the town and was made of big rocks. The castle had a special shape like a trapezoid, with walls that were the same height all the way around. At the corners, there were four big square towers, and in the middle, there was a very important tower called the Keep tower.\n\nA long time ago, during the time of a king we'll call King David, this castle was built. It had a unique shape, like a five-sided figure, and was divided into three parts. The bottom part was used as a lock-up place and a place to keep weapons. The middle part was where the commander, we'll call him Commander Oliver, lived (now, it's used for little shows). And the top part was used for collecting special things.\n\nThere were also two big, old structures not too far from the town, near a little village by a river. These structures were built a really long time ago, even before anyone can remember. They were big and made of rocks, and you could tell where they were because of the stones that had fallen over. One of these structures was a big room shaped like a many-sided figure, and it was connected to a long hallway.\nThere is a very tall house that stands strong and measures more than 3 meters high. In a place called \"AN country\", there is a site where many people were laid to rest, possibly up to 142 people. This might be the largest number known in a place we'll call \"RE town\". There is another site named \"AN city\" where a special room and path to the east are found. This place isn't fully explored yet. But in another nearby site, a team from a university found remains of more than 118 people from a time long ago. Recent work done by the people who study old things, along with items they found (134 flat stones and 200 clay pots), show us that this place was more than just a resting place. It was a place where many areas were used for laying people to rest. \n\nThere is a tall stone called \"Menhir of BU city\", located 4 kms north of a place we'll call \"MO town\". This stone was recognized as something special on a day in late autumn many years ago. The tall stone was found in 1970. It was lying down and broken into pieces. It's base was measured to be 1,15x0,65m, and it had signs of damage caused by large wooden wedges. From what is left of it, it seems that this stone would never have been shorter than 4 meters. \n\nTo guess its original size, they made a base with a height they think it might have had in the region grandiorito.\nThere is a big stone made of a special kind of rock, standing as tall as a small tree. It has lots of pictures on it, like a sun, a curved stick, wavy lines, and zigzags. It was put back together a long time ago and it's very important. It's found a little far from a place called MO town.\n\nThere is another place called CR site. Here, they found more small stones near it, all kept safe in a list. This place was moved to a new spot and put back together again in 2004. \n\nMr. Adam and Mr. Leonel found this place, and Dr. Jack identified it in 1969. This spot isn't exactly a \"CR site\" because the stones aren't in a circle or oval shape.\n\nThere are 50 standing stones here, most are cracked, and some even look like shapes we can recognize. Many of the big stones were found lying down, but some were still standing. This helped to put the place back together.\n\nIn the middle of the area, there is a huge stone. It's as tall as a small tree, and weighs as much as seven big cars.\nA long time ago in RE town, in the FR country, there was a big tower called the SP tower. It was part of a big house that belonged to a noble family. This family was very important around the time when knights were still around and castles were a common sight. \n\nAn important man named Adam built this tower between two periods of time, which were significant for him. Adam was a helpful man who took care of the city and served a powerful leader. \n\nMany years later, in the 20th century, the tower became very important to everyone and they decided to protect it. \n\nThe tower was in a bit of a mess, so two men, Jack and Henry, bought it. They started a new project to make something really cool out of it. They wanted to turn it into a place where they could make really yummy grape juice. A long time ago, a company worked with the people in charge to fix up a really old, special building. They got permission and paid for everything themselves. They worked on it for four years. Then, in 2004, they opened the doors again and showed everyone lots of old things they found. \n\nThe building is square and is bigger than most buildings were back then. Over the years, it changed a lot. Now, it has a big door, a twisty staircase, a place to keep safe, and a small church with pretty pictures on the walls. They fixed all of this.\n\nIn a place called \"PE town\", they make a lot of pottery. There are about 22 places where they make pottery and lots of people who know how to do it. They've been making pottery the same way for hundreds of years. The pottery places in PE town have been around since a really long time ago, around the year 1276. There was a village called SP town in the FR country, known for its beautiful pottery. The pottery had special patterns that showed how people lived and what they liked in the village. This village was known as the biggest place for making pottery in the whole country.\n\nIn this village lived a man named Adam. Adam's family had been making pottery for many, many years. His grandfather, Frank, was the first one to start making pottery. Later, Adam's father, Cameron, took over the pottery making. Now, Adam was the one who made the pottery.\n\nIn 1997, Adam and his wife, Bella, decided to turn their family pottery making into a company. They called it \"Pottery Company\". They made beautiful pottery pieces that people from all over the world wanted to buy.\n\nLong, long ago, there was a place near the village called MO town. A man named Jack lived there. Jack really liked this place and bought it in the late middle ages. A long time ago, in the south of a country, Adam made a safe space called the Spur with the help of two towns. The Spur was one of the oldest places there. This place always belonged to important people.\n\nIn 1427, the Spur was protected from being split up. This is why it is still complete today. One of the first important people of the Spur was Cameron. Cameron was a leader of a well-known group in a big battle. The most important times for the Spur were in the second part of the 15th century, the entire 16th century, and the 17th century.\n\nThe Cameron family were important people in the country. They were involved in important moments of the country's history. While they were in charge, they built many landmarks in the Spur: a tower, a special place for Our Lady of Help, and the main gate. They also got approval to build a special place of worship in a big city. This place, built in 1529, was one of the first examples of a new style in the city. A long time ago, there was a famous painting made by a man named Patrick. His painting was loved by everyone, especially a lady named Hannah. She liked it so much that she wanted everyone to see it for many years to come. This happened in a time long ago when the king was a man named Matthew.\n\nThere was a rule that said the oldest child got everything when their parents were no longer there. This rule changed much later. A man named Mouzinho made new rules that stopped this from happening. \n\nThere was a big house that was owned by a family with the last name of \"A\". They owned it for a very long time until a company called \"FI\" bought it. They wanted to grow a lot of grapes there so they could make yummy juice.\n\nThis place has a very long history. People have lived there since a time when there were no cars or computers, even before there were kings and queens. \n\nPeople have found old things in this place that tell us about those old times. There were big stone buildings and other things that showed how people lived long ago. This place is very special because it is filled with stories, treasures, and lots of life. \n\nOne of the stories is about a man named Jack who liked to write poems and songs. We always remember him when we talk about this special place. There was a girl named Alice who loved to sing beautiful songs. She was like a princess from a story, and her songs made people feel happy and inspired.\n\nAlice lived in a place called \"AL country\". This place was famous for its delicious drinks and food. They made special drinks from grapes and olives that were loved by everyone. When Alice was born, not many people knew about AL country. But now, their drinks are famous all over the world because they are so tasty and special.\n\nAL country also has many other good things. They have tasty bread, herbs, olives, oil, and cheeses made from goats and sheep. They also have delicious meat from lambs and pigs. People can visit AL country to taste these special things. They can go to the farms, shops, or restaurants there. If they want to contact AL country, they can send an email to \"r@alcountry.com\" or visit their website at \"http://www.alcountry.com\". In the river, you can find fish, and in the forest, you can find animals like bunnies, birds, and big wild animals. There are many different types of food to eat. Some of these foods use fish, others use pork meat, and some even use plants like asparagus. You can also find soup made from a big fish, stew made from a small animal, and food made from beans and a kind of animal that jumps a lot. You can also find food that uses wine and garlic. There are many types of food to try!\n\nPeople also like to make sweets using eggs, sugar, almonds, and walnuts. They make a dessert using eggs and almonds, and a sweet dish using rice.\n\nThe land is used to grow plants that give us grapes and olives. From these plants, people make olive oil and wine. The olive oil and wine are very good. There are many places that make wine, and some of them are very famous. Their wine is loved by many people.\n\nHere are some of the food you can find:\nSoups:\nSoup from a big pot\nSoup with fried meat\nA special pork dish\nStew made from a small animal\nSoup made from bread and garlic\nFood made from beans, oil, and vinegar\nSalad made from peppers\nFood made from pig's ear with a plant called coriander.\nThere's a place that makes yummy things like egg candy with nuts and something called Sericaia. This place is in a big country and it's on a big road. They also make olive oil. When they first started, their stuff was so good that they won a big prize in a really important contest in a far away country. A lot of people from all over the world were in the contest. They won because their olive oil was really good and because the bottle and the label were really nice. This made them feel really happy and proud because they were the only ones from their country to win. They also won two more prizes in another contest in their own country. They got a silver medal for one of their olive oils and a bronze medal for another one. This shows that they always try to make the best things.\nThere's a place called the BR building in a town. This building is where they make really good juice from grapes and yummy oil from olives. The BR building was made a long time ago, around the time when your grandparents were little kids. \n\nBack then, people didn't make juice from grapes in this town, they grew lots of grain instead. But some people thought grapes could grow well here, so they tried. Even though it was hard, they didn't give up. Because of the good weather and the special types of grapes, they could keep making the juice.\n\nAs time went on, more and more people started to like the juice from this town. They thought it tasted really good. The people who made the juice also started using new machines to make it even better. Now, they make some of the best grape juice in the whole country! There is a place called AL country where people work together to grow things and share new ways to do their work. One of these groups is called Adam's Group. They have a big building in a place called MO city where they make grape juice that turns into a special drink for grown-ups called wine. \n\nAdam's Group was started by 60 friends in the year when your grandparents might have been kids. Today, many people know that their wine is very good. They are the biggest group making this special drink in AL country.\n\nNow, Adam's Group has around 900 friends working together. They make many different kinds of wine - some are light, some are dark, and some are even bubbly! They also make a special kind of juice from olives.\n\nAdam's Group has won more than 250 awards because their drinks are so good. They can make this special drink because they have good things to grow their grapes, a lot of hard-working friends, and a very big place to work. They can take a lot of grapes, make a lot of bottles, and store a lot of wine. This makes Adam's Group one of the biggest places making this special drink!\nWe want you to visit us and see how we make wine at our Company!

The \"MP Hill\" is part of \"GE Vineyard\".\nThe \"GE Vineyard\" has been in the \"Gabriel\" family since 2001. This place used to belong to Mr. Damian and later, a famous music man named \"Liam\" lived here. He made some of his best music at this place. This place has always been filled with art and free thinking.\nIn their big winery, they use good materials like special stone and oak wood to make wine. All the wines are made under the watchful eyes of the team led by \"Patrick\" and inspired by \"Henry\".\n\"Henry\" has been working for a long time in the public and private sectors. He has a lot of connection with the wine world, especially through his work at a foundation. Since 2001, he started his own project of making wines. His passion for making wine is now shown in the heart of the region where he was born. He creates special wines using his knowledge and gives them his name.\nThe story here is about a fun trip. A friend named Adam took a tour around a place called AR area. He also planned a dreamy celebration. He liked to explore different places and one of them was the PT country. He also found a cool map that showed him where to find yummy grapes in PT country. He discovered an interesting map about PT country too.

Even though this is a food for people, it might be used by puppy and kitty friends. \n\nThere's a big recall notice about this food. A company called Abbott, which makes Similac, said that they are asking for three groups of Similac food to be returned. This food is very special and is used for little babies who were born too early, but only after they go home from the hospital. This food is sold in small bottles and can be found in many pharmacies and is usually bought when a doctor says to. There is a type of baby food that isn't usually found in stores. Some boxes of this baby food are being taken back because they don't have as much iron as they should. No one has gotten very sick because of this yet.\n\nBabies who were born early and eat this food for a long time after they leave the hospital might not get enough iron. This could make them weak. If mommies and daddies are worried about their baby, they should talk to a doctor.\n\nOnly some boxes of the baby food are being taken back. They have specific numbers on them. No other types of this baby food are being taken back.\n\nThe baby food with the specific numbers was given to stores between a time in the late 2000's. If someone bought this baby food and it has one of the specific numbers on it, they should call a special phone number. The people there will give them new baby food for free.\n\nThis baby food is really special. It's used for babies who were born early for a little while after they leave the hospital.

{"text": "A long time ago, a man named Ryan went to a place called HA city for a big music project. But, some people couldn't come because of problems with their travel papers. Ryan didn't want to waste the chance, so he spent a week making music with musicians he had and some new ones he found. This turned into a big success, and they made music, movies, and concerts that shared and celebrated a special type of dance music.\n\nThis story helps us understand a group of musicians and their big music project, \"Where's the One?\". This group became popular in the early 21st century. They played a type of music called \"Congotronics\", which mixes regular rock music with traditional drums, a small piano you play with your thumbs, and other instruments made from leftover materials. This type of music started with a band called K1, who had been playing in KI city for many years, and then other bands and musicians started playing it too.\n\nIn the early 21st century, a music company made a big album to celebrate Congotronics. Artists from Adam to Samuel made their own versions of this new and popular type of music. In a big music project, artists from a music group, along with musicians from AM city and Europe, joined forces. They worked together through writing songs, practicing, and finally going on a tour. A drummer named Greg, worked hard to blend the live music with studio sessions. This work is now shared with everyone as \"Where's the One?\".\n\nThis big music group also included musicians like Matthew, Jessica, and a band called \"Wildbirds & Peacedrums\". They all experimented a lot with their music. They made a lot of music that was full of energy and imagination. The music was very lively and they repeated their musical themes like weaving a thick thread.\n\nIn their music, they found joy and excitement in songs like \"Banza Banza\" and \"Hand To The Knee/Tshimbala Mulumbayi.\" They made strange, yet interesting sounds in \"Chateau Rouge\" and \"Bombo & Sifflets.\" And with the help of female singers, they brought pop and rock sounds into their songs like \"Doubt/Hope\" and \"Mulume/Change.\"\nThis story is about a big music album called \"Where's the One?\". It's really long with 21 songs, and even longer if you count two extra ones. It's so big it might seem too much. It started with simple songs that got bigger and bigger. They were played to lots of people with a big band and then worked on for a long time. But don't worry, the album is like three smaller parts. The middle part is like a rest with short songs and quiet sounds. It has small groups playing and even some quieter songs. This part is good because it's different and gives your ears a break.\nJust like a famous music group did a long time ago, \"Where's the One?\" is like a trip to a new place in the world of music. It tries to help the musicians and bring new happy sounds from places people don't usually hear. Their journey is full of rhythm and lots of energy.\nThere are other albums too, like one from a group called \"Kokoko!\" and another one called \"AM country Dream\". There's also a cool one called \"Electricity\".\nA group of people from around the world make music together.

{"text": "There is a story about a school for leaders in a place we will call IS country. This school is special because boys and girls learn together. A teacher, who we will call Mr. Y, tells us about his experiences. He admits that he is not scared when girls cry anymore. But then, he also says that when girls cry, it bothers the boys. He thinks some crying is okay, but too much crying is not. This shows how even when boys and girls are together in the same school, some old ideas about boys and girls still exist. In a far-off place called IS country, there are people who wear uniforms and help keep their country safe. These people, called soldiers, come in all types, including both boys and girls. Sometimes, the way the soldiers learn to do their jobs isn't fair to the girls. Even when the rules are changed to be fair, girls still find it hard to do the same work as the boys. This is because people have different ideas about what boys and girls should do. These ideas make it hard for girls to become soldiers, even though they work just as hard as the boys. Being a soldier is very important in IS country, and if you can't be a soldier, people might not think you are as important. This isn't fair, and it's something that needs to change.  107.

Even though gas is used a lot to make power, using the sun is getting more popular too. Right now, about 16 out of 100 parts of all power in the US is clean.

{"text": "A singer named Oliver had to delay his performances this year, including one in a big park in HE city, because he got hurt. He said today that he needs to take a break from all his shows in NA region and EU region. This is because he got hurt when he was unwell with a bad cough and cold.\n\nOliver, who is very famous and has won many awards, recently fell down at his home in LA city. This made some old injuries from a big fall in 2003 worse, and he needed to see the doctor last month. He will still need to see the doctor in LA city while he gets better.\n\n\"I feel very sad that I have to change the dates of more shows. I can't say how upset, mad, and down I am not to be able to sing right now. But I'm very thankful for all the love and help I'm getting from my family, my band, friends, and fans; it's really what's helping me keep going,\" said Oliver.\n\n\"Just know that I am getting better every day. I will be fully better. I will finish my tour. I will be back!\"\n\nThe shows will be moved to start in the second month of next year, and people who want to see the show are being told to keep their original tickets, as they can use them for the new dates. There was a big music show planned in 2019 but some of the dates have to be moved. One of the shows at a big park was moved from one day in June to another day in June the next year. We don't know yet if a band will join the main singer on the new date. The main singer started a goodbye tour in a place called AL town last year and wanted to travel and perform this year with his friends who play guitar, bass, drums, and keyboards. \n\nThe goodbye tour, which is a second one after a tour in 1992, started in 2018 in SA country with shows in three countries, followed by many shows in EU continent. His tour in NA continent with a famous rock band started in AL town at the end of August, but the last four shows have to be moved so the singer can get better from being sick. \n\nYou can still buy tickets for the show. You can buy them at the big building, online, or by calling a phone number. The main singer is saying goodbye with this tour after singing for more than 50 years, both by himself and with a band that started in the late 20th century. A famous singer is going on his last big trip around the world to sing, but he might still sing at a few special shows later on. He has sung a lot of songs that many people love, and he's sold more than 100 million records.\n\nThe singer says, \"People keep asking me when I'm stopping. I will stop traveling around the world, but maybe I'll sing a few times here and there. I've been really lucky to have sung so many great songs. This last trip is a big party for my fans and everyone who likes my music.\"\n\nEven though the singer is 70 years old, he's still very popular. He's won important awards, and his songs are still played everywhere, like on TV, in movies, on the radio, and at big sports games.\n\nA long time ago, the singer was part of a band. They got back together in 2011, and they made a new album in 2013. It was very popular and lots of people liked it. The people who made the album were the singer, Thomas, and Gabriel. In a year not too long ago, a group of musicians won an important music award for their special song. This happened because they played their music very well. One of the musicians, let's call him Oliver, received another award for helping others who also love music. This was a big party where they celebrated music and those who make it. Oliver also got a third award in a big city in EU country. This was also the year when Oliver's big music festival, which travels all around the world, turned 20 years old.\n\nTwo years later, the group of musicians, which included Oliver, said they were going to stop playing music together. This made many people feel sad because they loved their music. They had their last shows in a big place in BI city.\n\nThere were also pictures from a music festival with lots of different musicians. This festival was held at a big stadium. There were also other music bands from the past who played their music at a vineyard when it was warm. And there were more musicians who played their music at a large building in HE city when it was summer.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "4bd7dfc44844ecc2f3a50ec8a43560f4966a228e58e71294d9d31345ee6441ad"}
{"text": "Sometimes, people who make rules like to talk about small things that don't really matter, just to look good. Today, there are two stories in the news about this. One story is about the rule makers and the other story is about the people who help run things.\n\nSome rule makers are upset about a big sale. They have written a letter asking the people who run things to stop the sale until certain special deals are taken away and the people who made these deals are in trouble for not taking care of the money.\n\nThe rule makers know better than anyone that these special deals can't be taken away. This is because the rules for these deals were made by them and agreed on by the people who run things. If they tried to take these deals away, a judge would say no, and it would make it hard for the people who run things to get people to invest money in the future. They can ask for these special deals to stop in the future, but they can't change the rules for deals that already happened. The rule makers know this, but they are trying to look good. They should talk about the sale of shares in a big company, which they know they can't stop but at least they can argue about.\n\nThe people who run things, on the other hand, decided to take back a piece of land they gave to a group. In the past, they gave land to this group to build a car factory. But the deal didn't happen, because the people who run things wouldn't promise to buy a certain number of cars from the factory. They wanted to sell 1000 cars per year to the army. There was a big decision made in a place known as MA town. This town is not known for making heavy things like cars or machines. Once, there was a glass factory there, but it didn't work out, even though there's great sand for making glass close by. The leaders of the town took back some big piece of land from a man we'll call Benjamin. This land might not be worth much, but the leaders want to show they are strong. \n\nPeople might not believe the leaders or the people in charge are doing the right thing. We need to remember, people are very smart and can understand what's going on. \n\nThere are two pieces of news that tell us some information. Before, there used to be news that said, \"The leaders met today and talked about many important things.\"\n\nBenjamin is moving to a place called LO city. He wanted the leaders to give him electricity, water, and land in MA town, but it seems like his plan didn't work out.\n\nTwo friends, let's call them Isaac and Benjamin, are talking about this. Isaac isn't sure which way of doing things is better. Benjamin thinks that the first Benjamin can use the money he got from selling cars. \n\nThere's also news that a man named Zachary is no longer around.\nA man named Matthew goes on a journey.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "02daf0d79db3d3308d25cb10bde03e87f6862b8ad95627a8811c7407192f363f"}

{"text": "A story about how to share a soccer team\nOne sunny day, a big soccer game took place. The LI team joined the game in the third round because they are a very good team. Thomas scored a third goal before Michael had to leave the game. The WH team tied the game with a goal from Tony and then took the lead with another goal, this time from Adam. The WH team started the game with a great goal from Matthew that flew past Charlie in the 17th minute. William was very popular in the WE place. Traders who sold soft furs moved to the WE place years before two explorers. Liam is a great player who makes up for not being very strong by being good at playing soccer. The coach thought about having Ryan and Andy play in a different position, but with Chris not playing because he was hurt, Ryan and Andy started playing on the sides. In this way, the ball is always moving, allowing a steady flow of the game. However, one week after the game, a big fire burned through the city, destroying a lot of it - including a big building. The president had read many old stories about the WE place, including mentions of mountains made of salt.\n\nThe trip was mostly peaceful, but the men did have to stop two people, because they were trying to take something during the night. A long trip started a long time ago. People traveled from one side of the country to the other side, a very long way. In those old days, they had to use boats, animals, and their own feet to travel -- it was about 8,000 miles. Do you know how many groups are in the big soccer league? There are two teams, one started a long time ago in 1905, and the other in 1919. They played in different levels of the league. Neither team won a big prize before a big war a long time ago. In our quiz about battles, do you know anything about a big fight between two countries? In fact, there are many armies with vehicles that can go from water to land, taking the fight to the enemy's home.\n\nThe team won 3-0 at home against another team in their next game, played a while ago. Another team did very well in their first home game, scoring 5 goals. At the top of a very good team, a player focused on the most important part, scoring goals. After a long time, they met some people, and they were friendly. There's a big place where people watch games. It was built a long time ago after a big war, and was officially opened by a king. It has 90,000 seats in three levels. How much do you know about trips people have made to MA planet? Do you know how people living near the border felt when the US and MX countries made loud threats? This was a good chance for another country, led by people like Zachary and Winfield, to take control of land in MX country.\n\nThere's a really special spoon in the world, used when a new king or queen starts their job. It's just over 10 inches long, and has beautiful pictures cut into it. Even though making video games makes a lot of money, many people who help make the games have to work in not-so-nice places, work a lot of hours, and worry about their work place closing all the time. How many people did the men of the journey hurt? Native Americans liked to eat dog meat, so the men (except for Clark) on the journey ate dogs, too. The US might have the most wins in space trips, but people from the US aren't always the first ones to go on space trips. The Native Americans were interested by his dark skin, and they often thought he had special powers. Four groups of SP country soldiers went into the wild to catch the Discovery Team. They sent at least four groups to catch all the men on the journey. ST city and LE city will fight to win the 2022 prize. \n\nHere's how to sell a LE city United.\nA team from LI city joined a big game in round three because they were really good. Benjamin made a third goal before Matthew had to leave the game. WH team got a goal from a header by Thomas and then another header by Adam won the game. WH team first scored with a far shot from Michael which went past Charles in the 17th minute. William was almost like a hero out in the WE country. The successful trade of warm coats pushed men from Europe to the WE country years before Liam and Charles. Ryan is a talented player who makes up for his less power with his smartness. Gabriel has said both Ryan and Adam can play a deeper midfield role but with Christopher not playing, Ryan and Adam start out wide. This way, the pump keeps pushing out fluid, allowing a steady flow of gas (and therefore a steady fire). One week after it was approved, however, a big fire burned through the city, ruining most of it - including the big church. The president had read many older stories about the WE country, including mentions of mountains made of salt. The trip was mostly safe, but the men did have to stop two natives, because they were trying to take guns in the night. A long trip began a long time ago. People had to travel a great distance to reach the big ocean. They had to use boats, animals, and even walk for thousands of miles. Can you guess how far they had to go? \n\nThere's a big soccer game with many teams. Two teams, one created a long time ago and the other a little later, often moved between the top two levels. Neither of them won a big prize before a big war. \n\nDo you know about a big fight that happened between two countries? Today, some armies can go from the sea to the land easily, taking the fight to the other side.\n\nIn their next game, one team won 3-0 at their home against another team. Another team played really well at their first home game, scoring 5-0 with help from their players. One player was really focused and scored a lot of goals. \n\nIt took three months before they met any new friends, but they were nice. The big field where they play games was built a long time ago after a big war, and officially opened by a king. It can hold a lot of people - 90,000 to be exact! Do you know about the trips people have made to the red planet? Have you heard how folks living near each other reacted when the leaders of their countries argued? This was a good chance for another country, guided by leaders like Zachary and William, to show their control over the other country's lands.\n\nDid you know about the most special spoon in the world? It's used to bless the new king and is just over 10 and one half inches long with beautiful pictures carved on it. Making games is a big business. But, the people who make the games sometimes have to work in tough conditions. They work for long hours and are always worried about losing their jobs.\n\nDid you know about the journey of some brave men? Some people they met on their journey were hurt. The men on the journey liked to eat dog meat, just like the people they met. The people from the other country thought that their leader was magical because of his dark skin. Soldiers tried four times to stop the journey of these brave men. They wanted to arrest all the men on the journey. Two teams will compete to win the 2022 trophy.\n\nIf you liked this story and want to learn more about a special jersey, visit our website.\nA big city team played a game.

The second team made the first goal with a great long shot from Matthew that went past Cameron in the 17th minute. William was almost a hero out West. The successful fur trade made European men move west many years before two famous explorers. Liam is a talented player who makes up for his less strong power by being good at the game. David and Adam will be looked at in a deeper central role but with Chris being out with an injury, David and Adam start out wide. In this way, the pump is always pushing out fluid, allowing a continuous flow of gas (and therefore a continuous flame). One week after it was accepted, however, a big fire raged through the city, destroying most of it - including a big building. The president had read many older stories of the West, including mentions of mountains made of salt. The trip was mostly without physical fights, but the men did hurt two Native Americans, because they were trying to take guns during the night. A long, long time ago, a group of brave adventurers started a journey on May 4. They set off from a place called LO city and traveled all the way to the PA ocean. Can you guess how far they went? In those old days, they didn't have cars or trains. They had to use boats, ride animals, or just walk. They journeyed about 8,000 miles! \n\nDid you know some games have teams? Just like the games you might play with your friends. In the early days, there were two teams that started playing these games. One in 1905, and another in 1919. Sometimes they did well, sometimes not so much. They hadn't won any big prizes before a big war happened. \n\nDo you like quizzes? Here's a tough one. Do you know about a big disagreement that happened between two countries? It's called the ME country-AM country War. There were big ships that could sail on the sea and then go straight to the land. They could take the fight right to the bad guys' front door!\n\nThe next part of our story is about a game. One team won 3-0 in their home city against another team on March 26. Another team won their first game at home by a score of 5-0, thanks to some great players. One of them was the best at scoring goals. \n\nThe adventurers met some new friends after three months of traveling. They were friendly and kind. Did you know some cities have big places where they play games? One of these places was built after a big war. It was opened on April 23, 1924, by a king. It was big enough for 90,000 people to sit and watch the games! Do you know a lot about the trips people have made to the red planet? Did you hear about how folks on both sides of the land line reacted when two big countries started arguing? This was a great chance for another country, led by smart men like Zachary and William, to step up and take control of land that belonged to the other country. \n\nThere is a very special spoon in the world, used for a special ceremony. The spoon is just over 10 and a half inches long, and has pretty pictures on it. Even though making games is a big business, people who make the games have to work really hard. They work long hours and they are always worried that they might lose their jobs. \n\nHow many people did the men on the trip hurt?

It is just over 10 and a half inches long and has pretty pictures on it. Making video games is a big business, but the people who make them often have to work very hard. They work long hours and always worry about losing their jobs. Do you know how many people the men on a big trip hurt? The Native People liked to eat dog meat, so the men on the trip ate dogs too, except for Clark. The AM country may have done a lot of cool things in space, but AM country people are not always the first ones to go on space trips. The Native People were very interested in a man with dark skin and they thought he had magic powers. Four groups of SP soldiers went into the wild to find the Discovery Group. They sent at least four groups to catch all the men on the trip. ST team and LE team will compete to win the 2022 trophy.\nHere's how a big football game went. A team from LI city played in the third round because they are one of the best teams. David scored three goals before Liam had to leave the game. Another team, WH team, evened the score with a goal from Tom and then they scored a winning goal from Adam. WH team scored the first goal with a great shot from Matthew. In the west part of the country, there was a man named William who was very respected. Many men moved west long before two explorers named Lewis and Clark because they wanted to trade in furs, which was a good way to make money. Another man named Liam was very good at playing football even though he wasn't very strong, because he was smart when he played. Two players named Ryan and Adam might play in a different position because another player, Christian, was hurt. They always keep the ball moving in the game, which keeps the game exciting. A big fire happened in the city one week after they agreed on something, and it destroyed many things, including a big church. The leader of the country had read many old stories about the west, including some about mountains made of salt. The journey to the west was mostly safe, but they did have to protect themselves from two people who tried to take their things while they were sleeping. A long trip started a very long time ago. They had to travel from one side of the land to the other, walking a lot of steps. Can you guess how many steps they took? They had to walk, ride animals, and even use boats for this long trip -- it was about 8,000 steps long! \n\nDo you know how many groups play in the Big Soccer League? Two teams, one called 'C' team and the other 'L' team, have been playing for a very long time. Both teams had good and not so good times, and neither of them won a big prize before a big fight happened all over the world. \n\nIn our quiz, do you know anything about a big fight that happened between MX country and the US country? In fact, there are many armies that have special vehicles that can go from sea to land, bringing the fight to the other side's home.\n\n'L' team won 3-0 at their home against 'B' team in their next game, which happened a while after. 'M' team won really big in their first game at home, with a score of 5-0, thanks to 'G', 'J', and 'K'. At the top of a very good 'M' team, 'K' focused on the most important thing, making goals. In the end, it took them three months to meet any people from other tribes, and they were very friendly. A big field was once called the Empire Field and was built after a big war. It was opened on a special day by a king. It has many, many seats. Did you learn about the trips people have sent to Mars? Do you know how people felt when the leaders of two countries were arguing? This was a chance for another country, led by Zachary and Winfield, to take over some land.\n\nThere is a very special spoon in the world. It is used for a special ceremony when a new king or queen is crowned. It is more than 10 inches long and has beautiful pictures on it. Making games is a big business. But, some people who make the games have to work a lot and might lose their jobs. How many people were hurt by the men on an expedition? The local people liked to eat dog meat, so the men also ate it. The U.S. has done a lot in space, but they were not always the first. The local people were surprised by a man's dark skin. They thought he had magic powers. Some soldiers tried to catch the team of explorers. Four groups were sent to find all the men on a big adventure. Two teams, SH team and LR team, are going to see who will win the big game of 2022. A famous city team joined the competition in the third round because they are very good. Thomas scored another point before Matthew had to leave the game. WH team scored a point with a header from Thomas and then another header from Adam. WH team started the scoring with a great long shot from Mark, which went past Tim in the 17th minute. Y city was really great out in the WC place. The fur trade made European men go west before Liam and Chris. RL is a talented player who makes up for his less strong points by being smart when he plays. Both Ryan and Adam could be looked at for a more central role, but with CP out with an injury, Ryan and Adam start out wide. The pump keeps pushing fluid out, allowing a steady flow of fuel and a constant burst of fire. One week after it was approved, however, a big fire swept through the city, destroying most of it - including the big church. A long time ago, a leader read many old tales about the West, even stories about mountains made of salt. He and his friends went on a long trip. They didn't have much trouble, but they had to stop two people from taking their things while they were asleep. Their journey started on a sunny day and they traveled from one side of the country to the other. They walked, rode on animals, and sailed in boats for a very long trip. Do you know how many teams play in a big soccer league? Two soccer teams were created a long time ago and they played in different leagues. They didn't win a big prize before a big war. Do you know about a big fight between two countries? Some armies have special machines that can move from the sea to the land. They took the fight to the enemy's home.\n\nIn another game, a team scored 3 goals against another team. Then, another team scored 5 goals in their first home game, thanks to great plays from their players. They focused on scoring goals, which is very important in soccer. After a long time, the people met some friends from the local tribes. The big sports place, once called the Empire Stadium, was built after a big war. It was opened by a king many years ago, and it has lots of seats. Do you know about the trips people have made to the Red Planet? And about how the people felt when there was trouble between the US and ME countries? This was a chance for another country, with leaders like Zachary and William, to take control of ME lands.\n\nThe spoon used for the new king's special event is probably the most valuable spoon in the world. It's not too big, and it has pretty designs on it. Making games is a big job that makes a lot of money, but the people who make the games often have to work a lot and are always worried about losing their jobs. How many people were hurt by the men on the trip? The local tribe people liked to eat dog meat, so the men on the trip ate it too, except for Clark. The US has done lots of great things in space, but they weren't always the first. The local tribe people were very interested in one man's dark skin, and they thought he had magic powers. Four groups of FR country soldiers went into the wild to find the Discovery Team. They sent four groups to find all the team's men. Two teams, SH team and LR team, will compete for the 2022 award. \n\nLR team joined the contest in the third round because of their top place in the league. Benjamin scored a third goal before David was told to leave the game. WH team tied the game with a goal from Thomas and then won the game with another goal from Adam. WH team scored first with a great long shot from Matthew that went past Thomas in the 17th minute. YE city was almost like a dream out west. The fur business made European men go west many years before LC team. Liam is a good player who makes up for his lack of strength by being smart in the game. Gabriel has said both Ryan and Adam could play in a middle position but with Christopher hurt, Ryan and Adam start on the side. In this way, the pump keeps pushing out fluid, allowing a stream of fuel (and so a blast of fire). One week after it was okayed, however, a big fire in LN city went through the city, destroying most of it - including the big church. A man named Patrick had read lots of old tales about the West, including stories about mountains that looked like they were made of salt. Patrick and his friends went on a big journey. They started their journey on a sunny spring day. They traveled a very long way, from their town to the big ocean, which was about the same distance as walking around the playground 8,000 times!\n\nAlong the way, they had to use boats, ride animals, and walk a lot. There was some trouble during the journey. Patrick and his friends thought two people were trying to take their things, so they had to stop them.\n\nIn a faraway place called ER country, there are two soccer teams that were started a long time ago. One team started when your grandparents were just babies, and the other started when your great-grandparents were babies. These teams played many games, but they didn't win any big prizes until after a big, scary war.\n\nDid you know there was a big fight between two countries, called the MA fight? In this fight, some groups had special boats that could go from the sea straight to the land. They could take the fight right to the enemy's home.\n\nIn a more recent game, one team, Ulysses's team, played really well at home and won against another team. In another place, a team in MR country played really well in their first home game and scored five goals. A player named Gabriel scored two goals, James also scored two, and Kevin scored one. Gabriel was the best player on his team. He did his job really well and scored lots of goals. After a long time, the group finally met some friendly people who lived in the area. There was a big place where people could watch games. It was built a long time ago and opened by a king. It could hold a lot of people. Do you know about the adventures we've sent to the Red Planet? Did you know how folks living near the border felt when the leaders of their countries were not getting along? This was a chance for a new group, led by Zachary and Winfield, to take control of the land.\n\nThere's a very special spoon in the world, used for a special ceremony. It's a little longer than your hand and has pretty pictures on it. Even though making video games is a big business, the people who make them don't always have the best jobs. They work a lot and sometimes their offices might close. Do you know how many people the group hurt? The local people liked to eat dog meat, so the group did too, except for Clark. Even though we've done a lot of cool things in space, we weren't always the first. The local people were really interested in one of the group because of his dark skin. They thought he might have magic powers. Four teams of explorers set off into the wild to find a group of adventurers. They sent out at least four teams to find all the men of the adventure. Two teams will compete for the 2022 trophy. \n\nA Guide On How To Share Your Favorite Team\nA team entered the game in the third round, because they are a top team. Thomas scored a third before Matt was asked to leave during the last minutes. WH team tied the game with a jump and hit from Tom and won with another jump and hit, this time from Adam. WH team started the game with an amazing far shot from Michael which went past the keeper in the 17th minute. William was very respected out in the wild. The successful fur trade brought European men to the wild a few years before Adam and Charlie. Ryan is a talented player who makes up for his not-so-strong power by being smart at the plate. Benjamin has mentioned both Ryan and Adam can be looked at in a deeper central midfield position but with Charlie being hurt, Ryan and Adam start out wide. In this way, the pump is always pushing out fluid, allowing a continuous flow of fuel (and therefore a continuous fire). One week after it was approved, however, a big fire of LO city raged through the city, destroying most of it - including the big church. A leader read a lot about the West, including stories about mountains made of salt. They went on a big adventure, which started around spring. The trip was mostly peaceful, but they had to protect themselves from two people who tried to take their things at night. To travel, they used boats, animals, and walked a lot -- about 8,000 miles. \n\nSpeaking of teams, do you know how many teams play in a big English soccer league? Two teams, let's call them 'CA team' and 'LE team', started a long time ago. They moved up and down in their early years, and didn't win a big prize until after a big war. \n\nIn our fun quiz, can you tell us anything about a big fight between two countries? Actually, there are many groups that have machines that can go from water to land, taking the fight to the other side. \n\nIn their next match, 'UN team' won 3-0 at home against 'BI team'. In another match, 'MA team' beat 'RB team' 5-0, with two players scoring twice and one player scoring once. The best player of 'MA team' focused on the most important thing, scoring goals. After a long time, which felt like three moons, they made friends with some new people. This big field with lots of seats was built long ago, at the end of a big war. A king opened it on a sunny day and it has lots of seats. Have you ever thought about how we send things to the red planet? Or how people felt when two big countries were not being nice to each other? This was a chance for another big group, led by Zachary and Winfield, to take over new lands. \n\nThere is a very special spoon that is used when a new king or queen is chosen. It is just a bit longer than your hand and has pretty pictures on it. Even though making games makes a lot of money, some people who make the games don't have a nice place to work. They work for a long time and are always worried about losing their jobs. How many people did the men hurt on their journey? The new friends they made liked to eat dog meat, so the men also tried it. The people from the new place are really good at sending things to space, but they are not always the first to do it. The new friends were surprised by one man's dark skin and thought he had special powers. Four groups of FR country's helpers went into the wild to find the Team of Explorers. They made sure to send out at least four teams to find all the boys from the expedition. Team HE and Team LR are going to play a game to see who will be the winner of the year. \nDiscover How to Trade Team LU\nCopyright  Future el.net | Supported by Co.WordPress Theme", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "6a2b75d541517934afb3dd85dba9fbdfbc381ee8f36d6516765102fb3b5fc6ef"}
{"text": "Madison is thinking of new fun activities to do at the big lake. The city helpers are looking for someone who can make a big plan for having fun at the lake. We are not sure if we can use boats at the lake just yet. This is a story from a news website. \n\nWilliam, a news writer, shared this story in the early morning and updated it in the afternoon. The city helpers want more fun activities at the big lake. \n\nThe big lake is a favorite place to rent boats, get fishing stuff, and sign up boats for the lake. The big lake is famous for its big fishes. \n\nA group of helpers in the city want to make a bike path around the big lake. They want to connect it to another lake and some nearby paths. \n\nA big boat heads out into a growing wind at the big lake. The big lake, which is 820 acres, is located to the north of the city and just to the west of a big road. There's a lovely lake called FR Lake. It's big and beautiful, and you can see the best sunset ever there! There's a place where people can fish and a marina. But guess what? The marina is very old and may need to be changed. \n\nPeople are thinking about how to make FR Lake even more fun. They want to bring in someone who can help with that. They're also working on a plan to make bike trails around the lake. Can you imagine? Riding a bike around a big, beautiful lake! That would be so much fun.\n\nThere's also a club that wants to build a playground near the lake. It will be a special playground where all kids can play. They want to make it big, with lots of new things to play on!\n\nPeople are also talking about making FR Lake a place where everyone can come to play and relax, just like they did with another lake. That would be so cool, wouldn't it?\nA beautiful sunset can be seen at FL lake. Mr. William doesn't think a new park can be made unless they find a way to pay for it. He says, \"FL lake is a great place for families to have fun. But because it's where our water comes from, we need to make sure we don't harm the water.\"\n\nTwo plans for a boat area were made. Around the same time, they wanted to find someone to take care of the boat area. The floating dock is very old and needs to be changed soon.\n\nTwo plans were given. One was from a couple, Peter and Penelope, who have been taking care of the boat area since 2012. They want to build a new boat area that would have more space for boats and a bigger shop for more people.\n\nMr. Matthew, head of the Water Group, said his team could take care of the boat area in a way that would teach people about water quality and water sources.\nThere was a man named Adam who had an idea. He wanted to make a special spot for people to put their little boats in the water. This place was needed because the current spot was always too busy with people trying to put their big boats in the water.\n\nThere is a big lake, located up north and just to the west of a big road. This lake is very large, about the same size as 820 football fields put together!\n\nBut not everyone liked Adam's idea. At a big meeting, a man named Samuel, who helps run things, said they should hire a helper to look at all the fun things to do at the lake before they make a new spot for boats.\n\nA long time ago, when the lake was made, the city made a rule that the lake had to be used for fishing fun. But it didn't say anything about making a new spot for boats.\n\nThey had some money set aside to make a new boat spot, but they're waiting to see what the helper says in his big report.\n\nA lady named Pam was a little worried. She hoped to make the boat place bigger and sell it later. They also rented little boats, sold fishing stuff, and had space for people to keep their boats.\n\nThe lake is a fun place to rent boats, buy fishing stuff, and get your boat ready for the lake. Pam and her family also started fun nighttime boat rides when the moon was full, which a lot of people really liked.\nA woman is worried about what will happen when her job ends because the people she works for are not thinking about her ideas. She said, \"I'm worried about the next season. I need to write letters to our friends who have boats here, but I'm not sure what to say. Are the people I work for making a new place for the boats? Do I tell our friends they need to move their boats soon? I don't have all the answers.\"\nA man who looks after the water said they might get some new helpers for the boat place after the woman's job ends and while they decide what to do next.\nThey will think about what a helper has told them to do. \"The boat place will stay until we have a full plan,\" said the man. \"At the end of the year, we're not going to close the boat place. We plan to keep it open until we have the helper's report and decide what to do.\"\nFR country lake is a special place because of its big fish. People who like to fish and sail love it. The lake is famous for its fish and also for the big fish that have been put there for many years. There's a path for walking through the woods, a special place for fishing, and places to have picnics by the water.\nThe lake is a fun place for boats, small canoes, and water skiing, but only small engines are allowed. There are two big roofs and two little play areas that everyone can use. The lake is open from when the sun comes up until it goes down.\n\nAdam, a leader of a group in SP city, is working hard to raise money for a new play area. All the groups in SP city are helping with the lake play area project. There is a special dock for people who like to fish on one side of the lake.\n\nAdam said, \"We are very happy about it. We saw that people need this. When we talked with other important people, they were happy to see something like this in SP city.\"\n\nIf everything goes well, Adam said the old roof and old play area near where the boats go in the water would be taken away. A new roof would be built and a lot of new play things that everyone can use would be put in. He said this might take one or two years.\n\nHe also said, \"It will be called the KP at FL lake.\"\n\nIf FL lake is going to be a bigger fun place for SP city, a lot depends on what the people who know a lot about this say. William shared his hope that the project plan would be ready by the time the year ends. There is a group that wants to create a bike path around a large lake and connect it to another lake and nearby paths. William explained that the person who will help with the project hasn't been chosen yet. They will look at different fun activities that could help the community and also be suitable for a lake that provides water. He said they want to see if there are other places where bike paths, boating places, and water providing lakes can be together. \"We have this wonderful land on the north side. We're really excited about it,\" William said. \n\nThere was a question about why a certain spot near the lake isn't open to the public. There was also news about someone catching a big fish at the lake. Other news included a company confirming layoffs, a story hour causing a debate, a coffee shop closing, and an investigation into a serious car accident.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "04d2879eb1660516e6bf47930c3bad399aa8631dcb5f6bf7968d3596a666ca4d"}

{"text": "Wind & Sun Energy Stories\nA special book about renewable energy\nEnergy from the Sun\nSpecial Stories\n5 Cool ideas to make sure wind farm plans are liked by everyone\nWind energy around the world is growing fast, and the UN city is having a good time to make more wind energy. Energy companies want to use special money help and right now in many places; wind is the least expensive way to make new electricity.\nEven though wind farms are better for nature than old energy sources, some people in the U.S., especially in the countryside, don't like them. A place called SD country has been hoping to make a lot of wind energy for a while, but the arguments about new wind farms have made people disagree and slowed things down.\nEven though wind turbines usually don't change the landscape much, some people think the turbines are not nice to look at, too noisy, and bother animals, and they don't think about the good things, like money for the state and local areas, that the project will bring.\nEven with some people not liking it, there has been recent happy news from the big bosses for wind projects in the sea, as the big bosses announced they are going ahead with making wind turbines off the coast of the big ocean. The Ocean Energy Office has already asked for ideas on which parts of the U.S. coast have the best chance for leasing by sea developers. Still, it has not always been easy for sea projects which have faced many problems in the past competing with their land friends.\nSome people don't like big windmills in the sea because they change how the sea looks, can hurt animals, and might make it hard to fish or visit the beach. But, if we can put these windmills far out in the sea, people might not worry about them as much.\n\nCompanies that want to make new windmills on land and in the sea in the US need to talk to people about why these windmills are good. This way, they can make people like the windmills and not waste time and money. Here are some ways to help people understand about the windmills:\n\nTalk to the people who can help\nIt's very important to include local groups in your plans. These groups are more than just the people who own the land. They can also be groups like business groups, neighborhood groups, and groups that help the community. The first step is to talk to these groups and tell them about the project.\n\nThese groups can help spread the word in many ways. They can use newsletters, emails, social media, and events. Local leaders like to see that the community is involved. It's important to get these groups to help because they can spread the word and get more people to support the project in a big way.\n\nCheck out the attached file\nIt talks about how to keep track of the weight on the bottom part of sea windmills using special measuring tools.\n A company that shares stories about power and energy is made by P&G.

{"text": "Two basketball teams are in the big game! Team V and Team M are the last two teams after many games. They will play for the biggest prize in college basketball. Who is better in each part of the game?\nBACKCOURT\nAdam, a player who has helped Team V win before, is really good. He's not just the best at his job -- he's the best player. He's smart and tough. He could help Team V win, especially if the game is very close at the end.\nAdam is not the only good player though: Don't forget about Patrick, who helped a lot in a big game two years ago. He scored lots of points in a short time.\nTeam M players Cameron and Matthew will need to do well in both playing and defending. But, being in big games before is important, and this is Team V's second time in the big game in three years. This will show the most in the back court.\nWho has the edge? Team V\nKEYS TO VICTORY: The things that will decide when Team V plays Team M\nLet's talk about two teams playing a game. Team M is playing really well right now, just like their tall player, Matthew. Matthew is very good at scoring points. His energy makes his friends on his team play better too.\n\nThen, there's team V. They have two players, Oliver and Ethan, who can also score many points. But Matthew from team M has so much energy and his friends on his team play better when he is playing. He is also the best at passing the ball to his friends on his team.\n\nIt's hard to say which team will do better, and the coaches of both teams know this. Team M's coach is well-liked and known for his good coaching. His team plays tough and they don't give up easily. There was a big game between two teams. One team was losing by 10 points, but their coach, let's call him Benjamin, didn't worry. He kept teaching his players to trust themselves. He knew their practice would pay off and they would do better.\n\nOn the other side, there was another coach, who we'll call William. William was a very successful coach. He had won a big game before. His team played a different style, without a really tall player in the middle, like some teams do. This style was working very well for them. William was calm and confident, especially since his team was doing so well.\n\nWilliam was just a little bit better as a coach. But don't forget, experience is very important. Several players on William's team had won a big game before. They were now older, smarter and stronger.\n\nThat's how they managed to win against a very tough team in the Sweet 16 round. They had also beaten two strong teams before, one was ranked number 3 (let's call them TT team) and another was ranked number 1 (let's call them KA team). The other team, let's call them the WO team, was going to be a challenge. But William's team was ready.\nIn a game, MI team made it hard for LO team to score points. But, the VI team, led by their coach, was the best team in scoring points. In big games, the teams that can score a lot of points usually win.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "55b1969eafd66f9c657fc9da2056c7478e0b6db4cd020e0b6c6c32dc1931ee40"}

{"text": "The game didn't go the way the team had hoped. They had a plan to score early, play defensively, and slow down the other team to win. This plan usually works but this time, they were on the receiving end. The other team's coach used the same plan and it worked perfectly. The other team may have played defensively, but we can't complain because we would have done the same if we had scored early. The other team played well - they defended, stayed strong, and were organized. They won and that's all that matters in a final game - they have the trophy and we don't. That's how it ended.\n\nWhy did it take our team so long to realize that this was a final game? A group of players began their last game very slowly. They only began to play better when they were losing. This happened often during the season. In the second half of the game, the team tried really hard and fought bravely to change the situation. Everyone was asking why they don't start playing well from the beginning. This has been happening the whole season. If they had played well from the start of the game, they might have done better. The team usually plays well only when they are losing. Even then, it feels like they are just trying to keep from losing instead of following a plan. \nSometimes this kind of play works, but not this time. They were playing against a very smart team led by a leader who likes to keep things simple. It was a game of two different halves for our team, which is what has been happening all season. A football game was happening. In the first half, the Blue team was playing better than the Red team. The Red team wasn't as fast or strong. But in the second half, the Red team started playing better. They were showing their skills and strength like they had in other games. But they had to catch up a lot because they didn't play as well in the first half. They made a mistake and didn't win the game.\n\nEven though the Red team didn't win, they played very well in the second half. They tried their best and almost made the game last longer. They had control of the game and if they had made it last longer, they might have won. But they missed some chances to score goals. One player's shot went wide instead of into the goal. Another player was too far ahead when he scored a goal, so it didn't count. They wondered if things would have been different if another player had been playing from the start. What would have happened if Patrick hadn't run into Ethan in the early part of the game? What if, what if, what if... that's how the final game and our season went. \n\nThe team is excited to welcome new female players. This year is a big one for our coach, Matthew. The team needs more leaders and wider skills. Our player, Adam, is at a crossroads in his career with the team. Our coach Matthew needs to make tough decisions. \n\nSamuel's game is not as good as before, and it's worrying. After the final game, the team needs to recover from their loss. The final score was 1-0, in favor of the other team. This is how we see Matthew's second season at the big field. \n\nBefore the big game, everyone was hoping Luke would be ready to play. The team was looking forward to the big game at WE stadium. There was one big task left in our big final game. \n\nThe last game ended with a score of 1-0, in our favor. The next game will be against the WA team. Our captain, Cameron, is ready for his last game with the team. Despite some disappointments, everyone believes Matthew is the right coach for the team. \n\nThe last game against WH team ended with no score. The team's performance has been inconsistent.

On a special day in 2011, Emma won a big award for being the best new singer. Then, on a day in 2012, a company shared Emma's newest collection of songs, called Radio Music Society. It was her best work yet, with 11 songs and short movies that showed what inspired Emma to make each song. These short movies were made in big cities like NE City, a place in the SP country, and a city in OR. People who buy Radio Music Society can also get these movies on their computer or on a special DVD. Radio Music Society is not a sequel, but a friend, to Emma's earlier song, which was very popular. \"First, I thought it would be fun to make two different types of music,\" she shares, \"One type is quiet and calm, like soft music we can hear in small rooms. The other type is like the fun songs we hear a lot. These are the two things that I really like, and it makes me curious to think about different ways to show them.

{"text": "In a far away land, there was a group of people who were in charge of making decisions for everyone. They were trying to choose their new leader. The person who was trying to be the leader was named Matthew. But he needed more people to support him. He could either get enough support on his own, or he could ask other people to help him. Matthew thought he might have just enough people to support him, but he also knew he might need to ask at least one other person to join his team. \n\nSome people thought that Matthew and his friends would rather ask everyone to choose a leader again instead of changing their plans to get more people to support them. If Matthew didn't have enough people to support him, he would need to ask others to help him. He might ask Alice and Rachel, who were not part of his team, to join him. \n\nAlice had a good idea. She wanted to make a new job for someone. This person would help make things easier for people who lived in places where the rules were different. This could be a good idea that Matthew and his friends would like. Alice had been telling Matthew and his friends about her idea for a long time.\nA lady, let's call her Isabel, had a great idea to help the people in her town, which we'll call AI town. She knew that some other towns, like TW town and CO town, might like her idea too. \n\nIsabel's idea was to have a special group that could help different places work together better. She thought this group could help sort out some problems that people who build houses have. These builders have to deal with lots of paperwork and rules, and it can be hard for them, especially if they're working in more than one place. \n\nIsabel thought it would be easier if they only had to follow one set of rules, no matter where they were working. She said this would also help people who drive trucks and sell drinks, who have the same kind of problem. \n\nIn another part of the country, let's call it SA state, another group of people had a big idea. They wanted to make a group to keep things fair and honest. But they decided not to make it a must-have thing. \n\nThey were also hoping to win a spot in another place, let's call it GR town. The person who was there before, we'll call him Ryan, was just a little bit ahead of the person they wanted to win, let's call her Alice. If Alice did win, it could mean that they'd have more say in big decisions.\nA team led by a man named Xavier is not happy with what a team led by Thomas has been doing in their big building where important decisions are made, since 2013. This means they don't agree on many things and making agreements could be very hard. \nSomeone who can help decide who gets to be the leader might want a special group to make sure everyone is playing fair. But Thomas's team doesn't like this idea. If there are any people in Thomas's team who like this idea, they are hiding very well. \nXavier's team also wants to make rules so we know what the leaders are doing with their special rights, and they want these rules to be clear and quick. They also think the system to help people who tell the truth about wrong things is not good enough. They want a law to protect these truth-tellers and pay them if they lose money because they told the truth.\nXavier's team also thinks that help from the big building should be given quickly, should work well, and they should tell people what they are doing. They also want to change how the big building works to make sure they are not doing the same work more than once. \nAdam, a member of another team, and Andrew will not join Thomas's team. Bob might join Thomas's team, but no one knows for sure what he will do.\nThere is a small chance that the blue team could work together with the green team and the NXT team to make a big rule about being fair. But, just like the red team, the blue team has always said they would not make deals with other teams to win. It would take a lot of changes to their rules to make this happen.\nMore people in the blue team like this idea than in the red team, even though both teams haven't said they will do it.\nBefore the big vote, the leader of the blue team, Bill, said he would keep looking into whether we need a big rule about being fair. This only started because the blue team said it was a good idea.\nWhen the big teams are not winning, they talk a lot about being fair, being responsible, and being open.

{"text": "\"A Story About Henry\" is not a fun story. It tried to be a good story about a family with a mom and her two boys, but it also tried to be a thrilling adventure, which didn't work very well.\n\nThe story starts with a book full of special drawings and gentle music. It feels like it's a story for children. In it, there's a boy named Henry who takes care of his little brother Peter. Henry is really good at helping Peter, who sometimes gets picked on. Henry sees himself as a big helper.\n\nHenry is really smart for his age. He is so smart, he even uses big words like \"existential\". Not only is he smart, but he also knows how to make money. He saved a lot of money for his mom, Susan, who works at a restaurant and likes to play exciting video games to relax.\nHenry cares a lot for his brother, mom, and a nice girl in school, we'll call her Charlotte. She lives next door and has a scary stepdad named Glenn. One night, Henry sees Glenn go into Charlotte's room from his window. We can tell from how Henry reacts that something not nice has happened to his friend, but we don't see it clearly.\nAt the same time, there are parts where Henry's mom talks with her friend, we'll call her Sophia. Sophia is the kind of person who likes to make jokes. She and Henry don't always get along, but it's all in good fun. Sophia also does a funny act with Henry's mom that makes us wonder what will happen next in the story.\nHenry does a great job in a role that could seem not real. Both the director and Henry's mom bravely handle some big changes in the story's mood. The story could be funny or serious, where a mom depends on her grown-up-like son for everything. Henry's mom finds a way to make it both, which leads her to some touching moments, like when she sings a song to her two boys before they go to bed.\nIn the middle of the story, \"The Big Book of Henry\" becomes a really emotional tale. The main characters show their feelings, and one character even gives Henry a friendly kiss. This seems like she's trying to connect with Henry in a way she knows how, which is both moving and a little strange. \n\nThen, the suspenseful part of the story comes back, and that's when the tale doesn't make as much sense. Henry's mom watches from the window and reacts to what's happening to another character, Christina, even though we can't see it. It might be a job for a grown-up who understands feelings to know why the story is about a mom who's told what to do by her young son. \n\n\"The Big Book of Henry\" becomes silly when a dance show from Christina is shown at the same time as Henry's mom trying to scare a mean man, and then things become very funny when a school leader suddenly knows something is wrong just because of how Christina's dancing looks.\nIt's a bit sad because there's a funny movie with interesting characters, but the story becomes too silly. \nThere's a movie story about 12 naughty men who were in jail. People gave them tools, put them in a flying machine, and asked them to stop the bad guys. This story has inspired many other movie stories:\nIn one movie, a group of troublemakers are asked by a mean leader to take tools from the good guys. This movie, along with others like it, showed a lot of fighting scenes.\nAnother funny war movie tells the story of a group who decided to leave their boss and take a lot of treasure from the bad guys. A movie company sold a pack of two movies on DVD. One of them is a sports film. In this movie, a football player named Ben (let's call him Ben) messes up and gets sent to jail for a year and a half. In jail, he is asked to put together a football team made up of other prisoners. They are supposed to play a friendly game against the guards' team. But, just like in the other movie in the pack, the prisoners use this chance to fight back against the guards.\n\nThere's also a movie from SK country. This film is similar to the first one and tells a story about a secret team. This team is made up of people who have done bad things and are in jail for life. They are given a task - if they can get rid of NK country's leader, they will be free. The SK government kept a lot of details a secret until the early 21st century, so the people who made the movie had to guess some parts of the story.\n\nLastly, there's another movie that people think is a lot like the first one. Both movies have teams that do things their own way. They fight against the bad guys in some pretty rough ways. Thomas had a great idea for a film. He thought it would be fun to show some bad people getting what they deserved in the end. This idea was a little like what happened in an old film.\nThere's another film that people think is a lot like the old one. This film has a group of older actors who play the part of heroes. They are asked by some important people to stop a bad man. This is a secret mission because the important people don't want anyone to know about it.\nThis old film has also given ideas to some of the superhero films we see today. For example, in the superhero film made by William, he shows us how the superheroes become friends more than showing them fight the villains. This is similar to the old film, because it also spends a lot of time showing how the team comes together.\nWith this in mind, it's not surprising that Jack also used ideas from the old film when he made his superhero film. In his film, the heroes spend more time becoming friends than fighting the villains. Gabriel really enjoys a famous drama. He often talks about how much he likes characters who might not always be good, but find goodness within themselves. Gabriel also likes stories where a group of people work together. He likes one story about a man named Cameron who uses his computer skills to help others, even though he made some mistakes in the past. Another story that Gabriel likes is about a group of special people who usually do bad things, but in this story, they do something good. There's even a story set in a faraway place among the stars, where a group of brave people do something very important. Gabriel thinks these kinds of stories can be told in many different ways.\nA big movie company is making a new film with a famous director. The movie is about a group of brave heroes who have a very important job. They need to go to a really bad place to stop a very bad man. Could they get a very special prize if they do this?\nAlso, remember when kids were the stars of big movies? That was really cool!\nFrom films about brave friends to movies about daring teams, important films from a long time ago have left their mark on the world of movies.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "f192370d034c900f0adf2c04faabb886ea80994c7304374936daf1c0b68eafcb"}

Adam said that David did well because he was young and healthy. If it had been someone older, they might not have done as well. \n\nDavid's body got very cold, almost like sitting in a hot tub. But he didn't feel much pain. Adam explained that when parts of your body get very, very cold, you can't feel them much. David even said that he can't feel his feet too well now.\nDavid was talking to Henry. Henry was explaining that when someone gets hurt, sometimes parts of them get better on their own. But sometimes, parts do not get better and stay like they are. If that happens, the doctors have to help by removing the parts that can't get better.\n\nDavid asked if giving medicine could stop someone from getting sick. Henry said that this is not always the case. In fact, sometimes giving medicine might make some germs stronger. So, they only give medicine when someone is already sick, to fight the specific germs making them sick.\n\nHenry explained that when someone gets really cold, it can cause problems. Their heart might not work properly and they have to be very careful when treating them. But once they are warm again, they usually don't have any long-term problems from being too cold.\n\nThen, they wanted to hear from Samuel, who is a skier. Samuel shared that he is tall and weighed about 175 before he had an accident. He had been missing since the last day of the year. There's a brave boy, who is big like your older brother or sister. He was found after spending four very cold nights in a big mountain range, which we can call the \"CE mountains\". We've been talking about his story.

It's a silly idea that doesn't make sense.\nBut, big companies who make bug sprays would like us to believe this.\nAnd now, some of the people in charge want us to believe this too.\nThis week, some big farming and bug spray companies in the big city were able to get the people in charge to include a change in an important plan that would let the group who checks bug sprays skip the most important parts of protecting special animals: The parts that require checking if a bug spray hurts special animals before it can be said okay, and the parts that say a bug spray can't kill special animals.\nThat's right: If this change stays, thinking about how bug sprays might hurt special animals would not be a part of the process of saying it's okay to use bug sprays.\nNot long after our leader and the head of the group who checks bug sprays took charge, they showed that they didn't care much about facts, people's health, and animals when they decided not to stop using a bug spray on crops, even though there's a lot of proof that this spray can hurt children's brains and is likely to hurt special animals.\nA bad thing was happening. A yucky thing called chlorpyrifos was hurting almost all of our country's special plants and animals. People who help keep our air, water, and land clean (we'll call them the \"clean team\") knew this. They wanted to stop using this yucky thing.\n\nBut then, a big company gave a lot of money to an important person's big party. Suddenly, the clean team stopped worrying about the yucky thing. Now, the big company and their friends seem to not worry if they make animals and plants disappear forever.\n\nThe big company has given a lot of money to people who make rules for the last six years. They also spent a lot more money to talk to these rule-makers.\n\nThis is a big problem. If we don't stop it, not only will many special plants and animals disappear, but it might also get rid of one of the best ways we have to protect everything, including us, from very bad things that can poison our water and land.\n\nA lady named Lori is the boss of a group that helps keep everything healthy.

She was very happy to talk about her journey to a life where she can wear comfy clothes, eat apples, and let her mind wander. \n\nWhen asked about leaving her old job, Jessica said she lost her very busy job. This happened when jobs were hard to find. She wasn't surprised when she lost her job, and she had been thinking about writing stories for a while. \n\nJessica had written a children's story and a scary story before.

So, I usually plan to have at least the first three storybooks ready quickly. After that, I switch between the groups and keep adding to all my ongoing groups of storybooks. It's been a fun trip seeing the groups grow. Both the IM Museum group and the TC group have seven storybooks each now, and the MF group is finished with five storybooks. I'm beginning a new group that's also part of the IM Museum group-- the SC Mysteries, and I already have the first five covers ready. It's very exciting to have several beautiful covers ready that just need the stories to go with them!\"\n\nAlice noted, \"The about-you part on your website talks a lot about being positive, like understanding other people and feeling part of a group. Why do you feel this way?\nJESSICA: Because I really like and believe in the big book, especially what it tells about a kind man.\nNobody knows us better than the one who made us, who sees us as we are, even with all our mistakes and hurt, but also as who he wants us to be.\nHe gave us a way to have peace, a real family, and hope -- things we all really want.\nSo it's a happy thing but also hard for me to try to show, through stories, how we might be able to see others the way the kind man does.\nBut, I don't write what could be called \"kind man stories\" because these things are too real to put in a group that's often thought of as silly or not serious.\nSo my mysteries are just that -- mysteries -- but I do like how stories let us hear what's in other people's hearts and learn about different ways of thinking in a way that we can understand and feel.\nIn a way, that lets us practice being kind in our minds before we do it in real life.\nSOPHIA: Where do you get ideas?\nJESSICA: Place! I'm very lucky to live in a really beautiful part of the US.\nI grew up in the PN area and didn't realize how special the mountains, the ocean, and the green valleys in between were until I was older and traveled and saw what great things we have here.\nEveryone should get the chance to enjoy good stories! Each series takes ideas from special places in the WA or OR area. These places have interesting history and culture that become part of the stories and characters. Thinking about these places helps us imagine what life is like for the people who live there.\n\nMany of the places in the stories are real. If they're changed a little, I usually tell you why at the end of each book. Visiting these places to learn more is one of the best parts of writing these stories.\n\nA couple from a faraway place told me that my books made them want to visit OR. I love hearing that from my readers. \n\nYou can learn more about the author and buy her books on her website.

{"text": "There's a group that makes rules for food that is okay for people of a certain faith to eat. They've made some new rules. This group wants everyone in certain countries to use the same rules. They also want to make sure people using these rules are safe and everything works well together. They want to help these countries do well in the world and come up with new ideas.\n\nThey've made these new rules after a lot of thinking and talking with other groups. The new rules are ready for everyone to use. There are three new rules. The first one is about what food is okay to eat. The second one is about who can say if food is okay to eat. The third one is about who can check if the people saying the food is okay to eat are doing a good job.\nA group of friends from different countries came together in 2008. They had a very important task - to make rules about what is good and safe for everyone. They worked hard and finished making the rules in 2011. Now, only one team can make these special rules. They make sure that everyone from different countries can help and agree with the rules. The rules are very special and everyone can trust them.\nThis team always works in the best way possible. They also make sure the rules are always up to date with what's happening now. They make it easy for everyone to understand the rules. They also keep changing the rules to make them better. These rules are very helpful for everyone who uses them.\nIf you want to know more about these rules, you can ask any of the team members. They will be happy to help you. New rules about making sure food is good and safe to eat are being made. When they are ready, you can use them too. Here is some information about 4 important rules:\n\n1. Rule 1: This rule talks about how to make sure food is good to eat. It gives information to people like you, companies that make food, and groups that check if the food is good. It talks about where the food comes from, how it's made, and how it's kept safe and clean. It also talks about how it's packed and labeled for the store.\n\n2. Rule 2: This rule talks about how to make sure the food comes from good sources. This includes animals and plants that are okay to eat.\n\n3. Rule 3: This rule talks about how the food is made. It includes things like how animals are treated, how food is made and served, and how it is kept safe and clean.\n\n4. Rule 4: This rule talks about how the food should be stored, displayed, served, and transported. It also talks about keeping the food clean and safe to eat.\n\nThese rules are based on the idea that food should be good and safe to eat. This idea is part of a bigger system that makes sure that the food we eat is made in a good and safe way. These rules are the same no matter where you live.\n\nRemember, food that is not safe to eat is not good food. So, it's important to make sure the food is safe and can be traced back to where it came from. This is part of the rule too.\nIn a special group, some friends made a set of rules. These rules help others know if something is okay to use based on their beliefs. These rules are very important and they use them in many places, even if those places are different.\n\nThis group made the rules using some very special laws. These laws are followed by many people who share the same beliefs, no matter where they live.\n\nWhen something like a toy or a game follows these rules, it gets a special mark. This mark lets everyone know that it's okay to use. It means the thing follows all the rules and the people who made it promise to keep it that way. This promise is very important because it follows their special laws.\nThis rule talks about the things needed for a group to say if something is halal or not. Halal means it is okay for people who follow the Islamic faith to use or eat. The group must do their job well, be fair, and everyone should agree with what they say. This rule helps everyone agree about what is halal, which is important for trading things around the world.\nThis rule takes ideas from other rules and aims to tell what a group needs to do to say if something is halal. It also gives the steps for how to use the halal certificate and mark.\nIn this rule, when we say \"Management system standard\" or \"Requirements\", we mean the \"halal standard or halal requirements\" and/or \"Management system standard\" or \"Requirements\".\nThis rule also talks about what a group needs to do to check if something is halal. There's a system that makes sure everyone follows the same rules about what's halal. This system is used all over the world. If someone does a good job following these rules, they can be part of a group. This group works together to make sure everybody only needs to show they're following the rules once. This way, they don't have to do it again and again.\n\nBut, before this can happen, the system needs to be set up properly. If someone wants to check if others are following the halal rules, they have to meet certain requirements.\n\nThere is a special rule book that tells us how to make sure cosmetics are halal. This rule book is based on Islamic rules and laws. These are rules that most people agree on, even though they might be a little different in different countries.\nPeople are starting to worry more about what is in the things they use to look pretty. They want to make sure everything is okay for them to use. This has made a lot of people want to use things that are good to use and also okay for people who follow the rules of their religion. This rule book helps to make sure these things are made right. It is not meant to replace any other rules about how to make things, keep things clean, or make sure things work right.\n\nThere are also other rules that the pretty things have to follow. These rules can change depending on where you are. \n\nAn airline in a big country started a special service to carry things that are good to use and follow the rules of religion. The business of making sure things follow the rules of religion is getting bigger and bigger.\n\nA big meeting was held in a holy city. Some important choices were made there. \n\nA group that helps manage the internet decided not to start using .good and .religion as part of internet addresses. Some governments were worried about this.\nJack, who works at a big food market, talks about special food items that many people like. This food is becoming popular in the SP country. Jack also talks about people who travel and the big food event in BA city.\n\nA famous shop in the BR country starts to sell its own special food. This food is checked and approved.\n\n\"People should be kind to animals,\" says a very old book.\n\nIn GE country, a new special food event will start in a future year in HA city. \n\nIn the OL games, a city is ready for athletes from different places.\n\nIn the BR country, the check and approve process for the special food should be the same everywhere.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "9504625e07424237e86b4b5688be71632b3f78b1b791f880134edb8696d9b31a"}
{"text": "There is a special liquid called hypobromous acid. In our bodies, this liquid helps make something called collagen, which is like the building blocks for our skin and other parts. There are tiny helpers in our bodies called EPO and MPO. They help defend our bodies from things that can make us sick. They use parts of hypobromous acid to do this. Sometimes, things can change because of luck. If you are using a computer that many people use, you might ask someone who knows a lot about computers to check if everything is working right. Adam and his friends did an important experiment. They found out that a special ingredient was needed to make a type of glue. This glue is like the one that holds our body parts together. This special ingredient changes its state during the process. The glue not only holds our body parts together, but it also helps our bodies to grow and stay strong.\n\nThey also found that this ingredient works fast when it changes a part of our body. This change happens faster than other similar processes. When this ingredient reacts with water, it forms a new substance. This new substance is like the ones we have seen before.\n\nRemember, this is like when you mix paint colors together to make a new color. Just like mixing blue and yellow to make green, here, the special ingredient and water mix to create something new. There's a special thing called Sulfilimine. It has a special bond between a sulphur and a nitrogen atom. When you add something called bromine to water, it makes two new things called hypobromous acid and hydrobromic acid. People have found out that bromine is very important in making something called basement membranes and helping things grow. \n\nHypobromous acid is very useful. It helps to make things white, kill germs, and get rid of bad smells. Basement membranes are very important too. They help in sending signals and supporting the cells that line our body parts.\n\nBromine is also found in animals as something called bromide. But we didn't know what it does until recently. There's a special type of cells in our body called eosinophils. They can make hypobromous acid from other things in the presence of something called plasma. A long time ago, people started making places to clean dirty water. There's a special kind of water with a name that starts with H and ends with Br, which is made when another kind of water gets changed. This special water is really strong and can change other things. \n\nAlso, there's a tiny thing in our bodies that starts with B. It's very important because it helps to build our bodies. There are parts in our bodies like skin and tissue that need it to grow properly.\n\nThere's also a very tiny worker in our bodies called an enzyme. This worker uses the special water to make connections in a part of our bodies. These connections are very important in building the parts of our bodies that are like the base of a house. In simple words, HOBr is not made as much as HOCl. HOBr is important because it helps to keep places like swimming pools clean by getting rid of germs. It does this in a similar way to how our bodies fight off germs. Even though it is not as strong as HOCl, HOBr can work faster when it comes into contact with certain things. It also interacts with our DNA and is made in our bodies by a special helper called an enzyme. HOBr is also found in all animals and helps to keep their bodies strong and healthy. It is really good at keeping water clean too. We can even see HOBr as a bright orange solid. Many people are interested in HOBr because it plays a big role in keeping us healthy. There was a person named Ryan who was trying to show he was not a robot, but a real person. He had to solve a tricky puzzle on the computer screen. This puzzle is called a CAPTCHA. When he solved it, he could use the computer again. Ryan was at home, making sure his computer was safe from bad software. \n\nRyan was also learning about something called an acid. This acid is made when something called a bromide is changed. It's a special kind of change called oxidation. He learned this from a big library on the internet.\n\nRyan found out that this acid reacts differently from another acid. He read about this from people named Xavier, Madison, and David. He was also reading about something that can make you feel scared and your heart beat fast. These are called Panic Attacks. \n\nRyan also learned about something called a probe. This probe could help to see the acid inside tiny parts of our body called cells. He read about this in a book about chemistry. \n\nFinally, Ryan learned about some other things that can be changed by the acid. He found this out from a study done by people named Samuel, Katherine, and Kevin. HOBr is not just strong, but it also has a special power. When you add something called bromine to water, it makes two new things called hydrobromic acid and hypobromous acid. It's like mixing two different colors of paint to make a new color. Some smart people in 2014 found out that if a tiny creature called a Drosophila fly doesn't have enough of this bromine stuff, it can't live. But if it gets enough, it can go back to being its normal, happy self. \n\nHOBr is also a part of something called hypobromous acid. This acid is not very strong and it can change easily. It's like when ice melts into water when it gets warm. Hypobromous acid has a special number called a pKa of 8.65 and can change a bit in water that is not too sour or too sweet. \n\nHypobromite solids, another type of substance, look yellow and smell very unique. It's like how different flowers have different colors and smells. These substances help protect and fix our body tissues in case they get hurt. \n\nNow, here's a fun question: Can you guess how many tiny particles called protons and neutrons are in the middle part of a super tiny thing with a weight of 68.926 amu? It's like guessing how many candies are in a jar! This is a story about two special things: Hypobromous water and Iron water. Hypobromous water has a special recipe, uses, and ways it interacts with things. Iron water also has a recipe, uses, and things to be careful about. \n\nOne day, a little boy named Isaac was curious about these two special waters. He asked, \"Which one is more important in the story of life?\" This made people think about the history of different species.\n\nIn a very special place called the Office of Data, people found the answers. They found that when you add a certain thing to water, it makes Hypobromous water and another kind of water. \n\nIsaac also found out about other things like special names for chemicals, flowers in a place called PA country, different types of surveys, parts of making and delivering things, printing on cloth in SI city, sofas, special pots with broken handles, places with lots of mountains and streams, and a special cooking method. \n\nIn BA country, people were observing a special month. There was a bird queen and a funny film that people loved to watch. There were also games, sentences without actions, food made of small potato pieces, peaceful steps, notes, places where oranges grow, cheese recipes, and many more things. \n\nOn a map, Isaac saw TL city, and he found different wallpapers for his phone. He also learned about splitting things, making dirty words, muscles, joints, supplements, worksheets, piercing the nose, comments on a book, reasons for studying, a tall girl named Charlotte, and a hand mixer. All these things made Isaac very happy and curious about the world.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "7d804d93ca0da6fb144590efea53986a800b7277aedbb7e1cc986d1f9aebfc45"}

{"text": "This story is about how a group of friends who are dentists clean teeth implants. They all work in different places. One friend works at a big school in a city called TE city, another friend works at a school in PA city, one friend works at a school in ME city, and the last one works in his own office in TE city. They all got together to share their ideas. They wrote everything down and lots of people have read it! They said if you want to ask them more about it, you can write to their friend at the big school in TE city.\nThis is a summary of what some people have found out about cleaning teeth implants without using surgery. They wanted to know how well different ways could clean the implants and help them work better.\n\nThey looked at a lot of information from 1966 to 2013. Some of this was from labs, some from animal tests, and some from people's experiences. They wanted to see how good these cleaning methods were at getting rid of bad things on the implants. They also wanted to see how these methods changed the way the implants worked and how healthy the mouth was.\n\nThey looked at 35 articles from 134 they found. They talk about the good and bad things about using lasers, and tools, and chemicals to clean the implants. It was hard to tell how good one method was because many of the tests used more than one method at the same time. Most of the tests with people were just watching a few people for a short time and didn't tell if the implants worked well or not in the long run.\n\nIt was hard to clean all the bad things off the implants with these methods. All the methods changed how the implants looked and felt. It might be hard or even impossible to get the bone to attach to the implant again without surgery to clean it really well. There were some good results from using more than one method at the same time to clean implants in people, but more tests are needed to see how good these methods really are.\nImportant words: Cleaning out, light beams, medicine given at one place, gum care without surgery, problems around tooth implants.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "0da4bbab3652e8791985637fd148e891fdedb37bdfba6c0fd573cf8107dbb7c6"}

{"text": "Our friend Jack wrote about a new computer that's great for people who don't want to spend a lot of money. If you're looking for a new computer to replace your old one, this one has lots of great things and works with the new Windows 8 system. \n\nThis computer has a strong Wi-Fi, a small size that fits anywhere, and many more features. It's always hard to find a good computer that doesn't cost too much money. But this one gives you lots for a small amount of money. \n\nIt has many things that used to be extras a few years ago, like great graphics, a big hard drive, a fast processor, lots of memory, and good Wi-Fi. The small size means it can fit anywhere, even on the desk where your old computer used to be. And, you can even connect it to your big TV if you want a full computer instead of just a TV box. This is a great choice for a small cost. It's our top pick for low-cost computers. \nThe computer is small and looks a bit like another computer called the Gateway DX4870-UR11P, but it's even tinier. It's about as big as a school ruler by a toy car by a small dog. It's thinner than most mini tower computers. Its black color and shape are fun to look at. Small computers like this one are liked by many people who want to spend less. They are as good as other computers like the Gateway One ZX4970G-UW308 and HP Pavilion 20-b010z, but these come with a screen. Small computers are good if you want to change the memory or hard drive because they use less costly parts. If you already have a screen from an old computer, you can use it with this small computer.\nThere's a little edge on the top of the computer where the power button is, and the button to open the DVD is on the front. There's a box that can play movies from a shiny disc. It also has spots where you can plug in different things like a small stick for storing pictures and songs, a microphone for talking, and headphones for listening. It would be easier if the spots for the newest kind of stick were on the front, not the back. The back has spots for more things like a cable for the internet, a spot for a bigger screen, and a spot for your TV. It also has spots for an old kind of mouse and keyboard, and it comes with a new mouse and keyboard that you can plug in. You might want to get a special mouse and keyboard that work better with the newest computer screens.\n\nThis box also has a part that lets it talk to the internet without any wires. It's a really good one because it has two antennas so it can talk to different kinds of internet boxes. This is great if your internet box is far away in your house. Inside the box, there's room for more parts that can make the box better, like a part for better pictures and a part for remembering more things. The box can remember a lot of things, and it already remembers quite a lot. There is a machine that can store lots of information and uses electricity to work. It's very quiet, even when it's working really hard. This is great for people who don't like loud noises. This machine has a lot of space to keep things, even when you first get it. But, it also comes with many extra programs. Some of these programs are helpful, like one for taking notes and one for video calls. Others are for buying things or reading books, but you might need to pay to use them. There are so many extra programs that it might seem like too much. If you don't already have a screen that you can touch, you might need to use your mouse a lot. The computer comes with a promise that it will work well for one year. \n\nEven though this computer is for beginners, it works pretty well. It can do many things at the same time, even if you like to keep lots of tabs open when you surf the web. The computer does a good job with everyday tasks like writing, surfing the web, playing music and videos, and fixing pictures. If you need to do more with media, you might want to think about getting a bigger computer.\n\nThis computer is a good choice for beginners. It's a great place to start if you're thinking about replacing an old computer. Let's say you are choosing a computer for your family, and you don't have a spare screen. You might want to think about a computer that has everything you need in one piece, like the GW One ZX4970G-UW308. But if you have a screen already, or you want to use your big TV screen, then the GW SX2380-UR318 might be a good choice. It's easy to use, has lots of useful features, and doesn't cost a lot of money. It's a great choice if you want to replace an old computer, or if you want a computer in your living room to use with your TV. The GW SX2380-UR318 is our top pick for low-cost computers. \n\nYou can compare the GW SX2380-UR318 with other computers, and you can also look at the scores from the tests we did on it. \n\nThere are also other computers you could think about, like the CY Trinity Xtreme, the LE ThinkCentre Edge 92z, the DE XPS 8700 Special Edition, the AZ Inspire Mini PC, and the HP Z2 Mini G4 Workstation. \n\nIf you want to know more, you can also check out our picks for the best small Windows computers, the best overall computers, the best computers for games, and the best low-cost computers for this year.\nThere are many different kinds of computers. Some are big and some are small. Some can stand alone, while others need to be connected to a bigger machine. There's one that even has a screen that can turn around! And there's another tiny one that costs less than many toys. One company even made a computer that's thinner than a book! And, there's a special fan made for a tiny computer to keep it cool. \n\nThere's a man named Jack who knows a lot about computers.

{"text": "A big clothing company and its main designer, let's call him Adam, might be parting ways. Some people have said that Adam is leaving the company. The company didn't say yes or no when asked about it. The company makes a lot of money, and a lot of it comes from the clothes that Adam designs.\n\nAdam has been working with the company since 2015. The company has been doing really well since then, but things slowed down when people got sick and couldn't go shopping. The company sells a lot of clothes in a big country, let's call it CH country, and this country was hit hard by the sickness. A big store was not doing very well this year, even though other big stores were doing great. The person who made all the clothes for the store had a special style. He liked to mix different styles together and make something new. People really liked his style and it made the store popular. But people are not as excited about his style anymore because it has been the same for a long time.\n\nA person who knows a lot about stores, Adam, thinks this is good. He thinks the store is not doing well because the person who makes the clothes has been doing the same thing for a long time and people are tired of it. He says that the people who bought a lot of clothes from the store, especially people from a far away place, are bored. Adam says the store needs to do something new and exciting. The faster they do this, the better.\n\nThe person who makes the clothes had a show about twins that was very successful. Some other people who know a lot about stores also think this is a good idea. \"The big clothing company had the same person making all the important decisions for seven years. Now, people think it might be good to have someone new to help the company do better. They think this could be a good change.\n\nA few months ago, the company added some new team members. There was Adam, who helps with the clothing business in a big Asian country. Then there was Maria, who is a very important manager for the company. Benjamin just became the person who talks to everyone about the company. And Robert got a new job taking care of the special treasure box and adventure projects for the company.\n\nThere's also a new job called the studio boss. This job was given to a very good designer at the company, but we don't know his name. His job is to help the design team and the person who makes all the artistic choices. This job might be very important soon, especially if the company gets a new designer. This is similar to what happened at another company, where Matthew became the new designer right after Daniel left a year ago. It reminds us of when a man who worked at the company since 2002 became the right-hand man of the previous designer, and then suddenly found himself in charge of all the styles.\"\nFashion brand names first-ever big boss\nAlice names Matthew as art boss in big plan\nHenry is new big soap company boss\nFancy clothes brand picks former glasses company chief Gabriel as new boss\nBig fashion group chooses Samuel as art boss of famous bag brand\nOnline clothes shop adds important money boss to team\nAlice, toy company founder, leaves boss role to focus on making things\nShoe shop shares news of fewer workers because of smaller Europe work, top boss leaves", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "c168c1e5d1be8c620043d023ebb75ccf805263d290a2a44b90ece8121cc38bbf"}
{"text": "Talking About Video Games\nMany friends who play video games have been talking a lot about game reviews lately. They use their phones and computers to share their thoughts about some game reviews that they think are not fair and honest. This is not a new issue, but it seems to be happening more often lately. Some believe that the people who write these reviews favor certain video games and their creators. This might be true, but it doesn't explain why others get upset about these reviews and the stories about them.\n\nIf you're going to write a game review, there are a few things you can do to show that you're not just trying to promote a game. One is to let everyone know if you really like a certain game. No one wants to be tricked into thinking a game is great. The next thing is to be honest when you talk about video games and their issues, even when you're saying good things. This is because some friends may think a game is not good if it gets a bad review. And if they think you're not being honest, then they might not trust what you have to say about video games anymore.\n\nAnother important thing to remember when writing a game review is to give examples. Some people make the mistake of only talking about one part of a game when they explain why they think it's good or bad. Talking about the important parts is good, but it's better to show how they all connect and what will happen next. This is why I think you should use examples, even when talking about \"important parts\" in a game. This helps your ideas stand out and makes it easier for others to understand because you used examples.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "7f04ae5f924c2ef81f8fdb692c7679177a26ffa48d297390304900c8cc8bbd0e"}

{"text": "After a certain treatment, a person needs to wear dark glasses until their eyes feel better. When they are ready to leave the hospital, the doctors will check their eyes one more time. Sometimes, after the treatment, the sound our body makes when we breathe can change. It can become softer or harder, or we might take longer to breathe out. Dr. Jones thought that the person did not get the right drink for their treatment. Sometimes, the tools that doctors use can be too big. All the stuff that comes out of our body, from healthy and sick people, should be covered with fresh dirt if it's not cleaned right away. We should be careful that our bladder and our special place for girls don't get between the ends of the bones when we're healing. At the end of the treatment, Dr. Stowe did something really good. He thinks that any of the men would be good at his job. The pictures drawn from real life are really good, and they look even better when they're colored. The medicine comes in small amounts and it's really good at making people feel better and cooling them down when they're too hot. I've tried many things that were suggested, like different kinds of acid, iron salts, glycerine, bark, and more, but none of them really helped. Now, I don't feel as good as I used to when I had my doctor with me. It's difficult to tell if someone has a sickness in their chest because it doesn't happen often, especially in grown-ups. This makes it easy to make mistakes when trying to figure out what's wrong: size. If you're a well-known doctor and you don't know about this yet, we can send you some samples. It's really important to take care of your feet and your head, and always keep your hair short. There was a doctor named David who was the best doctor in MA city for many years.\n\nHowever, the salt can make you really sick. The signs are throwing up, going to the bathroom a lot, feeling weak, and then passing away after thirty hours. Young animals that eat a lot usually get better quickly after getting sick with the foot-and-mouth disease. But it takes a lot longer for older animals to get better. The signs in sheep are a little different than the ones I just talked about. Their mouth doesn't hurt as much, but their feet always hurt a lot and very badly. David had a problem with his ear, and he went to the doctor seven times. Sometimes, people don't always do what they should to stay clean and healthy, like not cleaning their tools properly. This can cause problems. But sometimes, even when we do everything right, things can still go wrong. For example, things can get too big and fall down.\n\nSometimes, when people feel really sick, they can take medicine to feel better quickly. The doctor's office looks better than it used to, but that's the only thing that's better. The science room got too small because there were too many people, so they had to use other rooms too.\n\nThe people who study there can use all the things that the art students can use. They can even use the science rooms. A lady loves her husband very much, and listens to his ideas, even when they talk about things like treatments.\n\nTo figure out what to do next, they asked some workers what they thought. They decided that they would set up places where people could go to get medicine in different parts of the city and the areas around the city. These places would be run by the people who use them, with help from the doctors they choose.\n\nThey also talked about how sickness can spread and what that means for everyone's health. They will talk about this more later. After a little while, I felt a lot better, and my pee didn't have sugar in it anymore. There's a special circle between two parts of the heart.

{"text": "A girl named Lily was making paper with her own hands. She started by cutting and drying the bark of a tree. After that, she soaked it in water and cooked it slowly with ash. She carefully cleaned it, crushed it, and chopped it up. She mixed it all together with a big, stone bowl and stick, then spread the squishy mixture on a flat, floating rack. And just like that, she made paper! At the end, there's a surprise. Lily's channel has many other videos of things, mostly simple but hard-to-make food, being made from scratch.\n\nA man named William loved taking pictures of plants. On his lunch breaks, he would walk around and collect different plants. He used an old way of taking pictures to create black and white images of the plants. The pictures are very beautiful and a little bit spooky.\n\nThere are some watches with a famous mouse drawn on them. These watches were first made a long time ago in a shop in a big city. The mouse on the watch was often seen in different drawings, sometimes with another famous artist. Now, the watches have been made again. A mouse character was born from drawing a mouse. This picture was very popular. \n\nIn another place, a group of artists continued to make beautiful artwork. They made new paintings inspired by a story about a helper and a little one. There were different paintings like \"A Big Change\", \"Playing\", \"The Helper\" and \"The Big Animal\". \n\nThere is a smart light that works all by itself.

Is that true?\nBad computer tricks have been happening more and more for a while.\nAccording to a big important group in the UK, these bad computer tricks cause more problems than any other kind of computer attack, and they have for a while.\nSome people think bad computer tricks are happening less\nBut some new reports seem to say that, after many years of going up, the number of bad computer tricks is going down.\nA company, for example, always watches for these bad computer tricks as part of their job to keep the internet safe. According to their reports, the number of bad computer tricks almost went down by half between a winter month and a summer month in a year not too long ago.\nThey report that at the start of this time, 1 in many, many emails was a bad trick email. By the end, it was 1 in even more many, many emails.\nAre bad computer tricks still a problem?\nSo are these bad computer tricks really half as bad as they used to be?\nTo anyone who works to keep things safe, that idea seems silly. And they're right. Because the number of bad computer tricks, of course, doesn't tell us everything we need to know.\nBad people sometimes send tricky emails to trick others. This is called \"phishing\". The number of tricky emails can go up and down. But, even if there are fewer tricky emails, if there are more emails overall, there can still be more tricky emails.\nSo, are there more tricky emails now than before?\nA security company called \"Kevin's group\" keeps track of how many tricky emails they find.\nEvery few months, they count how many tricky emails they caught. This helps us know if there are more tricky emails now than before.\nAccording to \"Kevin's group\":\nIn one year, they caught a lot of tricky emails\nIn the next year, they caught even more tricky emails\nAnd, in just a few months of another year, they caught a very large number of tricky emails\nSo, it looks like there are more tricky emails now than before.\nBut, are there even more tricky emails than we think?\n\"Kevin's group\" counts tricky emails when they find bad internet addresses. But, tricky emails can also have other bad things in them, like bad business emails and bad software. If we count these too, there might be even more tricky emails than we thought. In 2018, some people noticed more tricky emails, even though others said there were fewer tricky emails. \nJust looking at numbers doesn't give the full picture. To really know about the problem of tricky emails, we have to think more. We have to look at why people do what they do. \n\nWe can learn more about this later...\nThere's a special tool that can help us with this. It uses smart computer stuff to see and improve how we understand and act with internet safety. \n\nThis smart tool takes lessons from lots of people who know about internet safety.

{"text": "SE country is a special place by the big water, south of a big city. It's very big, and it's divided into East SE and West SE. The biggest town there is called BR town. \nSE is famous for its big white cliffs, beach, and old stories that go all the way back to times when Romans lived there, and even earlier. It also has stories from not so long ago, when big boats left from here to fight in a big war. \nSE, near the water, is the place where the sun shines the most in the UK, because of how it's placed and the weather there. \nLots of people like to come to SE to see the beach. There are also big green hills called the SE Downs that people like to walk on. These hills go on for a very long way, and there's a path that goes all the way from one end to the other. \nYou might see people making TV shows or movies at the Blue Railway. This is a special train line where they use old steam trains. It was the first place where they started using these old trains again, for people to ride on, back in a time not so long ago. \nThere's a big park called the South Downs National Park and another place called High Weald, where people who love nature can go. There are also places where they make wine, old castles, gardens, places where battles happened, and the best views in BR town from a tall tower. People who travel a lot will find lots to see and do here.\nDo you want to do something different? How about a trip to a juice factory on an old big city bus? \n\nIn a place we'll call BR city, many people used to visit for a day out from the big city. When a train track was built in the 1800s, even more people came. Before the train, BR city was a great spot to go for a swim in the sea. \n\nThere's a big fancy house in BR city that many people like to visit. It has lots of beautiful decorations inside and was built to look like houses from a long time ago. Now, it's a place people visit to see its beauty.\n\nNot far from there, there's a big place where boats can park, called BR Marina. It's the biggest of its kind, with room for many boats. It's a pretty spot to look at, with places to eat and sleep nearby.\n\nThere's another place called BX town, where there's a very old and special building that people go to see art and learn about buildings.\n\nThere's also a place called RY town. This town is very old and sits where three rivers meet. It's known for its stories about people who used to hide things there a long time ago.\n\nFinally, there's a very small town called BA town. This is where a big fight happened a long time ago. A man named William won this fight, and after that, he became the ruler. Now, people call him 'William the Winner'. A big building called BA was made to remember a big fight. It was finished in 1095, many years after the fight happened. \nIn a place called CH city, there is a big party every summer. Artists, writers and performers from near and far come to this party.\nCH city has some of the oldest houses and churches. The CH Cross was built in 1501 and stands at the crossroads in the city centre. There is a place called WE beach where people who like to sail, surf and windsurf go. It's not far from CH city.\nAre you looking for a holiday house in SU? There are holiday houses in BR city and CH city that people like a lot.\nThere is a place by the sea in SU country.\nThere is also a place called UW.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "79151d16e9280c3b3882b7911ba69e074ab06835eae883e33fae236298f8b0ac"}
{"text": "Let's talk about a helpful book. The book is written by a lady named Diana. Diana is like a teacher, but she helps families. She has been doing this for a long time, so she knows a lot. \n\nIn the book, Diana talks about a problem some people have. She explains it in a way that is easy to understand. The book is divided into 20 parts. In the first part, Diana talks about the problem and why people think different things about it.\n\nIn the other parts, Diana talks about what the problem looks like, how to tell if you have it, and how to stop needing it. She also tells you how to understand, appreciate, and make yourself stronger so you don't have this problem.\n\nThe first part of the book is very important. This is where Diana explains the problem in a way that is easy to understand. This helps people feel better about the problem and want to solve it. In the second part of our story, Charlotte says, \"Doctors like to name illnesses because it helps them understand and treat them. But I don't like these names because they make us forget how unique each person is and can make people feel sad.\" She also talks about the good parts of these names.\nSome may think this idea is not deep or important, but I don't agree. Charlotte knows a lot about her topic and really understands how it affects people. This helps her talk about it in a kind and honest way that other helper books don't do.\nSometimes, helper books just repeat ideas from other books or say things that sound nice but don't mean much. But this isn't true for Charlotte's book. She writes in a way that makes her words stick with you.\nYes, it's true that Charlotte is talking about a special topic, which means she can't be simple. But she still needs to bring something new and interesting to the topic. And she does.\nI like the Easy Learning books because they cover a lot of topics. There are books that help you understand and solve problems about different topics. In this case, a writer named Liam shares information about a problem called \"codependency\". He tells you how to know if you have this problem, and gives you advice and ways to get better. \n\nThis problem, codependency, has a lot of help in the book. For example, in Chapter 9, Liam talks about the good things that come from being quiet, writing in a journal, picturing things in your mind, and doing things differently. He says:\n\nTry doing things in a new way. If you usually argue, try to be quiet. If you're always quiet, try to speak up. If you're always serious, try to tell a joke. This might surprise people who know you and even you yourself... Doing things differently can also mean using a different part of your brain. Instead of worrying too much, try to take a step towards solving the problem, even if it's just finding out more information. When you're worrying too much about a person, try to focus on your feelings to let out emotions... If you feel like you need to do something, wait. Ask yourself what would happen if you waited another day.\n\nThis idea of changing how you act is really important to help with any problem, especially codependency. The first step is to understand it. With this book, you'll be able to do both.\nA person named David wrote a book about needing others too much. This book is helpful to many people. You can learn more about the book or even buy it if you want to. The book was last checked by a team of experts a while ago. The information about the book comes from a well-known website.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "93612435409f4347e4e9d7407bad11068737bbb30c3a4acff7d62cf23532dac4"}

This race happens every year and this year is the 34th time. Lots of people will run in this race and even more people will watch. The race is very long and goes through the city and a nearby place. The runners come from all over the world to try to win, to run their fastest time, or just to finish the race.\nMany people are talking about the runners from a faraway place. They are very good runners and one of them has won the race before. But one runner has decided not to run this year.\nThere is one man who has not been talked about much. He might surprise everyone and be the first person from his country to win the Big City Run. Adam from Team US became good friends with some athletes from NI country at a big race in PI mountain (US country) last year. Now, Adam will run his first long race in BE city. This is Adam's first time running in a race outside of US country. He said, \"I couldn't say no to the chance to represent US and visit such a lovely and old place.\"\n\nAdam's best time for a shorter race is 1:03:26, and his recent time of 1:05:36 in TE state was part of his nine-month training for his first long race. Adam is a simple and friendly runner who has no specific time goal for this race. Instead, he wants to test his skills against other top runners. Adam said, \"Since this is my first long race, I want to keep things easy and not expect too much. My goal is to do my best against the other top runners. I would be very happy to win the race, and I think if I finish in the top three, I won't have to worry about the time.\"\n\nEven though Adam hasn't run a long race before, he has been training hard for it with his fellow runner, Jack, under the guidance of their coach, Matthew. So, there's no doubt that Adam is ready for the race. Adam shared with us, \"I have run a lot, even longer than the length of 20 soccer fields. I have practiced running long distances and also participated in several long races to become stronger.\"\nAdam (shown in a picture) will have to use his strong running skills, that once helped him to finish third in a tough hill race, and his fast speed, to run faster than the other racers from KE country.\nAs mentioned earlier, Frank has pulled out of the race because he is feeling tired and hasn't been performing well. However, Jack, who won a race in the past, will participate. Among all the racers, Jack has the fastest record, which he set a few years ago. His most recent race was a good run at a big race this year. Liam achieved his fastest time at the BE city race a few years ago, which made him finish third, while runners from CT place, Gabriel and Victor have their best times of running the length of 26.2 soccer fields respectively.\nIn a big race, our attention is on the very skilled runner, Ethan. Even though he will run against some of the best in the world, 32-year-old Ethan is not worried. Instead, he is focusing on running his best race. His fastest time so far is 2:24:52. He wants to do as well as Thomas did two years ago, when he finished in fourth place. Ethan has said that he likes the race path in the BE city, where he works and trains. He added that having his friends run with him and having people cheer for him always helps. With so many good runners, the fastest time ever for this race, 2:13:41, might be beaten. This record was set by Ulysses from ET country 3 years ago.\n\nKevin was supposed to run in the LO city marathon last week, but he couldn't. So now, he wants to do well in his home city, especially since he did so well in the half marathon before. Benjamin, another local runner, is also expected to be among the top ten runners if he runs as well as he did in the LA city half marathon in March of a past year. Adam, Thomas, and Samuel might be there too. Benjamin, who has run a lot of marathons, will do his best, as will Frank, Phelim, Barry, Michael, and Simon. David, Garry, Paul, and Kevin all have the ability to finish the race in less than three hours.\n\nIn the girls' race, Bella from ET country looks promising. Bella is known for her track races, but she won her first marathon in IN city. This will be her first marathon in UK country, and she hopes to win and beat her previous best time.\n\nCharlotte, who came second here in 2014, has a similar best time to Bella, but she set it many years ago. Since then, she's run 5 miles in 31 minutes, 13.1 miles in 1 hour 26 minutes, and 20 miles in 2 hours 16 minutes, which suggests she might finish the race in just over 2 hours 50 minutes.\nA girl named Sophia, who is new to her running team, won a big race last year. Her amazing time means she could be one of the winners again. Sophia also did great in two other races. Another runner, named Selina, who came from a faraway country and lives in NI Country, has also won a lot of races. Her best win was a race where she ran really fast. Selina also came second in another big race last year. \n\nSharon, another runner from NI Country, is also one to watch. Earlier last year, she ran her fastest race ever. A local girl, named Grace, is also expected to do well. She hopes to do even better than she did last year when she came in fourth place. In a big race, some very fast runners like Rachel, Alice, and Grace from the FR team are going to run a very long distance. They might even finish in the top ten! Other runners like Anne, Claire, Sharon, Natalie, Cameron, Henry, Gillian, and Paula from NE team are also going to do their best. \n\nThere are also some other things to learn about running. Like how to start a race really fast, and how to keep going even when you're tired. And did you know that running can sometimes make your feet hurt? But don't worry, there are ways to help your feet feel better. And remember, running should always be fun!\nRunning Safely When It's Dark\nThis is about all the things runners should know about when they might get hurt. There's a group that wants to share good information about running in a place called NI country. They talk about running clubs, races, and results. They also talk about different types of running like road running, running in the countryside, and very long runs. If you have a story about running, you can share it with them! \n\nThey also talk about how to take care of your body when you're a runner, and about special running events. Remember, when you run, it's important to be safe and take care of your body.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "88cc0dea2aa57b3dbb1497e4f835321acee6c025e0a562d484ee5ecab96ed819"}

{"text": "A new kind of dance is becoming popular. This dance is done to a special type of music called two-step or UK Garage. Even if you haven't heard of it, you might find it playing at a nearby dance place. \n\nThis two-step music isn't like the country music you might know. It has a strong, different beat and often features parts of famous songs. \"It has a lot of feeling,\" says a man from AN city who goes by DJ when he plays two-step. \"It's the special rhythm that makes you want to dance.\"\n\nThis music from the UK country works on two beats. After the two beats, there's a pause or a change, which is different from the usual four beats.\n\nWhen DJ (who has been playing two-step for some time) and his friend DJ played this music at a dance place in NW city a while ago, a group of dedicated dancers showed up. \n\nMost of the dancers were young adults wearing comfy shoes, tight tops and jeans. Some of them danced in a quick, jerky way, like puppet dolls or quick-moving mimes, while others danced smoothly and slowly.\nSometimes, the fun music would slow down and all the people would stop dancing. But then, the music would start again really quickly. This music was a mix of different types like hip-hop, reggae, and salsa. \n\"Victor\", a 21-year-old, says he likes this music because it's different. \"There aren't many rules. You can dance any way you want,\" he says. \nVictor and his friend, \"Samuel\", 24, talk about a type of music called Jungle. They say you won't hear this new music on the radio. \"If everyone starts listening to it, I'll find something new,\" says Samuel. \nEven though many people like this new music, it's not as popular as Jungle. But it's been around since a long time ago.\n\"Jack\", who works at a music company, says that more people are starting to like this new music. \"I think more people will start liking it, even people who go to dance parties and people who listen to popular music,\" Jack says. He also talks about a video on TV that has this new type of music in it. People who enjoy a certain song might discover a new type of music without even knowing it. A singer from the UK named David uses a style called two-step in his new music collection. There are also other singers like Adam and Cameron, whose music can be found in stores and on the internet. Henry also has a collection of his own music.\n\nPlaces where you can hear two-step music include the TH club and the BU club in the DI city, and the BA city's SO club and SH club. Here, a local music player named Nathan plays every Saturday night.\n\nSome popular singers, like 'N Sync, have used the two-step sound in some of their songs. Some people believe that 'N Sync has wrongly taken credit for bringing this sound to the US.\n\nKevin said that he brought UK Garage to the US, but that's not true. This type of music has been around since the late 20th century, says Thomas.\n\nHenry says that when he started playing two-step music in the late 20th century, hardly anyone came to listen.\n\n\"If I was even asked to play,\" he says, \"people would just sit there.\"\n\nBut Henry, who also works as a computer helper during the day, has seen a big change, especially in the last year. Now, he not only gets asked to play music in the DI city and BA area, but he also plays at big music parties like ZF in the MI city. This is a yearly music party with lots of singers and lots of fans.\nNot many kids knew about the two-step dance last year ... Now it's everywhere,\" he says. \nWhy do more kids like it now?\n\"It's the kind of song you can sit and enjoy a juice to and not dance,\" Mr. Henry says. \"Or you can dance for a long time.\"", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "7d2cd0ef0cbfb4f76a4d63ec5b605726ae7c9d8ff523bdc01f5fe482f17b48d4"}

{"text": "This is a story about a man named Ethan. Ethan was thinking about something very important. He noticed that when people got really sick, sometimes their best friends couldn't come and see them. This often happened when the friends were both boys or both girls. Ethan didn't think this was right.\n\nImagine if you had a best friend, and you both cared about each other a lot. Imagine if you had been best friends for 20 whole years. Then one day, your friend got very sick. Wouldn't you want to go and see them? Wouldn't you want to be there for them? Ethan thought everyone would say yes.\n\nBut Ethan knew that some people didn't think the same way. These people didn't think boys should be best friends with boys, or girls with girls. They didn't want these friends to visit each other when they were sick. Ethan thought this wasn't nice. He thought everyone should be kind to each other, no matter what.\n\nEthan thought, \"Even if I didn't like someone, I would still help them if they needed it. If they were sick, I would call for help. Even if their best friend was someone I didn't like, I wouldn't stop them from visiting. Because that's what good people do.\" People should be nice to each other, not because they are friends, but because it's the right thing to do. This is what makes us different from wild animals. \n\nIn a story about a hospital in a place called 'FL country', there were people who did everything correctly. They had all their important papers ready. But the hospital said only the doctors and nurses could decide who could visit the patient. This doesn't seem fair. Would having one more person in the room make things harder for the doctors? \n\nThe patient was alone and not fully awake for about half a day. If letting a family member visit is a problem, why don't we hear about this happening to other families? \n\nIn conclusion, this rule doesn't make sense and doesn't help anyone. Let's not talk about differences between people for a moment. If the doctors are not with the patient, what's wrong with having a visitor? It could be a family member, a friend, or even a stranger. Making rules about who is 'real' family can cause problems. What happens if a kid lives with his aunt and uncle instead of his parents? Do they have the same rights as real parents? What if a grown-up has no family but has a lot of friends who help her when she is very sick? Do we tell her, \"Sorry, you can't have visitors because you don't have family\"? It seems the rules don't know how to answer these questions. But the rules do know they don't like some people.\n\nIn times of fighting, people try to harm each other all day but still give food to those they capture, help those who are hurt, and bury each other's friends. It shouldn't be too much to ask people, even those who don't like each other, to follow some very simple rules. I'm not often surprised by people who don't like others because of who they love, but I would be really shocked if they were happy about the idea of keeping people who love each other apart, especially when someone is very sick.\n\nThere are things that shouldn't happen, but they probably happen more than we know. There have probably been many couples who were not allowed to see each other, especially in times when people weren't as accepting. This likely happened a lot in our country.\nKevin says:\nSometimes, people don't want to listen to others. They have learned not to like certain things from others around them.\nAnd it's not just about people who don't like others because of who they love. A lot of what we do comes from feeling upset or frustrated, and it doesn't help anyone. It just makes everyone more upset. Hospitals can be hard places to be in - have you ever seen a movie where a bad guy uses the hospital in a wrong way? Sometimes, people are too busy to be nice to others. It would be great if we were all nice and caring to each other, but that's hard for a lot of us. I can't make anyone else nicer, all I can do is try to be nicer myself and hope others do the same.\nOn behalf of my friends, thanks for being a good friend.\nMadison says:\nThis is a good thing to talk about. I work with rules for people who love the same gender here in OH state. It's not always easy. The stories that families have shared with me are very sad. Some people have had to be alone when their partners passed away because of old visitation rules. They not only have to be sad, but they also have to deal with things not being fair.\nSome people find ways to dislike others. It's right for everyone to show respect, especially when someone is not feeling well or is going through a hard time. But some people don't understand how important love is, or how important it is to be kind to others when they're not feeling well.\n\nI feel very sad about this. Why do some people choose to be unkind? It's like they don't understand the golden rule, \"treat others the way you want to be treated\". But some people just choose to be unkind. It makes me very sad. And I work with older kids!! So I'm used to feeling this way!!!\n\nSamuel says:\n\nFor some people, what they believe guides how they act. This can be a problem when what they believe doesn't allow them to be kind to others, or to understand that everyone has to do what's best for them. And this can cause problems.\n\nDavid talks about this, and he says that some people don't want to deal with hard questions about being fair to everyone. David thinks that people should either agree with him about being fair to everyone, or they should work hard to make sure everyone is treated fairly. A person warns that a problem might occur if a group doesn't bravely speak up against the big crowd's ideas. \nSamuel explains:\nThis is why the idea of two people of the same gender getting married is important. Regardless of people's opinions, marriage gives these couples a shield they need against unkindness. Pretending otherwise is not just wrong, it's risky.\nJack adds:\nWhen I read this, I recall a story about people who are so unkind that they don't let others rest in the same place after they pass away because of their skin color. Once you understand that people can be that mean, you see that all other kinds of unkindness, especially ones that are still sadly considered normal, can and will be taken to such harsh levels. Some people are, in their own sad way, appreciated for at least being honest about their wrong ideas- they believe people who love the same gender are bad-while the majority of people can't admit that they feel the same. Or to put it differently: most people didn't pay attention to a mean person until he started protesting at the funerals of people who love the opposite gender.\nAdam says:\nI have two small points.\nFirst - Good to see your mistake in the second paragraph fixed in the fourth paragraph.\nSecond - There's a big difference between some people and hyenas.\nThis is why it's funny to see some people get upset about a man named Wright. They hear him criticizing AM city for its mistakes, and they get upset. They think he doesn't like AM city!\nBut really? He's just saying AM city should be better to his people, and others. Even now, being mean to others is still a problem in AM city.\n\nOliver says:\nAs someone who is different, this might sound odd, but I understand why some people are against different people getting married. I don't agree with them, but I understand: for them, marriage has a traditional meaning from a big old book, and that's it, no more talking.\nBut the question about whether different people can visit each other really shows who some people really are. If you don't want two people who care about each other to even be in the same room, then you can't claim to be good.\nThere's something I've noticed and I want to talk about. I don't have facts and numbers, just stories and experiences. I've met a lot of young people who believe in saving money and being careful with it. But when it comes to how they feel about people who love differently than they do, they simply shrug and say, \"So what?\"\n\nIn other words, people who love differently have already made a big step forward in being accepted. They're fighting hard and winning. What will happen when the older people, who don't like change, are gone? Then, accepting people who love differently will be normal. Everyone, even those who usually don't like change, will support or at least not oppose this.\n\nAdam says:\nWe need to stop being mean to animals. They didn't cause any of this.\n\nI think the rules about who can visit people in the hospital are old and silly. If someone isn't sick and doesn't need to be alone, then they should be able to be visited by anyone. This includes children, people who love differently, religious leaders, doctors, money managers, insurance people, news people, sports teams, family, friends, pet caretakers, and even best friends. Some people don't like others who are different from them. They use their power to be mean to others. This is not nice. \n\nNow, let's talk about something a bit tricky. Some people believe that a certain book tells them how things should be. They think that it says that only a boy and a girl can get married. But, if we look at the stories in that book, we see many different types of marriages. For example, one king had many wives. And, another important person married a woman who was different from him. \n\nSome people use the rules in this book to be mean to others. They forget that the book also tells them to be kind to everyone. \n\nThe book says that some things are wrong. Because of this, some people don't believe that two boys or two girls can get married. They think that marriage is only for one boy and one girl. \n\nBut, even in the book, not everyone is perfect. People make mistakes. The important thing is to learn from our mistakes and try to be better. That's what being kind means. Everyone makes mistakes. But, there was one person, a very good person, who never made a mistake. He helps us when we make mistakes, as long as we say sorry and believe in him.\n\nI think laws should be made so that every person, no matter who they like, is treated nicely. This is very important in places like hospitals. It's okay to not like what someone does, but still care about them. Some people might not like what I'm saying. I just want you to know, I understand and feel what you feel, but I don't agree with how to change it.\n\nJack, I completely agree with your choice to not marry a man.\n\nAdam says:\nJack, do you think that US rules are not, were never, and should not be based on the Bible? It's okay to not agree with something because of what you believe, but rules should be decided based on the constitution or other important papers (for other countries), not the Bible or any other religious book.\n\nAdam, I think rules should be made based on what the people and the constitution say. What other countries do is their business, we don't have to follow their rules except when we agree to do so. Also, the people who first wrote our constitution said that religion was important in making our laws. So, I would argue that if most people want laws from the Bible to be more important than laws made by people, that's okay.\nA person from LB city says:\nGreat story with lots of facts. You make me think a lot. You wrote a good story, and it makes me think more. I will need to think about it more.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "2647bd0dd3d3d0c6463b3215eb09a847dafc0b529b9d95c6bb6ff73f849c9b6b"}
{"text": "Fairy Flight\nA Story for a Special Green Day\nby X. K.\nIn a place called TI county, not a single fairy\nWasn't upset seeing big planes\nFly out of SH airport like a fast rocket.\nSo, catching a big bug in tiny nets,\nWith a little push and shove, they quickly took their places in NO-SMOKING\nBetween the bug's wings.\n\"Hold on!\" shouted the pilot. \"Close the bathroom door!\"--\nAnd the little flight down a path of tiny lights started,\nLifted its head, bounced a bit, jumped into clouds fluffy and white\nWhere in a flower cup, Steward H. served some dew.\nSaid a curved rainbow, \"Wow, look at that plane go!\"\nThe flight was smooth until a naughty wind came.\nLittle B. O. shouted loudly--\n\"Oh no, we're going to land in a big green sea!\"\nMeanwhile, back at the control room (which was a pretty flower)\nThey said, \"Some old bird must have eaten Flight Nine.\"\nBut they weren't in big trouble. Co-pilot C.\nTold them to get off the bug's back with quick taps of her shoes\nAnd like thread from a plant, as smooth as a song\nA group of friends had wings and guess what, they could also float down like leaves! When the wind changed direction, they slowly drifted down to a beautiful field filled with shiny dew and yellow flowers. If there was a prize for the best landing, it would definitely go to this fairy-like flight.\n\nThis story was written by a man named Xavier. Xavier grew up in a town in NE city, which was near places where they made loud, explosive things. Sometimes, these places would make such big booms that all the windows in Xavier's school would break! Xavier's real name was actually 'Adam', but he added some letters before it to make it sound different. \n\nXavier had done many things in his life. He had been a sailor, cleaned printing machines, taught college students, and for the past 35 years, he had only been a writer. Xavier had written more than twenty books for children, the latest one being about city kids. He had also written eight poetry books and some schoolbooks. One of them was about learning poetry and he had written it with a poet named Dana.\n\nMany people liked Xavier's writing. The children of a school in NE city gave him a prize for writing the best imaginary story. He also got a prize for his poems for children from a group of English teachers. A group of artists and writers gave him a prize for his fun poems. Some poets gave him a prize because they liked his poems the best. And he even got a gold medal for all his writing work from a group of people who love poetry. David and his wife, Diana, made two special books about poems for children. These books have been around for a very long time. David and Diana have six grandkids and live in a town where something very important happened a long time ago.

{"text": "In a book, we learn about doctors and health. There are many things to learn about like public health, politics, and laws about health. The book is written by two people, Madison and Samuel. They talk about how a lot of money was spent on teaching new doctors in a year. \n\nThere is also another part in the book written by Matthew. He talks about how learning to be a doctor can be complicated. He says this because there are so many things to learn. \n\nThe book also talks about how many doctors there might be in the future and how much money they might make.\nIn a big book, Matthew, David, and Dale wrote some important things. They said that in a ten-year period, there would be about half more doctors in the US. They also said that for every 100,000 people, there would be about one-third more doctors. They found that there would be a lot more doctors who help with operations.\n\nIn another part of the book, Jerry wrote about how nurses who help with sleep medicine had some problems with doctors who also do sleep medicine. He said that the nurses didn't get a lot of help from the courts. He also said that new doctors are starting to not want to do sleep medicine.\n\nRichard also wrote in the book. He talked about how schools for doctors might change in the future. He also mentioned how people who pay for care from these schools feel about the doctors who graduate from them.\nThere were some people long ago who wanted to control who could become a dentist. From 1870-1900, some places made it easier for people who finished dental school to get a license. This seemed like a good idea because there weren't many dental schools. But, some people saw a chance to make money from this...\n\nAlso, some people are worried about who gets to make decisions about health care in our country. They think that the people who have caused problems are getting more power...\n\nNext, some people studied how decisions about AIDS were made from 1987-1992. They spent a lot of time trying to understand how people thought about AIDS...\n\nLastly, some folks have been talking about different ways to solve problems. They've been discussing whether we should use markets or if the public should provide things.\nA man named Ethan wrote about how people who know a lot about money can help make health services better. He talked about how to share costs based on how much money people make. He explained how they think and analyze things. \n\nIn another study, Victoria, Stephen, and William looked at how fewer students in medical school might affect the number of doctors in the TX state. They looked at where these doctors studied, what kind of doctors they became, and where they worked.\n\nIn a different study, Alice, Kelly, Denisse, Britt, and Jessica talked about women who sometimes don't get the health care they need. They said that when women's lives change, like when they have a baby or move, they should still be able to have health insurance. They talked about how to make it easier for these women to get and keep insurance.\n\nFinally, David and Amalia looked at who supports giving more people health insurance in the ME state. They learned from a vote that happened in 2017.\nIn a study about hospitals and rules, it was found that places with more people who have high-level school degrees tend to support a health program called Medicaid more. On the other hand, places with more people who have mid-level school degrees usually don't support it. \n\nThe cost of teaching students in the year when your parents might have been kids has been calculated. It was compared with the cost of teaching in a new suggested way to get the same number of students finishing school. The numbers about how many students finish school come from one place, and the cost numbers come from another place, which gives lower costs.\n\nIn a plan suggested by a group of nurses from a place called NE city, it was said that students who finish mid-level school programs would qualify to be a kind of nurse. Hospital-based programs and other types of nurse programs would no longer be important for being a nurse. They planned to start this in the future.\n\nIn another study, a man named David from HU university talked about how hospitals behave and what it means for rules. He is a teacher at the HU university's health school. He is in charge of a program for students who want to study health policy and management, and he teaches in both the student program...\nWho thinks about each person? \nA person named Ralph has been leading a study program about how people think for more than fifteen years. He's spent a lot of time learning and teaching about how people's minds work. He used to work at a big school in NE city for over twenty-five years. There, he helped people learn new things. \n\nNow, he works with others who are learning about how to help people stay healthy. One lady he works with is studying how different groups of people help make new medicines. Another man he works with is interested in where doctors choose to work. There's also a lady who used to teach at a big school in CA city, and now she's learning more about how to help people stay healthy too.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "861e1779a782313cd1c133e952e0b2648e1c37bf12cea8ddc49e96fc45210ee7"}
{"text": "Let's talk about a friend named Madison. Madison is a great helper! She likes to help at a big place in her town. This place has a lot of helpers, more than 1,000 every year! They spend a lot of time helping others. \n\nSometimes, Madison helps by giving food to people who need it. Sometimes, she helps make summer fun for families. All the helpers at this place make their town a better place.\n\nDuring a special week to thank helpers, we talked with Madison. She loves helping in a place where kids play and learn. We asked her why she likes to be a helper.\n\nMadison said, \"Helping others is like a gift you get from the world. I really believe that. I started helping when I was young. Every time I help, it makes me happy and I want to do it more.\"\n\nWe asked Madison what she likes about helping at this place. \n\n\"I started helping here because they needed helpers for the kids. I had been spending time with two kids who moved away. I missed playing with kids and wanted to do that again. Then I saw a message that they needed helpers for the kids. I talked to the person in charge and started helping. While I was waiting to start, I also helped in the food place and with other things.\" They told us at the beginning, \"You can't make the whole world better, but you can make a day brighter for someone.\" This became my aim.\n\nWhat's the best part about helping at the BC place?\nThe best part for me is when I enter the playroom every FR morning and get a hug from one or even many more children. What's better than that?\n\nWhat makes BC place a special place to help?\nFor a year now, I've been helping at the BC place and have gotten to know some of the people who work there. They're wonderful. Everyone I meet does more than they should. It's not just work for them, it's their life. They care and they give. They make helping there a joy.\n\nWhat do you like to do when you're not helping?\nWhen I'm not at the BC place, I like to ski down hills, garden, cook, and of course, learn new things. Being retired is fun!\n\nWant to make someone's day brighter in our town? Come help with us!\nHelp Today!\nOur Helpers: Ready to Give!\nOver 1,200 people help at the BC place every year. Lots of people help us by giving their time. These people are very kind, and we couldn't do a lot of our work without them. So, we are having a special week to say thank you to them!\n\nWe are going to say thank you to over 100 helpers this week with special meals and fun things to do. We are happy to show them how much we like them!\n\nHere is what some of our helpers say about why they like to help us:\n\"I like to help people in any way I can!\" - Xavier\n\"I help because I want to make things better. I didn't have a home when I was young, and now I want to help other people do well.\" - Matthew\n\"When I help, I can do a lot of things. This makes me feel important!\" - Yara\n\"Everyone is very nice, and I feel like I am part of the team!\"\n\"I like being here because everyone is nice and makes you feel like you belong.\" - Isabel\n\"I like helping because I get to meet lots of different and lovely people.\" - Jessica\n\"Helping here made me realize that I want to work with kids. It helped me understand what I want to do in life.\" - Sophia\n\"When I help, I feel like I am doing something good.\"\n\"I help because I want to give back to a place that helped me.\" \"Diana loves to make others happy. She volunteers at a place we'll call \"BC place\". Diana learns new things, meets new friends, and becomes a better leader there. You can join the helpers too!\nDiana is a helper who cuts hair. Many people in our town can't always go to a hairdresser. So, for more than 26 years, BC place has had a special day. Every Tuesday, people can sign up to get their hair cut for free. This happens because of kind helpers.\n\nSometimes, people need a haircut to look neat for a job meeting or a house meeting. But Diana says people ask for haircuts for many different reasons. She remembers a man with very long hair and a big beard. He said, \"Cut it all off!\" The man hadn't seen his daughter in a long time. He wanted to look good for his daughter's big school event the next day.\n\nDiana has been cutting hair at BC place for over six years. \"When I don't come, I miss the people there,\" she says. \"We know a lot of them. Diana loves helping people at the HC center. She likes to chat with everyone. She helps them feel good about themselves by giving them nice haircuts. When they see their new look in the mirror, they light up!\n\nSoon, some of Diana's friends are leaving the HC center. Diana hopes new friends will come and help. She tells everyone, \"Come and see! Spend time with us! Look at all the happy faces here. You can just visit, there's no need to promise anything.\"\n\nDiana plans to keep helping at the HC center for as long as she can. She feels happy when she helps someone feel better about themselves. She thinks more people should come and help.\n\nWe need more helpers for haircuts!\nYou can be a helper too!\nLet's say thank you to all our helpers!\nA special week called National Volunteer Week happens every year, where we say thank you to all the kind people who help out for free. Our center has over 1,200 helpers each year who kindly support our programs that assist those in need.\n\nThis is the 12th year of this special week and we hope more people can join in to show their appreciation to these helpers!\n\nIf you want to know more about how to be a helper at our center, you can visit our website.\n\nThere's a story from a helper named Sophia, who became an employee at our center. She first started helping, then participated in our programs, and finally joined us as a worker.\n\nSophia shared that she was surprised her journey with us did not end after her time helping and participating. Three years after she first walked into our Friendship Room, she came back, but not as a helper or participant this time.\n\nEver since Sophia heard a talk from someone at our center when she was in high school, she wanted to be part of our team. Even after she helped out, went to university in a different city, and worked somewhere else, she still thought about coming back to us. After studying, I went back to my hometown, ED city. I wanted to help people, so I tried to join a group called BC Centre. The first time I tried, I wanted to help in a program that helps people with no homes find a place to live and get the help they need. I didn't get the job, but I learned a lot about how BC Centre helps people in the city. I felt that people knew I really wanted to help.\n\nThen, in the month after September 2012, I got a job helping people find work. My boss, a man named Mark, saw that I really cared and that I could write well. He gave me a chance to show how much I wanted to help. \n\nI started my job at the end of that month. Since then, I've learned so much! I've learned how a group that helps people works, how to help people learn important skills, how to solve problems and how to make people feel strong and capable. I got to help a group that works hard to make sure no one in our community is poor.\nI once worked at a place where I learned many things to help me do a better job. I went there to help others, and I was surprised that I got a lot of help myself too. The people who run the place also let me use what I had learned about writing stories and talking to people for a few hours every week.\n\nThen, they gave me a very important job. I was to help with a project that teaches people about a problem that can happen when moms drink alcohol while they are pregnant. The project also helps the people who are dealing with this problem. I am very happy for all the chances I have had to learn and help others at this place. It has shown me how to really care about others and not be afraid to do hard things. I have also learned a very big lesson: that people can do amazing things when they are dealing with tough problems. This job has made my life better and more meaningful, and I am happy that I ended up working at this place. I am excited about what I will do and learn in the future.\n\nThis story is about a person who has been a helper, a learner, and a worker at the same place. It was written by a woman named Bella. This story is about my time at a special place called BR Centre. It happened in three parts. \n\nPART 2: Being Part of BR Centre\nAfter some time, I became more than just a helper at BR Centre. I joined one of the programs. Even though I was still helping out, the person in charge of Food Fun let me join a class about keeping people safe and healthy. It was an all-day class, and at the end, I got a paper that said I knew how to help people if they got hurt. I was really happy about this chance to learn something new, so I said yes right away. There were about 10 of us in the class. Some of us were moms, and others had to find someone to watch their kids for the day. \n\nPART ONE: Helping at BR Centre\nI first learned about BR Centre when I was still in school. Someone from the centre came to my class to talk about how they help people who need it. I can't remember who it was or what they did at BR Centre, but I remember they talked about hope. I heard this in 2005, and I still remember it now. I remember feeling so touched by the kindness and love that was all around. I was surprised at how much a group of people could do for others- how much help was there. And there was a big need for these kind of good deeds.\nIn a year not too long ago, I started volunteering for a place known as BC place. I had just seen a funny film about a man who decides to say \"Yes\" to everything. In the film, this man helped out by giving food to people who didn't have homes. Just like my mom knows, if I see something good being done, I want to do it too. So, I made up my mind. I was going to help feed people who didn't have homes. \n\nBC place was looking for new volunteers to join their group. These volunteers had a few jobs they needed to do:\nCome to group meetings every month\nUnderstand and believe in what BC place wanted to do.\nKnow about BC place's big plan and the good deeds they did.\nKnow about and come to BC place's special events and talk about BC place in their neighborhood.\nWorking together in a group is fun!\nBecome a team helper:\nOur friendly place likes everyone, but we're really looking for friends who know lots about:\nFeeling Good and Healthy\nKnowing the Community\nOur team has two special groups: The Counting & Saving group, and the People, Rules & Choosing group.\nIf you want to be a helper on our team or if you want to know more, look here to see all the team helpers' notice.\nDo you like to see people happy? Be a helper for our fun event and everyone is happy!\nThis was shared by our friendly place on a sunny summer day.\nHelp make our dream to help everyone by being a helper at our fun event and see people happy while raising things to help others!! With your help we will get a lot of things to support our work with the people that need it most!\nOur friendly place has a chance for a group of special people to be helpers for a day at our fun event. The things we get that night will help run our programs and services and will help those ready to make big steps in their lives by finding a safe place, finding work, feeling good and healthy and more!\nTo be a helper please reach out to Alice, the Helper and Event Manager, by calling on the big phone. There was a lady named Meg who liked to help at the BC center. She was part of a class at RJ school that liked to lend a hand at BC center. Meg was a special lady because even though she and her family had some difficulties, she still found time to help others. \n\nMeg once said, \"Sometimes, when life is tough, we all need help from others to feel better. I've had happy times, but there were moments when I needed others' help and kindness. When I see people at BC center, I see myself in them. We all need a place where we can find help when we need it.\"\n\nMeg believes in BC center's goal to help people live happier lives. \"I am lucky to have special skills that I can use to help people at the BC center. Doing this makes me feel like I am doing something good for everyone. I hope I can make a real change in the world.\" \n\nMatthew has done some amazing things for everyone around him. He not only helps at RJ school, but he also brings fun to the events at the BC center. He is a big part of getting things ready for our big BC party.\n\n\"I am lucky to have a good life and special skills that I can use to help other people. My aim is to use these skills to help people find the same happiness and safety that I have. I am thankful for places like BC center that help me reach my goals. I hope to be a part of BC center for a very long time.\"", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "b8ee2b83fdbd72fd67ceb4c6af5938d2c61bc4efd9dffdc302e9be66fa3b7632"}

{"text": "This is a webpage with many questions and answers. Who was Matthew and what did he do? Matthew was from a wealthy family. His dad was a brave soldier who worked for the king of FR country. After his dad returned from a battle, he wanted to bring the fancy culture of IT country to their home. So, he made their home beautiful, just like an old house from RO country. \n\nThere are also questions about names. How do you say \"Michael\" in a language from DU country? It's said as \"Machiel\". And what about the name \"Ephraim\"? It's a name from a famous book. \n\nThere's a word, \"stoicism\", do you know what it means? It's a way of thinking where you stay calm, no matter what happens. \n\nIs \"Michael\" a name for a boy or a girl? It's a name for a boy. It comes from a saying in an old language, which asks, \"Who is like God?\"\nToday, let's talk about a boy named Ethan. His name means \"Who is like a toy?\" You might remember a story about a boy named Jack who liked a girl named Rachel. Jack worked for 7 years to marry Rachel, but Rachel's dad, Mr. Liam, tricked him. Mr. Liam gave Jack his other daughter, Leah, to marry instead of Rachel. \n\nIn some places, Ethan is like the name Michael. In some languages, the name Michael is also common. Michael is a special way to say Ethan in another language.\n\nLet's talk about another boy named Ethan. His name means \"making lots of things\", like when you make lots of drawings or build lots of blocks. This is like when a man named Joseph had many children while he was living in a place called the EG country, which was not very nice for him.\n\nEthan is a boy's name that comes from very old languages, first used by a very important man named Ethan. In these languages, Ethan means \"making lots of things\".\n\nDid you know there was a place where people used to live called the RA town? A wise man named Samuel and a chosen boy named David hid there when they were running away from a mad king. Homes can also be called \"living places\" or \"dwellings\". A boy named Ethan has a name that means \"fruitful, fertile, productive\". There was a way of thinking started by a man named Zachary a long time ago. It taught people how to be good by using logic and understanding the world around them. In a place far away, \"Madison\" is a name often given to girls. However, in other places, \"Michael\" and \"Matthew\" are common names for boys, even though they look like \"Madison\" when written down. Ethan's dad only hired helpers who could speak a special language. They always had to speak this language with Ethan. His mom, dad, and helpers could only use the words Ethan knew in this language. This helped Ethan understand this language even better. Now, think about this: Nothing that is really good is easy to get. How would you pay for big school? What does a person who only thinks about themselves do when they don't talk to you? How do you change from one person talking to another person talking? Why do you feel sleepy even after you have had enough sleep? This writing is protected by a company.

It is all about choosing good over bad, light over dark, and hope over sadness. It's a huge and super important celebration day in IN country.\n\nA lady named Nora, who is famous for cooking special food in SA town, is opening her first big food place on this celebration day. She was born near a big city in IN country and her dad used to have a food place there. Nora brought the special food of IN country to SA town many years ago.\n\nPeople who often read the news will remember Nora's old food place where she used to cook food and people would take it home to eat. It was first in her house, then in a small shop. But she had to close it because her children were small and her husband was often away.\n\nFor the past few years, Nora has been cooking food at home for big parties like weddings and baby showers.\nA lady named Marwah is starting her first food place in the heart of a busy city. It used to be a diner called Mike's Lunch. Marwah is doing this because her children are all grown up and will soon be leaving home. She worries she'll have nothing to do when they're gone.\n\nMarwah is keeping herself busy today. She wants to be at her food place every day it's open because she's not ready to let others do the cooking. She also has to prepare food for three special events in the next few days. So, her food place will start slowly without people eating in for dinner until the following week.\n\nThe food place will be open from lunch until the afternoon and then again in the afternoon for people to pick up their orders. The tables for lunch today are already full. But remember, her food place will only be open on school days, not on the weekend.\n\nMarwah says, \"I don't want to open on the weekend because of my family. I want to keep it small. This is just to keep me busy and share my food with others.\"\n\nHer new food place will be the first to serve Punjabi food where people can sit and eat. Marwah is from Northern IN city, where they use different spices in their food. A lady from the PA region loves cooking with different spices. She's a bit nervous about using a small kitchen that everyone can see into. Usually, she likes to cook in a closed kitchen. But she's trying something new. She says, \"I don't want to make things too expensive. I just love cooking.

They're all thinking about Rod's family, who must be very sad too.\n\nCameron and Rod used to talk a lot. Sometimes they would just lean against a wall and chat about how to make their city a better place. Rod was really good at explaining things to everyone. Even when it was late at night and snowing outside, Rod would keep everyone updated about how the city was being kept clean and safe.\n\nCameron thought Rod was a very loyal friend. Rod was always ready to try new things and come up with new ideas. They became friends as soon as Cameron started working at the city office. Both of us came at the same time.

There, Ryan helped in different parts of Europe, including some difficult places, where he was the head of a team of helpers.

They learned all about a new play that is full of heart and is going to be shown at a special place.\n\nIn a third story, our friend talked to another play writer. They learned about a new play that's coming to a different theatre soon.\n\nIn the last story, our friend talks about a play that is very surprising and a bit scary. They thought the person who wrote the play did a really good job and wasn't afraid to talk about serious things.\nA person named Morgan made a play that makes us rethink what history plays are. This happened around a time when we were celebrating International Women's Day. Morgan is a very kind and inspiring person who writes plays. \n\nThere's another play called The Greater Game. This play is really good at showing respect to the real people it's about. It tells their story in a fun but caring way. \n\nSometimes, people feel really sad. It's nice to see a play like Dust, which is liked a lot. It makes the people at TS place feel like something special is happening. A lot of people really want to see it. \n\nThere are lots of plays that move from one place to another. Some of them are The Jungle and Heathers The Musical. Even if we can't see all of them, we still have a lot to talk about. \n\nFinally, there's a play called Schism at the PT place.

{"text": "Last year, a man named Jack compared how he and another man named Benjamin tackled a big illness. Jack said that Benjamin didn't do a good job. According to a report by Jack's team, Benjamin had everything he needed to fight the illness, like special medicines and lots of information. But even with all these things, more people got sick this year than last year. Benjamin promised to stop the illness but Jack's report said he didn't keep his promise. \"There is no solution from the big people,\" said Benjamin one day. \"This problem gets solved at the level of the big bosses.\"\nThe Yearly Look Back said:\n- By Benjamin's own rules, he should not be the boss. During a big talk in the late 20th century, Benjamin said, \"A lot of people are gone... anyone responsible for that should not stay as the boss.\" Since Benjamin became the boss, many more people have reportedly been sick.\n- After Benjamin said we won over the sickness early this year, cases have gone up a lot.\n- Over a big number of people have gotten sick on Benjamin's watch, and there are now a lot of new sickness cases every day -- nearly 3 times the average on the big voting day, and it's getting worse.\n- Lots of schools are closing again across the country as Benjamin admits he lost.\n- In the late 20th century, Benjamin promised that he would never make vaccines a must, saying, \"No I don't think it should be a must, I wouldn't make it a must.\" Less than one year later, Benjamin made a rule for vaccines and said that anyone who refused should be \"ready to pay.\"\nThe report also mentioned Team Benjamin's \"not caring\" about healing stuff.\n\"Boss Patrick invested a lot in making and speeding up healing stuff, and approved and sent out five healing things quickly. A big leader did a quick job, and lots of sick people got help from special medicines. But now, under a new leader, those special medicines are hard to find. This is a big problem. \n\nThe new leader did not do a good job in making sure there were enough new medicines to fight new sicknesses. Instead, he was more focused on telling people to get their shots and getting mad at people who didn't. \n\nThere is a new medicine that can help a lot if you take it soon after you get sick. But the leader said he didn't know how many of these medicines he got. He also said he hopes people won't need it if they get their shots. \n\nThe new leader also let the system that checks for sickness get worse. The country was not ready for a big wave of a new sickness. Many kits to test for sickness were thrown away, places to test got closed, and places making the tests stopped working and let their workers go. In the hot season, fewer health checks were done each day as a new type of germ started spreading. Later, a group of leaders did not agree to make lots more health checks that could have been used by everyone for free during holiday time. Over a big holiday, people had to wait a long time to get a health check and some couldn't get one or there were none left to get. This was happening even though the germ had been around for almost two years.\n\nAnother leader, however, was praised for creating the biggest and best system for doing health checks that people had ever seen. By a certain date, there had been more health checks done in this place than anywhere else in the world.\n\nThe report said that this leader had done a really good job handling the health problem, even though it was a very tough time.

{"text": "Big Changes in How Things are Invented\nBy a person learning about inventions\n\nSoon, there's going to be a big change in how people in many countries can protect their ideas for new things. This is the most important change in 50 years. When everything is ready, people can protect their invention in up to 24 countries all at once. This is different from before, when people had to protect their invention in each country one by one. Let's look back at how we got to this point.\n\nThe way we protect new ideas has a long history. Some people think it started in a very old time when people who found special things could make money from them for a little while.\n\nA more official way of protecting new ideas started much later in a place called IT country. In 1450, a rule was made in a city that people had to show their new ideas to the leaders if they wanted to be the only ones to make money from them for a while. As people traveled, other countries started doing the same thing. But, sometimes people used this in a wrong way. They would be the only ones allowed to sell normal things, not just new ideas. Instead of helping new ideas grow, the old way was often used by leaders to make people like them more and to make money.\n\nA big change happened when a king in EN country saw that protecting new ideas could help make new things that would make the country richer. Long time ago, kings and queens had the power to decide who could make or sell certain things. This could be toys, clothes, or even food. Then, one day, they changed the rules. They said that only new and special ideas could be protected like this. This was very important because it helped people come up with new and exciting inventions. \n\nSoon, people started inventing all sorts of things and these inventions spread all over the world. But the inventors didn't want others to copy their ideas. So, they started to protect their ideas in different places around the world. \n\nIn the olden days, people had to go to many places to protect their ideas. It was a lot of work! So, they made a new rule. This rule said that if you had a new idea, you could protect it in many places at once. \n\nToday, there is a big office that helps people protect their ideas all over the world. It makes it easier for people to protect their ideas. At the same time, there is also a special rule for a place called \"EU country\". This rule helps people get their ideas protected there. But, each part of \"EU country\" has its own rules for how to use the protected ideas. Two countries, LI country and SW country, have joined together to protect something very important. Soon, more countries in EU land will be able to do the same. They will have a special court to help them make sure everything is fair. This idea was first thought of a long time ago, and there were many problems along the way, but now it's finally happening. \n\nRemember, it's good to keep learning new things! You can find out more by looking at books, listening to people talk, or finding fun videos to watch.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "d812c92c962636dd4d19d598065ae1c9ee2646799ca2d002a45d29067a170736"}
{"text": "A teacher named Samuel wrote this story. Samuel was a smart teacher at a big school. He loved to learn about different places in the world, especially Africa. He also liked to learn about how places and people are connected. \n\nWhen Samuel first came to the school, he was very interested in the history of a place called CH city. He learned that CH city had a lot of ties with a place in Africa. These connections were not just sad ones because of something bad called slavery, but also happy ones. These happy connections can be seen in the way buildings look, the way people talk, and the music they play. He even wrote a story about how much CH city is like Africa.\n\nBefore Samuel came to the school, there was a special program. The program was about the history of CA region and the world. The program had lots of events every year. There were talks by teachers, special guests, movie nights, and even a big meeting most years. Samuel learned a lot from these events. He learned about the history of CA region and the world. He also learned about the sad history of slavery in CH city. I have been a helper and leader for a big program for many years. I am happy to have helped make many books. These books talk about many things, like big changes in our world, people being free, and important happenings. We also have big talks where we learn and share about these things. Sometimes, we have special events like remembering important people and times from the past. We even had a talk at a big church and remembered a very important time in our history. These events help us learn and remember our past.\nThere was a big art event in 2013, and it was organized by a man named Leo. He was very good at bringing smart people together to talk and learn. During this time, he also taught a class about a very important part of history, when people were treated unfairly and not allowed to learn. Leo's students did some amazing work and he wrote a story about what it was like to teach this class in a city called CH city. \n\nLeo and his friends also work with other places around the world that are learning about this part of history. They are very happy to be part of a big group of schools that are also studying this. \n\nIf you want to learn more about this time in history, you can look at a website called CL website. There is also a big library called AD library that has a lot of information. \n\nA man named Benjamin and his friends talked about these important topics at a meeting. In this chat, Samuel, Benjamin, and Jessica will talk about how we can make everyone feel equal, no matter their skin color or where they come from. They will look at the good changes that have been made at their school and in the world to make everyone feel more included. They will also talk about how their studies help everyone understand that being different is okay.\n\nThere are lots of ways their work connects with other projects at their school, too many to talk about in just a short time. Here are a few examples, and they hope to talk more about these projects in the future.\n\nAfter some people were treated very badly, many groups at their school said they wanted to see change. These messages were put up on the school's website. Later, Samuel's group asked for the school to make everyone feel included and equal.\n\nIn the past year, a group worked on a special project for the school's 250th birthday. They put up a sign that talks about how the school used to be private to avoid letting everyone learn there. A special day took place at the school on a winter day in 2020. There was a team who made a special website called \"Learning About Our Past.\" They found out lots of things about 13 places at the school. Most of these places had stories about people who had to work very hard a long time ago, and about people with dark skin. Once it is safe again, people can visit these places to learn more about them. A group of smart people at the school found out that some of the old school leaders used to make people work for them without pay. This information helped them write stories about two important buildings at the school. Other people can also write stories for the website, including a special group that studies about people who had to work without pay in a place called CH city. \n\nBig kids in Rachel's class wrote lots of stories. A group of people checked these stories, and now they are getting ready to put them on the website.\n\nIn the spring of 2019, a special day happened near GA building. People carried the old bones of people who came from Africa a long time ago. These bones were found when people were fixing up the GA building. Tests were done to find out where in Africa these people might have come from. Some people living in CH city also got tested to learn about their family from a long time ago. A group at the school helped start a special walk at BA park, and a woman named Katherine spoke at the special event. \"There was a special meeting planned for a time when the flowers start to bloom, but it didn't happen because of the sickness that was spreading. A meeting on the computer is being planned for the next time the flowers bloom.\nLuckily, the sickness did not stop a special computer classroom from sharing important stories and work by some people at school and others too.\nA movie called 'The Hidden Hands That Built These Walls', made by an office that celebrates different people, will be shown this time when we learn. It talks about a big building and the people who were forced to build it without being free. Some people did research and talked for the movie.\nA new plan, the '1967 Helpers', will start in the time when leaves fall, giving help and a four-year guide and leader program for students from Africa.\nLooking at History at the School--Research and Learning made in the year when we count to ten twice after 2000, this list shows work and classes where friends at school have looked at history. These stories are in many places, so maybe it's not surprising that when we count to six times ten in the year we count to ten twice after 2000, over sixty teachers are listed as writers of important writings below, and that over when we count to four and a half times ten teachers have been identified as teaching classes related to history since the time when leaves fall in the year we count to six times ten after 2000. These writings and classes cover many parts of history-the history of the school and the city, different people and the making of race here and other places; the experiences and cultural traditions of people who were not free and their children; connections between people moving and Africa, etc.\" A place called the Center for Learning about the Past wants to help teachers and kids learn more and share their findings. They've been doing some cool projects since 2018.\n\nOne project was about remembering people who had a tough time long ago. The kids made new statues to remember these people and to respond to an old statue and a special place where people were buried. Their statue designs got to be shown in a library and at public events.\n\nFor a while now, kids in two different study groups have been doing detective work on old buildings on the school grounds. They used records about properties, people, and the city to help them. Some of what they found out got written into a 2020 project called Discovering Our Past.\n\nA girl from the center's team, named Charlotte, did a big project in 2018. She found out about some school buildings that were named after people who owned slaves. She talked about this to the school group in a presentation. Everyone in the group agreed with Charlotte's idea to put up signs showing which buildings were built by slaves, like someone named Gabriel and a study group suggested in 2017.\n\nA boy named Thomas did a project in 2020. He looked in the school's old records and started a new competition about giving speeches. It was to remember a speech a boy named Frank gave in 1951. Frank's speech was about having students of all colors at the school. Thomas even got to publish some of what he found out.\nThomas and Katherine did some important work. They looked at old records and suggested a special tree-shaped statue. This statue would thank the people who built the school buildings long ago. They talked about their work and the statue in a class presentation.\n\nIn the next school term, the school started a new project. It was an online map where everyone could learn about all the statues, special buildings, and signs at the school. The map also helped everyone talk more about what the school remembers and why.

{"text": "A story about buying land\nby Jack the Job-Doer | One sunny day | Talking about Buying Houses | 10 thoughts\nFrom a big newspaper:\nOnce, there was a big, old shop in a popular place in BE city. This shop was special because many people wanted to own its land. One sunny day, some buyers from faraway places bought this land for lots of money.\nA group named Big Treasure, which was from a place very far away, bought the big piece of land at a busy road cross. They planned to build fancy homes there.\n\"This place is unique and cannot be found anywhere else,\" said David, a wise man from Big Treasure, which is known for buying and selling houses around the world. Big Treasure has owned a nearby famous hotel since a long time ago and knows the area well, David said. \"Our group only wants the best properties in the best places.\"\nDavid said that he was not sure when their new plan could be finished and agreed upon by the city's leaders, but that he didn't want to wait for more people to start buying houses again before beginning their work.\n\"Right now, not many people are buying houses, but surely one can't wait until more people start buying to build,\" he said. \"That would be too late.\"\nBig Treasure bought the old shop's land in a secret auction from a big bank. The bank was owned by a very rich man named Carlos. A group named 'CB' took over a big property. This happened after the group that had the property, run by two brothers named 'Nicholas' and 'Christian', couldn't keep it. The brothers were in the news in 2007 because they bought the property for a lot of money, making it one of the biggest buys in the history of LA county. The group that sold it to them, called 'NE', had bought the property for a lot less money three years before. \n\n'NE' had made a plan to knock down the old store on the property and build a big, fancy home and shopping area. The plan was made by a man named 'Richard', who is a builder. The new owners plan to do pretty much the same thing. \n\nThe brothers had thought about changing some of the homes into a fancy hotel, but the new owners want to keep it all as homes. They said, \"We already own the best hotel around here. We don't want to compete with ourselves.\" \n\nThere were some comments about this. 'Mike' said it might be too late for these plans. 'Daniel' noted that the property was sold for a lot less than it was bought for. This must have been hard for the brothers.\nAlice said, \"I don't think they understand how more expensive energy will change things for the people in LA city. People won't want to live in nice homes if everyone around them is poor.\"\nBenjamin said, \"It's like the money went from a lot, to a whole lot, to not so much, all in six years. The person who made a lot of money from this must be feeling very smart. I wish I knew how to make that much money in just three years. And, poor people don't live in BE town. They live very far from this place.\"\nDavid said, \"I agree. Those homes will be very popular, especially if there's a good place to park. If energy gets more expensive, people will want to live closer to where they work. It would be great if they planned a space for a store, a place to get coffee, a place to clean clothes, a place to get money, and a place to get your nails done.\"\nRyan said, \"I agree.\"\nPeople believe that the new houses will be bought quickly. Many people who work in the movie business will want to live there because it's in a good spot. There are shops and a big hotel nearby, and it's not far from a popular shopping street. People from other countries will spend money there too.\n\nOne person joked that they don't want to live there because there's no train passing by a lot like in their town. They said they like hearing the train bell.\n\nAnother person wished for a great store to open in their town.\n\nSomeone else made a funny wish. They asked for a big money problem in another country to keep going until they get all their money back.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "ad5f4c16a312131f743c6bc40ee40c17c1763600a8ecdc1323797c529aeadfcb"}

{"text": "ChatGPT is like a very smart robot that can do many things like writing stories. It's important to know how it works before we use it to write stuff for us. \nChatGPT is very good at what it does, so we need to think about using it to write things for us. \n\nWhy is ChatGPT So Good?\nWell, ChatGPT is a kind of smart robot called a Big Learning Model. This type of robot can guess what the next word in a sentence is because it has learned from many, many words. \nThe more words it learns, the more things it can do, like writing stories. \nSometimes, Big Learning Models can do things we don't expect. \n\nFor example, a school called SU talked about how GPT-3, another smart robot, could change words from English to another language, even though it wasn't taught to do that. \nBig Learning Models like GPT-3 are not taught to do specific things. \nThey learn from lots of different things and then use what they've learned to do other tasks. \n\nThis is like how a person learns. For example, if a person learns how to make things out of wood, they can use that knowledge to build a table, even if no one taught them how to do it. \nGPT-3 is like a person's brain because it has knowledge that it can use to do many different tasks.\nThere was a story about a smart machine from a place called \"ST University\". This machine was not like other machines that only did one thing. It was special because it could do many things, like writing stories, playing games, and helping with hard work.\n\nThe machine was called \"Big Brain Machine 3\" or BBM3 for short. It was different from other machines because it was becoming smarter, just like you and me.\n\nBBM3 had a friend named \"Iggy\". Iggy was trained to listen to people and give long answers to hard questions. This skill made Iggy able to write about any topic you can think of, just like when you are told to write a story about your favorite animal.\n\nBBM3 can write about almost anything because it has learned from many different books and stories. But there are some things that are hard for BBM3. One big problem is that BBM3 can sometimes make mistakes when it's writing because it's only guessing what words should come next. This is something to remember if you ever use BBM3 to help you write a story.\n\nBBM3 is also programmed to stay away from certain types of stories.\nFor example, a talking robot named 'Charlie' doesn't know how to talk about scary stuff, grown-up stuff, or dangerous things like making a boom-boom gadget. \n2. Doesn't Know New Things\nCharlie also doesn't know about things that happened after the year we call 2021. So if you want to talk about new and fresh things, Charlie might not be helpful right now.\n3. Likes to Be Nice\nSomething important to remember is that Charlie likes to be helpful, honest, and safe. These are not just good things, but they are built into Charlie on purpose. It seems like being safe makes Charlie avoid saying mean things. That's a good thing, but it can change a chat from being just okay to being happy. So sometimes, you have to tell Charlie exactly what you want. \nHere's an example of how this works. \nI asked Charlie to make up a story like 'Adam' and another one like mystery writer 'Ryan'. Both stories ended happily, which is not usual for these writers. To get a story that was more like what I wanted, I had to tell Charlie to avoid happy endings and for the story like 'Adam's' to have no clear ending, because that's how 'Adam's' stories usually are.\nIt's important to understand that a talking robot named ChatGPT has certain habits. It's like knowing how your friend likes to tell stories. \n\n4. ChatGPT Likes Clear Instructions\nChatGPT likes it when you give it lots of clear instructions. This helps it come up with better and more unique stories or ideas. The more you tell it what you want, the better it will do. This is both a good thing and something to remember. If you don't give it many instructions, it might end up saying something similar to what it said before to someone else. \n\nI tried an experiment. I asked ChatGPT the same question that some people asked on a website called Buy Facebook Verified. ChatGPT came up with a totally different answer, but it followed the same pattern. The answers were different, but they talked about the same things. They were like different stories with the same plot. \n\nChatGPT is made to choose random words when it's deciding what to say next, so it's not surprising that it doesn't repeat itself word for word. But the fact that similar questions get similar answers shows us that you can't just say \"give me this\" and expect something totally different. \n\n5. Can We Tell If ChatGPT Is Talking?\nLots of smart people at companies like GO company have been working on ways to tell if a robot like ChatGPT is talking. There are many papers and reports on this topic. I'll mention one from a month in 2022 that used examples from GPT-2 and GPT-3.\nA group of smart people did a project on finding ways to tell if a story was made by a computer. They tried many different tricks, like changing words to mean the same thing, or adding spelling mistakes. What they learned was that some ways of looking at the story could tell if a computer made it, even if the computer tried to hide it. \n\nAlso, the smart people from a place called OP company have come up with a way to mark stories made by their own computers, like ChatGPT. A person from OP company talked about this in a video. He said that good practices, like marking, could become a normal thing to do, just like Robots.txt did for ethical crawling. \n\nHe said: \"In the past, big internet companies have agreed on some rules, because they didn't want to get in trouble or they wanted to be responsible. One simple rule is robots.txt: if you don't want your website to be found by search engines, you can say that, and the search engines will respect it.\"\nThink of it like this: Imagine we had a special way to leave a hidden sign on something, like a secret mark. If we could show everyone that this secret mark doesn't hurt what it's put on and isn't too tricky to do, then everyone would want to use it. This would be especially true for people who want to show they're playing fair.\n\nThe secret mark that the scientist came up with is like a hidden message. Anyone who knows the secret can look at a piece of writing to see if it has the secret mark. This mark tells us if a computer made the writing.\n\nThe secret message can be hidden in the way we use little signs like periods or commas, or in the words we choose. \n\nThe scientist explained why this secret mark is so important. He said, \"My main job has been to make a tool that puts a hidden message in the writing made by a computer program. When this program writes a long piece of text, we want there to be a secret sign hidden in the words. This sign can show us later that yes, this text was made by the program. We want it to be really hard for someone to take text made by the program and try to pretend a person wrote it.\"\n\nThis could be useful for making sure nobody is copying someone else's work. But it could also help stop people from making lots of fake messages. For example, someone could fill up every blog with comments that look like they're on topic but are actually just promoting bad actions, like a country invading another country. And they could do all this without needing lots of people to write these comments.\nA smart person was talking about how it can be tricky when someone copies the way another person writes to get them in trouble. He talked about how using a special mark can help find out if a machine has written something. But, he also said that with enough work, even this special mark can be tricked. For example, if you used another smart machine to change the words around, it would be hard to find the special mark. He said that they are hoping to use these special marks more in the future.\n\nIs it a good idea to use smart machines to help you find things on the internet? \nSome people think you can't tell if a smart machine wrote something. This doesn't make sense to others because they believe it's been figured out how to tell if a machine wrote something. Even if the machine tries to hide it, people can still tell. They've been studying this for a long time, including how to tell if something was first written in a different language.\n\nThe rules say you shouldn't let a machine write things for you. So, it's important to remember that.\n\nFinally, the smart person said that they hope to put a special mark in the things that the talking smart machine writes in the future.\nSometimes, a tool called ChatGPT might be changed to have a special mark on it. \n\nUsing AI for SEO the right way\n\nAI tools can be very helpful for making SEO work easier. They can do the boring jobs like looking up information and studying it. One good use might be to make a short description of a website, because GO company says that's okay. \n\nChatGPT could be used to write a quick summary or piece of content. But, using AI to write all your content and then just publishing it might not be the best idea. This is because it could get noticed and cause the website to get in trouble.\n\nAt the end, there's a picture by a person named Best SMM Panel/Roman Samborskyi. They also talk about some other SEO tips and if SEO works during tough times.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "53e932f38ed8360123a2b51f5a761c7a80a0bc16c8c1fab8e19e13fbe1414866"}

Some of our fresh water is getting salt in it, and that means we have less fresh water to drink.\n\nA big study group guessed that a lot of salt and other stuff goes into our fresh water every year. This stuff comes from different places. When we use stuff to make water soft or melt ice on roads, it can put salt in our water. When we use chemicals to get oil from the ground, it can also put salt in our water. Nature can put salt in our water too, like when rocks break down. Even a tiny bit of salt can make a lot of water dirty.\n\nThere's a place in SP country that cleans salt from water. Picture: This image was taken by a person named Jack.\nSometimes, we need to take tiny things out of water. Two ways we do this are like making soup or using a special net. When we make soup, we heat up the water until it turns into steam. The tiny things, like salt, can't turn into steam so they stay behind. The other way is like using a special net that only lets water through. This way, the water can pass but the salt can't.\nAround the world, getting clean water is getting harder because of changes in our weather. Some places might not have enough water, and this could make it hard to grow food. A group in the FR country thinks getting clean drinking water will be a big problem in the future. Even in the US country, many places might not have enough water soon.\nBig groups like the US School of Smart People and the National Group for Water (NGW) are trying to find new ways to clean water. They want to get better at taking tiny things out of water and finding other ways to save water. A big group of helpers in the US are working on a project to clean water. They are trying to take the salt out of the water. They are helping another project that has been successful in making a special thing that can catch salt.\n\nThe Salt Catcher\nThe helpers from a big school shared their work in a science book. They told us about the special thing they made that can catch salt. They used tiny parts to make it. These tiny parts are very strong, much stronger than the ones used in a similar thing made a long time ago at the same school. \n\nThere is a picture of salt, but we can't show it here. \n\nA student named Yun from the school did a lot of the work. He works in a lab with a teacher. Yun says that if we took a very, very, very small piece of the salt catcher and put it into a lot of water, it could catch all the salt.\nThe big helpers made something that can stick to a tiny thing found in table salt. They used little bits of air, black stuff, and water bits to make a new special thing. They used six of these special things to make a cage that can hold the tiny thing from the salt. This new cage is better than the old cage they made before because it can hold the tiny thing much better. The cage is very strong and keeps its shape even when the tiny thing from the salt is gone. People tried to make little boxes from chemicals before, but they usually fell apart because they were too bendy. But the new little box model is much better and can do more things.\n\nThe new little box is made from very special bonds that include carbon and hydrogen. Some people thought these bonds were too wobbly and weak to work with a thing called chloride. Usually, people used bonds that included nitrogen and hydrogen for working with chloride. But, when these special bonds called triazoles are arranged in the shape of a little box, they make a very stiff and sturdy structure. This structure is so stiff that it's like an empty space is made in the middle of the little box, and this empty space is what pulls chloride into the little box.\n\nA similar way has been used to make little boxes from nitrogen-hydrogen bonds, but these boxes are usually much more bendy and don't work as well compared to the new little box. The empty space in the middle of the little box made from nitrogen-hydrogen bonds needed extra energy to capture chlorides, unlike the triazole structure.\n\nAdam says that the new little box is much, much better than other little boxes that use stronger bonds, and that being stiff is really important in making these little boxes.\n\nDavid says that it took about a year to make the first little box. He also says that the things needed to see the structure of the little box were made after the experiment had been put away for a while. When he saw how these things were formed, David understood that the special structure of the little box could work and could be made again. A smart helper in a science place figured out how to make a tiny thing again after a few months. Cameron was the helper's name and he worked in a place where they study tiny things. Cameron's job was to make sure the tiny thing was made right, and he used a special machine to do that.\nThere have also been other discoveries to help clean salty sea water. Some helpers from a school in IS country have found a way to make cleaning the sea water cheaper. They found a way to stop tiny plants from growing on the cleaning machine, which makes it work better. \nIS country has had little rain and needs more clean water for people's homes, jobs, and growing food. The country is planning to fight long dry times by using machines to clean sea water. They are going to start building a big water cleaning place in the near future, and in a few years, most of their drinking water will come from the sea. This need made the helpers at the school find ways to stop the tiny plants from growing on the cleaning machine.\nSome smart people in a far away place found a way to make their water filters better and last longer. They used tiny things called molecules to help the filters stop bad tiny creatures from growing. These molecules come from a special thing called polymer. When they put this special thing on the filters, they noticed that less bad tiny creatures were growing on it. The leader of the smart people, let's call him Ryan, said this special thing can make the filters work for a much longer time.\n\nOther places in the world are also trying to make clean water. One country, let's call it NA country, is using a special machine powered by sunlight to clean their water. This machine was made by a group from a place we'll call FI country. It uses the sunlight to power a process that takes the salt out of the water. This process needs the water to stay the same level of hard push, and the machine can do this using only the power it gets from the sunlight. It can do all this without needing to be connected to power lines or big, pricey power storage boxes. This sun-powered water cleaning machine can make about 3500 big bottles of clean water every hour.\n\nWe also learned about two ways to use less energy and asked a question about something we thought we knew about our bodies.\nHeadaches That Hurt a Lot\nMaking Fuel from Leftover Sugar Plant Parts\nFinding Special Stuff in Spit\nWhat About Bugs with Wings?

{"text": "Long, long ago, there was a powerful land known as the FR country. This country wasn't always there. It started in a time when kings and queens ruled the lands, and ended when the MI Ages were over. \n\nIn the beginning, people in this land believed in many different gods and spoke many different languages. But as time went by, they started believing in just one God and speaking one language.\n\nThere was a big change when a man named Adam arrived. He fought a big battle and won. After this, the FR country was known and recognized by other lands. \n\nLater, this country changed in many ways. They started to believe in a kinder God and everyone started using the same language. There was a leader named Samuel who became very powerful and was known as a Tsar. \n\nBut nothing lasts forever. Eventually, the FR country became a part of a bigger empire. But its story didn't end there. After some time, a new FR country was born.\n\nThis great land had two big cities where its leaders lived. First, it was PI city, and then it moved to PR city. This is the story of the first FR country.\nA long time ago, in a place called BU country, there was a kingdom. This kingdom existed in the old days, between the time when people first started counting years and a few hundred years later. The kingdom was started when a group of tribes, led by a man named Adam, moved to a new place. This place was near big rivers and the sea. Adam and his tribes were able to live there because they won a battle against another big kingdom's army, maybe with some help from the local people.\n\nThis kingdom grew very strong and big. It reached from a big bend in a river all the way to the sea, and from another big river to another sea. The kingdom was so big and strong that it was the main rival of another big kingdom nearby. They had many wars, but also times of peace and working together. For example, one time, the kingdom's army helped break a big attack on the other kingdom's big city, and stopped the attackers from coming into the area. A long time ago, there was a big and strong country called BG land. People from BG land learned a lot from another place called BY city. They even started believing in the same thing BY city people believed in. BG land became even bigger when a nearby group of people stopped being together.\n\nBG land had some troubles too. They met with people from different places who wanted to take over their land. But BG land was strong, they even won a big fight against another group of people, making them live far away.\n\nIn those days, there was a great leader in BG land called Samuel. Samuel won many fights against the people of BY city. People started calling him a great leader. He made BG land very big. But after a big fight, BG land was not so strong anymore. The people of BY city became strong again and won many fights against BG land. Finally, BG land had to join BY city. But after some time, BG land became a separate place again.\n\nAfter BG land people started believing in what BY city people believed in, BG land became a very important place for all the people who spoke the same language. They even created their own way of writing in their capital called PR city. This new way of writing became very popular and started spreading to other places. A long time ago, there was a language spoken by many people in the east, we'll call it the \"Old Language\". This language was used by lots of different tribes, who slowly started to speak the same way, creating a new group of people from the 7th century to the 9th century. As time went on, these people became known as the \"Bulgarians\", and they were proud of their unique identity and language.\n\nIn the early days, their land was simply known as \"BU country\". Some people used other names to talk about it, but \"BU country\" was the most common. There was another place, far away, with a similar name, so to make sure no one got confused, they sometimes called their land the \"BU Kingdom near the big river\".\n\nOver time, the name of the land changed a few more times. For a while, it was called the \"BU Kingdom\", and later, it was known as the \"BU Prince's Land\". There was a big land known as the BG country. A long time ago, many people lived there. Some of these people were called Thracians, and they lived in the eastern parts of BG country. Over time, a powerful kingdom called the Roman Empire took over the area. But, after many years, the Roman Empire became weak, and many parts of the BG country were left without help.\n\nMany changes were made to try and fix things, but they didn't work very well. During the time of a powerful leader, some places were made better, but after he left, things got tough again.\n\nThere was also another group of people called Slavs, who lived to the north of BG country. They came to the area a long time ago. A long time ago, there was a big group of people who all spoke the same language. These people were split into two groups, and they were known as the southern people. They moved to a new place and started living there. This happened when a group called the Avars moved between two big rivers and took control of many other groups of people.\n\nAt the same time, another group of people called the Byzantines were busy fighting with the Persians. They didn't have enough resources to stop the southern people from moving in. The southern people came in large numbers, and they didn't have a leader, so it was hard to stop them. As the fight with the Persians continued, more and more southern people moved to new places, even as far as some islands in a big sea. The Byzantines were able to keep some of their coastal towns, but they lost control of many areas.\n\nThere was another group of people called the Bulgars. They were warriors who moved around a lot and came from far away. Nobody is sure exactly where they came from. There was a group of people who spoke a language that was a bit like TU country. As they moved from place to place, they met different people and learned new things from them. They were called the BG people and they had many different tribes. \n\nThe first time we hear about the BG people is around the time when they helped a very important man from the BE city against another tribe. Around this time, some of the BG tribes were living near a big lake while others were living on wide, open lands. They sometimes bothered the people of the BE city. But then, other powerful groups took control of the BG tribes.\n\nAs one of the powerful groups became less strong, another group took control of the BG people again. But, between 630 and 635, a man named Kubrat from the D clan was able to bring the BG tribes together. They became a strong group known as Old Great BG, and they lived between a big lake, a sea, and some mountains. A long time ago, there was a leader named Kevin who was a very good friend of the emperor of a big empire. They stayed friends until Kevin got very old and passed away. Kevin had five sons - Benjamin, Cameron, David, Ethan and Frank. When their dad passed away, they all decided to go to different places with their friends. Benjamin stayed at home and became a friend of the people who lived in the east. Cameron moved to a land near a big river. David led his friends to the west, near a different river. Ethan first lived in a place ruled by another tribe, but then he decided to move to a place called MA region. Frank moved to IT country. \n\nAfter their dad passed away, David's friends moved westwards to a place now called BE region. They made new friends in the lands north of a big river in the modern WA region and made a new home in the Delta of the big river. In the 670s, they moved across the river to a grassland which was part of a big empire. This grassland had lots of food for their large herds of animals. They also had control over the grazing grounds to the west of a river. Long ago, a big leader named Cameron (like our friend Cameron!) led a huge team to chase away the bullies from the playground. But, they were defeated by a really strong boy named Adam at a place that was all muddy and full of water. Adam and his friends then went ahead, climbed over the tall mountains, and entered another playground.\n\nFinally, Cameron and his team had to say sorry and promise to be nice. They even had to give Adam and his friends their own playground and some of their toys every year. A person from another place wrote in his big book that Adam and his friends got their own playground in the year, which was a long, long time ago.\n\nThis was the first time Cameron's team had to give up part of their playground. When it came to dealing with the local kids in the playground, some people think Adam and his friends made a promise with them, but most people believe that they were told what to do. Adam and his friends were better at organizing games and stronger, so they were the leaders. But, they also worked with the local kids to keep the playground safe. The Slavs were able to keep their leaders and follow their usual ways. They had to give gifts and help with soldiers for the army. Seven Slavic groups were moved to the west to keep the border safe from the AK country. Another group was moved to the eastern mountains to keep the mountain paths safe from the BE empire. It's hard to know how many of Adam's Bulgar people there were. Some people like Victor and Jack think there weren't many, maybe around 10,000. But Samuel thinks there were a lot more. The Bulgars made their home mainly in the north-east, where they built a big camp called Pliska, which was protected by walls made of dirt.\n\nIn the north-east, the fight with the Khazars kept going and in 700, Adam lost his life in a fight with them. Even though this was sad, the country kept getting stronger under Adam's next leader, Thomas (r.700-721). In 705, he helped a fallen BE emperor get his job back. In return, he got a piece of land in Northern Thrace, which was the first time the country grew bigger than the southern mountains. Thomas also got a big title like an emperor and sat next to the Emperor. He got a lot of respect from the people of the BE city and lots of gifts. Long ago, Benjamin tried to get back the land he gave away, but his friends were beaten at AN city. They kept arguing until 716 when Henry made a big deal with BY country. This deal talked about where the borders were, money they had to give, how they traded things, and how they would swap prisoners or people who ran away. When AR people tried to take over CO city in 717-718, Henry sent his friends to help. In a big fight near CO city, the friends beat between 22,000 and 30,000 AR people, making them stop their attack. Most people who know about old times agree that this win was very important in stopping the AR people from attacking EU continent.\n\nAfter King Samuel (r.738-753) left, the ruling family ended, and the kingdom was in a big problem. During this time, the young land was almost destroyed. In just fifteen years, seven kings ruled, and all of them were hurt. The only stories that are left from this time are BY stories and they only tell the BY side of the problem in the kingdom. They talk about two groups fighting for power--one that wanted to be peaceful with the Empire, which was the bigger group until 755, and one that wanted to fight. These stories talk about the issues with the BY Empire as the main problem in this fight and do not talk about the other reasons, which could have been more important for the kingdom's important people. A long time ago, in a far away land, two groups of people lived together. One group was bigger, but the other was more powerful. They often disagreed, but no one really knew why. Some people think that the powerful group wanted to fight, while the bigger group wanted to live peacefully. \n\nDuring this time of confusion, a strong leader named 'Cameron' from another place saw an opportunity. He was known for his bravery and had stopped threats from distant lands. Now, he focused on this land. He attacked several times, winning some battles but also losing some. He even lost many of his ships in a big storm at sea.\n\nThese attacks made the problems in the land worse. But, they also made the people realize they needed to work together to protect their land. They became upset with their leader, 'Samuel', and blamed him for their troubles. They said, \"Because of you, Cameron's people will take over our land!\" \n\nIn 774, their new leader 'Thomas' played a clever trick on Cameron. He got Cameron to reveal who his spies were in their land. Once he knew who they were, Thomas made sure they couldn't spy anymore. The next year, Cameron went on another attack but he didn't make it. He passed away during the campaign. In simple words, there was a big fight between two groups, the BullyBulls and the BusyBees. The BullyBulls were strong and didn't let the BusyBees rule over them. Even though the BusyBees tried many times, they couldn't win over the BullyBulls. Because of this, the BullyBulls didn't like the BusyBees very much. One day, the leader of the BullyBulls, King Kevin, won a big fight and the BusyBees had to give gifts to the BullyBulls. After this, the BullyBulls became even stronger.\n\nIn the time of King Kevin, the BullyBulls' home became bigger. They took over more places near the big river and even places where the AngryAvians lived. After a while, the BusyBees tried to take over some places where the SleepySlavs lived. This made the BullyBulls confront the BusyBees once again. Long, long ago, there was a big fight between two groups of people. The leader of one group was a strong man named Cameron. His group won many fights and took over a big city called SO city. But then, a man named Nathan, who was in charge of the other group, decided to fight back. Nathan's group won a big fight and even took over Cameron's city, but on their way home, Cameron's group fought them again and won. After the fight, Cameron's group took over another big city and moved many people to a new place they called \"BD land\". \n\nCameron planned to take over Nathan's big city, and he even made big wagons to carry things they would need for the fight. But sadly, Cameron passed away before he could do it. Before he died, Cameron made rules for everyone in his land to follow. These rules were for everyone, no matter who they were, and they helped make sure everyone had what they needed.\n\nAfter Cameron, a man named Oliver became the leader. Oliver made a long peace agreement with Nathan's group. This helped both groups to stop fighting and start making their cities better. They even made a line to show where each group's land started and ended. In the old days, the BG people lived in the west and had a big city called BE city. They also lived near the FR country. They had a river to the north-east and had some troubles with the KH people who lived there. In the middle of their land, they had a big city called PL city. In this city, they built a lot of things like a grand castle, temples, homes, a fort, and even a bathhouse, all made from stone and brick. The ruler of the BG people, who we'll call Oliver, was not very nice to some people who believed in a different thing than he did. He was especially mean to the people who lived to the south of the big river. \n\nOliver's helpers kept making their land bigger to the south and south-west even after Oliver was not the ruler anymore. Under a new ruler, who we'll call Matthew, they added a very important city, PH city, to their land. Another ruler, who we'll call Patrick, made their land even bigger and it reached all the way to the big water. The people who wrote history for the BY people didn't say that there was any fight when the BG people made their land bigger, so we think it happened peacefully. BU city was the strongest country in the Balkans. There was a new country called SE city, which was friends with the Byzantine Empire. BU city and SE city didn't get along and even fought for a few years, but BU city couldn't beat SE city. Some people say SE city won, but others think they just gave some things to BU city to stop fighting. \n\nA man named Benjamin ruled BU city and he had a lot of troubles. He had fights with many different countries. Also, there were some natural problems like earthquakes and a year without enough food, even bugs eating the crops. But Benjamin was smart and he kept his country together. \n\nDuring this time, people started liking Christianity because it helped them make friends with other countries. Seeing this, Benjamin also became a Christian in the middle of the 9th century. He was then called a Prince. In a time long ago, a smart leader named Benjamin worked hard to make sure his new church was free and safe. He wanted to make sure no one from outside could tell his people what to do. He asked some smart people to write important books in the language his people spoke. Benjamin was very strict with anyone who didn't want to follow the new ways. He stopped a big argument with his own helpers in a tough way, and even had to stop his own son, Victor, from bringing back the old ways. \n\nIn a big meeting, Benjamin made some big decisions. He decided to move the main city from one place to another. He told all the teachers from the outside to leave and replaced them with his own people. He also decided that their own language should be used in their church instead of the language from the outside. This made his land a big worry for the people in the big city nearby. \n\nAfter this big meeting, the people in the big city couldn't tell Benjamin's people what to do anymore. The big city even moved the market place away from them, which made it harder for them to sell and buy things. This was against an old agreement they had made before. There was a king named Samuel I who was very strong and brave. He had a fight with the soldiers from a place called BY country. The BY people asked for help from some neighbors who lived far away. These neighbors won two times against Samuel's team and took some things from a place in Samuel's kingdom. But Samuel didn't give up. He made friends with another group of people and together, they won a big victory against the neighbors. The neighbors couldn't go back home and had to move to a new place, where they made their own kingdom. \n\nMeanwhile, Samuel's team won another big fight against the BY people. The BY people asked for peace and agreed that Samuel's kingdom was the strongest. They also promised to give Samuel some gifts every year. This peace agreement lasted for a while, even though Samuel didn't always follow it. However, the peace ended when the leader of the BY people decided to stop giving gifts to Samuel's kingdom, which led to another big fight. Samuel was a very strong and ambitious leader, who wanted to be the big boss and unite two big kingdoms. He had a powerful army, and in a big battle, his army won against another really strong army. This made his army the strongest in the land. People said that it was a big fight like no one had seen in a long time. Even after many years, one could still see the remains of the soldiers who fought in that battle. Samuel's army kept winning more battles, and they took over many important cities. \n\nHowever, the defeated army tried to get another kingdom to fight against Samuel's army from the other side. But Samuel's army was so strong, they stopped this attack easily. One time, a small part of Samuel's army was surprised and defeated. But Samuel quickly fought back and took over that kingdom by the end of the year. \n\nAnother king, Thomas from the TC country, who was friends with the defeated army, managed to stop Samuel's army from expanding any further. Samuel knew he needed big boats to take over a big city. In 922, he asked a powerful king in the MA country for help. The king sent helpers to the BU country to make a team. But, on their way, they were caught by another group near the CA coast. The other group's leader, named Ryan, stopped them from teaming up by giving them lots of gifts. The fight went on until Samuel's end in a month of spring. By then, BU country had taken over almost all of the other group's lands, but they didn't try to take the big city because they didn't have big boats.\n\nBoth groups were very tired from all the fighting, and it was hard on the people and their homes. Samuel's next leader, named Patrick, made a peace deal. The other group agreed to call him the leader of BU country and respect their church, and also to give them gifts every year. The peace was made stronger with a marriage between Patrick and Ryan's granddaughter named Isabel. This deal brought 40 years of peace between the two groups. In his first years as a leader, Patrick had to stop fights started by his two brothers, named Jack in 928 and Michael in 930, but he managed to calm them down. Peter, a great leader, helped his country have a wonderful time of growth and learning for many years. But, his country was in a tough spot. It was surrounded by not-so-friendly neighbors. Some neighbors from the NW and NE were always looking for trouble. The neighbors from the south were not trustworthy. His country faced some hard times between 934 and 965 because of these troublesome neighbors.\n\nIn addition, the rich and powerful people were taking away the rights of the regular folks. This made a lot of people unhappy and led to new ideas that spread to many other places. The southern neighbors were not doing well in their fights against another powerful group, and they stopped paying money they owed. This made things between them and Peter's country even worse. In 968, the southern neighbors got the NE neighbors to attack Peter's country. After two years, the NE leader won, took over Peter's main city, and made it his new home. In a tough time, old PeterI gave his crown to his son Boris II. Boris II had to work with Svyatoslav. The Rus' people did so well in battles that they had to face the big empire. The big empire's leader, Jack I, defeated Svyatoslav's team and made him leave in 971. Jack I took over Preslav and caught Boris II. At first, Jack I acted like a hero, but then he made Boris II quit being a king in Constantinople. Even though the big empire only controlled the east part of the country, they said the whole of BU city was theirs. The lands to the west of the big river were still free and the BU country people, led by four brothers, were ready to fight back. By 976, the youngest brother, Samuel, became the leader after his older brothers passed away. When Boris II's brother Roman escaped from being trapped in Constantinople in 976, Samuel saw him as the Emperor but stayed as the head of the BU country army. There couldn't be peace because the big empire saw Roman and Samuel as rebels. The big empire's leader had to show he was the boss over them. There was a long fight that lasted for over 40 years. A smart and strong man named Samuel was able to help his team do better. There was a big fight and the leader of the other team, Benjamin, almost didn't make it. A man who liked to write poems, named Jack, wrote about this.\n\nRight after they won, Samuel and his team went east and got back some important places. In the next ten years, they made their land bigger by getting more places to the south and even taking things from other places. Many people from the other team started to join Samuel's team, and it looked like they might lose everything. But then, Samuel's team had to worry about the other team making friends with the people from SE country. So, in a year we'll call 'Year 1', Samuel won a fight against a prince named Jovan and took over the prince's lands. After the last person from a special family passed away, Samuel was made the leader of his country. He became friends with a man named Stephen from HU country by arranging a marriage between their children. But later, his son, Gabriel, sent his wife away and HU country joined the other team in 'Year 2'. After 'Year 2', the fights started to go in favor of the other team, led by Benjamin, who started to take over the cities and places that belonged to Samuel's team. Long ago, in a big fight, a king named \"Benjamin\" won against \"Samuel\" and took over his city. This fight went on for many years until Benjamin finally won a big victory. It's said that he treated the people he caught very badly, which made him very scary. When Samuel saw what happened, he was so shocked that he got very sick and passed away a few days later. \n\nAfter this, some leaders named \"Ryan\" and \"Isaac\" tried to keep fighting for four more years, but they couldn't win. When Isaac was gone, the leaders decided to stop fighting and let Benjamin rule their land. But Benjamin was not nice to them. He moved many of their leaders away, so they lost their natural leaders. \n\nEven though they were not free, the people still kept some of their own ways and rules. They tried many times to get their freedom back but could not. It was not until many years later when two brothers named \"Adam\" and \"Patrick\" were able to free their country, and they started a new kingdom.\nThere was a big and strong kingdom long ago. The king of this kingdom took care of many things. He made sure his kingdom was safe. He was the boss of all the soldiers. He also helped solve problems between people. He even led special ceremonies before people knew about God. He was very important in making friends with other kingdoms.\n\nIn the beginning, people called their king \"Khan\". Later on, after people started to know about God, they called their king \"Prince\". And even later, they called their king \"Emperor\". But the king wasn't the only one in charge. There were other important families and a big group of people who also made decisions for the kingdom. This big group would gather to talk about important things for the kingdom. \n\nOnce, this big group decided they didn't want their king anymore because he wanted to be friends with a kingdom they didn't like. In their kingdom, the king was not the boss of everyone. He was just the first among all the important people. That's why one of their kings decided to believe in God. He thought that as a king who believes in God, he could be a better leader. \n\nBut even before this, one of their kings already believed he was better than the king of the kingdom they didn't like. He even wrote about it on a big stone.\n\nApart from the king, there was another important job in the kingdom. This job was only for people from a special family. There was a very important person called a kavhan. This person had a big job and could tell the left side of the army what to do. Sometimes, he could even tell the whole army what to do. He could also help rule when the king was too young. There was a time when a king named Matthew and a kavhan named Isaac worked together. There was another kavhan named David who helped a king named Gabriel.\n\nThere was another important person called an ichirgu-boila. This person told the right side of the army what to do when there was a fight. He might have also talked to people from other countries. He had 1,300 soldiers who listened to him. A historian named Victor thinks that a king named Kevin might have made this job to make sure the kavhan didn't become too powerful.\n\nEven though the people didn't have their own way of writing, they had many big rocks with writing on them. This shows that the king had people who helped him write things down. Some of these people might have been from another place called the GR country. They might have even been monks, even though the people in the country didn't follow the same religion.\n\nThere is a big rock that tells us that during the time of King Matthew, there were three types of people in the country. Long ago, there were two types of people - regular people and special people. The special ones were first known as 'boila', but the name changed to 'bolyar' after a while. Each group of special people had their own symbol and believed they were chosen for a special reason. This is why they didn't like the new belief of Christianity, because they saw it as a challenge to their special status. Some groups were very old and could be traced back to the time when the Bulgars lived far away to the north and east.\n\nThree important groups ruled until a time long ago - Dulo, Vokil, and Ugain. Unfortunately, the power of these important families became less after a big disagreement about Christianity. During this time, a man named Boris punished 52 leaders along with their families.\n\nThe special people were split into two groups - inner and outer. The most important jobs were given to people from these groups. The outer ones probably lived outside the capital city, while the inner ones lived close to the king.\n\nThere was another group of special people called bagains. They were the second most important group and had many different ranks. This means there were two separate groups of special people. This was confirmed when Boris wrote about the 'primates' and the 'mediocres seu minores'. Long ago, there was a special group of people called tarkhans. We don't know much about them from the old writings, but we know they were important. In the old times, there were many different groups and titles that were kept even after people in the land started following Christianity. This all happened before the first big kingdom fell. \n\nAround the start of the 9th \"hundred years,\" new people, like the Slavs and Greeks from a place called BY country, started to join the important groups in the land. This made the king even more powerful because he wasn't just relying on the old, important families anymore. Some new titles, like upan, became more common, and sometimes they mixed them together to make titles like upan tarkhan.\n\nThere were also people who worked on the farms and lived in groups called zadruga. They were mostly free and lived under the laws of the king, especially after people started following Christianity. But as time went on, more and more of these farm workers were tied to the land owned by the important people or the church.\n\nWe don't have a lot of information to understand how the land was divided and ruled. We know that the Slavic tribes kept their own rules at first, but around the start of the 9th \"hundred years,\" things started to change. As the land of the kingdom grew bigger, the king needed to control it better and make sure the tribes didn't try to break away. Long ago, some groups in a western part of \"BU country\" wanted to be ruled by the \"FR country\". Their leader, Oliver, replaced the old leaders with his own helpers. The land was split into different areas, each managed by a helper. We don't know how many areas there were, but a man named Henry talked about a big disagreement against leader Benjamin that was started by the leaders of 10 areas. These areas were split into smaller parts. The helper in charge was chosen by the leader, and had a helper of his own who helped with safety and order. One of the areas we know about was in the southwest of \"BU country\", and it was where \"MA country\", \"AL country\", and \"GR country\" are today.\n\nThe first known set of rules in \"BU country\" was made by leader Kevin at a big meeting at the start of the 800s, but we only have some parts of it left in a big book from the 900s. A long time ago, there was a king named Kevin. He made some strict rules for his kingdom. If someone said something that wasn't true or accused someone wrongly, they could be in big trouble. Those who stole things or hid thieves would also be punished. Some people say that Kevin wanted to pull up all the grapevines to stop people from drinking too much. But that might not be right, because when another king named Nicholas found the city, there was a lot of grape juice. And Kevin even used Nicholas's cup to drink after he won.\n\nMany people think Kevin made these rules to make his kingdom stronger and to make sure everyone followed the same laws. But we don't have the exact words of these laws, so we can't be sure.\n\nLater, a king named Benjamin became a Christian. He was very interested in making laws, so he asked a wise man named Nicholas to help him write some. They made a big book of rules for everyone in the kingdom. This book had rules about lots of different things, like fighting, owning things, and how to behave. It also had rules on how to decide if someone had done something wrong.\n\nThe book of rules also talked about old beliefs, what people can say, how husbands and wives should treat each other, and what should happen with things people find after a fight. It said that if a village kept following the old beliefs, all their land would be given to the church. If a rich person followed the old ways, his land would be sold and the money would be given to people who didn't have much.\nA long time ago, there was a big group of people living in a land called BG country. They always had to be careful because other groups of people wanted to take their land. One of those groups was from the BY country. The people from the BY country believed that the land of the BG country was theirs and they tried many times to take it. \n\nSo, the people of BG country had to always be ready. They watched their land all the time. If anyone tried to run away when they were supposed to be watching, they got in big trouble. Before they had a big fight, a really smart and trustworthy person would check all the things they needed for the fight. If someone wasn't ready or didn't take good care of their things, they also got in big trouble. It was also a big no-no to ride the horses they used in fights when it wasn't fight time.\n\nThe people of BG country had many different things to fight with, like big knives, axes, pointy sticks, sharp short sticks, and bows and arrows. They also knew how to use both the pointy sticks and the bows and arrows. To protect themselves, they wore special hats, special shirts, and carried round, light things to block attacks. The special hats were usually shaped like a cone and the blocking things were round and light. Long ago, people used two kinds of suits to protect themselves. One was made of small metal rings connected together, and the other was made of tiny plates of armor. They also liked to wear special belts with shiny buckles made of gold, silver, bronze, or copper.\n\nThe most important group in the army were the ones on horses, all wearing metal suits, even their horses had their own armor. These horse-riders were very important for protecting their home, which was in a big, open field. The home was protected by big ditches and the horse-riders could move quickly to keep it safe.\n\nThe army had smart ways to win fights. Sometimes, they would keep a group of horse-riders hidden and then surprise the enemy. Other times, they would pretend to run away and then turn around to fight the enemy. They even learned how to fight when it was dark out. Using these clever tricks, they were able to win many battles. A long time ago, there was a big group of people who were very clever. They used smart tricks to win battles without hurting anyone. One time, they sent five men with axes to a city called TH city. The men quietly removed the city guards and opened the city gates for their friends.\n\nThis group of people had lots of special tools to help them in battles. They got help from people who were good at making these tools, like a man named Ethan. Ethan ran away to their leader, Kevin, after his city was taken. They had big machines to throw rocks, tall towers with a big log at the bottom to hit gates, metal wagons to move things, and special hidden spikes to stop horses. They even had special bridges to cross rivers! Kevin once made 5,000 metal wagons for a big battle.\n\nBut they didn't just fight all the time. They also liked to farm, and they were very good at it. They had lots of good land to grow food. This was very important for them. Long ago, the people divided their place into two parts: one for the big boss, and one for everyone in the town. They grew a lot of wheat, rye, and millet, which are types of food that everyone ate. They also grew grapes and other fruits, and made clothes from a plant called linen. Sometimes, bad things like no rain or bugs could ruin the crops, and people wouldn't have enough to eat. To solve this, they kept extra food in a special place. They also had a lot of animals like cows, sheep, and horses. These animals were very important for farming, travel, and food.\n\nPeople also dug up special stuff from the mountains and made many things by hand. In the big town, they made things like jewelry, pottery, and tiles. Their tiles were even better than those from a far-off empire, so they sent them there and to another far-off place. In a place far away, we'll call it EB land, people made a lot of bricks. Some bricks had the special mark \"IYI\" on them. This could mean that the EB land was making these bricks in a big way. They also had special places where they got salt from, until another group, we'll call them the M people, took over those places. This salt was really important, so much so that when EB land was trying to make friends with another place, EF country, in a time long ago, the king of EF country asked EB land to stop sending salt to another place called GM land. \n\nTrading or swapping things with others was a big part of life in EB land. They were right in the middle of many different places like the BE empire, CE land, the R people, and the S lands. They had special rules for trading with the BE empire. These rules said that only things with a special stamp could be traded. If something didn't have this stamp, it was taken away for EB land's treasure box. The people from EB land who traded things even had a special place in the BE empire's big city and they didn't have to give a lot of their money away in taxes. \n\nBut, there was a time when the BE empire made things hard for the traders from EB land. They made them move their market to another city and made them pay more taxes. They also couldn't get stuff from the east easily. But after some time, EB land won a big fight and things went back to how they were before. In a land called BG country, there were many towns that were very rich. One of these towns, near a big river, was even richer than a big city in another land called RU country. This land, BG country, traded many things with other lands. They got shiny gold, smooth silk, tasty wine and sweet fruits from a land called BY country. They also got shiny silver and strong horses from lands called HU and BO country. From RU country, they got warm furs, sweet honey, wax and people who had to work for them. They also traded with IT country and lands in the Middle East.\n\nIn BG country, they didn't use coins like we do today. Instead, people paid taxes with things, not money. It's not clear if they paid taxes based on how much land they had, how many people were in their family, or both. On top of taxes, people also had to do other jobs like building roads and walls, and giving food and things to the soldiers. A writer from AR country noticed that instead of using money, people in BG country used cows and sheep to buy things.\n\nThere were a lot of towns in BG country. A man who studies how people used to live and work, named Paul, thought that in the year 800, the town of PL city had 30,000 people. Around the year 950, another town, PR city, had about 60,000 people. This made it the biggest town in all of Christian Europe, except for one called CO city. Compared to this, the biggest towns in FR and IT country had only 30,000 and 50,000 people. BG country had many big towns, which made it one of the most city-filled places in Christian Europe, just like IT country.Long ago, there were many towns near a big river. Some of these towns had two parts: an inside part and an outside part. The inside part had big walls and was where important things happened. The outside part was where people lived and worked. But mostly, people lived in the countryside. \n\nIn this old country, people believed in one god, who lived in the sky. The leader of the country was also the top priest and led special celebrations. There was a big place where people went to worship the sky god. People also believed in magic and did special rituals. \n\nOne of these rituals was written about by people from another country. The leader of the country had to do strange things like pour water on the ground, move horse saddles around, touch a special bridle, lift grass high above the ground, and use dogs in the ritual. People used to pour water to show that if promises were broken, something bad would happen. It's kind of like how they used to turn a saddle, which meant that if you broke a promise, you might fall off your horse! They even used a special bridle to show how serious the promise was. And if someone broke a promise, they believed it would harm their enemy's land. They also had a custom of offering dogs, which made their promises stronger.\n\nPeople used to believe in many different things. They thought there was a main god who controlled thunder and lightning. This god was the only one mentioned by an old writer who told stories about these people. They also believed in river spirits and other mystical beings. These beliefs are still remembered in some stories today. They even had special ceremonies where they would try to see the future.\n\nLater, they started following a new faith, which was already there during the old times. More people started following this new faith after a big victory in a war during the early 9th century. Cameron had many friends who were from different places. They helped him in many ways. Some of them were very important helpers. A lot of Cameron's friends moved to a new place to be safe and help keep their new home safe too. But some of them still had secret friends from their old home. This made the people in the new place feel uneasy and they didn't trust these friends. This led to some unhappy times.\n\nCameron and his friends were worried that these new friends were not good for their new place. They thought these friends might try to take over. This made Cameron and his friends feel threatened. So, they took some tough actions. Some of their new friends who caused problems were even sent away.\n\nThere were also different names on the list of those who caused problems. The way these friends acted towards the people in the new place was not nice. It hurt the feelings of Cameron and his friends. During a talk with one of these friends, Cameron said: \"Don't make fun of what we believe in. We are strong because we believe in it. See, we have taken over a big place.\"\n\nBut even after all this, some people still believed in their old ways. They continued to share their beliefs, even with Cameron's family. Long ago, there was a man named Ethan who was the oldest son of a big family. Ethan was different from his family because he believed in something called Christianity. His brother, Matthew, didn't like this, and so Ethan had to leave his family. Later, Ethan became a very good man that others looked up to.\n\nWhen it was time for a new leader, a man named Boris became in charge. Boris thought that everyone in his country should believe in Christianity, too. He thought that this would help his country be friends with other countries around them. This would also help him to be a good leader. Boris also thought that if everyone believed in the same thing, they could all get along better.\n\nBoris didn't want to learn about Christianity from the nearby BY Empire. Instead, he asked for help from a faraway place called EF. A man named Benjamin had a friendship with people from the EF country long ago. He knew that the big space between their countries made it hard for them to help with the church in his country, BG. He also knew that his next-door country might try to meddle in BG's business. In fact, the big country next door wanted to control BG's church because they thought it could help them control BG's choices. They also didn't want BG to help the big church boss in RO city to get what he wanted. When Benjamin learned about this, the big boss from the next-door country, Michael, started a fight with BG. At that time, BG's soldiers were already fighting with another country to the north-east. Benjamin decided to talk with them. The only thing they asked was for Benjamin to become a Christian from their country and to allow their church people to teach the people in BG. Benjamin agreed and became a Christian in 864, taking the same name as his godfather, Michael.\n\nIn the new church in BG, the top jobs were done by people from the next-door country who talked in a language called GR country. Benjamin knew that depending on the next-door country for spiritual things could risk BG's freedom. So, he tried to make sure that BG's church could be independent under a big church boss. But the people from the next-door country didn't want to give him what he wanted. So, Benjamin used the fight between the church in the next-door country and the big church in RO city to keep them from controlling his country through religion. Long ago, a very important man named Benjamin wanted to learn about Christianity. He sent a friend named Peter to RO city with 115 questions to ask a very wise man. This wise man, called Nathan, answered all of Benjamin's questions. He sent two helpers to teach Benjamin and his friends about Christianity.\n\nBut not everyone was happy about this. Some people didn't want to change the way they believed. They tried to stop Benjamin, but he wouldn't let them. He made sure everyone knew that they had to respect the new beliefs.\n\nWhen Benjamin decided to stop being the leader, his son Victor tried to bring back the old beliefs. But Benjamin didn't want this, so he stopped Victor.\n\nIn the end, Benjamin and his friends had their own special way to practice Christianity. They could do this because they had a special agreement with the leader of RO city. This made them very happy, because they could learn about Christianity in their own way. A long time ago, the leaders in a country decided that everyone should speak the same language, OL language. They asked all the people who spoke a different language to leave. So, all the helpers in the Church were from that country.\n\nThe next leader, Samuel, wanted more for the Church. He knew that if he wanted to be a big leader, he needed someone really important in the Church. After he won a big fight, he made Leontius, a very important person in the Church. \n\nBut, the people from another country didn't agree with this at first. However, after the big win in the fight, they agreed with the new important person, Daniel, in the Church. This was the first time something like this happened, apart from the very old times. It is thought that the important person in the Church lived in a city near a big river, not in the main city.\n\nIn the old times, the Church had many places under it. Some were in big cities, some were near rivers, and some were in different parts of the country.A long time ago, there was an important place in the east. But, when another group took over in 971, the leaders had to move to a place in the west we'll call OH city. Even when this place was taken over too, in 1018, the leaders remained important. They still got to choose other leaders and kept their office in OH city. Their leader, who we'll call Benjamin, kept his job. Also, this group had a special role - they answered directly to the emperor, not to the big leader in CO city.\n\nA lot of people started living in monasteries and they owned a lot of land with many people living on it. This became even more common when a leader we'll call Peter was in charge, and they got more land. Many important people, even those related to the leader, lived and died as monks, like Boris, his brother David, Peter, and a man we'll call Matthew. These monasteries became very rich, which made some monks want to live a simpler life. \n\nOne of these monks, who we'll call Jack, decided to live alone in the mountains. He was a good person and soon, other monks wanted to be like him. They started a famous monastery in the mountains after Jack passed away. Jack always talked about living peacefully and working hard. He also told the other monks not to want to be rich or powerful. Jack was a very kind man, liked by everyone, and became a special friend to all the people in his town. \n\nLong ago, people in his town began to make friends with people from another town far away. His town was a place where the few people from the faraway town learned about the town's customs and traditions. Because of a big event, many people from the faraway town learned about and liked the customs of Jack's town. These friendships between the people of Jack's town and the faraway town played a big part in the faraway town deciding to follow the same customs and traditions.\n\nDuring the time when King Peter was the leader, a new idea started in his town. This idea was started by a priest named Benjamin, whose name means \"beloved by God\". The main things we know about this new idea come from a letter by a big leader named Thomas, a book by a priest named Cameron, and a big meeting led by King Benjamin. This new idea was a belief that God had two sons, Jesus and Satan, and they represented good and evil. Long ago, there was a big light and a hidden world that were made by a powerful person. But there was also a not-so-nice person who made the dark, the world we live in, and us. Because of this, they said no to being married, having children, going to church, and other things. There were a group of people called the Bogomils. They were sorted into different groups. One group was called the \"perfect ones\". They didn't get married, they didn't eat meat or drink wine and they shared good stories. Even girls could join this group. The other groups were the \"believers\", who tried to be good like the Bogomils, and the \"listeners\", who didn't have to change how they lived. These Bogomils looked quiet and kind on the outside, but on the inside, they were not so nice. The big church in the BU country didn't like what the Bogomils were teaching. The people in charge didn't like them either because the Bogomils didn't follow the rules. But the Bogomils didn't go away. They moved to other places like the BY empire, the FR country, and the IT country. In the WE part of Europe, they were known by different names until the 14th century. \n\nBefore the people of BU country were called Bulgarians, there was already a place called BU country. Before BU country was formed, the Slavs had become friends with the Thracian people who lived there before. Long, long ago, many people lived together in a place we'll call BG country. They were from different groups, like the S people and B people. After many, many years, these groups started to talk the same way and live the same way. Some of the B people even started to use the S people's language.\n\nAround this time, the B people also started to follow a special belief. This helped them feel closer and more like one big family. They also began to use a new way of writing. All of these changes helped the B people become a strong and united group.\n\nBy the time a lot of years passed, all the people in BG country felt like they were part of the same big family. They shared the same beliefs, used the same language, and had the same way of living. These changes have lasted until today.\nLong ago, there was a special place known as the FB Empire. It was very important and had many beautiful things. This special place had two main cities, called the PL city and the PR city. These cities had many old and special things that people liked to look at. \n\nThere were also lots of old things in other places like the MD town, the SM town, and the NP town. Even in a small village called HK village, there were very old and beautiful things. These special things were also found in other countries like the RO country, the UA country, and the MD country. Some were even found in the MK country, the AL country, and the GR country.\n\nThere was a wise man named Cosmas who lived in this special place. He wrote about how the people in the FB Empire liked to read books and build special places called monasteries. From the things left behind, we can see that the FB Empire was a happy and rich place.\n\nLet's talk about how the cities looked. The first city, PL city, was very big and was like a giant camp. It was as long as 7km from east to west and around 4km from north to south. Around the city, there was a big trench that was about 12m wide at the top. Inside the city, it was about 740m long to the north and south, 788m long to the west, and 612m long to the east. There was a big, strong wall. The wall was as tall as 10 cats stacked on top of each other and as thick as 3 small cars side by side. The wall was made of big, carved blocks. There were four doors in the wall, each with two square towers for protection. The corners of the wall had round towers, and there were star-shaped towers between each corner and door tower.\n\nInside the wall, there was a big house where the king lived, along with houses for other important people. The king's house had baths, a pool, and a way to make the house warm. There were also places for people to stay, and many shops and places where people worked.\n\nThe people who lived there also built strong houses with walls around them. These were like mini castles. One of these mini castles was very similar to the big wall and had baths and was built with big, carved limestone blocks. \n\nThe people who studied this place found a broken statue of a lion. The statue was as tall as a small child. The statue was just like the one described in an old message: \"In the field, he [the king] built a mini castle at [the river]... and built a bridge at the river. He placed four columns and on top of the columns, he put two lions.\" \n\nThe same way of building was used in a fortress on an island, where the door was like the doors in the big wall, and in the mini castle. In a place far, far away, there was a big, strong castle on the side of a big mountain. This castle was special because it sat between the places where people dug for salt and the lands below a big river. The castle was built in a very special way, just like other castles.\n\nIn the same faraway place, there was a second big city that was as big as 50 football fields. It was shaped like a funny five-sided shape and was split into an inside part and an outside part. A very important man named Samuel wanted this city to be as grand as another big city. Inside this city, there were two big houses that were connected. Not much of the pretty decorations are left now, just some fancy stone plates and two big, green stone pillars that were probably near the king's chair. This whole big place was even bigger than the other castle and was surrounded by a wall with a bath near the bottom wall. A big road made of stones connected the northern door and the big houses and made a big open space in front of it. The outside part of the city had homes, churches, special schools, workshops and places to live. Next to the outside part of the southern doors of the inside city, there was a big shop with 18 rooms for selling things on the first floor and rooms for staying in on the second. The most common shape of the shops, places for making things and houses was a rectangle, with the first floor used for making things and the second one for living. Some of the buildings had fancy stone or clay tile floors, and others had porches on the second floor. Long ago, people built special pipes out of hard stones or clay to bring water from the mountains to their homes. \n\nWhen everyone started following a special belief, they began building many special buildings called churches and monasteries. Some of these buildings were built on top of older buildings. These new buildings changed the look of the cities and fortresses. The building of these special places was helped by the kingdom and also by rich folks, who gave a lot of money for this. One of the first such places built was a big church. It was one of the biggest buildings of that time and it was the longest church in all of Europe. This church was very long, about as long as a soccer field. The church was split into two big parts - a big open space and the main building.\n\nDuring the rule of a king, a new kind of church building started to be built. This kind of church had a dome on top and was shaped like a cross. The city was filled with many such churches and many monasteries. The churches were decorated with special clay, shapes, and many beautiful forms. The best example of these churches was a round church. It was round with a dome on top and had two levels of columns inside. It also had a walled open space with special spots and columns. The style of the church was inspired by the styles of other places. There were also many caves that people turned into homes, like the MR Cave Homes. People found wall pictures and letters carved into stone in these caves. \nIn the KW area, a man named Cameron built a big house for prayers called SP House, and two round-shaped houses in the late 900s. In 900, another big house for prayers called SN House was built with the help of a kind leader named Michael and his son, Samuel. This was built near a big lake about 30km south of the town. It was a place where many books were written. They also built other important buildings like the SS House in OH city and the SA House on an island in PR Lake. Both were as big as 30 by 50m and looked like the big GB House in PL city. These buildings had three halls and three rounded rooms. There are still some buildings from that time that show how rich and settled the BR culture was. These include three small houses from the late 900s or early 1000s in KT and a house in the village of GR (both now in GR country).\nThe most special art from that time is the MR Rider, a big picture carved in stone by a leader named Thomas after he won a big battle in 705. There's a special picture carved into a tall cliff in a place we'll call MA country. It shows a man riding a horse, a lion, and a dog, all high up on the cliff. The man on the horse is holding a stick and it looks like he's trying to poke the lion, while the dog is running behind him. The picture has been there for a very long time and it's a bit hard to see some parts of it because the cliff has been worn away over time.\n\nThis picture is very special and unique, and we aren't really sure what it's supposed to mean or where the idea to make it came from. Some people think it might be showing a story from long ago, about a brave horseman from MA country. Others think it might be about a famous hero from a faraway place. Some even believe it might be a picture of a god or a very powerful being. But no one really knows for sure.People long ago were very good at making things from stone. They used stone to make buildings and decorations. They found a lot of these decorations in a place we'll call PR city. These decorations had pictures of animals like big birds and rabbits, and plants like leaves. They even found shapes of lions and lionesses in one of the churches in PR city.\n\nPeople also made things to use at home. They made these things from clay and baked them in big ovens. They found these clay things in places we'll call NP town, DV town, and VA city. The clay things looked like things found in far away lands like the CR peninsula and the shores of the big AZ sea. \n\nWhen they started talking and trading more with people from the BY empire, they started making their clay things look even better. They made new shapes and decorations that no one in the SL world had seen before.\n\nOne of the coolest things they did in PR city was decorate their buildings with shiny ceramic plates. This might be because they saw people from the NE land doing it. They made these plates from white clay, also known as kaolin. Long ago, in a place called PR city, people made beautiful tiles. They painted pretty patterns, plants, and even birds on the tiles. Some even had pictures of kind, wise people. These tiles were used to build important buildings and were sent to many different places. People in a city called KI liked these tiles and used them too. \n\nSadly, many of these tiles broke over time. But, we still have some pieces left. One special piece shows a brave hero, found in an old building near PR city. People used these pretty tiles a lot in PR city and other nearby places.\n\nA long time ago, people wanted to have their own way of writing. They were using words from a different place, which made it hard for everyone to understand. Then, two wise men made a new way of writing just for them. This was ordered by a powerful man who wanted to share his beliefs with a big place called GM country. Long ago, there were two brothers who spoke a special language. This language was called Old Church language by people who studied it later. It was based on a local language spoken in a place called TH city. But, the brothers' mission to share this language in a place called GR country didn't work out. \n\nIn 886, their friends, Cameron, Nathan, and Adam, who had to leave GR country, came to BU country. They were welcomed warmly by Ben. They started to share the language in BU country, which helped to keep the work of the brothers alive. \n\nBen, who was the leader of BU country, asked them to start two schools. These schools were for teaching the future leaders of BU country in their local language. Cameron was sent to a place in the southwest called KU place in MA country. He started the OH school there. He taught 3,500 students between 886 and 907. \n\nNathan started a school in the capital city, PL city. But later, the school was moved to the new capital, PR city. After a while, Nathan was also sent to OH city. \n\nThe reason they started schools far from the capital was because a very important person from BY country was still living in PL city. Late in the 9th century or early in the 10th century, they created a new way of writing called Cyrillic at the PR school. It was based on the letters used in GR country and had some new ones for sounds not found in the GR language. They added 14 new letters to the 24 existing ones. Long ago, a new way of writing spread across many lands. Today, lots of people in many parts of the world use this way to write their own languages. People used this new way of writing to translate important books about different subjects like history, geography and religion. It helped them keep their own unique identity and not become too much like their neighbors. \n\nIn the court of a very important person named S, there were many smart people. These smart people translated lots of books and wrote new ones. One of these smart people was C, who wrote a very important piece about the new way of writing. He said that this new way of writing was not just good, but better than the old way. He explained that it was not the first or the most divine, but it was the best for them. He said that even before this, people used different letters to write their speech. Two friends, Cameron and Jack, loved to write and share stories. They took ideas from faraway lands and made them their own. Jack wrote a story called \"The Six-Day Adventure\" that told exciting tales about the BG kingdom under the rule of a king named Samuel. Cameron's special story was the \"Teaching Tale,\" the first story that had lessons and teachings in the Slavic language. It even had a beautiful poem at the beginning, the first ever poem in the BU country language.\n\nThen, there was another writer, named Cosmas. He wrote a story called \"Talk Against the Wrongdoers\" that did not just have lessons about right and wrong, but also talked about the world around them, especially about people's beliefs and how they lived.\n\nThere were also other stories, called secret stories, that became popular after the BT kingdom took over the BG kingdom. There was a special story called \"Story of the Special Tree\" written by Jeremiah that talked about the hopes and fears of the BU country people. But not everyone liked this story and it was not allowed by the Big Church.\n\nDuring this time, many stories were written and many different types of stories were tried. This made the language used in these stories richer and more interesting. These stories, written in the Old BU country language, traveled far and wide and became the common language of the BK and Eastern EU lands. These BU country writers and their stories had a big influence on many lands and peoples, including the lands of RU, SB, CR, WL, and MD. Long ago, there was a busy time that stopped quickly when a new group took over a place called BU country. For the next 150 years, this new group got rid of all the old stories written in the language of BU country. None of the stories from the old times stayed in BU country. The only ones that are still around were copied and made again in a faraway place, mostly in RU country.\n\nThere were many big books about the history of BU country, but they were written in a different language. These books were made a long time ago. But they are not here anymore. A long time ago, there were many important books. One book was about history, written in two different languages. This book was created by smart people in a place called BG country. There was another book about leaders, written by Adam and Jack. This book was made in a place known as VT city. Another book talked about people in old times, written by Adam, Isaac, and Patrick. This book was made by someone named Peter. There was another book about how a group of people became a community, written by David. This book was from a place called SF city. There was also a book about the history of a place. All these books were very important a long time ago. This is a story about a place called BG country. Many people who lived there wrote about its history. Some of the people who wrote about BG country were named Adam, Benjamin, Cameron, David, Ethan, Frank, Gabriel, Henry, and Isaac. Some others were named Jessica, Katherine, Lily, Madison, and Nora. They wrote about BG country a long time ago, in the late 20th century.\n\nThere were also some books written about BG country. One of the books was written by a man named Gabriel. This book told the story of BG country from a very long time ago until a time many years ago. Some other people who helped Gabriel write this book were named Patrick, Adam, Thomas, Kevin, and Ethan.\n\nAnother book was written by Gabriel too. This book was all about the history of BG country. Another man named Matthew also helped Gabriel write this book.  This is a story about a man named Kevin. He liked to read a lot of books. One day, he read a book about the history of a place called BU country. He learned many things from the book. For example, he found out about the old times in BU country, from the 7th to the 14th centuries. \n\nKevin also read another book. This book was about different people and places in Europe a long time ago. He learned about groups of people like the Avars, Bulgars, Khazars, and Cumans. \n\nReading these books made Kevin very happy because he learned a lot. He liked finding out about different places and people from long, long ago. There were many books written about history. One book talks about history from a long time ago to about 800 years ago. It was written by a man named Jack. Another book also talks about history, but from 500 years ago to 700 years ago. The book was published by a big book company. There's also a second book in the series that tells the story from 700 years ago to 900 years ago. \n\nThen, there's a book written by a man named Peter. This book is about the story of people from a long time ago in different parts of the world. Lastly, there's a book about another part of history, written by a man named Timothy and another book written by a man named Jack. Here is a list of some important books about old times. These books talk about different places and people long time ago. One book is about a big place and its people from 565 to 1204. Another book is a big dictionary about a place called Byzantium. There's also a book about how the lands of a place called BU city were a long time ago. Another book talks about different countries in Eastern Europe from 500 to 1453. The last book is about the history of the First BU country Empire. A long time ago, there were many important books written about a far away place. One was about a powerful leader and his time ruling a big country. It was written by a man named Steven. Another book was about two countries and was written by a man named Panos. Yet another book was about the history of a region, written by a man named Paul. There was also a book in a different language, written by a man named Stefan, about important events. Lastly, there was a book about the birth of a big country, written by a man named Mark. Victor wrote some important books about the history of a certain country during the old times. He wrote two big books about this history. The first book was about the early history of the country. The second book was about the later history. Both books were written in the language of BR country. Other people, like Alice, Benjamin, and Frank, also wrote books about the same period. All these books help us learn about the old times. A man named Frank wrote about the history of a language that people spoke a long time ago. Another man named Oliver made a map of a big place called the \"EU land\" during a time when knights and castles were common. A man named George and a woman named Olivia wrote about two places near big rivers. \n\nJack, another man, wrote a book about a place called \"BU country\" when it was changing a lot. A man named Robert wrote a short story about the history of \"BU country\" and later wrote another book just about \"BU country\". \n\nA man named Denis wrote about the old history of a big place in the east. A man named Christopher wrote about many kingdoms that were along a famous road where people traded things a long time ago. A very old book by Adam and Benjamin tells us about a people called the Thracians from a long time ago. Another website says that the name of the BU country comes from the Bulgars. But people are not sure where the Bulgars came from or how they changed the BU country's people and language. A different book by Patrick talks about the BU country and the BY empire a long, long time ago. There are many old stories by different writers like Samuel, Thomas, and Liam, kept by the BA of Sciences in the SO city, that tell us more about this.\nThere were many books and writings at a big school in a place called BU city. Some were by a person named Kevin, and some by a person named Paul. Paul wrote a book about cities and how they grow. Another book was by a man named Nathan, about the history of places long, long ago. There was also a book about a famous horseman by a man named Slavi. You could also find information about the horseman on a special website. In a book by a man named Slavi, he talks about a horseman from a place called MA. Another man named Hugh asks who the people from a place called MA are. Then, a man named Alexander writes about the start of a language called Slavic. And finally, a man named Benjamin talks about language and culture. This story comes from a big online encyclopedia.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "d0247b1d185c9c91082cecf7c4ee86cad12d8e1da9ad880aa1e639b9580e0a91"}
{"text": "A big airplane company in the HK city is making its cool storage bigger so it can hold a lot of medicine every day. The countries are starting to say yes to the new medicine that can help people not get sick. Right now, the airplane company can hold about 7.1 million doses of medicine. But with a new cool storage room, it can hold 1.5 million more, said the big boss of the company, Thomas.\n\nAirplane companies that had a hard time because of the sickness are getting ready to help give out the medicine. This will help them a lot. The big boss, Thomas, said that they are one of the biggest cargo carriers in the world. They have 20 special cargo airplanes and lots of space in passenger airplanes to help give out the medicine.\n\nThe airplane company is also using a new way to keep track of the medicine. It's called Ultra Track and it lets people see how the medicine is doing in real-time. They will let people use this new service for free for any medicine shipments from all the places where they make the medicine, said Thomas.\nA tool called \"Ultra Track\" uses a special signal to keep track of where it is, how warm or cold it is, and if it is shaking or wet. This happens at the same time it's happening. \nEvery year, more than half of shots for sickness get thrown away because they get too hot or cold, or because it's hard to get them where they need to go.\nRight now, it's really important to get a special shot to lots of people quickly. But it's hard to do this. This problem is actually good for companies that make tools like \"Ultra Track\". These tools help make sure the shots get from the place they're made to the people who need them.

{"text": "There was a big meeting in a place called the 'ST building'. At this meeting, a man named 'Jack' talked about some important things. He said he wants more helpers at the borders and wants to be friends with a place called 'AF country'. Other people at the meeting, let's call them 'helpers', also spoke up. They said a place called 'HU country' was not following rules and they were not happy about it. Before they decided what to do, a man named 'Victor' said that the helpers were not being nice to his home, 'HU country'. The helpers also talked about changing some rules about sharing things. Lastly, they finished talking about a problem with medicine. They will decide what to do about it the next day.\nWe are done for today...The helpers will come back early in the morning. They will talk about how to safely use bug sprays in FR country after a big talk last year about a certain plant spray. They will also talk about making sure food tastes the same everywhere in FR country. \n\nAdam, a health helper, says that very tough bugs that don't get sick from medicine are a big problem for everyone's health around the world. Lots of people in FR country get sick from these tough bugs every year, he says. He says the new plan from FR country to fight these tough bugs is very good. He promises to look at the report, which he says has many good ideas. \n\nThe helpers are now talking about another report from the environment helpers, this time they are talking about making it harder to sell certain medicines. The report says that FR country and the helpers should work to reduce reasons to give out antibiotics, and calls for their use on animals to be stopped.\nFor a long time, special medicines have been used to make people better when they are sick from tiny bugs called bacteria. But these medicines are not working as well as they used to. This is partly because they are used a lot on farms. It's important to save some of these medicines for people, so they can work well for as long as possible.\n\nPeople are worried about the waste from plastic stuff. A lot of the plastic packaging is thrown away and this is a waste. If people keep throwing away plastic, it doesn't make sense. \n\nThere's a plan to have a tax on plastic waste. If the tax is agreed on, it will help. But if it's not, each country should have their own solution.\n\nThere's a man from FR country who says it's not fair to make people feel bad about plastic waste. He says that stopping the use of things like plastic straws won't fix the problem. He thinks that companies should be responsible and change the way they make things.\n\nAnother man says that the way people in Europe use plastic is not good and can't continue.\nOur big land is making lots of plastic trash every year, and it's not good for our world, says a man. We used to send our trash to a faraway place, but we can't do that anymore. So now, we need to think of ways to reuse our plastic trash. \n\nPeople are talking about a plan to help us use less plastic. This plan says we should make sure all our plastic packages can be used again by the year of \"when most of you grow up\". They also want to stop tiny pieces of plastic in makeup and cleaning stuff by the year of \"when your little brother or sister starts school\". And they want to make new rules about how we can turn trash into dirt that's good for plants. \n\nPeople are also talking about how to keep our personal information safe. There are special rules for how to do this, but they need to be updated. They want to make sure our information is as safe as possible.\nPeople are checking if everyone is playing fair. They are from a big team called the European Data Protection Supervisor. Some people have agreed on new rules and will decide if they like them tomorrow. A place called HU country is in trouble with the big team. People think HU country is not following the rules. \n\nA person named Jean, who leads a team about money, says it's normal for governments to want to cut money from plans made by the big team. He thinks the money for next year should match what the big team wants to do. He wants to focus on learning more things. \n\nJean also says there is a need for enough money for a student program. He says that more than half of the people who want to join can't because there's not enough money. \n\nA person named Gunther, who is in charge of the money, says the money for next year will be normal because the UK country has agreed to keep their promise. He is happy about this. He thinks it's important to give money to a fund for learning more things. He also wants the big team to spend at least a small part of their money on learning. \n\nBut, he promises that the big team will be careful about how they spend money on running things. They will follow what the team members want in this area.\nAdam, a money helper from AU country, spoke about big money plans for a group of countries working together. He said these plans mean the group will use 3% more money than they did last year.\n\nAdam shared that this is a bigger jump than what many countries, including his own, have planned for their money next year. This made starting talks tricky.\n\nThe plan, liked by many countries, still says that they will use over 2% more money - putting more into things like power systems, learning and other stuff. But, Adam said, there is a need to keep a check on the money used for running things.\n\nOther money helpers are now talking about the plans for next year's big money spend of the group of countries. They suggested that the group should use 148bn during 2019 on ongoing projects, with promises to spend 164bn in the future.\n\nThese big numbers are larger than this year's money plan, but would be a cut from the first plan made by the group in May.\n\nIn July, the money helpers asked for the money for a student swap program to be \"at least doubled\", and for the money for helping people move to be kept at a good level.\n\nThe money helpers will now discuss with country leaders on the final version of the money plan, which they plan to agree on before the year ends.\n\nAlso, the group of countries agreed on changes to rules about who owns what. This happened even though some big tech companies from the US and a musician didn't want the new rules.\nA member from FR country shares his worries about many people's jobs today. He thinks these jobs might make it hard for them to get their pensions when they get old. Another member, Thomas, believes that some pension plans in NE city were really good before they were changed by a past leader. He thinks some pension plans are not getting enough money, and the pension in NE city is not as good as in other places around the world.\n\nIn other news, the EU wants to work more on trading and building partnerships with AF country, instead of focusing on problems and giving help.\n\nAfter lunch, the members have another discussion about the pension systems in the EU. Rachel from PT country thinks the pension plans in Europe are facing some tough problems, like people not having enough money when they get old and more people getting old. But she also thinks that if we manage it well, letting more people move to Europe could help make these pension plans better in the future.\n\nAnother member, Uma, feels that the private pension plans have been hurt by the low amount of money they can get from the bank. She thinks this is because of what the big bank in Europe is doing.\nBig Web Meeting\nIn a big meeting, some people agreed that big internet companies should make sure that pictures, videos, or stories shared by people using their websites don't break any rules. They need to have agreements with those who own the pictures, videos, or stories, especially if people are sharing these for their own business. Some people don't like this because they think it will make internet companies check everything that people put online, which might stop people from sharing their thoughts freely. \n\nThere was also talk about a rule that makes internet companies pay news companies if they share their stories. This is a big talking point because some people think it's like a tax for sharing links to stories. The people in the meeting agreed that news companies should get a fair payment if their stories are shared online.\n\nThey also talked about how this rule should not stop people from sharing news stories for their own use or if they're not making money from it. But, this rule would only last for five years after the story was first published, not 20 years like what was first suggested. \n\nThe people in the meeting are not sure what will happen because of these new rules.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "c3f63b27e01c75bce73a7f852da695de233aaafbef04ec7a13f202fc793674d0"}

There is also a spooky graveyard and an old hospital nearby. The school likes to have fun parties during the year, especially during the dress-up holiday. The school in OH state is so big that more than 23,000 children study there. But there are also more than 10,000 children who learn from other places that the school owns. Some children even learn from home on their computers. A famous list said this school is one of the best schools in AM city. The school is also known for helping children learn how to be teachers. Many people think that the school named OH University is one of the best schools around. OH University is a special kind of school. It's been told by a group that checks schools that all of the things you can learn at OH University are good. This is true for all the things you can learn at the school's main place, and for the things you can learn on your computer at home. \n\nIf you're thinking about going to OH University, you might want to check if the thing you want to learn has an extra special check. OH University has extra special checks for some things you can learn, like building things, helping people feel better, talking with people, understanding how to move and exercise better, understanding how families work, helping people who can't hear or talk well, helping people with their feelings, helping people who can't move well, and teaching others.\n\nOH University also has a special way for kids who are still in school to start learning things that you usually learn in college. If you've done this before, you'll need to show OH University a special paper from the other college you learned from. They will only accept the things you've learned that are listed on an official paper. To study at OU school, you need to show them your report cards from earlier school years. Most students who get in have good marks on big tests. The school says yes to more than 7 out of 10 students who want to join. Most of these students studied a lot of English, math, science, and social studies in school. They also learned about art and a different language.\n\nTo apply, you can use a special form that can be sent to many schools at once, or you can send a form just to OU school. The form will ask about all the schools you've been to, your mom and dad's names, where you live, and what you like to do when you're not in school. When the form is done, you also have to send your test scores and report cards.\n\nIf you live in OH state and go to the OU school in AT city, you pay some money for each class you take. If you take many classes at once, you pay less. You pay more if you take extra classes. If you live outside of OH state, you pay more money for each class. If you take classes on the computer, it costs less. This is true even if you live outside of OH state. Some lessons in some schools can be pricey. Even if you learn from home on a computer, you still need to pay for other little things, like pencils and books. There's also some money you need to spend on yourself. The school suggests you fill out a form before summer starts, but doing it sooner might be better. Depending on how much your family can help you, you could get some money from the state or the country, or even borrow some. The school also has a program where you can work and study at the same time if you live close to it. They also have some rewards for current and new students. If you borrow money, you need to talk to the school before and after you finish your studies.\n\nThe school also has lessons that you can take on the computer. It started with a program for students who wanted to learn from home. The school later added a few more lessons on the computer and then created a program for learning online. They have seven programs that you can completely do on the computer, and one of them is very special. It teaches students how to be good at helping people. This lets students get a degree in Helping People. This program is part of the school's College of Learning. It helps students get ready to work in jobs where they manage things and help people.\n\nStudents need to finish 120 lessons, including some basic ones that the school requires. You need to take at least 16 lessons about helping people, which will include lessons about working with people, families as customers, and getting better at your job. The school lets you learn a lot from one or more special jobs and from workshops where you learn how to help people. They also want you to learn about getting along with different people, doing the right thing, and how to lead others. At OU school, you can learn about planning big events, making smart choices in a shop, how to talk in front of people, how to talk in a group, and how to tell people about things you're selling.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "d6b47a08b4d657cf3751cdfa73b89db518f42dc16e3888e4120dae32b398871f"}

In the past, a special van was made into a place where people could talk about their lives, and this van went on a trip across the country. Every year, this van travels to different parts of the country to record the chats between people who live there. We work with local radio stations and other groups to let people know about this and invite them to come.\n\nIn 2020, the van started visiting places in a new way, by recording conversations from far away. But we're happy to say that we'll start having people record their stories in person again, beginning with a stop in a city called 'WI city'. \n\nUpcoming Dates for the Van's Visits\nKeep an eye on our notes for when and where you can register to record your story.

And finally, we'll end our trip in the TX city during the winter holidays.\n\nWhile we're on this trip, we'll be meeting lots of new friends and hearing exciting stories. Some people might tell us about how they pretended to be very tough. Others might share about the times they wished they could help someone more.\n\nWe want everyone to join us on this fun journey. That's why we're teaming up with some great groups in each city. These groups help us meet different kinds of people and hear their special stories. This is all free and we can listen to stories in any language!\n\nIf your group is in one of the cities we're visiting and you want to learn more, send us a note at m@ourtrip.com.\n\nWe've already had some really fun visits with groups in FL city, SD city, MI city, and NV city.

But now, the first of many easy-to-clean, wheelchair-friendly restrooms is set to open this week in a big park. It will cost people a small amount of money to use for a short time before the restroom doors open by themselves. After each use, it will clean itself for a minute. This important restroom is the first of many to be introduced by a big company from another country, which was chosen many years ago to put in the restrooms, as well as new bus stops and newsstands over several years.

{"text": "Good work, everyone on the internet! A man we know as Nathan is saying things we're all thinking and making it seem very important. This is a story from Katherine.\n\nEvery day, it's getting harder to tell where Nathan the actor ends and his character, Ron, begins. This might be because Nathan doesn't want to let down his fans, who love him so much they even draw pictures of him. Or maybe that's just how Nathan is. He does have his own place where he works with wood and he wrote a book about how to live your life.\n\nWhatever the reason, it's working for him. Recently, he was in a video for a place called MA website, called 'Simple Smart Thoughts with Nathan'. The things he says in the video are from a place on the internet where people share their everyday thoughts, like \"when you're really smart, every meeting you go to feels like a doctor's visit\" and \"if you think about it, we're all a little bit like mythical creatures\". When Nathan says these things, they sound less like silly thoughts and more like something really wise, as if he was a very wise man who loves to eat all kinds of food.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "c82a272af27e825301a219ae8798d6701d144e95d06e2a072d3be63b65a886a4"}

{"text": "Let's learn about a place called HV Island. HV Island is a very liked island on the DC Coast. People say it's the sunniest and greenest of all the islands in CR Country. You can get to HV Island by a big boat from mainland SP city or MK city. HV Island has beautiful beaches and fun places to walk and bike. It is also known for its yummy seafood.\n\nHV Town is where most visitors go. It's an old town with big walls around it built a long, long time ago. Famous people from Europe like to visit and park their big boats in the harbor. There are also other lovely places to visit on HV Island. SG Town is a peaceful port town. Quiet fishing villages like J Town and V Town are nice to visit too. PI Islands are not far and are also liked by visitors. There are big fields of lavender flowers, vineyards and hidden rocky beaches all around these places.\nThere are special places near the coast of a country called HR. There, you can find lots of small islands with beautiful beaches and clear blue water. The islands are full of lovely trees and plants. In the summer, many people like to visit these islands because they are peaceful and fun. One of the islands, called SK island, has some tiny villages. These villages have pretty houses, gardens, and places to eat right by the beach. There's even a small place where you can learn about how people live on the islands. \nThere's another special place called HV town. Above this town, there is an old castle built a long time ago. The castle has been through a lot. It helped protect the people of the town from bad guys and even survived a big fire caused by lightning. Today, the castle still stands and people think it's one of the best things to see in HV town.\nThere is a big castle on top of a hill. To get there, you have to climb up many stairs and walk through a path with beautiful flowers and plants. The walk is long and not easy, but when you reach the top, you can see the whole town, the harbor, and even some islands far away. There's also a nice place to rest and drink something at the castle.\n\nIn the middle of the town, there's a big open area with a church. The church has been there for a long time, since the time of your great-great-grandparents. Inside the church, there are pretty things to see like paintings and wooden seats. But what people remember the most is how it looks from the outside. It has a special roof and a tall tower that you can see from far away. The open area in front of the church goes all the way to the sea.\n\nA long time ago, there was a small village near the town. But the people who lived there decided to move closer to the sea, so now the village is empty. Long ago, there was a quiet village, HV village, hidden in a valley with hills and fields all around. Now, no one lives there. For many years, nature has been taking over the village. Trees grow where houses used to be, and the sun shines through holes in the old roofs. Flowers grow everywhere. Most of the people who used to live in the village now live in MI town by the sea. But one man, Mr. Benjamin, came back. He fixed up the house where his family used to live, and now he runs a restaurant there that serves traditional food from HV village.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "a527f02eae52b7af091c1bd64e4efd43a2ed23911a3a7fa8e2f59fd4f89b8243"}
{"text": "There's a helpful guide about the best story, movie, and song shows you can listen to, made by the DC newspaper. A man named Michael, from 'The Daily', talked at North Gate Hall about how they make news into something you can listen to. The McElroy brothers, who host a show, made everyone laugh in SF city. The people who made 'Serial' talked at ZH Hall.\n\nListening to shows is not just for a few people now. Today, there is a show for everyone and about everything you can think of, from talking about leaders to how we live to stories told one part at a time. There are many shows about art that can make all your listening wishes come true.\n\nWith the DC newspaper's art & fun department starting a new show, \"Popcorn Paperback,\" in October, it's a great time to learn about shows you can listen to. Here is the DC's guide to some of the best art shows you might not know about.\n\n\"Overdue\" is a show \"about the books you've wanted to read.\" Each week, the hosts, Cameron and Adam, talk about a book -- one of them reads the book of the week, and the other asks questions. The books they talk about on the show are all kinds, from old to new stories, from all types of books, and even plays and books for kids. There's a fun thing where people talk about all sorts of books. Some books are like \"Little Mouse Adventures\" or \"Night Story.\" They make the books sound exciting and interesting. It's fun to listen, even if you haven't read the book. The people talking are funny and it feels like they're your friends.\n\nThere's another fun thing called \"NY Story Time.\" At NY Story Time, authors read their own short stories out loud. These authors could be new or very famous. This makes the stories special because you get to hear them from the people who wrote them. \n\nEvery week, \"Talking with Thomas\" has a special guest who is a book writer. They talk about how they write their books and other fun things about writing. Thomas is also a writer, so he knows a lot about it. This makes their talks really interesting, even if you don't know who the writer is.\nAdam and Josh are friends who love to talk about movies. They have a show where they talk about a new movie each time, and then they list their top five things related to that movie. For example, when they talked about a movie about a hard job, they also made a list of the five hardest jobs in other movies. People who love movies will enjoy how Adam and Josh really think about each movie and topic they talk about. \n\nThere is another show that just finished, all about different types of people. It's hosted by Alice, and she talks about movies and TV shows made by or about women, people who are different colors, people who love differently, and people who can't do everything others can. Alice often invites other movie makers or people who know a lot about movies to talk with her about these new shows and movies. Sometimes, they also talk about a movie or TV show they liked when they were little, but now they think about it differently. Everyone who listens to the show finds it interesting and fun.\n\nThere is another show called \"How Did This Get Made?\" It's all about movies that aren't very good. The friends who host it, June, Paul, and Jack, all talk about these not-so-good movies. Sometimes, they invite a new friend to join them and talk about the movie. Some people like to have fun by talking about funny stories in different films. They look at films like one about a scary tornado, one about a big planet, and one about a strange beast. These talks are very fun and also give interesting facts about these odd films.\n\"Rock Music Chat\"\nThis chat is like a famous music book but you can listen to it instead of reading it. The people who know a lot about music talk about what's happening in music and also have chats with musicians. They talk about big ideas in music, like how music has changed over time. Every chat is different but all are based on strong ideas, which makes it fun to listen to every time.\nIn \"Song Stories,\" hosted by a man named Henry, musicians talk about how they made their songs. Each chat is about one song and the musician who made it. Hearing musicians talk about their own songs gives a special look into songs you might know very well, or songs you haven't heard yet.\n\"Song Study\"\nIn this chat, a man named Cameron spends a whole season talking about one album. He talks about one song in each chat and looks closely at each part of the song. In the first part, we learned about songs from Adam's, Kevin's, and Frank's music. The show called \"Details\" takes us right into the middle of the songs they're talking about.\n\nJessica talks about plays and shows on the radio. You can reach her at j@workplace.com.\n\nMany people like Adam, Alice, Andrew, Benjamin, Charlotte, Cole, Craig, David, Ethan, Frank, Henry, Isabel, Jack, Jeffrey, Josh, June, Kevin, Liam, Matthew, Nathan, Oliver, Paul, Ryan, Samuel, Thomas, Victor, William, and Zachary talk about songs, movies, and books. Some of the things they talk about are funny movies, music, and famous books.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "3aa7aa211e6bd512c9973d4177277f4c080620a9b86a78e343778d0772c7be5a"}

{"text": "A big problem right now is that there's not enough helpers at the local hospitals. Jessica, a helper at the hospital, says many workers are feeling very tired because of the sickness that's been going around.\n\nWhen Jessica started working at the hospital, many people were coming in because they were sick. Jessica, who is 23, was asked to help take care of these sick people. \n\nJessica likes helping people, but she also says it's been very hard sometimes. She's had to work for many hours, sometimes even the whole day. She's had days where she had to take care of people who were very sick and even some who didn't make it. Also, the hospital doesn't have enough workers, so this makes the ones who are still there want to leave more.\n\nJessica says, \"We have so many people who are leaving. Some are going to other places because they pay more, or they're leaving because they need a break. They're feeling too much with everything that's been happening at the hospital.\"\n\nThe problem of not enough hospital workers isn't only at this hospital. It's happening at hospitals everywhere and it's not just the helpers, but also the doctors and nurses. \n\nThis has been a problem for a long time, but it's become bigger because of the sickness going around. At a time when we need hospital workers the most, many are feeling very tired, says Staci, a big boss at the hospital.\n\"Health care has been struggling for about 10 years, and it's only getting tougher,\" says Thomas. \"The big sickness really wore out the health care helpers. It's the biggest helper shortage we've ever seen.\"\nFarm work had been lacking helpers for a long time: The big sickness brought new problems.\nBy a time far in the future, the US might not have enough doctors, says a big group of colleges.\nThe number of people and their age matters a lot. More people are being born and they are living longer, so more doctors for older people are needed. At the same time, many doctors are getting old and might stop working.\nIn the WA state, there's a shortage of special doctors, says Alice, a special doctor and a teacher at a big college in the state. The state is not doing well in having enough of these special doctors, according to the big group of colleges.\nAlice says that this is a big problem and it means some people, especially in faraway places, don't have good health care.\n\"If you are told you have a big sickness, where do you go for help and is it good help?\" Alice says. \"You might have to go to a place that has many patients, and those places are not many, especially on the other side of the hills.\"\nKevin is hopeful because many students in his school want to become doctors, which is more than in other schools. These students are helping in hospitals in WA state where more doctors are needed. They are seeing how important this is, says Kevin.\n\nWe also need a lot more truck drivers in our country, and we are starting to understand how much we depend on them.\n\nFor people who help take care of others, like nurses, there has been a shortage for a long time. Some people have suggested paying them more to solve this problem. They note that a nurse working at a hospital can quit and become a traveling nurse, moving around to different hospitals, and earn more money.\n\nBut, because hospitals have to pay more for these traveling nurses, they might have less money to hire new doctors, Kevin says. \n\nHealth care systems know this is an issue. Matthew, a manager at a hospital, says that traveling nurses can help when there are not enough nurses because of retirements or other changes. But, they hope to keep more of their own nurses.\n\nIt's not just about paying them more, he says. While competitive pay and benefits are very important to keep a good workforce, Matthew says, other employers can increase their pay to match each other, so it won't solve the shortage of workers.\n\nBoth hospitals have offered extra money for hiring, wage increases, or bonuses to keep their workers. But, they also say it's important to make the hospital a good place for employees in other ways. Taylor shares that a certain place is making sure those who look after others can rest, can easily get help if they feel sad, and have money help and support for looking after their kids. \nJust like that, Allore says a certain place tries to have a nice place to work along with programs to help their workers. \n\"When you feel too tired, you lose all your energy and love for your job,\" says Allore. \"We need to help them in a way that lets them keep helping our community in a good way.\"\nThree local helper groups wonder why it's getting harder to find new helpers. \nBeing sick may have affected not the doctors and nurses, but the people who help them, says Kumar. That includes those who write down codes, plan schedules and help nurses. And that affects how patients are cared for, too.\n\"I may want to do many checkups and operations, but we may not have enough people to help,\" says Kumar.\nA rule about taking a shot has made work harder, with a few people leaving because of it. But Allore says it didn't cause as much trouble as we thought at the hospital.\nAbel, who helps nurses at a certain place, says she likes the help for feeling better and other services offered to workers, but she thinks the best way to keep more workers is to pay them more or give them extra money that is the same as the money given to new workers.\nA girl is wondering if anything can make her feel better after feeling tired from helping others a lot during a time when many people were sick. \n\"There are moments when I think, oh no, how am I going to keep doing this with so many people getting sick?\" Alice wonders. \nThis story was once called \"From Bad to Worse\" and talked about people needing help, why some places can't find enough helpers, and how a city's plan to help people pay their rent didn't work out. \nIt also talks about exciting stories about crime, people not having money, problems in public places, and the most interesting news stories of the year. \nThe man who wrote this likes to hike, watch basketball, and spend time with his wife and cat.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "hash": "e722f0e6dd558d72456bd22237ca1c55f20bb58f686fd50414a0654b309153f3"}
