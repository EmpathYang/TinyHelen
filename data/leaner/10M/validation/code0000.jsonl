But, if the friends are in different playgroups, it's not ok unless the friend is also the toy owner.

Then we use a loop to go over each item in the list and see if it's the same as the given nose care (`noseCare`). If we find a match, we say that the nose care is extreme (`isExtreme` = `true`) and stop the loop. In the end, we give back the result of `isExtreme`. We don't care if the nose care is written in upper or lower case letters.\n\nIn terms of best practices, there are several things I could recommend here:\n\n1. Use constants instead of hardcoding string literals where possible - this makes the code easier to read and maintain as well as making it clear what values are expected by the method. For example, we can create a constant for the list of extreme nose cares like so:\n   ```java\n   private static final List<String> EXTREME_NOSE_CARES = Arrays.asList(\"Neti Pot\", \"Nasal Irrigator\", \"Saline Spray\");\n   ``` \n   Then we can modify our method signature to accept this list as a parameter rather than passing individual strings around:\n\n   ```java\n   public boolean checkExtremeNoseCare(List<String> extremeNoseCares) {\n       ...\n   }\n   ``` \n\n2. Consider adding additional validation steps beyond just comparing the input value against the provided options. For instance, we might want to ensure that the input value actually represents a valid option for cleaning one's nose, such as ensuring that it's not empty or null before performing any comparisons. This may help prevent issues down the line if new types of nose cleaners become popular and need to be added to the list of acceptable values without requiring changes to the calling code.\n\n3. Add unit tests to verify correct behavior of the method - this helps catch bugs early and provides documentation about how the method is intended to work.", "hash": "e9d10ee900c8d61c315bb08b0d7845f2bd52bc4286e8cc09cc5aa0e4f98c46d9"}

This starts as false (0).\n\n3) First we check if the password is less than 8 characters long. If it is, then the password is not safe. We can use an if statement for this:\n```c++\n    if(password.length() < 8){\n        return false; // Password too short\n    }\n```\n4) Next, we make sure the password has at least one big letter, one small letter, one number, and one special character (!@#$%^&*()). To do this, we go through each character in the password and see if it matches these. We can use a nested if else statement for this:\n```c++\n   bool hasBig = false; \n   bool hasSmall = false; \n   bool hasNumber = false; \n   bool hasSpecialChar = false; \n   \n   for(int i=0;i<password.length();i++){\n       char c = password[i]; \n       \n       if((c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z') || (c >= 'a' && c <= 'z')){\n           hasBig |= (c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z'); \n           hasSmall |= (c >= 'a' && c <= 'z'); \n       }\n       \n       if(isdigit(c)){\n           hasNumber = true; \n       }\n       \n       if(!hasSpecialChar && (c == '!' || c == '@' || c == '#' || c == '$' || c == '%' || c == '^' || c == '&' || c == '*' || c == '(' || c == ')'));{\n           hasSpecialChar = true; \n       }\n   }\n   \n   if(!(hasBig && hasSmall && hasNumber && hasSpecialChar)) {\n      return false;//Password missing required elements \n   }\n```\n5) Lastly, we want to make sure that the password doesn't have any words from a list of common passwords. For this, we can make another list of strings with commonly used passwords, and compare each word in our password against them. Again, we can use a loop and nested if statements for this:\n```c++\n  const std::vector<std::string> bad_passwords {\"password\", \"<PASSWORD>\", ...};\n  \n  for(auto &word : bad_passwords){\n     if(password.find(word) != std::string::npos){\n         return false;// Found match in list of bad passwords \n     } \n  }\n\n  return true;//No matches found in list of bad passwords, password passes test!\n}\n```\nThis code makes sure passwords are hard to guess.

Here's how we check our toy box:\n\n    - To see all toys from most risky to least risky:\n    \n        ```sql\n        SELECT * FROM toys ORDER BY play_safety DESC;\n        ```\n        \n    - To find the average safety of all toys:\n        \n        ```sql\n        SELECT AVG(play_safety) AS avg_safety FROM toys;\n        ```\n        \n    - To find out the biggest loss from playing with toys over the last year:\n\n        ```sql\n        WITH play_times AS (\n            SELECT\n                pt1.play_date,\n                pt1.toy_price,\n                pt2.toy_price AS previous_price,\n                (pt1.toy_price / pt2.toy_price)-1 AS play_times\n            FROM play_times pt1 JOIN play_times pt2 ON pt1.play_date = pt2.play_date AND pt1.toy_name = pt2.toy_name PREVIOUS\n            WHERE pt1.play_type IN ('get', 'give') AND pt1.play_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 YEAR'\n        ), total_play_times AS (\n            SELECT\n                play_date,\n                SUM(IFNULL(LAG(play_times, 1), 0)) OVER (ORDER BY play_date ASC) AS total_play_times\n            FROM play_times\n        )\n        SELECT MAX((1 - total_play_times)*money) AS biggest_loss FROM (SELECT * FROM total_play_times) t;\n        ```\n        \n    Note: This checks if we played with toys every day. If we didn't, we might need to look at different days.\n    \n     - To check if a toy box has too many risky toys:\n     \n       ```sql\n       SELECT\n           tb.*, \n           t.toy_type, \n           t.size, \n           t.play_safety, \n           ROUND(((tb.total_toys - tb.money)/tb.total_toys)*100, 2) AS too_much_risk\n       FROM toy_box tb \n       INNER JOIN toys t ON tb.friend_number = t.toy_number\n       WHERE tb.money > 50000 AND t.play_safety > 1.3\n       ORDER BY too_much_risk DESC;\n       ```\n       \n   Here, we think if you have more than $50k in your toy box, you should becareful with how many risky toys you have. We consider a toy risky if it has a play safety value greater than 1.3. The query calculates the percentage of the total toys in the box that exceed the money value. If this percentage is too high, it may be a sign that the risk is also too high.\n\n    - To check how often each friend plays with their toys:\n\n        ```sql\n        SELECT \n            f.friend_name,\n            COUNT(*) AS play_frequency\n        FROM friends f\n        INNER JOIN toy_box tb ON f.number = tb.friend_number\n        INNER JOIN play_times pt ON tb.number = pt.toy_box_number\n        GROUP BY f.friend_name\n        ORDER BY play_frequency DESC;\n        ```\n        \n    This query will show each friend's name along with the number of times they've played with their toys, sorted in descending order. This way, you can see which friends play with their toys the most.\n\nRemember, playing with toys can be fun, but it's also important to play safe. Use these lists and tools to keep track of your toy box and make sure you're not taking on too much risk.", "hash": "6ca4030fe96700278348887d96a6544522681cef360d3aa13e129fbf8ed407ab"}
