The idea of an AR group started as a way to talk about a group of people and later was used by some groups with strange ideas. It was also used by bad people who thought some people were better than others.\\nThe bad ideas of a group called NA was based on the idea of the AR group or GE people being the best group. The NA idea of the AR group came from people like Arthur and Houston who had ideas about races.\\nA man named Adam, the leader of NA, had strong ideas and decided that some other groups of people were also part of the AR group. He said HU people were \"AR\" in 1934, the JA people were \"AR\" in 1936, and the FI people were \"AR\" in 1942. But, NA didn't think SL people were \"AR\", but thought they were not as good.

He went to see his relatives in the Mississippi Delta area when he spoke to 21-year-old Carolyn Bryant. She was the married owner of a small grocery store. Several nights later, Bryant's husband Roy and his half-brother J. W. Milam, went to Till's great-uncle's house. They took Till to a barn. It is believed that they beat him and removed one of his eyes . They then shot him in the head and put his body in the Tallahatchie River. His body was found in the river three days later.\nTill's body was returned to Chicago. His mother wanted on a public funeral service with an open casket. She wanted this to show the world how her son had been killed. Tens of thousands of people went to his funeral or saw his casket. Images of his body were published in black magazines and newspapers. This caused support from both black and white people in the UN city. At first, local newspapers and law enforcement officials spoke against the violence and asked for justice. They soon began dealing with national criticism by defending the people of Mississippi. This led to support for the people said to be the killers.\n Benjamin and Matthew were not found guilty of Thomas's bad end. They were not accused of taking him away. Some months later, when they could not be tried again because of a rule, they said they did it in a magazine chat. Thomas's bad end is thought to be an important event that led to a big change in rules for all people.\nProblems proving that the body was Thomas affected the trial. This was part of why Benjamin and Matthew were found not guilty. The case was looked at again by the US country's Department of Justice in 2004. A close look at the body was done. It was proven to be Thomas's body. He was put to rest again in a new box. His old box was given to a big museum.", "hash": "31a24b5941a527c54cbf523b0fca5773a0ea05fdeaf82b79fa1495bcbdcc69f9"}

The leader's job is to make sure the state's rules are followed. The leader can say yes or no to new rules made by the ID state's rule makers.\nID state had 16 leaders picked by the US country's leader from a long time ago until it became a state. Four of these leaders never started their job. They said no before they got to ID state.\nThirty people have been Leader of ID state since it became a state. Two of these\u2014Cameron and Charles\u2014were leaders more than once. The state's first leader was Gabriel. He was leader for the shortest time - three months. Charles was leader for the longest time at 14 years. Four leaders said no to the job. None have died while doing the job. There have been 21 leaders from the red team and 12 leaders from the blue team. The leader now is Benjamin. He started his job on a winter day. His time as a leader will end soon. \nID place was made from parts of DA place, NE place, and WA place a long time ago. At first, it was really big and included all the places we now call ID place and MO place, and most of WY place. Then, MO place became its own place, and most of WY place went back to DA place. The part that was east of a big line became the new WY place. This made ID place the size it is now.\nBecause it took a long time to travel from WA city to BO city, sometimes there was a long wait for a new leader to arrive.\nID place became a part of our country a long time ago. Since then, it has had 31 leaders. Two of these leaders served more than once. The time a leader serves is four years. It starts on the first Monday of the new year after he is chosen. A long time ago, leaders only served for two years. If there is no leader or if the leader is away or cannot do his job, the helper leader takes over. If neither the leader nor the helper leader can do their jobs, the next person to take over is the leader of the ID Senate. After that person, the leader of the ID House would take over. A leader can serve as many times as he wants.\nSixteen of ID place's leaders have served in higher places or as leaders of other places. Nine of them have worked in the US big house, and three have worked in the US small house. Two leaders have been US helpers for nature. One worked as a friend to the OT country. Six leaders (marked with *) left their job to take a new one. \nAlso, two people who were chosen to be leader of ID place but never did the job held other important jobs. Gabriel was a helper and leader from the NE state. Jack was the leader of AZ place.\nAll helpers and leaders listed worked for ID place except where mentioned.\n, four past leaders were still alive.
