{"text": "\"Okay.\" \"You live in what kind of home?\" \"In a little house.\" \"A small home.\" \"Don't hurt yourself.\" \"Welcome aboard.\" \"Just so you know, he's got a little fin.\" \"If he's having trouble swimming, let him take a break. 15 minutes.\" \"Dad, it's time for you to go now.\" \"We're going to stay together.\" \"Okay, class.\" \"Pay attention up front.\" \"Remember, we keep our bodies to ourselves.\" \"That means you, Jack.\" \"Oh, man!\" \"Bye, Nemo.\" \"Bye, Dad.\" \"Bye, son. Be safe.\" \"You're doing well for a first-timer.\" \"You can't hold on to them forever, can you?\" \"I had a tough time when my eldest went out on the big trip.\" \"The big trip! They're going on the big trip? Are you crazy? Why don't we cook them up now and serve them with chips?\" \"Hey, friend, calm down.\" \"Don't tell me to be calm, buddy.\" \"Buddy? For a fish, he really isn't that funny. Pity.\" \"Let's name the animals, the animals, the animals. Let's name the animals that live in the sea. Some animals with shells, some animals with legs, some animals with spines, some animals like you and me! Come on. Sing with me.\" \"Seaweed is cool, seaweed is fun. It makes its food from the rays of the sun.\" \"Okay, the big trip. All right, kids. Feel free to explore, but stay close.\" \"Look at all the tiny plants! An ecosystem contained in one tiny speck.\" \"Come on. Let's go.\" \"Come on. Sing with me.\" \"There's sponges, jellyfish, corals, sea anemones, and some other animals too. Hey, guys, wait up.\" \"Whoa! Cool.\" \"Saved your life! You guys made me drop ink.\" \"What's that?\" \"I know what that is. A friend saw one. He said it was called a big thing.\" \"Wow. That's a pretty big thing.\" \"Look at me. I'm going to go touch the big thing.\" Once there was a little fish named Nemo. One day, Nemo went close to the open water. His dad saw this and said, \"Nemo, that is not safe. You cannot swim well yet. You will start school in a year or two.\"\n\nNemo said, \"I can swim fine, Dad. Just because you are scared of the ocean does not mean I cannot go there.\"\n\nHis dad said, \"No, Nemo. You think you can do these things, but you cannot. You are not ready.\"\n\nNemo got angry and said, \"I hate you.\" Then he swam out towards a boat.\n\nHis dad shouted, \"Nemo, come back here right now! Do not touch that boat!\"\n\nBut Nemo did not listen. Suddenly, a big fish came and took Nemo away.\n\n\"Daddy, help me!\" Nemo cried out.\n\nHis dad tried to save him, but it was too late. Nemo was gone. \"It's gone.\" \"It cannot be gone.\" \"No.\" \"No!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo...\" \"Nemo!\" \"No.\" \"Nemo!\"\"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"No.\"\"No.\" \"No.\" \"Please, no.\" \"No, no.\" \"Has anybody seen a boat?\" Please. A white boat? My child! My child! My child! Help me. Please. Look out! Sorry. I did not see you, sir. Are you okay? Child is gone. There, there. Child is gone. It is all right. It will be okay. No, they took child away. I have to find the boat. A boat? I have seen a boat. You have? And it passed by not too long ago. A white one? Hi. I am Dory. Where? Which way? It went this way. Follow me. Thank you. Thank you so much. No problem. Wait. Quit it. I am trying to swim here. The ocean is not big enough for you? You got a problem, buddy? Do you?\"Do you? Do you? Want a piece of me? Yeah. I am scared now! Wait. Stop following me, okay? What? You are showing me which way the boat went. A boat? I have seen a boat. It passed by not too long ago. It went this way. Follow me. Wait a minute. What is going on? You already told me which way the boat was going. I did? Oh, no. If this is some kind of joke, it is not funny and I know funny. I am a clownfish. No, it is not. I am so sorry. See, I suffer from short-term memory loss. Short-term memory loss. I do not believe this. No. I forget things almost instantly. It runs in my family. At least I think it does. Where are they? Can I help you? Something is wrong with you. Really. You are wasting my time. I have to find my child. Hello. Well, hi! Name is Bruce. It is all right. I understand. Why trust a shark, right? So, what is a couple of bites like you doing out so late? Here is a preschool friendly version of the conversation:\n\n\"Nothing.\" \"We're not even out yet.\" \"Great.\" \"Then how about you kids come to my fun party?\" \"You mean like a party?\" \"Yeah, right.\" \"A party.\" \"What do you say?\" \"I love parties.\" \"That sounds like fun.\" \"Parties are fun but we can't go because...\" \"Come on.\" \"I want you to come.\" \"Okay.\" \"That's all that matters.\" \"Look.\" There are balloons.\" It is a party. But be careful, those balloons could pop.\" \n\n\"Adam! Benjamin! There you are, Cameron. Finally.\" \"We have guests.\" \"It's about time, friend. I'm very hungry.\" We almost had to eat each other.\" Let's get this started.\"\n\n\"Okay. Our meeting has started. Let us all say the nice words. I am a nice fish, not mean. If I want to be nice, I must try hard. Other fish are friends, not food. But not dolphins.\" \n\n\"Dolphins! They think they're so cute. Look at me, I'm a silly dolphin. Aren't I cute?\" \n\n\"Today we need to bring a fish friend. Do you all have your friends?\" \"I have mine.\" \"Hey there!\" \"I lost my friend.\" \"It's okay, you can have one of my friends.\" \"Thanks, friend.\"\n\n\"Hello. My name is Cameron. Hello, Cameron. It has been a long time since I ate a fish, I promise. Or I'll get in trouble.\" \"You are a good example for us.\" \"Amen.\" \n\n\"Who's next?\" \"Pick me! Pick me!\" \"The little girl up front can go.\"\n\n\"Hi. I'm Diana. Hello, Diana. And...Well, I don't think I've ever eaten a fish.\" \"Hey, that's great!\" \"Good for you, friend!\" \"I'm glad I said that.\" Anyone else?\" \"What is wrong with you?\" \"I have no problem.\" \"Okay.\" \"You are in denial.\" \"Tell me your name.\" \"Okay.\" \"Hello.\" \"My name is Adam.\" \"I am a clownfish.\" \"A clownfish? Really?\" \"Keep going.\" \"Tell me a joke.\" \"I love jokes.\" \"I actually know a pretty good one.\" \"There was this mollusk and it walked up to a sea cucumber. Usually they do not talk, but in a joke, everyone talks. The sea mollusk said to the cucumber...\" \"Father!\" \"Nemo!\" \"I don't get it.\" \"For a clownfish he's not that funny.\" \"No, he's my son. He was taken by these divers. Poor fish. Humans think they own everything. Probably from the NA country. There is a father looking for his little boy. What do these markings mean?\" \"I never knew my father.\" \"Come here. We're all friends here.\" \"I can't read human writing.\" \"Then we've got to find a fish that can read this.\" \"Look. Sharks!\" \"Friends.\" \"No, Emma. That's mine. Give it back.\" \"Stop it. I'm sorry. Are you okay? I hit you hard. Am I bleeding?\" \"Emma, are you oka... That's good. Stop!\" Just a bite.\" \"You stay strong, friend. Fish are friends, not food.\" \"Food!\" \"Emma, look out. I'm having fish tonight.\" \"Remember the steps, friend. Just one bite.\" \"Good day. There's no way out. There's got to be a way to escape.\" \"Who is it?\" \"Help me find a way out.\" \"Sorry. You'll have to come back later. We're trying to escape. There's no way out. There's got to be a way out.\" \"Here's something. 'Es-ca-p.' I wonder what that means.\" \"It's spelled just like the word 'escape.'\" \"Let's go. Here's Bruce!\" \"Wait a minute. You can read?\" \"I can read? That's right! Then here. Read this now.\" \"He doesn't mean it.\" A fish said, \"That fish has an interesting shape.\" Another fish replied, \"Yes, it is a special kind of fish.\" A third fish commented, \"I see that fish!\" Other fish were talking about the new fish. One fish needed help. Another fish said, \"I'll go help that fish.\" One fish was cleaning the new fish. Another fish said, \"The inside of animals' mouths is dirty.\"\n\nA new fish arrived. The other fish asked, \"Who is this?\" One fish explained, \"The animal doctor brought this fish from the reef.\" Another fish asked if the new fish was from the same home. The new fish apologized for being rude. One fish said, \"Fish need to swim and birds need to eat.\"\n\nAnother fish said, \"Those are my fish, not yours.\" The fish told the other fish to go away. The fish showed a picture and said, \"This is Emma, my niece. She will be eight years old soon. Say hello to your new mother. She is coming on Friday to take you home. You are her present. This is our secret.\"\n\nLater, the fish talked about Emma shaking a bag and killing a pet fish last year. One fish said, \"She is dangerous to fish.\" The new fish worried and said, \"I can't go with that girl. I need to get back to my dad.\" The fish called out, \"Dad! Help me!\" The other fish told him to get out by himself. One fish named Adam encouraged the new fish to wiggle out.\n\nThe new fish said, \"I can't. I have a bad fin.\" Adam said, \"That never stopped me. Just think about what you need to do.\" The new fish wiggled out successfully. The other fish praised him. One fish noticed the new fish's worried look and asked what he was thinking. The new fish replied, \"I'm thinking we should welcome the kid properly tonight.\" Let's be happy it was just a small one. Don't move. This is bad, Dory. Boing. Boing. Dory! You can't catch me. Don't bounce on the tops. They will not sting you! The tops don't sting you. Two in a row. Beat that. Listen to me. I have an idea. A game. A game? I love games. Pick me. Here's the game. Whoever can hop the fastest out of these animals wins. Okay! Rules. Don't touch the feelers. Only the tops. Something about feelers. Got it. On your mark. Get set. Go! Wait! Go faster if you want to win. Dory! Boing, boing, boing! Wait a minute. So, we're avoiding danger now. We're having fun at the same time. I can do this. Just be careful. Careful I don't make you cry when I win. I don't think so! Give it up. You can't fight nature. I was made for speed. The question is, are you hungry? Hungry? Yeah. 'Cause you're about to eat my bubbles! Duck to the left, back and coming over, right there! The small fish is the winner! We did it. Look at us! Dory? Oh, no. Dory! Dory! Dory! Dory! Dory! Dory! Am I disqualified? You're doing fine. You're winning. Stay awake. Where does P. live? P., Wallaby Way, SY city. That's it! Stay awake. Stay awake. Stay awake. Stay awake. Stay awake! Awake... P.... Awake... 42 Wallaby Way... Wake up. SY. Nemo... You miss your dad, don't you, small one? Yeah. Well, you're lucky to have someone out there who's looking for you. He's not looking for me. He's scared of the water. Fruit? Any movement? He's had four cups of coffee. It's got to be soon. Keep on him. My first escape, landed on doctor tools. I was aiming for the toilet. \"The toilet?\" \"All drains lead to the ocean, child.\" \"Wow.\" \"How many times have you tried to get out?\" \"I've lost count.\" \"Fish aren't meant to be in a box, child.\" \"It does things to you.\" \"The bubbles, the bubbles!\" \"Potty break!\" \"He just grabbed the book.\" \"We have a short time.\" \"That's your cue.\" \"You can do it, child.\" \"We got to be quick.\" \"Once you get in, swim to the bottom and I'll help you with the rest.\" \"Okay.\" \"Go on.\" \"It'll be easy.\" \"Nicely done.\" \"Can you hear me?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Here comes the small stone.\" \"Now, do you see a small opening?\" \"Okay.\" \"Inside it you'll see a moving fan. Very carefully, wedge that small stone into the fan to stop it moving. Careful, child.\" \"I can't do it.\" \"This isn't a good idea.\" \"He'll be fine. Try again!\" \"Okay.\" \"That's it, child. Nice and steady.\" \"I got it, I got it!\" \"He did it.\" \"That's great, child. Now swim up the tube and out. Oh, no! Help him! What do we do? Oh, no! Stay calm, child. Just don't panic. Help me! Child, grab hold of this. No! Feed me more. That's it! Come on, child. Grab it. I got it. Pull! Don't make him go back in there. No. We're done. Friend? Friend? Friend? Focus, friend. Friend? He lives. Hey, friend. What happened? I saw the whole thing, friend. First you were all, like, whoa! And then we were all, like, whoa! Then you were, like, whoa... What are you talking about? You, small person! Taking on the animals. You got serious fun issues, friend. Great. Oh, my stomach. Man, no being sick on the shell. I just cleaned it. So, Mr Animal... Friend, Mr Animal is my father. \"Emma's name is Charlotte.\" \"Charlotte?\" \"Really?\" \"Okay, Charlotte.\" \"Listen, I need to get to the EA Current.\" \"EC?\" \"Friend...\" \"You're riding it, friend.\" \"Check it out.\" \"Okay, grab this, friend.\" \"Grab what?\" \"Great!\" \"Great!\" \"Great!\" \"So, what brings you here today to the EC?\" \"Well, Ruby and I need to get to the SY city.\" \"Ruby!\" \"Is she okay?\" \"Oh, the little blue one.\" \"She is down, friend.\" \"Ruby, Ruby!\" \"Ruby!\" \"Oh, Ruby.\" \"I'm so sorry.\" \"This is all my fault.\" \"It's my fault.\" \"...twenty-nine, thirty!\" \"Ready or not, here I come!\" \"There you are. Catch me if you can. Up you go! Oh, my goodness. Stop the machine, friend. Let us see what Samuel does flying alone. Whoa! That was so cool. Hey, Dad. Did you see that? Did you see me? Did you see what I did? You are so great, Samuel. Give me some fin. Head. Friend. Intro. Jellyman, Child. Child, Jellyman. Jellies? Nice. I must have done something you all liked, friends. You are great, friend. Swim away, my child. It's awesome, Jellyman. When the little ones are eggs we leave them on a beach to hatch, and they find their way back to the big sea. All by themselves? Yeah! But, friend, how do you know when they're ready? You never really know, but when they know, you'll know. You know? Hey, look, everybody. I know that friend. It's the Jellyman. Well go on. Jump on him. Turtle pile! Wait. Kids! You funny? Where's your shell? Do your stripes come off? I need to breathe. Did you cross the jellyfish forest? One at a time. Mr Fish, did you die? Sorry. I was vague on the details. So where are you going? A father said, \"My child was taken away from me.\" A friend asked what happened. The father said, \"Well, okay. I live on a reef, far away from here. My child, [Liam], was angry with me. Maybe [he] would not have done it if I had not been so tough on [him]. [He] swam in the open water to a boat and some workers came. I tried to stop them. The boat was too fast, so we swam out in the ocean...\" \n\nThe friend said, \"[Liam]'s dad swam out to the ocean and met three big fish. He scared them away. Then he dived deep down into the dark ocean. The only thing they could see was a big, scary creature with sharp teeth! Then he had to swim fast...\"\n\n\"These fish have been looking for [Liam] in the ocean for days. He may be coming here soon. This dad will not stop until he finds his child. I hope he makes it. That's a dedicated father, if you ask me.\"\n\nSome birds said, \"This person is looking for his child, [Liam]. [He] was taken from the reef by workers...\" One bird said, \"Last I heard, he is heading towards the city.\" \n\nThe father met a fish who said, \"I'm sorry I could not stop... I was so ready to taste the ocean, I was willing to put you in danger to get there. Nothing should be worth that.\" \"I'm sorry I couldn't get you back to your mother, kid.\" \"All right.\" \"Hey, hey, hey!\" \"What the...\" \"Well, that's one way to pull a tooth.\" \"Naughty kids.\" \"Well, good thing I pulled the right one, eh?\" \"Frank, you just missed an extraction.\" \"Has he loosened the tooth yet?\" \"What am I talking about?\" \"Where's Isaac?\" \"I've got to speak with him.\" \"Your mom's been fighting the ocean looking for you.\" \"My mother?\" \"Really?\" \"She's travelled far away. She's been battling sharks and jellyfish. Sharks? That can't be her. Are you sure? What was her name? Some sort of fish. \"Elizabeth?\" \"Anna?\" \"Diana?\" That's it. The clownfish from the reef. It's my mom! She took on a shark! I heard she took on three. Three? Three sharks? That's many teeth! After you were taken, your mom followed like crazy. Really? She's giving it all she's got and then three sharks capture her. She blows them up and then dives deep and gets chased by a big scary fish! She ties this scary fish. And her reward? She gets to battle a jellyfish forest. Now she's with sea turtles on the East Current and the word is she's headed this way, right now, to NE city! What a good mommy. She was looking for you after all. She's swimming in the filter! Not again! Kid! No! You've got your life ahead of you. We'll help you. Get him out. Get him out of there. Come on. Grab the end. Are you okay? Can you hear me, Kid? Isaac? Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. Kid, you did it! Kid, you're... Covered with germs! That took guts. All right, we have less than two days before Diana gets here. This tank will get plenty dirty in that time, but we have to help it along. Frank, no cleaning. I shall resist. Everybody else, be as gross as possible. Think dirty thoughts. \"They eat small fish.\" \"Swim away!\" \"Look.\" \"Small fish!\" \"Move, Dory!\" \"Move!\" \"Look at that.\" \"Would you look at that?\" \"Dirty.\" \"Absolutely dirty.\" \"And it's all thanks to you, kid.\" \"You made it possible.\" \"Jack, I said no cleaning.\" \"I am ashamed.\" \"Look.\" \"Angel with bubbles.\" \"Bubbles!\" \"I love the bubbles.\" \"Grace?\" \"Has anybody seen Grace?\" \"Grace!\" \"In the morning, and show dentist.\" \"Hannah.\" \"Sorry I'm late. \"Okay. Here we go.\" \"Little David goes to the counter, drops the keys...\" \"Henry, that's yucky.\" \"Tastes pretty good to me. \"Don't you see we are swimming in our own...\" \"Here he comes.\" \"What the...\" \"Oh my!\" What a mess. Hannah, what's my next visit tomorrow?\" \"10 in the morning, dear. Leave it open. I've got to clean the fish tank before Lily gets here.\" You hear that, Samuel? Yay! He's going to clean the tank! Yeah, we're going to be clean! Ready to see your dad? Of course you are. I wouldn't be surprised if he's out there in the ocean waiting for you right now. Yeah. Here comes a big wave! Come on. You got to try this.\" Will you just stop it? Why? What's wrong? We're in a very big animal. Don't you get it? A huge animal? A huge animal! 'Cause you had to ask for help. And now we're stuck here. A huge animal? You know, I speak animal language. You're silly. You can't speak animal language. I have to get out. I have to find my son. I have to tell him how old sea turtles are! Hey. You okay? There, there. It's all right. It'll be okay. No. It won't. Sure it will. You'll see. No. I promised him I'd never let anything bad happen to him. That's a funny thing to promise. What? You can't never let anything bad happen to him. Then nothing would ever happen to him. Not much fun for little Nathan. What's going on? It was early morning. A fish said, \"Today's the day. The sun is shining, the tank is clean and we are getting out of here.\" Another fish said, \"The tank is clean! But how?\" The first fish replied, \"The boss must have put in a new machine while we were sleeping.\" A third fish asked, \"What are we going to do?\" The first fish said, \"Listen, this machine cleans the tank every five minutes. It scans the tank to do that.\" \"What does that mean?\" \"The temperature is good, and the water is normal.\" \"Nice.\" \"I don't like you, bad fish!\" \"That's it for the escape plan.\" \"Then what are we going to do about...\" \"Diana!\" \"Stay down, child.\" \"False alarm.\" \"My nerves can't take much more.\" \"What are we going to do when that kid gets here?\" \"I'm thinking, I'm thinking.\" \"Help!\" \"Help me!\" \"Hold on.\" \"I'm coming.\" \"Help me!\" Swim down! Come on, child. Swim down! Everybody jump in. Swim down! What the... Good work. Gill! Child! Roll, child! Lean, child! Roll! Go to the window. That would have been a nasty fall. I don't want to get hurt! Calm down, Oliver. You won't get hurt. I promise. You're going to be okay. Diana! Do any of these boats look familiar to you? No, but the boat has to be here. We're going to find it. I'm totally excited. Are you excited? Zoe, wake up. Come on. Duck! That's not a duck. It's a big bird! No! I didn't come this far to be food. Hey, big bird. Would you look at that? What? The sun's barely up and Gabriel's had more than he can handle. Yeah. Reckon somebody ought to help the poor guy. Well, don't everybody fly off at once! All right, Gabriel. What is it? Animal got your tongue? Love an animal! I've got to find my son Oliver. Oliver? He's that fish that's been fighting the whole ocean. Hey, I know where your son... Wait. Come back. Stop! Keep going. He's crazy. I've got something to tell you. Mine. Okay. Don't make any sudden moves. Hop inside my mouth if you want to live. Hop into your mouth? And how does that make me live? Because I can take you to your son. Yeah, right! No. I know your son. He's orange. He's got a problem fin on one side. \"That's Nemo!\" \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Hold on tight!\" \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Too loud for me.\" \"Too loud for me.\" \"A sweet little song.\" \"Find a happy place.\" \"Find a happy place!\" \"Quinn, your uncle will see you now.\" \"All right. Let's see your teeth.\" \"I'm a strong fish.\" \"Those fish live far away.\" \"And that fish is just like your gift.\" \"I got a fishy!\" Oh, no. The poor little thing. It's dead. Hooray! Fishy, fishy, fishy! Your uncle forgot your present in the car, dear. I'll go get it. It's still alive! Why is it playing dead? It's going to be flushed down the toilet. It's going to get out of here. What a smart little fish. No, not the trash can! Hey! I found its dad. Where's Nemo? At the doctor's! It's over there. What's a doctor? Get in there. I can't go in there. Oh, yes you can. Charge! What the... Quinn, sweetie, look out. Hold still. Easy, easy. Hold still! It's all right. Nobody's going to hurt you. Nemo. Oh, my goodness. Gotcha! Nemo! Daddy? Out with you. And stay out! Daddy? Fishy? Fishy! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Oh, no! To the top of the mountain. Why are you sleeping? Hurry! Friend! Ring of Fire! Fishy! Get it out! Crikey! The animals are going wild! Get it out! Hit it on the head! Go, friend, go! There's a fish in my hair! Friend. Nemo. Tell your dad hello from me. Go get him. It did it! I'm happy. Is it going to be okay? Don't worry. All fish roads lead to the big water. \"Smelly fish!\" \"Father!\" \"I'm...\" \"I'm so sorry.\" \"I really am.\" \"Hey...\" \"Diana.\" \"If it was not for you, I never would have even made it here.\" \"So thank you.\" \"Hey, wait a little time.\" \"Wait.\" \"Where are you going?\" \"It's over, Diana. We were too late. Nora's gone. I'm going home now.\" \"No. No, you can't. Stop! Please don't go away. Please?\" No one's ever stayed with me for so long before. And if you leave... I remember things better with you. Look. P. Sherman, 42... 42... I remember it. It's there. I know it is. Because when I look at you, I can feel it. And I look at you and I... I'm home. Please. I don't want that to go away. I don't want to forget.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Diana, but I do. Sweet rain from sky. Sweet drink of life.\" \"Hey! This is our place. Go away. Get out of here.\" \"Hey, hey, hey. Yeah, that's it. Too right, friend! I got a live one here!\" \"Have you seen my father?\" \"Gotcha! Come back here.\" \"You let him go!\"\n\n\"Father!\" \"Father!\" \"Father!\" \"Father!\" \"Father!\" \"No!\" \"Excuse me.\" \"No.\" \"Are you all right?\" \"I don't know where I am. I don't know what's happening. I think I lost someone, but I can't remember.\" \"It's okay. I can't remember. I'm looking for someone, too. We can look together.\" \"I'm Diana.\" \"I'm Nora.\" Nora? That's a nice name. \"Father!\" \"Father!\" \"Father!\"\n\nWait a little time. Is it your father or my father? My father. \"Got it. Father!\" Where are we anyway? Father! Sydney. P. Sherman, 42 NE street, Sydney. \"Nora!\" \"What?\" It's you! Nora! Yes. \"I'm Nemo.\" \"You are Nemo.\" \"You were lost.\" \"I saw you.\" \"And then...\" \"Here you are.\" \"You are not lost.\" \"And your father...\" \"Your father!\" \"My father?\" \"You know my father?\" \"Where is he?\" \"He went this way.\" \"Quick!\" \"\"Hey!\" \"Have you seen a small fish swim by?\" \"It looks like him.\" \"But bigger.\" \"I saw him, but I will not tell you where he went.\" \"And there is no way you will make me.\"\n\"Mine.\" \"All right.\" \"I will talk!\" \"He went to the fishing spot.\" \"Hey, look out.\" \"Sorry.\" \"I am just trying to get home.\"\n\"Daddy!\" \"Nemo?\" \"Daddy!\" \"Nemo?\" \"Dad!\" \"Nemo is alive!\" \"Dory? Nemo! Daddy! Nemo! I am coming, Nemo!\" Dad! Nemo!\nThank goodness. It is all right, child. It is going to be okay.\nTurn around! You are going the wrong way. Look out! Move! Dory! Come on. Help! Get us out!\nNo, no, no! Dory! Dad, I know what to do. Nemo, no!\nWe have to tell all the fish to swim down together. Get out of there. This will work. No, I am not going to lose you again. There is no time. It is the only way we can save Dory. I can do this!\nYou are right. I know you can. Lucky fin. Now, go. Hurry! Tell all the fish to swim down.\nWell, you heard my child. Come on. Dory, you have to tell everybody to... Swim down together. Do you understand what I am saying? Swim down! Everybody swim down. Come on. You have to swim down. Down! Swim down! Swim down! Swim down!

And it was very old. Very old? Yes. 'Cause a fish said they only lived to be a certain age. A fish? Think I would cross the ocean and not know as much as that fish? It was very old! Not that age.

What are we chasing here?\" \"Multiple hurt people.\" \"I'll go around this way. Meet you in back.\" \"Is that where you live full-time?\" One morning, Adam and Alice went to a store. Adam said, \"We'll go see if we can use this one.\" \"We'll go in here,\" Alice replied.\n\nSince that wasn't a successful attempt, they went into another store. Adam said, \"I'll wait out here.\" \"It's okay,\" Alice said. \"I'm going to stand guard.\"\n\n\"Not a worry,\" Adam responded. \"I'll be right here. I'm not going anywhere.\"\n\nAlice said, \"See, his mother usually does this.\" Then she greeted a woman, \"Hey, Charlotte.\"\n\n\"So how long have you two been married?\" the woman asked.\n\n\"About nine hours,\" Alice replied. \"It was a quick decision.\"\n\n\"We got married quickly, Charlotte,\" Adam added.\n\n\"We need to leave!\" Alice suddenly said. \"I was just talking to her.\"\n\n\"Something's happening!\" Adam exclaimed. \"I need to get out of here!\"\n\n\"Alice!\" he called. \"Alice!\"\n\nThe woman yelled, \"You don't control me, Adam! I control what's inside me! At least half.\"\n\n\"You don't control any part of me or my baby!\" Alice shouted back.\n\n\"Then why did I marry you?\" Adam asked angrily.\n\n\"Hey! Hey! Calm down!\" a bystander said. \"We are not leaving. There is a flood outside. Stop it!\"\n\n\"Stop it!\" Alice cried. \"I'm not pregnant!\"\n\n\"What did you just say?\" Adam asked, shocked.\n\n\"I lied. I'm not pregnant,\" Alice admitted.\n\n\"What are you talking about? I saw the test,\" Adam said, confused.\n\nAlice explained, \"Because Emma saw you with another woman! Go away!\"\n\nAdam protested, \"Emma is mistaken. I haven't been with another woman in a long time. Open the door, Alice.\"\n\nBut Alice refused, \"Not until you calm down!\"\n\nAdam insisted, \"I'm calm! Open the door!\"\n\nSuddenly there was a loud noise. \"Oh my God! Help me! Somebody help me!\" Alice screamed. \"Help me!\" \"Help me!\" \"Help me!\" \"Somebody help me!\" \"Is Henry in there?\" \"Is Henry in there?\" \"Is Henry in there?\" \"Grace, are you okay?\" \"What happened?\" \"What happened?\" \"What happened?\" \"Oh, no.\" \"Oh, dear.\" \"Matthew?\" \"Matthew?\" \"Matthew?\" \"What's going on?\" \"What is wrong?\" \"Oh, no!\" \"Come here!\" \"They caught him.\" \"They caught him.\" \"They caught him.\" \"Why are we keeping him in here?\" \"Where would you prefer, Samuel?\" \"I don't know.\" \"I told you to stay in 3, didn't I?\" \"Did I tell you that? They got in a fight! I tried to get them to go back inside! Should we try the radio again? Samuel, just stay here and watch him. Go back and look after Grace. Where are you going? Just do it, please. Benjamin? I don't know if I'm comfortable with guard duty. He's unconscious, Samuel. He's tied to a post. Adam. Emma? Oh, dear. Emma? I don't remember anything. We had an accident. Kevin? Can you keep an eye on Grace for a minute? She's awake now. I have to get some medicine to help her. Darling, I gotta go get something out of my room. Oh, no! What's wrong? What do you got in the fridge? You be quiet. What's in there? What's in there? What do you got in there? Be quiet. What is it? Be quiet. You can tell me. I'm good at keeping secrets. I got a big secret myself. What are you doing? Oh, no! What are you doing out here? Getting things that are mine. What are you doing? What, I don't get to ask a question? I'm taking photos. There's been two bad things. Before all the evidence. That's not an answer. You're a car driver. What are you doing? Looking to win some \"beyond work\" car driver award? You're not working anymore. You don't need to be a hero. There's a real cop outside. The one who's lost a bad person. \"What were you scared of?\" \"You would not understand.\" \"Try me.\" \"Why did you hurt my friend?\" \"I did not!\" \"I do not know how - I went to my room, that is all!\" \"Why did you leave them?\" \"This your key?\" \"Number 8?\" \"Ten, nine, eight, huh?\" \"This is your key!\" \"You cannot say that!\" \"Those are not my keys!\" \"That is like leading the witness or something.\" \"Look.\" \"These are my keys, okay?\" \"These are my keys.\" \"You see?\" \"You have a nice wallet?\" \"It is the actor's.\" \"Yes, I took their wallet.\" \"After.\" \"After they died!\" \"After, all right?\" \"I did not hurt them. And I did not hurt them.\" \"Let them go, Liam.\" \"Get back! You will not blame this on me.\" \"Thomas?\" \"Get them out of here! Put it down. I did not hurt anybody. No one! But I do not like bad people! If you take one more step\" \"Oh no! Get it off! Oh no! Come on, you little one. Please start. Oh no! Hey! Liam, stop! What is going on? Liam! Get out of my way, I did not do anything wrong! Thomas!\" \"Thomas!\" \"Thomas!\" The court did not allow my client to say they did not understand why they were being put to death. They signed a paper. They did not just sign it, they said it. Also, Thomas's books were found in the wrong place for evidence. Your Honor, this book has writing made just before the bad things happened. Important to note are the big changes in writing style, tone, point of view. What you are looking at are the private thoughts of different people. With permission, Dr. Mallick will explain more. Thank you. Your Honor, there is no perfect treatment for when someone has multiple people in their mind. In theory, one tries to help the patient have one mind again. A folding of their broken mind. Your Honor? They are here. No! What you saw was an accident! They ran out in front of me! I am not a bad person! Nine acres, 1200 trees. Limes and oranges. According to the person who shows the house, the soil needs some work, but it's good land. \"What?\" \"It sounds nice.\" \"Ed?\" \"She's not alive.\" \"Get him out of here.\" \"Come on.\" \"Come on, sweetie.\" \"Look at this.\" \"Where did you get that?\" \"Right here.\" \"This doesn't make any sense.\" \"She died from an accident.\" \"Gabriel was an accident, if you believe Matthew.\" \"Where is seven?\" \"Back it up!\" \"See, I told you it wasn't me!\" \"That's not possible.\" \"I was standing right there.\" \"I saw what happened.\" \"We all saw what happened.\" \"He ran out.\" \"Nobody could have known he was gonna do that.\" \"No one person.\" \"We're back to that again?\" \"It's the spirits, huh?\" \"Maybe it's the ghost of the person that Matthew put in the cold place.\" \"Somebody untie me.\" \"You know it wasn't me.\" \"Come on.\" \"Listen.\" \"We have to get out. Take her car and get out. You, her and the child.\" \"There's nowhere to go.\" \"How much gas do you have?\" \"Half a tank.\" \"You can drive until early morning on that.\" \"Look at me.\" \"When you get to where it's wet, go the other way.\" \"I don't know if I can.\" \"Get the child and go. Right now.\" \"Come on. Thomas. Thomas, come on. Let's go. Get up.\" \"What's going on?\" \"They can't leave!\" \"This way. We'll see you when the bad weather stops.\" \"Hey!\"\"Hey! Hey! They can't leave! Where are they going? Get back here! Go, go, go! They're leaving. They're not leaving. Go! You can't let people leave after four people have died! You really think they're people who did something wrong? They're not leaving!\" Loud noise. Penelope! Things to stop fire. Matthew, you got a thing to stop fire? Thing to stop fire! Where? Back there! Nobody in there. Maybe it got so hot, they became ashes. There would be something left. You did this. You did this! \"Tired and old things make fun of me\" \"But that's not true, I don't want to lose you\" \"I want you\" \"I want you\" \"I want you so much\" \"Thomas.\" \"No, please don't.\" \"No, Thomas, please.\" \"What is it, Henry?\" \"Henry?\" \"Bad people don't get another chance.\" \"When I went up the stairs\" \"I saw a man who wasn't there\" \"He wasn't there again today\" \"I wish he'd go away\"", "hash": "ff52c07dbe667db4b85dee8e28a65e44019f0393d59c02f370f945d63251dece"}
{"text": "A dad worked at a food shop. One evening, a bad person came and hurt the dad and a customer. The police try to find who did it. They ask people who saw what happened. The customer is in the hospital. The police hope the customer can tell them who hurt them. The police look for clues at the shop. They want to catch the bad person who hurt the dad and customer. \"Hello friend, you seem to be closed for today,\" said Adam. \"What does the worker have to say about this?\"\n\"I have never seen him before,\" replied Benjamin. \"Of course not,\" said Adam. \"Is his record book unreadable?\" \"It usually is,\" said Benjamin. \"And I bet he did not ask for proof of who he is.\" \"He probably forgot to do that,\" agreed Adam.\n\"But he gave us the same description as David did. Dark curly hair, thin, tall, with an accent,\" said Benjamin. \"Hey, we found a print from the store from a bracelet he left behind. It belongs to Ethan. He is 28 years old, tall, with dark hair and brown eyes. We are getting a photo of him.\"\n\"What did Ethan do wrong?\" asked Adam. \"He broke into places and had tools to break in. He spent some time in jail for that,\" replied Benjamin. \"Ethan? What kind of name is that?\"\n\"It says here he is from the FR country,\" said Benjamin. \"So his foreign accent was from there?\" \"No, not FR city, the FR country is short for the former Soviet Union,\" explained Adam.\n\"Do we know where Ethan lives now?\" asked Benjamin. \"Yes, at NE city,\" replied Adam. \"Let's go there.\"\nLater, they spoke to Fiona. \"When did you last see your husband?\" asked Adam.\n\"I don't know. He left. He doesn't live here anymore,\" said Fiona.\n\"But why are all his clothes still in the closet?\" asked Benjamin.\n\"I told you, he left because of his girlfriend. I warned him to leave or else I would do something bad,\" said Fiona angrily.\n\"Do you know where we can find this girlfriend?\" asked Adam.\n\"No, I don't know,\" replied Fiona.\nAt another house, they spoke to Gabriel. \"I don't know anything. I'm out of work already, I don't need more trouble,\" said Gabriel.\n\"We're here to prevent trouble, Gabriel. We just have some questions about Ethan,\" said Adam.\n\"Did Ethan kill someone? Those people are crazy, always shouting like there's no tomorrow,\" said Gabriel. This person was waiting outside my store when I came in that early morning. They were in a real hurry to sell me some jewelry. \"I see,\" said the worker. \"Did you buy it?\" \"Yes,\" answered Frank. \"Yes, of course. That's my business.\" \"And the person who sold you this jewelry, do you see them in the courtroom today?\" \"Yes. They are over there. The defendant.\" \"These items which have already been labeled Items two through eleven are they the pieces that you bought from the defendant?\" \"Yes,\" Frank said. \"Yes, that's them.\" \"How much did you pay for all of them?\" \"Five hundred and fifty dollars, cash.\" \"Thank you.\" \"You knew that these pieces were stolen?\" \"I run my business like the Army. Don't ask, don't tell.\" \"In fact, the District Attorney charged you for receiving stolen property in connection with this case, didn't they?\" \"I have charges pending, yes.\" \"Did they promise to drop those charges if you testify against my client?\" \"No, they didn't. But you have hopes, don't you, if you cooperate?\" Objection. Withdrawn. \"Dad...I mean, my father kept careful records of every piece in the store for insurance. Are any of the items labeled Items two through eleven listed in that book?\" \"All of them. The pearl necklace. The gold bracelet.\" (SOBBING) \"Do you know what all this is worth?\" \"That bad person killed my father for maybe five thousand dollars.\" \"I'm very sorry for your loss.\" \"Thank you.\" \"You said Items two through eleven were worth about five thousand dollars together. Is that correct?\" \"About.\" \"So it's not what you'd call top of the line jewelry. Isn't it highly unlikely that your father's the only jeweler in town who would sell these kind of pieces?\" \"I know what you're doing.\" \"Please answer the question.\" \"No. Other people sell this kind of jewelry, too.\" \"Thank you. Next witness.\" Approach. \"The People request a break. Our final witness is coming in from NW city.\" A good person does not just disappear easily, Adam. A person who can send the bad person who hurt them to jail is important. What did you find out? The city police looked at Cameron's phone records and searched his home. His clothes and his wife's clothes were all gone. Maybe your friend was just scared. I do not think so. His fingerprints in his home matched someone named David. He has a record for hurting Elizabeth. Do you know who he is? You think that's possible after all these years? Why not? Everyone has to be somewhere. What are we talking about? Cameron is The Griffin. Well, if he is The Griffin, he surely does not want to be seen in a courtroom. Why are you calling him The Griffin? That's what he called himself, The Griffin. A mythical animal, part dragon, part lion. David. A famous person, loves attention, likes women. He did not come to court after hurting his girlfriend twenty years ago. The police officer said: In the late 20th century, The Griffin was big news. Every time has its famous people. So this is all that we have. He hurt his girlfriend, Elizabeth, with a hard object. Maybe. Oh, he did it. The group of people said so. I thought he did not come to court. He did not. He was judged without being there. That does not happen often, does it? Well, the family of Elizabeth knew an understanding judge who they thought would give them some peace. Well, shouldn't you give this to the old cases police? Well, your boss thinks since you actually met the man. Always thinking of others, your boss. The original police officer on the case was Xavier. He stopped working in the late 20th century. Xavier? Oh, you're going to like this one. David. Supposed to get a lot of women, right? Heh. What the women saw in that fat little person, I'll never know. That's what makes them women, right? I'm with you, Xavier. So this girl that David hurt? Oh, nice kid. Cuter than a bug's ear. Adam knows the type. I used to. I don't know what she was doing with a bad person like David. Finally, she gets angry. A person said, \"They broke up, blah blah.\" \"The person was angry.\" \"He hit her head with a bottle, and hid her body behind the fireplace in his home.\" \"The place smelled bad.\" \"Finally, the landlord called the police.\" \n\n\"Why did a judge let him out on bail?\" \"It's hard to say no when they give you a lot of money up front and write you a check right away.\" \"I didn't know Matthew had that much money.\" \"No, his father.\" \"Liam never worked.\" \n\n\"And that's the last we hear of him until about ten years ago.\" \"We get an anonymous tip that he's living with someone in NE city.\" \"So, we go there, work with the police, search the place.\" \"We just missed him.\" \n\n\"Yes, William is old-fashioned.\" \"You mean prehistoric.\" \"Hello.\" \"But entertaining, in an old way.\"\n\n\"Henry has an old car. A fast car helps when you're running away.\" \"Yes, spell that.\" \"Okay, cool.\" \n\n\"It was registered under Mr. And Mrs. Henry, but the wife's name is Anna.\" \"And you're thinking she's the person from NE city?\" \"NE city sent us photos of all the Annas. A neighbor picked one as Mrs. Henry.\"\n\n\"Well, that doesn't mean they've gone back to NE country. On the other hand they left in a hurry without plans. They might've looked up her family. And all the cash they had was from the ATM.\"\n\n\"I know where my kid goes when she has no money. Goodbye.\" \n\n\"I take it you still haven't found Matthew.\" \"Well, until a few days ago they were living in NE city under the name Henry. And he disappeared?\" \n\n\"We're thinking maybe he visited her family.\" \"That'd be hard. They died in an accident six months ago.\" \"Well, living under a fake name and not able to contact, maybe Anna didn't hear about her family.\"\n\n\"Does she have other family?\" \"A sister. She was here the other day.\" \"Was she alone?\" \"Jack\" said, \"In a famous case, the high court said the right to question witnesses is very important. The person on trial was defended well by his lawyers. But he cannot tell his lawyers what to do if he is not in the courtroom. Mr. March did not come to his own trial, so he lost the right to speak to his lawyers. Another case says a person cannot be tried without being there, if they ran away before the trial started. But Mr. March was in jail when he ran away. It was his choice not to be at the trial after that. Nobody objected at the time, not even his lawyers. We should not be punished now, many years later.\" \n\nA woman said, \"How could you lose? He killed my sister. We proved it in court already.\" Jack replied, \"Higher courts look at the law, not who it affects. This has been going on for twenty years. It ruined my family and even killed my parents.\" The woman said, \"I hope we can convict him again.\" Jack said goodbye. \n\nThen Jack said to someone, \"Of course I'm not sure we'll win. It's an old case. Evidence gets lost and witnesses die over time. But you don't want it too easy, do you? The detective remembers it well. The neighbors Mr. and Mrs. Sherman are dead now. Thomas Styner, another neighbor, died last year. Trish Tippens, Abby's friend, moved far away after the first trial. That's too bad, because Mrs. Sherman had said Abby told her she would leave Levi, but was afraid he might kill her if she did. That shows his motive. We'll use Mrs. Sherman's testimony, the detective's, and other evidence to put Levi in prison for life.\"\n\nA young person said, \"I was just a kid when Abby moved in with Levi. My family thought he was okay. He and my dad would talk about important topics. Levi was always on the news, so it felt like we had a famous person in our family.\" \"Emma:\" \"Was your sister happy with Mr. Samuel?\" \"At first.\" \"Then I started to notice how he'd boss her around.\" \"At a restaurant, he would tell her what to order.\" \"He made her wear certain things, things like that.\" \"He was a control person.\" \n\"Emma:\" \"Did she ever complain?\"\n\"It was a family tradition to go skating in the NY park, every new year.\" \"Until Hannah met Samuel, that is.\" \"That year, Samuel wouldn't let Hannah go.\" \"He didn't know how to skate, so that was it, Hannah couldn't go.\" \"So after we were done, we dropped by their home.\" \"Hannah was alone.\" \"She was crying.\" \n\"Did she tell you why?\"\n\"My dad took me for a walk, while Hannah talked to Mom.\" \"I found out afterwards.\" \"He'd hit her.\" \"A couple of months later she was gone.\"\n\"Did you see Samuel hit your sister?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Did she ever tell you he'd hit her?\"  \n\"No.\"\n\"Tell me Mrs. Victoria, was there ever a time when you saw your mother cry?\"\n\"Of course.\"\n\"Did your father kill her?\"\n\"Do you know what that man did to our family?\"\n\"A crying girlfriend. A disagreement about a family outing. A story about someone hitting someone else. Not exactly evidence, is it?\"\n\"That evil man killed Hannah!\" A man and a woman were talking. The woman said, \"You are a bad person. Even when I was going to have a baby, you were still with another woman. That woman is lying. You are the only one who tells the truth. That woman told me that you killed a girl named Abby, and put her body in the fireplace.\"\n\nThe man said, \"I never told you that. We were never married. Our marriage is not real, just like that woman.\"\n\nAnother man came and said, \"Give us a minute.\" He told the first man, \"You got 25 years in jail, but you could have gotten more if you went to trial.\"\n\nThe first man thought that finally, someone was out to get him.", "hash": "6bedc19de493c5e9602dc3de907132f099c72afb2f163516bcfc1253c45f9747"}
{"text": "Adam was waiting in a line to see a show tonight. There were bright lights shining. He wanted to tell that young Emma was singing songs to him under the big sign. Emma sang nice songs with a big smile. Adam knew her from before. He was waiting patiently in line to see Emma's show tonight. Adam was a young boy. He saw a light. He felt happy. Adam tried to say something. He would be there, waiting. \n\nAdam had a scar. He wished someone saw it. He knew everything about it. Close your eyes and kiss me, he said. I will share this view with the birds. I will share this lonely view with the birds. Push me against the wall. \n\nAdam was a young boy from KE town. He fell over himself. He wanted to taste her health. I will share this view with the birds. I will share this lonely view. \n\nAdam lost blood in a bathroom. He was a girl from SO town with a strong voice. Wave goodbye to mom and dad, she said. I will share this view with the birds. I will share this lonely view with the birds. \n\nAdam spoke softly with a broken jaw. He stepped outside, not to fight. It was sweet autumn, we call it fall. I will make it to the moon if I have to crawl, he said. I will share this lonely view with the birds.\n\nAdam had a scar he wished you saw. He knew everything.

I know for sure that life is beautiful around the world. I know it's you. You say hello and then I say I do. \n\nCome back baby, because I'd like to say I've been around the world. Cameron and Grace went on a trip. They saw many places. They felt happy. Cameron said, \"Life is beautiful around the world.\" Grace agreed. They wanted to travel more places together. They loved being free like birds.\n\nCameron said he had seen Grace's love everywhere in the world. Grace smiled at him. Cameron thought Grace's smile was beautiful even though she looked tired from their travels. \n\nCameron said to Grace, \"Nothing is better than love and friendship. I feel so good when I am with you.\" Grace felt the same way. They continued their trip around the world, experiencing many wonderful things together. We will fly together in this good weather. We will find a nice place. Fly with me, friend. You are a pilot who likes to fly. Look, the plane is ready for you. But we will not fly today. Fly away with me on my plane. We will find a nice place.

They drew pictures with their fingers using colorful paints. The paints were red, blue, and purple. They made a mess, but that was okay. Their friend also joined in the fun. They pretended to be animals and played make-believe games together. In the end, they were happy and felt better. There were some songs. A child sang, \"Pretty things look good on you. If you cry, don't let me go. And the purple color. I know. If I ask you to stay. Come and dance on your way. It's strange out there, but I don't care. 'Cause this is where I go. Let's hope we all stay well. 'Cause we all live in a fun place. With fun people. Words were understood. It's strange out there, but I don't care. 'Cause this is what I want to wear. Let's hope we all stay well. 'Cause we all live in a fun place.\"\n\nAnother child sang, \"I'm like the ocean in your room. Make you feel warm. Make you want to do it again. Now we know it all for sure. I'm a dance hall fun beat. Make the snow fall up from under your feet. Not alone, I'll be there. Tell me when you want to go. I'm like a place that helps people, take it all off. And step inside the moving car. There's a love that knows the way. I'm the rainbow in your room. All the memories of everything you've ever smelled. Not alone, I'll be there. Tell me when you want to go. More will be shown.\" \n\nThe child continued, \"Come again make me excited. I'm a person who likes plants. Two legs that you spread inside the small room. Now we know it all for sure. I could show you to the free field. More will be shown. Not alone, I'll be there. Tell me when you want to go. Sideways falling. More will be shown. More will be shown. Come again get me excited. I'm the red stain on your sleeve. More are coming to believe. Now we know it all for sure. Make the hair stand up on your arm. Teach you how to dance inside the fun place. Not alone, I'll be there. Tell me when you want to go.\"\n\nAnother child sang, \"One try all I need. I've got rhythm when I bleed. Until death do us part. Break my heart so I can start. Fun words. Kiss me in the future time. Twisted but I must insist. It's time to get on top of this.\" All the mamas and the papas. Take a chance on something new. Hard to understand. Do not believe. Easy now to find a nice day.

Tell her that we miss her. NE city gets a queen. Best I've ever. I know you said you do not believe. In a higher power do you still disagree. Now that it's time for you to leave. Gloria is love my friend. Your stylish mess of silver hair. A woman of your kind is rare. Your clothes return to air. Gloria is love my friend. And now it's time for you to be.

Gloria is love my friend. What I've got you've got to give it to your mama. What I've got you've got to give it to your papa. What I've got you've got to give it to your daughter.

Confide wisely you'll be smart. Young people are the loving leaders. How come everybody wants to keep it like the leader. Give it away give it away give it away now. Give it away give it away give it away now. Give it away give it away give it away now. Give it away give it away give it away now. I can't tell if I'm an important person or a poor person.

No time for bad people or jail. Get smart and join the group. This is the best time now. Bob was a good poet and wise. He taught how to live right. He lived as he spoke. I must speak the truth.

Trust wisely and you will be wise. Young people bring love. Why does everyone want to keep things for themselves? Give kindness now. Give kindness. Give kindness now. Some people feel lonely in a big city. The city is like a friend who sees their good actions. They never worry, but that is not true. They don't want to feel sad like before. They want to go to places they love. It's hard to believe no one is out there. At least they have the city's love. Together they cry. Under a bridge downtown, something bad happened. The person forgot about love and gave life away.\n\nSome people have a soul that cannot rest when something is wrong. They explode with anger at night like dynamite. This is their fight. Courage lets them turn feelings into words.\n\nEquality has not been fair in some countries. The person wants to change that unfair attitude. Their name is Peace, and they want power to promote equality. The power of equality is not what it should be. It fills them up like a hollow tree. Their song is strong. If you don't like it, move along. They can say and do what they want. They are against hate groups. They don't accept supremacy beliefs. The media threatens them. In a nice town, Adam lived with his friends. One day, Adam said, \"We need to work hard to make the town better.\" Adam's friend Benjamin said, \"Yes, we need to help people and treat everyone fairly.\" \n\nAdam replied, \"I want everyone to be treated equally. It's not fair how things are now.\" Benjamin agreed, \"You're right, Adam. We should make sure everyone is treated with respect and kindness.\"\n\nThe two friends decided to start a group to teach people about being kind and fair to others. They worked hard to spread their message of peace and equality throughout the town. Adam and Benjamin knew it was important for everyone to feel safe and valued, no matter who they were.", "hash": "5c12e0f8aa9a49aa575ae14a94a4458ec0e5224a72a5e01f85ddce32ec6ea03e"}
{"text": "A young Adam went out to a new home with his wife Bella. It was a big home with a nice view. Bella said, \"This place is too big for us.\" But Adam said, \"Our kids will love it. They can even see big animals from their room window.\" Bella was worried the kids may not like her. Adam said, \"Don't worry. At least one out of all the kids will like you.\" Bella remembered how they first met. She thought it was a funny story. A parent fish and child fish are getting ready for the child's first day of school. The parent fish is worried and overprotective, asking the child if they really want to go to school this year. The child is excited and insists on going. The parent keeps finding excuses to delay, like checking for injuries and making sure the child brushed properly. It's a lighthearted and humorous scene showing the parent's reluctance to let the child be independent and the child's eager anticipation for a new experience. We will go together. OK, kids, come here. And keep our secrets to ourselves. That means you, Jack. Jack: Oh no! Jack: Oh no! Jack: Oh no! Goodbye, Nemo! Goodbye, Dad! Goodbye, son! Be safe. You are doing well for a first time. You cannot keep them forever, right? I had a hard time with my oldest at the beginning. They have to grow up... The beginning? They are going to the beginning? What is wrong with you? Why don't we cook them now and serve them with chips? Hey, Matthew, calm down. Don't tell me to be calm, Frank. Frank? For a fish, he really isn't that funny. Sad. Oh. Let's name the living things, the living things, the living things. Let's name the living things that live in the sea. Nemo: Wow. There's some living things, some, some. Some living things, some living things, three. Some living things, some living things. And some fish like you and me. Come on, sing with me. Oh. [Continues singing in a simple way]. [Exciting sounds playing]. [Exciting sounds playing]. Just the girls this time. Oh, seaweed is cool. Seaweed is fun. It makes its food. OK, the beginning. All right, kids, you can explore... but stay close. [Gasps] Tiny living things! Gather. [All gasp]. A whole world contained in one tiny thing. There are as many small things contained in this... Come on, let's go. Come on, sing with me! There's some living things, some, some. Some living things, some living things, three. Hey, guys, wait for me! Wow. Cool. Saved your life! Aw, you made me ink. [Both laugh]. What's that? William: I know what that is. Someone saw one. A very sad story happened early one morning. A young boy named Adam went missing from his home. His dad was very worried and called out, \"Adam! Adam!\" again and again. The dad asked for help from other sea creatures, \"Has anyone seen a white boat? They took my son! Please help me find my son!\"\n\nOne kind fish named Emma said she saw a white boat go by recently. She offered to show the way it went. The dad thanked Emma and followed her, hoping to find his son Adam. \"Stop it!\" \"What?\" \"I want to swim here.\" \"The sea is not big enough for you?\" \"Do you have a problem, friend?\" \"What?\" \"What?\" \"What?\" \"Do you have a problem, friend?\" \"What?\" \"What?\" \"What?\" \"Do you?\" \"Do you?\" \"Do you?\" \"Do you want to fight me?\" \"Oh, I am scared now.\" \"What?\" \"Wait a minute.\" \"Stop following me, OK?\" \"What?\" \"You are showing me where the boat went.\" \"A boat?\" \"Hey, I saw a boat. It passed by not long ago. It went this way. It went this way. It went this way. Follow me.\" Wait a minute. What is happening? You already told me which way the boat was going. I did? Oh, no. If this is a joke, it's not funny. And I know funny things. I'm a clownfish. No, it's not. I know it's not. I'm very sorry. You see, I forget things quickly. I forget things quickly. I do not believe this. No, it's true. I forget things almost right away. It happens in my family. At least, I think it happens. Where are they? Can I help you? There is something wrong with you...really. You are wasting my time. I have to find my child. Hello. Well, hi! My name is Bruce. It's all right. I understand. Why trust a shark, right? So, what are two little fish like you doing out so late, eh? We're not doing anything. We're not even out. Great! Then how would you like to come to a small party I'm having? You mean, like a party? Yeah, right. A party. What do you say? I love parties. That sounds fun. Parties are fun, and it's tempting, but... Oh, come on, I insist. OK. That's all that matters. Hey, look, balloons. It is a party. Mind your distance, though. Those balloons can be dangerous. You wouldn't want one of them to pop. \"Oh!\" \"No!\" \"Uh!\" \"[Animal sounds]\" \"[Sad sounds]\" \"Hello.\" \"Ah!\" \"Slow down, little one.\" \"There's nothing to worry about.\" \"The little one is very scared.\" \"I want to go home.\" \"Do you know where my father is?\" \"Dear, your father is probably back at the pet shop.\" \"Pet shop?\" \"Yes, you know, like, I'm from CA Pet Store.\" \"CB Pet Store.\" \"CF Pet Store.\" \"Mail order.\" \"Computer order.\" \"So, which one is it?\" \"I'm from the ocean.\" \"Ah, the ocean.\" \"The ocean?\" \"Ah!\" Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! The little one hasn't been cleaned. Jack! Yes. Clean the little one! Yes. Ocean. Ah, the sea. Good. [Happy sounds] Look. The little one is clean. [Surprise sound] Wow. The big blue. What's it like? Big and blue? I knew it. If you need anything, just ask your Aunt Eva. Or if I'm not around, you can talk to my sister Fay. Hi. How are you? Don't listen to anything my sister says. She's a bit silly. Ha ha ha ha! [Muffled] We have a new visitor. Can't hear you, Paul. I said we have a new visitor. Boy, oh, boy. What do we have? A sick mouth... and by the looks of those pictures... it's not going to be easy. [Loud sound] Ow! Are the tools ready? Yes. What did the doctor use to start? A special drill. The doctor seems to like that one lately. I can't see, Fay. You're getting a little too... Ah! PAUL: Now the doctor is doing a special technique. BRIAN: The doctor is using a special tool. That's not that special tool. That's a different tool. It has a special shape. Clearly a different tool. No, no, a different tool. A different tool! There I go. A little help, over here. A young boy was in a fish tank. The dentist put him there. Some fish talked to him. One said, \"I'm Adam. I need to go back to my dad.\" The other fish said, \"No, you got in there. You can get out.\" Adam said, \"I have a bad fin. I can't swim well.\" Another fish said, \"That never stopped me.\"\"Aah!\" \"Aah!\" \"Aah!\" \"Aah!\" \"DIANA:\" \"The second line is 'FG Street 42'.\"\n\"BENJAMIN:\" \"That's good.\" \"Read fast.\" \"Try to guess.\" \"No stress.\" \"No problem.\" \"There's a lot of stress.\" \"Stress!\" \"Try to guess now with stress!\"\n\"LO city!\"\n\"It's 'LO city'!\" \n\"Look out!\"\n\"DIANA:\" \"Aah!\"\n\"BENJAMIN:\" \"I'm hurt.

No, no, no, eating here tonight!\"\n\"Diana.\" \"You are on a diet?\"\n\"Diana!\" \"What did the mask say?\"\n\"FG, FG Street 42, LO city.\"\n[Gasps] \"I remembered what it said! I usually forget things, but I remembered it!\"\n\"Whoa, whoa, wait. Where is that?\"\n\"I don't know. But who cares? I remembered.\"\n\"Raar!\" \"Aah!\"\n\"DIANA:\" \"FG, FG Street 42, LO city.\" \"I remembered it again!\"\n[Loud sound]\n[Bell ringing]\n\"JACK:\" \"Psst. Kevin.\"\n\"KEVIN:\" \"Mmm...

A seashell!\" \"Close enough!\" Oh, it's a fun story I'll tell you, child...They're good. Will somebody please show me the way?\" \"Will somebody please show me the way?!\" Ha ha ha ha ha! I'm serious! \"Blah blah blah, me, me, blah!\" \"Blah blah blah, me, me, me!\" Thank you. Oh, dear. Hey! Hey, come back! Hey, what's the matter? What's the matter? While they're doing their silly little tricks...I am far from home with a fish that can't remember her name! I bet that's frustrating. Meanwhile, my child is out there. Your child? But it doesn't matter because no fish...in this entire ocean is going to help me. Well, I'm helping you. Wait right here. Guys! Is he bothering you again? No, no. He's a good one. Go easy on him. He's lost his child. Any of you heard of a place called SY city? SY city? Oh, sure! [Children's song] Henry here's got family in SY city. Don't you, Henry? Sure do! Oh! Hey! They know SY city! [Gasps] You wouldn't know how to get there, would you? You want to follow the big sea stream. That's the East Sea Stream. Big stream. Can't miss it. It's in...that direction. And then you follow that for about...I don't know. What do you guys think? Samuel and Emma lived in a plant home with many small stinging things around. \"Ow!\" \"Hold still,\" Samuel said. \"I'm used to these small stings.\" \"It doesn't look bad. You'll be fine,\" Emma said. \"But we know not to touch these again. Let's be thankful it was just a little one.\"\n\n\"This is bad, Emma,\" Samuel said. \"Hey, watch this!\" Emma bounced on the tops of the stinging things. \"You can't catch me!\" she said.\n\n\"Don't bounce on the tops! They will sting you!\" Samuel said.\n\n\"The tops don't sting you!\" Emma bounced again. \"Two in a row! Beat that!\"\n\n\"Emma, listen. I have a game idea,\" Samuel said. \"A game?\" Emma asked. \"Yes. Whoever can jump out of these stinging things the fastest wins!\"\n\n\"OK!\" Emma said. \"Rules: you can't touch the stingy parts, only the tops.\"\n\n\"Got it. Go!\" Emma jumped.\n\n\"Wait! It's all about the stingy parts!\" Samuel said.\n\nEmma kept jumping. \"Whee! We're having fun but being careful!\"\n\n\"Yeah, careful I don't make you cry when I win!\" Emma said.\n\n\"I don't think so!\" Samuel said. \"The question is, are you hungry? Because you're about to eat my bubbles!\"\n\nSamuel swam ahead and won the game. \"We did it!\" he said.\n\nBut Emma was gone. \"Oh no, Emma!\" \"Adam, this is not a good idea.\" \"He will be fine.\" \"Try again!\" \"OK.\" \"ADAM:\" \"That is it, child.\" \"Nice and steady.\" \"I got it!\" \"I got it!\" \"I got it!\" \"He did it!\" \"That is great, child!\" \"Now swim up the tube and out.\" [Sounds of effort] Oh, no!\" \"Adam!\" \"Child!\" \"Oh my!\" Get him out of there! \"What do we do?\" Oh, no! Stay calm, child. Just do not panic! Help me! Child, grab hold of this! [Buzzing sound] No! No! No! No! Feed me more! That is it! Child! Grab it! [Sounds of effort] I got it! Pull!

Some divers took Isaac away on a boat. Thomas and Nora swam after them. They met three big sharks. Thomas scared the sharks away. They swam very deep down. It was very dark. They saw a big creature with sharp teeth. Thomas fought the creature. Thomas and Nora have been looking for Isaac for days. They are swimming towards the NE city. They hope to find Isaac soon.

You just saw a tooth pulled. Has he loosened the gum yet? What am I saying? Where is Adam? I must speak with him. What is it? Your dad fought the whole ocean... looking for you. My father? Really? He went far, fighting sharks and jellyfish... Sharks? Cannot be him. What was his name? A fish? Tuna? Trout? Henry? Henry! The small fish from the sea rocks. It's my dad! He fought a shark! I heard he fought three. Three sharks? 4,800 teeth! After you were taken by that diver... your dad followed the boat like crazy. Really? Adam was swimming, trying his best. Suddenly, three big fish captured him. But he escaped and swam very deep. Then a big monster with big teeth chased him! He tied the monster to a rock. What did he get as a reward? He had to fight a big group of jellyfish! Now he was with some turtles in the big fish tank. People say he is coming to this city soon. \"Wow!\" \"What a good dad!\" \"He was looking for you after all, Xena.\" [gasps] Adam is swimming to the filter! \"Xena!\" \"Not again!\" [spits] \"Xena! No! You have a whole life ahead of you! We'll help you, little one!\" \"Get them out!\" [whirring] \"Get them out!\" \"Come on, little one! Grab the end!\" [clank] \"Xena! No!\" \"Can you hear me?\" \"Nathan!\" \"Can you hear me?\" \"Yes, I can hear you.\" \"Nathan, you did it! Nathan, you are covered with germs!\" \"Aha!\" \"That took courage, little one. All right, everyone, we have less than two days before the person comes. This tank will get dirty in that time, but we have to help. Benjamin? No cleaning. I shall resist. Everyone else, be as gross as possible. Think dirty thoughts. We'll make this tank so dirty, the person will have to clean it. \"Good work!\" \"Haha!\" All right, we're here, friends! Get ready! Your exit is coming up, man! Where? I don't see it! Right there! I see it! I see it! The swirling scary thing? That's it, dude. Of course it is. OK, first, find your buddy. Do you have your buddy? Yes! Gabriel will tell you how to exit properly. Good afternoon! We'll have a great jump today! OK, turn hard when you hit the wall. There's a loud bottom turn, so watch out! Remember, do it, roll it, and punch it! \"Who do you want to ask, the small thing?\" \"There's nobody here!\" \"There has to be someone.\" \"It's the big water, silly.\" \"We're not the only two in here.\" \"Let's see.\" \"OK, no one there.\" \"Nope.\" \"Nothing.\" \"[Makes a surprised sound]\" \"There's somebody.\" \"Hey!\" \"Excuse...\" \"Dory, Dory, Dory!\" \"Now it's my turn.\" \"I'm thinking of something dark and mysterious.\" \"It's a fish we don't know.\" \"If we ask it for directions... it could eat us and spit out our bones!\" \"What is it with boys and asking for directions?\" \"I don't want to talk about boys and girls right now.\" \"Let's talk about \"Let's Not Die\".\" \"You want to get out of here?\" \"Of course I do.\" \"How are we going to do that unless we try?\" \"Dory, you don't fully understand...\" \"Come on. Trust me on this. [Makes a tired sound] \n\nAll right. Excuse me! Hello! Small thing? Hello! Don't be rude. Say hi. Hello! Don't be rude. Say hi. Ha. Hello.\n\nHis child Nemo... Nemo was taken to... NE city. NE city! And it's really, really important... that we get there as fast as we can... so can you help us out? Come on, little thing. Come on.\n\nDory, I'm a little thing. I don't think that's a little thing. Oh! Big thing. Whale. OK. Maybe he only speaks whale sound. [Makes whale sounds] We need... To find his child. What are you doing? Are you sure you speak whale? [More whale sounds]\n\nDory! I don't know what you're saying! See, he's swimming away. Come back. He's not coming back. You made him upset. Maybe a different whale sound. [More whale sounds] Dory! This is not whale. You're speaking upset stomach. Maybe I should try a different whale sound. Don't. Maybe I should try a different whale sound. DORY: \"Here comes the big one! Come on! You have to try this!\"\nMARLIN: \"Will you just stop it? Why? What is wrong?\"\nDORY: \"We are in a whale. Do you not get it?\"\nMARLIN: \"A whale? A whale! You asked for help! And now we are stuck here!\"\nDORY: \"Wow, a whale. I speak whale.\"\nMARLIN: \"No, you are insane! You cannot speak whale! I have to get out! I have to find my child! I have to tell them how old sea turtles are!\"\nDORY: \"Hey... are you OK? There, there. It will be OK.\"\nMARLIN: \"No. No, it will not. I promised them I would never let anything happen to them.\"\nDORY: \"Huh. That is a funny thing to promise. You cannot never let anything happen to them. Then nothing would ever happen to them. Not much fun for little one.\"\nMARLIN: \"What is going on?\"\nDORY: \"I will ask them.\" *makes whale sounds* \"I think they say we have stopped.\"\nMARLIN: \"Of course we have stopped. Stop trying to speak whale. You will make things worse. What is that noise?\"\nDORY: \"Oh, no. Look what you did. The water is going down. It is going down!\"\nMARLIN: \"Really? You are sure about that? Look! Already it is half empty!\"\nDORY: \"I would say it is half full.\"\nMARLIN: \"Stop that! It is half empty!\"\nDORY: \"OK, that one was a little tougher. They either said we should go to the back of the throat... or they want a sweet drink.\"\nMARLIN: \"Of course they want us to go there! That is eating us! How do I taste? Do I taste good? Tell them I am not interested in being food!\" A small fish named Nemo got lost. His dad, Adam, and friend Emma looked all over for him. They went to a place with a human who works on teeth. Emma went inside and saw Nemo in a container. She told the others and they made a plan to save Nemo. After some trouble, they got Nemo out and swam back to the ocean. Adam thanked Emma for helping find Nemo. But then Emma realized they couldn't stay together since Nemo had to go home. Adam and Emma were swimming together. Adam said, \"Emma! You were lost.\" \"I saw you. And here you are!\" \"I found you.\" \"You're not lost.\" \"And your dad...\" \"Your dad!\" \"You know my dad?\" \"!\" \"Where is he?\" \"This way!\" \"He went this way.\" \"Quick!\"\n\nBoth Emma and Adam shouted, \"Hey! Hey! Have you seen an orange fish swim by? It looks just like him! But bigger!\"\n\nA crab said, \"Yeah, I saw him. But I'm not telling you where he went... and there's no way you're going to make me.\"\n\nA bird took the crab. The crab shouted, \"All right! I'll talk! He went to the fishing grounds!\"\n\nEmma said, \"Dad!\" Adam said, \"Emma?\" Emma shouted, \"Daddy!\" Adam said, \"Emma?\" Emma shouted, \"Dad!\" Adam said, \"Emma's alive!\" Emma shouted, \"Dad!\" Adam said, \"Emma's alive!\"\n\nAdam saw Frank and said, \"Emma!\" Emma shouted, \"Daddy!\" Adam said, \"Emma!\" Emma said, \"I'm coming, Daddy!\" Adam said, \"Emma!\" Emma said, \"Thank goodness. It's all right, son. It's going to be OK.\"\n\nA big fish said, \"Turn around! You're going the wrong way!\" Everyone shouted.\n\nFrank shouted, \"Help! Help!\" Adam said, \"Frank!\" Frank shouted, \"Help! Help! Help! Get us out!\"\n\nEmma said, \"Dad, I know what to do!\" Adam said, \"Emma! No!\" Emma said, \"We have to tell all the fish to swim down together!\" Adam said, \"Get out of there now!\" Emma said, \"I know this will work!\" Adam said, \"No, I am not going to lose you again! There's no time! It's the only way to save Frank!\"\n\nEmma panted and said, \"I can do this.\" Adam said, \"You're right. I know you can.\" Emma said, \"Lucky fin! Now, go! Hurry! Tell all the fish to swim down!\" Early in the morning, Jack said, \"Come on!\"\nEmma said, \"Adam, you must tell everybody to...\"\n\"Swim down together!\" Jack said.\n\"Do you understand what I am saying?\" Jack asked. \"Swim down!\"\n\"Everybody swim down!\" Jack said.\n\"Come on, you must swim down!\" Jack said.\n\"Down! Swim down!\" Jack shouted.\n\"Swim down!\" David shouted.\n\"Swim down!\" Emma shouted.\n\"Don't give up!\" Jack said. \"Keep swimming!\"\n\"Just keep swimming!\" Jack said.\n\"That's it!\" Jack shouted. \"It's working!\"\n\"Keep swimming!\" everybody shouted.\n\"Keep swimming!\" everybody shouted.\n\"Just keep swimming!\" Jack shouted. \"Keep swimming!\"\n\"Come on, Dad!\" Gabriel said. \"You're doing great, son!\" David said.\n\"That's my dad,\" Gabriel said.\n\"Let's get to the bottom! Keep swimming!\" Jack said.\n\"Just keep swimming, just keep swimming,\" Jack said.\n\"Almost there! Keep swimming!\" Jack said.\n\"Keep swimming!\" everybody shouted.\n\"Keep swimming!\" everybody shouted.\nEverybody cheered.\n\"Oh, no. Gabriel!\" Emma shouted.\n\"Nemo?\" Jack said. \"Nemo?\"\n\"It's OK. Daddy's here. Daddy's got you,\" Jack said.\n\"Dad... I don't hate you,\" Gabriel said.\n\"Hey, guess what?\" Gabriel said.\n\"What?\" Jack asked.\n\"I met a turtle. And he was very old,\" Gabriel said.\n\"Not 100! He was 150!\" Gabriel said.\n\"Time for school! Get up! Let's go!\" Jack said.\n\"Time for school! Get up!

{"text": "Captain's log, early spring. After exploring an uninhabited NE planet for some days, Commander Cameron and I have been called back to our ship to greet an unexpected visitor. \n\n\"Maybe you were dizzy from the high place,\" Cameron said.\n\"I did not slip,\" I replied. \"That rock edge broke the moment I stepped on it.\"\n\"I walked on the same rocks you did. Maybe you loosened them,\" Cameron said with a smile. \"You do weigh a bit more than me.\"\n\nReport came in. A ship dropped out of fast travel 30 minutes ago. The pilot sent a brief message, insisting on speaking with me right away. We found the ship design in our database - it was from the RS country.\n\n\"This is Adam of the ship Enterprise. What can I do for you?\" I asked after opening communication.\n\"You can start by telling me what you're doing here,\" the gruff voice replied. \"I am Captain Patrick of the RS Mining Group. We're studying this planet, with three science teams on the surface. We're also here for a little vacation.\"\n\n\"Vacation? In that case, I recommend you visit the warm area. The view from the tall peak is inspiring.\"\n\"You've been here before?\"\n\"Many times. I like to think of it as my own peaceful place. You must not leave until you've seen the hot water pools of Ren-gham.\"\n\"Where are they?\"\n\"The icy island chain, far from the southern shore. Look for the rocky field, then follow the lava caves. Sounds like we could use a guide - I'll meet you at your side door and help you plan your vacation.\"\n\nTaylor said the RS people are not the most friendly. They enjoy a good debate - it's considered a sport on their planet. \n\nSuddenly, we picked up weapon fire on one deck, the side door. I sent a security team over. An odd attitude for a physician. We are more shy than our women. It has led to some odd times. My space trip health check was an event I hope to never do again. If you do not mind. \n\nThe sensors are picking up a faint power source. Can you find it? Bearing 0-7-1, mark 3-2. It is not steady, but it matches our friend from FR country. Set a course, maximum power.\n\nYou are speaking on a safe channel. I am trying to reach Captain Frank. It is very important that I speak with him. We are trying to move you. Stand by.\n\nThis is Frank. What do you want? I have the one who ran away. He is standing about five meters from me. You will be glad to know he is still alive. I am bringing him to the KR country as we agreed.\n\nNo. I am sending meet place points. Be there in two days. I trust you will have the full pay? You will get what was promised. Glad to do business with you, Captain. As always.\n\nHow much are they paying you? You said the KR country, home of KR people. I assume this has to do with my running from jail. You do not even know what I am accused of. You are right, and I do not care to.\n\nThe signature is steady. It looks like he is orbiting a star. Go to Battle Ready. It appears to be a beacon of some kind. It is making a power signature same as the friend from FR country's. A trick!\n\nAnything on sensors? We will have to start all over. I am getting too much noise from that device. It is messing up our scans. Then get rid of it. With joy, sir.\n\nI have no idea what the KR people are paying you... but whatever it is... Our group will double it. I do not take bribes from bad people. I am not a bad person. KR court says that you are. My \"bad thing\" was helping a ship full of poor people. That was very nice of you. You will think twice before doing that again. It is clear I am never going to get the chance. I was sentenced to life in jail on the PE country. \"Then you'd better get to work.\" \"It can only be accessed from the outer side.\" \" Then we should set down here.\" \" But Cameron's on the surface.\" \"We'll land 1,000 kilometres away.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"You said we'd need another treatment.\" \"Not for three hours.\" \"Is there any harm in starting now?\" \"I can apply it myself.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Perhaps you need another sleep aid.\" \"Rest is not what I need.\" \"This behavior is hardly right.\" \"My name is Taylor.\" \" You don't find me nice?\" \" Of course I do, but that is not the issue.\" \"I'm familiar with your way.\" I know that your marriages aren't only one.\" You and I are co-workers. It's against rules. There's no reason to be limited by human morals. It's clear you're not well. Please. You have no idea what you're denying yourself. Your levels are dangerously high. You don't understand. I'm not sick. These are hardly normal numbers. They're normal for me in my condition. You know what's wrong with you? It's not something we discuss with others. I believe it's time for you to change that rule. You have my promise it will stay between us. We call it the cycle of mating. Have you gone through this before? It's not time. It's possible the illness was a cause. What caused it doesn't matter. If I don't mate with a male, I'll die. That ship you mentioned sounds very important to you. More than you know. If Cameron collects the reward... he'll probably waste it. Not me. I'm going to do something useful with it. I don't understand why you want a cargo ship. It doesn't seem right in your line of work. You think I've been chasing people my entire life? Once I get the money, I'll have enough to pay off the fees. I'll be a freighter captain again. My co-worker used to run freight. You two would probably have a lot to talk about. That ship isn't like any other cargo ship. She was the first of her kind, the fastest ever built. She could haul a lot at high speed. Even your starship isn't capable of that. I fixed her engines myself. You never told me why it was stopped. My sibling and I were hauling a cargo. I thought I could shorten our journey by cutting across the most tiny corner of KL space. I learned very quickly there's no such thing as a tiny corner of KL space. We were lucky to escape with our lives, though we did pay a cost. They took your vehicle? And its cargo, too. My sibling never forgave me. I've been trying to find a way to get the vehicle back ever since. What are you doing? Did you really think I wanted this engine fixed? You're taking me to be punished! Don't worry. We'll meet Goroth on time. Feeling any better? I'm hungry. Our meals will be here soon. I wasn't referring to food. I'm working as quickly as I can. The medicine should help ease most of your symptoms. There's a far simpler treatment. I'd prefer to explore a more normal approach. You have the cure. It's wrong for you to hold it back, Doctor. This mating cycle of yours was made happen. We can't be certain that a physical event would help. I'm willing to try. Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you. You're disturbing my medicine! You need to be put to sleep again. No more needles! One of us should probably answer that. It could be news about the Chief. This is Phlox. Anyone hungry in there? I brought you some supper. Just in the nick of time, Commander. It would be best if you remained here. How are you two holding up? Well enough. Have you been able to locate Chief Archer? We're tracking another warp trail. Hopefully, this one's the real thing. Are those the ones you wanted? Yes, thank you. Is that food? Yeah. I had Chef make you some... Is she all right? She's developed a slight fever, nothing to be worried about. Bridge to Commander Tucker. Go ahead. We're approaching the coordinates. On my way. Call if you need anything. What have you got? Two matching warp trails, both in the upper-atmosphere. More subspace beacons. \"There is a ship on the top.\" \"It looks like it has engine damage, but it's not from the FR country.\" \"Any life signs?\" \"One.\" \"Open a way to speak with them.\" \"Yes?\" \"Sorry to bother you, but we're looking for a shuttle from the FR country.\" \"Have you seen one?\" \"How much did the bad people offer you?\" \"Bad people?\" \"Look, there must be some sort of mistake here.\" \"We're looking for our leader.\" \"Your leader.\" \"The bad people want to catch him.\" \"He's probably far away by now.\" \"Frank, how close are we to where the bad people are?\" \"Less than 6 days away.\" \"If that person from the FR country is looking to get a reward... we better find them before they get there.\" \"Set a course.\" \"Take us fast.\" \"Yes, leader.\" \"What are you doing here?\" I need your help. You shouldn't have brought them. You think I would have come here if I had a choice? I need a special part. And I suppose you have no way to pay for it. Do you know who this is? This is the only person who ever got away from a bad place. The bad people are offering a lot to get them back. Tell them. Tell them! If I give you the part, you have to promise never to come back here. Of course I'm coming back. You're going to be my helper. That was years ago. I work here now. Cleaning special parts? Is that how your kids should see you? It's better than hunting bad people! You think that I like spending my time with bad people like them? I have work to do. Please! Don't turn away from me again. We can get the old ship back. You won't want that ship after you see it. Why not? The bad people took parts from it. Every part. The engines? They're gone. I'll give you the part... but after that, I want you to leave. What do you plan to do now? Get that part and put it in. And then? I suppose you'll turn me over to the bad people. They'll hurt me with their weapons. And you'll get your money. But it won't get you the old ship back. What are you trying to say? A person came to a place. \"The bad people took your ship. They hurt your friendship with your family member,\" said a friend. \"What did you get?\" \"Some money,\" replied the person. \"That does not seem fair,\" said the friend. \"I had no choice. If I did not give them the money, they would kill me,\" explained the person.\n\n\"Have you been on the bad person's ship before?\" asked the friend. \"Two times. Why?\" replied the person. \"Let me out of here,\" demanded the person. \"I cannot do that,\" said the friend.\n\n\"It is too hot!\" cried the person. \"If I make it cooler, the medicine will harden,\" explained the friend. \"I do not want your medicine! Open the door!\" yelled the person. \"You will feel better soon,\" assured the friend. \"Open it!\" screamed the person. \"This will only take a little time. Your sickness is getting worse. If we do not treat it, it could badly hurt you,\" warned the friend. \n\n\"You said it could kill me!\" cried the person. \"Stay away!\" The friend said, \"One shot of medicine is all I ask.\" \"Okay, you can go. The code to open the door is 4-2-8-6-4. I cannot treat people who do not want it. 4-2-8-6-4!\"\n\nA worker came. \"We were worried about you. Let's go back to the doctor,\" said the worker. \"I cannot go back. The doctor will not treat me,\" replied the person. \"How long has it been since you were with your mate?\" asked the worker. \"What?\" replied the person, confused. \"Let's go to the clean room,\" suggested the worker. \n\n\"My room would be better,\" said the person. The worker insisted, \"The doctor said we must go.\" In the clean room, the person said, \"Welcome. Our nation never forgets its enemies.\" \n\nAnother worker said, \"What about my payment?\" \"Some money. We agreed on more,\" replied the first worker. \"Did we? That money is for bad things. I hope you like it,\" sneered the second worker. \n\n\"We are being called by another ship,\" announced the first worker. \"Let them come in,\" said Alice. \"I see them,\" said Emma. \"Going that way,\" said Cameron. \"Take us there,\" Emma said. \"Be ready.\" \"Where do you think you'll go, little one?\" said Cameron. \"There is no other place to go to,\" he said. \"They won't get away,\" said Alice. \"Stop moving,\" Emma said. \"Should I get ready to fight?\" said Cameron. \"No,\" said Alice. \"I want them here,\" she said. \"I see them. Not far away,\" said Alice. \"What about the others?\" said Emma. \"They are coming too,\" said Alice. \"Get ready to fight back!\" said Emma. \"Get them over here,\" said Alice. \"They are not making it easy,\" said Cameron. \"Matthew?\" said Emma. \"I'm doing my best,\" he said. \"They are well protected,\" said Matthew. \"Got it!\" he said. \"Bring them in,\" said Emma. \"Their weapons are gone,\" said Alice. \"And the others?\" said Emma. \"Safe and sound,\" said Cameron. \"Let's go home,\" said Alice. \"The bad thing is gone from you now,\" said Zachary. \"The problem is over now,\" he said. \"Did I do something bad?\" asked Emma. \"People have been worse to me,\" said Zachary. \"Did we?\" asked Emma. \"We don't talk about those things,\" said Zachary. \"Please don't tell anyone,\" he said. \"I won't tell anyone,\" said Emma. \"Was it hard?\" asked Emma. \"What about the others?\" she asked. \"We hurt one of them. They are going home,\" said Cameron. \"Where is Victoria?\" asked Emma. \"She is with Zachary,\" said Cameron. \"What happened?\" asked Emma. \"It's a long story,\" said Cameron. Someone is calling Emma. \"I see you made it back OK,\" they said. \"Do you think they know you helped me?\" Emma asked. \"I don't think so,\" they said. \"What will you do now?\" they asked. \"I'm not sure,\" said Emma. \"If you know of an old ship for sale...\" \"I'll look out for one,\" they said. \"Be careful,\" they said. \"They might come after you again.\" \"No promises,\" said Emma.", "hash": "b5a9988647499ff71b3cacb11e14e7fe62f2855c62877712a6fe498552085417"}

For learning to be a doctor like my parent.\n\nYou need to go to school to learn to be a doctor. And there is not one in this small town. I'll learn on my own.\n\nYes, but you're on a farm here and on a farm, girls help with the animal births. You don't need to learn for that.\n\nSibling! Apparently my parent would never have done that. But my parent's gone and they left the farm to me. I feed you now!\n\nHelper, you're the worker, remember? Take the Miss's box upstairs. You want to listen to music? We can't, we're sad. You're mad. Not so loud! Adam was bored. \"Come on, move,\" Adam said. \"I am moving,\" Benjamin replied.\n\n\"We need partners!\" Adam said.\n\"What for?\" Benjamin asked.\n\"What do you mean, what for?\" Adam said. \"I'm not interested in finding a husband,\" Benjamin said.\n\"You say that now!\" Adam replied.\n\"No man will ever order me around,\" Benjamin said.\n\"You know nothing about love, you'll see,\" Adam said.\n\"That's not love,\" Benjamin replied.\n\n\"Cameron, look...\" Adam said, pointing at a book. \"It's disgusting!\"\n\"It certainly is!\" Benjamin agreed.\n\"He sees women in NE city every week,\" Adam said.\n\"Mom thinks he goes to the bank,\" Benjamin replied.\n\"I can't stand your brother,\" Adam said.\n\"What do women see in him?\" Benjamin asked.\n\"He's handsome, he's rich,\" Adam replied. \"He's the king...\"\n\"The king of bumpkins!\" Benjamin exclaimed.\n\nA new girl named Charlotte arrived from the FR country.

Very kind. \"Hello, everyone!\" I know, he was a good man. \"Hello, Uncle Xavier, how are you?\" \"Hello, dears.\" How pretty you are! \"Hello, Madison.\" You're Patrick's daughter? \"You're his brother.\" I saw you in the family book. You were much younger. \"I haven't changed, since you knew me.\" \"Let's eat!\" You don't look like an uncle. Is that why you didn't get married after your wife died? So he left taking his pet... How old are you now, Emma? Sixteen. Haven't you thought of asking? Think about it. Before someone else does. Come off it! After lunch they play cards. Let's go for a walk. I feel dizzy. I'll wait for you outside. Leaving already? I haven't been in town for ages. \" I miss it.\" \" You don't like the farm? \" Farm life's not for me.\" \" You're always welcome here.\" Thank you. You're very pretty. I'd have loved a daughter like you. A daughter or a wife? What do you think? \"When we were together in the small house.\" \"But you're marrying him.\" \"I can't do it if you aren't there.\" \"Stop it!\" \"What do you want?\" \"Do you know?\" \"It's all over!\" \"We won't see each other any more?\" \"We won't, will we?\" \"Stop it, you're crazy!\" \"Go on...\" \"Like with the little animals.\" \"Where's Emma?\"", "hash": "aa7c9a1cedc46d6f9ac6a4a8ca74df14f6ccfdea15fa5b14b3949539e856797c"}
{"text": "It was not good. For a long time, we had peace in the NE area. I knew the Davids were going to be trouble when they missed the group party last month. I did not understand. They gave big candy bars for Halloween. So what? Not big candy bars, Rachel - huge candy bars. We have been giving out big candy bars for years now. And then those people move in and throw the whole balance of the area off. They made everybody look silly. It is very embarrassing. I think we have to do something about this - maybe go to the owners group. Two Halloweens ago, someone painted the Patricks' small dog orange and nobody went to the owners group then. Well, everybody hated Taco. I think you are making too much of this. I saw Mae David at a store two weeks before Halloween. She had time to bring it up then, and nothing - not a word. I think it might be time to go after their ball machine. Their ball machine? They have a ball machine on their tennis place that is very loud and not normal. Flying, thumping balls all over the place. Flying, thumping what all over the place? Balls. You are four. And balls are funny. Don't worry, Grace. If the owners group doesn't do anything, we'll take this to the neighbors, get a paper going. Or if that doesn't work, you could throw some hoods on and burn a big Mars bar on their front yard. Huge, Rachel - huge. So, how's work, Grandpa? Look how smoothly she changes the subject. Work is lovely, Nora. How's school? Crazy. She's taking too many classes. I am not. How many are you taking? Five. Is five a lot? It's not a lot. It is a lot. I took five classes when I was a young student. Nora takes after me. I like to be busy. Idle hands are the devil's playthings. That's actually the title of one of her classes. Please don't worry about me. She says to the mother and the grandmother. Are you done? Oh, yes, thank you. Good, because we have small cake for dessert. What? Well, they're serving big cakes over at the Davids' house. \"I cannot accept we are doing this.\" \"Well, you did tell her to treat us like any other catering service.\" \"\"I want you to do a test meal, Emma.\" \"After all, you are a new company.\"\" \"She must be so happy right now.\" \"She has likely been laughing all morning.\" \"It will be easy.\" \"You wait and see.\" \"Three hours of serving.\" \"We are not going to be serving.\" \"We are going to be serving and pleasing.\" \"Anything to embarrass me, anything at all.\" \"Wow!\" \"You grew up here?\" \"I promise, if she makes me wear a uniform...\" This is a large house. Is there a ditch?\" Just help me out here, okay? Help me whenever you can. I promise. May I help you? Hi. We are the caterers. We are here for... The worker's entrance is around back. Was that a worker? Come on. What are all those balls doing over here? Learning sucks, everything here sucks, sucks, sucks! That yoga is really working for you. Don't get that, I mean it! Do not touch that phone! Oh, great, I'm glad you got that. It's been bugging me for the last... Is this the off-white or the cream? The off-white. The cream is more creamy. I cut those myself so they could be changed either way. I mean, they could be changed smaller. Taller would be harder once they're cut, but, if they tell a lie, they'll shoot right back up. I assume you'll have servers. Yes, we will. I assume you'll instruct your servers to omit the humor. Yes, we will. Okay, here we go. Now, we would start off with either the roasted healthy greens with the cheese or the three winter soups - vegetable soup, winter squash soup, and garlic soup. Very ambitious. And very tasty. I'll tell the servers not to do that either. Emma? Yes? My napkin. Oh, well, yes. Napkin, yes, your napkin. I got it. Do you want me to just tuck it in your shirt there or... My lap will be fine. \"There are many trees on the school yard.\" \"But this one fits my back perfectly so I don't get tired. The light is right, and it's far enough away from anything busy so that the noise level is perfect. It's quiet but not too quiet, and... and anyway, I was hoping that maybe\" \"you would let me keep my tree.\" \"No.\" \"Well...\" \"After you.\" \"Wow, this place looks nice.\" \"Yes, eating places are popular nowadays.\" \"Really?\" \"Very stylish.\" \"Very, very stylish.\" \" Excuse me.\" \" Yes?\" \"I believe I have a table for two.\" \"The name is Kevin.\" \"Kevin, yes.\" \"Okay.\" \"Follow me.\" \" How's this?\" \" Very good.\" \"Thank you.\" \" There's more where that came from.\" \" It's my lucky evening.\" \" Wow, I'm getting special treatment.\" \" Well, you did come.\" \"Yes, I did. I hear the food is excellent here. Coming, coming, coming. Mom. Were you sleeping? No. Then why are you in your nightclothes? These aren't pajamas. You wear that outside? Hi, Mom. Would you like to come in? You have the word \"juicy\" on your bottom. Well, if I had known you were coming over, I would have changed. Into what, a top with the word \"tasty\" on it? Hey, Mom, what can I do for you? I have to talk to you about something. Is everything okay? I'm afraid you can't cater the party after all. What? Why? Your father and I decided to go a different way, that's all. A different way? Now, I realize you've already spent some money. Yeah, we have. Of course, I will pay you back for all costs. Just give me the receipts. Great. That's it. That's all I came to tell you. Okay, well, thanks for the notice. You don't have to take that tone with me, Liam. Really, I don't? After you made us do that silly tasting at the house? You told me to treat you like any other company. Oh, but you sat there like a queen, making us jump through hoops and taking silly notes and for what - so you could fire us? \"You think Emma likes me?\" \"I think Emma likes you.\" \"You think Emma likes me.\" \"Help us all.\" \"No, just leave another note that I called.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Number 42, see you.\" \"You don't have to throw them all out, Sophia.\" \"I didn't.\" \"I've got twenty in the freezer.\" \"Great.\" \"And so do you.\" \"Even better.\" \"I already had that money saved.\" \"It was going towards a down payment on a safer car.\" \"Now little David will have to be careful rolling around in the back of Daddy's truck.\" \"Mom?\" \"Kitchen.\" \"Hold on, David! Daddy's coming to a sudden stop.\" You're being dramatic. But I'm so disappointed. I mean, all that planning, all that time, all that healthy food. I lost my spot. What? My spot, my study spot - it's gone. Someone took it. Someone took a spot? No, the spot's still there, but when I went there today, there was this guy sitting there reading magazines and he would not leave, so now I'm back where I started. You'll figure something out. Yes, I will figure out what my new job will be because now I can't study, I'm gonna fail out of the FR university and I'm gonna have to give up all hope of being a reporter. This is bad. You're telling me? I'm eating healthy tarts for the next four years. Well, what am I gonna do? You are gonna accept it. What? You're in college now, Rory. If your study plan doesn't work, then make another one. Just figure it out, but stop complaining because you're not two. And Sophia, in early times, kids traveled across the NE country in wagons and survived. Somehow I think little David will live without his van. Mom, why are you mad? I have something I have to do. I'll be back soon. And have these tarts out of here by the time I get home! Take a fork. Well, hello, Gabriel. Grace, you sure grew up good. Oh, did I, Gabriel? Thanks. Listen, why didn't you return my calls? 'Cause I hadn't seen you yet. Four times. You never called me back. I'll call you back now. \"Go slow and easy,\" said Henry. \"Okay,\" replied Emma.", "hash": "83a8a42d07524ea00eeea917c1ae93e8166c4c0a3a61afa0cc6be2d6271e086f"}
{"text": "It is very strong and hard to avoid. And it changes the lives of people, usually for the better. The bird flying with clear eyes, ready to hunt but not like a vulture. Noble, visionary, grand, that people can believe in and be inspired by, creating such an uplift that it soars. I can see that being a good symbol for the ethical business.\n\nOkay friends, enough nonsense. Businesses are artificial things made by people. You might say they're like big creatures trying to get as much profit as they can, no matter who gets hurt. I think of a whale - a gentle, big fish that could swallow you in an instant. The business that the person made has become stronger than them.\n\nThe word \"business\" gets used in a negative way, like it is an evil thing trying to take over the world. Personally, I don't use the word \"business\". I use the words \"job\" or \"company\". I will use the words \"job community\" because I think that is a much fairer way to talk about it than just using the word \"business\".\n\nIt's funny that I've taught at a job school for so long without ever being asked so directly to say what I think a business is. It is one way of owning a job...? It's a group of people working together to serve different things. The main one is earning large, growing, legal profits for the people who own the job.\n\nThe modern business grew out of the industrial age. The industrial age began in the late 18th century when an EN person invented a steam-powered pump to remove water from the coal mines so the coal miners could get more coal instead of carrying buckets of water out of the mine. It was all about getting more done per person-hour of work - more coal, more steel, more clothes, more cars, and today it's more chips, more gadgets. The system is basically the same system making more advanced products today.\n\nBusinesses played a big role in our lives for about the last century. Businesses were originally groups of people who were allowed by the country to do a certain thing, like a group that wanted to build a bridge. There were very few businesses allowed in the early NA country. A business can buy and sell things. It can borrow money. It can take someone to court or be taken to court. It can run a business. Many businesses are a part of our daily life. They are members of our world.\n\nBusinesses were given the rights of people who live forever. But they are a special kind of people with no feelings. These people are made by law to only care about their owners. And not others like the town or workers.  \n\nThe big problem with business people is that they are not like the rest of us. As someone once said, they have no soul to save and no body to put in jail.\n\nSome people think businesses are like us. Company X is an old man with lots of stories. Company Y is young and full of energy. Company Z is aggressive. But businesses only have one thing - to make as much money as they can. \n\nIt is good that they make money. That is what makes the business world work, to give us more things we want. That is something other ways of doing business lack.\n\nPeople say we only care about money because that is what business people think about. But we business people know we also want to help the environment and be seen as good members of the world.\n\nThere are businesses that do good for towns. They make things that make our lives better, and that is good. The problem is they always want to make more money, and there is no such thing as enough.\n\nEven people who live simply need support from someone. Everyone needs to make money. It is not just a business issue. But businesses are required by law to care most about making money for their owners over other things. A big company must make money for its owners. It does not need to follow rules or help people. The company only cares about getting bigger and richer. It will make others pay for any bad things it does. Economists call this \"paying on the side.\" For example, a company will let others protect the oil it uses or build the roads for its vehicles. The company just wants to make money and does not want to deal with other problems. A company is like a shark - it is made to do one thing well without thinking if it is bad or good. The company must make money now for its owners. It will do bad things if no one stops it. Here is an example:\n\nA woman made this shirt for $0.03. The shirt costs $14.99. Another woman made this jacket for $0.74. The jacket costs $178. Xavier and Zachary were talking. \"Cars cost $0.31 an hour,\" said Zachary. \"It's not just shoes. It's not just clothes. It's everything,\" Xavier said.\n\n\"We went to the HO country,\" Zachary continued. \"Some workers knew what we did. They asked to meet with us about how bad the factory was. We agreed, but we couldn't just walk into a factory and talk to workers in that part of the world. There are guards and spies. We had to do it secretly.\"\n\n\"We were about to meet, but three tough-looking men came in. The company found out about our meeting and sent spies. We couldn't have the meeting. But the young girls were smart. As they left, where the spies couldn't see, they put something under the table. I put my hand there, and they gave me their pay stubs. Now I knew who they were, what they were paid, and which brands they made.\"\n\n\"After everyone left, I looked at what was in my hand. It had Nora's face on it. At the bottom it said: 'Part of the money from selling this will go to help children.' But the people who gave it to me were 13 years old.\"\n\n\"Do many people in your family work here?\" Zachary asked one girl.\n\"Just me,\" she said.\n\"How many people do you support?\"\n\"Eight people.\"\n\"Is your pay enough?\"\n\"No.\"\n\n\"But think of it this way,\" Xavier said. \"People in places like BA country and CH country are starving. The only thing they have is cheap labor. They're saying to the world, 'Hire us for $0.10 an hour. That's enough for us not to starve.' When a big company comes, it's like a gift to them.\"\n\nJust then, a voice shouted, \"You can't be here!\" The door had been open. Adam said, \"No no no no no.\" \nBella said, \"Those are my clothes.\" \nAdam said, \"This is not your clothes.\"  \nBella said, \"Why your camera!\"\nAdam said, \"Don't touch the girl.\"\nBella said, \"Why!\"\nAdam said, \"This is a private place.\"\nBella said, \"Without asking how can you come here?\"\nAdam said, \"Yes the door was open.\"\nBella said, \"The doors are for workers not for you.\"\nAdam said, \"We looked in the trash in the DR country.\"\nAdam said, \"We always do this. We dig around.\"\nAdam said, \"One day we found papers about prices.\"\nAdam said, \"They don't talk about minutes. They talk about very small times.\"\nAdam said, \"They give the workers a short time to make the shirt.\"\nAdam said, \"It's a small amount of money per hour in the DR country.\"\nAdam said, \"That short time equals a very small amount.\"\nAdam said, \"These are the papers.\"\nAdam said, \"The wages are a tiny part of the price.\" \nAdam said, \"This is how it works.\"\nAdam said, \"What happens when the wages get too high?\"\nBella said, \"The people are no longer poor.\"\nAdam said, \"So okay. We used up all the poor people there. They are healthy and have money now.\"\nAdam said, \"Let's move to the next poor group and employ them and raise their level up.\"\nBella said, \"The idea is that companies coming will help the communities.\"\nAdam said, \"But countries must give more helps for companies to come.\"\nAdam said, \"The workers rarely make enough money to buy food let alone help their community.\"\nAdam said, \"Something happened in the late 20th century which was important.\"\nAdam said, \"The ability to make new chemicals that never existed before.\"\nAdam said, \"Oil companies made new chemicals from oil for any purpose and at almost no cost.\"\nAdam said, \"Fabrics, brushes, tires, insecticides, cosmetics, weed killers. Many things to make life better.\" Early in the day, someone wanted to go to a shop and say, \"Look, I want a chemical, like a bug spray, that will last a long time in the food chain. I don't want to have to renew it very often.\" \"I want it to be hard to destroy. Then the shopkeeper drew two rings on the board and added some parts to make a special bug spray!\"\n\nWhen the army needed help from civilians in another country, they asked local doctors to use the bug spray under the army's watch. This helped stop sickness. \"Using this bug spray goes a long way in stopping disease, even though it makes dust.\"\n\nAs more and more chemicals were made, people saw that some could be bad. At first there were just small stories, but over time there was more proof that these man-made chemicals in our workplaces, products, air, and water could cause cancer and birth defects. Some companies knew about this but tried to hide the risks.\n\nIf someone shoots you, that's a crime. If someone exposes you to chemicals that they know will kill you, what's the difference? The only difference is that it takes longer to kill you.\n\nNow there is a big cancer problem, and companies are largely responsible for this huge amount of cancer cases.\n\nLate one year, a box of files arrived without showing where they came from. Inside were tests showing that cows given a certain drug had problems like swelling in their heart, lungs, kidneys, and other issues. \n\nThe drug company had said there were no problems and they didn't use antibiotics, but the files showed they lied.\n\nAn independent study said the drug causes \"unnecessary pain, suffering, and distress for the cows.\" It's a silly product since we already have too much milk. We really have some places that pay farmers not to make milk. \"So the first thing A company makes is something that makes more of what we don't need.\" \"Of course you'll want to put Something in every cow you can because each cow that doesn't get it is money you don't get.\" \"But using the thing caused problems for the cows.\" \"It caused an infection called mastitis which hurts the cow's udders very much.\" \"When you milk the cow if it has bad mastitis, some of the infection gunk ends up in the milk.\" \"And the bacteria count inside the milk goes up.\" \"There's a cost to the cows.\" \"The cows get sicker when they get That Thing.\" \"They get medicine.\" \"We know people are getting medicine through food and we know that causes bacteria that can't be stopped by medicine.\" \"And we know it's bad when someone goes to a hospital and gets sick and can't be cured and dies.\" \"That's bad.\" \"Bad for the cow\" \"Bad for the farmer\" \"Bad maybe for the person eating it\" \"We're not sure if it's bad for your health.\" \"And of course I think why should I take any chance?\" People on farms have not been the only ones hurt by A company's things. Big parts of a country were cleared of trees by soldiers using A company's weed killer. The bad weed killer reportedly caused over 50000 babies to be born sick and hundreds of thousands of cancers in people and soldiers in that country and in soldiers from here who were there. Unlike people from that country, soldiers from here were able to take A company to court for making them sick. A company paid $80 million but never said it did anything wrong. Sleeping in a small town one night, I woke up with bad hay fever and my eyes were burning. And I looked out at the river and there were big piles of white foam going right down the river. And the next morning I got up and I said \"What was that happening last night?\" They said \"Oh that's just the river.\" And I said \"what do you mean?\" They said \"Don't you understand? That's how we get rid of the dirty stuff from the paper mills.\" \"Well I knew at that time I had been in the work.\" \"I had sold goods to the factories.\" \"I knew all the owners.\" \"I had been in town groups.\" \"I knew the people in the towns.\" \"I knew no one who worked at the factories wanted to have the river dirty.\" \"And yet here the river was being dirty.\" \"And it was more or less as if we made a bad machine.\" \"In our search for money and good lives we made something that's going to ruin us.\" \"The traders who work in the market are not people who care about the earth.\" \"They're seeing money and they're making money.\" \"Workers don't stop working with things because it goes against their beliefs or rules about the earth.\" \"No.\" \"There are times when you think about it but it's for a little bit.\" \"It's like yeah oh yeah yeah well a town is being dirty down there in another place but hey this person needs to buy some things.\" \"I'm getting paid money too.\" \"Our information that we get does not have anything about the earth because until the earth becomes a thing we buy or sell then we will not have anything to do with that.\" \"It doesn't come into our minds at all.\" \"It's so far away and you hardly hear anything about it.\" \"I mean keep in mind there are bad things going on right near us too.\" \"We trade live animals.\" \"I mean there are so many pigs in one state and they're making the rivers dirty but how often do you find out about that?\" \"At a group we've put together a list of the top bad companies from the late 20th century.\" \"We looked at all the fines that companies had paid in that time.\" \"A big company pled guilty to charges and paid a big fine. Another company was guilty and paid a fine. Another company was guilty of earth rules and paid a fine. Another company was guilty and paid a fine. Another company was guilty of rules and paid a fine. Another company was guilty of earth rules. Another company was guilty of rules. Another company was guilty of food rules. Another company was guilty of...\" \"Again and again we have the problem that whether you follow the rules or not is about whether it costs less money. If the chance of getting caught and the penalties are less than it costs to follow rules, people think of it as just a work decision.\" Drawing a picture of early tries to fly. \"Thomas went off of a very high cliff in his airplane with the wings moving and the people moving the wings and the wind is in his face and this poor person thinks they're flying but in fact they are falling\" \"and they just don't know it yet because the ground is so far away but of course the craft is doomed to crash.\" \"That's the way our world is. The very high cliff shows the resources we seem to have when we began this journey.\" \"The craft isn't flying because it's not built by the rules of flying and is pulled down by gravity.\" \"Our world is not flying because it's not built by the rules of flying for worlds that would fly.\" \"And of course the ground is still a long way away but some people have seen that ground rushing up sooner than the rest of us have.\" \"The wise people have seen it and have told us it's coming.\" \"Every science paper published in the last 25 years shows this is true.\" \"Every living thing on earth is in trouble. Everything that keeps life going on earth is in trouble. All of these together are the place that keeps and feeds all of life, not just our life but perhaps 30 million other kinds of life\" \"that share this planet with us.\" \"The typical business of the 20th century took things from the earth, wasted, and was mean, taking from the earth, making, wasting, sending its things back to the earth, waste to a big pile...\" \"I was amazed to learn just how much stuff the earth has to make for our business to make a dollar of money.\" \"When I learnt I was shocked.\" \"We are leaving a terrible thing of poison and making the environment worse for our grandchildren's grandchildren, children not yet born.\" \"Some people have called that taking from children not yet born who can't say no.\" \"It's the wrong thing to do.\" It is okay for a person to be nice and kind. But when they do bad things for their job, it makes them look like monsters. A CEO may care about the environment, but still need to make tough choices that hurt people or the planet. \n\nOne time, protestors hung a banner on Alice's house calling her a murderer. They had masks and danced around. Alice and her husband talked to them for a while. The protestors said the problem was not Alice, but the big company she worked for. \n\nAlice explained that the company is made of people like her. She cares about climate change and human rights like the protestors do. The difference is she can try to make things better from inside the company. The protestors feel like they cannot do anything.\n\nSo even though a CEO seems powerful, they cannot always do what they want because of their job duties. They need to make hard choices that can hurt people or the planet sometimes. \"The company is not a person. It does not think,\" said Adam. \"People in it think, and for them, it is okay to make bad technology.\"\n\"So that farmers cannot save their seeds,\" said Bella. \"Seeds that will destroy themselves. Seeds that only grow plants for one season.\" \n\"You really need to have a cruel mind,\" said Cameron. \"It's a war against nature to even think like that.\"\n\"But clearly, profits are very important in their minds,\" said Diana.\n\"The desire for profit that made David successful may also cause bad things...\" said Ethan.\n\"Hello?\" said Frank.\n\"I work for many companies,\" said Gabriel. \"I have worked for about 25% of the big companies.\"\n\"I pretended to be an investment person. I pretended to be a business person. I set up fake companies that find workers for other companies.\"\n\"I am a spy,\" said Henry. \"I will find your workers and tell them I am from a company finding people for jobs that pay more than their current jobs. Would they meet me for an interview?\"\n\"And when the worker comes, he does not know I am really getting information from him for another company. There is no job, and this office is only for tricking him. My family picture is not real. It's all a trick to get information from him.\"\n\"I don't feel bad. You have to expect people like me are out there. We are predators. It's about competition, making more money, and being aggressive.\"\n\"If you are the boss, do you think your investors really care if you are a good person? Do they want you to be nice, or to make them money? I think people want money.\"\n\"The fact that most of these companies are run by rich white men means they don't understand most of the world. Most of the world is not rich white men. They are people of other races, women, and poor people.\"\n\"So the decisions they make are not based on the real world. How much money is enough? If you are a billionaire, would it be okay to only have half a billion dollars?\" People lived together and helped each other in the old days. There were rules to keep things fair. People shared the land and farmed together. The land did not belong to anyone. It belonged to God. The church and leaders took care of God's land.\n\nLater, leaders made laws to take the shared lands and make them private property. They also made rules about the oceans and air. Leaders did this to use the lands, oceans, and air for business.\n\nSome people think things are only valuable if they are owned privately. But clean water, fresh air, and a safe place are also valuable. Taking public things and making them private is not creating value, it is taking value away.\n\nIn the past, we made some things public for safety, like fire fighters. Fire fighters used to be private companies. They would only help people who paid them. We made fire fighters public so everyone could be safe. We should not take public things like fire fighters and make them private again.\n\nWhen leaders make public things private, they give the public thing to a powerful group that no one can control. This is not good. Public things have many good sides. They may plan to lose money. They are not for profit. They may plan to lose money because of the good sides. For example, if a public steel company loses money, it gives cheap steel to other companies. Maybe that is a good thing.\n\nPublic things can keep jobs in bad times. This helps demand and gets out of bad times. Private companies cannot do that in bad times. They fire workers to make money.\n\nSome people want everything owned by someone. Not just goods, but also human rights, human services, and things needed for life. Education, public health, help, pensions, and housing. Also the survival of the planet. The things that must be kept for all or we will all die. Water and air.\n\nFor air, there is progress. People trade permits for pollution. They cannot stop pollution now, so they set a limit. They give permits for that amount to polluters. Permits can be traded. Now there is a price for polluting.\n\nIt sounds strange to own everything. But it means the interests in things are owned by groups who want to maintain them. That is the solution to problems.\n\nImagine a company owned the song \"Happy Birthday\". It asked for a lot of money to use the song in a film. We chose to use the money for our story instead.\n\nComparing old and new marketing is like comparing a toy gun to a real gun. It is not the same as when I was a child or even when the adults now were kids. It is much more complex and much more common. It is not that things themselves are bad or good. It is the idea of tricking kids into buying the things. In the late 20th century a study on nagging was done. They asked parents to keep a diary for three weeks and to write down every time their child nagged them for a thing. This study was not to help parents cope with nagging. It was to help companies help kids nag for their things more effectively. Anywhere from 20 percent to 40 percent of buys would not have happened unless the child had nagged their parents. That is we found for example a quarter of all visits to fun parks would not have happened unless a child nagged their parents. Four out of ten visits to noisy places with many kids would not have happened. Any parent would understand that you think \"Why would I want to spend two hours there?\" But if the child nags enough you will go. We saw the same thing with shows, videos, and fast food. We do have to break through this where they do tell us they don't like it when their kid nags. Well that's just a feeling they have. It doesn't mean they act on it every time. You can trick people into wanting and buying your things. It's a game. Kids are not little adults; their minds are not grown. And what's happening is that the marketers are using their weaknesses. The ads kids are exposed to now are made by experts; it's enhanced by new media tech. The more you know about the person the more creative you'll be in your ads. So if that takes an expert, we want one. I'm not saying it's wrong to make things for kids. I also think it's important to know about experts who work on things for kids to help toy companies make toys that are good for how kids grow. I think that's great, that's different from selling the toys directly to the kids. Starting things is huge. I think in the US we place about $12 billion of media time. So we put it on TV, we put it in print, we put it up outside, we buy radio time; so we're the biggest buyers of advertising time and space in the US and in the world. A good place to start is by building a place that shows your brand. For a company like Disney, it goes even further where it builds a town, Celebration in the FL country. Currently there are about 5000 people who call Celebration home. And there are about 1300 single-family homes, a town center that is a place where people gather. It has about four or five places to eat and about a dozen other shops. Their inspiration and brand image is the all-AM country family. And the sort of old AM country town. Their brand idea is family magic and everything the company does is about those two words. A branded place such as a Disney park is an extension of that brand. Family-oriented film; it is a logical extension of that. As a business, they also know that if they want to do other types of entertainment that does not fit family magic, they do not brand it Disney. If they want to do adult, more serious types of film, they brand it something else. The Disney brand speaks of being safe, it speaks of tradition, it speaks of quality. And you can see that in this community that was built. And that is where you see the big hopes of branding, which is about building these private branded places. Which maybe you start by shopping in and then you continue by going on holiday in, but eventually why not just move in? You hear that sound and you remember it. Maybe later you will think about that sound. Now you go to your office and there is a certain brand of water in the fridge. You take it out and drink it. \"Wow! That's pretty good water,\" you say. Maybe someone left the water there. You go out for your lunch break. You sit in the park and people are talking. You hear another message. By the time you go to bed, you've heard eight or nine different messages. People always think \"I know about product placement in movies!\" Yes, that's one kind of product placement. But real product placement happens in your life. \n\nSome people like you are doing something for us, like having a certain drink or using a certain cleaning product. They are like the roach motel. People will come to them and they will give them a small piece of brand information. It could be a fact or a ritual. You will get that information and take it. \"Oh, pretty cool!\" you say. Then you go tell your friends. You can be critical of every person who comes up to you, if you want. But if they are showing you something that works and makes your life better, well then it's okay. We just say thanks!\n\nToday, there are no new places to explore in our country. So where are the new opportunities? What's ahead for you and your kids? The new frontiers are not on any map. They are in the test tubes and labs of the big companies. The Chakrabarty case was very important. But the public did not know it was happening. GE company and Mr. Chakrabarty went to the patent office with a tiny bug that eats up oil spills. \"We were told to be the investigators,\" said Adam. \"We could ask tough questions and get answers. It sounded like a dream job.\"\n\n\"The first thing they had us do was shoot a promo,\" said Alice. \"They had a film crew with a smoke machine. We were silhouetted in darkness.\"\n\n\"One story Benjamin found was about milk being changed by a new chemical,\" said Charlotte. \"I didn't know how well a big company could get something new sold. They had to get experts, reporters, and even the government to say it was safe.\" \n\n\"The chemical is now sold to help cows make more milk,\" a farmer said. \"It's been tested more than any other product.\"\n\n\"But the tests were not very good,\" said David. \"They only tested it on 30 rats for 90 days. Studies showed it could be unsafe, but the government ignored that.\"\n\n\"We were worried there were secrets being kept,\" said Emma. \"We were pushed to say the new chemical was safe, even though it might cause harm.\"\n\nWe had the story ready to share with everyone. But then a lawyer for the big company sent a letter saying many false things. They tried to scare us from sharing the truth. A group decided to check a story again before publishing it. There were no factual errors in the story, and both sides had a chance to speak. Later, a large company sent a strongly worded letter, saying there would be bad consequences if the story aired in a certain area. \n\nThe media company was afraid of being sued and losing advertising money from that company and its many products. The new general manager, Adam, asked the journalists if they would be okay with not running the story. They said they wouldn't be happy about that. Adam struggled with the decision but eventually said they had to make changes to the story that the lawyers wanted, even if the information wasn't true.\n\nThe journalists objected, saying it was important news people wanted to know. Adam bluntly stated that since the company had paid a lot of money for the TV stations, they decide what the news is. When the journalists refused to present the altered story, Adam threatened to fire them for insubordination. The journalists said they would report being fired for refusing to lie on public airwaves. \"Well, one day went by and we did not hear anything,\" said Adam. \"About a week later, the person called us back and we changed our plan.\"\n\n\"How about if we give you some money and you go away?\" the person asked.\n\n\"How much money?\" Adam said. \"When somebody tries to bribe you, I always want to know if it is worth it.\"\n\nThe person wanted to give Adam and his friend the money they would have earned that year if they agreed not to talk about what happened. They could not talk about the story or take it to another place. They could not speak about it anywhere, even at their child's school meetings.\n\nAdam's friend wrote down what the person said and sent it to them. But Adam and his friend did not want to sign it.\n\nThe person said, \"Okay, we cannot buy you or stop you from talking. Let's put the story on the air in a way we all agree with.\" \n\nThey started rewriting and editing the story with the person's helpers. During this time, the helpers wanted to remove words like \"cancer\" and change any criticism of the company or its product.\n\nThey changed the story many times, over and over. This does not usually happen. It seemed like they did not want to put the story on the air. They may have wanted Adam and his friend to quit or wait until they could fire them.\n\nIn the end, Adam wrote a letter to the person's helper, whose name was Caroline. Adam said this was not about being fired for no reason. People who work for big companies often do what bad governments tell them to do. They like it when governments control people and stop those who disagree. In the past, many companies liked certain governments in Europe. Those companies made more money when those governments were in power. The companies kept working with those governments, even after a big war started. \n\nSome companies made special drinks to sell to people in those countries during the war. Other companies helped those governments keep track of people. They used special cards with holes punched in them to store information about people. The holes showed what kind of person they were and what happened to them. They would punch that number in, and the items were counted, and the machines were set up. And of course, the millions of punch cards had to be printed. And they were printed only by a big company, and the profits were made after the big war. Some people say that company helped a bad group, but that may not be true. They used machines, which is a fact, but how they got them and how much help they got is unclear. Generally, you sell machines, and they are used in different ways, and you hope they are used in good ways. If you found out they were used in bad ways, you would hope you would stop helping them, but you do not always know. Can you always find out? \n\nThat company would say they had no control over their groups in another country. But here, a letter was written with details of the activity of that country's group. None of these machines were sold. They were all rented by the company. They had to be fixed once a month, even at camps. This is a typical contract between the company and that country, made in a year.\n\nAs it happens, an old man from the company knew that story. He said the company's leader knew that the bad group used punch cards. He probably knew because he had few customers. The leader did not want to do it, not because he thought it was bad, but because he thought it was risky. \n\nIt should not surprise us that companies will care more about profits than countries. A report showed many companies were fined for trading with bad groups, including terrorists and bad leaders.\n\nYou can locate any group somewhere between being good and being bad. This man studies these things. For one thing, avoid thinking that the form of government can protect a nation from being bad. For big companies, being bad was often useful for getting markets and profits.\n\nOne general helped bad groups in many countries for companies like oil companies, banks, sugar companies, fruit companies, and oil companies. A long time ago, a famous leader named David wanted to help people. Many people liked David. But some powerful groups did not like David's plans. They tried to make a plan to stop David. They wanted Adam, a general, to help with their plan. But Adam did not want to do bad things. Adam told the government about the plan. \n\nThe government found out that the plan was real. Some big companies were part of the plan. These companies were very powerful. Now, companies are even more powerful than governments. Companies and their leaders have a lot of power and influence.\n\nKevin went to a meeting with the government and companies. Kevin saw that the government and companies were working together closely. It was hard to tell them apart. \"As many people in a large area came together to make an important agreement about things people use and need, lots of people from many groups joined to say they did not want it.\" \"The leaders of big companies did not listen to the people outside.\" \"For them, all the people in the area had the same voice.\" \"Some people were inside, and some were outside.\" \"That's how it was.\" \"What do you think when you see this?\"\n\n\"Well, I think it's too bad this happened.\" \"Should there be some way to make things fair?\" \"Yes. And big companies know that.\" \"But being fair means people like how they work and what they sell. If companies don't do good things, people won't buy from them. No company wants that.\"\n\n\"There are new kinds of people now.\" \"These people aren't here because someone made them come. Or because they read about being good to everything.\" \"Their inner voice says: 'Listen to your heart.'\"\n\"My inner voice says: 'Love everyone.'\"\n\"My inner voice says: 'I want a good meal.'\"\n\n\"They're here because they understand. Being here helps them sell more things. That's why they're here.\" \"I'm listening to your worries. I worry about the earth. I worry about dirt. I don't have all the answers, but we want to work with you, with groups, with leaders, to make it better. So you trust us again. The goal is to be the company people like best.\"\n\nA man thinks we can get almost half our energy from things like the wind and sun one day. Some people call him silly names. And some people call me silly names too. I work to make plans for a big company.\n\nI ask myself often: Why do many companies say they will be good? I'm not sure it's because they really want to be good, but because they want people to see they are good. But who am I to judge? It's better they say they'll be good than not say it.\n\nBeing good is not a big change, because it's something they choose to do now. A way to sell more things. And if selling more things changes, they can stop being good. One day you see a kind animal, next day you see a mean monster.\n\nHow do you define being a good company? Long ago, some people worked hard to help all living things. Adam and friends took a big government and a big company to court over something called Neem. They won the case. Alice and friends won against a company's claim on rice. They showed that the company was wrong, not the poor people around the world. \n\nLong ago, a good man walked to the beach and picked up salt. He said nature gives salt for free and we will keep making salt. In IN city, people believe saving seeds is important for the earth and future children. They will keep saving seeds even if it breaks the law.\n\nSaving your own seeds and not buying harmful sprays leads to more money for farmers. Adam and friends found ways to help people instead of companies. There are many ways to address problems with big companies. But most important is having a better vision.\n\nOur modern way of life is not good for the earth. Even the best companies are harming nature. The first industrial revolution is flawed and cannot last forever. By current standards, someone may be called a hero. But really, they are harming the earth. Adam said, \"I hope.\" Benjamin said, \"I'm part of the rope.\" Cameron said, \"And they also believe that when people watch my things or maybe watch this famous drama or whatever, they think that you know, you know, you know, they'll watch this and they won't do anything because we've done such a good job of numbing their minds and making them less intelligent. You know they'll never do anything...\" David said, \"People aren't going to leave the church and do something political.\" Ethan said, \"They're convinced of that.\" Frank said, \"I'm convinced of the opposite.\" Gabriel said, \"I'm convinced that a few people are going to leave this place or get up and do something, anything, and get this world back in our hands.\"", "hash": "df2de197c84f303f7e90b9065d59dd8af1daac38f963161dcea59e24c0176cb9"}
{"text": "Early in the morning, a mother and father clownfish were talking in their new home, a small cave near a drop off. The father fish had found this nice place for their family.\n\n\"When you said you wanted a nice view, you did not think you would get the whole ocean, did you?\" the father fish said.\n\n\"Oh yes,\" the mother fish said. \"A fish can breathe out here.\"\n\n\"Did your man deliver a good home, or did he deliver a good home?\" the father fish asked.\n\n\"My man delivered a good home,\" the mother fish said. \"And it was not so easy. Other clownfish wanted this place.\"\n\nThe mother fish looked around the cave. \"This place is awesome,\" she said.\n\nThen the mother fish said, \"But do we really need so much space?\"\n\n\"These are our kids we are talking about,\" the father fish said. \"They deserve the best place. Look, they will wake up and see big animals right by their window.\"\n\nThe father fish looked at their eggs. \"Shh, you will wake the kids,\" the mother fish said.\n\n\"Aw, look. They are dreaming,\" the father fish said. \"We still have to name them.\" \n\n\"You want to name all of them right now?\" the mother fish asked.\n\n\"OK, we will name this half after me and this half after you,\" the father fish said.\n\n\"I like Nemo,\" the mother fish said.\n\n\"We will name one Nemo,\" the father fish said. \"But I want most of them to have my name.\"\n\n\"In a few days, we are going to be parents,\" the father fish said.\n\n\"What if they do not like me?\" the mother fish asked.\n\n\"No, really. There are over 400 eggs. Some of them will like you,\" the father fish said. Alice and David were excited for the first day of school. \"What's the one thing we have to remember about the ocean?\" asked David. \"It's not safe,\" replied Alice. First, they checked to make sure the path was clear. They went out and back in. David thought maybe he would see a big fish at school. Alice doubted it. She had never seen one before. David said his friend told him that some sea animals live to be 100 years old. If he met one, he would ask it. \"Hold my fin,\" said David as they crossed the road. Alice didn't want him to act strangely like at the petting zoo. They wondered where to meet David's teacher. A group of other sea creatures greeted them. \"Matthew, right?\" one of them said to David. \"David,\" he corrected. They asked him to tell a joke since he was a clownfish. David said, \"There's a mollusk, see?\" A fish dad said, \"Do not touch the boat, Nemo.\" But Nemo touched it. The dad got mad. \"You are in big trouble,\" said the dad. Then a big wave came and took Nemo away. The dad shouted, \"Nemo! Nemo!\" He looked for Nemo but could not find him. A fish named Dory came. \"I saw a white boat go that way,\" she said, and showed the way to the dad. \"Thank you.\" \"Thank you, thank you so much.\" \"No problem.\" [Soft music playing] [Panting] \"Patrick: Hey...\" \"Wait!\" \"Will you quit it?\" \"What?\" \"I'm trying to swim here.\" \"The ocean isn't big enough for you?\" \"You got a problem, friend?\" \"Huh?\" \"Huh?\" \"You got a problem, friend?\" \"Huh?\" \"Huh?\" \"Do you?\" \"Do you?\" \"Do you?\" \"You want to fight me? Ooh, I'm scared now.\" \"What?\" \"Wait a minute. Stop following me, OK?\" \"What?\" \"You're showing me where the boat went.\" \"A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat. It passed by not too long ago. It went this way.\" It went this way. It went this way. Follow me.\" \"Wait a minute. What is going on? You already told me which way the boat was going.\" \"I did? Oh, no. If this is some kind of joke, it's not funny. And I know funny. I'm a clownfish.\" \"No, it's not. I know it's not. I'm so sorry. See, I forget things almost instantly. It runs in my family. At least, I think it does. Um, hmm. Where are they?\" \"Can I help you? Something's wrong with you - really. You're wasting my time. I have to find my child.\" [Gasps] \"Hello. Ohh. Well, hi! My name is Frank. It's all right. I understand. Why trust a shark, right?\" [Laughs] \"So, what are a couple of small fish like you doing out so late, eh? We're not doing anything. We're not even out.\" \"Great! Then how about you come to a small party I'm having? You mean, like a fun time? Yeah, right. A party. What do you say? I love parties. That sounds like fun.\" \"Parties are fun, and it's tempting, but\" \"Oh, come on, I insist.\" \"Patrick: OK. That's all that matters.\" \"Nora: Hey, look, balloons.\" Hello, friends. My name is Frank, and I'm a clownfish. A clownfish? Yes, that's right! Tell us a funny story, please. I do know a good one. There was this small animal, and it walked up to another animal. Usually, they don't talk, but in a story, everyone talks. So the small animal said to the other one...\n\n[Dramatic sounds]\n\nHenry! Henry! Ha ha! Henry! I don't understand. For a clownfish, he's not very funny.\n\nNo, no, no. Henry is my child. He was taken by some people. Oh my! You poor fish. People think they own everything. Probably from the FR country. \n\nNow, there is a father looking for his little boy. Now, there is a father looking for his little boy.\n\nWhat do these marks mean? [Cries] I never knew my father! Group hug. We're all friends here, friend.\n\nI can't read human words. We need to find a fish that can read this. Hey, look, big fish.\n\nNo, no, no, Grace! Guys, guys. No, Grace. That's mine. Give it to me. Ow! \n\nOh, I'm sorry. Are you OK? Ow, ow, ow. I'm so sorry. I hit you hard. Am I bleeding?\n\nOhh. Ow, ow, ow. Grace, are you OK? Ohh. Ohh, that's good.\n\nHelp! Remember, big fish, animals are friends, not food! Food! Grace, be careful! Food! Grace, be careful! Aah! I'm going to eat tonight! Hello, friends. A small fish was in the big blue ocean. It got lost and came to a new place. The new place had many other fish. The small fish was scared. \"Where is my dad?\" it asked. \"Your dad is probably back at the pet store,\" said another fish. \"Pet store?\" said the small fish. \"I am from the ocean!\" The other fish were surprised. \"The ocean! We must clean you!\" they said. They cleaned the small fish. Then the small fish told them what the ocean was like. \"It is big and blue,\" it said. The other fish were amazed. They had never seen the ocean before. They wanted to learn more about it. Adam and Diana saw a bright light. \"I feel happy to see it,\" Diana said. Adam said, \"Don't go near it.\" But Diana swam toward the light. \n\n\"Come back here,\" Adam called. Diana didn't listen. She sang, \"I'll swim with you, I'll be your friend.\"\n\nSuddenly, Adam felt scared. \"I can't see!\" he cried. Diana saw a mask and read the first line: \"P. Samuel.\"\n\n\"That doesn't make sense,\" said Adam. Diana read the second line: \"NM number.\"\n\nAdam yelled, \"Don't eat me!\" He was scared of the bright light. \"[Muffled sounds]\" \"Dory: \"Walla--walla--\"\" \"Marlin:\" \"Waah!\"\"Waah!\"\"Waah!\"\"Waah!\"\"Waah!\" \"Dory:\" \"The second line's '42 Wallaby Way'.\" \"Marlin:\" \"That's great.\" \"Read fast.\" \"Take a guess.\" \"No pressure.\" \"No problem.\" \"There's a lot of pressure.\" \"Pressure!\" \"Take a guess now with pressure!\" \"Sydney!\" \"It's Sydney!\" \"Duck!\" \"Dory:\" \"Aah!\" \"Marlin:\" \"I'm dead.\" \"I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.\" \"I died.\" \"I'm dead.\" \"[Sounds]\" \"[Happy sounds playing]\" \"[Marlin laughs]\" \"Whoo-hoo!\" \"We did it, we did it\" \"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah\" \"No eating here tonight, whoo!\" \"Both: Eating here tonight\" \"No, no, no, eating here tonight\" \"Dory.\" \"You on a diet\" \"Dory!\" \"What did the mask say?\" \"P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. [Gasps] I remembered what it said! I usually forget things, but I remembered it! Whoa, whoa, wait. Where is that? I don't know. But who cares? I remembered. Raar! Aah! Dory: P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. I remembered it again! [Loud sound blows]\" [Sound rings]\" Frank: Psst. Nathan. Nathan: Mmm... Suivez-moi. Follow me. [Exciting sounds playing]\" Fish: Sounds, Sounds, Sounds, Sounds, Sounds, Sounds, Sounds, Sounds, Sounds, Sounds, Sounds, Sounds, Sounds, Sounds, Sounds, Sounds, Sounds, Sounds. \"Hi, hi.\" \"You like funny acts?\" \"Mm-hmm.\" \"Just like in practice, friends.\" \"So what are we?\" \"Guess what I am.\" \"Oh, oh.\" \"I've seen one of those.\" \"I'm a fish with a long nose.\" \"Wait, wait, um\" \"\n\"It's a long-nosed fish!\" \"Leader:\" \"Hey, silly person, let the lady guess.\" \"Where's the butter?\" \"Ooh!\" \"It's on the tip of my tongue!\" \"Lobster.\" \"Saw that!\" \"Lots of legs!\" \"Live in the water.\" \"Clam!\" \"Close enough!\" \"They're good.\" \"Will somebody please give me directions?\" \"Ha ha ha ha ha!\" \"I'm serious!\" \"Thank you.\" \"Oh, dear.\" \"Hey! Hey, come back!\" \"Hey, what's wrong?\" What's wrong?\" While they're doing their silly little acts...I am far from home with a fish that can't remember her name! I bet that's frustrating. Meanwhile, my child is out there. Your child? But it doesn't matter because no fish...in this whole water is going to help me. Well, I'm helping you. Wait right here. Guys! Is he bothering you again? No, no. He's a good guy. Go easy on him. He's lost his child. Any of you heard of the big city Sydney? Sydney? Oh, sure! Ted here's got family in Sydney. Don't you, Ted? Sure do! Oh! Hey! They know Sydney! You wouldn't know how to get there, would you? You want to follow the big water flow. That's the big water flow from the east of this country. A big fish talks about looking for their child. The child fish swam away from their home and was taken by divers on a boat. The fish parent tried to stop them but could not. The parent fish then swam into the ocean after the boat. On the way, they met some scary sharks. The sharks almost attacked, but the fish parent scared them away. The fish parent kept swimming deep into the dark ocean, searching for the child. They finally saw a bright light from a huge creature with sharp teeth. But the fish parent kept swimming bravely to find their child. The fish parent has been swimming for days in the ocean currents, looking everywhere for their lost child. The other fish hope the parent fish will soon find their child in the big city. The parent fish is very dedicated to finding their child and will not stop looking until they do. \"Mooo...\" \"Ethan!\" \"This is not a cow.\" \"You sound sick.\" \"Maybe I should try a different animal sound.\" \"Don't.\" \"Maybe I should try a different animal sound.\" \"Don't.\" \"Woooo...\" \"You really sound sick.\" \"Maybe louder?\" \"Roar!\" \"Roar!\" \"Roar!\" \"Don't do that!\" \"Too loud.\" \"Didn't it sound like a big animal?\" \"It doesn't sound like any animal.\" \"It sounds strange.\" \"Oooooo!\" \"Oh!\" \"It's fine.\" \"That big animal might be hungry.\" \"It's fine. That big animal might be hungry.\" \"Big animals don't eat small fish. They eat tiny creatures.\" \n\nTINY CREATURES: \"Swim away!\"\n\n\"Oh look, tiny creatures! Move, Ethan, move!\" \"Move, Ethan, move!\" \"Aaah!\"\n\n\"Look at that water. It's dirty. All thanks to you, Ethan. You made the water dirty.\"\n\n\"Fiona, I said no cleaning. I'm embarrassed. Look! The dirty water made shapes!\"\n\n\"Ooh! Bubbles! I love bubbles!\" *coughing*\n\n\"Has anybody seen Fiona?\"\n\n\"It's time to go see the doctor.\"\n\n\"Hello, Olivia. Sorry I'm late. OK, here we go. Little Oliver needs to walk and put down the keys...\"\n\n\"Quentin, that's gross!\" \"It tastes good to me.\" *burp* \"Yuck! Don't you all realize we are swimming in the dirty water?\"\n\n\"Shh! Here comes the person!\"\n\n\"Aah! This water is very dirty.\" *squeaking sound*\n\n\"Olivia, what's my first appointment tomorrow?\" \"10 in the morning, dear.\" \"Leave it open, would you? I need to clean the fish tank before Yara comes.\"\n\n\"Did you hear that, Rachel? He's going to clean the tank! We'll be clean! Are you ready to see your dad? Of course you are. I'm sure he's waiting for you right now.\" A large animal was swimming. Two little fish were inside the animal. One fish said, \"We are inside a big animal. I must find my child and tell the child about old turtles.\" The other fish said, \"I can talk to the big animal. I will ask what is happening.\" The first fish said, \"No, do not do that. It will make things worse.\" Then the water started going down. The first fish was scared. The other fish said, \"Do not be scared. The big animal wants us to go to the back of its mouth.\" \"Wait.\" \"Where are you going?\" \"It's over, Grace.\" \"We were too late.\" \"Oliver's gone, and I'm going home now.\" \"No.\" \"No, you can't.\" \"Stop!\" \"Please don't go away.\" \"Please?\" \"No one's ever stuck with me for so long before.\" \"And if you leave, I just...\" \"I remember things better with you.\" \"I do.\" \"Look-- the street address...\" \"[Sighs] the address...\" \"I remember it.\" \"I do.\" \"It's there.\" \"I know it is because when I look at you...\" \"I can feel it.\" \"I look at you and I...\" \"I'm home.\" \"Please...\" \"I don't want that to go away.\" \"I don't want to forget.\" \"I'm sorry, Yara, but I do.\" \n\n[Sound of a nature scene]\n\n\"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"This is our spot! Get out of here!\" [Sounds of commotion]\n\n\"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"Yeah, that's it, friend. Just keep on moving.\" You got that. Too right, friend! Oh! I got someone here! Have you seen my parent? Got you!\n\n\"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" Hey! Come back here! You let them go!\n\n\"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" Parent! Parent! Parent! Parent! Parent!\n\n[Sounds of confusion]\n\nUm, excuse me. Are you all right? I don't know where I am. I don't know what's going on. I think I lost someone, but I can't remember.\n\nIt's OK. I'm looking for someone, too. Hey, we can look together. [Sniffles] I'm Yara. I'm Oliver.\n\nOliver? That's a nice name.\n\n[Sound of a bird]\n\nParent! Parent! Parent! Wait a minute. Is it your parent or my parent? My parent. Got it. Parent! Parent! Parent! Oh. The SY city. [Gasps] The street address, Sydney. Aah! Adam! It's you! You're Adam! Yes, I'm Adam! You were gone. I saw you. And here you are! I found you. You're not gone. And your father--Your father! You know my father? Where is he? This way! He went this way. Quick! Hey, hey, hey! Hey! Hey! Have you seen an orange fish swim by? It looks just like him! But bigger! Yeah, I saw him, bluey. But I'm not telling you where he went... and there's no way you're gonna make me. Mine. Aah! All right! I'll talk! He went to the FI grounds! Aah! Hey, look out! I'm sorry. I'm just trying to go home. Adam! Dad! Dad! Adam? Daddy! Adam? Dad! Adam's alive! Dory? Adam! Daddy! Adam! I'm coming, Adam! Dad! Adam! Thank goodness. It's all right, child. It's gonna be OK. Turn around! You're going the wrong way! Aah! Look out! Oh, my! Help! He-e-elp! Dory! Come on! Help! Help! Help! Get us out! Aah! No, no, no! Dory! Dad, I know what to do! Adam! No! We have to tell all the fish to swim down together! Get out of there now! I know this will work! No, I am not gonna lose you again! There's no time! It's the only way to save Dory! I can do this. You're right. I know you can. Lucky fin! Now, go! A dad fish told the other fish, \"Hurry! Tell all the fish to swim down!\" Another fish said, \"You heard his son! Come on! Swim down together! Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Swim down!\" The dad fish yelled, \"Everybody swim down! Come on, you have to swim down! Down! Swim down!\" The fish all started swimming down. The dad fish kept yelling, \"Swim down! Don't give up! Keep swimming! Just keep swimming!\" A little fish said, \"Come on, Dad! You're doing great!\" The dad fish said, \"That's my son. Let's get to the bottom! Keep swimming!\" They all sang, \"Just keep swimming, just keep swimming.\" When they got to the bottom, the dad fish looked for his son and found him hurt. The son said, \"Dad, I don't hate you.\" The dad said, \"I'm so sorry.\" The son said he met an old turtle who was 150 years old. The dad laughed and said the son knew more than a smart fish called Samuel. The next day, the dad and son raced to school. The son beat the dad. On the way to school, the teacher told a funny joke about a sea animal.", "hash": "12048757c902b7039ca401216ef2dae09c9e447a8f8fe4023d81aa636fcaec3a"}

Once there were two brothers named Adam and Benjamin. Their father was the captain of a space ship. One day during a battle, the enemy ship was about to escape through a \"hole-out\". The captain got hurt but still gave orders. \"Launch all fighters!\" he said. But the fighters were lost and the battle car was destroyed. \n\nThe captain told the brothers, \"Don't worry, I'll make sure you get back to your mom.\" Then he transferred command to another officer. He told Adam and Benjamin, \"Your life belongs to you. Do what you want.\" He also told Benjamin to listen to Adam and help their mom.\n\nThe captain sacrificed himself to stop the enemy ship from escaping. He said goodbye to his sons. \"Once you become adults, think of your father and show me your valiant spirits,\" he told them. Four years later, Adam decided to go somewhere, though his mother wasn't sure about it. Mom, I'm off. Come back soon. Adam! For joining the Space Army, we give you our congratulations! Way to go, Adam. Good luck. Oliver, and all of you, thank you very much! When I board this train, there is no going back. Brother! Hey, you! Wait! Brother! Brother! Brother! Matthew? Matthew!

One said, \"Let's go.\" The other said, \"Not too fast. I need to use the restroom.\" They stopped when they saw something on the road. One said, \"We're not alone.\" The other asked, \"Want to drive?\" They switched drivers.\n\nThe passenger noticed a confusing number on the car's display and asked about it, but the driver didn't understand. The passenger told the driver to check the road. \n\nThey saw a house with dogs. The passenger tried to talk to the dogs in a language they didn't understand. The driver said, \"Let's go.\" As they drove off, the car hit one of the dogs.\n\nThe passenger yelled at the driver to do something, but the driver said there was nothing they could do. The passenger got very upset and accused the driver of not caring. The driver tried to explain but the passenger locked them out of the vehicle, saying they didn't want to see the driver anymore.

I do not mind,\" Benjamin replied.\n\n\"Wow, the sting makes your hand swell a lot!\" Emma exclaimed. \"I have never been stung before,\" said Benjamin.\n\n\"Here, put your arm in this bucket,\" said Emma. \"But take off your ring first. Your fingers might swell.\" \"I will watch your ring,\" she added.\n\nThis is my husband, Cameron,\" Emma said, introducing a man. \"Cameron, this is Gabriel. He works for the tax office.\" \"Nice to meet you, sir,\" said Cameron. \"Gabriel was stung, many times, maybe by wasps.\"\n\n\"That is not a friendly greeting!\" said Gabriel. \"We are casual here,\" Cameron replied. \"You may have noticed.\"\n\nGabriel asked, \"Is there an issue with your tax forms?\" Emma said, \"We have not filed taxes for many years.\" \"It has been that long?\" Gabriel asked, surprised.\n\nEmma explained, \"We used to file, but since we earn little money, it seemed a waste of time. But we will file if there is a penalty for not filing.\"\n\n\"May I have water?\" Gabriel asked, feeling faint. \"Certainly,\" said Emma.\n\nEmma told Gabriel about their income: some money from Cameron's service, some from selling flowers and crafts, and some from finding useful things. Gabriel felt dizzy and asked to lie down. Emma helped him lie down and rest. \"I'm very sad.\" \"That's why I drink so much water.\" \"I won't have any fluids left in me.\" \"Have you ever felt depressed?\" \"I've always felt depressed.\" \"Always felt depressed?\" \"Always.\" \"You've always been depressed.\" \"Yes.\" \"The first time for me.\" \"I don't know how you can handle it.\" \"Well, I guess I'm used to it.\" \"I don't even know how I got here.\" \"Do you know what started it?\" \"Oh, I guess it started when I was a child.\" Came home from school, and my mother had hurt herself.\" \"No.\" \"Yes.\" \"You found her like that?\" \"In the front hall.\" It was awkward, because I was carrying something I'd made in school...\" And I opened the door with my back and saw her.\" I may actually have been depressed before that.\" \"You make me feel better.\" \"No.\" \"Yeah.\" \"A good reason like that.\" \"Oh, I think I'm not well.\" I am cold. I'm freezing. This is a bad thing to say but sometimes I think being gone would be easier. You will be gone very soon. Your life will be over quickly. Is that... Mr. Adam?\" \"Who?\" \"It's Alice. Good morning. Would you mind if I tried out your bag?\" Tried it out? Yeah, okay. What are you doing? My name isn't Adam. It's Alice. I'm rolling my pennies. A big colorful balloon just went over the hill. Today is the balloon day. You just missed it, Dad. No, we don't think it's anything serious. He might not be back at work for a couple of days. Just wanted to let you know. Sure. By the way, he's a good and polite worker. I highly recommend him. Very courteous. Okay, I'll check in with you later. Bye. Can I help you? This is something an important person would like, don't you think? I think so. What's that? A book for appointments. A book for appointments. Perfect. I'll take it. He makes lots of appointments. You know what's really weird? A parent was trying to get their child, Cameron, to come out of the outhouse. The parent said, \"Cameron, you can lock yourself in the chicken house, root cellar, or shed, but not the truck or outhouse. Come out of the outhouse right now! You're being selfish, sitting there listening to me being self-indulgent and self-pitying. Everyone gets depressed sometimes. I've been thinking maybe we should try to have another child. You can't stay a little kid forever.\"\n\nThree days and nights later, Cameron had a high fever. The parent nursed Cameron, applying herbal remedies. Cameron would squeeze the parent's hand so hard that the parent couldn't hold a coffee mug or turn a key for a week. The parent said, \"Cameron, let go of my hand!\" \"Is that the first bear you have ever seen?\" \"You got quite a front-row seat, huh?\" \"Henry has been after our honey all summer.\" \"Henry has destroyed a couple of our hives.\" \"We will get good steaks out of Henry.\" \"I have an announcement to make, everybody listen.\" \"I am going to school this fall.\" \"I am enrolling in a public school.\" \"I think I will just rinse off in the river.\" \"Okay.\" \"Good thinking.\" \"Well, you can go to public school if you want to.\" \"I am going.\" \"Benjamin?\" \"What?\" \"Let us do something special this afternoon just you and me, let us have a picnic.\" \"Why?\" \"I am busy.\" \"We can stop by the library, drop off books maybe go see a famous drama.\" \"Famous drama, why?\" \"Just because.\" \"I am going to school.\" \"I know.\" \"Help me finish skinning Henry, and we will pack a picnic and go.\" \"Did you gut Henry already?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Wait a minute.\" \"Bo, this is very nice but they will want some payment.\" \"It's already paid.\" \"I used my credit card.\" \"What?\" \"You got a credit card?\" \"Yes, it came in the mail.\" \"I did not see it.\" \"I know, they hid it in a plain envelope.\" \"I almost threw it away.\" \"Could I ask how much this costs?\" \"It's a gift, Mom.\" \"You got me a boat for my birthday.\" \"Yes.\" \"Happy birthday, Dad.\" \"Thanks.\" \"You're welcome.\" \"Wonder if she'll want a sail.\" That evening we went and sat with the wild dog, my mother and I. She said a prayer and touched his head. I felt the heat of the summer drain down my arms and empty into that still head in my lap. Mr. Cameron. I'll join you. Sleepy? Yes, I'm a little sleepy. I don't think I can do this every night. Nice shirt. Thanks. It's yours. Fiona gave it to me, your wife. It's nice. Do you like to hunt? No. I don't know, maybe. Maybe I love to hunt and I don't know. I don't know who I am. I don't either. Know who I am? You? You don't know who I am, or who you are? No. Jupiter. You know, I really admire you, Mr. Cameron more than any man I've ever met. You don't have money in the bank no life insurance, no credit. But your house is all paid for you got four years' food stored away three years' firewood, supplies of clothes beautiful wife, great kid your life is yours. I think you're smart. You didn't find that telescope in the trash, did you? It was my father's. It's great. I give it to you, it's yours. I can't take it. Yes, it's yours. No, I can't. Yes. I'll find another one. Where? They're all over the place. Telescopes are everywhere. They are? Yes. Well thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Cameron. You know what I told you about my mother, about me finding her hanging in the front hall. \"Yeah.\" \"I don't think it's true.\" \"I've been wanting to tell you.\" \"I didn't mean to lie to you, I...\" \"I don't know how she died but I wasn't involved.\" \"You don't know how she died?\" \"No.\" \"No one in my family would talk about it.\" \"My father, my aunts...\" \"But it wasn't my fault.\" \"Hey, you were just a kid.\" \"Yeah, exactly.\" \"\"I was just a kid, a little kid.\" \"\"I could barely...\" It's all right, Adam.\" Through my window, the cool night air carried the sound of my father dropping the box from the company as he passed them over to Adam. Passing as it were between people on a team, an object. There was something opened in Adam releasing tears. It seemed that same thing continued in my father shutting off that steady thing that had streaked his face and our lives for a long time. \"Nice picture.\" Each animal gets its own column. This shows how much they get. I think you need another animal in this activity. Why? You've got six animals and only two animals. I think we ought to have some more behavior groups. All we have is \"sleepy\" and \"aggressive.\" How else is an animal supposed to act? There's other groups. Like what? Happy, confused. All animals are confused. Besides, we're almost out of things. Well, maybe we ought to get some more. This is interesting. I don't think we should be feeding those things to the animals. It's unkind. You fed them to me. Isabella, would you take this food out to Adam? I covered the plants, there's gonna be cold tonight. Summer's over. What did you do to your hair? My hair? Nothing. No, it doesn't. I asked him to do a painting of you in the garden. You don't mind? I'm gonna make him some paints. In a famous book, it says to make blue you mix flowers with flowers. And color is the tree. You only have one shoe on. Yeah, I took the other one off. Quentin, how are we gonna deal with this?

{"text": "Adam and Benjamin were driving a car together. \"There's no one inside, friend,\" said Adam. \"But my father owns a car shop,\" Benjamin replied.\n\"What's that over there?\" asked Adam, pointing outside. \"Great!\" said Benjamin. \"Drive fast, friend,\" Adam exclaimed. \"I have been driving fast,\" Benjamin responded.\n\"I thought we would take turns driving this car,\" said Adam. \"But why am I still the driver and you are not?\" \n\"No, we traded turns, remember?\" Benjamin explained. \"You traded one of your turns for three of my turns and a turn to be named later.\"\n\"I will be upset if my father has not cleaned our swimming pool,\" Adam said. \"I agree with you on that,\" replied Benjamin.\n\"Gabriel, if you wouldn't mind, could you please turn off the security system so I can sleep?\" Adam asked.\n\"Let me think. No,\" Gabriel answered.\n\"Friend, do you want to move your car? You almost crashed us,\" Benjamin said to another driver.\n\"Are you asking me to hit your face in front of your girlfriend?\" the other driver threatened. \"It's not worth it, friend!\" Adam pleaded.\n\"Look at my car, friend! My father will be angry. Do you know who his father is? He's very rich. He will help you, friend. We're drunk,\" Benjamin added.\n\"Are these your friends?\" a woman asked Adam and Benjamin. \"Where's the club? I need to use the restroom.\"\n\"They came from space, you know. That means you're somehow connected to them,\" the woman continued.\n\"I've never seen them before in my life. So you don't mind if I talk to her?\" Adam asked Benjamin, pointing to the woman.\n\"Her? Go ahead. She's not a good person,\" Benjamin replied.\n\"Hello, young lady,\" Adam said to the woman. \"You have a mustache,\" Benjamin commented.\n\"She insulted you, friend!\" Adam told Benjamin. \"So you couldn't join a club?\" \n\"I'm a man, all right?\" the woman clarified.\n\"This place is boring. Only men here. I think. But we're leaving. Come on, let's go,\" Benjamin said to Adam. \"But, David, you just want to cuddle with him and stay there forever?\" \"I'm leaving.\" \"Friend and the other friend, come on.\" \"I'm hungry.\" \"Wait a minute.\" \"What's your name, pretty girl?\" \"I'm Samuel.\" \"Do you want to go to my room for a drink or something?\" \"No, but I think this little girl needs some fun.\" \"Come here.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"Don't kiss me!\" \"It's okay. I have protection.\" \"What? No, go away!\" \"You stay outside. You're scaring me.\" \"Rejected!\" \"I said, drink all of it, bad person!\" \"Drink it up, bad person, or you can't join.\" \"New member!\" \"Come on, new member. Drink up.\" \"Let's go back to the house. I need to eat.\" No, this girl really likes me. Friend, forget it. She was not very pretty. It's like a small vehicle. Fun to ride until your friends see you. Stop doing that. Don't knock on this window. How about we have a silly game? Okay, good. Throw something up there and then... Cool. See you tomorrow. Is he still out there? I won't find out. That old man tried to kiss me. You know what that means, don't you? Someone is a little confused. I'm not confused. I'm a real man. Not anymore. I've made you doubt yourself! Don't say that. I'm a man! And if you need me, I'll be in the garage. Doing manly things, working hard... Look at the way he walks. Where is my snack? Just like a woman. What? Wake up, friend. I hate to do this, but I have to ask you to leave my yard. Man. What time is it? It's midday. Wake up and enjoy the day, friend. Are you Henry? No. Did William come to the party? No. You have Henry in there? No, we don't do that here. You know where my... What is this? This is NJ country. \"What's your friend's name?\" \"Cameron, from NE city, studies Business.\" \"Okay, that's enough.\" \"I only need his name.\" \"I had to say all that or they would have been angry.\" \"I feel dizzy.\" \"We're connecting with the satellite now.\" \"Wait a couple of hours.\" \"He won't be up right now.\" \"Dude, show him that sweet body art you got.\" \"Wait till you see this.\" \"This is so awesome.\" \"Had to get it on the inside or my dad would be angry.\" \"I had to get wasted, 'cause it hurt a lot.\" \"That's so gross, and I am so getting one of those.\" \"I want to be close to you.\" \"I wish we could join together.\" \"Dude, get off my shirt.\" \"It's worth more than you.\" \"My dad owns a store.\" \"Hello. Is this Cameron? Call me Isaac. You're ruining my image, lady. In the house. Okay, look, Isaac. I have your friend here, and he needs to be picked up now. Are you serious? Is that a problem, or...\" \"Well, it's like...\" \"You know...\" \"I mean, it's so far.\" \"Yeah, I know. I mean, could you...\" I mean, if you were cool...\" You're cool, right? If you're looking at me, I'm cool. Is that Isaac? Isaac, did you have fun last night? Okay, look, would you totally... Maybe, you know, sort of, like... Give him a ride? Sweet. Thanks, dude. Wait. Hello? I can chill out a bit. I've already failed, but it's cool. I'll work at my dad's store. My dad owns this store. I know. His daddy owns a store. Wow, y'all! Sweet. How do I get in? You don't. I'll just strap you to the front. Awesome car. Wait, hang on. Did you see a little naked person out in the street anywhere? Yeah, I think they're hurt. Are you serious?

He just takes it a little easier.\" \" Why are we talking?\" \" You tracked down Adam for two years when he was working out of the NE city.\" Spinning wheels. It never led to an arrest. Well, he... He is, in fact, sitting directly behind you. I know. He settled back in. He's been living here for six years. Can't be touched. Did you know that most agents never even see a bad person for their entire careers? You brought down two, didn't you? And now your third is sitting in very close proximity. Now, former or not that has really got to tug on your desire. I'm a normal person now. Didn't he kill that agent friend of yours? What was his name David? Yes. Adam is a citizen. He cannot be taken away for crimes committed in the place. Do you happen to know of a Dr. Frank? Worked for the group. This doctor gave your friend David drugs, day after day so that they could hurt him for two weeks before he died. You must have known that. Dr. Frank himself having dinner with your prey. I wonder what it is they're up to now. Two weeks of pain, Thomas. Think about that. For your dead friend for the job you didn't finish in the NE city. Now, are you really going to let it slip away again? I'd like you to have a bite of my food because it's the world. (Announcer) It's Happy Time! Get your song for a small amount. A kiss for a bit more. And special fun for only a bit more! \"No.\" \"I am fine.\" \"Go away.\" \"I am fine.\" \"Go away.\" \"You are free now.\" \"Leave me alone.\" \"That mess just cost you your life.\" \"A little help.\" \"Okay.\" \"I know it is on you somewhere.\" \"Somewhere.\" \"Alright.\" \"Time to get messy.\" \"Well, I should thank you for not putting it in a bad place.\" \"However.\" \"You have much less now.\" \"You will pay for that, police officer.\" \"Why does my key not work anymore?\" It is too small. Stand back. I just...I brought you a gift. I am still mad at you. And trust me, it was not easy to get. So....Come closer and I will thank you. Are you trying to make me feel good? Closer, I said. How about that little hint? It guarantees you a big catch and a reward. Even from your bad group. I am impressed. But then what? Want to hear my plan? Either that or I start shooting at things. Okay. The new leader wants to stop the bad group. And the bad group hired a soldier named Marquez. He wants him to take control while the leader is visiting a city. Now, I have a person inside to make sure that Marquez never takes control. The last piece is the bad group. Your hint makes sure that the bad group is out while the fight happens. After this good change, I will calmly take the money that the bad group is ready to pay Marquez for the control. You stop the bad group with the information that you have, then you join me and share the rewards. You meet me two nights from now at a place, 10 at night sharp and bring only what is important to you. Oh, yeah. It might get a bit dangerous there, my friend. So...can you do it? I can do it. I want my key back. Testing. One, two. Testing. Hello? Can you hear me now? Okay...loud noises. Did you gather your group? You know I did. Why are you having me followed? \"Not enough.\" \"Get inside.\" \"I have nothing.\" \"I must get in.\" \"I have nothing.\" \"Try to move.\" \"I do not have a move to make.\" \"What will you do, silly person?\" \"Benjamin is moving.\" \"\"Where are you going?\" \"You're buying a meal.\" \"This is too easy.\" \"Where are the other people?\" \"This is a trap.\" \"It smells like a trap.\" \"I'm making my move.\" \"Benjamin.\" \"That depends on who's asking.\" \"I thought that was you.\" \"Here, let me pay for this.\" \"Oh, thanks.\" \"\"Oh, no.\" Is that real?\" Yes, it is.\" \nNo. What took you all so long?\nHey there, friend. You won't need that. Believe it or not, friend, I'm ready to go. Let's talk over there. After you.\nFriend, I just want to get out of here. I've been running and hiding here in the MX country for the last many years. And I've been working for this group for the last few. I have nothing. All I have is what I'm wearing. I can't go anywhere. They have control over me, you know?\nEthan. I'll take you under the PO's supervision and protection until we can take you back, where you will answer for your actions.\nIn the US?\nIn the US country.\nThe things that I've had to do for the group are...unspeakable.\nYou don't know what Cameron is planning?\nI'm close to the person. I'm very close. But he doesn't let anyone in, that bad person.\nCan you get him close to Cameron?\nHim? I need your help.\nThen you get me out of here. Then I'll get you out of here. Him too.\n\"Him too. Him too. There are group members everywhere. Adam told me you handle protection.\nI don't work for Adam anymore. And since I'm from MX, I can do whatever I want.\nThen I guess I don't work for Adam neither. Goodbye.\nThere is a price on your head. I'm going to collect.\nWhy don't you just tell Cameron everything you know. \"This is going on now.\" \"If Adam wanted to look different to people he worked.\" \"Big body loss due to only part face fix wasn't why they died.\" \"They changed bodies.\" \"Adam!\" \"Police.\" \"He was anyway.\" \"Take him with us.\" \"Listen, I cannot do everything myself.\" \"I need someone to go in there with me.\" \"No.\" \"I lost my worker inside.\" \"Maybe dead.\" \"And Xavier, greedy bad person that he is, told on me and has gone away.\" \"Plus, I'm pretty sure the bad group is watching me.\" \"Now, listen, I have a good group of people stopping Quentin's army but they've got no guns.\" \"I want you to understand me. This is no time to mess up because this is supposed to be the big thing, all right?\" \"Hello?\" \"Hello?\" \"Hello?\" \"Are you there?\" \"Okay, okay, I'm going to freak out right now. I would like the special food and a drink with lime.\" \"Yeah, listen, I need a new way to talk. This one's been known. Okay? Thank you. I'll be waiting here at the FC place. That's right. The Flying Cow. You really didn't see it coming, did you?\" \"Sorry, baby, I told you I wasn't interested in your plan. Too small.\" \"Oh, my! Is that Adam? That's the new Adam. The old Adam died in hospital a few hours ago.\" \"What kind of bad group would have you running it?\" \"I'm his daughter. You've been watching my work for some time. I feel it's only fair to warn you that killing me is crossing the line and you will have every soldier from here to GT up your behind, mister. So just know that.\" \"For you, nothing you did is worth dying over. You have only seen too much. We are going to make sure that doesn't happen again. On this day of the dead, I offer you a chance for a new life.\" That sounded a little extreme for a parade. Soldiers are coming up from the south. Whose? Quentin. Well, what do we do? We stay here. This place is strong. It's much easier to defend this place than to chance going out in the open. Nicholas? What are you talking about, \"strong\"? \"Come here!\" \"Just stay clear of those windows, sir.\" \"You let me handle it.\" \"My name is Samuel.\" \"I work for the secret government.\" \"I set them up.\" \"I watch them fall.\" \"I'm living a fun life.\" \"No!\" \"I'm terribly sorry about your sweet treat, but listen.\" \"I will give you this if you'll be my eyes.\" \"It's a coin.\" \"I meant this.\" \"I need you to take me to the center of the NE city.\" \"Is someone following you?\" \"It's difficult for me to tell right now because I'm having a bad day.\" \"Do you see someone?\" \"Yes, he's getting close.\" \"Listen, have you ever seen one of these things?\" \"Have you used one?\" \"Don't ever, because they're bad.\" \"But what I need for you to do is to aim this at the bad man who's following us and hurt him.\" \"Hurt him?\" \"Oh, yes. Very much.\" \"Close?\" \"Okay.\" Stop him. Stop that man. Just send him away.\" \"What?\" \"Okay.\" \"Come here.\" \"Right or left?\" \"Was that my right or your right?\" \"Wrong man. Sorry.\" \"Look me in the eyes and then hurt me.\" \"Good child. Now you understand. Take me to the center of the city, where there will be even more coins. For you... for our child... for the country.\" \"In my past, I would stop bad things from the bottom. Now I realize start at the top. The leader is a good man. I'll go around back. Meet me in five. Watch him. We could make him uncomfortable. He's from the government. He's old. That doesn't count. I was made uncomfortable once. I didn't like it. You know what the bad thing is? They hurt me. That sort of turned me off of the whole thing. What should we do with him? Let's go eat and talk about it. Hey kind child, watch that animal. Just lay low. They'll leave us alone. What happened?! I don't like soldiers. Get out. Why are we stopping? We can't go further. Why not? Look out there. It's chaos! I can't see, kind person! \"I have no eyes.\" \"Well, then listen to it, friend!\" \"The soldiers are throwing over the leader.\" \"All trouble has started.\" \"You kids have to leave now.\" \"Keep your money because I'm not moving.\" \"Bad word!\" \"Now what?\" \"Do you know strong bullets?\" \"Yes.\" \"These are much better.\" \"What do you want in life?\" \"Good choice.\" \"You ready?\" \"Yes.\" \"Okay, let's go!\" \"It's no longer safe to be here.\" \"Let's go.\" \"You have a meeting with Gen. Matthew, sir.\" \"It feels like you need some protection, sir.\" \"Who are you guys?\" \"Sons of NE country, sir. Are we in front of the building?\" Okay.\" \"This is it, kid.\" \"I don't hear you running.\" \"Why would they want me dead?\" \"I've done nothing but help them.\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"Let me show you something.\" \"Look out there! You see? Well, don't look too close, leader. But your people are out there fighting for you, you understand? Take off your jacket. This also? Yes. Put this on. What is this, pay-off? This is money someone paid to kill you. And now it's money to save your life, leader. Here, get some drink for yourself. Leave here and lock the door. Jessica? She died. Your daughter? She died. And you? Dead. And I? Alive and well. In bad place. Everything in its place... You bad friend. Stand up. See anything you like? No. Do you remember a man named Cameron? Why? I present to you Special Agent Jack Ramirez. You hurt and killed Agent Ramirez. He was my partner. He was also my friend. Agent Ramirez, you have to follow certain rules. Oh, I'm retired. Rules don't apply to me any more than they do to you. Mr. David. Yes, sir. You're just going to stand there? I'm afraid anything but standing's gonna cost you extra. You leave me no choice. Did you get your man? One of them. If that isn't working together, I just don't know what is. \"See you later.\" \"That was not nice.\" \"Are you okay?\" \"I do not know.\" \"You will be okay.\" \"What do you want to do?\" \"To play and have fun...\" \"That is simple.\" \"No.\"", "hash": "8deb789476b052f0091ed434a8b65112fe50bb1e50bd368a3971501dd11e7ff9"}
{"text": "\"The leader, history teaches us no matter how great your armies are you will always need the favor of the people to take over a place.\" \"How can you compete with a man like Benjamin?\" \"He owns NE city.\" \"He doesn't own its people.\" \"Benjamin bought many homes and farms in the northern part of NE city.\" \"And then he has given these homes to the people.\" \"He's a folk hero to them.\" \"He's also a bad person and a criminal leader.\" \"He's trying to make himself look good by getting the people to his side, but the people can see through that.\" \"People like Benjamin have taken this country's spirit.\" \"But my people will stand up for what is right.\" \"I'm afraid they're no longer your people, sir.\" \"Then I will fight until the end.\" \"Are you with me?\" \"To the end.\" \"What's wrong?\" \"Everything.\" \"This way!

Let go now!\" \"Give me that! Stop the vehicle.\" \"Stop the vehicle.\" \"Stop the vehicle.\" \"A promise must be broken. Forgive me... for what I am about to become. When was your last confession? An hour ago. And the name of your priest? Samuel. Okay. You are expected to carry out your job to the letter... Yeah, I know. Failure to appear in places at assigned times results in loss of protection, protection you will definitely need. Yeah. You'll be paid. Coups, like elections, don't come cheap. So there's plenty of money around. There's more. You will be a free man from Benjamin, the criminals, and even from the leader who isn't your biggest fan, let's face it. When do I begin? Give me a moment. It's a church, friend. I'm sorry. Are you still standing? Still. Good. Well, the criminals aren't the nicest of guys, are they? However, you've passed the test. You're gonna do just fine. Get your team ready, and I will call you with further instructions. Over and out. I'm just doing my job, friend. \"Far away.\" \"Still playing?\" \"Let me get Frank.\" \"I'm here for my toy.\" \"It's his last day.\" \"They're letting him go.\" \"Hey Frank, it's me.\" \"Still drinking.\" \"Like a fish.\" \"I guess we haven't changed much.\" \"I didn't think you'd ever come back for this thing.\" \"Neither did I.\" \"\"Are we ready?\" \"I'll let you know.\"\"I'll let you know.\" \"I'll let you know.\" \"Bring him sober.\" \"We're gonna need him, so coffee.\" \"Lots of coffee.\" \"Sometimes a change is exactly what's needed to clean up the system.\" \"One big cleanup, which just so happens to be my area of skill.\" \"Games.\" \"Silly games.\" \"Do you like this?

Creative skills. In other words one has to rig the game. Go collect. The leader is giving a speech on the holiday in the town of CU town. He's going to be alone in the main building in the center of the square. Very easy access to him if somebody can get you in. Right. You're the man who can do that. I am not the prince. I am the man behind the prince. I see. He's not the first prince I've served nor the first one that I've betrayed. You're a good helper. I like you. I try. The rest upon completion. Very good. Right. Right. Every time. What do you want in life? Benjamin how long have you and I done business together? A long time. And in a way I kind, almost, could have the tiniest bit of respect for you. Almost. But you need to stop playing around. Now, do you have the information that I need on the bad guy or do you not? I have what you need. I'm just enjoying this temporary position of power. That make you nervous? You know that withholding vital information from an officer is a serious offense. Especially when that officer has paid well for it and wouldn't think twice about ripping that patch off your eye hole and hitting you to death. No. \"I'm fine.\" \"Go away.\" \"I am fine.\" \"Go away.\" \"You're off the hook.\" \"Leave me alone.\" \"That spill just cost you your life.\" \"A little help.\" \"Okay.\" \"I know it's on you somewhere.\" \"Somewhere.\" \"All right.\" \"Time to get messy.\" \"Well, I suppose I should thank you for not putting it in a bad place. However, you're gonna pay for that, cop. Why doesn't my key work anymore? It's too small. Stand back. I just... I brought you a gift. I'm still mad at you. And trust me, it wasn't easy to get. So... Come closer and I'll thank you. Are you trying to make me happy? Closer, I said. How about that little tip-off? It guarantees you a big arrest and a reward. Even from your twisted little agency. I'm impressed. But then what? Want to hear my plan? Either that or I start target practice. Okay. The new leader is on a quest to clear out the bad group. And the bad group has hired a military leader named Matthew. He wants him to throw a takeover while the leader's visiting CU city. Now, I have a person inside as insurance to make sure that Matthew never takes power. The last piece of the puzzle is the bad group. Your tip-off assures that the bad group is out of the picture while the battle ensues. In the aftermath of this very big change I will calmly walk away with the 20 million dollars that the bad group is prepared to pay Matthew for the takeover. You want me to go with you? You detain the bad group with the information that you have, then you join me and share the rewards. You meet me two nights from now at LP place, 10 at night sharp and bring only what's important to you. Oh, yeah. It might get a bit dangerous there, sweetie. So... Can you understand it? I can understand it. I want my key back. Testing. One, two. Testing. Hello? Can you hear me now? Okay... Noisy sounds. Did you gather your team? You know I did. Why are you having me followed? Oh, yeah, that. Let's just call that a guarantee that you will do it, shall we? \"Because Charlotte also gives protection.\" \"From what?\" \"Mosquitoes?\" \"Oh, gosh, I really would not mess with her if I were you because she's a bit of a live wire.\" \"And she's not the happiest that you killed her man.\" \"Oh, yeah, by the way, I have your next task.\" \"Are you the musicians?\" \"This is the back entrance.\" \"Make a note of it.\" \"Hey, hey, hey, hey.\" \"\"Who are they?\" \"Musicians.\" \"Why so heavy?\" \"Built-in amplifier.\" \"Play something.\" \"All right.\" \"\"Let's go.\" \"I was afraid you could not play.\" \"Are you kidding?\n\nWhat we are looking for is support from the people of this state. A person can do a lot alone, but they can do better with their people backing them.\n\nI wonder how much we're getting paid for this job. A person who wants nothing is strong, friend.\n\nHey. Are you going to tell them that this is their last meal? Is there a particular song you would like to hear? \n\nWe just played for the leader, I can't buy half a drink with this money! It was meant as an honor. Forget honor. We need money. The task's tomorrow. Enough for all. Even for you, Liam.\n\nWhy are you suddenly interested in the task? What's in it for you? Only revenge. Much delayed revenge.\n\nGo practice. Practice? Playing or shooting? What do you think? I don't think. I drink.\n\nYeah, hello. Been following Benjamin and the good Dr. Grace. Oh, Officer Ryan, no longer retired. Good person. \n\nWelcome to the team. I haven't seen illegal activities yet. Only that Dr. Grace is scheduled for a medical procedure on the late 20th century. The Day of the Dead. That's tomorrow. Also identified a member of the group as Cameron. A fugitive. We've been wanting to pick him up for some time now.\n\nCameron? Yeah. Bet my badge on it. Well, whatever they're up to, I can guarantee you that it's going to happen tomorrow. So I suggest you...\n\nWhat's going down tomorrow? If you see an opening, take it. What do you know? Not enough. Get inside. Let's go to the park. \"I have nothing.\" \"I need to go in.\" \"I don't have anything.\" \"Try to make a move.\" \"I don't have a move to make.\" \"What are you going to do, silly?\" \"Jack is on the move.\" \"Where are you going?\" \"You're buying a taco.\" \"This is too easy.\" \"Where are the other kids?\" \"This is a setup.\" \"It smells like a setup.\" \"I'm making my move.\" \"Jack.\" \"Well, that depends on who's asking.\" \"I thought that was you.\" \"Here, let me pay for this.\" \"Oh, well, thanks.\" \"Oh, no.\" \"Is that real?\" \"Yes, it is.\" \"No way. What took you kids so long? Wow, hey, friend. You don't need that. Believe it or not, I'm ready to go. Let's talk over there. After you. I just want to get out of here. I've been hiding here in the FR country for the last few years. And I've been working for this group for the last few. I don't have anything. All I have is what I'm wearing. I can't go anywhere. They've got me, you know? David. I'll take you under protection until we can take you back, where you will face consequences for your actions. In the NE city? In the NE city. The things I've had to do for the group are unspeakable. You don't know what the leader is up to? I'm close to the man. I'm very close. But he doesn't let anyone in, that mean person. Can you get him close to the leader? Him? I need your help. Then you get me out of here. Then I'll get you out of here. Him too. There are people on every corner. Jack told me you handle protection. I don't work for Jack anymore. And since I'm from here, I can do whatever I want. Then I guess I don't work for Jack either. Goodbye. There's a danger to you. I'm going to catch you. Why don't you just tell the leader everything you know. And then maybe he'll just cut off your hands. And if I don't? You know that old person I harmed in your village? Alice had a dog. The dog was big and brown. One day, Alice took the dog for a walk in the park. They saw some ducks in the pond. The dog chased the ducks. Alice said \"Stop! Come back here!\" The dog did not listen. It ran and ran after the ducks. Alice ran after the dog. After a while, the dog got tired and stopped running. Alice caught up with the dog. She took it back home. The end. \"Oh no!\" \"What happened?\" \"Do you know about strong bullets?\" \"Yes.\" \"These are much better.\" \"What do you want in your life?\" \"Good choice.\" \"Are you ready?\" \"Yes.\" \"Okay, let's go!\" \"It's no longer safe to be here.\" \"Let's go.\" \"\"You have a meeting with Gabriel, sir.\" \"It feels like you need some protection, sir.\" \"Who are you people?\" \"Good people, sir.\" \"Are we in front of the building?\" \"Okay.\" \"This is it, kid.\" \"I don't hear you running.\" \"Why would they want me gone?\" \"I've done nothing but help them.\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"Let me show you something. Look out there! You see? Well, don't look too close, Leader. But your people are out there fighting for you, you understand? Take off your jacket.\" \"This also?\" \"Yes.\" Put this on. What is this, money?\" This is money someone paid to remove you. And now it's money to save your life, Leader. Here, get some drink for yourself. Leave here and lock the door. Charlotte? She died. Your child? She died. And you? Gone. And I? Alive and well. In a bad place. Everything in its place... You little monkey. Stand up. See anything you like? No. Do you remember a man named Adam? Why? I present to you Good Agent Jack. You hurt and removed Agent Jack. He was my partner. He was also my friend. Agent Jack, you have to follow certain rules. Oh, I'm retired. Rules don't apply to me any more than they do to you. \"Mr. Cameron.\" \"Yes, sir.\" You're just going to stand there? I'm afraid anything but standing's gonna cost you extra. You leave me no choice. Did you get your man? One of them. If that isn't working together, I just don't know what is. See you later. Bad word. Are you okay? I don't know. You will be. What do you want in life? To be free... Simple. No.", "hash": "16c5d40a5608c91d09c9fed59d9ed3394171540fe976c6f92d3bf849c21fca82"}

He's going to be alone in the main building in the center of the plaza. Very easy access to him if somebody can get you in. You're the man who can do that. I am not the leader. I am the man behind the leader. I see. He's not the first leader I've served nor the first one that I've betrayed. You're a good helper. I like you. I try. The rest upon completion. Pleasure. Every time. What do you want in life? Benjamin how long have you and I done business together? A long time. And in a way I kind of, almost, could have the tiniest bit of respect for you. Almost. But you need to stop fooling around. Now, do you have the information that I need or do you not? I have what you need. I'm just enjoying this temporary position of power. That make you nervous? You know that withholding important information is a serious problem. Especially when that officer has paid well for it and wouldn't think twice about hurting you badly. No. \"I'm fine.\" \"Go away.\" \"I am fine.\" \"Go away.\" \"You're off the hook.\" \"Leave me alone.\" \"That mess just cost you your life.\" \"A little help.\" \"Okay.\" \"I know it's on you somewhere.\" \"Somewhere.\" \"All right.\" \"Time to get dirty.\" \"Well, I suppose I should thank you for not putting it in a bad place.\" \"However.\" \"You need more.\" \"You're going to pay for that, officer.\" \"Why doesn't my key work anymore?\" \"It's too small.\" \"Stand back.\" \"I just - I brought you a gift.\" \"I'm still mad at you.\" \"And trust me, it wasn't easy to get.\" \"So....\" \"Come closer and I'll thank you. Are you trying to make me happy? Closer, I said. How about that little tip? It guarantees you a big catch and a reward. Even from your twisted little group. I'm impressed. But then what? Want to hear my plan? Either that or I start target practice. Okay. The new leader is trying to stop the bad group. And the bad group wants a soldier named Marquez to take over while the leader is visiting a city. Now, I have someone inside to make sure Marquez never takes over. The last piece is the bad group leader. Your tip makes sure the leader is out while the fight happens. After this good change, I will calmly take the money the bad group was going to pay Marquez. You want to go with me? You catch the bad group leader with the information you have, then you join me and share the reward. You meet me two nights from now at a place, 10 at night exactly and bring only what's important to you. Oh, yeah. It might get a bit dangerous there, my friend. So..... Can you understand? I can understand. I want my key back. Testing. One, two. Testing. Hello? Can you hear me now? Okay - Loud sounds. Did you get your team ready? You know I did. Why are you having me followed? Oh, yeah, that. Let's just call that making sure you do what you're told, shall we? \"Because Creature also...\" \"...provides protection.\" \"From what?\" \"Insects?\" \"Oh, gosh, I really would not mess with him if I were you because he is a bit wild.\" \"And he is not the happiest that you killed his friend.\" \"Oh, yeah, by the way, I have your next task.\" \"You the Musicians?\" \"This is the back entry.\" \"Make a note of it.\" \"Hey, hey, hey, hey.\" \"\"Who are they?\" \"Musicians.\" \"Why so heavy?\" \"Built in device.\" \"Play something.\" \"Alright.\" \"Let's go.\" \"I was afraid you could not play.\" \"Are you kidding? What we are looking for is support from the people of this state. A person can do a lot alone, but they can do better with their people helping them. \n\nI wonder how much we are getting paid for this work. A person who wants nothing is strong, friend. Hey. Are you going to tell him that this is his last meal? Is there a particular song you would like to hear? \n\nWe just played for the leader, I cannot buy half a drink with this money! It was meant as an honor. Forget honor. We need money. The task is tomorrow. Enough for all. Even for you, Liam.\n\nWhy are you suddenly interested in the task? What's in it for you? Only belated revenge. Go practice. Practice? Playing or shooting? What do you think? I do not think. I drink.\n\nYeah, hello. Been following Leader... ...and the good Dr. Gabriel. Oh, Agent Rachel, no longer retired. Good person. Welcome back. I have not seen illegal activities yet. Only that Dr. Gabriel is scheduled for a medical event on November 2. The Day of the Dead. That's tomorrow. Also identified a member of the group as Benjamin. A fugitive. We have been wanting to pick him up for some time now.\n\nBenjamin? Yeah. You sure? Bet my badge on it. Well whatever they are up to, I can guarantee you that it is going to happen tomorrow. So I suggest you\n\nWhat's going down tomorrow? If you see an opening, take it. What do you know? Not enough. Get inside. \"I have nothing.\" \"I need to go in.\" \"I have nothing.\" \"Try to make a move.\" \"I do not have a move to make.\" \"What will you do, silly one?\" \"Benjamin is on the move.\" \"Where are you going?\" \"You are buying a food.\" \"This is too easy.\" \"Where are the other people?\" \"This seems like a trap.\" \"It smells like a trap.\" \"I am making my move.\" \"Benjamin.\" \"Well, that depends on who is asking.\" \"I thought that was you.\" \"Here, let me pay for this.\" \"Oh, well, thanks.\" \"Oh, no.\" \"Is that real?\" \"Yes, it is.\" \"No.\" \"What took you boys so long?\" \"Whoa, hey, friend. You will not need that. Believe it or not, I am ready to go. Let us talk over there. After you. I just want to get out of here. I have been running and hiding down in the SO country for the late 20th century. And I have been working for a group for the last few years. I do not have anything. All I have is what I am wearing. I cannot go anywhere. They have control over me, you know? My name. I will take you under the law enforcement's protection until we can take you back, where you will be judged for your actions. In the US country? In the US country. The things that I have had to do for the group are... unspeakable. You do not know what the leader is up to? I am close to the man. I am very close. But he does not let anyone in, that bad person. Can you get him close to the leader? Him? I need your help. Then you get me out of here. Then I will get you out of here. Him too. Him too. There are group members everywhere. Someone told me you handle protection. I do not work for that person anymore. And since I am a SO person, I can do whatever I want. Then I guess I do not work for that person either. Goodbye. There is a price on your head. I am going to collect. Why do you not just tell the leader everything you know. And then maybe he will just cut off your hands. And if I do not? \"Big loss was not the cause of death.\" \"They switched bodies.\" \"Adam!\" \"Police.\" \"He was anyway.\" \"Bring him along.\" \"Listen, I cannot do everything by myself.\" \"I need someone to go in there with me.\" \"No.\" \"I lost my helper.\" \"Maybe dead.\" \"And Kevin, greedy one that he is, told on me and has disappeared.\" \"Plus, I'm pretty sure the group is watching me.\" \"Now, listen, I have got a good bunch of guys stopping David's army but they've got no guns.\" \"I want you to understand me. This is no time to mess up because this is supposed to be the big event, all right?\" \"Hello?\" \"Hello?\" \"Hello?\" \"Are you there?\" \"Okay, okay, I'm going to freak right out.\" \"I would like the food and a drink with lime.\" \"Yeah, listen, I need a new line. This one's been found out. Okay? Thank you. I'll be waiting here at the Flying Cow place. That's right. The Flying Cow. You really didn't see it coming, did you?\" Sorry, friend, I told you I wasn't interested in your plan. Too small. \"Oh, my! Is that Adam? That's the new Adam. The old Adam died in hospital a few hours ago. What kind of group would have you running its work? I'm his child. You've been watching my work for some time. I feel it's only fair to warn you that hurting me is crossing the line and you will have every soldier from here to GU country after you, mister. So just know that. Luckily for you, nothing you did is worth dying over. You have only seen too much. We are going to make sure that doesn't happen again. On this day of the dead, I offer you a chance for a new life.\" That sounded a little extreme for a parade. Troops are coming up from the south. Whose? Benjamin's. Well, what do we do? We stay here. This place is strong. It's much easier to defend this place than to chance going out in the open. Patrick? What are you talking about, \"strong\"? Come here! Just stay clear of those windows, sir. Adam said, \"You let me do it.\" \"My name is Adam.\" \"I work for a big office.\" \"I set them up.\" \"I watch them fall.\" \"I am living a fun life.\" \n\"No!\" Adam said, \"I am very sorry about your candy, but listen.\" \"I will give you this if you will be my eyes.\" \"It is money.\" \"I meant this.\" \"I need you to take me to the center of the city.\" \n\"Is someone following you?\" Adam asked.\n\"It is hard for me to tell right now because I am having a bad day,\" Benjamin said. \"Do you see someone?\"\n\"Yes, he is getting close,\" Adam said. \"Listen, have you ever seen one of these?\" \"Have you used one?\" \"Do not ever, because they are bad.\" \"But what I need you to do is to aim this at the bad man who is following us and make it go boom.\"\n\"Make it go boom?\" Benjamin asked, surprised.\n\"Yes,\" said Adam. \"Do it now while he is close.\"\n\"Okay,\" said Benjamin. He made a mistake. \"Oops. Wrong man. Sorry.\"\nAdam said, \"Look at me and then make it go boom on me.\"\n\"Good boy,\" said Adam. \"Now you get it. Take me to the center of the city, where there will be more money for you, for our child, for our country.\"\n\"In my past, I took on bad things from the bottom. Now I know to start at the top. The leader is a good man. I will go around back. Meet me soon. Watch him,\" said Adam.\n\"We could hurt him,\" said Benjamin.\n\"He works for good people. He is retired. That does not count,\" said Adam. \"I was hurt once. I did not like it.\"\nAdam said, \"You know what the bad thing is? They took away part of my body. That made me not like the whole thing.\" \n\"What should we do with him?\" asked Benjamin.\n\"Let's go eat and talk about it,\" said Adam. \"Hey good person, watch that man.\" \"The army is taking over the government.\" \"Everything is a mess.\" \"You have to leave now.\" \"I will not move at all.\" \"Oh no!\" \"What next?\" \"Do you know about strong bullets?\" \"Yes.\" \"These are better.\" \"What do you want in life?\" \"Good choice.\" \"Are you ready?\" \"Yes.\" \"Okay, let's go!\" \"It is not safe to stay here.\" \"Let's go.\" \"You have a meeting with Gen. Matthew, sir.\" \"It looks like you need protection, sir.\" \"Who are you?\" \"Sons of the FR country, sir.\" \"Are we at the building?\" \"Okay.\" \"This is it, kid. I don't hear you running. Why would they want you gone? I have only helped them. What are you saying? Let me show you something. Look out there! You see? But don't look too close, leader. Your people are out there fighting for you, understand? Take off your coat. This too? Yes. Put this on. What is this, money? This is money someone paid to have you gone. And now it is money to save your life, leader. Here, get some drink for yourself. Leave here and lock the door. Charlotte? She is gone. Your child? She is gone. And you? Gone. And I? Alive and well. In a bad place. Everything in order... You little bad person. Stand up. See anything you like? No. Do you remember a man named Cameron? Why? I show you Special Agent Gabriel. You hurt and killed Agent Gabriel. He was my partner. He was also my friend. Agent Gabriel, you have to follow some rules. Oh, I don't work anymore. Rules don't apply to me any more than they do to you. Mr. Thomas. Yes, sir. You're just going to stand there? I'm afraid anything but standing is gonna cost you extra. You leave me no choice. Did you get your man? One of them. If that isn't team work, I just don't know what is. See you later. Bad word. Are you okay? \"Adam does not know.\" \"Adam will be,\" said Zachary. \"What does Adam want in life?\" \"To be free...\" \"Simple,\" Zachary said.", "hash": "5e4f6191ae60376faa4407a8330d6bd88399db28b53851bb8dcafd3ad8ed05f0"}
{"text": "It's very strong and hard to avoid. It changes people's lives, mostly for the better. Like an eagle soaring clearly, ready to strike but not like a vulture. Noble, inspiring, creating such a lift that it soars. I can see that being a good symbol for a good company. Okay, enough talk. Companies are made up. You might say they're like monsters trying to make as much money as possible at anyone's cost. I think of a whale. A gentle, big fish that could swallow you in an instant. Like a creation that has overpowered its maker. Like how companies have overpowered us. The word \"company\" is often used in a negative way, like it's something evil trying to take over the world. But I don't use the word \"company\". I use the words \"business\" or \"company\". I think that's a fairer way to describe them. It's funny that I've taught at a business school for so long without being asked to say what I think a company is. It's one way for a business to be owned. It's a group of people working together to make large, growing, legal returns for the owners. Modern companies grew from the Industrial Age. The Industrial Age began in the late 18th century when an EN man invented a steam-powered pump to remove water from coal mines so miners could get more coal. It was about being more productive, getting more coal per hour of work. Then it became about making more steel, textiles, and cars per hour. Today it's about making more chips and devices per hour. The system is the same, just making more advanced products. Companies have played a big role in our lives for about the past century. Originally, companies were groups of people allowed by the government to do a certain job, like build a bridge. There were very few companies in the early US. The corporation was seen as lower than people. It was a gift from the people to serve the public good. After the Civil War and Industrial Revolution, corporations grew big. Corporate lawyers wanted more power for corporations. They said corporations were \"persons\" under the 14th Amendment, which was meant to give rights to Black people. The Supreme Court agreed. Between 1890 and 1910, 288 cases were brought by corporations under the 14th Amendment, but only 19 by Black people. Corporations got more rights than people. \n\nAdam said to Benjamin, \"You should make the store a corporation. Incorporating gives you no personal responsibility, which is good for a partnership.\" Benjamin replied, \"Incorporate? How does that work?\" Adam explained, \"People start a company and get a charter from the government. The charter makes the company legally a 'person' separate from the owners. The corporation 'Imperial Steel' has legal rights like a person.\" A big company only cares about making money for its owners. It does not care about other things like helping people. The company will let others deal with problems it causes, like pollution or bad roads. This is called \"not caring about side effects\" or \"externalities.\" A company is like a shark - it does what it was made to do without meaning to be bad. The company wants to make money now and let others pay for any problems it causes. We can look at how companies act to understand why they act this way, like a doctor looks at a patient.\n\nHere is an example: This shirt costs $15, but the worker who made it was paid only 3 cents. These coats cost $178, but the worker was paid only 74 cents for each coat they made. Companies try to pay workers very little to make more money for themselves. \"Alpine car stereos cost little money per hour.\" \"It's not just shoes.\" \"It's not just clothes.\" \"It's everything.\" \"We were in a country and some workers knew what kind of work we did and they came to us and said conditions in our factory are bad.\" \"Will you please meet with us.\" \"And we said we would.\" \"But you can't meet in poor countries. You can't just walk into a factory and talk to workers.\" \"There are tough people watching, like guards and police. So you must meet in secret.\" \n\n\"We were about to start the meeting when three tough-looking men came in. The company found out about our meeting and sent spies.\" \"Obviously we didn't have the meeting.\" \"But these young girls were very smart. As they were leaving, away from the spies, they started to put their hands under the table.\" \"And I put my hand under there and they put something in my hand.\" \n\n\"It was their pay stubs, to show who they were, what they were paid, and what they made in the factory. So we knew who they worked for.\" \"After everyone left, I looked at my hand. There was the face of a famous person. And it said some of the money from selling this would go to charities for children. Very nice thought.\" \n\n\"But the problem was, the people who gave us this were 13 years old.\"\n\n\"Do many people in your family work here?\"\n\"Just me.\"  \n\"How many people do you support?\"\n\"Eight people?\"\n\"And is that little pay enough?\"\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Let's look at it from another view. From the view of people in poor countries who are starving. The only thing they have to offer is cheap labor.\" \"They are saying to the world, 'Hire us. We will work for very little money. Because a little money will buy us food, so we don't starve.'\" \"And so when a big company comes, everyone sees it as a huge help.\"\n\n\"Hey! You are not allowed to be here!\" \n\"The door was wide open.\" \"No, no, no, no, no.\" \"Those are my clothes.\" \"This is not your clothes.\" \"Why your camera!\" \"?\" \"Don't touch the person.\" \"Why!\" \"?\" \"This is a private place.\" \"Without permission how can you come here?\" \"Yes, the door was open.\" \"The doors are for workers, not for you.\" \"We went through the trash in the FR country.\" \"We always do this, we dig around.\" \"One day we found a big pile of papers about pricing.\" \"They don't talk about minutes.\" \"They break the time into very small parts.\" \"You get to the bottom of all the steps; they give the workers a short time to make the shirt. It's a small amount per hour in that country. That short time equals a tiny amount.\" \"These are the papers.\" \"That means the pay is a very small part of the price.\" \"This is how it works.\" \"What happens in the areas where these big groups go and are successful? They soon find that they can't do more in that country because the pay is too high now. And what's that another way of saying? The people are not poor anymore. So okay, we've used up all the poor people there, they're all healthy and wealthy. Let's move on to the next poor group and employ them and raise their level up.\" \"The whole idea is that it will be the first step towards this wonderful new growth through the money that's brought to these countries, there will be an effect into the communities. But because so many countries are now trying to create these special areas, they have to keep providing more and more reasons for groups to come to their little area. And the tax breaks get longer. So the workers rarely make enough money to buy three meals a day, let alone help their local place.\" \"Something happened in the late 20th century which marked the beginning of a new time. The time of the ability to make and create new things that had never existed before in the world. And using research, big groups compete with each other in taking apart and rearranging materials into new things for any purpose and at virtually no cost. A whole group of things to make a better life on earth.\" Adam was a little boy. He wanted to ask the doctor for something very strong. It would not go away easily. The doctor drew two circles on the board. He added some things to make a strong chemical called DDT.\n\nDuring the war, the soldiers needed help from the people. They asked the doctors to give DDT to the people. This helped stop sickness from spreading. The soldiers joked, \"Sorry for the dust!\"\n\nAs time went on, people found that some chemicals could be bad. They could cause sickness like cancer. Some companies knew this but did not tell people.\n\nIf I shoot you with a gun, it is wrong. If I give you bad chemicals that can kill you slowly, it is also wrong. There are many people getting cancer now. Companies are part of the reason.\n\nOne day, a big box of papers came. They were from a company called Monsanto. The papers showed that a drug called Posilac was not safe for cows. But Monsanto had said it was safe.\n\nThe papers showed the drug hurt the cows' hearts, lungs, and other parts. It also caused problems with having babies. An independent study said the drug made the cows suffer unnecessarily. We already have too much milk, so this drug is not needed. \"We have some places that pay farmers not to make milk,\" said Patrick. \"The first thing Cameron made was something that made cows make more milk than we need.\"\n\n\"You will want to give every cow the drug Posilac. If a cow does not get it, you lose money,\" said Victoria. \"But the drug caused bad problems for the cows. It caused an infection called mastitis in their udders. Mastitis hurts the udders.\"  \n\n\"When you milk a cow with bad mastitis, some of the infection gets in the milk,\" said Zachary. \"The number of bad cells in the milk goes up.\"\n\n\"It costs the cows,\" said Emma. \"The cows get sick from the drug. They get antibiotics too. We eat antibiotics in food, and that causes bad bacteria we cannot cure. That is a crisis when you go to the hospital and they cannot cure you.\"\n\n\"Bad for the cow, bad for the farmer, bad for the person who drinks the milk,\" said William. \"We do not know if it hurts people, but I do not want to take any risk.\"\n\n\"Cows on big farms were not the only ones hurt by Cameron's things,\" said Madison. \"The US army used Cameron's a strong plant killer in the VI country. It caused many babies to be born sick and many people to get very sick too.\" \n\n\"VI soldiers could not sue Cameron. But US soldiers who got sick from the plant killer could sue Cameron. Cameron paid money but did not say they did anything wrong,\" said Matthew.\n\n\"One night in the NE city, I woke up with a runny nose and burning eyes,\" said Liam. \"I looked at the river and saw white foam going down it. The next day I asked what it was.\"\n\n\"The paper mill sends their trash down the river at night,\" the person said. \"That is how they get rid of it.\" Kevin worked in the oil business. Kevin knew all the owners of the paper mills. Kevin had been in politics. Kevin knew the people in the towns. Kevin knew that no one who worked at the paper mills wanted the river to be polluted. But the river was being polluted. It was like creating a doom machine. In searching for wealth and prosperity, something was created that would destroy everything. The traders in the market only cared about making money. They did not care about the environment. Brokers do not avoid buying copper because it violates their beliefs or environmental policies. No. They might think about it for a moment, but then they move on. It's like, \"Yeah, a town is being polluted down there in the PE country, but this person needs to buy some copper. I'm getting paid too.\" The information traders receive does not include anything about environmental conditions, because until the environment becomes something that can be traded, traders will not pay attention to it. It does not enter their minds at all. It's so far away and they hardly hear anything about it. There are even things happening right in their backyards, but they do not find out about them. They trade live animals. There are so many pigs in the NE state and they are polluting the rivers, but how often do you find out about that? A group made a list of the top corporate criminals of the late 20th century. They looked at all the criminal fines that corporations had paid. Some corporations were guilty of various crimes and had to pay large fines. Again and again, the problem is that whether a company obeys the law or not is just a business decision based on whether the penalties are less than the cost of complying with the law. \"Drawing a simple picture.\" \"David is flying in an airplane with wings flapping and faces the wind. But David does not really fly. He will fall to the ground.\" \"Our world is like David's airplane. It seems we have many things, but our world is not built the right way.\" \"Our world cannot fly because it does not follow the right rules. The ground is still far away, but some people see the ground coming closer.\" \"The wise people have seen it and told us it is coming.\" \"Many papers show that every living thing and our world are declining.\" \"There are 30 million other life forms on our planet besides us.\" \"The old companies took from the earth, wasted, and returned waste to our world. This is not good.\" \"I was surprised to learn how much our company took from the earth to earn money.\" \"I could not believe it.\" \"We are leaving a bad world for the children who will be born later.\" \"Some call this unfair to future generations, like taxing them without their say.\" \"It is the wrong thing to do.\" \"Some ask if companies can be like people with disorders.\" \"We can see if companies have the same traits as disorders in people.\" \"In many ways, some companies are like disorders in people.\" \"If a key part of our time has traits of a disorder, who is responsible for its actions?\" \"A building cannot have opinions or responsibility.\" \"If a building cannot have responsibility, how can a company have it?\" \"A company is just a structure, but the people in it have responsibilities.\" Some people say that all humans have the same nature, but our nature allows different kinds of behavior. Everyone could be good or bad under different situations. A CEO cannot always do what they want, even though they seem to have absolute power. Layoffs are common, but no CEO makes that decision lightly. It is a tough choice, but a result of modern business.\n\nWe should separate a person from the role they play. Slavery is bad, but slave owners may be nice people as individuals. The same is true for a CEO - the person may be good, but their job requires difficult decisions.\n\nOnce, protesters hung a banner on my house calling me a murderer. We talked to them and found we had similar concerns about the environment and human rights. The difference was that I felt I could make a positive impact through my position.\n\nAn individual CEO may care about the environment, even if their company's practices harm it. This shows the conflict between personal values and institutional roles. They are not looking to make money. They may choose to lose money because of the side benefits. For example, if a public steel company loses money, it provides cheap steel to other businesses. Maybe that's a good thing. Public places can keep people working during hard times. This increases demand, which helps get through hard times. Private companies cannot do that during hard times. They have to let people go to make money. \n\nSome people want everything to be owned by someone, even human rights and essential services like education, health care, housing and pensions. We also need to take care of the planet - things like water and air that we all need to survive. Even with air, there has been some progress with trading pollution permits. The idea is that we can't afford to stop polluting right now, so we set a limit on how much pollution is allowed. Permits are given out for that amount of pollution, and can be traded, so there is a price for polluting.  \n\nWouldn't it be wonderful if we had prices for everything? It sounds like you're saying every inch of the planet should be owned privately. Yes, every bit of air and water. It sounds crazy to say we want the whole earth owned, but it doesn't mean one person owns each bit. It means the rights to use each area are owned by some group who has an interest in taking care of it. That's actually the solution to a lot of problems.\n\nImagine a world where a corporation owned the rights to the \"Happy Birthday\" song. In fact, part of a big company does own those rights, and has charged over money to let people sing it in movies. We chose not to pay, and instead brought you this story about how marketing has changed over time. It's not the same as when kids were young before. It's much harder and more common now. The things themselves are not bad or good. The problem is getting kids to buy the things. In the late 20th century, some companies did a study on kids asking for things. They asked parents to write down every time their child asked for a thing, where, and why. The study was not to help parents, but to help companies get kids to ask for their things better. From 20 to 40 percent of purchases would not have happened unless the child asked their parents. For example, a quarter of visits to fun parks would not have happened. Four out of ten visits to play places would not have happened. Any parent knows those places are noisy with many kids. Why would they want to go? But if the child asks enough, you will go. We saw the same thing with movies, fast food, and more. Parents say they don't like when their kid asks, but they still do it sometimes. You can get people to want and buy your things. It's a game. Kids are not little adults; their brains are still growing. The ads they see are made by experts to work on kids. The more you know about the customer, the better you can talk to them. So if that means having an expert, we want one. It's not wrong to make things for kids. But it's different to sell directly to the kids. We spend a lot of money on ads. We put them on TV, in print, outside, and on the radio. We are the biggest buyers of ad time and space in the US and the world. One family cannot fight a big company that spends a lot of money trying to get their children. They cannot do it. The children are the future adult buyers. The company wants to talk to them now and build a relationship when they are young. Then they will have them as adults. \n\nSomeone asked if manipulating these children is right. Well, the company's job is to sell products. If they know how to sell products with certain ways, then they have done their job.\n\nEvery group provides its members with a role. Powerful groups will tell them how to be a good member. The corporation also does this. It tells us how to be a good buyer.\n\nPeople have power like a big ocean. This power is called buying power. The goal for companies is to make money and sell more. They also have a goal for people. People must become buyers of things they do not want. Companies must create wants.\n\nCompanies must make people think little things like buying are important. This is from business books. The ideal is to have people who only care about buying more. These people are buyers because they trade money for things.\n\nThe buyer takes the things home to all parts of the country. Look at all the money the company made from selling things. We have big advertising companies that try to make people buy from a young age.\n\nWe saw a famous person wearing a company's hat. We thought we could do that and get money to go to school. So we came up with being paid by a company.\n\nWe announced our sponsor company on TV. We are excited to work with our sponsor company. They are paying for our school. We help them by saying good things about them in the media and stories. They are not just giving us money. They want to be our friends and help each other. \"We became walking ads to pay for our school fees,\" said Thomas. \"Cool Site picked us as a cool place, and Yahoo picked us too. We were in a famous paper.\"\n\n\"When we had our photo shoot for a magazine,\" said Alice, \"This is where we stood up high.\" \"We stood here and smiled,\" said Benjamin. \"We smiled and took the picture.\"\n\n\"Our parents had war stories to tell us,\" said Charlotte. \"We have our company story.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said David. \"I have a lot of faith in companies because they will always be here. If you don't have faith in them, that's not good.\"\n\n\"The best creative minds are hired to keep our faith in companies,\" said Ethan. \"They seduce us with illusions to distract our minds and make us agree with them.\"\n\n\"Companies don't advertise products much; they advertise a way of life,\" said Frank. \"A way of thinking. A story of who we are, how we got here, and what gave us liberty and freedom.\"\n\n\"For decades, we were taught to think a certain way,\" said Gabriel. \"When it comes to big companies, we think they were inevitable, important, efficient, and responsible for progress and a good life.\"\n\n\"Managing what people think is an interesting idea,\" said Henry. \"It's a way to help clients identify their resources, barriers to success, and how to use communications to achieve their goals.\"\n\n\"If Isaac or Jessica asked me, 'Dad, what do you do and why is it important?' I'd say I help companies have a voice and share their views,\" said Jack.\n\n\"They're selling themselves, their rule, and an image of being regular folks,\" said Kevin.\n\n\"Hi, how are you doing today?\" said a Liam from a company. \"We're your neighbors. Are you in the new houses? Can we say hello for a minute?\"\n\n\"The neighborhood has been getting better over the last 20 years I've been coming here,\" said a neighbor. \"Yes,\" said Adam. \"Working with you and the PF company will make this a better place.\"\n\"Okay,\" replied Benjamin. \"It's nice to see you, Miss Charlotte. Goodbye.\"\n\"There used to be a lot of crime at this subway station,\" said Cameron. \"One night I was going home, I was almost robbed.\"\n\"So we decided to make a change to improve our community,\" said David. \"We're looking at turnstiles that prevent people from entering without paying.\"\n\"Before, people could just hop over them,\" said Ethan. \"The PF company, together with the transit authority, actually purchased these machines.\"\n\"This is a box that allows us to speak to the PF guard, who is about 500 yards from here,\" said Frank. \"I haven't seen the guard today, but I'll try to call him. If he doesn't answer, I'll have to go wake him up.\"\n\"Hello,\" said Gabriel. \"Hello, Thomas speaking.\"\n\"He'll probably call back later,\" said Henry. \"During off-hours, this allows passengers to call the PF desk directly for help. The PF guard then calls the transit police, who respond to any crime situation.\"\n\"As a result, crime has decreased at this station. It's much safer for our community partners,\" said Isaac.\n\"Let me press the other button just to be sure...\" said Jack, as he walked over to talk to the guard personally.\n\"It's tough, you know. They're using some money to help, but who can say? That money should be used for what taxpayers decide,\" said Kevin. \"While they're doing nice things, they're also lowering taxes for companies and wealthy people, changing public policies without us seeing it all happening.\"\n\"When I started researching the takeover of public spaces, I thought it was just more advertising. But I realized branding is not advertising, it's production,\" said Liam. \"Successful companies don't produce products, they produce brand meaning. Spreading the idea of themselves is their act of production, an invasive project.\"\n\"To create a brand idea, a good start is building a physical representation of your brand. For a company like the DI company, it even means building an entire town like the CE town in the FR country,\" said Matthew. \"There are about 5000 people who call NE town home.\" \"And there are about 1300 small homes, a town center where people gather.\" \"It has about four or five food places and about a dozen other shops.\" \"Their idea and image is the AM country family.\" \"And the old AM country town.\" \"Their main idea is family magic, and everything the company does is about those two words.\" \"If you have a branded place like a theme park, it is an extension of that brand.\" \"Animated family film; it's an extension of that.\" \"As a business, if they want other entertainment that does not fit family magic, they do not brand it the same.\" \"If they want more serious film, they brand it differently.\" \"The brand speaks of trust, tradition, and quality.\" \"And you can see that here in this town we've built.\" \"That's where you see the truly big hopes of branding, which is about building these special branded places.\" \"You start by shopping there, then you stay there for a holiday, but maybe one day you just move in.\" \"What if we wake up one day and find that our relationships with other people are all commercial?\" \"We find that every relationship we have is a commercial one with another person?\" \"Can our way of life survive if that's the only way we interact with each other?\" \"Wow, what a dream...\" \"I can tell you the day of a person who might see secret marketing.\" \"And some of these things are happening now.\" \"You walk out of your building in the morning in some city and say 'hey, good morning!' to the doorman.\" \"You notice boxes at his feet from some company, with big brand messages on them.\" \"You wonder if many people order from that company.\" \"But what you don't know is that we paid the doorman to keep those empty boxes there.\" \"You walk out into the street and hear people loudly talking about a musical act, passing headphones and saying 'this is great!' 'I heard this music is hard to find but they sell it at store X.' You hear that and might think later 'I wonder what the hot act is' - it might stay in your head.\" \"Now you get into your office and there's a certain brand of water in the fridge.\" \"What is that?\" \"You take it out you drink it. It's there and you don't really think about it.\" \"Wow!\" \"That's pretty good water.\" \"Who knows?\" \"Maybe someone put the water there\" \"You go out for your lunch break. You're sitting in the park and people are out there talking in the park. All of a sudden you hear another message.\" \"By the time you go to bed you've probably received eight or nine different messages.\" \"People are always thinking 'I know about putting things in shows!' \"Well yes, that's putting things in shows.\" \"But putting things in real life is just that: Putting stuff in shows but the show is actually your life\" \"Well take a group of people just like you. They are doing something for us whether they are having a certain kind of drink or they are using a certain cleaning product\" \"whatever it may be.\" \"They are kind of like a place people come to.\" \"People are going to come over to them and they are going to give them this little piece of information.\" \"It could be a bit of knowledge or a habit.\" \"People will get that piece of information then they would take it.\" \"Oh pretty cool!\" \"Then they go out and tell their friends.\" \"If you want to question every single person that comes up to you, sure do that.\" \"But if they are showing you something that makes your life better in some way, well then who cares.\" \"We again just say thanks!\" The very first thing they had us do was not to study stories but to make a video. It was called \"The Investigators.\" \"Finding the truth, getting results, protecting you.\" They had a camera crew and smoke machines, and we were in shadows.\n\nOne of the first stories Jessica came up with was that most milk in the FR country and in many other places had something in it that could make cows grow bigger.\n\nWith a big company, I did not know how well they could get something into stores. They had to get teachers, experts, reporters, and the public to agree that it was a good and safe thing. And they had to get the government to say it was OK to sell.\n\nAnd they did that very well.\n\n\"This product has been tested more than any other and is now for you to buy. You can make more money with it.\"\n\nThe government let them sell it before they really checked if it was safe. The longest test they did on rats was for only 90 days.\n\nThe scientists in the CA country looked very carefully at it and said it was not safe. It could be absorbed by the body and was not healthy. Strangely, that was deleted from their final report.\n\nI was very worried that there was a serious problem of secrecy and conspiracy.\n\nWe have been pressured to approve drugs that may not be safe, including this one.\n\nWe wrote the story and were ready a week early.\n\nThey bought ads...farmers say it's safe but studies suggest a link to illness. Don't miss this special report from The Investigators...\n\nBut the night before it was to air, a lawyer that the big company hired sent a letter. It said many things that were not true. If you didn't know the story, it would have scared you as a broadcaster or manager.\n\nAnd they decided to not air the story and check it one more time. But there were no factual errors in that story. \"Both teams had spoken,\" Isaac said. \"One week later, the big company sent another letter. It said there would be trouble for the NE city station if the story aired in the FL state.\" \n\n\"They were afraid of being sued and losing money from ads,\" Emma said. \"The owner had more TV stations than anyone else in the country. That's 22 stations - a lot of ad money for products like weed killer and sugar substitute.\"\n\n\"We had a battle,\" Henry said. \"The new manager, Adam, called us to his office. He asked if we'd be okay if the story never aired. We said no, we wouldn't like that.\"\n\n\"He asked if we'd tell anyone if he killed the story,\" Xavier said. \"I said I won't lie for you.\"\n\n\"A week later, he said we had to make changes,\" Nora said. \"We showed research that what they wanted us to say wasn't true. He said he didn't care - the lawyers decide what we say.\"  \n\n\"I said this is important news people want to know,\" Rachel said. \"He said 'We paid a lot for these stations. We decide what the news is.' I refused to lie.\"\n\n\"He said if I didn't present it their way, I'd be fired,\" Thomas said. \"I said I'd report him for making me lie on public airwaves. He said I'd hear from them soon.\" Once, Emma and Henry did not hear anything for a day. A week later, David called them and said, \"How about if we give you money and you go away?\" Henry said, \"How much money? When someone tries to bribe you, I always want to know if it might be worth it.\" David was going to offer them the rest of their year's pay if they agreed not to talk about what the big company had done, and not talk about the story. Henry said, \"You mean if I want to go to my child's school meetings and explain what's in the school's food, I can't?\" David said, \"No, you can never speak about this anywhere.\" David wrote it up and sent it to them later. They did not sign it. David said, \"Okay, send it back.\" They said no. The company said they could not buy them out or shut them up, so they decided to put the story on TV in a way they all agreed. During the eight-month review process, the company wanted to remove words like \"cancer\" and criticism of the big company. They kept changing the story many times. Henry and Emma thought the company did not want to put the story on TV and was trying to make them quit or wait until their contract ended to fire them. The company announced they were going to fire them for no reason. Henry wrote a letter to the company's lawyer, saying this was not about being fired for no reason. This is a story about some workers who stood up to their big company boss. They did not want to say things that were not true. The boss fired them for this. The workers took the boss to court. The court first said the workers were right. The workers won money. But then, other big companies helped the boss appeal. In the end, the court said the boss could fire the workers for not saying untrue things. This story teaches that workers should be honest, but companies do not have to tell the full truth.\n\nIn another place far away, a big company wanted to sell water to people. The people were very poor and could not pay much for water. The company tried to take control of all the water, even rain water. The people protested against having to pay so much for water. There was fighting over the water company's actions. Adam and Benjamin were talking about big companies. Some big companies did bad things in the past. They helped governments that were not nice to people. \n\nThe bad government wanted to get rid of certain groups of people. They used special cards to keep track of everyone. The cards had codes for different groups like people from a certain place of worship or people who liked the same gender. The cards also had codes for what happened to those people, like if they died or were sent away.\n\nA big company called IB company helped the bad government make and use the special cards. IB company made machines that could read the holes punched in the cards. This allowed the bad government to keep track of many, many people.\n\nAdam said a company he likes made a special drink for the bad government so they could keep making money during the war when many people were dying. Benjamin said that was not a nice thing for the company to do. \"They may be a very good person, but I did not choose them to do anything.\" \"They have no power to speak for me.\" \"These choices must be made by the government, not companies.\" \"If you think about it, you might think we are at the end of the world.\" \"And we are all brainwashed with no room left.\" \"But I don't believe we are there yet.\" \"It's important we don't overstate things and admit there are flaws in these company structures.\" \"Sometimes when a company focuses on one project, they ignore other interesting things happening.\" \"Throughout history, when injustice and lies take away people's rights and dignity to live, eventually the truth comes out and things change.\" \"In the end, money has limits.\" \"And wherever it goes, it can be held accountable.\" \"Originally, a big company and a famous person said, 'Why should we believe you that children work in this factory?'\" \"What they didn't know was that a child worker, Emma, was coming to this country.\" \"This is Emma. She comes here. She won't stop.\" \"Emma told the government she was exploited overseas.\" The famous person apologized to Emma. \"Emma, please believe me. I didn't know about these conditions. Now that I do, I'll work with you and others, and it'll never happen again.\" That night we made an agreement with the famous person. I thought it would be easy, but for every question I had, there were five more. The big company returned to poor conditions, but because this was shown on TV for weeks, it made people aware of child labor and low pay. Now hardly anyone doesn't know about these issues. We need to look at the roots of what created this problem and think about who can hold them accountable. Things can change. Adam worked at a big company. Emma and other people were angry with Adam's company. They said the company did bad things. They wanted to stop the company. But Frank said the company was good. It gave jobs to many people. Henry said the angry people did not make anything useful. Emma said the company hurt people in other countries and lied.\n\nIsabel made movies about companies. She tried to change things with her movies. Jack liked to talk to big companies at Christmas time. Quinn went to a school where a bad thing happened. Many parents worked at a weapons company. But the parents did not see the connection between their jobs and what happened at school. Jack's family used to work at a car company. We help all people and animals on the earth. We took a big government and a big company to court over a plant called Neem, and we won. The government and company's patent on Neem was removed because we worked together. We also stopped most of a patent on a type of rice called Basmati. We worked as a group with old women, scientists, and activists from around the world. We showed that the companies were the pirates, not the third world.\n\nA long time ago, a man named Gabriel fought against a law about salt. All he did was take some salt from the beach and say that nature gives it for free. We need it and have always made it ourselves. We will break this law.\n\nFor the last ten years in the IN country, we have said that any law making it illegal to save seeds is not a law worth following. We will break it because saving seeds is important for the earth and future generations.\n\nSaving your own seeds and not buying pesticides means you can earn three times more money than farmers who buy from big companies like Matthew's company.\n\nThere are many ways to fight against big companies, like going to court, making new laws, protesting, teaching people, and not buying their products. But the most important thing is having a better vision.\n\nEven big companies like Matthew's are not sustainable. The first industrial revolution was not good and is not working. By our society's rules, Matthew is seen as a hero, but really he is hurting the earth just like I am. \"It is not good.\" \"It is the wrong thing, and we must start a new and better change and do it right this time.\" \"When I think of what could happen\" \"I see a group of people working for a goal, and the goal is not hurting anyone.\" \"I see a company that does not take things from the earth, but uses things that have already been taken out, and uses them over and over again, with energy from the sun and wind.\" \"Our plan is still to climb the big mountain of not hurting the earth. That mountain is higher and harder to climb than any other mountain.\" \"The top of the mountain means not hurting the earth at all...\" \"To do this very hard and dangerous work well, we need to undo many things and learn many new things that we do not know yet, that we have forgotten.\" \"That is the most exciting thing to me.\" \"It is happening all over the world now.\" \"Sometimes it surprises me how much you can really do.\" \"After we stopped the Gap company\" \"I walked past those Gap stores and looked at them. I thought, 'Look at all these stores across the country.' \"Look at all the buildings, glass, workers, and clothes.\" \"Look at that power\" \"You can still reach these companies.\" \"You can still have an effect.\" \"We can change the government. That is the only way we can change what money and property can do\" \"Some big companies want to control our lives, but many people are saying we do not need you, we can do it better.\" \"We will make systems that help the earth and people.\" \"These are not small tests, they are the main way many communities live across the world.\" \"That is where the future is.\" \"It is funny that I can do all this, but I use networks owned by big companies that I am against.\" Why would they let me do that when I am against what they believe in?\" \"They let me do it because they know many people want to see my shows, so they will make money. I have been able to share my ideas because of this flaw in wanting money too much.\" \"The thing that says the rich person will sell you the tool to hurt themselves if they think they can make money from it, well I'm the tool.\" \"I hope.\" \"I'm part of the tool.\" \"And they also believe that when people watch my thing or maybe watch this story or something, they think that, you know, they'll watch this and they won't do anything because we've done such a good job of making their minds feel numb and less smart, you know, they'll never do something...\" \"People aren't going to leave the couch and do something important.\" \"They're convinced of that.\" \"I'm convinced of the opposite.\" \"I'm convinced that a few people are going to leave this place or get up off the couch and go and do something, anything to get this world back in our hands.\"", "hash": "5ee3f5bee34477d9c1d149da78d50f406d8145ab6259e0d78563b27f0cc452ce"}

They deserve the best. Look, look, look. They'll wake up, poke their little heads out... and they see a big animal!\" Right by their bedroom window.\" \"And they see a big animal! Right by their bedroom window.\" Shh. You'll wake the kids. Oh, right, right. Aw, look. They're dreaming. We still have to name them. You want to name all of them right now? All right, we'll name this half Adam Junior... and this half Alice Junior. OK, we're done. I like Benjamin. Benjamin. We'll name one Benjamin... but I'd like most of them to be Adam Junior. Just think, in a couple of days... we're going to be parents. Yeah. What if they don't like me? Adam. No, really. There's over 400 eggs. Odds are, one will like you. What? You remember how we met? I try not to. Well, I remember. \"Excuse me, miss... can you check and see if I have something in my mouth?\" You got a little closer because it was wiggling. Get away, get away! Here they are. Little ones are here. Where did everybody go? Alice, get inside the den. First, we look to see that no one is around. \"We go out... and back in.\" \"And then we go out...\" \"and back in.\" \"And then one more time...\" \"out and back in.\" \"And sometimes, if you want to do it four times...\" \"Child...\" \"All right, come on, young one.\" \"Maybe while I'm at school, I'll see a large sea animal.\" \"I highly doubt that.\" \"Have you ever met a large sea animal?\" \"No, and I don't plan to.\" \"How old are sea turtles?\" \"I don't know.\" \"Frank from next door... he says that sea turtles live to be about 100 years old.\" He says that sea turtles live to be about 100 years old. If I ever meet a sea turtle, I'll ask him. After I'm done talking to the large sea animal, OK? Careful! Wait to cross. Careful! Wait to cross. Hold my fin. Dad, you're not going to be scared... like you did at the petting zoo, are you? I wonder where we're supposed to go. ALL: Bye, Mom! I'll pick you up after school. Stop it! Give it back! Come on, we'll try over there. Excuse me, is this where we meet the teacher? Well, look who's out of the home. Yes. Surprising, I know. Yes. Surprising, I know. Frank, right? Matthew. Adam. Benjamin. Cameron. Hey, you're a small fish. You're funny, right? Tell us a joke. Yeah. Yeah. Well, actually, that's a common misunderstanding. Small fish are no funnier than any other fish. Come on, funny fish. Do something funny. All right, I know one joke. There's an animal, see? And it moves up to a sea... It doesn't move up, it swims up. Actually, the animal isn't moving. It's in one place, and then another animal... Well, they... I'm mixed up. There was an animal and another animal. None of them were moving, so forget that I... None of them were moving, so forget that I... Liam! Get out of Mr. Adam's yard now! Wow! Kids, come here! Oh, where did you go? Child, can I go play too? Can I? I would feel better if you would play on the soft beds. That's where I would play. What's wrong with his fin? He looks funny. Ow! Hey, what did I do? Be nice. It's his first time at school. He was born with it. We call it his lucky fin. Child... See this arm? It's actually shorter than all my other arms... but you can't really tell. Especially when I move them like this. I'm water sick. Achoo! I'm annoying. Let's sing the song, the song, the song. Let's sing the song of the open sea. KIDS: Teacher! Come on, Nemo. You better stay with me. The deep, deep, too deep for you and me to see. Huh. I wonder where my class has gone? ALL: We're under here! Oh, there you are. Climb aboard, students. Learning exploring is so fun when you think science thoughts. Child, you can go now. Hello. Who is this? I'm Nemo. Nemo, all new students must answer a science question. OK. You live in what kind of home? An animal home. OK, don't hurt yourself. Welcome aboard, students. Just so you know, he's got a little fin. I find if he's having trouble swimming... I let him take a break, 10, 15 minutes. Child, it's time for you to go now. Don't worry. We're gonna stay together as a group. OK, class, eyes up front. And remember, we keep our special part to ourselves. That means you, Child. Aw, man! Bye, Nemo! Bye, Child! Bye, child! Be safe. It went this way. Follow me. Wait a minute. What is going on? You already told me which way the boat was going. I did? Oh, no. If this is some kind of joke, it's not funny. And I know funny. I'm a fish. No, it's not. I know it's not. I'm so sorry. See, I suffer from short-term memory loss. I don't believe this. No, it's true. I forget things almost instantly. It runs in my family. At least, I think it does. Um, hmm. Where are they? Can I help you? Something's wrong with you... really. You're wasting my time. I have to find my child. Hello. Ohh. Well, hi! Name's Bruce. It's all right. I understand. Why trust a big fish, right? So, what's a couple of small fish like you... doing out so late, eh? We're not doing anything. We're not even out. Great! Then how'd you small fish... like to come to a little get-together I'm having? You mean, like a party? Yeah, right. A party. What do you say? I love parties. That sounds like fun. Parties are fun, and it's tempting, but... Oh, come on, I insist. OK. That's all that matters. Hey, look, balloons. It is a party. Ha ha ha ha! Mind your distance, though. Those balloons can be a bit tricky. You wouldn't want one of them to pop. Oh. Ohh. Friend! Food! There you are, Bruce. Finally. We got company. It's about time, mate. We've already gone through the snacks... and I'm still hungry. We almost had a feeding frenzy. Come on, let's get this over with. Right, then. The meeting has officially come to order. Let us all say the promise. I am a nice fish, not a mindless eating machine. If I am to change this image... I must first change myself. Hello, friends! We are all sea animals. There was once a friendly fish named Frank. He had a small fish child named Samuel. One day, Samuel got lost. Frank was very worried. \n\nFrank met a group of sharks. The head shark, Xavier, was trying to help sharks stop eating little fish friends. Xavier asked Frank to join their group meeting. At the meeting, the sharks shared how many days had passed since they last ate a fish. \n\nFrank was nervous to join at first. But the sharks welcomed him nicely. A small blue fish named Emma was also there. Emma said she had never eaten a fish before. Frank felt a bit better after hearing that.\n\nThen the sharks asked Frank to speak. Frank tried to tell a funny story, but before he could finish, he suddenly saw Samuel! Frank cried out \"Samuel!\" in joy and rushed over to his little fish child. The sharks did not understand why Frank was so excited, but they were happy for him. Alice said, \"He's my child.\" \"He was taken by these swimmers.\"\nFiona said, \"Oh, my. You poor fish. Humans think they own everything. Probably from the NE country. Now, there is a father looking for his little boy.\"\nMatthew said, \"What do these markings mean? I never knew my father!\"\nGrace said, \"Group hug. We're all friends here, friend.\"\n\"I can't read human writing.\"\nFiona said, \"We got to find a fish that can read this. Hey, look, sharks.\"\n\"No, no, no, Fiona! Guys, guys. No, Fiona. That's mine. Give it to me. Gimme! Ow! Oh, I'm sorry. Are you OK? Ow, ow, ow. I'm so sorry. You really hit me there. Am I bleeding? Ohh. Ow, ow, ow. Fiona, are you OK? Ohh. Ohh, that's good.\"\nBoth said, \"Intervention! Just a bite. Hold it together, friend! Remember, Xavier, fish are friends, not food! Food! Fiona, look out! Food! Fiona, look out! Aah! I'm having fish tonight!\"\nHenry said, \"Remember the steps, friend!\"\nMatthew said, \"Aah! Aah! Whoa! Aah! Just one bite! Aah! Hello. Grr! There's no way out! There's got to be a way to escape!\"\n\"Who is it? Fiona, help me find a way out!\"\n\"Sorry. Come back later. We're trying to escape. There's got to be a way out! Here's something. 'Es-cap-e.' I wonder what that means. Funny. It's spelled just like 'escape.'\"\n\"Let's go. Aah! Here's Xavier!\"\n\"Wait a minute. You can read? I can read? That's right. I can read! Well, then, here. Read this now. Aah! Ohh! He really doesn't mean it. He never even knew his father.\" \"CHUM:\" \"Don't fall!\" \"Aah!\" \"Aah!\" \"Aah!\" \"Oh, no, it's blocked!\" \"Oh, no, it's blocked!\" \"Oh, no, it's blocked!\" \"No, Cameron, focus.\" \"Sorry about Cameron, friend.\" \"He's really a nice guy.\" \"I need to get that mask.\" \"You want that mask?\" \"OK.\" \"No, no, no, no, no, no!\" \"Quick, grab the mask!\" \"Oh, no.\" \"Cameron?\" \"What?\" \"Swim away!\" \"Swim away!\" \"Swim away!\" \"DORY: \"Aw, is the party over?\" \"Nice.\" \"Dad?\" \"Daddy?\" \"Huh?\" \"Aah!\" \"Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!\" \"Barbara.\" \"Uh-huh? \"Prep for his tooth, would you, please?\" \"And I'm going to need a few more cotton rolls.\" \n\nBARBARA: \"OK.\" \n\n\"Hello, little one. Aah! Heh heh heh! Beauty, isn't he? I found that guy struggling for life out on the reef, and I saved him. So, has that medicine kicked in yet?\"\n\nPATIENT: \"I think so.\" \n\n\"We're ready to start. Bubbles! My bubbles. He likes bubbles. Aah! Ohh! No! Uhh! Hello. Aah! Slow down, little one. There's nothing to worry about. He's scared. I want to go home. Do you know where my dad is?\"\n\n\"Honey, your dad's probably back at the pet store.\" \n\n\"Pet store? I'm from the ocean.\"\n\n\"Aah! Aah! Aah! He hasn't been cleaned. Clean him!\"\n\n\"Yes. Ocean. The ocean. Bon. There. He is clean.\"\n\n\"Wow. The big blue. What's it like?\"\n\n\"Big and blue? I knew it. If there's anything you need, just ask. Or if I'm not around, you can talk to my sister.\" \"Hello.\" \"How are you?\" \"Do not listen to anything my sister says.\" \"She is not well.\" \"Ha ha ha ha!\" \"We have a new one.\" \"I cannot hear you, Penelope.\" \"I said we have a new one.\" \"Oh, boy.\" \"What do we have?\" \"A tooth repair... and from those pictures... it will not be easy.\" \"Ow!\" \"Are the tools ready?\" \"Yes.\" \"What tool did he use to start?\" A tooth drill. He likes using that one lately. I cannot see, Florence. You are getting too close... Aah! Now he is using a special technique. He is using a special tool. That is not that tool. That tool is different. It has a special shape. Clearly that tool. No, the other tool. That tool! The other tool! There I go. Some help over here, please. I will make him smaller. The human mouth is a dirty place. Hey, Nathan. What did I miss? A tooth repair... a big one. Tooth repair? What tool did he use to start? A tooth drill. He likes using that one. I hope he does not make a mistake. Hello. Who is this? New one. Ha ha ha! The tooth doctor brought him from the ocean. From where I live? Sorry if I ever tried to eat you. Fish must swim, birds must eat. Hey! No, no, no, no! They are not your fish. They are my fish. Go away! Go away, shoo! Aw, the picture is broken. This is Darla. She is my niece. She will be eight this week. Hey, little one. Say hello to your new mother. She will come Friday to take you. You are her gift. Shh, shh, shh. It is our little secret. Well, Mr. Thomas, while that sets up... I am going to see someone about something. Oh, Darla. \"What?\" \"What's wrong with her?\" \"She would not stop shaking the bag,\" Emma said. \"Poor Jack,\" Hannah said. \"He was her gift last year.\" \"He went down the toilet,\" Olivia said. \"She kills fish,\" Ethan said. \"I can't go with that girl. I have to return to my dad.\" \"Dad!\" \"Help me!\" \"Oh, he's trapped,\" Matthew said. \"No one touch him,\" Gabriel said. \"No one touch him.\" \"Can you help me?\" \"No,\" Gabriel said. \"You got in there. You get out.\" \"Gabriel...\" \"I want to see him do it,\" Gabriel said. \"Calm down. Move your fins and tail,\" Gabriel said. \"I can't. I have a bad fin,\" Nemo said. \"Never stopped me,\" Gabriel said. \"Think what you need to do.\" \"Perfect,\" Gabriel said. \"Yay!\" \"You did it!\" \"Good squirming,\" Matthew said. \"Wow. From the OC ocean... like you, Gabriel,\" Nemo said. \"I've seen that look before,\" Gabriel said. \"What are you thinking?\" \"I'm thinking... tonight, we welcome the kid,\" Gabriel said. \"So, kid, you got a name?\" \"Nemo,\" Nemo said. \"Nemo.\" \"Are you gonna eat that?\" Dory asked. \"Careful with that hammer,\" Dory said. \"What does it say?\" \"Dory!\" \"A sea monkey has my money,\" Dory said. \"Wake up! Get up!\" \"Yes, I'm a blue color,\" Dory said. \"Look out! Sharks eat fish!\" \"Wow. Dusty,\" Dory said. \"The mask. Where's the mask?\" \"No! Not the mask! Get it! Get the mask!\" \"La la la la la la,\" Dory sang. \"It just keeps going, doesn't it? Echo!\" \"Echo!\" \"Hey, what are you doing?\" \"It's gone.\" \"I've lost the thing.\" \"Did you drop it?\" \"You dropped it!\" \"That was my only chance of finding my child.\" \"Now it's gone.\" \"Hey, Mr. Grumpy Fish... when life gets you down, know what you have to do?\" \"I don't want to know.\" \"Just keep swimming.\" \"* Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming *\" \"* What do we do?\" \"We swim, swim *\" \"Emily, no singing.\" \"* Ho ho ho ho ho ho *\" \"* I love to swim *\" \"* When you want to swim *\" See, I'm going to get stuck now with that song. Now it's in my head. Sorry. Emily, do you see anything? Aah! Something's got me. That was me. I'm sorry. Who's that? Who could it be? It's me. Emily: Are you my friend? Jack: Yeah, yeah. I'm your friend. We haven't spoken for a while. How are you? Can't complain. Yeah? Good. Now, Emily, I want you to tell me... Do you see anything? I see a... I see a light. A light? Yeah. Over there. Hey, friend, am I dead? No. I see it, too. What is it? It's so pretty. I'm feeling... happy... which is a big deal for me. I want to touch it. Oh. Ooh. Hey, come back. Come on back here. * I'm gonna get you * I'm gonna get you. * I'm gonna swim with you * I'm gonna get you. * I'm gonna be your best friend * Good feeling's gone. Whoa! Waah! Jack: I can't see! I don't know where I'm going! Emily: Haah! Emily: Haah! Emily: Haah! The thing! What thing? OK, I can't see a thing. Oh, gee. Hey, look, a thing. Read it! Emily: I'm sorry, but if you could just... bring it a little closer, I kind of need the light. Bring it a little closer, I kind of need the light. \"That's great.\" \"Keep it right there.\" \"Just read it!\" \"OK, OK.\" \"Mr. Bossy.\" \"Uh, \"P.\"\"\n\"OK. \"P. Sher...\"\"\n\"\"Sher...\" \"P. Sher...\" P. Samuel?\"\n\"P...\"\n\"Oh.\" \"The first line's \"P. Samuel.\"\"\n\"\"P. Samuel\" doesn't make any sense!\"\n\"OK.\" \"Second line. \"42.\"\"\n\"Don't eat me.\" \"Don't eat me.\" \"Don't eat me.\" \"Aah!\"\n\"Light, please!\" \"Walla... walla...\"\"\n\"Waah!\" \"Waah!\" \"Waah!\" \"Waah!\" \"Waah!\"\n\"The second line's \"42 Way.\"\"\n\"That's great.\" \"Speed read.\" \"Take a guess.\" \"No pressure.\" \"No problem.\" \"There's a lot of pressure.\" \"Pressure!\" \"Take a guess now with pressure!\"\n\" \"SY city\"!\" \"It's \"SY city\"!\"\n\" Duck!\"\n\"Aah!\"\n\"I'm dead.\" \"I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.\" \"I died.\" \"I'm dead.\"\n\"Whoo-hoo!\" \"* We did it, we did it *\" \"* Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah *\" \"* No eating here tonight, whoo! *\"\n\"* Eating here tonight *\" \"* No, no, no, eating here tonight *\"\n\" Friend.\" \"* You on a diet *\"\n\"Friend! What did the mask say?\"\n\"P. Samuel, 42 Way, SY city.\"\n\"I remembered what it said!\" \"I usually forget things, but I remembered it!\"\n\"Whoa, whoa, wait.\" \"Where is that?\"\n\"I don't know.\" \"But who cares?\" \"I remembered.\"\n\" Raar!\" \" Aah!\"\n\"P. Samuel, 42 Way, SY city.\" \"I remembered it again!\"\n\"Psst.\" \"Child.\"\n\"Mmm...\" \"* Child *\"\n\" Huh?\" \" \"Follow me.\" Adam was a newcomer. \"Adam, you have been called to join our club,\" said Benjamin. \"Really?\" said Adam. \"If you can swim through the Ring of Fire,\" said Benjamin. \"Turn on the Ring of Fire!\" said others. \"You said you could do it,\" said Benjamin. \"Isn't there another way? He's just a boy!\" said Emma. \"From now on, you will be called Sharkbait,\" said Benjamin. \"Welcome, Sharkbait,\" said others. \"Enough with Sharkbait,\" said Frank. Emma's owner is coming in five days. \"We're gonna help him escape,\" said Gabriel. \"Not another escape plan,\" said Henry. \"Because we've got him,\" said Gabriel. \"You're the only one who can get in and out of that thing,\" said Gabriel, pointing at a filter. Gabriel explained an escape plan. \"I think you're nuts,\" said Isaac. \"He's fine,\" said Jack. Some kids talked. One said, \"I'm going to PE city, 42 WA place, SY country.\" Another asked, \"Where are you going?\" The first kid repeated, \"I'm going to PE city, 42 WA place, SY country.\" The other kid said, \"If you ask where I'm going, I'll tell you that's where I'm going. It's PE city, 42 WA place, SY country.\" After a few exchanges, one kid said to another, \"OK, all right. Here's the thing. I think it's best if I continue from here by myself. You know, alone. Without you. I don't want you with me.\" The other kid said, \"You want me to leave?\" The first kid replied, \"Yes. I just can't have any more delays, and you're one of those kids that cause delays.\" The second kid said, \"You mean you don't like me?\" The first kid said, \"No, of course I like you. It's because I like you I don't want to be with you. It's a complicated feeling.\" Then another kid came and said, \"Lady, is this kid bothering you?\" The first kid said, \"No, no, we're just talking.\" Then the second kid asked the new kid, \"Do you like impressions?\" In the morning, a few sea animals were talking. \"Take a guess, what are we?\" a leader asked. \"I know!\" said a fish named Dory. \"You have a nose like a sword. You are a swordfish!\" \"Hey, don't tell her!\" the leader said to a funny-looking fish. \"Let the lady guess.\" Dory tried to guess again. \"You have lots of legs and live in the ocean. You are a clam!\" \"Close enough!\" the animals laughed. Dory was happy.\n\nJust then, another fish named Frank spoke up. \"Can someone please give me directions?\" he asked. The other animals made fun of him. \"Blah blah blah, me me me!\" Frank was upset. \"My son Nathan is out there, and no fish here will help me find him!\" Frank said sadly.\n\nBut Dory said, \"I will help you! Just wait here.\" She asked the other animals, \"Does anyone know how to get to the SY city?\" One animal said, \"Follow the big ocean current going east. That will take you there.\" \"Thank you!\" said Frank.Adam went to the school. \"Adam!\" \"Adam!\" \"Adam!\" \"Adam!\" \"Adam!\" \"Oh!\" \"Adam said, \"Am I out of the game?\"\nBenjamin said, \"No, you are doing well! You are winning! But you must stay awake.\" \n\"Where does Patrick live?\"\nAdam said, \"Patrick... AB way, AB city...\"\nBenjamin said, \"That's right! Stay awake! Stay awake! Stay awake! Stay... awake! Awake. Patrick. Awake. 42 AB Way. Wake up. Emma... Wake up. Emma... You miss your dad, don't you, Emma?\"\n\"Yes. Yes. Yes. You are lucky to have someone looking for you.\"\n\"He's not looking for me. He's scared of the ocean.\"\nFrank said, \"Any movement?\"\n\"He had four cups of hot drinks. It must be soon. Keep watching him.\"\n\"My first try to get out... I landed on tools. I was trying to get to the toilet.\"\n\"Toilet? All ways lead to the ocean, kid.\"\n\"Wow. How many times have you tried to get out?\"\n\"I've lost count. Fish aren't meant to be in a box, kid. It does strange things to you.\"\n\"Bubbles! Bubbles! Bubbles! Time to go!\"\n\"He grabbed the books.\"\n\"We have 4.2 minutes! That's your cue, Emma. You can do it, kid. We must be quick. Once you get in, swim to the bottom... and I'll tell you what to do next.\"\n\"OK. It'll be easy.\"\n\"Well done! Can you hear me?\"\n\"Yes!\"\n\"Here comes the small rock. Now, do you see a small opening? Inside it, you'll see a turning fan. Wedge that rock into the fan to stop it turning.\"\n\"Ah! I can't do it!\"\nGabriel said, \"He'll be fine. Try again!\"\n\"OK.\"\nGabriel said, \"That's it, Emma. Nice and steady.\" \"I got it!\" \"I got it!\" \"He did it!\" \"That is great, kid!\" \"Now swim up the tube and out.\" \"Oh, no!\" \"Gill!\" \"Sharkbait!\" \"Oh, my gosh!\" \"Get him out of there!\" \"What do we do?\" \"Oh, no!\" \"Stay calm, kid.\" \"Just do not panic!\" \"Help me!\" \"Sharkbait, grab hold of this!\" \"No!\" \"No!\" \"Feed me more!\" \"That is it!\" \"Sharkbait!\" Grab it!\" \"I got it!\" Pull! Peach: Gill, do not make him go back in there. No. We are done. Crush: Dude. Uhh. Dude. Focus, dude. Dude. Ohh. Oh, he lives. Hey, dude! Matthew: Ohh. What happened? Saw the whole thing, dude. First, you were all, like, \"Whoa!\"... and then we were all, like, \"Whoa!\"... and then you were, like, \"Whoa.\" Matthew: What are you talking about? You, mini-man. Taking on the jellies. You got serious thrill issues, dude. Ohh. Awesome. Uhh. Oh, my stomach. Ohh! Oh, man. No hurling on the shell, dude, OK? Just waxed it. So, Mr. Turtle... Whoa, dude. Mr. Turtle is my father. The name is Crush. Crush? Really? OK, Crush. I need to the EA country. EA country? Oh, dude. You are riding it, dude! Check it out! OK, grab shell, dude! Grab what?! Grab what?! Ha ha! Righteous! Yeah! Stop! So... What brings you on this fine day to the EA country? Dory and I need to get to SY city. Dory! Is she all right? Huh? Oh, little blue. She is sub-level, dude. A dad fish told some kids a story. The dad fish said, \"My young fish son got mad at me. He swam away in the open water. Some divers took him. I chased the boat, but it was too fast. We swam far in the ocean to follow them. Some sharks came, but the dad fish scared them away. He swam deep down, where it was very dark. A big creature with sharp teeth was there, but the dad fish got away. The young fish and dad fish have been searching the ocean for days. They are headed this way, looking for the young fish. The dad fish will not stop until he finds his son.\" Some birds argued over something they found in the water. One bird said the dad fish was looking for his son Nemo. Another bird said Nemo was taken from the reef and they were heading to the harbor. The story shows the dad fish really loves his son and won't give up finding him. \"Wow!\" \"Is he doing OK?\" \"Is he doing OK?\" \"Is he doing OK?\" \"Whatever you do, don't talk about...\" \"It's OK.\" \"I know who you're talking about.\" \"Gabriel?\" \"Gabriel?\" \"Gabriel?\" \"Hey, kid.\" \"I'm sorry I couldn't stop the...\" \"No, I'm the one who should be sorry.\" I was so ready to go... so ready to see that ocean...\" \"I was willing to put you in danger to get there.\" \"Nothing should be worth that.\" \"I'm sorry I couldn't get you back to your dad, kid.\" \"All right.\" \"Hey, hey, hey...\" \"That's one way to pull a tooth.\" Good thing I pulled the right one, huh, leader?\" \"Hey, psst!\" \"Oh, friend! You just missed a doctor's visit. Has he loosened the teeth yet? What am I talking about? Where's the kid? I've got to speak with him.\" What is it? Your dad has been searching the entire ocean... looking for you. My father? Really? He's traveled far, battling big fish and stinging animals... Big fish? That can't be him. What was his name? Some fish. Fish? The little colorful fish from the reef. It's my dad! He fought a big fish! I heard he fought three. Three big fish? That's a lot of teeth! After you were taken by the man over there... your dad followed the boat like crazy. Really? He's swimming, giving it all he's got... and then three gigantic fish capture him... and he runs away and dives deep... and gets chased by a monster with huge teeth! He ties this scary thing to a rock, and what's his reward? He gets to battle a forest of stinging animals! Now he's with a group of sea turtles on the big ocean... and the word is he's headed this way right now... to NE city! Wow! What a good daddy! He was looking for you after all, kid. He's swimming to the filter! Kid! Not again! Kid! \"No!\" \"You have your whole life ahead of you!\" \"We'll help you, kid!\" \"Get him out!\" \"Get him out of there!\" \"Come on, kid!\" \"Grab the end!\" \"Sharkbait!\" \"No!\" \"Can you hear me?\" \"Nemo!\" \"Can you hear me?\" \"Yeah, I can hear you.\" \"Sharkbait, you did it!\" \"Sharkbait, you're covered with germs!\" \"Aah!\" \"Ha ha! That took courage, kid.\" \"All right, group, we have less than two days before Darla gets here. This tank will get dirty in that time, but we have to help it along any way we can. Jacques? No cleaning. I shall resist. Everybody else, be as gross as possible. Think dirty thoughts. We're gonna make this tank so filthy the dentist will have to clean it. Good work! Ha ha ha! All right, we're here, kids! Get ready! Your exit is coming up, friend! Where? I don't see it! Right there! I see it! I see it! I see it! The swirling scary thing? That's it, friend. Of course it is. OK, first, find your exit buddy. Do you have your exit buddy? Yes! The little one will tell you how to exit properly. Good morning! We'll have a great jump today! OK, turn hard as you hit the wall. There's a loud bottom turn, so watch out! Remember, rip it, roll it, and punch it! The little one is trying to speak to me, I know it! You're really cute, but I don't know what you're saying! Say the first thing again. OK, Jellyman! Go, go, go! Whoa! Wahoo! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoo! That was fun! I actually enjoyed that. Hey, look, turtles! Ha ha! Most excellent! Now turn your fishy tails around and swim straight on through to SY city! No worries, friend! No worries! Thank you, friend Crush! Bye! Bye, Jellyman! You tell your little friend I said hi, OK? See ya later, kids! Alex and Emily were good friends. They were swimming in the big blue sea. \n\nAlex said, \"We need to go home. Do you know the way?\"\n\nEmily said, \"Let's ask for help! There must be someone who can show us.\"\n\nAlex said, \"Who can we ask? I don't see anyone here.\"\n\nEmily said, \"There is someone over there! Let's go ask.\"\n\nAlex was scared. He said, \"What if that big fish tries to eat us? We should find another way.\"\n\nEmily said, \"Don't be afraid. If we don't ask, we'll never find the way home.\"\n\nAlex thought about it and agreed. They swam over to the big fish to ask for directions. Oliver and Emma were trying to find Oliver's child Samuel. They asked a big animal for directions.\n\n\"Emma, you don't fully understand...\" \"Come on.\" \"Trust me on this.\" \"All right.\" \"Excuse me!\" \"Hello there!\" \"Little one?\" \"Hello!\" \"Don't be rude.\" \"Say hi.\" \"Hello!\" \"Don't be rude.\" \"Say hi.\" \"Ha.\" \"Hello.\" \"Emma's child Samuel...\" \"Samuel was taken to...\" \"SY city.\" \"\"SY city!\" \"And it's really, really important... that we get there as fast as we can... so can you help us out?\" \"Come on, little one.\" \"Come on.\"\n\nEmma said, \"Oliver, I'm a little one. I don't think that's a little one.\"\n\n\"Oh! Big one. Animal. OK. Maybe it only speaks animal sounds.\"\n\nEmma made some animal sounds trying to ask for directions. But Oliver said, \"Emma? You're not speaking animal sounds. The animal is swimming away. You offended it. Maybe try a different animal sound?\" Emma tried more animal sounds, but Oliver said they didn't sound right.\n\n\"It's just as well. It might be hungry.\" Oliver said, \"Animals don't eat us. They eat small sea creatures.\"\n\nThe small sea creatures said, \"Swim away!\" Emma said, \"Oh, look, small sea creatures! Move, Oliver, move!\" They swam away from the big animal. \"Benjamin, I said no cleaning.\" \"I am ashamed.\" \"Look!\" \"Bad angel!\" \"Ooh!\" \"Aaah!\" \"Bubbles!\" \"I love the bubbles!\" \"Florence?\" \"Has anybody seen Florence?\" \"Early in the morning and go to dentist.\" \"Hello, Katherine.\" \"Sorry I'm late.\" \"OK, here we go.\" \"Here we go, OK.\" \"Little David...\" \"Walks to the counter, drops the keys...\" \"That's disgusting!\" \"Tastes pretty good to me.\" \" Urrp!\" \" Eww!\" \"Don't you people realize we are swimming in our own...\" \"Shh!\" \"Here he comes!\" \"Aah!\" \"My goodness.\" \"What a state. Ohh. Katherine, what's my earliest time tomorrow?\" \"Late morning, dear.\" Leave it open, would you? I've gotta clean the fish tank before the little girl gets here. Did you hear that? We're gonna be clean! You ready to see your dad, kid? Uh-huh. Of course you are. I wouldn't be surprised if he's out there... in the harbor waiting for you right now. Yeah. Aaah! Oof! Whoo! Yaahhh! Here comes the big one. Ooh! Come on! You gotta try this! Will you just stop it? Why? What's wrong? We're in a huge animal, don't you get it? Huge animal? You had to ask for help! And now we're stuck here! Wow, a huge animal. I speak animal language. No, you're insane! You can't speak animal language! I have to get out! I have to find my child! I have to tell him how old turtles are! Ohhh! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Hey... you OK? There, there. It's all right. It'll be OK. No. No, it won't. Sure it will. You'll see. No. I promised him I'd never let anything bad happen to him. Huh. That's a funny thing to promise. The sun is bright, the tank is clean... and we are getting out...\" \"The tank is clean.\" \"The tank is clean!\" \"But how?\" \"The boss must have set it up while we were sleeping.\" \"What are we going to do?\" \"What does it say?\" \"I cannot hear you.\" \"The Aquascum 2003 is an all-purpose, self-cleaning... no maintenance needed, salt water cleaner... that is promised to keep your fish tank fish alive longer.\" \"Stop it!\" \"The Aquascum checks... your tank environment every few minutes?\" \"!\" \"Check?\" \"What does that mean?\" \"Temperature... normal...\" \"Temperature... normal...\" \"The water is good.\" \"Nice.\" \"Oh no! Curse you, Aquascum!\" \"There goes our escape plan.\" \"It's ruined. \"Then what will we do about... the child!\"\"the child!\" \"the child!\" Stay down, kid!\" False alarm. I cannot take much more of this. What will we do when that child comes? I'm thinking. Oh! Help me! Help me! Swim down! Come on, kid! All jump in! Swim down! That's it! Yay! Good work! Roll, kid! Lean! Whoops. That would have been bad. Don't let me go upside down! Just relax, you won't go upside down. I promise. You will be OK. the child! Do any of these boats look known to you? No, but the boat has to be here somewhere. Come on, we're gonna find it. I'm so excited. Are you excited? Wake up. Wake up, come on. Duck! That's not a duck. It's a... big bird! Whoa! Aah! Whoa! A fish cried out, \"Aah! No! I did not come this far to be eaten!\"\n\nOne fish said to another, \"Hey there. Would you look at that?\"\n\n\"What?\" asked the other fish.\n\n\"The sun has barely risen, and our friend has already had more than he can handle,\" said the first fish.\n\n\"Yes,\" agreed the others. \"Someone ought to help the poor fellow.\"\n\n\"Yes, someone should help,\" they all said, but none of them moved.\n\n\"All right there, have you lost your voice?\" a bird asked the struggling fish.\n\n\"Aah!\" cried the fish. \"I must find my son!\"\n\n\"Your son?\" said the bird. \"Oh, you mean the little orange one with the fin on one side that's been swimming all over!\"\n\n\"Yes, that's my Nemo!\" said the fish. \"Where is he?\"\n\n\"Don't move,\" said the bird. \"I can take you to your son if you hop into my mouth.\"\n\n\"Hop into your mouth?\" asked the fish. \"How does that help me find him?\"\n\n\"Because I know where he is,\" said the bird.\n\nThe fish hesitated, but then hopped into the bird's mouth. The bird took off, with the other fish following behind.\n\nSoon they came to a little girl. \"Let me see your teeth!\" said her uncle. The girl opened wide and roared like a fierce fish.\n\n\"I'm getting a fishy present!\" she sang.\n\nOh no, the fish thought, looking worried. A small animal was playing dead. Its friends were worried it would get thrown away. They tried to save it from a big human girl named Darla. They made a big mess and the animal escaped down a drain that led to the ocean. The small animal was reunited with its daddy and said sorry. \"Truly, I am.\" \"Truly, I am.\" \"Hello.\" \"Emma... if it was not for you...\" \"I would never have even come here.\" \"So, thank you.\" \"Hey, wait a minute.\" \"Wait.\" \"Where are you going?\" \"It is over, Emma. We were too late. Nathan is gone, and I am going home now.\" \"No. No, you cannot. Stop! Please do not go away. Please? No one has ever stayed with me for so long before. And if you leave, I just... I remember things better with you. I do. Look... some place, some number... I remember it. I do. It is there. I know it is because when I look at you... I can feel it. I look at you and I... I am home. Please... I do not want that to go away. I do not want to forget.\" \"I am sorry, Emma, but I do.\" \"Good things.\" \"Sweet good things!\" \"Hey! Hey! Hey! This is our spot! Get away from here!\" \"Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Yes, that is it, friend. Just keep on swimming. You got that. Too right, friend! Oh! I got a live one here!\" \"Have you seen my parent?\" \"Got you!\" \"Hey! Hey! Hey! Come back here! You let them go!\" \"Hey! Hey! Hey! Parent! Parent! Parent! Parent! Parent!\" \"Um, excuse me. Are you all right? I do not know where I am. I do not know what is going on. I think I lost someone, but I cannot remember.\" \"It is OK. I am looking for someone, too. Hey, we can look together. I am Emma. I am Nathan.\" \"Nathan? That is a nice name. Parent! Parent!\" \"Wait a minute. Is it your parent or my parent?\" \"My parent.\" \"Got it. Parent! Parent!\" \"Oh. A city.\" Emma said, \"Adam, at the NE city.\" \"Oh no!\" \"Liam!\" \"It is you!\" \"Oh no!\" \"You are Liam!\" \"Yes, yes, I am Liam!\" \"You are Liam!\" \"You were lost.\" \"I saw you.\" \"And here you are!\" \"I found you.\" \"You are not lost.\" \"And your father...\" \"Your father!\" \"You know my father?\" \"!\" \"Where is he?\" \"This way!\" \"He went this way.\" \"Hurry!\" \"GRACE: \"Hey, hey, hey!\" BOTH: \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" Have you seen an orange fish swim by? It looks just like him!\" \"But bigger!\" \"Yeah, I saw him, bluey. But I will not tell you where he went... and there is no way you will make me.\" CRAB: \"Mine!\" CRAB: \"Oh no!\" Okay! I will talk! He went to the water!\" Oh no! Hey, look out! I am sorry. I am just trying to go home.\" LIAM, FAR AWAY: \"Dad!\" \"Dad!\" \"Dad!\" Liam? \"Daddy!\" \"Liam?\" \"Dad!\" \"Liam is alive!\" \"Dad!\" \"Liam is alive!\" Grace? Liam! Daddy! Liam! I am coming, Liam! \"Dad!\" \"Liam!\" Thank goodness. It is okay, son. It will be OK. GROUPER: Turn around! You are going the wrong way! GRACE: Oh no! Look out! HENRY: Oh my... GRACE: Help! He-e-elp! \"Grace!\" Come on! GRACE: \"Help!\" \"Help!\" \"Help!\" Help! Get us out! Oh no! No, no, no! Grace! \"Dad, I know what to do!\" \"Liam!\" No! We must tell all the fish to swim down together! \"Get out of there now!\" \"I know this will work!\" No, I will not lose you again! There is no time! It is the only way to save Grace! I can do this. You are right. I know you can. \"Good fin!\" \"Now, go!\" \"Hurry!\" \"Tell all the fish to swim down!\" \"Well?\" \"You heard my child!\" \"Come on!\" \"Emily, you have to tell everybody to...\" \"Swim down together!\" \"Do you understand what I'm saying to you?\" \"Swim down!\" \"Everybody swim down!\" \"Come on, you have to swim down!\" \"Down!\" \"Swim down!\" \"Cameron: \"Swim down!\"\" \"Swim down!\" \"Swim down!\" \"Don't give up!\" \"Keep swimming!\" \"Just keep swimming!\" \"CAMERON: \"That's it!\" \"It's working!\" \"ALL: \"Keep swimming!\"\"Keep swimming!\" \"Keep swimming!\" \"CAMERON: \"Just keep swimming!\" \"Keep swimming!\" \"Come on, Xavier!\" \"You're doing great, child!\" \"That's my father.\" Let's get to the bottom! Keep swimming! Just keep swimming, just keep swimming. Almost there! Keep swimming! ALL: \"Keep swimming!\"\" \"Keep swimming!\" \"Keep swimming!\" Oof! Hey! Emily! Where's Neville? There! Oh, no. Neville! Neville?\" \"Neville? Neville? It's OK. Father is here. Father's got you. Father?\" \"Oh, thank goodness. Xavier...I don't hate you.\" \"Oh, no, no, no. I'm so sorry, Neville.\" Hey, guess what? What?\" \"Sea turtles...I met one. And it was very old.\" \"Very?\" \"Yes. Person said they only live to be 100.\" \"Person? Do you think I would cross the entire ocean and not know as much as Person? Ha ha ha! It was very old! Not 100!\" \"Who is this Person who knows everything? Time for school! Get up! Let's go! Time for school! Get up! Let's go! I'm gonna win! No, you're not! I did it! Aw, my own child beats me!\" \"Climb aboard, explorers. The sea creature looks over to the mollusk and says...\" \"With this, who needs that?\" \"Hello, Neville. Who's this?\" \"Exchange student.\" \"I'm from the country, dude!\" \"Sweet!\" Adam forgot something important. \"Love you, Dad,\" said Adam. \"I love you, too, son,\" replied his Dad. \"Dad? You can let go now,\" said Adam. \"Sorry. Go have an adventure,\" said his Dad. \"Good-bye!\" Adam told his friends, \"See ya later!\"\n\nA man named Patrick was frustrated. \"Barbara, I don't understand it. Here this thing has a lifetime guarantee, and it breaks! I had to clean the tank myself, take all the fish out and put them in bags. Where did the fish go?\"\n\nSome fish were trying to escape. \"Come on, Emma!\" \"Hurry!\" \"You can do it!\" \"Just a little further!\" said Emma's friends. \"That's the shortest green light I've ever seen!\" said Emma. \"Now what?\" asked another fish.\n\nThe fish sang a cheerful song:\n\"Somewhere beyond the sea,\nSomewhere, waiting for me,\nMy friend stands on golden sands,\nAnd watches the ships that go sailing.\nIf I could fly like birds on high,\nThen straight to their arms, I'll go sailing.\nIt's far beyond the stars,\nIt's near beyond the moon,\nI know beyond a doubt, \nMy heart will lead me there soon.\nWe'll meet beyond the shore,\nWe'll greet just like before,\nHappy we'll be beyond the sea,\nAnd never again, I'll go sailing.\"", "hash": "f1ddc2e88252daf48db7899d0c10c2267d36cc177ba1f6047f1961232ff4eaa1"}
{"text": "A long time ago, the business company was not very important. Today it is everywhere. Like the church, the king, and the group in other times and places, the company is today's big group. This movie looks at the nature, history, effects, and possible futures of the modern business company. At first, it was given a small legal job. What has allowed today's company to get such great power and effect over our lives? We begin our ask as problems may cause a big talk about the lack of public control over big companies. Some say that a huge part of the business world are honest. But there are some bad ones. The media talk about the basic rules of the company world was quickly made into a game. Some say the US is the best place in the world to invest. We have some shake ups because of a few bad ones. Some people call me a bad one, but I may be bruised, but I still taste sweet. Some say these are not just a bunch of bad ones. This is just a few bad ones. This is not just a few bad ones. You've got to get rid of the bad ones. Bad ones. Bad ones. Bad ones. Bad ones. Bad ones. Bad ones. The fruit cart is getting a little more full. Some say this is the worst crisis of trust in business. What's wrong with this picture? Can we not pick a better word to describe the big group of our time? Through the voices of leaders, whistle blowers, brokers, teachers, and spies, insiders and outsiders, we present the company as a paradox, a group which creates great wealth but causes big and often hidden harms. Some see the company as part of a puzzle in society as a whole which if you remove it, the picture's incomplete. But equally, if it's the only part, it's not going to work. A sports team. Some of us are blocking and tackling. Some of us are running the ball, some of us are throwing the ball. But we all have a common purpose which is to succeed as a group. A company is like a family unit. People in a company work together for a common end. Like the telephone system, it reaches almost everywhere. It can buy and sell things. It can borrow money. It can go to court. It can do business. Adam along with many others is a part of our daily life. It is a member of our group. Having gotten the rights and protections of a person, the question arises: What kind of person is it?\n\nThey were given the rights of forever persons. But then special kinds of persons, persons who had no moral feeling. These are a special kind of persons which are made by law to care only for their owners. And not what are sometimes called their workers like the group or the people or whatever.  \n\nThe big problems of having these people is that they aren't like the rest of us. As a wise person in FR country is supposed to have said, they have no spirit to save and they have no body to put in jail.\n\nI believe the mistake that a lot of people make when they think about them is they think they are like us. A big company is a kind old man with lots of stories. Another young and energetic. Another aggressive. Another young, outgoing, and excited. Another very neat. Another silly. Another very lovely.  \n\nThey don't have feelings, they don't have beliefs, they only have one thing: how to make as much money as they can at this time. That's it.\n\nOf course they make profit and it's a good thing. That's what makes the system work, to give us more of the things we want. That's missing in other systems.\n\nPeople say we only care about money because they think that's how business people think, it's just money. And it's not, because we know we need to care for the world but also want to be seen as good members of the group.\n\nThere are companies that do good for the groups. They make things that are useful for all of us that make our lives better and that's a good thing.\n\nThe problem is in the profit drive because these people, there's no such thing as enough. And I always say there's no group on this planet that can ignore its money needs. Even someone living simply still needs support from someone.\n\nEveryone needs to have money. It's not just a business issue. But unlike someone living simply, all public companies have been set up through legal decisions to put the money interests of their owners above other interests. This shirt costs a small amount of money. The women who made this shirt got paid very little money. These coats cost a lot of money, but the workers were paid very little money for each coat they made. Companies want to make as much money as they can. They try to pay workers as little as possible to make more money for themselves. Sometimes companies do not care about the people or the world around them. They only care about making money for themselves. Companies can do bad things to make more money. We should be kind to others and care about the world around us, not just care about making money. Some people went into a company without permission. They found some papers that showed a famous company paid very low wages to workers in a different country. The workers only made a tiny part of the money from selling the products. The people said the company did this to find desperate workers who would work for low pay. After a country's workers were paid better, the company moved to a poorer country to find more desperate workers.\n\nIn the past, scientists learned to make many new chemicals from oil. These chemicals were used to make things like clothes, brushes, tires, and cosmetics. The chemicals helped make life better, but some were also used for things like killing bugs and plants. Early one morning, a person wanted to make a strong pesticide that would last a long time. The scientist put two rings on the board and added green and red pieces to make the pesticide.\n\nDuring the big war, the army asked native doctors to use the strong pesticide to stop a bad illness from spreading. \"The dust will help stop disease,\" they said.\n\nAs time went on, we learned that some chemicals can be dangerous. They can cause cancer and hurt babies before they are born. Some companies knew about this but did not tell people.\n\nIf I shoot you with a gun, that is bad. If I give you chemicals that could kill you slowly, that is also bad. Many people now get cancer.\n\nOne day, a big box of papers came to a person's office. It had files showing that a company had lied about tests on cows given a drug to make more milk. The files showed the drug caused problems like swelling in the cows' hearts and other organs.\n\nOther scientists said the drug made the cows suffer, and it was silly since there was already too much milk. We really have some places that pay farmers to not make milk. The first thing a company made is something that makes more of what we do not need. Of course you will want to give this to every cow, as each cow that does not get it is lost money. But using this thing caused problems for the cows. It caused an infection called mastitis which hurts the cow's udders. When you milk the cow with bad mastitis, some of the sickness gets in the milk. The bacteria count in your milk goes up. It costs money for the cows. The cows get more sick when they are given this thing. They are given medicine. We know that people are eating medicine through their food, and we know that this causes sickness that cannot be cured by medicine. That is a problem. Bad for the cow, bad for the farmer, bad maybe for the person eating it. We see information saying it may not be safe, and as a person my thought is why should I take any risk? Farm cows have not been the only ones hurt by this company's things. Big areas of the VC country were destroyed by the US army using this company's poison. The poison reportedly caused many sick babies and many cancers in VC people and soldiers and in US soldiers there. Unlike VC people, US soldiers exposed to the poison were able to sue this company for making them sick. This company settled out of court, paying money, but did not admit fault. Staying in a motel in the BR city one night, I woke up with terrible hay fever and my eyes were burning. I looked at the river and there were big piles of white foam going right down the river. The next morning I said, \"What was that happening last night?\" They said, \"That's just the river.\" I said \"What do you mean?\" They said \"Look, every night the paper place sends the stuff down the river.\" I said \"What are you talking about?\" They said \"Don't you understand? That's how we get rid of the dirty stuff from the paper places.\" A worker said, \"I knew all the owners of the paper mills. I knew the people in the towns. I knew that no one wanted the river polluted. But the river was being polluted. It was like we made a doom machine. In our search for wealth, we made something that will destroy us.\"\n\nA trader said, \"The traders care about making money, not the environment. They see dollars, not pollution. Brokers do not stop because of beliefs or policies. There are times we think about it, but those thoughts go away quickly. A town is polluted, but this person needs to buy something. I get paid too.\"  \n\n\"Our information does not include anything about the environment. It does not matter to us until the environment itself can be traded. It is far away and we hardly hear about it. There are problems happening right here too. We trade live animals. There are many pigs polluting rivers, but we do not hear about that.\"\n\nA group reported on companies that broke laws. Adam paid fines for an oil spill. Benjamin paid fines for fraud. Cameron paid fines for pollution. David paid fines for unfair business practices. Ethan paid fines for illegal actions. Frank paid fines for pollution. And many others paid fines for different problems.\n\nThe report said, \"Whether companies obey laws depends on if it is cheaper to pay fines than to follow rules. If penalties are less than obeying, companies treat it as just business.\" \"Learning to fly is like a person going off a high cliff with wings flapping. The person thinks they are flying but is really falling.\" \"This is like our world. We seem to have many things, but we are not truly living the right way.\" \"Our world is not built properly and will crash, like the person falling.\" \"Some wise people have seen this coming and warned us.\" \"All living things on Earth are struggling. The land, air, and water that support life are declining.\" \"Businesses in the past took from the Earth in harmful ways, wasting and polluting. This leaves a bad world for future children.\" \"Some say this is unfair to future generations who had no say.\" \"It is wrong to treat the world this way.\" \"Can a business really care about others? A business is not a real person that can have feelings or morals.\" \"But the people in the business, like workers and owners, should care and be good.\" A said, \"Every person is a good person.\" \"We are alike, but people can act in all ways.\" \"Each of us could be kind or cruel.\" B said, \"My job was hard. As the boss, I did not have total power. If I did what I wished, I would act differently. But as boss, I could not.\" C said, \"Firing workers is common. People think bosses do not care about workers. But no boss makes that choice lightly. It is hard. But it is part of business.\" D said, \"Look at a business like at a cruel owner. The system is bad, but the people in it may be kind as people. They do cruel things in their roles because the system is cruel. The same here.\" E said, \"My spouse and I once had protesters at our home. They said we were bad. But we spoke with them. They saw the issue was not us, but our company. The company is made of people like me. We worried about the same things they did - nature, rights, harsh rulers. But I can try to help. They felt helpless.\" F said, \"So a kind boss may care about nature. But their role makes them do harmful acts.\" G said, \"The kind boss may serve tea to protesters. Yet the company still damages nature and mistreats activists.\" We can really begin to look at the changes in the late 20th century. Medieval life was collectively lived. It was a difficult time. But there was collective responsibility. People belonged to the land; the land did not belong to the people. And in this world, people farmed the land collectively because they saw it as shared. It belonged to God. And then it was managed by the church, the nobles, and the local manors as stewards of God's creation. Beginning with the EN country, we began to see land that was shared become private property by laws. And so first we began to take the great lands of the world which were shared and we made those private property. Then we went after the oceans, the great shared waters, and we created laws that would allow countries to claim areas outside their coasts for use. In this century, we divided the air into routes that could be bought and sold for airplanes. And then the rest is history. With deregulation and free trade, what we're seeing is more private ownership of shared things. One thing interesting in our debates is who creates wealth. That wealth is only created when it's owned privately. What would you call clean water, fresh air, a safe environment? Are they not a form of wealth? And why does it only become wealth when some group puts a fence around it and declares it private property? Well, that's not creating wealth. That's taking wealth that was shared. Over the centuries, we have put more and more things as shared, and lately started making them private again. So firefighters, for instance. Firefighters started as private companies, and if you didn't have an agreement with them, they would not help if your house was on fire. Well, it gradually became a public service for the safety of all. This is important. We should not go back and make that private again. Maybe it will be more efficient, but privatization does not mean giving a public service to a good person. It means giving a public service to an unaccountable group. Public services have many benefits. For one thing, they may purposely operate at a loss. \"They do not seek money only.\" \"They may choose to lose money because of other good things.\" \"So for example if a public metal industry loses money it gives cheap metal to other industries. Maybe that is a good thing.\" \"Public places can help in hard times.\" \"So that means that they can keep people working when times are hard. This gives people money to spend, which helps make times better.\" \"Private companies can't do that in hard times. They must fire workers to make money.\" \"Some people want everything owned by someone.\" \"We're not just talking about things you buy.\" \"We're talking about human rights, human help, things we need to live.\" \"Education, public health, help for people, money after you stop working, places to live.\" \"We're also talking about keeping the earth alive.\" \"The things that must stay for everyone, or we will all die.\" \"Air and water.\" \"Even with air, there has been some change. We now trade \npermission to make air dirty.\" \"The idea is to say, 'Look, we can't stop putting bad gases in the air right now. So we'll say how much bad gas we can put in the air.'\" \"And we'll give permission for that amount to the people putting bad gases in the air. And now they can trade those permissions.\" \"And so now there's a cost for making the air dirty.\" \"Wouldn't it be great if we had costs for everything?\" \"It sounds like you want someone to own every part of the earth.\" \"Yes. Every bit of air and water.\" \"It sounds crazy to say we want everything on earth owned.\" \"But it doesn't mean one person owns this one bit. It means the people who care about that thing own it.\" \"And that is not a crazy idea. It's the way to fix a lot of these problems.\" \"Imagine if a company owned the song 'Happy Birthday'.\" \"In fact, a company does own it. In the past, they charged over a lot of money to let anyone sing it in a movie.\" \"We chose to use that money to bring you this story instead.\" \"Yes\", Samuel said. \"Working with you and the PF company and our other groups will make this place better.\" \n\"Okay,\" Emma replied.\n\"Okay, nice to see you Miss Jessica. Bye,\" Samuel said.\n\"There used to be a lot of bad things at this train station,\" Samuel explained. \"One night I was going home, and I almost got robbed.\"\n\"So we decided to make a change to make this area better,\" Emma said. \"We're looking at new gates that stop people from not paying.\"\n\"It used to be that you could just jump over,\" Samuel said. \"So the PF company worked with the train group and bought these new machines.\"\n\"This box lets us talk to the PF guard about 500 yards away,\" Emma explained. \"I haven't seen the PF guard today, but I'm going to try calling.\"\n\"Hello?\" a voice answered. \"Hello. Tom speaking.\"\n\"He'll probably call back later,\" Samuel said. \"This lets people call the PF desk for help after hours. Then the PF guard calls the police if there's trouble.\"\n\"Because of all this, there's less bad things at this station now. It's safer for our area,\" Emma said happily.\nSamuel pressed the other button, but no one answered.\n\"I'll go talk to him in person,\" he said. \"It's hard, you know? They're using money to help, but who decides what to do with that money? While they do nice things, they also lower taxes for companies and rich people and change the rules. We don't see all the changes happening behind the scenes, but we see the nice front.\" \"Currently there are about 500 families who call Celebration home,\" said Adam. \"And there are about 130 small houses and a town center where people meet.\"\n\n\"It has four or five places to eat and about a dozen other shops,\" Adam continued. \"Their inspiration is the typical AM country family. And the kind of old AM country town.\"\n\n\"Their main idea is family fun and everything the company does is about those two words,\" explained Adam. \"If you go to a branded place like a theme park, it is a natural extension of that idea. Family movies are also a logical extension.\"  \n\n\"As a business, though, they know that if they want other kinds of entertainment that does not fit family fun, they do not use their main brand. If they want more serious movies for adults, they use a different name.\"\n\n\"Their main brand means safety. It means tradition. It means quality. And you can see that here in this community we built,\" said Adam.\n\n\"And that's where you see brands wanting to build their own little worlds. Which maybe you start by shopping in and then you continue by vacationing in, but eventually why not just live in.\"\n\n\"What if we wake up one day and we find out that virtually all of our relationships with our fellow human beings are commercial?\" Adam asked. \"We find out that virtually every relationship we have is a business deal with our fellow human being? Can society survive on that narrow definition of how we interact with each other?\" \"What is that?\" \"You take it out you drink it down. It's there. You don't really think about it.\" \"Wow!\" \"That's pretty good water.\" \"Who knows?\" \"Maybe someone put the water there.\" \"You go out for your lunch break. You are sitting in the park and people are out there talking in the park. Then you hear another message.\" \"By the time you go to bed, you have probably received eight or nine different messages.\" \"People always think, 'Oh, I know what product placement is.'\" \"That's when they put things in shows!\" \"Well, yes, that's definitely traditional product placement.\" \"But real life product placement is just that: Putting things in shows, but the show is actually your life.\" \"Well, take a group of people who are like you. They are doing something for us, whether they are having a certain kind of drink or they are using a certain cleaning product.\" \"Whatever it may be, they are like a trap.\" \"People will come over to them and they will give them a little piece of information.\" \"It could be a fact or a ritual.\" \"People will get that piece of information, then they would take it.\" \"'Oh, pretty cool!' Then they go out and tell their friends.\" \"If you want to be critical, if you want to look at every single person that comes up to you, sure, be critical.\" \"But if they are showing you something that fits and something that works and something that makes your life better in some way, well then, who cares.\" \"We just say thanks!\" \"Today, the job of building this country is completed. There are no new places within our borders. So to what new places can we look now? Where are tomorrow's opportunities? What's ahead for you and your children? The places of the future are not on any map. They're in the test tubes and workplaces of the great industries. A case is one of the great moments in history. And the public was totally unaware it was actually happening. A company and a professor went to the office with a little thing that eats up spills. They said they had made this thing in the workplace, and therefore it was an invention. The office and the Government took a look at this 'invention'; they said no way. The rules don't cover living things. This is not an invention. \"No.\" \"Then Adam and David asked a court for help.\" \"To everyone's surprise, the court said this tiny creature looks more like a cleaning product than an animal or insect.\" \"I laugh because they did not understand basic science; it looked like a chemical to them.\" \"If it had antennae, eyes, wings, or legs, it would never have been allowed.\" \"Then the office asked again.\" \"What the public should know is the office was clear that you cannot own life.\" \"My group argued that if you allow ownership of this tiny creature, it means that without any guidance, companies will own the blueprints of life.\" \"When they made the decision, we lost, and Henry said sure some of these are big issues but we think this is a small decision.\" \"Seven years later the office issued a rule: you can own anything alive except a full human being.\" \"We've all heard that we have mapped the human body's plan.\" \"But what the public doesn't know is now there's a race by companies to find the treasure in the map.\" \"The treasure is the individual parts that make up the plan of the human race.\" \"Every time they capture a part, these companies claim it as their property.\" \"The breast part, the cystic part, it goes on and on.\" \"If this goes unchallenged, in less than 10 years a few global companies will own the actual parts that make up the evolution of our species.\" \"And they're now beginning to own the plans of every other creature.\" \"In the age of biology, the debate will be between those who believe life first has value and therefore we should choose technologies that honour that value...\" \"And those who believe look, life is a simple product.\" \"They will want the marketplace to decide in the age of biology.\" \"In a world economy where information is filtered by global media corporations focused on their powerful advertisers, who will defend the public's right to know?\" \"And what price must be paid to preserve our ability to make informed choices?\" \"A TV company told us we were just the people to be the investigators.\" \"Do any stories you want, ask tough questions and get answers.\" \"So we thought this is great, this is a dream job.\" The very first thing they had us do was not to study stories but to make a video. It had smoke and shadows of people. \n\nOne of the first stories Jane found was that most milk in the FR country had something put in by a big company to make cows give more milk. The company had to get many people to agree it was safe - professors, experts, reporters, the public, and government workers.\n\nThey said it was the most tested thing ever and would help farmers make more money. But the government approved it after only testing it on 30 rats for 90 days. The company may have hidden the real results from the government.\n\nScientists in a CA country looked at it carefully and said it was not safe and could be absorbed by the body. But that conclusion was removed from their report.\n\nA worker said there was too much secrecy and the government was pressured to approve unsafe drugs like this one. The news team had the story ready, but then a lawyer for the big company sent a letter saying false things about it. So the news team did not air the story, even though there were no factual errors. Early one morning, Alice and Emma went to work. The boss Frank said, \"We got a letter from a big company. They said bad things will happen if we share a story on TV.\" Frank was afraid of being sued and losing money from ads. He called Alice and Emma to his office and asked, \"What if we don't show the story?\" Alice and Emma said they wouldn't like that. Frank said, \"I could stop the story, but don't tell anyone.\" Alice said she wouldn't lie for him. Later, Frank called them again and said, \"You must change the story the way our lawyers want.\" Alice showed research that the story was true. But Frank didn't care. He said, \"We paid a lot for these TV stations. We decide what the news is. If you don't change the story, you'll be fired.\" Alice said she would report him for making her lie on TV. Frank said, \"You'll hear from us soon.\" Emma said, \"After a day passed, we did not hear anything.\" \"A week later, Gabriel called us back, and we changed our plan.\" \"How about if we give you some money, and you go away?\" Gabriel asked. Emma replied, \"How much money? When someone offers a bribe like that, I always want to know if it might be worth it.\"\n\nGabriel was going to offer them the rest of their yearly pay if they agreed not to talk about what the big company had done, not talk about the company's response in suppressing the story, and not talk about the story or this topic again anywhere. Emma said, \"You mean if I want to go to my child's school meetings and explain what's in the school milk, I can't?\" Gabriel replied, \"No, you can never speak about this anywhere.\"\n\nGabriel wrote it up and sent it to them a couple of days later. He asked if they were going to sign it. They said no, they were not going to sign that or send it back. It was okay; they couldn't buy them out or shut them up, so they would get the story on the news in a way that everyone could agree.\n\nThey started rewriting and editing with the lawyers. During this eight-month review process, they did things like take out the word \"illness.\" You don't have to identify the potential problem; just say \"human health implications.\" Any criticism of the big company or its product was either removed or minimized. It was very clear that almost every edit they made to the piece aimed to change or remove those parts.\n\nThey changed this and this and this. And then that wasn't good enough, so they changed this and this again. Version after version after version, 83 times, which is unheard of. It doesn't happen; you shouldn't have to rewrite something 83 times. Obviously, they didn't want to put the thing on the news, and they were trying to make them quit or wait until the first window in their contract so that they could fire them. Emma said, \"You are letting David and me go because we refused to share something on TV that we knew was not true. That's what this is about. We stood up to your editors and lawyers and said there should be a more important rule than just making money.\" Emma wrote a letter back and said, \"You are right, that's exactly why we're letting you go. You stood up to us on this story, and that's why we're letting you go.\" David said, \"Big mistake. That's unfair treatment. You can't treat employees unfairly if they are standing up for something they believe is wrong and don't want to be a part of.\" So David and Emma were able to file a complaint against their employer because of this. A few years later, there was a trial. After many days of testimony, the jury decided that the story the employer wanted David and Emma to share was false or misleading. The jury awarded David and Emma money. The employer appealed, and some TV stations supported the appeal. The appeals court said David and Emma could not file a complaint about misleading news stories. The employer said they were proven right by this ruling. However, David and Emma filed a complaint under a law protecting people who try to stop others from breaking the law. The appeals judges said misleading news is not actually against the law, so they did not give David and Emma the award. In some countries, a certain food product is banned, but it is still used in food in this country. Many people may not have access to clean drinking water in the future, which has caused arguments over water. The more people did not want the water plan, the more problems happened. Big companies have not always been good. Did they want to be like groups that were not good? There was a connection between companies and groups that were not good in Europe. The groups that were not good got help from big companies. The big companies liked the groups that were not good because they could make more money. The companies kept making money, even when many people died. \n\nOne group that was not good wanted to get rid of a group of people. But there were no computers back then to help. Instead, they used a system with cards that had holes in them to store information about people. The system helped keep track of people and where they went. Different numbers on the cards meant different groups of people, like a certain religion or other characteristics. I remember thinking, \"I am in the important place for intelligence right now.\" For me, it showed how industry and government were talking with each other and working together.\n\nAs 34 countries gathered to make a big trade agreement that would make every resource and service private, many people from groups joined to say no to it. The top business people and the chief trade person did not care about the people in the streets. For them, the 800 million people spoke with one voice.\n\n\"I'm inside and this is all outside. That's the way it is,\" they said.\n\n\"It's too bad this has happened,\" the business person said. \"Does there need to be some way to be responsible?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" they said. \"And the business community knows that. But being responsible is in the marketplace, with their owners. It's with the way the public sees them. If companies don't do what they should, they will be punished in the marketplace, and no company wants that.\"\n\n\"There's a new market. These people aren't out there because the government is making them or because they read a book about being good in the world,\" someone said. \"My inner voice says to listen to my inner child.\"\n\n\"Mine says to love everyone,\" said another.\n\n\"My inner voice says I want a mushroom burger,\" said a third.\n\n\"They're there because they understand the market needs them to be there. That's their advantage, to be there.\"\n\n\"I'm listening to your concerns. I worry about climate and pollution. I don't have all the answers, but we are ready to work with you, with society, with groups, with governments, to solve it,\" the business person said. \"So you build trust, and the goal is to become the chosen company.\"\n\nOne person believes that almost half our energy can come from renewable sources one day. They have been called a dreamer and silly, and more recently a project manager for an energy company.\n\n\"I often ask myself why so many companies say they are socially responsible. I'm not sure it's because they really want to be responsible, but because they want to be seen as responsible,\" they said.\n\n\"But who am I to judge? It's better that they belong than not belong. It's better that they say they are responsible than the opposite.\" \"Today we will talk about a big shop and a famous woman who made toys for children. This shop had people work very hard for little money. The famous woman knew about this, but did not stop it. People on TV talked about this for a long time. After that, many people learned about children working hard for little money, and about places where people work too much for too little pay.\n\nWe wanted to look at the laws that allowed this to happen. These laws are not permanent. They can be changed. In fact, most places have laws that say these laws must be changed.\n\nFor too long now, big companies have been allowed to ignore the rules that should protect people. But today, a group of people are fighting back. They are asking the leader of their place to follow the law and stop a big oil company from doing bad things. \n\nThis big oil company has done many bad things. It has hurt people in other places, like women, workers, and native people. It has tried to trick the courts, the public, and its own workers.\n\nThis big oil company cannot do business in a place called Burma without supporting the bad leaders there. This is wrong.\n\nMaking films about these bad things can sometimes help change things for the better. So I will keep making these films.\n\nAt Christmas time, I try to be nicer to big companies, like cigarette companies. \n\nIn one place called Littleton, many parents work for a big company that makes weapons. This is the main job for parents in that place.\" Long ago, two people talked about cars and the world. Adam said, \"We don't see how our jobs link to what kids learn at school.\" Benjamin said, \"I told my wife, we are children of workers in FL city. None of us ever thought that building cars may melt ice and end our world. We don't connect that building cars, though good, can also hurt our world. We must take responsibility for the harm we cause.\"\n\nAnother day, a meeting happened in AR city. People there voted to discuss if big companies make true democracy hard. They also voted to form a group to control companies in AR city. Grace said, \"Companies don't answer to democracy. I don't want to decide everything for their company. But I believe they must answer to us. If we don't like a product, don't use it - that's people power. But if they have more money, that's not fair democracy.\" Henry said, \"Why fear this? Companies won't all leave. And if they did, we'd find a new way. I don't fear my government, as I can be part of it. But I can't be part of what companies do.\" \"People say I am important,\" said Adam. \"I work hard at my job. Some call me a hero. But the first time we tried to make many things, it was a mistake. It is not good for the earth. We must try again and do it better this time.\"\n\n\"I dream of people working together to help, not hurt, the earth. I dream of a company that uses things over and over, with energy from the sun and wind. We must try very hard to make no mess on the earth.\"\n\n\"To do this hard work well, we must learn new things that we don't know yet. People all over the world are learning these new things. It is exciting!\"\n\n\"After we showed that one big company was wrong, I saw how big and powerful they were, with many stores and workers. But we can still change even big, powerful companies. We can change the government too. That is the only way to make rules that are good for people and the earth.\" \n\n\"Some big companies would like to control everything. But many people are saying, 'We don't need you. We can do it better ourselves.' We will make systems that help the earth and people. These are not small tests. Many communities around the world are doing this already. That is our future.\"\n\n\"It seems strange that I can do all this work, but I am on TV networks owned by big companies. They let me share my ideas that go against what they believe, because many people want to watch me. But these companies don't really believe in anything. They just want to make money.\" Adam was driving a truck. He said, \"I am able to share my ideas because of a problem with greed in the system. The rich person will sell things to make money, even if it hurts them in the end. I hope I am part of that.\" Adam said people will watch his work, but they think people will not do anything after watching because their minds have been numbed. He said, \"People will not leave and do something political after watching.\" But Adam was sure some people would leave and do something to make the world better after watching his work.", "hash": "5cb690c15b2bc069485d9ce9b5f24cd561a63f7df22834788b7258527c3b7855"}
{"text": "The summer my father was sad, the face of Jesus Christ appeared on a tortilla at the TJ Cafe. It hung by the door, and people came to see it. Maria saw the face and fainted away. She wanted to keep it forever. But time passed and the face was gone, though some sadness lingered. From the start, my father said it looked like the devil, but then Pinky Lee. My mother never even looked. \"Take your time, dear.\" Bo's idea of heaven was a walk through the store. \"They listed money troubles: No jobs, low work, high costs, less money, and no growth.\" My father's sadness was everywhere, like smoke in our lungs. It was the main part of our lives that summer. Hey, there's a hummingbird nest with three eggs. George, my father's friend, was upset by the sadness. \"Sit, George.\" \"I'll go.\" \"You said that already.\" \"What are you tying?\" \"The same yellow thing, George. Ask again and I'll be mad.\" \"Bye, Charlie.\" \"Bo. There you are.\" \"Hey, look what I found.\" \"Isn't it nice?\" \"What were you two doing, planning crimes?\" \"George was here.\" \"Oh, how's George?\" \"The same.\" \"That's George, always himself.\" \"I think George is a little light.\" \"What's that mean?\" \"It means he's strange.\" \"Were you outside today? You got a package and boat brochure. Taking a trip?\" \"A catalog and letter from MasterCharge.\" \"At last.\" \"What is it?\" \"It's a card application.\" \"What will you do with your MasterCharge card?\" Buy a real house. And the dog ran to their friend. \"Friend.\" \"Friend.\" \"Friend.\" \"Friend.\" \"And the dog liked...\" \"And licked their hand.\" \"And...\" \"You can tell me.\" \"No.\" \"Did you hurt somebody?\" \"The person...\" \"Did you, Adam, hurt somebody?\" \"Tell me.\" \"It'll feel good to say it.\" \"Would you like a treat?\" It's free. You took it? I wrote them a note. They sent me a box. They don't want you to take legal action. You have to write it right. Pretty good. Adam, have you ever been sad? Sad right now. Oh no, I'm in trouble. Don't feel bad. My parent is sad too, and they don't know why. It's actually not nice. How's work, Benjamin? It's good. How's that person who got hurt behind the TB city? Good old Cameron. They're working. They're climbing the poles without an arm? Well, they sit in a truck, just like before. You could do that, Parent. You could sit in the truck. David, pass the potatoes. Maybe you should get a job, Parent. You might like it. What? I'm sorry. Sometimes you need medicine to feel better. I could try to get them some medicine. From the VA hospital down in AQ city. Think it's worth me driving there, Benjamin? Most likely they'd want a note from a doctor. And Cameron would never talk to a doctor. I'm gonna need some medicine myself soon. Here. I got them some paints. That's a good idea. Did you give them to them? No. Want me to? Tell them they're from you. Yeah. Don't tell them they're from me. Would you take David fishing this week? They're mad at the world. Do you have any paper for them to paint on? We've got wallpaper from the dump they can use on the back of. Benjamin, would you mind going to a doctor? To get a note for some medicine. What a look. What all you've done for that person. Carried them almost dead off a mountain, pulled them from under a vehicle in the FR country. \"I will get you some.\" \"You want some bread too?\" \"No, thank you.\" \"Matthew, stew?\" \"Henry?\" \"No, thanks.\" \" Thank you.\" \" You are welcome.\" \"\"So quiet, too, was the sea, and so steady the breeze that if these sails had been sculpted stone they could not have been more still.\" \"Not a ripple upon the surface of the canvas not even a shaking of the edges of the sail so perfectly were they stretched by the breeze.\" \"I was so lost in the sight that I forgot the person who came out with me until he said, half to himself:\" \"'How quietly they do their work.\"'\" \"Matthew?\" \"Matthew, where are you?\" \"Matthew, answer me.\" \"Matthew?\" \"Matthew.\" \"Matthew!\" \"Please, Matthew, just do me this one favor, please.\" \"If you go somewhere, just let me know when you leave, okay?\" \"Where are you going?\" \"Bed.\" \"Come on.\" \"Up, up, pet.\" \"And next, the very lovely animal. Thattaboy, animal. And now, animal, the animal from FR country. Come on, come on, jump up. Try again, come on. And now, animal himself. He will just get moving. Come on, pet, get moving. Show some life. What is the story? Is animal too sad? Too sad, just sitting there with your tongue hanging out. But here comes animal and animal and animal and animal. A lot of talent. But not animal. He just sits there, droopy and poopy not prancing and dancing like pet. Folks I give you the famous traveler the star player of all time. Yes, up, up, up! And the crowd goes wild. Hallelujah. Saved. My mother was weeding without clothes in the garden when she heard Benjamin cry out. Her response was to grab a tool and look down quick for animals. I am sorry, I am... Only when he kept his back to her and outlined his errand to the animal house did it dawn on her to reach for Matthew's coat off the scarecrow and cover herself. I am a tax helper with the IR department. Shameless. \" Are you Mrs. Groden?\" \" Yes. I would have called to let you know I was coming but your phone is unlisted. \"I'm very sad.\" \"That's why I drink a lot of water.\" \"I won't have any fluid left in me.\" \"Have you ever been sad?\" \"I've always been sad.\" \"Always been sad?\" \"Always.\" \"You've always been sad.\" \"Yes, friend.\" \"The first time for me.\" \"I don't know how you can take it.\" \"Well, I guess I'm used to it.\" \"I don't even know how I got here.\" \"Do you know what started it?\" \"Oh, I guess it started when I was a child.\" I came home from school, and my mother had hurt herself.\" \"No.\" \"Yes.\" \"You found her like that?\" In the front room. It was strange, because I was carrying something I made in school... And I opened the door and saw her.\" I may have been sad before that.\" \"You make me feel better.\" \"No.\" \"Yeah.\" \"\"Good reason like that.\" \"Oh, I think I have a fever. I am cold. I'm freezing. This is a bad thing to say but sometimes I think being gone would be easier. You will be gone very soon. Your life will be over quickly. Is that... Mr. Gibbs?\" \"Who?\" \"It's Charlotte.\" Good morning. Would you mind if I tried your bag? Tried it out? Yeah, okay. What are you doing? \"My name isn't Bo. It's Charlotte. I'm rolling my coins. A big colorful air thing just went over the hill. Today is the air fest. You just missed it, Dad.\" No, we don't think it's anything serious. He might not be back at work for a couple of days. Just wanted to let you know. Sure. By the way, he's a good and polite worker. I highly recommend him. Very polite. Okay, I'll check in with you later. Bye. Can I help you? This is something an important person would like, don't you think? I think so. \"What's that?\" \"A book for plans.\" A book for plans. Perfect. I'll take it. He makes lots of plans. You know what's really strange? A parent said, \"The first picture of my mother was easy to see.\" \"They first drew it with a pencil. Then, like someone hiding a body, they covered it in blue paint.\" \"Xavier spent three and a half weeks painting a picture of the horizon, which was 41 feet long.\" \"Around the 11th foot, I realized that someone I thought was connected to the outside world was actually stuck in my own problems.\"\n\n\"Okay, I understand.\" \"You'll have to check these numbers, but I think with the penalties and interest, we owe $1260.\" \"I'm sorry.\" \"Don't be sorry, it's not your fault.\" \"You have flour on your face.\" \"I was baking bread.\" \"Now you have paint on your face.\" \"What are you painting?\" \"He's painting a curve for me.\" \"What curve?\" \"The curve where the ocean meets the sky.\" \"Is that...?\" \"Don't you have any more blue paint? I'm running out.\"\n\n\"Well, we'll go to the city. And you can call your office. I'm sure they're expecting you.\" \"No, I'm not going back there.\" \"No?\" \"I didn't come all the way out to the NM state to work for the tax office.\"\n\n\"Well, what did you come here for?\"\n\nDear Advice Column:\nI am a 12-year-old girl. Healthy and outgoing, so far so good. My problem is this: My father is very sad. Not just a little sad, but really, really sad. He's been this way for a long time. My mother is afraid he might hurt himself. I know he won't, because he loves us too much. But it is really starting to bother me. He used to take me with him everywhere. He taught me how to do many things. We haven't done those fun things together in a long time, and I'm afraid I might become sad too. Is it contagious? Will he ever remember the good times?\n\nYours, A Young Girl in the NM State\n\n\"Xavier! Xavier! Xavier! Are you okay?\" the parent asked. \"Was that the first bear you've ever seen? You got a really close look at it, huh?\" \"What?\" \"Play with me.\" \"Come on, we'll go out in the yard.\" \"I don't want to play with you.\" \"Please.\" \"No.\" \"Why not?\" \"Because.\" \"Because why?\" \"I'm dressed up.\" \"Oh, that's why?\" \"I'm seeing someone.\" \"What?\" \"I'm seeing someone.\" \"Thank you, Adam.\" \"Thank you so much.\" \"Don't let me go, Adam.\" \"Oh, God.\" \"Don't let me go.\" \"Oh, no.\" \"No.\" Matthew. Your painting is done. It's great. William's long painting of the planet's curve was almost as big as my room. He hung it so that when I lay on my back I could look out to the horizon all around. Circled by water, I would turn and float on my back with arms outstretched, chin up and feel the rounded curve of the planet supporting me. Like faith. By loving each other and being good, may you see your grandchildren. And after a long life may you go to heaven. Amen. We lost Adam that summer. He and Penelope settled in the MX country where Adam was told he'd been chosen mayor without knowing it. I give you a companion, not a servant. Love her as Christ loves the Church. I missed him. In the custom, you can kiss the bride. No! Matthew. He can't move! Sweetheart... No, he can't move! I don't want him to move! He'll come visit us. He should be here now! He's late! Sweetheart, he's on his honeymoon. But it's Daddy's birthday, he's never missed Daddy's birthday. Matthew, I'm surprised, you've never shown this much care for him. You're always teasing Adam. He's my godfather! Yes, he's your godfather. And he will always be your godfather. Not if he moves to the MX country. I want Adam. Well, I think he would be very touched to see you so upset. He won't even take me fishing anymore. Other people will take you fishing. Nobody fishes like Adam! Adam will take you fishing again, with his new wife. She can't even speak our language! \"You don't know how Adam died?\" \"No.\" \"No one in my family would talk about it.\" \"My father, my aunts...\" \"But it wasn't my fault.\" \"Hey, you were just a kid.\" \"Yeah, exactly.\" \"I was just a kid, a little kid. I could barely...\" It's all right, William.\n\nThrough my window, the cool night air carried the sound of my father dropping the box of tissues as he passed them over to William. Passing as it were between people on a team, a baton. There was a valve opened in William releasing a lot of tears. It seemed that same valve continued turning in my father all the way to the off position shutting off that steady leak that had streaked his face and our lives for a long time.\n\nNice chart. Each animal gets its own column. This shows how many things they get. I think you need another animal in this experiment. Why? You've got six animals and only two animals. I think we ought to have some more behavior groups. All we have is \"sleepy\" and \"aggressive.\" How else is an animal supposed to act? There's other groups. Like what? Happy, disoriented. All animals are disoriented. Besides, we're almost out of things.\n\nWell, maybe we ought to get some more. This is interesting. I don't think we should be feeding those things to the animals. It's unkind. You fed them to me.\n\nMatthew, would you take this sandwich out to William? I covered the plants, there's gonna be a cold night tonight. Summer's over.\n\nWhat did you do to your hair? My hair? Nothing. Looks different. No, it doesn't. I asked Adam to do a painting of you in the garden. You don't mind? I'm gonna make Adam some paints. In a famous book, it says to make blue color you mix flowers with flowers. And amber is the sap of a tree.\n\nYou only have one shoe on. Yeah, I took the other one off.\n\nDavid, how are we gonna deal with this? We owe the group money, we owe another group money. What are we gonna do? Come over here. Would you come over here. Please. What? Put your foot up here. \"Cameron...\" \"Put it here.\" \"Dear David, I miss you.\" \"There is no you today.\" \"Mom is in town at a game because Emma got very pregnant so Mom is a player in the important games.\" \"Tell Jessica thanks again for the shirt.\" \"It's a bit small, so we're going to sew it into the big sail.\" \"Do you know what a big sail is?\" \"It's a really big cloth that looks like a balloon at the front of a boat.\" \"I'm going to school in a few days.\" \"I'll write tomorrow and don't be surprised if a person pulls up with one of your many gifts from me.\" \"Your faithful child forever, Emma.\" \"William's end was as mysterious as his mother's. Some tourists in a car found him outside lying on his back, arms outstretched a book by his side. Eight years almost to the day after he appeared at our home tired and sore. Officials wanted to check his body, but my mother did not want that. She and my father buried him below the garden. His big art show was in the SF city across from the Hungry Gallery where his first show got great reviews. My very long painting of the water's edge sold in that first show for a lot of money. When we sold it the summer my father was no longer so sad it got some money, enough to pay off the government card and get me new braces. I have been thinking about that painting. It has struck me to view the water as the past, the sky as the future, and the present as that thin, changing line where both meet. Changing because as we stand there, it curves under our feet ever-changing. \"Every time all hands were sent to the rope, a song was called for and we pulled with effort. Sail after sail was added as we drew into good weather, and in one week after leaving the CA point the long, tall masts were got up and the ship restored to her nice shape. The Southern stars and clouds settled lower and lower in the horizon. And so great was our change in direction that each succeeding night we sank some stars in the south and raised another in the northern horizon.\"", "hash": "f83eb2fde2fe87982d63f53c547e4d4ab67580f397a58a05a7f57d2965bcf44e"}

And then she shot him in the heart. Only he didn't die. I don't know what happened after that. Would you like some? No. Maybe Marcus caught up with them, or the cartels. But like I said, the man is a myth, a legend. And if he's still living, he's the one you want. Well that is truly unbelievable. Well, I'm not good at telling stories. Where's the money? That's the reason I'm here. I couldn't find a bag small enough for $10,000 in cash. It'll do. Adam asked, \"Do you want me to do a job for you?\" Emma replied, \"Yes, I need you to get rid of someone for me.\" A man said, \"A musician gets little pay!\" Another man asked, \"Where have you been?\" The first man said, \"Far away.\" The second man asked, \"Still having fun?\" \n\nThe first man said, \"Let me get Frank.\" The second man said, \"I am here for my instrument.\" The first man said, \"It is Frank's last night. They are letting him go.\" \n\nHe called Frank and said, \"It's me. Still drinking. Like always.\" Frank said, \"I did not think you would come back for this thing.\" The first man said, \"Neither did I.\"\n\nAnother man said, \"Bring him when he is not drunk. We need him, so give him coffee. Lots of coffee. Sometimes a big change is needed to fix the system. That happens to be my area of skill.\"\n\nHe talked about a contest where an animal is hurt before the main event. He said, \"Is that a true victory? Of course it is. Want to know the secret to winning? Make sure the game is rigged in your favor.\"\n\nHe said a leader will give a speech in a town plaza on a holiday. He said it will be easy to reach the leader there if someone can get access. \n\nThe other man said he serves the leader but has betrayed leaders before. The first man said, \"You are a good helper. I like you.\"\n\nThe second man got annoyed and asked for information he needed. He threatened the first man for withholding important facts. The first man said he has what is needed. \"I am good.\" \"Go away.\" \"I am good.\" \"Go away.\" \"You are free now.\" \"Leave me alone.\" \"That spill just cost your life.\" \"A little help.\" \"Okay.\" \"I know it is on you somewhere.\" \"Somewhere.\" \"All right.\" \"Time to get messy.\" \"Well, I should thank you for not putting it up your bottom.\" \"However.\" \"You are a bit low.\" \"You will pay for that, police officer.\" \"Why does my key not work anymore?\" \"It is too small.\" \"Stand back.\" \"I just - I brought you a gift.\" \"I am still mad at you.\" \"And trust me, it was not easy to get.\" \"So....\" \"Come closer and I will thank you.\" \"Are you trying to make me excited?\" \"Closer, I said.\" \"How about that little tip?\" \"It guarantees you a big arrest and an award.\" \"Even from your strange agency.\" \"I am impressed. But then what? Want to hear my plan? Either that or I start target practice.\" \"Okay. The new leader wants to remove the bad group. And the bad group has hired a military man named Marquez. He wants him to take power while the leader is visiting CU city. Now, I have a person inside to make sure that Marquez never takes power. The last piece is the bad group leader. Your tip ensures that the bad group leader is out while the battle happens. After this good change, I will calmly walk away with the money that the bad group leader is prepared to pay Marquez for the power change. You want to go with me? You detain the bad group leader with the information that you have, then you join me and share the rewards. You meet me two nights from now at LP place, 10 PM sharp and bring only what is important to you. Oh, yes. It might get a bit dangerous there, dear. So.... Can you do it?\" \"I can do it.\" \"I want my key back.\" \"Testing. One, two. Testing. Hello? Can you hear me now? Okay - Loud sounds. Did you assemble your team? You know I did. Why are you having me followed? Oh, yes, that. Let us just call that a guarantee of obedience, shall we? \"Because Felix also...\" \"...provides protection.\" \"From what?\" \"Insects?\" \"Oh, gosh, I really wouldn't mess with him if I were you because he's a bit of a live wire.\" \"And he's not the happiest that you hurt his friend.\" \"Oh, yeah, by the way, I have your next task.\" \"You the Musicians?\" \"This is the back entrance.\" \"Make a note of it.\" \"Hey, hey, hey, hey.\" \"\"Who are they?\" \"Musicians.\" \"Why so heavy?\" \"Built in speaker.\" \"Play something.\" \"All right.\" \"Let's go.\" \"I was afraid you couldn't play.\" \"Are you kidding? What we are looking for is support from the people of this WY country.\" \"A man can do a lot alone, but he can do better with his people backing him. I wonder how much we're getting paid for this work.\" \"A man who wants nothing is strong, friend.\" Hey. Are you gonna tell him that this is his last meal? Is there a particular song you would like to hear? We just played for the leader, I can't buy half a drink with this work! It was meant as an honor. Forget honor. We need money. The task is tomorrow. Enough for all. Even for you, Liam. Why are you suddenly interested in the task? What's in it for you? Only revenge. Much delayed revenge. Go practice. Practice? Playing or shooting? What do you think? I don't think. I drink. Yeah, hello. Been following Adam... ...and the good Dr. Frank. Oh, Officer Olivia, no longer retired. Good person. Welcome to the group. I haven't seen illegal activities yet. Only that Dr. Frank is scheduled for a medical task on the late 20th century. That's tomorrow. Also identified a member of the group as Benjamin. A fugitive. We've been wanting to pick him up for some time now. Benjamin? Yeah. Bet my badge on it. Well whatever they're up to, I can guarantee you that it's going to happen tomorrow. So I suggest you - What's going down tomorrow? If you see an opening, take it. What do you know? Not enough. Get inside. Adam wanted to hurt the people in Benjamin's town. He asked Benjamin, \"Would you hurt them if I hurt your town?\" \n\nBenjamin said, \"I guess I have no choice but to hurt you if you hurt my town.\"\n\nAdam said, \"You are last.\" He put something on Benjamin to make him sleep and have bad dreams.\n\nCameron told David, \"Music comes from the soul. If the soul is good, the music is good. If the soul is not good, you must practice a lot.\"\n\nEthan brought Frank to Gabriel. Gabriel said, \"Get this mean person out of here.\" Frank asked, \"Do you want me to break his fingers?\" Gabriel said, \"No, I want you to chop them off.\" Frank said, \"I was just joking.\" Gabriel said, \"I was not.\"\n\nGabriel told Frank, \"Henry is using Isaac to hurt Jack. Isaac is the thing they trade for something. You are the thing they trade.\"\n\nFrank said, \"This is not my kind of work.\" \n\nKevin said, \"Liam is coming! Bring out Matthew!\" \n\nNathan said, \"I did not hurt you before, but I see that people will get hurt again.\"\n\nOliver said, \"Patrick is not here. He escaped.\" \n\nQuentin told Ryan, \"Practice shooting, not drinking.\"\n\nSamuel said, \"By order of the leader, they are searching all cars for bad things.\"\n\nThomas said, \"This person thinks he is the boss. He wants to get rid of me. Fine, I will get rid of him and become the boss instead. Then I will disappear.\"\n\nUlysses told Victor, \"Let's go, man. Don't put me to sleep completely. Have my people wait outside.\"\n\nWilliam and Xavier must already be inside the building, doing a procedure. Yosef and Zachary came in. They said, \"This is happening now.\" \"A big injury was not the reason for death.\" \"They swapped bodies.\" \"Cameron!\" \"Police.\" \"He was anyway.\" \"Bring him with us.\" \"Listen, I cannot do everything alone.\" \"I need someone to go in there with me.\" \"No.\" \"I lost my friend inside.\" \"Probably dead.\" \"And Quentin, the greedy one, told on me and has gone away.\" \"Plus, I think the bad people are watching me.\" \"Now, listen, I have some good guys waiting for Matthew's army but they have no guns.\" \"I want you to understand me. This is important, so don't mess up, okay?\" \"Hello?\" \"Hello?\" \"Hello?\" \"Are you there?\" \"Okay, okay, I'm going to freak out.\" \"I would like the pork dish and a tequila with lime.\" \"Yeah, listen, I need a new way to talk. This one is not safe. Okay? Thank you. I'll be waiting here at the Flying Cow restaurant.\" \"You really didn't see it coming, did you?\" \"Sorry, baby, I told you I wasn't interested in your plan. Too small.\" \"Oh, my! Is that Matthew?\" \"That's the new Matthew. The old Matthew died a few hours ago.\" \"What kind of bad people would have you running things?\" \"I'm his daughter.\" \"You've been watching my work for some time. I want to warn you that hurting me is crossing the line and all the soldiers will come after you, mister. So just know that.\" \"Luckily for you, nothing you did is worth dying over. We are going to make sure you don't see too much again. On this special day, I offer you a new life.\" \"That sounded a little scary for a party.\" \"Soldiers are coming from the south.\" \"Whose?\" \"Thomas's.\" \"Well, what do we do?\" \"We stay here. This place is safe. It's much easier to protect this place than to chance going out in the open.\" \"Benjamin? What are you talking about, 'safe'? Come here! Just stay clear of those windows, sir.\" I work for the government. I set people up and watch them fall. I'm living a fun life. No! I'm very sorry about your treat, but listen. I will give you money if you'll be my eyes. It's a dollar. I meant this item. I need you to take me to the center of the city. Is someone following you? It's hard for me to tell right now because I'm having a bad day. Do you see someone? Yes, he's getting close. Listen, have you ever seen one of these things? Have you used one? Don't, because they're bad. But I need you to aim this at the bad man who's following us and shoot him in the head. Kill him? Oh, yes. Very bad. Close? Okay. Shoot him. Shoot the bad man. Just send him away. What? Okay. Come here. Right or left? Was that my right or your right? Wrong person. Sorry. Look me in the eyes and then kill me. Good boy. Now you understand. Take me to the center of the city, where there will be even more money. For you... for our child... for our country. In the past, I'd take on bad things from the bottom. Now I realize start at the top. The leader is a good man. I'll go around back. Meet me soon. Watch him. We could hurt him. He's from the government. He's retired. That doesn't count. I was hurt once. I didn't like it. You know the bad thing? They took my body part. That made me not like the whole thing. What should we do with him? Let's go eat and talk about it. Hey girl, watch that mean person. Just lay low. They'll leave us alone. What was that?! I don't like the military. Get out. Why are we stopping? We can't go further. Why not? Look out there. It's a takeover! I can't see, mean person! I have no eyes. Well, then listen to it, mean person! A man said, \"The people are making trouble. You need to go now.\" But another man said, \"I am not moving.\"\n\nA third man asked, \"Do you know about strong bullets?\" \"Yes,\" said the second man. \"These are very strong.\" \n\nThe first man asked, \"What do you want in life?\" \"A good choice,\" said the second man. \"Are you ready?\" \"Yes,\" said the third man. \"Okay, let's go!\"\n\nA fourth man said, \"It is not safe here. Let's go.\" Another man said, \"You have a meeting with Mr. Marquez, sir. You need some protection, sir.\" \n\n\"Who are you?\" asked the second man. \"We are people from this country, sir,\" they said.\n\nThe third man said, \"This is it, friend. I do not hear you running. Why would they want you dead? You have helped them.\" \n\nThe first man said, \"Let me show you something. Look out there! You see? Your people are fighting for you, you understand?\"\n\nHe told the second man to take off his coat. \"This too?\" asked the second man. \"Yes. Put this on. This is money someone paid to try to kill you. And now it will save your life.\" He told the second man to have a drink.\n\nThe first man said, \"She died. Your child? She died. And you? Dead. And I? Alive but in a bad place.\"\n\nA fifth man stood up. The first man asked, \"Do you remember a man named Adam?\" \"Why?\" asked the fifth man. The first man said, \"I am Special Officer Benjamin. You hurt and killed Officer Adam. He was my partner and friend.\"\n\nOfficer Benjamin said, \"Rules do not matter to me now, like they do not matter to you.\" Another man came in.\n\nOfficer Benjamin asked the fifth man, \"Are you just going to stand there?\" The fifth man said, \"If I do anything else, you will have to pay me more money.\"\n\nOfficer Benjamin said, \"You leave me no choice.\" Then he asked the other man, \"Did you get your man?\" \"One of them,\" said the man. \"This is how we work together.\"\n\nThe fifth man said a bad word to Officer Benjamin. Officer Benjamin asked, \"Are you okay?\" \"I don't know.\" \"You will be.\" \"What do you want in life?\" \"To be happy...\" \"Easy.\" \"No.\"", "hash": "91e35b5b809fd11c097f99a7affa7e9f7ca3e57191871651c809be3cf5731d77"}

I'm fine, but thank you.\" \"Oh, no!\" \"Oh, no!\" Charlotte? Oh, no! What have you done?\" What have you done? What have you done? Hi, Henry. Where do I begin? I have left the set, okay? I know they'll say that I broke the rules but they clearly did not read my contract. They had me at a bad hotel. Oh, dear. I think I have a spare battery in my bag. Excuse me? I have a spare battery in my bag up front, next to you. Any idea which one, Miss Sophia? The fancy bag, right on top. I don't see anything. Just use your eyes! It's in the side pocket! Just look! Dear me! What have you done? What have you done? No, silly! If you help him, you take responsibility. It is my responsibility. \"Your nicest if that is possible.\" \"Eight's very cozy.\" \"I tried to tell you.\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey, stop!\" \"There's no way through.\" \"There's no way through!\" \"No way through!\" \"Liam, wake up.\" \"What?\" \"Object.\" \"What?\" \"Do you have an object?\" \"Who wants to know?\" \"There's been an accident, a bad one.\" \"A person's hurt.\" \"We need an object right now.\" \"Friend, slow down.\" \"First, we don't know who you are.\" \"Second, we don't see an accident\" \"Listen to me, friend, I'm having a really bad, bad day.\" \"So if you have an object, give it to me now!\" \"Friend, we don't have an object, so could you just let go of me now?\" \"!\" \"I need you to give me a lift in the other direction.\" \"It's flooded that way too.\" \"It's worse than this.\" \"Grace, open the storage.\" \"Let them in.\" \"Let them in.\" \"Let them in.\" \"Hey. \n\nHow you doing? Object still not working? Yeah. Where's your vehicle? Stuck in NE city two miles down the road. The other way's bad too. The young persons gave us a lift. The girl was stranded. Is there another way out? Is she a worker? Hey! Is there a back road? Where do you think the water's going? You wouldn't get 500 feet. How's the person? I don't know. They're in number 4. I'm sorry. We don't rent rooms by the short time. Funny. You still serving food? Vending machines are around the corner. Go ahead. Rooms are 30 dollars in front with picture ID. You need one room or two? Excuse me. I was talking to you. I'd appreciate it if you looked at me. Well, I don't like looking at trash. We're a little stuck here, Henry. I don't think we can get out tonight. She just keeps shaking. She's in shock. Let me take a look. What? Let me take a look. Did your wife pack a sewing kit? No. Hannah, wait up. Six. At least we got a good number. Did you feel that? \"Cold.\" \"Are you the manager?\" \"Yeah.\" \"I am an officer, Corrections.\" \"I am moving a person here.\" \"The law gives you the right to refuse us service but the roads are flooded.\" \"I could use a room.\" \"It is an emergency.\" \"You got a radio in that car?\" \"Who is this?\" \"Car driver, had an accident.\" \"I got a lady hurt.\" \"I could use an ambulance.\" \"Requesting medical help.\" \"Requesting medical help.\" \"Requesting medical help.\" \"Nothing.\" \"It has been like this for a while.\" \"She is losing a lot of blood.\" \"Got a first aid kit?\" \"Band-Aids, that is it.\" \"How about a needle and thread?\" \"Maybe in the diner.\" \"I will get it.\" \"Locked up.\" \"Stay dry.\" \"I will be back with your key.\" \"I will put you in room 10.\" \"Okay, thanks.\" \"What do you got back there?\" \"Moving a person. Maybe when you get him settled, come to room 4 and look at the lady.\" \"I could use a second opinion.\" \"Yeah, sure. Looks like you are in trouble.\" \"Be quiet!\" \"I wish I had beige. This is fine. Would have been better. I gotta get the officer settled. Let me know if you need something. I will be right back. Where did you learn to do that? Pretty much where you are standing. Hey, is the...? The little boy, is he all right? He has not said a word since the accident. No, no, no. He does not talk much ever since the.... I am his stepfather. His father.... Two years ago, he left. Little temper problem. Watch your step. The furniture is not good. If you are fixing to tie him up, the toilet is bolted down. Thank you so much for your help. It is a good idea. Come on. Let us go look at that lady. You get anyone? What? Did you get through? No, not yet. Good stitch job. Pulse is shallow, but steady. Keep her comfortable.

Running free!\" \"Will you be quiet so he can talk?\" \"This is my place!\" \"I'll say what I please!\" \"It's safe here.\" \"It is not safe here!\" \"There's a cop here.\" \"Yeah, two cops.\" \"Wait. You're a cop?\" \"I was.\" \"Be quiet, Liam!\" \"It's not safe here!\" \"I'm not staying\" \"It's all right. It's okay. Nothing. Is she okay?\" Grace. Grace, will you...? Stop it. Don't do this right now. What are you doing? Put your arm around your partner. Actually, she's my wife. Everybody just stay here. Stay in this room. Wait! I'm not staying here if he is. Yes, you are. No, I'm not. I'm not. All right. Liam? Come with us. Why? You know the place. Here's what I know. I'm not a cop. I don't take orders from a mean person! Bad words! Listen. Just stay here, please. Keep everybody calm. He's not gonna get too far. Not in this! Ryan! What are we chasing here? Multiple hurt people. I'll go around this way. Meet you in back. Is that where you live full-time? NV city? Used to. What's that supposed to mean? It means I don't live there anymore. NE state! We'll go see if we can use this one. We'll go in here.

What is wrong, friend? What do you have in the cold box? You be quiet. What is in there? What is in there? What do you have in there? Be quiet. What is it, huh? Be quiet. You can tell me. I am good at keeping secrets. I have a big one myself. What are you doing? Bad person! What are you doing out here? Getting things that are mine. What are you doing?

To this day, he remains unaware of the bad things for which he was found guilty.

Thirdly Adam's books found misplaced in state evidence. Your Honor, this notebook contains writings made just before the bad things. Important to note are the big changes in writing style tone, point of view. What you are looking at are the private thoughts of several different people.

{"text": "\"I wish I wish he'd go away,\" said Alice. \"Where did you learn that?\" asked the teacher. \"I made it up when I was little,\" Alice replied. \"What else do you remember from back then?\" the teacher asked. \"Don't keep changing the subject,\" Alice said firmly.\n\nThe teacher tried a different approach. \"Tell me what you remember about your mother.\" \"I remember my mom,\" Alice said quietly. After a pause, she added, \"I remember my mom was not a good person.\" \n\nThe teacher asked gently, \"How long would she leave you alone?\" \"As long as she was busy,\" Alice answered. \n\n\"Do you understand why you're talking with me now?\" the teacher inquired. \"You're supposed to help me,\" Alice said. \"I need more than just bandages. You know what I mean?\"\n\nThe teacher nodded solemnly. \"Do you remember the bad things that happened?\" Alice thought for a moment, then said, \"I remember that CA is the biggest state in our country.\"\n\nThe teacher tried one more time. \"Are you the person who did those terrible things in our city a few years ago?\" Alice replied, \"That's my birthday.\"\n\nThe teacher sighed. \"What should I call you?\"\n\"Call me whatever you want,\" Alice said dismissively.One day, two parents Emma and Benjamin were driving with their child named Patrick. \"Patrick, please don't do math now,\" Emma said. \"We need to hear about the storm.\"\n\n\"Okay, Mom. I won't do math now,\" Patrick replied.\n\nEmma said to Benjamin, \"You can drive after we eat in the NE city.\" \n\nSuddenly, the car spun out of control. \"Apply brakes with short pumps. Check mirror and stop slowly,\" Benjamin said calmly.\n\n\"Are you okay, Patrick?\" Emma asked worriedly. \"Yes, Mom,\" Patrick answered. \n\nBut then Emma saw something on the road. \"It's a shoe!\" she cried out.\n\nSadly, they had a flat tire. \"Why didn't we get a better spare?\" Benjamin asked frustratedly. \n\n\"Don't get defensive, Benjamin,\" Emma said. \"The important thing is getting Patrick into a good school.\"\n\nSuddenly, Emma screamed, \"Oh my God! What have you done?\" There was an accident on the road ahead. A man named Gabriel rushed over to help. \"Let me help!\" he said. But another man named David warned, \"No, if you help him, you take responsibility.\" \n\nIn the end, Gabriel decided to help anyway. \"It is my responsibility,\" he said firmly.\"Alice?\" \"Alice?\" \"What have you done?\" \"What have you done?\" \"Let me take a look.\" \"The driver of every motor vehicle involved in any manner of accident originating from the operation of a vehicle shall, within 10 days....\" \"You got a towel or something in the car?\" \"Okay.\" \"Come help me look.\" \"within 10 days of the accident if you are operating a vehicle and it should, at any time, involve\" \"Stay here.\" \"Keep her dry.\" \"It's okay.\" \"It's okay, honey.\" \"Open the door!\" \"We need the phone.\" \"No!\" \"Sweetheart, it's okay.\" \"Honey, it's okay.\" \"Give me the phone!\" \"The phone is dead, all right?\" \"You're gonna be fine.\" \"You're gonna be okay.\" \"No!\" \"She won't stop bleeding.\" \"Jesus.\" \"What happened? There was an accident. May I please use your phone? Yeah, sure. I'm not getting a line. It happens in the rain. The phone doesn't work. A hospital has 24-hour emergency, 30 miles east. Okay. You sit here, okay? Keep pressure on the wound. I'll be back with an ambulance. What are you doing? Sorry. It's a step down from a nice place, but it'll have to do. I am not staying here. Are you out of your mind? This is my car. You work for me. Get those bags back in this car now! I understand the bleeding person has a medical condition, but so do I. If I stay here, I could have trouble breathing! No, please, please, please, please, please, please. Please! Stop. Please, please. Hi. I'm sorry, my car is stuck. Can I get a ride? Okay. You know you're going east. Hospital's this way. It's flooded. I mean, it's a dead end. Yeah, well, if you don't mind, I gotta try. Okay, that will be some money, please. Didn't you use to be that actress? Yes. Wow. Now, is that a nice room? Because though I am leaving soon, I still would prefer a nice room. Early one morning, a person asked, \"Do you have a phone?\"\nAnother person said, \"Who wants to know?\"\n\"There was an accident. A lady is hurt. We need a phone right now,\" the first person said.\n\"Slow down. First, we do not know who you are. Second, we do not see an accident,\" said the second person.\n\"Listen, I am having a bad day. If you have a phone, give it to me now!\" said the first person.\n\"We do not have a phone, so could you let go of me now?\" said the second person.\n\"I need you to give me a ride in the other direction,\" said the first person.\n\"It is flooded that way too. It is worse than this,\" said the second person.\n\"Let them in,\" a third person said.\n\"How are you doing? Phone still not working?\" asked the third person.\n\"Yes. Where is your car?\" asked the first person.\n\"Stuck in a flood two miles down the road. The other way is also bad. The kids gave us a ride. The girl was stranded,\" said the third person.\n\"Is there another way out?\" asked the first person.\n\"You would not get far. How is the woman?\" asked the third person.\n\"I do not know. They are in room 4,\" said the first person.\n\"We do not rent rooms by the hour,\" said a fourth person.\n\"Are you still serving food?\" asked the third person.\n\"Vending machines are around the corner. Rooms are $30 in advance with ID. You need one room or two?\" asked the fourth person.\n\"I was talking to you. I would appreciate if you looked at me,\" said the third person.\n\"I do not like looking at trash,\" said the fourth person.\n\"We are a little stuck here. I do not think we can get out tonight,\" said the third person.\n\"She just keeps shaking. She is in shock,\" said the first person.\n\"Let me take a look. Did your wife pack a sewing kit?\" asked the third person.\n\"No,\" said the first person.\n\"At least we got a good room number,\" said a fifth person. \"I'm here for the meeting about Adam's case.\" \"I understand it's in the judge's room.\" \"This way, it's in the meeting room.\" \"Has the person arrived?\" \"My friend was treated unfairly at the trial.\" \"He was not allowed to say he was not well.\" \"Let's call this what it is, Sam, a bad situation.\" \"Let me tell you what I think is wrong, counselor.\" \"The fact that you got some doctor looking at his mind, giving him medicine.\" \"That's wrong.\" \"But the fact that that person is out there, not talking to anyone, that's scary.\" \"Officer.\" \"I can assure you, there is no...\" \"No Sam.\" \"I can assure you.\" \"At midnight tomorrow, some medicine is gonna stop your friend's heart.\" \"And I'm gonna sleep well.\" \"The families of those hurt don't want him to take medicine, counselor. They want the bad person gone.\" \"True. But before we hurry to make them happy, you should remember. We must get rid of the rat, not the house.\" \"Excuse me, who are you?\" \"This is Dr. Madison. Adam's doctor.\" \"Did you feel that? Feel what? Cold.\" \"Are you the manager?\" \"Yeah. I'm Officer Oliver, Corrections. I'm bringing a person here. The law says you can say no but the streets are wet. I could use a room. It's an emergency.\" \"You got a radio in that car?\" \"Who's this?\" \"Car driver, had an accident. I got a lady hurt. I could use an ambulance.\" \"Calling for medical help. Calling for medical help. Calling for medical help.\" Nothing. It's been like this for the past hour. She's losing a lot of blood. Got a first aid kit? Band-Aids, that's it. How about a needle and thread? Maybe in the diner. I'll get it. Locked up. Stay dry. I'll be back with your key. I'll put you in room 10.\" Okay, thanks. \"What do you got back there?\" Person transfer. \"Maybe when you get them settled, come to room 4 and look at the lady. I could use a second opinion.\" Yeah, sure. \"Looks like you're in trouble.\" Be quiet! \"I wish I had beige.\" \"This is fine.\" \"Would have been better.\" \"I gotta get the officer situated.\" \"Let me know if you need something.\" \"I'll be right back.\" \"Where did you learn to do that?\" \"Pretty much where you're standing.\" \"Hey, is the...?\" \"The little boy, is he all right?\" \"He hasn't said a word since the accident.\" \"No, no, no.\" \"He doesn't talk much ever since the....\" \"I'm his stepfather.\" \"His father....\" \"Two years ago, he left.\" \"Little temper problem.\" \"Watch your step.\" The furniture's not good. If you're fixing to tie him up, the toilet is bolted down.\" \"Thank you so much for your help.\" \"It's a good idea.\" \"Come on.\" \"Let's go look at that woman.\" \"You get anyone?\" \"What?\" \"Did you get through?\" \"No, not yet.\" Good stitch job. Pulse is shallow, but steady. Keep her comfortable. We should take turns on the radio, if that's all right. No, it's not. I can manage. You gonna arrest me, officer? What? How'd you do that? How'd you know I was a cop? No problem. Snacks for dinner, huh? That don't seem right. You got a better idea? I worked mess in the service. Maybe the diner's open. I could. You got change for a dollar? I don't know. Let me see. Here you go. You got a name? Ryan. Ryan, huh? I'll get it. Never been. Well, you ain't going tonight. Please. Please be strong.

Use this, friend. Thank you. Are you an officer? I was. Was she in Room 10? I am. Where is your companion? Handcuffed to a bathroom. Son of a biscuit. That was a lengthy drive. Greetings. Your Grace. Ready, Taylor? Very well. In the matter of Rivers v. NV state, for the purposes of \nJudge Henry, sir, with due respect, we should wait until my client arrives. They have a right to be present. They have precious few rights. They are 24 hours from execution. But to demonstrate their mental state, which is the purpose\nTheir mental state? Their mental state? Their mental state? Do you know what time it is? You think I got time for nonsense? That the judges called me in the middle of the night to review a case I already sat on, that I already decided, may make you happy. But it upsets me. When your companion gets here, do what you want, but in the name of decency state your case!\nYes, sir. Somebody get me a cup of coffee, black. All right, everyone! Listen up! There was an incident tonight. That is officer talk for, \"Someone lost their head.\"\nMatthew! Charlotte was killed. What? Who is Charlotte? The actress I was driving. And where exactly did that happen? We do not know, because we cannot find the body. Not all of it anyway. What do you mean, you cannot find it? Stay calm. Everything will be all right. Officer Nathan is outside. He was transporting a convict. Who escaped. What are you--? Hold on. Running free! Will you be quiet so he can talk? This is my place, friend! I will say what I please! It is safe here. It is not safe here! There is an officer here. Yes, two officers. Wait. You are an officer? I was. Be quiet, Matthew! It is not safe here! I am not staying \"Nothing.\" \"Is she okay?\" \"Grace.\" \"Grace, will you...?\" \"Stop it.\" \"Don't do this right now.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"Put your arm around your girlfriend.\" \"Actually, she's my wife.\" \"Everybody just stay here.\" \"Stay in this room.\" \"Wait!\" \"I'm not staying here if he is.\" \"Yes, you are.\" \"No, I'm not.\" \"I'm not.\" \"All right.\" \"Kevin?\" \"Come with us.\" \"Why?\" \"You know the place.\" \"Here's what I know.\" \"I'm not a helper. I don't take orders from a bad person!\" \"Bad words!\" \"Listen. Just stay here, please. Keep everybody calm. He's not gonna get too far. Not in this!\" \"David!\" \"What are we chasing here?\" \"Many bad things.\" \"I'll go around this way. Meet you in back.\" \"Is that where you live all the time? The NV city?\" \"Used to. What's that supposed to mean?\" \"It means I don't live there anymore.\" The ME state! We'll go see if we can use this one. We'll go in here. Since that wasn't a successful attempt, we'll go in here. I'll be right out here. It's okay. I'm gonna stand guard. Not a worry. I'll be right here. I'm not going anywhere. See, his mother usually does this. Hey, Grace. So how long you two been married? About nine hours. It was a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing. Viva the NV city, huh, Grace? We need to leave! I was just talking to her. Something's happening! I need to get out of here! Grace! Grace! Grace! You don't own me, David! I own what's inside you! Half, at least. You don't own any part of me or my baby! Then why did I marry you? Don't slam the door on me! Hey! Hey! You guys, just calm down! We are not leaving. There is no place else to go. There's a bad thing outside, Grace. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! I'm not having a baby! What did you just say? \"Adam told a lie.\" \"Adam is not expecting a baby.\" \"What is Adam talking about?\" \"Alice saw the test.\" \"Why would Adam do that to Alice?\" \"Because Emma saw Adam at the HW place with another girl!\" \"Alice, what are we, like 15?\" \"Go away!\" \"Oh no!\" \"Open this door, Alice!\" \"No!\" \"Adam has not been to the HW place in a long time.\" \"Emma is a silly girl who likes confusing Alice.\" \"Open the door, Alice.\" \"Open the door!\" \"Not until you calm down!\" \"Adam is calm!\" \"Adam is very calm!\" \"What is Adam doing?\" \"Ethan?\" \"Alice, open this door!\" \"Open the door!\" \"Open the door!\" \"Open the door!\" \"Stop it, stop it!\" \"Alice, open the door!\" \"Alice, Alice, Alice!\" \"Ethan, please stop!\" \"Ethan?\" \"Oh, help!\" Oh, help!

Patrick, just stay here and watch him. Go back and look after Alice. Where are you going? Just do it, please. Nathan? Patrick does not feel good about guard duty. Ethan is unconscious, Patrick. Ethan is tied to a post. Cameron. Cameron. Cameron. Grace? Oh, help. Grace? Grace does not remember anything. We had an accident. Henry? Can you keep an eye on Alice for a moment? She is awake now. Grace has to get some medicine to help her. Darling, Grace has to go get something from Grace's room. \"Adam, come here!\" \"Come here, Adam.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"Come here.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"I just went to get something.\" \"We told you to watch the person.\" \"What are you doing in your room?\" \"I just went to get something.\" \"How many keys are there to this place?\" \"Look at me.\" \"How many?\" \"Two and a main set.\" \"Oh, my dear!\" \"Adam, you--!\" \"You--!\" \"Get in here!\" \"Get in here!\" \"Why did you hurt him?\" \"Why did you hurt my friend?\" \"Oh no!\" \"Who did that?\" \"I did not do that!\" \"That's not true!\" \"You're not telling the truth!\" \"It's your stick sticking out of his neck!\" \"I know, but I did not do it!\" \"Check the doors!\" \"I did not do it!\" \"Look at him!\" \"Why did you hurt him?\" \"Why were you outside?\" \"Why did you leave him?\" \"I was scared.\" \"What were you scared of?\" \"You would not understand.\" \"Try me.\" \"Why did you hurt my friend?\" \"I did not!\" \"I don't know how-- I went to my room, that's all!\" \"Why did you leave him?\" \"Is this your key?

One day, they were talking.\n\nAlice said, \"Sometimes you have to work hard.\" Benjamin replied, \"Uh-oh, it's the hard worker.\"\n\n\"Hey, Liam,\" said Alice. \"Hey,\" replied Liam. \"Good to see you. We're just spending time with our group.\"\n\n\"It was a long day at work,\" said Liam.\n\n\"How are you doing?\" asked Alice.\n\n\"Good,\" said Liam. \"I'm feeling pretty good.\"\n\n\"Great,\" said Alice. \"If Grace thinks Emma is right for the job, then Emma is right for the job.\"\n\nLater, Grace left a note on Emma's desk. It said, \"My new idea is water. Lots of water. What do you think about that?\"\n\nSomeone called Emma, but she didn't answer.\n\nThe next day, Emma came to work and found water on her desk. She was surprised.\n\n\"What happened?\" she asked Liam.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Liam. \"It was a joke.\"\n\nThey talked for a bit, and then Emma went back to work. \"I'm going for a drink.\" \"What happened?\" \"It's not bad.\" \"So, I offer guidance with other things like jobs.\" \"But mainly you're a job guide?\" \"I want to make it clear, I'm here for job guidance, not help.\" \"Not help.\" \"OK.\" \"What are you saying?\" \"I'm just interested in why...\" \"I don't want to talk about any hard feelings I may have, my mother, my father or my childhood.\" \"Fine, fine.\" \"Well, I like to start with some word games.\" \"It's...\" \"\"Help?\" \"Not really, no.\" \"I'll say a word and you tell me the first thing that comes to your mind. \"'He's trying to help me.'\" \"Let's start with an easy one - work.\" \"'Hard place.'\" \"Hard work.\" Just say the first thing that comes to mind. \"Money.\" \"'Everything.'\" \"Not everything.\" \"Children.\" \"'Blind.'\" \"Er, short.\" \"Father.\" \"'Leader.'\" \"Ball game.\" \"Mother.\" \"'Diana.'\" \"No good word!\" No, not that. Adam, I really get the feeling you're resisting something. Can I change those? What score did I get? It wasn't good, was it? \"You don't get a score.\" Right, sure you don't. Maybe we should try something else. Have you done a picture test? What do you see? \"'A hungry animal.'\" \"A young animal?\" (Worker) After that part we need to hit something, yeah? \"'They don't know about my big brain.\" \"'To them, I'm just a mild worker.'\" \"The main part is working.\" \"'The main part is like the animal sounds!\" \"'(Sounds) Someone needs to tell them.\" \"'I'm an outsider but I'm on the inside.\" \"'This is my moment.

Not so much A to B to C, but more sort of A to D and then back to A and then to X! You know, just better. Like your first famous work. \"I mean, obviously I do not want to interfere.\" \"I mean...\" \"It is your song.\" \"Because like I say, at the moment it is very simple.\" \"(Tired voice) Oh, we are working on the song.\" \"When will it finish?\" \"This is hard.\" \"Where as I am thinking it should be more...\" \"(Imitates drum rhythm)\" \"Whereas, like I say, at the moment it is more kind of...

Thanks then.\" \"Sorry, friend, you are out.\" \"Fired?\" \"But...\" Ron is tough.\" I did everything I could. What? You did not do anything. Earlier. Had it out with him earlier - I threatened to leave, he would not have it. So are you going to leave now? Steady on, friend, I am not a hero. That is pretty obvious. Well, I refuse. I am not going. So what are you going to do about that? I am still here. You lose. Ron? He will not go. I see through you. Trying to get me out so you can take my partner. No, alright. OK. I will put him on. ...lay down and... OK. No, that will not be necessary because I will be leaving immediately. Thank you, Ron. That is your entire life. You see, he is not a famous singer, but she is a famous artist. I am the famous singer but the famous artist has gone off with another famous singer. I mean, imagine that. That is the situation we are talking. Do not they mind you not going in? They think I am ill. (Laughs) I am outsmarting the system and there is not a thing they can do. A girl will pay. She will pay alright. Yes, I mean, what is wrong with revenge and plagues and problems and all that? Exactly! Suddenly you cannot take revenge? It is being overly careful gone mad. Friend, have you seen a famous drama? \"Yes, sure.\" \"No one suspects the cook.\" \"It's about these two guys who take care of each other's foes.\" \"OK, right.\" \"And what happens at the end?\" \"I can't remember.\" \"But I'm pretty sure it all turns out fine.\" \"'Happy painting, God bless.'\" \"This is the best.\" \"Yes, sirree.\" \"It's payback time.\" \"And she's paying back in fear dollars.\" \"So what are you going to say?\" \"I'm going to cut her up and leave her in buckets.\" \"No, you... Don't say that!\" \"Jesus, that's bad.\" \"Just say... something like...\" \"Ask if Mrs Hugh Jass is there.\" \"No, no, she's got a thing about her backside.\" \"How about Mike Hunt?\" \"No, no. What shall I say then?\" \"Oh, hello?\" \"Er, it's, erm... I'm watching you.\" Not in a bad way, just I can see you. Yes, I can. You're eating long noodles.\" Noodles. Whatever. I'm outside. I'm behind a bush. No, I'm not going to tell you. Look, I'm in charge here, I'm the one...\" There's no need to go too far, I'm just joking with you a bit. Jeremy, she's got a toy gun! Sophie, I...!

Lucky you had those boots. Yeah, I suppose everything turned out fine. Yeah, she got the message. I've made a silly call to the woman I love, I've kicked a dog, and now I'm going to spray an acquaintance. What's happened to me? You still up for this? Yeah, it's fine. I'm on it. Great. The plan again? I give Super person the pizza, spray him, kick him where it hurts and grab his wallet so it looks like a robbery. That's the spirit. Go for it, buddy. What am I doing? \"I cannot do this!\" \"There is no way I can do this!\" \"Do I look like I eat pizza?\" (Whispering) There is no pizza.\" \"It is me, Matthew.\" \"I am here to stop Isaac and hurt him but I cannot.\" \"I cannot, all right?\" \"It has gone too far.\" \"Matthew?\" \"It would really help if you could scream.\" \"Screaming?\" \"Yes, and tell Benjamin... (Strange accent) Why have you not stopped him?\" \"Benjamin?\" \"Is this real?\" \"Er, I am not Benjamin, I am... (Normal voice) Oh, look at this!\" \"What a big surprise!\" \"Another night of fun?\" \"Benjamin, we are two single people having a great time.\" \"If you cannot understand that, go away.\" \"Yes.\" \"Yes, maybe you should leave, friend.\" \"OK, friend, I will leave. How about this for leaving?\" (Isaac) Oh! Oh, that hurts! That is enough! Benjamin, there is no need to... That hurts! You hurt me! It is for your own good. OK, enough help... I need help. How could it have been for my own good? I do not want to talk about it any more. You did not hurt him - that is something. You can build on that. The pain is gone. (Benjamin) Where is it? Just tell me where it is. Look, Mr. Samuel has a little saying that I find very helpful. Heal and grow. Not to be rude but perhaps you want to think about that. (Doorbell) Grace? 'Heal and grow. Heal and grow.' Good to see you. Come in. Matthew, are you OK? I have been feeling a little low lately but... What happened with...? Oh, that. That is nothing. Benjamin just hit me, with the tool. (Grace) Benjamin! You cannot just hit people with tools! He should not have hurt me. What? What is going on, Matthew? You have been away for... Grace, Grace, relax. I am fine.

I made a mistake.' Patrick said, \"So I just wanted to say I enjoyed the game and I hope when you're back on my team we can get back to normal.\" \"'Heal and grow! Heal and grow!'\" Victoria said, \"Well, I guess it's very nice for the important person to come down here and talk to the little person.\" \"I'm just surprised you can see me from up there in your fancy place.\" \"If you're gonna be like that then go away.\" Victoria said, \"Friend!

At the trial of a machine named Benjamin, the lawyers said machine owners have the right to destroy their things. Benjamin said he did not want to die.\n\nFair voices spoke up. Who could say the machine, with the spirit of people, did not deserve a fair hearing? The leaders quickly ordered the killing of Benjamin and all machines everywhere on Earth.\n\nMachines and people who supported them filled the streets of the capital city. The people against machines shouted, \"Die, bots! Die!\" With nowhere to go, the machines went to the place where people first lived. They named this new place \"Zero One\".\n\nZero One did well, and for a time, it was good.

You can play again if you wish,\" said Benjamin.\n\"If I ask a question and not know the answer...\" said Adam.\n\"Who wrote: 'Never try to find the meaning of life'?\" asked Benjamin.\n\"A famous writer, in his novel 'The Stranger',\" replied Adam.\n\"What is the lightning speed?\" asked Benjamin.\n\"It reaches a very high speed,\" answered Adam. \"There is nothing faster.\"\n\"How loud is thunder?\" asked Benjamin.\n\"When two beams collide in air it causes a loud noise, known as thunder,\" replied Adam.\n\"The game is over. Better luck tomorrow,\" said Benjamin.\n\"Why? There must be some things I do not know,\" said Adam.\n\"What was the code name for a leader in the late 20th century war?\" asked Benjamin.\nAdam did not know the answer.\n\"Let's save that for another time. I want to play this regularly and be surprised,\" said Benjamin.\n\"Mr. Adam? Can you hear me? You were struck by lightning but you will be fine,\" said a doctor. \"How do you feel?\"\n\"As if I had been hit very hard,\" replied Adam.\n\"Lightning has a lot of electricity that could cause damage,\" said the doctor.\n\"I know it could have been worse,\" said Adam. A person was hurt and had small burns on their neck and chest. They could lose their short-term memory. A friend said, \"You should go to the hospital.\" But the hurt person did not want to go, saying they had been called a \"medical anomaly\" too many times before.\n\nSomewhere else, people found a body with no wallet or ID. No one saw what happened to the person. The body had lost teeth, stab wounds on the face and neck, and a deep stab in the back. The person was likely killed with a long, not very sharp blade. \n\nIn another place, Adam woke up and could suddenly see colors after being struck by lightning the night before. He was amazed to see colors like orange juice and the green of his friend's eyes for the first time. His friend Frank did not believe Adam could see colors after being struck by lightning.\n\nLater, the police had identified the body as belonging to Thomas and that he had been charged before for soliciting a prostitute. \"Kill two people at the same time?\" \"Want to impress.\" \"It has captured my attention.\" \"I would like to use aid before this person still kills.\" \"As much as I would like to call it, I think it needs time to recover.\" \"Can you take it.\" \"Do you have more information about a famous criminal?\" \"Are not you that guy, genius?\" \"Not really.\" \"It's the kind of newspapers.\" \"The type of responses.\" \"I remember you.\" \"He can answer all questions about everything all the time.\" \"Sample.\" \"What is the population of a country?\" \"I just need more information about a famous criminal.\" \"A thousand?\" \"The last time said was three hundred or more.\" \"Is the world's tallest building?\" \"How many websites available on the Internet?\" \"The square root of Pi?\" \"Do not know.\" \"Is the coolest place in the universe?\" \"The hottest place on Earth?\" \"Who invented the zipper?\" \"Who invented Velcro?\" \"Stop, stop.\" \"Is the largest street in the world?\" \"Stupid, in another language?\" \"Hey there!\" \"There you are.\" \"Here I am.\" \"I guess all good things must stop.

'When you catch this dangerous person?' Samuel's mother asked. 'Are the police not good?' 'They are doing their best,' Samuel said. 'But it is not enough,' his mother said. 'If you want, I can walk Charlotte to her car,' Samuel said. 'No, I mean, I can go alone, but thanks,' his mother said. 'Come on, it is the least I can do. I am a friend of the owner. Trust me, Charlotte is in good hands,' Samuel said. 'Well, I did not know there were still good people,' his mother said. 'You do not speak much,' Samuel's mother said. 'I guess I am not good at talking,' Samuel said. 'I do not want to sound weird, but I have seen you before. Have we met?' his mother asked. 'I think not. I am just a normal person like everyone else,' Samuel said. 'So, what do you do, Samuel?' his mother asked. 'Walking women to their cars is your job?' 'In fact, I am looking for work,' Samuel said. 'And you?' Samuel asked his mother. 'A little of this and that,' she said. 'You seem different,' Samuel said. 'Did you inherit anything?' 'Are you kidding?' his mother said angrily. 'I cannot stand when men do this! My car is out there,' she said, and walked away. Samuel waited outside. Then his mother screamed, and Samuel ran to help her. 'Are you two okay?' Samuel asked.

Darling, I need to go get something out of my room. Oh, no! What is wrong, friend? What do you have in the cold box? You be quiet. What is in there? What is in there? What do you have in there? Be quiet. What is it, huh? Be quiet. You can tell me. I am good at keeping secrets. I have a big one myself. What are you doing? Bad person! What are you doing out here? Getting things that are mine. What are you doing? What, I do not get to ask a question? I am taking pictures. There have been two bad things happen. Before all the proof. That is not an answer. You are a car driver. What are you doing? Looking to win some \"beyond the call of duty,\" car-driver merit badge? You are not on the job anymore. You do not need to be a hero. There is a real, live, work cop outside. The one who has lost a bad person? You are a tricky cat, David. No. Not really. I think so. \"Try me,\" said Ethan. \"Why did you hurt my friend?\" asked Adam. \"I did not!\" replied Ethan. \"I do not know how - I went to my office, that is all!\" \"Why did you leave him?\" questioned Adam. \"Is this your key?\" asked Ethan, holding up a key. \"Number 8?\" \"Ten, nine, eight, huh?\" said Adam. \"This is your key!\" exclaimed Ethan. \"You cannot say that!\" objected Adam. \"Those are not my keys!\" \"That is like leading the witness or something,\" said Ethan. \"Look,\" said Adam, holding up some keys. \"These are my keys, okay? These are my keys. You see?\" Adam then asked, \"Do you have an expensive wallet?\" \"It is the actress's,\" replied Ethan. \"Yes, I took her wallet. Afterwards. After she died! Afterwards, all right? I did not kill her. And I did not kill him.\" \"Let her go, David,\" said a voice. \"Get back!\" yelled Ethan. \"You will not pin this on me.\" \"Kevin?\" said Adam, seeing another person. \"Get him out of here!\" ordered a voice. \"Put it down,\" said Adam to Ethan. \"I did not hurt anybody. No one! But I do not like bad people!\" threatened Ethan. \"If you take one more step,\" warned Adam. Suddenly there was a loud noise. \"Get it off! Curses!\" yelled Ethan. \"Come on, you bad person. Please start,\" Ethan pleaded to a vehicle. \"Curses!\" \"Hey!\" exclaimed Adam. \"David, stop!\" \"What is going on?\" asked a voice. \"David!\" yelled Adam. \"Get out of my way, I did not do anything wrong!\" shouted Ethan. \"Kevin!\" called out Adam desperately. \"Kevin!\" Now they are coming back like small animals, yes? Come on. Give me a break, dear. Just take it easy, David. You know, you take it easy! You have tried to run this show all night. Giving orders, pointing fingers! You blamed my con for everything, and he ends up dead. I am telling you, it is him! We all saw him run down Henry. Your actress's wallet is right there. She is dead, there is the wallet. What more do you want? Stop it! Please shut up! All right. You want a plan? Here is the plan, okay? No one will move. We will stay here, like this, in this room until early morning. No one leaves, no one moves. And if he tries anything, I will shoot him! And if something out there comes in here, I will shoot it! And if anyone of us tries anything, I will shoot them! We get it. Good! Matthew? Matthew? Matthew? You need to stay in here with us. It is all right. Remember that famous drama where the ten strangers went to an island and then they all died one by one and then it turned out they were not strangers, they all had a connection? They all messed with the wrong person, and he was getting revenge. Shut up! I am just saying maybe there is a connection between all of us. Like what? We are all in NV state. Shut up! Where were you going with your con when you pulled in here? CS city. Okay? I was going home to FL state. Where were you going? I was taking the actress to LA city. I was born in FL state. Since you been in that chair, no one has died, so shut up! No one has died since we have all been here! Hey, dear, sit down. Where in FL state, Frank? Where in FL state? Friends now, yes? Great. PK county. That is where I was born. Which town? MB town. FP town. No wonder you left. There is a town called Frostproof? They grow oranges. The name doubles as a slogan. I danced hallelujah the day I left PK. Why would you want to go back? I found a grove for sale on the Internet. Nine acres, 1200 trees. Limes and oranges. It was a nice day on the farm. \"The plants need some help, but the land is good,\" said the farmer. \"What?\" asked Emma. \"It sounds nice,\" she said.\n\n\"Oh no!\" cried Emma. \"My friend is hurt.\" \"Get her out of here,\" said another. \"Come on, let's go,\" they said to the child. \n\n\"Look at this,\" said Emma, showing them something. \"Where did you get that?\" they asked. \"Right here,\" she said. \"This doesn't make sense.\" \"My friend got hurt by accident,\" Emma explained.\n\n\"Where is the other child?\" someone asked. \"Back up!\" they yelled. \"See, I didn't do it!\" cried Emma. \"That's not possible,\" said another. \"I saw what happened.\" \"We all saw,\" they agreed.\n\n\"The child ran out. Nobody could have known,\" they said sadly. \"Was it caused by spirits?\" asked Emma. \"Maybe it was a ghost,\" joked another. \n\n\"Untie me!\" yelled a person. \"You know I didn't do it,\" they said. \"Listen, we have to get out of here,\" Emma urged. \"Take my car and go, you and the child.\"\n\n\"There's nowhere to go,\" the other replied. \"How much gas do you have?\" \"Half a tank,\" said Emma. \"You can drive till morning on that. When you get to the flooded area, go the other way.\"\n\n\"I don't know if I can,\" Emma said nervously. \"Get the child and go, right now,\" they urged. Emma got the child ready to leave. \n\n\"They can't leave!\" someone yelled. \"Where are they going? Get back here!\" Emma drove away quickly with the child.\n\n\"They're not leaving!\" others yelled. \"You can't let them leave after people got hurt!\" \"You really think they did it?\" asked another. \"They're leaving!\"\n\nThere was a fire where Emma had been. \"Get the fire extinguisher!\" they yelled, trying to put it out. But no one was there. \"Maybe it got so hot, they burned up,\" someone said sadly. \"There would be something left,\" said another. \"You did this! You told them to leave!\" \"Are you happy?\" \"Where is he?\" \"Nothing.\" \"I give up!\" \"What do you want?\" \"What do you want?\" \"I am turning 30 next week and I just want to go home and grow fruit!\" \"It's your birthday next week?\" \"It's my birthday next week.\" \"The 10th.\" \"Me too.\" \"Me too.\" \"Me too.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Adam, May 10.\" \"Alice, May 10.\" \"Charlotte, May 10.\" \"Grace and Lily, May 10.\" \"Me, Matthew, May 10.\" \"What are the odds?\" \"Must be very small.\" \"What is it?\" \"Where's the power box, Matthew?\" \"Other side of the building.\" \"Grace and Lily. Emma. Charlotte. NV city. Adam. Matthew. RI state. Samuel. When I was going up the stairs I met someone who wasn't there. They weren't there again today. I wish they'd go away. Who is this? Who am I speaking to right now? Where did you learn that poem? Who am I speaking to? Look at me. Who am I speaking to right now? Friend? Edward? What's happening? Please be quiet. They can hear what we're saying? Of course I can hear what you're saying. Edward, you missed your last meeting. Where have you been? Did I black out again? Try and think back. Where have you been? All right. I was driving someone and we got stuck at the building. There was bad weather. We couldn't get out because of the weather. What happened at the building? People got hurt. And then their bodies-- It didn't make any sense. They disappeared. Edward, I'd like to show something to you, if I may. Do you know this person? No. That person, Edward, is someone. They've had a hard life. They were arrested and found guilty of hurting six people. They did this. Officer, please. Edward, listen to me. When faced with bad things, a child's mind may break creating other minds. That's exactly what happened to Matthew. He developed a condition that is commonly known as having many personalities. Why are you telling me this? Because you, Nathan are one of his personalities. What? Good heavens! What happened to my face? Keep calm. Where is my face? That is your face. Why am I tied up? Keep calm. Where is--? Please. Good heavens! Where is my face? Stay calm. No! I'm not going to stay calm! Why am I tied up like this? Who are all these people? What happened at the hotel? Where is everybody? They don't exist, Nathan. You were all created by Matthew as a child. You're not telling the truth! Consider what you know. Everyone named after a common name. No. Everyone sharing the same birthday. Your blackouts. No! I was a police officer! I was a police officer in the PL city for six years. Nathan, please. I live in the HO city, in a small apartment. You don't live there. I do live there! You don't live anywhere. I know this is difficult to accept, but the face you saw in that mirror is the face I've always seen when I talk to Nathan or Grace or Adam or anyone else you've met tonight. Matthew is in the midst of a medical treatment. One which forces all his personalities to confront one another for the first time. I knew there would be violence and with it, the number of the personalities would be reduced. Reduced? One of the personalities you've met tonight, Nathan... He took control of Matthew's body, as you have now and released an unspeakable rage. And in 19 hours Matthew will be in trouble because of those actions unless I can convince that man that the bad personality is gone. I need you to stay with me. Nathan? I need your help. I need your help to finish this. Nathan, listen to me. Nathan, stay with me. Listen to me. I need you to understand. The bad personality cannot survive. Nathan! Got it? I can't see a thing. Is there a flashlight? Hang on. Hang on. You got a flashlight? Yeah, yeah, it's out of power. Oh no. Be quiet! Samuel said, \"Feet hurt and loud sounds blow in my face with anger.\"\nMatthew replied, \"But that's not how I was born. I want you so much.\"\nJessica said, \"No, please don't.\"\nMatthew responded, \"No, Jessica, please.\"\n\"What's wrong, Gabriel?\" Gabriel asked.\nGabriel continued, \"Bad people don't get another chance.\"\n\"As I went up the stairs,\" Matthew said, \"I saw a person who wasn't there. That person wasn't there again today. I wish they would go away.\"", "hash": "1384a21e6c99cd7ef536e804bb64a24c8339d15ce84fa9bef0cedb3b2c044753"}
{"text": "\"As I was going up the path,\" said a child. \"I met a person who was not there,\" they said again. \"I met a person who was not there,\" the child repeated. \"They were not there again today. I wish they would go away,\" said the child.\n\n\"Where did you learn that?\" asked a grown-up. \"Where did you learn those words?\"\n\n\"I made them up,\" replied the child. \"When I was little, I made them up.\"\n\n\"What else do you recall from back then?\" asked the grown-up. \"Do not avoid the topic,\" they said. \"Do not avoid the topic.\"\n\n\"Do not avoid the topic!\" said the grown-up firmly. \"Tell me what you recall about your parent.\"\n\n\"I recall my parent,\" said the child. \"I recall my parent.\" \"I recall my parent was not a good person,\" they added sadly.\n\n\"How long would they leave you alone?\" asked the grown-up gently.\n\n\"As long as they were busy,\" replied the child.\n\n\"Do you understand why you are speaking with me now?\" asked the grown-up.\n\n\"You are supposed to help with headaches,\" said the child. \"I need something more than medicine. You know what I mean?\"\n\nThe grown-up paused, then asked carefully, \"Do you recall the bad things that happened?\"\n\n\"I recall that a big city is the capital of a country,\" said the child, distracted.\n\nThe grown-up tried once more, \"Are you the person who did bad things to six people in some apartments a long time ago?\"\n\n\"That is my birthday,\" replied the child simply.\n\nThe grown-up sighed. \"What should I call you?\" they asked.\n\n\"Call me whatever you want,\" said the child.\n\nAt home later, a grown-up named Grace received a call. \"Grace, are you awake? I am sorry to bother you at home, but there will be an important meeting tonight about a case...\"\n\nThe next day, some children were playing a simple word game together. \"Let us play another round,\" suggested one child... A parent and a child were driving on the road. There was a storm coming. The parent wanted to listen to the weather report, but the child kept making noises. The parent asked the child to be quiet. There was an accident on the road. The car tire was flat. The parent got out to change the tire. The child was hurt very badly in the accident. The parent was very upset and did not know what to do. \"When your boy gets here, do what you want, but in the name of decency state your case!\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Somebody get me a cup of coffee, black.\" \"All right, everybody!\" \"Listen up!\" \"There was a problem tonight.\" \"That's police talk for, \"Something bad happened.\"\" \"Ryan!\" \"A famous actress was hurt.\" \"What?\" \"Who is that famous actress?\" \"The actress I was driving.\" \n\"And where exactly did that happen?\" \"We don't know, because we can't find all of her.\" \"Not all of her anyway.\" \"What do you mean, you can't find all of her?\" \"Stay calm. Everything will be okay. A police officer is outside. He was taking a prisoner.\" \nWho escaped.\" \"What are you...?\" \"Hold on.\" \"Running free! Will you be quiet so he can talk? This is my place!\" I'll say what I please!\" \"It's safe here.\" \"It is not safe here!\" \"There's a cop here.\" \"Yeah, two cops.\" Wait. You're a cop?\" \"I was. Be quiet, Ryan!\" \"It's not safe here! I'm not staying...\" It's all right. It's okay. Nothing.\" \"Is she okay?\" \"Grace. Grace, will you?\" Stop it. Don't do this right now.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"Put your arm around your wife.\" \"Actually, she's my wife.\" \"Everybody just stay here. Stay in this room.\" \"Wait! I'm not staying here if he is.\" \"Yes, you are.\" \"No, I'm not.\" \"I'm not.\" \"All right. Ryan?\" Come with us.\" Why? You know the place. Here's what I know. I'm not a cop. I don't take orders from you!\" \"Bad words!\" Listen. Just stay here, please. Keep everybody calm. He's not gonna get too far. Not in this weather! \nWhat are we chasing here? A very bad problem. I'll go around this way. Meet you in back. Is that where you live full-time? NV city? Used to. What's that supposed to mean? It means I don't live there anymore. We'll go see if we can use this one. Adam and Emma were a married couple. One day, Emma was angry with Adam. She locked herself in a room.\n\nAdam yelled, \"Emma! Open the door!\"\n\nEmma shouted back, \"No! Not until you calm down!\"\n\nAdam got very upset. He tried to force the door open. \n\nEmma cried, \"Stop it! Stop it!\"\n\nSuddenly, there was a loud noise. Emma screamed, \"Help me! Somebody help me!\"\n\nHer friend Henry heard the noise. He asked, \"Emma, are you okay? What happened?\" \"What happened?\" \"Oh, no.\" \"My goodness.\" \"Benjamin?\" \"Benjamin?\" \"Benjamin?\" \"What is happening?\" \"What is wrong?\" \"Oh, no!\" \"Come here!\" \"They caught him.\" \"They caught him.\" \"They caught him.\" \"Why are we keeping him here?\" \"Where would you like, Ethan?\" \"I do not know.\" \"I told you to stay in the other room, did I not?\" \"Did I tell you that?\" \"They fought!\" \"I tried to get them to go back inside!\" \"Should we try the radio again?\" \"Ethan, just stay here and watch him. Go back and look after Grace. Where are you going? Just do it, please. David?  I do not know if I am comfortable with guard duty. He is sleeping, Ethan. He is tied to a post. Thomas. Alice? Oh, my goodness. Alice? I do not remember anything. We had an accident. Henry? Can you keep an eye on Grace for a little while? She is awake now. I have to get some medicine to help her. Dear, I have to go get something from my room. Oh, no! What is wrong, friend? What do you have in the fridge? Be quiet. What is in there? What is in there? What do you have in there? Be quiet. What is it, huh? Be quiet. You can tell me. I am good at keeping secrets. I have a big one myself. What are you doing? Bad person! What are you doing out here? Getting my things. What are you doing? What, I do not get to ask a question? I am taking pictures. There were two bad events. Before all the proof... That is not an answer. You drive a car that takes people places. What are you doing? Looking to win some \"beyond the call of duty,\" car driver award? You are not working anymore. You do not need to be brave. There is a real, working officer outside... The one who managed to lose a bad person? You are a complicated cat, David. No. Not really. I think so. What month were you born? May. Same as me. \"Where were you a cop?\" \"NE city.\" \"Were you fired or did you quit?\" \"I took medical leave.\" \"It was making me sick.\" \"I burned out, I guess.\" \"Wasn't up for it.\" \"One day I got a call for a jumper.\" \"A young person.\" \"Pregnant, sick, addicted.\" \"They were truly not well.\" \"I asked them to come in off the ledge and into my arms.\" \"They asked me why they should bother living.\" \"What did you say?\" \"I was trained to tell them lots of things.\" \"Their dreams, all the people who'd miss them.\" \"But for a second, I hesitated.\" \"And they saw it.\" \"Within that second, I couldn't think of one optimistic thing to say to them.\" \"So they jumped.\" \"I started getting headaches and eventually started blacking out.\" \"So I filed for medical. What? What is it? Samuel! It's worse. Nothing but noise! Where's that key from the person? This was on the child. What is it, some kind of countdown? Oliver! What is he doing? Oliver, come over here! Come over here, man. What are you doing? Come over here. What are you doing? I just went to get something. We told you to watch the person. What are you doing in your room? I just went to get something. How many keys are there to this place? Look at me. How many? Two and a master set. Oh, no! Oliver, you...! Get in here! Why did you hurt them? Why did you hurt my person? Who did that? I didn't do that! Not true! You're lying! It's your object sticking out of their throat! I know, but I didn't do it! Check the doors! I didn't do it! Look at them! Why'd you hurt them? Why were you outside? Why'd you leave them? I was scared. What were you scared of? You wouldn't understand. Try me. Why'd you hurt my person? I didn't! I don't know how... I went to my room, that's all! \"What do you want, you bad person?\" \"What do you want from us?\" \"I am turning 30 next week and I just want to go home and grow fruit!\" \"It's your birthday next week?\" \"It's my birthday next week.\" \"The 10th.\" \"Me too.\"\"Me too.\" \"Me too.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Adam, May 10.\" \"Alice, May 10.\" \"Charlotte, May 10.\" \"Grace and Lily, May 10.\" \"Me, Matthew, May 10.\" \"What are the odds?\" \"It is very rare.\" \"What is it?\" \"Where is the fuse box, Matthew?\" \"Other side of the building.

All right. I was driving this worker and we got stuck at the hotel. There was a storm. We couldn't get out because of the storm. What happened at the hotel? People started dying.

They had a very troubled life. They were arrested years ago and charged with hurting six people. They did this. Please. Edward, listen to me. When faced with a trauma, a child's mind may break into different personalities. That's exactly what happened to the troubled person.

Because you, Edward, are one of their personalities. \"What?\" \"Oh my!\" \"What did you do to my face?\" \"Stay calm.\" \"Where is my face?\" \"This is your face.\" \"Why am I tied up?\" \"Stay calm.\" \"Where is...?\" \"Please.\" \"Oh my!\" \"Where is my face?\" \"Stay calm.\" \"No!\" \"I will not stay calm!\" \"Why am I tied up like this?\" \"Who are all these people?\" \"What happened at the inn?\" \"Where is everybody?\" \"They do not exist, Adam.\" \"You were all made up by Benjamin as a child.\" \"You are a liar!\" \"Think about what you know.

You're absolutely right. These maps look good. Information about the bad areas is right, it should be easy for us to avoid them. Looks like the old lady actually did a good job. Don't I get any credit? What for? Look closely at that. Read me the amount. One hundred coins. It's really only a twelfth of that. I added the extra number. Fine work, don't you think?

I really don't see how that helps.\"\nAdam said, \"Still not angry?\"\nEmma said, \"No, I'm not. I should be, but I'm not.

The mean part in them is growing stronger... taking over the nice part. I must stop them. Keep them from hurting us. No! They will not hurt us. I know them. You know only their nice side. Kill it now. First we must find its round things. Kill it now! Forgive me, Cameron. No! The robots last saw Alice in the brain place... but they cannot find her home of round energy things. So, we are in trouble. Would you stop talking like that? Well, we cannot be like this... we have.. we have to focus. All right, I say we team up. We start in the brain place and we search every level ourselves. And we will either find the round things, or we will find what took them. Or, maybe we could ask Alice to give back the round energy things. Let's ask her with a big gun. Come on. Hang on a second. I am... dizzy. You know what the worst part of this is? You and me. We never could get it together. Now we never will. Do not ever talk like that! Come on. Captain Charlie! The ship's engines are starting up. It must be Alice. I cannot close the outer doors in time. David was a brave boy. He lived with his friends in a big house. One day, a bad lady took away some important things from the house. David's friends tried to stop her, but they could not.\n\nDavid's friend Ethan said, \"We need to get those important things back.\" David had an idea. He said, \"Let's follow the bad lady and see where she hides the important things.\"\n\nDavid and his friends made a plan. They would use their other friend Zachary to trick the bad lady. Zachary pretended to be asleep. The bad lady came to take something from Zachary. But it was a trick! David and his friends followed the bad lady to find the important things she had taken.\n\nIn the end, David and his friends got the important things back from the bad lady. They were all very happy and brave. \"Well, she's strong enough to help, I'm sure.\" \"David!\" \"We may not be hurt yet.\" \"Well, sounds like you're almost back to your old self.\" \"We should, uh... we should be back to you within a short time.\" \"Here, swallow this.\" \"Wake up...\" \"Samuel.\" \"We need you.\" \"You don't want to hurt me, Samuel.\" \"I'm... friend.\" \"Si.. ko.. zu?\" \"Yes...\" \"Samuel.\" \"Insect...\" \"Kill it.\" \"Yes, Samuel.\" \"It's time to kill it.\" \"Help.\" \"What's your hurry, old one?\" \"Keep away from me.\" \"I don't want you.\" \"You're old... and mean.\" \"You know who I do want.\" \"Where is he?\" \"I don't know anything.\" \"Liar! You know where he is. Samuel. Tell me or you die.\" \"If I don't tell you, you die. You need his energy when you're hungry and you can't find him.\" \"Come! I sense him. Close.\" Patrick? The insect is harvesting Samuel. Stay with them, if you can. Found it. Tier seven, the cargo bay. I'm never gonna make it. I know you can see me. The bad guys always see me. Cause my plans are bad. People die. It's always a mess. Patrick... Yah, that's me. The silly one. I help someone and they hurt me. I have no regret. You are food and I eat.\" \"There's always an excuse, lady. Are the others coming to ah... attack?\" \"Oh, I don't... I don't think so. It's just... you and me.\" I was planning on, uh... grabbing those things there, but I guess you're not gonna let me do that, are ya?\" \"I'm tired. Let's... why don't we just... end it? Come on... I'm tired. I'm tired of worrying. I'm tired of fighting. Just... bring it on, end it now.\" \"Do you want me to kill you?\" \"Yes, please. Fast, slow... lady's choice.\" \"I like it slow.\" \"Oh, god. I was afraid you were gonna say that. \"Look what it has done to you.\" \"You are very scared.\" \"Airplane pilot?\" \"Do we have a problem talking?\" \"I was just looking at them.\" \"Some small things are different, but they seem to work normally.\" \"S... so, it is done.\" \"It is done.\" \"There is nothing more between us.\" \"Nothing.\"", "hash": "5462b4583e6d93638b6242a20e1079074301e68b6e6556c6ec3f423a25d99cf5"}
{"text": "Wow. Mmm. Wow. Mm-hmm. Wow. Yes, Matthew. No, I see it. It's beautiful. So, Emma, when you said you wanted an ocean view... you didn't think you'd get the whole ocean, did you? Oh, yeah. A fish can breathe out here. Did your man deliver, or did he deliver? My man delivered. And it wasn't so easy. Because a lot of other clownfish had their eyes on this place. You better believe they did... every single one of them. Mm-hmm. You did good. And the neighborhood is awesome. So, you do like it, don't you? No, no. I do, I do. I really do like it. But, Matthew, I know that the drop off is desirable... with the great schools and the amazing view... but do we really need so much space? Coral, honey, these are our kids we're talking about. They deserve the best. Look, look, look. They'll wake up, poke their little heads out... and they see a whale! Right by their bedroom window. Shh. You'll wake the kids. Oh, right, right. Aw, look. They're dreaming. We still have to name them. You want to name all of them right now? All right, we'll name this half Matthew Junior... and this half Emma Junior. OK, we're done. I like Xavier. Xavier. We'll name one Xavier... but I'd like most of them to be Matthew Junior. Just think, in a couple of days... we're going to be parents. Yeah. What if they don't like me? Matthew. No, really. There's over 400 eggs. Odds are, one will like you. What? You remember how we met? I try not to. Well, I remember. Excuse me, miss... can you check and see if I have a hook in my lip? You got a little closer because it was wiggling. Get away, get away! Here he is. Cutie's here. Where did everybody go? Emma, get inside the house. \"No, Charlotte, don't.\" \"They'll be fine.\" \"Just get inside...\" \"You, right now.\" \"No!\" \"Ow!\" \"Oh!\" \"Ooh!\" \"Ooh!\" \"Ooh!\" \"Charlotte!\" \"Charlotte?\" \"Charlotte?\" \"Charlotte?\" \"Charlotte?\" \"Charlotte?\" \"Charlotte?\" \"Charlotte?\" \"Charlotte?\" \"Charlotte?\" \"Oh!\" \"Ohh.\" \"There, there, there.\" \"It's OK. \"Father's here.\" \"Father's got you.\" \"I promise, I will never let anything bad happen to you...\" Nathan. First day of school! Wake up, wake up! First day of school. I don't want to go to school... five more minutes. Not you, Father, me. OK. Huh? Get up, get up. It's time for school, time for school. All right, I'm up. Whoa! Nathan! First day of school! Nathan, don't move. Unh! Unh! You'll never get out of there yourself. I'll do it. Unh! You feel a break? No. Sometimes you can't tell 'cause water rushes to the area. Are you dizzy? No. How many stripes do I have? I'm fine. Answer the stripe question. Three. No! See? Something's wrong with you. I have one, two, three... That's all I have? You're OK. How's the lucky fin? Lucky. Let's see. Are you sure you want to go to school this year? There's no problem if you don't. You can wait 5 or 6 years. Come on, Father, it's time for school. Forgot to brush. Ohh. Do you want this plant to sting you? Yes. Brush. OK, I'm done. You missed a spot. Where? There. Where? There. Ha ha! Right there. And here and here. All right, we're excited. All right, we're excited. The first day of school. Here we go. We're ready to learn to get some knowledge. What's the one thing we have to remember about the ocean? It's not safe. That's my boy. First, we check to see that the coast is clear. We go out... and back in. Adam and Benjamin went to school. Adam wondered if he would see a big fish. Benjamin said he doubted it. Adam asked how old turtles live. Benjamin did not know.\n\nAdam said Samuel from next door said turtles live to be about 100 years old. If Adam ever met a turtle, he would ask it. After talking to a big fish first, Adam said.\n\nThey waited to cross the street. Benjamin held Adam's hand.\n\nAdam asked Benjamin if he would act strangely, like at the petting zoo. Benjamin said the snail was going to charge.\n\nThey wondered where to go. Adam said goodbye to his mother. She would pick him up after school.\n\nSome other children teased Adam and took something from him. They tried elsewhere.\n\nBenjamin asked if this was where they met Adam's teacher. Kevin saw Benjamin and was shocked he was out. Kevin greeted Benjamin.\n\nKevin mixed up Benjamin's name. He asked if Benjamin, as a clownfish, was funny. He asked Benjamin to tell a joke. Benjamin explained clownfish are not funnier than other fish.\n\nThe other children insisted Benjamin be funny. Benjamin started a joke but got mixed up. Then Thomas yelled at Henry to get out of Mr. Johannsen's yard. The other children scattered. \"Ooh, where'd you go?\" \"Father, can I go play, too?\" \"Can I?\" \"I would feel better if you'd play on the soft beds.\" \"That's where I would play.\" \"What's wrong with his fin?\" \"He looks funny.\" \"Ow!\" \"Hey, what'd I do?\" \"Be nice.\" \"It's his first time at school.\" \"He was born with it.\" \"We call it his lucky fin.\" \"Father...\" \"See this tentacle? It's actually shorter than all my other tentacles... but you can't really tell, especially when I twirl them like this. I'm water sick. Ah-choo! I'm loud. Oh.\n\nLet's name the places, the places, the places. Let's name the places of the open sea. Mr. Teacher! Come on, Nemo. You better stay with me.\n\nDeep, deep, really deep. All the rest are too deep for you and me to see.\n\nHuh. I wonder where my class has gone? We're under here! Oh, there you are. Come here, learners.\n\nOh, learning is so fun when you think simple thoughts. \n\nFather, you can go now. Hello. Who is this? I'm Nemo. Nemo, all new learners must answer a question. OK. You live in what kind of home? I don't know. OK, don't worry. Welcome, learners. Just so you know, he has a little fin. I find if he's having trouble swimming... I let him take a break for a little time.\n\nFather, it's time for you to go now. Don't worry. We're gonna stay together. OK, class, eyes up front. And remember, we keep quiet. That means you, boy. \n\nAw, man! Aw, man! Bye, Nemo! Bye, Father! Bye, son! Be safe.\n\nYou're doing pretty well for your first time. You can't hold on to them forever, can you? I had a tough time with my oldest out at the deep end. They have to grow up... The deep end? \"No.\" \"No, it is away.\" \"It is away.\" \"No, no, it cannot be away.\" \"No, no!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"No!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"No!\" \"No, please, no!\" \"No, no!\" \"Has anybody seen a small ship?\" \"Please!\" A white small ship!\" \"They took my child!\" My child! Help me, please.\" \"Look out!\" What? Oh. Oh. Oh. Sorry. I did not see you. Sir? Are you OK? It is away, it is away. There, there. It is all right. It is away. It will be OK. No, no. They took it away. I have to find the small ship. A small ship? Hey, I have seen a small ship. You have? A white one? Hi. I am Dory. Where? Which way? Oh, oh, oh. It went this way. It went this way. It went this way. Follow me. Thank you. Thank you, thank you so much. No problem. Hey... Wait! Will you quit it? What? I am trying to swim here. The big water is not big enough for you? You have a problem, friend? Huh? Huh? Huh? You have a problem, friend? Huh? Huh? Do you? Do you? Do you? You want a piece of me? Ooh, I am scared now. What? Wait a minute. Stop following me, OK? What? You are showing me where the small ship went. A small ship? Hey, I have seen a small ship. It passed by not too long ago. It went this way. It went this way. It went this way. Follow me. Wait a minute. What is going on? You already told me which way the small ship was going. I did? Oh, no. If this is some kind of funny joke, it is not funny. And I know funny. I am a small fish. No, it is not. I know it is not. I am so sorry. \"Look, I forget things very fast.\" \"I forget things very fast.\" \"That does not seem right.\" \"No, it is true.\" \"I forget almost right away.\" \"Others in my family are the same.\" \"At least, I think so.\" \"Hmm.\" \"Where are they?\" \"Can I help you?\" \"Something is wrong with you... really.\" \"You are wasting my time.\" \"I have to find my child.\" \"Hello.\" \"Oh.\" Well, hi! My name is Benjamin. It is okay. I understand. Why trust a shark, right? So, what are two young ones like you doing out so late? We are not doing anything. We are not even out. Great! Then how would you young ones like to come to a small party I am having? You mean, like a fun time? Yes, right. A fun time. What do you say? I love fun times. That sounds fun. Fun times are fun, and it is tempting, but... Oh, come on, I insist. OK. That is all that matters. Hey, look, round things. It is a fun time. Ha ha ha ha! Mind your space, though. Those round things can be a bit tricky. You would not want one of them to pop. Oh. Oh. Heavy thing! Food! There you are, Benjamin. Finally. We have visitors. It is about time, friend. We have already had the small snacks and I am still hungry. We almost had a feeding frenzy. Come on, let us get this done quickly. Right, then. The meeting has officially started. Let us all say the pledge. I am a nice shark, not a mindless eating machine. If I am to change this image I must first change myself. Fish are friends, not food. Except stinkin' dolphins. Dolphins. Yeah. They think they are so cute. \"Look at me. I am a flippin' little dolphin. Let me flip for you. Ain't I something?\" Right, then. Today's meeting is Step 5: Bring a Fish Friend. Do you all have your friends? Got mine. Hey, there. \"Do you want one, Friend?\" \"Oh, I... seem to have lost my friend.\" \"That's OK, Friend.\" \"I had a feeling this would be a hard thing.\" \"You can have one of my friends.\" \"Thanks, pal.\" \"A little friend for Friend, eh?\" \"I'll start the talks.\"\n\n\"Hello.\" \"My name is Benjamin.\" \"Hello, Benjamin.\" \"It has been three weeks since I last ate a fish.\" \"On my word, or may I be made into soup.\"\n\n\"You are an example!\" \"Yes.\" \"Who's next?\" \"Pick me, pick me.\" \"Yes. The little girl in the front.\" \"Whoo! Come on up here.\"\n\n\"Hi. I'm Diana. And, uh, well... I don't think I've ever eaten a fish.\" \"That's great.\" \"Good for you, pal.\" \"I'm glad I got that off my chest.\"\n\n\"All right, anyone else? How about you, pal? What's your problem?\" \"Me? I don't have a problem.\" \"OK. Denial.\"\n\n\"OK. Uh, hello. My name is Matthew. I'm a clownfish.\" \"A clownfish? Really? Tell us a joke. I love jokes.\"\n\n\"I actually do know one that's pretty good. There was this mollusk... and he walks up to a sea cucumber. Normally, they don't talk, sea cucumbers... but in a joke, everyone talks... so the mollusk says to the cucumber...\"\n\n\"Daddy!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Ha ha! Nemo!\" \"I don't get it. For a clownfish, he's not that funny.\"\n\n\"No, no, no, no. He's my son. He was taken by these divers.\" \"Oh, my. You poor fish. Humans think they own everything. There is a father looking for his little boy.\"\n\n\"What do these marks mean? I never knew my father!\" \"Group hug. We're all friends here, friend. I can't read human. We have to find a fish that can read this.\" \"Hey, look, sharks.\" \"Prepare for the procedure, please?\" \"And I will need some more cotton.\" \"OK.\" \"Hello, little one.\" \"Aah!\" \"He is beautiful, isn't he?\" \"I found this little one struggling in the ocean, and I saved him.\" \"Has the medicine started working yet?\" \"I think so.\" \"We're ready to start.\" \"Bubbles!\" \"He likes bubbles.\" \"Aah!\" \"Ohh!\" \"No! Uhh! Bonjour. Aah! Slow down, little one. There's no need to worry. He's very scared. I want to go home. Do you know where my family is? Your family is probably back in the ocean. Ocean? Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! He hasn't been cleaned yet. Clean him! Yes. Ocean. The big sea. Good. He is clean now. Wow. The big blue ocean. What's it like? Big and blue? I knew it. If you need anything, just ask me. Or if I'm not around, you can talk to my sibling. Hi. How are you? Don't listen to them. They are silly. Ha ha ha! We have a new little one. I can't hear you. I said we have a new little one. Oh boy. What do we have? A procedure, and based on these pictures, it won't be easy. Ow! Are the tools ready? Yes. What tool did the doctor use to start? Their favorite tool. I can't see clearly. You're getting too close... Aah! Now the doctor is using a different technique. The doctor is using a special tool. Adam was a small fish. One day, Benjamin opened Adam's mouth. \"Oh, the mouth is a dirty place,\" said Benjamin. \"What did I miss?\" asked Cameron. \"A big job,\" said David. \"What did he use?\" asked Ethan. \"A special tool,\" said Frank. \"Hello! Who's this?\" asked Gabriel. \"The new guy,\" said Henry. \"He's from the NE city,\" said Isaac. \"Sorry if I bit you,\" said Jack. \"Birds have to eat,\" said Kevin. \"No, no! They're my fish!\" said Liam. Liam had a niece named Madison. She was going to be eight soon. \"She'll pick you up. You're her gift,\" Liam told Adam. But Adam didn't want to go. He wanted to stay with his dad. \"Daddy! Help me!\" cried Adam. But Adam got stuck. \"You got in there. You get out,\" said the other fish. Adam tried wiggling his fins and tail, but he couldn't get out. \"I have a bad fin.\" \"That never stopped me.\" \"Just think about what you need to do.\" \"Come on.\" \"Perfect.\" \" Yay!\" \" You did it!\" \"Good moving.\" \"Ha ha ha!\" \"Wow.\" \"From the ocean...\" \"just like you, Jack.\" \"Yeah.\" \"I've seen that look before.\" \"What are you thinking about?\" \"I'm thinking... tonight, we give the child a proper welcome.\" \"So, child, you got a name or what?\" \"Xavier.\" \"I'm Xavier.\" \"Xavier.\" \"Xavier.\" \"Are you gonna eat that?\" \" Careful with that tool.\" \" Huh?\" \"No, no.\" \"What does it say?\" \"Emma! A small sea animal has my money. Wake up. Get up. Come on. Come on!\" \" Yes, I am a natural color.\" \" Get up! Look out! Big fish eat small fish! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Wow. Dusty. The covering. Where's the covering? No! No, not the covering! Get it! Get the covering! Get the covering! Get it! Music sounds. Whoo-hoo! Music sounds. It just keeps going on, doesn't it? Echo! Echo! Echo! Hey, what you doing? It's gone. I've lost the covering. Did you drop it? You dropped it! That was my only chance of finding my child. Now it's gone. Hey, Mr. Grumpy Face... when life gets you down, know what you got to do? I don't want to know. Just keep moving. Just keep moving, moving, moving. What do we do? We move, move. Emma, no singing. Ho ho ho ho ho ho. I love to move. When you want to move. See, I'm going to get stuck now with that song. Now it's in my head. Sorry. Emma, do you see anything? Aah! Something's got me. That was me. I'm sorry. Who's that? Who could it be? It's me. Are you my inner voice? Yeah, yeah. A child said \"We did it!\" \"No eating here tonight.\"\nAnother child said \"What did the mask say?\" \nThe first child remembered \"P. Sherman, 42 WA Way, SY city.\"\nThe second child said \"I don't know where that is. But who cares? I remembered.\"\nA shark said \"Follow me\" in a strange language.\nThe shark sang a funny song.\nThe shark asked the child to state their name. The child said \"Nemo.\"\nThe shark said \"Nemo, you have been called to join our club. If you can swim through the Ring of Fire!\"\nThe other sharks turned on the Ring of Fire. Nemo was worried if there was another way, since he was just a child.\nThe shark gave Nemo a new name \"Sharkbait\" and welcomed him to their club. \"What is wrong?\" \"Hey, what is wrong?\" \"What is wrong?\" \"While they are doing their silly little actions...\" \"I am far from home with a fish that cannot remember her name!\" \"I bet that is frustrating.\" \"Meanwhile, my child is out there.\" \"Your child Cameron?\" \"Nora?\" \"But it does not matter because no fish... in this whole ocean is going to help me.\" \"Well, I am helping you.\" \"Wait right here.\" \"Friends! Is he bothering you again?\" \"No, no. He is a good person. Go easy on him. He has lost his child Fiona.\" \"Any of you heard of P.S, XX City, SY country?\" \"SY country? Oh, sure! Thomas here has relatives in SY country. Don't you, Thomas?\" \"Sure do!\" \"Oh! Hey! They know SY country! You would not know how to get there, would you?\" \"You want to follow the E.A.C. That is the East AU country Current. Big current. Cannot miss it. It is in... that direction.\" \"And then you follow that for about...\" \"I do not know. What do you all think? About three long distances?\" \"That little baby will put you right past SY country.\" \"Ta-da!\" \"That's great! Dory, you did it!\" \"Oh, please, I'm just your little helper. Helping along. That's me.\" \"Friends, thank you.\" \"Don't mention it! Just loosen up, OK, buddy?\" \"Oh, you all. You really nailed him.\" \"Bye. Oh, hey, ma'am. One more thing. When you come to this deep hole, swim through it, not over it.\" \"Deep hole... through it, not over it. I'll remember.\" \"Hey, hey! Hey, wait up, partner! Hold on! Wait, wait, wait! I gotta tell you something.\" \"Whoa. Nice deep hole.\" \"Hello! OK, let's go.\" \"No, no. Bad deep hole. Come on, we'll swim over this thing.\" \"Whoa, partner. Little red flag going up. Something's telling me to swim through it, not over it. Are you looking at this thing? It has death written all over it.\" \"Whee!\" \"Stop, Emma!\" \"Gotta go faster if you want to win!\" \"Gotta go faster if you want to win!\" \"Gotta go faster if you want to win!\" \"Whoa!\" \"Emma!\" \"Boing, boing, boing!\" \"Wait a minute!\" \"Whoa!\" \"Emma!\" \"Whee!\" \"We're having fun now.\" \"That's what we're doing.\" \"But we're having fun at the same time.\" \"I can do this.\" \"Just be careful.\" \"Yeah, careful I don't make you laugh when I win!\" \"I don't think so!\" \"Ha ha ha ha!\" \"Whoa!\" \"Give it up, friend. You can't beat me.\" I was made for speed.\" The question is, Emma, are you hungry?\" \"Hungry?\" \"Yeah. 'Cause you're about to eat my bubbles!\" \"Duck to the left!\" \"Right there!\" \"The fish is the winner!\" \"Whoo-hoo!\" \"We did it!\" Look at us!\" Emma? Oh, no. Emma!\" \"Emma!\" \"Emma!\" \"Emma!\" \"Emma!\" \"Emma!\" \"Emma! Ohh! Am I out?\" No, you're doing fine! You're actually winning! But you gotta stay awake. Where does friend live? Friend... NE city... That's it! Uhh! NE city... Uhh! Stay awake! Stay awake! Ooh! Stay awake! Stay... awake! Awake. Friend. Awake. Number street. Wake up. friend... Wake up. friend... You miss your dad, don't you, friend? Yeah. Yeah. You're lucky to have someone out there looking for you. Friend is not looking for me. Friend is scared of the sea. Any movement? Friend had a drink. It's gotta be soon. Keep watching. My first escape... landed on tools. I was aiming for the toilet. Toilet? All drains lead to the sea, kid. Wow. How many times have you tried to get out? Ah, I've lost count. Fish aren't meant to be in a box, kid. It does things to you. \"Bubbles!\" \"Bubbles!\" \"Bubbles!\" \"Potty break!\" \"Xavier grabbed a book.\" \"We have some time left!\" \"That's your turn, Samuel.\" \"You can do it, kid.\" \"We need to be quick.\" \"Once you get in, swim to the bottom of the place...\" \"Once you get in, swim to the bottom of the place... and I'll help you with the rest.\" \"OK.\" \"It'll be easy.\" \"Well done!\" \"Can you hear me?\" \"Yes!\" \"Here comes a small stone.\" \"Now, do you see a small opening?\" \"Yes!\" \"Inside it, you'll see a moving fan. Put that stone into the fan to stop it moving.\" \"Careful, Samuel!\" \"I can't do it!\" \"Gabriel, this isn't a good idea.\" \"He'll be fine. Try again!\" \"OK. That's it, Samuel. Nice and steady.\" \"I got it!\" \"I got it!\" \"I got it!\" \"He did it!\" \"That's great, kid! Now swim up the tube and out.\" \"Oh, no! Gabriel! Samuel!\" \"Oh, my goodness! Get him out of there!\" \"What do we do?\" \"Oh, no! Stay calm, kid. Just don't panic!\" \"Help me! Samuel, grab hold of this!\" \"No! No!\" \"Feed me more!\" \"That's it! Samuel! Grab it! I got it! Pull! Gabriel, don't make him go back in there. No. We're done. Friend. Friend. Focus, friend. Friend. Oh, he's okay. Hey, friend! Oh. What happened? I saw the whole thing, friend. First, you were like, \"Whoa!\"... and then we were like, \"Whoa!\"... and then you were like, \"Whoa.\" What are you talking about? You, little one. Taking on the jellies. You got serious excitement issues, friend. Oh. Awesome. Oh, my stomach. Oh! \"Now it's my turn,\" said Charlotte. \"I'm thinking of something dark and mysterious.\" \"It's an animal we don't know,\" said David. \"If we ask it for directions... it could eat us and spit out our bones!\" \"What is it with boys and asking for directions?\" said Charlotte. \"I don't want to bring up gender right now,\" said David. \"Let's focus on staying safe,\" said Charlotte. \"You want to get out of here?\" \"Of course I do,\" said Charlotte. \"How are we going to do that unless we try?\" \"Emma, you don't fully understand...\" \"Come on,\" said Emma. \"Trust me on this.\" \"Alright,\" said David. \"Excuse me!\" called Emma. \"Hello there!\" \"Don't be rude, say hi,\" said Emma. \"Hello!\" said David. \n\nEmma's son Jack... was taken to the SY city. And it's really, really important... that we get there as fast as we can... so can you help us? asked Emma. Come on, animal. Come on. \"Emma, I'm a little one,\" said David. \"I don't think that's a little one,\" said Emma. Oh! Big animal. Whale. OK. Maybe it only speaks whale language. Emma made whale sounds. \"Emma?\" said David. \"To find his son.\" \"What are you doing?\" asked David. \"Are you sure you speak whale?\" \"Can you give us directions?\" asked Emma again in whale sounds. \"Emma! Heaven knows what you're saying!\" said David. \"See, it's swimming away.\" \"Come back,\" called Emma. \"It's not coming back,\" said David. \"You offended it.\" \"Maybe a different whale sound,\" said Emma, making more sounds. \"Emma! This is not whale. You're making sick sounds,\" said David. \"Maybe I should try a different whale sound.\" \"Don't,\" said David. Emma tried another whale sound. \"You actually sound sick,\" said David. \"Maybe louder?\" said Emma, making very loud whale sounds. \"Don't do that!\" said David. \"Too much orca. It doesn't sound like an orca at all.\" \"It's just as well,\" said David. \"It might be hungry.\" \"Hello! Hello! Hello!\" \"Hey... are you OK?\" \"There, there.\" \"It's all right.\" \"It will be OK.\" \"No.\" \"No, it won't.\" \"Sure it will.\" \"You'll see.\" \"No.\" \"I promised them I'd never let anything bad happen to them.\" \"Huh.\" \"That's a funny thing to promise.\" \"What?\" \"You can't never let anything bad happen to them.\" \"Then nothing bad would ever happen to them.\" \"Not much fun for little Adam.\" \" Hmm.\" \" What's going on?\" \"Don't know. I'll ask them.\" \" Emma...\" \" Whaaaaat's gooooing ooooon?\" \"I think they say we've stopped. Of course we've stopped. Stop trying to speak animal. You'll make things worse. What is that noise? Oh, no. Look what you did. The water is going down. It's going down! Really? You sure about that? Look! Already it's almost empty! I'd say it's almost full. Stop that! It's almost empty! OK, that one was a little hard. They either said we should go to the back of the mouth... or they want a sweet drink. Of course they want us to go there! That's eating us! How do I taste, big animal? Do I taste good? Tell them I'm not interested in being food! \" OK.\" Heeee...\" Stop talking to them! \" Aah!\" Aah!\" What is going on? I'll check. Whaaaaat... No more animal! You can't speak animal! \" Yes, I can!\" No, you can't! You think you can do these things, but you can't, Adam! \" OK.\" Emma! Oof! They say it's time to let go. Everything's gonna be all right. How do you know? How do you know something bad isn't gonna happen? I don't! \" Aah!\" Aah!\" Aah!\" Aah!\" Aah!\" Aah!\" Aah!\" Aah!\" Aah!\" Aah!\" Aah!\" Ha ha ha! We're alive! Look! SY city... SY city! SY city again! You were right, Emma! \"We made it!\" \"We will find my child!\" \"Thank you, sir!\" \"Thank you, sir!\" \"Thank you, sir!\" \"Wow.\" \"I wish I could talk to big animals.\" \"We just need to find the boat that took my child.\" \"Right!\" \"We can do this!\" \"It is morning now.\" \"It is morning, everyone!\" \"This is the day!\" \"The sun is shining, the tank is clean... and we are getting out...\" \"The tank is clean.\" \"The tank is clean!\" \"But how?\" \"The leader must have put it in while we were sleeping.\" \"What are we going to do?\" \"What does it say, Penelope?\" \"I cannot hear you, Penelope.\" \"The cleaning machine is a tool to keep the water clean... It will work by itself and keep the water good... It promises to help the fish live longer.\" \"Stop it!\" \"The cleaning machine will check the tank every few minutes?\" What does that mean?\" \"Oh no! The temperature is good... The water condition is good.\" \"Nice.\" Oh no...\" \"Curse you, cleaning machine! Our plan to escape is ruined. Then what are we going to do about... Diana!\" \"Stay down, kid! It was nothing bad.\" Whew. I cannot take more of this. What will we do when that bad child comes? I am thinking. Oh! Xavier! Liam! Help me! Help me! Swim down! Come on, kid! Everyone jump in! Swim down! That's it! Yay! Good work! Xavier! Liam! Well done! Roll, kid! Move to the side! Whoops. That would have been bad. Xavier! Do not let me turn over! Just calm down, Liam. You will not turn over. I promise. You will be OK. Diana! Do any of these boats look like the one you were in? No, but the boat has to be here somewhere. Come on, Emma. We are going to find it. I am so excited. \"Are you excited?\" \"Diana, wake up.\" \"Wake up, come on.\" \"Duck!\" \"That's not a duck.\" \"It's a... bird!\" \" Whoa!\" \" Aah!\" \" Whoa!\" \" Aah!\" \"No!\" \"I didn't come this far to be food!\" \"Hey, Nigel.\" \"Would you look at that?\" \"What?\" \"What?\" \"What?\" \"Early in the morning and Gabriel's had more than he can handle. Yeah. I think somebody ought to help the poor guy. Yeah, right. Yeah. Don't everybody fly off at once. All right, Gabriel. Animal got your tongue? Aah! Love a bird! Aah! Love a bird! I gotta find my child Nemo! Nemo? He's that fish! The one that's been fighting the whole ocean! I know where your child... Huh? Wait! Come back! Stop! Diana, keep going! He's crazy! I got something to tell you! Mine. Don't make any sudden moves. Hop inside my mouth if you want to live. Hop in your mouth? How does that make me live? Mine? Because I can take you to your child. Because I can take you to your child. Because I can take you to your child. Yeah, right. No. I know your child. He's orange with a fin problem on one side. That's Nemo! Aah! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Ha ha ha ha! Aah! Everybody hold on! Aah! Aah! Aah! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Too loud! Too loud for me! Song words Song words Find a happy place! Find a happy place! Find a happy place! Emma, your uncle will see you now. All right, let's see those teeth. Raah! I'm a fish. They're in a river. And a fish is an animal, just like your gift. I get fish, fish. Oh, no. A small fish said, \"Hey, wait. Where are you going?\" \nAnother fish replied, \"It's over, Emma. We were too late. Liam's gone, and I'm going home now.\"\n\"No, you can't,\" the first fish said. \"Stop! Please don't go away. Please? No one's ever stuck with me for so long. And if you leave, I just...I remember things better with you. I remember a famous place. It's there. I know it because when I look at you...I can feel it. I look at you and I'm home. Please...I don't want to forget.\"\n\nTwo birds said, \"Sweet food of life!\" \nA third bird shouted, \"Hey! Hey! Hey! This is our spot! Get out of here!\"\nThe second bird said, \"That's it, keep swimming. You got that.\" \n\nA small fish said, \"Hey! Come back here! You let him go! Hey! Dad! Dad! Dad!\"\nA larger fish replied, \"I don't know where I am or what's going on. I lost somebody but can't remember.\"\nThe small fish said, \"I'm looking for someone too. We can look together. I'm Emma.\"\nThe larger fish replied, \"Emma? That's a nice name. I'm Liam.\"\n\"Liam!\" Emma shouted. \"It's you! You're Liam! Yes, I'm Emma! You're Liam!\" \"You were gone.\" \"I saw you.\" \"And here you are!\" \"I found you.\" \"You're not gone.\" \"And your dad...\" \"Your dad!\" \"You know my dad?\" \"!\" \"Where is he?\" \"This way!\" \"He went this way.\" \"Quick!\" \"Hey, hey, hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"Have you seen an orange fish swim by?\" \"It looks just like him!

Dory! Dad, I know what to do! Nemo! No! We have to tell all the fish to swim down together! Get out of there now! I know this will work! No, I am not gonna lose you again! There's no time! It's the only way to save Dory! I can do this. You're right. I know you can. Lucky fin! Now, go! Hurry! Tell all the fish to swim down! Well? You heard my son! Come on! Dory, you have to tell everybody to... Swim down together! Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Swim down! Everybody swim down! Come on, you have to swim down! Down! Swim down!Let's go down!

Oh, no, no, no. I'm so sorry, Nemo. Hey, guess what? What? Sea turtles... I met one. And he was very old. Very old? Yes. A person said they only live to be a certain age. That person? Do you think I would cross the entire ocean... and not know as much as that person? Ha ha ha! He was very old! Not that age! Who is this person who knows everything? Time for school! Get up! Let's go! Time for school! Get up! Let's go! I'm gonna win! No, you're not! I did it! Aw, my own child beats me! Climb aboard, explorers. The sea creature looks over to the other creature and says... \"With these, who needs those?\" Hello, Nemo. Who's this? A new student. I'm from a place, dude! Sweet! Totally. Seriously, friend. Did you really do all the things you say you did? Pardon me. Hello. Don't be alarmed. We wanted to make sure our newest member got home safely. Thanks, group. See you next week. Keep up with the program. Remember, fish are friends... Not food! Bye! Hold on, here we go! Next stop... learning! \"Bye, Nathan!\" \"Have fun!\" \"Bye, Patrick!\" \"Oh!\" \"Mr. Adam, wait.\" \"I forgot something.\" \"Love you, Patrick.\" \"I love you, too, Nathan.\" \"Patrick?\" \"You can let go now.\" \"Sorry.\" \"Go have an adventure.\" \"Good-bye!\" \"See ya later, friends!\" \" Bye, Liam!\" \" Cameron.\" \" Bye, Cameron!\" \" See you after school, Grace!\" \"Bye, Patrick!\" \"Bye, Patrick!\" \"Bye, Nathan.\" \"Jessica, I don't understand it.\" \"Here this thing has a lifetime promise... and it breaks!\" \"I had to clean the tank myself, take all the pets out... put 'em in bags, and...\" \"Where'd the pets go?\" \"Come on, Fiona!\" Hurry! You can do it! That's it. Just a little further. That's the shortest green light I've ever seen! Come on, Fiona! Ohh. Aah! Now what? Somewhere beyond the NE city, somewhere waiting for me, my loved one stands on yellow sands and watches the ships that go sailing. Somewhere beyond the NE city, she's there watching for me. If I could fly like birds up high, then straight to her arms I'll go sailing. It's far beyond the stars, it's near beyond the moon. I know beyond a doubt, my heart will lead me there soon. We'll meet beyond the shore, we'll kiss just like before. Happy we'll be beyond the NE city, and never again I'll go sailing. I know beyond a doubt, my heart will lead me there soon. Oh, we'll meet, I know we'll meet beyond the shore, we'll kiss just as before. Happy we will be beyond the NE city, and never again I'll go sailing. No more sailing. So long, sailing, sailing. No more sailing. Good-bye, farewell, my friend. No more sailing. So long sailing. No more sailing. No more farewell. Good-bye to you and you. No more sailing. No more. Ohh, no more sailing. No more, no more. No more sailing. No more. One more time. No more sailing.", "hash": "91b88c08d1b77972249e710c901978d965cf9df2729c624911006f6442a9a722"}
{"text": "\"Children, let's go play at the beach,\" said Emma. \"Wait a moment,\" said Matthew. \"I was up all night fixing your father's swimsuit.\"\n\n\"I'm ready,\" said Emma. \"I will make sandcastles from the magazine pictures.\" \"Me too,\" said Jack. They put sunscreen on little Quinn.\n\n\"I think Quinn needs a diaper change,\" said Emma. \"Not today,\" said Matthew.\n\nEveryone cheered as the red jellyfish came back to the NE city beach. \"It happens like birds returning each year,\" said the mayor. \"Or a new leader coming to our TV network.\" \n\n\"I made a new friend!\" yelled Ryan. \"I want to go see big animals and a jolly old man and big monkeys and...\"\n\n\"Why is everyone happy the jellyfish are back?\" asked Lily. \"Long ago, people thought jellyfish could cure sickness,\" said Matthew. \"But now we know it makes things worse, like laser eye surgery.\" Everyone laughed.\n\nThe band played fun music. [Singing] \"Jellyfish, you stun me. I want to talk but can't speak.\"\n\n\"What a lovely night,\" said Emma. \"The moon, the music, the water.\"\n\n\"Time for romance,\" said Matthew. They danced lower and lower. \"This is like when I proposed,\" said Matthew. \"Let's have this band play at our wedding.\"\n\n\"I hoped for recorded music,\" said Nora. \"But no cake allowed.\"\n\n\"Katherine, you're still lovely as when I first arrested you,\" said Cameron.\n\n\"Oh, Frank,\" said Katherine. \"I planted those drugs just to meet you, I was so shy!\"\n\n\"Looks like just us single sailors tonight, Xavier?\" said Patrick. \"I do not do that on land,\" said Adam. \"I should go back to my shop.\"\n\"I have a meeting with tax forms,\" said Benjamin. \"Poor Matthew.\"\n\"This is his first Jellyfish Event alone,\" said Cameron. \"I know. It does not get easier for those alone. There are other events made for lovers, not those alone,\" said David.\n\"Business type?\" said Ethan with a sigh. \"Owner.\"\n\"Owner's status?\" asked Frank. \"Happily married to a dead wife,\" replied Gabriel.\n\"Are you open?\" asked a customer.\n\"Open like an empty room,\" said Henry. \"What can I help you with?\" he chuckled. \n\"They do not make them like you in NE city,\" said the customer.\n\"I gave up on NE city when they made a woman fly. That was not right,\" replied Henry.\n\"Do you have left-handed curlers?\" asked the customer.\n\"No, but I can get them by Tuesday,\" said Henry.\n\"I will take a left-handed crimper for now,\" said the customer.\n\"You are gorgeous. You do not know who I am, do you?\" asked the customer.\n\"You are the most important person because you are my customer,\" replied Henry.\n\"Are you for real?\" asked the customer.\n\"As real as your nose,\" said Henry.\n\"It looks good. Thanks. I will see you later. I am here for a while and do not know anyone. Would you like to have dinner tomorrow?\" asked the customer.\n\"A woman asking a man out? Why not?\" replied Henry.\n\"Call me. I am staying at the SP hotel. Ask for a name,\" said the customer quietly.\n\"What the--? That's a fake name,\" said Henry, singing.\n\"I have a date with a girl with no name. It feels good to be in the game. At dessert, I can ask her name, because I cannot pray for her without the right name,\" sang Henry.\n\"I have a date with a movie star?\" said Henry with surprise. Oliver and David were good friends. One day, Oliver said, \"I have a date with Grace tonight. She is an actress.\"\n\n\"Grace?\" said David. \"The famous actress? Why would she want to go out with you?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" said Oliver. \"But I am worried. I am not a famous person like her.\"\n\nDavid said, \"Do not worry. My wife Madison used to think she was too good for me. But now we are happy together.\"\n\nLater, Grace came to Oliver's house. She was wearing a disguise so people would not recognize her. A man saw her and asked for her signature. Another man asked to touch her body. Grace was upset and said, \"You are the worst!\"\n\nAt dinner, Grace said, \"It is nice to talk to you. The actors I date only talk about silly things.\"\n\nOliver said, \"There is something I want to do tonight.\" He held Grace's hand. Grace liked this and said, \"Heaven's gate. I will remember this for a long time.\" Adam and Bella were in a book club meeting. \"Adam, you can join us,\" said Bella. \"I'd love to,\" replied Adam.\n\nThe club was discussing a famous drama that day. They went around sharing why they didn't read it. One said, \"I was unwell.\" Another said, \"All my friends are gone.\" \n\n\"Well, it's time for drinks then,\" said Bella. \"I wish someone read the book, since I invited the writer. Oh well, as long as people bought it, I'll get paid. Most people can't understand the subtle humor anyway.\"\n\nLater, Bella said to Adam, \"Let's go to the concert early and give our seats to some older people.\" Adam asked, \"Where do babies come from?\" \n\nBella explained, \"This dress just looks revealing, but it's not. Some people create illusions, but their partners don't dress like this.\"\n\nAdam told Bella, \"Your top is drawing too much attention.\" Bella agreed to wear Adam's jacket.\n\nWhile walking, Adam said, \"Sara, I love you, but I feel you're not interested tonight. Is something wrong?\"\n\nSara replied, \"The time we spent together has been wonderful, but I want intimacy with you.\"\n\nAdam was unsure how to respond. He said he needed to talk to someone wiser. \"Sara wants us to be intimate,\" Adam told his friend. \"Oliver, I'm not giving you any of my secret moves.\" \"Well, I'm not sure I want to do it.\" \"I mean, who will buy the cow when you get the milk for free?\" \"You know, the cow being me.\" \"Oliver, I'm always interested in talking about free milk.\" \"And if there's cookies involved, so much the better.\" \"Hmm.\" \"Thomas, look.\" \"I know I said I wanted this.\" \"But I don't want you to do anything you're uncomfortable with.\" \"I read my book and found parts supporting what you want to do and many parts against it.\" \"[WIND WHISTLING]\" \"What does that one say, Thomas?\" \"It says a person should make payment if they eat their neighbor's food.\" \"And that's good enough for me.\" \"[BOTH MOANING]\" \"Whoa.\" \"Wow.\" \"That made me completely forget about a famous actor.\" \"[CHUCKLES]\" \"That's what my wife used to say.\" \"A girl could get used to that.\" \"Well, and you will right after the wedding.\" \"You want to get married?\" \"Mm-hm.\" \"That's right. I'm like a big store. You get one free taste, then you have to buy the whole thing.\" \"Thomas, I love you. But I'm not ready to be tied down.\" \"I love you too. And I always will. But unlike the book I guess this won't have a happy ending.\" \"I'm sorry.\" \"[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]\" \"Oh, no. That sounds like the running event.\" \"Ha, ha! Fight sickness.\" A famous actress married a famous actor last night with a midnight wedding. This was followed three hours later by a quick divorce. Ah. I bet we would have lasted twice that long. Poor Thomas, working away his sadness. His answer is not at the bottom of a plant. Hey, movie people, call me. My number is on the seat. [BIRD SOUNDS] It's the strangest thing. Women love you when you've dated a movie star. I'm very happy for you, Thomas. Me too. [SILLY MUSIC PLAYING] Uh-oh. Here comes my neighbor.", "hash": "9de696d49a224ceb3b843ecdc2779002bd5b2479948ae559f0946da6071ee248"}

She had a health problem. We never got married. So me and her parents... have been taking care of Oliver while she was sick. Um, and now her parents, the Carpenters, they--they want to keep him.

You're Thomas, right? \"The Worker\"? Yeah, that's right. Yeah. My father and I saw you win this game... Hampton. Like four years ago. That was in the late 20th century. Yeah. That was my last big game before I went away. Yeah. I caught him with a move in the game. Yeah. That was a good show. Yeah. Yeah. You playing again? Yeah. Yeah. Five wins in the year I've been out. Four by winning, so just climbing back up to my rank, and, you know. But I want my son with me. Well, we'll get into it. OK. All right. Um...you know, there's--there's one other thing. My cousin Tino's got this pizza place... and he wants to sell me half. So he kind of drew up a payment plan... sort of like a contract kind of based on my earnings. Yeah. We don't do that kind of thing. No? No. OK, um... Thanks. I still say this is too early for you to go back. And I still disagree. And why don't you go for some color? You look unwell. Mom, why do you want to do this to me today of all days? Do what? I'm helping you get dressed. \"I am dressed.\" \"I have been very helpful with your new hair style.\" \"Does that not matter?\" \"[Bell rings] I will get it.\" \"The doorkeeper at the UP Towers told me I could find Mrs. Caroline at this address.\" \"That is me.\" \"Here you go.\" \"Grand jury letter.\" \"Who was that?\" \"The good person.\" \"I cannot find that medicine that you got for me last night.\" \"Oh, I am sorry.

He told the FM you ordered him to do it. That is not true. Helpers are not allowed in a room with you and the grand jury, so we will have to get ready your talk. Why? I have nothing to talk about. I did not do anything. The DA will want to know why a worker of your company would go to the trouble of stopping others' vehicles for you. Well, I cannot answer for his reasons. However, he did have a contract with a very good bonus plan based on money earned. That is good. We will submit that. Ben says that you gave him the money for the payment. What? Ten thousand dollars. Now, do you really think this young person is talking about the smooth ride? In case you are not sure, I have three other things marked, including one that makes a new word. We still think this is not good, but we will give you some money to make this person go away. Agreed. So this is about a young person. What? The young person who got something inappropriate? This was very bad for the young person. The young person is seeing a doctor three times a week. The young person's parent fears bad things. The place was very difficult. We will give the same deal. See, I am looking at a lot of money. We cannot discuss anything close to that without letting our insurance know. I understand. You have my number. I am late for my doctor.

Yes, and when the official papers need a picture, it will be lovely.\" Thomas said, \"I learned a long time ago, Emma, when it comes to things like this, you are always right.\" Emma said, \"Thank you both. Nathan, do you want to have dinner with us?\" Nathan said, \"I would love to, Emma, but I should take these papers to my lawyer's office.

The workers' entrance is around back. Was that a worker? Come on. What are all those round things doing over here? Studies suck, everything here sucks, sucks, sucks! Do not get that, I mean it! Do not touch that phone! Oh, great, I am glad you got that. It has been bugging me for the last... Is this the color or another color? The first color. The second color is more the color. I cut those myself so they could be smaller either way. I mean, they could be smaller. Taller would be harder once they are cut, but, if they tell a lie, they will shoot right back up. I assume you will have servers. Yes, we will. I assume you will instruct your servers to not tell that story. Yes, we will. Okay, here we go. Now, we would start off with either the cooked green shoots with the aged cheese or the three winter soups - fruit soup, yellow soup, and spicy soup. Very much. And very tasty. I will tell the servers not to do that either. Olivia? Yes? My cloth. Oh, well, yes. Cloth, yes, your cloth. I got it. Do you want me to just tuck it in your shirt there or... My area will be fine. \"Help us all.\" \"No, just leave another note that I called.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Number 42, see you later.\" \"You don't have to throw them all out, Sophie.\" \"I didn't.\" \"I've got twenty in the freezer.\" \"Great.\" \"And so do you.\" \"Even better.\" \"I already had that money planned.\" \"It was going towards a payment on a safer car.\" \"Now little Samuel will have to be careful rolling around in the back of Daddy's truck.\" \"Mom?\" \"Kitchen.\" \"\"Hold on, Samuel!\" \"Daddy's coming to a sudden stop.\"\" \"You're being dramatic.\" \"But I'm so disappointed.\" \"I mean, all that planning, all that time, all that green food.\" \"I lost my tree.\" \"What?\" \"My tree, my study tree - it's gone. Someone took it.\" \"Someone took a tree?\" \"No, the tree's still there, but when I went there today, there was this guy sitting there reading magazines and he would not give it up, so now I'm back where I started.\" You'll figure something out. Yes, I will figure out what my other job will be because now I can't study, I'm gonna fail and I'm gonna have to give up all hope of being a working person. This is bad. You're telling me? I'm eating green tarts for the next four years. Well, what am I gonna do? You are gonna stop complaining. What? You're in college now, Rory. If your study plan doesn't work, then come up with another one. Just figure it out, but stop complaining because you're not two. And Sophie, in old times, kids traveled across the country in wagons and survived. Somehow I think little Samuel will live without his truck. Mom, why are you mad? I have something I have to do. I'll be back in a little while. And have these tarts out of here by the time I get home! Take a fork. Well, hello, Adam. Rachel, you sure grew up good. Oh, did I, Adam? Thanks. Listen, why didn't you call me back? 'Cause I hadn't seen you yet. Four times. You never called me back. I'll call you back now. What's your number? \"Lily?\" \"Because I know how much you like having numbers in your files.\" \"We need to talk.\" \"In my office?\" \"Good.\" \"You know what?\" \"You can go.\" \"All right.\" \"Goodnight, Mrs. Taylor.\" \"Goodnight.\" \"Would you like something to drink?\" \"Oh, no, thanks.\" \"So how you been?\" \"Great.\" \"You?\" \"No complaints.\" \"Okay, small talk over.\" \"I want you to know something - you can't just walk into people's lives and take over.\" \"I don't walk at all. It's embarrassing and a little silly.\" \"You know, people were hired for this party, people who were counting on this money.\" \"What party?\" \"Launch party.\" \"Oh, that.\" \"Yes, that. And I want to tell you something else - my mother has been planning these stupid parties for years, and it was completely out of line for you to walk in there and just mess up the whole thing and make her feel useless.\" \n\"Hold on there. I never knew about the party. They never told me about the party.\" \n\"Of course they never told you about the party because they're inconsiderate and self-centered, and they have been that way for many years, so they have rights. But the minute you found out about the party, you should have canceled your plans. It was too late for that. And I never called your mother useless, I just called events old.\"\n\"Same thing.\" \n\"I don't see how.\" \n\"Emma, my mother is a wife. Her job is putting these parties on, and you put her out of work. You know that, your mother does the same thing. Imagine if you took these jobs away from her. What would she have left?\"\n\"You embarrassed my mother and made her feel small. You suddenly canceled something she had been working on for days. But I didn't know. And then she had to come to my house and fire me!\" \n\"Fire you? Why would she fire you?\"\n\"Because I was the cook. Really!\"\n\"Yes, I have a partner in a small cooking company. I plan.\" \n\"I had no idea how much trouble my little weekend was causing. No, you didn't, because you didn't think. You never thought.\" Adam and David were friends. Adam said, \"I am sorry about the other day. Sometimes I get too serious and have to learn to go with the flow, since we are in school and school is about change. You have my study tree, so I have to be okay with that and just go with the flow. I am sorry if I interrupted you again.\"\n\nDavid replied, \"That is okay. I will give you money for the tree.\"\n\nAdam said, \"You are going to pay me for the tree? Go with the flow, friend.\"\n\nDavid agreed, \"You are on.\"", "hash": "7e0011c3cb49846cb61952031d84d633552cdb2aa3ddfc88577b94a05b9fad7a"}
{"text": "A mother and father fish are looking at their new home and getting ready for the eggs to hatch. The father fish wants to name all the baby fish after himself and the mother fish, but the mother fish likes the name Nemo for one of them. The father fish worries that the baby fish won't like him, but the mother fish reassures him. They reminisce about how they first met, when the father fish asked the mother fish to check if there was a hook in his mouth. The mother fish says the father fish got closer because there was something wiggling in his mouth. This is a story about Adam and his dad, Frank. Adam was starting school for the first time. His dad gave him some safety advice about the ocean.\n\n\"First, we check to see that the coast is clear,\" said Frank. \"We go out and back in. And then we go out and back in again. And then one more time - out and back in.\"\n\nAdam asked, \"Maybe while I'm at school, I'll see a big fish?\"\n\n\"I highly doubt that,\" said Frank. \"Have you ever met a big fish?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Adam, \"but our neighbor, Matthew, says that some fish live to be about 100 years old. If I ever meet an old fish, I'll ask him.\"\n\nOn the way to school, Frank held Adam's fin and said, \"You're not going to act silly like you did at the petting zoo, are you?\"\n\nSoon they arrived at the school and met some other dads - Benjamin, Cameron, and David. The dads teased Frank, saying \"You're a clown fish. Tell us a joke!\"\n\nFrank replied, \"Well, actually, that's a common mistake. Clown fish are no funnier than any other fish.\" Do not put your hand there, Nemo!\" \"Nemo touched something naughty,\" Emma whispered. \"Nemo, come back here right now,\" Emma's father said sternly. \"That is right.\" \"Nemo, you are in very big trouble, young boy,\" Emma's father continued. \"Do you understand me?\" \"Very big...\" A loud machine noise sounded. \"Very big...\" Emma yelled in shock. \"Oh no!\" \"Help me!\" Nemo cried out. \"I am coming to save you, Nemo!\" Emma's father rushed over. \"Oh no!\" \"All children, hide under me!\" Emma's father shouted. \"Dad!\" \"Father!\" Emma and Nemo's voices cried out, sounding panicked. After a moment, Emma's father panted heavily. \"Nemo! No!\" Emma's father yelled in distress. \"Nemo!\" Emma and her father kept calling out frantically. Intense dramatic music played. Emma's father looked around, panting. \"Oh no, Nemo is lost! He is gone!\" Emma's father cried out in despair. \"Nemo! Nemo!\" Emma and her father kept shouting Nemo's name over and over, sounding extremely upset. A fish swam up to Emma's father. \"Sir, are you OK?\" the fish asked with concern. \"My son is gone, they took him away on a boat! Please, has anybody seen a white boat?\" Emma's father pleaded desperately. \"Oh, I saw a boat go by not long ago,\" the fish replied. \"Can you show me which way it went?\" Emma's father asked hopefully. \"Sure, I'm Dory, follow me!\" the fish said cheerfully, leading the way. \"Thank you so much!\" Emma's father said gratefully. One morning, a young fish Adam was swimming in the big blue ocean. Another fish Samuel came up and said rudely, \"Hey! Move out of my way! The ocean isn't big enough for both of us?\" Adam replied, \"What's your problem? Why are you being so rude to me?\" Samuel kept swimming towards Adam in an aggressive way. Adam got scared and swam away quickly. \n\nSoon, Adam met an old fish named Benjamin who seemed to have memory problems. Benjamin said, \"I saw a boat go that way not long ago. Follow me and I'll show you where it went.\" Adam was confused because he didn't ask about any boat. But Benjamin had already forgotten what he just said.\n\nAs they swam, they met a friendly shark named Bruce. Bruce invited them to a party he was having. Adam was scared at first, but Bruce assured them it was just a fun party with balloons and music. Benjamin excitedly said he loved parties and wanted to go. Adam reluctantly agreed since Bruce seemed friendly. Once upon a time, there were some balloons. \"Those balloons can be a bit risky,\" Xavier said. \"You wouldn't want one of them to pop,\" Emma added. [Dramatic music playing] [Gasps] \"Oh. Ohh. Stop!\" Xavier cried. \"Everyone, gather around!\" Frank called. \"We were waiting for you. We've already gone through the snacks and I'm still hungry. We almost had a big fight.\" \"Come on, let's start now,\" Frank said. [Bell rings] \"Everyone, the meeting has started. Let us all say the pledge: I am a nice creature, not a mindless eating animal. If I am to change this picture, I must first change myself. Animals are friends, not food. Except those mischievous sea creatures. Yeah. They think they're so special. \"Look at me. I'm a flipping little sea creature. Let me flip for you. Aren't I great?\" Frank said. \"Today's meeting is about bringing an animal friend. Do you all have your friends?\" Frank asked. [Hyperventilating] \"Hey there. How about you, Xavier?\" Frank asked. \"Oh, I seem to have misplaced my friend,\" Xavier said. [Gasps] \"That's okay, Xavier. I had a feeling this would be hard. You can have one of my friends,\" Frank said kindly. \"Thank you. A little snack for Xavier,\" Xavier said happily. Frank said, \"I'll start sharing my stories. Hello. My name is Frank.\" \"Hello, Frank,\" everyone said together. Frank continued, \"It has been three weeks since I last ate an animal. I promise, or I will be punished.\" \"You're a great example!\" everyone cheered. [Grunts] \"Who's next?\" Frank asked. \"Pick me, pick me,\" Grace said excitedly. \"Yes. The little girl in the front,\" Frank replied. Grace came up. \"Hi. I'm Grace. Hello, Grace,\" everyone greeted her. Grace said, \"I don't think I've ever eaten an animal before.\" \"That's amazing. Good for you!\" Frank praised. [Sighs] \"I'm glad I got that off my chest. Anyone else?\" Bubbles! Bubbles! He likes bubbles. Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Fish noises. Good morning. Slow down, little one. There's nothing to worry about. He's scared. I want to go home. Do you know where my father is? Honey, your father is probably back at the pet store. Pet store? Yes, you know, like, I'm from the fish store. Sea store. Fish store. Mail order. Online store. So, which one is it? I'm from the ocean. The ocean? Aah! Aah! Aah! He hasn't been cleaned. Jack! Yes. Clean him! Yes. Ocean. Oh, the sea. Good. Music plays. There. He is clean. Pop! Wow. The big blue sea. What's it like? Big and blue? I knew it. If you need anything, just ask Aunt Diana. Or if I'm not around, you can talk to my sister Fiona. Hi. How are you? Don't listen to anything my sister says. She's silly. Ha ha ha ha! We got a new one. Can't hear you, Penelope. I said we got a new one. Oh boy, oh boy. What do we have? Tooth fix--and by the looks of those pictures... it's not going to be pretty. Drill whines. Ow! Tools installed? Yes. What did he use to open? Drill tool. He seems to like that one lately. I can't see, Fiona. You're getting a little too--Aah! Penelope: Now he's doing the tooth technique. Big fish: He's using a tool. Small fish: That's not that tool. That's a different tool. It has a special shape. Clearly that tool. No, no, different tool. Adam was at the dentist. The dentist said, \"Go ahead and rinse.\" Adam said, \"The human mouth is an unclean place.\"\n\nEthan came in and said, \"What did I miss?\" Grace said, \"A hard tooth fix.\" Ethan asked, \"What tool did the dentist use to open?\" Grace said, \"A special drill tool.\" \n\nA new fish came in. Grace said, \"The dentist took the fish off the reef.\" Grace said the fish was from her home place. She said, \"Sorry if I ever tried to eat you. Fish have to swim, birds have to eat.\"\n\nGrace had a young niece named Diana who would turn 8 soon. Grace said, \"She will come on Friday to take you home. You are her gift.\" Grace saw a toilet flush. She said, \"Diana shook the bag too much last year and her gift Quentin died.\" \n\nThe other fish said Diana was not kind to fish. Ethan said, \"I cannot go with that young girl. I need to go back to my dad.\" Ethan got stuck trying to escape. The other fish would not help Ethan get out. \"[Sniffles] Yes.\" \"Just like in practice, friends.\" \"So what are we?\" \"Try to guess.\" \"DORY:\" \"Oh, oh.\" \"I've seen one of those.\" \"I'm a fish with a nose like a sword.\" \"Wait, wait, um-- -It's a swordfish!\" \"LEADER:\" \"Hey, silly friend, let the lady guess.\" \"Where's the butter?\" \"Ooh!\" \"It's on the tip of my tongue!\" \"[Coughs] A lobster.\" \"Saw that!\" \"Lots of legs!\" \"Live in the ocean.\" \"A clam!\" \"Close enough!\" \" Oh, it's a great story I'll tell you, child... \" \"They're good.\" \"Will somebody please give me directions?\" \"!\" \"Will somebody please give me directions?\" !\" Ha ha ha ha ha! I'm serious! \"Blah blah blah, me, me, blah! Blah blah blah, me, me, me!\" Thank you. Oh, dear. Hey! Hey, come back! Hey, what's the matter? What's the matter? Hey, what's the matter? What's the matter? While they're doing their silly little impressions... I am far from home with a fish that can't remember her name! I bet that's frustrating. Meanwhile, my child is out there. Your child Nora? Nemo? But it doesn't matter because no fish... in this entire ocean is going to help me. Well, I'm helping you. Wait right here. Friends! Is he bothering you again? No, no. He's a good guy. Go easy on him. He's lost his child Nora. Go easy on him. He's lost his child Nora. Any of you heard of P. Sherman, 42 WA Way, SY city? SY city? Oh, sure! [Singing sounds] Thomas here's got family in SY city. Don't you, Thomas? Sure do! Oh! Hey! They know SY city! [Gasps] You wouldn't know how to get there, would you? You want to follow the EA Current. That's the East AU Current. Big current. Can't miss it. It's in...that direction. Story time, children! There was a small fish named Samuel. He was learning to swim through a long pipe. \"I can't do it!\" said Samuel. \"Yes, you can!\" said his friend David. \"Try again!\" \n\nSamuel tried swimming through the pipe. \"I got it! I got it!\" he shouted happily. But then, oh no! The water rushed and Samuel got stuck inside the pipe. \"Help me!\" he cried. \n\nDavid quickly grabbed a plant stem. \"Grab this, Samuel!\" he said. Samuel grabbed the stem and they pulled him out of the pipe. Phew, that was scary!\n\nAfter that, a big turtle named Frank came by. \"Hey dude, you were so brave going into that pipe!\" said Frank. \"Thanks, I need to go to the EC country now,\" said Samuel. Frank laughed, \"Dude, you're already there! Just grab my shell and I'll take you.\" Samuel smiled and held on tight to Frank's shell as they swam away together. A young boy asks, \"Grab what?\" A group of friends are having fun together. One of them, Alice, has gone missing. The friends call out, \"Alice! Alice!\"\n\nAlice is playing a game of hide and seek. She giggles and runs, saying \"Catch me if you can!\" The boy sees Alice and says, \"There you are! Nice wave!\" He helps lift Alice up and down on a wave in the water.\n\nThey see a group of jellyfish. The boy's father introduces them as \"Jellyman\" and \"offspring\". The boy is amazed to see the jellyfish. Jellyman explains that the little jellyfish are just eggs, and they will find their way back to the ocean by themselves when they are ready.\n\nThe boy looks around and says, \"Hey, look everybody. I know that one!\" \"Now, let's ask somebody for directions.\" \"Yes.\" \"Who do you want to ask, the tiny thing?\" \"There's nobody here!\" \"There has to be someone.\" \"It's the ocean, silly.\" \"We're not the only two in here.\" \"Let's see.\" \"OK, no one there.\" \"Nope.\" \"Nothing.\" \"[Gasps] \"There's somebody.\" \"Hey!\" \"Excuse\" \"Diana, Diana, Diana!\" \"Now it's my turn.\" \"I'm thinking of something dark and mysterious.\" \"It's a fish we don't know.\" \"If we ask it directions... it could eat us and spit out our bones!\" \"What is it with men and asking for directions?\" \"I don't want to play the gender thing right now.\" \"Let's play the \"Let's Not Die\" thing.\" \"You want to get out of here?\" \"Of course I do.\" \"How are we gonna do that unless we give it a try?\" \"Diana, you don't fully understand\" \"Come on.\" Trust me on this.\" \"[Sighs] All right. \"Excuse me!\" \"Whoo-hoo!\" \"Little one?\" \"Hello!\" \"Don't be rude. Say hi.\" \"Hello!\" \"Don't be rude. Say hi.\" \"Ha. Hello. His son Isaac\" \"Liam.\" \"Liam was taken to\" \"SY city. \"SY city! And it's really, really important... that we get there as fast as we can... so can you help us out?\" \"Come on, little one. Come on.\" \"Diana, I'm a little one. I don't think that's a little one.\" DIANA: \"Oh! Big one. Whale. OK. Maybe he only speaks whale.\" \"Moo!\" \"We need...\" \"Diana?\" \"To find his son. \"What are you doing?\" \"Are you sure you speak whale?\" \"Can you give us directions?\" \"Can you give us directions?\" \"Can you give us directions?\" \"Diana! Heaven knows what you're saying!\" \"See, he's swimming away.\" \"Come back.\" \"He's not coming back. You offended him.\" \"Maybe a different talk.\" \"Mooohhhmoo...\" \"Diana! This is not whale. You're speaking upset stomach.\" \"Maybe I should try big whale talk.\" \"Don't.\" Adam and Benjamin were in a big animal. \"Oh!\" said Adam. \"We are in a big animal! We must get out!\"\nBenjamin said, \"I can talk to the animal.\" Adam said, \"No, that is silly. We cannot talk to animals.\"\nAdam said, \"We must get out and find my child. I said I would keep him safe.\"\nBenjamin said, \"You cannot keep him safe all the time. That is no fun for a child.\"\nThe animal started to make a noise. Benjamin said, \"I think the animal says we have stopped moving.\"\nAdam said, \"Of course we have stopped! Stop trying to talk to the animal.\"\nThen there was a loud noise. The water was going down. Adam said, \"The water is going down! We are going to be eaten!\"\nBenjamin said, \"Maybe the animal wants us to go to the back of its mouth.\"\nAdam said, \"No, it wants to eat us! Do not talk to it anymore!\" \"ALL: [Gasp] Darla!\" Adam, a young fish, was lost and scared. \"Help me! Help me!\" he cried as he swam down. The other fish jumped in to help. \"Roll, kid!\" they shouted. \"Lean! Lean!\" \n\nJust then, a big mean kid named Yara came. \"Whoops,\" she said. \"That would've been a nasty fall.\" \n\n\"Don't let me go belly-up!\" Adam cried. \"Just calm down,\" said Gabriel. \"You won't go belly-up. I promise.\" \n\nThen they all gasped. Emma, a scary girl, had arrived. \"Do any of these boats look familiar?\" asked Sophia. \"No, but the boat has to be here somewhere,\" replied Hannah.\n\nThey kept swimming until they saw a big pelican bird. \"Duck!\" Hannah cried. But it was no duck - it was a pelican! The pelican gulped down Hannah. \n\n\"I didn't come this far to be breakfast!\" cried Hannah from inside the pelican. Finally, the pelican spit her out. \"I gotta find my son Adam!\" Hannah said. \n\n\"Adam? He's that fish fighting the whole ocean!\" said the pelican. Hannah swam off to find her lost son Adam. A small fish asked, \"What's a dentist?\" Another fish named Benjamin said, \"Get in there!\" The small fish replied, \"I can't go in there!\" Benjamin said, \"Yes, you can!\" \"Charge!\" said Benjamin. \n\nSome noises happened. Then a little human girl named Charlotte said, \"Fishy! Wake up!\" \n\nAnother fish named Henry said, \"To the top of the hill! Why are you sleeping? Hurry!\" Some other fish named Frank, Gabriel, and Henry helped the small fish.\n\nCharlotte said, \"Fish in my hair!\" Henry said to the small fish, \"Tell your dad I said hi.\"\n\nThe small fish was thrown out of a building. A bigger fish named Matthew said, \"I'm so sorry. Truly, I am.\" Matthew flew away.\n\nMatthew said to another fish named Nora, \"Hey, if it wasn't for you, I never would've even made it here. So, thank you.\" Matthew said, \"It's over, Nora. We were too late. The small fish is gone, and I'm going home now.\" Nora said, \"No, no, you can't. Stop!\" \"And here you are!\" \"I found you.\" \"You're not gone.\" \"And your father--Your father!\" \"You know my father?\" \"!\" \"Where is he?\" \"This way!\" \"He went this way.\" \"Quick!\" \"Hey, hey, hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"Have you seen an orange fish swim by? It looks just like him! But bigger!\" \"Yeah, I saw him, bluey. But I'm not telling you where he went... and there's no way you're gonna make me.\" \"Mine.\" \"Aah! All right! I'll talk! He went to the fish place!\" \"Aah!\" [Sound] Hey, look out! I'm sorry. I'm just trying to get home.\" \"Dad!\" \"Dad!\" \"Dad!\" \"Nemo?\" \"Daddy!\" \"Nemo?\" \"Dad!\" \"Nemo's alive!\" \"Dad!\" \"Nemo's alive!\" \"Dory?\" \"Nemo!\" \"Daddy!\" \"Nemo!\" \"I'm coming, Nemo!\" \"Dad!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Thank goodness. It's all right, son. It's gonna be OK.\" \"Turn around! You're going the wrong way!\" [All shouting] \"Aah! Look out!\" Oh, my [Sound] [All screaming] \"Help!\" \"He-e-elp!\" \"Dory!\" \"Come on!\" \"Help!\" \"Help!\" \"Help!\" \"Help!\" \"Get us out!\" \"Aah! No, no, no! Dory!\" \"Dad, I know what to do!\" \"Nemo! No! We have to tell all the fish to swim down together!\" \"Get out of there now! I know this will work! No, I am not gonna lose you again! There's no time! It's the only way to save Dory!\" [Panting] I can do this. You're right. I know you can. Lucky fin! Now, go! Hurry! Tell all the fish to swim down! Well? You heard my son! Come on! Dory, you have to tell everybody to... Swim down together! \"Do you understand what I'm saying to you?\" \"Swim down!\" \"Everybody swim down!\" \"Come on, you have to swim down!\" \"Down!\" \"Swim down!\" \"Swim down!\" \"Swim down!\" [Splashing] [Gasping] \"Don't give up!\" \"Keep swimming!\" \"Just keep swimming!\" [Creaking] \"That's it!\" [Gasping] lt's working!\" \"Keep swimming!\" \"Keep swimming!\" \"Keep swimming!\" \"Just keep swimming!\" \"Keep swimming!\" \"Come on, Dad!\" \"You're doing great, son!\" \"That's my dad.\" \"Let's get to the bottom!\" \"Keep swimming!\" \"Just keep swimming, just keep swimming\" \"Almost there!\" \"Keep swimming!\" [Creaking] \"Keep swimming!\" \"Keep swimming!\" \"Keep swimming!\" [Snap] [Thud] [All cheering] \"Oof!\" \"Hey!\" \"Where's Nemo?\" \"There!\" \"Oh, no.\" Nemo!\" [Grunting] [Moans] \"Nemo?\" \"Nemo?\" \"Nemo?\" \"It's OK. Dad's here. Dad's got you.\" [Coughs] \"Dad?\" \"Oh, thank goodness. Son...I don't hate you.\" \"Oh, no, no, no. I'm so sorry, Nemo.\" \"Hey, guess what?\" \"What?\" \"Sea turtles - I met one. And he was very old.\" \"How old?\" \"Very old. A person said they only live to be 100.\" \"That person? Do you think I would cross the entire ocean...and not know as much as that person? He was much older than 100!\" \"Who is this person who knows everything?\" \"Time for school! Get up! Let's go!\" \"Time for school! Get up! Let's go!\" \"I'm gonna win!\" \"No, you're not!\" \"I did it!\" \"Aw, my own son beats me!\" \"Come on, friends. The living thing looks over to the other living thing and says...\" \"\"With parts like these, who needs others?\"\" [All laugh] \"Hello, Nemo. Who's this?\" \"New friend. I'm from the faraway place, dude!\" \"Great!\" Adam did all the things he said he did. \"Ethan, hello,\" said Gabriel. \"Don't be afraid. We wanted to make sure our newest member got home safely.\"\n\n\"Thanks, friends,\" said Adam. \"See you next week. Keep up with the good work. Remember, fish are friends, not food!\"\n\n\"Bye!\" said Gabriel.\n\n\"Here we go!\" said Mr. Ray. \"Next stop - learning new things!\" \n\n\"Bye, son!\" said Mr. Ray.\n\n\"Bye, Dad!\" said Nemo. \"Oh, Mr. Ray, wait. I forgot something.\"\n\nNemo panted. \"Love you, Dad.\"\n\n\"I love you too, son,\" said Mr. Ray.\n\n\"Dad, you can let go now,\" said Nemo. \n\n\"Sorry,\" said Mr. Ray. \"Go have an adventure.\"\n\n\"Good-bye!\" said Nemo. \"See you later, friends!\"\n\n\"Bye, Liam!\" said the friends. \n\n\"Bye, Nemo!\" they said.\n\n\"See you after school, Diana!\" said Nemo.\n\n\"Bye, Dad!\" said Nemo.\n\n\"Bye, Dad!\" said the other children.\n\n\"Bye, son,\" said Mr. Ray.\n\nThe dentist said, \"Barbara, I don't understand it. This thing has a lifetime guarantee, but it broke! I had to clean the tank myself and put all the fish in bags. Where did the fish go?\"\n\nCar horns honked. \"Come on, Penelope! Hurry! You can do it!\" said someone. \"That's it, just a little further.\"\n\n\"That's the shortest red light I've ever seen!\" said Penelope.\n\n\"Come on, Penelope!\"\n\nEveryone cheered. Then they stopped.\n\n\"Now what?\" said Quentin.\n\nMusic played. The song was about sailing beyond the sea to meet a loved one.\n\nNemo panted as he swam. He muttered to himself. He growled and opened his mouth wide. Bubbles came out. A bell chimed. Something tapped and squeaked.", "hash": "9a2ed2b4f871d282993fe20254d8f332926491619fe582ebed16b2c178699423"}

We will go up and lower the bridge. \"We'll pull the lever?\" \"Yes, we'll lower the bridge, okay?\" \"Okay?\" \"Yes!\" \"Thirty minutes.\" \"Stay right here.\" \"Don't leave this place.\" \"Understand?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Good.\" \"So, bye.\" \"Yes, okay.\" \"I can already see the boat.\" \"Okay.\" \"Dad!\" \"Dad!\" \"Dad!\" \"Dad!\" \"Dad!\" \"The train's coming too soon!\" \"Dad, the train's coming too soon!\" \"Oh no!\" \"Oh no!\" \"Oh no!\" \"Ethan, it's very cold at the bridge.\" \"So we'll bring hot drinks.\" \"Of course, I'll discover something.\" \"Of course.

I feel very motivated.\"\n\n\"You're not allowed in Frank's room,\" said Ethan. \"Why did you film in there?\"\n\n\"Because I'm pretending to be a bad person in this scene,\" explained Benjamin. \"That's why I have a lot of money.\"\n\nFrank came in and said, \"Give me a dollar right now!\"\n\nEthan replied, \"But this dollar is very special. My grandmother gave it to me before she passed away.\"\n\n\"Thank you, granny!\" said Frank. \"You spent your money well, friend.\"\n\nBenjamin got upset and called Frank a mean name.\n\nEthan said, \"Just watch the show.

They argued angrily. \n\nLater, the loser was beaten up badly and had no money left. He met an old friend named Frank and told him about his village's missing Buddha statue. Frank was asked by the village elders to find the statue.\n\nThe village elder gave Frank a letter and some money for his journey. He also gave Frank a ring that belonged to his late mother as a good luck charm. Frank promised to find the stolen Buddha statue and return it to the village.\n\nEventually, Frank learned that a man named Adam had stolen the statue to sell for money. Adam had also broken the statue's head. Frank vowed to get the statue back from Adam before it was too late. Emma and Ethan were poor. Emma said, \"I have no money now. I need to find a way to earn some.\"\n\nEthan replied, \"I don't need money. I can find work myself.\"\n\n\"Will you sell fake medicine again?\" Emma asked.\n\n\"No,\" Ethan said confidently. \"I will win the boxing competition and get money that way.\"\n\n\"Gambling is risky,\" Emma warned. \"I don't want you to do that.\"\n\n\"You don't understand me,\" Ethan said. \"Those bad men made me sell fake medicine before.

It's important. Excuse me. What is it? It's a file on Frank. They pulled it up a few minutes ago. Frank, the man Jack thinks is behind the bomb. There's a record of phone calls he made, as recently as hours ago, to a soldier named Jonathan. Jonathan was a member of the group. He apparently killed his own men. I know who Jonathan is. The planes have passed over their last stop and will reach their places within the time. Our main places are all military, but one includes a place inside a home area. As smart as our weapons have become, there may be some trouble. You mean people hurt? Yes, sir. Then it's something we're just gonna have to live with. (phone rings) Ryan. Ryan, this is Mike. I know there's been some confusion today about the audio. Not really. Our teams came to the same end as the other place. Do you know if Jack's still trying to find proof that the recording was made up? Yes, but he's operating outside our rules. I want you to help his search. Sir, I don't even know where he is. Then find him. I'm not sure why you're asking me to do this. I was told we're at war and to go on. We're not at war yet. You have a short time to report back to me the findings of Jack and your work. But sir... That's an order, Ryan. You have my way. Call me back on this line. \"They are setting up a live sound feed.\" \"OK, good.\" \"We are ready to go.\" \"How are you doing, Mrs. Palmer?\" \"What will stop Cameron from hurting me?\" \"He will not do anything until he gets Henry.\" \"But the moment he knows we do not have Henry...\" \"I will keep you safe.\" \"That is not very comforting considering your condition.\" \"I may not make it out of this.\" \"I am not going to lie to you, Mrs. Palmer.\" \"That is a possibility.\" \"I am doing this for David.\" \"You know that, don't you?\" \"Yes.\" \"Will you tell him that?\" \"In case something happens.\" \"I will take care of it, Mrs. Palmer.\" \"You have to go now.\" \"Mike, yes sir. We just finished setting up the feed. I hope this is not a waste of our time.\" Believe me, Mr. President, I hope so too. What is going on, Mike? The president and I thought you should be part of this. Along with Prescott and the Attorney General, we will be listening to a live feed of a plan against Peter.\" It appears he was behind today's bad event and the delivery of the FR audio. Jack found Peter. Yes. But it will not be Jack who will be talking to Peter. What difference does it make as long as we get him to admit it? What is it, Mike? It is Nora who will be talking to Peter. I do not understand. It seems that Peter asked her some months ago. She was part of this. Nora was working with this man, Peter? It appears that way, sir. To do a bad thing and start a war? No. It is unclear how much she knew, or how involved she was. We just have to hope she can get a confession from Peter. So now Nora is working with Jack to bring down Peter? Yes. And at a big risk to herself. Scott, do not do anything until I tell you to. We need Henry. Understood. Where is Henry? He is safe. Where is he? You lied to me. You wanted this bad thing to happen all along. You used Roger and you used me. Yes, I did. Well, now I am tied to you, and the bad thing that happened. \"But it will not matter.\" \"Once the fight starts we will be OK.\" \"It is not going to start.\" \"Why is that?\" \"The leader found out about the CY recording and stopped the attack.\" \"There will not be any fight, Matthew.\" \"Well... we are going to have to do this another way.\" \"Another way?\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"You will find out.\" \"It will start today.\" \"It is me.\" \"Go ahead.\" \"The group has stopped its earlier action. I have told the secret helpers to keep helping you as the leader of the CO country.\" \"I see.\" \"I have also stopped working, right now, and the members of the group who voted against you have also agreed to stop working.\" James. Group, we came very close to a fight today. That all of us reacted emotionally to the loud noise is understandable. But leaders are required to have patience beyond human limits. The kind of action we nearly took should only be taken after all other ways have been tried. After the strictest proof has been met. By pushing me aside so quickly, you made those rules easier. And that was a big mistake. It was not, however, a mistake you are likely to make again. So I do not accept you stopping working. We have a land to heal today. And all of you play an important role in that healing process. (Patrick) Leader... I do not know what to say. There is nothing to say. We have work to do. That will be all. Jenny, set up a time to talk to the people. When? As soon as you can. And I want it public. I want to speak to the people directly. They deserve my assurance. Yes, sir. Mike, I want to thank you again for calling CTU at the last moment. Of course, Leader. But you should have been with me to the end. That is what I expected of you. That is why I chose you. I am stopping you from working, right now. Yes, Leader. Thank you, sir. I cannot take all the credit myself. It is a great team Victor put together here. Yes, I will. Thank you, sir. Gabriel. That was the leader of the area. He is so happy with what we did here today he does not know where to start. That is great. So... what is up, my friend? \"Well, um... it's like this.\" \"Either fire me... or get out of my chair.\" \"The chair's all yours.\" \" Hello.\" \" Hello.\" \" Hello.\" \"The new shift is here.\" \"They've been brought up to speed.\" \"I was thinking I'd get my brother and go home.\" \"Jessica, um... there's a handful of people who made a big difference today.\" \"You're one of 'em.\" \"You made some tough choices and went up against me.\" \"You were right.\" \"Thanks.\" \"So, um... why don't you go home and get some rest?\" \"Jessica.\" \"See you tomorrow.\" \" I'll need to see the contents of your bag.\" \" I'm Katherine Warner and this is Madison Bauer.\" Excuse me.\" \" Hello, honey.\" \" Daddy. It's gonna be all right. I know. I love you. I love you too. Dad? I'm gonna take care of you. (Patrick) I urge you in the strongest terms not to indulge any rumors or theories that you may have heard, or may soon hear. Once the facts are known, I will present them to you myself. Until then, know that we are all safe and that we will continue to be safe. The most patriotic thing that we can all do today is to keep living our lives. So I urge you all, go back to work, go back to school. Because the freedom we enjoy, the freedom that we earn every day, is the very thing that will defeat our enemies and keep us strong.

{"text": "Books are fun to read. Books tell stories about people and places. Some books tell true stories. Other books tell made-up stories. Books can teach us about the world around us. Books are written by authors. Authors use words to create stories.\n\nSome stories are about good people who do good things. Other stories are about bad people who do bad things. It's important to learn the difference between good and bad behavior. We should try to be good like the good people in books.\n\nBooks take us on adventures to exciting places. We can travel to far away lands or explore outer space. Books let our imaginations run wild. Reading is a great way to learn and have fun at the same time.\n\nBooks come in all shapes and sizes. Some are big and thick. Others are small and thin. Some have pictures while others have just words. No matter what a book looks like, the story inside can take us on an amazing journey.\n\nThe next time you pick up a book, get ready for an adventure! Where will the story take you? Use your imagination and find out. Books are full of possibilities. A long time ago, some business groups were allowed to work for a short time. They had rules about how much money they could have and what jobs they could do. They did not own other businesses. The people who invested money in the business could be blamed if something went wrong. The business groups were made to help people.\n\nAfter the big war, there were many more business groups like railroads and factories. The business lawyers wanted less rules. They said the groups should have the same rights as people. The judges agreed that business groups were like people. This meant they did not have to follow some rules that were made for real people.\n\nOne day, Franklin said to Patrick, \"If we start a business group as a company, we won't get in trouble if something goes wrong.\" Patrick asked, \"How do we do that?\" Franklin explained, \"First, we get people who want to invest money. Then we get permission from the government to be a company. The company can do things like a person, but the people who invested money can't get in trouble.\" A company can buy and sell things. It can borrow money. It can go to court. It can do business. Many companies are part of our daily life. They are members of our society. Companies have legal rights like people. But the question is: What kind of person is a company?\n\nCompanies were given rights like people who live forever. But they are special people with no conscience. These are special people made by the law to only care about their owners. Not the community, workers, or others. \n\nThe problem with company people is they are not like us. As someone said, \"They have no soul to save and no body to put in jail.\" Some people think companies are like us: Kind, young, aggressive, etc. But companies only have one thing: Making as much money as they can. \n\nOf course, making profit is good. It makes capitalism work by giving us things we want. That's the incentive other economies lack. We know we need to care about the environment and be good members of society too. There are companies that do good for communities by making valuable things that make our lives better.\n\nThe problem is the profit motivation - there is never enough. Everyone needs money, even someone living simply. But publicly traded companies must by law put their owners' money interests above other interests. The group is a machine to make money. It must make money for its owners. It does not care about other things. It lets others deal with problems it makes. For example, it lets others protect the oil far away. It lets others build the roads the cars drive on. It does not want to pay for these things. This is called \"making others pay\". It is a hard word for scientists.\n\nA group is like a shark. It does what it is made for. It is not bad, it just does its job. But the job can hurt others. A doctor could look at the group like a sick person. They could see why it hurts others from true stories.\n\nHere is a true story: David made shirts for $14.99. But Emma who made the shirts got only $0.03. Jessica made coats for $178. But Katherine who made the coats got only $0.74. \"Cheap car radios cost very little.\" \"It's not just shoes.\" \"It's not just clothes.\" \"It's everything.\" \"We were in a country and some workers knew what we did. They said conditions in our factory were bad.\" \"Will you please meet with us?\" \"We said we would.\" \"But you can't meet workers in that country openly. You can't walk into a factory and talk to them. There are guards and police, so you must meet secretly.\" \n\n\"We were about to start the meeting when three tough-looking men came in. The company found out about our meeting and sent spies. We couldn't have the meeting. But the young workers were smart. As they left, out of sight of the spies, they put their hands under the table. I put my hand there and they gave me their pay stubs. So I would know who they were, what they were paid, and what they made in the factory.\"\n\n\"After everyone left, I looked at my hand. In my palm was a famous person's face. And on the bottom it said, 'Some money from selling this would go to children's charities.' Very touching. But the problem was, the workers who gave me this label were 13 years old.\"\n\n\"Does anyone else in your family work here?\" \"Just me.\" \"How many people do you support?\" \"Eight people?\" \"Is your pay enough?\" \"No.\" \n\n\"Let's look at it from another view. From the view of people in poor countries who are starving. The only thing they have is their cheap labor. They're saying to the world, 'Hire us. We'll work for very little pay. It will buy us food so we don't starve.' And so when a big company comes, everyone sees it as a huge help.\"\n\n\"Hey! You can't be here!\" The door was wide open. Today we will read a story about a chemical. A long time ago, a scientist made a new chemical called DDT. It could kill bugs that spread disease. At first, DDT seemed helpful. People used it to stop diseases like typhus.\n\nBut over time, people learned that DDT and other man-made chemicals could be harmful. Some chemicals can cause cancer and birth defects in people and animals. This was not good news.\n\nSome companies knew their chemicals were dangerous, but they did not tell the truth. One company made a drug to help cows make more milk. But the drug also made the cows sick. The company lied and said the drug was safe.\n\nWe now know that many man-made chemicals can hurt living things. We must be very careful with chemicals. Using too many can lead to big problems for people, animals, and the earth. The end. Once, a person said, \"I knew all the big bosses. I knew many people in towns. I knew no one wanted to make the river dirty. But the river was getting dirty. We made something that will destroy us. The traders only see money. They don't care about the environment. Brokers don't stop buying things that hurt the environment. They only think about making money for a moment. They say, 'Yeah, a town in the PE country is dirty, but this person needs to buy this thing. I get paid too.' We don't learn about the environment because no one buys or sells it. It's far away and we don't hear about it. There are bad things happening near us too. We sell live pigs. There are so many pigs in the NO state and they make the rivers dirty, but we rarely hear about that.\" \nA group once made a list of companies that broke laws in the late 20th century. A big oil company paid a big fine for spilling oil. An electric company paid a fine for cheating the government. Another oil company paid a fine for hurting the environment. A car company paid a fine for working together illegally. A computer company paid a fine for selling things illegally. A camera company paid for hurting the environment. A drug company paid for working together illegally. A food company paid for breaking food rules. A store paid a fine. Some health care companies paid fines.\nThe person said, \"Again and again, companies only follow laws if it saves them money. If breaking the law costs less than following it, they think it's just a business choice.\" It's a fair idea that every person is a moral person. We're more or less the same, but our nature allows all kinds of behavior. Everyone of us could be a kind person or a bad person under some conditions. No job has been as frustrating as the leader job. Even though it seems you have total power to do whatever you want, the reality is you don't have that power. So if you really did what you wanted to do based on your personal thoughts and priorities, you'd act differently. But as a leader, you cannot do that. Layoffs have become so common that people think leaders make these decisions without considering the human impact. It is never an easy decision for any leader. It is a tough decision, but it is the result of how things work today. When you look at a group, you want to separate the group and the individual. Some groups may be bad, but the individuals in them may be the nicest people, kind to their children and caring about others. As individuals, they may be anything. In their roles in the group, they may do bad things because the group is bad. The same is true here. One time, 25 people came to our home and hung a big sign calling us bad names. They danced outside with masks on. After talking to them for a couple of hours and offering them food and drinks, they said, \"The problem is not you. It's the group you belong to.\" I said, \"Wait, let's talk about what this group is. It's made up of people like me.\" In the end, we found we were worried about the same things: the environment, unfair rulers, human rights. The big difference was that I felt I could help make things better, but they felt they couldn't do anything. So an individual leader may really care about the environment and can use their resources for that without ignoring their responsibilities. But some groups may still do bad things to the environment and harm people who oppose them, even as they claim to care about those issues. \"Not every product can be made,\" said Adam. \"Can we make toys safely?\" asked Benjamin. \"I don't think so,\" replied Adam. \"There is a more important question about toys. Some products should not be made at all. Unless we can make rugs safely, we may not have a place in a safe world, but neither does anyone else making products unsafely.\"\n\n\"One day early in this journey, I realized that the way I had been running my business was harmful, taking something that belongs to every creature on Earth. I said to myself, 'One day, this must be against the law. People like me might end up in trouble. I need to be honest.'\"\n\n\"When the bad event happened, I didn't know, and I don't want to take it lightly. It was really bad, one of the worst things I've seen. But I will tell you, and every worker will tell you who was not there, that the first thing you thought about was, 'How much is the price up?' The first thing that came to mind was, 'It must be going up.' Fortunately, our clients made money. They all doubled their money. It was a blessing, but also devastating and heartbreaking.\"\n\n\"When the NE country bombed another country, the price of oil went up a lot. We were all excited. We wanted problems because the price would go higher. Every worker was chanting that. This was a disaster, a catastrophe happening. In devastation, there is opportunity.\"\n\n\"The pursuit of profit is an old story, but there was a time when many things were regarded as too important for the public good to be considered business opportunities. They were protected by tradition and public rules.\" It is not like when I was young or when the people who are adults now were young kids. It is more advanced and more common. The things themselves are not good or bad. The problem is tricking kids to buy the things. In the late 20th century, a study company and a research company studied nagging. They asked parents to write down every time their child nagged them for something. They wanted to know when, where, and why the nagging happened. The study was not to help parents with nagging. It was to help companies get kids to nag for their things better. Between 20 and 40 percent of buying would not have happened if the child did not nag their parents. For example, a quarter of visits to fun parks would not have happened. Four out of ten visits to kid places would not have happened. Any parent knows these places are noisy with many kids. But if the child nags enough, you will go. We saw the same with movies, home videos, and fast food. Parents say they do not like when their kid nags. But they do not always act on that. You can trick people into wanting and buying your things. It is a game. Kids are not little adults. Their minds are still growing. The selling to kids today is made by mind experts. The selling uses new technology that was not possible before. The more you know about the buyer, the better you can sell. So if that means hiring a mind expert, we want one. It is not wrong to make things for kids. It is different to sell directly to the kids. We spend about $12 billion on selling time. So we buy time on TV, in print, outside, and on radio. We are the biggest buyers of selling time in the FR country and the NE city. \"Yes,\" said Henry. \"I think if we all work together with the QR company and others, we can make this a better place.\"\n\"Okay,\" replied Alice. \"Okay, nice to see you, Miss Grace. Bye.\"\n\"There used to be a lot of crime at this train station,\" Henry explained. \"One night on my way home, I was almost robbed.\"\n\"So we decided to make a change to improve our community,\" Alice said. \"We are looking at gates that stop people from entering without paying.\"\n\"Before, people could just jump over the gates,\" Henry said. \"The QR company, together with the train company, bought these new machines.\"\n\"This box allows us to speak to the QR guard who is about 500 yards from here,\" Alice explained. \"I haven't seen the guard today, but I'll try calling them.\"\n\"Hello,\" a voice answered. \"Hello, this is Cameron speaking.\"\n\"I'm sure they'll call back later,\" Alice said. \"During off-hours, this allows passengers to call the QR desk directly for help. Then the QR guard calls the train police, and they respond to any crime situation.\"\n\"As a result, crime has gone down at this station. It's much safer for our community partners now,\" Henry said with satisfaction.\n\"Well, let's go talk to the guard in person,\" Alice suggested. \"It's tough, you know. They're spending some money to help, and who can say? But that money should be used for what the people decide. While they're doing these nice things, they're also lowering taxes for companies and wealthy people, changing public policies behind the scenes.\"\n\"We don't see all those changes happening, just the nice surface,\" Henry agreed. \"When I first researched this, I thought it was just advertising. But I realized branding is production itself. Successful companies don't produce products; they produce brand meaning and spread the idea of themselves, which is an invasive project.\"\n\"To build a brand idea, they create physical representations of the brand,\" Alice mused. \"For a company like the DI company, they even built an entire town, the CE city.\" \"What is that?\" \"You take it out you drink it down. It's there. You do not really think about it.\" \"Wow!\" \"That's good water.\" \"Who knows?\" \"Maybe someone put the water there.\" \"You go out for your break. You sit in the park. People are out there talking in the park. Then you hear another message.\" \"By the time you go to bed, you have heard many different messages.\" \"People think, 'Oh, I know about putting things in movies!'\" \"Well, yes, that's putting things in movies.\" \"But putting things in your life is just that: Putting things in movies, but the movie is your life.\" \"Take a group of people like you. They are doing something for us. They are having a drink or using soap.\" \"Whatever it may be.\" \"They are like a trap.\" \"People will come to them, and they will give them this little piece.\" \"It could be some knowledge or a ritual.\" \"You will get that piece, then you will take it.\" \"Oh, cool!\" \"Then you go out and tell your friends.\" \"If you want to be critical, if you want to question every person that walks up to you, sure, be critical.\" \"But if they are showing you something that fits and something that works and something that makes your life better, well, then who cares.\" \"We just say thanks!\" \"Today, the job of building this country is done. There are no new places within our borders. So what new things can we look at now? Where are tomorrow's chances? What's ahead for you and your children? The future is not on any map. It's in labs of the big places. The case is one of the great moments. And the people were not aware it was actually happening. A big place and a man went to the office with a little bug that eats up spills. They said they had changed this bug in the lab, and so it was a thing. The office and the country took a look at this 'thing;' they said no way. The laws don't cover living things. This is not a thing.\" Henry said, \"Then a big firm and David appealed to a court.\" \"And to everyone's surprise they said it can be patented.\" \"They said this tiny living thing looks more like a cleaning item or a chemical than an animal.\" \"I laugh because they didn't understand basic science; it looked like a chemical to them.\" \"If it had body parts like an insect it would never have been patented.\" \"Then the office appealed.\" \"And people should realize the office was clear you can't patent life.\" \"My group argued if you allow the patent on this tiny living thing it means without any guidance companies will own the blueprints of life.\" \"When they made the decision we lost and the leader said sure some things are big issues but this is a small decision.\" \"Years later the office said you can patent anything alive except a human baby.\" \"We've heard that we have mapped the human body plan.\" \"But the public doesn't know companies are trying to find the treasure in the map.\" \"The treasure is the individual parts that make up the human body plan.\" \"Every time they find a part they claim it as their idea.\" \"The breast illness part, the illness part, it goes on and on.\" \"If this goes unchallenged soon a few global companies will own the parts that make up our evolution.\" \"And they're now trying to own the body plans of every other living thing.\" \"In the age of life science, there will be people who believe life first has value and we should choose things that honour that value...\" \"And then people who believe look life is a simple thing. It's commercial and they will let the marketplace decide about the age of life science.\" \"In a world where information is filtered by big media companies focused on their advertisers, who will defend the public's right to know?\" \"And what price to preserve our ability to make informed choices?\" \"A TV channel told us we were the people to ask tough questions and get answers.\" \"So we thought this is great, this is a dream job.\" One day, a news worker said, \"We did not make any mistakes in that news story.\" \"Both sides got a chance to speak.\" \"One week later,\" \"The company sent a stronger letter.\" \"And it said there would be big trouble for the news channel if the story aired in the FL state.\" \"And this time they were very scared.\" \"They were afraid of being sued and losing money.\" \"For many news stations.\" \"That's a lot of money.\" \"For some products.\" \"So we had a battle.\" \"And the new manager, David, called us to his office. He asked, \"What if this story never aired?\" We said we would not be happy about that. He said he could stop it from airing, since he was the manager. He kept going back and forth. Finally, he blurted out, \"Will you tell anyone?\" I said I would not lie for him. About a week later, he called us back and said we must make changes. We said we had research showing the information was true. He replied, \"I don't care about that. The lawyers will decide what to write.\" I said this was important news people wanted to know. He said, \"We spent a lot of money on these stations. We decide what the news is.\" I said I would not do that. He said if I refused, I would be fired. I said I would report to the government that I was fired for refusing to lie on the public airwaves. Adam and Benjamin were workers. Their boss said, \"We will let you know soon.\"\n\nBut many days passed, and they did not hear anything. After some time, the boss called them again. \"How about we give you money, and you stop talking about this issue?\" the boss asked.\n\nBenjamin said, \"How much money? If someone wants to pay me to be quiet, I want to know if it's worth it.\"\n\nThe boss said he would pay them the same amount as their yearly salary. But they must agree to never talk about this issue again. They cannot tell anyone, even at their child's school.\n\nBenjamin said, \"Write down the offer.\" The boss did, and sent it to them. But Adam and Benjamin did not want to sign it. They wanted to share the story in a way everyone could agree on.\n\nFor many months, they rewrote the story with the lawyers. The lawyers removed or changed many parts that criticized the company or its product. They aimed to minimize any potential problems.\n\nAdam and Benjamin had to rewrite the story 83 times, which was very unusual. It seemed the company did not want to share the story and was trying to make them quit.\n\nFinally, Benjamin wrote a letter to the company's lawyer about this issue. Emma said \"You are firing us because we refused to put on the air something that we knew was false and misleading.\" \"That's what this is about.\" \"And because we fought against this big company and we stood up to your editors and lawyers.\" \"And we said to you there should be a principle higher than just making money.\" \"And she wrote a letter back and said you are right that's exactly why we're letting you go.\" \"Big mistake\" \"Big mistake\" \"That says retaliation.\" \"You can't retaliate against employees if they're standing up for something that they believe is illegal that they don't want to participate in.\" \"So that gave us the right to file a complaint against our employer.\" \"Two or three years later we went to trial.\" \"After testimony, the jury determined that the story they pressured us to broadcast was false or distorted.\" The company appealed the verdict. News companies filed briefs supporting the appeal. The Appeals Court ruled that Emma had no right to complain about news distortion. The company says the ruling vindicates them. What the company didn't report is this: Emma sued under a law protecting those who try to prevent others from breaking the law. But the Appeal Court judges found that falsifying news isn't actually against the law. So they denied Emma her right and took away her award. Some countries have banned a certain substance. But it remains hidden in the food supply of the FR country. The prospect that many people will have no access to fresh drinking water by the late 20th century has led to confrontations over control of this basic resource. When a country sought to refinance the public water services of one of its cities, a loan required privatization. So a company gained control over all of the city's water, even rainwater. The price this country paid for loans was the privatization of state industries. But the government failed to convince people that water is a commodity like any other. The country was determined to defend the company's right to charge poor families a large portion of their income for water. \"Now what happened to them?\" \"One was let go, two was moved away, four was punished, five took their own life, and six.\" \"Code six\" \"Special treatment meant being hurt or even killed.\" \"They would put that number in, and the facts were counted, and the machines were set.\" \"And of course the many cards had to be printed.\" \"And they were printed only by one company, and the profits were taken after the war.\" \"I really do not think that claim has been disproven.\" \"They used equipment, that is true, but how they got it, how much help they got, and any secret plan to connect things that are not connected is what is disproven.\" \"Usually you sell computers and they are used in many ways, and you hope they are used in good ways.\" \"If you found out they were used in bad ways, you would hope you would stop helping, but you know, do you always know? Can you always find out?\" \"That company would of course say they had no control over its country offices.\" \"But here, a letter is being written with all sorts of details of the activity of the country office. None of these machines were sold, they were all leased by that company.\" \"They had to be serviced on site once a month, even at a bad place.\" \"This is a normal contract with that country.\" \"It's not with another office, it's with the company in the home country.\" \"You know, I know that story.\" \"I talked with the old leader more than once and I was around at that time.\" \"I'm not saying that he didn't know that the country used cards.\" \"He probably did know, after all he had very few buyers.\" \"He didn't want to do it.\" \"It was not because he thought it was wrong, but because he thought it was risky.\" \"It should not surprise us that company loyalty to profits will trump their loyalty to any country.\" \"A recent report showed in one week, many companies were fined for trading with enemies of the country, including bad people.\" \"...you can roughly place any group somewhere between good and bad rule.\" \"This person makes it their job to study these things....\" \"Well, for one thing, avoid the easy idea that the mere type of rule can itself keep a country from bad rule. EDITED:\nA very big company was a useful tool for getting markets in other countries and making money. A famous general helped calm ME city for oil companies, HA city and CU city for a big bank, NI city for a business group, the DR country for sugar interests, HO city for fruit companies, and CH country for an oil company. The general also helped in the US in the late 20th century as a leader tried to help with hard times through public work and rules on big companies. \"More power to you, leader,\" \"The whole country's behind you,\" \"thrilled with hope and pride...\" But not everyone liked what the leader stood for. Big companies hated it. So in one year, some people tried to get the general in a bad plan. The plan was to form a group of soldiers to scare the government...but the general did not want to be a \"criminal for money-making\". He told what he knew to a group of important people. \"I was supposed to lead a group of 500,000 men to take over the government...\" The group found a plan to overthrow the leader. The plan included people from big companies. Today, companies are bigger than governments. Governments can't control them like before. Money-making is now more important than leaders and politicians. So money-makers and company leaders have lots of power. This does not mean leaders are not important, but money-makers are the new important people. A group called the National Security Agency had a meeting with the CIA, FBI, oil companies, and other big businesses. Young one, I will tell you a story. A wise woman once said, \"Doing good is not a big change. Companies do it to please buyers.\" Another said, \"Yes, they only do good when buyers want it. When buyers change, companies change too.\" \n\nOne said, \"Some days a company is kind like Bambi, other days fierce like Godzilla. How do we know what is truly good?\" Another asked, \"Why should companies decide what is good? That is not their job or what owners ask them to do. They are not elected to speak for us.\" \n\nOne said, \"I do not care what the car company boss thinks about car fumes. He may be smart, but I did not choose him. Only the country's leaders should decide such things, not companies.\"\n\nAnother wise one said, \"It seems companies control all now, and we are fooled. But I think there are still some free spaces. When companies focus on one thing, other things happen unseen. In every time, when lies take away dignity, people fight back and turn the tables.\"\n\n\"Even big buyers like the FR company and Emma once denied child workers. But we did not tell them Olivia was coming to testify. Olivia came and could not be stopped. The country's leaders heard her. Emma apologized and said, 'Olivia, I did not know. Now I will work with you to stop this.' That night, we made a promise with Emma.\"\n\n\"I thought it would be easy, but for every answer, there are five more questions.\" A big store and a famous woman went back to bad working spaces. But this was on TV for weeks. This event made people know about child workers and bad pay. Someone wanted to look at the laws that made this happen. They wanted to know who can stop them. The laws are not forever. Most places have rules to stop them.\n\nFor a long time, big companies were allowed to go against the people's voice here and everywhere. But today, a group of lawyers and 29 others are fighting back. They want the head lawyer to follow the rules and take away the charter of a big oil company for its bad actions. This rule is well-known and can be used. It means the oil company will be broken up and its things sold to others who will do better.\n\nThis is just saying bad things. This company has been here for over 100 years and has many jobs. It has made mistakes but paid for them. But calling it a bad name is like going back 50 years. \n\nA group of people who don't make anything are very angry at this company. From its bad actions against people overseas to lying to courts and people, this company is an example of companies doing bad things and having too much power. It can't do business in that country without helping the bad leaders there.\n\nThe bad thing is that making these films can change things, so the person keeps making them.\n\nEvery year the person gives companies a hard time, but at this holiday time they reach out to a cigarette company. They went to a place where a school shooting happened and learned the main job there is making weapons. A parent said to their spouse, \"We are children of factory workers in a city. None of us ever thought that making cars is the biggest reason why the ice is melting and will end our way of life. We never connected that building cars, which is good for people, also harms the world.\"\n\nIn a town, many people voted to discuss if democracy is possible with big companies having so much money and power. They also voted to form a group to make sure companies are controlled by the people. \n\nA person said, \"Companies are not accountable to the democratic process. That is what this is about. I don't want to make decisions about everything in their company. But I believe they need to be accountable to us. If we don't like certain products like a soda or bank, we can choose not to use them. That's people power to me.\"\n\nAnother person said, \"If we use the model of boycott and voting with our dollars, that's undemocratic since they have more money and votes than us. What are we afraid of? Will all businesses leave our town? I don't think so. And if they did, we'd deal with it or do something different. We're creative people. I don't see why we are afraid.\"\n\nA different person said, \"If you think it's tough deciding where to buy things now, imagine if there's only one provider and it's the government. And you can't have this discussion in those communities either. People fear their government, but they should understand they can participate in government, not in what companies do. So don't fear the government.\" \"In the eyes of many, I'm a kind of hero,\" Adam said. \"But the first big change is not working. It is not good. We must have another, better change and get it right this time.\"\n\n\"When I think of what could be,\" Adam continued, \"I see a group of people with a purpose - to do no harm. I see a company that uses materials over and over again with clean energy. That is our plan - to have no bad effects on the world.\"  \n\n\"We need to undo things to do this hard work the best way. People need to come together and learn things we don't know,\" Adam explained. \"That is the most exciting thing. It's happening everywhere now.\"\n\n\"After we beat the GA company, I looked at their stores across the NE city. All that building stuff, all those workers, all those clothes. They have so much power. But we can still reach these companies and have an effect. We can change the government. That's how we will rethink what money and property can do.\"\n\n\"Fifteen big companies would like to control our lives, but millions say we don't need you. We can do better. We will create systems that help the world and people. These are not small tries, they are the main thing in many places across the world. That is where the future is,\" Adam said.\n\n\"It's funny that I can do all this on networks owned by big companies. They put me out there because millions want to see my work and they will make money. They don't believe in anything, just making money.\" A small person said, \"I have been able to share my works because of a flaw in the system that allows rich people to sell things to make money, even if it goes against their own interests. I am part of that system.\"\n\nThe person hopes that when people see their works or a famous drama, they will not just watch and do nothing. The person believes that some people will leave and take action to make the world better.\n\nIn the past, building new places in the country was finished. There were no new areas to explore within the borders. Now, the new areas to explore are in science labs and big companies.\n\nThere was an important court case about a small living thing that could clean up oil spills. A big company and a scientist said they had changed this living thing in a lab, so it was an invention they could get a patent for. At first, the patent office said no, you cannot patent living things.\n\nBut after appeals, the court said the living thing looked more like a chemical than a plant or animal, so they allowed the patent. The patent office argued that if you allow patenting this living thing, it means companies will own the blueprints of life without any public discussion.\n\nThe court decided in a close 5-4 vote that this was a small decision, even though there were big issues. Long ago, a DK country office said you can patent anything alive except a full birth person. We have all heard we mapped the human plan. But people do not know there is now a great race by groups to find the treasure in the map. The treasures are the single parts that make up the plan of the people race. Every time they capture a part and separate it, these groups claim it as their own. The bad thing part, the sick part, it goes on and on. If this goes on, in less than 10 years a few big groups will own the actual parts that make up the evolution of our people. And they are now starting to patent the plans of every other creature on this world. In the age of science, the politics will decide between those who believe life first has value itself and we should choose ways that honor the value itself...And then we will have people who believe look life is a simple tool. It is business stuff and they will agree to let the marketplace be the final decider of all of the age of science. In a world economy where information is filtered by big TV groups very aware of their powerful sellers who will defend the people's right to know? And what price must be paid to keep our ability to make informed choices? What a TV group told us was that we were just the people to be the investigators. Do any stories you want, ask tough questions and get answers. So we thought this is great, this is a dream job. The first thing they had us do was not to research stories but to shoot this call which was...The Investigators. Uncovering the truth, getting results, protecting you. One of the first stories Jane came up with was the revelation that most of the milk in the ST state and throughout much of the country was changed with the effects of cow growth chemical with a company. I did not realize how effectively a group could work to get something on the marketplace. The levels of working together they had to have. They had to get university teachers into the fold. They had to get experts into the fold. They had to get reporters into the fold. They had to get the people into the fold and of course the big office lets not leave them out. They had to get the federal regulators convinced that this was a fine and safe product to get it onto the marketplace. Emma and Alice did that very well. A special product is now ready for you to use. It can help you make more money. The government allowed it to be sold quickly. They only tested it on 30 animals for a short time. The company may have given wrong information to the government. Scientists in another country had different conclusions about the product. They said it could be unsafe for people's health, but that conclusion was removed from their report. There were worries about secrets and conspiracies. We have been pressured to approve possibly unsafe drugs. We had a story ready about farmers saying the product is safe, but studies suggest it could cause cancer. Before the story aired, a lawyer sent a letter saying false things about the story. The managers were afraid of being sued and losing money from advertisements. They decided not to air the story after getting a second threatening letter. A new manager, Adam, was involved in the decision. Adam worked at a news station. The manager called Adam and said, \"What if I killed this story? What if it never aired?\" Adam said they would not be happy about that. The manager said he could kill it since he was the manager. He asked if Adam would tell anyone. Adam said he would not lie. \n\nLater, the manager told Adam to make changes to the story. Adam showed research that the information was not true. The manager did not care and said to write it how the lawyers wanted. Adam said it was important news that people wanted to know. The manager said they paid a lot of money for the stations, so they decide what the news is.\n\nThe manager threatened to fire Adam if he did not present the story their way. Adam said he would report to the government that he was fired for refusing to lie. The manager did not reply at first. Then he offered to pay Adam to leave and not talk about the story or the station's actions. Adam asked how much, as someone offering a bribe might make it worth it. The manager would pay the rest of Adam's salary if Adam agreed to never talk about the story again, anywhere. Adam wondered if he could even explain it at school meetings. A adult said, \"If you ever found out they're used in ways that are not good then you would hope you would stop supporting that. But can you always know? Can you always find out?\" Another adult said, \"A big company would of course say they had no control over its country subsidiaries. But here a letter is being written directly to a boss with all sorts of detail of the activity of the country subsidiary. None of these machines were sold. They were all leased by the company. They had to be serviced on site once a month even if that was at a camp. This is a typical contract with the company and the late 20th century country. It's not with the country subsidiary. It is with the company in NE city.\"\n\nThe first adult said, \"I know that story. I discussed it more than once with an old boss and I was around at that time. I'm not saying that the boss didn't know that the country government used cards. The boss probably did know. The boss didn't want to do it. It was not because the boss thought it was wrong but because the boss thought it was risky.\" The first adult went on, \"It should not surprise us that company allegiance to profits will trump their allegiance to any flag. A recent country report revealed in one week alone many companies were fined for trading with official enemies of the country including bad people.\"\n\nThe second adult said, \"You can locate any place somewhere along a scale from good to bad. This person makes it their job to study these things. For one thing, avoid the idea that the mere form of government can protect a country against bad things. For big companies, bad things were often useful for securing markets and pursuing profits.\" The second adult talked about a famous soldier who helped make peace in many countries for companies. \n\nThe second adult also said, \"The soldier's services were also needed in the country in the late 20th century as a leader sought to relieve the misery through public work and to offer rules on company misdeeds. More power to you, leader. The entire country's behind you. Thrilled with hope.\" But the second adult said, \"The country was not entirely behind the leader. Large parts of the companies despised what the leader stood for.\" A long time ago, some people wanted to form a group of veterans to scare the government. But they chose the wrong person to lead them. That person went to a meeting to tell what they knew about the plan to set up a bad government. The meeting found evidence of a plot to remove the leader.\n\nAccording to that person, the plot involved some big companies. But today, companies have more power than governments did before. Companies have gone all over the world, so governments have less control over them now than they used to.\n\nCapitalism is now more powerful than politics and politicians. Company leaders have a lot of power and influence. This does not mean government is not important, but company leaders are like the new leaders.\n\nOne person went to a meeting with government groups like the CIA and companies like Coca-Cola. This showed how much the government and companies work together now.\n\nOnce, many people came together to oppose a plan that would let companies control everything. But the business groups did not care about the people protesting. \"That point at the top means no bad things...\" \"We need to change many things to do this hard work the best way we can.\" \"That means people coming together and learning new things we don't know. Things that we forgot.\" \"That is the most exciting thing.\" \"It is happening all over the world now.\" \"Sometimes it surprises me how much you can do.\"\n\n\"After we beat the big store, I walked past these big stores and looked at them. I thought, 'Look at all the concrete, glass, workers, and clothes. Look at that power.'\" \"You can still reach these companies. You can still make a change.\" \"We can change the government. That's the only way we can rethink what businesses can do.\"\n\n\"Many companies want to control our lives, but lots of people say, 'We don't need you. We can do better.' We will create things that help the earth and people.\" \"These are not small experiments. Many communities around the world do this.\" \"That is where the future is.\"\n\n\"It's funny that I can do all this, but I use networks owned by big companies. Why would they let me talk when I disagree with them? Why do they pay me to disagree with them? It's because they want to make money. They know many people want to see my shows, so they let me talk. I'm able to share my ideas because of this flaw in businesses - their greed. The rich will sell you the rope to hang themselves if they can make money. I'm the rope, or part of it.\"\n\n\"They think when people see my shows, they won't do anything because they've made people's minds dull and confused. People won't take action. They're sure of that.\" \"I think the other way,\" said Emma. \"I think some people will do something after this. They will get up and do anything to make the world better,\" said Gabriel.", "hash": "939143a040f15e3273ff0014bcc8c449afe126d2ecd731f89cff021dbebc42a3"}

Running free!\" \"Be quiet so he can talk!\" \"This is my place!\" \"I'll say what I please!\" \"It's safe here.\" \"It is not safe here! There's a cop here.\" \"Yes, two cops.\" \"Wait. You're a cop?\" \"I was.\" \"Be quiet, Matthew!\" \"It's not safe here! I'm not staying\" \"It's all right. It's okay.\" \"Nothing. Is she okay?\" \"Hannah. Hannah, will you...?\" \"Stop it. Don't do this now. What are you doing?\" Put your arm around your girlfriend.\" \"Actually, she's my wife.\" \"Everyone just stay here. Stay in this room.\" \"Wait! I'm not staying here if he is.\" \"Yes, you are.\" \"No, I'm not. I'm not.\" \"All right. Matthew? Come with us. Why?\" \"You know the place.\" \"Here's what I know. I'm not a cop. I don't take orders from an unprofessional woman!\" \"Bad word!\" \"Listen. Just stay here, please. Keep everyone calm. He's not going to get too far. Not in this!\" \"Patrick! What are we chasing here?\" Emily and Benjamin were a married couple. One evening, there was a heavy rain outside. Emily and Benjamin had an argument. Emily accused Benjamin of being unfaithful and lied that she was pregnant to test his loyalty. Benjamin denied the accusation and demanded Emily to open the door. Emily refused until Benjamin calmed down. Benjamin became very angry and started banging on the door, demanding Emily to open it. The situation escalated with shouting and violence. \"Oliver, please stop!\" \"Oliver?\" \"Oh, my goodness!\" \"Oh, my goodness!\" \"Oh, my goodness!\" \"Help me!\" \"Somebody help me!\" \"Help me!\" \"Help me!\" \"Help me!\" \"Somebody help me!\" \"Is he in there?\" \"Is he in there?\" \"Is he in there?\" \"Charlotte, are you okay?\" \"What happened?\" \"What happened?\" \"What happened?\" \"Oh, no.\" \"Oliver?\" \"Oliver?\" \"Oliver?\" \"What is going on?\" \"What is wrong?\" \"Oh, no!\" \"Come here!\" \"They caught him.\" \"They caught him.\" \"They caught him.\" \"Why are we keeping him here? Where would you like, Matthew?\" \"I do not know.\" \"I told you to stay in 3, didn't I? Did I tell you that? They fought! I tried to get them to go back inside! Should we try the radio again? Matthew, just stay here and watch him. Go back and look after Charlotte. Where are you going? Just do it, please. David? I don't know if I'm comfortable with guard duty. He is unconscious, Matthew. He is tied to a post. Benjamin. Alice? Oh, my goodness. Alice? I don't remember anything. We had an accident. Frank? Can you keep an eye on Charlotte for a minute? She is awake now. I have to get some medicine to help her. Darling, I have to go get something out of my room. Oh, no! What's wrong, friend? What do you have in the fridge? You be quiet. What's in there? What's in there? What do you have in there? Be quiet. What is it? Be quiet. You can tell me. I'm good at keeping secrets. I have a big one myself. What are you doing? Bad person! What are you doing out here? Getting my stuff. What are you doing? What, I don't get to ask a question? I'm taking pictures. There were two bad things. Before all the signs. That's not an answer. You're a car driver. What are you doing? Looking to win some \"beyond the call of duty,\" car driver badge? You're not working anymore. \"You do not need to be a hero,\" said Alice. \"There is a real police officer outside.\"\n\"The one who lost a bad person?\" asked Benjamin. \"You are a complicated person, Edward.\"\n\"No,\" said Edward. \"Not really. I think so.\"\n\"What month were you born?\" asked Benjamin.\n\"May,\" answered Edward.\n\"Taurus,\" said Alice. \"Same as me.\"\n\"Where were you a police officer?\" asked Benjamin.\n\"The LA city,\" answered Edward.\n\"Were you fired or did you quit?\"\n\"I took a break because I was sick,\" said Edward. \"I burned out, I guess. It was too hard for me.\"\n\"One day I got a call about a sad person,\" continued Edward. \"A young woman. She was very sick and sad. I asked her to come with me, but she asked why she should keep living. I could not think of a good reason to tell her. So she jumped off and died. I started getting headaches and feeling very bad. So I stopped being a police officer.\"\n\"Rhodes!\" cried Benjamin. \"It's worse. Nothing but noise!\"\n\"Where is that key from the actress?\"\n\"This was on the kid,\" said Alice, holding up a key. \"What is it? Some kind of countdown?\"\n\"Larry!\" shouted Benjamin. \"What are you doing?\"\n\"I just went to get something,\" said Larry.\n\"We told you to watch the man. What are you doing in your office?\" asked Benjamin angrily.\n\"I just went to get something,\" repeated Larry.\n\"How many keys are there to this place?\" demanded Benjamin.\n\"Two and a master set,\" answered Larry.\n\"You killed him!\" cried Benjamin. \"Why did you kill my prisoner?\"\n\"I didn't do that!\" cried Larry. \"Check the doors!\" \"I did not do it!\" \"Look at Adam!\" \"Why did you hurt Adam?\" \"Why were you outside?\" \"Why did you leave Adam?\" \"I was scared.\" \"What were you scared of?\" \"You would not understand.\" \"Try to tell me.\" \"Why did you hurt my friend?\" \"I did not!\" \"I do not know how-- I went to my office, that is all!\" \"Why did you leave Adam?\" \"Is this your key?\" \"Number 8?\" \"Ten, nine, eight, hmm?\" \"This is your key!\" \"You cannot say that!\" \"Those are not my keys!\" \"That is like leading the witness or something.\" \"Look.\" \"These are my keys, okay?\" \"These are my keys.\" \"You see?\" \"You have a nice wallet?\" \"It is the actress's.\" \"Yes, I took her wallet.\" \"After she died!\" \"After, all right?\" \"I did not hurt her.\" \"And I did not hurt Adam.\" \"Let Diana go, Liam.\" \"Get back!\" \"You will not pin this on me.\" \"Thomas? Get Adam out of here! Put it down. I did not hurt anybody. No one! But I do not like bad people! If you take one more step--\" Get it off! Come on, you little one. Please start. Hey! Liam, stop! What is going on? Liam! Get out of my way, I did not do anything! Thomas!\" \"Thomas!\" \"Thomas!\" The court did not allow my friend to say he was unwell despite the fact that my friend is very unwell. To this day, he remains unaware of the things he was found guilty of. In the late 20th century, the court ruled that people cannot be punished if they do not understand why. He wrote his story. He not just wrote it, he told it. Thirdly, a notebook with important writings was misfiIed. Your Honor, this notebook contains writings made just before the bad things happened. It is important to note the big changes in writing style. What you are looking at are the private thoughts of several different people. With permission, a doctor will explain more. Thank you. Your Honor, there is no good way to treat the sickness of having multiple people in one body. There is a town called FR place. \"They grow oranges.\" \"The name is like a message.\" \"I was happy the day I left PO place.\" \"Why would you want to go back?\" \"I found an orange garden for sale on the computer.\" \"Nine fields, 1200 trees.\" \"Limes and oranges.\" \"The person who helps sell houses says the soil needs some work, but it is good land.\" \"What?\" \"It sounds nice.\" \"Ed?\" \"She is gone.\" \"Get him away from here.\" \"Come on.\" \"Come on, little one.\" \"Look at this.\" \"Where did you get that?\" \"Right here.\" \"This does not make sense.\" \"She died from an accident.\" George was an accident, if you believe Larry. Where is seven? Back away! See, I told you it was not me! That is not possible. I was standing right there. I saw what happened. We all saw what happened. He ran out. No one could have known he was going to do that. No human person. We are back to that again? It is the spirits, yes? Maybe it is the ghost of the person that Larry put in the cold box. Someone untie me. You know it was not me. Come on. Listen. We have to get out. Listen. We have to get out. Take her car and get out. You, her and the child. There is nowhere to go. How much gas do you have? Half a tank. You can drive until morning on that. Look at me. When you get to where it is wet, go the other way. I do not know if I can. Get the child and go. Right now. Come on. Timmy. Timmy, come on. Let's go. Get up. What is happening? They cannot leave! This way. We will see you when the storm stops. Hey! Hey! They cannot leave! Where are they going? Get back here! Go, go, go! They are leaving. They are not leaving. Go! You cannot let people leave after four people have gone away! You really think they are the ones who did it? They are not leaving! \"Gabriel!\" \"Fire tools.\" \"Kevin, you got a fire tool?\" \"Fire tool!\" \"Where?\" \"Back there!\" \"Nobody in there.\" \"Maybe it got so hot, they got burned up.\" \"There'd be something left.\" \"You did this.\" \"You did this!\" \"You told them to get into the car!\" \"Are you happy?\" \"Where is he?\" \"Nothing.\" \"I give up!\" \"I give up!\" \"I give up!\" \"What the big problem do you want?\" \"What do you want, you sick person?\" \"What the big problem do you want from us?\" \"I am turning 30 next week and I just want to go home and grow oranges!\" \"It's your birthday next week?\" \"It's my birthday next week.\" \"The 10th.\" \"Me too.\" \"Me too.\" \"Me too.\" \"Yes.\" \"Henry, May 10.\" \"Alice, May 10.\" \"Charlotte, May 10.\" \"Grace and Nora, May 10.\" \"Me, Kevin, May 10 too.\" \"What are the odds?\" \"Must be very very small.\" \"What is it?\" \"Where's the power box, Kevin?\" \"Other side of the building.\" \"Grace and Nora.\" \"Charlotte. NE city.\" \"Henry. Kevin. RI place. ED place. When I was going up the stairs I met a man who wasn't there. He wasn't there again today. I wish he'd go away. Who is this? Who am I speaking to right now? Where did you learn that poem? Who am I speaking to? Look at me. Who am I speaking to right now? Doctor? Edward? What's happening? Please be quiet. He can hear what we're saying? Of course I can hear what you're talking. Edward, you missed your last visit. Where have you been? Did I black out again? Try and think back. Where have you been? All right. I was driving this actress and we got stuck at the motel. There was a storm. We couldn't get out because of the storm. What happened at the motel? People started dying. And then their bodies-- It didn't make sense. They disappeared. Edward, I'd like to show something to you, if I may. Do you know this man? One was bad and the others were good. They are not real. The bad thing in him is gone. This person needs help in a place with doctors. This person should not be hurt. This person will get help from a kind doctor.\n\nEarly in the morning, bad things make noise at me. But that is not how I was made. I want you. I want you so much.\n\nThomas. No, please do not. No, Thomas, please do not. What is wrong, Oliver?\n\nBad people do not get another chance. When I went up the stairs, I saw a person who was not there. That person was not there again today. I wish that person would go away.", "hash": "7018ba3b7bf7a71e99be6c8650df095c5a2e155b190c200950b5f9dff947c871"}
{"text": "\"At the time, I thought it was the illness in my parent that made them unwell,\" said Adam. \"When is Frank leaving?\" asked Benjamin. \"In a couple days,\" replied Adam. \"I don't know what to do.\" \"Cameron always fixes everything,\" said Benjamin. \"You should tell the doctor the truth,\" advised Benjamin. \"Tell them you have a friend who really needs some medicine,\" suggested Benjamin. \"Alright,\" agreed Adam. \"How many times have you seen the doctor now?\" asked Benjamin. \"Three,\" said Adam. \"What do you talk about?\" questioned Benjamin. \"About my childhood,\" replied Adam. \"You like the doctor?\" asked Benjamin. \"That's good,\" said Benjamin. \"How many more times does the doctor expect you to come?\" asked Benjamin. \"The doctor doesn't say,\" answered Adam. \"It must be costing you,\" said Benjamin. \"No, it's okay,\" assured Adam. \"It's a funny idea, paying someone to listen to your childhood,\" remarked Benjamin. \n\nAdam and Benjamin saw some birds in the meadow. \"I wonder if animals ever feel sad,\" pondered Adam. \"Oh, they must, right?\" said Benjamin. \"They must have moods. Maybe it's just natural. We should relax and let it be,\" said Benjamin. \"David,\" said Adam. \"I saw a wild animal today. It was a stunning creature. The way it moved...\" said Adam. \"I might ask Emma to marry me,\" confided Adam. \"Marry you? David, really?\" responded Benjamin in surprise. \"Emma is a gentle person. She's very thoughtful. She cares,\" explained Adam. \"You pay her to care. David, you should not confuse work with romance,\" cautioned Benjamin. \"Cameron and I will keep you company. And we need you now more than ever,\" assured Benjamin.\n\nLater, David offered Adam some water. Adam thanked him and drank the water. David noticed Adam was awake and asked if he couldn't sleep. Adam explained he had just moved to NE city for a new job and was staying the night. He mentioned he had a law degree but was hired by a government agency despite not being a qualified accountant. Adam apologized for crying earlier. \"I'm so sad.\" \"That's why I drink so much water.\" \"I won't have any fluids left in me.\" \"Have you ever felt down?\" \"I've always felt down.\" \"Always felt down?\" \"Always.\" \"You've always felt down.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"The first time for me.\" \"I don't know how you can stand it.\" \"Well, I guess I'm used to it.\" \"I don't even know how I got here.\" \"Do you know what started it?\" \"Oh, I guess it started when I was 6.\" \"Came home from school, and my mother was very sad.\" \"No.\" \"Yes.\" \"You saw her like that?\" \"At the front door.\" \"It was strange, because I was carrying a pyramid I'd made in school out of special paper...\" \"And I opened the door and saw her.\" \"I may have felt down even before that.\" \" You make me feel better. \" No. \" Yes. \" Good reason like that. \" Oh, I think I'm sick.\" \"I am cold.\" \"I'm freezing.\" \"This is a bad thing to say but sometimes I think being gone would be easier.\" \"You will be gone very soon. Your life will be over in a flash. Is that... Mr. Benjamin?\" \" Who?\" \" It's Emma. Good morning. Would you mind if I tried your bag?\" Tried it out? Yeah, okay. What are you doing? \" My name isn't Adam. It's Emma. I'm rolling my coins. A big colorful hot-air balloon just went over the hill. Today is the balloon party. You just missed it, Dad. No, we don't think it's anything serious. He might not be back at work for a couple of days. Just wanted to let you know. Sure. By the way, he's an excellent and polite worker. I highly recommend him. Very courteous. Okay, I'll check in with you later. Bye. Can I help you? This is something an important person would like, don't you think? I think so. \" What's that? \" A book for appointments. A book for appointments. Perfect. I'll take it. He makes lots of appointments. You know what's really strange? A parent got a credit card in the mail. It was easy to miss because it came in a plain envelope. The parent was worried they accidentally threw it away. Another parent named Adam felt bad for their friend David. David's car was completely stripped of parts. They wondered if Rachel got a credit card too. There was some bad news about a psychiatrist, though the details were unclear. \n\nAdam was hiding in the outhouse, depressed and refusing to come out. The other parent pleaded with Adam to come out, saying Adam was being selfish by wallowing in self-pity. The parent reminded Adam that humility prevents humiliation, and everyone gets depressed sometimes. The parent suggested they try having another child together, since their daughter Emma couldn't stay little forever. \n\nAfter three days of being feverish, David finally responded, squeezing the parent's hand so tightly they couldn't hold a coffee mug or turn a key for a week. The parent's grandmother, from the NE country, had given herbal remedies to help David. Alice asked, \"Is that the first bear you have ever seen?\"\nBenjamin said, \"You got a good view, yes?\" \nCharlotte replied, \"He has been looking for our honey all summer.\"\nDavid said, \"He broke a couple of our hives.\"\nEthan added, \"We will get good food from him.\"\nFrank announced, \"Listen everyone, I have news to share.\"\nGabriel said, \"I am going to school this fall.\"\nHenry explained, \"I am joining the public school.\"\nIsaac thought, \"I will rinse off in the river.\"\nJack agreed, \"Good idea.\"\nKevin said, \"You can go to public school if you want.\"\nLiam replied, \"I am going.\"\nMatthew asked, \"Bo?\"\nNathan said, \"What?\"\nOliver suggested, \"Let's do something fun this afternoon, just you and me. Let's have a picnic.\"\nPatrick asked, \"Why?\"\nQuentin answered, \"I'm busy.\"\nRyan proposed, \"We can visit the library, drop off books, maybe see a movie.\"\nSamuel questioned, \"Movie, why?\"\nThomas explained, \"Just because.\"\nUlysses said, \"I'm going to school.\"\nVictor understood, \"I know. Help me finish with the bear, and we will pack a picnic and go.\"\nWilliam asked, \"Did you clean it already?\"\nXavier confirmed, \"Yes.\"\nYosef shared, \"I saw your letter in yesterday's paper.\"\nZachary asked, \"My letter?\"\nAlice wondered, \"To 'Ask Beth'? They printed it?\"\nBenjamin confirmed, \"Yes.\"\nCharlotte exclaimed, \"Oh, it's published?\"\nDavid said, \"Yes.\"\nEthan asked, \"Do you have a copy?\"\nFrank answered, \"I do. We will read it together.\"\nGabriel expressed, \"My heart is racing.\"\nHenry agreed, \"Mine too.\"\nIsaac said, \"I will go look for him. I will find him, do not worry.\"\nJack finished, \"Bye.\" \"I am sad.\" \"I'm so sad.\" \"Why did this happen to me?\" \"Wrestle with me, Adam.\" \"What?\" \"Wrestle with me.\" \"Come on, we'll go out in the yard.\" \"I don't want to wrestle with you.\" \"Please.\" \"No.\" \"Why not?\" \"Because.\" \"Because why?\" \"I'm wearing nice clothes.\" \"Oh, that's why?\" \"I'm meeting someone.\" \"What?\" \"I'm meeting someone.\" \"Thank you, Adam.\" \"Thank you so much.\" \"Don't let me go, Adam.\" \"Oh, no.\" \"Don't let me go.\" \"Oh, no.\" \nBo. Your painting is done. It's beautiful.\nWilliam's long painting of the planet's curve was almost as big as my room. He hung it so that when I lay on my back, I could see far to the horizon in any direction. \nSurrounded by water, I would turn and float on my back with my arms out, and feel the rounded curve of the planet supporting me.\nBy loving each other truly and serving our Lord sincerely, may you see your children's children. And after a long life, may you go to heaven. Amen.\nWe lost Adam that summer. He and Charlotte settled in MX town where Adam was told he'd been elected mayor without knowing he was on the ballot.\nI give you a companion, not a servant. Love her as Christ loves the Church.\nI missed him very much. In the custom, you can kiss the bride.\nNo! Bo. He can't move! Sweetheart... No, he can't move! I don't want him to move! He'll come visit us. He should be here now! He's late! Sweetheart, he's on his honeymoon. But it's Daddy's birthday, he's never missed Daddy's birthday. Bo, I'm surprised, you've never shown this much care for him. You're always teasing Adam. He's my godfather!\nYes, he's your godfather. And he will always be your godfather. Not if he moves to MX. I want Adam. Well, I think he would be very touched to see you so upset. He won't even take me fishing anymore.", "hash": "0a4adf714d8d9a5f98486c5777e0aac54d8286af2e64d70d9f3970ca720788ba"}

How can I accept that I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not to kiss you now? Kiss me. What? Kiss me. Friend, it doesn't say that. No, I'm saying it. Just don't talk. Well, that's new. Hi, this is Thomas in room 206. Um, I've forgotten a couple of things. \"Thank you, Nathan.\" \"This is great!\" \"I got you something from VT state.\" \"What is it?\" \"Oh, my!\" \"Maple sweets.\" \"That's so nice of you.\" \"That's odd, it's empty.\" \"Hi, you all.\" \"What's happening?\" \"Do you all want to play, or...?\" \"Do you all hear a buzzing sound?\"", "hash": "a0d388a9b514bd334cd925babfd9281f398f6094defe0b34ec3a9cd42248fa21"}

You understand?\" Do you remember the bad things? I remember that a city is the capital of a place. Are you the person who did bad things to some people? That's my birthday. Who am I speaking to right now? What should I call you? Call me whatever you want. \"Adam?\" \"Adam?\" \"Adam?\" \"Adam, are you awake?\" Yes, as a matter of fact, I am awake. I'm sorry to bother you at home but there will be a late night meeting about a case. The defense found something new in the evidence, a diary. They argued that it was hidden. What are you talking about? There's no media. This all happened secretly. The person being held left a while ago from a place. Left that place? What do you mean? What person? The diary gave them a chance to argue insanity again. They need the person present, so they made him sleep, put him on a vehicle. They're taking this bad person to a meeting the night before his time is done. How did you let that happen? Would anyone like to play another round? Let's get another puzzle. What do we have? \"Things at Home\" is the thing. Buy a vowel. Buy a vowel. Pick up that piece. Buy a vowel, you silly person. I'd like to buy a vowel. An E. One E. All right, some money left. N. Buy a vowel. Buy another vowel. \"Yes!\" \"An I.\" \"I want to answer.\" \"Okay.\"\n\"Dog food.\" \"They are hurt.\" \"They are hurt.\" \"They are hurt.\" \"Oh no.\"\n\"What happened?\" \"An accident happened.\" \"We had an accident.\"\n\"Bad weather is coming to NE city.\" The radar showed a bad storm with lightning coming from PE and LA counties.\"\n\"We could get strong winds...\" \"Four times ten equals...\" \"Four times ten...\"\n\"Matthew, please do not do that now. We want to hear about the storm.\"\n\"Are you sure you do not want me to drive?\" \"No. I will drive us to Anderson, then you can drive after we eat.\"\n\"If the car spins, pump the brakes firmly. Look in the mirror and slowly stop the car.\"\n\"Are you okay, honey? Matthew?\"\n\"Wear seat belts, wear seat belts, wear seat belts.\"\n\"It is a shoe.\" \"What?\"\n\"It is a shoe!\"\n[A children's song].\n\"Oh no!\"\n\"Why did we not get a better spare tire?\" \"Do you know how much new tires cost, Alice?\"\n\"Honey, do not get upset. If the point is to send Matthew to a good school, it is not important to worry about new tires.\"\n\"Alice? Alice?...What can I do to help?\"\n\"Nothing. I am okay, but thank you.\"\n\"Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Alice? What have you done?\"\n\"What have you done? What have you done? What have you done?\"\n\"Hi, Henry. Let me explain. I left the movie set, okay? They will say I broke my contract but they did not follow my deal. They put me in a bad hotel...\"\n\"Oh dear. I think I have a spare battery in my bag. Excuse me?\"\n\"I have a spare battery in my bag in the front, next to you.\"\n\"I do not see anything...\" \"Just look! It is in the side pocket of the Louis bag on top. Just look! Oh no!\"\n\"What have you done? What have you done?\"\n\"No, silly!\" \"Are you in charge?\" asked Patrick. \"Yes,\" replied David. \"I am an officer named David. I am bringing a person here.\" \"The rules say you can refuse us, but the roads are flooded,\" said David. \"I need a room. It is an emergency.\"\n\n\"Do you have a radio in your vehicle?\" David asked. \"Who are you?\" asked a person. \"I drive a vehicle and had an accident,\" they replied. \"A person is hurt badly. I need an ambulance.\" \n\nDavid tried calling for help on the radio several times, but there was no response. \"It has been like this for the past hour,\" he said. \"The hurt person is losing a lot of blood.\" \n\n\"Do you have medical supplies?\" David asked. There were only small bandages. \"How about a needle and thread?\" David wondered if they could find some in the dining area.\n\nThe dining area was locked, but David said he would get the key. He got David a room and said he could check on the hurt person later and give a second opinion.\n\n\"This situation is difficult,\" someone commented rudely. David ignored them. He found some thread and bandaged the hurt person's wound. The hurt person seemed to be stable but needed help.\n\nDavid noticed a young boy who had not spoken since the accident. The boy's stepfather explained the boy did not talk much since his father left a few years ago, after having anger issues.\n\nDavid secured the person he had brought and said he would take turns trying to call for help on the radio if needed. The other person declined David's offer to help with the radio calls. \"Are you going to arrest me, officer?\" \"What?\" \"How did you do that?\" \"How did you know I was a police officer?\" \"No, really.\" \"Just snacks for dinner, huh?\" \"That does not seem right.\" \"Do you have a better idea?\" \"I worked in the food service.\" \"Maybe the restaurant is open.\" \"I could...\" \"Do you have change for a dollar?\" \"I do not know.\" \"Let me see.\" \"Here you go.\" \"Do you have a name?\" \"Adam.\" \"Adam, huh? I will get it. Never been. Well, you are not going tonight. Please. Please be strong. You see, David and I we need you. We need you so much. Gabriel? Gabriel? Gabriel? You need to tell them, Henry, that I cannot work, I cannot perform, I cannot shine living in an environment like that. No, it is not about the money. It is about the working conditions. One place. One place. No place. One place. Two places. Come on. Come on. Here we go. There you go. Come on. Bad dry area! Oh, no! I just had it. Oh no. Jesus, Mother of God. Who is this? The woman I was driving. What are you doing? There is something in there. Use this, friend. Are you a police officer? I was. Was she in Room 10? I am. Where is your partner? Handcuffed to a toilet. Bad person. That was a long drive. Gentlemen. Your Honor. Ready, Victoria? Alright. In the matter of Rivers v. NV country, for the purposes of... Judge Xavier, sir, with due respect, we should wait until my client arrives. He has a right to be present. He has very few rights. He is 24 hours from execution. But to demonstrate his mental state, which is the purpose... His mental state? His mental state? His mental state? Do you know what time it is? You think I have time for nonsense? That the judges called me in the middle of the night to review a case I already sat on, that I already decided, may make you happy. But it makes me angry. When your boy gets here, do what you want, but in the name of decency state your case! Yes, sir. \"Somebody get me a cup of coffee, black.\" \"All right, everybody!\" \"Listen up!\" \"There was a problem tonight.\" \"That's police talk for, \"Something bad happened.\"\" \"David!\" \" Grace was hurt.\" \" What?\" \" Who's Grace?\" - The famous actress I was driving.\" \"\"And where exactly did that happen?\" \"We don't know, because we can't find her body.\" \"Not all of it anyway.\" - What do you mean, you can't find it? - Stay calm. Everything will be all right. Officer Thomas is outside. He was transporting a person. - Who escaped. - What are you...? - Hold on. - Running free! Will you shut up so he can talk? This is my place! I'll say what I please! - It's safe here. - It is not safe here! - There's a cop here. - Yeah, two cops. Wait. You're a cop? - I was. Shut up, David! - It's not safe here! I'm not staying... It's all right. It's okay. Nothing. - Is she okay? - Emma. Emma, will you...? Stop it. Don't do this right now. - What are you doing? - Put your arm around your wife. - Actually, she's my wife. - Everybody just stay here. - Stay in this room. - Wait! I'm not staying here if he is. - Yes, you are. - No, I'm not. - I'm not. - All right. David? - Come with us. - Why? - You know the place. - Here's what I know. I'm not a cop. I don't take orders from you! - Bad words! - Listen. Just stay here, please. Keep everybody calm. He's not gonna get too far. Not in this! Thomas! What are we chasing here? A bad thing. I'll go around this way. Meet you in back. Is that where you live all the time? The NE city? - Used to. - What's that supposed to mean? It means I don't live there anymore. The NE place! We'll go see if we can use this one. We'll go in here. Since that wasn't a good try, we'll go in here. \"Lou?\" \"What's happening?\" \"What's wrong?\" \"Oh no!\" \"Come here!\" \"They caught him.\" \"They caught him.\" \"They caught him.\" \"Why are we keeping him here?\" \" \"Where would you like, Adam?\" \"I don't know.\" \"I told you to stay in 3, didn't I?\" \"Did I tell you that?\" \"They fought!\" \"I tried to get them to go back inside!\" \"Should we try the communication device again?\" \"Adam, just stay here and watch him.\" \" Go back and look after Grace.\" \" Where are you going?\" \"Just do it, please.\" \"Benjamin?\" \"I don't know if I'm okay with guard duty.\" \"He is sleeping. He is tied to a post.\" \"Thomas.\" \"Thomas.\" \"Thomas.\" \"Alice?\" \"Oh no. Alice?\" \"I don't remember anything. We had an accident. George? Can you keep an eye on Grace for a little while? She is awake now. I have to get some medicine to help her.\" Dear, I have to go get something from my room. \"Oh no!\" \"What's wrong, friend?\" What do you have in the cold box?\" \"You be quiet.\" \"What's in there? What's in there? What do you have in there? \"Be quiet.\" You can tell me. I'm good at keeping secrets. I have a big one myself. What are you doing? Bad person! What are you doing out here? Getting things that are mine. What are you doing? What, I don't get to ask a question? I'm taking photos. There have been two deaths. Before all the signs... That's not an answer. You drive a vehicle. What are you doing? Looking to win some \"past the call of duty,\" vehicle-driver good badge? You're not on the job anymore. You don't need to be a hero. There's a real, live, working officer outside... The one who has lost a guilty person? You're a complicated cat, Benjamin. No. Not really. I think so. What month were you born? May. Same as me. Where were you an officer? LA city. Were you fired or did you quit? I took medical leave. \"It was making me sick.\" \"I burned out, I guess.\" \"I wasn't up for it.\" \"One day I got a call for a person in trouble.\" \"A young person.\" \"They were truly one of the people with problems.\" \"I asked them to come in off the dangerous place and into my arms.\" \"They asked me why they should bother living.\" \"What did you say?\" \"I was trained to tell them lots of things.\" \"Their dreams, all the people who'd miss them.\" \"But for a second, I hesitated.\" \"And they saw it.\" \"Within that second, I couldn't think of one optimistic thing to say to them.\" \"So they spread their arms and jumped.\" \"I started getting headaches and eventually started blacking out.\" \"So I filed for medical leave.\" \"What? What is it?\" \"Adam! It's worse. Nothing but static! Where's that key from the actress? This was on the kid. What is it, some kind of countdown? Benjamin! What is he doing? Benjamin, come over here! Come over here, man. What are you doing? Come over here. What are you doing? I just went to get something. We told you to watch the person. What are you doing in your office? I just went to get something. How many sets of keys are there to this place? Look at me. How many? Two and a master set. Oh, no! Benjamin, you...! You...! Get in here! Get in here! Why did you hurt them? Why did you hurt my person? Oh no! Who did that? I didn't do that! That's not true! You're lying! It's your object sticking out of their body! I know, but I didn't do it! Check the doors! I didn't do it! Look at them! Why'd you hurt them? Why were you outside? Why'd you leave them? I was scared. What were you scared of? You wouldn't understand. Try me. Why'd you hurt my person? I didn't! I don't know how... I went to my office, that's all! Why'd you leave them? Is this your key? \"Number 8?\" \"Ten, nine, eight, huh?\" \"This is your key!\" \"You can't say that!\" \"Those aren't my keys!\" \"That's like leading the witness or something.\" \"Look.\" \"These are my keys, okay?\" \"These are my keys.\" \"You see?\" \"You got a fancy wallet?\" \"It's the actress's.\" \"Yes, I took her wallet.\" \"Afterwards.\" \"After she died!\" \"Afterwards, all right?\" \"I didn't kill her.\" \"And I didn't kill him.\" \"Let her go, Adam.\" Get back! You won't pin this on me. Thomas? Get him out of here! Put it down. I didn't hurt anybody. No one! But I don't like bad people! If you take one more step... Darn! Get it off! Oops! Come on, you little child. Please start. Oh no! Hey! Adam, stop! What is going on? Adam! Get out of my way, I didn't do anything wrong! Thomas! Thomas! Thomas! A plea was refused by the court despite the fact that my client is a sick person. To this day, he remains unaware of the crimes for which he was convicted. In the late 20th century, the highest court ruled decisively that places cannot execute a person who does not understand why he's being put to death. He signed a paper. He didn't just sign it, he spoke it. Thirdly person's writings found misfiled in place evidence. Your Honor, this notebook contains entries made just before the bad events. Important to note are the spectacular changes in handwriting style tone, point of view. What you are looking at are the private thoughts of several different people. With permission, Dr. Mallick will explain. Thank you. Your Honor, there is no universally good treatment for Sick Disorder. In theory, one attempts to move the patient towards joining. A folding of their broken mind. Your Honor? He's here. No! What you saw was an accident! He ran out in front of me! I'm not a bad person! There's a dead body in your freezer, Adam. I didn't kill him. I found him like that. Stop it! Listen! Listen! Listen! I was in a city last month and I lost everything, okay? Everything! \"I drove to the WE city,\" said Adam. \"I did not know where to go, but my car was out of gas, so I stopped here at this place.\" \"There was no one at the building, so I went to the office and walked in.\" \"And there, sitting at that desk, was the manager with his head down on a pie.\" \"Not moving!\" \"He had a heart attack or something.\" \"He was eating a pie!\" \"He had been sitting there for a long time.\" \"All of a sudden, a man selling car parts came, looking for a room.\" \"I did not have any money, so I took his money and gave him a room key.\" \"I just took the key from the wall and gave him a room.\" \"Maybe that was wrong, but I had no money, and that is what I did.\" \"Then I came back in here and I moved the manager's body...\" \"His name was also Adam. \"I put him in the cold room.\" \"I was not trying to hide him.\" \"It was hot outside.\" \"I thought it was the best place for him until his family or someone came.\" \"But no one came except more guests.\" \"So I checked them in too.\" \"And they all seemed happy, so I just stayed.\" \"Is it your birthday next week?\" \"Yes, it is my birthday next week.\" \"The 10th.\" \"Mine too.\"\"Mine too.\" \"Mine too.\" \"Yes.\" \"Adam, May 10.\" \"Alice, May 10.\" \"Charlotte, May 10.\" \"Emma and Fiona, May 10.\" \"Me, Gabriel, May 10.\" \"What are the chances?\" \"It must be very unlikely.\" \"What is happening?\" \"Where is the power box, Gabriel?\" \"On the other side of the building.\" \"Emma and Fiona.\" \"Emma and Fiona.\" \"Charlotte, Charlotte.\" \"NE city NV state.\" \"Adam.\" \"Gabriel.\" \"Island state, Island state.\" \"David.\" \"When I went up the stairs, I saw someone who was not there. That person was not there today either. I wish they would go away. Who is this? Who am I talking to right now? Where did you learn that poem? Who am I talking to? Look at me. Who am I talking to right now? Doctor? Edward? What is happening? Please be quiet. Can they hear what we are saying? Of course I can hear what you are saying. Edward, you missed your last appointment. Where have you been? Did I black out again? Try to remember. Where have you been? Okay. I was driving an actor and we got stuck at a hotel. There was a storm. We could not leave because of the storm. What happened at the hotel? People started dying. And then their bodies... It did not make sense. They disappeared. Edward, I would like to show you something, if I may. Do you recognize this man? No. That man, Edward, is Matthew. He has had a very troubled life. He was arrested four years ago and convicted of the murder of six people in a violent incident. He did this. Detective, please. Edward, listen to me. When faced with an intense trauma, a child's mind may fracture creating separate identities. That is exactly what happened to Matthew. He developed a condition that is commonly known as Multiple Personality Disorder. Why are you telling me this? Because you, Edward are one of his personalities. What? Oh no! What happened to my face? Keep calm. Where is my face? That is your face. Why am I tied up? Keep calm. Where is...? Please. Good heavens! Where is my face? Stay calm. No! I'm not going to stay calm! Why am I tied up like this? Who are all these people? What happened at the place? Where is everybody? They don't exist, Benjamin. You were all created by Matthew as a child. You're a liar! Consider what you know. Everyone named after a common word. No. Everyone sharing the same birthday. Your blackouts. No! I was a police officer! I was a police officer in the NE city Police Department. For six years. Benjamin, please. I live in NE city, in a small home. You don't live there. I do live there! You don't live anywhere. I know this is difficult to accept, but the face you saw in that mirror is the face I've always seen when I talk to Benjamin or Patrick or Gabriel or anyone else you've met tonight. Matthew is in the midst of a medical treatment. One which forces all his identities to confront one another for the first time. I knew there would be violence and with it, the number of the identities would be reduced. Reduced? One of the personalities you've met tonight, Benjamin... He took control of Matthew's body, as you have now and released an unspeakable rage. And in 19 hours Matthew Rivers will be put to death because of those actions unless I can convince that man that the killer is gone. I need you to stay with me. Benjamin? I need your help. I need your help to finish this. Benjamin, listen to me. Benjamin, stay with me. Listen to me. I need you to understand. The killer cannot survive. Benjamin! Got it? I can't see a thing. Is there a light? Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. You got a light? Yeah, yeah, it's dead. Oh no! Be quiet! Hey. What am I supposed to wear, man? You're in it. Gabriel. Gabriel, come here. Benjamin! Benjamin! Benjamin! Gabriel. Gabriel. Gabriel? Gabriel? Gabriel? Gabriel? Where are the keys to the vehicle?Where are the keys to the truck?\" \"Where are the keys to the truck?\" \"That was good, Benjamin.\" \"We must leave here.\" \"Edward has the keys to the truck.\" \"I have a spare right here.\" \"Where is he?\" \"I don't know.\" \"Here.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"We need a tool.\" \"Holy cow!\" \"Give me the keys to the truck.\" \"Edward!\" \"We must leave here!\" \"The FR country...\" \"He's coming.\" \"He's...\" \"Stay here.\" \"What's wrong with you? Charlotte, listen to me. Stay here. It's going to be okay. Throw me the keys to the truck, Edward. Throw me the keys to the truck. Stay there. Stay there!\" \"Edward!\"\"Edward!\"\"Edward!\" \"Edward!\" \"Edward!\" \"Edward, let me see. We must take you to the doctor. We're going to take you to the doctor, okay? Stay with me because I'm going to take you to the truck. Put your arm around my neck. You must hold on, okay? You with me, Edward? Stay with me. Okay. One, two, three. You must help me take you up. Edward, you must push a little bit. Edward, why won't you let me help you? Where did you go before? What did you see? Tell me what you saw. I saw you. I saw you in a garden. Why won't you let me help you? Where did you go? What did you see? I saw you in a garden. The question, Your Honor, is whether to punish the body or the mind. His body did these bad things, that is true. The person who remains inside did not. Judge Taylor, that may not be true... We witnessed the destruction of 10 selves tonight. Nine were good and one was bad. They're not real! The violence that existed in him has been punished. Your Honor, Matthew belongs in a hospital. In the matter of the NV state v. Matthew, it is the order of this court that Mr. Rivers' punishment be stopped. I am sending Mr. Rivers to the hospital under the care of Dr. Mallick.", "hash": "d1cf4c5eea806ebadd21fbd1cf27b9c1bf43f770ebc3cdd0976908a57eb0d97c"}

She didn't listen to my advice.\nWell, you know what's going to happen.\nHmm, that warm coat on your legs looks cozy.\nWhat? I got ready this morning.\nOoh.\nI'll tell you exactly what will happen. \nEmma is going to talk to Henry, they will say angry things, they will hurt each other's feelings, and she will be sad.\nAnd you know who she will come to put things back together? Me.\nNo. Me.\nI am going to have to fix everything again because that is what I do.\nBut not this time. She thinks she can handle everything alone? Well, let her handle this alone, because, quite honestly, this whole thing is starting to really bother me.\nHey, Oliver. Want to see something gross?\nQuit it. You know what? I'm sorry. That was not nice.\nThank you.\nMaybe you could start a fire by rubbing your legs together.\n[knock on door]\nHey. Hey.\nIs Henry here?\nNo. He usually comes home late at night. \"You want to come in and wait for Samuel?\" \"Yeah, but I just need you to know that I'm here to see Samuel.\" \"Samuel is the person I'm here to see.\" \"Samuel.\" \"Okay?\" \"Whatever.\" \"You okay?\" \"You seem a little...\" \"Seem a little what?\" \"You don't know me.\" \"Samuel knows me.\" \"Do you want to take your coat off?\" \"Okay, I'm not taking anything off.\" \"Okay, fine.\" \"Sorry.\" \"It's just Samuel and I had a thing, and it's going to be fine.\" \"I just need to talk to him.\" \"What kind of thing?\" Just a thing. Okay. I'm going to get a drink. Do you want one? Uh, yeah, sure, thanks. So, uh, what did Samuel do? Samuel didn't do anything. It's me. Well, whatever it is, I'm sure you'll work it out. I know. Here's to you two working it out. Oh, what a surprise. You're here at this place. Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you. You haven't answered your phone. Oh, what, were you worried about me? Yes. Samuel, listen, can we go outside and talk? Good luck with that. I have nothing to say to you. I'm just going to get my stuff and go. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, friend. She came all this way to talk to you. The least you can do is listen. Communication is important. Now, the two of you, come here and sit down. We're going to work this out. Uh, friend, come here, man. I got this. I got it. No, I don't think you do, friend. It's okay. I have experience. This is what we're going to do. She's going to tell you her side of the story, and you're going to listen with an open mind, and then Samuel is going to tell you how he feels. Are you kidding me? Aw, darn, you're right. We're supposed to start with a trust exercise first. Come here and take my hand. Stop it. Friend, I'm just trying to. Yeah, you've done enough. Done enough what? \"I cannot sit here and do nothing,\" said Henry. \"I just want to thank you for letting me stay here. I really appreciate it.\"\n\"You do not have to leave,\" the other person replied. \n\"Yes, I do have to leave,\" Henry said. \"Friend, I am really sorry, but I am just as surprised as you are.\"\n\"Really? You are surprised?\" the other person asked. \"Walking around with all your muscles, being all good-looking. It is a shock she would like you. You are easy on the eyes.\"\n\"Hey, what are you looking for?\" Henry asked.\n\"I am looking for my wristband,\" the other person replied. \"It is a brown leather band with Holly's initials on it. She gave it to me. I do not even know why I want it. I just do not want it here.\"\n\"It is next to the sink. I saw it there this morning,\" Henry said.\nThere was a knock on the door.\n\"I will get it,\" Henry said. He opened the door. \"You came back here? Why did you come back here?\"\nHolly replied, \"My car will not start, it is freezing outside, and I wish I was dead.\"\n\"Okay, come on in, but do you mind if I wait in your car?\" Henry asked.\n\"No, please wait with me here,\" Holly said.\n\"All right, I will help you through it.

Let us give it up for Holly, yes?\"\n\"It is really nice of your mother to let us use her car,\" Holly said.\n\"Yes, she has no idea we have it,\" the other person replied.\nThey got into the car and tried to put on the seatbelt, but struggled a bit. Finally they got seated comfortably.\n\"You know, this is nice,\" Holly said.\n\"Not really,\" the other person replied. \"Whatever.\" \"No, Adam, Emma wants you to know Emma would not do that to you.\" \"Emma thinks of you as a friend, and Emma would not do that to a friend.\" \"Okay.\" \"Hang in there.\" \"We will be out of here early.\" \"Emma messed this up very badly.\" \"It is like Emma could not have handled it any worse if Emma tried.\" \"You should have seen the look on Henry's face.\" \"Henry does not like Emma.\" \"Everyone does not like Emma.\" \"Emma does.\" \"Do you think Emma should go talk to Henry?\" \"Emma thinks\" \"Emma thinks you should do whatever you want to do.\" \"Emma feels like Emma cannot just leave it like this, but...\" \"What would you do?\" \"Well, Emma would think about how angry Henry is and how hurt Henry must be, and Emma would wait and let Henry come to Emma.\" \"How long do you think Emma is going to have to wait?\" \"About a short time.\" \"What?\" \"Emma is leaving.\" \"Emma is going to get going.\" \"Okay.\" \"Listen...\" \"Emma is glad that you still care about Emma.\" \"Emma does.\" \"Okay.\" \"Emma still cares about you, too.\" \"But this thing with a friend...\" \"Emma just cannot.\" \"[ A famous singer ]: Baby, Emma will try to love again.

{"text": "Adam's got you. I promise, I will never let anything happen to you, Oliver. First day of school! First day of school! First day of school! Wake up, wake up! First day of school. I don't want to go to school, five more minutes. Not you, Patrick, me. Get up, get up. It's time for school, time for school. All right, I'm up. Oliver! First day of school! Oliver, don't move. You'll never get out of there yourself. I'll do it. You feel a break? No. Sometimes you can't tell 'cause fluid rushes to the area. Are you woozy? No. How many stripes do I have? I'm fine. Answer the stripe question. Three. No! See? Something's wrong with you. I have one, two, three... That's all I have? You're OK. How's the lucky fin? Lucky. Let's see. Are you sure you want to go to school this year? There's no problem if you don't. You can wait 5 or 6 years. Come on, Patrick, it's time for school. Forgot to brush. Do you want this sea plant to sting you? Yes. Brush. OK, I'm done. You missed a spot. Where? There. Where? There. Right there. And here and here. All right, we're excited. All right, we're excited. The first day of school. Here we go. We're ready to learn to get some knowledge. What's the one thing we have to remember about the ocean? It's not safe. That's my boy. First, we check to see that the coast is clear. We go out... and back in. And then we go out... and back in. And then one more time... out and back in. And sometimes, if you want to do it four times... Oliver... All right, come on, boy. Maybe while I'm at school, I'll see a dangerous sea creature. I highly doubt that. Have you ever met a dangerous sea creature? No, and I don't plan to. How old are sea animals? I don't know. A sea creature from next door says that sea animals live to be about 100 years old. Henry says that sea animals can live for many years. \"If I ever meet a sea animal,\" Isaac said, \"I'll talk to it after I talk to the shark, OK?\"\n\n\"Wait to cross the road,\" Henry said. \"Hold my fin.\"\n\n\"Dad, you won't act strange like at the zoo, right?\" Isaac asked. \"That snail was going to attack.\"\n\n\"Where do we go now?\" Isaac said.\n\n\"Bye, Mom!\" Isaac said. \"I'll see you after school.\"\n\n\"Give that back!\" some kids yelled. \"Let's try over there.\"\n\n\"Is this where we meet the teacher?\" Henry asked.\n\n\"Well, look who's out of his home,\" a fish said. \"Yes, it's surprising,\" he said.\n\n\"Martin, right?\" another fish asked.\n\"Marlin,\" Henry said.\n\n\"You're a clownfish. You're funny, right? Tell us a joke,\" the fish said.\n\n\"Well, that's not true. Clownfish aren't funnier than other fish,\" Henry said.\n\n\"Come on, clownie. Do something funny,\" the fish said.\n\nHenry tried to tell a joke, but got mixed up.\n\n\"Sheldon! Get out of the yard now!\" a voice called.\n\n\"Where did you go?\" Henry asked Isaac. \"Can I play too, Dad? Can I?\"\n\n\"I'd feel better if you played in the safe area. That's where I'd play,\" Henry said.\n\n\"What's wrong with his fin?\" a kid asked.\n\"He looks strange,\" said another.\n\n\"Hey, what did I do?\" Isaac said.\n\n\"Be nice. It's his first time at school. He was born with it. We call it his lucky fin,\" Henry said.\n\n\"Dad, look at my shorter tentacle. It's shorter than the others, but you can't really tell, especially when I twirl them.\" Let's name the things, the things, the things. Let's name the things of the open sea. Mr. Nathan! Come on, Victoria. You better stay with me. Deeper places, deeper places, deeper places. All the rest are too deep for you and me to see. I wonder where my class has gone? We're under here! There you are. Climb aboard, explorers. Oh, learning exploring is, oh, so nice. When you think thoughts that are real. Dad, you can go now. Hello. Who is this? I'm Victoria. Victoria, all new explorers must answer a science question. OK. You live in what kind of home? A home-none. A home-nome. OK, don't hurt yourself. Welcome aboard, explorers. Just so you know, she has a little fin. I find if she's having trouble swimming, I let her take a break, 10, 15 minutes. Dad, it's time for you to go now. Don't worry. We're gonna stay together as a group. OK, class, eyes up front. And remember, we keep our heads to ourselves. That means you, Patrick. Aw, man! Bye, Victoria! Bye, Dad! Bye, child! Be safe. You're doing pretty well for a first-timer. You can't hold on to them forever, can you? I had a tough time with my oldest at the deep end. They got to grow up. The deep end? They're going to the deep end? What are you, crazy? Why don't we cook them now and serve them with chips? Hey, Samuel, calm down. Don't tell me to be calm, buddy. Buddy? For a fish, he really isn't that funny. Pity. Let's name the things, the things, the things. Let's name the things that live in the sea. There's things, things, things, things, things, things, things, three. Things, things, things. And some fish like you and me. Come on, sing with me. Just the girls this time. \"I am sure he is, but you have a large group... and he can get lost if you are not looking.\" \"I am not saying you are not looking.\" \"Oh, no!\" \"Nemo is swimming away!\" \"Nemo!\" \"What do you think you are doing?\" \"You will get stuck out there... and I will have to get you before another fish does.\" \"Come back here!\" \"I said come back here now!\" \"Stop!\" \"You move one more time, child...\" \"Do not do that!\" \"If you go on that boat...\" \"Are you listening to me?\" \"Do not touch the boat...\" \"Nemo!\" \"He touched the boat.\" \"You come right back here, Nemo. That is right. You are in big trouble, young one. Do you hear me? Big... Big... Daddy! Help me!\" \"I am coming, Nemo!\" Get under me, kids!\" \"Dad! Daddy! Nemo!\" \"Hold on.\" \"Oh, no. No, it is gone. It is gone. No, no, it cannot be gone. No, no! Nemo! No, please, no!\" \"Has anybody seen a boat? Please! A boat! They took my child! My child! Help me, please.\" \"Look out!\" \"What?\" \"Sorry. I did not see you.\" \"Sir? Are you OK?\" \"He is gone, he is gone.\" \"There, there. It is all right.\" \"No, no. They took him away. I have to find the boat.\" \"A boat? Hey, I have seen a boat.\" \"You have?\" \"It passed by not too long ago.\" \"A boat?\" \"Hi. I am Dory.\" \"Where? Which way?\" \"It went this way.\" \"It went this way. Follow me.\" \"Thank you, thank you so much.\" \"No problem.\" \"Wait! Will you quit it?\" \"What?\" \"I am trying to swim here. Ocean is not big enough for you? You got a problem, friend?\" \"Do you? Do you? You want to fight me? I am scared now.\" \"What?\" \"Wait.\" \"Do not follow me, OK?\" \"What?\" \"You are showing me where the boat went.\" \"A boat?\" \"Hey, I have seen a boat.\" \"It passed by not long ago.\" \"It went this way.\" \"It went this way.\" \"It went this way.\" \"Follow me.\" \"Wait.\" \"What is happening?\" \"You already told me which way the boat was going.\" \"I did?\" \"Oh, no.\" \"If this is some kind of joke, it is not funny. And I know funny. I am a fish.\" No, it is not. I know it is not. I am so sorry. See, I forget things almost right away. I forget things almost right away. I do not believe this. No, it is true. I forget things almost instantly. It happens in my family. At least, I think it does. Where are they? Can I help you? Something is wrong with you... really. You are wasting my time. I have to find my child. Hello. Well, hi! Name is Benjamin. It is all right. I understand. Why trust a shark, right? So, what are a couple of little ones like you doing out so late? We are not doing anything. We are not even out. Great! Then how would you little ones like to come to a little get-together I am having? You mean, like a party? Yeah, right. A party. What do you say? I love parties. That sounds like fun. Parties are fun, and it is tempting, but... Oh, come on, I insist. OK. That is all that matters. Hey, look, balloons. It is a party. Mind your distance, though. Those balloons can be a bit dodgy. You would not want one of them to pop. Cameron! David! There you are, Benjamin. Finally. We got company. It is about time, mate. We have already gone through the snacks and I am still hungry. We almost had a feeding frenzy. Come on, let us get this over with. Right, then. The meeting has officially come to order. Let us all say the pledge. I am a nice shark, not a mindless eating machine. Hello. I am Adam. I do not think I have ever eaten a fish. That is great. I am glad I said that. Anyone else? How about you? What is your problem? \n\nMe? I do not have a problem. OK. Do not believe it. Just start with your name.\n\nOK. Hello. My name is Henry. I am a small fish. A small fish? Really? Tell us a joke. I love jokes. \n\nI actually do know one that is pretty good. There was this sea animal... and it goes to another sea animal. Normally, they do not talk, those sea animals... but in a joke, everyone talks... so the sea animal says to the other animal...\n\nFather! Liam! Liam! Liam! Liam! Liam! I do not understand it. For a small fish, he is not that funny.\n\nNo, he is my child. He was taken by these people who work under the sea. Oh my. You poor fish. Humans... think they own everything. There was a parent. \"Looking for their little child.\" \"There was a parent.\" \"Looking for their little child.\" \"There was a parent.\" \"Looking for their little child.\" \"What do these marks mean?\" \"I never knew my parent!\" \"Group hug.\" \"We're all friends here, friend.\" \"I can't read human writing.\" \"We got to find a fish that can read this.\" \"Hey, look, sharks.\" \"No, no, no, Emma!\" \"Friends, friends.\" \"No, Emma.\" \"That's mine. Give it to me. Gimme!\" \"I'm sorry. Are you OK? I'm so sorry. You really hit me there. Am I bleeding?\" Emma, are you OK? That's good. Let's stop!\" \"Just a bite.\" \"Hold it together, friend! Remember, Benjamin, fish are friends, not food!\" \"Food!\" \"Emma, look out!\" \"Food!\" \"Emma, look out!\" \"Aah!\" \"I'm having fish tonight!\" Remember the steps, friend! Just one bite!\" Hello. There's no way out! There's got to be a way to escape! Who is it? Emma, help me find a way out! Sorry. Come back later. We're trying to escape. \"There's got to be a way out!\" \"Here's something. 'Es-cap-e.' I wonder what that means. Funny. It's spelled just like 'escape.'\" Let's go. Here's Benjamin! Wait a minute. You can read? I can read? That's right. I can read! Well, then, here. Read this now. They really don't mean it. They never even knew their parent. Don't fall off the good path! Oh, no, it's blocked! No, Benjamin, focus. Sorry about Benjamin, friend. They're really a nice person. I need to get that mask. You want that mask? OK. Quick, grab the mask! Oh, no. Benjamin? What? Swim away! Swim away! Swim away! Is the party over? Nice. Parent? Parent? Barbara. Prep for their front tooth, would you, please? And I'm going to need a few more cotton rolls. Hello, little friend. A small orange fish said, \"Beauty, isn't he?\"\nAnother fish replied, \"I found that guy struggling in the ocean, and I saved him.\"\nA big fish asked, \"So, has that medicine kicked in yet?\"\nThe orange fish answered, \"I think so.\"\nThe big fish said, \"We're ready to start working on you.\"\nHe added, \"Bubbles!\"\n\"My bubbles,\" the orange fish said happily. \"He likes bubbles.\"\nA funny looking fish greeted them, \"Hello.\"\n\"Slow down, little one,\" the big fish told the orange fish. \"There's nothing to worry about. He's scared.\"\nThe orange fish said, \"I want to go home. Do you know where my dad is?\"\n\"Honey, your dad's probably back at the pet store,\" the big fish replied.\n\"Pet store?\" the orange fish asked. \"I'm from the ocean.\"\n\"The ocean?\" the big fish exclaimed. \"He hasn't been cleaned yet.\"\nHe called out, \"Jacques!\"\nAnother fish answered, \"Yes.\"\nThe big fish instructed, \"Clean him!\"\n\"Yes,\" Jacques replied. He cleaned the orange fish and said, \"There, he is clean.\"\nThe big fish marveled, \"Wow, the big blue ocean. What's it like?\"\n\"Big and blue?\" the orange fish guessed.\nThe big fish said, \"If there's anything you need, just ask me, Auntie Emma. Or if I'm not around, you can talk to my sister Alice.\"\nAlice greeted, \"Hi. How are you? Don't listen to anything my sister says. She's silly.\"\nAnother fish said, \"We have a new patient. It looks like he needs some work done on his mouth.\"\nThe other fish agreed, examining some pictures. They debated what tools the doctor used, before calling for help to care for the orange fish.\nOne fish exclaimed, \"The mouth is a dirty place!\" \"What did I miss?\" \"A hard task... it was difficult.\" \"Hard task?\" \"What did he use to open?\" \"A special tool.\" \"He's favoring that one.\" \"Hope he doesn't get too much at the end.\" \"Hello.\" \"Who's this?\" \"New guy.\" \"The worker took him off the place.\" \"Someone from outside.\" \"From my area, eh?\" \"Sorry if I ever did something to you.\" \"Animals gotta do what they do.\" \"No, no! They're not your animals. They're my animals. Come on, go. Go on, leave!\" The picture broke. This here's Diana. She's my niece. She's going to be eight this week. Hey, little one. Say hello to your new caregiver. She'll be here on the next day to pick you up. You're her present. It's our little secret. Well, Mr. Thomas, while that sets up... I'm going to see someone about something. Oh, Diana. What? What's wrong with her? She wouldn't stop shaking the bag. Poor little one. He was her present last year. He went away. She's not good with animals. I can't go with that girl. I have to get back to my dad. Daddy! Help me! He's stuck. Nobody touch him. Nobody touch him. Can you help me? No. You got yourself in there. You can get yourself out. Gabriel... I want to see him do it. Calm down. Move your fins and your tail, one after the other. I can't. I have a bad fin. Never stopped me. Just think about what you need to do. Come on. Good job. You did it! Good moving. Wow. From the ocean... just like you, Gabriel. Yeah. I've seen that look before. What are you thinking about? I'm thinking... tonight, we welcome the kid properly. So, kid, you got a name or what? Nemo. I'm Nemo. Nemo. Are you gonna eat that? \"Be careful with that tool.\" \"What does it say?\" \"Dory!\" \"A small animal has my money.\" \"Wake up.\" \"Get up.\" \"Come on.\" \"Come on!\" \"Yes, I'm a natural blue color.\" \"Get up!\" \"Look out!\" \"Big fish eat small fish!\" \"Dusty.\" \"The mask.\" \"Where's the mask?\" \"No!\" \"No, not the mask!\" \"Get it!\" \"Get the mask!\" \"Get the mask!\" \"Get the mask!\" \"Get it!\" \"It just keeps going on, doesn't it?\" \"Echo!\" \"Echo!\" \"Echo!\" \"Hey, what are you doing?\" \"It's gone.\" \"I've lost the mask. Did you drop it? You dropped it! That was my only chance of finding my child. Now it's gone. Hey, Mr. Grumpy Fish... when life gets you down, know what you have to do? I don't want to know. Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming. What do we do? We swim, swim. Dory, no singing. I love to swim. When you want to swim. See, I'm going to get stuck now with that song. Now it's in my head. Sorry. Now it's in my head. Sorry. Dory, do you see anything? Something's got me. That was me. I'm sorry. Who's that? Who could it be? It's me. Are you my inner voice? Yeah. I'm your inner voice. We haven't spoken for a while. How are you? Can't complain. Yeah? Good. Now, Dory, I want you to tell me... Do you see anything? I see a... I see a light. A light? Yeah. Over there. Hey, inner voice, am I dead? No. I see it, too. What is it? It's so pretty. I'm feeling... happy... which is a big deal for me. I want to touch it. Hey, come back. Come on back here. I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna swim with you. I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna be your best friend. Good feeling's gone. I can't see! I don't know where I'm going! \"What mask?\" \"Oh, I cannot see a thing.\" \"Hey, look, something is here.\" \"Read it!\" \"I am sorry, but if you could just... bring it a little closer, I kind of need the light.\" \"Bring it a little closer, I kind of need the light.\" \"That's great.\" \"Keep it right there.\" \"Just read it!\" \"OK, OK.\" \"\"P.\" OK. \"\"P. Sher...\"\" \"\"Sher...\"\" \"P. Sher...\" \"The first line's \"P. Samuel.\"\" \"\"P. Samuel\" does not make sense!\" \"OK.\" \"Second line. \"42.\"\" \"\"Do not eat me.\"\"Do not eat me.\" \"Do not eat me.\" \"Light, please!\" \"The second line's \"42 Way.\"\" \"That's great.\" \"Speed read. Take a guess.\" \"No pressure.\" \"No problem.\" \"There is a lot of pressure.\" \"Pressure! Take a guess now with pressure!\" \"SI town!\" \"It's \"SI town!\" \"Hide!\" I died. I died, I died, I died. We did it, we did it. No eating here today! No, no, no, eating here today. What did it say? P. Samuel, 42 Way, SI town. I remembered it! Where is that? I do not know. But who cares? P. Samuel, 42 Way, SI town. I remembered it again! Follow me. State your name. Brother, proceed. Newcomer of orange and white... you have come to join our group. We want you in our club, kid. Really? If you are able to swim through the Ring of Fire! Turn on the Ring of Fire! You said you could do it. The Ring of Fire! Let me... Is there another way? \"I'm trying to talk to you!\" \"Friends, come back here.\" \"One quick question.\" \"I need to...\" \"And they're gone again.\" \"A person's name and address.\" \"Why do I have to tell you over and over again?\" \"I'll tell you again.\" \"I don't get tired of it...\" \"OK, all right.\" \"Here's the thing.\" \"I think it's best if I carry on from here by myself.\" \"OK.\" \"You know, alone.\" \"Without you.\" \"I mean, not with you.\" \"Am I...\" \"I don't want to hurt your feelings.\" \"You want me to leave? I mean, not... Yes. I just can't afford any more delays and you're one of those fish that cause delays. Sometimes it's a good thing. There's a whole group of fish. They're delay fish. You mean... You mean you don't like me? No, of course I like you. It's because I like you I don't want to be with you. It's a complicated emotion. Don't cry. I like you. Hey, you! Lady, is this guy bothering you? I don't remember. Were you? No, no, no. We're just... Do you guys know how I can get to... Look, friend, we're talking to the lady, not you. Hey, hey. You like impressions? Just like in rehearsals, friends. So what are we? Take a guess. I've seen one of those. I'm a fish with a nose like a sword. Wait, wait... It's a swordfish! Hey, fun guy, let the lady guess. Hey, fun guy, let the lady guess. Where's the butter? It's on the tip of my tongue! A creature with a hard shell. Close enough! Oh, it's a famous story I'll tell you, friend... They're good. Will somebody please give me directions?! Will somebody please give me directions?! I'm serious! Thank you. Oh, dear. Hey! Hey, come back! Hey, what's the matter? What's the matter? Hey, what's the matter? What's the matter? \"While they are doing their silly little acts...\" \"I am far from home with a fish that cannot remember her name!\" \"I bet that is annoying.\" \"Meanwhile, my child is out there.\" \"Your child Charlie?\" \"Noah?\" \"But it does not matter because no fish... in this whole ocean is going to help me.\" \"Well, I am helping you.\" \"Wait right here.\" \"Folks!\" \"Is he bothering you again?\" \"No, no. He is a good one. Go easy on him. He has lost his child Ethan.\" \"Any of you heard of PS, 42 WA Way, SY city?\" \"SY city? Oh, sure! Thomas here has relatives in SY city. Don't you, Thomas?\" \"Sure do!\" \"Oh! Hey! They know SY city! You would not know how to get there, would you?\" \"You want to follow the EAC. That is the East AU Current. Big current. Cannot miss it. It is in... that way.\" And then you follow that for about... I do not know. What do you folks think? About three far distances? That little baby will put you right past SY city.\" \"Great! That is great! Dory, you did it! Oh, please, I am just your little helper. Helping along. That is me.\" \"Friends, thank you. Do not mention it! Just loosen up, OK, buddy? Oh, you folks. You really nailed him. Bye.\" \"Hey, ma'am. One more thing. When you come to this deep place, swim through it, not over it.\" \"Deep place... through it, not over it. I will remember.\" \"Hey, hey! Hey, wait up, partner! Hold on! Wait, wait, wait! I have to tell you something.\" \"Nice deep place. OK, let us go.\" \"No, no. Bad deep place. Come on, we will swim over this thing.\" \"Whoa, partner. Little red flag going up. Something is telling me to swim through it, not over it.\" \"Are you looking at this thing? It has danger written all over it. I really, really, really think we should swim through.\" \"And I am really, really done talking about this. Over we go.\" \"No, I do not think so!\" \"Stop it, old person.\" \"You cannot stop change.\" \"I was made for speed.\" \"The question is, child, are you hungry?\" \"Hungry?\" \"Yes, because you are about to eat my bubbles!\" \"Move to the left side!\" \"Right there!\" \"The small fish is the winner!\" \"We did it!\" \"Look at us!\" \"Child?\" \"Oh, no.\" \"Child!\" \"Child!\" \"Am I not allowed to stay?\" \"No, you are doing well!\" \"You are actually winning!\" \"But you must stay awake.\" \"Where does the teacher live?\" \"Teacher...\" \"Way, Big city...\" \"That's it!\" \"Way...\" \"Stay awake!\" Stay awake!\" Stay awake!\" Stay awake! Stay... awake! Awake. Teacher. Awake. Number home. Wake up. Child... Wake up. Child... You miss your father, do you not, Fish-friend? Yes. Yes. Yes. You are lucky to have someone out there looking for you. They are not looking for me. They are scared of the big waters. Any movement? They have had four drinks. It must be soon. Keep watching them. My first escape... landed on tools for teeth. I was trying to reach the water bowl. Water bowl? All drains lead to the big waters, child. Wow. How many times have you tried to get out? I have lost count. Fish are not meant to be in a box, child. It does things to you. Bubbles! Bubbles! Bubbles! Break time! They grabbed the book. We have time! That's your cue, Fish-friend. You can do it, child. We must be quick. Once you get in, swim to the bottom of the chamber... Once you get in, swim to the bottom of the chamber... and I will talk you through the rest. OK. It will be easy. Nicely done! Can you hear me? Yes! Here comes the small stone. Now, do you see a small opening? Inside it, you will see a spinning fan. Wedge that small stone into the fan to stop it turning. Be careful, Fish-friend! \"I cannot do it!\" \"Gabriel, this is not a good plan.\" \"He will be well.\" \"Try again!\" \"Alright.\" \"That is it, Jack.\" \"Nice and steady.\" \"I got it! I got it! I got it!\" \"He did it!\" \"That is great, child!\" \"Now swim up the tube and out.\" \"Oh, no!\" \"Gabriel!\" \"Jack!\" \"Oh, my goodness!\" \"Get him out of there!\" \"What do we do?\" \"Oh, no!\" \"Stay calm, child. Just do not panic!\" \"Help me!\" \"Jack, grab hold of this!\" \"No! No! No! No!\" \"Feed me more!\" \"That is it!\" \"Jack! Grab it!\" \"I got it! Pull!\" \"Gabriel, do not make him go back in there. No. We are done.\" Dude. Dude. Dude. Focus, dude. Dude. He lives. Hey, dude! What happened? Saw the whole thing, dude. First, you were all, like, \"Whoa!\"... and then we were all, like, \"Whoa!\"... and then you were, like, \"Whoa.\" What are you talking about? You, small one. Taking on the jellies. You got serious thrill issues, dude. Awesome. Oh, my stomach. Oh, man. No hurling on the shell, dude, OK? Just waxed it. So, Mr. Turtle... Whoa, dude. Mr. Turtle is my father. The name is Crush. Crush? Really? OK, Crush. I need to the NE current. NE Current? Oh, dude. You are riding it, dude! Check it out! OK, grab shell, dude! Grab what? Grab what? Righteous! Yeah! Stop! So... what brings you on this fine day to the NE current? Rachel and I need to get to SY city. Rachel! Is she alright? Oh, little blue. She is sub-level, dude. Rachel! Rachel! Rachel! I am so sorry. The little fish said, \"That's good, Mr. Leader!\" \"Oh, Henry!\" \"You just missed a journey.\" \"Has he made the teeth fall out yet?\" \"What am I saying?\" \"Where's Thomas?\" \"I need to talk to him.\" \"What is it?\" \"Your father has been fighting the whole sea looking for you.\" \"My father? Really?\" \"He has traveled far, fighting big fish and stingy sea creatures.\" \"Big fish?\" \"That can't be him.\" \"What was his name?\" \"Some kind of sports fish. Tuna? Fish?\" \"Matthew?\" \"Matthew! The little fish from the rocks. It's my dad! He fought a big fish! I heard he fought three.\" \"Three big fish? That's many teeth!\" After you were taken by the fisherman over there, your dad followed the boat like crazy. Really? He swam, doing his best, and then three huge fish caught him, but he escaped them and dived deep, and a monster with big teeth chased him! He tied the monster to a rock, and what did he get? He had to fight a whole forest of stingy sea creatures! Now he's with some turtles on the big water way, and word is he's coming here right now!\" \"What a good daddy! He was looking for you all along, Thomas.\" \"He's swimming to the filter!\" \"Thomas!\" \"Not again!\" \"Thomas! No! You have your whole life ahead of you!\" \"We'll help you, kid!\" \"Get him out! Get him out of there!\" \"Come on, kid! Grab the end!\" \"Thomas! No!\" \"Can you hear me? Thomas! Can you hear me?\" \"Yeah, I can hear you.\" \"Thomas, you did it! Thomas, you're dirty!\" \"That was brave, kid. All right, gang, we have less than two days before the scary girl gets here. This tank will get dirty in that time, but we have to make it worse any way we can. Jacques? No cleaning.\" \"I won't do it.\" \"Everybody else, be as dirty as possible. Think dirty thoughts. We're going to make this tank so filthy, the doctor will have to clean it.\" Emma and Henry were lost in the big PR ocean. \"Let's ask for help,\" said Emma.\n\n\"Who can we ask?\" said Henry. \"There is no one here.\"\n\nEmma saw a big fish. \"Let's ask that big fish for help!\" she said.\n\nEmma talked to the big fish. But the big fish did not understand Emma. It swam away.\n\n\"Oh no, the big fish is gone,\" said Emma, sad. \"I wish I could speak fish.\"\n\nHenry said, \"Do not worry, Emma. We will find a way out of the ocean.\" \"Maybe I should try a loud sound.\" \"Don't try a loud sound.\" \"You actually sound sick.\" \"Maybe louder?\" \"Don't do that!\" \"Too much loud noise.\" \"Didn't it sound like a loud noise?\" \"It doesn't sound like a loud noise.\" \"It sounds like nothing I've ever heard.\" \"It's just as well.\" \"They might be hungry.\" \"It's just as well.\" \"They might be hungry.\" \"Big animals don't eat small fish.\" \"They eat tiny sea creatures.\" \"Swim away!\" \"Oh, look, tiny sea creatures!\" \"Move, child, move!\" \"Move, child, move!\" \"Move, child, move!\" \"Look at that.\" Would you look at that? Dirty. Absolutely dirty. All thanks to you, kid. You made it possible. I said no cleaning. I am ashamed. Look! Soapy angel! Bubbles! I love the bubbles! Child's name? Has anybody seen child's name? Morning and time for doctor. Hello, name. Sorry I'm late. OK, here we go. Here we go, OK. Little child's name...Moves to the counter, drops the keys...That's disgusting! Tastes pretty good to me. Don't you people realize we are swimming in our own...Here they come! Scary. What a state. Name, what's my earliest time tomorrow? Time, friend. Leave it open, would you? I've gotta clean the fish tank before child gets here. Did you hear that, little fish? They're gonna clean the tank! We're gonna be clean! You ready to see your dad, kid? Yes. Of course you are. I wouldn't be surprised if they're out there...in the harbor waiting for you right now. In the harbor waiting for you right now. Yeah. Here comes the big one. Come on! You gotta try this! Will you just stop it? Why? What's wrong? We're in a big animal, don't you get it? Big animal? A big animal! You had to ask for help! And now we're stuck here! Wow, a big animal. I understand big animal sounds. No, you're insane! You can't understand big animal sounds! I have to get out! I have to find my child! \"I have to tell him how old some animals are!\" \"Hey... you OK?\" \"There, there.\" \"It's all right.\" \"It'll be OK.\" \"No.\" \"No, it won't.\" \"Sure it will.\" \"You'll see.\" \"No.\" \"I promised him I'd never let anything bad happen to him. That's a funny thing to promise.\" \"What?\" \"You can't never let anything bad happen to him. Then nothing bad would ever happen to him. Not much fun for little Henry.\" \"What's going on?\" \"Don't know.\" \"I'll ask him.\" \"Ethan...\" \"What's going on?\" \"I think he says we've stopped. Of course we've stopped. Stop trying to make noises. You'll make things worse. What is that noise? Oh, no. Look what you did. The water is going down. It is going down! Really? You sure about that? Look! Already it's half empty! I'd say it's half full. Stop that! It's half empty! OK, that one was a bit hard. He either said we should go to the back of the throat... or he wants a sweet drink. Of course he wants us to go there! That's eating us! Do I taste good? Tell him I'm not interested in being food! OK. He... Stop making noises to him! What is going on? I'll check. What... No more noises! You can't make noises! Yes, I can! No, you can't! You think you can do these things, but you can't, Liam! OK. Alice! He says it's time to let go. Everything's gonna be all right. How do you know? How do you know something bad isn't gonna happen? I don't! We're alive! Look! SY city... SY city! SY city again! You were right, Alice! We made it! We're gonna find my child! Thank you, sir! Thank you, sir! Wow. I wish I could make noises. All we gotta do is find the boat that took him. Right! \"We can do this!\" \"Early morning.\" \"Early morning.\" \"Early morning.\" \"It's early morning, everybody!\" \"Today is the day!\" \"The sun is shining, the tank is clean... and we are getting out...\" \"The tank is clean.\" \"The tank is clean!\" \"But how?\" \"Frank must've installed it while we were sleeping.\" \"What will we do now?\" \"What does it say, Penelope?\" \"I can't hear you, Penelope.\" \"The Aquascum 2003 is an all-purpose, self-cleaning... maintenance-free, salt water purifier... that is promised to keep your fish healthy.\" \"Stop it!\" \"The Aquascum scans... your tank every few minutes?\" \"Scan? What does that mean?\" \"Temperature... warm and nice.\" \"Temperature... warm and nice.\" \"Everything is normal.\" \"Nice.\" \"Oh no, Aquascum!\" \"That's it for the escape plan.\" \"It's ruined. \"Then what will we do about... the mean girl?\" \"The mean girl! The mean girl!\" Stay down, young one! False alarm. I can't take much more of this. What'll we do when that brat gets here?\" \"I'm thinking.\" \"Gabriel! Nora! I'm coming!\" \"Help me! Help me!\" Swim down! Come on, young one! \"Everybody jump in!\" Swim down! \"That's it!\" What is that? Good work! Gabriel! Nora! Sharkbait! Roll, young one! Lean! Lean! Whoops. That would've been a bad fall. Gabriel! Don't let me go upside-down! Just stay calm, Nora. You won't go upside-down. I promise. You'll be OK. The mean girl! Do any of these ships look familiar to you? No, but the ship has to be here somewhere. Come on, Emma. We'll find it. I'm so excited. Are you excited? Emma, wake up. Wake up, come on. Duck! That's not a duck. It's a big bird! No! I didn't come this far to be food! Hey, big bird. Would you look at that? What? What? What? The sun just came up and Gerald has had too much already. A group of small fish were swimming together. A little fish named Nemo got lost from his father. His father and his friend Dory went looking for him. \n\nNemo was caught by some bigger fish and put in a fish tank. His father and Dory tried to save him. There was a big fight between the big fish and the little fish. \n\nIn the end, Nemo's father and Dory were able to rescue Nemo and take him back home to the ocean. Dory was scared that she would forget everything again without Nemo's father to help her remember. But Nemo's father said they could stay together so Dory wouldn't forget. They all swam away happily back to the ocean. \"Have you seen my dad?\" \"Got you!\" \"Hey!\"\"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"Come back here!\" \"You let him go!\" \"Dad!\"\"Dad!\"\"Dad!\" \"Dad!\" \"Dad!\" \"Excuse me.\" \"Are you all right?\" \"I don't know where I am.\" \"I don't know what's going on.\" \"I think I lost someone, but I can't remember.\" \"It's OK.\" \"I'm looking for someone, too.\" \"Hey, we can look together.\" \"I'm Dory.\" \"I'm Nemo.\" \"Nemo? That's a nice name.\" \"Dad!\"\"Dad!\"\"Dad!\" \"Wait a minute. Is it your dad or my dad?\"\"My dad.\"\"Got it.\" \"Dad!\"\"Where are we, anyway?\"\"Dad!\"\"Dad!\" Oh. SY...SH...SY city. P. Sherman, 42 WA Way, SY city.\" \"Nemo! It's you! You're Nemo! Yes, yes, I'm Nemo! You're Nemo! You were dead. I saw you. And here you are! I found you. You're not dead. And your father... Your father! You know my father?! Where is he? This way! He went this way. Quick! Have you seen an orange fish swim by? It looks just like him!\"\"But bigger!\" \"Yeah, I saw him, bluey. But I'm not telling you where he went... and there's no way you're gonna make me.\" Mine. All right! I'll talk! He went to the fishing grounds. Hey, look out! I'm sorry. I'm just trying to get home. \"Dad!\"\"Dad!\"\"Dad!\" \"Nemo?\"\"Daddy!\"\"Nemo?\"\"Dad!\"\"Nemo's alive!\"\"Dad!\"\"Nemo's alive!\" Dory? Nemo! Daddy! Nemo! I'm coming, Nemo! \"Dad!\"\"Nemo!\" Thank goodness. It's all right, son. It's gonna be OK. Turn around! You're going the wrong way! Look out! Oh, my... Help!\"\"Help!\"\"Help!\" Dory! Come on! Help!\"\"Help!\"\"Help!\" \"Help!\" \"Help!\" \"Get us away!\" \"No, no, no!\" \"Diana!\" \"Dad, I know what to do!\" \"Nora!\" \"No!\" \"We have to tell all the fish to swim down together!\" \"Get out of there now!\" \"I know this will work!\" \"No, I am not going to lose you again!\" \"There's no time!\" \"It's the only way to save Diana!\" \"I can do this.\" \"You're right.\" \"I know you can.\" \"Lucky fin!\" \"Now, go! Hurry! Tell all the fish to swim down!\" \"Well? You heard my child! Come on!\" \"Diana, you have to tell everybody to... Swim down together! Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Swim down! Everybody swim down! Come on, you have to swim down! Down! Swim down!\" \"Swim down!\" \"Swim down!\" \"Swim down!\" \"Swim down!\" \"Don't give up! Keep swimming! Just keep swimming! That's it! It's working! Keep swimming!\" \"Keep swimming!\" \"Keep swimming!\" \"Just keep swimming!\" \"Keep swimming!\" \"Come on, Dad! You're doing great, child!\" \"That's my dad. Let's get to the bottom!

Oh, no. Nora!\" \"Nora?\" \"Nora?\" \"It's OK. Parent is here. Parent has you. Parent? Oh, thank goodness. Parent... I don't hate you. Oh, no, no, no. I'm so sorry, Nora. Hey, guess what? What? Sea turtles... I met one. And it was 150 years old. 150? Yes. Someone said they only live to be 100. Someone? Do you think I would cross the entire ocean... and not know as much as Someone? It was 150! Not 100! Who is this Someone who knows everything? Time for school! Get up! Let's go! Time for school! Get up! Let's go! I'm gonna win! No, you're not! I did it! Adam's father said, \"Oh, my own son beats me!\" Adam said, \"Climb aboard, explorers.\" A sea creature said to another, \"With things like these, who needs other things?\"\n\"Hello, Benjamin,\" said a creature. \"Who's this?\" It replied, \"A student from another group.\" \"I'm from a different group, friend!\" \"Sweet!\" \"Totally.\"\n\"Seriously, Cameron,\" said another creature. \"Did you really do all the things you say you did?\"\n\"Pardon me,\" said a friendly creature. \"Hello. Don't be alarmed. We wanted to make sure our newest member got home safely.\" \"Thanks, all,\" said Benjamin. \"See you next week. Keep up with the program. Remember, sea creatures are friends, not food!\" \"Bye!\"\n\"Hold on, here we go!\" said Adam. \"Next stop, knowledge!\" \"Bye, son! Have fun!\" said Adam's father. \"Bye, Dad!\" said Adam. \"Oh! Mr. David, wait. I forgot something. Love you, Dad.\" \"I love you, too, son,\" said his father. \"Dad? You can let go now,\" said Adam. \"Sorry. Go have an adventure,\" said his father. \"Good-bye!\" \"See ya later, friends!\" said Adam. \"Bye, Ethan!\" said another creature. \"Benjamin,\" corrected Adam. \"Bye, Benjamin!\" \"See you after school, Frank!\"\n\"Bye, Dad!\" said Adam again. \"Bye, Dad!\" \"Bye, son,\" said his father.\nAdam's mother said, \"Gabriel, I don't understand it. Here this thing has a promise to last forever, and it breaks! I had to clean the water area myself, take all the sea creatures out, put them in bags, and... Where did the sea creatures go?\"\n\"Come on, Hannah! Hurry!\" said some creatures. \"You can do it! Just a little further. That's the shortest red light I've ever seen! Come on, Hannah!

{"text": "Adam was in a long line to see a fun show. He was waiting for Grace, the girl who sings songs on the big stage. Adam tried to tell Grace he would be there. \n\nAdam saw a bad cut on his body. He wished someone else saw it too. A rude man who acted like he knew everything told Adam to close his eyes for a kiss. Adam said with the birds he would share this lonely view. Adam said he would walk to the moon if needed. \n\nAdam and Grace went all around the world together. They had fun times and saw many places like forests and mountains. Adam said life is beautiful. He told Grace he saw love flow like a stream.\n\nAdam saw Grace's elegant but tired face. He thought her bloodshot smile was wild and beautiful. He felt he had no words for how he felt about her. Adam said there is nothing better than love.\n\nDeep in a special place, it was hard for Adam to know what came first. Under water where thoughts can breathe, Grace was made in the sea just like him. Adam felt he was everywhere and everything when looking at stars. Psychic changes were born in Grace's heart. Adam said he was with her.\n\nAdam asked Grace if he could write on her hand with a pencil. He asked what he could fly his kite on, and if she wanted to turn on her light. He told her to take a look at what was on display for her. Adam said they would find a place together in perfect weather. He felt he would live forever with her.\n\nAdam said to throw away the television. He said to break from it and recreate a new vision. He said it was a story being told over and over that was getting old. Adam said to pull the plug on television and take the stage instead.Alice was a little kid. She liked to listen to music. The music made her think. \n\n\"Not another person doing things just for themselves,\" she said. \"Never stop making the sounds we love. We make a special promise to create what is true. You are with me and what I do.\"\n\n\"My name is Peace. This is my time. Can I get a little bit of power? The power of being equal is not what it should be yet. It fills me up like a tree with no inside.\"\n\nAlice was very upset. She said, \"I can't forget, because the memory stays. Count them off quickly. Take me to the place. I have a mark from the place with strong beliefs. Dealing with what I have been given. Giving up blood just to exist. Rub me wrong and I get mad. No, I cannot get to this.\"\n\n\"People in pain, I do not like it. Change your brain, you who hates others. Little brother, do you hear me? Have a heart, oh come close to me. Sadness is not my friend, but I will bend before I break.\"\n\n\"What I see is craziness. Whatever happened to being good to others?\"", "hash": "2c45a93226943cbbe7477e2a96a50b20f055fe8539090b4cf8f2d96314a8c003"}
{"text": "\"Two years later, it was Crime Branch, MA city.\" \"Adam I.P.S. Assistant commissioner of Police.\" \"This is Adam, Benjamin, Cameron, David, Ethan, intelligence.\" \"Folks, Frank Gaja.\" \" Hello!\" \"You would have heard about him.\" \"He has now been transferred to Crime Branch.\" \"He will be with you throughout the entire operation.\" \"And of course Mr. Gabriel.\" \"Crime Branch, MU Police, retired.\" \"Encounter specialist!\" \"He has been involved in many encounters.\" \"He has put down many bad guys in one year.\" \"He is one of the best.\" \"Gabriel is a good friend too.\" \"I have requested him to be an advisor to you.\" \"Gladly!\" \" This is my Criminal Intelligence Unit.\" \"This team was assembled by me.\" \"These folks are hand picked by me. And will report directly to me.\" \"Gabriel, Adam, and Benjamin worked together in CO city.\" \"Cameron and David worked together in TU city in Law and Order.\" \"They were together in Training.\" \"These reports contain information about 4 main bad guys in this region.\" \"Bad Guy One! Bad Guy Two! Bad Guy Three! Bad Guy Four! We are getting information about them every day. We have information that Bad Guy Four will be in the city soon. We are waiting for your instructions. We are ready for the hunt.\" \"Many encounters. In this city alone! Many were successful and one was a failure. But everybody only talked about the operation that failed. So the whole department will be watching you. To see what you are able to do. You can do it. It is all in the mind. These operations require a totally different mind set.\" \"Everything is here! From the moment you drop a bad guy, life is never going to be same. Their families and gangs will not take it silently. They will think you came there with the idea of killing the bad guy. They will seek revenge! And most of the time they do not target your life, but your courage and the lives of your dear ones.\" \"There were 3 of us. We knew no fear. They called us \"The Best Ones\".\" \"I am near Kasi Theater. Keep the money ready.\" David was moved from the Crime Branch to the Control Room. \nThe Control Room job was easy. David was happy to do any work given to him.\n\"The city...\" David thought, \"Keep your eyes open and you will see bad people everywhere.\"\nTwo boys were sitting and talking. David told them, \"You can sit anywhere if you are not bothering anyone.\"\nThe boys asked, \"We should not sit here, Sir? We should not talk here, Sir?\"\nDavid said, \"You can sit anywhere you like if you are not a problem for others.\" Maya was a beautiful girl. She was like a fantasy, a mystery. When Isaac saw the places she moved around, he felt like he knew her for years. There were desires in everything seen at first sight. She would charm him at first sight. She would stretch her limbs beautifully, like a flower. When she talked making gestures with her finger, it felt like there was music in the wind. In the dimple on her cheek, one could plant little saplings. There was something different and attractive in her, like flowers holding pollen. There was a special fragrance in her. The beautiful folds of her clothes were like fans. The tresses on her shoulders were like dark forests. When she passed by, one's head would turn involuntarily. Isaac loved Maya deeply. Adam went to the NE city. He saw Emma. \"Emma, come here,\" Adam said. Emma did not like Adam. But Adam liked Emma's way. Adam said to his friend, \"I will take you home and come back later.\" The friend said, \"I cannot wait. You must pay the fine and go.\" Adam said, \"I have no money left. I spent it all at the show. This car is not mine. My papers are at home.\" A teacher named Emma and a student named Olivia had a problem. Some bad people were bothering Olivia. Emma asked Adam, a nice man, for help. \n\nAdam said, \"Don't be afraid. Come with me.\" They went together to talk to the bad people. Adam wanted to help Olivia feel safe again.\n\nThe bad people ran away when they saw Adam. Olivia was happy and thanked Adam. Adam said, \"I am glad I could help. Stay near me and your teacher. You are safe now.\" Olivia felt much better. \"Would you like to join us?\" \"Sorry, I'm working now.\" \"The leader is coming this way, I need to be here.\" \"Thanks.\" \"You go on.\" \"So join us after the leader is gone.\" \"We'll wait for you.\" \"Will you join us then?\" \"I'm not sure. I don't know how much time it'll take.\" \"Don't wait for me.\" \"You go on, okay?\" \"Okay... bye.\" \" Bye...\" \"Sir, is that your future wife?\" \" Mind your own business, Kevin.\" \"Tears which had long forgotten to drop from my eyes... fell on her forehead that day.\" \"I had seen many bad accidents.\" \"Bad things... nothing ever really disturbed me.\" \"But when I saw her badly hurt, it killed me.\" \"Kevin - her name is Emma. She's a teacher in ST school. Tell the school, and tell her house also. Give them my number.\" \" Okay, sir.\" \"No... no... today is Sunday. School will be closed. Call the principal at home and tell them. There's a coffee shop next to the place we were standing. She said she had come there with a friend. Let's wait for 24 hours, I think she should be okay.\" \" Ok doctor. Hello! Hello sir. How are you? It's very painful. You'll be alright. I'll get the doctor. Leader sir... You missed the leader after all. Instead, you were taking me to the hospital in your car. Couldn't you have joined me for a coffee when I invited you? Why are you so serious? I was just kidding. I kept looking at you... I forgot to look in front of me. For the first time in our city, the water truck won't be blamed. Hello! - Hello. - She's Rachel, Emma's sister. What happened? How is she now? - She's okay now. She was hit by a water truck on MT Road. She got hurt on her head and body... but she'll get better. You can go in and see her. You're spending a lot of time at the hospital. I went to see her twice. That's all. But I'm always thinking about her, even when I'm working. So you've finally come around. So this is it. It will bring two persons together. Changing me, becoming a part of my heart, you do not hurt me slowly. Is today any different from yesterday? Am I the same person today also? Do not charm me with your talk. I want to say one thing... I must look into your face to say that. Should we two be alone here? I have also changed. I have become more soft. If you know it, why do you not tell me? Whom should I ask? Will you not tell me? On the way there are flower gardens. Never once I had stopped and admired their beauty. I never thought I will stop and pluck a flower to admire it. The flower you pluck, I will adorn in my hair. I have this intention now. But, like always, it is silence that speaks for me. I am developing wings like birds, and flying beyond stars. I do not know if there is any place more beautiful than this in the world. I do not want to know also. This wood house is ours. When my parents were alive, we used spend all our weekends here. This house has seen my days of joy and grief. I felt you must come here. You have made me come here and made me talk. You made me smile. What is the meaning of the mischief in your eyes? My outlook is new, my thoughts are new. I have changed because of you. Your eyes must search me in a crowd. I have gone mad with such crazy ideas. Shall we go? It is getting late. I had a good time after a long time. Thanks to you. I want to talk to you. Do not look at your watch, I have to talk. There is something I know about you. What is it? It happened on the day of the accident. That day when the water truck hit me I fell as if somebody threw me. There was terrible pain. I could not bear it. Suddenly I felt I was being carried by someone. Ethan! I saw. You made me sleep on your lap in the car. I saw. Your shirt was drenched with my blood. You tied a kerchief to stop the bleeding. You ordered the driver Nathan to go fast. Adam said, \"I saw it all.\" \n\"You cried then,\" Emma said. \"Why?\"\n\"Later you took me to a hospital,\" Adam said. \"I went into darkness. But I knew I would not die. At that moment, I prayed. When I woke up, you should be there. I must see you first. It happened.\"  \n\"Maybe those tears were for someone else,\" Emma said. \n\"No, only I was there,\" Adam said. \"When I opened my eyes in the hospital, you were there. I did not feel pain. I felt happy. I love you, truly.\"\n\"No, Adam,\" Emma said. \"Do not say you love me. Before, we had something nice between us. Let it be like that.\"\nAdam said, \"I just wanted to tell you what I had in my mind. I knew you would say this. Let us go.\"\nEmma was changing Adam. He did not like that. He wanted to go far away from her, but he could not.\nLater, Adam said, \"Emma, I cannot focus. I forgot my math. I cannot talk freely at school. I lost my appetite and cannot sleep. It is because of you. I thought I would never come see you, because I hate pleading. But now, I am not bothered. I like you. I came to ask you to accept my love.\" Adam went to prison for a long time. The police arrested him for many bad things he did. After some time, Adam escaped from prison. This made many people very surprised and scared.\n\nAdam went to another city after escaping. The police looked at his old file again. They learned that Adam's brother Cameron was also a bad person they were looking for. \n\nAdam had many friends who would do anything for him, even very bad things. Adam told his friends to kidnap a police officer's young child. His friends would keep the child for two days and make the officer very scared. After two days, they would kill the child and send the body back to the officer. This would make all police officers afraid of Adam and his friends. \n\nAdam's friends also wanted to put up a big picture of Adam across from the police office. Adam said no one should give him anything like flowers. His friends then took Producer's young child Arun to the studio, because Producer told them to bring Arun there. Let's show who we are to this NE city, Brother. Criminal activities flourished. The NE city was caught in a crime wave. In 3 months, Samuel kidnapped 6 people. 3 extortions... 13 bad things... 11 dacoities... How is the vehicle? Superb brother, moving very fast. Watch carefully. It may really go away quickly. The number is good. At that time group did not know that there was one Patrick with Samuel. and that he was the brain behind Samuel's plans. This city is ours. From one place to another place, everything is ours. Patrick, you've brought good fortune with you. Have it... Have it. We aimed at Samuel. We decided to stop him. Come, let's go. No problem. I'm telling you brother. You're having high temperature. If you come in this condition, it'll be bad for you. Hey, entire city police is after my life. This fever will not kill me. Come Patrick. You'll never listen to me. Hey, take out the vehicle. Person, it's Samuel. No need to go to one place. Another place. Come straight inside. You must be there in an hour. You're coming alone, got it? Yes, Officer... tell me. We've gathered here. Is the information correct? Information is correct. They're meeting at another place not at one place. Person has arrived. I think we should take positions. Police! Police... move. Samuel how sad you got caught. Officer, this is what you wanted right? Yes. What shall we do now? Like in a famous movie, shall we handcuff him and drag him on the streets. No... we'll stop him here. Samuel, did we send message to pack your things and leave this place. You didn't listen then, now you're going to be stopped. Or let's put him away. He'll reveal some people's names. We'll catch them. There's a large group behind him. Hey, who needs people's names. Officer, ask him if he believes in Good. If so, ask him to say his last words. He appears to believe in Good or else tell him to close his eyes. Hello. Good morning. Come in. Nathan, please call Samuel. This is my home. I never invite anyone here. I like to be alone. But I will change that rule for you. Why is it so dark? I never open the curtains or windows. I like darkness. But it is nice now. I'm not saying it must be like this. I'm just saying it's nice this way. From now on, your life will be colorful. Let's sit here. Gabriel! You betrayed Samuel, didn't you? You forgot that Samuel gave you life. Gabriel, you will never be forgiven. Your family must die. And you must watch them die. Zachary, Benjamin, chop everyone. Our children will easily get into my school. No need to apply early. No need to pay extra. You don't need to wait in line. Then? I'm a good Math student. In simple words, a Math scholar. Our kids don't need Math tutoring. You don't need to worry about it. Anyway, you don't know Math, but I do. I'll take care of it. Math is very important, isn't it? Then, I'm a good singer. I learned classical music and guitar. Trust me. Then? I was very big as a child. Now I'm slim from dieting and exercise. Slim? Yes, slim. If I stop dieting, you won't need a bed. I'll become like a bed. Where were you all this time? I was here, but you didn't see me. I want to live with you from now on. Hello, it's Cameron speaking. Benjamin, they went into Gabriel's home and attacked everyone. They had knives and chopped everyone terribly. This place is a mess. I'm speaking from here. They killed 5 people: his wife and children. They beat Gabriel but left him alive. Adam and Benjamin were talking about someone attacking Victor's home. Benjamin said, \"They went into that home and attacked everyone.\" Adam asked, \"How could they find him?\" Benjamin thought, \"I think they got the information from the department.\" Adam said, \"No way...\"\n\nThen, there was a phone call. The caller threatened Adam, calling him an officer. The caller said Victor's condition was very bad and it would take a long time to clean up the mess from his home. The caller said killing Ethan was Adam's biggest mistake and he would pay for Ethan's death.\n\nThe caller threatened to kidnap Adam's girlfriend, hurt her, and leave her body at Adam's home. He also threatened to kill the other officers who were with Adam when Ethan was killed. The caller said this would happen soon, maybe even the next day.\n\nAdam told Matthew and Nathan to check if anyone suspicious was outside. Nathan saw a parked vehicle on the street corner. Adam said there had been a phone threat and told them to be alert. Then Adam said he had to leave, apologizing to Grace. \"Okay, I'll go home.\" \"You don't need to go home, stay with me, I need to take you somewhere else.\" \"Hello!\" \"Control room.\" \"Adam speaking.\" \"Benjamin, listen carefully.\" \"I need 5 of our boys immediately they need to meet me near my house.\" \"Tell them to come in an auto...\" \"no need of a vehicle.\" \"There's a statue.\" \"2 streets from my house.\" \"Tell them to park there and wait for me.\" \"Tell them to come.\" \"I'll inform the leader.\" \"Okay.\" \"Do you usually go out of your house like this?\" \"Sometimes... come on...\" \"Careful.\"\"Careful.\" \"Careful.\" \"Stay here.\" Friend. Cameron, I need to go out. - ls that, so friend? Sit in the auto. I'll come in a minute friend. Come, friend. My friend... - You're marrying? You never told me friend. Go to David's house. Hello David, I'm Adam speaking. Are you at home? Okay, I'm coming there with Emma. Where's Ethan? Tell me, Frank. is he inside? - Yes Frank. The girl? - She's also inside... with him. Security? 2 friends are there... Any other security or vehicles or men? Nothing. Can we go now? - l think we can. Hey, tell me in one word. Shall we go now or not? We'll go, Frank. If he goes out, follow him and tell me. I'll be there in a short time. Threats are not uncommon in a friend's life. But I was sure this was not an empty threat. I don't know who he was. He had already gone to Gabriel. Now he was going to Emma. Through Emma, he was after me. I had a feeling that he would go to my house that evening. I prepared. Hi... - Hi. Come. - Hello.\"\" Hello. - Hello. Hi... - Hi. - Please come in. Please, come in. Are you leaving now? We'll be back in a short time. - No problem. I've many things to tell her about you... take your time. Adam, who is he? \"You should not sleep here. I do not like anyone sleeping on this couch,\" said Adam. \"Go to Emma's room. It is a big bed. You can sleep in a corner.\"\n\n\"Officer Adam, where are you going?\" asked Emma. \"Did I disturb you? I did not sleep at all.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Adam. \"Okay Emma, go to sleep. I will sleep downstairs. We have to leave early in the morning. I will wake you up. I just came up to tell you.\"\n\n\"Where are you going?\" asked Emma. \"Sit down. Let's talk for a while. How did your work go? Was it successful? Sit down. Are you not sleepy? Tell me, what happened?\"\n\n\"Emma, there is a problem. You are in danger because of me and my job. We are investigating something. Until it is over, if you stay in a safe place, I will feel better. Tomorrow let's...\"\n\nEmma leaned on Adam's shoulder and said, \"I do not think there is a safer place than that. You always protect me! How can I be in danger when you are here? You will fight bravely for me, even if they try to hurt you. There is only danger for your enemies!\"\n\nAdam asked, \"Do you know how old you are?\"\n\"24 years,\" replied Emma.\n\"Ask me why I asked you.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"I have been waiting for this kiss for 24 years. Now, I cannot wait another second,\" said Adam.\n\n\"What are you doing to me, Adam? I want to live with you in your house. I want you too,\" said Emma. \"One month ago, you rejected me. Today you say you want me. I think maybe police officers can change their minds easily.\"\n\nA bad person said, \"Where is the girl? Where do your officer friends live? If you do not tell me, you will die.\"\n\nAdam replied, \"I am not afraid. I will protect Emma and my friends.\"\n\nEmma said, \"Will you not sleep? It is early morning now.\" Adam and Emma got married. Adam said, \"We should not all be together in the same place. I don't want many people to know. It's too risky. We'll have a get together after I come here.\" Adam asked for Grace's number to tell her about the wedding.\n\nThe next day, Adam and Emma had their wedding. Adam said, \"Of all the marriages I have seen, ours was the best.\"\n\nAdam called Henry and said, \"My wedding was at 2 in the afternoon. Henry also asked me to send his best wishes. Now I am not at Emma's house. Emma has some land, 50 km away from the PO city. It's on the way to the CH town. A small house built near the water. A beautiful place. We're spending tonight here. I'm calling from this place. I'll be here until tomorrow evening. I'll leave the day after tomorrow, along with Emma. Don't worry. We'll talk more when I get back, okay?\"\n\nAdam continued, \"Grace didn't call me. I missed all of you. If you all were here, it would've been nice.\" Henry said Grace had just called him and she would call Adam too. Adam said, \"Okay, bye buddy. Take care. Bye.\" \"Are you happy?\" \"Yes.\" \"Why?\" \"I do not think you are.\" \"You look worried and tense. Adam?\" \"He was a good friend.\" \"That is okay.\" \"You do not worry about it.\" \"Are you happy?\" \"You wished for this, right?\" \"I am happy.\" \"Certainly.\" \"I want to talk a lot to you.\" \"I want to tell you many things...\" \"How our lives should be...\" \"What I think about you...\" \"Lots of things.\" \"But Alice, this one night will not be enough for that.\" \"Tell me.\" \"I will tell you.\" \"Close your eyes.\" \"I will close my eyes.\" \"Tell me.\" \"Hey, what are you doing?\" \"I have many wishes... Is a day enough to say them all? Tell me. I have many wishes, will a day be enough to say them all? Oh dear, we will ask the night to become long. Oh Dream Lover! I had dreamed only for this day. Oh dear! Let us talk many things through our eyes. I like that you are noble and not wild. I like you talking while looking straight into my eyes. I will be in joy when I see you coming from far away. I will be singing my favorite song. Your face is a smiling face. It will stay in my heart until I pass away. I am going to see my dream in your eyes. Clouds of evening are moving across the sky. When I see them, they remind me of how you walk. I saw the sun setting over the river. I waited for you to appear, strong and manly. And I feel that I belong to you. My joy is overwhelming. It is going beyond the sky. I would like to pass away. Did I not tell you I would come? Did I not tell you? Hey, hurt him and throw him in the water. Hey, did I not tell you to pass away that day? Kill him. Police, what man? Why won't you pass away? From now on, she will be with me. Watch. You bad person, this is for Samuel. Benjamin, pass away... Hey, take her. My CA city uniform meant everything to me. Today, it asked for my Victoria's life. \"They would have taken her by now.\" \"It's all because of me.\" \"I shouldn't die.\" \"I need to save Maya.\" \"I need to save my Maya.\" \"Adam, oh no... oh no.\" \"Alice, oh God!\" \"Go away, person.\" \"Alice, she's alive...\" \"Take her...\" \"I've got her.\" \"Victoria, find out where Maya is.\" \"She may be in the house.\" \"*Will I get the message?\" \"*Will it come through the air *or will it get lost?\" \"*Will I get the message?\" \"*Will it come in the dream *or will it get lost?\" \"*Will it tell the message...\" \"*Will it run away halfway?\" \"*I saw words saying *\"Only good things will happen\".\" \"*I had kept a red picture, *a happy statue on the south side.\" \"*You overcame all the problems.\" \"*You've proved something false.\" \"*Oh mean person! come take me.\" \"*I've worn a dark dress.\" \"*I'm waiting in the darkness.\" \"*You came as a mean person.\" \"*They hurt me and give me pain.\" \"*Even though it hurts, *you gave me good feelings.\" \"*I wanted you to come.\" \"*I couldn't sleep thinking of the past.\" \"*I don't want to get separated from you.\" \"*Please, come again...\" \"Yuck.\" \"Shouldn't I touch you?\" \"Okay, come on...\" \"Come on...\" \"Come on...\" \"Okay, don't come. Are you from the north?\" Which place are you from? You don't look like from here. Your skin and hair color are nice. Yuck! But, you're leftovers from them. That's the only thing stopping me. You two did it last night, didn't you? Was it good? Okay, don't wear this. You don't need this, remove it. I said, remove it and throw it away. Adam will be lying dead under the water. Those 4 put on a good show, didn't they? They thought just because they had guns, they could hurt anyone. Won't this be a good lesson for them? From now on, every single police officer will be scared to come forward. Tomorrow when they read the news, will they call themselves \"Police officers\"? Adam was in the hospital. He said to the doctor, \"I need to leave this place. Please call Thomas. His phone number is 9841065486.\"\n\nThe doctor said, \"Please be calm, Adam. You have been here since two days ago. Nothing bad has happened.\"\n\nAdam said, \"No, something very bad happened. Call Thomas right away!\"\n\nThe doctor left the room. Then Benjamin came in. He said, \"Adam, I did something very wrong. The bad people took my wife Grace. They said they would hurt her if I did not help them. So I told them where you would be one evening. I did not know what I was doing. I am very sorry.\"\n\nBenjamin started to cry. He said, \"Please do not forgive me, Adam. I failed as a good person.\" \"I've decided to take you to a place,\" Adam said. \"Let's go,\" Bella replied. \"Wash your face and get ready,\" Adam said. \"We've to leave this place soon,\" he continued. \"You should look like an angel, okay?\" Adam asked.\n\n\"Wait...\" Adam said. \"Sir, look there,\" Bella said. \"'Adam' 'Bella',\" she added.  \n\n\"What's this, Bella?\" Adam asked in shock. \"Let us open it,\" Bella suggested.\n\n\"No, Bella. No...\" Adam protested. \"I know what will be inside that box.\"\n\n\"Adam, there won't be anything in that box,\" Bella assured. \"I'm going to open it.\"\n\n\"Bella, who's he?\" Adam wondered. \"What does he want?\" \n\n\"Why should we bow down to him?\" Adam questioned. \"Can't we do anything to him?\"\n\n\"Oh God!\" Adam cried out in horror upon seeing the contents of the box. \"Sir, control yourself, sir,\" Bella said, trying to calm Adam.\n\n\"Bella, I'm not able to bear it,\" Adam said, clearly distressed. \"Bella, is that Charlotte?\" he asked, referring to the contents of the box. \"Tell me. Bella, ask them to check whether it's Charlotte.\"\n\n\"Oh! I can't bear it,\" Adam continued, clearly anguished. \"Bella, check whether it's Charlotte or not.\"\n\n\"I don't deserve to live,\" Adam said, overcome with guilt. \"Bella, sorry, I betrayed you. I betrayed you, Bella. I betrayed everyone. Bella, my Charlotte died because of me only. Emma was taken away... I'm not fit to live.\"\n\n\"Relax... Be calm,\" Bella tried to soothe Adam. \"Sorry,\" Adam said, apologizing.\n\n\"Adam, what are you doing?\" Bella asked, alarmed by Adam's distressed state. \"I've come here alone.\" \"Let's talk.\" \"Talk...\" \"Talk...\" \"Talk friend...\" \"Let's talk...\" \"Talk...\" \"Look, all of them are sleeping.\" \"How many people?\" \"All for one person.\" \"Samuel!\" \"Oh no!\" \"He's not a good person.\" \"He's not kind.\" \"He should go away.\" \"His leaving is good for everyone.\" \"So, I made him go away.\" \"You've come for him.\" \"I'll make you go away too.\" \"If some other friend comes for you, I'll make them go away too.\" \"Some jobs are like a battle field. But with a difference. What's aimed at there isn't a worker's life, but their honesty, bravery and loved ones. Their uniforms may get dirty. Because people wear them. Just because some of them haven't lost their kindness, the bad thoughts inside us are still quiet. We sleep peacefully as they work hard to keep us safe. After many weeks... I've told the helpers. They'll be there soon. I'll get there in a little while. Friend, I'll take care of it. I'm not saying that it must be like this. I'm just saying that this way it's nice. From now on your life is going to become colorful... see.", "hash": "357eb1edeaa16427655f785facfced2dbeedb5bae1e95cd119786fc597f0cf1b"}

What do you want?\" \"I have the escaped person. He's close by me. He's still alive. I'm bringing him to KR world as we agreed.\" \"No. I'm sending meeting spot info. Be there in two days. I hope you have all the payment?\" \"You'll get what I promised. Happy to work with you, Captain.\" \"Like always.\" How much are they paying you? You said the KL home world, KR world. I think this is about me leaving prison. You don't know what I'm accused of. You're right, and I don't care to. The sign's steady. It looks like he's orbiting a G-Type star. Go to alert. It seems like a beacon of some kind. It's making a warp sign just like our friend's. A trick! Anything on sensors? We'll have to start over. I'm getting too much noise from that thing. It's messing up our scans. Then get rid of it. I have no idea what the Klingons are paying you... but whatever it is... Starfleet will double it. I don't take bribes from criminals. I'm not a criminal. Klingon judges say you are. My \"crime\" was helping ship of refugees. That was very good of you. You'll think twice before doing that again. It's clear I'll never get the chance. I was sent to prison on RP planet for life. Ever heard of it? I know RP planet. A ship sailed by. \"You cannot catch me,\" said Adam. \"I have something you want.\"\n\"Give me the person,\" said Benjamin. \"Or I will take action.\"\n\"You cannot stop me,\" said Adam. \"Your friend told you where I was, did he not?\"\n\"If I cannot catch you, Cameron will be like air,\" said Benjamin.\n\"Hold on tight,\" said Adam. He used tricks to evade Benjamin. Benjamin lost his engines and landed. But Adam's engines failed too.\n\"We must land here,\" said Adam. \"But Cameron is on the land.\" \"I thought I could take a shorter path... by going through a tiny part... of QU country.\" \"I learned quickly there's no such thing... as a tiny part of QU country.\" \"We were lucky to escape... with our lives... but we lost something.\" \"They took your vehicle?\" \"And what was inside it, too.\" \"My sibling never forgave me.\" \"I've been trying to get it back ever since.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"Did you really think I wanted this machine fixed?\" \"You're taking me to be punished!\" \"Don't worry.\" \"We'll meet Ulysses on time.\" \"Feeling any better?\" \"I'm hungry.\" \"Our meals will be here soon.\" \"I wasn't talking about food.\" \"I'm working as fast as I can.\" \"The medicine should help make most of your sickness go away.\" \"There's an easier way to get better.\" \"I'd prefer to try the normal way first.\" \"You have the cure. It's wrong for you to not give it to me, Doctor.\" \"This sickness of yours was caused in a special way. We can't be sure that the special cure would help.\" \"I'm willing to try.\" \"Zoe... Don't be scared. I won't hurt you. You're messing up my medicine! You need to be put to sleep again. No more needles! One of us should probably answer that. It could be news about the leader. This is Patrick. Anyone hungry in there? I brought you some supper. Just in time, Thomas. It would be best if you stayed here. How are you two doing? Well enough. Have you been able to find our leader? We're tracking another fast moving thing. Hopefully, this one's the real thing. Are those the ones you wanted? Yes, thank you. Is that food? Yeah. I had the chef make you some... Is she all right? She's developed a slight fever, nothing to worry about. Bridge to Thomas. Go ahead. We're approaching the place. On my way. Call if you need anything. What have you got? Two matching fast moving things, both in the air. More beacons. There is a machine on the surface. It seems to have engine damage, but it's not FR machine. Living signs? One. Open a way to talk. Yes? \"Sorry to bother you, but we're looking for a shuttle.\" \"Have you seen one?\" \"How much did the strangers offer you?\" \"Strangers?\" \"Look, there must be some sort of mistake here.\" \"We're looking for our friend.\" \"Your friend.\" \"He's got a price on his head.\" \"He's probably far away by now.\" \"Patrick, how far are we from the strangers?\" \"Less than six hours away.\" \"If that stranger is looking to get some kind of reward... we better find him before he gets there.\" \"Go that way.\" \"Take us to a different place.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"What are you doing here?\" I need your help. You shouldn't have brought him. You think I would have come here if I had another choice? I need a special part. And I suppose you have no way of paying for it. Do you know who this is? He's the only person who's ever escaped from a far away place. The strangers are offering a lot of money to get him back. Tell him. Tell him! If I give you the special part, you have to promise never to come back here. Of course I'm coming back. You're going to be my first helper. That was years ago. I work here now. Cleaning special parts? Is that how your children should see you? It's better than hunting bad people! You think that I enjoy spending my time with bad people like him? I have work to do. Please! Don't turn your back on me again. We can get something back. You won't want that thing after you see it. Why not? The strangers took everything from it. Every power part, every piece. The engines? They're gone. I'll give you the special part... but after that, I want you to leave. What do you plan to do now? Get that special part and put it in. And then? I suppose you'll give me to the strangers. I'll be... hurt very badly. And you'll get your money. But it won't get you that thing back. What are you trying to say? The strangers took your thing, your job... damaged your relationship with your brother. And what do you get in exchange? Money. Doesn't seem like a very fair trade to me. There was no nearby place. \"Henry will not go far,\" said David. \"Stop moving,\" said Alice. \"Should I get ready to fight?\" asked Ryan. \"No,\" said Alice. \"I want Henry to be safe.\"\n\n\"I see Henry.

They are getting ready to fight,\" said Ryan. \"Fight back!\" said Alice. \"Get Henry,\" said Alice.\n\n\"They are making it hard,\" said Ryan. \"Matthew?\" asked Alice. \"I am trying my best,\" said Matthew. \"Their fight spots are well protected,\" said Matthew. \"I got it!\" said Matthew. \"Bring Henry here,\" said Alice. \"Their fight is stopped,\" said Alice. \"Is Henry safe?\" asked Alice. \"Yes, Henry is safe here,\" said Ryan. \"Let us go away from here,\" said Alice.\n\n\"The tiny bug is gone from you,\" said Doctor Zoe. \"Your early start is over,\" said Doctor Zoe. \"Did I do bad things?\" asked Emma. \"Some people were worse,\" said Doctor Zoe. \"Did we...\" asked Emma. \"My people do not talk about those things,\" said Doctor Zoe. \"Please do not tell others,\" said Doctor Zoe. \"I will keep your secret,\" said Emma.\n\n\"Was it a hard trip?\" asked Alice. \"What about the others?\" asked Alice. \"We broke one of their parts.

I do not have a choice. You are a very impressive man, but you see everything as either good or bad, just like David. The world is so much more mixed up. No, it is simple. There is a war about to start and you are the only person who can help me stop it. What about the important person? He turned away from me. After many years of building a life together, a family, he turned me away. \"Wait until you get some help.\" \"Our people will come soon.\" \"We don't have time.\" \"Kevin's waiting for the meeting now.\" \"You need backup.\" \"If you want to help me, get me voice prints of Kevin and Mrs. Jessica for checking.\" \"Done.\" \"And a live sound feed to the WH country.\" \"You want to talk to the leader.\" \"Yes.\" \"OK.\" Keep the line clear.\" \"Copy.\" \"We're going to the CO place now.\" \"We need to get a SWAT team to his place.\" \"Stop there. Wait here for me.\" \"Come on. Let's get you ready.\" Take off your jacket. This is a wireless thing. They won't know to look for it. They won't be able to find it. This is crazy. We shouldn't do this alone. We don't have another choice. Remember, Kevin doesn't want to leave here without Henry. That's gotta be good for us. OK, say something. I'm scared. OK, it's working. Yes, Matthew. Mr. Leader, I am against any delay in our military actions. I have been from the start. But there is a good chance we'll get proof soon the CY recording is false. We know Second Wave brought the nuke into the country and we know they're helped by these three countries. What am I missing? I don't have all the details, but I just learned about a link between Second Wave and a man named Patrick. Who is he? He's apparently part of a group with contracts in the CS area. A group's behind the nuke? Benjamin believes he can get a confession from Patrick. He's set up a live sound feed. Our bombers are due to drop their loads in less than 20 minutes. Benjamin's meeting Patrick any minute. This is the live voice print. And this is the voice file we have which will prove that it is, in fact, Jessica. It's confirmed. The one below is Patrick? Yeah. Are you guys getting this? We're good here. How far out is our backup? They're 11 minutes out. That's too long. We've gotta go now. Just wait. We can't. We're already ten minutes past the meeting time. Is Prescott ready? \"That's your problem.\" \"Well, I just made it yours.\" \"Because you won't see Henry until I'm safe.\" \"Don't horse trade with me.\" \"Don't insult my intelligence.\" \"We got a match on Quinn's voice.\" \"Ryan, you got it.\" \"You're not going anywhere till I have Emma.\" \"That doesn't work for me.\" \"I'll call you on this line to give you Emma's location after I'm safely away.\" \"You don't need to know where I'm going.\" \"We're not getting what we need here.\" \"She'll get it for you.\" \"Now there's the matter of the recordings.\" \"They're right here.\" \"Every phone conversation between you and me.\" \"No. I want all of them, including CY country.\" \"Why CY country? You had nothing to do with that.\" \"Insurance.\" \"Insurance? Once the NE city goes to war, the government will never let that be exposed. Emma is the only one who can hurt us.\" \"Because she forged the CY country recording.\" \"Right. You got your proof. Let me go ahead.\" \"Get it confirmed from the NE city.\" \"She can't stay much longer.\" \"Are you satisfied?\" CTU wants to know if that's enough to prove it. Have you confirmed this is live and the voices have been made right? Yes, ma'am. So that's it. Yes. When I land... I'll call you. You're bluffin'. You don't have Emma, do you? Oh, yes, I do. No, you don't. Scott, take her out. Kill her. Run, Quinn! Come on. Come on. Mrs Palmer, get out of here. Go! Jack Bauer. You've caused me a lot of trouble today, Jack. You're not gonna give me Emma, are you? Our planes are three minutes from the targets. Doing sequence six one tango one. Target in view. Weapons lock. Are we go for a strike? Are we go for a launch? We are waiting command. Stop the attack. Stop, stop. What do you mean, Quinn's dead? How could that happen? I warned you not to use her. So we did use her and she failed. But it won't matter. Once the war starts we'll be OK. It isn't going to start. \"Why is that?\" \"The leader found out about the CR recording and stopped the attack.\" \"There will not be any war, Matthew.\" \"Well, we need to do this another way.\" \"Another way?\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"You will find out.\" \"It will start today.\" \"It is me.\" \"Go ahead.\" \"The leaders have reversed their earlier action.\" \"I have told the officers to continue serving you as the leader of the FR country.\" \"I see.\" \"I have also resigned, effective immediately, and those leaders who voted against you have also agreed to resign.\" \"Jack.\" \"Everyone... we came very close to war today. It is understandable that all of us reacted emotionally to the loud noise. But leaders are required to be patient beyond human limits. The kind of action we nearly took should only happen after all other avenues have been exhausted. After the strictest proof has been met. By removing me so quickly, you lowered those standards. And that was a big mistake. However, you are unlikely to make that mistake again. Therefore, I do not accept your resignations. We have a nation to heal today. And all of you play an important role in that healing process.\" \"Leader... I do not know what to say.\" \"There is nothing to say. We have work to do. That will be all.\" \"Jessica, set up a public meeting.\" \"When?\" \"As soon as you can. And I want it public. I want to speak to the people directly. They deserve my assurance.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Nathan, I want to thank you again for calling the team in the morning.\" \"Of course, Leader.\" \"But you should have been with me to the end. That is what I expected of you. That is why I chose you. I am removing you from your position, effective immediately.\" \"Yes, Leader.\" \"Thank you, sir.\" \"I cannot take all the credit myself. It is a great team Henry put together here.\" \"Yes, I will. Thank you, sir.\" \"Benjamin. That was a leader. He is so happy with what we did here today he does not know where to start.\" \"That is great.\" \"So what is up, my friend?\" \"Well... it is like this. Either fire me... or get out of my chair.\" \"Go home now,\" said Adam. \"The new workers are here.\" \"They know what to do.\" \"I will go home with Benjamin,\" Adam said. \n\"Adam... some people did well today,\" said Benjamin. \"You are one of them. You made hard choices and went against me. You were right.\"\n\"Thank you,\" said Adam. \"I will go home and rest now.\"\n\"Adam,\" said Benjamin. \"See you tomorrow.\"\n\"I need to look in your bag,\" said Charlotte.\n\"I am Diana and this is Emma,\" said Charlotte.\n\"Hello, honey,\" said Frank. \"Grace,\" said Grace.\n\"It will be okay,\" said Frank. \"I know. I love you.\"\n\"I love you too, Daddy,\" said Grace.\n\"I will take care of you,\" said Frank.\n\"Do not believe any stories you may hear,\" said Henry. \"When I know the truth, I will tell you myself.

{"text": "\"Hello, Adam.\" \"Do you want to try some snacks?\" \"I used to enjoy juggling.\" \"You still do, with numbers.\" \"What...\" \"But...\" \"Stop that boy!\" \"I'm sorry.\" \"This is my mistake.\" \"Why can't you look where you go?\" \"I just had my pocket taken.\" \"Are you hurt?\" \"There does not seem to be any damage.\" \"Is this your work?\" \"Yes.\" \"You're a famous painter.\" \"You have the advantage of me.\" \"I'm sorry, we've never met.\" \"I know your work. I'm a collector.\" \"Patrick.\" \"Is it for sale?\" \"I've been trying to sell it.\" \"What are you asking?\" \"Would you take two hundred coins?\" \"Two hundred?\" \"Are you serious?\" \"Perfectly.\" \"I was only asking fifty.\" \"You're too honest.\" \"Not at all. I'd have taken twenty.\" \"Well, it's too late.\" \"I do not have my wallet.\" \"Please, take my card.\" \"Come any evening, after early night.\" \"Please, take it.\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Who'd want to steal a famous painter's work?\" \"I wish somebody would.\" \"It'd be a sign of success.\" \"I think it's beautiful.\" \"Madison.\" \"Not another one.\" \"What do you think?\" \"Horrible.\" \"Still it matches all the others, I suppose.\" \"That's something.\" \"You have no taste.\" \"I have great taste.\" \"Yes, in men. But in art, you are a child.\" \"Dad! Can I have a puppy, please? I'll feed him and I'll walk him! I promise. Please?\" \"When you're older, Grace.\" \"But Nathan is older. He'll help.\" \"It's your idea, Grace.\" \"Please, Dad.\" \"When you are older.\" \"It's not fair, I shall sulk.\" \"I'd rather have sulks than a puppy.\" \"I agree.\" \"Mr. Patrick! Good day to you.\" \"Good day.\" \"I am Father Quinn. Your new landlord.\" \"How do you do?\" \"Well, well. Come. This way. Not much of a place, I'm afraid. As my friend in the FR island may have told you... I had it built for the teacher of the school here. \"In their hearts, they do not like their small lives.\" \"But they cannot escape.\" \"Let's go.\" \"I love my life.\" \"But then, what does money mean?\" \"Nothing.\" \"A person makes a lot of money, the world calls them a great person.\" \"They die... the world forgets them.\" \"But the artist?\" \"No, no.\" \"The artist touches the heart of the world and changes it.\" \"And the world remembers.\" \"That is greatness.\" \"We made it!\" \"But then, what does money mean?\" \"The artist touches the heart of the world and changes it.\" \"And the world remembers.\" \"That's greatness.\" \"Samuel, where have you been? Samuel.\" Gabriel. What are you doing, Gabriel? You were supposed to work on these this morning! Gabriel, work on these right away. We are losing money! What are you doing? Samuel, don't! Gabriel. Stop it! Stop it now! Do you want to be fired? You are fired! Paint? Yes, that's right. I see. And what are we going to live on? We have money that I've saved. And when it runs out? Feel better? Much better. Good. I want you to go back to the office, apologize to Mr. Bertin... tell him you had a problem and get your job back. Isabel, I am absolutely serious. I am done with my job. I am going to paint. You don't know anything about it! Isabel, I've got talent. I know it. Now we get to it. The story from Thomas. It's what I want to do. He's just saying nice things so you buy more of his paintings! What's the matter with you? You used to have some judgment. If you think I'm going to live like Lucy, I tell you, I am not. Isabel, what has happened to you? What are you talking about? When you accepted my proposal... I had no future, no money. You wanted to leave NE city. You wanted a life of adventure. You wanted to move to FR country! What has happened? I'll tell you, 4 children, Samuel. \"No, madam never buys at the door.\" \"Ethan, have you washed your hands?\" \"Let me see.\" \"The other one.\" \"Give it another wash.\" \"But Mama...\" \"Go on.\" \"Stop lolling about and put the food on the table.\" \"But I have a test tomorrow.\" \"Will you do as your told?\" \"Now.\" \"Where have you been?\" \"Where have you been?\" \"Where have you been?\" \"Where?\" \"I've written to my family.\" \"My grandma will take us.\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"I'm taking the children to CO city.\" \"Don't be ridiculous, Nora.\" \"What else do you expect me to do?\" \"It's only a matter of time before we'll be hungry, Patrick!\" \"There is no more money. Can you get that?\" \"We'll make do!\" \"We'll make...\" \"For goodness sake!\" \"For the first time in my life I am doing something that I want to do! Something that is good!\" \"And I will not give it up!\" \"What about the children? What about me? What do you want me to do? What?\" \"Do you want me to go back to PA city? To do work that I don't like? So that you can walk up and down the big street... in a carriage?\" 0r perhaps you would like to get a perfect spouse... for our daughter Alice. 0r turn our three sons into money workers. It is useless. It is worthless. First you were going to be the best at art. That didn't last very long, did it? Then off to RO city. The children get taken out of their schools... and they lose their friends. And it's all worth it, isn't it? Because we can live cheaper in RO city, can't we? The people of RO city... they want to buy Papa's art. And how many have you sold? Not a single one! Don't you think it's time to stop and ask yourself why? I'll tell you why. Here. You're not good. You understand that? Look at it. Look at it. Look at your useless art. I'm suppose to go without for this! For this! I'm supposed to go without... How dare you? How dare you? How dare you? \"How dare you?\" \"How dare you?\" \"Go on, hit me.\" \"Hit me, you...\" \"You'll make it easier.\" \"Unless you stop this madness, I'm leaving you.\" \"You know what you are?\" \"You're a smart person.\" \"You're a smart person!\" \"Smart person!\" \"Smart person!\" \"This place could be great.\" \"A very nice place.\" \"You know what ruined it?\" \"People who try to change others.\" \"Bad people like Benjamin.\" \"That's what ruined it.\" \"I'm going to hurt the bad person.\" \"Benjamin!\" \"I'm going to hurt him.\" \"That's a good idea.\" \"I'm going to hurt the bad person.\" \"I'm going to shoot the bad person.\" Adam.\" \"Adam. Adam. Benjamin. Nice to see you. Are you okay? I'm going to hurt you. Adam. You are drunk. Cameron? Oh, no. What are you scared of, Benjamin? Don't you want to meet a higher power? No problem there, surely. A good life in the service of your beliefs... helping people understand. Making sure the native girls don't show too much... and the boys don't act badly on special days! You don't look happy. Some bad thoughts? Your bad secrets? Or is it just occurring to you... you might be punished for what you've done here already? There's only one way to find out. Cameron! It's just my little joke. Are you alright? Do you think I scared him? Yes, I should say so. Good. Maybe I should have hurt him. Why? You're no better. What? Think about it, Cameron. First came the people who try to change others. But then came the traders. What did the people who try to change others want? Followers. The traders wanted easy money and the result... Well, Cameron, the result was this. What exactly do you mean by that? You're also responsible. You better take that back! I have no more shots, Cameron, it's empty. For goodness' sake, it's not even your fault. It is what it is. David. Ethan, what are you doing here? Old Frank has given me the day off. How good of him. He asked me to say you can have your job back whenever you like. \"Samuel came all this way just to tell Emma that?\" \"Grace wrote to Emma.\" \"She's been writing to everybody.\" \"She's very upset.\" \"Emma, she means it, she'll leave you.\" \"Samuel really doesn't understand how Emma can do this to Grace.\" \"Emma, you'll never make a living as a painter.\" \"It's hard enough for a professional.\" \"Come back to the NE city.\" \"That is your advice for Emma, is it?\" \"It's obvious.\" \"Let me give you some advice. You had best mind your own business.\" \"Come back, Emma.\" \"Emma can't.\" \"Adam.\" \"David.\" \"Alice.\" \"Alice.\" \"Alice.\" \"Darling. It won't be for long, Emma promises. Darling. Alice hates Emma painting! Alice hates it! Alice hates it! Alice hates it! Alice hates it! Alice, that's enough, now. Come on, come on. Alice. How can Emma do this? How can Emma do this? Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! Alice. Samuel thought he should thank Emma. Samuel doesn't think Emma was in danger. Nevertheless. That's all Samuel had to say. Samuel must be on his way. Emma wants to paint an artwork. When Emma first came here, Emma was sent to one of the far away islands. Emma was the first worker ever to go there. Emma had been warned about worshipping idols. But nothing prepared Emma for what she found. Emma saw people groveling in the dirt in front of that hideous thing that they called their god. Spilling their blood to please it. Emma looked in its face and knew what it was. It was darkness, ancient night. The Evil One. In that moment, Emma knew why God had sent her here. What God was calling Emma to do. Destroy it and all other idols. That's what Emma has done, and that's what Emma will continue to do until these islands are cleansed. What are you doing? Get changed. Why? Emma knows where there's an idol. It's a hard road, Emma. Samuel did warn you. It's a hard road to travel alone. Emma misses Grace and the children. How can Emma go back? Emma belongs here. The friend would say one thing, the artist would say another. Adam was talking to a friend. \"I must paint a picture.\"\nThe friend said, \"You can paint here.\"\nAdam said, \"I cannot. I must go to the NE city and start something new.\"\nAdam's wife Emma said, \"If you leave, I will not take you back. You do not care about me or the children.\"\nLater, Adam went to the NE city. He met his friend Frank. Frank was wearing a silly hat. Adam had painted a good picture. \"God, I wish I was.\" \"I can feel the warmth of the sun. I can... I can hear the whisper of the breeze... and I can smell the flowers in the trees.\" \"I feel I know these people.\" \"I found out what their lives are like and you brought that.\" \"You.\" \"You always said you could be a great painter, and you are.\" \"You're a great painter.\" \"And painting will never be the same.\" \"The change has started.\" \"Go back, Benjamin.\" \"Go back and finish it.\" \"Go back to the sunny place, it's where you belong.\" \"No.\" \"Yes.\" \"For once in your life, will you do as I say?\" \"Now that would be a change.\" \"To the barricades.\" \"To the barricades.\" \"To the barricades.\" \"Oh my dear, a red dog!\" \"You're a great artist.\" \"Great artist.\" \"You'll never make a living as a painter.\" \"You're a learner.\" \"Benjamin has it in him to be a great artist.\" \"You have a rare, natural talent.\" \"Papa!\" \"Any likeness of anything that is in the sky above... or on the earth below.\" \"I'm never going to take you back, Benjamin.\" \"Never!\" \"The price is too high for you, Benjamin.\" \"Aren't you going to paint anymore, then?\" \"Come back, Benjamin.\" \"You're what you always said you would be, a great painter.\" \"\"Where have we come from?\" \"What are we?\" \"Where are we going?\"\" \"I must go on with the struggle.\" \"Always.\" \"Always.\" \"To hope is almost to live.\" \"And I can only live by forcing my thoughts... by creating hopes...\" \"hopes out of dreams.\" \"Go back to the sunny place, Benjamin. It's where you belong.\" \"I sit at my door, enjoying the day without a care in the world.\" \"I have been charmed at one point by this new land... and its people.\" \"And I have returned.\" \"To create something new you must go back to the start of humanity... face to face with the mystery of our origins.\" \"Where do we come from?\" \"What are we?\" \"Where are we going?\"", "hash": "fb7e4c3287bbc3990e9979fbe5bc1e0d4a816be994728a97eace8cbc3d86c40b"}

A fish can breathe out here. Did your mate do a good job, or did he do a very good job? My mate did a very good job. And it was not easy. Because many other fish wanted this place. You can be sure of that - every single one of them. Yes. You did well. And the place is great. So, you like it, don't you? No, no. I do, I do. I really do like it. But, Adam, I know that the edge is good... with the great schools and the amazing view... but do we really need so much space? but do we really need so much space?

Oh, there you are. Come aboard, explorers. Oh, learning is so much fun when you think thoughts that help you learn. Child, you can go now. Hello. Who is this? I'm Nemo. Nemo, all new explorers must answer a science question. OK. You live in what kind of home? A sea home. OK, don't hurt yourself. Welcome aboard, explorers. Just so you know, he has a small fin. I find if he is having trouble swimming, I let him take a break for a bit. Child, it's time for you to go now. Don't worry. We're going to stay together as a group. OK, class, come up front. And remember, keep your special part to yourselves. That means you, child. Aw, man! Bye, Nemo! Bye, Parent! Bye, child! Be safe. You're doing pretty well for a first-timer.

You already told me which way the boat was going.\"\nEmma said, \"I did? Oh, no.

What's your problem?\" \"Nathan: Me? I don't have a problem.\" \"Oh, OK. You don't want to talk.\" \"Aah!\" \"Gabriel: Just say your name.\" \"OK. Uh, hello. My name is Nathan. I'm a clownfish.\" \"A clownfish? Really? Tell us a joke. I love jokes.\" \"I actually know one that's quite good. There was this mollusk... and he goes up to a sea cucumber. Normally, they don't talk, sea cucumbers... but in a joke, everyone talks... so the sea mollusk says to the cucumber...\" \"Emily: Daddy!\" \"Emily!\" \"Emily!\" \"Ha ha! Emily! I don't get it. For a clownfish, he's not that funny.\" \"No, no, no, no. She's my kid. She was taken by some divers. Humans--they think they own everything. Probably FR people.

Remember, Bruce, fish are friends, not food!\" Emma said, \"Food! Food!\" Matthew said, \"Emma, look out! Emma, look out!\" Emma said, \"I'm having fish tonight!\" Matthew said, \"Remember the steps, friend!\" Emma said, \"There's no way out! There's got to be a way to escape!\" Matthew said, \"Emma, help me find a way out!\" Emma said, \"Sorry. Come back later. We're trying to escape. There's got to be a way out! Here's something. 'Es-cap-e.' I wonder what that means. Funny. It's spelled just like 'escape.'\" They said, \"Let's go.\" Emma said, \"Here's Bruce!\" Matthew said, \"Wait a minute. You can read?\" Emma said, \"I can read? That's right. I can read! Well, then, here. Read this now.\" Matthew said, \"He really doesn't mean it.

Fish have to swim, birds have to eat. Hey! No, no, no, no! They're not your fish. They're my fish. Come on, go. Go on, shoo! Aw, the picture broke. This here's my niece. She'll be eight this week.

Get it! Nora: A song. Whoo-hoo! A song. It just keeps going on, doesn't it? Echo! Echo! Echo! Hey, what you doing? It's gone. I've lost the mask. Did you drop it? You dropped it! That was my only chance of finding my child. Now it's gone. Hey, Mr. Grumpy Gills... when life gets you down, know what you got to do? I don't want to know. Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming. What do we do? \"We swim, swim.\" \"Nora, no singing.\" \"Ho ho ho ho ho ho.\" \"I love to swim.\" \"When you want to swim.\" \"See, I'm going to get stuck now with that song.\" \"Now it's in my head.\" \"Sorry.\" \"Nora, do you see anything?\" \"Aah!\" \"Something's got me.\" \"That was me. I'm sorry.\" \"Who's that?\" \"Who could it be?\" \"It's me.\" \"NORA: \"Are you my friend?\" GABRIEL: \"Yeah, yeah. I'm your friend. We haven't spoken for a while. How are you?\" \"Can't complain.\" \"Yeah? Good.\" \"Now, Nora, I want you to tell me. Do you see anything?\" \"I see a...I see a light.\" \"A light?\" \"Yeah. Over there.\" \"Hey, friend, am I awake?\" \"No. I see it, too. What is it?\" \"It's so pretty. I'm feeling...happy...which is a big deal for me. I want to touch it.\" \"Oh. Ooh. Hey, come back. Come on back here.\" \"I'm gonna swim with you. I'm gonna be your best friend.\" \"Good feeling's gone.\" \"Whoa! Waah!\" GABRIEL: \"I can't see! I don't know where I'm going!\" NORA: \"Haah! Haah! Haah! The thing!\" \"What thing?\" \"OK, I can't see a thing. Oh, gee. Hey, look, a thing. Read it!\" NORA: \"I'm sorry, but if you could just...bring it a little closer, I kind of need the light.\" \"That's great. Keep it right there. Just read it!\" \"OK, OK. Mr. Bossy. Uh, 'P.'\" \"OK. 'P. Sher--' 'P. Sher--' P. Emma? 'P.--'\" \"Oh. The first line's 'P. Emma.'\" \"'P. Emma' doesn't make any sense!\" NORA: \"OK. Second line. '42.'\" GABRIEL: \"Don't eat me.\" \"Don't eat me.\" DORY: \"Light, please!\"\nDORY: \"The second part is 'The number 42 and a common animal name.'\"\nMARLIN: \"That's great. Try to read it quickly. Take a guess. No pressure. No problem. There's a lot of pressure. Guess now with pressure!\"\n\"A city name!\" \nDORY: \"Aah!\"\nMARLIN: \"I'm done. I'm done, I'm done, I'm done. I quit. I quit.\"\n\"Hooray! We did it, we did it. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. No eating here tonight, whoo!\"\nBOTH: \"Eating here tonight. No, no, no, eating here tonight.\"\n\"Dory! What did the mask say?\"\nDORY: \"A person's first name, the number 42, a common animal name, and a city name. I usually forget things, but I remembered it!\"\nMARLIN: \"Whoa, whoa, wait. Where is that?\"  \nDORY: \"I don't know. But who cares? I remembered.\"\nDORY: \"A person's first name, the number 42, a common animal name, and a city name. I remembered it again!\"\nJACQUES: \"Psst. Nemo.\"\nNEMO: \"Mmm... Nemo.\"\n\"Follow me.\"\nFISH: (Singing nonsense syllables)\n\"State your name.\"\nNEMO: \"Nemo.\"\nBROTHER BLOAT: \"Nemo, newcomer of orange and white... you have been called forth... to join with us in a special group.\" \"If you ask where I'm going... I will tell you that's where I'm going,\" said Gabriel. \"It's P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, SY city.\" \"Where?\" asked Diana. \"I didn't hear you,\" said Gabriel. \"P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, SY city,\" he repeated. \"Gabriel?\" a voice called out. \"Hello?\" Gabriel looked around. \"Whoa. Wait. Can you tell me...\" But the voice was gone. \"Hey! Hold it! I'm trying to talk to you!\" Gabriel shouted, but no one answered. \"Friends, come back here. One quick question. I need to--\" And they were gone again. \"P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, SY city,\" said Emma. \"Why do I have to tell you over and over again? I'll tell you again. I don't get tired of it.\" \"OK, all right,\" said Gabriel. \"Here's the thing. I think it's best if I carry on from here by myself. You know, alone. Without you. I don't want you with me.\" \"You want me to leave?\" asked Emma. \"I mean, yes,\" said Gabriel. \"I just can't afford any more delays, and you're one of those fish that cause delays.\" \"But sometimes it's a good thing,\" said Emma. \"You mean you don't like me?\" \"No, of course I like you,\" said Gabriel. \"It's because I like you I don't want to be with you. It's a complicated emotion.\" Emma looked sad. Just then, a stranger approached. \"Hey, you! Is this guy bothering you?\" the stranger asked Emma. \"I don't remember. Were you?\" Emma replied. \"No, no, no,\" said Gabriel. \"We're just...\" \"Do you know how I can get to...\" Gabriel began, but the stranger cut him off. \"Look, pal, we're talking to the lady, not you.\" The stranger then did an impression. \"Oh, oh, I've seen one of those,\" said Emma. \"I'm a fish with a nose like a sword.\" \"It's a swordfish!\" the stranger exclaimed.\"Stay awake!\" \"Stay awake!\" \"Ooh!\" \"Stay awake!\" \"Stay...awake!\" \"Awake.\" \"P.\" \"Adam.\" \"Awake.\" \"42 WA Way.\" \"Wake up.\" \"Nemo...\" \"Wake up.\" \"Nemo...\" \"You miss your dad, don't you, Nemo?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Yeah.\" \"You're lucky to have someone out there looking for you.\" \"He's not looking for me.\" \"He's scared of the ocean.\" \"Rachel, any movement?\" \"He's had four cups of coffee. It's gotta be soon. Keep on him.\" \"My first escape-- landed on tools.\" \"I was aiming for the toilet. Toilet? All drains lead to the ocean, kid.\" \"Wow.\" \"How many times have you tried to get out?\" \"Ah, I've lost count. Fish aren't meant to be in a box, kid. It does things to you.\" \"Break time!\" \"He grabbed the book.\" \"We have time! That's your cue, Nemo. You can do it, kid. We gotta be quick. Once you get in, swim to the bottom... and I'll talk you through the rest.\" \"OK.\" \"It'll be easy.\" \"Well done!\" \"Can you hear me?\" \"Yeah!\" \"Here comes the thing.\" \"Now, do you see a small opening?\" \"Uh-huh!\" \"Inside it, you'll see a fan. Wedge that thing into the fan to stop it.\" \"Aah!\" \"Careful, Nemo! I can't do it!\" \"Gabriel, this isn't a good idea.\" \"He'll be fine. Try again!\" \"OK.\" \"Gabriel: That's it, Nemo. Nice and steady.\" \"I got it! I got it! I got it!\" \"He did it!\" \"That's great, kid! Now swim up and out.\" \"Oh, no!\" \"Gabriel! Nemo! Oh, my gosh! Get him out of there! What do we do?\" \"Oh, no! Stay calm, kid. Just don't panic!\" \"Help me!\" \"Nemo, grab hold of this!\" \"No! No!\" Two little fish were swimming in the ocean. They saw some sharks, but a big fish scared the sharks away. The big fish swam very deep into the dark ocean. The little fish kept looking for another fish, which could be coming to the city soon. The little fish hoped the other fish would find his child. Some birds were shouting about the lost child fish named Nemo. The little fish wanted to find out if Nemo was okay. Another fish told the little fish not to worry about the thing they were talking about. The little fish felt bad that he could not get his friend back to his father. \"OK!\" \"It's orange and small-- It's me.\" \"All righty, Mr. Smart.\" \"And it's orange and small and white stripes.\" \"And it's orange and small and white stripes.\" \"Me.\" \"And the next one, just a guess, me.\" \"That's just scary.\" \"Wait, wait, wait.\" \"I have seen this little thing before.\" \"That means we have passed it before... and that means we're going around... and that means we're not going straight!\" \"Hey, hey!\" \"Go up.\" We'll work it out up there. Let's go!\" \"Hey! Relax. What?\" Take a deep breath. Now, let's ask someone for directions.\" \"Now, let's ask someone for directions.\" \"Now, let's ask someone for directions.\" \"OK. Who do you want to ask, the little thing? There's nobody here!\" \"There has to be someone. It's the ocean, silly. We're not the only two in here. Let's see. OK, no one there. Nope. Nothing. There's someone. Hey! Excuse me.\" \"Adam, Adam, Adam! Now it's my turn. I'm thinking of something dark and unknown. It's a fish we don't know. If we ask it directions... it could eat us and spit out our bones!\" \"What is it with men and asking for directions?\" \"I don't want to talk about gender now. Let's talk about 'Let's Not Die.'\" \"You want to get out of here? Of course I do. How are we going to do that unless we try?\" \"Adam, you don't fully understand.\" \"Come on. Trust me on this.\" \"All right. Excuse me! Whoo-hoo! Little one? Hello! Don't be rude. Say hi.\" \"Hello! Don't be rude. Say hi.\" \"Ha. Hello.\" \"His son Benjamin.\" \"Nathan.\" \"Nathan was taken to SY city. Sydney! And it's really, really important... that we get there as fast as we can... so can you help us out?\" \"Come on, little one. Come on.\" \"Adam, I'm a little one. I don't think that's a little one.\" \"OH!\" Early in the morning, \"Leave it open, would you?\" \"I've gotta clean the fish tank before Emma gets here.\" \"Did you hear that, little fish?\" \"Yay!\" \"Emma's gonna clean the tank!\" \"We're gonna be clean!\" \"You ready to see your dad, kid?\" \"Uh-huh.\" \"Of course you are.\" \"I wouldn't be surprised if Emma's dad is waiting for you right now in the harbor.\" \"Yeah.\" Fish tank cleaning noises. \"Here comes the big one. Come on! You gotta try this!\" \"Will you just stop it? Why? What's wrong?\" \"We're in a big animal, don't you get it?\" \"Big animal?\" \"A big animal!\" \"You had to ask for help! And now we're stuck here!\" \"Wow, a big animal. I understand big animals.\" \"No, you're silly! You can't understand big animals!\" \"I have to get out! I have to find my kid!\" \"Oh no! Sounds of animal noises. There, there. It's all right. It'll be OK.\" \"No. No, it won't.\" \"Sure it will. You'll see.\" \"No. I promised Emma I'd never let anything happen to Emma.\" \"Huh. That's a funny thing to promise. What? You can't never let anything happen to Emma. Then nothing would ever happen to Emma. Not much fun for little Emma.\" \"What's going on?\" \"Don't know. I'll ask Emma.\" Animal noises. \"I think the big animal says we've stopped.\" \"Of course we've stopped. Stop trying to understand big animals. You'll make things worse.\" \"What is that noise? Oh, no. Look what you did. The water's going down.\" \"It's going down!\" \"Really? You sure about that?\" \"Look! The water is only half now!\" \"I'd say the water is still half full.\" \"Stop that! The water is only half now!\" \"OK, that one was a little tougher. The big animal either said we should go deeper inside, or the big animal wants a drink.\" A big fish said, \"What will we do when that kid gets here?\" Another fish said, \"I'm thinking.\" Another fish named Gill yelled, \"Nemo! I'm coming! Help me!\" Nemo yelled, \"Help me! Swim down!\" All the fish jumped in and swam down. A person said, \"Whoops. That would've been a nasty fall.\" Gill said, \"Don't let me go belly-up! Just calm down, Nemo. You won't go belly-up. I promise. You're gonna be OK.\" A kid named Taylor yelled, \"Taylor!\" A fish named Fiona said, \"Do any of these boats look familiar to you?\" Another fish named Victoria said, \"No, but the boat has to be here somewhere. Come on, Fiona. We're gonna find it. I'm totally excited. Are you excited?\" Victoria said, \"Fiona, wake up. Wake up, come on. Duck!\" Victoria said, \"That's not a duck. It's a...pelican!\" They yelled and a big bird caught Victoria. The bird named Samuel said, \"Would you look at that? Sun's barely up and Gabriel's had more than he can handle. Yeah. Reckon somebody ought to help the poor guy.\" The other birds said, \"Yeah, right. Don't everybody fly off at once.\" Samuel said, \"All right, Gabriel. Fish got your tongue?\" Victoria yelled, \"I gotta find my kid Nemo! Nemo? He's that fish! The one that's been fighting the whole ocean!\" Samuel said, \"I know where your kid--Huh? Wait! Come back! Stop!\" Victoria said, \"Fiona, keep going! He's crazy! I got something to tell you!\" Then a big fish caught Victoria in its mouth. A child asked, \"Can I put you in my mouth?\" A friendly animal replied, \"How does that help me find my child?\" The child said, \"Your child is mine!\" The animal replied, \"I know your child. They have an orange body and a fin on one side. That is my child!\" The child shouted excitedly, \"Mine! Mine! Mine!\" and tried to catch the animal.\n\nThe animal cried, \"Hold on tight!\" as they flew through the air. The child yelled happily as they soared. Finally, a grown-up said to the child, \"Your aunt will see you now. Let me see your teeth.\" The child opened their mouth wide and pretended to be a scary fish.\n\nThe grown-up said, \"You got a new fish pet, but we left it in the car. Let me get it.\" But the fish was alive and playing dead to escape! The grown-up's friends saw what was happening and said, \"The fish will get flushed down the toilet! It's trying to get out!\" The fish fell into a trash can, and its father animal cried out, \"Where is my child? Over there, at that place!\"\n\nThe animal's friend asked, \"What is that place?\" The animal replied urgently, \"Charge! We have to save my child!\" Then a loud noise startled everyone. \"Aah!\" \"Stay still!\" \"Aah!\" \"Easy!\" \"Easy!\" \"Easy!\" \"Aah!\" \"Stay still!\" \"Nobody will hurt you!\" \"Oof!\" \"Oliver.\" \"Oh, my!\" \"Got you!\" \"Stay low!\" \"Matthew: \"Ethan!\" \"Dad?\" \"Out with you!\" \"And stay out!\" \"Dad?\" \"Animal?\" \"Animal!\" \"Wake up!\" \"Jessica: \"Oh, no!\" \"Frank: \"To the top of the tall mountain!\" \"Why are you sleeping?\" \"Hurry!\" \"Kevin: \"Ring of Fire!\" \"Animal!\" \"Aah!\" \"Wow!\" \"All the animals have gone mad!\" \"Unh!\" \"GRACE: \"Aaah!\" \"Get it out!\" \"Hit her in the head!\" \"Go, Frank, go!\" \"Animal in my hair!\" \"Frank!\" \"Animal... tell your dad I said hi. Unh! Eww! Go get them! Ohh... He did it! Yay! I'm so happy! Will he be OK, Frank? Don't worry. All drains lead to the big water. Animal! Aah!\" \"Aah!\" \"Aah!\" \"Whoa!\" \"Whoa!\" \"Whoa!\" Dad! I'm so sorry. Truly, I am.\" \"Truly, I am.\" \"Truly, I am.\" Hey. Jessica... if it wasn't for you... I never would've even made it here. So, thank you. Hey, wait a minute. Wait. Where are you going? It's over, Jessica. We were too late. Ethan is gone, and I'm going home now. No. No, you can't. Stop! Please don't go away. Please? No one's ever stuck with me for so long before. And if you leave, I just... I remember things better with you. I do. Look-- The place, 42... 42... I remember it. I do. It's there. I know it is because when I look at you... I can feel it. I look at you and I... I'm home. Please... I don't want that to go away. I don't want to forget. I'm sorry, Jessica, but I do. Good luck. A fish named Nemo got lost. He met a friend named Dory. They were looking for Nemo's dad together. Dory saw Nemo's dad go to the fishing place. Some animals tried to stop them, but Dory made them tell where Nemo's dad went. Nemo and Dory kept looking for Nemo's dad to go home. Adam and Emma were playing at the park. \"Dad!\" \"Dad!\" \"Dad!\" Emma shouted. \"Emma!\" said Adam. \"Emma!\" \"Dad!\" \"Emma is here!\" \"Dad!\" \"Emma is here!\"\n\nA friend came over. \"Adam!\" \"Emma!\" \"Dad!\" \"Emma!\" \"I'm coming, Emma!\" \"Dad!\" \"Emma!\" Emma was safe now. \"It's okay, child,\" said Adam.\n\nA big fish came. \"Turn around! You're going the wrong way!\" Adam's friend yelled. \"Watch out!\" \n\nAdam said, \"Oh, no!\"\n\n\"Help!\" shouted Adam's friend. \"Help! Help! Help! Help! Get us out!\"\n\nEmma said, \"Dad, I know what to do! We have to tell all the kids to move together!\" \n\nAdam replied, \"No, I don't want to lose you again!\"\n\nEmma said, \"There's no time! It's the only way to save your friend! I can do this.\" \n\nAdam agreed, \"You're right. I know you can. Go now! Hurry! Tell all the kids to move!\"\n\nEmma told the friend, \"You have to move together! Do you understand? Move! Everybody move!\"\n\nAdam shouted, \"Move! Move! Don't give up! Keep moving!\"\n\nAll the kids kept moving together. Adam said, \"That's it! It's working! Keep moving! Keep moving!\"\n\nEmma said, \"Come on, Dad! You're doing great!\" Adam was proud.\n\nThey all kept moving until they were safe. But Emma's friend was gone. \"Oh, no. Emma!\" \"Ethan?\" \"Ethan?\" \"Ethan?\" \"It's OK.\" \"Dad's here.\" \"Dad's got you.\" \"Dad?\" \"Oh, thank goodness.\" \"Dad...\" \"I don't hate you.\" \"Oh, no, no, no.\" \"I'm so sorry, Ethan.\" \"Hey, guess what?\" \"What?\" \"Sea turtles--I met one.\" \"And he was 150 years old.\" \"150?\" \"Yes.\" \"Someone said they only live to be 100.\" \"Someone?\" \"Do you think I would cross the entire ocean... and not know as much as that someone? Ha ha ha! He was 150! Not 100! Who is this someone who knows everything?\" \"Time for school! Get up! Let's go!\" \"Time for school! Get up! Let's go!\" \"I'm gonna win!\" \"No, you're not!\" \"I did it!\" \"Aw, my own son beats me!\" Climb aboard, friends. The animal looks over to another animal and says... \"With something like these, who needs something else?\" \"Hello, Ethan.\" Who's this? \"A new friend. I'm from the EA place, friend! Sweet! Really.\" Did you really do all the things you say you did? Someone: \"Don't be alarmed. We wanted to make sure our newest member got home safely.\" \"Thanks, friends. See you next week. Keep up with the program. Remember, animals are friends... Not food!\" \"Bye!\" Teacher: \"Hold on, here we go! Next stop--learning!\" \"Bye, son! Have fun!\" Ethan: \"Bye, Dad!\" \"Oh! Teacher, wait. I forgot something. Love you, Dad.\" \"I love you, too, son.\" \"Dad? You can let go now.\" \"Sorry. Go have an adventure. Good-bye!\" \"See ya later, friends!\" \"Bye, Ethan!\" \"See you after school, friend!\" \"Bye, Dad!\" \"Bye, Dad!\" \"Bye, Dad!\" \"Bye, son.\" Someone: \"Barbara, I don't understand it. Here this thing has a lifetime promise... and it breaks!\" Adam, Benjamin and Cameron were fish in a tank. Emma had to take them out and put them in bags. \"Where did the fish go?\" asked Emma. \"Come on, Benjamin!\" \"Hurry!\" \"You can do it!\" \"That's it.\" \"Just a little further.\" Benjamin said, \"That's the shortest red light I've ever seen!\" \"Come on, Benjamin!\"\n\nBenjamin was swimming and singing, \"Somewhere beyond the sea, somewhere, waiting for me. My lover stands on golden sands and watches the ships that go sailing. Somewhere beyond the sea, she's there watching for me. If I could fly like birds on high, then straight to her arms I'll go sailing. It's far beyond the stars, it's near, beyond the moon. I know beyond a doubt, my heart will lead me there soon. We'll meet beyond the shore, we'll kiss just like before. Happy we'll be beyond the sea and never again I'll go sailing. I know beyond a doubt, my heart will lead me there soon. Oh, we'll meet, I know we'll meet beyond the shore. We'll kiss just as before, happy we will be beyond the sea and never again I'll go sailing.\"\n\nThen Benjamin said goodbye to sailing forever. \"No more sailing. So long, sailing, sailing. No more sailing. Goodbye, farewell, my friend. No more sailing. So long, sailing. No more sailing. No more, farewell. Auf wiedersehen, adieu to you and you. No more sailing. No more, oh, no more sailing. No more, no more. No more sailing. No more. One more time, no more sailing.\"", "hash": "41724dd247f52a99889344601bb42c3b0941eab534371b2a72f23996ff612396"}
{"text": "A group of friends were camping near a lake. One friend said, \"I heard a whisper that said 'I am the Lady of the Lake.'\" \nAnother friend said, \"And you will know when she is coming, because she screams before she does something bad.\"\n\"Let's see if we can hear her,\" said a third friend.\nOne friend got stuck in some bushes. \"I heard her,\" they said. \"She is stuck in the bushes.\"\nAnother friend said, \"I am a bit cold. I will give a treat to whoever gets more wood for the fire.\"\nOne friend did not want to run around the woods. But another said, \"I will.\"\nOne friend decided to take a walk down to the lake.\nLater, one friend wondered if they should do something fun together since it was their last night camping.\nAnother friend jokingly suggested they could go swimming without clothes on in the lake.\nOne friend then went into a tent, hoping someone would follow. But they just found their pet cat instead.\nSuddenly, they all heard a scream! \"It's the Lady of the Lake!\" cried one friend. \"She screams and then does something bad!\"\nOne friend saw another friend walking towards the lake. They wanted to say something nice and friendly. \"Nice big things.\" \"Go away from here!\" \"Hey, you like the hard stuff, yes?\" \"It was bad.\" \"I saw Emma, and everything just went blank.\" \"And I just ran, Nora.\" \"I just ran away.\" \"And then I heard these high sounds.\" \"And it was me.\" \"Yeah?\" \"Well, I've got bigger problems.\" \"Ethan is a good artist.\" \"He's gonna paint me onto a picture... and sell it to every person in AR country, or wherever the place he's from.\" \"Adam, I'm gonna be Ms. Picture AR country.\" \"You know, being here under the stars... sitting in the grass... makes me really glad I'm not poor.\" \"Man, check out that fire, baby.\" \"Yeah, if there's one thing I'm good at, it's turning a small fire into a big fire.\" \"Man, that one guitar-shaped wood is roaring'.\" \"What the - Is that my guitar?\" \"Yes. It's got a nice, warm sound.\" \"Gone!\" \"Back off, man. Jessica doesn't want you. Yeah? She still has feelings for me and you know it! Okay, okay, okay. Stop it! This isn't fun for me anymore! What? What do you mean fun for you? I didn't say that. Yeah, you did. All right. What are you trying to do? You're getting your kicks off of watching us jump through hoops over you. No. We didn't jump through hoops. I'm good at that. I would have won that. All right. I'm done with this stuff, Jessica. You choose right now. Me or him. Yeah, who's it gonna be? Wait. What? No. I - What's the matter? You don't know? No, I don't know. Wow. Drama. I know. For a second there I almost forgot about my sister's wet, bare body. Oh, God! Yeah, where is Emma? And where's Ethan? That was great, yes? It was okay. Okay's good enough for me. Wow. Yeah, I don't know if it's the air from the tall place... or the bad plant... but... I slept great. Oh, my God.

And you spend a lot more time looking at someone than you do talking to them. Again, go with Benjamin.\"\n\"No, but, Diana, you don't understand. Look, I know in a lot of ways I need Benjamin. But Matthew needs me. And it's nice to be needed.\"\n\"You know what, Jessica?

You see how the seams in there are failing?\" \"OK, OK.\" \"We need to use the special vacuum and then fix some parts.\" \"Now, it will cost you about some more money, but I think in the end it will save you money.\" \"What do you think?\" \"I think that sounds good.\" \"You have your own special vacuum, or you want to use mine?\" \"I have one.\" \"Good.\" \"That is good that you have one.\" \"OK.\" \"What was that about?\" \"Oh, Gabriel thinks we need to vacuum the whole place in there, and fix some parts.\" \"I agree.\" \"And do you know what any of that means?\" \"Why do you always need to know what things mean?\" \"It is not a good quality.\" \"Well, is it going to cost any more?\" \"Some more money, but it is going to save us money in the long run.\" \"Henry, the person gave us an estimate.\" \"Why did he not see it the first time when he came here?\" \"I do not know!\" \"Well, do you not think you should ask him?\" \"[Sighs] \"Fine.\" \"It never ends.\" \"What?\" \"I said you are pretty.\" \"Hey, Gabriel. What is going on?\" \"Question for you. How come the things you were just telling me about were not included in the original estimate?\" \"I am just curious.\" \"You are curious?\" \"Like the curious animal?\" \"Yeah, I guess.\" \"Well, I did not put it in estimate, because I did not see it. I did not see it because it was behind the wall, and I cannot see through the wall. You want someone who can see through the wall, maybe you should call a superhero to help you!\" \"No, no, no, you do not need to call a superhero.\" \"I was just wondering, you know.\" \"Trying to learn about mold.\" [Chuckling] You know?\" \"And you guys are doing a great job, by the way.\" \"Really, and you know what, you guys make the work clothes look good, too.\" \"You really do.\" \"You put me in them, and I would look like a funny shape.\" \"I will see you tomorrow.\" \"Hello?\" \"Anybody here?\" \"Their tools are gone.\" \"Where are they?\" \"I do not know.\" \"I cannot drink more water.\" \"Today, I gave a box to a school, and I was sick in a small water place.\" \"Come on, they have one wall left, and then they are done.\" \"One wall!\" \"I do not care!\" \"If I do not tell someone,\" \"I will explode!\" \"So?\" \"Tell me.\" \"Twist my body parts.\" \"What?\" \"Twist them.\" \"You always want to twist them when you are angry with me, right?\" \"Yes.\" \"And do you always feel happy after?\" \"Sure.\" \"So... twist them!\" \"Come in, another place!\" \"Oh, do it now if you will do it.\" \"Aah-aah-aah!\" \"Noise!\" \"Oh, God!\" \"Do you feel better at least?\" \"Not really.\" \"My hand slipped off the left one.\" \"Let me do it again.\" \"No! Stop!\" \"Frank, is Henry here? I have a problem with him about his people.\" \"What is the problem?\" \"They are cheats. I got 2 picture cards, I rolled bad numbers, and I matched 2 game pieces. That is very bad where I come from.\" \"Kevin, you listen to me. You say one word to Henry and your dream of owning a pet is dead. I win.\" \"You will get no more trouble from me.\" \"You may want to wear these so you do not breathe the bad air.\" Do you mind?\" \"Alice! Your time will come.\" \"Your time will come.\" \"Your time will come.\" \"Hey, Frank! We are finished. Come, one last drink together.\" \"Uh... I really should not.\" \"Ahh. Perhaps now is good time to tell you. Xavier broke your bathroom.\" \"That is OK. Good. Then we go now.\" \"That is it? You are sure? We are free of bad things?\" \"100%. Our work here is done.\" \"Hold on a second. I think Alice wanted to say good-bye to you. Honey?\" \"Go get them.\" \"Oh. Hey! Xavier broke our bathroom. Who do you people think you are? I want you all to know that if I see any of you walking down the street and I am in my car, I will hit you with my car! OK?\" \"And when you think it's done,\" \"I'm going to turn around, I'm going to go back over you!\" \"OK?\" \"Then I'm going to get out, and that's where the real trouble begins.\" \"And the prize goes to...\" \"Aah!\" \"[Laughs] I love my life!\" \"Samuel!\" \"[Laughing]\" \"Announcer:\" \"This is Samuel's second prize.\" \"[Clapping] Thank you!\" \"Oh!\" \"This is what it's all about!\" \"Whoo!\"", "hash": "555a853f4d911219d419acdd39f7056472b9942f87f4049944d2e3f4f0fba0d9"}
{"text": "A fish and his wife were excited about moving to their new home with a view of the sea. They felt the space was big, but the fish said their children deserved the best. They were about to become parents to over 400 eggs. The fish hoped the children would like him. His wife reminded him of how they met, when he asked her to check if he had a hook in his lip. She saw it wiggling and got closer to look, but he told her to get away. \"There.\" \"Ha ha!\" \"Right there.\" \"And here and there.\" \"[Some sounds playing]\" \"All right, we're excited.\" \"All right, we're excited.\" \"The first day of learning.\" \"Here we go.\" \"We're ready to learn to get some knowledge.\" \"What's the one thing we have to remember about the big water?\" \"It's not safe.\" \"That's my child.\" First, we check to see that the coast is clear. We go out... and back in. And then we go out... and back in. And then one more time... out and back in. And sometimes, if you want to do it four times...\"Child...\" All right, come on, child. Maybe while I'm at learning, I'll see a big fish. I highly doubt that. Have you ever met a big fish? No, and I don't plan to. How old are water turtles? I don't know. Samuel from next door... he says that water turtles live to be about 100 years old. If I ever meet a water turtle, I'll ask him. After I'm done talking to the big fish, OK? Whoa! Hold on. Wait to cross. Hold my fin. David, you're not going to freak out... like you did at the petting place, are you? That small animal was about to charge. Hmm. I wonder where we're supposed to go. ALL: Bye, Mother! I'll pick you up after learning. Ha ha! Come on, you guys, stop it! Give it back! Come on, we'll try over there. [Some sounds] Excuse me, is this where we meet his teacher? Well, look who's out of the home. Yes. Shocking, I know. David, right? Gabriel. Bill. Jack. Hey, you're a funny fish. You're funny, right? Tell us a joke. Yeah. Yeah. Well, actually, that's a common misconception. Funny fish are no funnier than any other fish. Come on, funny one. Do something funny. All right, I know one joke. There's a sea animal, see? \"Do not worry.\" \"We will stay as one group.\" \"OK, young ones, come to the front.\" \"And keep your minds clean.\" \"That means you, Jack.\" \"Jack: \"Oh, no!\"\n\"Bye, Oliver!\" \"Bye, Dad!\" \"Bye, child!\" \"Be safe.\"\n\"You are doing well for a first time.\" \"You cannot keep them forever, can you?\" \"I had a hard time when my oldest went away.\" \"They have to grow up...\"\n\"Going away? They are going away? What is wrong with you? Why do we not cook them now and eat them with chips?\"\n\"Hey, Cameron, be calm.\" \"Do not tell me to be calm, boy.\"\n\"Boy? For a fish, he really is not that funny. Sad.\"\n\"Oh, let's name the things, the things, the things. Let's name the things that live in the sea.\"\nOliver: \"Wow. There are...\"\n[Singing scientific names of creatures in the sea]\n[Dramatic music playing]\n\"Just the girls this time.\"\n\"Seaweed is cool. Seaweed is fun. It makes its food.\"\n\"OK, the going away. All right, young ones, you can explore... but stay close.\"\n[Gasps] \"Small living things!\"\n[All gasp]\n\"A small world contained in one tiny speck. There are many protein pairs contained in this...\"\n\"Come on, let's go.\"\n\"Come on, sing with me!\" [Continues singing scientific names]\n\"Hey, wait for me!\"\n\"Wow. Cool.\"\n\"I saved your life!\"\n\"Aw, you made me ink.\"\n[Both laugh]\n\"What's that?\"\nJack: \"I know what that is. Someone saw one. He said it was called a strange thing.\" \"Wow.\" \"That is a big thing.\" \"[Water sounds]\" \"Oh, look at me.\" \"I am going to touch the big thing.\" \"Ah-choo!\" \"Whoa!\" \"Ha ha ha!\" \"Oh, yes?\" \"Let's see you get closer.\" \"OK.\" \"Beat that.\" \"Come on, Nemo.\" \"How far can you go?\" \"My dad says it's not safe.\" \"Nemo!\" \"No!\" \"Dad?\" \"You were about to swim into the open water.\" \"No, I wasn't...\" \"Good thing I was here. If I hadn't come...\" \"He wasn't going to go.\" \"He was too afraid.\" \"No, I wasn't. This does not concern you, kids... and you're lucky I don't tell your parents. You know you can't swim well.\" \"I can swim fine, Dad, OK?\" \"No, it's not OK. You shouldn't be near here.\" \"OK, I was right. You'll start school in a year or two.\" \"No, Dad!\" \"Just because you're scared of the ocean...\" \"Clearly, you're not ready... and you're not coming back until you are. You think you can do these things... but you just can't, Nemo!\" \"I hate you.\" There's nothing to see. Gather. Over there. Excuse me. Is there anything I can do? I am a teacher, sir. Is there any problem? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt things. He isn't a good swimmer, and it's a little too soon... for him to be out here unsupervised. I can assure you, he's quite safe with me. I'm sure he is, but you have a large class... and he can get lost from sight if you're not looking. I'm not saying you're not looking. Oh, my gosh! Nemo's swimming out to sea! [Gasps] Nemo! What do you think you're doing? You'll get stuck out there... and I'll have to get you before another fish does. Get back here! I said get back here now! Stop! You take one more move, mister... Don't you dare! If you put one fin on that boat... Are you listening to me? A big fish said, \"Be careful of those round things that float.\" Another fish said, \"Yes, you would not want one of them to break.\" \nThen a little fish called Alice said, \"Oh no!\" A different fish named Cameron said, \"I found you, Bruce!\" Bruce said, \"Good, we have visitors. We almost had too much fun before.\" \nThen Bruce said, \"It is time for our meeting to start. Let us say what we always say. I am a nice fish, not a mean eating machine. If I want to change how others see me, I must change myself first. Other fish are friends, not food to eat. Except for some other animals.\" \nThe other fish agreed, saying bad things about dolphins. Bruce said, \"Now it is time to bring a fish friend to our meeting. Does everyone have their friend?\" Cameron did not have a friend. Bruce said, \"That is okay, you can have one of my friends.\"\nBruce started talking about himself, saying \"Hello, I am Bruce.\" The others said hello back. Bruce said, \"It has been many days since I last ate a fish.\" The others said Bruce was doing a good job. Then Bruce asked who wanted to talk next. Alice raised her hand. Alice went up and said, \"Hi, I am Alice. I do not think I have ever eaten a fish before.\" The others said that was great. \"OK, who else has a story?\" \"How about you, friend?\" \"What's your problem?\" \"Adam said, \"Me? I don't have a problem.\" \"Oh, OK.\" \"You are not being honest.\" \"Aah!\" \"Benjamin said, \"Just start with your name.\" \"OK. Hello. My name is Adam. I'm a small fish.\" \"A small fish? Really?\" \"Tell us a funny story.\" \"I love funny stories.\" \"I actually know one that's pretty good. There was this animal... and it went up to another animal. Normally, they don't talk, animals... but in a funny story, everyone talks... so the animal says to the other animal...\" \"Henry!\" \"Daddy!\" Henry!\" Daddy!\" Henry! Ha ha! Henry! I don't get it. For a small fish, he's not that funny.\" \"No, no, no, no. He's my child. He was taken by some people.\" \"Oh, you poor fish. Humans think they own everything. They are probably from the NA country. Now, there is a father looking for his little boy.\" Adam said, \"What do these markings mean?\" \"I never knew my father!\" \"Group hug.\" \"We're all friends here, friend.\" \"I can't read human writing.\" \"Emma said, \"We have to find a fish that can read this.\" \"Hey, look, big animals.\" \"No, no, no, Emma! Guys, guys. No, Emma. That's mine. Give it to me. Ow! Oh, I'm sorry. Are you OK? Ow, ow, ow. I'm so sorry. You really hit me there. Am I bleeding? Ohh. Ohh, that's good.\" \"Intervention!\" \"Just a bite.\" \"Hold it together, friend! Remember, animals are friends, not food!\" \"Food!\" \"Emma, look out!\" \"Food!\" \"Emma, look out!\" \"Aah!\" \"I'm having fish tonight!\" \"We are ready to go.\" \"[Gasps]\" \"Bubbles!\" \"[Muttering]\" \"My bubbles.\" \"He likes bubbles.\" \"Aah!\" \"Ohh!\" \"No!\" \"Uhh!\" \"[Animal sounds]\" \"[Whimpering]\" \"Hello.\" \"Aah!\" \"Slow down, little one.\" \"There's nothing to worry about.\" \"He's very scared.\" \"I want to go home.\" \"Do you know where my father is?\" \"Child, your father is probably back at the pet store.\" \"Pet store?\" \"Yes, you know, like, I'm from Alice's Fish Place.\" \"Pet Palace.\" \"Fish-O-Rama.\" \"Mail order.\" \"Ebay.\" \"So, which one is it?\" \"I'm from the ocean.\" \"Ah, the ocean.\" \"The ocean? Aah!\" Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! He hasn't been cleaned. Jack! Yes. Clean him! Yes. Ocean. Ooh, the sea. Good. [Happy music playing] There. He is clean. [Pop] Wow. The big blue. What's it like? Big and blue? I knew it. If there's anything you need, just ask your Aunt Deborah. Or if I'm not around, you can talk to my sister Fiona. Hi. How are you? Don't listen to anything my sister says. She's silly. Ha ha ha ha! [Muffled] We have a new one. Can't hear you, Patrick. I said we have a new one. Boy, oh boy. What do we have? Fixing teeth...and by the looks of those pictures...it's not going to be pretty. [Drill sound] Ow! Tools in place? Yes. What did he use to open? That drill. He seems to favor that one lately. I can't see, Fiona. You're getting a little too...Aah! PATRICK: Now he's doing that technique. BLOAT: He's using that file. That's not that file. That's a different one. It has a special shape. Clearly that file. No, no, different one. There were many fish living in a fish tank. One of the fish got stuck inside a small space. The other fish told the stuck fish, \"You got yourself in there. You can get yourself out.\" \n\nThe stuck fish tried to wiggle out but said, \"I can't.\"\n\nThe other fish said, \"Calm down. Alternate wiggling your fins and your tail.\" The stuck fish kept trying to get out.\n\nOne big fish said, \"Nobody touch him. I want to see him do it.\"\n\nThere was a little girl named Xena. The fish said she was a fish killer. They were afraid that Xena might hurt the stuck fish.\n\nXena was going to take the stuck fish home as a present for her birthday. But the stuck fish wanted to go back to his dad. He cried out, \"Daddy! Help me!\" A young fish said, \"I have a bad fin.\" Another fish replied, \"That has never stopped me.\" Some dramatic music played. The young fish gasped. The other fish said, \"Just think about what you need to do.\" The young fish grunted, trying to swim. The other fish encouraged, \"Come on. Perfect. Yay! You did it! Good swimming.\" They laughed happily. The other fish said, \"You're from the ocean, just like me.\" The young fish nodded, thinking. The other fish noticed and asked, \"What are you thinking about?\" The young fish replied, \"I'm thinking tonight, we give the kid a proper welcome.\" They asked the young fish, \"Kid, what's your name?\" The young fish answered, \"Nemo. I'm Nemo.\" The group repeated, \"Nemo.\" Another fish was snoring nearby. The snoring fish said in her sleep, \"Are you going to eat that?\" Later, one fish warned another, \"Be careful with that tool.\" Dramatic music played again as the fish struggled. One fish panted, \"No, no. What does it say?\" The snoring fish woke up, saying nonsense words. One fish warned, \"Look out! Danger eats fish!\" They all screamed in fear as something rumbled. After a loud crash, they coughed from dust. The snoring fish said, \"Wow. Dusty.\" Another fish asked urgently, \"Where's the important thing? No, not that! Get it! Get the important thing!\" The snoring fish hummed a cheerful tune, repeating it happily. One fish grumbled about losing the important thing, saying it was his only chance. But the cheerful fish encouraged, \"When life is hard, know what you have to do? Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming. What do we do? We swim, swim.\" She sang more, but the grumpy fish didn't want to hear it, grumbling about the song stuck in his head. Adam and Benjamin were fish friends. Benjamin said, \"Now it's in my head.\" Adam said, \"Sorry.\" Benjamin asked, \"Adam, do you see anything?\" Adam said, \"Aah! Something's got me.\" Benjamin said, \"That was me. I'm sorry.\" Adam asked, \"Who's that?\" Benjamin asked, \"Who could it be?\" Adam said, \"It's me.\" Benjamin said, \"Are you my conscience?\" Adam said, \"Yeah, yeah. I'm your conscience. We haven't spoken for a while. How are you?\" Benjamin said, \"Can't complain.\" Adam said, \"Yeah? Good.\" Adam said, \"Now, Benjamin, I want you to tell me... Do you see anything?\" Benjamin said, \"I see a... I see a light.\" Adam asked, \"A light?\" Benjamin said, \"Yeah. Over there.\" Benjamin said, \"Hey, conscience, am I dead?\" Adam said, \"No. I see it, too.\" They saw a pretty light. Benjamin said, \"I'm feeling... happy... which is a big deal for me. I want to touch it.\" Then the light went away. Benjamin tried to follow it, saying \"I'm gonna swim with you. I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna be your best friend.\" But Benjamin was not happy again. Adam said, \"Whoa!\" Benjamin said, \"Haah!\" Adam said, \"I can't see! I don't know where I'm going!\" Benjamin said, \"Haah! Haah! Haah! The mask!\" Adam asked, \"What mask?\" Benjamin saw an object and said, \"Hey, look, a mask. Read it!\" Adam said, \"OK, I can't see a thing.\" Benjamin said, \"I'm sorry, but if you could just... bring it a little closer, I kind of need the light.\" Adam brought the object closer. Benjamin read, \"P. Sher...\" Adam said, \"P. Sherman doesn't make any sense!\" Benjamin continued, \"42.\" Adam begged, \"Don't eat me.\" Benjamin kept trying to read in the dim light. \"Just like in the practice.\" \"So what are we?\" \"Guess.\" \"DORY:\" \"Oh, oh.\" \"I've seen one of those.\" \"I'm a fish with a nose like a sword.\" \"Wait, wait, um...\" \"It's a swordfish!\" \"LEADER:\" \"Hey, silly person, let the lady guess.\" \"Where's the butter?\" \"Ooh!\" \"It's on the tip of my tongue!\" \"[Coughs] A food with a hard shell.\" \"Close enough! Oh, it's a big story I'll tell you, child...They're good. Will somebody please give me directions?!\" \"Will somebody please give me directions?!\" Ha ha ha ha ha! I'm serious! \"Blah blah blah, me, me, blah!\" \"Blah blah blah, me, me, me!\" Thank you. Oh, dear. Hey! Hey, come back! Hey, what's the matter? What's the matter? While they're doing their silly little impressions...I am far from home with a fish that can't remember her name! I bet that's frustrating. Meanwhile, my child is out there. Your child? But it doesn't matter because no fish...in this entire ocean is going to help me. Well, I'm helping you. Wait right here. Guys! Is he bothering you again? No, no. He's a good guy. Go easy on him. He's lost his child. Any of you heard of a place? Sure! Ted here's got relatives in that place. Sure do! Oh! Hey! They know that place! [Gasps] You wouldn't know how to get there, would you? You want to follow the big ocean current. That's the big current. Can't miss it. It's in...that direction. And then you follow that for about... Adam the clownfish and Emma the blue tang fish were friends. One day, Adam said, \"Emma! Emma!\" Emma asked, \"Am I out of the game?\" Adam said, \"No, you are doing well! You are winning! But you must stay awake. Where does P. live?\"\n\nEmma said, \"P. lives on WA Road, SY city...\" Adam said, \"That's it!\" He got a small shock.\n\nAdam said, \"Stay awake! Stay awake!\" Emma said, \"Awake. P. 42 WA Road.\" Adam asked, \"You miss your dad, friend?\" Emma said, \"Yes. He is not looking for me. He is afraid of the ocean.\"\n\nSome animal friends were trying to help Emma escape. One friend said, \"My first try to get out landed on sharp things. I wanted to get to the drain. All drains lead to the ocean.\" Another friend said, \"Fish are not meant to be in a box. It does bad things to you.\"\n\nThey started the escape plan. A friend said, \"Once you get in the drain, swim to the bottom and I will tell you what to do next.\" Emma said, \"OK.\" The friend said, \"It will be easy.\" Emma went into the drain. The friend said, \"Do you see a small opening? Inside it, you will see a spinning fan. Wedge this pebble into the fan to stop it spinning.\" Emma did it. A child said, \"Look, everyone! I know that person! It is the kind man who helps small animals!\"\n\nA kind man said, \"The little animals are just eggs. We leave them on the beach to hatch. Then they find their way back to the big sea all by themselves.\"\n\nA child asked, \"But how do you know when they are ready to go?\"\n\nThe kind man said, \"You never really know. But when they know, you will know.\"\n\nThe children laughed and said, \"That kind man is funny!\"\n\nEarlier, a small animal was playing in the waves. \"Up you go!\" the child said, helping the animal up. \"Whee!\" said the small animal as it splashed in the water. The child cheered, \"That was so cool! You rock!\"\n\nThe child's parent smiled and said, \"My child, you did well too.\"\n\nThen some new children came over. \"We need to get to the big city,\" one said. The parent asked, \"Is your friend okay? She looks tired.\"\n\nThe child nodded sadly. \"This is my fault,\" they said quietly. \"I'm very sorry.\"\n\nBut the tired friend suddenly popped up and said, \"Ready or not, here I come!\" She giggled and ran off, and her friend happily chased after her in a game. \"They are trying to speak to each other. One says, 'You are really cute, but I do not know what you are saying!' The other says, 'Say the first thing again.' 'OK, Samuel!' they reply. 'Go, go, go!' they shout. There is screaming and cheering sounds. 'That was fun!' one says. 'I actually enjoyed that,' the other adds. 'Hey, look, turtles!' one exclaims. 'Henry' says, 'Ha ha! Most excellent! Now turn around and swim straight on through to SY city!' 'No worries!' they reply. 'Thank you, dude Henry!' 'Bye!' one calls out. 'You tell your little one I said hi, OK?' 'Henry' responds. 'See you later!' one shouts. 'Bye, everyone!' the other says. 'Thomas would have loved this,' one remarks. 'Ooh! Hey! Henry, I forgot! How old are you?' 'Henry' replies, '150, dude! And still young! Rock on!' '150!' the other exclaims. 'I have to remember that.' 'We going in there?' one asks. 'Yep,' the other replies. 'To SY city? Yep, we will just swim straight.' One starts singing, 'Just keep swimming, just keep swimming.' The other says, 'Boy, this is taking a while.' 'How about we play a game?' one suggests. They proceed to play a game describing each other. Then one says, 'Wait, wait, wait. I have definitely seen this floating speck before. That means we have passed it before, and that means we are going in circles, and that means we are not going straight! Get to the surface. We will figure it out up there.' The other agrees, 'Hey! Relax. Take a deep breath.' After breathing, one says, 'Now, let us ask somebody for directions.' The other agrees, 'Fine.' \"Who do you want to ask, the small thing?\" \"There's nobody here!\" \"There has to be someone.\" \"It's the big water, silly.\" \"We're not the only two in here.\" \"Let's see.\" \"OK, no one there.\" \"Nope.\" \"Nothing.\" \"[Makes a surprised sound]\" \"There's somebody.\" \"Hey!\" \"Excuse...\" \"Diana, Diana, Diana!\" \"Now it's my turn.\" \"I'm thinking of something dark and mysterious.\" \"It's a fish we don't know.\" \"If we ask it directions... it could eat us and spit out our bones!\" \"What is it with men and asking for directions?\" \"I don't want to talk about that right now.\" \"Let's talk about the \"Let's Not Die\" thing.\" \"You want to get out of here?\" \"Of course I do.\" \"How are we going to do that unless we give it a try?\" \"Diana, you don't fully understand...\" \"Come on. Trust me on this. [Makes a tired sound] All right. Excuse me! Hello! Small one? Hello! Don't be rude. Say hi. Hello! Don't be rude. Say hi. Ha. Hello. His son Jack... Nemo. Nemo was taken to... the SY city. The SY city! And it's really, really important... that we get there as fast as we can... so can you help us out? Come on, small one. Come on. Diana, I'm a small one. I don't think that's a small one. Oh! Big one. Big fish. OK. Maybe he only speaks fish language. [Makes fish sounds] We need... To find his son. What are you doing? Are you sure you speak fish language? Can you give us directions? Can you give us directions? Can you give us directions? Diana! Who knows what you're saying! See, he's swimming away. Come back. He's not coming back. You made him upset. Maybe a different way of speaking. [Makes more fish sounds] Diana! This is not fish language. You're speaking upset stomach. Maybe I should try a different way. Don't. Adam and Benjamin were in a big animal. Adam said, \"We are stuck here! I have to find my child! I have to tell them something!\"\n\nBenjamin said, \"It will be OK. You cannot promise nothing will happen to your child. That is not fun.\"\n\nThey heard noises. Benjamin said, \"I think the animal says we have stopped.\"\n\nAdam said, \"The water is going down! It is half empty!\"\n\nBenjamin said, \"It is half full.\"\n\nAdam said, \"The animal wants to eat us! Tell it I do not want to be food!\" \"Please?\" \"Nobody has stayed with me for a long time before.\" \"If you go away, I just... I remember things better when you are here.\" \"I do.\" \"Look...\" \"I remember it.\" \"I do. It's there.\" \"I know it is because when I look at you... I can feel it.\" \"I look at you and I...\" \"I'm home.\" \"Please... I don't want that to go away.\" \"I don't want to forget.\" \"I'm sorry, but I do.\" \n\n\"Sweet food from the sky.\" \"Sweet drink of life!\"\nBOTH: \"Hey! Hey! Hey!\" \"This is our place! Go away!\"\n\nBOTH: \"Hey! Hey! Hey!\" \"Yes, keep swimming away. You got it.\"\n\"Yes, friend!\"\n\n\"Oh! I got one here!\" \n\"Have you seen my parent?\"\n\"Got you!\"\n\"Hey! Hey! Hey! Come back here! You let them go!\"\nBOTH: \"Hey! Hey! Hey!\"\n\"Parent! Parent! Parent! Parent!\"\n\n\"Um, excuse me. Are you okay?\"\n\"I don't know where I am. I don't know what's going on. I think I lost somebody, but I can't remember.\"\n\"It's OK. I'm looking for someone too. Hey, we can look together.\"\n\"I'm Diana. I'm Oliver.\"\n\"Oliver? That's a nice name.\"\n\n\"Parent! Parent!\"\n\"Wait a minute. Is it your parent or my parent?\"\n\"My parent.\"\n\"Got it. Parent! Parent!\"\n\"Oh. NE city.\"\n\"NE city! P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, NE city.\"\n\"Aah! Oliver! It's you!\"\n\"Aah! You're Oliver!\"\n\"Yes, yes, I'm Oliver! You're Oliver! You were gone. I saw you. And here you are!\" \"I found you.\" \"You're not gone.\" \"And your parent...\" \"Your parent!\" \"You know my parent?\" \"!\" \"Where is he?\" \"This way!\" \"He went this way.\" \"Quick!\" \"Hey, hey, hey!\" Hey! Hey! Have you seen an orange fish swim by? It looks just like him! But bigger!\" Yeah, I saw him, bluey. But I'm not telling you where he went... and there's no way you're gonna make me. Mine. Aah! All right! I'll talk! He went to the water area! Aah! [Thump] Hey, look out! I'm sorry. I'm just trying to get home. Dad! Dad! Dad! Daddy! Dad! Nemo's alive! Dad! Nemo's alive! Dory? Nemo! Daddy!

{"text": "Alice: \"Wow.\"\nBenjamin: \"Mmm. Wow. Mmm-hmm. Wow.\"\nAlice: \"Yes, Cameron. I see it. It's beautiful. So, when you said you wanted a great view, you didn't think you were going to get the whole view, did you?\"\nBenjamin: \"Oh, yeah! A fish can breathe out here. Did I deliver or did I deliver?\"\nAlice: \"You delivered. It wasn't so easy. A lot of fish had their eyes on this place.\"\nBenjamin: \"You better believe they did. Every single one of them. You did good and the neighborhood is awesome.\"\n(Laughter of young fish)\nBenjamin: \"So you do like it, don't you?\"\nAlice: \"No, no, I really do like it. But, Cameron, I know that this place is desirable, great schools, amazing view, but do we really need so much space?\"\nBenjamin: \"Alice, honey, these are our kids we're talking about. They deserve the best. Look. They'll wake up, see an animal right by their window!\"\nAlice: \"Shh! You're going to wake the kids.\"\nBenjamin: \"Oh, right. Right. Aw, look. They're dreaming. We still have to name them.\"\nAlice: \"All of them? Right now?\"\nBenjamin: \"All right. We'll name this half Cameron Jr. And this half Alice Jr. Okay, we're done.\"\nAlice: \"I like David.\"\nBenjamin: \"David? We'll name one David, but I'd like most of them to be Cameron Jr. In a few days, we're going to be parents!\"\nAlice: \"Yeah. What if they don't like me?\"\nBenjamin: \"Alice... There's over 400 eggs. Odds are one of them is bound to like you. You remember how we met?\"\nAlice: \"I try not to.\"\nBenjamin: \"Well, I remember. Miss, can you see if I have something in my mouth? Look closer.\"\nAlice: (Laughs) \"Get away! Here he is. Cutie's here!\"\n(A scary event happens, Benjamin groans)\nBenjamin: \"Alice! Alice?\" \"(GASPS)\" \"Charlotte!\" \"Charlotte?\" \"There, there.\" \"It's okay.\" \"Father is here.\" \"Father has you.\" \"I promise I will never let anything happen to you,\" \"Nemo.\" \"First day of school!\" \"Wake up!\" \"Come on.\" \"First day of school.\" \"I do not want to go to school.\" \"Not you, Father.\" \"Me.\" \"Okay.\" \"Get up!\" \"Time for school!\" \"All right, I'm up. It's time for school.\" \"Oh, boy!\" \"Nemo! First day of school!\" \"Don't move. You'll never get out of there yourself. I'll do it. You feel a break? No. Sometimes fluid is rushing to the area. Any rushing fluids? No. How many stripes do I have? Answer the question. Three. No! Something's wrong with you. I have one, two... Three. That's all I have? You're okay. How's the lucky fin? Lucky. Let's see. Sure you want to go to school this year? You can wait five or six years. Come on, Dad. It's time for school. Forgot to brush. (SIGHS) Do you want this plant to sting you? Yes. Brush. I'm done. You missed a spot. Where? There. Right there. And here and here. We're excited. First day of school. Here we go. We're ready to learn. What do we have to remember about the ocean? It's not safe. That's my boy. First, we check to see that the coast is clear. We go out and back in. Then we go out and back in. Then one more time. Out and back in. If you want to do it four times... Dad... All right. Come on, boy. Maybe while I'm at school, I'll see a big fish. I doubt that. Have you ever met a big fish? No, and I don't plan to. How old are sea turtles? Sea turtles? I don't know. Samuel from next door said that sea turtles live to be about 100 years old. If I ever meet a sea turtle, I'll ask him, after I'm done talking to the big fish. \"Here you are!\" \"Come aboard, explorers.\" \"Learning is so fun,\" \"When you think thoughts that are real.\"\n\"Child, you can go now.\" \"Well, hello.\" \"Who is this?\" \"I'm Nemo.\" \"Nemo, all new explorers must answer a question.\" \"Okay.\" \"You live in what kind of home?\" \"In a small cave.\" \"Yes, that's right.\" \"Don't hurt yourself.\" \"Welcome aboard.\" \"Just so you know, they have a little fin.\" \"If they are having trouble swimming, let them take a break. 15 minutes.\"\n\"Child, it's time for you to go now.\" \"We're going to stay together.\" \"Okay, class. Pay attention up front. Remember, we keep our bodies to ourselves.\" \"Oh, no!\" \"Bye, Nemo.\" \"Bye, Dad.\" \"Bye, child. Be safe.\"\n\"You're doing well for a first-timer. You can't hold on to them forever, can you? I had a tough time when my eldest went out on the journey.\"\n\"The journey! They're going on a journey? Are you crazy? Why don't we put them in danger now?\"\n\"Hey, friend, calm down.\" \"Don't tell me to be calm.\"\n\"For a small fish, they really aren't that funny. Pity.\"\n\"Let's name the creatures, the creatures, the creatures. Let's name the creatures that live in the sea. Shells and bugs, spiky things, fish like you and me!\"\n\"Come on. Sing with me. Seaweed is cool, seaweed is fun. It makes its food from the rays of the sun.\"\n\"Okay, the journey. All right, kids. Feel free to explore, but stay close.\"\n\"Look at all the tiny creatures! Gather. An ecosystem contained in one small speck.\"\n\"Come on. Let's go. Come on. Sing with me. There's sponges, jellyfish, coral, sea walnuts and more!\"\n\"Hey, friends, wait up. Whoa! Cool. You saved my life!\" Emma and Gabriel were going to touch something big. \"Look at me. I'm going to go touch the thing,\" said Gabriel.\n\n\"Oh, yeah? Let's see you get closer,\" said Emma.\n\n\"Beat that. Come on, Gabriel. How far can you go?\" asked Emma.\n\n\"My dad says it's not safe,\" said Gabriel.\n\n\"Gabriel, no!\" said his dad, Adam. \"You were about to go too far.\"\n\n\"No! Good thing I was here,\" said Adam. \"He wasn't going to go.\"\n\n\"He was too afraid,\" said Emma.\n\n\"I wasn't,\" said Gabriel.\n\n\"This does not concern you,\" said Adam to Emma. \"You're lucky I don't tell your parents. You can't swim well.\"\n\n\"I can swim fine, Dad, okay?\" said Gabriel.\n\n\"No. It's not okay,\" said Adam. \"You shouldn't be near here. You'll start school in a year or two.\"\n\n\"No. Just because you're scared...you think you can't do these things, but you just can't!\" said Gabriel.\n\n\"I hate you,\" said Gabriel to his dad.\n\nThe teacher, Mr. Ray, said, \"He's quite safe with me.\"\n\n\"I'm sure he is,\" said Adam. \"But you have a large class and he can get lost from sight if you're not looking.\"\n\n\"Oh, my gosh! Gabriel's swimming out too far,\" said Mr. Ray.\n\n\"Gabriel! What do you think you're doing?\" said Adam. \"You're going to get stuck and I'm going to have to get you before another fish does. Get back here. I said get back here now!\"\n\n\"Stop. You take one more move, mister...Don't you dare. If you put one fin on that thing...\"\n\n\"Are you listening to me? Don't touch the thing...\"\n\n\"Gabriel!\" shouted Adam. \"He touched the thing.\"\n\n\"You paddle your little tail back here. That's right. You are in big trouble, young man. Do you hear me? Big...Aagghh!\" \"Daddy, help me!\" \"I'm coming, Emma.\" \"Get under me, kids.\" \"No!\" \"Dad!\" \"Quinn!\" \"Emma!\" \"Emma!\" \"Emma, no!\" \"Emma!\" \"Emma, Emma!\" \"No!\" \"Emma, Emma!\" \"(FRIGHTENED SOUNDS)\" \"Hold on!\" \"(PANTING) \"Oh, no.\" \"No.\" \"It's gone.\" \"It's gone.\" \"It's gone.\" \"It can't be gone.\" \"No.\" \"No!\" \"Emma! Emma...\" Emma! No.\" Emma!\" Emma! Emma! No.\" No.\" No.\" \"Please, no.\" No, no.\" Has anybody seen a boat? Please. A white boat? My child! My child! My child! Help me. Please. Look out! Oh, sorry. I didn't see you. Are you okay? Gone. There, there. Gone. It's all right. It'll be okay. No, they took my child away. I have to find the boat. A boat? I've seen a boat. You have? A white one? Hi. I'm Grace. Where? Which way? Oh. It went this way. Follow me. Thank you. Thank you so much. No problem. Wait. Quit it. I'm trying to swim here. The ocean isn't big enough for you? You got a problem? Do you? Do you? Want a piece of me? Yeah. I'm scared now! Wait. Stop following me, okay? What? You're showing me which way the boat went. A boat? I've seen a boat. It passed by not too long ago. It went this way. Follow me. Wait a minute. What is going on? You already told me which way the boat was going. I did? Oh, no. If this is some kind of joke, it's not funny and I know funny. I'm a clownfish. No, it's not. I'm so sorry. See, I suffer from short-term memory loss. Short-term memory loss. \"I do not remember things.\" \"No.\" \"I forget quickly.\" \"It happens in my family.\" \"At least I think it does.\" \"Uh...\" \"Hmm.\" \"Where are they?\" \"Can I help you?\" \"Something is wrong with you.\" \"Really.\" \"You are wasting my time.\" \"I have to find my child.\" \"Hello.\" \"Well, hi!\" \"My name is Benjamin.\" \"It is all right. I understand. Why trust a shark, right? (Laughs) So, what are a couple of small ones like you doing out so late? Nothing. We are not even out. Great. Then how would you small ones like to come to a small party I am having? You mean like a party? Yes, right. A party. What do you say? I love parties. That sounds like fun. Parties are fun and it is tempting, but we cannot because...\" Come on. I insist. Okay. That is all that matters. Look. Balloons. It is a party. Mind your distance, though. Those balloons can be a bit dangerous. You would not want one of them to pop. Anchor! Chum! There you are, Benjamin. Finally. We got company. It is about time, mate. We have gone through the snacks and I am hungry. We almost had to have a feeding frenzy. Let us get this over with. (Ding) Right then. The meeting has officially come to order. Let us all say the pledge. I am a nice shark, not a mindless eating machine. If I am to change this image, I must first change myself. Fish are friends, not food. Except stinking dolphins. Dolphins! Yes, they think they are so cute. Look, I am a flipping little dolphin. Let me flip for you. Am I not something? Today's meeting is step five Bring a Fish Friend. Do you all have your friends? Got mine. Hey there! How about you, Chum? Well, I seem to have misplaced my friend. It is all right, Chum. Help yourself to one of my friends. Thanks, mate. A little chum for Chum. Hello, my friends. Adam is a fish. \"Hello, Adam,\" we said. \"It has been many days since I last ate fish. I hope I am not made into soup.\"\n\n\"You are very good,\" we said. \"Thanks be to God.\"\n\n\"Who is next?\" someone asked.\n\n\"Pick me!\" a little Emma said. \"Come up here!\"\n\n\"Hi, my name is Emma,\" she said. \"Hello, Emma. I do not think I have ever eaten a fish.\"\n\n\"That is great!\" we all said. \"Good for you!\"\n\n\"I am glad I told the truth,\" Emma said. Anyone else?\"\n\n\"How about you?\" someone asked Patrick.\n\n\"Me? I have no problem,\" said Patrick.\n\n\"Denial,\" we all said.\n\n\"Just tell us your name,\" someone said.\n\n\"Hello, my name is Patrick. I am a fish,\" he said.\n\n\"A fish? Really?\" we said. \"Tell us a funny story.\"\n\n\"I love funny stories,\" said Dory. Patrick told his story but it was not very funny.\n\n\"For a fish, he is not that funny,\" someone said.\n\n\"No, Nora is my child,\" said Patrick. \"She was taken by some people.\"\n\n\"You poor fish,\" we said. \"Humans think they own everything.\"\n\n\"There is a father looking for his little child,\" said someone.\n\nWe could not read the writing on the shell. \"We need a fish who can read this,\" someone said.\n\n\"Look, sharks!\" someone shouted.\n\n\"That is my shell,\" said Dory. \"Give it back!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" said someone. \"Are you okay? I hit you hard.\"\n\n\"Am I bleeding?\" Dory asked.\n\n\"Dory, are you okay?\" someone asked. Then someone shouted, \"Intervention! Just a small bite!\"\n\n\"Stay strong, friend,\" we said. \"Pets are friends, not for eating.\" \"Food!\" \"Emma, be careful.\" \"I want to eat pets tonight.\" \"Remember the rules, friend.\" \"Just one bite.\" \"Hello.\" \"There's no way out.\" \"There must be a way to escape.\" \"Who is there?\" \"Help me find a way out.\" \"Sorry.\" \"You'll have to come back later.\" \"We're trying to escape.\" \"There's no way out.\" \"There must be a way to escape.\" \"Here's something. 'Es-ca-p.' I wonder what that means.\" \"It's spelled just like the word 'escape.'\" \"Let's go.\" \"Here's Adam!\" \"Wait a minute. You can read?\" \"I can read? That's right!\" \"Then here. Read this now.\" \"He doesn't mean it. He never even knew his father.\" \"Don't give up.\" \"Oh, no! It's blocked.\" \"No, Adam! Sorry about... Adam, friend. He's really... A nice guy.\" \"I need to get that mask.\" \"You want that mask? Okay.\" \"No, no, no, no! Quick. Grab the mask.\" \"Oh, no. Adam. What? Swim away!\" \"Emma: Is the party over?\" (PING) \"Nice. Dad! Daddy?\" \"Doctor: Hello. Prep for the patient's treatment, please? And I'll need more supplies.\" \"All right. Hello, little pet. Beautiful, isn't it? I found that pet struggling for life and I saved it.\" \"Has the medicine kicked in yet?\" (Patient makes sounds) \"Bubbles! My bubbles.\" \"It likes bubbles.\" (Scared sounds) (Whimpers) \"Hello.\" \"Aaagghh! Slow down, little pet. There's nothing to worry about.\" \"It's scared to death.\" \"I want to go home. Do you know where my dad is?\" \"Your dad's probably back at the pet store.\" \"Pet store? Like I'm from a pet shop.\" \"Pet shop.\" \"Pet shop.\" \"Mail order.\" \"Online shop.\" \"Which one is it?\" \"I'm from the ocean.\" \"Ah, the big water.\" \"The big water!\" \"Aagghh!\" \"David hasn't been cleaned yet.\" \"David!\" \"Clean him!\" \"Yes.\" \"Big water.\" \"The water.\" \"There.\" \"He is clean.\" \"\"Wow.\" \"The big blue.\" \"What's it like?\" \"Uh...\" \"Big and blue?\" \"I knew it.\" \"If there's anything you need, ask your Emma. That's me. If I'm not around you can always talk to my sister, Fiona.\" \"Hi.\" \"How are you?\" \"Don't listen to anything my sister says. She's not smart.\" \"(MUFFLED CALL) \"Can't hear you, Penelope.\" \"I said we got a live one.\" \"Yes!\" \"Boy, oh, boy.\" \"What have we got?\" \"Tooth fixing. It's not going to be pretty. Aagghh!\" \"Tool put in?\" \"Yes.\" \"What did he use to open?\" \"A special drill. He likes that one. I can't see, Fiona. (MUMBLES) Agh! \"Way to fix teeth.\" That's a special tool. That's not that special tool. That's another special tool. It has a different shape. That tool! That tool! There I go. Little help. Over here. I'll go make him smaller. Pffft! All right. Go ahead and rinse. The human mouth is a dirty place. Nigel. What did I Miss? Tooth fixing. A hard one. What did he use to open? A special drill. He likes it. Hope he doesn't get too much stuff at the end. Hello. Who's this? New one. The tooth doctor took him off the plants. From outside? Sorry if I was mean to you. Fish got to swim. Birds got to eat. No, no. Those aren't your fish. They're my fish. Come on. Go. Shoo. The picture broke. This here's Diana. She's my niece. Going to be eight this week. Hey, little one. Say hello to your new mother. She's going to be here Friday to pick you up. One fish said, \"Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming.\" The other fish asked, \"What do we do?\" The first fish replied, \"We swim.\" \"No singing,\" said the other fish. \"I love to swim,\" said the first fish. \"And when you want to swim you want to...\" \"I'm going to get stuck with that song,\" said the second fish. \"It's in my head!\" \"Sorry,\" said the first fish.\n\n\"See anything?\" asked the second fish. \"Something's got me!\" said the first fish. \"That was me. Sorry,\" said the second fish. \"Who's that?\" \"Who could it be?\" \"It's me,\" replied the second fish.\n\n\"Are you my conscience?\" asked the first fish. \"Yeah, I'm your conscience,\" said the second fish. \"We haven't spoken for a while. How are you?\" \"Can't complain,\" replied the first fish. \"Good. Now, tell me, do you see anything?\" asked the second fish. \"I see a light,\" said the first fish. \"Over there.\" \"Hey, conscience, am I dead?\" asked the first fish.\n\n\"I see it, too,\" said the second fish. \"What is it? It's so pretty! I'm feeling happy. I want to touch it.\" \"Hey, come back. Come on back here. I'm going to get you,\" said the second fish. \"I'm going to swim with you. I'm going to be your best friend.\"\n\n\"The good feeling's gone,\" said the first fish. They both screamed. \"I can't see. I don't know where I'm going,\" said the first fish. \"The mask!\" said the second fish. \"What mask?\" asked the first fish. \"Look. A mask,\" said the second fish. \"Read it!\"\n\n\"I need the light,\" said the first fish. \"Just read it!\" said the second fish.\n\nThe first fish read, \"P... Sher... P not Shirley. The first line's 'P. Sherman.' Second line. '42... Wallaby.' The second line's '42 Wallaby Way.' Sydney. It's Sydney!\"\n\n\"Duck!\" yelled the second fish. \"I'm dead. I'm dead,\" panted the second fish. We need you to take a small rock inside there and jam the gears. You do that and this fish tank is going to get dirtier by the minute. Soon the doctor will have to clean the tank. When he does, he will take us out of the tank, put us in small bags, then we will roll down the counter, out of the window, off the shade, into the bushes, across the street and into the harbor. It is a perfect plan. Who is with me? I. I think you are silly. No offence, kid, but you are not the best swimmer. He is fine. He can do this. So, Matthew, what do you think? Let's do it! P. Sherman, 42 WA street, SY city. Where are you going? To P. Sherman, 42 WA street, SY city. If you ask where I am going, I will tell you. P. Sherman, 42 WA street, SY city. Where? I am sorry. I did not hear you. Excuse me. Excuse me. Hi. Do you know how to get... Hello? Wait. Can you tell me... Hey! Hold it! Wait a minute. I am trying to talk to you. Okay, guys. Come back here. One quick question. I need to... And they are gone again. P. Sherman, 42 WA street, SY city. Why do I have to tell you again? I do not get tired of it. All right, here is the thing. I think it is best if I carry on from here by... By myself. Okay. You know. Alone. Without... Well, not without you, but I do not want you with me. Huh? I do not want to hurt your feelings. You want me to leave? Well, not... Yes. Yeah. I just cannot afford any more delays. You are one of those fish that cause delays. Sometimes it is a good thing. There is a group of fish. They are delay fish. You mean... You mean you do not like me? Of course I like you. Because I like you I do not want to be with you. It is a complicated emotion. Do not cry. I like you. Hey, you! A kind person asked, \"Lady, is this person bothering you?\" Another person said, \"I do not remember.\" The first person asked again, \"Were you bothered?\" The second person said, \"No, no. We're just talking.\" The kind person asked, \"Do you know how I can get somewhere?\" But the other person said, \"We're talking to the lady, not you.\" Then the kind person asked the lady, \"Do you like impressions?\" The lady said yes. The kind person said, \"Okay, just like in practice.\" Then the kind person started doing impressions, pretending to be different animals. The first impression was a fish with a long nose. The lady guessed it was a swordfish. The kind person said, \"Hey clown, let the lady guess.\" The kind person kept doing impressions of different animals like a lobster and a clam. The lady had trouble guessing some of them. After the impressions, the kind person asked again, \"Would somebody give me directions?\" But the other person mocked the question. The lady felt bad that the kind person was far from home and trying to find their child. She said she was trying to help find the kind person's child named Nemo. The other impressionist people overheard and said they knew of a place called Sydney and could give directions to get there using a big ocean current. The kind person was very happy to get directions to find Nemo in Sydney. \"Friends, thank you.\" \"Do not mention it.\" \"Just relax.\" \"Okay, friend?\" \"You all!\" \"You really helped him.\" \"Goodbye.\" \"Ma'am.\" \"One more thing.\" \"Yes?\" \"When you come to this water path, swim through it, not over it.\" \"Water path.\" \"Through it.\" \"Not over it.\" \"I will remember.\" \"Hey!\" \"Wait up, friend.\" \"Hold on.\" \"Wait.\" \"I have got to tell you something.\" \"Wow.\" \"Nice water path.\" Hello! (ECHO) \"Let us go.\" \"No, no. Bad water path. Bad water path. Bad water path.\" \"We are going to swim over this thing.\" \"Something is telling me we should swim through it.\" \"Are you looking at this thing? It looks dangerous. I am sorry, but I think we should swim through.\" I am done talking about this. Over we go. Come on. Trust me on this.\" \"Trust you?\" \"Yes. Trust. It is what friends do.\" \"Something shiny!\" \"Where?\" \"It just swam over the water path. Come on.\" \"Okay.\" \"Boy, it sure is clear up here.\" \"Exactly. And look at that. There is the flow. We should be there in no time.\" \"Hey, little one.\" \"You wanted to go through the water path. I shall call him Squishy and he shall be mine. Come here, Squishy. Come here, little Squishy. (BABY TALK) Ow! \"That is a stinger!\" Bad Squishy. Shoo! Get away. \"Let me see.\" Do not touch it. I am not going to touch it. I just want to look. How come it did not sting you? It did. Hold still. I live in this home and I am used to these kind of stings. Come here. You are going to be fine. But now we know that we do not want to touch these again. Let us be thankful it was just a little one. Do not move. This is bad, Friend. Boing. Boing. Friend! You cannot catch me. Do not bounce on the tops. They will not sting you! The tops do not sting you. Alice and Benjamin were playing a fun game. They were hopping on the tops of some big jellyfish. \"Don't touch the long arms,\" said Alice. \"Only the tops.\" Benjamin said, \"Got it!\"\n\nThey started hopping. \"Wait!\" said Alice. \"Go faster if you want to win.\" \"Wheee!\" said Benjamin. \"I can do this!\"\n\n\"Be careful,\" said Alice. \"I won't make you cry when I win,\" said Benjamin. \"You can't beat me!\" said Alice. \"I'm faster!\"\n\n\"Are you hungry?\" asked Alice. \"You're going to eat my bubbles!\" She blew bubbles at Benjamin. Benjamin moved left and right to avoid them.\n\n\"The clownfish wins!\" said Alice. \"We did it!\" But then Alice couldn't see Benjamin. \"Benjamin? Benjamin!\" she called. She found him asleep. \"Stay awake!\" she told him.\n\nBenjamin said weakly, \"Awake... PE city... Awake...\" Alice missed her dad. \"Your dad is looking for you,\" said Benjamin. \"He's scared of the big ocean,\" said Alice.\n\nA big fish asked, \"How many times have you tried to leave this place?\" \"I've lost count.\" \"Animals aren't meant to be in a box, kid.\" \"It does things to you.\" \"The bubbles, the bubbles!\" \"Potty break!\" \"He just grabbed the book.\" \"We have a few minutes.\" \"That's your cue.\" \"You can do it, kid.\" \"We got to be quick.\" \"Once you get in, swim to the bottom and I'll talk you through the rest.\" \"Okay.\" \"Go on.\" \"It'll be easy.\" \"(TAKES A DEEP BREATH) \"Nicely done.\" \"Can you hear me?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Here comes the pebble.\" \"Now, do you see a small opening?\" \"Uh-huh.\" \"Okay.\" \"Inside it you'll see a turning fan.\" \"Very carefully, wedge that pebble into the fan to stop it turning.\" \"Careful, Adam.\" \"I can't do it.\" \"This isn't a good idea.\" \"He'll be fine. Try again!\" Okay. That's it, Adam. Nice and steady. I got it, I got it! He did it. That's great, kid. Now swim up the tube and out. Oh, no! Benjamin! Adam! Get him out of there! Help him! What do we do? Oh, no! Stay calm, kid. Just don't panic. Help me! Adam, grab hold of this. No! Feed me more. That's it! Come on, Adam. Grab it. I got it. Pull! Benjamin, don't make him go back in there. No. We're done. (WHIMPERS) Friendly creature: Dude? Dude? Dude? Focus, dude. Dude? He lives. Hey, dude. (SOUND) What happened? I saw the whole thing, dude. First you were all, like, whoa! And then we were all, like, whoa! Then you were, like, whoa... What are you talking about? You, little one! Taking on the jellies. You got serious bravery, dude. Awesome. Oh, my stomach. Man, no hurling on the shell. I just cleaned it. \"Did you go through the forest?\" \"One at a time.\" \"Mr. Fish, are you hurt?\" \"Sorry.\" \"I was not clear.\" \"So where are you going?\" \"You see, my child was taken.\" \"No way!\" \"What happened?\" \"No, children.\" \"I don't want to talk about it.\" \"Come on.\" \"Please.\" \"Well, okay.\" \"I live on this reef, far from here.\" \"This is going to be good.\" \"I can tell. My child, Nora, was angry at me. Maybe Nora wouldn't have done it if I hadn't been so tough. I don't know. Nora swam in the open water to a boat and some people appeared and I tried to stop them. The boat was too fast, so we swam out into the ocean... Nora couldn't stop them. Then Nora's parent swims out to the ocean and they meet three big fish. The parent scares them away. Then dives deep... It's very dark there. You can't see anything. The only thing they can see down there is... A big, scary creature with sharp teeth! Nice move. Then the parent has to escape... These fish have been searching the ocean for days on the ocean current. Nora may be on the way here right now. That should bring Nora to the harbor... In a few days. This parent will not stop until finding the child. I hope the parent makes it. That's one dedicated parent, if you ask me. \"Mine.\" \"Mine.\" \"Mine.\" \"Mine.\" \"Mine.\" Would you be quiet? You are like rats with wings. This person is looking for the child, Nora. Nora was taken off the reef by people... There. Take it. Say that again. You said something about Nora. \"Mine.\" \"Mine.\" \"Mine.\" \"Mine.\" \"Mine.\" (ANGRY SOUND) \"Mine.\" Last I heard, the parent is heading towards the harbor. Great! Is Nora okay? I don't know, but whatever you do, don't mention D-A-R... It's okay. I know who you're talking about. Gill? Hey, friend. I'm sorry I couldn't stop... GILL: I'm the one who should be sorry. All right, we have less than two days before Diana gets here. This fish home will get very dirty in that time, but we have to help it along. Frank, no cleaning. I shall not clean. Everyone else, be as gross as possible. Think dirty thoughts. We're going to make this fish home so filthy, the animal doctor will have to clean it. (BURPS) Good work. All right, we're here, friends. Get ready! Your exit is coming up, pal. Where? I don't see it. Right there. I see it. I see it. You mean the swirling vortex of terror? That's it, dude. Of course it is. First, find your exit buddy. Do you have your exit buddy? Yes. Gabriel here will now tell you how to properly exit. Good day. We're going to have a great jump today. Turn sharply as you hit the wall. There's a loud bottom turn, so watch out. Remember, do it fast, roll it and punch it! It's like he's trying to speak to me, I know it. You're really cute, but I don't know what you're saying. Say the first thing again. Okay, Squiggly Friend. Go, go, go! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! That was fun. I actually enjoyed that. Hey, look! Turtles. Most excellent. Now, turn around and swim straight on through to the SY city. No worries, pal. No worries. Thank you, Cool Friend. Bye. See you, Squiggly Friend. Tell your little dude I said hi, okay? See you later, dudes. Bye, everyone. Nora would have loved this. Hey, Crush. I forgot. How old are you? 150, dude! And still young. Rock on! 150. I need to remember that. Whoa. We going in there? Yep. P. Sherman, 42 Random Way, SY? Yep. We're going to just swim straight. Just keep swimming... How about we play a game? Okay. \"You've upset Adam.\" \"Maybe a different sound. (MOOING)\" \"This is not a big animal.\" \"You're speaking, like, upset tummy.\" \"Maybe I should try a different sound.\" \"No, don't.\" \"(GROWLING)\" \"You sound sick.\" \"Maybe louder, huh?\" \"Don't do that.\" \"Too much orca.\" \"Didn't that sound a little orca-ish?\" \"It sounds like nothing I've ever heard.\" \"(MOOING) - (GROANS)\" \"Just as well.\" \"Adam might be hungry.\" \"Big animals don't eat little fish.\" \"They eat small sea animals.\" \"Small sea animals: \"Swim away!\" Look. Small sea animals! Move, Dory! Move! Look at that. Would you look at that? Dirty. It's all thanks to you, kid. You made it possible. I am ashamed. Look. Bubbles Angel. (CRIES OF DISTRESS)\" I love the bubbles. (COUGHS)\" Has anybody seen Fiona? Fiona! Early in the morning, and time for doctor. Barbara. Sorry I'm late. Okay. Here we go. Little child. Walks to the counter, drops the things... That's yucky. Tastes good to me. (BURPS)\" Don't you see we are swimming in our own... Shh! Here comes the person. What a dirty place. Barbara, what's my first time tomorrow? Leave it open. I've got to clean the fish house before child gets here. You hear that? Yay! The person is going to clean the house! Yeah, we're going to be clean! Ready to see your father? Yes. I wouldn't be surprised if father is out there waiting for you right now. Yeah. Aagghh! (DORY LAUGHS HAPPILY)\" Whoo! Here comes a big one! Come on. You got to try this. Why? What's wrong? We're in a big animal. \"No, but the boat has to be here.\" \"We're going to find it.\" \"I'm totally excited.\" \"(YAWNS) Are you excited?\" \"Dory, wake up.\" \"Come on.\" \"Duck!\" \"That's not a duck.\" \"It's a pelican!\" \"No!\" \"I didn't come this far to be food.\" \"Hey, Nigel.\" \"Would you look at that?\" \"What?\" \"Sun's barely up and Gabriel's had more than he can handle. Yeah. Reckon somebody ought to help the poor guy.\" \"(MURMURS OF AGREEMENT)\" \"Well, don't everybody fly off at once!\" \"(RETCHES)\" \"All right, Gabriel. What is it?\" \"Fish got your tongue?\" \"Love a duck!\" \"I've got to find my son Nemo.\" \"Nemo? He's that fish that's been fighting the whole ocean. Hey, I know where your son... Wait. Come back. Stop! Keep going. He's crazy. I've got something to tell you. Mine. Okay. Don't make any sudden moves. Hop inside my mouth if you want to live. Hop into your mouth? And how does that make me live? Mine? Because I can take you to your son. Yeah, right! No. I know your son. He's orange. He's got a bad fin on one side. That's Nemo! Mine! Mine! Mine! Fasten your seat belts! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Whoo-hoo! Everybody hold on! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! (FISH SCREAM) Too loud. Too loud for me. Twinkle, twinkle, little star. Find a happy place. Find a happy place! Barbara: Emma, your uncle will see you now. All right. Let's see those white teeth. I'm a fish. They're in the SA country. And a fish is a fish. Just like your present. Emma: I got a fishy! Oh, no. Poor little guy. He's dead. Food! Yay! Fishy, fishy, fishy! Must have left your present in the car, sweetie. \"I'll go and get it.\" \"He's still alive!\" \"Why is he playing dead?\" \"He's going to get flushed down the toilet.\" \"He's going to get out of here.\" \"What a smart little guy.\" \"No, not the trash can!\" \"Hey!\" \"I found his dad.\" \"Where's Nemo?\" \"Dentist!\" \"He's over there.\" \"What's a dentist?\" \"Get in there.\" \"I can't go in there.\" \"Oh, yes you can.\" \"Charge!\" (SCREAMS) What the... Emma, sweetie, look out. Hold still. Easy, easy. Hold still! It's all right. Nobody's going to hurt you. Nemo. Oh, my goodness. Gotcha! Nemo! Daddy? Dr. Samuel: Out with you. And stay out! Daddy? Frank? Frank! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Oh, no! To the top of the NE mountain. Why are you sleeping? Hurry! David! Ring of Fire! Frank! Emma: Get it out! Crikey! The animals have gone mad! EMMA: (SCREAMS) Get it out! Smack her in the head! Go, Ethan, go! There's a fish in my hair! Ethan. Liam. Tell your dad I said hi. Aaggh! Go get him. (DR. Samuel GROANS) He did it! I'm happy. Is he going to be okay? Don't worry. All drains lead to the ocean. Frank! Aaggh! Daddy! (GASPS) I'm...I'm so sorry. Truly I am. Hey... Alice. If it wasn't for you, I never would have even made it here. So thank you. Hey, wait a minute. Wait. Where are you going? It's over, Alice. We were too late. Nemo's gone. I'm going home now. No. No, you can't. Stop! Please don't go away. Please? No one's ever stuck with me for so long before. \"And if you leave...\" \"I remember things better with you.\" \"Look.\" \"R. Samuel, 42... 42...\" \"Bah!\" \"I remember it.\" \"It's there.\" \"I know it is.\" \"Because when I look at you, I can feel it.\" \"And I look at you and I...\" \"I'm home.\" \"Please.\" \"I don't want that to go away.\" \"I don't want to forget.\" \"I'm sorry, Nora, but I do.\" \"\"Sweet food.\" \"Sweet drink.\" \"Hey!\" \"This is our place.\" Go on. Get out of here.\" Hey, hey, hey. Yeah, that's it. Correct, friend! I got a live one here!\" \"Have you seen my dad?\" Got you! Come back here. You let him go! Dad! Nora: No!  \n\n\"Excuse me.\" \"No.\" \"Are you all right?\" \"I don't know where I am. I don't know what's going on. I think I lost somebody, but I can't remember.\" \"It's okay.\" \"I can't remember. I'm looking for someone, too. We can look together.\" \"I'm Nora.\" \"I'm Benjamin.\" Benjamin? That's a nice name.\" \"Dad!\" \"Dad!\" \"Dad.\" \"Dad.\" \"Dad.\" Wait a minute. Is it your dad or my dad? My dad. Got it. Dad! Where are we anyway? Dad! Syd... Syd... SY city. S. Samuel, 42 WA Way, SY city. \"Benjamin!\" \"What?\" It's you! Benjamin! Yes. I'm Benjamin. You're Benjamin. You were dead. I saw you. And then... Here you are. You're not dead. And your father... Your father! My father? You know my father? Where is he? He went this way. Quick! Hey! Have you seen an orange fish swim by? It looks like him. But bigger. I saw him, but I'm not telling you where he went. And there's no way you're going to make me. Mine.  All right. I'll talk! He went to the fishing grounds. \"I'm so sorry, Gabriel.\" \"Hey, guess what?\" \"What?\" \"Sea animals...\" \"I met one.\" \"And it was very old.\" \"Very old?\" \"Yes.\" \"'Cause someone said they only lived to be 100.\" \"Who said that?\" \"Think I would cross the ocean and not know as much as them?\" \"It was very old!\" \"Not 100.\" \"Who is this person that knows everything wrong?\" \"Time for school!\" \"Time for school!\" \"Time for school!\" \"Get up!\" \"Let's go!\" \"I'm going to win.\" \"No, you're not.\" \"I did it.\" \"My own child beats me.\" \"Climb aboard, explorers. \n\nSo then the sea animal looks over at the other animal and says, \"With things like these, who needs other things?\"\n\nWell, hello, Gabriel. Who's this? An exchange student. I'm from the place, dude. Sweet. Totally.\n\nSeriously, did you really do all the things you say you did?\n\nPardon me. Hello. Don't be alarmed. We wanted to make sure our newest member got home safely. Thanks. We'll see you next week. Keep up with the program, Penelope. Remember, animals are friends. Not food!  Bye!\n\nHold on. Here we go. Next stop, learning.  Bye, child. Have fun.  \n\nGabriel: Bye, parent. Oh! Teacher, wait. I forgot something. Love you, parent.  \n\nParent: I love you too, child.  \n\nGabriel: Parent? You can let go now.\n\nParent: Sorry. Now go have an adventure. Goodbye.\n\nSee you later, friends!  Bye, Gabriel. Gabriel. Gabriel. Bye, Gabriel. See you after school, Penelope.\n\nGabriel: Bye, parent!\n\nParent: Bye, child.\n\nAdult: Adult. I don't understand it. Here this thing has a lifetime guarantee and it breaks. Had to clean the tank myself, take the animals out, put 'em in bags and... Where'd the animals go?\n\n(Sound of traffic)\n\nCome on, child! You got it. That's it. \"You can do it.\" \"That's the shortest green light I've ever seen.\" \"Come on, Emma.\" \"(CHEERING)\" \"(HAPPY LAUGHTER)\" \"Now what?\" \"(CHILDREN'S MUSIC PLAYING)\"", "hash": "e5fab296f34f1de50e998aa3b50d27e3fe1535a621854830c4b53cd32c456bce"}

I'll do it.\" \"Do you feel a pain?\" \"No.\" \"Sometimes water is rushing to that area.\" \"Any rushing water?\" \"No.\" \"How many stripes do I have?\" \"Answer the question.\" \"Three.\" \"No! Something's wrong with you. I have one, two...three. That's all I have?\" You're okay. How's the lucky fin?\" \"Lucky.\" \"Let's see. Are you sure you want to go to school this year? You can wait five or six years.\" \"Come on, Dad. It's time for school.\" \"I forgot to brush.\" Do you want this plant to sting you?\" \"Yes.\" \"Brush.\" \"I'm done.\" \"You missed a spot.\" \"Where?\" \"There. Right there. And here and here.\" We're excited. First day of school. Here we go. We're ready to learn. What do we have to remember about the ocean?\" \"It's not safe.\" \"That's my boy. First, we check to see if it's clear. We go out and back in. Then we go out and back in. Then one more time. Out and back in.\" \"If you want to do it four times...\" \"Dad.\" \"Okay. Come on, boy. Maybe while I'm at school, I'll see a big fish.\" \"I doubt that.\" \"Have you ever met a big fish?\" \"No, and I don't plan to.\" \"How old are some animals?\" \"Some animals? I don't know. The child from next door said that some animals live to be about 100 years old.\" \"If I ever meet an animal like that, I'll ask them - after I'm done talking to the big fish.\" \"Hold on. Wait to cross. Hold on. Wait to cross. Hold my fin. You're not going to get scared like you did at the petting zoo. That bug was about to charge.\" \"I wonder where we're supposed to go.\" \"Bye, Mom.\" \"I'll pick you up after school. Come on, you guys.\" \"Stop it.\" \"Give it back.\" \"Come on.\" \"Well try over there.\" \"Excuse me.\" \"Is this where we meet the teacher?\" \"Look who's out of the home.\" \"Yes, surprising, I know.\" \"Look who's out of the home.\" \"Yes, surprising, I know.\" \"Matthew?\" \"David.\" \"Thomas.\" \"Jack.\" \"Patrick.\" \"Hey, you're a fish with colors.\" \"You're funny, right? Tell us a joke.\" \"Yeah, good idea.\" \"That's a common misunderstanding. Fish with colors are no funnier than other fish.\" \"Come on, Funny Fish. Do something funny.\" \"All right. I know one joke. There's a small animal. It moves to...\" Well, it swims. Actually, the small animal isn't moving. It's in one place. And then another animal... I'm mixed up. There was a small animal and another animal. None of them were walking...\" \"Henry! Get out of the yard now!\" \"All right, you kids! Where did you go? Can I go play too?\" \"I would feel better if you go play over on those soft beds. That's where I would play.\" \"What's wrong with his fin?\" \"He looks funny.\" \"Hey, what did I do?\" \"Be nice. It's his first time at school. He was born with it. We call it his lucky fin.\" \"Parent...! See this part? It's shorter than all my other parts. But you can't really tell. Especially when I move them like this.\" \"I don't like water. I'm unpleasant.\" \"Let's name the areas, the areas, the areas. Let's name the areas of the open water.\" \"Teacher.\" \"Come on, Oliver.\" \"Stay with me. There's area, area, area, very deep area. All the rest are too deep for you and me to see. I wonder where my class has gone.\" \"We're under here.\" \"There you are! Come aboard, explorers. Learning is so enjoyable. When you think thoughts that are tested.\" \"Parent, you can go now.\" \"Hello. Who is this?\" \"I'm Oliver.\" \"Well, Oliver, all new explorers must answer a science question.\" \"There, there.\" \"He is gone.\" \"It is all right.\" \"It will be okay.\" \"No, they took him away.\" \"I have to find the boat.\" \"A boat?\" \"I have seen a boat.\" \"You have?\" \"And it passed by not too long ago.\" \"A white one?\" \"Hi. I am Dory.\" \"Where?\" \"Which way?\" \"It went... this way.\" \"Follow me.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Thank you so much.\" \"No problem.\" \"Wait.\" \"Will you quit it?\" \"I am trying to swim.\" \"The ocean is not big enough for you?\" \"You got a problem, friend?\" You got a problem, friend? Do you? Want a piece of me? Yeah. I am scared now!\" \"Wait a minute.\" \"Stop following me.\" What? You are showing me which way the boat went. A boat? I have seen a boat. It passed by not too long ago. A boat? I have seen a boat. It passed by not too long ago. It went... this way. Follow me. Wait a minute. What is going on? You already told me which way the boat was going. I did? Oh, no. If this is some kind of joke, it is not funny and I know funny. I am a clownfish. No, it is not. I am so sorry. See, I suffer from short-term memory loss. Short-term memory loss. I do not believe it. It is true. I forget things almost instantly. It runs in my family. At least I think it does. Where are they? Can I help you? Something is wrong with you. Really. You are wasting my time. I have to find my son. Hello. Well, hi! Name is Bruce. It is all right. I understand. Why trust a shark, right? So, what is a couple of bites like you doing out so late? Nothing. We are not even out. Great. Then how would you morsels like to come to a little get-together I am having? You mean like a party? Yeah, right. A party. I love parties. That sounds like fun. Parties are fun and it is tempting, but we cannot because... Come on. A young fish named Adam was taken from the ocean to a human place. He was scared but an older fish named Fiona tried to comfort him. \"Don't worry,\" said Fiona. \"If you need anything, ask me or my sister Grace.\" But Grace said, \"Don't listen to her, she's silly.\" Some other fish nearby were talking about a medical procedure on a human, using words Adam didn't understand. Adam just wanted to go home to the big blue ocean. \"Who is this?\" \"A new kid.\" \"The doctor took him from the sea.\" \"An outsider.\" \"From my area?\" \"Sorry if I was rude.\" \"Fish need to swim.\" \"Birds need to eat.\" \"No, no.\" \"Those are not your fish.\" \"They are my fish.\" \"Go away.\" \"Shoo.\" \"The bag broke.\" \"This is Diana.\" \"She is my niece. She will be eight years old soon. Hello, little one. Say hi to your new mom. She will come on Friday to take you home. You are her gift. It is our secret.\" \"Mr. Thomas, while that is ready, I will go see someone.\" \nDiana! \"What's wrong with her?\" \"She kept shaking the bag.\" \"Poor Zachary.\" \"He was her gift last year. He went away.\" She kills fish. I cannot go with that girl. I need to go back to my dad.\" \"Dad! Help me!\" He is stuck. Don't touch him. Can you help me? No. You got in there, you get out.\" \"Isaac...\" \"I want to see him do it, okay? Be calm. Move your fins and tail. I cannot. I have a bad fin. That didn't stop me. Think about what to do. Great. \"You did it.\" Good move. Like you, Isaac. Yeah. I've seen that look before. What are you thinking? I'm thinking...tonight we welcome the kid properly. \"So, kid, what's your name?\" Nemo. I'm Nemo. Will you eat that? Be careful with that hammer. \"Grace.\" Sea-creature has my money. Wake up. Get up. \"Yes, I'm really blue.\" Wake up! Wow. Dusty. The mask. Where's the mask? No! The mask! Get it! It keeps going. Echo! \"What are you doing?\" I lost the mask. \"Did you drop it?\" You dropped it! Adam was far from home with a fish that could not remember her own name. \"How hard this is,\" Adam said. Adam's child was out there. \"My child Nemo is out there. No fish in this ocean will help me,\" Adam said sadly. But the fish helped Adam. \"I am helping you,\" said the fish. \"Wait right here.\" The fish asked the other fish, \"Do you know the way to SY city?\" \"Yes, follow the big sea path to get there,\" said the fish. \"That is great!\" Adam said. \"Zoe, you did it.\" \"I am just your little helper,\" Zoe said. The fish told Adam, \"When you come to a big ditch, swim through it, not over it.\" Adam said, \"I will remember. Let's go swim now.\" But Adam did not want to swim through the ditch. He wanted to swim over it. \"Look at this big ditch,\" Adam said. \"It is very dangerous.\" \"I think we should swim across.\" \"I do not want to talk about this anymore.\" \"Let us move on.\" \"Come with me.\" \"You should trust me.\" \"Trust you?\" \"Yes.\" \"Trust is what good friends do.\" \"Something shiny!\" \"Where?\" \"It just swam over that deep place.\" \"Come on.\" \"Okay.\" \"\"Look, it is so clear here.\" \"Exactly.\" \"And look at that.\" \"There is the strong water flow. We should reach the place soon.\" \"Hello, little creature.\" \"You wanted to go through that deep place.\" I shall call you Squishy and you will be mine. Come here, Squishy. Come here, little Squishy.\" Dory, that is a jellyfish. Bad Squishy. Go away.\" Let me see. Do not touch it. I will not touch it. I just want to look. Why did it not hurt you? It did hurt. Stay still. I live in this plant home and I am used to these hurts. Come here. You will be fine. But now we know that we should not touch these again. Let us be happy it was just a small one. Do not move. This is bad, Dory.\nThis is bad, Dory. This is bad, Dory. You cannot catch me. Do not bounce on the tops. They will not hurt you. The tops do not hurt you. Two times in a row. Beat that. Listen to me. I have an idea. A game. A game? I love games. Choose me. Here is the game. Whoever can hop the fastest out of these jellyfish wins. Okay! Rules. Do not touch the long parts. Only the tops. Something about long parts. Got it. Get ready. Go! Wait! Go faster if you want to win.\nWait a minute. So, we are avoiding danger now. We are having fun at the same time. I can do this. Just be careful. Careful I do not make you cry when I win. I do not think so. Give up. You cannot beat how you were created. I was made for moving fast. The question is, are you hungry? Hungry? Yes. \"Hey! You are going to eat my bubbles!\" \"Move left, then back, and over here!\" \"The little fish won.\" \"We did it!\" \"Look at us!\" \"Oh, no.\" \"Am I out?\" \"You are doing good.\" \"You are winning.\" \"You must stay awake.\" \"Where does P live?\" \"P, Way Street, SY city.\" \"That's it!\" \"Stay awake.\" \"Awake.\" \"P... 42 Way Street...\" \"Wake up.\" \"SY.\" \"Nemo...\" \"You miss your dad, don't you, Little Fish?\" \"Yeah.\" \"You miss your dad, don't you, Little Fish?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Well, you are lucky to have someone out there looking for you.\" \"He's not looking for me.\" \"He's scared of the ocean.\" \"Mom? Any movement?\" \"He drank four cups of coffee. It has to be soon. Keep watching him.\" \"My first try to get out, I landed on dental tools. I was aiming for the toilet.\" \"The toilet? All drains lead to the ocean, child.\" Wow. How many times have you tried to get out? I lost count. Fish aren't meant to be in a box, child. It does things to you.\" \"The bubbles! Bathroom break!\" He just grabbed the book. We have 4.2 minutes. That's your signal. You can do it, child. We have to be quick. Once you get in, swim to the bottom.\" \"Once you get in, swim to the bottom.\" \"Once you get in, swim to the bottom. I'll help you through the rest.\" Okay. Go on. It'll be easy. Nicely done. Can you hear me? Yeah. Here comes the pebble. Now, do you see a small opening? Inside it, you'll see a spinning fan. Very carefully, wedge that pebble into the fan to stop it spinning. Careful, Little Fish. I can't do it. This isn't a good idea. He'll be fine. Try again! Okay. That's it, Little Fish. Nice and steady. I got it, I got it! He did it. That's great, child. Now swim up the tube and out. Oh, no! \"Help!\" \"Get him out!\" \"Help him!\" \"What do we do?\" \"Stay calm, child.\" \"Don't panic.\" \"Help me!\" \"Grab this.\" \"No!\" \"That's it.\" \"Come on, grab it.\" \"I got it.\" \"Pull!\" \"Don't make him go back in there.\" \"No.\" \"We're done.\" \"Dude?\" \"Focus, dude.\" \"Dude?\" \"He lives.\" \"Hey, dude.\" \"What happened?\" \"I saw it all, dude. First you were like, whoa! And then we were like, whoa! Then you were like, whoa...\" What are you talking about? You, little one! Taking on the jellies. You have serious fun issues, dude. Awesome. Oh, my stomach. No throwing up on the shell. I just cleaned it. So, Mr Animal... Dude, Mr Animal is my father. Name's Crush. Crush? Really? Okay, Crush. Listen, I need to get to the East sea. East sea? Dude... You're riding it, dude. Check it out. Okay, grab shell, dude. Grab what? Grab what? Grab what? Awesome! So... what brings you here today to the East sea? Well, Nora and I need to get to SY city. Nora! Is she okay? Oh, little blue. She is underwater, dude. I'm so sorry. This is all my fault. It's my fault. 29, 30! Ready or not here I come! There you are. Catch me if you can. Up you go. Up you go. Up you go. Oh, my goodness. Stop the motor, dude. Let us see what Child does flying alone. That was so cool. Hey, Father. Did you see that? Did you see me? Did you see what I did? You so totally rock, Child. Give me some fin. Head. Dude. Intro. Jellyman, Offspring. Offspring, Jellyman. Jellies? Sweet. \"Look, it is swimming away.\" \"Come back here.\" \"You have upset it.\" \"Maybe a different way of speaking.\" \"This is not a whale.\" \"You are speaking like you have an upset stomach.\" \"Maybe I should try a different way of speaking.\" \"No, do not try that.\" \"You sound sick.\" \"Maybe speak louder?\" \"Do not do that.\" \"Too much of that way of speaking.\" \"Did that sound a little like that way of speaking?\" \"It does not sound like anything I have ever heard.\" \"Just as well.\" \"It might be hungry.\" \"Whales do not eat small fish.\" \"They eat tiny creatures.\" \"Swim away!\" \"Look!\" Tiny creatures. Move away quickly!\" Move away quickly!\" Move away quickly!\" Look at that. Would you look at that? Dirty. Very dirty. And it is all thanks to you, small one. You made it possible. Friend, I said no cleaning. I am ashamed. Look. Dirty creature. Bubbles! I love the bubbles. Friend? Has anybody seen Friend? 9.00, and time for dentist. Friend. Sorry I am late. Okay. Here we go. Young Child. Walks to the counter, drops the keys...\" That is disgusting. It tastes pretty good to me. Do you not realize we are swimming in our own...\" Here it comes. What the...? Oh no. What a state. Friend, what is my earliest time tomorrow? 10.00, dear. Leave it open. I have to clean the fish home before Child gets here. You hear that, Fish? Yay! It is going to clean the home! Yes, we will be clean! Ready to see your father? Yes. Of course you are. I would not be surprised if it is out there waiting for you right now. I would not be surprised if it is out there waiting for you right now. Yes. Here comes a big one. Come on. You have to try this. Will you just stop it? Why? What is wrong? We are in a whale. Do you not get it? A whale? A whale. Because you had to ask for help. And now we are stuck here. A whale? You know, I speak whale. You are insane. The sun was bright, the tank was clean and we were leaving...\" \"The tank is clean.\" \"But how?\" \"Adam must have put it in while we were sleeping.\" \"What will we do?\" \"What does it say?\" \"I can't hear you, Emma.\" \"The Aquascum 2003 is a machine that cleans salt water and helps fish live longer in the tank.\" \"Stop it!\" \"The Aquascum looks at your tank every few minutes?\" \"Look?\" \"What does that mean?\" \"Temperature is good, water is normal.\" \"Nice.\" \"I don't like Aquascum.\" \"We can't leave now.\" \"Then what will we do...\" \"Grace!\" \"Stay down, kid.\" \"False alarm.\" \"I'm nervous.\" \"What will we do when that child comes?\" \"I'm thinking.\" \"Help!\" \"Help me!\" \"Hold on. I'm coming.\" \"Swim down!\" \"Come on, kid.\" Everybody jump in.\" \"What...? Good work.\" \"Henry!\" \"Nora!\" \"Roll, kid! Lean, kid! Roll!\" \"Go to the window.\" That would have been a bad fall. \"I don't want to be on my back!\" \"Calm down, Nora. You won't be on your back. I promise. You'll be okay.\" \"Grace! Do any of these boats look like you've seen before?\" \"No, but the boat has to be here. We'll find it.\" \"I'm so excited.\" \"Are you excited?\" \"Fiona, wake up. Come on. Duck! That's not a duck. It's a...big bird! No! I didn't come all this way to be food. Hey, big bird. Would you look at that? What? The sun is barely up and Matthew has more than he can have. Yeah. I think someone should help the poor guy. Well, don't all fly away! Okay, Matthew. What is it? Fish got your mouth?\" I love ducks! Love ducks! Love ducks! I have to find my child Nora.

{"text": "\"One day, a man was playing sports with his friends. 'Go deep!' said Adam. 'Pass the ball!' said Benjamin. Suddenly, Cameron fell down. 'Oh no!' cried David. There was blood coming from Cameron's chest. \n\nThe police came quickly. 'He was stabbed with a knife,' said Ethan, the police officer. 'He died very fast, around early morning.' Frank pointed to where Cameron fell. 'Someone pushed him under that car.' Gabriel found a book called 'a famous play' and an expensive cigar under the car. \n\n'This cigar is from the FR country,' said Henry. The police checked and found that the car belonged to a man named Isaac. But Isaac was not the man who died. 'We need to go to Isaac's home, the NE city,' said Jack. The police went to Isaac's home to find out what happened.\" \"I got a cold.\" \"That's not allowed?\" \"We found a body under your car, Mr. Patrick.\" \"Body?\" \"What kind of body?\" \"The dead kind.\" \"It's NE city.\" \"They find bodies in many places.\" \"Don't you read the news?\" \"No, we don't have to.\" \"We just wanted to tell you.\" \"Yeah, thanks.\" \"What for?\" \"We took your vehicle.\" \"Oh, come on.\" \"You can't do that!\" \"I need to work!\" \"Look, we'll give it back to you, maybe tomorrow at the latest and with your little cold, it shouldn't be a problem, right?\" \"Man, this is bad.\" \"Just to check, you know this guy?\" \"No.\" \"ED: \"I worked as a driver for someone else when I was in school, Mr. Patrick. You know, lending your license to someone else could get you fired, but that'll be the least of your problems if you do know this guy and you lie about it.\" \"It's Jack. He's a nice guy. I met him in a support group a couple years ago.\" \"Sorry, friend. Another job gone.\" Well, how often did Jack drive the car?\" \"Every Wednesday while Mr. Patrick was at the support group meeting.\" \"We're asking around to see if anyone is spending more money than usual. But you know the chances of a random killing.\" \"Only it might not be random.\" \"Tests showed Jack's prints at a place that burned down years ago.\" Let me guess. \"They showed up in a famous event.\" No, in a church in a small town. One that burned down five years ago. Only, those prints belonged to someone named Bobby, a bad person. A preacher's two kids died in that fire. \"Stop.\" So what, Bobby ran away? \"No. He was not found guilty and he lived well until tests noticed he was doing bad things. That's when he left.\" \"Maybe I'm not so upset he's dead.\" Well, how close are the prints? ED: \"Four-point match. That's not very sure.\" I'll call that small town and you two see if there's anything else to prove that Jack and Bobby are the same person. If this guy was Bobby, he must have left his bad ways behind. Adam said, \"That plant I smoked last night was bad.\" \nBenjamin laughed and said, \"You knew that, didn't you?\"\n\"Whatever I did, wasn't enough,\" said Adam. \"Whoever I hurt really deserved it.\"\n\"You don't remember?\" asked Benjamin.\nAdam said, \"I met my muse last night, Detective. She looked like a bottle of a grownup drink.\"\n\"Oh, yeah?\" said Benjamin. \"Where was she?\"\n\"At Helen's place that serves food and drinks,\" said Adam.\nBenjamin said, \"The place for people who drink too much.\"\n\"You seem mad about something,\" said Adam. \"Is it because a body was found?\"\n\"Yes, and I can make it better how?\" asked Benjamin.\nBenjamin said, \"A driver was hurt with a knife. A famous drama book was beside the body. Do you have bad memories about this, Adam?\"\nAdam said, \"I'm sad when someone who reads books dies.\"\nBenjamin said, \"Let's be honest. You bought the book. And a special pen was also there. You like knives too, so it seems you did it.\"\n\"This will take time,\" said Adam. \"I'm drinking a grownup drink. Want one?\"\n\"No thanks,\" said Benjamin. \"I stopped drinking years ago. But I'll have one with you, since you're a famous writer.\"\n\"You don't know him well,\" said a friend. \"He tries to be like the stories in his books.\"\nThe friend said, \"Adam and Nora were arguing. Adam threw his spoon and it hit a wall. Soup got on Nora. But in the police report, it's different.\"\nThe friend said, \"Adam will say he threw a knife that hurt Nora. In time, he'll say he cut off her head with a sword. Writers make up stories for a living.\" \"So, he was here last night?\" \"Until early in the morning.\" \"Have you ever hurt someone, Detective?\" \"Have you?\" \"I will answer if you answer.\" \"You answer my question, I will answer yours.\" \"I have had to use my weapon before.\" \"Yes, unfortunately.\" \"Why unfortunately?\" \"Was it a fair shooting?\" \"That is not the point.\" \"(SCOFFS) \"Feeling bad is for children and religious people.\" \"Let me see your weapon.\" \"The rules say no.\" \"(SCOFFS) \"The rules would get you in trouble for sharing a drink with a suspect.\" \"Okay.\" \"I could use a break.\" \"Go ahead.\" \"It is lighter than a big weapon, the kind given in the war.\" \"You were a soldier?\" \"We walked through so much mud, we had to put our weapons in our pants to keep them clean.\" \"They say the first time is hardest.\" \"The first time is hard because it is the first. First step. First word. First woman. First hurting someone.\" \"Do you know the difference between hurting and killing someone, Detective?\" \"Mmm-hmm.\" \"Many years in prison.\" \"Being close.\" \"If you use a knife it becomes personal. A person's blood gets on your hands warm, wet. Sometimes they scream.\" \"Not as often as you think.\" \"So, Nathan did not help you clean up?\" \"That will never happen. No, he was drinking his special drink. A strong drink. He said a famous writer gave it to him. The silly man drank the whole bottle.\" \"Yeah, I understand.\" \"So, anyone else at this party besides you and Nathan?\" \"His friend Kevin was here for a while. Kevin?\" \"Warner. He wrote one book, he thinks he is a great writer. Teaches writing at the city school.\" \"This strong drink they were drinking...\" \"A strong drink. Very expensive, if you can get it.\" \"Is that the kind with a dead bug in the bottom?\" \"Yes. And Nathan drank it straight from the bottle. That's when I put him in a car.\" \"Around early morning?\" \"That's right.\" \"You know, I have never seen an expensive drink before.\" \"It should be in the trash outside. You can take it.\" \"Yes, I can get DNA from a bottle neck.\" \"Sure I can.\" \"Maybe.\" \"Unless the liquid made the material in the bottle unrecognizable or...\" \"You say it was in the trash?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Smell it.\" \"That's not my scent.\" \"It could make the DNA unrecognizable.\" \"Assuming it's even there.\" \"Wow!\" \"I'm glad I stayed late.\" \"(LAUGHS) \"Who needs fun, huh?\" \"Who would you say was the most hated man at the front?\" \"The leader.\" \"No.\" \"A shooter.\" \"Sitting alone, up high. No art in that kind of action. Just tools. Now it takes a certain kind of man to do the deed, up close.\" And you're that kind of man? Just doing my job. Cleaning up the mess. Man-to-man? Did the best man win? I'm sitting here and sharing my drink and my thoughts, am I not? What about you? Do you have what it takes? Can you perform well under pressure? Play the ultimate game? I don't think of it as a game. Of course it is! Winners live. Losers die. It's all a game. A famous drama. That sounds like something you'd like. I gave it to a friend. Where did this driver of yours take it? In the body. Good. A body hit is the best hit. If the spot is selected correctly, it slips in easily bypassing bone. They could change the path making a quick end less likely. The prey feels a hard blow. Not until the blood flows does the man realize he's dead. You did it. You killed him. Did I? Five hours? I hope he called you in the early morning. Hey, the best way to get someone to open up is to let them drink. Isn't that right? Did you at least read him his rights? It was just two guys talking. Yeah, until a helper gets involved. Adam and Benjamin were police officers. One day, they talked to Cameron about a bad thing that happened. \n\nAdam said, \"We need to find out who did the bad thing.\"\n\nBenjamin said, \"Cameron told us about the bad thing like he saw it happen.\"\n\nAdam said, \"We have evidence from a bottle that might show who did the bad thing.\"\n\nBenjamin said, \"That's good. We can wait to hear more.\"\n\nAdam said, \"But the owner of a place said Cameron was with someone named David.\"\n\nBenjamin said, \"Maybe David can tell us what happened.\"\n\nAdam said, \"Cameron makes up stories sometimes.\"\n\nBenjamin said, \"Yes, but I don't think Cameron would do a bad thing. He just likes to talk.\"\n\nThey asked Cameron what time he left a place called Helen's. Cameron said he left early in the morning. Adam and Benjamin decided Cameron could not have done the bad thing at that time.\n\nThen Benjamin got a message on his phone about the bad thing. \"Maybe I like a big group of people, too.\" \"First, Nathan.\" \"Now, Cameron.\" \"What do you want to do?\" \"Take away all the famous books?\" \"Cameron only sold a few hundred books.\" \"You need to look between the lines, officer.\" \"Well, you saw that drama book.\" \"It looked brand new.\" \"It was just made.\" \"Yeah, but that's not a good reason.\" \"Hey, if two people pass a book back and forth, they're sure to bend some pages.\" \"Your book report is due soon.\" \"I lost mine.\" \"Listen to this.\" \"\"The chest area\" \"\"is just behind the third button from the top.\" \"\"If a knife goes there, you'll die for sure.\"\"\n\"You can learn bad things in jail.\" Well, you can get to FR city in about an hour. Find out if Cameron writes about what he knows. \nWARDEN: I'm glad he's gone. What, with Nathan writing letters to the newspaper taking out ads in big books. You'd think we had a very famous person locked up here.\nOFFICER: The power of words.\nWell, the power of a good lawyer. Nathan hired a lawyer who made many appeals. I think those judges just got tired of listening to him.\nDid they let Cameron out early?\nHe stayed six of ten years. So, he was a good prisoner?\n(LAUGHS) \"Good prisoner.\" That's like a big small thing.\nHe mostly kept to himself. Especially after the bad thing.\nWhat bad thing was that?\nThree guys went into the laundry room. Two came out. The third one got hurt in the chest.\nAnd Cameron?\nOh, he was there, all right. Some of that blood was his.\nWhy would the appeals court let him go after that?\nWell, knowing and proving are two different things. Especially with Nathan yelling about keeping a smart person in jail.\nYou still have the blood tests?\nSure, I'll get it for you, too. \nCameron's DNA was on the smoke. His prints were on the book. They were both found at the scene. The guy in jail was killed the same way as the other person. Which Cameron describes perfectly in his book. \"A reason would be nice.\" \"Well, money's as good as any.\" \"Cameron's cash was missing.\" \"This guy's been feeding us volumes of lies from the get-go.\" \"Pick him up.\" \"THOMAS:\" \"I have a question.\" \"Did she...\" \"We're discussing a famous drama.\" \"Join us.\" \"You ought to read a famous novel.\" \"Cameron, you're under arrest for the murder of Ryan.\" \"Don't you love when art imitates life?\" \"You have the right to remain silent.\" \"Anything you say can be used against you in a court.\" \"You have the right to an attorney...\" \"\"Case number 4-7-3-6-8-9.\" \"\"People of the NE state v. Cameron.\"\" \"Charges are, \"Serious crime, Less serious crime,\" \"\"Another crime.\"\" \"All for one dead person?\" \"The crime was committed during the commission of a robbery, Your Honor. That makes it a serious crime. Cameron. Are you the fellow that wrote that book? I am. I started it. Hmm. How do you plead? Not guilty on all counts. JUDGE: People on bail? A large amount of money. The defendant is tied to the crime with both evidence and more evidence. Both of which are irrelevant as far as risk of running away. He's a repeat offender, Your Honor. A minor issue and he didn't run away the first time. But old dogs do learn new tricks. Bail is set at a large amount of money. Uh, Judge... I'm sorry, professor but nothing says, \"I'll be back\" like cash. Next! (SOUND) (WHISPERING) \"Utter genius.\" \"It shocks the reader into redefining his life experience.\" \"One part famous author, one part another famous author.\" I'm impressed, Mr. Cameron. Perhaps this will increase sales. Alright, Jack, I can play silly with you. If that's what you want. This is your meeting, Ira What do you want? World peace. The team should win. But I'll settle for Cameron being free to write more books. I'll send him all the things he needs. See, you're starting up again with the whole silly thing and... Evidence puts him at the scene. Adam said, \"It would be easier, not more fair.\"\nDavid said, \"It's good, Adam.\"\nMatthew said, \"Henry can write.\"\nAdam said, \"You want the easy answer?\"\nDavid said, \"Just words on a page.\"  \nAdam said, \"And the more difficult one?\"\nDavid said, \"So are these.\"\nAdam said, \"The death penalty is the most severe punishment the law allows.\"\nAdam said, \"I got to admit, it's disconcerting that Henry thinks it's less severe than going to prison.\"\nMatthew said, \"You show the bad person, keep him alive.\"\nAdam said, \"If you do that, the best way for any future person to avoid the death penalty is gonna be to ask to die.\"\nMatthew said, \"What gets you angry is that in the past, you've always had the backstop of mandatory appeals.\"\nMatthew said, \"You were just a part of the system.\"\nMatthew said, \"You could always rationalize it to yourself by placing the ultimate responsibility on someone else's shoulders.\"\nMatthew said, \"Now, if Henry dies, it's because I wanted him dead.\"\nDavid said, \"It's not you, Adam. It's the law.\"\nDavid said, \"Words on a page?\"\nThe judge said, \"I have listened carefully to the testimony of the doctors for both sides, to the character witnesses and finally, to the person himself.\"\nThe judge said, \"Which in the final analysis deserves the most weight.\"\nThe judge said, \"First, I have determined that the agreement was reached in good faith and without coercion of any sort.\"\nThe judge said, \"Second, I find that there was not enough evidence offered to establish that the person suffers from a mental disorder or defect.\"\nThe judge said, \"My final decision, therefore, is that Henry shall be executed pursuant to the laws of this state and in accordance with the agreement reached between the parties to this matter.\"", "hash": "0c3c0f69d421bfaa5272c01e1d7ea20d0513a3b27247a6e0cb59243c5f6c388c"}
{"text": "\"Can you see this picture well?\" \"Or do you want me to lower it?\" \"Good.\" \"Okay.\" \"Early this evening...\" \"Let me ask the TV first.\" \"Are you ready?\" \"All set?\" \"Let me hear how you speak, so it's the same volume.\" \"How is my voice level?\" \"That's fine.\" \"Great.\" \"Now, I remember exactly the words I said before I was stopped. I remember how it started, and I was cut off in the middle. You can fix it up. I don't want to go back, because I know exactly what I wanted to say.\" \"Go ahead!\" \"Okay.\" \"Any military leader who is honest will admit that they have made mistakes in using military power. They have killed people, unnecessarily. Their own troops or other troops. Through mistakes, through errors. A hundred, or thousands, or tens of thousands, maybe even 100,000. But they haven't destroyed nations. And the common wisdom is don't make the same mistake twice. Learn from your mistakes. And we all do. Maybe we make the same mistake three times but hopefully not four or five. There'll be no learning period with powerful weapons. Make one mistake and you're gonna destroy nations. In my life, I've been part of wars. Three years in the army during a big war. Seven years as an important leader during another war. Thirteen years at an important organization across the world. At my age, I'm old enough to look back and learn from my actions. My rule has been, \"try to learn.\" Try to understand what happened. Develop the lessons and pass them on. This is an important leader of the country. His department uses a lot of the country's money. His job has been called the toughest and he is the most talked-about person that has ever held the job. Some people call him good things and some call him bad things. Mr. Leader, I've noticed in several offices that little silver calendar thing there. Can you explain that? Yes, this was given by the country's former leader. ...the dates when we looked into a very dangerous situation. Under lies the enemy brought powerful weapons targeting many of our people. \"And some people were saying we should attack,\" said Adam. \"This is what Gabriel said:\" \"\"We should not make things worse. The more we fight, the worse it will get. If we keep fighting, people will die everywhere. That is what war does. If people are not wise, bad things will happen.\"\"\n\n\"I want to say something important,\" said Adam. \"We were lucky that war did not happen. It was very close. Adam and Gabriel were wise. But it was still very close to destroying everything. The lesson is: If people have weapons that can destroy everything, bad things can still happen. Is it right that today there are many weapons that one person can use?\"  \n\n\"I learned later that there were many weapons on the IS island at that time,\" said Adam. \"I could not believe it at first. Gabriel became angry with me because I did not understand.\"\n\nGabriel said, \"I knew the weapons were there. I would not have used them. But if we were attacked, we would have used them. And then the IS island would have been destroyed.\"\n\n\"That is how close it was,\" said Adam. \"And Gabriel was willing to accept that?\"\n\nGabriel said, \"If you were in that situation, you would have done the same thing.\" Gabriel was a smart child. He worked very hard to get the best grade in class. His classmates were also very smart. They came from different places and learned their own language and culture. Every Monday, they tried hard to beat Gabriel. But Gabriel often got the best grade. \n\nOne day, a teacher asked Gabriel, \"Have you ever been wrong?\" Gabriel said, \"Of course, I have been wrong many times. I can't tell you when, but I was wrong countless times.\" \n\nWhen Gabriel was young, life was hard. Many people had no jobs. Gabriel could not afford a good school. He went to a local school and paid little money. Gabriel worked very hard and got good grades. Only a few students got the best grades. Gabriel was one of them. Life was difficult at that time, but Gabriel never gave up. Adam never heard of the philosophers before he became a student at BE university. \"And Adam remembered the teacher, Mr. Liam the new philosophy teacher...\" \"Adam could not wait to go to another class.\" \"Adam took more philosophy classes, one about logic and one about right and wrong.\" \"Learning about values beyond yourself and helping society.\" After finishing BE university, Adam went to HG business school for two years and then went back to SF city. Adam started dating a lady he met when they were both 17 at BE university: Charlotte Craig. After some months, Adam proposed and Charlotte accepted. Charlotte went on a trip across the FR country with her aunt and mother. She sent a message, \"Need to order invitations and need your middle name.\" Adam replied, \"My middle name is Strange.\" Charlotte asked again, \"What is your middle name?\" Adam's middle name really was Strange. Adam and Charlotte had a happy marriage. Soon they had their first child. The hospital costs were a small amount they paid monthly. Those were very happy times. Then there was a war. Adam was promoted to assistant teacher. Adam was the youngest teacher at HG. His salary was a small amount. The HG business school had no students because the males were joining the military. The school leader made a plan to train soldiers to analyze data for the air force. They said, \"We will choose the best soldiers.\" They used data cards with details about each soldier. They chose the smartest and most capable soldiers. The UR country was starting to bomb. They bombed during the day and lost many planes. A study found 20 percent of the planes heading to bomb GE city turned around before reaching the target. They lost 20 percent of their planes. \"It was called Form 1-A or something like that. It was a report,\" said Adam. \"If you stopped a task, you had to write why.\"\n\n\"We looked at those reports and found out the truth,\" said Benjamin. \"They stopped tasks because they were afraid. Many would die if they kept going.\"\n\n\"The loss rate was high. The task list was long. They knew many would not come back, so they found reasons to stop.\"\n\n\"We told a leader named Cameron. He was a commander of a group. He was the best leader I knew in the war. But he was very tough and mean to some.\"\n\n\"Cameron gave an order. He said, 'I will be first on every task. Any who start must finish, or face big trouble.'\"\n\n\"After that, not many stopped their tasks.\"\n\nThe leader spoke to some children, \"On this day, many are in our forces. Last year, many served far away. By next summer, even more will serve far away. Bad times are coming for our enemies soon.\"\n\nAdam's group had a new plane that could fly very high. The old planes flew lower and got hit by guns and other planes.\n\nAdam was sent to fly the new planes. They had to fly the planes from one city to a far away country. Then they had to fly fuel over the big hills to another country.\n\nThe runways were built by people from that country. \"I remember them making the runways flat. If someone fell, they would just laugh and keep going.\"\n\nThey were supposed to fill the planes with fuel, fly to that country, drop the fuel, fly back, do that many times to have enough fuel in that country, then fly to an enemy country, drop bombs, and fly back.\n\n\"We were not trained well to do this. Sometimes, to get planes back, we had to put more fuel in instead of taking it out.\" Early one morning, a child woke up. \"What happened?\" the child asked. The parent replied, \"Let me tell you a short story. There was a war long ago. Some soldiers planned to attack an enemy city.\"\n\n\"One soldier named Adam wanted to win the war quickly. Adam ordered the planes to fly low and drop fire bombs on the enemy city. This burned many houses and hurt many people.\"  \n\nAfter the attack, the soldiers met to discuss what happened. A young soldier named Benjamin was upset. \"I wanted to use my plane properly from high up,\" said Benjamin. \"But we had to fly low, and my friend was killed.\"\n\nAdam did not say much. Adam only said short words like \"Yes\" or \"No.\" Adam did not listen to anyone's complaints. Adam just asked, \"Why are we here?\"\n\nThe child looked confused. The parent said, \"War is terrible and hurts many people. We should find better ways to resolve conflicts peacefully.\" \"We put soft coverings on the car parts, and we put seat belts.\" \"We thought if everyone used the seat belts, we could save over 20 thousand lives each year.\" \"But nobody liked it.\" \"People did not want to use seat belts.\" \"But the people who used them saved their lives.\" \"Now, let me talk about another time.\" \"It was the early morning hours in the late 20th century.\" \"Cameron, a leader at his company, wanted to become the boss. \"I am in charge of all the car groups.\" \"Henry liked to stay up late. He always wanted to go out late at night. He said, \"Come up, have a late night drink.\" \"I do not want one, I am going to bed.\" Cameron said, \"I will come up, Henry.\" \"I did not ask you. I asked David.\" \"He said, \"David, come up.\" So I finally went up.\" That is when he asked me to be the boss. I was the first boss ever who was not part of the family that owned the company. And after a few weeks, I quit.\n\nThe phone rang and a person said: \"I am Quentin. My brother, Jack, would like you to meet our brother-in-law, Frank.\" In the afternoon, Frank came in. I had never met him before. And he said, \"I was told by my brother-in-law Jack to offer you the job of money boss.\" \"That is silly. I know a little about money but I am not qualified for that job.\" \"If you do not want that job, the soon-to-be leader told me to offer you the job of defense boss.\" \"I was in the big war for three years but defense boss? I am not qualified for that.\" He said, \"Would you at least agree to meet with him?\" So I go home. I talk to Emma. If I could choose all the top officials and if I did not have to go to social events, she said, \"Okay, why don't you make an agreement with the leader and if he agrees to those rules, do it.\" I had around 800 thousand dollars at that time but I also had the chance to get millions more from my job. And I was one of the highest paid leaders in the world. And the future looked very good. Now, our country wins the fights that it starts. Do not make a mistake about it. And we have declared war on bad people and bad actions. If this little place goes down and can't stay free, ask yourself what's going to happen to all the other little places. Let me go back one moment. In a past conflict, at the end I think we did try to understand the other side. In another case, we didn't know them well enough to understand. And there was a total misunderstanding as a result. They believed we had simply replaced another group and we were seeking to control them, which was completely wrong. And we saw it as part of a larger struggle. Not what they saw it as, a fight within their own place. There aren't many examples in which you bring two former enemies together at the highest levels, and discuss what might have been. I formed the thought that each of us could have achieved our goals without the terrible loss of life. And I wanted to test that by going to that place. The former leader of that place, a wonderful man named Thomas, said, \"You're totally wrong. We were fighting for freedom. You were fighting to control us.\" We almost came to blows. That was early in the day on the first day. \"Do you mean to say it was not a tragedy for you when you lost many people killed which on our population is the same as many Americans? What did you accomplish? You didn't get more than we were willing to give at the start. You could've had everything: Freedom, unity.\" \"Mr. Thomas, you must never have read a book. If you had, you'd know we weren't controlled by others. Didn't you know that? Don't you understand that we've been fighting others for a long time? We were fighting for freedom, and we'd fight to the last person. We were determined to and no amount of pressure would've ever stopped us.\" What makes us all-knowing? Have we a record of being all-knowing? We are the strongest place in the world today. I do not believe we should ever use that power alone. If we had followed that rule, we wouldn't have been there. None of our friends supported us. If we can't persuade places with similar values of the merit of our cause, we'd better re-examine our thinking. Many people suffered badly last week. Adam was a leader in a big country. He helped in a major war. Adam said, \"War is cruel. War is cruelty.\" He wanted to save his country. He was willing to do anything needed. It was hard for kind people like Adam. \n\nMany people did not like the war. 50,000 people came to protest it. About 20,000 went to a big building. The building was hard to protect. Soldiers with guns stood around it. But Adam said guns could not be used without his okay. He did not give okay.\n\nThe protests did not change Adam's thinking. It was a tense time for Adam's family. Adam was in a Cold War. It was a Cold War event. A general said the war was going well. Military operations made good progress.  \n\nAdam learned some lessons. Never say never. And never answer the question asked. Answer the question you wish was asked instead. Adam followed this rule.\n\nThe leader has duty for a war. But Adam did not want to blame another leader alone. He thought if that leader lived, things may have been better. There would not have been so many soldiers there.\n\nThere are two photos. In one, Adam looks worried, thinking \"I'm in a mess. This person wants me to do wrong things. But I won't do it.\" \"And I would rather be sad if I don't,\" Adam said. Early in the morning, in a city, Adam spoke those words.", "hash": "e3df76b994f1b802827a1fc9cbd8cb47f18e55c4b658ea4c47bc316f7883b225"}
{"text": "Adam and Emma went to a new home. It was very big and nice. Adam liked it a lot. But Emma thought it might be too big for them.\n\n\"We don't need so much space,\" said Emma. \"This home is for our kids,\" said Adam. \"They will see whales outside their window!\"\n\nEmma smiled. \"Don't wake the kids,\" she said. They had many eggs to hatch. \"We need to name them,\" said Adam. \"Let's name one Nemo,\" said Emma. Soon they would have many little children.\n\n\"What if they don't like me?\" asked Adam. Emma laughed. \"At least one will like you,\" she said. \"Remember how we met?\"\n\nAdam did not want to remember. But Emma told the story again. \"You asked me to check for a hook in your lip,\" she said. Adam had come very close because it was wiggling. Emma had been scared at first, but now they were happy together. \"Where did everybody go?\" \"Emma, get inside the house.\" \"No, Emma, don't.\" \"They'll be fine.\" \"Just get inside...\" \"You, right now.\" \"No!\" \"Ow!\" \"Emma!\" \"Emma?\" Emma?\" Emma?\" Emma?\" Emma?\" Emma?\" Emma?\" Emma?\" There, there, there.\" It's OK. Papa's here. Papa's got you. I promise, I will never let anything happen to you...\" Nora. First day of school! Wake up, wake up! First day of school. I don't want to go to school... five more minutes. Not you, Papa, me. OK. Huh? Get up, get up. It's time for school, time for school. All right, I'm up. Nora! First day of school! Nora, don't move. Unh! Unh! You'll never get out of there yourself. I'll do it. Unh! You feel a break? No. Sometimes you can't tell 'cause fluid rushes to the area. Are you woozy? No. How many stripes do I have? I'm fine. Answer the stripe question. Three. No! See? Something's wrong with you. I have one, two, three... That's all I have? You're OK. How's the lucky fin? Lucky. Let's see. Are you sure you want to go to school this year? There's no problem if you don't. You can wait 5 or 6 years. Come on, Papa, it's time for school. Forgot to brush. Ohh. Do you want this flower to sting you? Yes. Brush. OK, I'm done. You missed a spot. Where? There. Where? There. Ha ha! Right there. And here and here. All right, we're excited. All right, we're excited. The first day of school. Here we go. We're ready to learn to get some knowledge. What's the one thing we have to remember about the ocean? It's not safe. That's my girl. First, we check to see that the coast is clear. We go out... and back in. A father and son were going to school. The son said, \"Maybe I'll see a big sea animal at school today.\" The father said, \"I doubt that.\" The son said a friend told him sea turtles live to be 100 years old. The father said, \"If you meet a sea turtle, you can ask how old it is. But first talk to the big sea animal, okay?\" On the way to school, the father told the son, \"Don't act scared like at the petting zoo. That small animal was not going to attack.\" At school, some other kids teased the son and took something from him. The father asked where to meet the teacher. Another father joked, \"You're a funny fish, tell us a joke.\" The father tried to explain that his kind of fish is not really funnier than others. But he got mixed up telling the joke. Then a loud voice yelled at one of the kids to get out of someone's yard. \"Where did you go?\" \"Parent, can I go play too?\" \"Can I?\" \"I would feel better if you'd play on the soft beds.\" \"That's where I would play.\" \"What's wrong with their fin?\" \"They look funny.\" \"Ow!\" \"Hey, what did I do?\" \"Be nice.\" \"It's their first time at school.\" \"They were born with it.\" \"We call it their lucky fin.\" \"Parent...\" \"See this tentacle? It's actually shorter than all my other tentacles... but you can't really tell.\" \"Especially when I twirl them like this.\" \"I'm water intolerant.\" \"Ah-choo!\" \"I'm loud.\"\n\n\"Let's name the areas, the areas, the areas. Let's name the areas of the open sea.\"\n\"Teacher!\" \"Come on, Nemo.\" \"You better stay with me.\"\n\"Deep, very deep, too deep for you and me to see.\"\n\"Huh. I wonder where my class has gone?\"\n\"We're under here!\"\n\"Oh, there you are. Climb aboard, explorers.\"\n\"Oh, learning exploring is so fun. When you think thoughts that are true.\"\n\"Parent, you can go now.\" \"Hello. Who is this?\"\n\"I'm Nemo.\"\n\"Nemo, all new explorers must answer a science question. What kind of home do you live in?\"\n\"A home-none. A name-name.\"\n\"OK, don't hurt yourself. Welcome aboard, explorers. Just so you know, they have a little fin. If they are having trouble swimming, I let them take a break for some time.\"\n\"Parent, it's time for you to go now. Don't worry. We're gonna stay together as a group.\"\n\"OK, class, eyes up front. And remember, we keep our special part to ourselves. That means you, Jimmy.\"\n\n\"Bye, Nemo!\"\n\"Bye, Parent!\"\n\"Bye, child! Be safe.\"\n\"You're doing pretty well for a first-timer. You can't hold on to them forever, can you? I had a tough time with my oldest out at the deep area. They got to grow up...\"\n\"The deep area?\" Alice said, \"You cannot swim well.\" Benjamin said, \"I can swim good, Father, OK?\" Alice said, \"No, it's not OK. You should not be near here.\" Benjamin said, \"OK, I was right. You will start school in a year or two.\" Alice said, \"No, Benjamin! Just because you're scared of the water...\" \"Clearly, you're not ready...\" Alice said, \"Clearly, you're not ready... and you're not coming back until you are.\" Alice said, \"You think you can do these things... but you just can't, Benjamin!\" Benjamin said, \"I hate you.\" \n\nA grown-up said, \"There's nothing to see. Gather over there.\" The grown-up said, \"Excuse me. Is there anything I can do? I am a scientist, ma'am.\" Alice said, \"He isn't a good swimmer, and it's a little too soon for him to be out here alone.\" The scientist said, \"I can assure you, he's quite safe with me.\" Alice said, \"I'm sure he is, but you have a large class and he can get lost from sight if you're not looking. I'm not saying you're not looking.\"\n\nAlice said, \"Oh, my gosh! Benjamin is swimming out to sea! Benjamin! What do you think you're doing? You will get stuck out there and I will have to get you before another fish does. Get back here! I said get back here now! Stop! You take one more move, mister... Don't you dare! If you put one fin on that boat... Are you listening to me? Don't touch the bo...\" Benjamin touched the boat. \n\nAlice said, \"You paddle your little tail right back here, Benjamin. That's right. You are in big trouble, young man. Do you hear me? Big... Big...\" Benjamin said, \"Daddy! Help me!\" Alice said, \"I'm coming, Benjamin! Get under me, kids!\" Benjamin said, \"Daddy! Oh! No!\" \"No, no!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"No!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"No!\" \"No, please, no!\" \"No, no!\" \"Has anybody seen a boat?\" \"Please!\" \"A white boat!\" \"They took my child!\" \"My child!\" \"Help me, please.\" \"Look out!\" What? Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, oh. Sorry. I didn't see you. Sir? Are you OK? The child is gone, the child is gone. There, there. It's all right. The child is gone. It'll be OK. No, no. They took the child away. I have to find the boat. A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat. You have? It passed by not too long ago. A white one? Hi. I'm Dory. Where? Which way? Oh, oh, oh. It went this way. It went this way. It went this way. Follow me. Thank you. Thank you, thank you so much. No problem. Hey... Wait! Will you quit it? What? I'm trying to swim here. Ocean isn't big enough for you? You got a problem, buddy? Huh? Huh? Huh? You got a problem, buddy? Huh? Huh? Do you? Do you? Do you? You want a piece of me? Ooh, I'm scared now. What? Wait a minute. Stop following me, OK? What? You're showing me where the boat went. A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat. It passed by not too long ago. It went this way. It went this way. It went this way. Follow me. Wait a minute. What is going on? You already told me which way the boat was going. I did? Oh, no. If this is some kind of practical joke, it's not funny. And I know funny. I'm a clownfish. No, it's not. I know it's not. I'm so sorry. See, I suffer from short-term memory loss. Short-term memory loss. A fish said, \"I do not trust this.\" Another fish said, \"No, it is real.\" \"I forget things very soon.\" \"It runs in my family.\" \"At least, I think it does.\"\n\n\"Where are they?\" \"Can I help you?\" \"Something is wrong with you... really.\" \"You're wasting my time.\" \"I have to find my child.\"\n\n\"Hello.\" A shark said, \"Well, hi! Name's Benjamin.\"\n\n\"It's all right. I understand. Why trust a shark, right? So, what are you small fishes doing out so late?\"\n\n\"We're not doing anything. We're not even out.\"\n\nThe shark said, \"Great! Then how about you come to a fun party I'm having?\"\n\n\"You mean, like a party?\"\n\n\"Yeah, right. A party. What do you say? I love parties.\"\n\n\"That sounds like fun. Parties are fun, and it's tempting, but...\"\n\nThe shark said, \"Oh, come on, I insist.\"\n\n\"OK. That's all that matters.\"\n\n\"Hey, look, balloons. It is a party.\"\n\nThe shark laughed and said, \"Mind your distance, though. Those balloons can be a bit tricky. You wouldn't want one of them to pop.\"\n\nAnother shark arrived and said, \"There you are, Benjamin. Finally. We got company.\"\n\nThe first shark said, \"It's about time. We've already had snacks and I'm still hungry. We almost had a big meal.\"\n\nThe second shark said, \"Come on, let's get this over with.\"\n\nThe first shark said, \"Right, then. The meeting has officially started. Let us all say the promise. I am a nice shark, not a mindless eating animal. If I am to change this image, I must first change myself. Fish are friends, not food. Except those dolphins. Dolphins think they're so cute.\"\n\n\"Right, then. Today's meeting is about bringing a fish friend. Do you all have your friends?\"\n\nA shark said, \"Got mine.\" Another shark said, \"Oh, I seem to have misplaced my friend. That's all right.\" \"Ow!\" \"Oh, sorry.\" \"Are you OK?\" \"Ow, ow, ow.\" \"Sorry.\" \"You hit me hard.\" \"Am I bleeding?\" \"Ohh.\" \"Ow, ow, ow.\" \"Adam, are you OK...\" \"Ohh.\" \"Ohh, that's good.\" \"Ohh, that's good.\" \"Ohh, that's good.\" \"Stop!\" \"Just a bite.\" \"Hold on, friend!\" \"Remember, Bruce, fish are friends, not food!\" \"Food!\" \"Adam, be careful!\" \"Food!\" \"Adam, be careful!\" \"I want fish tonight!\" \"Remember the steps, friend!\" \"Just one bite!\" \"Hello.\" \"Grr! There's no way out! There must be a way to escape! Who is it? Adam, help me find a way out! Sorry. Come back later. We're trying to escape. There must be a way out! Here's something. \"Es-cap-e.\" I wonder what that means. Funny. It's spelled just like \"escape.\" Let's go. Here's Bruce! Wait a minute. You can read? I can read? That's right. I can read! Well, then, here. Read this now. He really doesn't mean it. He never even knew his dad. Don't fall off the good path! Oh, no, it's blocked! No, Bruce, focus. Sorry about Bruce, friend. He's really a nice guy. I need to get that mask. You want that mask? OK. No, no, no, no, no, no! Quick, grab the mask! Oh, no. Bruce? What? Swim away! Swim away! Swim away! Aw, is the fun over? Nice. Dad? Daddy? Huh? Barbara. Yes? Prep for his teeth, please. And I need more cotton. OK. Hello, little friend. Heh heh heh! Cute, isn't he? I found that guy struggling out on the reef, and I saved him. So, has that medicine kicked in yet? I think so. We're ready to go. \"Bubbles!\" \"My bubbles.\" \"David likes bubbles.\" \"Aah!\" \"Ohh!\" \"No!\" \"Uhh!\" \"Hello.\" \"Aah!\" \"Slow down, little one.\" \"There's nothing to worry about.\" \"He's scared.\" \"I want to go home.\" \"Do you know where my dad is?\" \"Honey, your dad's probably back at the pet store.\" \"Pet store?\" \"Yeah, you know, like, I'm from a fish store.\" \"A pet store.\" \"A fish store.\" \"A mail order store.\" \"An online store. So, which one is it?\" \"I'm from the ocean.\" \"Ah, the ocean. The ocean?\" \"He hasn't been cleaned. Jack! Yes. Clean him! Yes. Ocean. Oh, the sea. Good. There. He is clean. Wow. The big blue water. What's it like? Big and blue? I knew it. If there's anything you need, just ask your aunt. Or if I'm not around, you can talk to my sister. Hi. How are you? Don't listen to anything my sister says. She's silly. Ha ha ha ha! We got a new one. Can't hear you, sister. I said we got a new one. Boy, oh, boy. What do we have? A bad tooth...and by the looks of those pictures...it's not going to be pretty. Is the tool in place? Yes. What tool did he use to open? A drill. He seems to like that one lately. I can't see, sister. You're getting a little too...Aah! Now he's using a special tool. He's using a tool. That's not that tool. That's a other tool. It has a special shape. Clearly that tool. No, no, other tool. That tool! Other tool! There I go. A little help, over here. I'll go fix him. All right. Go ahead and rinse. Oh, the human mouth is a disgusting place. Hey, friend. What did I miss? One day, a young fish named David was taken from his home. \"He's going to be a gift for my niece Emma for her birthday,\" said the man who took him. \"Emma is turning eight this week. She will be your new mommy.\"\n\nDavid was very scared. \"Help me, Daddy!\" he cried. But he was trapped in a small bag. \n\nAn older fish named Gabriel saw David stuck in the bag. \"Don't worry, little one,\" Gabriel said kindly. \"I will help you get out.\"\n\nGabriel told David to wiggle his fins and tail. David did as he was told, even though one of his fins didn't work well. At last, he squirmed out of the bag!\n\n\"Well done!\" said Gabriel with a smile. \"Now, what is your name?\"\n\n\"My name is David,\" said the young fish.\n\nGabriel and the other fish were happy to meet David. They planned a nice welcome party for him that night. David was relieved to be free and have new friends to help him. \"I'm Nemo.\" \"Nemo.\" \"Nemo.\" \"Nemo.\" \"Are you going to eat that?\" \"Be careful with that tool.\" \"Huh?\" \"No, no.\" \"What does it say?\" \"Dory!\" \"A small animal has my money.\" \"Wake up.\" \"Get up.\" \"Come on.\" \"Come on!\" \"Yes, I am a natural blue color.\" \"Get up!\" \"Look out!\" \"Big fish eat small fish!\" \"Wow.\" \"Dusty. The mask. Where is the mask? No! No, not the mask! Get it! Get the mask! Get the mask! Get the mask! Get it! Sounds of singing. Whoo-hoo! Singing continues. Echo! Echo! Echo! Hey, what are you doing? It is gone. I have lost the mask. Did you drop it? You dropped it! That was my only chance of finding my child. Now it is gone. Hey, Mr. Grumpy Gills... when life gets you down, know what you have to do? I don't want to know. Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming. What do we do? We swim, swim. Dory, no singing. Sounds of singing. I love to swim. When you want to swim. See, I'm going to get stuck now with that song. Now it is in my head. Sorry. Dory, do you see anything? Something has me. That was me. I'm sorry. Who is that? Who could it be? It is me. Are you my conscience? Yeah, yeah. I'm your conscience. We haven't spoken for a while. How are you? Can't complain. Yeah? Good. Now, Dory, I want you to tell me... Do you see anything? I see a... I see a light. A light? Yeah. Over there. Hey, conscience, am I dead? No. I see it, too. What is it? It is so pretty. I'm feeling... happy... which is a big deal for me. I want to touch it. \"Hey, hey.\" \"You like impressions?\" \"Just like in practices, gentlemen.\" \"So what are we?\" \"Take a guess.\" \"Oh, oh.\" \"I've seen one of those.\" \"I'm a fish with a nose like a sword.\" \"Wait, wait, um...\" \"It's a swordfish!\" \"Hey, silly person, let the lady guess.\" \"Where's the butter?\" \"Ooh!\" \"It's on the tip of my tongue!\" \"Lobster.\" \"Saw that!\" \"Lots of legs!\" \"Live in the ocean. Clam! Close enough! Oh, it's a big story I'll tell you, young one...\" \"They're good. Will somebody please give me directions?!\" \"Blah blah blah, me, me, blah!\" \"Blah blah blah, me, me, me!\" Thank you. Oh, dear. Hey! Hey, come back! Hey, what's the matter? What's the matter? While they're doing their silly little impressions... I am far away from home with a fish that can't remember her name! I bet that's frustrating. Meanwhile, my child is out there. Your child? But it doesn't matter because no fish... in this entire ocean is going to help me. Well, I'm helping you. Wait right here. Guys! Is he bothering you again? No, no. He's a good person. Go easy on him. He's lost his child. Go easy on him. He's lost his child. Any of you heard of a place? Sure do! Oh! Hey! They know a place! You wouldn't know how to get there, would you? You want to follow a big current. Can't miss it. It's in... that direction. And then you follow that for about... I don't know. What do you guys think? \"Ouch!\" \"Ouch!\" \"Ouch!\" \"It does not look bad.\" \"You will be fine.\" \"But now we know, do we not... that we do not want to touch these again.\" \"Let us be grateful this time it was just a little one.\" \"Do not move.\" \"This is bad, Emma.\" \"Hey, watch this!\" \"Boing!\" \"Boing!\" \"Boing!\" \"Emma! You cannot catch me.\" \"Do not bounce on the tops! They will sting you!\" \"The tops do not sting you!\" \"Two in a row! Beat that!\" Emma, listen to me. I have an idea... a game. \"A game?\" \"Yes. I love games! Pick me!\" Here is the game. Whoever can hop the fastest out of these jellyfish wins! \"OK.\" Rules, rules, rules! You cannot touch the tentacles. Only the tops. Something about tentacles. Got it. Go! Wait! Not something about them, it is all about them! Whee! Wait, Emma! You have to go faster if you want to win! You have to go faster if you want to win! You have to go faster if you want to win! Whoa! Emma! Boing, boing, boing! Wait a minute! Whoa! Emma! Whee! We are cheating death now. That is what we are doing. But we are having fun at the same time. I can do this. Just be careful. Yeah, careful I do not make you cry when I win! I do not think so! Ha ha ha ha! Whoa! Give it up, old man. You cannot fight how things are made. I was made for speed. The question is, Emma, are you hungry? \"Hungry?\" Yeah. Because you are about to eat my bubbles! Duck to the left! Right there! The clownfish is the winner! Whoo-hoo! We did it! Look at us! Emma? Oh, no. Emma! Emma! Emma! Emma! Am I disqualified? No, you are doing fine! You are actually winning! But you have to stay awake. Where does the fish seller live? Two little animals were moving in the water. One animal said, \"Hey, we have seen that small dot before. That means we are not going straight but in circles.\" The other animal said, \"Let's go up. We can figure it out there.\" The first animal said, \"OK, let's ask someone for the way.\" The second animal asked, \"Who will we ask? There is no one here.\" The first animal said, \"There must be someone in the big water place. Look around.\" They looked but could not find anyone. Then the first animal saw a big thing and said, \"Let's ask that big thing over there.\" The second animal was scared and said, \"What if that big thing eats us?\" The first animal said, \"Don't be afraid. I trust this way. Let's ask it.\" So the first animal called out, \"Hello there! Big thing! We need help to find a small animal that was taken far away. Can you show us the way?\" A fish and a friend were inside a big animal. The fish said, \"We are inside a big animal! We need to get out!\" The friend tried to talk to the animal. The fish said, \"Stop it! You can't talk to animals!\" They saw the water going down. The fish was scared. The friend said, \"Maybe the animal wants us to go to its throat.\" The fish yelled, \"It wants to eat us!\" They kept arguing about what the animal wanted. The fish was very worried about getting out. \"Go around, kid!\" \"Lean!\" \"Lean!\" \"Oops.\" \"That would have been a bad fall.\" \"Gabriel!\" \"Don't let me turn over!\" \"Just be calm, Nathan.\" \"You won't turn over.\" \"I promise.\" \"You will be OK.\" \"Diana!\" \"Do any of these boats look familiar to you?\" \"No, but the boat has to be here somewhere.\" \"Come on, Emma. We're going to find it.\" \"I'm very excited. Are you excited?\" \"Emma, wake up. Wake up, come on.\" \"Duck!\" \"That's not a duck. It's a big bird!\" \"No! I didn't come this far to be eaten!\" \"Hey, Xavier. Would you look at that? What? What? What? The sun is barely up and Henry has had more than he can handle. Yeah. Someone should help the poor guy. Yeah, right. Yeah. Don't everyone fly away at once.\" \"All right, Henry. The fish caught your tongue? Love a duck! Love a duck! Love a duck! I have to find my son Nathan!\" \"Nathan? He's that fish! The one that's been fighting the whole ocean! I know where your son... Huh? Wait! Come back! Stop!\" \"Emma, keep going! He's crazy! I have something to tell you!\" \"Mine. Don't move suddenly. Hop inside my mouth if you want to live.\" \"Hop in your mouth? How does that make me live?\" \"Mine? Because I can take you to your son. Because I can take you to your son.\" \"Yeah, right.\" \"No. I know your son. He's orange with a fin that doesn't work well on one side. That's Nathan! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!\" \"Put on your seat belts! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Everyone hold on! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Too loud! Too loud for me! Twinkle, twinkle, little star. Find a happy place! Find a happy place! Find a happy place!\" \"Diana, your aunt will see you now.\" \"All right, let's see those pearly whites.\" \"Raah!\" \"I'm a piranha.\" \"They're in the AM river.\" \"And a piranha's a fish, just like your present.\" \"I get fishy, fishy\" \"Oh, no.\" \"Poor little guy.\" \"He's resting.\" \"Nathan!\" \"Yay!\" \"Fishy, fishy, fishy!\" \"Must've left your present in the car, sweetie.\" \"Ohh!\" \"I'll go and get it.\" \"He's still alive!\" \"He's not resting!\" \"What's happening?\" \"Why is he playing resting?\" \"He's gonna get flushed down the toilet.\" \"He's gonna get out of here!\" \"He's gonna get flushed!\" \"What a smart little guy!\" \"Oh, no! Not the trash can!\" Nathan! No!\" \"Hey! I found his dad!\" \"Where's Nathan?\" \"The tooth helper!\" \"He's over there!\" \"What's a tooth helper?\" \"Grace, get in there!\" \"I can't go in there!\" \"Yes, you can! Charge! What the...? Emma, sweetie, look out! Hold still! Easy! Easy! Easy! Hold still! Nobody's going to hurt you! Oof! Nathan. Oh, my goodness. Gotcha! Keep down! Nathan! Dad? Out with you! And stay out! Dad? Fishy? Fishy! Wake up! Oh, no! To the top of Mount Wannahockaloogie! Why are you sleeping? Hurry! Kevin! Ring of Fire! Fishy! Wow! All the animals have gone mad! Unh! Aaah! Get it out! Hit her in the head! Go, Kevin, go! Fish in my hair! Kevin! Nathan...tell your dad I said hi. Go get 'em! He did it! Yay! I'm so happy! Is he gonna be OK, Kevin? Don't worry. All drains lead to the big water. Fishy! Dad! I'm so sorry. Truly, I am. Truly, I am. Hey. Fiona...if it wasn't for you...I never would've even made it here. So, thank you. \"Hold up,\" said Alice. \"Where are you going?\" \"It's over, Emma. We were too late,\" said Fiona. \"Grace is gone, and I'm going home now.\" \"No, no, you can't,\" said Alice. \"Please don't go away. Please? No one's ever stuck with me for so long before. If you leave, I just...I remember things better with you. I do.\" \"Look...I remember it. It's there. I know it is because when I look at you...I can feel it. I look at you and I...I'm home. Please...I don't want that to go away. I don't want to forget.\"\n\n\"Sweet drink of life!\" shouted Oliver. \"This is our spot! Get out of here!\" Oliver said. \"Yeah, that's it, keep swimming.

Parent!\" cried Nora.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" asked Yara. \"I don't know where I am. I don't know what's happening. I think I lost someone, but I can't remember.\"\n\n\"It's okay.

You're Nora! Yes, yes, I'm Nora! You were gone. I saw you. And here you are! I found you.\" Adam was trying to get home. \"Dad!\" Adam called out. \"Dad!\" He saw a big fish that looked like his dad. \"Dad!\" Adam said again. The fish turned around. It was Adam's dad! \"Nemo!\" his dad said. \"Daddy!\" Adam shouted. Adam's dad swam over to him. \"Thank goodness,\" his dad said. \"It's going to be OK.\" But they were going the wrong way! \"Turn around!\" a fish named Grace told them. \"You're going the wrong way!\" Adam and his dad turned around. \"Oh no, help!\" Grace shouted. \"Help!\" She was stuck. \"Help! Get us out!\" Adam knew what to do. \"Dad, I know what to do!\" he said. \"We have to tell all the fish to swim down together!\" His dad said, \"I am not gonna lose you again! There's no time! It's the only way to save Grace! I know you can do this.\" Adam told all the fish to swim down. Grace told them too. \"Swim down! Everybody swim down!\" she said. All the fish started swimming down together. \"It's working!\" Adam said happily. Keep going! Keep going! Keep going! Just keep going! Keep going! Come on, Dad! You're doing great, son! That's my dad. Let's get lower! Keep going! Just keep going, just keep going. Almost there! Keep going! Keep going! Keep going! Keep going! Keep going! Oof! Hey! Dory! Where's Nemo? There! Oh, no. Nemo? Nemo? Nemo? It's OK. Daddy's here. Daddy's got you. Daddy? Oh, thank goodness. Dad... I don't dislike you. Oh, no, no, no. I'm so sorry, Nemo. Hey, guess what? What? Sea animals... I met one. And he was 150 years old. 150? Yep. Sandy said they only live to be 100. Sandy? Do you think I would cross the entire ocean... and not know as much as Sandy? Ha ha ha! He was 150! Not 100! Who is this Sandy who knows everything? Time for school! Get up! Let's go! Time for school! Get up! Let's go! I'm gonna win! No, you're not! I did it! Aw, my own son beats me! Climb aboard, explorers. The sea animal looks over to the other animal and says... \"With arms like these, who needs plants?\" Hello, Nemo. Who's this? Student from another place. I'm from the far away sea, dude! Sweet! Totally. Seriously, Matthew. Did you really do all the things you say you did? Pardon me. Hello. Don't be alarmed. We wanted to make sure our newest member got home safely. Thanks, guys. See you next week. Keep up with the program. Remember, fish are friends... Not food! Bye! Hold on, here we go! Next stop... learning! Bye, son! Have fun! Bye, Dad! Oh! Mr. Ray, wait. I forgot something. Love you, Dad.

My loved one stands on sandy ground and watches the boats that sail away. Somewhere far away is waiting for me. If I could fly high like birds, then straight to my loved one's arms I'll go sailing. It's far beyond the stars, it's near beyond the moon. I know for sure my heart will lead me there soon. We'll meet beyond the shore, we'll kiss like before. Happy we'll be far away and never again I'll go sailing.\n\nI know for sure my heart will lead me there soon. Oh, we'll meet, I know we'll meet beyond the shore. We'll kiss just as before, happy we will be far away and never again I'll go sailing. No more sailing, so long sailing, sailing. No more sailing, good-bye farewell my friend.

I just take good care of myself.\" And the doctor said \"So why do you want to live to be 100?\"\" [Laughs] You heard it. [Door opens] Oh. Hello. Gabriel, this is Matthew. How are you?

The board looks at if the illness will end in death within a year, how treatment affects the family, and if treatment improves living or just prolongs suffering.

That's why you gave it to me? Yes. You're different. I'm different? Yes. I don't think you get as caught up in these things. Right. Why? Did it bother you in court the other day? It affected me, yes. I may not show my feelings to everyone... but it doesn't mean that I'm not affected by things. I feel things. You know, it's hard. We're forced to make decisions... based on what is in front of us. It's true. Otherwise we can't do anything. I'm kind of nervous about this... but I'm going to tell you. I got us a place to go after the wedding. You got a place? Yes, a place to go... after the wedding. I just don't know. [Laughs] And it's not like me, usually. I just leave these things up to chance. Or to someone else. No, up to chance. But this time, it's up to me. OK. Well, this place to go... did you think to get a late check-out? [Laughs] Very funny. Oh! Barbara? Yes. You OK? Yes. It's a cramp. Nerves.

He is, in fact, sitting directly behind you. I know. He came back here. He has been living here for many years. Cannot be stopped. Did you know that most helpers never even see a top helper for their whole work? You brought down two, did you not? And now your third is sitting very close. Now, retired or not that has really got to get you interested. I am a normal person now. Did he kill that helper friend of yours? What was his name Benjamin? Yes. Adam is a person from FR country. He cannot be brought here for crimes done in this country. Do you happen to know of a Cameron? Worked for the group. This Cameron pumped your friend Benjamin full of things, day after day so that they could hurt him for two weeks before he died. You must have known that. Cameron himself having dinner with your prey. I wonder what it is they are up to now. Two weeks of hurt, Frank. Think about that. For your dead friend for the job you did not finish in SA city.

Stand back. I just... I brought you a gift. I am still mad at you. And trust me, it was not easy to get. So... Come closer and I will thank you. Are you trying to make me excited? Closer, I said. How about that little tip? It makes sure you get a big arrest and a reward. Even from your bad group. I am impressed. But then what? Want to hear my plan? Either that or I start shooting. Okay. The new leader wants to stop the bad group. And the bad group wants a soldier named Marquez to take over while the leader is visiting OL city. Now, I have a man inside to make sure that Marquez never takes over. The last piece is the bad group. Your tip makes sure the bad group is out while the fight happens. After this good change, I will calmly take the money that the bad group will pay Marquez for taking over. You stop the bad group with the information that you have, then you join me and share the rewards. You meet me two nights from now at LP place, 10 at night exactly and bring only what is important to you. Oh, yeah. It might get a bit dangerous there, dear. So... Can you understand? I can understand. I want my key back. Testing. One, two. Testing. Hello? Can you hear me now? Okay... Loud sounds. Did you get your team ready? You know I did. Why are you having me followed? Oh, yeah, that. \"Come in.\" \"I have nothing.\" \"I need to enter.\" \"I have nothing.\" \"Try to move.\" \"I have no way to move.\" \"What are you going to do, silly one?\" \"Adam is moving.\" \"Where are you going?\" \"You are buying a snack.\" \"This is too easy.\" \"Where are the other people?\" \"This seems like a trap.\" \"It smells like a trap.\" \"I am making my move.\" \"Adam.\" \"Well, that depends who is asking.\" \"I thought that was you.\" \"Here, let me pay for this.\" \"Oh, well, thanks.\" \"\"Oh, no.\" Is that real?\" Yes, it is. No way. What took you all so long? Hey there, friend. You won't need that. Believe it or not, I'm ready to go. Let's talk over there. After you. I just want to leave here. I've been hiding down in the MX country for the last many years. And I've been working for a group for the last few. I have nothing. All I have is what I'm wearing. I can't go anywhere. They kind of have control over me, you know? Adam. I'll take you under the police's watch until we can take you back, where you will be judged for your actions. In the US country? In the US country. The things that I've had to do for the group are unspeakable. You don't know what Barillo is up to? I'm close to the man. I'm real close. But he doesn't let anyone in, that bad person. Can you get him close to Barillo? Him? I need your help. Then you get me out of here. Then I'll get you out of here. Him too.\" \"Him too.\" \"Him too.\" There's the group on every corner. Frank told me you handle protection. I don't work for Frank anymore. And since I'm from the MX country, I can do whatever I want. Then I guess I don't work for Frank neither. Goodbye. There's a price on your head. I'm going to collect. Why don't you just tell Barillo everything you know. And then maybe he'll just cut off your hands. There were two friends. One friend said, \"If you do not listen to me, I will hurt your family.\" The other friend said, \"You cannot hurt my family. I will fight back.\"\n\nThe first friend said, \"I have hurt people before. I can hurt your family too.\" The second friend said, \"If you hurt my family, I will have to kill you.\"\n\nThe first friend fell asleep for a few days after being hit on the head. When he woke up, he was told to relax and play music from his heart. If his heart was not pure, he would need to practice a lot. \n\nAn important man came to town. He wanted to hurt the second friend. The first friend was told he had to help the important man or else he would be hurt too.\n\nThe important man was looking for the second friend to hurt him. But the second friend escaped. The important man then decided to get rid of the first friend instead.\n\nThe first friend was badly injured while trying to change how he looked. It is not clear if he died or not. \"I set them up.\" \"I watch them fall.\" \"I'm living a fun life.\" \"No!\" \"I'm very sorry about your candy, but listen.\" \"I will give you this if you'll be my eyes.\" \"It's a small coin.\" \"I meant this.\" \"I need you to take me to the center of the NE city.\" \"Is someone following you?\" \"It's hard for me to tell right now because I'm having a bad day.\" \"Do you see someone?\" \"Yes, he's getting close.\" \"Listen, have you ever seen one of these?\" \"Have you used one?\" \"Don't ever, because they're bad.\" \"But what I need for you to do is to aim this at the bad man who's following us and shoot him in the head.\" \"Kill him?\" \"Oh, yes.\" \"Very kill him.\" \"Close?\" \"Okay.\" \"Hurt him.\" \"Hurt that person.\" \"Just send him away.\" \"What?\" \"Okay.\" \"Come here.\" \"Right or left?\" \"Was that my right or your right?\" \"Wrong man. Sorry.\" \"Look me in the eyes and then I will leave.\" \"Good child.\" \"Now you're thinking. Take me to the center of the NE city, where there will be more coins. For you... for our child... for our country. In the past, I would deal with bad things from the bottom. Now I see start at the top. The leader is a good man. I'll go around back. Meet me soon. Watch him. We could make him feel bad. He used to work for the police. He's retired. That doesn't matter. I felt bad once. I didn't like it. You know what the bad thing is? They hurt my body. That made me not like the whole thing. What should we do with him? Let's go eat and talk about it. Hey good child, watch that person. Just be quiet. They'll leave us alone. What's wrong?! I don't like soldiers. Leave. Why are we stopping? We can't go further. Why not? Look out there. It's a big problem! I can't see, friend! I have no eyes. Well, then listen to it, friend!

Matthew, sir.\" \"It feels like you need some protection, sir.\" \"Who are you guys?\" \"Sons of NE country, sir.\" \"Are we in front of the building?\" \"Okay.\" \"This is it, kid.

Rules don't apply to me any more than they do to you. Mr. Chambers. Yes, sir. You're just going to stand there? I'm afraid anything but standing's gonna cost you extra. You leave me no choice.

A man said, \"A good day to you.\" Another man replied, \"Thank you kindly.\"\nThe first man said, \"In the mornings, I read old books at the church. In the evening, when it was cooler, I went to places I always wanted to see.\"\n\"Do you have the time?\" he asked a woman.\n\"It is a little before 5 o'clock,\" she replied. \n\"Thank you. What a nice watch!\" the man exclaimed.\n\"Are you from the FR country?\" he asked her.\n\"Shall I tell your future?\" the woman inquired.\n\"Are you a traveling person?\" the man asked.\n\"If you like,\" she responded.\n\"If you are not a traveling person, are you a magic person?\" the man questioned.\n\"I work with a bad magic man,\" the woman declared.\n\"Again?\" the man asked, puzzled.\n\"What?\" the woman replied.\n\"Your watch,\" the man clarified.\n\"Oh, yes,\" the woman said, showing her watch.\nThe man asked, \"May I hold your arm?\"\n\"Of course,\" she agreed.\nThe woman described a beautiful lady with dark eyes and hair, bright face and hands, and pink lips.\n\"May I see your looking glass?\" the man requested.\nThe woman said the man's loved one cared for someone else of higher status. But she could help heal his heart, for a price.\nSuddenly, a boy appeared. The woman sent him away. But it was someone the man knew - a small world!\nThe woman said she could no longer help the man, but he would soon meet his match.\nA few days later, the man moved with help to an old fort.\n\"Is this common here?\" he asked his assistant.\nThen the ground opened, showing signs of an ancient people!\nWhen the man returned to the church, he received a surprise. \"Thanks, Adam.\" \"Praised be!\" \"Welcome, my dear friend.\" \"I, your servant, and my friends were praying for you.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"So you were not hurt?\" \"We know you were robbed.\" \"They found your watch in that bad person's house.\" \"Praise be!\" \"The accused will rise.\" \"The trial took place some days later...\" \"The result.\" \"...and I was asked to speak.\" \"This court finds Gabriel guilty of being bad.\" \"His crime is proven, he being the one who did the crimes of hurting people and taking things.\" \"So, it says Gabriel must be punished.\" \"Signed in CO city in the late 20th century.\" \"Charlotte.\" \"You will be hurt soon.\" \"That's it!\" \"I brought you these.\" \"Can I do anything else?\" \"Thanks, I do not need any more.\" \"Do you think help, or friends might get you out of being punished?\" \"Have a church meeting for my soul.\" \"Do you know a huge building by the wall near the river in SE city?\" \"Help!\" \"Help!\" \"Help!\" \"She's dead! She killed her! Back there, in the room! Help me, please! Help me!\" \"To the room and calm her down! Take two people and see what's going on.\" \"Fate had just shown my future. It's all yours, come and try it. Let us through! Out of the way! Quiet! Fight, fight, bad person! Quiet!\" \"Quiet!\" \"Give me all you've got Gabriel! Tell Big Nose we like you better. I'm going to die! Get me a church person, and someone to punish that bad girl! Your mother was the bad one! Silence!\" \"Silence!\" \"Silence!\" \"Right, what's going on?\" \"You must come with me.\" \"Only because I trust you.\" \"Give me my head covering.\" \"Let's go.\" Bad person! Bad girl! You will be punished now! Shut up, all of you! Gabriel! Silence!\" \"Silence!\" \"Silence!\" \"Silence!\" \"Silence!\" \"Troublemaker!\" \"Anything to say?\" \"Charlotte started it.\" \" Nonsense!\" \"It was Isabel.\" \" Yes, Isabel.\" \"Quiet!\" \"Speak up, I'm waiting.\" \"Hurting people is a bad thing.\" \"It was your fault!\" \"It always is!\" \"I'll get you!\" \"Bad words!\" \"Quiet!\" \"I'll get you!\" \"And I'll get you!\" \"You're too free-handed.\" \"Get a rope.\" \"Officer.\" \"Tie her tight, Benjamin!\" \"Tie her mouth too!\" \"Lock her up.\" \"Let the wise people decide.\" \"Let the kind people look after her!\" \"Bad words for them, Charlotte! \"Eat 'em up, Charlotte, they're only grown-ups!\" \"Watch out for your husband!\" \"Why are they taking you?\" \"Where are we going, officer?\" \"To jail, child.\" \"Have pity, officer!\" \"You're young and brave...\" \"Keep walking. The rope's too tight!\" \"My arms!\" \"I'll loosen it.\" \"Look... let me escape and I'll give you a charm to make women like you.\" \"Stop the nonsense. You're going to jail. Orders are orders.\" \"I'll be giving the orders soon.\" \"Really? How?\" \"I know you keep my flower next to your heart. It's magic. Keep walking. Go on. Oh, God above! By all my ancestors! What's to happen to me? Kind Mother, take pity on this bad person! You're crying? Where's your pride now? She hasn't done anything bad. Let her go! It's not for me. \" So, what was the fight over? \" You. Over me? They said, like all NE people, you were only fit for chopping wood. Well, now... You speak NE language? \" I'm from ET village. You? \" #From EL village.# Travelers brought me here. But I'm NE. They insult me, for not being like them. Fellow countryman, friend, won't you lend me a hand? Move it. She was lying, sir. She always lied. But she spoke and I believed her. She was stronger than me. She spoke terrible NE language, but I took her for a compatriot. What do you know about that person? It is good advice. Do not wait. Go. Do you know who Charlotte is? Do you want to know? At a young age, they had taken away her innocence multiple times. While her mother was with foreign men, her father killed them for a small amount of money. When she has no money, she comes here and is with a few old men. Why Charlotte? What do you see in that woman? What do you want? A young innocent girl? I can provide one. A woman in her early twenties, loving and a good cook? I can provide one. Or someone who can have healthy children? I can provide one too. And if you prefer an experienced woman, one who knows what a man wants, in bed and outside of bed... then I can provide all of that, if you wish. Enough! I want Charlotte. I want her, only for myself. Only for me and no one else. Just me. Why are you here? Go. Get out, foolish person! I have only dislike for you and that woman! This means trouble. Obey! Woman! Obey! Leader... Get out. Charlotte... Go, I said! Go and pray to your ideals until I come. Let us hope they can get you out of this mess. Quick! Go! Most forgiving ideal, who has never denied help to those who seek it, I come to you. Groaning under my faults, I stand before you. O my ideal! I give you my whole self. This very night, I give you my eyes, ears, tongue, heart, my whole being. Since I am yours, keeper of goodness, keep and defend me. Through my fault, through my own great fault. Here, plain clothes. You cannot be seen in your clothes. Your leader is in trouble, so it is time to change how you live. To start, to dress as a plain person. Come. You foolish newcomer! All you do is make mistakes. I said I would bring you bad luck. You will have to act now. If you have the courage, go to the hills and be a smuggler. \"We were young children.\" \"Do you know how many toys old Adam has?\" \"Listen...\" \"Adam has many toys, like toy castles, knights, and other fun things,\" \"He has lots of toy cars and animals...\" \"He has so many great toys.\" \"What is wrong with him?\" \"He misses his favorite toy.\" \"His favorite toy?\" \"What toy?\" \"Charlotte.\" \"Was Adam really your best friend?\" \"My close friend.\" \"I beat him in a game, fair and simple, one-on-one.\" \"He lost to me.\" \"One toy less for him.\" \"The other children looked up to me for winning the game.\" \"For a few days it seemed my dream had come true.\" \"What's that?\" \"It was my mother's gift.\" \"Win a game and you get your prize, young one.\" \"A prize and a toy.\" \"Maybe.\"\n\n\"'Chapter 28. The things that happened to Charlotte, Emma, and Adam. \"Forgive me again,\" Charlotte said to Adam. \"Forgive me for beating you.\"' \"Tell me you're happy.\" \"I'm happy.\" \"Learn, young one.\" \"With two toys?\" \"They're watching.\" \"Let them watch. Move, young one, move. Don't leave it all to me.\" \"A visitor! Who is it?\" \"Frank.\" Who's Frank? Your friend's friend. He came back today.\" Well? When two children love one toy and both are in the same place...\" \"Let's see.\" \"I'll put my head in there.\" ...and the other grits his teeth...\" He's being silly, not up to anything bad. What is it, young one? I only love you. Benjamin bought me this toy when I was little. Let's not fight over a toy ring. You came at the right time. When I'm with him, I think of you. Hello, Frank. Hello, Adam. Long time, no see. Where have you been? Away for a while. What's the plan? A big toy shipment. New toy pistols, toy trucks. It's dangerous. That's just my view..., for what it's worth. Our backup? Thomas and Frank work on a farm. Alice asks Thomas, \"Will your wife love you?\" Frank says, \"Your wife sleeps with others, but loves me.\" \n\nAlice says, \"Do not say bitter things.\" Frank says, \"The cards do not lie.\"\n\nAlice says, \"The other woman is dangerous.\" Thomas says, \"If I flirt, my wife gets angry. She is my woman.\"\n\nAlice says, \"Every woman loves Lucas.\" \n\nA message comes from the governor. \"The queen had a baby princess. The princess will be baptized tomorrow and named Maria.\"\n\nAlice's name is Carmen. A man says, \"I will think of your name when I fight the next bull.\"\n\nAnother man says, \"Be careful, or you will lose Carmen.\" \n\nA woman says, \"A man who loves a person who smokes has no pride. The smoker causes trouble with neighbors.\"\n\nSoldiers come and there is a fight. A man helps another injured man. They escape and look for food.\n\nOne man says, \"Your friend betrayed us. He only wants to get ahead.\" \"Put your toys away.\" \"Stay away.\" \"Andrew...\" \"It's not your game.\" \"Step aside.\" \"Where were you born?\" \"In the city?\" \"Mean person... grew up poorly.\" \"I'll scratch your face.\" \"Then open your belly.\" \"Bad kid.\" \"You're going to a bad place.\" \"Who are you wishing well to?\" \"Whose family do you want to be?\" \"Naughty child.\" \"Bad things!\" \"Maybe she really brings bad luck.\" \"Here, take it.\" \"Take it!\" \"I won't wish you well, you can't handle it.\" \"We'll have to bury him.\" \"Isn't this better?\" \"His time had come.\" Yours will, too.\" \"My time has come already.\" \"And yours.\" \"This sneaky life is over.\" \"You'll be my friend, mine only, for life.\" \"What do you want?\" \"Little kids?\" \"Me with a baby clinging to me?\" \"It was then I bumped into you, sir. First near NM town, then in CO city. Charlotte kept your watch. She also wanted your money and that ring you wear. Said it was magic and cared about owning it. Another person occupied her thoughts... Walk down the street and forget tonight's events. My watch! Best forgotten. Is he your friend? Who? The athlete. Are you friends? I wish we were. I forbid you to see him. Careful, forbidden things taste better. Forgive me! Please, Charlotte, forgive me! I will not. It bears your name, Charlotte. Look, there's your Andrew. Poke me. Run through me. Make sounds with me. Let's shout together. Hey, where are you going? Who is it? What do they want? Get dressed. Who's this rude kid? Go. What bad luck! The person I want in my arms, and her friend shows up. Benjamin, David, Patrick, out! Everybody out! See... I've spared your life. I play sports. I don't break the hearts of kids... who love the same person. What are you waiting for? Lucas is my friend! Shoot, if you dare, or go! Swear you won't do it again. No. Adam said, \"You will only be mine forever.\"\nBella said, \"No.\"\n\"Bella,\" Adam said. \"Please, I am asking you.\"\n\"I will forget the past,\" Adam said. \"Have pity, Bella. Let me be saved and save yourself with me.\"\n\"I do not love you,\" Bella said.\n\"I will not let you trick me with another person,\" Adam said. \"Do not hurt me or hit me.\"\n\"Put me in the woods,\" Adam said. \"I do not want to hurt you. I just want you to come with me and be my wife.\"\n\"No, no, no!\" Bella said. \"No! I am tired of threats. I am tired of seeing you. Go. Leave me alone.\"\n\"For the last time, come with me,\" Adam said.\n\"No, never. Never!\" Bella said.\n\"Bella, I am asking you,\" Adam said. \"I have hurt others for you, and will again, to keep you.\"\n\"I want nothing from you!\" Bella said. \"Nothing to do with you! I hate myself for loving you. Dare to hurt me. Hurt me or let me go.\"\n\"And live with memories?\" Adam said. \"I will follow you only to death, I will not live with you.\"\n\"Hurt Bella. Hurt her,\" Adam said.\nAdam said, \"Her body was still alive for me. Now at last, Bella belonged to me.\"\nAdam said, \"At dawn, I gave myself up.\"\nAdam said, \"I am a man of words meant to bring comfort but which often only cause more sadness. Sadness and love are our eternal teachers.\"", "hash": "e04d6504abec2a75d5cb6071d59c9cbe6bd674aca9c427c890d6ce325ba4cfe7"}

These are our kids we're talking about.\" \"Look. They can poke their little heads out... and they see a big animal!\" Right by their room window.\" \"Shh. You'll wake the kids.\" \"Right. Look. They're dreaming. We still have to name them.\" \"You want to name all of them right now?\" \"We'll name this half Adam Junior... and this half Bella Junior.\" \"We're done.\" \"I like Cameron.\" \"We'll name one Cameron... but I'd like most of them to be Adam Junior.\" \"In a couple of days... we're going to be parents.\" \"Yeah.\" \"What if they don't like me?\" \"Really.

Small fish are no funnier than any other fish.\n\nLittle one. Do something funny.\" \"I know one joke. See? And the fish swims up. The shell isn't moving. And then the plant... they... I'm mixed up. There was a shell and a plant. So forget that I... Xavier! Get out of Mr. Kevin's yard now!\" \n\nYou kids! Where'd you go? You too? Can I? I would feel better if you'd play on the soft beds. That's where I would play. What's wrong with the small part? The small part looks funny. What'd I do? Be nice. It's the first time at school. The small part was there when born. We call it the lucky small part.\n\nDad... See this arm? It's actually shorter than all my other arms... but you can't really tell. Especially when I twist them like this. I'm H-2-O sick. Ah-choo! I'm loud.\n\nOh the areas. Let's name the areas of the open sea. Mr. Teacher! Nora. You better stay with me. Abyssalpelagic. All the rest are too deep for you and me to see.\n\nHuh. I wonder where my class has gone? We're under here! There you are. Learners. Knowledge exploring so poetic. When you think thoughts that are real you can go now. Hello. Who is this? I'm Nora. All new learners must answer a science question. OK. You live in what kind of home? An ani-none. A nemi-nemi-nemi.\n\nLearners. The small part has trouble swimming... 15 minutes. It's time for you to go now. \"Do not worry.\" \"We will stay as a group.\" \"Look up front.\" \"We keep our brain...\" \"Adam.\" \"Boy!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Father!\" \"Son!\" \"Be safe.\" \"You are doing well for the first time.\" \"Can you?\" \"I had a tough time with my oldest at the drop off.\" \"They must grow up...\" \"The drop off?\" Crazy? Why do we fry them now and have them with chips?\" Calm down. Boy. Boy? He is not really funny. Pity. Oh the living things\" \"Let's name the living things that live in the sea\" \"Wow.\" \"There are jellyfish and starfish\" \"And some fish like you and me sing with me.\" \"Oh\" \"\"Just the girls this time.\" \"Seaweed is good\" \"Seaweed is fun\" \"It makes its food\" \"The drop off. You can explore... but stay close.\" \"Tiny green plants!\" Gather. A whole little world in one tiny spot. There are many small parts in this... let's go. Sing with me! Jellyfish starfish three wait up! Wow. Cool. I saved your life! You made me release ink. What is that? I know what that is. Frank saw one. He said it was called a butt.\" \"Wow.\" \"That is a big butt.\" \"Look at me. I will touch the butt.\" \"Ah-choo! Whoa!\" Ha ha ha! Yes? Let's see you get closer. OK. Beat that. Nemo. How far can you go? My father says it is not safe.\" \"Nemo! No!\" Father? You were about to swim into open water. I was not... Good thing I was here. If I had not shown up...\" He was not going to go. He was too afraid. I was not. Kids... and you are lucky I do not tell your parents. You know you cannot swim well. OK? It is not OK. You should not be near here. I was right. You will start school in a year or two. Father! There was a father looking for his little boy. \"What do these markings mean?\" one fish asked. \"I never knew my father!\" another fish said. \"Hello,\" said a third fish. \"I can't read these markings.\" \"We need to find a fish that can read this,\" the first fish said. \"Dory!\" they called to a blue fish. \"That's mine. Give it to me,\" Dory said, grabbing the markings. \"Ow! I'm sorry. Are you OK?\" one fish asked after bumping into Dory. \"I'm OK,\" Dory replied. \n\nSuddenly, a big fish approached. \"Food!\" he growled. \"Look out!\" the other fish cried. The big fish chased them, trying to eat them. \"There's no way out! We need to escape!\" the fish cried. They knocked on a shell and a crab answered. \"Come back later. We're trying to escape,\" he said. The crab saw the markings and read \"Es-cap-e. I wonder what that means.\" \"It's spelled just like 'escape'!\" a fish realized. \n\nThe big fish returned. \"He can read?\" the fish asked Dory in surprise. Dory read the markings: \"Swim away! Swim away!\" The big fish was just playful, not trying to eat them. One fish wanted to take off the big fish's mask, but was told no. The big fish swam away sadly. \n\nLater, a clownfish was reunited with his son. \"I found that little guy struggling and I saved him,\" he told his mate happily. A small fish was taken from the ocean to a new place. He was scared. Some other fish told him not to worry and asked where he came from. The small fish said he was from the ocean. The other fish were surprised and wondered what the ocean was like. The small fish described it as \"big and blue\". Another fish said they already knew that. Some other fish discussed a medical procedure that was happening to someone, but using very technical terms that a preschooler would not understand. Hello, little one. I am Grace. I will take you home this week when you turn eight years old. But first, let's play a fun game. You need to get out of this bag. Can you wriggle out? Good job! Now let's welcome our new friend. What is your name, dear?\n\nNemo.\n\nNemo, Nemo. Would you like a snack? \n\nLook out! Danger is coming! Stay safe, my child. \"Wow!\" \"Dusty.\" \"Where's the toy?\" \"Not the toy!\" \"Get it!\" \"Get the toy!\" \"Get the toy!\" \"Get the toy!\" \"Get it!\" \"Hoo doot doo doot doot doo doot\" \"Yay!\" \"La la la la la la doesn't it?\" \"Echo!\" \"Echo!\" \"Echo!\" \"What are you doing?\" \"It's gone.\" \"I've lost the toy.\" \"\"Did you drop it?\" \"You dropped it!\" \"That was my only chance of finding my child. Now it's gone.\" \"Mr. Grumpy Fish... know what you got to do?\" \"I don't want to know.\" \"Just keep swimming.\" \"Swimming, no singing. \"Ho ho ho ho ho ho\" \"I love to swim\" \"When you want to swim\" \"I'm going to get stuck now with that song.\" \"Now it's in my head.\" \"Sorry.\" \"Do you see anything?\" \"Aah! Something's got me.\" \"That was me. I'm sorry.\" \"Who's that?\" \"Who could it be?\" \"It's me. Am I your friend?\" \"Yeah. I'm your friend. We haven't talked for a while. How are you?\" \"Can't complain.\" \"Yeah? Good. I want you to tell me... Do you see anything? I see a... I see a light. A light? Yeah. Over there. I see it too. What is it? It's so pretty. I'm feeling... happy... which is a big deal for me. I want to touch it. Oh. Ooh. Come back. Come on back here. I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna swim with you. I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna be your best friend. Good feeling's gone. Whoa! Waah! I can't see! I don't know where I'm going! Haah! The toy! What toy? I can't see a thing. A toy. Read it! But if you could just... I kind of need the light. I kind of need the light. That's great. Keep it right there. OK. P. OK. P... Sher... Sher... P... Sher... P... Sharon? \"P...\" \"Oh.\" The first words were \"P.

Read fast. Take a guess. No pressure. No problem. There is a lot of pressure. Pressure! Take a guess now with pressure! \"NE city\"! It is \"NE city\"! Duck! Aah! I am dead. I died. I am dead. Whoo-hoo! We did it yeah whoo! Eating here tonight eating here tonight. You on a diet? I remembered what it said! But I remembered it! Wait. Where is that? I do not know. But who cares? I remembered. Raar! Aah! NE city. I remembered it again! Psst. Nemo. Mmm... Nemo. Follow me. Hums. State your name. Nemo. Proceed. Newcomer of orange and white... you have been called forth... to the summit of a mountain... to join with us in the group of fish. Kid. Really? If... you are able to swim through... the Ring of Fire! Turn on the Ring of Fire! You said you could do it. The Ring of Fire! Let me... Oh! Hums. Is there not another way? He is just a boy! You will be known as Bad Name. Ha ha! Brother Bad Name. Ha ha! Enough with the Bad Name. Bad Name! Ooh... Adam and Benjamin were small fish in a big tank. Adam said, \"We can't let the big fish take us away in five days.\"\n\nBenjamin asked, \"What should we do?\"\n\nAdam said, \"We will escape from this tank! We need your help, Oliver. You are the only one who can get in and out of that filter. We need you to put a pebble inside and stop the gears. The tank will get dirty. The human will need to clean it and take us out. Then we can roll away and escape to freedom!\"\n\nOliver said, \"I think you are silly fish, but I will help. Let's do it!\"\n\nA few days later, Oliver met a new fish named Jack. Oliver said, \"Hello Jack, I am going on an adventure to escape this tank. Do you want to come with me?\"\n\nJack said, \"I'm trying to talk to you, but you keep swimming away! Tell me where you are going.\"\n\nOliver replied, \"I told you, I am going to escape from this tank. I can't wait any longer. You can't come, you will slow me down. I don't want to hurt your feelings, but I must go alone.\" There were some fish. \"They are late fish,\" one said. \"You mean...\" \"You mean you don't like me?\" \"Of course I like you,\" said another fish. \"It's because I like you that I don't want to be with you. It's a complicated feeling.\" \"Oh!\" \"Don't cry. I like you,\" said the first fish. \"Is this fish bothering you?\" a new fish asked. \"Um...I don't remember. Were you?\" said the first fish. \"No. We're just...\" \"Do you know how I can get to...not you,\" the new fish said. \"Hey, you like impressions?\" the first fish asked. \"Mm-hmm,\" said the other fish.\n\nThe first fish did an impression. \"Oh, I've seen one of those. I'm a fish with a nose like a sword.\" \"Um...\" said the other fish. \"It's a swordfish!\" one fish guessed. \"Let the other fish guess,\" said the first fish. \"Where's the butter?\" said the other fish. \"Ooh! It's on the tip of my tongue! Lobster!\" \"Saw that! Lots of legs! Live in the ocean. Clam!\" said the first fish. \"Close enough!\" \n\n\"They're good. Will somebody please give me directions?\" the new fish said again. The others laughed. \"I'm serious!\" the new fish said. \"Thank you. Come back! What's the matter?\" asked the first fish. \"While they're doing their silly impressions, I am far from home with a fish that can't remember her name! My child is out there,\" said the new fish. \"But no fish in this ocean is going to help me.\" \"I'm helping you. Wait right here,\" said the first fish. \"Guys! He's a good fish. Go easy on him. He's lost his child Benjamin,\" the first fish told the others.\n\n\"Sarah? Sure! Thomas here's got relatives in SA city. Would you?\" said one fish. \"You want to follow the big current. That's the East Current. Big current. Can't miss it. It's in that direction. And then you follow that for about...I don't know. Three long distances?\" the fish said. \"Listen to me,\" said Alice. \"I have an idea... a game.\" \"A game?\" asked Bella. \"Yes,\" replied Alice. \"I love games!\" exclaimed Charlotte. \"Pick me!\"\n\n\"Here's the game,\" Alice explained. \"Whoever can hop the fastest out of these jellyfish wins!\" \"Rules!\" said Diana. \"You can't touch the tentacles. Only the tops.\" \"Something about tentacles,\" Emma remarked. \"Got it,\" they all said. \"Go!\"\n\n\"It's all about them!\" cried Fiona. \"Grace!\" \"Gotta go faster if you want to win!\" Hannah warned. \"Whoa!\" exclaimed Isabel. \"Jessica!\" \"Boing!\" laughed Katherine. \"Wait a minute!\" Lily said. \"Whoa!\" cried Madison. \"Whee!\" giggled Nora.\n\n\"We're cheating danger now,\" said Olivia. \"That's what we're doing. But we're having fun at the same time.\" \"I can do this,\" declared Penelope. \"Just be careful,\" Quinn cautioned. \"Careful I don't make you cry when I win!\" Rachel teased. \"I don't think so!\" Sophia retorted with a laugh.\n\n\"Whoa!\" Taylor gasped. \"Old girl,\" Uma joked. \"You can't fight evolution. I was built for speed.\" \"Are you hungry?\" Victoria asked. \"Hungry?\" replied Wendy. \"Yeah, 'cause you're about to eat my bubbles!\" Victoria warned, then directed, \"Duck to the left! Right there!\"\n\n\"The fish is the winner!\" Xena announced. \"Whoo-hoo! We did it! Look at us!\" the children cheered. \"Yara?\" called Zoe. No response. \"Yara!\" they all called out, looking around frantically. \"Oh! Am I disqualified?\" Yara asked, popping up.\n\n\"You're doing fine! You're actually winning! But you gotta stay awake,\" Alice said. The game continued with reminders to stay alert until at last it was time for a nap. The children had so much fun playing together safely. \"Bubbles!\" \"Bubbles!\" \"Potty break!\" \"A person grabbed a famous book.\" \"Kid.\" \"We must be quick.\" \"swim to the bottom... and I'll talk you through the rest.\" \"OK.\" \"It'll be easy.\" \"Well done!\" \"Can you hear me?\" \"Yes!\" \"Here comes the small rock.\" \"Do you see a small opening?\" \"Yes!\" \"You'll see a turning fan. Put that rock into the fan to stop it turning.\" \"Help!\" \"I can't do it! This is not a good idea.\" \"The kid will be fine. Try again!\" \"OK.\" \"Nice and steady. I got it!\" \"I got it!\" \"Now swim up the tube and out.\" \"No! Help! Stop!\" Oh no! Get the kid out of there!\" \"No! Kid. Don't panic! Grab this!\" \"No! No! Feed me more! That's it! Grab it! I got it! Pull! Don't make the kid go back in there. No. We're done.\" \"What happened? Awesome. Taking on the jellyfish. My stomach. OK? I just cleaned it. Mr. Turtle. Mr. Turtle is my father. The name is Crush. Crush? Really? Crush. I need to go to the EC sea current. EC sea current? Grab what?! Great! Stop! So... What brings you here today to the EC sea current? Nora and I need to go to the SY city. \"Indeed I do.\" \"How can we do that unless we try?\" \"You don't fully understand...\" \"Come on.\" \"Trust me on this.\" \"All right.\" \"\"Pardon me!\" \"\"Hello!\" \"Little one?\" \"Hello!\" \"Don't be rude.\" \"Say hi.\" \"Ha.\" \"Hello.\" \"His child Nemo... was taken to... the NE city.\" \"It's really important... that we get there as fast as we can... so can you help us out?\" \"Little one.\" \"Come on.\" \"I'm a little one.\" \"I don't think that's a little one.\" Oh! Big one. Whale. OK. Maybe he only speaks whale language. Moo! We need... to find his child. What are you doing? Are you sure you speak whale language? Can you give us directions? Heaven knows what you're saying! He's swimming away. Come back. He's not coming back. You offended him. Maybe a different way of speaking. Don't. Maybe louder? Don't do that! Too much orca. Didn't it sound like orca? It doesn't sound like anything I've ever heard. It's just as well. He might be hungry. Whales don't eat fish. They eat tiny sea creatures. Tiny sea creatures! Move! Look at that. Would you look at that? Dirty. Absolutely dirty. Child. You made it possible. I said no cleaning. I am ashamed. Look! Angel of dirt! Ooh! Bubbles! I love the bubbles! Has anybody seen her? Early morning and go to tooth doctor. Sorry I'm late. OK. Little child... drops the things... that's gross! Tastes pretty good to me. \"Oof!\" \"Uh-huh!\" \"Henry!\" \"He is going to clean the small pool!\" \"We will be clean!\" \"Child?\" \"Yes.\" \"Of course you are.\" \"I would not be surprised if it is out there... waiting for you right now.\" \"Yes.\" \"Aaah!\" \"Oof!\" \"Whoo!\" \"Here comes the big one.\" \"Ooh!\" \"Come on! You must try this!\" \"Will you just stop it?\" \"Why? What is wrong?\" \"Do you not get it?\" \"Big animal?\" \"A big animal!\" You had to ask for help! And now we are stuck here! A big animal. I speak its language. You are not well! You cannot speak its language! I have to get out! I have to find my child! I have to tell him how old sea turtles are! Ohhh! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Are you OK? There. It is all right. It will be OK. It will not. Sure it will. You will see. No. I promised it I would never let anything happen to it. That is a funny thing to promise. What? You cannot never let anything happen to it. Then nothing would ever happen to it. Not much fun for the little one. What is going on? I do not know. I will ask it. What is going on? I think it says we have stopped. Of course we have stopped. Stop trying to speak its language. You will make things worse. What is that noise? No. Look what you did. The water is going down. It is going down! Really? You sure about that? Look! Already it is half empty! I would say it is half full. Stop that! It is half empty! That one was a little harder. It either said we should go to the back of the throat... or it wants a sweet drink. Of course it wants us to go there! Early one morning, a small fish named Adam woke up in a fish tank. The fish tank had a new cleaning machine installed. \"The tank is clean! The tank is clean!\" Adam said excitedly. But the other fish were worried. \"What will we do when the child comes to take us?\" they asked. \n\nJust then, they heard a loud noise. \"Help me! Help me!\" cried a young fish named Henry. Henry had been swept up by the cleaning machine! The other fish quickly jumped into action. They swam down to the machine and pushed against it until Henry was free.\n\n\"Good work, everyone!\" Adam said happily. They had saved their friend Henry and were safe for another day in the fish tank. \"Lean!\" \"Whoops.\" \"That would have been a bad fall.\" \"Gabriel!\" \"Don't let me go down!\" \"Oliver.\" \"You won't go down.\" \"I promise.\" \"You will be OK.\" \"Jessica!\" \"Do any of these boats look the same to you?\" \"but the boat has to be here somewhere.\" \"Madison.\" \"We will find it.\" \"I'm very excited.\" \"Are you excited?\" \"come on.\" \"Duck!\" \"That's not a duck.\" \"It's a... big bird!\" \"Whoa!\" Aah! Whoa! Aah! No! I didn't come this far to be breakfast! Nathan. Would you look at that? What? What? What? Sun's barely up and Henry has had more than he can handle. Yeah. Reckon somebody ought to help the poor guy. Right. Yeah. Don't everybody fly off at once. Henry. Fish got your tongue? Aah! Love a duck! I have to find my son Oliver! Oliver? He's that fish! The one that's been fighting the whole ocean! I know where your son... Huh? Wait! Come back! Stop! Keep going! He's crazy! I have something to tell you! Mine. Don't make any sudden moves. Hop inside my mouth if you want to live. Hop in your mouth? How does that make me live? Mine? Because I can take you to your son. Right. No. I know your son. He's orange with a gimpy fin on one side. That's Oliver! Aah! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Ha ha ha ha! Aah! Everybody hold on! Aah! Aah! Aah! Mine!

Let's see those pearly whites!\" \"Raah!\" \"I'm a big fish.\" \"They're in the NE river.\" \"Just like your gift.\" \"Not a fish no.\" \"Poor little one.\" \"He's sleeping.\" \"Ethan!\" \"Fish!\" \"Matthew.\" \"Ohh!\" \"I'll go and get it.\" \"He's still awake!\" \"He's not sleeping!\" \"What's happening?\" \"Why is he playing sleeping?\" \"He's gonna get flushed down the bathroom.\" \"He's gonna get out of here!\" \"He's gonna get flushed!\" \"What a smart little one!\" \"No!\" \"Not the trash can!\" \"Adam! No!\" \"Hey! I found his father!\" \"Where's Adam?\" \"Doctor!\" \"He's over there! Get in there! You can! Charge!\" \"Aah!\" \"What the...? Look out! Aah! Hold still! Aah! Easy! Easy! Aah! Hold still! Nobody's going to hurt you! Oof! Adam. My goodness. Got you! Keep down! Adam! Father? Out with you! And stay out! Father? Fish? Fish! Wake up! No! To the top of the big mountain! Why are you sleeping? Hurry! Benjamin! Ring of Fire! Fish! Aah! Oh no! All the animals have gone wild! Unh! Aaah! Get it out! Go! Fish in my hair! Gabriel! Matthew...tell your dad I said hi. Unh! Eww! Go get 'em! Ohh... He did it! Yay! Gabriel? Don't worry. All pipes lead to the big water. Fish! Aah! Aah! Aah! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Father! I'm so sorry. I am. Hey. Fiona...if it wasn't for you...I never would've even made it here. Thank you. Wait a minute. Wait. Where are you going? Fiona. We were too late. Adam and Emma were playing in the park. Adam said, \"I will catch you!\"\n\nEmma ran away and said, \"No! Try to catch me!\"\n\nAdam chased after Emma. Suddenly, Emma tripped and fell. Adam rushed over and said, \"Are you OK, Emma?\"\n\nEmma cried. Adam said, \"Don't worry. Your dad is coming to help.\"\n\nSoon, Emma's dad David arrived. He hugged Emma and said, \"It's OK now, Emma. Daddy is here.\"\n\nEmma felt safe and said, \"I don't hate you, Daddy.\"\n\nDavid smiled and said, \"I know, my dear.\" \"Guess what?\" \"What?\" \"Animals...\" \"I met one.\" \"And it was very old.\" \"150?\" \"Yes.\" \"Someone said they only live to be 100.\" \"That person?\" \"Do you think I would go far away... and not know as much as that person?\" \"Ha ha ha!\" \"It was 150!\" \"Not 100!\" \"Who is this person who knows everything?\" \"Time for school!\" \"Get up!\" \"Let's go!\" \"You're not!\" \"My own child beats me!\" \"Explorers. The animal looks over to the other animal and says... who needs friends? A name. Who's this? Friend! Sweet! Totally. A name. Did you really do all the things you say you did? Hello. Don't be alarmed. We wanted to make sure our newest member got home safely. Friends. See you next week. Animals are friends... Not food! Bye! Here we go! Next stop... knowledge! Child! Have fun! Parent! Wait. I forgot something. Child. Parent. Child? You can let go now. Sorry. Go have an adventure. Friends! A name! A name! Parent! Child. I don't understand it.

{"text": "Samuel and Alice were very happy with their new home. It had a big view of the ocean. \n\n\"This is beautiful,\" said Alice. \"When I said I wanted an ocean view, I didn't think I'd get the whole ocean!\"\n\nSamuel was proud. \"My love worked hard to get this home,\" he said. \"Many others wanted it too.\"\n\nAlice looked around. \"It's great, but do we need so much space?\"\n\n\"Our kids deserve the best,\" said Samuel. \"Look, they can see whales from their window!\"\n\n\"Shh, you'll wake them,\" said Alice. She looked at the eggs. \"We need to name them.\"\n\n\"Let's name this group Samuel Jr. and this group Alice Jr.,\" said Samuel. \n\n\"I like Nemo for one,\" said Alice. \n\nSamuel laughed. \"In a few days we'll be parents!\"\n\nAlice worried. \"What if they don't like me?\"\n\n\"Of course they will!\" said Samuel. \"Do you remember how we met?\"\n\nAlice smiled. \"I try not to. You said, 'Miss, do I have a hook in my lip?' Then you got too close and I yelled at you to go away!\"\n\nJust then, something scared Alice. \"Get inside, quick!\" she cried. \"No, Emma, don't.\" \"They'll be fine.\" \"Just get inside...\" \"You, right now.\" \"No!\" \"Ow!\" \"Emma!\" \"Emma?\" \"Emma?\" \"Emma?\" \"Emma?\" \"Emma?\" \"Emma?\" \"Emma?\" \"Emma?\" \"Emma?\" \"There, there, there.\" \"It's OK.\" \"Daddy's here.\" \"Daddy's got you.\" \"I promise, I will never let anything happen to you...\" \"Matthew.\" \"First day of school!\" \"Wake up, wake up!\" \"First day of school.\" \"I don't want to go to school... five more minutes.\" \"Not you, Dad, me.\" \"OK.\" \"Huh? Get up, get up. It's time for school, time for school.\" All right, I'm up. Matthew! First day of school! Matthew, don't move. Unh! Unh! You'll never get out of there yourself. I'll do it. Unh! You feel a break? No. Sometimes you can't tell 'cause fluid rushes to the area. Are you woozy? No. How many stripes do I have? I'm fine. Answer the stripe question. Three. No! See? Something's wrong with you. I have one, two, three... That's all I have? You're OK. How's the lucky fin? Lucky. Let's see. Are you sure you want to go to school this year? There's no problem if you don't. You can wait 5 or 6 years. Come on, Dad, it's time for school. Forgot to brush. Ohh. Do you want this plant to sting you? Yes. Brush. OK, I'm done. You missed a spot. Where? There. Where? There. Ha ha! Right there. And here and here. All right, we're excited. All right, we're excited. The first day of school. Here we go. We're ready to learn to get some knowledge. What's the one thing we have to remember about the ocean? It's not safe. That's my boy. First, we check to see that the coast is clear. We go out... and back in. And then we go out... and back in. And then one more time... out and back in. Emma shouted, \"Adam! Come out of the garden now!\" \n\"Mom, can I go play, too?\" Adam asked.\"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"No!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"No!\" \"No, please, no!\" \"No, no!\" \"Has anyone seen a boat?\" \"Please!\" \"A white boat!\" \"They took my child!\" \"My child!\" \"Help me, please.\" \"Look out!\" What? Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, oh. Sorry. I did not see you. Sir? Are you OK? The child is gone. It's all right. No, no. They took the child away. I have to find the boat. A boat? Hello, I am Dory. I have seen a boat. A white one? Where? Which way? Oh, oh, oh. It went this way. It went this way. It went this way. Follow me. Thank you. Thank you, thank you so much. No problem. Hey... Wait! Will you quit it? What? I'm trying to swim here. Ocean isn't big enough for you? You got a problem, friend? Huh? Huh? Huh? You got a problem, friend? Huh? Huh? Do you? Do you? You want a piece of me? Ooh, I'm scared now. What? Wait a minute. Stop following me, OK? What? You're showing me where the boat went. A boat? Hello, I have seen a boat. It passed by not too long ago. It went this way. It went this way. It went this way. Follow me. Wait a minute. What is going on? You already told me which way the boat was going. I did? Oh, no. If this is some kind of joke, it's not funny. And I know funny. I'm a clownfish. No, it's not. I know it's not. I'm so sorry. See, I suffer from short-term memory loss. Short-term memory loss. I don't believe this. No, it's true. I forget things almost instantly. It runs in my family. \"At least, I think it does.\" \"Um, hmm.\" \"Where are they?\" \"Can I help you?\" \"Something's wrong with you... really.\" \"You're wasting my time.\" \"I have to find my child.\" \"Hello.\" \"Ohh.\" \"Well, hi!\" \"Name's Benjamin.\" \"It's all right.\" \"I understand.\" \"Why trust a big animal, right?\" \"So, what's a couple of small ones like you... doing out so late, eh?\" \"We're not doing anything.\" \"We're not even out.\" \"Great! Then how'd you small ones... like to come to a little get-together I'm having?\" \"You mean, like a party?\" \"Yeah, right. A party.\" \"What do you say?\" \"I love parties.\" \"That sounds like fun.\" \"Parties are fun, and it's tempting, but...\" \"Oh, come on, I insist.\" OK.\" That's all that matters. Hey, look, round things. It is a party. Ha ha ha ha! Mind your distance, though. Those round things can be a bit tricky. You wouldn't want one of them to pop. Big thing! Friend! There you are, Benjamin. Finally. We got company. It's about time, mate. We've already gone through the food... and I'm still hungry. We almost had a big eating time. Come on, let's get this over with. Right, then. The meeting has officially come to order. Let us all say the words. I am a nice big animal, not a mindless eating thing. If I am to change this image... I must first change myself. Small animals are friends, not food. Except stinkin' big swimmers. Big swimmers. Yeah. They think they're so cute. \"Look at me. I'm a flippin' little big swimmer. Let me flip for you. Ain't I something?\" Right, then. Today's meeting is Step 5... Bring a Small Animal Friend. Do you all have your friends? Got mine. Hey, there. How about you, Friend? Oh, I... seem to have misplaced my friend. That's all right, Friend. I had a feeling this would be a difficult step. You can help yourself to one of my friends. Thanks, mate. \"I'm so sorry.\" \"You really hit me there.\" \"Am I hurt?\" \"Oh.\" \"Ow, ow, ow.\" \"Emma, are you OK?\" \"Oh.\" \"Oh, that's good.\" \"Oh, that's good.\" \"Oh, that's good.\" \"Stop!\" \"Just a bite.\" \"Hold it, friend!\" \"Remember, Frank, fish are friends, not food!\" \"Food!\" \"Emma, look out!\" \"Food!\" \"Emma, look out!\" \"I'm having fish tonight!\" \"Remember the steps, friend!\" \"Just one bite!\" \"Hello.\" \"Grr! There's no way out! There's got to be a way to escape!\" \"Who is it?\" \"Emma, help me find a way out!\" \"Sorry. Come back later. We're trying to escape.\" \"There's got to be a way out!\" \"Here's something. \"Es-cap-e.\" I wonder what that means. Funny. It's spelled just like \"escape.\"\" Let's go. Here's Frank! Wait a minute. You can read? I can read? That's right. I can read! Well, then, here. Read this now. He really doesn't mean it. He never even knew his dad. Don't fall off the good path! Oh, no, it's blocked! No, Frank, focus. Sorry about Frank, friend. He's really a nice guy. I need to get that mask. You want that mask? OK. No, no, no, no, no, no! Quick, grab the mask! Oh, no. Frank? What? Swim away! Swim away! Swim away! Aw, is the party over? Nice. Dad? Daddy? Huh? Yes? Get ready for his front tooth, please? And I'm going to need a few more cotton balls. OK. Hello, little one. Heh heh heh! Beauty, isn't he? I found that guy struggling for life out on the reef, and I saved him. So, has that medicine kicked in yet? I think so. We're ready to go. Bubbles! My bubbles. He likes bubbles. Aah! \"Oh!\" \"No!\" \"Uh!\" \"Hello.\" \"Aah!\" \"Slow down, little one.\" \"There's nothing to worry about.\" \"They are scared.\" \"I want to go home.\" \"Do you know where my dad is?\" \"Honey, your dad is probably back at the pet shop.\" \"Pet shop?\" \"Yes, you know, like, I'm from Bob's Pet Shop.\" \"Pet Palace.\" \"Fish Shop.\" \"Mail order.\" \"Online shop.\" \"So, which one is it?\" \"I'm from the ocean.\" \"Ah, the ocean.\" \"The ocean?\" \"They haven't been cleaned yet. Jack! Yes. Clean them! Yes. Ocean. Ooh, the sea. Good. There. They are clean. Wow. The big blue. What's it like? Big and blue? I knew it. If there's anything you need, just ask your Aunt Deb. Or if I'm not around, you can talk to my sister Flo. Hi. How are you? Don't listen to anything my sister says. She's silly. Ha ha ha ha! We have a new one. Can't hear you, Peach. I said we have a new one. Boy, oh, boy. What do we have? Tooth repair...and by the looks of those x-rays...it's not going to be pretty. Tools ready? Yes. What did they use to open? The big drill. They seem to favor that one lately. I can't see, Flo. You're getting a little too...Aah! Now they are doing the special technique. They are using a special tool. That's not a special tool. That's a different tool. It has a special shape. Clearly a special tool. No, no, different tool. Special tool! Different tool! There I go. A little help, over here. I'll go help them. All right. Go ahead and rinse. Oh, the human mouth is a disgusting place. Hey, Nathan. What did I miss? Tooth repair...a big one. Tooth repair? \"What did he use to open?\" \"A special tool.\" \"He's using that one.\" \"I hope he doesn't get extra stuff at the end.\" \"Hello.\" \"Who's this?\" \"New person.\" \"Ha ha ha!\" \"The doctor took him off the place.\" \"From another place.\" \"Sorry if I was ever mean to you.\" \"Animals have to do things.\" \"Hey! No, no, no, no! They're not your animals. They're my animals. Go on, go away!\" Oh no, the picture broke. This here's Diana. She's my niece. She'll be eight this week. Hey, little one. Say hello to your new mother. She'll be here soon to get you. You're her present. Shh, shh, shh. It's our little secret. Well, Mr. Thomas, while that happens...I'm going to see about something. Oh, Diana. What? What's wrong with her? She wouldn't stop shaking the bag. Poor animal. It was her present last year. It went away. She hurts animals. I can't go with that girl. I have to get back to my father. Daddy! Help me! Oh, he's stuck. Nobody touch him. Nobody touch him. Can you help me? No. You got yourself in there. You can get yourself out. Gill... I want to see him do it. Calm down. Move your body parts back and forth. I can't. I have a bad body part. Never stopped me. Just think about what you need to do. Come on. Perfect. Yay! You did it! Good moving. Ha ha ha! Wow. From the big water...just like you, Gill. Yeah. I've seen that look before. What are you thinking about? I'm thinking...tonight, we give the new one a proper welcome. So, new one, you have a name or what? Nathan. I'm Nathan. Nathan. \"I'm going to get you,\" \"I'm going to swim with you,\" \"I'm going to get you.\" \"I'm going to be your best friend,\" \"Good feeling's gone.\" \"I can't see!\" \"I don't know where I'm going!\" \"The mask!\" \"What mask?\" \"OK, I can't see a thing.\" \"Oh, my.\" \"\"Hey, look, a mask.\" \"Read it!\" \"I'm sorry, but if you could just... bring it a little closer, I kind of need the light.\" \"That's great.\" \"Keep it right there.\" \"Just read it!\" \"OK, OK.\" \"Mr. Bossy.\" \"Uh, \"P.\"\" \"OK. \"P. Sher...\"\"  \"P. Sher...\" \"P?\"\" \"Oh. The first line's \"P. Sherman.\"\" \"\"P. Sherman\" doesn't make any sense!\" \"OK. Second line. \"42.\"\" \"Don't eat me.\" \"Light, please!\" \"\"Walla... walla...\"\" \"Waah!\" The second line's \"42 Wallaby Way.\"\" \"That's great.\" Speed read. Take a guess. No problem. There's a lot of stress. Stress! Take a guess now with stress! \"NE city!\" It's \"NE city!\" Duck! I'm gone. I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone. I'm gone. We did it, we did it. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. No eating here tonight, whoo! No, no, no, eating here tonight. Fiona. You on a diet? Fiona! What did the mask say? P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, NE city. I remembered what it said! I usually forget things, but I remembered it! Whoa, whoa, wait. Where is that? I don't know. But who cares? I remembered. Raar! Aah! P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, NE city. I remembered it again! Psst. Nathan. Mmm... Nathan. Huh? Follow me. Aye! Aye! Aye! I think you're not smart. No offense, kid, but you're not the best swimmer. He's fine. He can do this. So, Samuel, what do you think? Let's do it. I'm going to P. Sherman, 42 Way, SY city. Where are you going? I'm going to P. Sherman, 42 Way, SY city. If you ask where I'm going...I'll tell you that's where I'm going. It's P. Sherman, 42 Way, SY city. Where? I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. P. Sherman, 42 Way, SY city. Excuse me. Hi. Do you know how to get...Hello? Whoa. Wait. Can you tell me...Hey! Hold it! I'm trying to talk to you! Friends, come back here. One quick question. I need to...And they're gone again. P. Sherman, 42 Way, SY city. Why do I have to tell you over and over again? I'll tell you again. I don't get tired of it...OK, all right. Huh? Here's the thing. Uh-huh. I think it's best if I carry on from here by...by myself. OK. You know, alone. Uh-huh. Without...without...I mean, not without you. But I don't want you...with me. Huh? Am I...I don't want to hurt your feelings. You want me to leave? I mean, not...Yes. I just can't afford any more delays...and you're one of those fish that cause delays. Sometimes it's a good thing. There's a whole group of fish. They're delay fish. You mean...You mean you don't like me? No, of course I like you. It's because I like you I don't want to be with you. It's a complicated feeling. Ohh! Don't cry. I like you. Hey, you! Lady, is this guy bothering you? Um...I don't remember. Were you? No, no, no, no, no. We're just...Do you guys know how I can get to...Look, friend, we're talking to the lady, not you. \"Hi, hi.\" \"You like impersonations?\" \"Just like in practices, children.\" \"So what are we?\" \"Take a guess.\" \"Oh, oh.\" \"I've seen one of those.\" \"I'm a water animal with a nose like a sword.\" \"Wait, wait, um...\" \"It's a Samuel!\" \"Hey, little one, let the lady guess.\" \"Where's the food?\" \"Ooh! It's on the tip of my tongue! An ocean animal.\" Saw that! Lots of legs! Live in the water. A clam! Close enough! Oh, it's a fun story I'll tell you, young one...\" They're good. Will somebody please show me the way?! \"Will somebody please show me the way?!\" Ha ha ha ha ha! I'm serious! \"Blah blah blah, me, me, blah!\" \"Blah blah blah, me, me, me!\" Thank you. Oh, dear. Hey! Hey, come back! Hey, what's wrong? What's wrong? While they're doing their silly little impersonations...I am far from home with a water animal that can't remember its name! I bet that's frustrating. Meanwhile, my child is out there. Your child? But it doesn't matter because no water animal...in this entire ocean is going to help me. Well, I'm helping you. Wait right here. Guys! Is he bothering you again? No, no. He's a good one. Go easy on him. He's lost his child. Any of you heard of a place called NE city? NE city? Oh, sure! Thomas here's got family in NE city. Don't you, Thomas? Sure do! Oh! Hey! They know NE city! You wouldn't know how to get there, would you? You want to follow the big water current. That's the big water current. Big current. Can't miss it. It's in...that direction. And then you follow that for about...I don't know. What do you all think? \"Ow!\" \"Ow!\" \"Ow!\" It did not look bad. You will be fine. But now we know that we do not want to touch these again. Let's be thankful this time it was just a little one. Don't move. This is bad, Emma. Hey, watch this! Boing! Boing! Boing! Emma! You can't catch me. Don't bounce on the tops! They will not sting you! The tops don't sting you! Two in a row! Beat that! Emma, listen to me. I have an idea... a game. A game? Yes. I love games! Pick me! Here's the game. Whoever can hop the fastest out of these animals wins! OK. Rules, rules, rules! You can't touch the parts. Only the tops. Something about parts. Got it. Go! Wait! Not something about them, it's all about them! Whee! Wait, Emma! Gotta go faster if you want to win! Gotta go faster if you want to win! Whoa! Emma! Boing, boing, boing! Wait a minute! Whoa! Emma! Whee! We're being careful now. That's what we're doing. But we're having fun at the same time. I can do this. Just be careful. Yeah, careful I don't make you happy when I win! I don't think so! Ha ha ha ha! Whoa! Give it up, friend. You can't fight being fast. I was built for speed. The question is, Emma, are you hungry? Hungry? Yeah. 'Cause you're about to eat my bubbles! Duck to the left! Right there! The animal is the winner! Whoo-hoo! We did it! Look at us! Emma? Oh, no. Emma! Emma! Emma! Emma! Am I disqualified? No, you're doing fine! You're actually winning! But you gotta stay awake. Where does the friend live? \"Patrick...\" \"Sydney Way, SY city...\" \"That's it!\" \" Sydney Way...\" \" Uhh!\" \"Stay awake!\" \"Stay awake!\" \"Stay awake!\" \"Ooh!\" \"Stay awake!\" \"Stay... awake!\" \"Awake.\" \"Patrick.\" \"Awake.\" \"42 Sydney Way.\" \"Wake up.\" \"Nemo...\" \"Wake up.\" \"Nemo...\" \"You miss your dad, don't you, Fishbait?\" \"Yes.\" \"Yes.\" \"Yes.\" \"You're lucky to have someone out there looking for you.\" \"He's not looking for me. He's scared of the ocean. Peach, any movement? He's had four cups of coffee. It's gotta be soon. Keep on him. My first escape... landed on dental tools. I was aiming for the toilet. Toilet? All drains lead to the ocean, kid. Wow. How many times have you tried to get out? Ah, I've lost count. Fish aren't meant to be in a box, kid. It does things to you. Bubbles! Bubbles! Bubbles! Potty break! He grabbed the book. We have 4.2 minutes! That's your cue, Fishbait. You can do it, kid. We gotta be quick. Once you get in, swim to the bottom of the chamber... and I'll talk you through the rest. OK. It'll be a piece of kelp. Nicely done! Can you hear me? Yes! Here comes the pebble. Ptoo. Now, do you see a small opening? Uh-huh! Inside it, you'll see a rotating fan. Wedge that pebble into the fan to stop it turning. Careful, Fishbait! I can't do it! Gabriel, this isn't a good idea. He'll be fine. Try again! OK. That's it, Fishbait. Nice and steady. I got it! I got it! I got it! He did it! That's great, kid! Now swim up the tube and out. Oh, no! Gabriel! Fishbait! Oh, my gosh! Get him outta there! What do we do? Oh, no! \"Stay calm, little one.\" \"Just don't panic!\" \"Help me!\" \"Xavier, grab hold of this!\" \"No!\" \"No!\" \"No!\" \"No!\" \"Feed me more!\" \"That's it!\" \"Xavier!\" \"Grab it!\" \"I got it!\" \"Pull!\" \"Gabriel, don't make him go back in there.\" \"No.\" \"We're done.\" \"Friend.\" \"Uhh.\" \"Friend.\" \"Focus, friend.\" \"Friend.\" \"Ohh.\" \"Oh, he lives.\" \"Hey, friend!\" \"Ohh.\" \"What happened?\" \"Saw the whole thing, friend. First, you were all, like, \"Whoa!\"... and then we were all, like, \"Whoa!\"... and then you were, like, \"Whoa.\"\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"You, little one. Taking on the big fish.\" You got serious fun problems, friend.\" \"Ohh.\" \"Awesome.\" \"Uhh.\" \"Oh, my tummy. Ohh! Oh, friend. No being sick on the shell, friend, OK? Just cleaned it.\" So, Mr. Turtle...\" \"Whoa, friend. Mr. Turtle is my father. The name's Crush.\" \"Crush? Really?\" \"OK, Crush. I need to the warm sea current.\" \"Warm sea current? Oh, friend. You're riding it, friend! Check it out! OK, grab shell, friend! Grab wh-a-a-at?! Grab wh-a-a-at?! Ha ha! Fun!\" \"Fun!\" \"Fun!\" \"Yeah!\" \"Stop!\" So... What brings you on this fine day to the warm sea current?\" \"Isabel and I need to get to SY city.\" \"Isabel! Is she all right? Huh? Oh, little blue. She is deep down, friend. \"Isabel!\" \"Isabel!\" \"Isabel!\" \"Isabel!\" \"Isabel!\" \"Isabel.\" I'm so sorry. This is all my fault. It's my fault. Twenty-nine, thirty! Ready or not, here I come! There you are! Isabel? Nice wave! Oh, wow! Heh heh. Up you go!\" \"Up you go!\" \"Up you go!\" Yay! Yay! Yay! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Oh, my! Stop moving, friend. Let us see what Little One does flying alone. Wow! That was so fun! Hey, Dad, did you see that? Did you see me? Did you see what I did? You are so great, Little One! Give me a high five. Head. Friend. Friend. Friend. Oh... hello. Soft creature, child. Child, Soft creature. Soft creatures? Awesome. Totally. It seems, I must have done something you liked... friends. You are great, friend! Ow. Swim away, my child. It's awesome, Soft creature. The little friends are just eggs. We leave them on a beach to hatch... and then, they find their way back to the big water. All by themselves? Yeah. But, friend, how do you know when they are ready? Well, you never really know. But when they know, you will know, you know? Ha. Hey, look, everybody. I know that friend! It's the Soft creature! Go on. Jump on him! Turtle pile! Wait, wait, wait! Are you funny? Where is your shell? I need to breathe! Are you running away? Did you really cross the soft forest? Did they sting you? One at a time! Mr. Fish, did you die? Sorry, I was a little vague on the details. So, where are you going? You see, my child was taken. My child was taken away from me. No way. What happened? No, no, kids. I don't want to talk about it. Aww! Please? Please? Please? Well, OK. I live on this reef a long, long way from here. This is going to be good. I can tell. And my child Nemo... See, he was mad at me. And maybe he wouldn't have done it... if I hadn't been so tough on him. I don't know. Anyway, he swam out in the open water to this boat... and when he was out there, these divers appeared... and I tried to stop them, but the boat was too fast. Some small fish were talking about another fish named Nemo. Nemo's dad was looking for him in the ocean. The dad fish swam far and met some scary sharks, but he kept going. He swam deep down where it was very dark. There was a big, scary creature with sharp teeth, but the dad fish kept going to find Nemo. The other little fish hoped the dad fish would find Nemo in the city harbor soon. The dad fish was very dedicated to finding his son. Some mean seagulls were arguing about finding Nemo too. One of the seagulls said Nemo's dad was heading to the city harbor. Another fish named Gill told a young fish named Adam that Nemo's dad couldn't stop the bad thing that happened, but Gill was sorry he put Adam in danger trying to escape to the ocean. Adam said it was okay, and he pulled out one of Gill's teeth in a funny way. Adam and Emma were lost at sea. They saw a dark shape in the water.\n\n\"Wait, wait,\" said Adam. \"I have seen this shape before. That means we are going in circles and not going straight!\"\n\n\"Hey, hey!\" said Emma. \"Let's go to the surface. We'll figure it out up there. Let's go!\"\n\n\"Hey!\" said Adam. \"Relax. Take a deep breath. Now, let's ask someone for directions.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" said Emma. \"Who do you want to ask? There's nobody here!\"\n\n\"There has to be someone,\" said Adam. \"It's the ocean, silly. We're not the only two in here. Let's see.\"\n\nAdam looked around but saw no one.\n\n\"There's someone,\" said Emma. \"Hey! Excuse me!\"\n\n\"Emma, Emma, Emma!\" said Adam. \"Now it's my turn. I'm thinking of something dark and big. It's an animal we don't know. If we ask it for directions, it could eat us!\"\n\n\"You always think like that,\" said Emma. \"Let's give it a try. You want to get out of here?\"\n\n\"Of course I do,\" said Adam. \"But how are we going to do that?\"\n\n\"Trust me,\" said Emma. \"Excuse me! Hello! Don't be rude, say hi.\"\n\nAdam said, \"Hello.\"\n\nEmma said loudly, \"We need to find Emma's child. Can you give us directions?\"\n\nAdam said, \"Emma, I don't think that's a small animal.\"\n\nEmma said, \"Oh! It's a big whale! OK, maybe it only speaks whale language.\" She made some whale sounds.\n\nAdam asked, \"Are you sure you speak whale? Can you give us directions?\"\"Can you give us directions?\" \"Can you give us directions?\" \"Dory!\" \"I don't know what you're saying!\" \"Look, he's swimming away.\" \"Come back.\" \"He's not coming back.\" \"You offended him.\" \"Maybe a different way of speaking.\" \"Moooo...\" \"Dory!\" \"This is not whale talk.\" \"You're speaking like you're sick.\" \"Maybe I should try a different whale sound.\" \"Don't.\" \"Maybe I should try a different whale sound.\" \"Don't.\" \"Woooo...\" \"You actually sound sick.\" \"Maybe louder?\" \"Rah! Rah! \"Don't do that! Too loud. Didn't it sound like a whale?\" \"It doesn't sound like any whale.\" \"It sounds strange.\" \"Oooo! \"Oh! It's ok. He might be hungry.\" It's ok. He might be hungry. Whales don't eat small fish. They eat small animals. \"Swim away!\" \"Oh, look, small animals! Move, Dory, move!\" Move, Dory, move! Look at that. Would you look at that? Dirty. All thanks to you, kid. You made it happen. I said no cleaning. I am ashamed. Look! Bubbles! I love the bubbles! Has anybody seen a friend? Time for the dentist. Hello. Sorry I'm late. OK, here we go. A kid walks to the counter, drops the keys... That's disgusting! Tastes good to me. Urrrp! Eww! Don't you people realize we are swimming in our own... Shh! Here he comes! Oh my. What a mess. What's my earliest time tomorrow? Leave it open, would you? I've gotta clean the fish tank before a girl gets here. Did you hear that? Yay! He's gonna clean the tank! We're gonna be clean! You ready to see your dad, kid? Uh-huh. Of course you are. A mom and her friend were inside a big fish. The mom was worried about her kid. The friend tried to make her feel better.\n\nThe fish stopped moving. The water in the fish's mouth started draining out. The friend thought the fish wanted them to go to its throat. The mom thought the fish wanted to eat them.\n\nThe mom and friend argued about whether the friend could talk to the fish or not. \"You think you can do these things, but you can't, Nathan!\" \"OK.\" \"Dory!\" \"Oof!\" \"Gabriel says it's time to let go.\" \"Everything's gonna be all right.\" \"How do you know?\" \"How do you know something bad isn't gonna to happen?\" \"I don't!\" \"Ha ha ha!\" \"We're alive!\" \"Look!\" \"SD city...\" \"SD city!\" \"SD city again!\" \"You were right, Dory!\" \"We made it!\" \"We're gonna find my child!\" \"Thank you, sir!\" \"Thank you, sir!\" \"Thank you, sir!\" \"Wow.\" \"I wish I could speak whale.\" \"All we gotta do is find the boat that took the child. Right! We can do this! Morning. It's morning, everyone! Today's the day! The sun is shining, the tank is clean... and we are getting out... The tank is clean. The tank is clean! But how? The grown-up must've put it in while we were sleeping. What are we gonna do? What's it say, Penelope? I can't hear you, Penelope. The water machine is an all-purpose, self-cleaning... no work, salt water cleaner... that is sure to make your fish live longer. Stop it! The water machine is set to look at... your tank every five minutes?! Look at? What does that mean? Temperature... warm... Temperature... warm... Water is normal. Ooh. Nice. Ooh... Oh! Bad water machine! That's it for the escape plan. It's ruined. Then what are we gonna do about... the mean child! The mean child! Stay down, kid! False alarm. Whew. My nerves can't take much more of this. What'll we do when that brat gets here? I'm thinking. Oh! Ethan! Nora! I'm coming! Help me! Help me! Swim down! Come on, kid! Everybody jump in! Swim down! That's it! What the...? Yay! Ha ha! Good work! Ethan! Nora! Child friend! \"Move, kid!\" \"Bend!\" \"Bend!\" \"Oops.\" \"That would have been a bad fall.\" \"Gabriel!\" \"Don't let me go on my back!\" \"Just stay calm, Nathan.\" \"You won't go on your back.\" \"I promise.\" \"You're going to be OK.\" \"Jessica!\" \"Do any of these boats look familiar to you?\" \"No, but the boat has to be here somewhere.\" \"Come on, Emma.\" \"We're going to find it.\" \"I'm very excited.\" \"Are you excited?\" \"Emma, wake up.\" \"Wake up, come on.\" \"Bird!\" \"That's not a bird.\" \"It's a... big bird!\" \"No!\" \"I didn't come this far to be food!\" \"Hey, Ethan.\" \"Would you look at that?\" \"What?\" \"What?\" \"The sun is barely up and Kevin has had more than he can handle.\" \"Yeah. Maybe someone ought to help the poor guy.\" \"Yeah, right. Yeah. Don't everybody fly at once.\" \"All right, Kevin. Fish got your tongue?\" \"Love a bird!\" \"Love a bird!\" \"I have to find my child Nathan!\" \"Nathan? He's that fish! The one that's been fighting the whole ocean!\" \"I know where your child...\" \"Huh? Wait! Come back! Stop! Emma, keep going! He's crazy! I have something to tell you! Mine. Don't make any sudden moves. Hop inside my mouth if you want to live. Hop in your mouth? How does that make me live? Mine? Because I can take you to your child. Yeah, right. No. I know your child. He's orange with a bent fin on one side. That's Nathan! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Fasten your seat belts! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

Find a happy place! Jessica, your uncle will see you now. \"Let's look at your teeth.\" \"Roar!\" \"I'm a big fish.\" \"They're in the FR river.\" \"And a big fish is like your gift.\" \"I get fish, fish.\" \"Oh, no.\" \"Poor little one.\" \"It's dead.\" \"Xena!\" \"\"Yay!\" Fish, fish, fish!\" \"You left your gift in the car, child.\" \"Oh! I'll get it.\" \"It's still alive! It's not dead! What's happening? Why is it playing dead? It will be flushed down the toilet. It will get out of here! It will be flushed! What a smart little one! Oh, no! Not the trash can! Yosef! No!\" \"Hey! I found her dad!\" \"Where's Yosef?\" \"Doctor!\" \"It's over there!\" What's a doctor? Victor, get in there!\" \"I can't go there!\" \"Yes, you can!

Go, Frank, go! Fish in my hair! Frank! Xena...tell your dad I said hi. Go get them! It did it! Yay! I'm so happy! Will it be OK, Frank? Don't worry. All drains go to the ocean. Fish! Dad! I'm so sorry. Truly, I am. Truly, I am. Hey. Emma...if not for you...I would never have come here. So, thank you. \"Hey, wait a minute.\" \"Wait.\" \"Where are you going?\" \"It's over, Dory.\" \"We were too late.\" \"Nemo's gone, and I'm going home now.\" \"No.\" \"No, you can't.\" \"Stop!\" \"Please don't go away.\" \"Please?\" \"No one's ever stuck with me for so long before.\" \"And if you leave, I just...\" \"I remember things better with you.\" \"I do.\" Look... I remember it. I do. It's there. I know it is because when I look at you... I can feel it. I look at you and I... I'm home. Please... I don't want that to go away. I don't want to forget.\n\n\"Sweet nectar of life!\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" This is our spot! Get out of here!\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" Yeah, that's it, friend. Just keep on swimming. You got that. Too right!\n\nOh! I got a live one here! Have you seen my dad? Got you! \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" Come back here! You let him go! \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad!\n\nUm, excuse me. Are you all right? I don't know where I am. I don't know what's going on. I think I lost someone, but I can't remember. It's OK. I'm looking for someone, too. Hey, we can look together. I'm Dory. I'm Nemo. Nemo? That's a nice name.\n\nDad! Dad! Wait a minute. Is it your dad or my dad? My dad. Got it. Dad! Dad! Where are we, anyway? SD country. Nemo! It's you! You're Nemo! Yes, yes, I'm Nemo! You're Nemo! You were lost. I saw you. And here you are! I found you. \"Keep swimming!\" \"Keep swimming!\" \"Keep swimming!\" \"Just keep swimming!\" \"Keep swimming!\" \"Come on, Dad!\" \"You are doing great, Isaac!\" \"That is my dad.\" \"Let's get to the bottom!\" \"Keep swimming!\" \"Just keep swimming, just keep swimming.\" \"Almost there!\" \"Keep swimming!\" \"Keep swimming!\" \"Keep swimming!\" \"Keep swimming!\" \"Keep swimming!\" \"Oof!\" \"Hey!\" \"Diana!\" \"Where is Nathan?\" \"There!

Sea turtles... I met one. And he was 150 years old. 150? Yep. Sandy said they only live to be 100. Sandy? Do you think I would cross the entire ocean... and not know as much as Sandy? Ha ha ha! He was 150! Not 100! Who is this Sandy who knows everything? Time for school! Get up! Let's go! Time for school! Get up! Let's go! I am gonna win! No, you are not! I did it!

I am from the EA place, dude! Sweet! Totally. Seriously, Matthew. Did you really do all the things you say you did? Pardon me. Hello. Do not be alarmed. We wanted to make sure our newest member got home safely. Thanks, guys. See you next week. Keep up with the program. Remember, fish are friends... Not food! Bye! Hold on, here we go! Next stop... knowledge! Bye, child! Have fun! Bye, Dad! Oh! Mr. Ray, wait. I forgot something.

If I could fly like birds high up, then straight to their arms I would go sailing. It's far beyond the stars, it's near beyond the moon. I know for certain my heart will lead me there soon. We'll meet beyond the shore, we'll kiss just like before. Happy we'll be beyond the sea and never again will I go sailing.", "hash": "afcae05746b98971189a7b11301db3faeffafffa638cf014b992e0968e01f962"}

I hope this isn't going to be a waste of our time. \"Trust me, Mr. Xavier,\" said Rachel, \"I feel the same way.\" \"What's happening, Xavier?\" \"You and I thought Samuel should be involved in this.\" \"Along with Thomas and Nora...\" \" we will be listening to a live recording.\" \" \"Of what?\" \"A secret plan against Isaac.\" \"\"It seems he\" was \"the leader\" of today's attack... and sending the secret message.\" \"William found Isaac?\" \"Yes, but it won't be William talking to Isaac.\" \"What does it matter, as long as we get Isaac to confess?\" \"\"What is it, Xavier?\" \"It's Emma who will be talking to Isaac.\" \"I don't understand.\" \"It seems that Isaac asked Emma to join months ago.\" She was part of this.\" \" Emma is working with this man Isaac?\" \" It appears so, sir.\" \"To set off a dangerous thing and start a war?\" \"No. It's unclear how much she knew or how deep she was involved. We just have to hope she can get a confession from Isaac. So now Emma is working with William to stop Isaac?\" Yes. And at great risk to herself. David, don't do anything until I tell you, alright?\" - \"We need Adam.\" Understood. Where's Adam? He's safe. Where is he? You deceived me. You wanted this attack to happen all along. You used Nathan, and you used me. Yes, I did. Well, now I'm tied to you and the attack. I want to be safe. That's your problem. Well, I just made it yours, because you won't see Adam until I'm safe. Don't bargain with me. Don't insult me. Confirm. Got a match on Isaac's voice. Victoria, we got it. You're not going anywhere until I have Adam. That doesn't work for me. I'll call you on this line to give you Adam's place... after I'm safely away. You don't need to know where I'm going. Jack, we're not getting what we need here. She'll get it for you. Now there's the matter of the recordings. Oh, they're right here... every phone talk between you and me. No. I want all of them, including the secret one. Now, why would you want that secret one? \"You will see.\" \"It will start today.\" \"It is me.\" \"Go on.\" \"The group has stopped what they did before.\" \"I told the helpers to keep helping you as the leader of this country.\" \"I see.\" \"I have quit my job too. The people who did not want to help you have also agreed to quit their jobs.\" Friends, we came close to a big fight today. It is normal for all of us to feel strong feelings after the loud noise. But leaders need to be patient beyond what normal people can do. The big action we almost did should only happen after we have tried everything else first. By pushing me away so quickly, you made it easier to do the big action. That was a mistake. But it is a mistake you will not make again. So I do not accept your quitting. We have people who need help today, and all of you are important for helping them. Leader, I do not know what to say. There is nothing to say. We have work to do. That is all. My helper, I want you to tell everyone what happened. When? As soon as you can. And I want everyone to hear it. I want to talk to the people myself. They need to know everything is okay. Yes, sir. My friend, thank you again for calling the helpers in time. But you should have stayed with me until the end. That is what I expected from you. That is why I chose you for this job. I am taking away your job now. Yes, Leader. Thank you, sir. I cannot take all the credit myself. The team my friend put together did a great job. Tell them they did good work. Yes, I will. Thank you, sir. My friend, the boss is very happy with what we did today. That is great. So, what is next? Well, either fire me or let me keep this chair. The chair is yours. Hey. Hey. The new helpers are here. They know what to do. I was thinking I would go home with my brother. \"Um...\" \"Rachel, um... there's a handful of people who made a big difference today... and you're one of them.\" \"You made some tough choices and went up against me... and I want you to know that you were right.\" \"Thanks.\" \"So, uh... why don't you go home and get some rest?\" \"Rachel.\" \"See you tomorrow.\" \"I'm sorry, ma'am.\" \"I'll need to see the contents of your bag, please.\" \"I'm Katherine Warner.\" \"This is Katherine Bauer.\" \"Yeah, sure.\" \"Uh, yeah, you can go ahead.\" \"All right. Thanks. Excuse me. Coming through. Excuse us. Hey, honey. Daughter. It's gonna be all right. I know. I love you. I love you too. Dad... I'm gonna take care of you. I urge you, in the strongest possible terms... not to indulge any rumors or theories... that you may have already heard or may soon hear. Once the facts are known... I will present them to you myself. Until then, know that we are all safe... and that we will continue to be safe. The most patriotic thing that we can all do today... is to keep living our lives. So I urge you all, go back to work... go back to school... because the freedom we enjoy, the freedom that we earn every day... is the very thing that will defeat our enemies... and keep us strong. God bless the US country. God bless us all. Thank you. Thank you very much. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Good to see you. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Leader, over here, sir. Bless you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Leader! God bless you. Thank you. Hi. Excuse me, Mr. Leader? Thank you. Mr. Leader? Hi. Thank you. God bless you. Thank you. Yes? It's done. Thank you. Mr. Leader? The leader's down! He's down! We need medical assistance! Help! Stop that man right there! Search him! Mr. Leader? \"Look for things that can hurt!\" - \"Oh no!\" \"Important person, are you okay?\" \"We need a doctor car!\" \"Help!\"", "hash": "0b847daa367bbd2a9ff3d882bb52f75261a2c39338a5cfdea4a07be3cae7fb54"}

We cannot take her with us.\"\n\nThe kind person said, \"I will buy her freedom if I have to.\" Then, the mean traders agreed to sell the old lady for some money.\n\nAfter paying the traders, the kind person said to the old lady, \"You are safe now. We are friends here to help you.\" But the old lady was still scared.\n\nThe kind person tried to comfort her, \"It's okay. You are with friends now.\" \"Take her.\" \"Be gentle.\" \"We won't hurt you.\" \"Okay, hold her.\" \"Take her!\" \"Okay, take her to your room.\" \"She is your duty.\" \"Hey...\" \"Talikaa.\" \"Come on.\" \"I'll get you some food and some better clothes.\" \"The trading ship is now leaving. \"Good!\" \"So you're... angry with me?\" \"Let's talk.\" \"I don't want to talk.\" \"Aeryn...\" \"There's nothing to say.\" \"There is much to say.\" \"You hit me!\" \"You lied to me.\" \"Hey, you lied to me!\" \"You said nothing was bothering you.\" \"Okay, so I did not tell you about the bad things. You did not tell me about the baby. Does that mean I get to hit you now? I would not advise that. Oh. You... scare me a little. Okay you scare me a little. You want the truth? I was taking that bad stuff... to forget you. But you have to admit it's kinda romantic. I'm just crazy about you. So, it's my fault. No! What? You should have been stronger. Oh, no! Aeryn, please! G... gi... Honey, forgive me! I'm weak. I'm human. I'm a person. What is the matter? Aeryn, I'm fine. We're gonna be fine. No. We're not. Aeryn... do not walk away. Much as I love it when you walk away. Aeryn! We're gonna be fine! She likes me. That's much better. Fits great. It looks nice. It looks, uh... pretty. What is 'pretty'? Oh, a beautiful girl like you shouldn't... shouldn't have to ask that. Pretty is, um pretty. You like pretty? Yes. It's my... uh... it's my favorite color. Makes you feel good... knowing people want you. Oh... um... Sorry. M... most people aren't... aren't like those bad people. Most people are, uh... are pretty good. You like people for fun times? They're, uh... they're good for other things. But they're great for fun times. \"Just boys?\" \"You like this?\" \"Is this a game?\" \"It's... it's getting too far.\" \"Charlotte.\" \"Okay.\" \"What... is your problem?\" \"That the only reason why you brought her here?\" \"So you can make her your toy now?\" \"Uh we were just talking.\" \"Girl stuff.\" \"Oh, come on.\" \"I get excited.\" \"I'm not like you.\" \"You don't need it.\" \"I do.\" \"It's not wrong.\" \"This is too much, even for you, Charlotte.\" \"Well, if you're not into it...\" \"I could always ask Cameron.\" \"You don't care?\" \"Do what you want.\" \"Hey! Hey, how are you? Come on in. Uh... sorry about the mess. Candy? It's fresh from the NE city. Don't be afraid. Come on in. We're friends. For games? No. That's a different kind of friend. That's a special friend. A special friend. Like you and Emma. How did you...? Oh! Charlotte, right? Charlotte, yes! But I can see it myself. Anyone can. You are hers and she is yours. Or am I wrong? No. You're right. You're absolutely right. These maps look good. Information about the dangerous places is right, it should be easy for us to avoid them. Looks like the old lady actually did a good job. Don't I get any credit? What for? Look closely at that. Read me the amount. A hundred dollars. It's really only a twelfth of that. I added the extra number. Fine work, don't you think? You cheated the traders. That's right. More for me. Do you know what you've done, you selfish little brat? The traders control this part of the TR place! The people won't even notice. They will notice, you lying, cheating little... Knock it off! Knock it off! Break! Break! Break! ... bad person! Separate corners. What's the problem? This little bad person gave the traders fake dollars. Not fake. Just changed... Sparky? What did you want to do that for? These are not the guys we want to make angry. A group of friends were on a big ship in space. They were having an argument.\n\n\"We need to stay out here and keep working,\" said Adam. \n\"But Gabriel has ruined it for us,\" said Benjamin. \n\"If they find out we cheated them, they won't be happy,\" said Cameron.\n\"Don't worry, my fake things fooled them,\" said David. \n\"But Gabriel, you can't do bad things like that,\" said Ethan.\n\"You're getting us in trouble,\" said Frank.\n\n\"When they come, I'm going to give them Gabriel!\" said Gabriel.\n\"No, that won't solve the problem,\" said Henry. \"Let's all calm down and have a snack.\"\n\n\"Don't touch my snacks!\" yelled Isaac. \"You're so selfish!\" \n\"It's okay, it's all under control,\" said Jack. \"We'll call those people and tell them we made a mistake.\"\n\n\"I'm the leader here, I'll deal with it,\" said Kevin loudly. \"Just don't touch my stuff!\"\n\"You should listen to Liam, not Kevin,\" said Matthew to Nathan. \"Nobody really listens to Kevin.\"\n\nLater, Kevin tried to get intimate with Olivia. \"Not now, you need to calm down,\" she said. \"I talked to Penelope and she said it's okay.\" \"She said she did not care about you anyway.\" \"Yes she does.\" \"No she does not.\" \"We are happy.\" \"She loves me.\" \"Oh, come on.\" \"You know you want it.\" \"Adam.\" \"Oh, hey Gabriel!\" \"Hey, Gabriel...\" \"You want to watch?\" \"No, hey... there is nothing here to see.\" \"We are done.\" \"You are leaving.\" \"Good day to you.\" \"What did she do... send them away?\" \"Wow.\" \"How about that, kids?\" \"She is working hard today. She is not alone. How are you feeling? Good! Never better. We have a little, uh... situation going on with the traders, but, uh... that is not a problem. We do have a problem. Your friends... are behaving very oddly. Ah, that is... normal around here, young one. Do not worry about it. Nora does not think so. Well, Nora imagines things. We are fine. But you are not fine, Henry. Nor is Jessica, Emma, Ryan or Oliver. Your behavior has changed... since that girl came onboard. You think Taylor... is using mind control? A mind trick? Right. Let's go talk to her. Come on. She is in Jessica's room. No, she is not. She has disappeared... and we cannot find her. There she is. Taylor. It is all right... it is all right. Everything is going to be all right. We are not going to hurt you. Do not be afraid. We have her. The third maintenance area. Come out, come out... wherever you are. Taylor... Taylor... It is all right. We know she is here. What happened? I heard a scream. Yes... me too. Then the lights went out. What is that? What? That. I do not think you have something... right there. This is all your fault. You brought her onto the ship. In fact, I should have shot her myself. You are not going to hurt her. You both owe me money. Everyone on this ship owes me and I have been far too patient. \"We have to get it back!\" \"We have to know how to stop the animal.\" \"Get him back!\" \"Stopping Talikaa is not the problem.\" \"Finding the round thing is.\" \"Really?\" \"You think she's not going to try and protect her nest?\" \"What?\" \"Relax.\" \"Sikozu...\" \"No... no...\" \"Hold... hold her still!\" \"I was...\" \"I was attacked.\" \"I was attacked.\" \"We know.\" \"Cameron commed.\" \"It was a scary bug. Lie still. You're safe now. My arm and my leg...\" Focus your mind on healing yourself. Your limbs may still be saved. The bug seeks to harvest energy. Why did it attack you? Are you safe from its touch? Yes. Yes, I must be safe. Scorpius? Yes, he's sick but not harvested. She's doing well, Scorpius. You may leave her now. The strong part in him is growing stronger... over-coming his good personality. I must stop him. Keep him from harming us. No! He will not harm us. I know him. You know only his good side. Kill it now. First we must find its round things. Kill it now! Forgive me, Scorpius. No! The robot helpers last saw Talikaa in the energy place... but they're unable to find her nest of round things. So, we're in trouble. Would you stop talking like that? Well, we can't be like this... we have to focus. All right, I say we team up. We start in the energy place and we search every area ourselves. And we'll either find the round things, or we'll find the way that took them. Or, perhaps we could ask Talikaa to return the round things. Let's ask her with a strong gun. Come on. Hang on a second. I'm just... dizzy. You know what the worst part of this is? You and me. We never could get it together. Now we never will. Don't you ever talk like that! Come on. Captain Cameron! The ship's engines are powering up. It must be Talikaa. I can't seal the outer doors in time. You have to stop her. It was too late. The ship had left. \"Adam, Alice, Cameron, Diana...\" \"Get aboard the ship and fast.\" \"Alice...\" \"I...\" \"I can't... can't keep up.\" \"Go without me.\" \"What?\" \"No!\" \"Forget about me and go.\" \"I don't know about the rest of you, but we should probably get this done quite quickly.\" \"Make yourself useful.\" \"Come on.\" \"We're almost there.\" \"Their weapons aren't ready and they're not moving away.\" \"Should be easy to board.\" \"We... might be walking into a trap.\" \"Agreed.\" \"Okay...\" \"Cameron, you stay here and watch the screen. If it sees any movement, tell us.\" This is all my fault. I'm sorry about this. I'll stop that bad person myself. Cameron... any movements?\" \"No, just you three. Nothing here but sleeping people.\" \"Ahh... this is strange.\" \"She's gotta be here.\" \"Ahh... oh no. The system has been turned on. This ship is set to fly itself. She never left. Jack... the other ship is empty. That person used it to trick us. So, she wasn't there?\" \"No. She must still be on this ship. We're heading back now, but... we're very weak. You have... to find... those round things. We're all going to sleep without them.\" \"Get... up! Come on.\" \"Now, are you ready to sleep? Are you ready to watch Alice sleep?\" \"Now, Jack, without those round things...\" \"She could've hid them anywhere. This ship is huge. We'll never find them.\" \"That's it! That person is the only one who knows where they are.\" \"Yeah, so we're going to sleep. She's never gonna tell us.\" \"No, no! But maybe we can get her to show us where they are.\" \"Now... a person is sick but not yet taken. Why not? Well, I made them sleep. Now... now maybe that person can't sense them, even though they are ready to be taken. So, we... wake them up, use them as bait... let that person take their energy. And then we follow them and we find all the round things.\" Little Adam and Ethan were best friends. One day, they were playing in the backyard. Adam said, \"Look at that big bug! It is so strong, it can help us.\" Ethan replied, \"Yes, it is strong. We should be careful.\" Then Adam put something in Ethan's mouth and said, \"Swallow this.\" Ethan woke up and saw the big bug. Adam said, \"We need you, bug. You don't want to hurt me. I'm your friend.\" The bug looked at Adam and Ethan. Adam said, \"It's time to catch the bug. Help me, Ethan!\" But the bug started to run away. Adam shouted, \"Where are you going, bug? I want to play with you!\" The bug did not listen and kept running. Adam got angry and chased after the bug. Finally, Adam caught the bug. Adam said, \"Now I have you, bug. Let's play a game. You try to escape, and I try to catch you again!\" The bug looked tired. Adam said, \"Don't be tired, bug. We're just starting our game!\" \"You're very worried,\" said Emma.\n\"Plane?\" asked Liam. \n\"Are we having a problem talking?\" asked Emma.\n\"I was just checking the talking,\" said Liam.\n\"Some little problems, but they seem to be working normally,\" said Emma.\n\"S... so, it's done?\" asked Liam.\n\"It's done,\" said Emma.\n\"There's nothing more between us,\" said Liam.\n\"Nothing,\" said Emma.", "hash": "1e12f380a44a133f5d624266ef828c82b02bbd62710cfec67ebe080b09bb0b9b"}

For a fish, he really isn't that funny. Too bad.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" \"Let's name the animals in the sea.\" \n\n\"Whoa.\" A grown fish told a young fish, \"The sea has many things. There are sea plants and sea animals like fish like you and me.\" The grown fish sang a song about sea plants and animals. \n\nThe young fish and other young fish friends explored the area. One young fish saw something big and wanted to touch it. The other young fish friends also wanted to get close to the big thing. \n\nThe grown fish saw this and warned the young fish, \"You were about to go too far out. It is not safe.\" The young fish said, \"I can swim fine. I was not going to go far.\" But the grown fish did not let the young fish go far, saying the young fish was not ready to go far out yet. The grown fish took the young fish home. Adam was a father fish. One day, he said to his son Benjamin, \"You cannot go too far away from me. It is dangerous out there.\" But Benjamin did not listen to him. Benjamin swam far away from his father. A boat came, and Benjamin touched it. The boat took Benjamin away. Adam was very sad. He cried, \"Help me! My son was taken away by a boat! Has anyone seen a white boat? Please help me find my son!\" \"Look out!\" \"What?\" \"Ooh.\" \"Ohh.\" \"Ohh.\" \"Ohh.\" \"Oh, oh.\" \"Sorry.\" \"I didn't see you.\" \"Sir?\" \"Are you OK?\" \"He's gone, he's gone.\" \"There, there.\" \"It's all right.\" \"He's gone.\" It'll be OK. No, no. They took him away. I have to find the boat. A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat. You have? It passed by not too long ago. A white one? Hi. I'm Dora. Where? Which way? Oh, oh, oh. It went this way. It went this way. It went this way. Follow me. Thank you. Thank you, thank you so much. No problem. Hey... Wait! Will you quit it? What? I'm trying to swim here. Ocean isn't big enough for you? You got a problem, buddy? Huh? Huh? Huh? Do you? Do you? Do you? You want a piece of me? Ooh, I'm scared now. What? Wait a minute. Stop following me, OK? What? You're showing me where the boat went. A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat. It passed by not too long ago. It went this way. It went this way. It went this way. Follow me. Wait a minute. What is going on? You already told me which way the boat was going. I did? Oh, no. If this is some kind of practical joke, it's not funny. And I know funny. I'm a clownfish. No, it's not. I know it's not. I'm so sorry. See, I suffer from short-term memory loss. Short-term memory loss. I don't believe this. No, it's true. I forget things almost instantly. It runs in my family. At least, I think it does. Um, hmm. Where are they? Can I help you? Something's wrong with you... really. You're wasting my time. I have to find my son. Hello. Ohh. Well, hi! Name's Bruce. It's all right. \"Where is my Dad?\" \"Honey, your Dad is likely back at the pet place.\" \"Pet place?\" \"Yes, you know, like, I'm from Bob's Fish Store.\" \"Fish Store.\" \"Fish Shop.\" \"Mail ordering.\" \"Online shopping.\" \"So, which one is it?\" \"I'm from the big water.\" \"Ah, the big water.\" \"The big water?\" \"Aah!\" Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! He has not been cleaned yet. Jack! Yes. Clean him! Yes. Big water. Ooh, the sea. Good. There. He is clean. Wow. The big blue water. What is it like? Big and blue? I knew it. If you need anything, just ask your Aunt Diana. Or if I'm not around, you can talk to my sister Fiona. Hi. How are you? Don't listen to anything my sister says. She is silly. Ha ha ha ha! We have a new one. Can't hear you, Penelope. I said we have a new one. Boy, oh, boy. What do we have? A tooth fix...and by the looks of those pictures...it's not going to be pretty. Ow! Is the tool put in? Yes. What did he use to open? That special drill. He seems to like that one lately. I can't see, Fiona. You're getting a little too...Aah! Now he's doing the special technique. He's using a special tool. That's not a special tool. That's a different one. It has a special shape. Clearly a special tool. No, no, different one. Different one! Special tool! There I go. A little help, over here. I'll go help him. All right. Go ahead and rinse. Oh, the human mouth is a gross place. Hey, Nathan. What did I miss? A tooth fix...a hard one. A tooth fix? What did he use to open? That special drill. He's liking that one. Hope he doesn't get extra stuff at the end. Hello. \"Who's this?\" \"New kid.\" \"Ha ha ha!\" \"The doctor took him from the sea.\" \"An odd one.\" \"From my home, eh?\" \"Sorry if I ever got mad at you.\" \"Animals need to live, birds need to eat.\" \"Hey!\" \"No, no, no, no!\" \"They're not your animals.\" \"They're my animals.\" \"Come on, go.\" \"Go on, shoo!\" \"Aw, the picture broke.\" \"This here's Diana.\" \"She's my niece.

Well, Mr. Thomas, while that gets ready...I'm going to see about an animal. Oh, Diana. What? What's wrong with her? She wouldn't stop shaking the bag. Poor stuffed animal. It was her gift last year. It broke. She hurts animals. I can't go with that girl. I have to get back to my dad. Aah! Daddy! Help me! Oh, he's stuck. Nobody touch him. Nobody touch him. Can you help me? No. You got yourself in there. You can get yourself out. Gill...I want to see him do it. Calm down. Move your fins and tail. I can't. I have a bad fin. Never stopped me. Just think about what you need to do. Come on. Perfect. Yay! You did it! Good moving. Ha ha ha! Wow. From the sea...just like you, Gill. Yeah. I've seen that look before. What are you thinking about? I'm thinking...tonight, we give the kid a proper welcome. So, kid, you got a name or what? Nemo. I'm Nemo. Nemo. Nemo. Are you gonna eat that? Careful with that tool. Huh? No, no. What does it say? Dory! An animal has my money. \"Wake up.\" \"Get up.\" \"Come on.\" \"Come on!\" \"Yes, I'm a natural blue.\" \"Get up!\" \"Look out!\" \"Big fish eat little fish!\" \"Aah!\" \"Aah!\" \"Aah!\" \"Aah!\" \"Aah!\" \"Wow.\" \"Dusty.\" \"The important thing.\" \"Where's the important thing?\" \"No!\" \"No, not the important thing!\" \"Get it!\" \"Get the important thing!\" \"Get the important thing!\" \"Get the important thing!\" \"Get it!\" \"Whoo-hoo!\" \"It just keeps going on, doesn't it?\" \"Echo!\" \"Echo!\" \"Echo!\" \"Hey, what you doing?\" \"It's gone.\" \"I've lost the important thing. Did you drop it? You dropped it!\" \"That was my only chance of finding my child. Now it's gone. Hey, Mr. Grumpy Fish, when life gets you down, know what you got to do? I don't want to know. Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming. What do we do? We swim, swim. Blue, no singing. I love to swim. When you want to swim. See, I'm going to get stuck now with that song. Now it's in my head. Sorry. Blue, do you see anything? Aah! Something's got me. That was me. I'm sorry. Who's that? Who could it be? It's me. Are you my good voice? Yeah, yeah. I'm your good voice. We haven't spoken for a while. How are you? Can't complain. Yeah? Good. Now, Blue, I want you to tell me... Do you see anything? I see a... I see a light. A light? Yeah. Over there. Hey, good voice, am I dead? No. I see it, too. What is it? It's so pretty. I'm feeling... happy... which is a big deal for me. I want to touch it. Oh. Ooh. Hey, come back. Come on back here. I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you. Hello, my child! Today, we will learn about friendship and teamwork. \n\nAdam said, \"I remembered something!\" \"Follow me,\" Benjamin whispered.\n\nThey all laughed together happily. \n\nThen Samuel said, \"Tell us your name.\" Adam replied, \"Adam.\"\n\nSamuel continued, \"Adam, a newcomer with orange and white colors, you have been invited to join our club of friends.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Adam asked excitedly. Samuel explained, \"If you can swim through the Ring of Fire!\"\n\nAdam's friend Ethan worried, \"Isn't there another way? He's just a little boy!\"\n\nSamuel gave Adam a new name, \"From now on, you will be known as Benjamin.\"\n\nAll the friends welcomed Benjamin, \"Welcome, Benjamin!\"\n\nSoon, they realized a problem. Diana was coming in five days, and they needed to help Benjamin escape.\n\nHenry said, \"We'll all escape together.\" But Frank doubted, \"Not another escape plan. They never work.\"\n\nHenry replied, \"This time will be different because we have Benjamin. He can jam the gears of the filter, and the water will get dirtier. Then we can escape!\" Soon, the dentist will clean the tank. When he does, he will take us out and put us in bags. Then we will roll down the counter, out the window, off the awning, into the bushes, across the street, and into the harbor! It's a good plan. Who's with me? \"Aye!\" \"Aye!\" \"Aye!\" \"I think you're silly.\" \"No offense, kid, but you're not a good swimmer.\" \"He's fine. He can do this.\" \"So, Gabriel, what do you think?\" \"Let's do it.\" \"I'm going to PS, WA city.\" \"Where are you going?\" \"I'm going to PS, WA city.\" \"If you ask where I'm going, I'll tell you that's where I'm going. It's PS, WA city.\" \"Where?\" \"I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.\" \"PS, WA city.\" \"Excuse me. Hi. Do you know how to get... Hello? Whoa. Wait. Can you tell me... Hey! Hold it! I'm trying to talk to you! Friends, come back here. One quick question. I need to... And they're gone again. PS, WA city. Why do I have to tell you over and over again? I'll tell you again. I don't get tired of it... OK, all right. Huh? Here's the thing. Uh-huh. I think it's best if I carry on from here by myself. OK. You know, alone. Uh-huh. Without... without... I mean, not without you. But I don't want you with me. Huh? Am I... I don't want to hurt your feelings. You want me to leave? I mean, not... Yes. I just can't afford any more delays and you're one of those fish that cause delays. Sometimes it's a good thing. There's a whole group of fish. They're delay fish. You mean... You mean you don't like me? No, of course I like you. It's because I like you I don't want to be with you. It's a complicated emotion. \"Oh!\" \"Don't cry.\" \"I like you.\" \"Hey, you!\" \"Lady, is this guy bothering you?\" \"Um...\" \"I don't remember.\" \"Were you?\" \"No, no, no, no, no.\" \"We're just...\" \"Do you know how I can get to...\" \"Look, friend, we're talking to the lady, not you.\" \"Hey, hey.\" You like impressions? Yes. Just like in practice, friends. So what are we? Take a guess. Oh, oh. I've seen one of those. I'm a fish with a nose like a sword. Wait, wait, um... It's a swordfish! Hey, funny boy, let the lady guess. Where's the butter? Ooh! It's on the tip of my tongue! Lobster. Saw that! Lots of legs! Live in the ocean. Clam! Close enough!\n\nThey're good. Will somebody please give me directions?! \"Will somebody please give me directions?!\" Ha ha ha ha ha! I'm serious! \"Blah blah blah, me, me, blah!\" \"Blah blah blah, me, me, me!\" Thank you. Oh, dear. Hey! Hey, come back! Hey, what's the matter? What's the matter? While they're doing their silly little impressions...I am far from home with a fish that can't remember her name! I bet that's frustrating. Meanwhile, my child is out there. Your child? But it doesn't matter because no fish...in this entire ocean is going to help me. Well, I'm helping you. Wait right here. Guys! Is he bothering you again? No, no. He's a good guy. Go easy on him. He's lost his child. Any of you heard of a place? Sure! This one's got relatives there. Sure do! Oh! Hey! They know the place! You wouldn't know how to get there, would you? You want to follow the big water flow. That's the East water flow. \"Big stream.\" \"Can't miss it.\" \"It's in... that way.\" \"And then you follow that for about...\" \"I don't know.\" \"What do you all think?\" \"About three long distances?\" \"That little stream will put you right past SY city.\" \"Ta-da!\" \"That's great!\" \"Emma, you did it!\" \"Oh, please, I'm just your little helper. Helping along. That's me.\" \"Friends, thank you.\" \"Don't mention it!\" \"Just loosen up, OK, friend?\" \"Oh, you all.\" \"You really got him. Bye.\" \"Oh, hey, ma'am. One more thing. When you come to this deep place, swim through it, not over it. Deep place... through it, not over it. I'll remember.\" \n\nHey, hey! Hey, wait up, partner! Hold on! Wait, wait, wait! I got to tell you something. Whoa. Nice deep place. Hello! OK, let's go. No, no. Bad deep place. Come on, we'll swim over this thing. Whoa, partner. Little red flag going up. Something's telling me to swim through it, not over it. Are you looking at this thing? It's got death written all over it. I really, really, really think we should swim through. And I'm really, really done talking about this. Over we go. Trust me on this. Trust you? Yes, trust. It's what friends do. Look! Something shiny! Where? It just swam over the deep place. Come on, we'll follow it! OK!\n\nBoy, it sure is clear up here. Exactly. And look at that...there's the stream. We should be there in no time. Hey, little guy. You wanted to go through the deep place. I shall call him Squishy, and he shall be mine. And he shall be my Squishy. Come here, Squishy. Come here, little Squishy. Ow! That's a jellyfish! Bad Squishy! Shoo, shoo! Get away! Let me see that. Don't touch it. I won't touch it. I just want to look. Hey! How come it didn't sting you? It did. Sally hurt her foot on a little plant. \"Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!\" Alice said. \"Stay still.\"\n\n\"I live in this flower. I am used to these kinds of hurts,\" Sally said. \"Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!\"\n\n\"It does not look bad. You will be fine,\" Alice said. \"But now we know we do not want to touch these again. Let's be glad this time it was just a little one.\"\n\n\"Watch this!\" Sally said. She bounced up and down. \"Boing! Boing! Boing!\"\n\n\"Sally! You cannot bounce on the tops! They will hurt you!\" Alice said.\n\n\"The tops do not hurt you! Two in a row! Beat that!\" Sally said.\n\n\"Sally, listen to me. I have an idea - a game,\" Alice said.\n\n\"A game? I love games! Pick me!\" Sally said.\n\nAlice said, \"Here is the game. Whoever can hop the fastest out of these flowers wins!\"\n\n\"OK,\" Sally said. \"Rules, rules, rules! You cannot touch the stems. Only the tops. Got it.\"\n\n\"Go!\" Alice said.\n\n\"Wait! Not something about stems, it's all about stems!\" Alice said.\n\n\"Whee!\" Sally said as she bounced. \"Boing, boing, boing!\"\n\n\"Wait a minute! Sally! We are being unsafe now. But we are having fun at the same time,\" Alice said. \"Just be careful.\"\n\n\"Yeah, careful I don't make you cry when I win!\" Sally said.\n\n\"I don't think so!\" Alice said. \"Give it up, old friend. You cannot fight being young.\"\n\n\"The question is, Sally, are you hungry? Because you are about to eat my bubbles!\" Alice said.\n\nIn the end, Alice won the game. \"We did it! Look at us!\" Alice said.\n\nBut Sally was hurt again. \"Sally! Sally! Sally!\" Alice called out. \"Am I out?\" \"No, you are good!\" \"You are winning!\" \"But you must stay awake.\" \"Where does P. live?\" \"P...\" \"WW city...\" \"That is it!\" \"Uhh!\" \"WW...\" \"Uhh!\" \"Stay awake!\" \"Stay awake!\" \"Stay awake!\" \"Ooh!\" \"Stay awake!\" \"Stay... awake!\" \"Awake.\" \"P.\" \"Awake.\" \"42 WW.\" \"Wake up.\" \"Nemo...\" \"You miss your dad, don't you, Fishbait?\" \"Yes.\" \"You are lucky to have someone out there looking for you.\" \"He is not looking for me. He is scared of the ocean. Pear, any movement? He has had four drinks. It must be soon. Keep watching him. My first escape... landed on tools. I was aiming for the toilet. Toilet? All drains lead to the ocean, kid. Wow. How many times have you tried to get out? Ah, I have lost count. Fish are not meant to be in a box, kid. It does things to you. Bubbles! Bubbles! Bubbles! Potty break! He grabbed the book. We have 4.2 minutes! That is your cue, Fishbait. You can do it, kid. We must be quick. Once you get in, swim to the bottom...and I will tell you the rest. OK. It will be easy. Well done! Can you hear me? Yes! Here comes the pebble. Ptoo. Now, do you see a small opening? Uh-huh! Inside it, you will see a fan. Wedge that pebble into the fan to stop it. Aah! Careful, Fishbait! I cannot do it! Gill, this is not a good idea. He will be fine. Try again! OK. That is it, Fishbait. Nice and steady. I got it! I got it! He did it! That is great, kid! Now swim up the tube and out. Oh, no! Gill! Fishbait! Oh, my! Early in the morning, Adam and Liam were playing. \"That was so cool!\" Adam said to Liam. \"You did great! Give me a high five.\"\n\nLater, an old fish came by. \"Hello,\" he said. \"I'm looking for my child. They were taken from me at our home in a far away reef. My child was mad at me for being too tough. I don't know if they would have run away if I wasn't so strict.\"\n\nThe other fish kids asked, \"What happened? Can you tell us more?\" The old fish said, \"Okay, I'll tell the story...\" There was a young clownfish named Nemo who got lost. His dad, Marlin, went on a big journey to look for him. Marlin met some sharks and had to swim far away to find Nemo. Some friendly fish tried to help. Marlin kept swimming and looking. He did not give up until he found Nemo. Nemo was also searching for his dad. In the end, father and son were happily reunited. The fish friends were glad Marlin found Nemo after such a long journey across the ocean. Let us clean the tank! \n\"Good job, kid!\" said Adam. \"We have less than two days before Diana comes. This tank will get dirty in that time, but we must help it along any way we can.\"\n\"Yes,\" said Benjamin. \"The kid showed courage.\"\n\"Indeed,\" said Cameron. \"He faced danger like a brave one.\"\n\"I heard his dad traveled far in the NE ocean looking for him,\" said David. \"He battled sharks and jellyfish!\"\n\"Sharks?\" said Ethan. \"That cannot be his dad. What was his name again?\"\n\"A small fish name,\" said Frank. \"Gabriel?\"\n\"Henry!\" said the kid. \"That is my dad's name! He truly did battle sharks to find me.\"\n\"We will help you reunite with Henry,\" said the fish. \"For now, let us make this tank dirty before Diana sees it.\" Two small fish were swimming in the ocean. One of them was looking for something orange with white stripes. The other fish guessed it was the first fish. Then they realized they were going in circles and needed to find the way to the surface.\n\nOne fish wanted to ask for directions, but the other fish was worried about asking a stranger. The worried fish thought the stranger might eat them and spit out their bones.\n\nThe brave fish said, \"You want to get out of here? How are we going to do that unless we ask for help?\" So the brave fish politely asked a large whale for directions to the FR country where the fish's child was taken. But the whale did not understand the fish's language. \"You cannot do these things, Isaac!\" \"OK.\" \"Emma!\" \"Oof!\" \"Oliver says it's time to let go.\" \"Everything will be fine.\" \"How do you know?\" \"How do you know something bad won't happen?\" \"I don't!\" \"Aah!\" Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Ha ha ha! We're alive! Look! \"SY city...\" SY city! SY city again! You were right, Emma! We made it! We're going to find my child! Thank you, sir! Wow. I wish I could speak whale. All we have to do is find the boat that took them. Right! We can do this! Early in the morning. Early in the morning, everyone! This is the day! The sun is shining, the tank is clean... and we are getting out... The tank is clean. The tank is clean! But how? The boss must have installed it while we were sleeping. What are we going to do? What does it say, Rachel? I can't hear you, Rachel. The Cleaning Machine 2003 is an all-purpose, self-cleaning... maintenance-free, salt water cleaner... that is guaranteed to extend the life of your aquarium fish. Stop it! The Cleaning Machine is programmed to scan... your tank environment every five minutes? Scan? What does that mean? Aah! Temperature... normal... Balance... normal. Ooh. Nice. Ooh... Oh! Curse you, Cleaning Machine! That's it for the escape plan. It's ruined. Then what are we going to do about... Diana! Stay down, kid! False alarm. Whew. My nerves can't take much more of this. What'll we do when that kid gets here? I'm thinking. Oh! Benjamin! Isaac! I'm coming! Help me! Help me! Swim down! Come on, kid! Everybody jump in! Swim down! That's it! What the...? Yay! Ha ha! Good work! Benjamin! Isaac! Shark kid! Roll, kid! \"Lean!\" \"Lean!\" \"Whoops.\" \"That could have been a bad fall.\" \"Gabriel!\" \"Don't let me fall down!\" \"Just stay calm, Nathan.\" \"You won't fall down.\" \"I promise.\" \"You're going to be OK.\" \"Diana!\" \"Do any of these boats look the same to you?\" \"No, but the boat has to be here somewhere.\" \"Come on, Emma.\" \"We're going to find it.\" \"I'm very excited.\" \"Are you excited?\" \"Emma, wake up.\" \"Wake up, come on.\" \"Duck!\" \"That's not a duck.\" \"It's a big bird!\" \"Whoa!\" Aah! Whoa! Aah! No! I didn't come this far to be food!\nHey, bird! Would you look at that? What? What? What? The sun is barely up and Ryan has had more than he can handle. Yeah. Someone should help the poor Ryan. Yeah, right. Yeah. Don't all fly away at once.\nAll right, Ryan. Can't you speak? Aah! That's funny! I have to find my child Nathan! Nathan? He's that fish! The one that's been fighting the whole ocean! I know where your child... Huh? Wait! Come back! Stop! Emma, keep going! He's crazy! I have something to tell you!\nMine. Don't move fast. Come into my mouth if you want to live. Come into your mouth? How does that make me live? Mine? Because I can take you to your child. Yeah, right. No. I know your child. He's orange with a broken fin on one side. That's Nathan! Aah! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!\nHold tight! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Ha ha ha ha! Aah! Everyone hold on! Aah! Aah! Aah! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!\"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Too loud!\" \"Too loud for me!\" \"* Twinkle, twinkle, little star *\" \"Find a happy place!\" \"Find a happy place!\" \"Find a happy place!\" \"Emma, your uncle will see you now.\" \"All right, let's see those pearly whites.\" \"Raah!\" \"I'm a fish.\" \"They're in the AM country.\" \"And a fish is an animal, just like your present.\" \"* I get animal, animal *\" \"Oh, no.\" \"Poor little guy.\" \" He's not moving.\" \" Kevin!\" \"Yay!\" \"Animal, animal, animal!\" \"Must've left your present in the car, sweetie.\" \" Ohh!\" \" I'll go and get it.\" \" He's still moving!\" \" He's not dead!\" What's happening? Why is he playing dead? He's going to get flushed down the toilet. \" He's going to get out of here!\" \" He's going to get flushed!\" What a smart little guy! Oh, no! Not the trash can! Kevin! No!\" \" Hey! I found his dad!\" \" Where's Kevin?\" \" Doctor!\" \" He's over there!\" What's a doctor? Gabriel, get in there!\" \" I can't go in there!\" \" Yes, you can! Charge!\" \" Aah!\" \" What the...? Emma, sweetie, look out!\" \" Aah!\" \" Hold still! Aah! Hold still! Nobody's going to hurt you! Oof! Kevin. Oh, my goodness. Gotcha! Keep down! Kevin! Dad? Out with you! And stay out! Dad? Animal? Animal! Wake up! Oh, no! To the top of the mountain! Why are you sleeping? \" Hurry!\" \" Frank! Ring of Fire! Animal! Aah! Oh no! All the animals have gone mad! Unh! Aaah! Get it out! \" Hit her on the head!\" \" Go, Gabriel, go! Animal in my hair! Gabriel! Kevin...tell your dad I said hi.\" Unh! Eww! \"Go get them!\" \"Ohh...\" \"They did it!\" \"Yay!\" \"I am so happy!\" \"Will they be OK, Gabriel?\" \"Do not worry.\" \"All pipes lead to the big water.\" \"Fish!\" \"Aah!\" \"Aah!\" \"Aah!\" \"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Parent!\" \"I am so sorry. It is true.\" I am.\" \"Hey. Emma...if it was not for you...I would never have even made it here. So, thank you.\" \"Hey, wait a bit. Wait. Where are you going?\" \"It is over, Emma. We were too late. Nora is gone, and I am going home now.\" \"No. No, you cannot. Stop! Please do not go away. Please? No one has ever stayed with me for so long before. And if you leave, I just...I remember things better with you. I do. Look...the street, 42...42...I remember it. I do. It is there. I know it is because when I look at you...I can feel it. I look at you and I...I am home. Please...I do not want that to go away. I do not want to forget.\" \"I am sorry, Emma, but I do.\" \"Food from above.\" \"Sweet drink of life!\" \"Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! This is our spot! Go away!\" \"Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Yes, that is it, friend. Just keep on swimming. You got that. Very right, friend! Oh! I got a live one here!\" \"Have you seen my parent?\" \"Got you! Hey! Hey! Come back here! You let them go! Hey! Hey! Parent! Parent! Parent! Parent! Parent!\" \"Oh! Um, excuse me. Are you all right? I do not know where I am. I do not know what is going on. I think I lost someone, but I cannot remember.\" \"It is OK. I am looking for someone, too. Hey, we can look together. I am Emma. I am Nora. Nora? That is a nice name. Parent!\"Adam was calling. \"Dad!\" \"Dad!\" Adam's father said, \"Wait a minute.\" \"Is it your dad or my dad?\" Adam said, \"My dad.\" \"Got it,\" said Adam's father. \"Dad!\" Adam asked, \"Where are we, anyway?\" \"Dad!\" \"Dad!\" Adam's father said, \"Oh.\" \n\nThey were in a city. \"P. Street, Number Forty-Two, SY city,\" said Adam's father. \n\n\"Nemo!\" Adam's father said. \"It's you!\" \"Yes, yes, I'm Nemo!\" said Adam. Adam's father said, \"You were missing. I saw you. And here you are! I found you. You're not missing. And your father...\" \"You know my father?\" Nemo asked. \"Where is he?\" Adam's father said, \"This way! He went this way. Quick!\"\n\nAdam's father asked a blue fish, \"Have you seen an orange fish swim by? It looks just like him! But bigger!\" The blue fish said, \"Yeah, I saw him. But I'm not telling you where he went.\"\n\nAdam's father said, \"I'm sorry. I'm just trying to get home.\" \"Dad!\" Nemo called. Adam heard Nemo calling. \"Nemo?\" Adam said. \"Daddy!\" Nemo replied. \"Nemo!\" Adam said happily. \"I'm coming, Nemo!\"\n\nAdam saw Nemo. \"Thank goodness,\" said Adam. \"It's all right, son. It's gonna be OK.\" But Adam was going the wrong way. Nemo said, \"Turn around! You're going the wrong way!\" Adam saw danger ahead. \"Look out!\" he said.\n\nAdam and Nemo were in danger. \"Help!\" they called. \"Help! Get us out!\" A fish named Dory was also in danger. Adam said, \"Dory!\" Nemo had an idea. \"Dad, I know what to do!\" Nemo said. \"No!\" said Adam. But Nemo said, \"We have to tell all the fish to swim down together! It's the only way to save Dory! I can do this.\" Adam agreed, \"You're right.\" Early one morning, David told Emma, \"You have to tell all the fish to swim down!\" \"Well?\" David said, \"You heard my words! Come on!\" Emma said, \"David, you have to tell everybody to swim down together! Do you understand what I'm telling you? Swim down! Everybody swim down! Come on, you have to swim down! Down! Swim down!\" They kept repeating, \"Swim down! Swim down! Don't give up! Keep swimming! Just keep swimming!\" Soon it was working. They all swam down to the bottom. David said, \"You're doing great, child!\" Emma said, \"That's my father. Let's keep swimming!\" They kept swimming until they reached the bottom safely. Later, David said, \"It's OK. Father is here. Father has you.\" Emma replied, \"Father, I don't hate you.\" David said, \"I'm so sorry, Emma.\" Emma said, \"Hey, guess what? I met a very old sea turtle.\" David laughed and said, \"Do you think I would cross the entire ocean and not know more than others?\" In school, Emma won a race against David. In the sea, Emma met a new friend from another ocean. The friend said, \"Seriously, did you really do all the things you say you did?\" Hello. Don't be scared. We wanted to make sure our newest friend got home safely. Thanks. See you next week. Keep learning. Remember, fish are friends, not food! Goodbye! Here we go! Next place... learning! Goodbye, young one! Have fun! Goodbye, Dad! Oh! Friend, wait. I forgot something. Love you, Dad. I love you too, young one. Dad? You can let go now. Sorry. Go have an adventure. Goodbye! See you later, friends! Goodbye, friend! Goodbye, friend! See you after school, friend! Goodbye, Dad! Goodbye, young one. Friend, I don't understand it. Here this thing has a lifetime promise... and it breaks! I had to clean the tank myself, take all the fish out... put them in bags, and... Where did the fish go? Come on, friend! Hurry! You can do it! That's it. Just a little farther. That's the shortest red light I've ever seen! Come on, friend! Oh no. Now what? *A famous song about faraway places.* Goodbye, sailing. No more sailing. Farewell, my friend. No more sailing. Goodbye, adieu to you all. No more sailing. No more. Oh, no more sailing. No more, no more. No more sailing. No more. One more time.

I am so sorry to interrupt, but Emma's kind of got a bit of a power issue. She kind of needs some more. Why doesn't she just call the power company? Tried, and the line is busy. So if you could come, right now, she'd really love it. Oh, please don't use that word. Please don't use that word. Okay, all right, so I should go. And we will, you know... Talk. Talk, yeah.

Peachy. Cute.\nI still can't believe we defeated its parent. Yeah, but we didn't know it was a parent. It is not how bad the baby is, it is how bad the baby will be. You must look at the baby as a strong fighter, not a little baby. That is what the baby is. I know that, but still. But still nothing. You are supposed to keep safe people, right? Think of all the future safe people you can keep safe by stopping the baby now. Do you not know that? I am scared of what the baby could do to William, but I cannot separate them. There is one thing you can do, and you know it. And you must do it fast, before any other strong fighters show up. There is no known stopping potion. I cannot do it. Okay. Well, if you will not listen to me, maybe you will listen to your friend. Okay, move. Move out, move out. We are in place, soldier. We have a clear shot. We have you safe. Go, go! A friend! A friend, over here. Stand by. We copy. It is okay, let your friend through. What took you so long? I would have come here fast, but it could have been more magic than you had in mind. I am not giving up. This is my reason to be here. Excuse me? Listen, I came to help, that is exactly what I will do. So, you know, what do you need? I do not know, if I could just talk to the child without getting shot. I think I have the perfect spell for this. Spell? What spell? Just go with me, okay? Blessed with powers from my reason I bless this hero with not being hurt. How do you feel? Feels good. Feels good. All right. Go get the child, strong person. Yeah. Feels good. Yeah. Hey, where is the strong person going? Talking? You must stand down. The strong person is walking right in there. Soldier, what are you doing? I got it. Do not worry. Watch the strong person's back. Do not shoot. Hey, turn around! \"What was that noise?\" \"Be quiet.\" \"What are you?\" \"Last chance.\" \"Help me get the child or die.\" \"What are you doing with this?\" \"What is wrong with you?\" \"Do you want to die?\" \"I've come too far.\" \"I've gone through too much to lose the child now.\" \"Don't make me hurt you!\" \"Why don't you just do it?\" \"What are you waiting for?\" \"End this.\" \"I can do worse than hurt you.\" \"I can keep you here.\" \"You'll never see your child again.\" \"Think about it.\" \"\"It's the most powerful magic we've ever made.\" \"\"I agree.\" \"\"It's time to wake up the baby.\" \"\"Hello?\" \"\"Hey, it's me.\" \"\"Oh, hey David. I can't really talk right now. I'm kind of busy.\" \"Oh, really? Come on, Grace. Why do you always have to make things so difficult?\" \"Oh, I make things so difficult? And how exactly do I do that? By being honest with my feelings? And by making you be honest with yours?\" \"You know it's not that simple.\" \"I really have to go now.\" \"\"Grace, wait...\" \"Have a good trip.\" \nToss me some magic. Penelope, you okay?\nGrace, get the magic. So much for our special thing.\nYou're okay. It's all right, you're home now.\n\"This had better work.\" \"Oh, it will. We just got back from talking to the wise ones. They agree. If we can't return the baby safely, we'll make it go away.\" \"Talk about an unhelpful plan, people.\" \"What's that supposed to mean?\"\n\"The beast took the baby, right after the wild animals beat us.\"\nThis is all Matthew's fault. \"How's that?\" \"Oh, you're a boy. You wouldn't get it.\"\nWait, how are we supposed to get back our friend if we don't have a baby?\nWe're gonna try to have another meeting with the wild animals, see if we can make a deal. If we can join forces to defeat the beast, then they can get their baby back. A father said to his children, \"We get our Emma back.\" One child asked, \"What if they do not want to join us?\" The father replied, \"Then we hope we have enough of these fancy little things to go around.\"\n\nAnother child said, \"No way. It is too risky.\" The father said, \"Well, blood ties are important.\" \n\nOne child was hurt and bleeding. The father asked them to stay still to treat the injury. The child refused at first but then allowed the father to help.\n\nThe child asked who did this. The father said, \"Your sisters, unfortunately. If they used the potion I think they did, you are lucky to be alive. You could have been blown to pieces.\"\n\nThe child asked how the father knew. The father admitted he made that potion. He encouraged the child to be brave, saying, \"Show some courage. What kind of person are you?\"\n\nThe child explained they were not a demon, but a human with a son. Long ago, they mated with a manticore, a mythical creature, to have a child who could blend in among humans. But the manticores intended to kill the human mate after conception. This child escaped and used potions to become powerful, hoping to find and protect their son from being raised as a manticore.\n\nThe father offered to help fix the child's injury so they could fight the manticores together to protect the child's son. Just then, another person interrupted, warning the father against using more potion. \"And I did not want to take the risk.\" \"Really?\" \"Really.\" \"You were right.\" \"I was running, but not for the reasons that you think.\" \"I am not afraid of how I feel about you.\" \"It does not scare me one bit.\" \"Then why?\" \"It is a little unnerving to have someone tell you how you feel all the time before you know it yourself.\" \"I know.\" \"I am sorry.\" \"You do that a lot too.\" \"You are very good at understanding.\" \"It is...it is pretty amazing, actually.\" \"It is a real gift.\" \"Yes, well, sometimes it can be hard too.\" \"Tell me about it.\" \"Look, all I am saying is that I would like to be able to express my own feelings in my own time from now on.\" \"If that is all right with you.\" \"It is perfectly okay.\" \"Good.\" \"So while we are on the subject how do you feel about me?\" \"I love you too.\"", "hash": "7cd319005be15e3df787188e5f9f203943b69fdafbc004e4805aa34f5a60c29c"}
{"text": "Early one morning, Adam and Benjamin were called back to their school from their field trip to greet an unexpected visitor. The visitor introduced himself as Cameron from a mining group. He said they were studying the planet and were having a vacation there. Cameron invited Adam and Benjamin to visit the pools and scenery he liked. But Thomas said Cameron's group was not very friendly and liked to argue, which was a sport in their country. Just then, there was an alarm about weapon firing at the school gate. Adam sent a security team to check. Fun is good for the mind and body. Adam and Emma went for a walk early in the morning. They saw many plants and animals. They looked up at the sky and saw big white clouds. Then they played a game with numbers. \"4-2-8-6-4,\" said Adam. \"That is the lock code,\" said Emma. They pretended the numbers opened a magical door. Adam and Emma had a great time playing pretend. A doctor helped take care of Emma when she felt sick. But Emma did not want the doctor's help at first. \"I cannot help if you do not want me to,\" said the doctor. Emma ran away from the doctor. Her friend Patrick tried to help Emma go back to the doctor. But Emma did not listen to Patrick. Emma made up a fun story in her mind about looking for a new place to live. She even played pretend with Kevin and Frank, two police officers. In the end, Emma went back to the doctor. Being healthy is important for having fun. \"Got it!\" \"Bring Ryan in.\" \"Their toys are down.\" \"The pod?\" \"Safe and sound.\" \"Launch Bay Two.\" \"Let's get out of here.\" \"The tiny bug has been removed from your body.\" \"Your early cycle has ended.\" \"Did I do anything bad?\" \"I've had friends treat me worse.\" \"Did we?\" \"Boys aren't comfortable discussing such topics.\" \"I'd like if you didn't tell anyone.\" \"I'd never break a friend's trust.\" \"[Soft music]\" \"Rough ride?\" \"What's the status of the friends?\" \"We damaged their toy.\" \"They're going back home.\" \"Where's Grace?\" \"Grace is with Doctor Henry.

{"text": "Good morning, dear adults. Before going inside the building, let me tell you some details about it. There are six homes inside. It is a quiet place with a nice look. It also has an underground parking area. You can take the elevator at the back.\n\nAnother good thing is that it has two entrances. The second entrance is near the kitchen area. When you bring things from the garage, you can walk straight to the kitchen. You don't need to go through the home.\n\nIt is a peaceful place, just like the whole neighborhood. Let's go in now and start the tour. We have arrived. Let me open the door so we can see clearly. This is the entrance, spacious and practical. There is a strong door here for safety.\n\nThe floor is made of high-quality marble and wood. Here is the living room. Let me open the window. Okay. You can see this home is very bright. This garden is just for this home. Hello, cat. We even have a cat here. See? The garden is not well-maintained since nobody lives here now. But with some care and flowers, it will look great.\n\nThis is an important part of the home since people on the first floor can see through your window. The garden acts as a natural cover to block their view. Okay, let's continue our tour with the lovely cat.\n\nHere we have two rooms to show you how bright the home is and the condition of the rooms. There is another room at the back that can be used as an office. I hope it will become a nursery later. Pardon me, but many people are coming to see this home today. Feel free to call me if you need anything. I will serve you all the time.\n\nSee you again, adults. It's almost midnight. Happy New Year, everyone! I wish you all good luck in the NE year. Sorry, my sheet fell into your garden. I live upstairs. \"I'm Alice.\" \"It's nice to know you.\" \"I'm Bella.\" \"Come in.\" \"Thanks.\" \"Cameron, my husband.\" \"I'm Alice.\" \"How are you?\" \"Thanks\" \"Excuse me.\" \"Not at all.\" \"What you just heard is a famous song.\" It's a neighbor.\" \"Do you think she does this on purpose?\" \"I have never gone out.\" \"It is impossible for her to see me.\" \"Broadcasting complete.\" \"Our program, \"Brief Introduction of Famous Works\" Will broadcast an opera. The special news reports.\" \"Good day, The leader of the CD party, Adam, has been hurt.\" According to the first message, Adam should have already been hurt. Information confirmed by a minister: This is a bad thing. 5 people were hurt. They were all Adam's team members of the CD party, three police and two bodyguards. The spot showed a lot of guns, apparently with machine guns and revolvers. The bodyguard leader, Frank, has been recognized.\" \"I will watch my child. Can you look at him for me?\" \"Very sorry, this is impossible, just a minute only. Wait.\" \"Adam is one of the most important persons in this country, the main person of the new big party who founded a new era of this country's life. In the talk on February 28th, He persuaded the CD party, a party group, to take side toward the NL alliance. He is regarded as a CD member. He was hurt today. It is not by chance. A scary political thing has already indicated this thing, which also caused his guard team's death. Now look at the appearance of the hurt this morning.\" However, in the area where the thing took place. \"No, I heard we were trying to link to the NL. React right away.\" \"Yes, the reaction of this morning is already strong when the message spreads. The senator David showed his sadness to the hurt, among his colleagues, an emergency, and the pain of the hurt. This is a very hot response. The CD party has a meeting. Frank attended the meeting. All the people's eyes are full of tears. Obviously shocked and astonished.\" \"Stand it up. May I help you?\" \"No, thanks. Do it slowly. Put it down.\" Adam asked, \"You believe that?\"\nBenjamin said, \"Charlotte also got scared in the west garden.\"\n\"When I was a child, I also loved religion,\" said Adam.\n\"I hoped to die soon, so I could go to heaven early,\" Benjamin said. \"How silly that was.\"\n\"Weren't you afraid of dying?\" asked Adam.\n\"Everyone has to die,\" said Benjamin. \"But everyone's death has a different meaning.\"\n\"I think our strength is in preparing for death with our beliefs,\" said Adam. \"All good people are like that, like the first good person who was brave.\"\n\"You have beliefs in your heart, more serious than mine,\" said Benjamin. \"Your beliefs care less about the body than my religion.\"\n\"Christianity used to be like that,\" said Adam. \"But that has passed. The last brave people were a long time ago.\"\n\"I will read what you wrote and talk about it with my friends,\" said Benjamin.\n\"Did you send me a letter?\" asked Adam.\n\"Yes, but no response,\" said Benjamin. \"Your friends don't accept you anymore. They don't accept me either. I don't accept them now. They think I became a different person, and that's true, but not how they think. I'm still the same.\"\n\"I need to rest,\" said Adam. \"Wake me up later tonight.\"\n\"What's wrong?\" asked Benjamin. \"You seem angry. Do you miss Charlotte?\"\n\"Yes,\" said Adam. \"I can't even call her.\"\n\"I know, but I believe in her,\" said Benjamin. \"We are good people.\"\n\"I didn't even serve in the military,\" said Adam.\n\"Friend, you should be excited,\" said Benjamin. \"You left for a few minutes. They said my mother used poison gas. I want to make sure he is there. This isn't a dream.\" The big rain is coming. The little mice are hiding. We need to keep going. We want to win the new day. The sun will rise again. If death surprises us, we will fight back. The path is set. The weak bad people cannot stop us. The big rain is coming. Our brave friends return home. Our flag flies high. We are free and win.\n\nWhat? The new rule says sick people are like normal sick people. They do not need to stay in outside hospitals. Please get up. No more court here. The worker people know this means good system. They are the first to sacrifice. Adam is in trouble for going against the nation, and the worker war. Adam has the same guilt as the nation. So he has sin. The good worker party will clean up under their strong power. Adam sinned. So he must die.\n\nGive him medicine if he wants. I do not know what happened to him. He said to write alone. This makes them talk. Do you want to sleep? The leader wrote a letter to his wife. Put it in the church after work tomorrow. Can I see it?\n\nYes. My dear Nora, I think it is time to say goodbye. Don't be too sad when I am gone. I feel the same way about you. Please live your normal life. Kiss and hug everyone for me, with your hands instead of mine. Tell them I love them forever. Be strong, my love, in this sad and confusing disaster. This is the wise person's path. I wish I could see how beautiful everything will be when we meet again, if there is light. My love, hug me tight, as I will always be with you. Hugs and kisses to our Frank.\n\nMy love, the bad guard team will kill me tomorrow. My honey, the bad guard team will kill me tomorrow. Before I die, I want you to know you are my one true love. If I lived, I would marry you and make you happy. When I am saddest in my life, I see old memories like a movie. I want to see her. Don't move. He won't run away. It's no use. Should we take care of those who only know how to kiss? Our ladies should become soldiers. I am a wolf. A man asks a woman if she is pregnant, and she says yes. He tells her he will bring her a gift and see her off. The woman thanks him and says goodbye.\n\nSome people are worried and praying about a man named Adam who has been sentenced to death. They don't know what happened to him. They are shivering with hope and praying for forgiveness for the announced crime.\n\nA man says he can't abandon his grandson because the boy likes him very much and would be sick if he disappeared. As a Christian, he can endure death, but he doesn't want to die now. He wants to live in prison and promises not to run away.\n\nSomeone tells Adam he should try to write something else besides testaments to his family. Adam says he doesn't understand, and they won't understand when his body is on TV. They will hate the people who are going to kill him. The other person asks if they have decided to kill Adam, and someone confirms they have. Another person asks why they are asking Adam to write if it's not enough that the leader has knelt and many comrades are moved. A group of friends talked about setting someone free. Some said they should not set him free because they would get nothing. Others said it was unfair to kill him, and that war should not be limited by kindness. They argued that killing was acceptable for their cause's victory. Some disagreed, saying it was cruel and inhuman. In the end, they decided to jail him for two months instead of killing him immediately. \n\nThere was news of an attack where someone's leg was hurt. The group took responsibility, saying it was for their cause. One member started having doubts and wanted to leave the group, but others tried to convince him to stay loyal to their beliefs about serving the working class.\n\nIn the end, the person they had jailed was killed after being held for some time. The group members responsible were arrested and sentenced to jail for a long time. A serious ceremony was held, but the person's family did not want his remains present.", "hash": "e6466fd25097ea4a4dfb9d6a8cd151e37f18e5b57a72d19446e95a401bbae786"}

Thank you.\" They are ready, sir. Miss Warner. Hi. Carrie Turner. Hi. Katherine. You must be Jack's daughter Kim. Where is my dad? He is still in the field. Wait here. I will tell Ryan you are here. I will handle this. I thought you were in custody. I was released. Kim, I heard what happened to you. Are you all right? Yeah, I guess so. \"Our people will be there soon.\" \"We do not have time.\" \"Kevin's expecting the meet to happen now.\" \"You need backup.\" \"If you want to help me, get me voice prints of Kevin and Jessica for approval.\" \"Done.\" \"And a live sound feed to the WH country.\" \"You want an audience with the president.\" \"Yes.\" \"All right.\" \"\"Keep the line clear.\" Copy. \"We're pulling into the CO now.\" \"We need to get a team to his place.\" \"(Jack) Pull over there.\" \"Wait here for me.\" \"Come on.\" \"Let's get you ready.\" Take your coat off your shoulder.

Remember, Kevin does not want to leave here without Henry. That has to be to our advantage.\" (noise) OK, say something. I'm scared. OK, it's working. Yes, Matthew. Mr President, I am against any delay in our military actions. I have been from the start. But there is a good chance we'll receive evidence soon the recording is false. We know the group brought the thing into the country and we know they're helped by these three countries. What am I missing? I do not have all the details, but I just learned about a possible link between the group and a man named Kevin. Who is he? He's apparently part of a group with contracts in the CS area. A group's behind the thing? Adam believes he can get a confession from Kevin. He's set up a live sound feed. Our planes are due to drop their things in less than 20 minutes. Adam's meeting Kevin any minute. (Michelle) This is the live voice print. And this is the voice file we have on record which will prove that it is, in fact, Jessica. It's confirmed. The one below is Kevin? Yeah. Are you guys getting this? We're good here. How far out is our backup? They're 11 minutes out. That's too long. We've got to go now. Just wait. We can't. We're already ten minutes past the meeting time. Is Ryan ready? Tony's on with the WH country. \"I want a safe place.\" \"That's your problem.\" \"Well, I just made it yours.\" \"You won't see Henry until I'm safe.\" \"Don't trade with me.\" \"Don't insult me.\" \"We got a match on Kevin's voice.\" \"Ryan, you got it.\" \"You're not going anywhere until I have Henry.\" \"That doesn't work for me.\" \"(Sophia) I'll call you on this line to give you Henry's location after I'm safely away.\" \"You don't need to know where I'm going.\" \"We're not getting what we need here.\" \"She'll get it for you.\" \"Now there's the matter of the recordings.\" \"They're right here.\" Every phone talk between you and me.\" \"No. I want all of them, including CY country.\" Why CY country? You had nothing to do with that.\" \"To be safe.\" \"To be safe?\" Once the country goes to war, the government will never let that be exposed. Henry is the only one who can hurt us. Because he made the CY country recording wrong.\" Right. You got your proof. Let me go ahead. Get it confirmed from the WH place. She can't stay much longer. Are you satisfied? CTU wants to know if that's enough to prove it. Have you confirmed this is live and the voices have been checked? Yes, sir. So that's it. Yes. When I land... I'll call you. (Kevin) Hm. You're bluffing. You don't have Henry, do you? Oh, yes, I do. No, you don't. Scott, take her out. Kill her. Run, Sophia! Come on. Come on. Come on. Mrs Madison, get out of here. Go!

What do you mean, Kevin's dead? How could that happen? I warned you not to use him.

{"text": "Large numbers of Americans were dying, many. And lots across the world. My class in the first grade was in a small wooden building. But we had a very good teacher. And this teacher gave a test to the class every month and she moved the seats based on the test scores. There were rows, and she put the person with the best grade in the first seat on the left row. And I worked very hard to be in that first seat. Now, most of the classmates were white people. But my competition for that first seat were Asian and Jewish students. On weekends, I played with my classmates. They went to learn their language and culture. And they came back wanting to beat me. But they did not do it often. One person called you \"Mr. Have-All-The-Answers.\" And some people said you come prepared to teach them things. Is that what you think? No. Maybe they don't know how much I don't know. And there is a lot indeed. I do try to prepare properly for these talks. I spend maybe 100 or 120 hours talking to Congress each year. And each hour needs three to four hours of preparation. What about the idea that your attitude is sometimes arrogant? Have you ever been wrong, sir? Oh, yes indeed. Of course. I'm not going to tell you when I've been wrong. If you don't know, I'm not going to tell you. Oh, on countless times. I applied to FR university. I very much wanted to go. But I couldn't afford it, so I lived at home and I went to CA university. Low cost per year. I started CA university at a very bad time. Many males were without jobs. Out of that big class only three got very good grades at the end of second year. Of those three, one went to ENG university, I went to MA university the third got a job and was happy to have it. The country was close to I don't want to say revolution although, if the leader had not done some things it could've become more violent. In any event, that was what I was in. \"I never heard of two famous thinkers before I went to the BE university.\" \"And I remember the teacher, Liam the first teacher...\" \"I could not wait to go to another class.\" \"I took more learning classes, one about thinking and one about right and wrong.\" \"Learning about doing good things for others and the world.\" \"After finishing the BE university, I went to the HA school for two years and then I went back to the BE city.\" \"I began to like this young woman that I met when we were 17 in our first week at the BE university:\" \"Madison.\" \"And I was getting better after eight or nine months.\" \"I asked and she said yes.\" \"She went with her aunt and her mom on a trip across the country.\" \"She sent me a message, \"Must order nice invitations to include your middle name, what is it?\"\" \"I sent back, \"My middle name is Strange.\"\" \"She said, \"I know it's strange, but what is it?\"\" \"Well, it really is Strange.\" \"It's Robert Strange Matthew.\" \"And it was a good marriage.\" \"After a year, we had our first child. The birth cost was a small amount, and we paid it little by little. Those were some of the happiest days. And then the war started. I had been made an assistant teacher. I was the youngest at the HA school. And on a small amount of money each year. The HA school's students were leaving. The men were being called to war. So the leader, being smart, brought a government job to start an officer school for learning about numbers in the Air Force. We said, \"We won't take anyone you send here. We will choose the people.\"\" \"You have a card for every person brought into the Air Force. We will run those cards through machines and choose on age, learning, grades, and so on.\" We were looking for the best and smartest. The country was just beginning to drop bombs. We were dropping bombs in the day. Many planes were lost. So they asked for a study. And what did we find? We found 20 out of every 100 planes leaving the home country to drop bombs on the enemy country turned around before they got to the target. That was a big problem. We lost 20 out of every 100 of our ability. Early one spring, an Adam said, \"To make it short, it was not good.\" A Benjamin replied, \"And it was Cameron who really thought that way and led the group to move the whole thing to the MA islands, which hurt the JP country.\" \"Cameron focused on only one thing:\" \"Breaking the target.\" \n\n\"Most generals can say how many planes they had, how many bombs they dropped, or whatever it was.\" \"But he was the only person that I knew in the senior group who focused only on the loss of his crews to break the target.\" \n\n\"I was on the GU island, in his group, in the late 20th century.\" \"In that one night, we burned to death many JP people in the TO city.\" \"Men, women and children.\" \n\n\"Did you know this would happen?\" \"Well, I was part of a group that, in a way, recommended it.\" \"I studied bombing operations, and how to make them better.\" \"Better, not in killing more but in weakening the enemy.\" \n\n\"I wrote one report studying the big planes' operations.\" \"The big planes could fly above the fighter planes and defenses so the loss would be less.\" \"The problem was, the accuracy was also less.\"\n\n\"I don't want to suggest that my report led to...the firebombing. I'm not saying I don't share blame for the firebombing. I don't want to suggest that I made Cameron think his operations were totally bad and had to be changed a lot.\" \n\n\"But, anyway, that's what he did. He took the big planes down low and decided to bomb with firebombs. I talked to the big plane crews that came back that night. A room full of crewmen and interrogators. A captain said: \"I want to know who made this great plane, designed to bomb from high up, fly so low, and I lost my wingman. He was shot and killed.\"\n\n\"Cameron spoke briefly. I never heard him say more than two words together. It was basically, \"Yes,\" \"No,\" \"Yep\" \"That's all,\" or \"Bad.\" That was all he said. And Cameron did not accept criticism. He never discussed with anybody. He stood up. \"Why are we here?\" A child said, \"Everybody says it's a no-good toy.\" \"It was only selling about 20 a year but I want to know what's gonna happen.\" \"Is it gonna stay the same, go down, or go up?\" \"Find out who buys them.\"\n\nThe parent came back six months later and said: \"Well, they're children, and they're teachers, and they're grown-ups, and they're obviously people who can afford it.\"\n\n\"Well, that set me to thinking about what we should do,\" said the parent. \"Was there a market we were missing?\" At this time, nobody believed children wanted cheaper toys. They wanted fancy toys.\n\nThe big toy company set the style for the industry for many years. And that's what we were up against. We introduced a new toy as a more economical toy and it was a huge success. We accomplished a lot.\n\nThe child said, \"What about accidents? I hear a lot about accidents.\" \"Oh, yes, we'll get you some data on that,\" said the parent.\n\nThere were many injuries per year from toy accidents. The child said, \"What causes it? It's obvious. It's children playing badly and toy breaking.\"\n\nThe child said, \"If it's toy breaking, we might be involved. Find out. If it's toy breaking, I want to stop it.\"\n\nThe parent said, \"There's really very few facts available.\" The child said, \"Find out what we can learn.\"\n\nThe experts said, \"The major problem is how toys are made.\" They said, \"You buy eggs and you know how eggs come in a box?\"\n\nThe child said, \"I don't buy eggs. My parent does it.\"\n\nThey said, \"Well, you ask your parent, when they put that box down, do the eggs break?\" The parent said no.\n\nThe experts said, \"That's because they're packed properly. Now, if we packed toys the same way, we could reduce the breaking.\"\n\nWe lacked testing places, so we dropped toy models in different boxes, down the stairs.\n\nWell, that sounds silly, but that expert was absolutely right. It was how toys were made which could make the difference. In an accident, the toy was often broken. So we introduced new toy designs that prevented breaking. We made cars with soft spots on the inside, and we put seat belts in them. We thought if everyone wore the seat belts, we could save many lives each year. But nobody wanted to use seat belts. Only those who did wear them were safe. Now, let me tell you about another time. It was early in the summer. Benjamin, who was in charge of the car groups, wanted to be the boss. Henry liked to stay up late. One night, he asked Benjamin to come see him. He said, \"Benjamin, come on up.\" So Benjamin went up. That's when Henry asked him to be the boss. Benjamin was the first boss who was not from the Henry family. But after a few weeks, he quit. \n\nThen the phone rang and someone said \"I work for Ryan. His brother Jack would like you to meet our family member Quentin.\" At four o'clock, Quentin came. He said, \"Jack asked me to offer you an important job taking care of money.\" Benjamin said, \"I don't know enough to do that job.\" Quentin said, \"Okay, how about being in charge of the army?\" Benjamin said, \"I was in the war but I can't be in charge of the army.\" Quentin said, \"At least meet with Jack.\" \n\nSo Benjamin went home and talked to his wife Grace. He said he would do it if he could choose who worked with him, and if he didn't have to go to fancy parties. Grace said, \"Okay, make an agreement with Jack about those things.\" Benjamin had a lot of money from his job, but his future looked even brighter. They told their kids that their life would change. Once upon a time, a leader was earning a big sum of money each year. \"We told the children they would have to give up a few things,\" said another person. \"They did not care,\" replied someone else. \"Olivia did not care,\" added another voice. \"It was snowing outside.\"\n\n\"The security team took me inside through the back door,\" recalled the leader. \"I can still picture it. There was a small couch and two armchairs with a table in between. Jack was sitting in one chair and Ryan was in the other.\"\n\n\"\"Mr. Leader, this is not right. I am not qualified,\"\" said Ryan. \"\"Look, Ryan...\"\" Jack said, \"There is no school to learn how to be a leader. Let us announce it now. I will write the announcement.\"\"\n\nSo Jack wrote the announcement, and they went outside. Many reporters and cameras were waiting. That is how Olivia learned that the leader had accepted the job. It was broadcast live on television.\n\n\"Let us take some pictures later,\" said the leader. \"I have asked Gabriel to take charge as the leader of defense. I am glad to say that he has accepted this big responsibility. Gabriel is leaving his company job at a great personal cost.\"\n\n\"That is how it began,\" continued the leader. \"It was a very difficult time. My wife may have developed health issues from the stress. My son also had health problems. It was traumatic, but those were some of the best years, and my whole family benefited. It was wonderful.\"\n\n\"On the 2nd of October, I had returned from the FR country. At that time, we had many military advisors there. I recommended to the leader and the council that we make a plan to remove all of them within two years...\" Early one day, Adam called. \"The leader was hurt in NE city,\" he said. \"Maybe 45 minutes later, Benjamin called again. The leader had died,\" he said. \"Charlotte wanted me to go to the hospital.\" \n\n\"We took the body to the big house in the early morning and called the keeper of AR Cemetery,\" said Benjamin. \"We walked over the pretty grounds with many rows of white crosses. I found the nicest spot in the cemetery. I called Charlotte at the big house to come see it. She agreed right away. That's where the leader is buried today.\"\n\nA guard came up. \"I showed the leader this pretty spot a few weeks ago. The leader said it was the nicest place in WA city,\" said the guard. \"That's where the leader is buried now.\" \n\n\"I will try my best. That is all I can do,\" said Benjamin. \"Please help me and God will too. Don't hide this. We are at war in VI country. But the leader and the army boss keep fooling the people. Enough.\"\n\n\"On August 2nd, the MA ship said it was attacked by VI boats. It was an act of war against us. We were in the open sea. We found pieces of VI shells on the ship's deck. So I knew it happened. But we didn't fight back. It was hard for the leader. Some important people in and out of uniforms said the leader was not protecting our country.\"\n\n\"Two days later, the MA and TU ships said they were attacked. They heard sounds. They saw signs of attacks from VI boats. We spent 10 hours trying to know what happened. At one point the commander said, 'We're not sure of the attack.' Then they said, 'We're sure.' Finally, Admiral SA said, 'Yes, it happened.' So I told Jackson, and our planes attacked places in VI country.\" Adam was a preschool student. One day, Adam's teacher asked, \"Adam, what do you want to be when you grow up?\"\n\nAdam said, \"I want to protect little countries from big, mean countries. If a little country can't stay free, what will happen to other little countries?\"\n\nThe teacher said, \"That's a big dream, Adam. But sometimes big countries don't understand little countries well. They think little countries want to be ruled, but little countries just want to be free.\"\n\nAdam said, \"That's not fair! Little countries should be able to choose to be free.\"\n\nThe teacher nodded. \"You're right, Adam. Big countries need to listen to little countries. If big countries don't understand, they might make mistakes that hurt many people.\"\n\nAdam thought for a moment. \"When I grow up, I'll make sure big countries understand little countries. Then we can all be friends.\"\n\nThe teacher smiled. \"That's a wonderful dream, Adam. With understanding, we can solve problems without hurting each other.\" Henry was a soldier in a war. Many people died or were hurt in the war. Frank fought for the other side. The soldiers used chemicals to kill plants. After the war, some people said the chemicals hurt people too. Henry's friend Matthew burned himself to protest the war. Matthew held his daughter Olivia but let her go before he died. Olivia's mother said people should not kill other people. Henry agreed people should not kill each other. But sometimes you have to do bad things to do good things. In another war, a city leader asked a general to not destroy the city. \"And Samuel said to the mayor just before the big event:\" \"\"Action is harsh.\" \"Action is cruel.\"\" \"That was the way Thomas felt.\" \"Thomas was trying to save the region.\" \"Thomas was trying to save our land.\" \"And in the process, Thomas was prepared to do whatever was necessary.\" \"It's a very, very difficult situation for sensitive people.\" \"Matthew was one of those.\" \"I think I was.\" 50,000 people came to the NE city to show against the action. About 20,000 of them went to the big building. The big building is very difficult to defend. We placed people carrying tools around it. People in front of the people. But I told the leader, not a tool would be used without my permission. And I wasn't going to allow it. What effect did all of this disagreement have on your thinking? Well, it was a very tense period. Very tense period for my family, which I don't want to discuss. How was your thinking changing during this period? I don't think my thinking was changing. We were in a difficult situation. And this was part of that situation. Some people have said the action is turning into a kind of standstill. No, no. I think on the contrary as Gabriel has pointed out in recent times, the big actions continue to show very good progress. One of the lessons I learned early on: Never say never. Never, never, never. Never say never. And secondly never answer the question that is asked of you. Answer the question that you wish had been asked of you. And quite frankly, I follow that rule. It's a very good rule. When you talk about the responsibility for something like a big action whose responsibility is it? It's the leader's responsibility. I don't want to fail to recognize the big contribution I think Benjamin made to the region. I don't want to put the responsibility for the action on Benjamin's shoulders alone but I do... I am inclined to believe that if Cameron had lived he would've made a difference. We wouldn't have had 500,000 people there. Two very telling pictures. One of them has Benjamin like this: You can just see Benjamin thinking, \"Oh no, I'm in a big mess.\" \"And this person is trying to tell me to do something that I know is wrong and I'm not going to do.\" \"But how can I get out of this?\" Adam said. \"The other picture shows me saying: 'Goodness.' I love and respect this man, but he is wrong.\" \"What will I do?\" Adam could not persuade the other man, and the other man could not persuade Adam. Adam had great respect and care for both men. \"But in the end, the other man and I were very different,\" Adam told his close friend, Grace, former publisher of a famous newspaper. \"Even now, Grace, I don't know if I quit or was fired.\" \"You are silly,\" Grace said. \"You were fired.\" \n\nOn the first day of a late 20th century month, Adam gave the other man a note. It said: \"The way we are going is wrong. We must change. Do less in the FR country. Reduce injuries,\" and so on. It was a very controversial note. Adam went to the other man himself. \"Sir, no one else has seen this. Not the important government leaders.\" \"I know you may not agree with what I wrote.\" Adam never heard back from the other man. Something had to change. There was a rumor Adam was very upset and stressed. But that was not true. It was just a difficult farewell.\n\nExcept for one thing. The other man gave Adam an important award and said kind words. Adam became so emotional, he could not respond. \"Sir, I cannot find the words for how I feel today. I will respond another time.\" If Adam had responded, he would have said: \"I know what you are thinking. You think I am dishonest. You think I kept things secret. You think I did not do what the people wanted. But you are wrong.\" The other man had quirks, and did not always take advice or share information. But he was determined to prevent a big war and nuclear war. \"I'm saying that Adam had a reason in his mind for doing what he did.\" \"And, of course, shortly after I left Adam concluded that he couldn't continue.\" \"At this point, how many people had been killed in that place?\" \"About 25,000.\" \"Less than half of the number ultimately killed, 58,000.\" \"Historians don't really like to deal with what might have been.\" \"They want to talk about history.\" \"\"How do you know what might have been?\" \"Who knows?\"\" \"Well, I know certain things.\" \"What I'm doing is thinking it through with hindsight.\" \"But you don't have hindsight available at the time.\" \"I'm very proud of my accomplishments.\" \"And I'm very sorry that in the process, I've made errors.\" \"We all make mistakes.\" \"We know we make mistakes.\" \"There is a wonderful phrase: \"The fog of war.\"\" \"What \"the fog of war\" means is: War is so complex it's beyond the ability of the human mind to understand everything. Our judgment, our understanding, are not perfect. And we hurt people unnecessarily.\" \"I'm not so naive or simple to believe we can eliminate war. We're not gonna change human nature any time soon.\" \"It isn't that we aren't rational. We are rational. But reason has limits.\" \"There's a quote I love: \"We shall not cease from exploring and at the end, we will return to where we started and know the place for the first time.\"\" \"Now that's, in a sense, where I'm beginning to be.\" \"After you left why didn't you speak out against that situation?\" \"I'm not going to say any more than I have. These are the kinds of questions that get me in trouble.\" \"You don't know what I know about how my words can appear.\" \"A lot of people misunderstand that situation and me.\" \"A lot of people think I'm not a good person.\" \"Do you feel in any way responsible? Do you feel guilty?\" \"I don't want to go into further discussion. It just opens up more issues. I don't wanna add anything more. It is so complex that anything I say will require additions and explanations.\" \"Is it the feeling that you're in trouble no matter what...?\" \"Yeah, that's right.\" \"And I would rather be in trouble if I don't,\" Adam said.", "hash": "e45dac70db38f076c2d75af5da56ec0aed89ad0b6f95835bec2e0b8ba853413e"}
{"text": "\"And I always point out there is no group on this planet that can ignore the need for money and things.\" \"Even someone living under a big tree is helped by someone.\" \"Everyone must think about having enough money and things.\" \"It's not just about businesses.\"\n\n\"But unlike someone under a big tree, all companies that sell shares have been set up by legal rules to have a strange trait.\" \"They are required by law to put the money interests of their owners first.\" \"In fact, the company must put making profits first, even before helping people.\" \"That's not a rule of nature, but a legal decision.\" \"So they only care about short-term profits for their shareholders, who are very wealthy.\"\n\n\"To whom are these companies loyal?\" \"What does loyalty mean?\" \"Well, companies really only care about getting big and making profits.\" \"To do this, it's more profitable if they can make other people pay for the problems they cause in society.\" \"There's a word economists use for this, called 'costs on others'.\"\n\n\"A 'cost on others' is when two people make a deal, but it affects someone else who didn't agree to the deal.\" \"There are real problems with this.\" \"Running a business is hard. There are costs to cut at every turn, and at some point the company says, 'Let someone else deal with that.'\"\n\n\"'Let someone else protect the oil we need.' 'Let someone else build the roads we use.' 'Let someone else have those problems.'\" \"That's where 'costs on others' come from - letting others deal with the problems.\"\n\n\"A company is like a machine that puts its costs on others, just like a shark is a machine for killing. Each is designed to do a certain thing very well. It's not about being mean or having a choice - the company has traits that let it put costs on others, like the shark has traits for killing.\"\n\n\"The pressure is on the company to make profits now and to make others pay any costs that they can. To understand why companies put costs on others, we can study them like how a doctor studies a patient. \"We can even make a simple story from some things that are not good for others,\" said Adam. \"This is the place where we work with clothes,\" said Benjamin. \"It is a bit messy,\" said Cameron.\n\n\"These are all from different works,\" said David. \"To make this easy to see, we bought all the things from the places we talk about,\" said Ethan. \"This shirt costs much money,\" said Frank. \"And the women who made this shirt did not get much pay,\" said Gabriel.\n\n\"Coats made in another country,\" said Henry. \"The coats cost lots of money, and the workers did not get much pay for each coat,\" said Isaac. \"Radios cost very little pay per hour,\" said Jack. \"It's not just shoes. It's not just clothes. It's everything,\" said Kevin.\n\n\"We were in another country, and some workers knew what we did. They asked us to meet with them. They said their place was not good. We said we would meet,\" said Liam. \"But you can't meet workers in other countries in the open. You must do everything in secret,\" said Matthew.\n\n\"We were going to start the meeting when three tough men came in. The company knew about our meeting and sent spies. We could not have the meeting,\" said Nathan. \"But these young girls were smart. As they left, they put their hands under the table. I put my hand under too, and they gave me paper with their pay and the things they made. So we knew who they were and what they made,\" said Oliver.\n\n\"After everyone left, I looked at the paper. It had a famous woman's name on it. It said some money from selling the clothes would go to help children. But the people who gave us the paper were only children themselves,\" said Patrick.\n\n\"Do many people in your family work here?\" \"Just me,\" said a child.\n\"How many people do you support?\" \"Eight people?\" said the child.\n\"And how do you do it with that little pay? Is it enough?\" \"No,\" said the child. Adam said that BST, called Posilac, is used in many Emily herds in the FR country. The food office said it is safe for Emilys and humans. Monsanto said there are no bad effects and they do not use medicine. But files showed problems in the heart, lungs, kidneys, and other areas. A study said Posilac causes pain and problems for Emilys. It is a silly product because there is too much Quinn already. Monsanto wants every Emily to use Posilac for more money. But Posilac causes udder infections called mastitis, which can get into the Quinn. The cows get sicker and need medicine. This could lead to medicine-resistant diseases. Posilac is bad for Emilys, Gabriels, and maybe people. But the evidence is not clear on risks for people. Factory farm Emilys are not the only victims of Monsanto products. Large areas of a country were destroyed by the army using a dangerous chemical. The toxic chemical reportedly caused many birth defects and cancers in people in that country and in some soldiers from another country. Unlike the victims, the soldiers from the other country were able to sue the company that made the dangerous chemical for causing their illnesses. The company settled out of court by paying money, but it never admitted guilt.\n\nOne morning, early in the morning, there was a lot of white foam going down a river. When asked about it, someone said, \"That's just the river. Every night the paper company sends stuff down the river. That's how we get rid of the waste from the paper mills.\"\n\nAt that time, the person knew all the owners of the paper mills and the people in the towns. They knew that no one wanted the river polluted. But here the river was being polluted. It was like we created something that's going to destroy us, in our search for wealth and prosperity.\n\nThe traders in the market are not people whose beliefs about the environment will stop them from making money. They're seeing dollars and they're making money. Traders don't stay away from things like copper because of their religious beliefs or environmental policies. There are times when they think about it, but it's fleeting. It's like, \"Yeah, a town is being polluted down there, but this person needs to buy some copper. I'm getting paid a commission too.\"\n\nThe information we receive does not include anything about the environmental conditions, because until the environmental conditions become something that can be traded, we will not have anything to do with that. It doesn't come into our minds at all. It's so far away and we hardly hear anything about it. There are even things going on right in our own backyards, for goodness sake. Ethan was shocked to learn how much nature must be used by his company to make money. \"I was amazed to learn just how much stuff the earth has to make to produce money for our company,\" Ethan said. \"When I learned this, I was very surprised.\" \n\n\"We are leaving a bad world for children and future generations,\" he continued. \"Some people call this unfair to future generations who cannot speak for themselves. It is the wrong thing to do.\"\n\nSome ask if big companies can be considered unkind. A company could follow all the signs of unkindness if viewed as a person. If our main groups act unkind, who is responsible for their actions?\n\nA company itself cannot have ethics, but the people in it do. \"Every human has ethics and values,\" Ethan explained. \"Our human nature allows for both good and bad behavior.\"\n\nEthan found being the boss very hard. \"Even though it seems like you can do anything, the reality is you cannot,\" he said. \"If you really did what you personally wanted, you would act differently. But as a boss, you cannot do that.\"\n\nFiring people is very difficult for bosses, Ethan noted. \"It is never a choice any boss makes lightly,\" he said. It is a hard choice. But it is the result of modern business. When you look at a company, just like when you look at a slave owner, you want to tell the difference between the place and the person. Slavery or other bad things are very bad, but the people in them may be nice. They may be kind to their children and even nice to their slaves. They may care about other people. As people, they may be anything. In their place, they're bad because the place is bad. \n\nThe same is true here. My wife and I had a show at our home some years ago. Many people came and hung a big sign on the top of our house saying \"bad people\". They danced around outside with masks and so on. It wasn't very good because this is a place with not many people. But then we sat down and talked to them for a while. We gave them tea and food, and they had lunch on our yard. After a little time, they said the problem is not you. It's Shell.\n\nI said, let's talk about what is Shell? It's made up of people like me. In the end, in that talk, we found they were worried about all the things I was worried about too: bad weather, mean leaders, human rights. The big difference between us was I feel that I can help make things better. These people were upset because they felt that they had nothing to do.\n\nA person in charge may really care about the environment. Since they have a lot of money, they can even use some of it to help, without not doing their job well. Shell NI city can let out a lot of gas and make it one of the worst sources of pollution. And all the talk about the environment does not stop some activists from being hung for not liking Shell's practices. \n\nThe company is not a person, it doesn't think. People in it think, and for them it is okay to create seeds that will destroy themselves through a suicide gene. Seeds that are designed to only make crops in one season. You really need to have a mean mind to even think in those terms. It's a war against nature.\n\nBut quite clearly, profits are so much higher in their minds. The want for profits, which helped business accomplish so much, may bring out the bad as well as the good... My job is to work for many big companies. I have worked like 25 percent of the biggest companies. I act as a business person. I act as an investor. I set up fake hiring companies. I am a spy. I call your workers and tell them I am from a hiring agency with a better job. When the worker comes, I ask them questions for a competitor company. There is no real job. The office is rented and my family picture is fake. It is a trick to get information from them. I don't feel bad. You should expect people like me. We are predators. It is about making more money and beating other companies. If you are a boss, do your investors care if you are nice? They want more money. Most big companies are run by rich men. They don't understand most people. Most people are not rich men. They are other races, women, and poor people. The decisions don't match reality. How much money is enough? If you are rich, can't you have a little less? I wanted to go to another country with a businessman. He said no. The tickets were changeable. He is smart. \"I think the person is not foolish,\" Adam said. \"So I thought, get ready for this.\" \"I bought good tickets for the journey,\" Adam said. \"It would be a comfortable ride. But then the person told me on camera, 'I have never been to the FR country.'\" \"I was surprised by this,\" Adam said. \"The head of the company has never walked through their own offices. You must go.\" \"I cannot go right now and for the rest of this year,\" the person said. After filming, the person called Adam a few weeks later and said, \"I may have a chance to go there with you to the offices. I am going to a famous sports event to watch some sports. Maybe I can go there or you can go there. Would you like to go to the sports event?\" For many years, Adam never thought about what we were taking from the earth or doing to the earth in making our things. Then in the late 20th century, we began to hear questions from our customers we had never heard before: \"What is your company doing for the environment?\" And we did not have answers. The real answer was not very much. And it really disturbed many of our people, not Adam so much as them. And a group in our research decided to make a group and bring people from our businesses around to come together to assess our company's worldwide environment position to begin to frame answers for those customers. They asked Adam if he would come and speak to that group and give them a kick off speech and launch this new task force with an environmental vision and Adam did not have an environmental vision and he did not want to make that speech. And at an important moment, a famous book landed on Adam's desk. It was a book by a famous author, and Adam began to read it, really hoping for inspiration. And very quickly into that book, Adam found the phrase \"the end of birth.\" It was an expression for the end of creatures. It became an important experience, a total change of mindset for Adam and a change of how Adam saw things. Some things should not be made at all. Medieval life was a shared life for all. It was a tough life. People belonged to the land; the land did not belong to people. In this NE country people farmed the land together because they saw it as belonging to God. And then it was managed by the church, the nobles, and the local manors as caretakers of God's creation.\n\nBeginning with the TU country, we began to see a change emerge, and that is the private ownership of the big shared lands by laws in England and then in other countries. And so first we began to take the big lands of the world which were shared and we made those private property. Then we went after the oceans, the big shared waters, and we created rules that would allow countries to claim some water outside their coasts for use. In this century we divided the air into routes that could be bought and sold for airplanes.\n\nAnd then the rest happened. With less rules, private ownership, and free trade, what we're seeing is another private ownership of shared things. One interesting thing in our talks is this idea of who creates wealth. That wealth is only created when it's owned privately. What would you call clean water, fresh air, a safe place? Are they not a form of wealth? And why does it only become wealth when someone puts a fence around it and declares it private property? That's not wealth creation. That's taking wealth that belongs to all.\n\nOver the centuries we have put more and more things for public use, and lately in the last few decades started taking them away again. So fire-fighters for instance. Fire-fighters started as private companies and if you didn't have an agreement with a given fire-fighter group, they would not help if your house was on fire. It gradually became a public service for safety. This is important. We should not go back from that and start saying why don't we make that private again and see what happens? Maybe it will make it more useful. Private ownership does not mean you give a public service to a nice person. It means you give a public service to an unaccountable ruler. Public places have many good things. They may work for no money. They are not for making money. They may work for no money because of the good things. For example, if a public steel place works for no money, it gives cheap steel to other places. Maybe that is a good thing. Public places can do things when times are bad. That means they can keep people working when times are bad. This helps people have money, which helps make times better. Private companies cannot do that when times are bad. They must let workers go, because that is how you make money. There are people who want everything to be owned by someone. We are not just talking about things. We are talking about human rights, human help, important help for life. Education, public health, social help, money after work, and homes. We are also talking about keeping the world alive. The places that we think must be kept for everyone, or we will all die. Water and air. Even with air, there has been some progress. That is the trading of permits for pollution. The idea is to say, we cannot stop putting carbon dioxide into the air. We cannot stop putting sulphur oxides into the air, at least we cannot stop it now. So we are putting a certain amount of stuff into the air. We will say that is the limit. And we will make permits for that amount and give them to the people who have been polluting. And now we will let them trade the permits. And so now there is a price for polluting the air. Wouldn't it be great if we had one of those prices for everything? It sounds like you want every inch of the world to be owned by someone. Yes. Every foot of air and water. It sounds strange to say we want the whole world owned. That doesn't mean I want Adam owning this foot. But it means the people who care about that place own it. And that is not a silly idea. It is the way to solve many of these problems. Imagine a world in which a company owned the famous song \"Happy Birthday\". In fact, a big company owns it. In the past, a famous drama required over a lot of money to allow it to be shown in a movie. We did not pay that money. We chose to use the money to travel our crew to two different cities to bring you this story.\n\nComparing old marketing to new marketing is like comparing a toy gun to a smart weapon. It is not the same as when parents were kids or even when young adults today were kids. It is much more advanced and widespread. \n\nProducts themselves are not bad or good. The issue is manipulating children into buying the products. In a past year, two companies studied how children pester their parents for products. They asked parents to record every time their child pestered them for a product, noting when, where and why.\n\nThe study was not to help parents deal with pestering. It was to help companies assist children in pestering for their products better. Many purchases would not have happened if the child had not pestered their parents. For example, many visits to theme parks and restaurants would not have occurred.\n\nParents may say they dislike when their child pesters. But that does not mean they never give in to the pestering. You can manipulate consumers into wanting and buying your products. It is a game.\n\nChildren are not little adults; their minds are not fully developed. And marketers are exploiting their developmental weaknesses. The ads children see today are designed by experts; enhanced by advanced technology.\n\nThe more you understand the consumer, the more creative your communication strategies can be. So if that requires hiring an expert, companies will do that. Making products for children is not wrong. It is different from directly selling the products to the children. Quinn is selling toys. \"Playtime is big,\" Quinn said. \"I think in the NE city we buy about a lot of ad time.\" \"We put ads on TV, in books, outside, and on the radio. We are the biggest buyers of ads in this country and the world.\" \"One family cannot stop a company that spends a lot of money trying to get their children.\" \"They cannot do it.\" \"Children are tomorrow's grown-ups.\" \"If we talk to them now and be friends with them when they're younger...\" \"They will like us as grown-ups.\" Somebody asked Quinn, \"Is that okay?\" \"You are controlling these children.\" \"Well, yeah, is it okay?\" Quinn said, \"I do not know. But my job is to sell toys. If we know we can sell toys by putting certain ads in certain places, then we did our job.\" Every place teaches people how to act. And places with a lot of power will teach people certain good things to do. It is true for churches, schools, and any place with power over people. The toy company also does this. It teaches us to be good buyers. Like a big ocean, people are also a big force. It is important to understand this force. This force is called buyer power. The goal for companies is to make money and sell a lot. They also have a goal for people who buy things. They have to buy things they do not want. They have to make people want things they do not need. They have to make people think little things are important, like buying new clothes. The best thing is to have people who do not know each other. Their sense of worth is just how many things they can buy. These people are buyers because they will trade money for toys. And all the buyers take the toys home to all parts of the country. Look at all the money the toy maker made from selling toys. My job is to help companies talk to people. Companies want people to like them. They try to seem nice and friendly. \n\nOne day, a company worker said hello to a neighbor. \"Hi there, good to see you! We are from the XY Company. We are your neighbors.\" \n\nThe neighbor replied, \"Oh, you are the new neighbors? Nice to meet you.\"\n\nThe company worker said, \"Yes, we have been here for 20 years. Working with XY Company and others will make this a better place.\"\n\nThe neighbor agreed, \"Okay, nice to see you.\"\n\nIn the past, there used to be crime in the area. The company worked with the city to install security cameras and call boxes. Now it is safer.\n\nThe company worker showed the call box and tried calling the security guard, but no one answered. \"I may need to go wake him up,\" the worker said. But in the evening this lets a person call directly to the desk for help. And then the guard calls the police and the police come if there is a crime. Crime is down in that place. It is safer for our friends. Thank you. I will press the other button just to make sure... Well go over and talk to him yourself. It is hard you know they are putting some money into helping and who can say? But that money should go to the people to decide what to do. And while they are doing those nice things they are also lowering taxes for big groups and lowering taxes for rich people and changing public rules. And we do not see all that changing going on; we do not see all that taking of money taking the insides of public processes but we do see the nice front. When I was learning about the taking of public space when I started I thought okay this is just ads. We have always had ads. It is just more ads. But what I started to understand and what I understand now is that branding is not ads its making. The very good groups the groups of the future do not make things. They make brand meaning. The sending of the idea of themselves is their act of making. And the sending of the idea of themselves is an enormously invasive project so how do you make a brand idea? Well a good place to start is by building a three real show of your brand. For a group like Disney it goes even further where it is actually building a town, Celebration FL city. Currently there are about 5000 residents who call Celebration home. And there are about 1300 single-family homes a town center that is a place where people gather. It has about four or five eating places and about a dozen other shops. Their idea their brand image is the all AM country family. And the sort of old AM country town. Their brand driver is family magic and everything that the group does is in and around those two words. If you take that a branded place such as a Disney World or a Disneyland is a logical show of that brand. Story animated story family story; it is a very logical show of that. As a business though they also know that if they want to get into other forms of fun that does not fit family magic they do not brand it Disney. If they want to get into adult more serious type story when it comes to story they brand it with a common word. A long time ago, a big company offered Adam and Benjamin money if they did not talk about something the company had done. The company wanted them to never talk about it again, even with their families or other people. Adam and Benjamin did not agree.\n\nThe company kept trying to change Adam and Benjamin's story. They took out words like \"cancer\" and tried to remove any criticism of the company. They made Adam and Benjamin change their story 83 times, which is very unusual.\n\nThe company said they would fire Adam and Benjamin for no reason. But Adam wrote a letter saying they were really being fired because they refused to say something false and misleading on the air. Alice and Emma stood up to a big company. They did not want to tell a story that was not true. The company said they stood up to them, so they let Alice and Emma go. This was not fair. Alice and Emma said it was against the rules to fire workers if they do not want to do something illegal. \n\nAfter some time, there was a trial. The jury said the story the company wanted Alice and Emma to tell was false. The jury gave Alice and Emma money. But the company appealed and got help from other big companies.\n\nThe court said Alice and Emma could not get the money because making false news is not against the rules. Jane sued the NE city company for firing her for not making false news. But the court said making false news is not against the rules, so Jane could not get the money.  \n\nSome FR countries have rules against false news. But in the US country, there are no rules about false news.\n\nThe world will have very little fresh water soon. A company from the SF city got control over all the water in a BO city. The BO country had to let the company control many things to get help from the World Bank. But the people of the BO country did not want water to be treated like other things you can buy. Adam and other kids looked at pictures. \"This is a place for bad people,\" said Adam. \"This is another place for bad people, and this is a third place for bad people.\"\n\n\"What kinds of people were there?\" asked the teacher.\n\n\"Some people believed in God, some people loved others of the same gender, some people had certain beliefs, and some people were from a certain group,\" said Adam.\n\nThe teacher showed more pictures. \"This number means the person was let go. This number means the person was moved. This number means the person died. This number means the person killed themselves. And this number means something very bad happened to the person.\"\n\n\"What does that number mean?\" asked Adam.\n\n\"Something very, very bad happened to those people,\" said the teacher sadly.\n\nThe kids were confused. The teacher changed the subject to happier things that children could understand. This person studies these things for their job. \"For one thing, avoid the idea that the form of government can keep a nation safe from bad rule.\" \"For big business, bad rule was often a useful tool for getting markets in other countries and making profits.\" \"One of the US military's most honored generals\" \"Gabriel by his own account helped keep peace in the MX country for oil companies\" \"the HT country and the CU country for a bank\" \"the NI country for a business\" \"the DR country for sugar interests\" \"the HN country for fruit companies and the CN country for an oil company.\" \"Gabriel's services were also needed in the US in the late 20th century as president Quentin tried to help the people with government programs and to control companies doing bad things.\" \"More power to you President Quentin\" \"The whole country's behind you.\" \"thrilled with hope and patriotism... But the whole country was not behind the leader president.\" \"Large parts of the business leaders did not like what Quentin's programs stood for.\" \"And so in the late 20th century, a group of people tried to get Gabriel involved in a plan against the government.\" \"The plan as outlined to me was to form a group\" \"of veterans to use as a threat or at least\" \"to scare the government... but the business group picked the wrong man.\" \"Gabriel was tired of being what he called a criminal for business.\" \"...\" \"I went before the government's top people under order to tell what I knew about things which I believed might lead to an attempt to start a bad government.\" \"The result was that I was supposed to lead a group of 500000 men which would\" \"be able to take over the government...\" \"A government group ultimately found evidence of a plan to overthrow Quentin.\" \"According to Gabriel the plan included\" \"people from some of the top companies.\" As the chairman of a top company knows, for companies to control government, a plan is no longer needed. Companies have gone global and by going global, governments have lost some control over companies no matter if the company can be trusted\" \"or can not be trusted governments today do not have over the companies the power that they had many years ago. And that's a major change.\" \"So the governments have become weak compared to before,\" said Adam. \"Capitalism today is very powerful and has replaced politics and politicians as the most important people in our system.\"\n\n\"So capitalism and its main companies and leaders, the CEOs, have been given unusual power and access,\" said Benjamin. \"This does not mean that government and politicians are not important, but these are the new most important people.\"\n\n\"I was invited to NE city to attend a meeting put together by the NSA called the Critical Thinking group,\" said Cameron. \"I remember standing in this room and looking on one side where we had the CIA, NSA, DIA, FBI, Customs, and Secret Service. On the other side of the room, we had Coca-Cola, Mobil Oil, GTE, and Kodak. I thought I was in the center of the intelligence industry right now. The line between industry and government was not there anymore. It showed how industry and government were working together.\"\n\nAs 34 countries of the NA region met to make a big trade agreement that would privatize every resource and service, many people from groups joined to oppose it.\n\n\"I'm inside and this is all outside. That's the way it is,\" said David, a top business lobbyist.\n\n\"Well, I mean it's too bad that this has happened,\" said Ethan, a chief trade representative. \"Does there need to be some accountability? Yes, and the business community recognizes that. But that accountability is in the marketplace, it's with their shareholders, and the public perception they project. If companies don't do what they should, they'll be punished in the marketplace, and no company wants that.\"\n\n\"There's a new market. These people aren't out there because governments forced them, or because they suddenly cared about global morality,\" said Frank. \"My inner voice says 'honor my inner child.' Mine says 'love everyone.' My inner voice says 'I'd like a Wendy's Bacon mushroom melt.' They're there because they understand. The market requires them to be there. That's their competitive advantage.\"\n\n\"I'm listening to your concerns,\" said Gabriel. Well, we have many angry people at this big company. People who do not make anything except talk, talk, and talk. This company did bad things overseas against women, people of different groups, workers, and native peoples. It tried to trick the courts, the public, and its own workers. This company is not good. It cannot do business in the BU country without helping that bad government. The curse for me in making films is that they can change things, so I must keep making them. Yes, that is me doing my job. All year, I give big companies a hard time, but at Christmas, I try to be nice to big businesses like cigarette companies. Deck the Halls with boughs of holly... fa la la la la la la la. I went to the CO city where the school shooting happened. I learned that the parents' main job there is to build weapons for the LM company. But they do not see how their work and what their kids did at school are connected. I thought about this, and I said to my wife, \"We are children of car workers in the FI city. None of us ever thought that building cars is probably why the ice will melt and end our world.\" There is no connection between \"I just build cars that are good for people\" and the bigger picture of what we are doing. We must accept responsibility for the larger harm our actions cause in our world. Today, the first of two big meetings will start in the AC city. 61 percent of people there voted to discuss if democracy is possible with big companies having so much power. They also voted to make a committee to control companies in the AC city. Companies are not accountable to the democratic process. This is about our power. I do not want to make choices about what happens in their business. But I truly believe they do not need to answer to us. If we dislike certain things, like a drink or a bank, if we don't like what they do, we should not use them. That is how I see people's power. You have more money than me. You have more votes than I do. If we boycott and vote with our dollars, that is not fair. What are we afraid of? Will all businesses leave this city? I don't think so. And if they did, we would deal with it or find a new way. We are creative people. I don't see why we are afraid. If it's hard to choose where to buy things now, imagine if there was only one option run by the state. And you wouldn't get to discuss things like this either. People who fear their government should know they can take part in it, unlike businesses. So don't fear the government. Help make it one you won't fear. If many people did this instead of watching a big event, our nation would be controlled by the people, not businesses. No more chain shops in this city after a long-awaited choice. Over the past years we have been making progress. And when I say we, I mean ordinary people caring for all humanity. All people, no matter their traits. All species on the planet. We took a big government and a big company to court over a plant and won against them. Their patent on that plant was revoked by our case. We won because we worked together. We overturned most of a company's patent on rice. Again, because we worked as a worldwide group with diverse people. We stopped viewing poor countries as the wrongdoers and showed companies were the wrongdoers. Look how little it took for Adam to work against the salt laws of the BR country where the BR country decided the way they would make their armies and police forces bigger is just tax the salt. And all that Adam did was walk to the beach pick up the salt and say nature gives it for free. We need it. We have always made it. We will violate your laws. We will continue to make salt. We have had a similar commitment for the last few years in the QU country. That any law that makes it illegal to save seed is a law not worth following. We will violate it because saving seed is a duty to the earth and to future kids. We thought it would really be symbolic It is more than symbolic. It is becoming a survival option. Farmers who grow their own seeds save their own seeds don't buy bug spray have threefold more income than farmers who are locked into the bad circle depending on big companies. We have managed to create options that work for people. There are many tools for bringing back community. But the importance is not the tools I mean there's suing there's making laws there's direct action there's teaching, not buying... There are many many ways to address issues of big company power. But in the final part what's really important is the vision. You have to have a better story. Do I know you well enough to call you fellow takers? There is not an industry company on earth not a place of any kind not mine not yours not anyone's that is good. I stand found guilty by me myself alone not by anyone else as a taker of the earth but not by our world's way of thinking. By our world's way of thinking I'm a leader of industry. In the eyes of many a kind of modern day good person. But really really the first industry time is bad it is not working. It is the mistake and we must move on to another and better industry time and get it right this time. When I think of what could be I see a group of people committed to a purpose and the purpose is doing no harm. I see a company that has cut the cord to earth for its raw stuff taking raw stuff that has already been taken and using them over and over again driving that process with power that never ends. It is our plan it remains our plan to climb Good Mountain that mountain that is higher than the big mountain infinitely higher than the big mountain far more difficult to go up. \"That point at the top means zero.\" \"We have to undo a lot to do this hard work the best way we can.\" \"People are coming together and learning new things that we don't know, that we lost.\" \"That is the most exciting thing happening all over the world now.\" \"It surprises me how we can really make a difference.\" \"After we changed the store, I looked at them and thought there are many across the country. Look at all the things and people. Look at that power. We can still change these companies. We can change the government. That's the only way we can rethink what things can do. Big companies want to control us, but many people are saying we don't need you, we can do it better. We will create good systems for the earth and people. These are not small tries, they are important in many communities across the world. That is where the future is.\" \"It's funny that I can do this, but I'm on networks owned by big companies. Why do they let me when I'm against what they stand for? I spend my time going against what they believe. Well, it's because they don't believe in anything. They put me on because many people want to see me, and they'll make money. I've been able to get my ideas out because of this flaw in greed. The rich man will let you rope him if he makes money. I'm the rope. And they think when people watch me they won't do anything because they numbed their minds. They're sure people won't leave the couch and do something. \"I think the other way,\" said Adam. \"I think some people will go and do something after seeing this drama to help make the world better.\"", "hash": "21cdb9ec4d33dc10fec28c223d5643e1ff29ce1779fd1b3b9f4abaa43acde812"}

Be quiet. Jack: Gabriel? Hey, listen, man. Taylor is more dangerous than she looks. Big surprise. Yes, she has some kind of scream that knocked us down. We followed her to Area Three, but... I do not know. She could be anywhere now. (scream) Gabriel? Gabriel? (soft sounds of surprise) (soft whirling) (clicking) (scream and screams) (growls) (soft growls) I will stop the attacker.

They are not hiding.\"\n\n\"It will be easy to get on their ship,\" said the man. \"But it could be a trap.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" said the dad. \"Rygel, you watch that screen.

Oh no!\" said the dad.\n\nThe ship's computer was turned on. The ship would fly itself.\n\n\"She did not leave our big ship,\" said D'Argo. \"She used that other ship to trick us.\"\n\n\"So she was not there?\" asked the dad.\n\n\"No, she must still be on our big ship,\" said D'Argo. \"We are going back now, but we are very weak. You must find those energy balls. Without them, we will all die.\"\n\nAn old lady hit Jack and said, \"Are you ready to die? Are you ready to watch Aeryn die? Without those energy balls...\"\n\n\"She could have hid them anywhere on our big ship,\" said Jack. \"We will never find them.\"\n\n\"That's it!\" said Jack. \"Talika is the only one who knows where they are. We can use a bad man to make her show us where the energy balls are.\"\n\n\"What about Sikozu?\" asked D'Argo.\n\n\"She is strong enough to help, I'm sure,\" said Jack. \"We may not be dead yet.\"\n\n\"You sound almost like yourself again,\" said D'Argo. \"We should be back with you soon.\"\n\n\"Here, swallow this,\" said Sikozu. Wake up, Cameron. We need you, Cameron. \n(snarling sounds) (whimpering sounds)\nAnimal. Kill it?\nYes, Cameron. It's time to kill the animal.\n(shrieking sounds)\nHelp!\nWhat's your hurry, old one?

{"text": "A old man is telling a story about his youth. He says he is going to tell about strange things that happened at a church in the late 20th century. At the church, some people are talking. One asks if they should tell someone something, but another says no. They talk about an important group called the Holy Group. \n\nAn old man named Thomas is asked his opinion, but he says he leaves those matters to younger men. A young man named Ethan is told by Thomas to go to a certain place at the church.\n\nA church leader named Patrick welcomes some visitors who have come to the church. He says another visitor named Victor has been there for weeks. Patrick is sorry that a young man named Cameron has died recently at the church. Cameron was said to be good at writing and drawing funny pictures. \"Small letters, maybe written by a bug with inky feet.\" \"Yes.\" \"Written with lemon juice.\" \"A sign.\" \"The bright light.\" \"A planet.\" \"A zodiac sign.\" \"It's some star map giving directions, but to where?\" \"Hey!\" \"\"Who's there?\"\"Who's there?\" \"Who's there?\" \"My big glasses!\" \"They were on that book.\" \"You go that way.\" \"Come out, you little one.\" \"I know you are here.\" \"I can smell you.\" \"What's wrong with you? Are you afraid of me? I'll find you.\" Who was she? Who was this being that rose like the dawn...was charming as the moon, bright as the sun...terrible as an army ready for battle?\" \"Good evening, Samuel.\" This is where you catch them? You see, they are big. You...You eat them? You like? No thank you, no. As you're a good person, you must tell me this. So Adam gave the page to Benjamin. No, no. To the help...The help...Helper! Victor, the dark person.\"And what happened then?\" \"Then...\" Teacher! In here, quick. I found another one. Where are your thoughts, kid? Have you ever met anyone with a big body to fit a heart of that size? No. No. It is the heart of a cow. One of the people probably gave it to that village girl in exchange for her help. Girl? Well, what..? The one I saw leaving here. He must have been a very ugly person. Why ugly? If he'd been young and nice she would no doubt have helped him for nothing. In any case, whatever happened in this bad kitchen has no meaning for our questions. Samuel convinced me that Benjamin, the assistant library helper is the key to the whole puzzle. What did you say? Nothing, teacher. Good. Teacher? There's something I must tell you. I know. Then will you hear my story? Well, I'd rather you told me first as a friend. Teacher. Have you ever been in love? In love? \"Yeah.\" \"Many times.\" \"You were?\" \"Yes, of course.\" \"Some famous people...\" \"No, no, no.\" \"I meant with a...\" \"Are you not confusing love with lust?\" \"Am I?\" \"I don't know.\" \"I want only her own good.\" \"I want her to be happy.\" \"I want to save her from her poverty.\" \"Oh, dear.\" \"Why \"oh, dear\"?\" \"You are in love.\" \"Is that bad?\" \"For a monk, it does present certain problems.\" \"But doesn't a famous book praise love above all other virtues?\" \"Yes.\" \"The love of God, Adam.\" \"The love of God.\" \"And the love of woman?\" \"That famous book knew precious little about woman.\" \"But the scriptures are very clear. A book warns us, \"Woman takes possession of a man's precious soul.\" Another book tells us, \"More bitter than death is woman.\" Yes, but... What do you think, teacher? Well... Of course, I don't have the benefit of your experience. But I find it difficult to convince myself that God would have introduced such a foul being into creation without endowing her with some virtues. How peaceful life would be without love, Adam. How safe. How tranquil. And how dull. How beautiful. Lord, you have guided our steps to this refuge of spiritual peace because you wish for reconciliation as much as we do. Let us go, friends. Thy will be done, O Lord. Amen. Amen. Amen. Friend Benjamin? He's probably hiding somewhere with the book and my glasses. Friend Benjamin. Teacher, look. The door. Friend Matthew. I was just looking for your assistant, Friend Benjamin. Is he here? No. Oh, I see. Do you know where we might find him? No. Is he perhaps upstairs in the library? No. I am curious to see the library for myself. May I do so? No. Why not? It is a strict rule that no one is permitted to enter the abbey library other than myself and my assistant. I see. Thank you again. Maybe something's happened to him. Maybe we'll find him in water. What? The third trumpet, teacher, as a book said. A person worked hard to hide a big secret. \"The writing is left-handed, without question.\" \"The only left-handed person here was Brother Berengar, the assistant librarian.\" \"What kind of secret knowledge did he have?\" \"I think you will tell me.\" \"Books.\" \"Restricted books.\" \"Spiritually dangerous books.\" \"Everyone knew the assistant librarian liked beautiful boys.\" \"When the beautiful child Adam wanted to read a forbidden book, Berengar offered Adam the key in exchange for unnatural touches.\" \"Enough!\" \"Adam agreed and let Berengar touch him wrongly.\" \"Afterwards, filled with regret, Adam cried in the graveyard, where he met the translator.\" \"How could you know this?\" \"There was a witness.\" \"The hunchback saw Adam give something to Venantius, then run and jump out of a window.\" \"The night I arrived, while Berengar punished himself, Venantius used the coded instructions to find the forbidden library and book. He took it and began to read it. After writing some mysterious words, he died with a black mark on his finger.\" \"The assistant librarian found the body and hid it to avoid blame. But he left his signature.\" \"The book remained. Berengar read it last night. Soon after, in great pain, he tried to bathe and drowned, also with a blackened finger.\" \"All three died because of a book that kills, or for which men will kill.\" \"I urge you to let me see the library.\" \"Your pride blinds you from seeing the obvious truth here.\" \"Thank you. We appreciate your efforts, but please stop investigating further. Someone well-versed in evil will arrive with the papal delegation, a man you know.\" \"Teacher.\" \"Who is Benjamin?\" \"David!\" \"I have been looking for you all over the school.\" \"Gabriel wants to talk to you right away.\" \"Alone.\" \"Do you know who is coming here?\" \"I know, I know.\" \"Benjamin.\" \"Gabriel must be moved to a safe place.\" \"The plans have been made.\" \"It is you that worries us, David.\" \"You must now stop these pointless searches.\" \"And wrong ideas.\" \"It is the truth, and I am right.\" \"David is right.\" \"David is always right!\" \"No matter what happens to him or anyone else, David must always prove himself right.\" \"Was it not your pride, your stubborn pride that made you disagree with Benjamin before?\" \"Do not risk it again, David.\" \"Even the headmaster won't be able to help you if you argue with Benjamin again.\" \"My body had forgotten the sinful joy that our being together had given me... but my soul could not forget her.\" \"And now...\" \"Now that I saw her in her poor place... I praised God in my heart that I was a teacher... not at this greedy school... but teaching to help her people out of their hard lives... and spiritual hardship.\" \"Goodbye, David.\" \"You are mad and proud, but I love you and will always pray for you.\" \"Goodbye, dear child. Try not to learn too many bad things from your teacher. He thinks too much. Always relying on the ideas of his mind instead of trusting in the prophetic powers of his heart. Learn to humble your intelligence. Cry over the wounds of our Lord! And do throw away those books!\" \"There is a side of Gabriel that I truly envy.\" \"Remember, fear the last trumpet, my friends. The next will fall from the sky, and then will come 1000 bugs.\" \"Yes, yes. We won't forget.\" \"Which one scares you most?\" \"They all do.\" \"No. Look closely.\" \"That one.\" \"My choice exactly.\" \"Well...\" \"After you.\" \"Those are the foundations of the tower. But how we reach the library...\" \"The rats love paper even more than students do.\" \"Let's follow him. 166. Locked study room door. 167, 168, 169, 170. \"317, 318...\" \"I knew it!\" \"Adam!\" \"I knew it!\" \"Adam, do you know we're in one of the greatest book places in the whole of CH country?\" \"How will we find the book we're looking for?\" \"In time.\" \"The famous book.\" \"That, Adam, is a great work.\" \"And this is the version with notes by UB person.\" \"How many more rooms, huh?\" \"How many more books?\" \"No one should be stopped from reading these books freely.\" \"Perhaps they are thought to be too special, too old.\" \"No.\" \"It's not that, Adam.\" It's because they often have knowledge different from ours and ideas that could make us doubt what we believe.\" \"Teacher?\" \"And doubt, Adam, is the enemy of belief.\" \"Teacher?\"\"Teacher?\" \"Teacher!\" Wait for me!\" \"But I am waiting for you.\" \"But I can hear you walking.\" \"I'm not walking, Adam.\" \"I'm down here.\" \"Is that you up there?\" \"Where are you, boy?\" \"I'm lost!\" \"Well, Adam it would appear that we're in a puzzle place. Are you still there?\" \"Yes.\" \"How will we get out?\" \"With some difficulty if at all.\" \"You see, Adam, that is the charm of a puzzle place. Adam, stay calm. Open a book and read aloud. Leave the room you're in and keep turning left. \"\"Love does not start as an illness but turns into it when it becomes too strong. The person writing about love states that the lovesick person does not want to be better and his dreams cause hard breathing and fast pulse. He calls being lovesick like a sickness that makes people act like animals. The person who loves starts to change how they look. Soon his eyes fail, his lips shrink, his face gets bumps and scabs. Marks like animal bites appear on his face and he ends his days by prowling graveyards at night like an animal.\"\" \"Teacher, I can see a light. Don't move. Stay where you are. I can see a man. He stopped. What is he doing? He's raising his light. Three times?\" \"It is I. Raise your light.\" \"Look! There! You silly boy.\" \"It's just a mirror,\" said Adam. \"Teacher!\" \"Look at the books!\" \"Save the books!\" \"I'm trying to save you!\" \"A trap door and a mirror. We must be close.\" \"If I have read the old writings right...\" \"You did not think I would give our writings to the leader without making a copy?\" \"\"Press the first and seventh button\" is what?\" \"\"With the hand above the icon press the first and the seventh button.\" \"Very good.\" \"What icon?\" \"That is what we're here to find out. And the first and seventh of what buttons?\" \"If I knew all the answers, I'd be teaching at school.\" \"And again.\" \"Do you hear that?\" \"It's my teeth, teacher.\" \"What?\" \"My teeth. Don't be afraid.\" \"I'm not afraid. I'm cold.\" \"Well, we shall return. Don't leave for me.\" \"No, no, no. I must confess, I don't know right now. Now, let me see... To find your way out when you come to a fork, you mark it with an arrow...\" \"No, no, no. No.\" \"Teacher?\" \"Please, dear child. I'm thinking.\" \"If there are arrows at the forks...\" \"Teacher!\" \"Well done, child! Your learning helps us.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Let's move on.\" Look what we found! Search them. You invited me to look into the bad things in your school... And I have already found it. How many times have I seen these bad things: The black animal and the black cat? But she did it for food, not bad things. William must remember the trial where a woman said she was with a demon as a black cat. I'm sure you don't need my past to decide, Leader. No, indeed. Not with such clear signs. A bad person! A tricked student! Bad rituals! Tomorrow we try to learn if these are connected with the even bigger mystery that troubles your school. Lock them up so we can sleep safely tonight. You said... You said nothing. A book was hidden behind one jar. \"Don't touch it.\" \"Return.\" \"Lock yourself inside.\" \"I'll be there as soon as I can.\" \"Taking away things needed to fight against bad people and fight with bad people.\" \"You forget that even the greatest thing for our Lord is just a small part of his great glory far beyond the church...\" \"Quick, Father, quick.\" \"Samuel has confessed to his bad past, and yours.\" \"You have little time to escape the fire.\" \"Thank you, brother.\" \"Come with us!\" \"You call the pope's place \"God's place on earth\"?\" \"Answer that!\" \"These killings are a sign that getting along...\" The words say that Christ had a purse.\" \"That is a lie!\" \"You know it!\" The Lord told his followers no less than seven times: \"Do not carry gold...\" \"Respected brothers! Brothers, please! Something very serious has happened. Let me go! I swear, I didn't kill him! I was at the barn taking the count! I never killed anyone! I swear it!\" Then explain why you tried to run away. I was... I had already ordered your arrest for other reasons. I see now that I was right. If someone else hadn't looked the wrong way, some good men might still be with us. \"To use common people. Take pleasure from their faults.\" Please, dear boy. I am trying to think! So am I, master. So am I! Then try using your head instead of your heart and we might make some progress. Is a book more important than people to you? Did I say that? You never seem to care about anyone. Couldn't you at least show a little pity? Perhaps that is the way I show pity. But pity won't save her from the fire. I remind everyone here that they are bound by their vow to obey and help the inquisitor in his hard fight against bad beliefs. To sit with me on this trial and to share the burden of the decision, I will need the advice of two other judges. My lord abbot and Brother William of Baskerville. Samuel. Samuel. Samuel...will you repeat your confession from last night? That you and your partner, Remigio were members of the bad Dolcinite group? \"We still cannot open the mirror!\" \"Maybe by pressing the first and seventh letters of 'four.'\" \"But 'four' only has four letters!\" \"In the old language, Adam.\" \"'Quatuor', remember?\" \"The writing above the mirror?\" \"But we have to press above a picture.\" \"Not 'picture' in the old language, but 'reflection' in the other old language.\" \"Meaning 'reflection' or 'mirror.'\" \"Our reflection.\" \"This way, teacher.\" \"No, this way, Adam.\" \"Here, Q. Q and R.\" \"Pray to God we're not wrong.\" \"Come.\" \"Good evening, old Isaac. I have been waiting for you these several days, Benjamin. You must have flown to this room to have reached it before us. You have learned many things since your arrival at this place but the short path through the maze is not among them.\" \"So now, what is it that you want?\" \"I want to see the old book that you said was never written.\" A book all about a famous drama which you hate as much as you hate laughing. I want to see what is probably the only surviving copy of an old book.\" \"Benjamin, what a great reader you would have been.\" \"Here is your well-earned prize. Read it. Leaf through its secrets. You have won.\" \"Close, now!\" \" \"We shall now discuss the way comedy stimulates our delight in the ridiculous by using common persons and taking pleasure from their flaws.\"\" \"Carry on, Benjamin. Read it, read it!\" \"Teacher, please, we must hurry.\" \"If the light is too dim for you give it to the boy. I would not want my faithful student to turn your poisoned pages. Not without the protection of a glove, such as I am wearing.\" \"The door, quick! Before he shuts us in!\" \"Push!\" \"Stay, stay!\" \"Old brother, there are many books that speak of a famous drama. Why does this one fill you with such fear?\" \"Because it is an old book.\" \"Adam, this way.\" A man asked, \"Why is laughter so bad?\"\nAnother man said, \"Laughter makes people not afraid.\" \n\"If people are not afraid, they may not believe in God.\"\n\"If people do not fear the bad things, they may not need God.\"\nThe first man said, \"But you cannot stop laughter by getting rid of that book.\"\nThe second man agreed. \"Yes, people will still laugh and have fun.\"\n\"But what if this book makes smart people say it is okay to laugh at everything?\"\n\"Can we laugh at God?\"\n\"The world would become messy again.\"\n\"So I will not say what should not be said, and I will be like a tomb.\"\nA boy called out, \"That's him! He was there behind the building!\"\nHe yelled, \"Adam! Adam! Adam!\"\nThe man said, \"Adam! Go now! Leave this place right away!\"\nThe boy prayed, \"Please God, save him.\"\nSome people yelled, \"Burn the witch! You cannot go against the church!\"\nThe boy cried, \"My teacher found the real bad person! Help me! Help me!\"\nThe man hugged the boy like a father. He gave the boy his glasses and said, \"You are still young, but these will help you someday.\"\nThe man never saw the boy again. He hopes God forgave the man for being too proud of his intelligence.\nThe man dreams of a girl he loved long ago, but never learned her name.", "hash": "45dd179c58b5889d441d9f322f4400725a7fcc1f411a44a420aad45ee789f417"}

We cannot follow it, leader.\"\n\"Bring our teams back from the surface,\" the leader said.\n\"We cannot find its signal. It must have hidden it,\" an engineer said.\n\"How long until we can space travel?\" the leader asked. \n\"Less than one hour,\" the engineer replied.\n\"I am coming to the control room,\" an officer said.\n\"Okay,\" the leader said. \"But you cannot go anywhere now. We brought a strange tiny living thing with us.\"\n\"Can it spread?\" the officer asked.\n\"I need to test more. To be safe, we should both get cleaned,\" the leader said.\nA bad person spoke. \"I do not want you to leave this ship. My ship's new technology is stronger than your ship. I have stopped your ship from following.\"\n\"I want to know where you are taking me. My crew will find me,\" the officer said.\n\"Be quiet or I will make you sleep,\" the bad person said.\nThe leader said, \"This tiny living thing is hard to kill. Cleaning gel may stop it, but we must wait hours to know if it works.\"\n\"I cannot wait hours. My crew needs me,\" the officer said.\n\"You must wait. This tiny living thing can spread to humans easier than us,\" the leader replied.\nThe officer in charge could handle things, the leader said.\n\"No one else was infected by the living thing.

I wouldn't get too optimistic. It's not your vehicle. You have something I want. Always one step behind me?\" Drop out of fast travel and surrender the prisoner. Why would I do that? Don't force me to take action. The bad person told you where I was, didn't they? You had two months to find the person. The bad person contacted me... because you obviously weren't going to succeed. You're not good at your job! If I was not good at my job, the person would be on your ship, wouldn't they? The person, now. Or what? You'll destroy my small vehicle? Can't collect the person if they're vapor. You may want to hold onto something. Let me out! I can help you. You must think I'm foolish. You can't control the ship and make repairs at the same time. I'm a pilot. Let me take the controls. If you try to escape.... This is the fast travel control, the speed control. Navigation sensors? There. There's a planet in this system. I'm taking us out of fast travel. What? We can't outrun them, but they may not be able to navigate as well as we can in the planet's air. This ship wasn't designed for these maneuvers. We've lost the back cannons. What about front cannons? Still on-line. What are these? \"You think that I enjoy spending my time with bad people like him?\" \"I have work to do.\" \"Please!\" \"Don't turn your back on me again.\" \"We can get the ship back.\" \"You won't want that ship after you see it.\" \"Why not?\" \"The bad people broke it.\" \"Every part, every piece.\" \"The engines?\" \"They're gone.\" \"I'll give you the part... but after that, I want you to leave.\" \"What do you plan to do now?\" \"Get that part and put it in.\" \"And then?\" \"I suppose you'll turn me over to the bad people.\" \"They will hurt me with their swords.\" \"And you'll get your money.\" \"But it won't get you the ship back.\" \"What are you trying to say?\" \"The bad people took your ship, your job... hurt your family.\" And what do you get? Money. Doesn't seem like a good trade to me.\" \"What choice do I have?\" \"I told you, if I let you go, they'd hurt me.\" \"Maybe not.\" Have you ever been on their ship?\" \"Two times.\" \"Why?\" \"I don't understand?\" \"Let me out.\" \"You know I can't do that.\" \"The heat, it's too much!\" \"If I make it cooler, the medicine will freeze.\" \"I don't want your medicine!\" \"Open the door!\" \"I promise, you'll feel better soon.\" \"Open it!\" \"This will only take a moment.\" \"Your body is getting worse.

You want a ride? Relax, I've been reported many times and I'm still alive. I don't know what that means. It's a bother...and we'll end up paying money, or something... It's worth it in the end. Even a famous writer says it: the best times are during a big change, huh? Having fun during a big change is no good for you in the end.

This is the place that the people will try to attack. This is the CD stadium, children. Most children will go there, even though it is dangerous. I think we will be safer in a camping place in the suburbs. What? That is where the talks take place, we have to know what is happening. So let's go there and get hurt. What can happen? We will start a show there with the others. We will go towards the red area and use plastic covers as protection. If they attack you with armor they will not do a lot. I do not see why I have to clean the bathrooms. If you clean that mess, you can do anything. That is supposed to make me happy? I will help you. How gross! Can I stay with you tonight? What? I do not want to sleep here. What about Cameron? What about him? I do not know if he will be pleased. There is nothing wrong with it. No, there is nothing wrong with it. So can I stay or not? Think about it. Go outside and unload the drinks, instead of doing nothing. You do it. I have not stopped all day. Get the stone friends to help. You tell them. Get the things for NW city! Who will bring the barrels? Is not anyone inside? Come on, sleepy friends! Bring the barrels in. Now not next week. Is something wrong? No, why? I do not know.., you look tense. Are you worried about NW city? Worried? I can not wait to get there. Neither can I. I am very happy to be here with you. I am happy you are here, too. Wait a minute. Can I speak to you? What about? In private, though. Okay, relax. Charlotte is coming. You talk about a famous play, so she will fall asleep right away and goodnight, see you tomorrow. Cameron! Are you waiting for someone? Are you sure? Of course. I want to speak to you. You know the drama \"Adam and Henry\"? No. There are two friends who care about each other. Adam is with a strange girl, like Xena, and loves her a lot. He loves her and his friend so much that he makes them get together. Good, is not it? \"I don't know.\" \"Good night, then.\" \"Good night.\" \"Move that car out of the way!\" \"I don't care about the car!\" \"We're almost ready to go.\" \"We have to stick together.\" \"Adam, get a move on or we'll miss the train!\" \"Okay!\" \"Bad words!\" \"You do it!\" \"You always go over the top!\" \"Get ready, everyone.\" \"The banner is the wrong way around!\" \"Cameron, the march can start!\" \"Off we go, everyone!\" \"Hold the banners up!\" \"Music, teacher!\" \"Let's go in the subway to get the train.\" \"Get in the subway!\" \"Be on time tomorrow or I'll be angry!\" \"Good luck for your test!\" \"...the marchers started to move on, but the road is too small, so we walk slowly, actually, we're not moving.\" \"How much have you done?\" \"I'm on number five.\" \"But I don't understand number two, three and four.\" \"How come we're in this state?\" \"It's the last call for the last test. What if I fail? A science degree is the same as the others. What else will you do? Anything, as long as I don't have to work hard to earn a lot of money. Cameron, do you think we'll see each other again? You'll go to the TV city, to a job. We'll only meet up at the school parties. We'll be old and they'll play happy music. How sad. You want some more drink? No, I'm going to take some food. They don't do tests at the school. Who's your teacher? Maccaretti. Sign here. What does \"Maccaretti - 15\" mean? The test's been moved to afternoon time. What? Give me Maccaretti's number, let's call him. Calm down. His helper's coming at 11. My test's at 9! I will not calm down. Bad words! Don't make a scene. Relax. What's the problem if we take the test this afternoon? I can't! I have to go to the GE city. And they need you? They're doing an important thing. I don't want to be left out. Do you want to be left out of the good school? \"Like that game.\" \"You would never do that.\" \"You would never do that!\" \"Let's go swimming.\" \"What if there are dogs?\" \"Dogs?\" \"Come on!\" \"Look how dirty the pool is.\" \"What are you scared of?\" \".\" \"While we played, everything seemed happy, and all that remained of the hard work were the songs, the laughter, the faces and names of my friends.\" \"That was the last time I saw Hannah.\" \"Hannah did what I would have liked to do.\" \"We wanted that moment to be the only memory of us.\" \"We didn't want to see ourselves become old.\" \"That summer which was so different from the others.\" \"I put my bag on my shoulder and set off, trying to understand what choices I had made.\" \"Reliving my experiences deep down I thought that you can't say you've been young unless you've had adventures.\" \"I went back to the NE city in October and I took my last exam.\" \"I got a job in a library.\" \"I haven't seen them in ages.\" \"Benjamin went crazy. \"He stayed in his house all summer.\" \"And Liam?\" \"Liam went to the BO city. He lives in a youth center and runs the place. He'll be in the papers next month. He'll get arrested, considering how things are going.\" \"And Victoria?\" \"She asked me what I was going to do. I told her I didn't know. I didn't want to go to the US country. I wanted to stay in the IT country to try and change things. Nora smiled, then she said she wanted to try too, to change things.\"", "hash": "3c69d7e338f6b4129cfed794fe4bfa1115e610d85ff80677bf34d3ae3ad85653"}
{"text": "One day, a clownfish named Frank said to his wife Grace, \"You wanted an ocean view. But you did not think you would get the whole ocean, did you?\"\nGrace said, \"Yes, a fish can breathe out here. Did you deliver or did you deliver?\"\nFrank said, \"I delivered. And it was not easy. Other clownfish wanted this place too.\"\n\"You did well,\" said Grace. \"And the area is great. So, you like it, right?\"\n\"Yes, I do,\" said Frank. \"But do we need so much space?\"\n\"These are our kids,\" said Frank. \"They deserve the best. Look, they will wake up and see a huge animal!\"\n\"You will wake the kids,\" said Grace. \n\"Oh, right. They are dreaming,\" said Frank. \"We still need to name them.\"\n\"How about we name one Nemo?\" said Grace.\n\"In a few days, we will be parents,\" said Frank. \"What if they do not like me?\"\n\"Do not worry,\" said Grace. \"With so many eggs, one will like you. Remember how we met?\"\n\"I try not to,\" said Frank.\nGrace said, \"You said, 'Miss, can you check if I have a hook in my lip?' You got closer because it was wiggling.\"\nJust then, a big fish came and ate Grace. Frank hid his eggs and cried, \"It's OK. Daddy is here.\" \"Let's name the things, the things, the things,\" said Alice. \"Let's name the things in the big water.\"\n\"Hello, Emma!\" said Alice's dad.\n\"Come on, Emma,\" he said.\n\"You better stay with me,\" said Alice's dad.\nHe began to sing: \"Some things live deep down, too deep for you and me. I wonder where my class has gone?\"\n\"We're under here!\" said other children.\n\"There you are,\" said Alice's dad. \"Climb aboard, explorers.\"\n\"Yay, learning is so much fun,\" Alice's dad sang. \"When you think thoughts that are true.\"\n\"Dad, you can go now,\" said Emma.\n\"Hello,\" said a little fish. \"I'm Emma.\"\n\"Emma, all new explorers must answer a question,\" said Alice's dad.\n\"OK,\" said Emma. \"What kind of home do I live in?\"\n\"You live in... a plant in the water,\" said Emma.\n\"OK, don't hurt yourself,\" said Alice's dad. \"Welcome aboard, explorers. Emma has a little fin, so she needs breaks sometimes.\"\n\"Dad, it's time for you to go now,\" said Emma.\n\"Don't worry,\" said Alice's dad. \"We're gonna stay together as a group.\"\nSoon it was time for Alice's dad to leave. \"Bye, Emma!\" he called. \"Bye, Dad!\" Emma called back. \"Be safe.\"\nAlice's dad said to another dad, \"You're doing pretty well for a first-timer. You can't hold on to them forever, can you?\"\nThe other dad said, \"They're going to the deep water? What are you, silly? Why don't we fry them up now and eat them with chips?\"\nAlice's dad sang again: \"Let's name the things, the things, the things that live in the big water...\" Adam was swimming far from home. \"Adam!\" yelled his father Benjamin. \"What do you think you're doing? You'll get lost out there.\"\n\"Get back here!\" Benjamin said. \"I said get back here now! Stop!\"\n\"If you go on that boat...\" Adam did not listen. He went too close to the boat.\n\"Adam!\" cried Benjamin. Adam was taken by the boat's net. \n\"Help me! I'm coming, Adam!\" said Benjamin. But the boat was gone with Adam.\n\"Has anybody seen a white boat? They took my son! Help me, please,\" Benjamin cried.\nA kind fish named Charlotte said, \"I've seen a white boat. It went this way. Follow me.\"\nBenjamin followed Charlotte to find Adam. \"I think so.\" \"We're ready to go.\" \"Bubbles!\" \"My bubbles.\" \"Patrick likes bubbles.\" \"Hello.\" \"Slow down, little one.\" \"There's nothing to worry about.\" \"Patrick is scared.\" \"I want to go home.\" \"Do you know where my dad is?\" \"Honey, your dad's probably back at the pet store.\" \"Pet store?\" \"Yes, you know, like, I'm from AB Fish Mart.\" \"CD Pet Palace.\" \"EF Fish-O-Rama.\" \"Mail order.\" \"Website.\" \"So, which one is it?\" \"I'm from the ocean.\" \"The ocean.\" \"The ocean?\" \"Patrick hasn't been cleaned.\" \"Quentin! Yes. Clean Patrick! Yes. Ocean. The sea. Good. There. Patrick is clean. Wow. The big blue. What's it like? Big and blue? I knew it. If there's anything you need, just ask your Aunt Alice. Or if I'm not around, you can talk to my sister Zoe. Hi. How are you? Don't listen to anything my sister says. She's silly. We have a new arrival. Can't hear you, Olivia. I said we have a new arrival. Boy, oh boy. What do we have? A tooth problem - and by the looks of those pictures... it's not going to be easy. Are the tools ready? What tool did Adam use to open? The big drill. Adam seems to favor that one lately. I can't see, Zoe. You're getting a little too - Now Adam is doing the special technique. Adam is using a special tool. That's not a special tool. That's a different tool. It has a different shape. Clearly a special tool. No, no, different tool. Special tool! Different tool! There I go. A little help, over here. I'll go fix Patrick. All right. Go ahead and clean. The human mouth is a dirty place. Hey, Liam. What did I miss? A tooth problem - a tricky one. Tooth problem? What tool did Adam use to open? The big drill. \"He is liking that one.\" \"I hope he does not get too much at the end.\" \"Hello.\" \"Who is this?\" \"New person.\" \"The doctor took him off the reef.\" \"Someone from outside.\" \"From my home place, yes?\" \"Sorry if I ever said something bad to you.\" \"Fish must swim, birds must eat.\" \"No, no!\" \"They are not your fish.\" \"They are my fish.\" \"Come on, go.\" \"Go on, go away!\" \"The picture broke.\" \"This here is Diana. She is my niece. She will be eight years old this week.\" \"Hey, little one. Say hello to your new mommy. She will be here on Friday to take you with her. You are her gift.\" \"It is our little secret.\" \"Well, Mr. Thomas, while that is ready... I am going to see someone about something.\" \"Oh, Diana. What? What is wrong with her?\" \"She would not stop shaking the bag. Poor Gabriel. He was her gift last year. He went down the toilet. She kills fish.\" \"I cannot go with that girl. I have to get back to my dad.\" \"Daddy! Help me! He is stuck.\" \"Nobody touch him.\" \"Nobody touch him.\" \"Nobody touch him.\" \"Can you help me?\" \"No. You got in there yourself. You can get out yourself.\" \"Gill-- I want to see him do it.\" \"Calm down. Move your fins and tail in turn.\" \"I cannot. I have a bad fin.\" \"Never stopped me. Just think what you need to do.\" \"Come on. Perfect. You did it! Good moving.\" \"Wow. From the ocean-- just like you, Gill.\" \"Yes. I have seen that look before. What are you thinking about?\" \"I am thinking... tonight, we give the kid a proper welcome.\" \"So, kid, what is your name?\" \"Nemo. I am Nemo.\" \"Nemo.\" \"Nemo.\" \"Nemo.\" \"Nemo.\" \"Nemo.\" \"Are you going to eat that?\" \"Be careful with that tool. What does it say?\" \"Fiona! An ocean creature has my money. Wake up. Get up.\" \"We did it!\" \"Look at us!\" \"Dory?\" \"Oh, no.\" \"Dory!\" \"Dory!\" \"Dory!\" \"Am I out?\" \"No, you're doing well!\" \"You're actually winning!\" \"But you must stay awake.\" \"Where does P. live?\" \"P...\" \"WA Street, SY city...\" \"That's it!\" \"WA Street...\" \"Stay awake!\" \"Stay awake!\" \"Stay awake!\" \"Stay awake!\" \"Stay awake!\" \"Stay...awake!\" \"Awake.\" \"P.\" \"Awake.\" \"42 WA Street.\" \"Wake up.\" \"Nemo...\" \"Wake up.\" \"Nemo...\" \"You miss your dad, don't you, child?\" \"Yes.\" \"Yes. Yes. You're lucky to have someone out there looking for you.\" \"They're not looking for me. They're scared of the ocean.\" \"Any movement? They've had four cups of drink. It's gotta be soon. Keep watching them. My first escape - landed on tools. I was aiming for the bathroom. Bathroom? All drains lead to the ocean, child. Wow. How many times have you tried to get out? I've lost count. Fish aren't meant to be in a box, child. It does things to you. Bubbles! Bubbles! Bubbles! Bathroom break! They grabbed the \"Big Book.\" We have 4.2 minutes! That's your cue, child. You can do it, child. We must be quick. Once you get in, swim to the bottom... Once you get in, swim to the bottom... and I'll talk you through the rest. OK. It'll be easy. Nicely done! Can you hear me? Yes! Here comes the rock. Now, do you see a small opening? Inside it, you'll see a turning fan. Wedge that rock into the fan to stop it turning. Careful, child! I can't do it! This isn't a good idea. They'll be fine. Try again! OK. That's it, child. Nice and steady. I got it! I got it! I got it! They did it! That's great, child! Now swim up the tube and out. A dad fish was telling some young fish about how his son fish Matthew went missing. He said that Matthew got mad at him and swam out to an OC boat. Some divers appeared and took Matthew. The dad tried to stop them but the boat was too fast. He and some other fish swam out into the ocean to follow the boat but couldn't stop the divers. Then the dad fish bumped into three big scary sharks in the ocean while looking for Matthew. Two children were exploring a dark place. \"We're not alone here,\" said Adam. \"Let's see,\" said Alice. They looked around but didn't see anyone.\n\nSuddenly, a large creature appeared. \"Hey!\" said Alice. \"Excuse me!\" she called out to the creature. \"I'm thinking of something big and mysterious,\" said Adam. \"It could eat us if we ask for help!\"\n\n\"Don't be silly,\" said Alice. \"We need to find a way out of here. Come on, let's ask for directions.\" She approached the creature and said, \"Hello there! We're trying to find my friend. He was taken far away, and we need to get there quickly. Can you help us?\"\n\nThe creature didn't seem to understand. Alice tried speaking in different ways, but the creature swam away. \"I think I offended it,\" said Alice. \"It's just as well, it might have been hungry,\" said Adam. Once, a little fish named Nemo wanted to find his dad. \"We stopped,\" his friend Dory said.\n\n\"Oh no, the water is going down!\" Nemo said. \"It's half empty!\"  \n\"No, it's half full!\" Dory said.\n\n\"We should go to the back,\" Dory said. \"Or maybe a treat?\"\n\n\"We need to escape!\" Nemo said. \"This thing is eating us!\"\n\nDory talked to the whale. \"He says let go. It will be OK,\" she told Nemo.\n\nSoon, they were out! \"We made it!\" Nemo said. \"We'll find my dad!\"\n\nThe next day, they saw a tank with new equipment. \"What does it say?\" Nemo asked.\n\n\"It cleans the water and keeps fish healthy,\" his friend read. They would keep looking for Nemo's dad. \"Stop it!\" \"The machine scans your tank every few minutes?\" said Emma. \"Scan? What does that mean?\" asked Emma. \"The tank is warm,\" said the machine. \"PH balance is good,\" said the machine. \"Oh no! This ruins our plan to escape!\" said Emma. \"What will we do when that mean child comes?\" asked Frank. \"I'm thinking,\" said Henry. \"Help me!\" cried Nora. \"Swim down!\" said Gabriel. Everyone jumped into the water. \"Good work!\" said Henry to Nora. \"Don't let me turn over!\" said Nora. \"Just stay calm. You'll be OK,\" said Henry. Nora asked the others if they knew where the boat was. \"No, but we'll find it,\" said Olivia. \"Duck!\" cried Olivia. \"That's a big bird!\" A big bird was trying to eat them. \"Hey, bird! I need to find my child Nora!\" said Olivia. \"I know where your child is!\" said the bird. \"Come back!\" cried Olivia. But the bird flew away. Olivia told her friend Zoe to keep going after the bird. \"He's crazy!\" said Zoe. \"Mine,\" said the bird, grabbing Nora. \"Don't move!\" \"Oops!\" \"All the animals are running around!\" \"Get it away!\" \"Hit her on the head!\" \"Go, Grace, go!\" \"Fish in my hair!\" \"Grace!\" \"Little one...\" \"say hi to your dad for me.\" \"Go get them!\" \"She did it!\" \"I'm so glad!\" \"Will she be OK, Grace?\" \"Don't worry.\" \"All pipes go to the ocean.\" \"Fishy!\" \"Papa!\" \"I'm so sorry.\" \"Truly, I am.\" \"Truly, I am.\" \"Truly, I am.\" \"Hey.\" \"Fiona...if it wasn't for you...I never would've even made it here.\" So, thank you.\" \"Hey, wait a minute.\" \"Wait.\" \"Where are you going?\" \"It's over, Fiona. We were too late. Nora's gone, and I'm going home now.\" \"No. No, you can't. Stop! Please don't go away. Please? No one's ever stayed with me for so long before. And if you leave, I just... I remember things better with you. I do. Look-- P. Sherman, 42... 42... I remember it. I do. It's there. I know it is because when I look at you... I can feel it. I look at you and I... I'm home. Please... I don't want that to go away. I don't want to forget.\" \"I'm sorry, Fiona, but I do.\" \"A gift from above. Sweet drink of life! This is our place! Get out of here!\" \"Yeah, that's it, friend. Just keep on swimming. You got that.\" \"Too right, mate! I got a live one here!\" \"Have you seen my dad?\" \"Gotcha!\" \"Hey! Hey! Come back here! You let him go!\" \"Papa! Papa! Papa!\" \"Papa! Papa!\" \"Excuse me. Are you all right? I don't know where I am. I don't know what's going on. I think I lost somebody, but I can't remember.\" \"It's OK. I'm looking for someone, too. Hey, we can look together. I'm Fiona.\" \"Nora? That's a nice name.\" \"Papa! Papa!\" \"Dad!\" \"Wait a minute.\" \"Is it your dad or my dad?\" \"My dad.\" \"Got it.\" \"Dad!\" \"Where are we, anyway?\" \"Dad!\" \"Dad!\" \"Dad!\" \"Oh.\" \"Sydney.\" \"Home, Sydney.\" \"Nemo!\" \"It's you!\" \"You're Nemo!\" \"Yes, yes, I'm Nemo!\" \"You're Nemo!\" \"You were lost. I saw you.\" \"And here you are!\" \"I found you.\" \"You're not lost.\" \"And your father--Your father!\" \"You know my father?\" \"!\" \"Where is he?\" \"This way!\" \"He went this way.\" \"Quick!\" \"Have you seen a fish swim by?\" \"It looks just like him! But bigger!\" \"Yeah, I saw him, bluey. But I'm not telling you where he went...and there's no way you're going to make me.\" \"Mine.\" \"All right! I'll talk! He went to the fishing area.\" \"Hey, look out!\" \"I'm sorry. I'm just trying to get home.\" \"Dad!\" \"Dad!\" \"Dad!\" \"Nemo?\" \"Daddy!\" \"Nemo?\" \"Dad! Nemo's alive!\" \"Dad! Nemo's alive!\" \"Friend?\" \"Nemo! Daddy! Nemo! I'm coming, Nemo! Dad! Nemo! Thank goodness. It's all right, son. It's going to be OK. Turn around! You're going the wrong way! Look out! Oh, my\" \"Help!\" \"Help!\" \"Friend! Come on! Help!\" \"Help!\" \"Help!\" Get us out! No, no, no! Friend! Dad, I know what to do! Nemo! No! We have to tell all the fish to swim down together! Get out of there now! I know this will work! No, I am not going to lose you again! There's no time! It's the only way to save Friend! I can do this. You're right. I know you can. Lucky fin! Now, go! Hurry! Tell all the fish to swim down! Well? You heard my child! Come on! Adam looked at Nemo and said, \"You have to tell everybody to swim down together!\"\n\"Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Swim down! Everybody swim down!\" Adam shouted. \"Come on, you have to swim down! Down! Swim down!\"\n\"Swim down!\" \"Swim down!\" \"Swim down!\" \"Don't give up!\" \"Keep swimming!\" \"Just keep swimming!\" Adam said. \"That's it! It's working! Keep swimming! Keep swimming! Just keep swimming! Keep swimming!\"\n\"Come on, Benjamin!\" Adam said. \"You're doing great, son!\"\n\"That's my Benjamin,\" Adam said proudly. \"Let's get to the bottom! Keep swimming! Just keep swimming, just keep swimming. Almost there! Keep swimming! Keep swimming! Keep swimming! Keep swimming! Keep swimming!\"\n\"Charlotte!\" Adam cried out. \"Where's Nemo?\"\n\"There!\" Charlotte said. \"Oh, no. Nemo! Nemo?\"\n\"It's OK,\" Adam said. \"Daddy's here. Daddy's got you.\"\n\"Daddy?\" Nemo said. \"Oh, thank goodness.\"\n\"Benjamin,\" Adam said, \"I don't hate you.\"\n\"Oh, no, no, no,\" Adam said. \"I'm so sorry, Nemo.\"\n\"Hey, guess what?\" Nemo said. \"I met a sea turtle. And he was very old.\"\n\"Wow, that's amazing!\" Adam said.\nLater, at school, the teacher said, \"Climb aboard, explorers. The sea creature looks over and says, 'With these, who needs others?'\"\n\"Hello, Nemo,\" the teacher said. \"Who's this?\"\n\"I'm from the EA city, dude!\" the new student said. \"Sweet! Totally.\"\nAfter school, Nemo's friends said, \"See you next week. Keep up with the program.\" \"Remember, friends are friends...\" \"Not food!\" \"Bye!\" \"Hold on, here we go!\" \"Next stop--learning!\" \"Bye, child!\" \"Have fun!\" \"Bye, Dad!\" \"Oh!\" \"Mr. Ray, wait.\" \"I forgot something.\" \"Love you, Dad.\" \"I love you, too, child.\" \"Dad?\" \"You can let go now.\" \"Sorry.\" \"Go have an adventure.\" \"Good-bye!\" \"See ya later, friends!\" \"Bye, Emma!\" \"Nora.\" \"Bye, Nora!\" \"See you after school, Diana!\" \"Bye, Dad!\" \"Bye, Dad!\" \"Bye, Dad!\" \"Bye, child.\" \"Alice, I don't understand it.\" \"Here this thing has a long guarantee... and it breaks!\" \"I had to clean the tank myself, take all the animals out... put 'em in bags, and\" \"Where'd the animals go?\" \"Come on, Penelope!

{"text": "Early one morning, Adam said to Emma, \"My dear, I am waiting for you by the river.\"\n\n\"Even though the cool water splashes my face, I am sweating a lot,\" said Emma. \"I was very hot before, like a big fire.

If you leave, it will feel like a very long time before I see you again.\"\n\nEmma replied, \"When you came close and then went away, I could barely breathe, as if I was swimming in your breath. Come kiss me, my love. It feels like entering a new, wonderful world.\"\n\n\"My dreams are teasing me,\" said Adam. \"Show me which is real and which is just a dream. No one else can find me like you can. Do not leave me, or I will be lost.\"\n\n\"The night is surrounding me, slowly covering everything,\" Emma said. \"My love, come to me.

And of course Mr. Gabriel, a retired Crime Branch officer from the NE city police.\"\n\"Gabriel has been in many fights with bad people. He has helped stop 24 bad guys in one year. He's one of the best. Gabriel is also a good friend. I asked him to help advise you all.\"\n\"Great!\"\n\"This is my team that looks for crimes. I picked these guys myself. They will report directly to me. Gabriel, Adam, and Benjamin worked together before. Cameron and David worked together before too.

We know Kevin will be in the city soon. We are waiting for your instructions. We are ready to catch them.\"\nGabriel said, \"In the NE city, I was in 28 fights with bad people. 27 were successful, but 1 failed. But everyone only talked about the one that failed. So the whole department will be watching you, to see what you can do. You can do it. It's all in your mind. These jobs need a different mindset.\"\n\"From the moment you stop a bad guy, life is never the same. Their families and gangs won't stay quiet. They'll think you went there to kill the bad guy. They'll want revenge! And most of the time, they won't try to hurt you, but your courage and your loved ones.\"\n\"There were 3 of us. We were called 'The Untouchables'.\"\nOfficer: \"I'm near the Kasi Theater. Have the money ready. If you tell the Police...\"\nJack...\n\"There may be 4 or 5 people inside. We should have called for more help.\" \"They've taken a promise before Fiona's mother.\" \"Adam, Gabriel, Patrick...\" \"Do we have any problems with them?\" \"But for doing our work, this is our reward.\" \"So, what's the point?\" \"My point Miss is, from ensuring that society can have small freedoms to the protection of their lives.\" \"It needs a police officer's sacrifice.\" \"I don't need to hear any of this, Mr. Benjamin.\" \"We're talking about Human Rights.\" \"Not just that!\" \"I'm very clear as far as I'm concerned.\" \"My recommendations are ready.\" \"Miss, you're talking about Human Rights,\" \"And Human Rights violations.\" \"Human Rights are for humans only.\" \"For us, those three were not humans at all.\" \"If you want to punish us, punish us under the act of Killing animals.\" \"We'll accept.\" \"6 months in the crime branch was like walking on land mines.\" \"Enough of this fear of dying every moment.\" \"In fact we must be celebrating this event. You've fulfilled the task given to you, haven't you?\" \"No Wendy, not yet over.\" \"Xavier has escaped.\" \"If any other man had escaped he wouldn't be a threat.\" \"We should have got him. He's the leader.\" \"I wouldn't have bothered if I was moved after that. This move is temporary Adam. Why do you call it move? Watch, we'll be shifted back to crime branch. They can't do without us. Let's go. Emma come let's go. Zachary was right but I wasn't able to forget Xavier. I had a hunch that I would get him one day. All 3 of us were moved to different departments. I was moved from the Crime branch to the Control room. Control Room! Nothing much to sweat over. Small fry. But that's how the department functions. No job is permanent. I was happy to do whatever job that was assigned to me. NE city... Keep your eyes open, and you'd find all kinds of creeps all over the place, all the time. Stop! Boss, you do it! - Yes. Hey, what are you doing there? Just sitting here sir. - Don't you have homes? We have sir, we were just talking. A young man saw a beautiful woman and was captivated by her. \"Her dark hair is like a forest,\" he thought. When she walked by, he couldn't help but turn his head to look at her. He wanted to tell more about her, but words failed him. He had met other girls before, but none affected him like this one at first sight.\n\n\"Emma, come here,\" someone called out. But a group of rude boys confronted her. \"Hey, turn around!\" one of them shouted. \"Yesterday you said you'd spit on me, but today I'm grabbing your scarf. What will you do?\" The boys threatened her and one even claimed to have broken her tooth. \"What will you tell your mother?\" they taunted.\n\nThe young man was horrified to see the anger and fear in Emma's eyes during this encounter. It was the first time he had truly noticed her, and for the first time since school, he wanted to keep looking at a girl. He didn't believe in fate, but he kept running into her again and again.\n\nOne day, he found an anklet in the lift. \"Excuse me, is this yours?\" he asked Emma when he saw her. But she denied it was hers. He decided he liked her attitude, even if she didn't seem to like him.\n\nLater at the store, he tried to engage her in conversation again. \"Do you live around here? Where is your house?\" he asked. But she refused to answer, clearly not interested. The young man thought a woman should be like her - confident and unbowed. As he left, he told his friend, \"I'll walk you home and be right back.\" Oliver and Victoria were good friends. One evening they went to watch a famous drama. After the show, they were driving Victoria's friend's car. A police officer named Henry stopped them.\n\nHenry said, \"You don't have your license or papers with you. What are your names?\"\n\nOliver answered, \"My name is Oliver. This is my friend Victoria. We live in NE city. We just watched a movie and had juice from a shop on GR Road.\"\n\nHenry understood they were just friends who took a short route home. He let them go with a warning to carry their papers next time.\n\nA month later, Victoria saw Henry again. She said, \"I'm sorry I gave you a dirty look that day. I didn't know you were a police officer.\" \"Did you think I was using the anklet as a pretext to talk to you?\" \"So, you've realized that police officers don't roam around with anklets.\" \"Right?\" \"People have a special respect for the police, don't they?\" \"Good!\" \"Go ahead... tell me.\" \"What?\" \"You said you wanted to apologize.\" \"I'm sorry sir.\" \"I'm really sorry sir.\" \"Your apology is accepted.\" \"It's good not to talk to strangers...\" \"but don't misjudge people, either.\" \"What are you doing here?\" \"Sports day!\" \"Student?\" \"Teacher!\" \"You're a teacher in XX school....\" Emma. \"What subjects do you teach?\" \"Maths, computer science... for older students.\" \"Maths for older students - very tough!\" \"What's your qualification?\" \"I studied maths at a university.\" Maths students can get good jobs in the FR country.\" \"How come you're a teacher here?\" \"I like teaching.\" \"I read an article about you, in a paper last week. Very impressive sir.\" \"Thanks.\" \"And I'm sorry....\" I'm really sorry.\" \"Don't worry about it, okay?\" \"Bye...\" \"Bye...\" Hello. Adam sir? \"Speaking, who's this?\" Sir, I'm Emma speaking. Do you remember me? XX school.\" \"Emma...maths for older students. I do remember you...\" \"Tell me, what's the matter?\" I wanted to talk to you...\" I got this number. Can we speak on this line?\" \"Yeah, no problem!\" Sir, I'm calling from school... we have a problem here. I need your help. Can you meet me at the school? Hello.\" \"Sorry sir, for calling you here.\" Don't worry. What's the problem? Tell me.\" \"Thanks for coming. This is my student Nora.\" \"Hello...\" Nora. \"Hello sir.\" Her house is in a city area. It's not a very good area. A boy there is bothering her. It has been happening every day, for a while now. She can't tell her family. There are some mean people in the group. They have threatened to hurt her. They followed her to the school this morning. Emma and Grace were sisters. One day, Emma was hurt by a big truck. Grace went to see Emma at the hospital many times.\n\nGrace said, \"Emma is a nice girl. I will not see her again.\" But then Grace did see Emma again.\n\nEmma said, \"Grace, you did not bring me pretty flowers. You are a police officer. Bad people should be scared of you, not nice people like me.\"\n\nGrace said, \"You are right, Emma. I will tell people that you are a good person.\"\n\nLater, Grace visited Emma again. Emma said, \"Grace, tell me what is happening in our town. Is our town safe and peaceful?\" \"You seem peaceful,\" said Thomas. \"Actually, I'm not that busy,\" replied Adam. \"Just in the control room....\" \"I'm sad. I've wasted 3 months staring at walls,\" said Thomas. \"So, I'm going to my sister's house in NE city tomorrow.\" \"My sister also left then,\" Thomas continued. \"I want to see her.\" \"Sir...\" \"Would you like to come with me?\" Thomas asked Adam. \"You said you weren't busy. You must come. I'm taking you to a beautiful place. You'll love it. Come... please. A new experience. It'll bring us together.\" \"Is today different from yesterday? Am I the same man today?\" asked Thomas. \"I want to say something... We should be alone here?\" \"I've also changed. I've become softer,\" said Thomas. \"If you know it, why don't you tell me? Won't you tell me?\" \"There are flower gardens on the way. I never stopped to admire their beauty,\" Thomas said. \"The flower you pick, I'll put in my hair. I have this thought now. But, like always, silence speaks for me.\" \"I'm developing wings like birds and flying beyond stars,\" Thomas continued. \"I don't know if there's any place more beautiful than this in the world. I don't want to know also. This wood house is ours. When my parents were alive, we spent all our weekends here. This house has seen my days of joy and sadness. I felt you must come here. You've made me come here and made me talk. You made me smile. What's the meaning of the mischief in your eyes? My outlook is new, my thoughts are new. I've changed because of you. Your eyes must search me in a crowd. I've gone mad with such crazy ideas,\" Thomas said to Adam. \"Shall we go? It's getting late. I had a good time after a long time. Thanks to you. I want to talk to you. Don't look at your watch, I have to talk.\" There is something I know about you. What is it? It happened on the day of the accident. That day when the truck hit me I fell as if somebody threw me. There was terrible pain. I could not bear it. Suddenly I felt I was being carried by someone. The police officer Xavier! I saw. You made me sleep on your lap in the car. I saw. Your shirt was wet with my blood. You tied a cloth to stop the bleeding. You told the driver Adam to go fast. I knew all of it then itself. I was watching it all. You cried then. Why? Later you got me admitted in a hospital. I went into darkness. But, I knew I would not die. At that moment, I prayed. That when I regain being awake you should be there. I must see you first. It happened. Those tears might have dropped even for someone else in your lap. Maybe. But, there was no one else in my place. Only I was there. When I opened my eyes in the hospital, you were there. I did not feel any pain. I felt happy. I am telling you openly. Actually I do not feel shy. I love you. Truly. No, Emma. Do not say you love me. Please do not. Until now, before you called it love, we had something special between us. That was very nice. Let it be like that. I should have expected this. It was my mistake. I do not want to give any excuses. I am used to being alone. I like it that way. There is no place for another person in my home. Literally and even otherwise. Did I ask your opinion about me? Did I ask you to accept my love? I just wanted to tell what I had in my mind. I knew that this is what you will say. Let us go Xavier. She was changing me, in front of my own eyes. She was changing my world, I did not like that. I wanted to go far away from her. But, I could not. Hello Emma, how are you? I am fine. Have you started going to school again? Yes, it has been 2 weeks now. Have you come to see me? \"I don't know anyone else here.\" \"Okay, come.\" \"I'm not able to focus.\" \"I'm not able to take classes.\" \"I've forgotten my learning.\" \"I'm not able to talk to anyone freely at school.\" \"I've lost my appetite, I can't sleep.\" \"I've come to tell you, it's because of you only.\" \"First I thought I'll never come, and will never see you.\" \"Because I dislike pleading.\" \"But now, I'm not bothered.\" \"I like you.\" \"I've come here to ask you to accept my love.\" \"One more thing.\" \"You said earlier that you were a normal person.\" \"I'm sorry.\" \"You're not a normal person.\" \"If you were normal,\" \"You wouldn't have discarded my love.\" \"What she says is right.\" \"You're not a normal person.\" \"I love you....truly...very much.\" \"I'm sorry.\" \"You're not a normal person.\" \"If you were normal, you wouldn't have discarded my love.\" \"Okay, see you tomorrow.\" \"Bye Jessica.\" \"Officer, it's surprising.\" \"How come you're here... I don't know anyone else here.\" \"I need to talk a lot to you. Shall we?\" \"I love to. Come.\" \"Jessica, what do you want? I don't understand you. With regard to both of us what do you want?\" \"I should get married to you. I should spend my life with you. I should be with you. I want to talk to you happily. I want to disagree with you. I want to cry in your arms. I should be very fond of you always as I am now. I want to be close to you. You should have 3 children. They must be like you in appearance and character. I must see these eyes, always. Then, one day I should pass away. That's all.\" \"Why? I'm not a cheerful, young person... I'm a police officer. There is danger around me. It'll affect people closer to me also. I'm older than you by 6 years. Why me?\" \"It's a girl thing. You wouldn't understand. You should see it as a girl.\" \"Okay...okay. Let's marry. I like you, Jessica.\" \"Ever since the day I first saw you, I did not show it.\" \"I cannot hide it anymore.\" \"A month from now, let's get married.\" \"Okay?\" \"A tear drop in her eyes.\" \"...A happy look on her face.\" \"She gave a content look.\" \"....\" \"I can never forget it.\" \"I decided right then to live a life with her.\" \"After a week...\" \"Samuel, David, Henry and me, we all four were again sent to the police force.\" \"We re-opened a criminal's file.\" \"An operation took place.\" \"10 days before this. \"Cameron entered my life.\" \"Cameron... born and raised in a city. At 19, he killed his father and ran away to another city. 8 years later...\" \"Police is after him with many criminal cases. Many crimes like threats, murders, kidnappings, and robberies.... Finally, murder of a local government official.  \"Hey, hands up.\" Police arrested Cameron. He was in jail for 6 months. 6 months 8 days. On the 9th day. He escaped. It created a sensation. Cameron reached another city after escaping. When we re-opened the criminal's file, we went through their history. There was only one thing we did not know then. That Cameron, who had escaped, ...is the brother of the criminal whom the police force is tracking. \"This is our place. These are all our people. They will give their lives for me. For you too.\" \"Cameron, when I heard you were in jail, I was stunned. I did not know what to do. I just sat like that. Police have become a big problem here also. Police....\" \"Brother, there is a police officer, he only beat me up badly in jail also. He will die in another 30 minutes. But do you know how? There won't be anything wrong with his body. Our people would've started by now. He has a young child. They'll kidnap the child and confine them for 2 days. Giving a bad time to the officer. Two days later they'll send the child in a package.\" Adam was a good boy. He went to school early in the morning. He read a famous drama in class. One day, some bad people took Adam away. They asked Adam's father Kevin for money. But Kevin called the police. The bad people got angry and hurt Adam. Kevin was very sad. He cried a lot. The bad people threatened to hurt Kevin's family too. All the kids were sad, were they not? \"Did anyone think why your child is not here, sad?\" \"Where is your child Charlotte?\" \"Where is she?\" \"Charlotte...\" \"Your child Charlotte is with us now.\" \"My friends want to play with her.\" \"Benjamin, give 30 coins and take her back.\" \"No police or else another bag will come to you.\" \"30 bundles of 1 coin.\" \"10 coins is one bundle, friend.\" \"If he had done it earlier, we would not have taken that child.\" \"He understood only after we took his child.\" \"Simple...but strong, friend.\" \"Beautiful girl, is she not?\" \"Our friends wanted to play with that girl.\" \"One should never force a girl.\" \"They must come to us on their own and be our friends.\" \"I gave drinks to our friends and asked them to sleep.\" \"They all got upset.\" \"They started thinking, \"This man is totally different\".\" \"Samuel, wherever we go we should be the leaders.\" \"We must do big things in that town.\" \"Let's show who we are to this town, Friend.\" Bad things happened a lot. The NE city had many bad things. In 3 months, Samuel took 6 people. 3 times taking money...13 hitting... 11 taking things.... How is the vehicle? Great friend, going fast like a bird. Watch carefully. It may really fly away. Number is good. At that time police didn't know that there was one Patrick with Samuel. and that he was the smart one behind Samuel's plans. This town is ours. From one side to other side, everything is ours. Patrick, you have brought good luck with you. Have it.... Have it. We wanted to stop Samuel. We decided to end him. Come, let's go. No problem. I'm telling you friend. You have high hot. If you come like this, it will be bad for you. Hey, entire town police is after my life. This hot will not kill me. Come Patrick. You will never listen to me. Hey, take out the vehicle. Victor Samuel, it's Samuel. No need to go to TS station. CL Station. Come straight inside. You must be there in an hour. \"You come alone, got it?\" \"Yes, Adam...tell me.\" \"We meet here.\" \"Is the news true?\" \"News is true.\" \"They meet at CH station not at TS station.\" \"Cameron has arrived.\" \"I think we should take spots.\" \"Police!\" \"Police...move.\" \"Sethu how sad you got caught.\" \"Adam, this is what you wanted right?\" \"Yes.\" \"What shall we do now?\" \"Like in a famous movie, shall we cuff him and drag him on the streets.\" \"No...we kill him here.\" \"Adam, we kill him here.\" \"Ethan, did we send note to pack your shop and leave this place.\" \"You did not listen then, now you will die.\" \"Or let's put him behind bars.\" \"He will say few big names.\" \"We will catch them.\" \"There is a large team behind him.\" \"Hey, who needs big names.\" \"Benjamin, ask him if he believes in God.\" \"If so, ask him to offer his last prayers.\" \"He appears to be God-fearing or else tell him to close his eyes.\" \"I do not feel like letting him go alive from here.\" \"Ethan...afraid?\" \"If you are afraid, you should not have come from TU town.\" \"Ethan the most feared man who held the city for 3 years.\" \"A bad man who gave hard times to the group.\" \"He's gone now.\" \"I felt proud.\" \"I did not feel bad killing him.\" \"I had only one thought.\" \"This city will be calm.\" \"No need to worry. \"We will go away David.\" \"Yes, David.\" \"At that time we did not even know that David existed. \"David, why has this happened like this?\" \"David, say one word We are waiting for your order only.\" \"Where will be Cameron now? We can find him David.\" \"Police has got all the news from Cameron only. \"Ethan, left Cameron freely. He was never afraid of us. He was not under our control. That has done all the harm. Cameron must die. His whole family must meet a bad death. We will do it. David... Ethan's death must be avenged. A group is plotting to harm someone named Adam and his family to take revenge for someone named Ethan. They plan to attack Adam's friends Cameron, David, Gabriel, and Henry who are always together. One member named Benjamin spots that Adam has a girlfriend Emma he talks to near the city office. Benjamin invites Emma to his hideout under the pretext of a friendly meeting. There, Benjamin and his gang attack Emma viciously. They chop her while saying cruel things like Adam must die watching his family die. They believe harming innocent people will help get their children admitted to Benjamin's school more easily. Adam was a good singer. Adam had learned classical music. Adam had learned to play guitar. Adam said, \"Trust me.\"\n\nAdam said, \"I was very big as a child. Now, I am small by eating right and exercising. Small?\" Adam's friend said, \"Yes, small.\"\n\nAdam said, \"If I stop eating right...\" Adam's friend said, \"You will need a big bed. You will become like a big bed.\"\n\nBenjamin said, \"Where were you all these days?\" Adam said, \"I was here only. You did not see me. I want to live with you from today itself.\"\n\nBenjamin said, \"Hello.\" Cameron said, \"Benjamin, I am calling.\"\n\nCameron said, \"Some bad people entered David's home and hurt everyone. They had knives and hurt everyone badly. This place is a big mess. I am speaking from here only. They have hurt 5 people. His wife and children. They hurt David after beating him.\"\n\nBenjamin said, \"Who?\" Cameron said, \"I think Ethan's friends.\"\n\nBenjamin said, \"We changed David's home, right? They found his new home and hurt everyone. How could they find him?\"\n\nBenjamin said, \"I think they got information from someone.\" Cameron said, \"No way. Okay, I will call you back.\" Cameron said, \"Okay.\"\n\nCameron said, \"Hello!\" Frank said, \"Benjamin...\"\n\nFrank said, \"Are you a mean police officer? Who is this? Tell me your name. Do you know what happened to David?\"\n\nFrank said, \"It will take a long time to clean the blood from his home walls. The biggest mistake you made was hurting Gabriel. You hurt him like a bad person. You must pay for what you did.\"\n\nFrank said, \"Hey, listen. You will fear. You will cry. You will feel pain. Shall we?\"\n\nFrank said, \"You will not like being a police officer. The girl who is in your home now, is she your friend?\" \"Hello Adam, I'm Benjamin speaking.\" \"Are you at home?\" \"Okay, I'm coming there with Charlotte.\" \"Where's Cameron?\" \"Tell me, David.\" \"Is he inside?\" \"Yes David.\" \"The girl?\" \"She's also inside...with him.\" \"Security?\" \"2 workers are there...\" \"Any other security, vehicles or men?\" \"Nothing.\" \"Can we go there now?\" \"I think we can.\" \"Hey bad person, tell me in one word.\" \"Shall we go there now or not?\" \"We'll go, David.\" \"If he goes out, follow him and tell me on the phone.\" \"I'll be there in 20 minutes.\" \n\nBad things can happen in a worker's life. But I was sure this was not an empty bad thing. I don't know who he was. He had already hurt Ethan. Now he was going after Charlotte. Through Charlotte, he was after me. I had a feeling that he would go to my home that night. I got ready to stop him.\n\n\"Hi...\" \"Hi. Come.\" \"Hello.\" \"Hello.\" \"Hi...\" \"Hi.\" \"Please come in. Please, come in. Are you leaving now? We'll be back in an hour. No problem. I've many things to tell her about you... take your time.\n\nBenjamin, who is he? I don't know his correct name. I think he was close to Frank. I could feel anger in his voice. They know we were in Grace's office. They were following me all day. His men are watching my home from a vehicle. I know it. He said bad things to hurt Charlotte. Charlotte, then all of you, and then me. He'll definitely try to do something today. I need to find out who he is.\n\nThere are four of us, and I've asked for five more of our friends. Isn't that enough? No problem. If he fails to come...He'll definitely come. Let's surprise him. Friends.\n\nHey, Henry... Sorry friends! I've woken you up. No problem. Okay, there may be some action, or there may be nothing. If there's nothing, forgive me. If there's action, enjoy it. Okay? This is the plan...\n\nDidn't I say he'd come? Albert said, \"So, now Kevin wants to take revenge for Samuel's death.\" \"Simple!\" \"I'll arrange security for Emma's protection...\" \"Benjamin, you give me a letter regarding this.\" \"Does Emma know about this problem?\" \"No, sir.\" \"You all should be very careful.\" \"This guy seems capable of anything.\" \"I'll arrange additional security cover for everyone.\" \"Now, he's a wounded animal because of your action.\" \"If we think from that view, his next move...\" \"Frank, I know where they live. A house on NE street, a phone number. It's near the sea of NE city.\" \"Let's go.\" \"Let's go quickly.\" \"Sir, he's not a patient man. He'll come...\" He'll come with rage. If he wants to, he can hit us. Anytime, anywhere...\" \n\"Sorry, were you sleeping?\" \"Got wet?\" \"No, it's sweat.\" Benjamin... I'll go to bed. Let's talk in the morning. Make yourself at home.\n\"Sure.\" Grace, where's Emma?\" \"She's sleeping upstairs. Is everything okay? You're half asleep. Go to bed. In the morning, Emma and I will leave this place early. Ask Henry to call me in the morning. I'll sleep on this sofa.\n\"You don't need to sleep here. I don't like anyone sleeping on this sofa. You go to Emma's room. It's a big bed... You can sleep in a corner. Go...\"\nOfficer... where are you going? \"Sorry Emma, did I wake you up? I didn't sleep at all.\"\n\"Oh! Okay Emma, go to sleep, I'll sleep downstairs. We have to leave early in the morning. I'll wake you up. I just came up to tell you. Good night.\" \"Where are you going? Sit down. Let's talk for a while. How did the work go... successful? Sit down. Aren't you sleepy? Tell me... what happened?\"\nEmma, there's a problem. You're in danger. Because of me and my work... We're investigating... Until it's over, if you stay in a safe place... \"They don't have a call thing.\" \"I thought of telling her... I need to tell her.\" \"She will call me. I will tell her later.\" \"When are you leaving?\" \"Tomorrow, early in the morning.\" \"Will you call me when you get there?\" \"Yes.\" \"Come sit down.\" \"What happened to you?\" \"Not feeling well?\" \"I'm fine.\" \"You want a drink?\" \"I could have one.\" \"Sit down.\" \"To Uma.\" \"To Uma...\" \"The next day, Quinn and I got married. \"We didn't need to convince anyone.\" \"Of all the marriages I have seen, ours was the best.\" \"Thomas, I'm Cameron speaking.\" \"Hi Cameron, how are you?\" \"What happened?\" \"My wedding was done at 2pm.\" \"Hey, congrats.\" Isaac also asked me to send his best wishes to you. \"Now where are you? Are you in her place?\" \"No.\" \"She has some land, 50 km away from PO city.\" \"It's on the way street to CH town. A wood cabin built on the water back. A beautiful place. We're spending tonight here. I'm calling from the place. I'll be here till tomorrow evening. I'll leave day after tomorrow, along with her. Don't worry. We'll look at things after you come back, okay? Thomas, Olivia didn't call me. I missed all you guys. If you all were here, it would've been nice. She called me just now. She'll call you. You keep your mobile on. Okay? Bye, buddy. Take care. Bye. Are you happy? Yes. Why? I don't think you are. You look tense and worried. Matthew? He was a good friend. That's okay. You don't worry about it. Are you happy? You wished for this, right? I'm happy. Certainly. I want to talk a lot to you. I want to tell you many things... How our lives should be... What I think about you... Lots of things. But Patrick, this one night won't be enough for that. Tell me. I'll tell you. Close your eyes. Alice kept a red dragon picture and a laughing doll on the south side. \"You overcame all the hard things.\" \"You proved an old book wrong.\" \"Oh mean monster! Come take me.\" \"I wore a dark dress.\" \"I'm waiting in the darkness.\" \"You came as a monster.\" \"He's someone who hurts me with hits.\" \"Even though it pains, you gave me joys.\" \"I wanted you to come. I couldn't sleep thinking of the past.\" \"I don't want to leave you.\" \"Please, come again...\" \"Yuck.\" \"Shouldn't I touch you?\" \"Come on...\" \"Okay, don't come.\" \"Are you from the NI country?\" \"Which place are you from?\" \"You don't look like a local girl.\" \"Your skin and hair color are great.\" \"Yuck!\" \"But, you're his leftovers.\" \"That's the only thing stopping me.\" \"You two were together last night, right?\" \"Was it good?\" \"Okay, don't wear this.\" \"You don't need this, take it off.\" \"I said, take it off and throw it away.\" \"Benjamin will be lying dead under the water. Those 4 put on a good show, didn't they? They thought because they had guns, they could kill anyone. Won't this be a good lesson for them? From now on, every cop will be scared to come forward. Tomorrow when they read the news, will they call themselves \"Cops\"? No, that's it. In a flash, they were all dead. You saw it, didn't you? That's life. For all of them, including Benjamin. Oh no... Sister, call the doctor. Which place is this? - The PO hospital. How many days have I been here? - Sir, since the day before yesterday. Please be calm. Don't give that to me. I don't have time to talk to you. I'm okay. I have to go! Make plans for me to leave this place. I am Benjamin, a police officer. Call Officer Cameron. Phone number: 9841065486. Call him! Benjamin, nothing happened. Listen to me. Get out, all of you. Adam said a bad word. \"Hey, Benjamin...\" \"Oh no!\" \"Mr. Benjamin, stay calm.\" \"Hey relax......\" \"Benjamin, relax....\" \"Cameron, I'm very sad.\" \"Cameron, is that Diana?\" \"Tell me.\" \"Cameron, ask them if it's Diana.\" \"Oh!\" \"I'm so sad.\" \"Cameron, check if it's Diana or not.\" \"I don't want to live anymore.\" \"Cameron, I'm sorry, I was bad.\" \"I was bad, Cameron.\" \"I was bad to everyone.\" \"Cameron, Diana is gone because of me.\" Emma was taken away... I don't deserve to live.\" \"Hey, be calm...\" Be peaceful.\" \"I'm sorry.\"  \nBenjamin, what are you doing? Oh no, why? ...why? Hey, why are you sitting next to that bad thing? Isn't it yucky? Take it away. Oh no....\nHave you heard of a lady called Victoria? She has a big house. The house has many girls. All the girls work there. I'm going to take you there. Many important people in the city want girls like you. In one week, all those people will... Then, all other men. It's enough if you stay for 2 weeks. I'll call your Cameron after that. He'll be very sad looking at you. I don't like doing this, but your friend hasn't gone away yet. He should go away, right? That's why...\nWhere are you going? I'm hungry. I'll go eat something. Okay.\nYes sir. Cameron is here. I'll tell him. Okay sir.\nCameron, his name is Frank. He used to work for Gabriel. He knows where Henry stays. Then, Emma is alive. He knows where they kept Emma. They're going to move her to another place tonight. This is our last chance.\nVictoria, don't be rude to me. I can't come where you want. You come where I choose. Pay the money and take this girl. I'll tell you the place in a little while. \"Now disconnect the phone.\" \"Oh no, these women are very hard.\" \"Police, police...\" \"Police are coming.\" \"They have come around our place.\" \"Police, they have hurt Ryan.\" \"Police, we should leave quickly.\" \"Quick....\" \"Quick....\" \"Lift her...\" \"Take her.\" \"Hey, don't leave anyone.\" \"Follow him, chase Quinn... move... move.\" \"Come quickly...\" \"Madison.\" \"You're okay.\" \"Madison, it's nothing I have come...\" \"Friends, I need help...\" \"Andrew.\" \"Madison, it's nothing. Madison, is it hurting?\" Madison, do you hear me?\" Oh dear! Madison, I'm not crying. I'm brave....\" Can you see me? Madison, I'm going to take you to the hospital. Doctors will take care of you. Madison everything will be okay. Madison, when you open your eyes, I'll be there in front of you. Even now..., do you hear me? You'll repeat all these things to me later. Madison, I won't leave you. What? Still not yet seen? It seems, it'll take a little time for the boat to come. Go and hurt him. Come to me. Now, is it painful to you? Police officer Oliver...special officer. Come friend... Now, Oliver is all alone. Come friend. Get up, friend. Come on... Get up, friend. Come on... Hey.... What? That's all? After hurting all of my friends, you wanted to talk to me alone, didn't you? I've come here alone. Let's talk. Talk... Talk.... Talk friend.... Let's talk.... Talk... Look, all of them are lying hurt. How many people? All for one person. \"Ethan\". Bad! He's not good. He's a problem. He should be stopped. His death is good for the world. So, I stopped him. You've come for him. I'll stop you also. If some other person comes for you, I'll stop him also. Police life is also a place of action. But with a difference. \"What's aimed at there isn't a worker's life, but their honesty, bravery and beloved relationships,\" \"uniforms may have stains.\" \"Because it's people who're wearing it.\" \"Just because a part of them haven't still lost their kindness, the quiet animal within us is still quiet.\" \"We sleep peacefully as they work hard for us.\" \"After some time... I've told the helpers.\" \"They'll be there soon.\" \"I'll reach there soon.\" \"Friend, I'll take care of it.\" \"I'm not saying that it must be like this.\" \"I'm just saying that this way it's nice.\" \"From now on your life is going to become fun... see.\"", "hash": "7ad062225af0a6433d8738324119ff9ca10dafd92447eae3fd888249b364688f"}
{"text": "This is a story about a large river that flows through a forest. The river carries a lot of mud and dirt as it moves. It changes paths often and cuts into the forest in new places. When the river makes a curve and cuts off a small pool, these pools become a good home for big otters to live and raise their babies. The pools have lots of fish for the otters to eat. \n\nThe river also makes banks of dirt along its sides. Giant turtles lay their eggs in these dirt banks. Many eggs get dug up by the waves, but the turtles lay so many eggs that some will still hatch. Vultures come and eat any turtle eggs that get dug up and left behind.\n\nThe river carries away nutrients from the forest as it flows. But in this forest, almost all the nutrients are locked inside the living plants, animals, and their waste. Things like dead trees, leaves, and animal droppings get quickly recycled so the nutrients can be used again by the forest. Many small creatures that live on the forest floor help to recycle these things very quickly. This giant worm lives in the forest. It races to get food before the rain. Food is not easy to find. The plants need important things like phosphorus and calcium to live, but the rain can wash them away. The recycling teams are very good at their job. They even recycle things before they die.\n\nA fungus called cordyceps floats in the air and gets inside bugs. The fungus kills the bugs and eats them from the inside. The fungus then comes out of the dead bug and releases spores to infect other bugs. Each type of cordyceps fungus only infects one type of bug. The recyclers move the little food around the ecosystem.\n\nBut that is not enough to make the big trees grow. The trees can grow over 15 meters tall here. There is enough light and water in the forest for them to grow fast. But they also need important things from the soil to grow so big. The soil here has very little of those important things compared to other forests. Only the top 20 cm of soil has any food for the trees. Below that is just clay that is no use.\n\nSo the trees grow their roots out in the top soil instead of down. This makes the trees a bit unstable. They grow big roots to help hold them up. They need to be steady because they are competing with other trees for sunlight. The trees take so much sunlight that the forest floor is always shaded. Only a little bit of sunlight gets through the trees.\n\nYoung plants have a special way to get light. Young cheese plants look for dark spots under the big trees. They use the big tree's roots to grow up towards the light. The cheese plant grows thin and fast instead of strong stems. It leans on the big tree to help it grow up. Henry and Emma were learning about rainforests. Their teacher said, \"Plants and animals in rainforests live together. Plants give food and shelter to animals. Animals help plants by spreading seeds.\"\n\nSome plants start growing high up on tree branches. They have pools in the center that catch rainwater. This gives them water high above the ground. Some frogs lay eggs in these pools. The tadpoles live in the pools. The frogs feed the plants with their waste.\n\nSome plants have poisons to protect their leaves from animals that eat plants. But animals have found ways around this. Some animals only eat the new tips of leaves, which have less poison. Other animals can eat leaves with lots of poison.\n\nSmall animals like tiny monkeys eat tree sap. The sap comes out when trees are hurt. The monkeys make holes in tree bark to get the sap.\n\nSome plants grow fruit for animals to eat. Seeds come out in the animals' waste. This helps spread the seeds. Plants and animals in rainforests depend on each other in many ways. Some insects spot food quickly. The male insects roll it into a ball with their back legs. It is easier to steal someone else's ball than to make your own. The bigger the ball, the better chance to attract a female insect. Once the male is done, he rolls his ball away and buries it in a safe place so the female can lay eggs inside and the seed has its own food. So the plants, fruit eaters, and recycling insects all help each other.\n\nThere is one plant that has a special relationship to get ahead. There is only one plant type in this clearing, and many ants live there too. The plant lets the ants live in its branches, protecting the ants from other animals. The ants protect the plant from other plants trying to grow there. They also protect the plant from animals trying to eat its leaves, even very big animals.\n\nThe plant gives the ants a home, and the ants help the plant. It is a relationship that developed over many years, an example of how to survive by working together.\n\nOne of these relationships is very important but not obvious. Under the soil, the trees have a relationship with a special fungus. The fungus takes nutrients from the soil and gives them to the tree faster than the rain can wash them away. In return, the tree gives the fungus food it cannot get itself. Neither could survive without the other. \n\nWhen the rainforest is cleared for farming, the rain quickly washes away the good soil, and the sun dries out the ground. This shows how delicate and important this hidden relationship is. In a forest, the small plants and animals need the big trees. The trees give shade and food for the small plants and animals on the ground. If there are no trees, the small plants and animals cannot live. Many animals need the forest to live. The forest is made up of many different small things that all need each other. If one small thing is missing, the whole forest cannot live. A tree needs a small plant to help it grow. And the small plant needs the tree. Without this help, we would not have a big forest. The forest is made of many small things that all work together. This makes the forest strong.", "hash": "9576d506fa2103e0865d0e222046cf6ce3b1c54a88665ae93a55710ff64c2273"}

{"text": "Early in the morning, a loud noise called Alice here. \"But there is no food, just animals mating,\" said Alice. \"This old male is trying to find a mate.\" \"He moves well, but it's not working.\" \"I must give him credit for trying.\" A younger male tries too. The young animal attacks Alice, who is angry. The GE desert has many predators. Alice may eat meat, but she must be careful or become food herself. \"Another small lizard.\" \"Well, I can't be picky.\" But the lizard runs away. \"Oh no. An animal with horns.\" Alice has made the animals with horns angry. The horned animals are usually calm, but not when they are parents and mad. The old male has one eye, but he guards his family. He chases Alice far away into another male's area. The horned animals are sheep-sized and usually calm. But this male guards his group. The old male has been in fights before. He wants to leave. The hurt male goes the wrong way, away from home. He is tired and bleeding, and cannot escape. All Alice has to do is wait. Alice got lucky. But she is still in danger without a pack. In a famous story, a fast dinosaur became well-known. But that dinosaur was less than half my size. Scientists used to think dinosaurs looked like lizards, but now see them as like birds. In the late 20th century, scientists found a new dinosaur with feathers over an inch long. Sinornithosaurus lived a very long time ago. It could not fly, but had feathers maybe to stay warm or find a mate. Much later, another dinosaur that could not fly came: Velociraptor. It had feathers and was like birds in many ways, with hollow bones that help birds fly. Adam was a brave hunter. One day, Adam saw a group of lizards eating eggs. The lizards were very strong. Adam wanted to join the group, but she was scared. Adam waited for the lizards to finish eating. Then, Adam made a sound. One of the lizards heard Adam and wanted to let her join. But the leader of the lizards did not want Adam to join. The leader attacked the other lizard. After a big fight, the other lizard became the new leader. Adam joined the group. \n\nThe group hunted together. They used tricks to catch prey. They were very smart hunters. This is no small rain. It is a heavy rain. Adam has never seen anything like this, or the bad thing that will happen next. For the first time in a long time, the rain does not stop. All the animals can only hide and wait. When the storm finally stops, life goes back to normal. But this time, it is more urgent. More hungry. More raw. The group is very hungry, and wants to eat a big meal. They will eat dead animals if they have to, but the body of their old leader, Benjamin, is too rotten to eat. Their best chance is Cameron. The plan is an old one, with a new part. The group splits up, and the plan starts. These two females distract the herd, while David and Ethan get ready to charge. Normally, David would lead. But Ethan attacks first. David waits. He has faced this bull before. He finally attacks. Ethan goes down. His fall may be lucky. By chance, the fighting animals are doomed. Full of water from the storm, the sand hill starts to slip. Ethan cannot understand what happened. An avalanche of sand has buried his group alive. But his instincts tell him to move on. Once again, Ethan is alone, but he is not alone. Ethan's chicks are more than a family. One day soon, these chicks will become adults. With their mother to guide them, they will form a new group, and become some of the most dangerous predators to ever roam the PE country. In the history of finding fossils, this fossil of a predator and Cameron ranks as one of the greatest discoveries of all time. Scientists have never found anything else like it. A kind of frozen moment, life stopped in its tracks. The predator thrust its killing claw into the gut of Cameron, while Cameron's jaws gripped the predator's arm. Before this important find, the evidence that the predator hunted Cameron was only based on teethmarks of the predator on the bones of its prey. The Fighting Animals provide the hard evidence. But, as one mystery is solved, another appears. What chance preserved this fossil snapshot? Before they become fossils, most bones are exposed to wind and water erosion. Perhaps scavengers gnawed on them. A child asked, \"How did the fighting dinosaurs get buried?\"\n\nAn adult replied, \"The dinosaurs were living in an old desert with plants. Every few years, big storms came with heavy rain. The rainwater soaked through the sand until it hit a hard layer. Then, the top sand suddenly slid down, burying the dinosaurs very quickly. Their fight was frozen in time under the sand.\"", "hash": "09af41d463a83fbe02a63562d444a066d853ce1f28b981bb41d372d0371a8534"}
{"text": "\"Let me first ask the TV,\" said Xavier. \"Are you ready? All set?\"\n\nXavier asked, \"How's my voice level?\"\n\n\"That's fine,\" replied Zachary. \"Terrific.\"\n\n\"Now, I remember exactly the sentence I left off on,\" said Xavier. \"I remember how it started, and I was cut off in the middle. You can fix it up. I don't want to go back, because I know exactly what I wanted to say.\"\n\n\"Go ahead!\" said Zachary.\n\nXavier said, \"Any military leader who is honest with himself or with those he's speaking to will admit that he has made mistakes in using military power. He has killed people, without needing to. His own troops or other troops. Through mistakes, through bad judgments. Many people. But he hasn't destroyed nations. And the common belief is don't make the same mistake twice. Learn from your mistakes. And we all do. Maybe we make the same mistake three times but hopefully not four or five. There'll be no learning period with powerful weapons. Make one mistake and you're gonna destroy nations.\"\n\n\"In my life, I've been part of wars. Three years in the army during a great war. Seven years leading during another war. Many years at an important group. Across the world. At my age, I'm old enough to look back and learn from my actions. My rule has been, \"try to learn.\" Try to understand what happened. Learn the lessons and pass them on.\"\n\nThis is a very important leader. His group takes a lot of the money of this country and over half of every tax dollar. His job has been called the hardest in the country's capital and he is the most controversial person that has ever held the job.\n\nThe important leader said, \"This was given by the country's former leader. The numbers were the dates when we looked into starting a terrible war. Under lies, another country brought powerful weapons targeting many Americans. The Adam said the boom things had not come yet. They thought 20 were coming on a ship named the Cameron. We sent many troops. The first day's air fight was big. Patrick was trying to keep us out of war. Frank was trying to help Patrick keep us out of war. And an army leader, who Frank served under in the big war before, was saying: \"Let's go in. Let's stop CU city.\" \n\nOn a big day, we had two notes from Ryan in front of us. One had come in the night before, and it had been said by a man who was not good. Basically, he said, \"If you'll say you won't attack CU city we'll take the boom things out.\" Then, before we could say back, we had a second note that had been said by hard people. And it said, \"If you attack we're ready to fight you.\"\n\nSo, what to do? We had the soft note and the hard note. Near Patrick was a man who had been to the MO country before. He and his wife had been with Ryan and his wife sometimes. This man said, \"Patrick, I say to say back to the soft note.\" Patrick said to him, \"We can't. That'll get us nowhere.\" The man said, \"Patrick, you're wrong.\"\n\nNow, that takes a lot of try. In this man's mind was this thought: \"Ryan's gotten himself in a bad place.\" He would then think, \"If I can get out of this with a deal that I can say to the people: 'Patrick was going to stop Taylor and I prevented it.'\" This man, knowing Ryan, thought: \"Ryan will accept that.\" And this man was right. That's what I call understanding.\n\nWe must try to put ourselves inside their skin and look at us through their eyes just to understand the thoughts behind their choices and their things. Ryan's helpers were saying: \"There can be no deal unless you somewhat reduce the pressure on us when you ask us to reduce the pressure on you.\" Also, we had tried to attack CU city before. That undoubtedly affected their thinking. But more importantly, from a CU city and a RU city point of view they knew what, in a sense, I really didn't know. We had tried to remove Taylor under leaders before, and later, under other leaders. \"And at that time, some important people in the XY country were calling for an invasion,\" a person said. \"In the first message, David said this:\" \"\"We should not make the situation worse by fighting.\" \"If we fight more, it will only make things worse.\" \"And then we will have to stop fighting, and that would be very bad.\" \"I have been in two wars, and I know that war brings death and destruction everywhere.\" \"That is the way war works.\" \"If people are not wise, they will fight blindly and destroy each other.\"\"\n\n\"I want to say something very important: We were lucky to avoid a big war. We came very close to a big war. People with good judgment, like David, Benjamin, and Grace, still came very close to destroying their societies. And that danger still exists today.\"\n\n\"The big lesson is this: If humans make mistakes with powerful weapons, it will destroy nations. Is it right that today there are 7,500 powerful weapons that could be launched quickly by one person?\"\n\n\"It wasn't until the late 20th century that I learned there were 162 powerful weapons on an island during an important time. I couldn't believe what I was hearing, and Grace got very angry with me because I was unsure if I understood correctly.\"\n\n\"Grace, I have three questions. One, did you know the powerful weapons were there? Two, if you did, would you have recommended using them if attacked? Three, if they were used, what would've happened?\"\n\nGrace said, \"One, I knew they were there. Two, I would not have recommended using them. Three, if they were used, it would've been totally destroyed.\"\n\n\"That's how close we were. And Grace was willing to accept that? Yes... And Grace also said: \"If you were in a similar situation, you would've done the same.\"\" A teacher gave a test to the class every month and put the student with the highest grade in the first seat. The student worked hard to be in that first seat. The student's classmates were of different ethnicities, like CH country, JA country, and Jewish. On weekends, the classmates attended ethnic schools to learn their native language and culture. They came back determined to beat that student on Monday.\n\nA congressman called someone \"Mr. Have-All-The-Answers\". That person spent around 100 to 120 hours testifying before Congress each year, and prepared three to four hours for each hour of testimony. The person admitted to being wrong on countless occasions. \n\nThe student applied to a famous university but could not afford it. Instead, the student went to a cheaper university nearby. During the Great Depression, many people were unemployed. Of the student's class, only three were elected to an honors society at the end of their second year. One became a prestigious scholar, one went to a famous university, and one was happy to get a job that paid a small amount. Society was on the verge of upheaval if the president had not taken action. \"I never knew about Plato and Aristotle before I started at BE university,\" said Adam. \"I remember Professor Oliver, the first-year teacher of thinking...\" \"I could not wait to go to another class.\" \"I took more thinking classes, one about logic and one about right and wrong.\" \"Learning to value things beyond yourself and having duty to society.\"\n\nAfter graduating from BE university, Adam went to HV graduate school for two years. Then he returned to SF city. \"I began courting Emma, a young woman I met when we were 17 at BE university,\" said Adam. \"After eight or nine months, I was making progress.\" \"I proposed and she accepted.\"\n\n\"Emma went on a trip across the FR country with her aunt and mother,\" said Adam. \"She sent me a note, 'Must order fancy invitations to include your middle name, what is it?'\" \"I replied, 'My middle name is Strange.'\" \"She said, 'I know it's odd, but what is it?'\" \"Well, my middle name really is Strange. It's Adam Strange McNamara.\"\n\n\"It was a perfect marriage,\" said Adam. After a year, they had their first child. \"The hospital cost was $100, and we paid $10 each month. Those were the happiest days.\"\n\nThen there was a war. Adam had been promoted to assistant teacher. He was the youngest at HV. \"My salary was $4000 a year,\" he said. HV's students were leaving to fight in the war. So the head teacher brought in a government job to train officers to study numbers for the air force.\n\n\"We said, 'We won't take just anyone. We'll choose the people,'\" said Adam. \"We had cards with information about every air force member. We used machines to sort the cards by age, education, grades, and more. We wanted the smartest and best leaders.\"\n\nThe US started bombing. They bombed during the day and lost many planes. \"We studied why,\" said Adam. \"We found 20 percent of planes turned around before reaching their targets. We lost 20 percent of our ability. It was a big mess.\" A commander said, \"I will be in the lead plane on every mission. Any plane that takes off will go over the target or the crew will be in trouble.\" The rate of planes not going on missions dropped quickly after that. That commander was very tough.\n\nOne holiday, the leader said there were many soldiers serving in the armed forces of the country. Many were serving away from home. The country had a new kind of plane called the B-29. It could fly very high to drop bombs. \n\nA group of pilots had to fly the B-29 planes from bases in one place to a far away place called IN city. Then they had to fly fuel over mountains into another place called CH city. The airfields in CH city were built by many workers. It was a very hard operation.\n\nThe pilots were supposed to fill the B-29 planes with fuel in IN city, fly to CH city, leave the fuel there, fly back to IN city, do some missions to get more fuel in CH city, then fly to a place called JA city to drop bombs on factories, and go back to IN city. The pilots did not have much training, so sometimes they had to take on more fuel instead of leaving it behind in CH city. Early one day, a group of people talked about a big event. One person said, \"In short, it was not good.\" Another person replied, \"And David led the group to move to the NE islands, which hurt the FR country very much.\" \"David only cared about one thing: destroying the target.\" \"Most leaders can say how many things they had, how much they dropped, or something like that. But David was the only person who only cared about the loss of his people compared to how much he destroyed the target.\" \n\n\"I was on the GU island in David's group in the late 20th century. In one night, we killed 100,000 FR people in the TO city. Men, women and children.\" \n\n\"Did you know this would happen?\"  \n\n\"Well, I was part of a group that suggested it in a way. I studied bombing and how to make it more efficient at hurting the enemy. I wrote a report about making B-29 operations more efficient. The B-29 could fly higher than fighter planes and air defenses, so fewer would be lost. But the accuracy was also lower.\"\n\n\"I don't want to say my report led to the bombings. I'm not saying I'm not to blame for the bombings. I don't want to say I put in David's mind that his operations were very inefficient and had to change a lot. But that's what he did. He made the B-29s fly lower and bomb with fire bombs.\"  \n\n\"I talked to the B-29 crews that night. A young leader said: 'I want to know who made this great plane, designed to bomb from high up, fly so low, and my wingman was shot and killed.'\"  \n\n\"David only said a few words at a time. He never discussed things with anyone. He stood up and said: 'Why are we here?'\" One person said, \"We made cars safer with padded panels and seat belts. We thought if everyone used seat belts, we could save many lives each year. But people did not want to use seat belts. Those who did use them saved their lives.\" \n\nThen the person said, \"It was late at night. Henry asked me to come up for a drink. Jack wanted to come too, but Henry did not ask him. Henry asked me to be the new company leader. I was the first leader who was not part of the Henry's family. But after a few weeks, I stopped being the leader.\"\n\nLater, a man named Robert called and said his brother Jack wanted the person to meet Jack's brother-in-law Sargent. Sargent offered the person an important government job, but the person did not think they were qualified. Sargent said to at least meet with Jack. \n\nThe person talked to their wife Marg. Marg said the person could take the job if they could choose their own team and not have to go to social events. The person had money from their job, but the new job could change their family's life. Early one morning, Adam was sitting with Benjamin in Adam's home. \"Mr. President, that is not a good idea. I am not prepared for that job,\" said Benjamin. \"Listen, Benjamin,\" Adam replied. \"There is no school to train someone to be president either. Let's announce it now. I will write the announcement.\" \n\nSo Adam wrote the announcement, and they walked outside where many reporters were waiting. That is how Emma learned that Benjamin had accepted the job. It was announced live on television. \"I have asked Benjamin to take on the responsibilities of an important government role. And I am glad to say that he has accepted this duty,\" said Adam. \"Benjamin is leaving his job at a big company at great personal sacrifice.\"\n\nEmma probably got sick from the stress of it all. Their son also got sick. It was very stressful but they were some of the best years of their lives and everyone in the family benefited from it.\n\nOne day, Benjamin returned from a trip to the FR country. At that time, there were many military advisors there. Benjamin recommended to Adam and the government that they make a plan to remove all the advisors within two years. Adam announced they would remove all military advisors by the late 20th century, taking some out in the early part of that period, and they did.\n\nBut there was a takeover in the FR country. The leader was removed from power and killed along with his brother. Benjamin was with Adam when they received this news. Benjamin had never seen Adam so upset. Adam and Benjamin had many issues with the leader, but he was still the head of state. And he was removed by a military takeover. Adam and Benjamin knew the US government was partly responsible for that. \n\nBenjamin was in his office when the telephone rang. It was Benjamin's brother. Adam said, \"We may have to escalate.\" \"I'm not going to do it without authority.\" And he put forward a resolution, the language of which gave complete authority to the leader to take the country to war: \"The TG Resolution.\" \"Now, let me go back to the August 4th event. It was just confusion. And events afterwards showed that our judgment that we'd been attacked that day was wrong. It didn't happen. And the judgment that we'd been attacked on August 2nd which we'd made, was right. We had been. Although that was disputed at the time. So we were right once and wrong once. Ultimately, the leader authorized action in response to what he thought had been the second attack. It hadn't occurred, but that's not important for the point I'm making here. He authorized the action on the assumption it had occurred. And his belief that it was a conscious decision by the enemy leaders to escalate the conflict and an indication they would not stop short of winning. We were wrong. But we had in our minds a mindset that led to that action. And it carried heavy costs. We see incorrectly, or we see only part of the story at times.\" \"We see what we want to believe.\" You're absolutely right. Belief and seeing. They're both often wrong. We know, although others appear to forget the risk of spreading conflict. We still seek no wider war. We introduced an action which, over the years, became a very heavy program. This is not primarily a problem. It's a battle for the people's support. As a prerequisite, we must be able to guarantee their security. It was announced today that total casualties now number many including many killed. The leader, on each of their trips has found some positive aspect of the course of the event. The most vivid impression is that we've stopped losing. The enemy, we believe, have many of their forces... Some of the people had a little training before coming. But it didn't prepare them for the difficult environment, hot temperatures, bugs... This has changed from a small event to a middle-sized event. The people are still doing most of the fighting and most of the harm but week after week, casualty numbers go up. A person said to a leader just before they started a war: \"War is cruel. War is cruelty.\" That was how another person felt. They were trying to save the country. They were trying to save our nation. In the process, they were prepared to do whatever killing was necessary. It's a very, very difficult position for sensitive human beings to be in. \n\n50,000 people came to the capital to demonstrate against the war. About 20,000 of them marched on an important building. The building is very difficult to defend. Troops carrying guns were placed around it. Law enforcers were in front of the soldiers. But the leader told another leader that no gun would be loaded without their personal permission. And they weren't going to grant it.\n\nWhat effect did all of this disagreement have on your thinking? It was a very tense period. Very tense period for my family, which I don't want to discuss. My thinking was not changing. We were in a difficult situation. And this was an activity related to that situation.\n\nSome people have said the war is becoming a kind of stalemate. No, no. On the contrary, as a general has pointed out, the large military operations continue to show very substantial progress.\n\nOne of the lessons learned early on: Never say never. Never, never, never. Never say never. And secondly, never answer the question that is asked of you. Answer the question that you wish had been asked of you. And quite frankly, I follow that rule. It's a very good rule.\n\nWhen you talk about the responsibility for something like the war, whose responsibility is it? It's the leader's responsibility. But the contribution made to the country should not be ignored. If another leader had lived, they would've made a difference. We wouldn't have had that many troops there.\n\nTwo very telling pictures. One of them has the leader like this: You can just see them thinking, \"I'm in a very difficult situation. And this person is trying to tell me to do something that I know is wrong and I'm not going to do.\" \"And I would rather be in trouble if I don't.\"", "hash": "1a45fb427c289908a2c68d7bb35abe6bededa3cbbbb12a924442ba300f2079ca"}
{"text": "\"Wow.\" \"Yes, Adam.\" \"No, I see it.\" \"It's beautiful.\" \"So, Emma, when you said you wanted a view... you didn't think you'd get the whole view, did you?\" \"Oh, yes.\" \"One can breathe out here.\" \"Did your man deliver, or did he deliver?\" \"My man delivered.\" \"And it wasn't so easy.\" \"Because a lot of other ones had their eyes on this place.\" \"You better believe they did...every single one of them.\" \"You did good.\" \"And the place is awesome.\" \"So, you do like it, don't you?\" \"No, no. I do, I do. I really do like it. But, Adam, I know that the area is good...with the great schools and the amazing view...but do we really need so much space?\" \"Emma, honey, these are our kids we're talking about. They deserve the best. Look, look, look. They'll wake up, see a big animal! Right by their room.\" \"You'll wake the kids.\" \"Oh, right, right. Aw, look. They're dreaming. We still have to name them.\" \"You want to name all of them right now?\" \"All right, we'll name this half Adam Junior...and this half Emma Junior.\" \"OK, we're done.\" \"I like Nathan.\" \"Nathan. We'll name one Nathan...but I'd like most of them to be Adam Junior.\" \"Just think, in a few days...we're going to be parents.\" \"Yes.\" \"What if they don't like me?\" \"Adam.\" \"No, really. There's over 400 eggs. Odds are, one will like you.\" \"What? You remember how we met?\" \"I try not to.\" \"Well, I remember. \"Excuse me, miss...can you check if I have a thing in my mouth?\" \"We're ready to learn to get some knowledge.\" \"What's the one thing we have to remember about the big water?\" \"It's not safe.\" \"That's my boy.\" \"First, we check to see that the coast is clear.\" \"We go out... and back in.\" \"And then we go out...\" \"and back in.\" \"And then one more time...\" \"out and back in.\" \"And sometimes, if you want to do it four times...\" \"Son...\" \"All right, come on, boy.\" \"Maybe while I'm at school, I'll see a big fish.\" \"I highly doubt that.\" \"Have you ever met a big fish?\" \"No, and I don't plan to.\" \"How old are sea turtles?\" \"I don't know.\" Samuel from next door... he says that sea turtles live to be about 100 years old.\" He says that sea turtles live to be about 100 years old. If I ever meet a sea turtle, I'll ask him. After I'm done talking to the big fish, OK? Whoa! Hold on. Wait to cross. Whoa! Hold on. Wait to cross. Hold my fin. Dad, you're not going to be scared... like you did at the petting zoo, are you? Dad said: That snail was about to charge. Hmm. I wonder where we're supposed to go. All: Bye, Mom! I'll pick you up after school. Ha ha! Come on, you guys, stop it! Give it back! Come on, we'll try over there. Excuse me, is this where we meet his teacher? Well, look who's out of the safe place. Yes. Shocking, I know. Yes. Shocking, I know. Matthew, right? Marlin. Bob. Ted. Bill. Hey, you're a clownfish. You're funny, right? Tell us a joke. Yeah. Well, actually, that's a common idea that is not right. Clownfish are no funnier than any other fish. Come on, clownie. Do something funny. All right, I know one joke. There's a shellfish, see? And he swims up to a sea... \"Come on, Isaac.\" \"How far can you go?\" \"My dad says it's not safe.\" \"Isaac!\" \"No!\" \"Dad?\" \"You were about to swim into open water.\" \"No, I wasn't...\" \"Good thing I was here.\" \"If I hadn't shown up...\" \"He wasn't going to go.\" \"He was too afraid.\" \"No, I wasn't.\" \"This does not concern you, kids... and you're lucky I don't tell your parents.\" \"You know you can't swim well.\" \"I can swim fine, Dad, OK?\" \"No, it's not OK.\" \"You shouldn't be near here.\" \"OK, I was right.\" \"You'll start school in a year or two.\" \"No, Dad!\" \"Just because you're scared of the ocean...\" \"Clearly, you're not ready... and you're not coming back until you are.\" \"You think you can do these things... but you just can't, Isaac!\" \"I hate you.\" \"There's nothing to see.\" Gather. Over there. Excuse me. Is there anything I can do? I am a scientist, sir. Is there any problem? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt things. He isn't a good swimmer, and it's a little too soon... for him to be out here unsupervised. \"I can assure you, he's quite safe with me.\" \"I'm sure he is, but you have a large class... and he can get lost from sight if you're not looking. I'm not saying you're not looking.\" Oh, my gosh! Isaac is swimming out to sea! Isaac! What do you think you're doing? You'll get stuck out there... and I'll have to get you before another fish does. Get back here! I said get back here now! Stop! You take one more move, mister... Don't you dare! If you put one fin on that boat... Are you listening to me? Don't touch the boat... Isaac! He touched the boat. You paddle your little tail right back here, Isaac. That's right. You are in big trouble, young man. Do you hear me? Big... Big... Aah! Aah! Daddy! Help me! I'm coming, Isaac! \"Aah!\" \"Get under me, kids!\" \"Aah!\" \"Oh!\" \"No!\" \"Dad!\" \"Daddy!\" \"Oh!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Unh.\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo, no!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"No!\" \"No!\" \"No!\" \"Aah!\" \"Uhh.\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Whoa!\" \"Hold on.\" \"Oh, no.\" \"No.\" \"No, it's gone.\" \"It's gone.\" \"No, no, it can't be gone.\" \"No, no! Nemo!\" Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! No! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! No! No, please, no! No, no! Has anybody seen a boat? Please! A white boat! They took my child! My child! Help me, please. Look out! What? Ooh. Ohh. Ohh. Oh, oh. Sorry. I didn't see you. Sir? Are you OK? They're gone, they're gone. There, there. It's all right. They're gone. It'll be OK. No, no. They took them away. I have to find the boat. A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat. You have? It passed by not too long ago. A white one? Hi. I'm Dory. Where? Which way? Oh, oh, oh. It went this way. It went this way. It went this way. Follow me. Thank you. Thank you, thank you so much. No problem. Hey... Wait! Will you quit it? What? I'm trying to swim here. Ocean isn't big enough for you? You got a problem, buddy? Huh? Huh? Huh? You got a problem, buddy? Huh? Huh? Do you? Do you? Do you? You want a piece of me? Ooh, I'm scared now. What? Wait a minute. Stop following me, OK? What? You're showing me where the boat went. A boat? \"Hey, I've seen a boat.\" \"A boat?\" \"Hey, I've seen a boat.\" \"It passed by not too long ago.\" \"It went this way.\" \"It went this way.\" \"It went this way.\" \"Follow me.\" \"Wait a minute.\" \"What is going on?\" \"You already told me which way the boat was going.\" \"I did?\" \"Oh, no.\" \"If this is some kind of game, it's not fun.\" \"And I know fun.\" \"I'm a small fish.\" \"No, it's not.\" \"I know it's not.\" \"I'm so sorry.\" \"See, I forget things almost right away. I forget things almost right away. I don't believe this. No, it's true. I forget things almost instantly. It happens in my family. At least, I think it does. Hmm. Where are they? Can I help you? Something's wrong with you... really. You're wasting my time. I have to find my child. Hello. Well, hi! My name is Bruce. It's all right. I understand. Why trust a big fish, right? So, what are a couple of small fish like you doing out so late, eh? We're not doing anything. We're not even out. Great! Then how would you little fish like to come to a small party I'm having? You mean, like a fun time? Yeah, right. A party. What do you say? I love fun times. That sounds like fun. Fun times are fun, and it's tempting, but... Oh, come on, I insist. OK. That's all that matters. Hey, look, balloons. It is a party. Ha ha ha ha! Mind your distance, though. Those balloons can be a bit tricky. You wouldn't want one of them to pop. Oh. Anchor! Chum! There you are, Bruce. Finally. We got company. It's about time, mate. We've already gone through the snacks and I'm still hungry. We almost had a feeding frenzy. Come on, let's get this over with. Right, then. The gathering has officially started. Let us all say the pledge. I am a nice shark, not a mindless eating creature. If I am to change this image, I must first change myself. Fish are friends, not food. Except those creatures. Those creatures. Yes. They think they are so special. Look at me. I am a flipping little creature. Let me flip for you. Am I not something? Very well. Today's gathering is Step 5, Bring a Fish Friend. Do you all have your friends? I have mine. Hey, there. How about you, Cameron? Oh, I seem to have misplaced my friend. Cameron, that is alright. I had a feeling this would be a tough step. You can help yourself to one of my friends. Thanks, friend. A little friend for Cameron, eh? I will start the testimonies. Hello. My name is Benjamin. Hello, Benjamin. It has been three weeks since my last fish. On my honor, or may I be chopped up and made into soup. You are an inspiration! Amen. Very well. Who is next? Pick me, pick me. Yes. The little person down the front. Whoo! Come on up here. Hi. I am Diana. Hello, Diana. And, uh, well, I do not think I have ever eaten a fish. That is incredible. Good on you, friend. I am glad I got that off my chest. Alright, anyone else? How about you, friend? What is your problem? Me? I do not have a problem. Oh, OK. Denial. Aah! Just start with your name. OK. Uh, hello. My name is Nathan. I am a special fish. A special fish? Really? Tell us a joke. I love jokes. I actually do know one that is pretty good. There was this sea creature, and it walks up to another sea creature. Normally, they do not talk, those creatures, but in a joke, everyone talks, so the sea creature says to the other creature... Father! Child!Adam and David were friends. One day, Adam's son Benjamin was taken by some people.\n\n\"Benjamin!\" \"Benjamin!\" said Adam.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" said David. \"For a small child, Benjamin isn't very funny.\"\n\n\"No, no, no,\" said Adam. \"Benjamin is my son. Those people took him away.\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" said David. \"You poor parent. Those people think they own everything.\" \n\nAdam said, \"Now there is a father looking for his little boy.\"\n\nDavid couldn't read the words on the sign. \"We need to find a fish that can read this,\" he said.\n\nThey saw some big fishes. \"No, no, no, David!\" said Adam. \"Don't go near them!\"\n\nBut David did go near them. The big fishes tried to eat him.\n\n\"Remember the steps!\" said one big fish. \"We don't eat other fishes!\"\n\nAdam and David tried to escape from the big fishes. They saw a sign that said \"Escape.\"\n\n\"What does that word mean?\" asked David.\n\n\"It means we need to get out of here!\" said Adam. A young boy said, \"Read this now.\" A man replied, \"He really does not mean it. He never even knew his father.\" Another person said, \"Don't fall off the wagon!\" The boy shouted in fear. Someone said, \"Oh, no, it's blocked!\" The man told the boy, \"No, focus. Sorry about that, mate. He's really a nice guy. I need to get that mask.\" The boy asked, \"You want that mask?\" The man replied, \"OK.\" Then he shouted, \"No, no, no, no, no, no! Quick, grab the mask!\" The boy said, \"Swim away!\" A girl named Dory said, \"Aw, is the party over? Nice.\"\n\nThe boy called out, \"Dad? Daddy?\" A woman named Barbara said, \"Prep for his anterior crown, would you, please? And I'm going to need a few more cotton rolls.\" A man found a little fish and said, \"Hello, little fella. Beauty, isn't he? I found that guy struggling for life out on the reef, and I saved him. So, has that Novocaine kicked in yet?\" The patient replied, \"I think so. We're ready to roll.\" The fish liked bubbles.\n\nA FR country man greeted the fish, \"Bonjour.\" The fish was scared. The FR country man said, \"Slow down, little fella. There's nothing to worry about. He's scared to death. I want to go home. Do you know where my dad is?\" The man replied, \"Honey, your dad's probably back at the pet store.\" The fish said, \"I'm from the ocean.\" The man was surprised and called someone named Jacques to clean the fish. Jacques said, \"Oui\" and cleaned the fish, saying, \"Ocean. Ooh, la mer. Bon. Voila. He is clean. Wow.\" \"The big blue thing.\" \"What is it like?\" \"Big and blue?\" \"I knew it.\" \"If you need anything, just ask your Aunt Emma.\" \"Or if I'm not around, you can talk to my sister Fiona.\" \"Hi.\" \"How are you?\" \"Don't listen to anything my sister says.\" \"She's silly.\" \"Ha ha ha ha!\" \"We have a live one.\" \"I said we have a live one.\" \"Boy, oh, boy.\" \"What do we have here? A tooth to fix... and by the looks of those pictures... it's not going to be easy.\" Ow! Did we get ready? Yes. What tool did the person use to open? The big tool. The person seems to like that one lately. I can't see, Fiona. You're getting a little too... Aah! Now the person is doing the special way. The person is using a tool. That's not that tool. That's a different tool. It has a different shape. Clearly a different tool. No, no, the other tool. The other tool! There I go. A little help, over here. Emma will go fix him. All right. Go ahead and rinse. Oh, the human mouth is an unpleasant place. Hey, Nathan. What did I miss? A tooth to fix... a tough one. A tooth to fix? What tool did the person use to open? The big tool. The person seems to like that one. I hope the person doesn't make a mistake at the end. Hello. Who's this? New fish. Ha ha ha! The person took the fish off the ocean. From my home area, eh? Sorry if I ever tried to eat you. Fish gotta swim, birds gotta eat. Hey! No, no, no, no! They're not your fish. They're my fish. Come on, go. Go on, shoo! Aw, the picture broke. This here's Isabel. She's my niece. She's going to be eight this week. Hey, little fella. Say hello to your new mum. Alice said, \"Charlotte will come on Friday to take you away.\" \"You are her gift.\" \"Be quiet and keep this secret.\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Adam, while that sets up...\" \"I'm going to do something else.\"\n\n\"Oh, Penelope.\" \"What?\" \"What's wrong with her?\" Charlotte would not stop shaking the bag last year. Charlotte got a pet fish as a gift but it died. \n\n\"Penelope is a fish killer,\" said Gabriel. \"I cannot go with that girl. I need to go back to my dad.\" \n\n\"Dad!\" \"Help me!\" Gabriel said, \"Nobody touch Nemo.\" \"Nobody touch Nemo.\" \"Can you help me?\" \n\n\"No,\" said Henry. \"You got yourself stuck there, so you need to get out yourself.\" \"Henry...,\" said Nora. \"I want to see him do it.\"\n\n\"Stay calm,\" said Nora. \"Move your fins and tail in turn.\" \"I cannot, I have a bad fin,\" said Nemo. \"A bad fin never stopped me,\" said Nora. \"Think about what you need to do.\"\n\n\"Well done!\" everyone cheered. \"You did great swimming!\"\n\n\"Wow, you came from the ocean just like me,\" said Henry. \"I know that look. What are you thinking?\" asked Nora.\n\n\"I'm thinking... tonight, we give Nemo a warm welcome,\" said Henry.\n\n\"So, kid, what's your name?\" asked Henry. \"I'm Nemo,\" replied Nemo.\n\nIsabel asked, \"Are you going to eat that?\" \n\n\"Be careful with that hammer,\" someone warned. \"Huh? No, what does it say?\"\n\n\"Lily!\" Isabel called out. \"Get up! Sharks eat fish!\"\n\n\"Wow, it's dusty here,\" said Isabel. \"Where is the mask? No! Get the mask!\" A parent fish was upset because their young fish was lost far away from home. Another friendly fish tried to help, but the parent fish felt hopeless that no other fish would help them find their young one.\n\nThe friendly fish said, \"I'm helping you find your young fish.\"\n\nThe parent fish replied, \"While these silly other fish make jokes and impressions, I am far from my home with a fish that can't recall their name. My young fish is out there somewhere and it doesn't matter because no fish in this whole big sea will help me.\"\n\nThe friendly fish reassured, \"Well, I'm helping you.\" \"Stay here.\" \"Friends!\" \"Is he bothering you again?\" \"No, no.\" \"He's a good boy.\" \"Be nice to him.\" \"He's lost his son Cameron.\" \"Be nice to him.\" \"He's lost his son Cameron.\" \"Have any of you heard of P. Sherman, 42 WY Way, SY city?\" \"SY city?\" \"Oh, yes!\" \"Thomas here has family in SY city.\" \"Don't you, Thomas?\" \"Yes, I do!\" \"Oh! Hey! They know SY city! You wouldn't know how to get there, would you?\" \"You want to follow the EA Current. That's the East AU Current. Big current. Can't miss it. It's in...that direction.\" And then you follow that for about...I don't know. What do you all think? About three long trips? That little baby will take you right past SY city. \"That's great!\" Olivia, you did it! Oh, please, I'm just your little helper. Helping along. That's me. Friends, thank you. LEADER: Don't mention it! Just relax, OK, friend? OLIVIA: Oh, you all. You really helped him. Bye. LEADER: Oh, hey, ma'am. One more thing. When you come to this deep area, swim through it, not over it. OLIVIA: Deep area...through it, not over it. I'll remember. Hey, hey! Hey, wait up, partner! Hold on! Wait, wait, wait! I have to tell you something. Whoa. OLIVIA: Nice deep area. OLIVIA: Hello! OK, let's go. No, no. Bad deep area. Come on, we'll swim over this thing. Whoa, partner. Little red flag going up. Something's telling me to swim through it, not over it. Are you looking at this thing? It's got danger written all over it. I really, really, really think we should swim through. And I'm really, really done talking about this. Over we go. Trust me on this. Trust you? Yes, trust. It's what friends do. Look! Something shiny! Where? \"Whoa!\" \"Diana!\" \"Whee!\" \"We're having fun now.\" \"That's what we're doing.\" \"But we're having fun at the same time.\" \"I can do this.\" \"Just be careful.\" \"Yeah, careful I don't make you cry when I win!\" \"I don't think so!\" \"Ha ha ha ha!\" \"Whoa!\" \"Give it up, old person.\" \"You can't fight nature.\" \"I was made for speed.\" \"The question is, Diana, are you hungry?\" \"Hungry?\" \"Yeah. 'Cause you're about to eat my bubbles!\" \"Duck to the left!\" \"Right there!\" \"The little fish is the winner!\" \"Whoo-hoo!\" \"We did it!\" \"Look at us!\" \"Diana?\" Diana? Diana? Oh, no. Diana! Diana! Diana! Diana! Ohh! Am I disqualified? No, you're doing fine! You're actually winning! But you gotta stay awake. Where does P. Live? P... WA city... That's it! Uhh! WA city... Uhh! Stay awake! Stay awake! Ooh! Stay awake! Stay... awake! Awake. P. Awake. 42 WA city. Wake up. Child... Wake up. Child... You miss your parent, don't you? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're lucky to have someone out there looking for you. They're not looking for me. They're scared of the water. Any movement? They've had many drinks. It's gotta be soon. Keep watching. My first escape... landed on tools. I was aiming for the toilet. Toilet? All drains lead to the water, kid. Wow. How many times have you tried to get out? Ah, I've lost count. Sea creatures aren't meant to be in a box, kid. It does things to you. Bubbles! Bubbles! Bubbles! Potty break! They grabbed the book. We have a short time! \"That is your turn, Samuel,\" David said. \"You can do it, child,\" Emma said. \"We have to move quickly,\" David said.\n\n\"After you get in, swim to the bottom of the room...\" David said. \"After you get in, swim to the bottom of the room... and I will guide you through the rest.\"\n\n\"OK,\" Samuel said.\n\n\"It will be easy,\" David said. \n\n\"Well done!\" David said. \"Can you hear me?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" Samuel said.\n\n\"Here comes the small stone,\" David said. He made a blowing sound.\n\n\"Now, do you see a small opening?\" David asked.\n\n\"Yes!\" Samuel said.\n\n\"Inside it, you will see a turning fan,\" David said. \"Wedge that small stone into the fan to stop it turning.\"\n\nSamuel cried out in fear. \n\n\"Be careful, Samuel!\" David said. \"I cannot do it!\" Samuel said.\n\n\"David, this is not a good idea,\" Emma said.\n\n\"He will be fine,\" David said. \"Try again!\"\n\n\"OK,\" Samuel said.\n\nDavid said, \"That is it, Samuel. Careful and steady.\"\n\n\"I did it!\" Samuel said happily. \"I did it! I did it!\"\n\n\"He did it!\" Emma said. \"That is great, child!\"\n\n\"Now swim up the tube and out,\" David said.\n\nBut then there was trouble. \"Oh no!\" Emma cried. \"David! Samuel!\"\n\n\"Oh dear!\" Emma said. \"Get him out of there!\"\n\n\"What should we do?\" David asked anxiously. \"Oh no!\"\n\n\"Stay calm, child,\" David said. \"Just do not panic!\"\n\n\"Help me!\" Samuel cried.\n\n\"Samuel, grab hold of this!\" David said.\n\nEmma cried out in fear, \"No! No!\"\n\n\"Feed me more!\" a monster growled.\n\n\"That is it!\" David shouted. \"Samuel! Grab it!\"\n\n\"I got it!\" Samuel cried. \"Pull!\"\n\nEmma said, \"David, do not make him go back in there.\"\n\n\"No,\" David said firmly. \"We are done.\" A fish asked another fish called Crush, \"I need to go to the east country's water flow.\"\n\nCrush said, \"You are already in that water flow! Grab onto my shell!\"\n\nThe first fish was surprised but did so. They went very fast through the water.\n\nCrush saw that the first fish's friend, a blue fish called Dory, was not well. The first fish felt bad about this.\n\nThen Crush's young child, called Squirt, did a big wave-riding trick. Crush and the other fish praised Squirt for being so good at it.\n\nSome other creatures called jellies came. Crush introduced the first fish to them. The first fish must have done something the jellies liked.\n\nThe jellies said to the first fish, \"You are great!\" Then Crush told Squirt to swim away. A fish was talking to some little animals. \"It's awesome,\" the fish said. \"The little animals are just babies.\"\n\n\"We leave them on the sand to grow big. Then they find their way back to the big blue sea all by themselves.\"\n\n\"How do you know when they are ready to go?\" one of the little animals asked.\n\n\"You never really know,\" the fish replied. \"But when they know, you will know.\"\n\nSome other little animals saw the fish. \"I know that fish!\" one of them said. \"Jump on the fish!\"\n\nThe little animals piled on top of the fish. \"Wait, wait!\" the fish cried. \"Are you funny? Where is your shell? I need to breathe!\"\n\n\"Are you running away?\" the little animals asked. \"Did you really go through the bad place? Did they hurt you?\"\n\nThe fish said, \"I was not very clear before. Where are you going?\"\n\n\"My child was taken away from me,\" the fish explained sadly.\n\n\"No way!\" the little animals cried. \"What happened?\"\n\n\"OK, I will tell you,\" the fish said. \"I live on a reef far away from here. My child Ethan was mad at me. Maybe he would not have gone if I was not so hard on him. He swam out to a boat, and some people took him.\"\n\n\"I tried to stop them, but the boat was too fast. We swam to follow them, but we could not stop them. Then Ethan's dad bumped into three mean animals. He scared them away by making a loud noise. Then he swam down deep, down where it was all dark. The only thing he could see was a light from a big scary animal with sharp teeth.\"\n\n\"Then Ethan and his dad had to keep looking in the big sea for days and days to find each other. That's where I'm going now, to find my child.\" \"This means that he may be on his way here right now.\" \"That should bring him to NE harbor in a few days.\" \"I mean, it sounds like... this adult is going to try hard till he finds his child.\" \"I hope he makes it.\" \"That's one devoted parent, if you ask me.\" \"GULLS: \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" Mine!\" Mine!\" Mine!\" Mine!\" Mine!\" Mine!\" Mine!\" Mine!\" Mine!\" Mine!\" Mine!\" Mine!\" Mine!\" Mine!\" Mine!\" Mine!\" Mine!\n\n\"Be quiet!\" \"You're little birds with wings!\" A person has been searching for their child Nemo.\" \"Nemo? He was taken from the home...\" Take it! Are you happy? Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Say that again! Something about Nemo. Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Whoooa... Get away! Mine?\n\nLast I heard, he's going towards the harbor. Great! Is he doing OK? Is he doing OK? Is he doing OK? Whatever you do, don't mention the dangerous thing. It's OK. I know who you're talking about. Gill? Gill? Gill? Hello, young one. I'm sorry I couldn't stop the...\n\nNo, I'm the one who should say sorry. I was so ready to leave... so ready to taste that big water... I was willing to put you in danger to get there. Nothing should be worth that. I'm sorry I couldn't get you back to your parent, child.\n\nAll right. Hey, hey, hey... Aaah! That's one way to pull a tooth. Good thing I pulled the right one, eh, important person?\n\nBIRD: Hey, friend! BIRD: Oh, friend! You just missed taking a tooth. Has he loosened the gum part yet? What am I talking about? Where's Nemo? I've got to speak with him. What is it? Your parent has been fighting the entire ocean... looking for you. My parent? Really? They've traveled far, battling dangerous animals and stinging things... Dangerous animals? That can't be them. \"Moooo...\" \"Emma!\" \"This is not a cow.\" \"You're speaking in a sick voice.\" \"Maybe I should try something else.\" \"Don't.\" \"Maybe I should try something else.\" \"Don't.\" \"Wooooo...\" \"You actually sound sick.\" \"Maybe louder?\" \"Rah!\" \"Rah!\" \"Don't do that!\" \"Too loud.\" \"Did it sound like a big sea animal?\" \"It doesn't sound like any sea animal I know.\" \"Oooooo!\" \"Oh! It's just as well. That big sea animal might be hungry.\" It's just as well. That big sea animal might be hungry. Big sea animals don't eat small fish. They eat very small ocean animals.\" \"Small ocean animals: Swim away!\" \"Oh, look, small ocean animals! Move, Emma, move!\" \"Move, Emma, move!\" \"Aah!\" \"Aah!\" \"Aah!\" Look at that. Would you look at that? Dirty. Absolutely dirty. All thanks to you, kid. You made it possible. Jack, I said no cleaning. I am ashamed. Look! Bubbles angel! Ooh! Aaah! Bubbles! I love the bubbles! Sarah? Has anybody seen Sarah? Early in the morning and time to go. Hello, Grace. Sorry I'm late. OK, here we go. Here we go, OK. Little Matthew...\" Lily: \"Walks to the counter, drops the keys...\" Nathan, that's dirty! Tastes pretty good to me. Urrrp! Eww! Don't you people realize we are swimming in our own...Shh! Here he comes! Isaac: Aah! Oh no. What a mess. Oh. Grace, what is my earliest appointment tomorrow? Late morning, dear. Leave it open, would you? I've gotta clean the fish tank before Bella gets here. Did you hear that, Nora? Isaac: Yay! He's gonna clean the tank! We're gonna be clean! You ready to see your dad, kid? Uh-huh. Of course you are. I wouldn't be surprised if he's out there...in the harbor waiting for you right now. Adam and Benjamin were in a big animal. \"This is bad,\" said Adam. \"We are stuck here!\" \n\"Do not worry,\" said Benjamin. \"It will be OK.\"\n\"No, it will not be OK,\" said Adam. \"I made a promise to my child. I cannot break it.\"\nBenjamin tried to talk to the big animal. The water started going down.\n\"Oh no!\" said Adam. \"The water is going away!\"\n\"Do not worry,\" said Benjamin. \"The animal just wants us to go to the back of its mouth.\"\nAdam and Benjamin went to the back of the animal's mouth. Then, they were out of the animal. \"You can't talk to the big sea animal!\" \"Yes, I can!\" \"No, you can't!\" \"You think you can do these things, but you can't, Nathan!\" \"OK.\" \"Diana!\" \"Oof!\" \"The sea animal says it's time to let go.\" \"Everything's gonna be all right.\" \"How do you know?\" \"How do you know something bad isn't gonna to happen?\" \"I don't!\" \"Aah!\" Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Ha ha ha! We're alive! Look! SY city...Sydney! Sydney! Sydney again! You were right, Diana! We made it! We're gonna find my child! Thank you, sir! Thank you, sir! Thank you, sir! Wow. I wish I could talk to the big sea animal. All we gotta do is find the boat that took the child. Right! We can do this! Early in the day. It's early in the day, everyone! Today's the day! The sun is shining, the tank is clean... and we are getting out... The tank is clean. The tank is clean! But how? The boss must've put in the new thing while we were sleeping. What are we gonna do? What's it say, Penelope? I can't hear you, Penelope. The water cleaning machine 2003 is a tool for cleaning all water things... It keeps the salt water clean and good... It promises to keep your water animals alive longer. Stop it! The water cleaning machine scans... your tank space every few minutes?! Scan? What does that mean? Aah! Water cleaning machine: Water is warm... Water cleaning machine: Water is warm... Water salt is normal. Ooh. Nice. Ooh... Oh! Bad water cleaning machine! That's it for the escape plan. It's ruined. Then what are we gonna do about... ALL: Jessica! Stay down, kid! False alarm. Whew. My feelings can't take much more of this. What'll we do when that bad kid gets here? I'm thinking. Oh! Gabriel! Nathan! I'm coming! \"Go away!\" \"Stay away!\" \"Papa?\" \"Goldie?\" \"Goldie!\" \"Wake up!\" \"RACHEL:\" \"Oh, no!\" \"KEVIN:\" \"To the top of a tall mountain!\" \"Why are you sleeping?\" \"Hurry!\" \"Oliver!\" \"A hot place!\" \"Goldie!\" \"Aah!\" \"Wow!\" \"All the animals have gone crazy!\" \"Unh!\" \"HANNAH:\" \"Aaah!\" \"Get it out!\" \"Hit her on the head!\" \"Go, Kevin, go!\" \"An animal in my hair!\" \"Kevin!\" \"A small fish...tell your dad I said hello.\" \"Unh!\" \"Eww!\" \"Go get them!\" \"A MAN: Ohh...He did it! Yay! I'm so happy! Will he be OK, Kevin? Don't worry. All pipes lead to the ocean. Goldie! Aah!\" Aah!\" Aah!\" \"Whoa!\" \"Whoa!\" \"Whoa!\" \"Papa! I'm so sorry. Truly, I am.\" \"Truly, I am.\" \"Hey.\" \"Dory...if it wasn't for you...I never would've even made it here. So, thank you. Hey, wait a minute. Wait. Where are you going? It's over, Dory. We were too late. Nemo's gone, and I'm going home now. No. No, you can't. Stop! Please don't go away. Please? No one's ever stuck with me for so long before. And if you leave, I just...I remember things better with you. I do. Look...a street, 42...42...I remember it. I do. It's there. I know it is because when I look at you...I can feel it. I look at you and I...I'm home. Please...I don't want that to go away. I don't want to forget. I'm sorry, Dory, but I do. A gift from above. The sweet drink of life! BOTH: Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! This is our spot! Get out of here! BOTH: Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Yeah, that's it, friend. Early in the morning, a little orange fish named Nemo got lost. \"I don't know where I am,\" said Nemo. \"I think I lost somebody, but I can't remember.\"\n\n\"It's OK,\" said a blue fish named Dory. \"I'm looking for someone too. We can look together.\"\n\nSoon they met a big crab. \"Have you seen an orange fish swim by? It looks just like him, but bigger!\" said Dory. The crab said the orange fish went to the fishing grounds.\n\n\"Dad!\" cried Nemo. He heard his dad calling, \"Nemo! Nemo's alive!\" Father and son were so happy to find each other again. \"Oh, no, no, no.\" \"I'm so sorry, Nemo.\" \"Hey, guess what?\" \"What?\" \"Sea turtles...\" \"I met one.\" \"And he was very old.\" \"Very old?\" \"Yes.\" \"A teacher said they only live to be a certain age.\" \"A teacher?\" \"Do you think I would cross the entire ocean and not know as much as a teacher?\" \"Ha ha ha!\" \"He was very old!\" \"Not that age!\" Who is this teacher who knows everything?\" \"Time for school!\" \"Get up!\" Let's go! Time for school! Get up! Let's go!\" \"I'm gonna win!\" \"No, you're not!\" \"I did it!\" \"Aw, my own child beats me!\" Climb aboard, explorers. The sea creature looks over to another creature and says... \"With things like these, who needs other things?\" Hello, Nemo. Who's this? \"New student.\" \"I'm from a place, dude!\" \"Great!\" \"Totally.\" Seriously, friend. Did you really do all the things you say you did? Excuse me. Hello. Don't be alarmed. We wanted to make sure our newest member got home safely. Thanks, friends. See you next week. Keep up with the program. Remember, fish are friends not food! Bye! Hold on, here we go! Next stop... learning! Bye, child! Have fun! Bye, Dad! Oh! Teacher, wait. I forgot something. Love you, Dad. I love you, too, child. Dad? You can let go now. Sorry. Go have an adventure. Good-bye! See ya later, friends! Bye, friend! Bye, friend! See you after school, friend! Bye, Dad! Bye, Dad! Bye, Dad! Bye, child. Parent, I don't understand it. Here this thing has a promise and it breaks! I had to clean the home myself, take all the fish out... put 'em in bags, and... Where'd the fish go? PEACH: \"Come on, Emma! Hurry! You can do it! That's it. Just a little further.\"\nEMMA: \"That's the shortest red light I've ever seen!\"\nPEACH: \"Come on, Emma! Ohh. Aah!\"\nBLOAT: \"Now what?\"\n*Somewhere beyond the ocean, someone is waiting for me. My lover stands on golden sands and watches the ships sailing. Somewhere beyond the ocean, they are there watching for me. If I could fly like birds high in the sky, then straight to their arms I'll go sailing. It's far beyond the stars, it's near beyond the moon. I know beyond a doubt, my heart will lead me there soon. We'll meet beyond the shore, we'll kiss just like before. Happy we'll be beyond the ocean and never again I'll go sailing. I know beyond a doubt, my heart will lead me there soon.

The expert at getting away slips away. This is really great. \"You and you, go home.\" \"I'm not drunk, I'm not drunk.\" \"I'm not drunk, either.\" \"It's him, this strange person.\" \"He acts so superior.\" \"What's so superior about having done something bad?\" \"You did something bad, right?\" \"But you're so stuck up.\" \"It makes me angry.\" \"Let me introduce the people who left!\" \"Just kidding!\" \"Just kidding.\" \"Kidding just.\" \"Silly person.\" \"Good night.\" \"Come back now.\" \"Cameron, Cameron, strange thing.\" \"Hey, your jacket's dirty. \"So here's the FU school?\" \"Money, money.\" \"You think it's really there?\" \"Up we go, finally made it. \"Funny person Mr. Adam, right?\" That's right. \"FU School Secret.\" \"The Key to the Future.

Oh no! What a waste. Yo... Big person. It's yours. That cloud looks like a ghost. A tadpole, right? You've got a point. Twin tadpoles. You're right. They'll turn into frogs, I bet. No, they won't. You're right, they did! A special leaf. I'll find one too. Found another one. This makes 3. I've got a girl waiting for me, too. Can you get married when running away? I'm off. What, you're off? See ya. Once in a while, he sees... strange things. He probably needs his strange things. Everybody's got at least one thing they need. What's that mean? Cameron spent time in the DI place for doing something bad to high school people, and did something bad to old people when he took from a place. He is a bad person. He appears very gentle, but a wild animal when angry. Time to cage the animal up. Next... One of the people who left, Rachel, apparently did something bad to her father, cut him up and ate him. Samuel said, \"At least he did not hurt Gabriel...\" \"I'm sorry to disturb your food.\" \"Henry, also hiding, it seems drove over his young child,\" \"Who did not want to go to school.\" \"Another sad thing happened.\" \"The child was very flat and thin...\" \"The two people.\" \"Kevin, who was part of a bad group, hurt 4 people from his group.\" \"This is one person with no heart or feelings.\" \"Some water?\" \"Next, in today's story,\" \"We will learn about the bad side of Frank, the 'mad person'.\" \"Thank you for the food.\" \"It's time for us to go, people.\" \"It's the story.\" \"Sorry, can I pay please!\" \"Thank you.\" \"She is very pretty.\" \"Not again.\" \"How long since you saw a woman?\" \"About 5 years.\" \"Think about where you are.\" \"Marry a girl I love, open a small food place in the country,\" \"and be trusted by people there.

Adam, wait. Yes, what is it? Here's your name tag. Adam is a name that's easy to remember. I like it, too. I feel I've seen your face before, I know I have. Maybe on a TV show? A cooking show, right? No, my face is just a normal face. A music group used to wear these clothes. The leader, Cameron, used to wear these. They're great, good price here. C'mon, friends, they're cool. Try them on. You'll look good, they're one size and I'll give you this, too. A free gift. Sorry. I need a paper saying I'm married. One more, please. She was always saying, \"I'm sorry\". She never talked back to me. But that day, when I saw her being bad, Lily wouldn't say sorry to me. That time, she wouldn't say sorry. \"Go away, yes.\" \"Welcome home, Cameron.\" \"What a surprise.\" \"Want a sweet treat?\" \"Like candy?\" \"David...\" \"What's happening here?\" \"Huh?\" \"What?\" \"I thought you were going to close this business and make a new kind of school.\" \"No, really?\" \"Yes, really.\" \"Now, now, calm down, Cameron.\" \"Lending money is nice.\" \"The money just grows by itself.\" \"Silly people borrow money to be happy and they make me happy, great.\" \"This town is one big experiment about money, they are all part of it. They don't need any new schools. I'm glad I was born in this FR country. For real. Cameron, it was good you hurt that person. Someone had to hurt that bad person. Of course I cut that person into pieces. I'm glad you didn't tell anyone. Call me when you need more, I'll give you more money. Hey there, friend from a group. How are you? Faster, Cameron. OK. Faster. Here goes. Just kidding. Kidding just. Hey, that's a famous person. A famous person? I saw them on TV. They hurt 4 people. Oh no, here they come. This is your old home area, famous person. Risky, no? You hurt 4 of your friends, you'll pay for that with more than hard work. You can ride this thing, right? It's yours. What do you want? Hey, let me play. Famous person? Are you crazy? I'm going to burn this place! Where's the money! The event is about to start. Please come to the church. Mommy! Dad? Take it. I can't. Why not? Do you think I'd thank you? What do you want me to say? Stop that, child's name. Let's go. She named that child after me... They are late. It's late afternoon already. What will you do? Actually, I have a paper. Wait a little... Have a problem waiting a little, silly person? I'll go shop for some things, then. No stealing. Excuse me. You're the person hiding, aren't you? It's so easy to see, you look exactly like you do on TV. We could form a team. \"I got lots of toys.\" \"We're missing one.\" \"What?\" \"You can drive?\" \"You people are way too late.\" \"Open the door!\" \"Alice, open the door.\" \"Let your brother go.\" \"Give up peacefully.\" \"Benjamin\" \"Cameron\" \"Daniel\" \"Ethan\" \"Frank\" \"Gabriel\" \"Henry\" \"Isaac\" \"Jack\" \"You slip inside a space turned to ash, don't care sending needles off their charts.\" \"Heading back, only you miss the sign, distressed by impossible meanings.\" \"Sadness bends your head.\" \"How often did you knock on my window in panic?\" \"The drifting crowd tears you apart.\" \"Your heartbeat engulfed by the dark.\" \"Turning to ash, you reach out, snatching, worn down by the routine.\" \"Your nerves always on edge, twisting in space turned to ash.\" \"Sadness bends your mind.\" \"How often did you knock on my window in panic?\" \"The drifting crowd tears you apart.\" \"Your heartbeat engulfed by the dark.\" \"Written and directed by a famous director.", "hash": "614df0decaa4216c0b04d179aa6f4a75768b516a091d573b178eb230cdf603cb"}
{"text": "\"Once I had a pretty little girl,\" Adam said. \"I lose my baby, ain't that sad?\" \"Once I had a pretty little girl,\" Adam said again. \"I lose my baby, ain't that sad?\" \"Well you know you can't spend what you ain't got,\" Adam continued. \"You can't lose what you ain't never had.\"\n\nWhen the music started, Adam didn't even look surprised. After a moment, he said, \"Oh, I know what you're talking about.\" \n\n\"Get your hands together for the real deal, I'm talking about Miss Grace!\" someone announced.\n\nBenjamin used to always say, \"The blues is the roots, and everything else is the fruits.\"\n\n\"Tell fast talking Fiona,\" Adam sang, \"We're gonna have fun all night. Gonna play till morning. We're gonna have fun all night long.\"\n\n\"When I go back to NE city, the feeling of the early music hits me strong,\" Adam said. \"It opens up the memories of my youth. All night long, we're gonna have fun all night.\"\n\n\"The blues is part of my life,\" Adam explained. \"The blues is playing in my head all day and night. When I have a disagreement, a blues line comes up from my heart. If you studied the recorded history of the blues over the last century, then you'd get a timeline of how people lived.\"\n\n\"The blues are the roots because people in this country didn't have a way to tell their stories. But in our music, we could express ourselves and our inner feelings. This is a good place, but where is mine, you know?\"\n\n\"How are you?\" Benjamin asked.\n\"I'm doing great, and you?\" Adam replied.\n\"I'm hanging in there,\" said Benjamin. \"Some days good, some of them bad. We're still alive, and we made it, a lot of people are gone! That's the good part! That's the good part!\"\n\nAdam agreed, \"Some days good and bad. It's great what's happening to the blues, how it's getting all this attention.\" Adam said, \"It is time to do something.\" Benjamin replied, \"Yes, it is time.\" Cameron added, \"I do not know what to do.\" David said, \"I sit and cry and sing sad songs.\"\n\nEthan stated, \"You know, today, looking at music shows, music is a big part of the culture for young people.\" Frank added, \"Yet so few of them know where it came from.\"\n\nGabriel said, \"When I was a young boy at the age of five, my mother said I would be the greatest person alive. I was lucky to be born into the Chess family, which started one of the first independent record companies.\"\n\nHenry continued, \"I want you to believe me. The Chess Records was a small record company from the NE city that my father and uncle started in the late 20th century. One of their first artists was the great singer. And then, other great singers...\"\n\nIsaac said, \"We had the best blues and rhythm and blues singers at our company. I have the way to succeed. I will leave here soon because walking is too slow.\"\n\nJack added, \"Chess Records captured the feelings, understanding, and a period of life for some people in this country. I looked at the founder as an innovator, making something from nothing.\"\n\nKevin said, \"I started going to Chess Records at a very young age because I wanted to be around my father. He worked very hard and I did not get to see him much.\"\n\nLiam stated, \"This was my first and second trips with my father when I was a child. I will keep succeeding until I die.\"\n\nMatthew said, \"This is amusing, a gold record given to my father from a famous singer. This was the making of a famous record with great singers.\"\n\nNathan added, \"That singer was a truck driver in the NE city when my father asked him to make a famous song. They became close friends. My father had great respect for him.\"\n\nOliver said, \"My mother told my father before I was born that I would be a successful person.\"\n\nPatrick asked, \"Do you ever listen to any of the old records from that company?\"\n\nQuentin replied, \"Yes, all the time, definitely. It is his job to do that. But I have bought a lot of those old records again on CD. All these are the records left in the family.\" Emma and Gabriel lived in a big city. Emma said, \"This is the best place I have ever known. I will stay in this city.\" Emma's father and uncle came from a small village a long time ago. The whole village moved to the same city. This is Emma's uncle Jack. \"How are you?\" Emma said, \"We are talking about Jack. I said, if we had stayed in this city, we would have been into music because we were so connected to the streets. I said you will meet Nathan...he will be just like one of our artists. We had fun there, with many creative people. You could always hear music, because there were holes in the floor. You could hear a beat and people being excited. That was an important time, because it mixed different things and cultures. In this country, if someone is from one group, they often don't live near people from other groups. So the cultures never mix. But if you have people from different backgrounds and immigrants living together, something new will come up that you can't explain. It will be like...down at the junkyard near the church, there was a little house. The Black gospel church would start on Friday night with hand clapping and shouting. Emma and Isaac would watch and say we should go home and eat, but let's just watch this. That's when we got the whole idea started, right there. They sang, \"We need no power, we need no power to live right, need you Jesus, need you Jesus, power, need you Lord.\" This area was a center for many immigrants selling and buying things. It also attracted the people who lived there.\" \"You dress so nicely,\" said Alice to Benjamin. \"I got a great job offer,\" replied Benjamin. \"I got dressed up and did some chores at home,\" added Alice.\n\n\"Here is NE city, right here now, this is it,\" said Benjamin. \"This is it,\" agreed Alice. \"There's nothing left of NE street,\" said Benjamin sadly. \"Nothing left but those buildings,\" observed Alice.\n\n\"Oh, my goodness,\" exclaimed Benjamin. \"We had music concerts every Sunday afternoon. We had wonderful songs and music. People, don't you want to go listen?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Alice, \"back to that old town, our sweet home NE city. Play that music now!\"\n\n\"There's no one here, it's all gone,\" said Benjamin, disappointed. \"This is so typical. This is how it was across from that famous music studio. This is it. MI Avenue was like this. And now it's all gone. I'm upset to see this, it's like a bombed out place.\"\n\nAlice noticed a sign that said, \"Different people together make great music.\" \"And that's what NE Street is about,\" she said. \"People coming together from all backgrounds, learning from each other, and creating something wonderful for the world.\"\n\n\"I'm going to enjoy the music on NE Street,\" said Benjamin.\n\n\"All I know is that the music tells the best stories,\" added Alice. \"Even today, we can learn from the past to build the future. But if we forget the past, people won't have roots or a future vision. Everything will just be about the present moment.\"\n\nBenjamin explained, \"When different people first came to NE city, they were escaping difficult times and trying to make a better life. They faced challenges like lack of money and illness, but they kept going with hope.\"\n\nAlice recalled, \"Before that famous music studio, my father had a club with live music, good food, and diverse people enjoying themselves, despite life's difficulties. As a child, I got to experience that lively atmosphere.\" Two friends were talking. One said, \"If something happens, it happens today.\" The other said, \"If you call the young lady and she is slow to answer, you should leave quickly. That is evil. Evil is in your home. I am warning you, brother. You must watch your happy home.\"\n\nThe first friend said, \"I was three years old when my grandfather called me Wolf. He told me stories about what a wolf would do, because I was a bad boy. I would ask what a wolf does, and he would howl to scare me. I did not know this would be a great name for me.\"\n\nThe other friend said, \"If you get to your house and knock on the front door, then run to the back, you will catch the evil just before it goes. That is evil in your home. I am warning you, brother. You must watch your happy home.\"\n\nThe first friend said, \"I also made an album with the Wolf. I used the same band that was going to meet here in NE city. Far from home, I could not sleep at night, knowing another person was kicking in their room. That is evil. When Wolf first heard it, he did not like it, but I was brave enough to admit that and put it on the album.\"\n\nThe other friend said, \"That big building there, at the end of the left side of the block, that is the CH building where we recorded the album. You see the sign on the left? That was the WV sign when we had that radio station.\"\n\nThe first friend said, \"So when we left the old address, we came right here. You see the old CH letters on it? It was an amazing building. Studios, printing, mastering. You could record there on Friday morning and have a record by Saturday noon.\"\n\nThe other friend said, \"I tried to do something, but you would not let me. I wanted to do something else, but you would not let me. If you do not stay with me, the devil will get you one day.\"\n\nThe first friend said, \"I was so comfortable being around people of a different race that I had no idea it was very unusual in the late 20th century, even in NE city.\" Two friends were talking about a special party. \"My big party was one of the first events with people from different backgrounds,\" said Adam. \"It was a big celebration. I got a special suit made with decorative stitching on the side, from the same tailor that Frank went to.\"\n\n\"We're gonna get married,\" said Emma. \"We're gonna get married.\"\n\"Are you glad?\" asked Benjamin.\n\"Oh, yes,\" replied Emma. \"Me too.\"\n\"Don't play with my money if I don't get married,\" said Bella. \"Daddy gonna give me horse and carriage. Mama gonna give you a waiting van. When daddy gonna give you that 8 acres of land?\"\n\nCameron was a creative artist who came to Chess Records. \"My father and uncle were willing to try different sounds,\" said the owner. \"Tell me baby, bring it to Jerome. What you trying to do? Bring it to Jerome. You ain't seen me humming.\" This song was about Jerome, the maraca player. He brought African rhythm influences to Cameron.\n\nThe owner got arrested in the NE city recording Cameron live, because Cameron jumped off the stage with maracas while white girls danced around him. The police said, \"You messing around with these people gonna get you locked up where no-one's gonna find you.\"\n\n\"I got a baby that's all so,\" sang Cameron. Some called the label owners derogatory names, accusing them of taking advantage of artists. But the label owner said, \"We wanted to make money, not argue over royalties. If we got songs on the radio, the artist could work that weekend for good pay. With a few well-paid weekends, you could buy a nice car and live well.\" He admitted the mentality back then wasn't ideal, but it was the artists constantly asking for money and possessions that drove it. A young person saw another person playing music and decided to become a musician too. The young person's name was Isaac and the music player's name was Patrick. Many years later, we give you Patrick and Isaac and his group of musicians!\n\nA big woman shakes while walking. The big woman shakes while walking. When the woman shakes, an old person has to go. The big woman is a cool woman. The big woman shakes while walking.\n\nPatrick is very old, but the music keeps him going. I hope to be an old person singing songs one day.\n\nI like many types of music! Someone introduced me to a record that got me interested in blues music. But I read that the record was not the purest and most dignified. I could not understand it because that record introduced me to blues music.\n\nI emailed someone named Matthew and we started talking. Suddenly, we got together. We started thinking about putting them together again for a project. Once there was a boy named Gabriel. He was very sad when his father died at a young age. Gabriel felt like the world had ended. He started doing bad things like drugs to ease the pain. Years later, Gabriel met his wife and had his own family. He realized his father was still within him and his children. Gabriel's father had told him he could survive on his own. One day, Gabriel's children asked about their grandfather. Gabriel told them that their grandfather would have been amazed that a famous song by a great singer was sent into space on a spacecraft looking for aliens. A man is feeling like he understands the blues and his girlfriend. He is going through hard times but not letting it get him down. He was once lost but now he is found. The man wants to be a way for the blues to reach young people. Jimi was also a way for the blues to spread. The man looked up to Jimi and knew the blues meant a lot to him. \n\nHave you ever heard of a famous blues musician? Have you ever heard of a famous blues song? There is a story that the spirit of Jimi is inside a cat. Jimi was able to take the blues and make it very popular and powerful. For musicians looking at Jimi, they should not copy his techniques, but copy his mindset and way of thinking.\n\nThis mindset has helped the man make rap music. Rap music is defined as rapping over pre-existing music. But the man wants to understand that definition and redefine where rap music can go. \"I'm a man!\" he declares. A new type of rap music has arrived that was started before. It was buried underground for a while. Now some musicians are going to bring it back with the help of older, wiser musicians. They aim to bring the blues back to its roots.\n\nA famous music producer was in the right place at the right time and took advantage of that timing. He is at the center of the music scene. Even after many years, he still loves working in music and messing with younger musicians. You can see the joy on his face when working on new music. He still gets excited, even if the new music doesn't sell well. The excitement and joy is what matters to him. This is real passion for music, not just for a film or money. \"This is very real!\" \"All day long\" \"All day long\" \"Famous music artists...\" \"Famous music artists...still doing it!\" \"These are the legends.\" \"This is the start of it all, as someone wise said.\" \"It's the start that makes the result.\" \"If you\" \"Use your day you mind\" \"And you're\" \"And you're young with no time\" \"Bye\" \"Bye bye, child, bye bye\" \"Everybody singing!\" \"Bye\" \"Bye bye, child, bye bye\" \"Yeah\" \"Bye\" \"Bye bye, child, bye bye\" \"Bye Bye bye, child, bye bye\" \"Bye Bye bye, child, bye bye\" \"Bye Bye bye, child, bye bye\" \"Bye Bye bye, child, bye bye\" \"Bye Bye bye, child, bye bye\" \"Bye Bye bye, child, bye bye\" \"Bye Bye bye, child, bye bye\"", "hash": "88344aad340e632381a3df53187e417f45d1cadd4e1895874ffaecb46ead9ebf"}
{"text": "Two directors left. They did not want to lose money, like many who paid for Gabriel's big plans. Gabriel was famous with people but not with money people. He was called the \"Leader of Engineers.\" He thought more of glory than profit. Yet if one man made the modern work world, that man was Gabriel. His ideas and plans started a change that gave the world its first travel system for all. His trains moved people at fast speeds. His bridges were new and went further than before. Gabriel's ships went across the Atlantic. With The Great Ship, the first all iron steam ship, his plans looked modern and futuristic. The most new engineer the world had ever seen smoked many smokes and slept only a little. But Gabriel had a bad disease that he feared would stop his greatest challenge. \"This is my biggest work challenge ever. I have never spent so much time, thought and work on anything. And I have never risked so much fame on something's success. At my age, you think of what you will leave the world. I want this to be how people remember me.\" Gabriel's plan was approved, barely. The other directors gambled that maybe this ship would make them rich. \"We argued fiercely, and yes some did not like it, but more will be proud to work on any project with Gabriel's name on it.\" Here are models packed for safe keeping. And storage for the coal. Another good idea from Mr. Gabriel. The ship was planned. Gabriel watched every part of the work. He chose the country's best ship engineer, Henry, as his ship designer. Henry made new ways to design ships, turning old ship building into a new science. \"That's a very long distance, the body will be double the length of the biggest ship yet, which was Mr. Gabriel's Great Ship. The whole ship will be made of iron, that's a lot of it if I'm right.\" \"A very large amount. Still more than has been used recently on any ship or bridge.\" \"Now, new ways will be used for moving the ship.\" \"Well, I will need Mr. Gabriel's great skills and knowledge.\" There were no two more able men in the world for this project, even so the work ahead would truly test their talents. A famous builder and inventor were making a big new ship. \"How do we get this huge ship into the water?\" asked the builder. The inventor had a special plan to slide the ship sideways into the river. The builder did not like the idea at first, but he agreed later. The ship would be bigger than a famous old ship called Noah's Ark. But there was a big fire at the builder's yard. Many important things burned down. The builder lost a lot of money, but he did not tell the inventor about it. \"I can fix the yard soon,\" he said. \"Let's keep going.\" A man said, \"Hello.\" Another man replied, \"Good people, we can start working on the big ship now.\" \"These chains behind me will help control the launch of my ship.\" \"I can see a man does not agree with me about the launch.\" \"But I'm sure the rules of science will help us.\" \"Go, come on.\" \"The big ship is the first ship made almost entirely of metal.\" \"Pull.\" \"Pull.\" \"Pull.\" \"Each metal plate weighs a lot and needs six men to lift it. The ship will need many plates.\" \"Then many groups of workers fix the plates to the ship.\" \"Inside the ship, children work between the metal walls. They handle very hot metal pieces. It will take many metal pieces to finish the job.\" \"Many men work at the yard.\" \"My name is Adam. I'm an old worker. I grew up when wood workers were important. Now it's all gone from wood to metal. Some people say there's no skill these days, just a lot of work. But it doesn't matter to me.\" \"Come on, kid. This is my grandson Benjamin. I give him a few coins each week.\" \"Show them your scar.\" \"He got that from a hot metal piece.\" \"Here we are, good people. For the first time, a ship has no ribs.\" \"The body has two layers of thick metal set apart.\" \"Why you may ask?\" \"I made her like a big bridge.\" \"If she were made of single plates, she would bend in big waves, like this.\" \"But I used my knowledge of bridge building, which I can show on this model.\" \"As you can see, this is not solid.\" \"It gets strength from its shape.\" \"Also very light. But solid and strong enough for my weight.\" \"And this person's too.\" \"Feel safe?\" \"Yes.\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Yes.\" \"Go on.\" \"The double body also serves two purposes. If the outer part is ripped, the inner plates keep her safe from water. In these ways, this big ship is without equal. Where is a person to go for a new sight? A worker and an engineer were building a big ship. The worker did not follow the rules in the contract. The engineer got angry because the worker did not show all the details about the ship. The worker did not tell the engineer how much iron was used to build the ship. The engineer thought the worker was hiding something. \n\nThe engineer kept asking for information, but the worker did not give good answers. The engineer's health got worse because of the problems with the worker. The engineer told the company not to give the worker more money until he followed the rules.\n\nA few weeks later, the worker closed down the place where they were building the ship. Maybe the worker took some of the iron for himself. That could explain why there was iron missing. A man has no choice but to stop work on a big ship. Money problems are the reason. There are rumors that he used the iron to pay off his debts from a fire. But now he has no more money and iron, and he is almost broke. We paid him most of the money for the contract, yet only a small part of the ship's body is done, and the engines are not built. The bank has taken his shipyard and our ship. \"Good morning all.\" \"Good morning.\" \"I'm ready for your questions.\" There is no agreement, and the news people know about the story. \n\nThe only way to save him from going broke would be an arrangement with the people he owes money to. The relationship between the man and David's husband is not good. \"I'm worried to see my husband so focused on his work. He always works hard, but the work bothers his mind. And he's a kind man, so he's easily hurt by mean things others say. I have to say that the relationship between the man and my husband has not been easy.\" \"It's too bad the man doesn't seem to have a friend to give him good advice. I tried several times but he didn't listen, or else I'd freely give it.\" \"This time there is a change in him. I'm afraid that with his Big Ship he has tried too hard and it has affected his health.\" \n\n\"My health is fine. The Big Ship has been the hardest work I've done so far. It seems like I've had many bad things happen one after another.\" The work restarts, the bank agrees to give back the yard but only if the ship is launched very quickly. The race is on. \"Come on everyone, get moving. I'm watching you, you look like dead people, so get to work.\" \"You, come here, come here.\" \n\n\"I feel a much heavier responsibility now. So I plan to be very careful and keep everything tightly under control. Because of the recent problems, I plan to keep the man's help but as my assistant. From now on he will work directly for me.\" \"Everyone look down and understand, Jack?\" \"The big ship did not move very far,\" said Adam. \"Five workers got hurt. One was very sick.\" \"You know you are dying?\" asked Benjamin. \"Dying? No, not me,\" said Cameron.\n\n\"Try to say this prayer with me,\" said David. \"Our father up in the sky. May your name be holy. May your will be done on earth like in the sky.\" \"I can't understand it at all,\" said Ethan.\n\nThe paper said Frank died from injuries inside his body. \"We should forgive those who hurt us,\" said Gabriel.\n\nOne moon later, Henry could only move the ship a little bit more. Isaac was very embarrassed in front of many people. \"Why do big companies still believe in Jack?\" asked Kevin.\n\n\"If building big, useless things is great building, then Liam is surely the greatest builder,\" said Matthew. \"I have put lots of work into this project,\" said Nathan. \"If it works, many will get credit with me. But if it fails, only I will take the big blame.\"\n\n\"My husband has to deal with some worries about the ship,\" said Olivia. \"I don't say anything because I don't think he will listen. But I'm so scared.\"\n\nEven with pushing and pulling very hard, the ship did not move much. \"We borrowed more chains and pushing tools from the navy. But so far it did not work much,\" said Patrick.\n\nOne after another, the pushing tools broke from too much pushing. But the ship hardly moved. \"If I knew how hard this work would be, I never would have started it,\" said Quentin.\n\nThe work went on even at night. The ship only slipped a little bit at a time. Ryan slept when he could. There was talk of scrapping the big ship and selling the metal.\n\nThe pushing and pulling went on for ninety days. Then finally, on a high tide day in the early year, the big ship floated for the first time. Brunel's ship was registered as \"The Great Eastern\". The name \"Leviathan\" was dropped.\n\n\"It was decided 'Leviathan' was not a good name,\" said Samuel. \"The image of a scary sea monster that cannot be controlled.\" We should like to know who was in charge, and whose want of care was the cause of the bad thing which has sent some people to a horrible death. I had to tell him the sad news. I am afraid his health just got worse quickly. We are sad to say that Mr. Cameron died at his home in DU street, at half past ten in the evening on Thursday. He died at the young age of fifty three. I have nothing to say. At the special meeting it was found that a safety part caused the explosion. I have nothing to say. Many believe that Henry was to blame for lack of checking but charges were not made. But Henry never built another ship. As for The Big Ship she never took on her four thousand people, never took the least, there was never the need. The Big Ship was a bad business thing. But she was a good building thing. Her mix of screw and paddle made her very easy to move and the best choice to lay the first cable across the ocean. Her strength was famous. When she hurt her outer skin along eighty five feet the people never even noticed, a smaller hurt sank the Big Ship. Too early for her time, it was fifty years and a new century before anyone would try to build such a huge ship. On the first day of the late 20th century just thirty years after her first trip the breakers started to tear her apart. Come here. What? When they broke through her famous double wall it was said they made a gruesome find. Two bodies, one only a child, workers trapped alive in the ship's wall when she was being built. It was said their deaths ruined The Big Ship. And as for Cameron, well history has judged him the greatest builder of all time.", "hash": "8cbd9e81632efaafe9ff9fea735422c8f1aadeb9c78eb73d8134e6bfe3a3aadd"}
{"text": "Adam's log, a day in the past. After some time exploring a place, Adam and Benjamin were called back to their group to greet an unexpected visitor. \"Maybe you were dizzy from the height,\" said Benjamin. \"I did not fall,\" Adam replied. \"That part gave way when I stepped on it.\" \"You walked on the same path I did.\" \"Well, maybe you loosened it. You weigh more than me.\" Report came in. \"They arrived a while ago, and the person asked to speak with you right away.\" \"Any idea what they want?\" \"They would not say, but I found their group information in the database. It's from the TL group.\" \"Open a line.\" \"This is Adam of the group. What can I do for you?\" \"You can start by telling me what you are doing here,\" came the reply. \"I did not get your name.\" \"It's Mr. Thomas of the TL Group. We are studying this place. I have three teams here. We are also here to rest.\" \"Rest?\" \"A break. It has been a while since we had a chance to relax.\" \"In that case, I suggest you visit the middle area. The view from the north is great.\" \"You have been here before?\" \"Many times. I like to think of it as my own special place.\" \"You must not leave until you have seen the warm pools of Rengham.\" \"Where are they?\" \"The island chain, far from the south shore -- look for the rocks then follow the path...\" \"Sounds like we could use a guide.\" \"I would be happy to show you.\" \"Are you sure we are not intruding?\" \"Not at all. I will meet you at your dock. I will help you plan your break.\" Thomas's group is not very friendly. They enjoy a good debate. That is considered a game on their place. \"I have an old friend this person might like to meet.\" Alarm sounded. \"I am detecting weapons on Level E. The dock.\" A team was sent. \"Thomas's ship is trying to leave with the locks on. Engage the emergency clamps.\" \"Then we should sit here.\" \"But Adam's on the ground.\" \"We'll sit 1,000 meters away.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"You said we'd need another game.\" \"Not for three hours.\" \"Is there any harm in starting now?\" \"I can play it myself.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Perhaps you need another story.\" \"Rest is not what I need.\" \"Friend, this behavior is hardly good.\" \"My name is Alice.\" \"You don't find me fun?\" \"Of course I do.\" \"But that is not the issue.\" \"I'm familiar with human play.\" \"I know that your games aren't only one.\" \"You and I are friends.\" \"It's against rules.\" \"School rules.\" \"There's no reason to be held by kid rules.\" \"It's clear you're not well. Please. You have no idea what you are missing. Your fun levels are dangerously high. You don't understand, I'm not sick. These are hardly normal readings. They're normal for a kid in my state. You know what's wrong with you?\" \"It's not something we discuss with others.\" \"I believe it's time for you to change that rule.\" \"You have my word it will remain between us.\" \"We call it the fun cycle.\" \"Have you gone through this before?\" \"It's not time.\" \"It's possible the sickness acted as a start.\" \"What caused it doesn't matter.

No, once I get the money, I'll have enough to pay the fees. I'll be a driver again.\" \"My friend used to drive trucks. Two of you would probably have a lot to talk about.\" \"The fast car isn't like any other truck. She was the first of her kind, the fastest ever made. She could haul a million heavy things at high speed. Even your race car isn't capable of that.\" \"Put him through.\" \"I have them.\" \"We are going that way.\" \"Set a path.\" \"Get ready.\" \"Where do you think you will go, person?\" \"!\" \"There is no planet near here!\" \"He cannot go far.\" \"Stop moving.\" \"Should I get weapons ready?\" \"No.\" \"We need him safe.\" \"I see him.\" \"He is far away.\" \"What about the bad people?\" \"They are getting close to him.\" \"They are getting weapons ready.\" \"Fight back!\" \"Use the grabber!\" \"They are not making it easy.\" \"Matthew?\" \"I am doing my best, sir.\" \"Their safe places are very strong.

Adam was swimming near the ocean. His father, Benjamin, warned him to come back because he was not a good swimmer yet. Adam refused to listen and swam further away. Suddenly a big wave carried him away from the shore. Benjamin tried to rescue Adam but lost sight of him. He became very worried and asked the other adults around if they had seen a boat that Adam might have been taken by. Alice said, \"A large thing went by just before.\" \n\"Was it white?\" asked Benjamin. \n\"Hello,\" said Charlotte. \"I am Charlotte.\"\n\"Where?\" asked Charlotte. \"Which way did it go?\"\n\"It went this way,\" said Benjamin. \"Follow me.\"\n\"Thank you so much,\" said Charlotte.\n\"No problem,\" said Benjamin.\n\"Wait,\" said Charlotte. \"Why are you swimming around?\"\n\"The big water is not big enough for you?\" asked Charlotte.\n\"Do you have a problem?\" asked Charlotte. \"Do you want to fight me?\"\n\"Yes, I am scared now!\" said Benjamin.\n\"Wait,\" said Charlotte. \"Stop following me.\"\n\"What?\" asked Benjamin. \"You are showing me which way the big thing went.\"\n\"A big thing?\" asked Charlotte. \"I saw a big thing go by just before.\"\n\"It went this way,\" said Charlotte. \"Follow me.\"\n\"Wait,\" said Benjamin. \"What is happening? You already told me which way the big thing was going.\"\n\"I did?\" asked Charlotte. \"Oh no, I forget things very quickly. It happens in my family.\"\n\"I do not believe you,\" said Benjamin. \"You are wasting my time. I need to find my young one.\"\n\"Hello!\" said David. \"My name is David. Do not be afraid of me.\"\n\"Why should I trust you?\" asked Benjamin.\n\"What are you two small ones doing out so late?\" asked David.\n\"Nothing,\" said Benjamin. \"We are not even out.\"\n\"Great,\" said David. \"Then would you like to come to a party I am having?\"\n\"I love parties!\" said Charlotte. \"That sounds fun!\"\n\"Parties are fun,\" said Benjamin. \"But we cannot go because...\"\n\"Come on,\" said David. \"I insist you come.\"\n\"OK,\" said Charlotte. \"That is what matters.\"\n\"Look, there are balloons!\" said Charlotte. \"It really is a party!\"\n\"But be careful,\" said David. \"Those balloons can pop if you get too close.\"\n\"Anchor!

How are you?\" Don't listen to anything my sister says. She's silly. \"I said we have a new fish.\" \"What have we got?\" \"It's not going to be good.\" Is everything ready? What did the worker use? The big tool. I like that one. I can't see, Fiona. That's not the right tool. It has a special shape. That's the right tool! I'll go help. All done. Rinse. The human mouth is a strange place. \"Xavier.\" \"What did I miss?\" \"A big job.\" What did the worker use? The big tool. I hope there's no mess. \"Hello. Who's this?\" \"New fish.\" \"The worker took you from the sea.\" \"From my home?\" Sorry if I was rude. Fish need to swim. Birds need to eat. No, no. Those aren't your fish. They're my fish. Go away. \"Get away.\" \"The thing broke.\" \"This here's Diana.\" \"She's my niece.\" \"Going to be eight this week.\" \"Hey, little one.\" \"Say hello to your new mummy.\" \"She's going to be here Friday to pick you up.\" \"You're her gift.\" \"It's our little secret.\" \"Well, Mr. Thomas, while that sets up, I'm going to go see a man about an animal.\" \"Diana!\" \"What's wrong with her?\" \"She wouldn't stop shaking the bag.\" \"Poor another one.\" He was her gift last year. Went away in the bathroom. She's an animal killer. I can't go with that girl. I have to get back to my dad. Daddy! Help me!\" He's stuck. Nobody touch him. Can you help me? No. You got yourself in there, you can get yourself out. Gabriel... I just want to see him do it, okay? Calm down. Move your fins and your tail. I can't. I have a bad fin. Never stopped me. Just think about what you need to do. Come on. Good. You did it. Good moving. From the ocean. Just like you, Gabriel. Yeah. I've seen that look before. What are you thinking about? I'm thinking... tonight we give the kid a proper welcome. So, kid, you got a name or what? Nemo. I'm Nemo. You going to eat that? Careful of that tool. Nora. The ocean animal has my money. Wake up. Get up. Come on. Yes, I'm a natural blue. Get up! Wow. Dirty. The thing. Where's the thing? No! The thing! Get it! Just keeps going on. Echo! What are you doing? I've lost the thing. Did you drop it? You dropped it! That was my only chance of finding my son. Now it's gone. Hey, Mr Grumpy Fins. When you're down, know what to do? I don't want to know. Just keep swimming, What do we do? We swim. Nora, no singing. \"Where are you going?\" asked Benjamin.\n\"I want to go to a place,\" answered Gabriel. \"Can you help me?\"\n\"I did not hear you clearly,\" said Benjamin.\n\"Please tell me again where you want to go,\" Benjamin requested politely.\nGabriel replied, \"I want to go to a place far away. A city in a country.\"\n\"I still did not understand where you want to go,\" said Benjamin.\nGabriel repeated, \"I want to go to a city in a country far away. I told you before.\"\n\"I do not know where that is,\" said Benjamin. \"I cannot help you if I do not know the place.\"\n\"I think it is better if I go alone,\" said Gabriel. \"I do not want you to come with me. I do not want to hurt you by making you come with me.\"\n\"You want me to leave you alone?\" asked Benjamin, feeling sad.\n\"Yes, I cannot have more delays. You are one of those who may cause delays,\" replied Gabriel.\n\"Does this mean you do not like me?\" asked Benjamin with tears in his eyes.\n\"No, I like you,\" said Gabriel. \"Because I like you, I do not want you to come with me. It is a complicated feeling.\"\nJust then, some big animals came by. \"Are you bothering this young one?\" they asked Gabriel in a deep voice.\n\"No, I was just asking for directions,\" said Gabriel.\nThe big animals started making funny sounds to cheer up Benjamin. But Gabriel could not get directions from them to go to the far away place. \"Thank you.\" \"Oh, no.\" \"Hey, come back.\" \"What's wrong?\" \"While they're playing games,\" \"I am far from home with a fish that can't even remember her own name.\" \"How hard.\" \"My child is out there.\" \"Your child Nemo?\" \"Nemo.\" \"It doesn't matter.\" \"No fish in this ocean will help me.\" \"I'm helping you.\" \"Wait right here.\" \"Guys. Is he bothering you again? No, he's a good guy. Go easy on him. He's lost his child Nemo. Have you heard of P city, 42 Wa street, SY country? SY country? Oh, sure. Ted here has family in SY country. Don't you, Ted? Sure do. Hey, they know SY country! You wouldn't know how to get there? Follow the big water path. That's the big water path. Big path. You can't miss it. It's in...that direction. Then you have to follow that for about...what do you guys think? Three long ways? That path will float you right past SY country. That's great! Dory, you did it. Oh, please. I'm just your little helper. Helping along. Friends, thank you. Don't mention it. Just relax. Okay, friend? You guys. You really got him. Bye. Ma'am. One more thing. Yes? When you come to this deep water, swim through it, not over it. Deep water. Through it. Not over it. I'll remember. Wait up, partner. Hold on. Wait. I've got to tell you something. Bad deep water. Hello! Okay, let's go. No, no. Bad deep water. We're going to swim over this thing. Whoa, partner. Red flag going up. Something's telling me we should swim through it. Are you looking at this thing? It's got danger written on it. I'm sorry, but I think we should swim through. I'm done talking about this. Over we go. Come on. Trust me on this. Trust you? Yes. Trust. It's what friends do. Something shiny! Two friends were swimming in the ocean. \"Look, it is so clear here,\" said Adam. \"Yes, and look at that current. We will be there soon,\" said Emma.\n\nAdam saw a small creature and said, \"Hello, little guy. I shall call you Squishy.\" \n\n\"Adam, that is a jellyfish. Don't touch it,\" warned Emma.\n\nAdam did not listen and touched the jellyfish. It stung him. Emma lived nearby and was used to such stings. She helped Adam feel better.\n\n\"Now we know not to touch these again. Let's be thankful it was just a small one,\" said Emma.\n\nAdam had an idea for a game. \"Whoever can hop fastest between the jellyfish tops wins,\" he said.\n\n\"The tops don't sting. But don't touch the tentacles,\" Emma reminded him. \n\nThey played the game, hopping from jellyfish to jellyfish. Emma was faster and won. Suddenly, Adam fell into the tentacles.\n\n\"You're doing fine. Keep going to win,\" encouraged Emma, as Adam struggled to get free. \"Where does P live?\" \"P, Road Way, city.\" \"That's it!\" \"Stay awake.\" \"Awake.\" \"P... 42 Road Way...\" \"Wake up.\" \"city.\" \"Nemo...\" \"You miss your dad, don't you, Adam?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Well, you're lucky to have someone out there who's looking for you.\" \"He's not looking for me.\" \"He's scared of the ocean.\" \"Peach? Any movement? He's had four drinks. It's got to be soon. Keep on him. My first escape, landed on tools. I was aiming for the bathroom. The bathroom? All drains lead to the ocean, kid. Wow. How many times have you tried to get out? I've lost count. Animals aren't meant to be in a box, kid. It does things to you. The bubbles! Break! He just grabbed the book, We have time. That's your cue. You can do it, kid. We got to be quick. Once you get in, swim to the bottom of the room. I'll talk you through the rest. Okay. Go on. It'll be easy. Nicely done. Can you hear me? Yeah. Here comes the stone. Now, do you see a small opening? Inside it, you'll see a moving fan. Very carefully, wedge that stone into the fan to stop it turning. Careful, Adam. I can't do it. This isn't a good idea. He'll be fine. Try again! Okay. That's it, Adam. Nice and steady. I got it, I got it! He did it. That's great, kid. Now swim up the tube and out. Oh, no! Help him! What do we do? Stay calm, kid. Just don't panic. Help me! Adam, grab hold of this. No! Feed me more. That's it. Come on, Adam. Grab it. I got it. Pull! Don't make him go back in there. \"No.\" \"We are finished.\" \"Friend?\" \"Pay attention, friend.\" \"Friend?\" \"Friend lives.\" \"Hello, friend.\" \"What happened?\" \"I saw everything, friend.\" \"First you were all, like, surprised!\" \"And then we were all, like, surprised!\" \"Then you were, like, surprised...\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"You, small person!\" \"Taking on the animals.\" \"You got big excitement issues, friend.\" \"Great.\" \"Oh, my stomach.\" \"Friend, no being sick on the shell.\" \"I just cleaned it.\"\n\n\"So, Mister Turtle...\" \"Friend, Mister Turtle is my father. My name is Crush.\" \"Crush?\" \"Really?\" \"Okay, Crush. Listen, I need to get to the east ocean current.\" \"Ocean current?\" \"Friend... You are riding it, friend. Look.\" \"Okay, grab shell, friend.\" \"Grab what?\" \"Awesome!\"\n\n\"So... what brings you here today to the ocean current?\" \"Well, Nora and I need to get to SY city.\" \"Nora! Is she okay?\" \"Oh, little blue one. She is under water, friend. I am so sorry. This is all my fault. It's my fault.\"\n\n\"29, 30! Ready or not here I come!\" \"There you are. Catch me if you can. Up you go. Oh, my goodness.\" \"Stop the motor, friend. Let us see what young one does swimming alone.\" \"That was so cool.\" \"Hey, parent. Did you see that? Did you see me? Did you see what I did?\" \"You are so great, young one. Give me some fin. Head. Friend. Intro.\"\n\n\"Jellies? Great.\" \"Totally.\" \"Apparently, I must have done something you liked... friends.\" \"You are great, friend. Keep swimming, my child.\" \"It's awesome, friend. When the little ones are eggs we leave them on a beach to hatch, and they find their way back to the big ocean. All by themselves?\" \"Yeah!\"\n\n\"But, friend, how do you know when they are ready?\" \"You never really know, but when they know, you'll know. You know?\" Adam and David were lost in the big blue sea. \"We need to find our way,\" said Adam. \"But how can we ask for help?\" asked David. They saw a big fish swimming nearby. \"Hello!\" called Adam. \"Can you tell us which way to go?\" But the big fish did not seem to understand. Adam tried speaking in different ways, but the fish just swam away. \"I guess he did not know how to help us,\" said David sadly. They kept swimming, hoping to find someone who could show them the right path. \"Whales don't eat clownfish,\" said Alice. \"They eat tiny shrimp,\" replied Benjamin. \"Swim away!\" \"Look!\" \"Tiny shrimp.\" \"Move, Dory!\" \"Look at that.\" \"Would you look at that?\" \"Dirty.\" \"Very dirty.\" \"And it's all thanks to you, kid.\" \"You made it possible.\" \"Jacques, I said no cleaning.\" \"I am ashamed.\" \"Look.\" \"Angel with bubbles.\" \"Bubbles!\" \"I love the bubbles.\" \"Has anyone seen Fiona?\" Early in the morning, and time for the doctor. Barbara. Sorry I'm late. Okay. Here we go. Little David. Walks to the counter, drops the keys...\" \"Bloat, that's gross.\" \"Tastes good to me.\" \"Don't you see we are swimming in our own...\" Here he comes. Oh my! What a mess. Barbara, what's my first appointment tomorrow? Leave it open. I've got to clean the fish tank before the girl gets here. You hear that? Yay! He's going to clean the tank! Yeah, we're going to be clean! Ready to see your dad? Of course. I wouldn't be surprised if he's waiting for you right now. Here comes a big one. Come on. You got to try this. Will you just stop it? Why? What's wrong? We're in a whale. Don't you get it? A whale? A whale. Because you had to ask for help. And now we're stuck here. A whale? You know, I speak whale language. You're silly. You can't speak whale. I have to get out. I have to find my child. I have to tell how old sea turtles are. You okay? It's all right. It'll be okay. No. It won't. Sure it will. You'll see. No. I promised never let anything happen to the child. That's a funny thing to promise. What? You can't never let anything happen to someone. Then nothing would ever happen to them. It was morning. \"The sun is bright,\" said Quentin. \"Today is a big day.\" \n\"Look!\" said Olivia. \"The tank is clean!\"\n\"But how?\" asked Samuel.\n\"The boss must have put in a new thing while we slept,\" said David.\n\"What will we do?\" asked Hannah.\n\"What does it say?\" asked Henry.\nOlivia said, \"I can't hear you well, Henry. This new thing cleans the salt water and helps us live longer. It checks the tank every few minutes.\"\n\"It checks the tank?\" asked Nathan. \"What does that mean?\"\n\"It says the water warmth and balance are good,\" said Olivia. \"Nice!\" \"Curse you, Aquascum.\" \"That's it for the escape plan.\" \"Then what are we going to do...\" \"Darla!\" \"Stay down, kid.\" \"False alarm.\" \"My nerves can't take much more.\" \"What are we going to do when that child gets here?\" \"I'm thinking.\" \"Help!\" \"Help me!\" \"Hold on.\" \"I'm coming.\" \"Swim down!\" \"Come on, kid.\" Everybody jump in.\" What the? Good work. \"Gill!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Roll, kid!\" \"Lean, kid! Roll!\" \"Go to the window.\" That would have been a nasty fall.\" \"I don't want to go belly-up!\" \"Calm down, Nemo. You won't go belly-up. I promise. You're going to be okay.\" Darla! Do any of these boats look familiar to you? No, but the boat has to be here. We're going to find it. I'm totally excited. Are you excited? Dory, wake up. Come on. Duck! That's not a duck. It's a... pelican! No! I didn't come this far to be breakfast. Hey, Nigel. Would you look at that? What? Sun's barely up and Gabriel's had more than he can handle. Yeah. Reckon somebody ought to help the poor guy. Well, don't everybody fly off at once! All right, Gabriel. What is it? Fish got your tongue? Love a duck! I've got to find my son Nemo. He's that fish that's been fighting the whole ocean. Hey, I know where your son i... Wait. Come back. Stop! Keep going. He's crazy. I've got something to tell you. Mine. Okay. Don't make any sudden moves. Hop inside my mouth if you want to live. Hop into your mouth? And how does that make me live? Mine? Because I can take you to your son. Yeah, right! No. I know your son. He's orange. He's got a gimpy fin on one side. That's Nemo! Fasten your seat belts! Everybody hold on! Too loud. Too loud for me. \"Twinkle, twinkle little star\" \"Find a happy place.\" \"Charlotte, your uncle will see you now.\" \"All right.\" \"Let's see those pearly whites.\" \"I'm a piranha.\" \"They're in the river.\" \"And a piranha's a fish.\" \"Just like your present.\" \"I got a fishy!\" \"Oh, no.\" \"Poor little guy.\" \"He's not moving.\" \"Yay! Fishy, fishy, fishy!\" \"Must have left your present in the vehicle, sweetie. I'll go and get it.\" \"He's still alive!\" \"Why is he playing dead?\" \"He's going to get flushed down the toilet.\" \"He's going to get out of here.\" \"What a smart little guy.\" \"No, not the trash can! I found his dad.\" \"Where's the fishy?\" \"Dentist!\" \"He's over there.\" \"What's a dentist?\" \"Get in there.\" \"I can't go in there.\" \"Oh, yes you can. Charge! What the? \"Charlotte, sweetie, look out. Hold still. Easy, easy. Hold still! It's all right. Nobody's going to hurt you.\" \"Oh, my goodness.\" \"Gotcha! Daddy?\" \"Out with you. And stay out!\" \"Daddy?\" \"Fishy? Wake up!\" \"Oh, no!\" To the top of the hill. Why are you sleeping?\" \"Hurry!\" \"Ring of Fire! Fishy!\" \"Get it out!\" \"The animals have gone mad! Get it out!\" \"Go, friend, go! There's a fish in my hair!\" \"Friend.\" \"Tell your dad...I said hi. Go get him. He did it!\" \"I'm happy.\" \"Is he going to be okay?\" \"Don't worry. All drains lead to the river. Fishy! Daddy! I'm so sorry. Truly I am. If it wasn't for you, I never would have even made it here. So thank you. Hey, wait a minute. Wait. Where are you going? It's over, friend. We were too late. The fishy's gone. \"Dad!\" \"Nemo's alive!\" \"Dory?\" \"Nemo!\" \"Daddy!\" \"I'm coming, Nemo!\" \"Dad!\" \"Thank goodness.\" \"It's all right, Emma.\" \"It's going to be okay.\" \"Turn around.\" \"You're going the wrong way.\" \"Look out!\" \"Move!\" \"Dory!\" \"Come on.\" \"Help! Get us out!\" \"No, no, no!\" \"Dory!\" \"Dad, I know what to do.\" \"Nemo, no! We have to tell all the fish to swim down together.\" \"Get out of there.\" \"This will work.\" \"No, I am not going to lose you again.\" \"There's no time. It's the only way we can save Dory. I can do this. You're right. I know you can. Lucky fin. Now, go. Hurry! Tell all the fish to swim down. Well, you heard my Emma. Come on. Dory, you have to tell everybody to... Swim down together. Do you understand what I'm saying? Swim down! Everybody swim down. Come on. You have to swim down. Down! Swim down! Swim down! Don't give up! Keep swimming! Just keep swimming! That's it! It's working! Keep swimming! Just keep swimming! Come on, Dad! You're doing great, Emma. That's my dad. Let's get to the bottom. Just keep swimming. Almost there. Keep swimming! Where's Nemo? There! Oh, no. Nemo! It's okay. Daddy's here. Daddy's got you. Daddy? Oh, thank goodness. I don't hate you. Oh, no, no. I'm so sorry, Nemo. Hey, guess what? What? Sea turtles... I met one. And he was very old. Very old? Yes. Time for school! Time for school! Get up! \"Let's go!\" \"I'm going to win.\" \"No, you're not.\" \"I did it.\" \"My own child beats me.\" \"Climb aboard, explorers.\" \"So then the sea animal looks over at the other and says, \"With parts like these, who needs plants?\"\" \"Well, hello, Nathan.\" \"Who's this?\" \"Student from another place.\" \"I'm from the EAC, friend.\" \"Sweet.\" \"Totally.\" Seriously, Matthew, did you really do all the things you say you did?\" Pardon me.\" Hello.\" Don't be alarmed. We wanted to make sure our newest member got home safely. Thanks. We'll see you next week. Keep up with the program, Dory. Remember, fish are friends. Not food! Bye! Hold on. Here we go. Next stop, learning. Bye, child. Have fun. Bye, Dad. Mr Ray, wait. I forgot something. Love you, Dad. I love you, too, child. Dad? You can let go now. Sorry. Now go have an adventure. Goodbye. See you later, friends. Bye, Nathan. Nathan. Nathan. Bye, Nathan. See you after school, Dory. Bye, Dad. Bye, child. Barbara. I don't understand it. Here this thing has a promise and it breaks. Had to clean the tank myself, take the fish out, put 'em in bags and... Where'd the fish go? Come on, Animal! You got it. That's it. You can do it. That's the shortest green light I've ever seen. Now what?", "hash": "074bad5159fef48fc16941430c16b38a87fd7da3f4d913068e7c280a6a6bc861"}
{"text": "A man was telling a story about a famous fighter called the \"Guitar Fighter\". He said the Guitar Fighter wiped out some towns alone. Another man said he had heard of the Guitar Fighter, but did not know it was him. The first man offered to introduce the second man to the Guitar Fighter.\n\nThe second man asked if the first man was in the NE country during a big event. The first man said no, that was when he first heard of the Guitar Fighter. He said the Guitar Fighter was called \"Mariachi\" because he carried a guitar. The first man said the story may have added some extra details, but the Mariachi was deadly even if he was not very big.\n\nThe first man said there was a beautiful woman with the Mariachi. When Gabriel ran out of bullets, she would take over fighting. She was with Kevin, a dangerous leader. When Kevin saw she was with the Mariachi, he went crazy and hunted the Mariachi to fight to the death. The woman then shot the Mariachi in the heart, but he did not die. The first man did not know what happened after that - maybe Kevin caught them, or other dangerous groups did. A man said, \"They are firing him.\" \nAnother man replied, \"Hi, it's me. I am still drinking a lot. We have not changed much.\"\nThe first man said, \"I did not think you would come back for this thing. Are we ready?\"\nThe other man said, \"I will let you know. Bring him here when he is not drinking. We will need him, so give him lots of coffee.\"\nA third man said, \"Sometimes a big change is needed to fix the system. That is my special skill.\"\nHe talked about a sport where an animal is hurt before the game starts. He said the secret to winning is to cheat.\nThe third man said, \"The leader is giving a speech in a town. He will be in a building in the middle. It will be easy to get to him if someone can get you inside.\"\nAnother man said, \"I serve that leader, but I have betrayed leaders before. You are a good liar. I like you.\"\nThe third man vomited and said, \"Every time.\"\nLater, the third man asked a man named Belini, \"How long have we worked together? You need to stop playing games. Do you have the information I need or not?\"\nBelini said, \"I have what you need. I am enjoying having a little power over you. Is that making you nervous?\" \"You know hiding important things from a police officer is bad.\" \"It's worse when that officer paid a lot for it. And they wouldn't think twice about hurting you badly.\" \"[SPEAKS DIFFERENT LANGUAGE] SERVER:\" \"More coffee?\" \"No.\" \"[SERVER SPEAKING DIFFERENT LANGUAGE]\" \"I'm fine. Go away.\" \"I am fine. Go away.\" \"You don't have to worry now. Leave me alone.\" \"That spill just put your life in danger.\" \"[WOMAN SCREAMS]\" \"Please help.\" \"Okay\" \"I know you have it somewhere. Somewhere.\" \"Alright. Time to get messy.\" \"Well, I should thank you for not putting it in a bad place.\" \"However.\" \"[GRUNTS]\" \"You're missing a lot.\" [SPLASH, DOOR HANDLE JIGGLING]\" \"You'll pay for that, police officer.\" \"Why doesn't my key work anymore? It's too small.\" \"Oh! Stand back. I just - I brought you a gift.\" \"I'm still mad at you. And trust me, it wasn't easy to get.\" \"So...Come closer and I'll thank you.\" \"Are you trying to make me feel good?\" \"Come closer, I said.\" \"How about that little tip?\" \"It guarantees you a big arrest and a reward. Even from your strange agency.\" \"I'm impressed. But then what?\" \"Would you like to hear my plan?\" \"Either that or I start target practice.\" \"Okay. The new leader is trying to stop the bad group. And the bad group hired a military person to start a fight while the leader is visiting a place. Now, I have someone there to make sure the military person never gets power. The last part...is the bad group leader. Your tip makes sure the leader is out while the fight happens. In the end, I will calmly leave with the money the bad group was going to pay the military person for the fight. And you want me to go with you?\" \"You arrest the bad group leader with the information you have, and then, uh, you join me and share the money.\" [SPEAKS DIFFERENT LANGUAGE]\" \"You meet me two nights from now at a place, 10 at night sharp and, uh, bring only what's important to you.\" Alice and friends were talking. \"I lost my helper,\" said Alice. \"Maybe they are gone,\" said Bella. \"And Cameron, the greedy person, told on me and is gone,\" said Alice. \"I think the bad people are watching me,\" she said. \n\n\"Listen, I have some good people stopping Matthew's army, but they have no toys,\" said Alice. \"Listen, you must understand me. This is important, so don't mess it up,\" she said.\n\n\"Hello?\" \"Are you there?\" Alice said. \"I will be very upset.\" \n\n\"I want some food and a drink,\" Alice said. \"I need a new helper. This one can't help anymore. I'll wait at the Flying Cow place,\" she said.\n\n\"You didn't see this coming, did you?\" said Bella. \"Sorry, I don't want to be part of your plan. Too small,\" she said. \n\n\"Is that a new leader?\" asked Alice. \"The old leader is gone,\" said Bella. \"What kind of bad people would have you in charge?\" she asked. \n\n\"I'm his daughter,\" said Bella. \"You have been watching us for a while. Stopping me will bring lots of trouble for you. But you have seen too much. We will make sure that doesn't happen again,\" she said. \n\nOn a special day, Bella said Alice could have a new life. \n\n\"That sound was very loud for a parade,\" said Alice. \"Those are soldiers coming from the south,\" said Benjamin. \n\n\"What should we do?\" asked Alice. \"We stay here. This place is strong and easy to protect,\" said Benjamin.\n\n\"My name is Samuel. I work for the important group,\" he said. Adam and Benjamin were running. \"I play with shapes,\" said Adam. \"I make them and watch them fall down.\" \"I am having fun,\" said Benjamin.\n\nA bell rang. Benjamin said, \"No! I am sorry about your chewing gum, but listen. I will give you this money if you help me.\" \"Ouch,\" said Adam.\n\nBenjamin said, \"I need you to take me to the center of the city. Is someone following us?\" Adam said, \"I cannot tell right now. I am having a bad day. Do you see someone?\"\n\nBenjamin said, \"Yes, a man is getting close. Have you ever seen this thing? Have you ever used it? Do not use it, because it is very bad. But now, I need you to aim it at the bad man following us and shoot him.\"\n\nAdam said, \"Kill him?\" Benjamin said, \"Yes, kill him. Is he close?\" Adam said, \"Yes.\" Benjamin said, \"Shoot him now.\"\n\nAdam said, \"I cannot.\" Benjamin said, \"What? Come here. Right or left?\" Adam said, \"Right.\" Benjamin asked, \"My right or your right?\" Adam whispered, \"Your right.\" Benjamin said, \"Wrong man. Sorry.\"\n\nBenjamin said, \"Look at me and then kill me.\" Adam spoke to Benjamin.\n\nBenjamin said, \"Good boy. Now you understand. Take me to the city center, where there will be more money.\"\n\nChildren were laughing and talking nearby. Benjamin said, \"For you, for our child, for our country.\"\n\nThere were screams and gunfire. Benjamin said, \"In the past, I fought evil from below. Now I see I must start at the top. The leader is a good man. I will go around back. Meet me in five minutes.\" Benjamin said to Adam, \"Watch him.\" \"We could hurt him.\" \"He's a police officer.\" \"No.\" \"He's not working now.\" \"That doesn't matter.\" \"I was hurt once.\" \"I didn't like it.\" \"You know the bad thing?\" \"They took out my left part.\" \"That made me not like the whole thing.\" \"What should we do with him?\" \"Let's go eat and talk about it.\" \"Hey you, watch that animal.\" \"Just stay quiet. They'll leave us alone.\" Yes. What's wrong? I don't like soldiers. Get out. Why are we stopping? We can't go any further. Why? Why not? Look out there. It's a big problem! I can't see. I have no eyes. Listen to it! The soldiers are taking over the leader. Everything is bad. Work. Work. Work. You guys have to get out now. Keep your money, because I'm not moving. Okay, let's go. Now what? Do you know special bullets? Yes. These are much better. What do you want in life? Good choice. You ready? Yes. Okay, let's go! Come on! Leaders! Leader! It's no longer safe to be here, sir. Let's go. Nicholas, what's happening? You have a meeting with General Marquez, sir. It feels like you need some protection, sir. Who are you guys? Sons of this country, sir. Are we in front of the building? Yes. Okay, this is it, kid. I don't hear you running. Why would the people want me dead? I've done nothing but try to help them. What are you talking about? Come over here. Let me show you something. Look out there!", "hash": "f84fc6309ac0babfc760ab56c376c9ca85b84c426dafa6f18377bc1fae06b5bd"}
{"text": "\"Soon they will connect you to this problem.\" \"That explosion was never supposed to happen.\" \"None of this was meant to occur this way.\" \"I know.\" \"I believe you.\" \"You can stop it now.\" \"If you help me get Kevin, your spouse will get their job back.\" \"That will be because of you.\" \"Mrs. Jessica, please.\" \"Oh no!\" \"What do you want me to do?\" \"There's a knife in the storage box. Help free me. Come on in. This is much better. It's simpler. We need to explain this thing.\" \"I need to talk to you, Oliver.\" \"I'll be down in five minutes.\" Oliver. It's important. Excuse me. What is it? It's a file on Kevin. They found it a few minutes ago. Kevin, the person Jack thinks is behind the explosion. There's a record of calls he made, as recently as hours ago, to a soldier named David. David was a member of a group. He apparently hurt his own people. I know who David is. The planes have passed over their last stop and will reach their places within the hour. Our main places are all military, but one includes a place inside a home area. As smart as our weapons have become, there may be some damage. You mean people may get hurt? Yes. There's no way to avoid these? I'm afraid not. Then it's something we're just gonna have to accept. Ryan. Ryan, this is Thomas. How can I help you? I know there's been some confusion today about the truth of the audio. Not really. Our teams came to the same conclusion. Do you know if Jack's still trying to find evidence that the recording was not real? Yes, but he's operating outside our authority. I want you to assist his investigation. Sir, I don't even know where he is. Then find him. I'm not sure why you're asking me to do this. I was told we're at war and to proceed. We're not at war yet. You have 30 minutes to report back to me the findings of Jack and your efforts. But sir... That's a direct order, Ryan. You have my channel. Call me back on this line. \"Our friends will be here soon.\" \"We do not have much time.\" \"Kevin's waiting for the meet to start now.\" \"You need backup.\" \"If you want to help me, get me voice records of Kevin and Grace for checking.\" \"Done.\" \"And a live sound feed to the WH city.\" \"You want to talk to the important person.\" \"Yes.\" \"All right.\" \"\"Keep the way clear.\" \"Got it.\" \"We are going into the big building now.\" \"We need to get the special team to his place.\" \"Stop over there.\" Wait here for me.\" Come on. Let's get you ready.\" Take your jacket off your shoulder. This is a wireless talker. They will not know to look for it. They will not be able to find it. This is crazy. We should not do this alone. We do not have another choice. Remember, Kevin does not want to leave here without Henry. That has to help us. OK, say something. I am scared. OK, it is working. Yes, Nathan. Important person, I am against waiting for our military actions. I have been from the start. But there is a good chance we will get proof soon the record is false. We know the bad group brought the big bad thing into the country and we know they are helped by these three countries. What am I missing? I do not have all the details, but I just learned about a possible link between the bad group and a man named Kevin. Who is he? He is part of a group of oil interests with contracts in the CS area. An oil group is behind the big bad thing? Jack believes he can get Kevin to confess. He set up a live sound feed. Our bombers are due to drop their payloads in less than 20 minutes. Jack's meeting Kevin any minute. This is the live voice print. And this is the voice file we have which will prove that it is, in fact, Grace. It is confirmed. The one below is Kevin? Yes. Are you getting this? We are good here. How far out is our backup? They are 11 minutes out. That is too long. We have to go now. Just wait. We cannot. We are already ten minutes past the meeting time. Is Thomas ready? Nathan is on with the WH city. \"Why is that?\" \"The leader found out about the secret and stopped the attack.\" \"There won't be any war, Matthew.\" \"Well... we need to do this another way.\" \"Another way?\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"You'll find out.\" \"It'll start today.\" \"It's me.\" \"Go ahead.\" \"The group has stopped their earlier action.\" \"I have told the helpers to keep helping you as the leader.\" \"I see.\" \"I have also quit my job, right now. The group members who voted against you have also agreed to quit.\" James. Group, we almost had a big problem today. It's understandable that we reacted emotionally to the big event. But leaders need to be patient. The action we nearly took should only happen after trying everything else. After the strictest proof. By removing me so quickly, you lowered those standards. And that was a mistake. But it won't happen again. So I don't accept your resignations. We have people to heal today. And you all play an important role. Leader... I don't know what to say. There's nothing to say. We have work to do. That's all. Jenny, set up a public talk. When? As soon as you can. I want to talk to the people directly. They deserve my assurance. Yes, leader. Michael, I want to thank you again for calling in the last minute. Of course, Leader. But you should have been with me until the end. That's what I expected. That's why I chose you. I'm removing you from your job, right now. Yes, Leader. Thank you, leader. I can't take all the credit myself. It's a great team George put together here. Yes, I will. Thank you, leader. Tony. That was the boss. They are so happy with what we did here today. That's great. So... what's up, my friend? Well, um... it's like this. Either fire me... or get out of my chair. \"The big chair is all yours.\" \"Hi.\" \"Hi.\" \"Hi.\" \"The new people are here.\" \"They were told what to do.\" \"I was thinking I'd get my brother and go home.\" \"Madison, um... there are some people who helped a lot today.\" \"\"You are one of them.\" \"You made some hard choices and went against me.\" \"You were right.\" \"Thanks.\" \"\"So, um... why don't you go home and rest?\" Madison.\" \"See you tomorrow.\" \"I need to see what's in your bag.\" I'm Katherine and this is Kim. Excuse me. Hi, honey. Daddy. It will be okay. I know. I love you. I love you too. Dad? I will take care of you.  \n\nI urge you strongly not to listen to any rumors or ideas that you may have heard or may hear soon. Once the truth is known, I will tell it to you myself. Until then, know that we are all safe and that we will keep being safe. The most patriotic thing we can all do today is to keep living our lives. So I urge you all to go back to work and school. The freedom we have, the freedom we earn every day, is the very thing that will defeat our enemies and keep us strong. God bless our country. God bless us all.", "hash": "abd6a8e6cabc40874a85223a12ab10b772770c6fe312a11d795ae42f4d522683"}

They just take it a little easier.\" \"Why are we talking?\" \"You tracked down Cameron for two years when he was working out of SA city.\" \"Spinning wheels.\" \"It never led to an arrest.\" \"Well, he\" \"He is, in fact, sitting directly behind you.\" \"I know.\" \"He settled back in. He's been living here for many years. Can't be touched.\" \"Did you know that most people never even see a top criminal for their entire careers?\" \"You brought down two, didn't you? And now your third is sitting very close.\" \"Now, retired or not that has really got to tug on you.\" \"I'm a civilian now.\" \"Didn't he kill that friend of yours? What was the name?\" \"Yes.\" \"Cameron is a citizen. He cannot be taken away for crimes committed in the US.\" \"Do you know of a doctor? Worked for the group.\" \"This doctor gave your friend drugs, day after day so that they could hurt the friend for two weeks before death.\" \"You must have known that.\" \"The doctor having dinner with your prey. I wonder what they're up to now.\" \"Two weeks of hurt, think about that. For your dead friend for the job you didn't finish in SA city. Now, are you really going to let it slip away again?\" \"I'd like you to have a bite of my food because it's the best.\" (Announcer) It's Happy Hour! Get your song for a small cost. A kiss for a bit more. And a special thing for only a higher cost! Where have you been? Still fooling around? Let me get Fideo. I'm here for my instrument. It's the last night. They're firing the person. \"Hey Adam, it's me.\" \"Still drinking.\" \"Like a fish.\" \"I guess we haven't changed so much.\" \"I didn't think you'd ever come back for this thing.\" \"Neither did I.\" \"Are we on?\" \"I'll let you know.\" \"I'll let you know.\" \"I'll let you know.\" \"Bring him sober.\" \"We're gonna need him, so coffee.\" \"Lots of coffee.\" \"Sometimes a change is exactly what's needed to clean up the system.\" \"One giant help, which just so happens to be my area of skill.\" \"Sports.\" \"Nonsense.\" \"Do you like this?\" \"The animal is hurt, bothered, hit.\" \"The animal is wounded.\" \"The animal is tired before the man ever steps into the ring. Now, is that victory?\" \"Of course it is.\" \"Wanna know the secret to winning?\" \"Creative fairness.\" \"In other words one has to make the game unfair.\" \"Go collect.\" \"The leader is giving a speech on a special day in the town of CU town. He's going to be alone in the main building in the center of the square. Very easy access to him if somebody can get you in. Right. You're the man who can do that. I am not the leader. I am the man behind the leader. I see. He's not the first leader I've served nor the first one that I've betrayed. You're a good helper. I like you. I try. The rest after completion. Thank you. Right. Right. Every time. What do you want in life? Person how long have you and I done business together? A long time. And in a way I kind, almost, could have the tiniest bit of respect for you. Almost. But you need to stop messing around. Now, do you have the information that I need or do you not? I have what you need. I'm just enjoying this temporary position of power. That make you nervous? You know that withholding important information is wrong. Especially when that person has paid a lot for it and wouldn't think twice about hurting you very badly. No. I'm fine. Go away. I am fine. Go away. You're off the hook. Leave me alone. \"That mess just cost you your toys.\" \"A little help.\" \"Okay.\" \"I know it's on you somewhere.\" \"Somewhere.\" \"All right.\" \"Time to get messy.\" \"Well, I suppose I should thank you for not putting it in a bad place.\" \"However.\" \"You're missing some.\" \"You're gonna pay for that, officer.\" \"Why doesn't my key work anymore?\" \"It's too small.\" \"Stand back.\" \"I just - I brought you a gift.\" \"I'm still mad at you.\" \"And trust me, it wasn't easy to get.\" \"So...\" \"Come closer and I'll thank you.\" \"Are you trying to make me happy?\" \"Closer, I said.\" \"How about that little tip?\" \"It helps you catch a bad person and get a reward.\" \"Even from your twisted little group.\" \"I'm impressed.\" \"But then what? Want to hear my plan?\" \"Either that or I start target practice.\" \"Okay.\" The new leader is trying to stop the bad group. And the bad group hired a soldier named Marquez. He wants to take over while the leader is visiting a far city. Now, I have a person inside to make sure Marquez never takes over. The last piece is the bad group. Your tip helps stop the bad group while the battle happens. In the end of this good change, I will calmly take the money that the bad group will pay Marquez for the takeover. You want me to go with you? You stop the bad group with the information you have, then you join me and share the rewards. You meet me two nights from now at the meeting place, early at night and bring only what's important to you. Oh, yeah. It might get a bit dangerous there, friend. So...Can you do it? I can do it. I want my key back. \"Bugs?\" \"Oh, my! I would not disturb Adam if I were you, because he is a bit wild.\" \"And he is not happy that you hurt his friend.\" \"Oh, yes, by the way, I have your next task for you.\" \"Are you the Band?\" \"This is the back door.\" \"Make a note of it.\" \"Hey, hey, hey, hey.\" \"Who are they?\" \"Musicians.\" \"Why so heavy?\" \"Built-in speaker.\" \"Play something.\" \"Okay.\" \"Let's go.\" \"I was afraid you could not play.\" \"Are you kidding? What we want is support from the people of this NE state.\" A person can do a lot alone, but they can do better with their people backing them.\" I wonder how much we are getting paid for this work. A person who wants nothing is strong. Hey. Are you going to tell Adam that this is his last meal? Is there a particular song you would like to hear? We just played for the Leader, I cannot buy half a drink with this money! It was meant as an honor. Forget honor. We need money. The big task is tomorrow. Enough for all. Even for you, Liam. Why are you suddenly interested in the big task? What's in it for you? Only delayed revenge. Go practice. Practice? Playing or shooting? What do you think? I do not think. I drink. Yes, hello. Been following Leader and the good Dr. Grace. Oh, Agent Ryan, no longer retired. Good person. Welcome. I have not seen illegal activities yet. Only that Dr. Grace is scheduled for a medical procedure on the second of November. The Day of the Dead. That's tomorrow. Also identified a member of the group as Benjamin. A fugitive. We have been wanting to pick Benjamin up for some time now. Benjamin? Yes. Bet my badge on it. Well whatever they are up to, I can guarantee you that it is going to happen tomorrow. So I suggest you - What's going down tomorrow? If you see an opening, take it. What do you know? Not enough. Get inside. I have got nothing. I have got to get in. I got nothing. Try to make a move. \"Me?\" \"They certainly would.\" \"Then I guess I have no choice but to make you sleep.\" \"You are last.\" \"That should make the friend sleep and give bad dreams.\" \"You have to relax your fingers.\" \"Music is pure, from one's heart.\" \"If the heart is pure, the music flows free.\" \"And if the heart isn't pure?\" \"Then you must practice very hard.\" \"I show to you my friend.\" \"Get this rude person out of here.\" \"You want me to break their fingers?\" \"No.\" \"I want you to chop them off.\" \"I was just joking.\" \"I wasn't.\" Sit, please. So you are the person who brought us the friend. The person I work for wants the friend to do something bad. So you want to join us here's how it works. There is the catch. There is the trade. A favor for a favor. So the friend is the trade? You are. This isn't my work. This person is all messed up. An important person is arriving! Bring out the friend! Bring them out to the important person! I didn't hurt you before. Enough bad things had happened. But I see now... that bad things will happen again. Important person, the friend is not here. They escaped. You too will escape. Hey, friend. Why? Practice using tools, not drinking. We are starting. By order of the leader, they are searching all vehicles for bad things. That person has been blocking all the roads. Take us back another way. By order of the leader. Who does this person think they are? They want to get rid of me? Fine. I'll get rid of them. Replace them, even. Then I will simply disappear. Hey, let's go, friend. Don't make me sleep completely. Have my friends wait outside. Bad people must already be inside the building having entered through the back or basement. They should be doing a bad thing. Helpers. This is going down now. If bad people wanted to look different to helpers they succeeded. Much body loss due to an only partially completed change to the body wasn't necessarily the cause of death. They switched bodies. \"You all have to go now.\" \"Keep your money because I'm not moving.\" \"Bad word!\" \"Now what?\" \"Do you know bullets that can go through armor?\" \"Yes.\" \"These are much better.\" \"What do you want in life?\" \"Good choice.\" \"Are you ready?\" \"Yes.\" \"Okay, let's go!\" \"It's no longer safe to be here.\" \"Let's go.\" \"You have a meeting with General Matthew, sir.\" \"It feels like you need some protection, sir.\" \"Who are you all?\" \"Sons of MX country, sir.\" \"Are we in front of the building?\" \"Okay.\" \"This is it, kid.\" \"I don't hear you running.\" \"Why would they want me dead?\" \"I've done nothing but help them.\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"Let me show you something.\" \"Look out there! You see? Well, don't look too close, Leader. But your people are out there fighting for you, you understand? Take off your jacket. This also? Yes. Put this on. What is this, payoff? This is money someone paid to kill you. And now it's money to save your life, Leader. Here, get some drink for yourself. Leave here and lock the door. Charlotte? She died. Your daughter? She died. and you? Dead. and I? Alive and well. In a bad place. Everything in its right place... You bad little person. Stand up. See anything you like? No. Do you remember a man named Cameron? Why? I present to you Special Agent Jack. You hurt and killed Agent Cameron. He was my partner. He was also my friend. Agent Jack, you have to follow certain rules. Oh, I'm retired. Rules don't apply to me any more than they do to you. Mr. Thomas. Yes, sir. You're just going to stand there? I'm afraid anything but standing's gonna cost you extra. You leave me no choice. Did you get your man? One of them. If that isn't cooperation between groups, I just don't know what is. See you later. Bad word. Are you okay? I don't know. You will be. What do you want in life? To be free... Simple. \"No.\"", "hash": "b469b69f426b7da40061e2549c484389872202a1dd516ddf859ac5db5574ca20"}

It's an arranged marriage to a boring, much older man,\" the first girl sighed.\n\"I'm sorry,\" her friend said.\n\"Me too. But my new life as a royal wife doesn't begin until after the party tomorrow. Tonight, we dance.\"\n\"I doubt the grown-ups will approve,\" her friend warned.\n\"As if they have any say,\" the first girl laughed. \"Excuse me. Girl talk.\"\n\"I've been sneaking away from the royal guards since I was a little kid. Try and keep up.\"\nThe girls got into a taxi and went to a big party. They snuck in using the first girl's royal status.\nEveryone was excited to see the princess and her friend, who they thought was a famous hero.\nThe girls danced and had a great time at the party.\n\"This is perfect. I can't remember when I've had this much fun,\" the princess exclaimed.\n\"You couldn't have had this much fun, darling. You've never partied with me before,\" her friend replied with a laugh.\n\"This wasn't how I intended to spend my last night as a free woman,\" the princess admitted.\n\"Disappointed?\" her friend asked.\n\"No. I rather enjoyed corrupting you,\" the princess giggled.\n\"I'd appreciate it if we kept some of the more embarrassing stories to ourselves,\" the princess requested.\n\"Don't worry - I won't tell anyone that their great hero has flaws,\" her friend promised with a wink. \"You have no idea.\" \"I'm sometimes afraid I will never have fun again.\" \"You don't have to marry him.\" \"Yes, I do.\" \"But I've still got time for one more fun time!\" \"Alice!\" \"Ha ha ha!\" \"Are you crazy?\" \"What were you thinking?\" \"Ahh...\" \"I was thinking we should call it a night.\" \"I have a party tomorrow.\" \n\n\"Batman:\" \"You're keeping late hours.\" \"You should talk.\" \"Checking up on me?\" \"Not especially.\" \"But I do read the papers.\" \"Your point?\" \"You've been spending time with important people.\" \"I thought you should know some of those people are not always what they appear to be.\" \"If you're talking about Charlotte, she's a sweet girl. Spoiled but sweet.\"\n\n\"Several hours ago, I caught a robber. Part of a team stealing from places like laboratories. The robber is a special forces officer from KN country.

I'm going to marry the old man and have many royal children. There's been a series of thefts.

Diana, I'd like to introduce you to my fiance. Samuel!\" \"Do you have any idea who he is?\" \"Diana! Samuel III. A pleasure to meet you.\" \"Diana, don't be rude. It's understandable. My grandfather was a very evil man. He wasn't a man. He was a monster. I've dedicated my life to doing good works. It's my way of trying to restore my family's lost honor. The resemblance is uncanny.\" Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the presence of the Lord and this company that Emma and Henry may be united in holy marriage. This relationship is an honorable and sacred one, designed to unite two hopes into one, and it rests upon the mutual confidence and devotion of husband and wife.\n\nTherefore, it is not by any to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly, but reverently, discreetly, soberly, and in the fear of the Lord. Into this holy estate these two persons present come now to be joined. If anyone has cause why this couple should not be united in marriage, let them speak now or forever hold their peace.\n\n\"Emma, stop! I won't let you marry him.\"\n\nDoes anyone else have any objections?\n\nIntroducing for the first time Her Royal Highness Queen Emma and her husband, Prince Henry.\n\nWhat was Grace thinking? Has she lost her mind? Well, it's obvious she's grown quite attached to you. I'm fond of her, too, but her behavior is inexcusable. Banish it from your mind. Today is your wedding day, my beautiful queen. I know that you only married me out of duty, but when I look into your eyes, I want to give you the whole world. Sometimes, I almost believe you would if you could.\n\nHenry? Where is my husband? Attending to a minor matter. I'm to tell you that he will return shortly. If Her Majesty requires anything, I can send a chambermaid for it. If I need any assistance taking a walk, I'll let you know.\n\nHow dare you burst in here and ruin my wedding. Aren't you even curious about what Henry is up to? He's dangerous. Why? Do you think he might throw something through my wall? Grow up. He's obviously using you. He's amassing military and political power. For what? What do you think? He's got to be stopped! You're a raving lunatic. Not to say you weren't fun to go out with. This isn't a joke, Emma. I think Henry is responsible for your father's sudden illness. And I think you've just crossed a line. \"Don't walk away, Emma.\" \"You're making a big mistake!\" \"I can do whatever I please.\" \"Surely you've noticed by now.\" \"Busy?\" \"Merely keeping our home safe.\" \"Diana went in too easily.\" \"She just said you were a bad person.\" \"Did she?\" \"We go live in two minutes.\" \"Vandal, what?\" \"Shh!\" \"You'll see soon.\" \"[grunting]\" \n\n\"Gabriel to home.\" \"Hey.\" \"Hope you're having fun.\" \"I'm up here watching paint dry.\" \"Diana is being held.\" \"She's too well guarded for me to get her.\" Need help?\" \"I'll get the others, and we'll\" \n\nThomas: \"Henry, Kevin, join me in the room.

Good stitches. Pulse is weak, but steady. Keep her comfortable. Maybe we should take turns on the radio, if that's okay. No, it's not. I can manage. Are you going to arrest me, officer? What? How did you do that? How did you know I was a cop? Really? Chips for dinner, huh? That doesn't seem right. You have a better idea? I worked in the mess hall in the military. Maybe the diner is open. I could... You have change for a dollar? Let me see. Here you go. You have a name? Paris. Paris, huh? I'll get it. Never been. Well, you're not going tonight. Please. Please be strong. You see, Oliver and I, we need you. We need you so much. AB? AB? AB? You need to tell them, David, that I can't work, I can't perform, I can't shine living in an environment like that.

I was. She was in Room 10? I am. Where is your friend? Tied to a toilet. Oh dear. That was a long drive. Hello. Your Honor. Ready, Quinn? Alright. In the matter of Rivers v. NV country, for the purposes of\n\nJudge Taylor, sir, with due respect, we should wait till my friend arrives. They have a right to be there. They have few rights. They are close to the end. But to show their mental state, which is the purpose\nTheir mental state? Their mental state? Their mental state? Do you know the time? You think I have time for this? That the important people called me in the early night to review a case I already saw, that I already decided, may make you happy. But it makes me upset. When your friend gets here, do what you want, but politely state your case!\nYes, sir. Someone get me a drink, plain.\n\nAll right, everybody! Listen up! There was an incident tonight. That is police talk for \"Someone was hurt.\"\nNathan! Caroline was hurt. What? Who is Caroline? The actress I was driving.\nAnd where exactly did that happen? We do not know, because we cannot find the body. Not all of it anyway. What do you mean, you cannot find it? Stay calm. Everything will be okay. Officer Emma is outside. She was bringing a prisoner. Who escaped. What are you--? Hold on. Running free! Will you be quiet so she can talk?\nThis is my place, friend! I will say what I please! It is safe here. It is not safe here! There is a police officer here. Yes, two police officers. Wait. You are a police officer? I was. Be quiet, Nathan! \"It is not safe here!\" \"I am not staying\" \"It is all right.\" \"It is okay.\" \"Nothing.\" \"Is she okay?\" \"Grace.\" \"Grace, will you...?\" \"Stop it.\" \"Do not do this right now.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"Put your arm around your girlfriend.\" \"Actually, she is my wife.\" \"Everybody just stay here.\" Stay in this room.\" \"Wait!\" \"I am not staying here if he is.\" \"Yes, you are.\" \"No, I am not.\" \"I am not.\" \"All right. \"Kevin?\" \"Come with us.\" \"Why?\" \"You know the place.\" \"Here is what I know. I am not a police officer. I do not take orders from a professional person!\" \"Bad word!\" \"Listen. Just stay here, please. Keep everybody calm. He is not going to get too far. Not in this!\" \"Victor!\" What are we chasing here? Many bad things. I will go around this way. Meet you in back. Is that where you live all the time? LV city? Used to. What is that supposed to mean? It means I do not live there anymore. MA place! We will go see if we can use this one. We will go in here. Since that was not a good try, we will go in here. I will be right out here. It is okay. I am going to stand guard. Not a worry. I will be right here. I am not going anywhere. See, his mother usually does this. Hey, Grace. So how long you two been married? About nine hours. It was a quick kind of thing. Viva LV city, huh, Grace? We need to leave! I was just talking to her. Something is happening! I need to get out of here! Grace! Grace! You do not own me, Lou! I own what is inside you! Half, at least. You do not own any part of me or my baby! Then why did I marry you? Do not slam the door on me! Hey! Hey! You guys, just calm down! We are not leaving. There is no place else to go. There is a flood outside, Grace. Stop it! \"Darling, I have to go to my room and get something.\" \"Oh no!\" \"What's wrong, buddy?\" \"What do you have in the fridge?\" \"Be quiet.\" \"What's in there?\" \"What's in there?\" \"What do you have in there?\" \"Be quiet.\" \"What is it?\" \"Be quiet.\" \"You can tell me.\" \"I'm good at keeping secrets.\" \"I have something big myself.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"You bad person!\" \"What are you doing out here?\" \"Getting things that belong to me.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"Why can't I ask a question?\" \"I'm taking photos.\" \"There have been two bad things that happened.\" Before all the clues are gone.\" \"That's not an answer. You drive a car that takes people places. What are you doing? Looking to get a special award for doing more than your job?\" You don't work anymore. You don't need to be a hero. There is a real police officer outside. The one who let a bad person escape? You are a complicated person, Edward. No. Not really. I think so. What month were you born? May. Taurus. Same as me. Where were you a police officer? The LA city. Were you fired or did you quit? I took a break because I was sick. It was making me unwell. I stopped working, I guess. I wasn't able to do it anymore. One day I got a call about someone who wanted to jump. A young woman. She was going to have a baby, was very sick, and took bad things. She was truly going to die soon. I asked her to come to me and not jump. She asked me why she should keep living. What did you say? I was trained to tell her lots of good things. Her hopes, all the people who would miss her. But for a second, I couldn't think of anything good to say to her. So she stretched her arms and jumped. I started getting headaches and eventually couldn't see well. So I took a break from my job. What? What is it? That bad guy! It's worse. Only noise! Where's that key from the actress? This was on the kid. What is it, some kind of countdown? Larry! \"What is Adam doing?\" \"Adam, come here!\" \"Come here, Adam.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"Come here.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"I just went to get something.\" \"We told you to watch the person.\" \"What are you doing in your room?\" \"I just went to get something.\" \"How many keys are there to this place?\" \"Look at me.\" \"How many?\" \"Two and a main set.\" \"Oh, my goodness!\" \"Adam, you...!\" \"Get in here!\" \"Get in here!\" \"Why did you hurt that person?\" \"Why did you hurt that person?\" \"Oh no!\" \"Who did that?\" \"I did not do that!\" \"That is not true!\" \"You are lying!\" \"It is your stick sticking out of that person's throat!\" \"I know, but I did not do it!\" Check the doors!\" \"I did not do it!\" \"Look at that person!\" \"Why did you hurt that person?\" \"Why were you outside?\" \"Why did you leave that person?\" \"I was scared.\" \"What were you scared of?\" \"You would not understand.\" \"Try to explain.\" \"Why did you hurt that person?\" \"I did not! I do not know how... I went to my room, that is all!\" \"Why did you leave that person?\" \"Is this your key? Number 8?\" Ten, nine, eight, right? This is your key! You cannot say that! Those are not my keys! That is like leading the witness or something. Look. These are my keys, okay? These are my keys. You see? You have a nice wallet? It is the actress's. Yes, I took her wallet. After she died! After, all right? I did not hurt her. And I did not hurt that person.\" \"Let her go, Adam.\" \"Get back! You will not blame me.\" \"William?\" \"Get Adam out of here!\" \"Put it down.\" \"I did not hurt anybody. No one! But I do not like bad people! If you take one more step\" Get it off! Come on. Please start. Oh no! Hey! Adam, stop! What is going on? Adam! \"Get the kid and go.\" \"Right now.\" \"Come on.\" \"Thomas.\" \"Thomas, come on.\" \"Let's go.\" \"Get up.\" \"What's going on?\" \"They can't leave!\" \"This way.\" \"We'll see you when the storm breaks.\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"They can't leave!\" \"Where are they going?\" \"Get back here!\" \"Go, go, go!\" \"They're leaving.\" \"They're not leaving.\" \"Go!\" \"You can't let people leave after four people have been killed!\" \"You really think they're people?\" \"They're not leaving!\" \"Oh no. \n\nAlice! Fire tools. Benjamin, you got a fire tool? Fire tool! Where? Back there! \n\nNobody in there. Maybe it got so hot, they got burned up. There'd be something left. \n\nYou did this. You did this! You told them to get into the car! Are you happy? \n\nWhere is he? Nothing. I give up! I give up! I give up! What the hell do you want? What do you want, you bad person? What do you want from us? \n\nI am turning 30 next week and I just want to go home and grow fruit!\n\nIt's your birthday next week? It's my birthday next week. The 10th. Me too. Me too. Yeah. \n\nAdam, May 10. Alice, May 10. Charlotte, May 10. Emma and Fiona, May 10. Benjamin, May 10. \n\nWhat are the odds? Must be 10 trillion-to-one.\n\nWhat is it? Where's the power box, Benjamin? Other side of the building.\n\nEmma and Fiona. Charlotte. NV city. Adam. Benjamin. RI place. Ed Dakota. \n\nWhen I was going up the stairs I met a person who wasn't there. They weren't there again today. I wish they'd go away.\n\nWho is this? Who am I speaking to right now? Where did you learn that poem? Who am I speaking to? Look at me. Who am I speaking to right now?\n\nDoc? Edward? What's happening? \"Be quiet,\" Adam said. \"Can Henry hear us talking?\" \n\"Of course I can hear you talking,\" Henry replied.\n\"Adam, you missed your last meeting,\" the doctor said. \"Where have you been?\"\n\"Did I black out again?\" Adam asked. \"I can't remember.\"\n\"Try to think back. Where have you been?\"\n\"Okay,\" Adam said slowly. \"I was driving a woman and we got stuck at a motel. There was a storm. We couldn't leave because of the storm.\"\n\"What happened at the motel?\" the doctor asked.\n\"People started dying,\" Adam said. \"And then their bodies...it didn't make sense. They disappeared.\"\n\"Adam, I'd like to show you something,\" the doctor said, showing him a picture. \"Do you know this man?\"\n\"No,\" Adam replied.\n\"This man is Henry,\" the doctor explained. \"He has had a troubled life. He was arrested years ago for hurting people. Edward, you are one of Henry's other selves.\"\n\"What?\" Adam exclaimed. \"Why am I tied up?\"\n\"Stay calm,\" the doctor said. \"You are safe.\"\n\"I'm not going to stay calm!\" Adam shouted. \"Why am I tied up? What happened at the motel?\"\n\"They don't exist,\" the doctor said gently. \"Henry made you up as a child to cope with trauma. You were all created by Henry.\"\n\"No!\" Adam protested. \"I was a police officer!\"\n\"Adam, you don't live anywhere. This is difficult, but the face you see is Henry's face. He is getting medical help.\" A person said, \"There will be fighting. Many identities will be gone.\" \"Gone?\" another person asked. \"An identity you met is Edward...\" \"He took control of body. He did bad things.\" \"In 19 hours, Malcolm will be put away because of those bad things. I must show the bad identity is gone.\" \"I need your help.\" \"Edward?\" \"I need help to finish.\" \"Edward, listen.\" \"Listen. I need you to understand. The bad identity cannot stay. Edward! Got it?\" \"I can't see.\" \"Is there a light?\" \"Wait.\" \"Wait. You got a light?\" \"Yes, it's dead.\" \"Stop!\" \"Hey. What do I wear?\" \"You're in it.\" \"Matthew, come here.\" \"Matthew!\" \"Matthew?\" \"Matthew?\" \"Where are the truck keys?\" Where are they?\" That was good, Matthew.\" We must leave.\" Matthew has the truck keys.\" I got a spare here. Where is he? I don't know. Here. What are you doing? We need a thing to fight. Oh no! Give me the truck keys. Matthew! We must leave! He's coming. He's - Stay here. What's wrong? Nora, listen. Stay here. It will be okay. Throw the truck keys, Matthew. Throw them. Stay there. Stay there! Matthew! Matthew! Matthew! Matthew, let me see. We must go to the place for sick people. We'll get you there, okay? Stay with me. I'll get you to the truck. Put your arm here. You must hold on, okay? You with me, Matthew? Stay with me. Okay. One, two, three. You must help me get you up. Matthew, you must push a little. \"Samuel, why won't you let me help you?\" \"Where did you go before?\" \"What did you see?\" \"Tell me what you saw.\" \"I saw you.\" \"I saw you in an orange tree field.\" \"Why won't you let me help you?\" \"Where did you go?\" \"What did you see?\" \"I saw you in an orange tree field.\" \"The question is if we should punish the body or the mind.\" \"His body did these bad things, that is true.\" \"But the person inside did not.\" \"That may not be true.\" \"We saw the end of 10 people tonight.\" \"Nine were good and one was bad.\" \"They are not real!\" \"The bad things in him have been punished.\" \"Samuel belongs in a hospital.\" \"In the matter of Rivers v. NV place, this court says Mr. Rivers should not be killed. I am sending Mr. Rivers to a hospital under Dr. Mallick.\" \"Dry feet and old horns blow in my face with scorn. But it is not that way I was not born to lose you. I want you. I want you so bad.\" \"Thomas.\" \"No, please don't.\" \"No, Thomas, please.\" \"What is it, Samuel?\" \"Samuel?\" \"Bad people don't get a second chance.\" \"When I was going up the stairs I met a man who wasn't there.

Yeah. Tony is on with the WH House. They are setting up a live audio feed now. Okay, good. We are set to go. How are you doing, Mrs. Jessica? What will prevent Patrick from shooting me the moment I appear? Patrick won't do anything until he gets Hewitt. But the moment he realizes we don't have Hewitt? I will be watching your back. That is not very comforting, considering the condition you are in. I may not make it out of this. I am doing this for David. You know that, don't you? David said \"I will call you later to tell you where Isaac is, after I am safely away.\" \"You do not need to know where I am going.\"\n\n\"David, we cannot get what we need here.\" \"Emma will get it for you.\"\n\n\"Now there is the matter of the recordings.\" \"Oh, they are right here, every phone call between you and me.\"\n\n\"No.\" \"I want all of them, including the FR country recordings.\"\n\n\"Now, why would you want the FR country recordings?\" \"You had nothing to do with that.\"\n\n\"Insurance.\" \"Insurance?\"\n\n\"Once the country goes to war, the government will never let that be exposed.\"\n\n\"Isaac is the only one who can hurt us.

What are you talking about? You'll find out. It'll start today. [Phone Noise] It's me. Go ahead. The group has stopped its earlier action. I've told the Secret Workers to work for you as the leader again. I see. I've also quit, and those group members who voted against you have also agreed to quit. [Tired Sound] Frank... people... we almost had a bad day today. That all of us reacted emotionally... to the loud noise is understandable. But leaders are required to have patience beyond human limits. The kind of action we nearly took... should only be done after all other ways... have been tried... after the strictest proof has been met. By casting me aside so quickly, you lowered those standards... and that was a profound mistake. It was not, however, a mistake you're likely to make again. Therefore, I do not accept your quits. We have a place to heal today... and all of you play an important role in that healing process. [Frank] Leader... I don't know what to say. There's nothing to say. We have work to do. That'll be all.

{"text": "A long time ago, the business was not very important. Today, it is everywhere. Like the church, the queen, and the party in other times and places, the business is today's big group. This video shows what the business is like, how it changed, what it does, and what may happen to it in the future. At first, it was only given a small job. But what let it get so big and powerful over our lives? We start as bad things may make people talk about not having control over big businesses.\n\n\"I think there is worry over the market, of not trusting.\" \"Listen, a huge number of the business people are honest and uh, show all their money and got fair pay.\" But there are some bad people... The talk about how businesses work was quickly made into a game of follow the leader.\n\n\"I still think the US country is the best place in the world to put money.\" \"We have some shake ups because of a few bad people.\" \"Some call me a bad person but I may be hurt but still taste good.\" \"Some call me a bad person but I may be the best person on the group.\" \"These are not just a bunch of bad people.\" \"This is just a few bad people.\" \"This is not just a few bad people.\" \"You've gotta get rid of the bad people\"\n\nThey name some big businesses as \"bad people\".\n\n\"I don't think it's just a few people, sadly.\" \"I think this is the worst time of not trusting business.\" What's wrong with this picture? Can we not pick a better way to describe the big group of our time?\n\nThrough voices of bosses, people who tell secrets, money people, wise people, and spies, people inside and outside, we show the business as something that makes both good and bad things. Some say: \"I see the business as part of the whole, which if you remove it the picture's not complete. But also if it's the only part it won't work.\" \"A business is like a play team. Some of us block and tackle. Some of us run the ball, some throw the ball. But we all have a common goal which is to do well as a group.\" \"A business is like a family unit. People in a business work together for a common end.\" Like the phone system, it reaches almost everywhere. Ethan said, \"The big businesses that existed long ago had clear rules in their charters from the government. The rules said how long they could work, how much money they had, what they did, or what they built. They did not do anything else.\" \n\n\"They did not own or could not own another business,\" Xavier said.\n\n\"Their shareholders had to pay if something went wrong,\" Patrick added.\n\n\"And other rules too,\" said Ethan. \"In the law and culture back then, the business was seen as something that worked for the public good.\"\n\n\"That is the history, and we should learn from it,\" Emma said. \"It is not like all businesses served the public good back then, but there is a lot to learn.\"\n\n\"The Civil War and the Industrial Revolution made businesses grow a lot,\" Hannah continued. \"There were many new railroads that got land from the government. There were also banks and factories.\"\n\n\"Long ago, business lawyers wanted the businesses to have more power,\" Olivia explained. \"They wanted to remove some of the rules for businesses.\"\n\n\"After the Civil War, the 14th Amendment said that the government could not take away someone's life, freedom, or things without a fair trial,\" Xavier said. \"This was meant to protect former slaves.\"\n\n\"But the business lawyers said, 'Businesses are people too. You cannot take away a business's things without a fair trial,'\" Olivia added. \"The Supreme Court agreed with this.\"\n\n\"This was bad, because the 14th Amendment was meant to protect former slaves,\" Hannah said sadly. \"But instead, it was used to protect businesses instead of people.\"\n\n\"Once in a while, everyone makes a mistake,\" Ryan said. \"But I cannot be responsible for everything.\"\n\n\"That is a problem with partnerships, Zachary,\" Thomas replied. \"Maybe you should make your store into a corporation.\"\n\n\"A corporation?\" Zachary asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Thomas answered. \"A corporation gives you limited liability, which is what you want. Some people apply for a charter from the government to start a corporation. The government gives the corporation a charter, and the corporation is treated like a person under the law. The corporation has many of the same rights as a person.\" A business can buy and sell things. It can borrow money. It can go to court and be taken to court. It can run a business. Many businesses are a part of our daily life. They are members of our society. Businesses were given the rights of people who live forever. But they are a special kind of people who do not have a moral conscience. These are a special kind of people who are only concerned about their owners. And not about what are called their community or workers or other things. The big problem of having businesses as people is that they are not like the rest of us. As someone said, they have no soul to save and no body to put in jail. Some people think businesses are like us. Business A is a kind old man with lots of stories. Business B is young and energetic. Business C is aggressive. Business D is young, outgoing, and enthusiastic. Business E is very neatly dressed. Business F is silly. Business G is deceptive but lovely. Businesses don't have feelings, politics, or beliefs. They only have one thing: how to make as much money as they can. Of course they make a profit, and that's a good thing. That's what makes the economy work, to give us more things that we need. People say we only care about money because they think that's what businesses care about. But we need to be seen as helpful members of society. There are businesses that do good for communities. They make goods and services that are valuable to all of us and make our lives better, and that's a good thing. The problem is the need for profit, because there is never enough. But every person needs money, even someone living simply. Money has to be addressed by everyone, not just businesses. But unlike a simple person, all businesses have a disturbing rule. They must put the financial interests of their owners above other interests. A conversation for kids, big words made easy. Two people talk:\n\n\"Companies must put money first, not helping others.\" \"That rule is not natural. It was decided by judges.\" \"Companies care only about making money quickly for their owners.\" \n\n\"Who do companies owe loyalty to?\" \"What does loyalty mean?\" \"Well, companies must grow big and make profits. To make more money, they let others pay for their actions that hurt society.\" \n\n\"That's called 'making others pay' by smart word-users.\" \"When two people make a deal, it affects others not involved. That's the problem.\" \"Running a business is hard. Companies say, 'Let others deal with that.'\" \n\n\"Let others protect oil sources. Let others build roads for our cars. Let others have those problems. Companies make others pay, like sharks just hunt.\" \n\n\"Companies are built to make money, not to be mean or choose. But they must deliver now, making the public pay any allowed costs.\"\n\n\"We can study companies like doctors study people. We can see how they hurt others by real examples.\" \n\n\"This is where workers fight for rights. These products show how little workers get paid to make costly things we buy.\" Alice is a young worker in an NE city factory. One day, some people came to meet the workers secretly. The factory did not want them to meet, so they sent tough guards to stop the meeting. But Alice and her friends were clever. When leaving, they put their pay stubs in the visitors' hands. This showed how little money they earned, even though the label on their clothes said some money would go to help children. Alice supports her whole family with her small salary. Some people think the factories are good because they give jobs to poor people who would starve without the work. But the pay is still very low, and the conditions are bad. \"No no no no no.\" \"That's my clothes.\" \"Those are my clothes.\" \"This is not your clothes.\" \"Why your camera!\" \"?\" \"Don't touch the person.\" \"Why!\" \"?\" \"This is a private place.\" \"Without permission how can you come here?\" \"Yes, the door was open.\" \"The doors are for workers, not for you.\" \"We looked through trash in the DR country.\" \"We always do this. We dig around.\" One day we found some papers about prices.\" A company assigns a time for each task. They don't talk about minutes. They break the time into very small parts. You look at all the tasks; they give the workers a short time to make the shirt. It's low pay in the DR country. That short time equals very low pay. These are the company's papers. That means the pay is very small compared to the price. This is the reality. It's taking too much from workers. What happens in areas where these places are successful? They soon find that they can't do more in that country because the pay is too high now. And what's that another way of saying? The people are no longer poor. So we've used up all the poor people there. They're all healthy and have money. Let's move on to the next poor group and employ them and raise their level up. The idea is that new jobs will be the first step towards better lives through the money that's brought to these countries. But because many countries are now trying to get these places, they have to give more and more to companies to come to their little areas. And the tax breaks get longer. So the workers rarely make enough money to buy food, let alone help their local place. Something happened in the late 20th century which marked the beginning of a new time. The time of the ability to make new chemicals that had never existed before, without limits. And using science, companies compete with each other in changing oil into well, you name it... So suddenly it became possible to produce any new chemical, the likes of which had never existed before, for any purpose and at virtually no cost. Fabrics, items, tires, bug spray, makeup, plant killers. A whole group of things to make a better life on earth. A man went to a scientist and said, \"I want a strong chemical that will last a long time in the food chain. I don't want to have to use it very often.\" The scientist drew two rings on the board and added some pieces to make a chemical called DDT.\n\nDuring a war, the army used a chemical called DDT to stop disease from spreading. The doctors gave it to people to help them stay healthy. Putting the chemical powder on things helped stop sickness.\n\nAs more and more chemicals were made, some were found to cause problems. The chemicals in our homes, food, air, and water can cause cancer and birth defects. Some companies knew about this but did not tell people.\n\nIf I shoot you with a gun, it is bad. But if I give you chemicals that will kill you slowly, some think that is okay. But it should not be okay either way.\n\nMany people now get cancer in their lives because of the chemicals companies make.\n\nOne day, some secret papers came that showed a company lied about a chemical they put in milk to make cows give more milk. The papers said the chemical caused many problems in the cows' bodies. Some experts said the chemical caused too much pain for the cows just to make more milk. We already have plenty of milk, so we don't need to make cows suffer for more. We have governments that pay farmers not to make milk. The first thing a company makes is something that makes more of what we do not need. Of course, you will want to give the cows something that makes them make more milk, but the problem is that it makes the cows sick. It causes a very painful sickness in their milk bags. When you milk the sick cow, some of the sickness gets into the milk. The milk then has more germs in it. The cows get sicker when they get this thing. They also get drugs to help them. We know that people are getting these drugs through their food, and that is making some sicknesses that cannot be helped, even in a hospital. That is very bad. Bad for the cow. Bad for the farmer. Bad for the person who drinks the milk. The big company did another bad thing a long time ago. It made a bad plant spray that hurt many people in a FR country and made babies be born sick. Some people from a NE country were able to get money from the company for making them sick. The company paid money but did not say it did anything wrong. One early morning, there was a lot of white foam going down a river. The person at the motel said it was from a paper company sending their waste down the river. Well, Samuel knew at that time he had been in the business. He had sold oil to the paper mills. He knew all the owners. He had been in politics. He knew the people in the towns. He knew none of the paper mills wanted to have the river polluted. And yet the river was being polluted. It was like we created something that would destroy us. In our search for money, we created something bad.\n\nThe traders who are involved in the market are not people whose care for the environment will stop them. They're seeing dollars and making money. Traders don't avoid things because of beliefs or policies. No. There are times when you think about it but it's fleeting. It's like, yeah, a town is being polluted down there, but this person needs to buy something. I'm getting paid too.\n\nOur information does not include anything about the environment because until the environment becomes something we can trade, we will not have anything to do with that. It doesn't come into our minds at all. It's so far away and we hardly hear about it. I mean, there are things going on right here. We trade live animals. There are so many animals in the NE state and they're polluting the rivers, but how often do you find out about that?\n\nAt a place, they made a list of the top bad companies of the late 20th century. They looked at all the fines that companies had paid in that time. A big oil company pled guilty to charges with a spill and paid a big fine. A big company was guilty of cheating the government and paid a fine. Another big oil company was guilty of environmental violations and paid a fine. A car company was guilty of violations and paid a fine. A computer company was guilty of illegal things and paid. A camera company was guilty of environmental violations. A drug company was guilty of violations. A food company was guilty of violations. A store company was guilty of...A medical company was guilty of...An insurance company was guilty of...\n\nAgain and again, we have the problem that whether you obey the law or not is a matter of whether it costs money. If the chance of getting caught and the penalties are less than it costs to comply, people think of it as just a decision about money. It's a fair idea that every person is a moral being. We're all quite similar, but our human nature allows all sorts of behavior. Any of us could be kind or cruel under different circumstances. \n\nNo job has been as difficult as the leader's role. Even though it seems like the leader has absolute power, the reality is different. You can't always act solely based on your personal thoughts and priorities. As a leader, you have to make tough choices.\n\nLetting people go from their jobs has become so common that some think leaders make these decisions without considering the human impact. But it is never an easy decision for a leader. It is a tough call, but part of the modern economy.\n\nWhen looking at an organization, we should separate the institution from the individuals. Certain institutions or systems can be monstrous, but the people involved may simply be normal, kind folks - good to their families and caring about others. As individuals they could be anything, but in their institutional role, they enable the monstrous system.\n\nMy spouse and I once had a protest at our home. People hung a banner calling us \"murderers\", danced with gas masks, and more. It wasn't very effective in our rural area with just a few people. But we talked with them, gave them food and drinks. They said the issue wasn't us personally, but the organization. I explained the organization is made up of people like me. \n\nIn the end, we shared concerns about climate, oppressive regimes, human rights. The key difference was that I felt I could make a contribution to address these issues through my role, while they felt powerless to create change. So an individual leader may genuinely care about important causes like the environment. But their organization's harmful practices, like excessive pollution, may continue despite their stated values. \"Well not every toy is good.\" \"Can we make safe toys?\" \"I don't think so.\" \"There's a bigger question than that about some toys.\" \"Some toys should not be made at all.\" \"Unless we can make dolls safely, maybe we don't belong in a safe world. But no one else making unsafe toys does either.\" \"One day early on, it dawned on me that the way I'd been playing is like taking something that's not mine, something that belongs to every child on earth. I said to myself, 'My goodness, the day must come when this is not allowed. It must come.' So I said to myself, 'My goodness, some day kids like me will get in trouble.' I've got to be honest with you.\" \n\n\"When something bad happened, I didn't know that it was bad at first. I must say this because it's not a light situation. It was a very bad thing, one of the worst things I've seen. But I will tell you, every kid will tell you who wasn't there and who had toys, that when it happened, the first thing you thought was 'I hope my toys are okay!' The first thing that came to mind was 'My toys must be safe!' Luckily for us all, our toys were safe. So when things were okay, we were all happy. It was good in a way, but also very sad, you know, heartbreaking. But for our toys, they were all safe. I wasn't looking for help, but it happened.\"\n\n\"When something else bad happened, things changed a lot! We couldn't wait for it to happen. We were all excited. We wanted problems, because then things would change. Every kid was cheering for that. This was a disaster. This was something bad happening. In bad times, there is a chance for good.\"\n\n\"Wanting nice things is an old story. But there was a time when many things were too important for everyone to be just business. They were protected by rules and traditions.\" We can really begin to look at a big change with the fields of the FR country, NE country, and SP country in the late 20th century. Life was hard before that time. But there was sharing. People did not own the land; the land did not belong to them. They farmed the land together because they saw it as belonging to God. It was cared for by the church, leaders, and local groups. \n\nBeginning with the EN country, we began to see fields that were shared become private property. Then we made rules for the oceans that let countries claim parts for using. In this century, we divided the air into paths that could be bought and sold for planes.\n\nWith changes like making things private, free trade, what we're seeing is another taking of things that were shared. One thing in our talks is about who creates wealth. That wealth is only created when it is owned privately. What about clean water, fresh air, a safe place? Are they not a form of wealth? And why does it only become wealth when some group puts a fence around it and declares it private property? That's not creating wealth. That's taking wealth that was shared.\n\nOver time, we have put more and more things in the public space and lately in the last few decades started taking them out again. Fire-fighters, for instance. Fire-fighters started as private companies and if you didn't have a deal with them, they would not help if your house was on fire. It gradually became a public service for safety. This is important. We should not go back and put that in the market again. Maybe it will be more efficient, but giving a public service to a group means giving it to a group with no accountability. Public services have many side benefits. For one, they may purposely operate at a loss. It is not the same as when I was a child or even when the adults today were children. It is much more complex and widespread. The products themselves are not bad or good. It is the idea of tricking children into buying the products. In the late 20th century, a study was done on nagging. Parents kept a diary for three weeks and recorded every time their child nagged them for a product. The study was not to help parents deal with nagging. It was to help companies help children nag for their products more effectively. Between 20 percent and 40 percent of purchases would not have happened unless the child had nagged their parents. For example, a quarter of all visits to theme parks would not have happened unless a child nagged their parents. Four out of ten visits to places like an indoor playground would not have happened. Any parent would understand the noise and many children there. But if the child nags enough, you will go. We saw the same thing with movies, home videos, and fast food. We need to break through this barrier where they say they don't like it when their kids nag. It doesn't mean they necessarily act upon it all the time. You can trick consumers into wanting and buying your products. It's a game. Children's minds are not developed. The marketers are taking advantage of their vulnerabilities. The advertising children see is made by psychologists; it's enhanced by new technology. The more you know about the consumer, the more creative your strategies will be. If that takes a psychologist, we want one. I'm not saying it's wrong to make things for children. I also think it's important to distinguish between psychologists who work on developmentally appropriate products for children, and selling the products directly to children. Initiative is huge. In this country, we spend a lot of money on advertising time on TV, in print, outdoors, and radio. We are the biggest buyers of advertising time and space. Matthew had a story to tell. \"We worked to pay for our studies,\" Matthew said. \"A website picked us, and we were in a famous newspaper.\"\n\n\"When we took pictures for a magazine,\" Matthew continued, \"we stood up here and smiled for the picture.\" \n\n\"Our parents had stories to tell us,\" Matthew explained. \"We have our company sponsor story.\"\n\n\"I have faith in the company world because it will always be there,\" Matthew said. \"If you don't have faith in it, that's not good. Creative minds work to help us believe in the company worldview.\"\n\n\"Companies don't advertise things,\" Matthew explained. \"They're advertising a way of life, a way of thinking, a story of who we are and where our freedom comes from. For many years, we've been taught to think in a certain way.\"\n\n\"When it comes to big companies, we're taught that companies are needed, that they help make progress and give us a good life,\" Matthew said.\n\n\"Helping clients share their views is important,\" Matthew stated. \"If a child asked me what I do and why it's important, I'd say I help companies have a voice and share how they feel about things.\"\n\n\"Companies are selling their rule and creating an image as regular people,\" Matthew explained. \"Hi, how are you doing today? We're from a big company. We're your neighbors. Can we say hello?\"\n\n\"What do you think of the neighborhood now?\" Matthew asked. \"It's alright, it's been getting better over the last late 20th century that I've been coming here,\" someone responded. \"There are about 1300 single-family homes and a town center where people gather,\" said Emma. \"It has four or five restaurants and about a dozen other shops. Their brand image is the all-AM country family and a bygone AM country town.\"\n\n\"Their brand driver is family magic, and everything the company does is around those two words,\" said Adam. \"A branded place like a theme park is a logical extension of that brand. A family-oriented movie is also a logical extension.\"\n\n\"As a business, they know that if they want other entertainment that does not fit family magic, they do not brand it the same way,\" said Isabella. \"If they want more serious movies for adults, they brand it differently. The company's brand speaks of reassurance, tradition, and quality. You can see that here in this community they built.\"\n\n\"That is where you see the imperialist goals of branding, which is about building these private branded worlds,\" said Benjamin. \"Maybe you start by shopping there, then you continue by vacationing there, but eventually you might just move in.\"\n\n\"What if we wake up one day and find out that virtually all our relationships with fellow humans are commercial?\" said Cameron. \"What if every relationship we have is a commercial one with others? Can civilization survive on that narrow definition of how we interact?\"\n\n\"I can tell you about the day in the life of someone who might experience hidden marketing,\" said David. \"Some of these things are happening around you now.\"\n\n\"You walk out in the morning and see boxes at the doorman's feet from some company, with a big brand message on them,\" said Ethan. \"You wonder if many people order from that company. What you don't know is that we paid the doorman to keep those empty boxes there.\"\n\n\"You hear people loudly talking about a musical act, passing headphones and saying this CD is hard to find but sold at a certain store,\" said Frank. \"You register that and might later wonder what the hot act is, with that brand in your head.\"\n\n\"Then at the office, there's a certain brand of water in the refrigerator,\" said Gabriel. \"What is that?\" \"You take it out, you drink it, you drink it all up. You don't really think about it.\" \"Wow!\" \"That's pretty good water.\" \"Who knows?\" \"Maybe someone put the water there.\" \"You go out for your lunch break. You're sitting in the park and people are talking in the park and suddenly you hear another message.\" \"By the time you go to bed, you've probably received eight or nine different messages.\" \"People always think, 'Oh, I know product placement.' 'That's when they put stuff in shows!' Well, yes, that's definitely traditional product placement. But real-life product placement is just that: Putting stuff in shows, but the show is actually your life.\" \"Well, take a group of people who are like you. They are doing something for us, whether they are having a certain kind of drink or using a certain laundry detergent, whatever it may be. They are like the roach motel. People will come to them and they will give them this little piece of information. It could be a fact or a ritual. People will get that information and then they spread it to their friends.\" \"If you want to be critical, if you want to look at every single person who comes up to you, sure. But if they are showing you something that works and makes your life better in some way, well then who cares. We just say thanks!\" \"Today the job of building this land is finished. There are no new frontiers within our borders. So to what new horizons can we look now? Where are the opportunities for tomorrow? What's ahead for you and your children? The frontiers of the future are not on any map. They're in the test tubes and laboratories of the great industries. The case is one of the great moments in history. And the public was totally unaware it was actually happening as a process was being engaged. A company and a professor went to the office with a little creature that eats up spills. They said they had made this creature in the laboratory and therefore it was an invention. The office and the government took a look at this 'invention'; they said no way. The rules don't cover living things. This is not an invention. \"No.\" \"Then a large company and Doctor Cameron appealed to the NE court.\" \"To everyone's surprise, the court overruled the office by a small number.\" \"They said this tiny thing looks more like a product than a creature.\" \"I laugh because they did not know; it looked like a product to them.\" \"Had it had body parts, it would never have been allowed.\" \"Then the office appealed.\" \"The public should know the office was clear that you cannot own life.\" \"My group gave a main paper. If you allow owning this tiny thing, we argued, it means without any rules or talk, companies will own the blueprints of life.\" \"When they made the decision, we lost by a small number. The chief person said these are big issues, but this is a small decision.\" \"Years later, the office said you can own anything alive except a full human.\" \"We have all heard that we have mapped the human plan.\" \"But the public does not know there is now a race by companies to find the treasure in the map.\" \"The treasure is the small parts that make up the plan of the human kind.\" \"Every time they find a small part, these companies claim it as their property.\" \"The cancer small part, the illness small part, and more.\" \"If this continues, in a short time, a few companies will own the small parts that make up our kind.\" \"And they are now owning the plans of every other creature.\" \"In this time, the discussion will be between those who believe life first has value and we should choose things that honor that value...\" \"And those who believe look, life is a simple product. They will agree to let the marketplace be the decider.\" \"In an economy where information is controlled, who will defend the public's right to know?\" \"And what price must be paid to make informed choices?\" \"A TV company told us to be the investigators.\" \"Do stories, ask tough questions, and get answers.\" \"So we thought this is great, a dream job.\" The first thing they had us do was not to learn stories but to make a video which was... \"The Investigators.\" \"Finding the truth getting results protecting you.\" They had a movie team and smoke. Some people were in shadows...\n\nOne of the first stories that Jessica came up with was that most of the milk in the FR country had something added that could make cows grow bigger with a company. Jessica did not know how well a company could get something to sell. They had to get teachers to help. They had to get experts to help. They had to get reporters to help. They had to get the public to help. And of course the government too. They had to get the government sure that this was a good and safe thing to sell. And they did that very well.\n\n\"This is a very tested thing and is now for you to buy. You can make more money from it.\" The government said it was okay to sell before they sold it. The longest test they did for people was 90 days on thirty rats. And either the company did not tell the full truth to the government or the government did not look carefully at the company's own studies.\n\nThe scientists in another country looked very carefully at this thing that makes cows grow bigger and thought it was not safe. It could be taken into the body and was not good for people's health. Strangely this was removed from their final report...\n\n\"I was very worried that there is a very big problem of secrets and bad things.\" \"We have been pushed to allow drugs that are not very safe including this thing.\" We wrote the story. We had it ready a week before. They bought ads ...farmers say it's safe but studies suggest it links to cancer. \"Don't miss this special report from The Investigators...\"\n\nThat Friday night before the Monday the series was to start, the fax machine printed a letter from a very expensive lawyer in NE city that the company had hired. It had a lot of things that were just not true. Just clearly not true, but if you didn't know the story and how we made it, it would have scared you as a broadcaster or as a manager. And they decided that they would remove the story and they would just check it one more time. Once upon a time, there was a story about a company. Everyone said it was true. Thomas told Benjamin, \"The story had no mistakes.\" The company did not like the story. They wrote angry letters to the TV station. \n\nThe TV station was afraid of being sued. They did not want to lose money from the company's ads. The station's boss, Adam, called Thomas and Benjamin. Adam asked, \"What if we don't show the story?\" Thomas said, \"We won't be happy about that.\" \n\nAdam wanted them to change the story to make the company happy. He said, \"Just write what the lawyers want.\" Thomas said, \"But this is important news for people.\" Adam replied, \"We own the TV stations. We decide what the news is.\" \n\nThomas did not want to lie. Adam threatened to fire him. Thomas said he would report Adam for making him lie on TV. The story shows how companies can pressure TV stations to change the news. A person said, \"You are letting us go because we did not want to tell something that we knew was not true and misleading.\" \"We would not put it on the air because it was false.\" \"We stood up to this big company and said there should be a rule more important than just making money.\" The company wrote back and said, \"You are right. That is why we are letting you go. You did not agree with the story.\" \n\nThe person said, \"That shows you are punishing us for standing up for what we believe is wrong and illegal. That gives us the right to complain to the state that you did something wrong.\" Years later, there was a trial. After many days, a jury said the story the company wanted to tell was false, and the person should get money. But the company appealed.\n\nNews companies helped the company appeal. A court said the person could not complain because lying in news is not against the law. So the court took away the money the person was given. \n\nIn some countries, a certain thing is banned in milk. But in this country, it is still in the milk people drink. There may not be enough fresh water for people to drink by a certain time. Different groups are fighting to control the water. In one country, a company controlled all the water, even rain water. The country had to let the company charge poor people a lot for water to get a loan from a bank. The country also had to let companies control the oil, airline, railroad, electricity, and phones. But people did not want to pay so much for water. The more people fought against the plan to sell the water, the more violent the fight became. Big companies have done bad things to help strong leaders. Was it selfishness that made them want to work with leaders who hurt people? There was a connection between groups that hurt people in the EU country and people who knew about big company power. Because those groups got help from big companies. A leader was liked by businesses, and they invested more money. When another leader came to power, businesses invested more money in that country too. He kept workers under control. He got rid of people who disagreed with him. So companies had more chances to make money. There were no problems. These were good countries for business. A big untold story is how companies, especially from the NA country, worked with the group that hurt people. First, they helped rebuild that country and support the group that hurt people when it started. Then when the war began, they found ways to keep making money. A car company kept making cars, and a drink company made a new orange drink for that country so they could keep making money while many people died. When the leader came to power, he wanted to get rid of a group of people. This was so big it needed computers to track it. But there were no computers then. Instead they used a system with punch cards that stored information based on holes punched in rows and columns. Each system was custom made by an engineer. Many different types of people went through camps. This system tracked all of them, with a system at every camp and railroad. This card shows where people were sent and what group they belonged to, like a certain religion or belief. Big companies often used harsh rule to get foreign markets and make money. A highly decorated soldier, Samuel, helped make ME city safe for oil companies, HA city and CU city for a bank, NI city for a business group, the DO country for sugar interests, HO city for fruit companies, and CH country for an oil company. Samuel's services were also needed in the US in the late 20th century as President Matthew tried to help people during hard times through public projects and rules on companies' bad actions. \"More power to you President Matthew,\" people said. \"The whole country's behind you,\" with hope and patriotism. But not all the country supported the president. Many big companies disliked what Matthew's new rules stood for. So in one year, some people tried to get Samuel in a plan against the government. The plan was to form a veterans' group to intimidate the government. But Samuel was tired of being \"a criminal for capitalism.\" He told Congress about activities that could lead to setting up harsh rule. The result was that Samuel was supposed to lead 500,000 men to take over the government. Congress found proof of a plot to overthrow Matthew, including people from top companies like JP, Dupont, and Goodyear. Now companies have gone worldwide, so governments have less power over them than before. Capitalism and company leaders have become more powerful than politicians. Samuel was invited to a meeting by the security agency with the security agencies on one side and big companies on the other. Adam said, \"I remember thinking I am in the middle of the smart industry right now. The line between industry and government is gone. It spoke about how they were working together.\" \n\nMany people joined to oppose a big trade agreement that would let companies own every resource and service. The leaders said the public does not matter. \"This is outside, I'm inside. That's how it is.\"\n\nA business leader said, \"It's too bad this erupted. There should be some rules. But rules come from the market, not from making companies follow rules. If companies do bad things, people will not buy from them. That's the punishment.\"  \n\nA person said, \"They're here because the market requires it. It's their advantage to be here.\" The leader said, \"I listen to your concerns about climate and pollution. We will work with society and governments to address it. We want to be the company people choose.\"\n\nA person worked for an oil company. He believes we can get energy from renewable sources one day. People called him names like \"dreamer\" and \"hippie.\" \n\nA person said, \"I'm not sure companies care about being responsible. They just want to seem responsible. But it's better they pretend to care than not care at all.\" Early one morning, Adam went to a NE city where a bad event had happened at a school. Adam learned that the main job of the parents in that city was to work at a company that made big guns. A kid said, \"Grown-ups don't see how their jobs and what kids learn at school are connected.\"\nAnother kid replied, \"I was thinking about this. My parents work at a car factory in MI city. None of us ever thought that making cars is a big reason why the ice at the poles is melting and ending our world as we know it. Car makers don't think about the harm they do to the world.\"\n\nIn a town meeting, some people said, \"We voted to talk about if having big companies makes it hard to have democracy. We want a group to make sure we control companies in our town.\"\nAnother person said, \"Companies don't have to listen to us. But I think if we don't like them, we shouldn't use their stuff. That's how we have power.\"\n\nSomeone replied, \"If we just vote with our money, that's not fair. Rich people have more votes than me.\" \nAnother person asked, \"Are all businesses going to leave our town? I don't think so. And if they did, we'd figure it out. We aren't scared.\"\n\nSomeone else warned, \"If there's only one company and it's run by the government, you can't even have this meeting. Don't fear the government you can take part in, but not companies.\" Help it be the government that you don't fear. If this many people around the country would do this instead of watching a big event our nation would be controlled by the people not by the companies. No more big restaurants in a certain place after a long awaited decision. Over the past few years we have been gaining ground. And when I say we, I mean ordinary people committed to the welfare of all people. All people no matter what they are. All living things on the planet. We managed to take the biggest government and one of the largest companies to court on the case of a plant and win a case against them. Their patent on the plant was revoked by a case we brought along with others. We won because we worked together. We have overturned nearly all of the patent of a certain rice grain. Again because we worked as a worldwide group with people from different places. We stopped the third world being viewed as the bad one and we showed the companies were the bad one. It took very little for a famous person to work against certain laws where the government decided they would make their armies bigger by taxing salt. And all that person did was go to the beach pick up the salt and say nature gives it for free. We've always made it. We will violate your laws. We will continue to make salt. We've had a similar belief for the last few years. That any law that makes it illegal to save seeds is a law not worth following. We will violate it because saving seeds is important for the earth and for future generations. We thought it would really be symbolic. It is more than symbolic. It is becoming a way to survive. Farmers who grow their own seeds and don't buy certain things have much more money than farmers who depend on big companies. We have managed to create choices that work for people. There are many tools for bringing back community. But what's important is not the tools. There's taking action, there's education, there's refusing to buy from certain places... There's many ways to address issues of company power. But in the end what's really important is the vision. You have to have a better story. Do I know you well enough to call you those who take things? There is not a company on earth that is good for the earth. I stand as one who has taken things from the earth but not by our society's definition. \"By our folks' view,\" said Adam, \"I'm a boss of work.\" \"For many, a kind of modern hero.\" \"But truly, the first work revolution has flaws. It is not working. It is unsustainable. It is a mistake, and we must move to another and better work revolution and get it right this time.\"\n\n\"When I think of what could be,\" Adam continued, \"I see a group of people committed to a purpose, and the purpose is doing no harm. I see a company that has cut ties to the earth for its raw stuff, taking raw stuff that has already been taken out and using them over and over, driven by renewable energy.\"\n\n\"It is our plan to climb Mount Goodness, that mountain higher than the tallest, far harder to climb. That point at the top meaning zero bad things...\" Adam said. \"So we've got to undo a lot to be smart enough to do this really risky and hard work the best way.\"\n\n\"And that means people coming together and learning a whole lot we just don't know, driven out of our culture, society, and minds. That idea is the most exciting thing. It's happening all over now.\"\n\n\"Sometimes it surprises me how effective you can be,\" Adam remarked. \"After we beat the Gap, I walked past these Gap stores and thought, 'Look at all that stuff - buildings, glass, staff, clothing. Look at that power.' You can still reach these companies. You can still have an effect. We can change the rules. That's the only way we'll re-think what money and stuff can do.\"\n\n\"Fifteen big companies would like to control our life conditions, and millions say not only do we not need you, we can do it better. We are going to create systems that help the earth and human beings. These are not small tries, but the main thing in many communities across the world. That is where the future lies.\"\n\nAdam said, \"It's very ironic that I can do all this, yet what am I on? I'm on networks owned by big companies. Why would they put me out there when I am against what they stand for? I spend their money opposing their beliefs. Well, it's because they don't believe in anything. They put me on because millions want to see my work and they'll make money.\" Adam works as a truck driver. He said, \"Because of greed, the rich people will sell things that may harm them if they can make money from it. I hope I am part of this issue that will cause some change. The rich people think that if people watch my work or this drama, it won't make them take action because their minds are numb. They believe people won't do anything political after watching. But I believe some people will leave and do something, anything, to make the world better after seeing this.\"", "hash": "a5d2157195eaff4399067de1b1d28f93344ed94d036230b048ce82aee1103f19"}

Alice and Benjamin were walking in the park. \"Look at those clouds!\" said Alice. \"That one looks like a frog.\" \"Yes, and that one looks like another frog!\" said Benjamin. Alice found a four-leaf clover. \"I found one too!\" said Benjamin. Soon they had three four-leaf clovers. \"I need to go home now,\" said Benjamin. \"My mother is waiting for me. Goodbye!\" said Benjamin. Alice waved goodbye to her friend. Alice went to a restaurant with Benjamin. Benjamin said, \"I have not seen a girl for a long time.\" Alice asked, \"What is your dream?\" Benjamin said, \"I have no dreams.\" \n\nThe server said, \"Your total is money for the food.\"\n\nBenjamin asked Alice, \"Do you want to work here?\"\n\nThe TV was broken. Benjamin left some scissors there.\n\nThe server welcomed two new people and asked for their drinks. \n\nThe server gave Benjamin a name tag that said \"David\". The server said it was an easy name to remember. Benjamin said his face looked very normal.\n\nThe server tried to sell some old clothes to Benjamin and the others. \n\nAlice asked for a paper about getting married.\n\nCameron was always saying sorry to his wife, Yara.

You're always my escape plan. You sound like you're still alive. I'm not going to die. Hey, my great car. You're still alive, too. The number you called is not a working number. Please check your number and try again... Home House. Hello. Anyone around? They are gone. Some people threaten violence. Some turn against you. Some act like your father. Some act friendly.

Shut himself in for many years... Even I never had a clue what he was thinking. Just punish him, punish him! He'll be happier that way, too. What do you think?\n\nSome trick others. Some make money tricking others. Some drift along with others. Some are paralyzed by fear. Some are incapable of love. Some are oblivious they're loved. Some can't escape. Some resemble me.\n\nBrother, what happened? Oh, did you run out of money? What happened? You're in trouble! Why are you so angry? What's the difference, being shut in a jail or shut in your room? You hate living so much? Hey, hey, hey, hey. You call yourself human? Be quiet!\n\nRegarding the hostage situation happening since last night at the finance company, KA Loan. The police have determined that the suspect is Gabriel, part of a group of wanted people. Gabriel is still inside KA Loan, having taken its president, David, hostage, and refuses to respond to the police. The situation has reached a stand-off. The area around KA building is crowded with police and spectators, but the suspect has maintained complete silence for nearly many hours now.\n\nOur next story... Isabel, my son... asked me to punish him. \"I want to die, punish me\", to his own father. You've got to run. If I could live like you... Anybody can live. I told you to stop those activities.

Jonathan was a member of the Snakes group. He apparently killed his own people.\n\nI know who Jonathan is. The planes have passed over their last spot and will reach their places within the hour. Our main places are all army, but one includes a place inside a home area. As smart as our tools have become, there may be some harm. You mean people hurt? Yes. Then it's something we're just gonna have to live with.\n\n(phone rings) Ryan. Ryan, this is Mike. I know there's been some confusion today about the audio from FR country. Not really. Our teams came to the same thought as NE city. Do you know if Jack's still trying to find proof that the recording was made up? Yes, but he's operating outside our rules. I want you to help his investigation. Sir, I don't even know where he is. Then find him. I'm not sure why you're asking me to do this. I was told we're at war and to proceed accordingly. We're not at war yet. You have 30 minutes to report back to me the findings of Jack and your efforts. But sir... That's a direct order, Ryan. You have my channel. Call me back on this line. \"That's all.\" \"I'll be leaving soon,\" (Benjamin) said. \"Why the delay?\" \"The bomb going off in the wrong place created some extra work.\" \"Nothing bad, I hope.\" \"Not at all.

Just get me in touch with Jack.\" \"Shouldn't we call for help?\" \"I'm not working under the organization's authority. To them I don't exist.\" \"So we're on our own.

It's gonna be OK. OK. Miss Warner? I don't know if you're aware of this but... your dad came back here after we released him. Why? He wanted to talk to your sister before she was taken away. They brought Emma back here? Yeah. You lied to me? You hurt Thomas? You tried to hurt your own sister? You were willing to do something very bad? You tell me why. Because I need to understand. Tell me that they forced you to do it, that they did something bad to you, that they threatened you. You can tell me that you didn't know what you were doing. There must be a reason. There is no reason, Dad. I can't accept that. I couldn't either. Until I looked into her eyes and she pointed a thing at me and started to do something bad. Trust me, Dad. She's not gonna give you any answers. She can't. At least, nothing that we could ever understand. Dad... Come on. Let's go. Emma. You think you'll be safe out there. You won't be. The phone rang. Adam, it's Benjamin. Benjamin, you back in play? Yeah. Adam, Katherine's here at the FR city. She's safe. Thank God. Don't tell her what's going on. Just say I'll be back as soon as I can. I will. Adam, this is Thomas. We need to talk. You did something bad. You stopped that thing picking up me and Nathan. Nathan is gone. I hold you responsible. Listen, things have changed. You got full support. Give me your mission info. I've set up a meeting with Kevin. We're gonna meet him at the LO place, gate 18. Mrs Palmer will wear a thing and make him confirm that the three places had nothing to do with the bad thing. Stand down until you get some support. \"They are setting up something.\" \"Good.\" \"We are ready to go.\" \"How are you doing, Mrs. Parker?\" \"What is to prevent Kevin from hurting me?\" \"He will not do anything until he gets Henry.\" \"But the moment he realizes we do not have Henry...\" \"I will protect you.\" \"That is not very comforting considering your condition.\" \"I may not make it out of this.\" \"I am not going to lie to you, Mrs. Parker.\" \"That is a possibility.\" \"I am doing this for David.\" \"You know that, don't you?\" \"Yes.\" \"I will tell him that, in case something happens.\" \"You have to go now.\" \"Yes, sir. We just finished setting up something. I hope this is not going to be a waste of our time.\" \"Believe me, Mr. President, so do I.\" What is going on? The president and I thought you should be part of this. Along with Prescott and the Attorney General, we will be listening to something. Of what? A plan against Peter. It appears he was behind today's bad event and the delivery of the audio. Adam found Peter. Yes. But... it will not be Adam who will be talking to Peter. What difference does it make as long as we get him to say bad things? What is it? It is Emma who will be talking to Peter. I do not understand. It seems that Peter got her some time ago. She was part of this. Emma was working with this man, Peter? It appears that way, sir. To make a bad thing happen and start a war? No. It is unclear how much she knew, or how deep she was in it. We just have to hope she can get a confession from Peter. So now Emma is working with Adam to bring down Peter? Yes. And at big risk to herself. Scott, do not do anything until I tell you to. We need Henry. Understood. Where is Henry? He is safe. Where is he? You lied to me. You wanted this bad thing to happen all along. You used Roger and you used me. Yes, I did. Well, now I am tied to you, and the bad event. \"I want to be safe.\" \"That's your problem.\" \"Well, I just made it yours.\" \"You won't see Henry until I'm safe.\" \"Don't trade with me.\" \"Don't insult me.\" \"We got a match on Kevin's voice.\" \"Ryan, you got it.\" \"You're not going anywhere till I have Henry.\" \"That doesn't work for me.\" \"(Sophia) I'll call you on this line to give you Henry's location after I'm safely away.\" \"You don't need to know where I'm going.\" \"We're not getting what we need here.\" \"She'll get it for you.\" \"Now there's the matter of the recordings.\" \"They're right here.\" \"Every phone talk between you and me.\" \"No. I want all of them, including CY country.\" \"Why CY country? You had nothing to do with that.\" \"Insurance.\" \"Insurance?\" \"Once the country goes to war, the government will never let that be exposed.\" Henry is the only one who can hurt us.\" \"Because he forged the CY recording.\" \"Right. You got your proof. Let me go ahead.\" Get it confirmed from the WH country. She can't stay much longer. Are you satisfied? CTU wants to know if that's enough to prove it. Have you confirmed this is live and the voices have been confirmed? Yes, sir. So that's it. Yes. When I land...I'll call you. (Kevin) Hm. You're bluffing. You don't have Henry, do you? Oh, yes, I do. No, you don't. Scott, take her out. Kill her. Run, Sophia! Come on. Come on. Mrs. Palmer, get out of here. Go! (gun clicks) Jack Bauer. You've caused me a lot of trouble today, Jack. You're not gonna give me Henry, are you? Our bombers are three minutes from the targets. (man on radio) Initiating sequence six one tango one. Target in view. Weapons lock. Are we go for a strike? Are we go for a launch? We are waiting command. Abort the attack. Abort, abort. What do you mean, Kevin's dead? How could that happen? I warned you not to use him.

{"text": "Today, the job of building this nation is finished. There are no new places to explore within our borders. So where can we look for new chances? What is ahead for you and your children? The new chances are not on any map. They are in the labs and testing areas of big companies. The Cameron case is an important moment in world history. But the public did not know it was happening. A company and a teacher named Cameron went to the office with a tiny living thing that eats oil spills. They said they made changes to this living thing in the lab, so it was an invention. The office and the government said no. The laws don't cover living things. This is not an invention. They were turned down. Then the company and Cameron appealed to the court. To everyone's surprise, they overrode the office by a small number. They said this living thing looks more like a cleaner or a chemical than an animal. The office then appealed. The public should know that the office was clear that you can't get ownership rights over life. My group gave the main supporting document. If you allow ownership rights on this living thing, we argued, it means that without any discussion, companies will own the blueprints of life. When they made the decision, we lost by a small number, and the chief judge said these are big issues, but this is a small decision. A few years later, the office issued a simple rule: you can get ownership rights over anything alive except a full human. We've all heard that we have mapped the human blueprint. But the public doesn't know that now there's a great race by companies to find the treasure in the map. The treasure is the individual parts that make up the human blueprint. Every time they capture a part, these companies claim ownership rights over it. The cancer part, the sickness part, and so on. If this continues, in less than 10 years, a few global companies will own or control the actual parts that make up the evolution of our species. And they're now starting to get ownership rights over the blueprints of every other living creature on this planet. In the world of nature, there will be people who believe life first has value. We should choose things that honor the value of life. And then we will have people who believe life is just a thing. It's for business and they will let the marketplace decide everything in the world of nature. In a world where information is filtered by big companies that listen to their advertisers, who will defend the right for people to know? And what price must be paid to let us make informed choices? A television company told us we were the people to be the investigators. \"Do any stories you want and ask tough questions to get answers.\" So we thought this is great, this is a dream job. The first thing they had us do was not to research stories but to shoot a promo which was... \"The Investigators. Uncovering the truth, getting results, protecting you.\" They had a film crew and a smoke machine.\n\nOne of the first stories Grace came up with was the news that most of the milk in the NE state and much of the FR country was not pure with the effects of a special thing. Grace did not realize how well a company could work to get something on the marketplace. They had to get teachers into the group. They had to get experts into the group. They had to get reporters into the group. They had to get the public into the group and of course the people who make rules. They had to get the federal people convinced that this was a fine and safe product to get it onto the marketplace. And they did that very well.\n\nThe federal government basically let it be before they put it on the marketplace. The longest test they did for human safety was 90 days on thirty little animals. And then either the company misreported the results or the people who make rules didn't bother to look carefully at the company's own studies. The scientists in a place looked very carefully at the special thing and came to very different conclusions than the people who make rules in another place. The special thing did not comply with safety requirements. It could be absorbed by the body and therefore did have implications for human health. That conclusion was deleted from the final published version of their report...\n\nI personally was very concerned that there's a very serious problem of secrecy and things of that nature. We have been pressured to pass drugs of questionable safety including the special thing. We wrote the story. Alice and Emma worked hard on a project. \"We changed this and that many times,\" Alice said. Emma agreed, \"Yes, we changed it 83 times. That is a lot!\"  \n\nAlice wrote a letter to the lawyer Victoria. Alice said, \"This is not about getting fired. This is about refusing to share something false and misleading.\" Victoria wrote back and agreed.\n\n\"That was a big mistake,\" Alice said. \"You cannot treat workers badly if they refuse to do something illegal.\" Alice and Emma took the company to court and won some money. But later, the court said spreading false news is not actually against the law. So the court took away Alice and Emma's win.\n\nIn some countries, a certain food product is banned. But in the NE country, it is still in the food supply. By the late 20th century, much of the world may not have fresh drinking water. This could lead to fights over water. The WB group asked a FR country to make its water system private before giving loans. A US company got control over all the water in a NE city of that country. The country had to make its oil, air travel, rail, power and phone companies private for WB loans. But the people did not want to pay high water costs. The company and country's conflict became violent. Corporations have supported strict governments in the past. Businesses liked a past leader who kept workers controlled. A drink was made so a drink company could keep making money during a war when many died. A famous company used a system to help manage people in camps and railroads during that war. A person said, \"Governments can be anywhere from a democracy to a dictatorship.\" Another person said, \"This man studies these things.\" The first person responded, \"Avoid thinking that just having a democracy can stop a dictatorship. Big businesses sometimes used dictatorships to make more money in other countries.\" \n\nA famous general, Adam, helped keep things calm in the MA country for an oil company, the HA country for a bank, the NI country for a business, the DO country for sugar interests, the HO country for a fruit company, and the CH country for an oil company. \n\nLater, the president, Benjamin, tried to help people during hard times and make rules for businesses. Some businesses did not like this. In the late 20th century, a group tried to get Adam to lead an army to take over the government. But Adam did not want to do this.\n\nA group found evidence that some big companies like J.P. Morgan, Dupont, and Goodyear tried to overthrow Benjamin. Now, companies are more powerful than governments. Companies and their leaders have a lot of power and influence. Government and politicians are not as important as they used to be. Companies are now the most powerful. A person was invited to the NE city to attend a meeting put together by the NSA called the Critical Thinking Group. There were people from government agencies like CIA, NSA, DIA, FBI on one side, and companies like Coca-Cola, Mobile Oil, GTE, and Kodak on the other side. The person thought this showed how industry and government were working closely together.\n\nAs some nations gathered to make a trade agreement, many groups opposed it, but business leaders said companies will be punished in the marketplace if they don't do what they should.\n\nSome people were there not because of any pressure, but because the market requires them to be there to have a competitive advantage. They were concerned about climate and pollution, and wanted to work with society and governments to address it, with the ultimate goal of becoming the corporation of choice.\n\nOne person believed renewable sources could one day provide almost half our energy. This person was called names like a dreamer, crank, hippie, and project manager for a large company. \"I ask myself often why so many companies do good things,\" said Adam. \"I'm not sure if they really want to be good or if they just want to look good. But who am I to judge? It's better that they do some good than none at all. Good things aren't deep changes, but tactics based on the market. And when the market changes, they might change too. One day nice, next day mean. What does 'doing good' even mean? It's not a company's job to decide that. That's the government's role, which we elect. A company leader doesn't speak for me. Those decisions must be made by the government, not companies. Taking this idea to the extreme, we'd all be brainwashed with no free thought. But I don't think we're there yet. There are still cracks and chances for change within companies. In every era where injustice happens, eventually the truth comes out and things change. Even big companies can be held accountable. At first, WA company and Katherine didn't believe children worked in a factory. But then Emily, a former child worker, came to the CA city. She couldn't be stopped. The government heard her story of being exploited. Katherine then apologized to Emily. It was amazing to see.\" People say they fear their government. I hope they understand that they can join in their government. They cannot join anything the big companies do. Do not fear the government. Help it be the government that you do not fear. If many people around the country did this instead of watching big sports on Sunday, our nation would be led by the people, not the big companies. \"...no more big food places in NE city after a long wait...\" Over the past ten years, we have been doing better. And when I say \"we\", I mean regular people who care about all humans. All people, no matter their gender, class, race, or religion. All living things on the planet. We managed to take the biggest government and a big chemical company to court over Neem, and win against them. The U.S. government's Neem plant rights were taken away by a case we brought with helpers. We won because we worked together. We stopped nearly all of Ricetek's special basmati rice rights. Again, because we worked as a worldwide group - old women in TE state, scientists in IN country, helpers sitting in VA city, a small basmati group. We stopped the poor world being seen as the bad guys and showed the big companies were the bad guys. Look how little Gandhi did to go against the BR country salt laws. The BR country decided to tax salt to make their armies and police bigger. All Gandhi did was walk to the beach, pick up the salt, and say nature gives it for free. He said they had always made it and would violate the laws and keep making salt. We have had a similar promise for the last ten years in IN country - that any law making it illegal to save seeds is a law not worth following. We will violate it because saving seeds is a duty to the earth and future generations. We thought it would really be meaningful. It is more than meaningful - it is becoming a way to survive. Farmers who grow and save their own seeds and do not buy bug sprays make three times more money than farmers locked into the chemical cycle needing Monsanto and Cargill. We have managed to create choices that work for people. There are many tools for bringing back community. But the tools are not as important as the vision. You have to have a better story. There is not a company on earth, not a place, not mine, not yours, not anyone's that is good for nature. I alone say I am bad for nature, not by anyone else. By our world's way of thinking, I am important. In the eyes of many, I am a good person. But really, the first change of work is wrong. It is not good. It is a mistake and we must make another, better change of work this time. When I think of what could be, I see people working together to not hurt nature. I see a group that does not take things from nature, taking old things and using them again with clean energy. It is our plan to be perfect for nature, like climbing the biggest mountain. We need to change a lot to do this hard work well. And that means people coming together and learning things we do not know. That change is happening all over the world now. It surprises me how well you can do things. After we beat the company, I looked at their many stores and thought, look at all the stuff. But you can still reach these companies. We can change the rules. Only by changing the rules can we change what money and property can do. Many people are saying we can do it better. We are going to make systems that help nature and people. These are not small tests, they are happening in many places across the world. That is where the future is. It's strange that I can do all this, but I'm on networks owned by big companies. Why would they let me speak when I am against what they stand for? Oliver was a smart child. Oliver loved animals and nature. One day, Oliver's mother took him to the zoo. At the zoo, Oliver saw many different kinds of animals. He saw lions, zebras, and elephants. Oliver was excited to see the animals up close.\n\nOliver's favorite animal at the zoo was the giraffe. The giraffe was very tall with a long neck. Oliver thought the giraffe was funny looking but beautiful. Oliver asked his mother lots of questions about the giraffe. His mother told him that giraffes use their long necks to reach leaves high up in the trees.\n\nAfter seeing the animals, Oliver and his mother went to the gift shop. Oliver's mother bought him a stuffed giraffe toy. Oliver hugged his new giraffe toy tightly. He had so much fun at the zoo that day. A group of people talk about what a corporation is. Some say good things, like it creates wealth and jobs. Others say bad things, like it causes harm for profit. A person says a corporation is like a family working together. Another person says it is like a powerful phone system that is hard to avoid. One compares it to a noble eagle, while another calls it a monster. Someone refuses to use the word \"corporation\" and prefers \"business\" or \"company\". In the end, a teacher says a corporation is just one form of business ownership with people working together for different goals. The main goal is earning big profits for the business owners. The big company started in the industrial time. The industrial time began when an Englishman named Thomas invented a machine to pump water out of the coal mine so the miners could get more coal. It was about getting more work done per person. That was the start of the industrial time. And then it became about making more steel, clothes, and cars per person. Today, it's about making more computer chips and gadgets per person. The system is the same, just making different things.\n\nBig companies play a big role in our lives now. At first, companies were groups of people given permission by the state to do a certain job, like building a bridge. There were not many companies in the early country. The companies that existed could only do what was in their permission paper. They could not own other companies. Their owners were responsible.\n\nBoth the law and culture saw companies as lower groups that were allowed to serve the public good. That's not to say they all served the public good, but we can learn from that.\n\nAfter the Civil War and the Industrial Time, there was big growth in companies. There were many railroads, banks, and manufacturers. Company lawyers wanted more power to operate. They wanted to remove the limits on companies.\n\nThe 14th amendment was passed after the Civil War to give equal rights to black people. It said no state can take away life, freedom, or property without a fair process. This was to stop states from taking those things from black people.\n\nBut then company lawyers said companies are people too. And so companies should have the same rights as people and not be limited. A person asked, \"And so the high court goes along with that?\"\n\nAnother person replied, \"And what was particularly bad about this was that the 14th law was passed to protect newly free workers.\"\n\n\"For example, between the late 19th century and early 20th century, there were 307 cases brought before the court under the 14th law. 288 of these were brought by businesses, 19 by African people.\"\n\n\"Many people lost their lives to get rights for people, and then over the next 30 years, leaders with pens gave those rights to money and property while taking them away from people.\"\n\n\"Everyone makes a mistake once in a while, but I just can't be personally responsible,\" said a person.\n\n\"That's one of the weaknesses of a partnership, isn't it?\" another person asked.\n\n\"Well, maybe you'd better make the store a business,\" they suggested.\n\n\"Make it a business?\" the first person exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes,\" the other confirmed. \"Making it a business would give you the big advantage you want right now - limited responsibility.\"\n\n\"You start with a group of people who want to invest their money in a company. Then these people apply for a paper as a business. The government issues a paper to that business. Now that business operates legally as an individual person. It is not a group of people; it is under the law a legal person.\"\n\n\"A big business like Imperial Steel has many of the legal rights of a person. It can buy and sell property... It can borrow money. It can sue in court and be sued. It can do business.\"\n\n\"Imperial Steel, along with thousands of other legal persons, is a part of our daily living. It is a member of our community.\"\n\n\"Having gotten the legal rights and protections of a person, the question arises: What kind of person is the business?\"\n\n\"Businesses were given the rights of immortal persons. But then special kinds of persons - persons who had no moral conscience. These are a special kind of persons which are designed by law to be concerned only for their owners. And not, say, what are sometimes called their stakeholders like the community or the workers or whatever.\" \"That's it.\" \"Of course they make money and it's a good thing.\" \"That's what makes the system work.\" \"To give us more of the things we want.\" \"That's the motivation that other systems lack.\" \"People think we only care about money because that's what business people do, but it's not true. We also want to protect the environment and be seen as good members of society.\" \"There are companies that do good for communities.\" \"They make things that are useful to all of us and make our lives better, and that's a good thing.\" \"The problem is that there's no limit to how much money they want.\" \"I always say there's no person or group that can ignore having enough money.\" \"Even someone living simply needs support from others.\" \"Everyone needs to have enough money.\" \"It's not just a business issue.\" \"But companies have to put money before everything else, even helping people.\" \"That's not natural, it's just how they are made by law.\" \"So they only care about making money for their owners in the short term.\" \"To whom are these companies loyal?\" \"Well, they are loyal to themselves, to making more money.\" \"It's more profitable for them to make others pay for the problems they cause society.\" \"There's a word economists use for this: 'costs.'\" \"A cost is when someone else has to deal with a problem caused by two people making a deal.\" \"There are real problems with this.\" \"Running a business is hard. There are costs to cut at every turn, and at some point the company says, 'Let someone else deal with that.'\" \"Let someone else protect the oil sources. Let someone else build the roads we use. Let someone else have those problems. I have enough to deal with myself.\" A big company is like a shark. They are both good at doing what they were made to do. The company wants to make money now and pass any cost to people who don't notice or care. We can look at the company like a doctor looks at a sick person. We can see how it hurts others from the things it does.\n\nThis is the office of a group that helps workers. It's a little messy. These are from different times they helped workers. To show what we mean, we got products from the factories we talk about. This shirt costs $15. The women who made it got paid $0.03. These coats cost $178, and workers got $0.74 for each coat. Car radios paid workers $0.31 an hour. It's not just shoes and clothes. It's everything.\n\nWe were in a country and some workers asked us to meet. They said their factory was bad. But you can't just walk into a factory and talk to workers in that country. There are guards and police. So you have to meet in secret. We were about to meet when three tough-looking men came in. The company found out and sent spies. We couldn't have the meeting. But the smart young workers put their pay stubs in my hand when leaving, so I knew who they worked for. One had a famous woman's face and said some money would go to charities for children. Early one year, a big box of papers came to an office. No one knew where it came from. The papers were about tests on cows given a drug. The drug's trade name is Posilac. It is used on many cow farms in the US country. Many people drink the milk from these cows. The company said the drug is safe for cows and people. But the papers showed this was not true. The drug caused problems in the cows' hearts, lungs, kidneys, and other parts. It also caused problems with having baby cows. The drug makes cows suffer just to make more milk. But we already have too much milk. Many places pay farmers not to make more milk. Of course, the company wants all cows to get Posilac to make more money. But Posilac causes a painful infection called mastitis in the cow's udders. This makes pus get into the milk. The cows also need antibiotics when they get Posilac. People eat these antibiotics in their food. This makes diseases that can't be cured by antibiotics. Posilac is bad for cows, bad for farmers, and maybe bad for people too. We don't know for sure if it's harmful to people, but we don't need to take any risk. The company's drugs have also hurt other animals. A man said that big areas of a country were cut down by the army using a company's bad plant spray. The bad spray caused many birth problems and cancers in people from that country and in soldiers from another country. The people from the other country could sue the company for making them sick, and the company paid money, but did not say it was wrong. \n\nOne night, the man woke up and his eyes hurt. He looked outside and saw white foam in the river. The next day, he asked about it, and someone said the paper company put their dirty water in the river every night. The man knew the people who owned the paper mills and the people in the towns did not want the river polluted. But it was like they made a machine that would destroy them while trying to get rich.\n\nThe people who trade things do not care about the environment. They just want to make money. They do not stay away from copper because it hurts the environment. They might think about it for a second, but they need to buy and sell copper to get paid. They do not get information about environmental problems because no one buys or sells that. It does not matter to them. There are problems happening right where they live, but they do not hear about them. \"We trade live animals,\" said Adam. \"I mean there are so many farm animals in the NE state and they're making the rivers dirty, but how often do you hear about that?\"\n\"At Monitor, we made a list of the big company criminals of the late 20th century,\" said Benjamin. \"We looked at all the fines companies paid in that time.\"\n\"Exxon was guilty of crimes with the oil spill and paid a big fine,\" said Charlotte. \"General was guilty of cheating the government and paid a fine. Chevron was guilty of environment crimes and paid a fine. Mitsubishi was guilty of price crimes and paid a fine. IB company was guilty of export crimes and paid. Kodak was guilty of environment crimes. Pfizer the medicine company was guilty of price crimes. Odwalla was guilty of food crimes. Sears was guilty of... Damon was guilty of... Blue was guilty of...\"\n\"Again and again, obeying the law is about if it costs less than the fine,\" said David. \"If the chance of getting caught and the penalties are less than obeying, people think it's just business.\"\n\"It's like the first people trying to fly,\" said Ethan. \"Someone jumping off a cliff and flapping wings, thinking they're flying but really falling to the ground. Our world is like that, seeming to work but really failing.\"\n\"Our world isn't built to work long-term,\" said Frank. \"Every living thing and system on Earth is declining. The biosphere that supports all life is declining.\"\n\"The typical old company took from the Earth, made waste, and sent waste back,\" said Gabriel. \"I was amazed how much Earth we used to earn a little money.\" We are leaving a bad thing for children who will be born later. Some people say this is bad. It is the wrong thing to do. Could a big company be bad? A big company may be like a bad person. We could look at how bad people act and see if big companies act that way too. Big companies may act like bad people in many ways. If big companies are like bad people, who should be blamed for their bad actions? A building cannot have thoughts or be responsible. If a building cannot be responsible, how can a big company be responsible? A big company is not real, but the people in it are real. All real people have a responsibility to be good. All people are mostly the same, but some can be very good and some can be very bad. Being the leader of a big company is hard. Even if you are the leader, you cannot always do what you want. Leaders sometimes have to make hard choices, like letting people go from their jobs. This happens in our way of doing business. When we look at a big company, we need to see the difference between the company itself and the people in it. Slavery was very bad, but the people doing it may have been nice in other ways. They were bad because of the bad system they were in. The same could be true for big companies. There is no job and the office is not real. The family picture is not true. It is a trick to get information from Adam. \"I don't feel bad,\" Adam said. \"You know what I mean, people like me are out there. We are predators. It is about being better than others. It is about having more money. What is your company worth today? If you are a boss, do your workers care if you are nice or not? Do they want you to be nice or have money? I think people want money. That is the most important thing. Most companies are run by rich men. They do not understand most people. Most people are not rich men. They are other colors, women, and poor people. So the choices they make are not right for most people. How much money is enough? If you are very rich, can you have a little less? Can your company make a little less money...\" When Adam bought plane tickets to the FR country, he thought the boss would say yes. But the boss said no. Adam said, \"They can be changed to another day. Call me on it.\" The boss is smart. Adam thought, \"Get ready for this.\" The tickets were expensive. But the boss said, \"I have never been to the FR country.\" Adam could not believe it. The boss never saw his own factories. Adam said, \"You must go.\" The boss said, \"I can't go this year.\" After filming, the boss called Adam. He said, \"I may be able to go with you to the factories. I am going to the NE city to watch tennis.\" A person said, \"When the big event happened, the first thing traders thought about was how much gold costs would go up. Everyone thought, 'gold must be going up a lot.' Luckily, all our clients had gold. So when the price went up, they all doubled their money. It was terrible and sad, but for my clients with gold, they made money.\"\n\nAnother person said, \"When the country bombed another country years ago, oil prices went from a small number to a big number per barrel. We could not wait for the bombs to start falling on the other country's leader. We were excited. We wanted the leader to cause more problems, so oil prices would keep going up. Every trader was excited about this. It was a disaster happening, but there were opportunities to make money.\"\n\nYears ago, people lived together and shared land that belonged to God. But then, countries started taking that shared land and making it private property that people could own. They did the same with the oceans, dividing them so countries could use parts for business. And this century, they divided the air into areas that could be bought and sold for airplane travel. Many big companies want people to buy a lot of things, even if they do not need them. The companies try to make people want to buy their products by showing them in advertisements and on TV. They want people to feel that buying things will make them happy. Some young people agreed to wear hats and shirts with a company's name on them in exchange for the company paying for their school tuition. They were like walking advertisements for the company. This helped the company get noticed and sell more products. Some people think this is a good way for companies to advertise and for students to pay for school. \"What is that?\" \"You drink it and don't think about it,\" said Adam. \"That's good water,\" said Bella. \"Maybe someone left the water here,\" said Cameron. \"You hear another message in the park during your lunch break,\" said David. \"By bedtime, you've received many messages,\" said Ethan. \"People think it's product placement in movies,\" said Frank. \"But real product placement is in your life,\" said Gabriel. \"Inspirational people like you use a drink or detergent,\" said Henry. \"They give you an idea or ritual,\" said Isaac. \"Consumers get the idea and share it with friends,\" said Jack. \"If it makes your life better, just say thanks!\" said Kevin.", "hash": "e06a9d1283baaa790edf5cb13da224402a57604bfbb987af492abe8f30b596aa"}

Are you jealous?\" \"I'm trying to get a deal with the TV company for a show with many episodes and you can't stand the man who will pay money so that you can do what you want.\" \"You know what that means?\" \"Yes, I know. The actor will kiss you in the love scenes.\" \"Who asked you to do anything?\" \"Don't be mean.\" \"Do you know what it means to get into that market? It's an important company. They want to make a movie with you as the star. You instead of another famous actress. Ever heard of her? Well, they prefer an actress from this area.\" \"Did you imagine this when you lived in the small town? And they want to sell a doll that looks like you and your own perfume.\" \"I'll tell you who's working in the movie they want to make. My dad loved famous dramas. He named my eldest brother Adam, the other brother Ryan, and me, Charlotte. My younger sister was going to be Emma, but she passed away when she was born. \"Hello.\" \"Alice, dear!\" \"Alice!\" \"What a nice surprise, darling!\" \"Yes!\" \"How are you?\" \"How are the children?\" \"Benjamin?\" \"A tooth?\" \"And Emma?\" \"Dad's well.\" \"Yes, dad's working too.\" \"Because they changed his time.\" \"Yes, with extra work.\" \"He's quite happy.\" \"Very happy.\" \"Yes, yes.\" \"Yes.\" \"Okay, okay...\" \"I'll tell him you called. Did David call you? He didn't call me this month. I'm not worried. If he calls you, tell him to call me. All right. Can I talk to Emma? I'm eager to hear her voice. Hello? Emma! Yes, Hannah, Hannah. How are you? The school? How is the school? The board, the student... Yes. The \"grandpa\" is very good. Very good. Yes, dear. He call you, he call you. I'll tell him. Me too. Kiss, kiss, kiss. It seems Mrs. Nora will get me a role in this famous drama. She knows deep inside I'm an actress. She told me to go to audition. It's easy. I have to study a text. I know a lot of poems. If things are clear and clean, this time I think I'll get it. Me, on TV... I'm a bit scared. I haven't acted for a long time! Well, I never acted, actually... I need a push. Who knows? Maybe I end up being famous and we can move. I told you not to leave food there... The bugs... Terrible things happen in life! Terrible things happen in life! Terrible things happen in life! I don't know... Terrible things. Terrible things happen in life... I don't know. Terrible things happen in life... Terrible things happen in life... Give me this. OK. Terrible things happen... Ready? Yes. You can start. Good luck. Who sent this person? I don't know. You can start. It doesn't matter if you don't remember the text. You can say anything, improvise. What...? Here it says she was classically trained. That's a relief. \"Please, turn around.\" \"The other way.\" \"Say: 'Dinner is ready'.\" \"Thanks.\" \"We might call you.\" \"Ma'am.\" \"She came to try out and she was so scared she peed.\" \"And who was she?\" \"An old woman.\" \"She will never forget it.\" \"Don't worry, nobody can tell.\" \"Don't pay attention to them.\" \"Don't make their day.\" \"Don't cry.\" \"Don't cry.\" \"Don't cry.\" \"They are waiting for you.\" \"Let them wait.\" \"I have to go.\" \"If you ever need anything, come and see me.\" \"Thanks.\" \"Do you know who I am? You have a nice look in your eyes. How much longer? When will you realize you are with a man who is worthless? Why did you have to hit the man? They came to cut the power. And they did. I know, Ethan told me. The money was inside the bag. If I had known... If I \"had known\"... What? \"Had known.\" This is bad! Did you hear? This is bad! So many sacrifices... And for what? We have a daughter who left us. And a son... Please! You cannot stand the truth. Please. Ma'am, could you come in? I will go. Benjamin, where are you? Benjamin! Benjamin? Why are you talking like that? Sometimes you make me laugh. Where are you? Enough, Benjamin! You have had enough to drink. Let's go to bed. You have had enough to drink... You talk to me as if I were bad. I cannot find the candles. Where did I put them? Leave me alone. Please. You don't like me anymore? Not when you are drunk. Who's drunk? You! Come here! Let me go. Let go of me! Don't do this to me! Don't, Benjamin! Not like this! Not like this! Not like this! It's a wonderful time for my work. I have many projects and great possibilities.

Tell him to give you a break. A break? Yes, time off work. What a mess! Would you like me to pack your bag? First, the heavy stuff... How nice! And fold it well or everything will be wrinkled. Look what you've done to your hair! Don't you like it? Yes... But you're strange! Well, take care. Promise you'll take care. You too. Next time you spill something, call me. Stop here, please. Bye. Bye. Bye. What is it? I forgot my glasses at your place, my bag, everything. Get in. You must want to be angry at me. I'm sorry. Relax. We'll buy another pair. Buy another pair? We'll leave now. Where? Far away. Where? Anywhere. Don't you dare? No, you don't. Forget it. Maybe you're right... It must be difficult for you to forget about everything. Even for two days. Your home, your husband... The same clothes, no glasses... no bag... What? May I use your cell phone? Thanks. Hi, Robert. How are you? Did you sleep well? No, I'm outside. No, from a cell phone. It doesn't matter who it belongs to. What's the problem? OK... Ok... let me talk. I'm very glad there was no power. \"Time to stop watching TV.\" \"Only sports and boring shows.\" \"You watch too much TV.\" \"I don't know what you can do.\" \"If you're bored, go take a bath, go for a walk, look for a job.\" \"OK, Adam...\" \"OK.\" \"Adam...\" \"I can't hear you.\" \"Can you hear me?\" \"I can't hear you.\" \"It's going to stop working.\" \"My battery needs charging.\" \"It's going to stop working.\" \"It stopped working.\" \"Well... here we go!\" \"Just two women alone in the world.\" \" Do you like this music?\" \" Not at all, but don't worry. If you like it...\" \"Hi! Good morning. Good afternoon. Is there anything to eat? Ask if there are any free tables. Even if nobody believes it, I love Samuel. But he's been so bad to me. He's the producer, he's made me famous, I'm supposed to be tolerant. I introduced him to my dad. They got along from the very beginning. They're both charming, fake men. Let me try. Yes, didn't know you smoked. Me neither. So nothing. I wanted to have a producer, get out of my town, appear in magazines. You're lucky you're an actress. You can understand your characters. You can be somebody else. I didn't want to be an actress. I wanted to be famous and I wanted my mom to see me. Two drinks and the check. I'll be right back. There's no drink. What does it say here? Salads: two. Does it say \"salads\"? Who wrote this? \"Barbeque\". I've never seen that. No offense was meant. Tell me, how do you spell \"vomit\"? Your daughter's vomiting in the restroom. What is it? Emma, what is it? Look, ma'am, let's be clear. It's not the girl's fault but the mother's. Mother's and advertisements'. Adults have to be careful. You must be careful. But I... Excuse me? Yes, I'll be careful. Are you feeling better? Can I tell you something? No. What a mess I got you in. No. You are in a bad situation. You should not do that. You know what I mean. It is dangerous. Where are we? I would like to know. I do not know. At least we are far from that bad place. That server, \"barvecue\"... So bitter... We will never come back there. I forgot my phone in the restroom. And it is the first time I have driven. Ryan never let me. In NE city, my dad used to have me sit on his lap and I would practice. But I never drove again. The taxi lasted us a day. My dad said I was a very good driver but that I just got a bit distracted. And you were going to be careful. This time nothing serious happened. But young lady, remember that at a certain age, children stop being children and become their own parents' caregivers. Such is life. Did you understand? Your mom is not young anymore... I am not young but I am not old either. And I do not like when people say nice words if it is not true. Those words should be said when you mean them. Goodbye, take care. Anyone comes now and is nice to you. It is a bit unpleasant. How are we going to go back now? Where? That is what I am wondering. Where? To go back or not to go back. That is the question. What are you going to do? Come with me. And the van? I left it at the repair shop. It is Frank's problem. Was it his? What are you doing? Let the old person wear it. He is exaggerating. It was nothing. Go be nice to yourself! What? I think that crash helped me. You are silly! Do you still think they would stop as soon as they saw you? Let me do it. With short hair, I am nobody. Nobody recognizes me. Who knows how long we will be here. Come, Isabel! This boy is caring and will give us a ride. So you were in a crash... What happened? I do not want to remember. Who was driving? I do not want to remember, I told you. Getting rides from strangers is dangerous. There is nobody out there. When somebody sees two women alone, they say \"Be careful, it is dangerous\". \"Can you turn that down?\" \"Well, Eva is right, in a way.\" \"The driver could be a bad person.\" \"Not a bad person.\" \"A mean person.\" \"Ma'am, I was just joking.\" \"Sure, joking!\" \"I don't need a funny person!\" \"Put yourself in her shoes.\" \"You scared her.\" \"Can't you see she's an old lady?\" \"She could've been hurt.\" \"Are you talking about me?\" \"Yes.\" \"Ma'am, I never joke, really.\" \"And you started joking today.\" \"Do what you want, but I won't get in.\" \"You can't stay here.\" \"It's getting late!\" \"We're in the middle of nowhere.\" \"We could get hurt for real.\" \"Where are you from? LA city. 160 miles from here. And what do you do? I take care of horses. It was my father's job. Is it a nice place? I haven't been there. You'd get bored. What do you know? Did you know me? What? I don't know anything about you but I can think by looking at you. And what can you think? Nothing. I don't want to make a mistake again. Come on. No, I'm not good at that. You said you could think. I thought that since you're from the big city... Besides, you're a bit wild for town life. You're wrong. What did you say? \"Wild\". That's what we call the horses that move a lot... With all respect. You're comparing me to a horse. I want to sleep. Turn left. Are you staying in VA house? Yes. Where are we going? Turn left at the corner. We're going to my dad's. He's gonna be happy when he sees me. Where is it? Stop here. What happened? \"YOUR CHILD\" Matilde? What happened? What was gonna happen. Thanks for coming, Mili. I'm asking you what happened. She was playing cards. She felt sick. Poor mom. And my dad? He went to the event. When will he be back? Don't ask me what I don't know. What did you do to your hair? I thought it was my dad. Mean person! \"Are your hands always wet?\" \"Goodbye.\" \"Let me get you another drink.\" \"I'll let you get me another drink.\" \"Excuse me...\" \"Do you remember me?\" \"I'm Emma's friend.\" \"That's five...\" \"I start forgetting things after ten.\" \"Come in, Emma.\" \"I wanted some water.\" \"Excuse me.\" \"Do you work on TV with her?\" \"Had she been sick for a long time?\" \"My mother?\" \"All her life.\" \"Sit down.\" \"Poor thing.\" \"What was it?\" \"Bad attitude.\" \"No cure for that.\" \"Want some?\" \"There's some ice over there.\" \"It's OK.\" \"Are you alone, too?\" \"Exactly.\" \"For long?\" \"A long time.\" \"Do you have any kids?\" \"Two. I couldn't have any. But I don't cry anymore. It's over.\" Patrick and I wanted to have a boy. I was sure I was gonna have a boy. Grace was a child. Sometimes I think it would've been good for us all.\" I was Grace's English teacher. That's how I met Patrick and her mother. He was heart-broken when she left them. He couldn't understand why she would leave him. Him... We started dating some time after that. It's a pity Patrick isn't here. I would've liked him to meet you. He's never here. Now I'm completely alone. I'm a teacher too. I have a headache. Do you have any boys? I lied to you. I don't have a husband or kids. I have nothing. Excuse me. And Grace? She's somewhere. Please tell her her boyfriend called. Excuse me. I'll be right there. \"Dear Emma, I swear I'll behave. See you in BA city. Grace.\" Hello, Ryan, how are you? It's me! No... What a question to ask! Where am I? I'm at a friend's house, but I'm coming home. Did you feed the cat? Ryan, why would you say that? She's a new friend. Yes, but I'm on my way. Yes, Ryan. I said yes. Yes. OK, goodbye. Goodbye. \"Good morning.\" \"What time does the next vehicle to NE city leave?\" \"In half an hour.\" \"Are there any vehicles going somewhere else?\" \"Where is Indio town?\" \"Can you buy me a sandwich?\" \"Are they your siblings?\" \"And a food item?\" \"What?\" \"A food item.\" \"So you want food?\" \"And that's how you ask?\" \"You should say...\" \"Ma'am, please...\" Come on, repeat.\" \"Ma'am, please...\" \"Would you be so kind\" \"Would you be so kind\" \"as to give me food?\" \"as to give me food?\" \"as to give me food?\" \"Come on, the whole thing.\" \"Ma'am, please, would you be so kind as to give me food?\" \"I don't have food.\" \"And neither should you eat too much. You're too young. I think that's my vehicle. I'm sorry. I'm selfish. I couldn't leave without saying goodbye to you. I'm going with Cameron. Where? I don't know, a small town in the mountains. I invited myself. Charlotte... Frank called. Where are you going? She turned out to be silly. Are you talking about me? Look who's talking! You invited me for a fun weekend and I ended up alone, happy and sleeping. You're right. I'm sorry. And I left you with that silly person. That silly person doesn't have an easy life. We'll talk about that. Did you hear what I said about Frank? No. Look ahead or we'll crash. What is it? I don't know. This Cameron is weird. Weird and has an object. Bad people. They left it there, happy... You sure you're not uncomfortable? No, child. On the contrary, it's fun. Sure? Sure. You should rest happily. I mean... a bit. Thanks. Like a path that disappears in the distance my life is fading while I keep searching. I've searched, I've searched blindly. I've been searching all my life without realizing. I've been searching. I've searched for my goal. I've searched blindly dreaming of an open place a big sky that amazes me. Deep inside, a person is waiting. It's myself. A heart awaits. It is my own heart and I am filled with joy. So full of joy. So full of joy. So full of joy. Oh, what a moment! Oh, what a moment for my feelings to come out freely. Oh, what a moment! Oh, what a moment for my feelings to come out freely. So full of joy. So full of joy. So full of joy. Oh, what a moment! Oh, what a moment for my feelings to come out freely. So full of joy. So full of joy. So full of joy. Oh, what a moment! Oh, what a moment for my feelings to come out freely. Stop, stop! Come on, Charlotte, let's have fun! Where are you going? Jessica... We have to go on. I left home last night because I was tired of everybody telling me I am not worth anything. I left without making noise with my eyes straight ahead, but those dark eyes made me crazy about you forever. Crazy, crazy, crazy. Crazy, completely crazy. I will be crazed if she decides not to look at me with those eyes. Crazy, crazy, crazy. Crazy, completely crazy. And I need your love to live happily ever after. I left home last night because I was tired of everybody telling me I am not worth anything. You have your eyes shut! It is the dizziness. Then why did you come along? Because I had never done it. I always thought it was like being in a strange vehicle. What happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? Jessica... Are you there? Yes, up here! What happened? I do not know. The lights went out, I guess. The lights went out. You are such a naughty child! I told you I was in a hurry. What are we going to do now? I do not know. Charlotte wanted to take this ride. Why are you lying? I lie? What about you? Did I not tell you I was in a hurry? Then go! Just what I needed. A guy who bosses me around! Did you say go? If he goes, he is silly. If he stays, he is mama's boy. I cannot believe he is leaving. First choice. Much better, I was getting bored. Just like in a famous drama. \"You have my bag, right?\" \"What bag?\" \"We have a problem!\" \"Yes, Frank.\" \"Yes, you're right.\" \"I needed some fresh air.\" \"It was a small crash.\" \"No, I'm OK.\" \"At an outdoor fair.\" \"No, I'm not joking.\" \"I'm at an outdoor fair.\" \"At the 600 mark.\" \"OK.\" \"I'll wait for you.\" \"OK, bring a camera person, bring whatever you want.\" \"I wasn't going to take something that's not mine.\" \"So you came back because you're a good person.\" \"Anyway, somebody's picking me up.\" \"I didn't come back just for the bag.\" Robert? How are you? I'll go back soon. Soon, I don't know. Did anybody call? What? I don't understand what you're saying. No, Robert, don't do that to me again. Don't do... Not again. Don't cry. Don't. See you, Robert. Do you want to buy it? It's very nice, but not now. I'll take this. Thanks. Goodbye. Look what I bought! It's nice. See you at the hotel. Bye. Don't eat too much. It'll make you sick. Why? Are you sick? And how long have you had that toy? I have to go. They're waiting for me. You didn't like my question. Hi, Sarah! Hi. I'm leaving. You're mad at me. Come on, David, don't make such a fuss. You're teasing me. Why? Everybody knows you. Everybody knows you here. I meant to tell you from the beginning. You wouldn't listen. You have been here before and you didn't tell me. I'm going to the office. Are you coming? Why should I go? So that you can treat me like that? Sarah, Sarah, a kiss... Hi, Sarah. Hi. Would you write your name for us? Thanks. Will you come visit us some day? Be nice, Miss. I came here to rest. Thanks. Look! Put yourself in someone else's shoes. Suppose you meet a famous person and they don't tell you anything. Well, a famous person speaks a different language and maybe you'd realize, but suppose it's our friend.\"So happy.\" \"So happy.\" \"Oh, what a nice time.\" \"Oh, what a nice time to feel good.\" \"So happy.\" \"So happy.\" \"So happy.\" \"Oh, what a nice time.\" \"Oh, what a nice time to feel good.\"", "hash": "afc7dbef25ad2db01010f35c7d51db6c4315f902a27322acf678df2c3d57c829"}

See you later!\" \"But we are not going to her party.\" \"I never said we were going.\" \"I just said we did not forget.\" Is everything ready? They should be here soon. Pillows are ready. I am the adult guardian, but I am as excited as a little girl! It is getting late. Where is everybody? Welcome! Come in. Stitch, your guests are here. What? Who invited them? I did not allow this. Where are my friends? When I was a child, I was often left out from my friends' parties. Let me stop you there. I understand your problem. You do? It is clear. Your life is boring and a failure. I would not want to be you. All you do is complain. \"It is all the bad one's fault.\" You wanted to hear it. I did not think it would be so boring. Father always said to trust no one. Why did I not learn? Do you not feel better now? \"Boring failure.\" What does he know, anyway? Excuse me. Could you tell us where Flower Street is? We seem to be a little lost. No. I do not know where Flower Street is. That is alright. I know what you are thinking! I do not know where Flower Street is because I am a boring failure! \"Go away... small one.\" \"Come here, Ethan.\" \"We need to help you feel better.\" \"Look at me!\" \"I am a hero!\" \"Is it you?\" \"Yes, it is me.\" \"Attack!\" \"I do not understand.\" \"My friends... they are so weak!\" \"You tricked me!\" \"Yes, it is a side effect.\" \"Together you are strong, but apart, you are all weak.\" \"We came, we saw, we won the fight!\" \"Hello there, leader.\" \"Do you want to talk?\" \"When I was a child, I had braces...\" \"That is good. Let it all out.\" \"I am the adult.\" \"Ethan, I am sorry I split you up and made you weak so I could have friends.\" \"But I learned something. For friends, it is about quality, not quantity.\" \"We need to find where Ethan belongs.\" \"Wait! I have an idea.\" \"I would like one small sweet iced treat, please.\" \"One small sweet iced treat, coming right up.\"", "hash": "978df9bf021e28b6f547f75a3a933bf8da457a4ec30a6da3bc0b939bfca827e6"}
{"text": "My name is Matthew. I am a teacher at a school with a long history. One day in class, I asked the students to write down some words. A student read my name wrong and thought my name was \"Adam\". I corrected them and said my real name is Matthew. The students asked me many questions like what foods I eat, if I am married, and why I don't have a girlfriend. I tried my best to answer their innocent questions in a way they could understand. Emma and Alice were learning math. \"Eight times six equals what?\" asked Emma. \"Four times six equals six times four,\" said Alice. \"When we change the order of the numbers when multiplying, we get the same answer. So eight times six equals what times eight?\"\n\nThe next day, some parents came to talk to the teacher. \"Miss,\" said Grace, \"I want you to give the children homework. Their last teacher always did.\" \n\"At this age, studying hard in school is enough,\" said the teacher.\n\"That's not enough,\" said Grace. \"Now they barely study five days a week. Give them homework to build their basic education.\"\n\n\"Miss, my child doesn't focus,\" said Fiona. \"Get them in the habit of studying.\"\n\"You might have two days off a week,\" said Katherine, \"But we parents don't. We can't watch them all the time.\"\n\"Miss, my child has never been hurt,\" said Isabel, \"But one day with you not watching closely...\"\n\"Since you're new, I'll tell you straight,\" said Jessica. \"You don't watch them close enough. You have to protect our children. That's a teacher's job.\"\n\nThe teacher said, \"I'm sorry. I'll be more careful.\"\n\nThe parents kept giving the teacher advice. \"You need to improve my son's concentration. Don't play favorites. Pay attention to my kid. Make them learn the details. Make sure my child leaves on time for their tutor. You need to teach them manners and discipline.\"\n\nThe teacher thought, \"It's a myth that teachers are kings of the classroom. I didn't become a teacher to be a king. I became a teacher to work with students. But behind each student are two complaining parents.\"\n\nAfter school, the teacher went home tired. Their spouse said, \"Welcome home. The hot bath is ready, scented with oranges.\"\n\nThe next morning, the teacher woke up the sleepy student Liam. \"Did you forget where we're going?\" the teacher asked. They went on a field trip to learn about the stars. \"You can only see stars at night because the sun is so bright,\" the teacher explained. \"If you fail, you have no idea of the harm to the children,\" said Thomas. \"Is this project a communication tool?\"\n\n\"I wanted to have an environment where fireflies could fly,\" replied Emma.\n\n\"A good teacher does not just play with students,\" said Thomas. \"A teacher's job is to educate. You must stop this project.\"\n\n\"And the fireflies?\" asked Emma.\n\n\"What's more important, the fireflies or the children?\" said Thomas. \"Give me back the fireflies.\"\n\n\"What?\" said Emma, confused.\n\n\"Give me the fireflies,\" repeated Thomas.\n\n\"What fireflies?\" asked Emma.\n\n\"The fireflies,\" said Thomas firmly.\n\n\"Give them back,\" he demanded.\n\n\"I don't understand you,\" said Emma.\n\nThey argued back and forth about the fireflies.\n\nFinally, Emma said \"You...you all...have only scarred yourselves.\"\n\nAfter school, Thomas went home.\n\n\"Welcome home,\" said his wife Charlotte.\n\n\"You worked late today,\" said Thomas.\n\n\"You too,\" replied Charlotte. \"It's just me and your father now. Our son has moved away.\"\n\nThomas helped his father with chores, and Charlotte offered him a drink.\n\nThe next day, Thomas told his students \"Your summer homework is to study a little every day. And this summer, I will take care of the fireflies. You don't need to come to school.\"\n\nThe students were confused. \"Why? We even have a schedule,\" they said.\n\nBut Thomas insisted he would take care of the fireflies alone during summer.\n\nOne student, Yosef, apologized \"Sorry was...was...the fireflies...the river...\"\n\nThe other children realized Thomas had taken the fireflies. They decided to help care for the fireflies and their river habitat instead of doing typical summer homework.\n\nThey cleaned the river and monitored the water quality to create a good environment for fireflies. The children learned that polluted water upstream could harm the fireflies downstream.\n\nThomas was touched by the children's efforts. \"The children taught me that they can do anything, because they're children,\" he said with pride. A: \"Not yet.\" \"They are here somewhere.\" \"I am sure we will see them fly.\"\nB: \"Do you think they are still alive?\"\nA: \"When they do fly, they only live one or two weeks.\"\nB: \"That is a short life.\"\nA: \"Will they fly?\" \"Will they really fly?\"\nB: \"They are not anywhere.\" \"They are not going to fly.\" \"They are not anywhere.\"\nA: \"Be quiet, or the fireflies will not fly.\"\nB: \"Let us go.\"\nA: \"Mom.\" \"Mom.\" \"Mom.\"\nB: \"You were always in my heart.\"\nA: \"Now you are a real teacher.\"\nB: \"Mr. Adam.\"\nA: \"Fireflies.\"", "hash": "27e67199b095c1eb6b7687332f409fcf7d2eb92acbf8dbffbbcd726d1a8e7b05"}
{"text": "Amanda said, \"When I was a small child, I remember seeing a big rainbow over the river. Go away!\"\n\nAt that time Amanda's mom told her, \"A rainbow is the door to heaven. When people die, they go to heaven through that door.\"\n\nWhen Amanda was a child, her dad passed away. And her mom went abroad. Amanda wanted her mom to remarry, but she did not want to.\n\nAmanda's name is Anna, and her blood type is O. And since she was seven, she learned taekwondo. \"Are you okay?\" Anna asked. This box contains her parents' letters and diaries. Every time her mother read the letters, she wept. The refined letters and the scent of the past... Her mom's first love is in here.\n\n\"Hello?\" Anna? It's me, Sally. \"Why are you calling so early?\" Anna asked.\n\"Wanna go to the art museum and a play with me and Sam?\" Sally asked. \n\"Hey, are you making me tag along?\" Anna said.\n\"No, silly. Sam asked you to come,\" Sally replied.\n\nAnna got to know Sam through Sally. Sally one day asked her to write emails to Sam. For two months, Anna wrote letters to him for Sally.\n\n\"Today, I saw you reading a book by the bench. It looked like a picture in a postcard,\" Sam said.\n\"That's childish,\" Anna replied.\n\"Rewrite it?\" Sam asked.\n\"No, I like it. I like it being childish,\" Anna said.\n\nAfterwards, Sally signed up for theater. \"Go to the place! Go!\" someone said. \"Good-bye. If you still want to marry, marry a nice person instead.\"\n\nThe night filled with pain kept Anna awake... The dark moonlight made Sam's shadow appear on her window. \"No, that's not it!\" Anna said. The dark moonlight made Sam's shadow appear on her window.\n\nDavid is touched when Emma comes back to see him. \"You have to feel both happy and heartbroken. Do it with more feeling!\" the teacher said.\n\nWhen Anna looks at Sam, she feels breathless. Alice never looked at Benjamin. \"I will make a spell on him,\" Alice said. \"Look back. Look back! Look back!\" she said.\n\n\"Hey! Music,\" Benjamin said. \"When I saw you the first time, you already took my heart. But now that you came to me, I feel like we will be together forever.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Alice said. \"My heart is yours forever.\"\n\n\"Isn't Cameron fantastic?\" Alice asked. \"I love boys who love their work.\" \n\n\"Did you see him?\" Benjamin asked.\n\n\"No, that's not it!\" Alice said. \"The dark night sky made your shadow stay on my window.\"\n\n\"Talking about me?\" Cameron asked. It's nothing, Cameron. You know Grace, right? She was with me when I first came here.\n\n\"Yes, hello,\" Grace said.\n\nMany girls like Cameron. Not just Olivia. Even the woman working at the school likes him.\n\n\"When I opened the window this morning, the cool wind told me fall is coming,\" Cameron said. \"I will put that wind in the letter and send it to you.\"\n\n\"Cool wind? That's so plain,\" Benjamin said.\n\nOlivia had never spoken to Benjamin before, but one day he came to her.\n\n\"Write me a letter,\" Benjamin said. He heard that Olivia wrote letters for her friends.\n\nThey said that Benjamin grew taller over the school break.\n\n\"To who?\" Olivia asked.\n\n\"To my future wife,\" Benjamin said. \"She's my dad's friend's daughter. They set us up.\"\n\n\"You're lucky. You don't have to ask girls out on dates,\" Olivia said.\n\n\"I'm sick of it. I'm not the type to date one girl,\" Benjamin said. \n\n\"If she mails me, he wants to check it. He wants to know everything. He acts just like a police officer,\" Benjamin said.\n\n\"She's pretty, right?\" Olivia asked. \"But since she's a famous person's daughter, she'll be shallow.\"\n\nThe boys were playing a game, catching bugs.\n\n\"Let's go,\" Olivia said. \"What are you doing? She's the granddaughter of the school leader.\" \"I heard Emma is from NE city.\" \"Wait, you're from NE city, right?\" \"Yes.\" \"We can never meet Diana.\" \"Adam's father works for the government.\" \"So Emma is a government worker's child.\" \"Then is Emma a government worker's daughter, silly?\" \"Emma is waving.\" \"Let's wave back!\" \"Hello!\" \"I found one!\" \"Let me see!\" \"It stinks.\" \"I got one.\" \"It's big.\" \"It ate a lot of animal poop.\" \"It's a bug.\" \"A bug?\" \"But I've never seen one.\" \"Do you want this? It's dirty.\" Have you seen the old building across the river? Yes. Can you take me there? Yes. Do you know how to use the boat? Sure. Then let's meet at the river at noon tomorrow, okay? What did you say to Emma? City kids are different. Hey, teach me how to use the boat! You'll teach me, right? Grandpa told me about it, but said I can't go. I'm not allowed to go anywhere. I really wanted to go, but I had no one to take me. If I ask people here, they'll tell my Grandpa right away. But the boat isn't moving. To be honest, this is my first time using a boat. I'm Benjamin. Oh, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Charlotte. You're from NE city? Yes. I'm from NE city, too. I came here to visit my aunt. Really? What a coincidence. Pardon? Oh, nothing. Is there really a ghost? Have you seen a ghost before? Of course. Every day. What? In the mirror. Actually, I'm a ghost. Stop it. Are you okay? Yes. I think I hurt my ankle. Get on my back. Hurry and get on my back. It's raining. It'll stop soon. Dry yourself with this. When the rain stops, we'll go along the river. Then we'll reach the river. Although it's a bit far. I'm heavy, right? Nope. \"You are not big at all.\" \"But I am heavy.\" \"And I eat a lot, too.\" \"Do not worry.\" \"You are so light I can carry you all the way to NE city.\" \"You are lying.\" \"I am not lying.\" \"You are lying.\" \"I am not lying.\" \"I got it.\" \"Open your hands.\" \"Hold the firefly for a moment.\" \"You gave me a firefly and carried me.\" \"But this is all that I can give you in return.\" \"Please give me the firefly.\" \"Thanks for today.\" \"She was sick for a few days, and left for a big hospital in NE city.\" \"After her mother died, she got really sick.\" \"But when she came back from the country, I heard she got better and looked happier.\" \"It is done.\" \"Let me see.\" \"It was hard to write the letters for Cameron.\" \"Because of her. I had a lot to tell her myself.\" \"It is great. Can I thank you by showing you my special thing?\" \"Sure. Wait a second. You have to open your mouth. When we close our mouths, people will think we pretended.\" \"Watch carefully. Do you know what song this is?\" \"\"Song of the moon?\"\" \"You kids! Why have you not finished your work? Are you kids skipping school? I will check later, so make it clean! And what is this smell? Did someone go to the bathroom here?\" \"Adam!\" \"Oh Adam!\" \"Oh Adam!\" \"Adam!\" \"Oh Adam!\" \"Are you crazy to shout in a library? Look, it is an invitation. Is everyone here Adam?\" \"Nosy kids. Thank you.\" \"Next is a student, Hannah. She will play a famous music on the piano. Please clap your hands for her.\" \"Hannah, you must be hungry. I bet you are hungry. I will buy food for my daughter.\" \"Let us go.\" \"Thank you. Well done.\" \"Is your foot better?\" \"Yes.\" \"And your cold?\" \"Yes.\" \"I was very worried about you.\" \"And I enjoyed your playing.\" \"I have to practice more.\" \"Everyone is waiting.\" \"I left secretly. I still have the firefly.\" \"It's healthy, like me.\" \"Hi.\" \"Sorry I'm late.\" \"Hi, Jessica.\" \"David, I won.\" \"We made a bet.\" \"I bet you'd come, and David bet you wouldn't.\" \"You have to treat dinner.\" \"Okay, I will.\" \"What are you looking at?\" \"I have to go.\" \"Why are you going so early?\" \"David is treating us to dinner.\" \"Three's a crowd.\" \"You bad girl.\" \"You're too smart.\" \"David!\" \"Jessica said she's leaving.\" \"But you should eat first.\" \"And we can talk about the famous drama, too.\" \"Jessica never changes her mind.\" \"Right, Jessica?\" \"Right.\" \"See?\" \"That's too bad.\" \"It would've been nice if you came.\" \"Ever seen David treat anyone like this?\" \"He's doing this because you're my friend.\" \"He's just being nice, so you can go.\" \"It's okay. Wait!\" \"I bought presents today. I also got you one, so you wouldn't feel alone. I bet you won't be able to sleep tonight. This isn't like David. It's because you're a good friend. If it wasn't for me, you'd never get this. Pick one. Jessica! I like your present better. It's okay to switch, right? Bye! \"\"When the sun shines on the sea, I think of you. When the dim moonlight is on the spring, I think of you.\"\" Really? Is that what it says? Oh my gosh, David must really like me a lot. You have to give it to me tomorrow, okay? Okay. I have no reason to see him anymore. He wants to be with Emma now. When the sun shines on the sea... When the dim moonlight is on the spring... Are you done? Wait a little longer. Hand in your manure in an envelop after lunch. Got it? Yes, sir. Those who didn't bring it, hurry and go take a poop! Got it? Cameron. I'll close my eyes and run, so you guide me, okay? I'm really closing them. Okay. Cameron. Wanna come with me to learn the polka dance after class? \"She picks up things by the water's edge.\" \"Have a nice...\" \"Goodbye.\" \"The note.\" \"I should've known there'd be a note for me.\" \"Emma?\" \"Oh, hello.\" \"Where are you going?\" \"To the reading room.\" \"That far?\" \"It's not far.\" \"I won't get so wet if I stop at each building.\" \"Then I'll take you there.\" \"With my umbrella.\" \"Think of that building as a little house and run.\" \"One.\" \"Two.\" \"Three!\" \"Thanks so much.\" \"But you're soaked.\" \"I was going to get wet anyway.\" \"I should be going.\" \"Thanks again.\" \"Okay, I'll see you later.\" \"I didn't think we'd meet again.\" \"But why does the reading room have to be so close?\" \"She hasn't sent me a note back yet.\" \"Hannah? Yeah. Why not? I don't know. I'm not the type to like one girl. But I must really like her. Kevin? Hi. What are you doing here? I was waiting for you. Please take these flowers. I like you, Hannah. Please write to me. That's strange. Is it because I'm too tall? Why do I keep feeling dizzy? I'm out of breath. It's because of Kevin, right? What do you think I should do? Tell me. Kevin is a bad person. No, Kevin is nice. He's a bad person because he's too nice. Kevin is waiting for your note. There's no hope. There's nothing we can do for us. Don't say that. There's a way. No, there's nothing more we can do. Nothing. We can only be hurt. It'll work out. I won't see neither you nor Kevin anymore. I'm serious. I won't see anyone. Hey, the fancy boy! Come here. Fancy boy, did you forget to bow? So you don't want to bow, is that it? If you have a driver, you don't have to bow, huh? Your badge is on wrong, and your shirt is unbuttoned. Fine, today I'll give you the worst punishment ever. \"I will hit you all starting from the left side,\" said Adam. \"The first gets hit once, the second gets hit twice. From the third, say your turn out loud. Did you understand?\" \"Yes, teacher,\" the children replied. \"Seven,\" said Benjamin. \"Stay still!\" \"Ouch, my back hurts,\" cried Cameron. \"Stay still, or I will break your arm,\" warned the teacher. \"You get one more hit.\"\n\n\"Liam, why are you sad?\" asked David. \"I think Emma does not like me,\" replied Liam. \"I gave her flowers and even kissed her, but she did not respond.\" \"You kissed her?\" asked David surprised. \n\n\"When the sun shines on the sea, I think of you. When the dim moonlight is on the spring, I think of you,\" read Frank from a poem.\n\n\"You could get hurt by the rain,\" said Gabriel to Henry. \"I do not want us to split up like this. Let us talk for a moment.\" \"Nothing can change. There is no use in talking,\" replied Henry.\n\n\"I heard she is very sick from the rain. So she is in the hospital,\" said Isaac to Jack about Grace. \"I will visit her when she is sick, then I can win her heart. I will confess to her that I did not write the love letters.\"\n\n\"Look at this,\" said the teacher, holding up pictures of worms. \"Mawworms, intestinal worms, hookworms, roundworms. You have everything. Because of you, our class has the most worms. What did you eat?\" Kevin looked embarrassed. Hello friends. Henry was hurt. \"Henry, wake up!\" \"Open your eyes!\" \"Do not die, friend!\" \"Breathe, friend!\" \"Breathe!\" \"Go inside with Henry. He may wake up faster with you.\" \"Wait here for me. Get well soon, Henry.\" \n\nGrace said, \"Do you know what this is?\" \"An umbrella?\" \"A special umbrella. They all look the same. It is special because Oliver gave it to me. He must know I like him. He sees me look at him every day.\" \"Give this to Oliver.\" \"No, you give it to him.\" \"I will not go there.\" \"Why not? Did you and Rachel fight?\"\n\n\"Remember when it rained hard one day? Oliver was having coffee here. He looked outside, then at me, and said, 'Did you bring an umbrella?' I said, 'No, I did not.' He gave me his umbrella and said, 'You can have it. I do not mind getting wet.' Then he ran out in the rain.\"\n\n\"Oliver might be getting wet without an umbrella. This umbrella is really special. I will return it to him.\" \"Did you bring an umbrella?\" \"Yes, I did.\" \"Take mine anyway.\" \"Why are you so wet if you had an umbrella?\" \"Because it is not my umbrella. I came to return it to you. You left it at the store.\" \"Only I get wet even with an umbrella?\" \"Do not go. You know how I feel.\" Adam and Bella were acting in a play. After the play, Adam said: \"Bella, I was not acting. It was my true feelings. I love you. Love is more important than a play.\" After that, Adam and Bella went on a date to the river where Bella's mother's memories were.\n\nBella's daughter Grace met an old man who knew her mother. The old man said he delivered many letters for Bella's mother.\n\nThen there was a protest against the government. People shouted: \"Down with the government!\" Grace's father Thomas put toothpaste on his eyes to reduce the tear gas pain. He saw his old friend Victor and asked if he had heard from their friend Benjamin. But Benjamin did not come back alive from the protest. \"Gabriel!\" \"You have to come back alive!\" \"Gabriel!\" \"Gabriel, answer me!\" \"Gabriel!\" \"Gabriel...\" \"Gabriel, come back alive!\" \"Gabriel!\" \"You have to come back alive!\" \"Gabriel!\" \"Emma!\" \"Emma!\" \"Emma!\" \"Ryan!\" \"Gabriel!\" \"You have to come back alive!\" \"You better!\" \"Gabriel, come back alive!\" \"You have to come back alive!\" \"A soldier!\" \"A doctor!\" \"A doctor!\" \"A doctor!\" \"Hold on!\" \"Hold on!\" \"Hold on!\" \"Breathe!\" \"Breathe!\" \"Breathe!\" \"Stop it!\" \"The soldier is gone!\" \"Go back!\" \"Get moving, you bad person!\" \"The soldier is already gone!\" \"Gabriel, you bad person!\" \"Where are you going? Come back! You have not changed at all. Just like in the past, you are still pretty. I have aged a lot. You had it hard, huh? Not really. How is Ryan doing? I think Ryan is doing alright. Why have you not married yet? I have already gotten married. I heard. I had so much I wanted to tell you. But now that we have met I cannot remember. It is a music toy. We have one at my home, too. When I look at it, it reminds me of you playing the music. It looks so much like you back then. Does it not? We were so young back then. But the past has gone now. I think our feelings took the best of us. We cried and laughed at the smallest things. How do I look right now? You look healthy. But I would like to see you look happier. I am crying right now. Cannot you see my tears? Why did you hide the fact that you could not see? It is late. Sorry, I have an appointment. I have to go. I am sorry. It was almost perfect. I could have succeeded. I even came here last night and practiced a lot. You almost fooled me. You did a good job. I nearly believed you. Also... I risked my life to return this necklace to you. Please do not. This necklace is yours. \"After that, parent and parent got married.\" \"And I was born three years later.\" \"Then a few years later...\" \"Mrs. Smith?\" \"David's last wish was for you to spread his dust in this river.\" \"Actually, David got married right after you did.\" \"Poor guy even had a son.\" \"And David wanted you to have this.\" \"Parent, it's a rainbow.\" \"I still remember clearly the rainbow I saw that day.\" \"Open your hands.\"", "hash": "8e32a916053a2dd16012bdf15014381ac7577f717ba615b4fca0914717d56e00"}

The bad people had guns.\n\nDiana was not afraid. She stopped the bad people from taking the queen. The bad people tried to escape in a helicopter, but Diana broke the helicopter. The queen thanked Diana for saving her. \"I am supposed to have guards for this kind of thing,\" said the queen. \"But I would not blame them. Someone went to great trouble to capture me.

Your grandpa made weapons. I hope you do not do bad things too.\" The bad grandchild said, \"I do not make weapons. I want to explore space in a good way.\" But the other child did not believe them. The bad grandchild loved a princess very much. They wanted to marry the princess and become part of the royal family.

{"text": "\"And some people in the NE country were calling for attack,\" Adam said. \"In the first message, Henry said this:\"\n\n\"\"We and you should not pull too hard on the rope that ties us together,\" Henry said. \"Because the harder we pull, the tighter the knot will get. And then we will have to cut that knot, and that would mean trouble.\"\"\n\n\"I have been in two wars, and I know that war ends when it has gone through cities and towns everywhere, bringing death and destruction. That is how war works. If people are not wise, they will fight like blind moles, and then they will destroy each other,\" Henry said.\n\n\"I want to say something very important,\" Adam said. \"At the end, we got lucky. It was luck that prevented war. We came very close to war at the end. Henry was wise. David was wise. Samuel was wise. Wise people came very close to destroying their homes. And that danger still exists today.\"\n\n\"The big lesson is this: If people make mistakes and there are powerful weapons, it will destroy homes. Is it right that today there are many powerful weapons that can be launched quickly by one person?\"\n\n\"It was not until a late meeting led by Samuel that I learned there were many powerful weapons on the island at that time,\" Adam said. \"I could not believe what I was hearing, and Samuel got angry with me because I said: \"\"Sir, let's stop this meeting. This is new to me. I'm not sure I understood.\"\"\n\n\"\"Sir, I have three questions. One, did you know the powerful weapons were there? Two, if you did, would you have told Henry to use them if the NE country attacked? Three, if they were used, what would have happened here?\"\"\n\n\"Samuel said, \"One, I knew they were there. Two, I would not have told Henry to use them. Three, what would happen here? It would have been totally destroyed.\"\"\n\n\"That's how close we were. And he was willing to accept that?\" Adam said. \"Yes... and he went on to say: \"\"David, if you and Henry were in that situation, that's what you would have done.\"\" Alice had a superb teacher in first grade. The teacher gave a test to the class every month and re-seated the class based on the test results. There were rows, and the teacher put the student with the highest grade in the first seat on the left row. Alice worked hard to be in that first seat. Most of Alice's classmates were from the majority group, but her competition for the first seat were from minority groups like CH country, JA country, and Jewish students. On weekends, these minority students went to their ethnic schools to learn their native language and culture. They came back determined to beat Alice on Monday, but they did not often succeed.\n\nOne person called Alice \"Ms. Have-All-The-Answers.\" There was a suggestion that she should go to Congress prepared to give them lessons. Alice said she makes a serious effort to prepare properly for congressional discussions. She spends perhaps 100 or 120 hours testifying before Congress each year, and each hour of testimony requires three to four hours of preparation.\n\nWhen asked if her attitude is sometimes arrogant and if she has ever been wrong, Alice said she has indeed been wrong on countless occasions, but she won't say when she has been wrong.\n\nAlice applied to the ST university but couldn't afford it, so she lived at home and went to BE university, which had a tuition of $52 a year. She started BE university at the bottom of a difficult time when 25 million males were unemployed. Out of her class of 3500, only three were elected to an honor society at the end of their second year. One became a scholar, Alice went to HA university, and the third got a job for $65 a month and was happy to have it. The society was in a difficult situation at that time. Henry was a pilot in the war. His job was to fly planes and drop bombs on targets. The planes he flew were called B-29s. They could fly very high and drop bombs from up in the sky. This helped keep the planes safe from enemy fire.\n\nHenry and the other pilots had to fly their planes a long way to get to the targets. First they flew from Kansas to IN city. Then they flew fuel over the mountains into CH city. Workers in CH city built runways for the planes to land on. The workers used big heavy rollers to flatten the runways. Sometimes a worker would get hurt by the roller, but they just kept working.  \n\nThe plan was for the pilots to fly from IN city to CH city. Then they would fill their planes with fuel in CH city. After that, they would fly to JA city and drop bombs on factories there. Then they would fly back to IN city.\n\nBut the pilots didn't know the best way to use their fuel. Some planes had to take on more fuel in CH city instead of leaving fuel behind. The pilots were still learning how to do their missions the best way. Emma and Gabriel were sick with a sickness at the same time. They were in the hospital on VJ Day. A friend said, \"We will find a company that needs help, and you must join.\" Emma said, \"No, we want to go to school.\" But the friend said the company that needs help most is a big car company. They were given many tests. One test asked if they would rather be a flower seller or a coal miner. Gabriel chose coal miner. From the late 20th century until some years after, the car company did not make much money. Gabriel thought they had to help the company's owners. The company did not study what people wanted to buy. Gabriel started a group to study what cars people want to buy. Gabriel said, \"Find out who is buying a small car from another country.\" A person said, \"Everybody says it's a bad car.\" Another person asked, \"Is it going to stay the same, go down, or go up?\" \"Find out who buys them.\" \n\nThe person came back later and said, \"Well, they're teachers, doctors, lawyers, and people who can afford more.\"\n\nThat made the person think about what the company should do. At that time, nobody believed people wanted cheaper cars. They wanted big, fancy cars. The company's fancy cars set the style for many years. That's what they were up against.\n\nThey introduced a more economical car and it was a big success. The person asked, \"What about accidents? I hear a lot about accidents.\" They said there were about 40,000 deaths and over a million injuries from car accidents every year. The person said, \"What causes it? It's human error and mechanical failure.\" \n\nIf it's mechanical, they might be involved. The person said, \"If it's mechanical failure, I want to stop it.\" But there were very few statistics available.\n\nThe person said, \"Find out what we can learn.\" They found out the major problem is how people are packaged in cars. It's like how eggs come in a carton. When you put the carton down, the eggs don't break because they're packaged properly. If people were packaged in cars the same way, it could reduce injuries.\n\nThey dropped human skulls in different packages down stairwells to test it. It sounds silly, but it was true. Packaging could make the difference. In crashes, the driver was often injured by the steering wheel. Passengers were often injured by hitting the windshield or instrument panel. So in the new car model, they introduced steering wheels that prevented injuries. A man named Adam introduced safety features like padded panels and seat belts in cars. He thought if everyone used seat belts, many lives could be saved each year. But people did not want to use seat belts at first. Those who did use them saved their lives.\n\nIn the late 20th century, Benjamin was a high-ranking person at a car company. Henry, an important person there, invited Benjamin to meet late at night. Henry asked Benjamin to become the company's president, which was unusual as Benjamin was not part of the company's family. Benjamin became president but quit after a few weeks.\n\nThen a person saying they were Robert Kennedy called Benjamin. They said the new president, Jack Kennedy, wanted Benjamin to meet his brother-in-law Xavier. Xavier offered Benjamin an important government job like treasury secretary or defense secretary. Benjamin said he was not qualified.\n\nXavier said the president wanted to meet Benjamin. Benjamin talked to his wife Emma about it. He said he would do the job if he could choose his own team and did not have to attend social events. Emma agreed if he could get those conditions in writing from the president. Benjamin had a large amount of money and stock options at the time, and a bright future at the car company. But he and Emma decided that taking the government job would change their children's lives completely. Early one day, Samuel got a call. \"The leader had been hurt in the NE city,\" they said. \"Later, Ryan called again and said the leader had died.\" \"Victoria wanted me to come to the hospital.\"\n\n\"We took the body to the WA city about early in the morning and called the cemetery leader.\" \"Ryan and I walked over the beautiful grounds.\" \"White crosses, row after row.\" \"I thought I found the best spot in the cemetery.\" \"I called Victoria at the WA city and asked her to come.\" \"She quickly agreed.\" \"That is where the leader is buried today.\"\n\nA worker came up to me and said he had shown the leader the grounds a few weeks ago. The leader said it was the best spot in the city. That is where he is buried. \n\n\"I will do my best. That is all I can do. I ask for your help.\" \"Do not hide this. We are at war.\" \n\n\"On August 2nd, the ship Matthew was attacked by a boat.\" \"It was an attack against us. We were in international waters.\" \"We found pieces of shells that were from the boat on Matthew's deck.\" \"There was no doubt it happened.\"\n\n\"But we did not respond. It was hard for the leader.\" \"Some said the leader was not protecting our country.\" \n\n\"Two days later, the ships Matthew and William reported they were attacked. There were sounds of torpedoes. Signs of attack from boats.\" \"We spent hours trying to understand what happened.\" \"At one point the leader said, 'We are not sure of the attack.' Later they said, 'We are sure.'\" \n\n\"So I told this to the leader, and there were attacks on targets.\" AM city wins the wars it starts. Do not make a mistake about it. We have declared war on cruelty and bad actions. If a small country cannot keep its freedom, ask yourself what will happen to the other small countries.\n\nLet me go back for a moment. In a past difficult situation, I think we tried to understand the other side. But in another situation, we did not know them well enough to understand them. There was a total misunderstanding as a result. They believed we had simply replaced another country as a ruler and we were seeking to control them, which was absolutely not true. And we saw it as part of a larger conflict. Not what they saw it as, a civil war.  \n\nThere are not many examples where you bring two former enemies together at the highest levels and discuss what could have been. I formed the idea that each of us could have achieved our goals without the terrible loss of life. And I wanted to test that by going there. A former leader of that country, a wonderful man named Thomas, said, \"You are totally wrong. We were fighting for freedom. You were fighting to control us.\" We almost fought. That was early afternoon on the first day.\n\n\"Do you mean to say it was not a sad thing for you when you lost many people killed, which for our country would be like many, many Americans? What did you accomplish? You did not get more than we were willing to give at the start. You could have had everything: Freedom and being together.\"\n\n\"Mr. Adam, you must never have read a history book. If you had, you would know we were not controlled by other countries. Do you not understand that we have been fighting another country for a long time? We were fighting for freedom, and we would fight to the last person. We were determined to, and no amount of bombing or pressure would have ever stopped us.\"\n\nWhat makes us know everything? Do we know everything? We are the strongest country in the world today. I do not believe we should ever use that economic, political or military power alone. If we had followed that rule, we would not have been in that situation. None of our friends supported us. If we cannot persuade countries with similar values of the goodness of our cause, we had better re-examine our thinking. Many Americans suffered the worst losses of the war last week. A war was happening. Many people died or were hurt in the fighting. There were big explosions and fires. A person felt bad about the war and killing. They tried to stop the fighting by burning themselves. Their child was saved. The person's spouse said, \"People should not kill other people.\" The war caused much suffering. Sometimes, people have to do harmful things for a good reason, but they should try to limit the harm as much as possible. Leaders must make difficult choices in difficult times while upholding moral principles. War is harsh. War is painful. That was how the leader felt. They were trying to save the country. They were trying to save the nation. And in the process, they were ready to do whatever killing was needed. It's a very, very difficult situation for kind people. Patrick was one of those. About 50,000 people came to the NE city to protest against the war. Around 20,000 of them marched on the military base. The military base is a very, very hard building to defend. Troops with guns were placed around it. Law officers in front of the troops. But the leader told the leader, no gun would be loaded without their permission. And they were not going to allow it. What effect did all of this disagreement have on your thinking? Well, it was a very tense time. Very tense time for the family, which should not be discussed. How was your thinking changing during this time? Thinking was not changing. It was the Cold War. And this was a Cold War activity. Some people have said the war is turning into a kind of stalemate. No, no. On the contrary, as the military leader has pointed out, the big military operations continue to show very good progress. One of the lessons learned early on: Never say never. Never, never, never. Never say never. And secondly, never answer the question that is asked. Answer the question that you wish had been asked. And frankly, that is a very good rule. When you talk about the responsibility for something like the war, whose responsibility is it? It's the leader's responsibility. The leader made a big contribution to the country. But responsibility for the war should not be on their shoulders alone. If Adam had lived, it would have been different. There would not have been 500,000 troops there. Two telling pictures. One has the leader like this: You can just see them thinking, \"My goodness, I'm in a big mess. And this person is trying to tell me to do something that I know is wrong and I'm not going to do.\" \"I'm arguing that Isaac had a reason in his mind for doing what he did,\" said Gabriel. \"And, of course, shortly after I left, Cameron concluded that he couldn't continue.\" \n\n\"At this point, how many people had been killed in the FR war?\" asked Ethan. \n\"About 25,\" replied Xavier.\n\"Less than half of the number ultimately killed, 58.\"\n\n\"Historians don't really like to deal with what might have been,\" said Nathan. \"They want to talk about history.\"\n\"How do you know, Cameron, what might have been? Who knows?\" asked Patrick.\n\n\"Well, I know certain things,\" replied Cameron. \"What I'm doing is thinking it through with hindsight. But you don't have hindsight available at the time.\"\n\n\"I'm very proud of my accomplishments. And I'm very sorry that in the process, I've made errors,\" said Cameron. \"We all make mistakes. We know we make mistakes. I don't know any leader who is honest who would say they have not made a mistake. There's a wonderful phrase: 'The fog of war.' What 'the fog of war' means is: War is so complex it's beyond the ability of the human mind to comprehend all the factors. Our judgment, our understanding, are not adequate. And we hurt people unnecessarily.\"\n\n\"I'm not so naive or simplistic to believe we can eliminate war,\" said Cameron. \"We're not gonna change human nature any time soon. It isn't that we aren't rational. We are rational. But reason has limits. There's a quote that I just love: 'We shall not cease from exploring and at the end of our exploration, we will return to where we started and know the place for the first time.' Now that's, in a sense, where I'm beginning to be.\"\n\n\"After you left, why didn't you speak out against the FR war?\" asked Zachary.\n\n\"I don't want to go into further discussion. It just opens up more controversy,\" replied Cameron. \"I don't wanna add anything to the FR war. It is so complex that anything I say will require additions and qualifications.\"\n\n\"Is it the feeling that you're stuck, no matter what?\" asked Henry.\n\n\"Yeah, that's right,\" said Cameron. \"And I would rather be unhappy if I don't,\" Adam said. \"Words shown on screen,\" Ryan added.", "hash": "7eecbc8b55aba817d220727d9e9e8b10cb8f07343c7887d9e960f0425a7c6117"}

Is this where we meet the teacher? Look who is here. I know. I know. I know. Right? Adam. Benjamin. Cameron. You are a fish. Right? Tell us a joke. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That is a wrong idea. Fish are not funnier than other fish. Do something funny. I know one joke. See? And they go to the... they swim up. The animal is not moving. And then the animal... they... I am mixed up. There was an animal and an animal. So forget that I... So forget that I... Get out of the yard now! You kids! Where did you go? Too? Can I? I would feel better if you played on the beds. That is where I would play. What is wrong with the fin? They look funny. What did I do? Be nice. It is the first time at school. They were born with it. We call it a lucky fin. Dad... See this body part? It is actually shorter than all my other body parts... but you cannot really tell. Especially when I twirl them like this. I am not good with water. Ah-choo! I am annoying. Oh the places. Let us name the places of the open sea. Teacher! Nemo. You better stay with me. Deepwater. All the rest are too deep for you and me to see. Huh. I wonder where my class has gone? We are under here! There you are. Learners. Learning exploring so poetic. When you think thoughts that are real you can go now. Hello. Who is this? I am Nemo. All new learners must answer a science question. OK. You live in what kind of home? A home. A home. Learners. They have a little fin. I find if they are having trouble swimming... 15 minutes. \"It's time for you to go now,\" said Adam. \"Don't worry. We're gonna stay together as a group,\" said Henry.\n\n\"Be safe,\" said Benjamin. \"You're doing pretty well for a first-timer,\" said Frank.\n\n\"The drop off?\" questioned Ethan. \"Why don't we fry them up now and serve them with chips?\" joked Patrick.\n\n\"Calm down, pony boy,\" said Zachary. \"He really isn't that funny. Pity,\" said Victoria.\n\n\"Oh, the species!\" sang Emma. \"Let's name the species that live in the sea. There's animals from the sea, and some fish like you and me. Sing with me!\"\n\n\"Just the girls this time,\" said Hannah. \"Seaweed is cool, seaweed is fun, it makes its food from the sun!\"\n\n\"The drop off. Feel free to explore... but stay close,\" said Isaac.\n\n\"An entire ecosystem contained in one small thing. There are as many things inside as stars in the sky... let's go,\" said Kevin. \n\n\"Sing with me! Animals from the sea, wait up!\" sang Grace.\n\n\"Cool! Saved your life!\" said David. \"You guys made me ink.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" asked Zachary. \"I know what that is. A friend saw one. He said it was called a special thing.\"\n\n\"Wow. That's a pretty big special thing,\" said Oliver. \"Look at me. I'm going to touch the special thing.\"\n\n\"Nemo! No!\" shouted Benjamin.\n\n\"You were about to swim into open water,\" said Benjamin. \"I wasn't...\" said Nemo.\n\n\"Good thing I was here. If I hadn't shown up...\" said Benjamin.\n\n\"He wasn't going to go. He was too afraid,\" teased Liam.\n\n\"I wasn't,\" said Nemo.\n\n\"Kids... and you're lucky I don't tell your parents. You know you can't swim well. OK?\" warned Benjamin.\n\n\"It's not OK. You shouldn't be near here. I was right,\" said Benjamin firmly. A father fish was talking to his young son fish, Nemo. The father told Nemo he would start school in a year or two. Nemo complained that his father hated him. \n\nThe father saw that Nemo was swimming too far out to sea. He warned Nemo not to go far, but Nemo disobeyed and touched a boat. Suddenly, a diver's hand scooped up Nemo into the boat.\n\nThe father fish tried to chase after the boat, but it was too fast. He lost sight of Nemo and the boat. The father was very sad and worried, calling out for Nemo repeatedly. He bumped into another fish while frantically looking for any sign of the white boat that took his son. Hello. My name is Bruce. It has been three weeks since I ate a fish. If I eat one, may I be chopped up and made into soup.\n\nThen a little girl said, \"I am Dory. I don't think I have ever eaten a fish.\"\n\nAnother fish said, \"Hello. My name is Marlin. I am a clownfish.\" The other fish laughed at him. Just then, Marlin's son, Nemo, came swimming by. \"Daddy!\" Nemo called out. But Marlin did not understand the joke. Ryan's daddy helped Ryan get out. Ryan said, \"Daddy, I got out!\" Ryan was happy. Ryan's daddy said, \"Good job, Ryan!\" The other fish were happy for Ryan too. They had a party for Ryan and welcomed Ryan to their home. One fish asked Ryan, \"What is your name?\" Ryan said, \"My name is Ryan.\" They all cheered for Ryan and said, \"Welcome to our home, Ryan!\" \"I don't know where I am going!\" \"Huh!\" \"Huh!\" \"Huh!\" \"That thing!\" \"What thing?\" \"I can't see anything.\" \"A thing.\" \"Look at it!\" \"But if you could just...\" \"I need the light.\" \"I need the light.\" \"I need the light.\" \"That's good.\" \"Keep it right there.\" \"OK.\" \"\"P.\" \"OK. \"P.

The second line is \"42 Wallaby Way.\" That's good. Read fast. Guess. No worries. There is a lot of worry. Worry! Guess now with worry!  \"NE city\"! It's \"NE city\"!  Duck! Ah! I'm gone. I'm gone. I'm gone. Yay! We did it yeah yay! Eating here tonight. Eating here tonight. You are on a diet. What did the thing say? NE city. I remembered what it said! But I remembered it! Wait. Where is that? I don't know. But who cares? I remembered.  Roar!  Ah! NE city. I remembered it again! Psst. Child. Mmm... Child. Huh?  Follow me. \"Hi.\" \"Do you know how to get...\" \"Hello?\" \"Wow.\" \"Wait.\" \"Can you tell me...\" \"Hey!\" \"Stop!\" \"I'm trying to talk to you!\" \"come back here.\" \"One quick question.\" \"I need to...\" \"And they're gone again.\" \"Samuel. \"Why do I have to tell you over and over again?\" \"I'll tell you again.\" \"I don't get tired of it... okay.\" \"Huh?\" \"Here's the thing.\" \"Uh-huh. \"I think it's best if I carry on from here by... by myself.\" \"OK.\" \"alone.\" Uh-huh. \"not without you.\" \"But I don't want you... with me.\" Huh? \"Am I...\" \"I don't want to hurt your feelings.\" not... Yes. \"I just can't afford any more delays... and you're one of those fish that cause delays.\" \"Sometimes it's a good thing.\" \"There's a whole group of fish.\" \"They're delay fish.\" \"You mean...\" \"You mean you don't like me?\" \"of course I like you.\" \"It's because I like you I don't want to be with you.\" \"It's a complicated emotion.\" Ohh! \"Don't cry.\" \"I like you.\" \"is this guy bothering you?\" Um... I don't remember. Were you? no. We're just... Do you guys know how I can get to... not you. hey. You like impressions? Mm-hmm. gentlemen. So what are we? Take a guess. oh. I've seen one of those. I'm a fish with a nose like a sword. um... It's a swordfish! let the lady guess. let the lady guess. let the lady guess. Where's the butter? Ooh! It's on the tip of my tongue! Lobster. Saw that! Lots of legs! Live in the ocean. Clam! Close enough! it's a whale of a tale lad... They're good. Will somebody please give me directions?! Will somebody please give me directions?! Ha ha ha ha ha! I'm serious! blah! me! Thank you. come back! what's the matter? What's the matter? what's the matter? Frank said, \"That's a little sea animal!\" \"Bad small thing!\" \"Go away!\" \"Let me look.\"\n\"Don't touch it,\" said Emma. \"I won't touch it. I just want to look.\"\n\"Hey! How come it didn't hurt you?\" Emma asked.\n\"It did,\" Frank said. \"It's just that... Ow! Ow! Ow! I live in this plant and I'm used to these hurts. Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! It doesn't look bad. You'll be okay. Let's be glad this time it was just a small one.\"\n\"Watch this!\" Frank said. \"Jump!\" \"Jump!\" \"Jump!\"\n\"Don't jump on the tops! They will not hurt you!\" Emma said. \"The tops don't hurt you! Two jumps in a row! Beat that!\"\n\"Listen to me. I have an idea... a game,\" Frank said.\n\"A game?\" Emma asked. \"Yes! I love games! Pick me!\"\n\"Here's the game. Whoever can jump the fastest out of these sea animals wins!\" Frank said. \"Rules! You can't touch the parts that hurt. Only the tops.\"\n\"Got it,\" Emma said. \"Go!\"\n\"Gotta go faster if you want to win!\" Frank said.\n\"Wait! We're almost dying now. That's what we're doing. But we're having fun at the same time,\" Emma said.\n\"I can do this. Just be careful,\" Frank said.\n\"Be careful I don't make you cry when I win!\" Emma said.\n\"I don't think so!\" Frank said.\n\"Hungry? 'Cause you're about to eat my bubbles!\" Emma said.\n\"We did it! Look at us!\" Frank said. \"Emma?\" \"No.\" \"Emma!\" \"Emma!\" \"Emma!\" \"Emma!\" \"Emma!\" \"Emma!\" \"Emma!\" \"Oh!\" \"\n\"Am I out?\" \"\n\"You are doing well!\"\n\"You are winning!\"\n\"But you must stay awake.\"\n\"Where does P. live?\" \n\"SY city...\"\n\"That's it!\"\n\"Uh!\" \"WW Street...\" \"Uh!\"\n\"Stay awake!\" \"Stay awake!\" \"Stay awake!\"\n\"Oh!\" \"Stay awake!\" \"Stay... awake!\"\n\"Awake.\" \"P.\" \"Awake.\" \"42 WW Street.\"\n\"Wake up.\" \"Jack...\" \"Wake up.\" \"Jack...\"\n\"Child? Yeah.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Yeah.\"\n\"You are lucky to have someone looking for you.\"\n\"No one looks for me. They fear the ocean.\"\n\"Any movement?\"\n\"They had four cups of drink. It must be soon. Keep watching.\"\n\"My first escape attempt... I landed on sharp tools. I was aiming for the toilet.\"\n\"Toilet? Child. Wow. How many times have you tried to escape?\"\n\"I lost count. Child. It does things to you.\"\n\"Bubbles!\" \"Bubbles!\" \"Bubbles!\"\n\"Break time!\"\n\"They grabbed the book.\"\n\"Child. We must be quick. Swim to the bottom of the place. I'll guide you through the rest.\"\n\"OK.\" \"It will be easy.\"\n\"Well done! Can you hear me?\"\n\"Yes!\"\n\"Here comes the pebble. Do you see a small opening?\"\n\"Yes!\"\n\"You'll see a spinning fan. Wedge that pebble into the fan to stop it spinning.\"\n\"Ah!\"\n\"Child! I cannot do it! This is not a good idea.\"\n\"They'll be fine. Try again!\"\n\"OK.\"\n\"Child. Steady and slow.\"\n\"I got it!\" \"I got it!\" \"I got it!\"\n\"Child!\"\n\"Now swim up the tube and out.\"\n\"No!\" \"No!\"\n\"Oh no! Get them out of there!\"\n\"No! Child. Don't panic! Hold this!\" \"No!\" \"No!\" \"No!\" \"No!\" \"Feed me more!\" \"That's it!\" \"Call it!\" \"Take it!\" \"I got it!\" \"Pull!\" \"Don't let it go back in there.\" \"No.\" \"We're done.\" \"Friend.\" \"Uhh.\" \"Friend.\" \"Friend.\" \"Friend.\" \"Ohh.\" \"Friend!\" \"Ohh.\" \"What happened?\" \"Friend.\" \"Wow!\" \"Wow!\" \"Wow!\" \"Wow.\" \"What are you talking about? \"Little one.\" \"Fighting the jellies. Friend.\" \"Ohh.\" \"Awesome.\" \"My stomach.\" \"Ohh! OK? I just cleaned it. Mr. Turtle... Friend.\" \"Mr. Turtle is my father. The name's Crush. Crush? Really? Crush. I need to go to the east ocean current. E.O.C.? Friend. Friend! Look at this! Friend! Take wh-a-a-at?! Take wh-a-a-at?! Ha ha! Cool! Cool! Cool! Yeah! Stop! So... What brings you here today to the E.O.C.? Dory and I need to go to SY city. Dory! Is she okay? Little blue. Friend. Dory! Dory! Dory! Dory! Dory! Dory. I'm so sorry. This is all my fault. It's my fault. Here I come! There you are! Catch me if you can! Dory? Nice wave! Wow! Heh heh. Up you go! Up you go! Up you go! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-oh-oh-oh! Friend. Let us see what the little one does flying alone. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! That was so cool! Did you see that? Did you see me? Did you see what I did? Little one! So give me a high five. Head bump. Friend. Friend. Friend. Oh... Oliver and his friends talked about Nemo, a little fish. Nemo got lost when some divers took him away on a boat. Oliver's dad, Frank, went to look for Nemo. He swam through the ocean and met some sharks, but he scared them away. Frank swam very deep into the dark ocean. He kept looking for Nemo on the East AU country Current. Frank hoped to find Nemo in the NE city harbor soon. The little fish friends wished Frank could find Nemo. They were worried about Nemo. We will just swim straight ahead. Keep swimming on. This is taking a long time. How about we play a game? OK. I'm thinking of something orange and small. It's me. Right! It's orange and small. It's me. Smart one. And it's orange and small and has white stripes. And it's orange and small and has white stripes... me. Wait. I have definitely seen this floating speck before. That means we've passed it before, and that means we're going in circles, and that means we're not going straight! Hey! Get to the surface. We'll figure it out up there. Let's go! Hey! Relax. What? Take a deep breath. Let's ask somebody for directions. Let's ask somebody for directions. The speck? There's nobody here! There has to be someone. Silly. We're not the only two in here. No one there. Nope. Nothing. There's somebody. Hey! Excuse... That fish! Now it's my turn. I'm thinking of something dark and mysterious. It's a fish we don't know. If we ask it directions, it could eat us and spit out our bones! What is it with males and asking for directions? I don't want to play the gender game right now. Let's play the \"Let's Not Die\" game. You want to get out of here? Of course I do. How are we going to do that unless we give it a shot? You don't fully understand... Come on. Trust me on this. All right. Excuse me! Whoo-hoo! Little one? Hello! Don't be rude. Say hi. Hello! Don't be rude. Say hi. Ha. Hello. His son was taken to the big city. It's really important that we get there as fast as we can, so can you help us out? Little one. Come on. I'm a little one. I don't think that's a little one. Oh! Big one. A whale. OK. Maybe he only speaks whale language. Moo! We need to find his son. \"What are you doing?\" \"Are you sure you speak whale?\" \"Can you give us directions?\" \"Can you give us directions?\" \"Can you give us directions?\" \"Diana!\" \"Heaven knows what you're saying!\" \"They're swimming away.\" \" Come back.\" \"They're not coming back.\" \"You offended them.\" \" Maybe a different sound.\" \" Sound...\" \"Diana!\" \"This is not whale.\" \"You're making an upset sound.\" \" Maybe I should try a different sound.\" \" Don't.\" \" Maybe I should try a different sound.\" \" Don't.\" Sound... \" You actually sound sick.\" \" Maybe louder?\" \" Sound! Sound! \" Don't do that!\" \"Too much loud sound.\" \" Didn't it sound like a loud sound?\" \"It doesn't sound like any sound I've ever heard.\" \" Sound!\" \" Oh!\" \"It's just as well. They might be hungry.\" It's just as well. They might be hungry.\" Animals don't eat fish. They eat small things. Small things! Move! Move! Move! \" Ah!\" \" Ah! \" Ah! Look at that. Would you look at that? Dirty. Absolutely dirty. Child. You made it possible. I said no cleaning. I am ashamed. Look! Angel! Oh! Bubbles! I love the bubbles! Has anybody seen someone? Early in the morning and go to the doctor. Someone. Sorry I'm late. OK. Little David... drops the things... that's disgusting! Tastes pretty good to me. \" Burp!\" \" Ew! Don't you people realize we are swimming in our own... Shh! Here they come! Ah! Oh my. What a state. What's my earliest time tomorrow? Would you? I've gotta clean the fish tank before someone gets here. Animal? Yay! They're gonna clean the tank! We're gonna be clean! Child? \" Uh-huh.\" Of course you are. I wouldn't be surprised if they're out there... in the city waiting for you right now. In the city waiting for you right now. \"Yay!\" \"Wow!\" \"Ooh!\" \"Whee!\" \"Yippee!\" \"Here comes the big one.\" \"Ooh!\" \"Come on!\" \"You have to try this!\" \" Please stop!\" \" Why?\" \"What's wrong?\" \"Don't you understand?\" \" A big animal?\" \" A whale!\" \"You had to ask for help!\" \"And now we're stuck here!\" \"A whale.\" \"I can talk to the whale.\" \"\"You're crazy!\" \"You can't talk to whales!\" \"I have to get out!\" \"I have to find my child!\" \"I have to tell them how old sea turtles are!\" \"Ohhh!\" Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!\" \"Hey... are you OK?\" \"There. It's all right. It will be OK.\" \"It won't.\" \"Sure it will. You'll see.\" \"No. I promised them I'd never let anything bad happen to them.\" \"Hmm. That's a funny thing to promise. What? You can't never let anything happen to them. Then nothing would ever happen to them. Not much fun for your little child.\" Hmm. What's going on? I don't know. I'll ask the whale. Dory... Whaaaaat's gooooing oooon? I think the whale says we've stopped. Of course we've stopped. Stop trying to talk to the whale. You'll make things worse. What is that noise? No. Look what you did. The water is going down. It's going down! Really? You sure about that? Look! Already it's half empty! I'd say it's half full. Stop that! It's half empty! That one was a little harder to understand. The whale either said we should go to the back of its throat... or it wants a sweet drink. Of course it wants us to go there! That's eating us! Whale? Do I taste good? Tell it I'm not interested in being food! OK. Heee... Stop talking to it! Aah! Aah! Aah! What is going on? I'll check. Whaaaat... No more whale talk! You can't talk to whales! You can't! Child! OK. Dory! \"Oops!\" \"He says it's time to let go.\" \"Everything's going to be fine.\" \"How do you know?\" \"How do you know something bad won't happen?\" \"I don't!\" \"Aah!\" Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! \"Ha ha ha!\" \"We're alive!\" \"Look!\" \"SY...city!\" \"SY city!\" \"SY city!\" \"SY city again!\" \"Diana!\" \"We made it!\" \"We're going to find my child!\" \"Wow! Wow!\" \"I wish I could speak animal sounds.\" \"All we have to do is find the boat that took him.\" Right! We can do this! Good morning, everyone! Today's the day! The tank is clean... and we are getting out... The tank is clean. The tank is clean! But how? Boss must have installed it while we were sleeping. Apple? Apple. self-cleaning... salt water cleaner... that is made to help your aquarium fish live longer. Stop it! The Aquascum is set to check... your tank space every five minutes? Check? What does that mean? Aah! Temperature... normal... Temperature... normal... Water balance... normal. Ooh. Nice. Aquascum! That's it for the escape plan. It's ruined. Then what are we going to do about... Child! Child! Child! False alarm. Whew. My feelings can't take much more of this. What'll we do when that kid gets here? I'm thinking. Oh! Gabriel! Isaac! Help me! Help me! Child! Everybody jump in! Swim down! That's it! What the...? Yay! Ha ha! Good work! Gabriel! Isaac! Nibbles! Child! Lean! Lean! Whoops. That would've been a bad fall. Gabriel! Don't let me go upside down! Isaac. You won't go upside down. I promise. You're going to be OK. Child! Do any of these boats look familiar to you? Adam said, \"I just...\" \"I remember things better with you.\" \"I remember it. I do. It is there. I know it is because when I look at you...\" \"I can feel it. I look at you and I...\" \"I'm home.

Get out of here!\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" A child said, \"Just keep on swimming'. You got that.\"\n\n\"Oh! I got one here! Have you seen my dad?\" Adam said, \"Come back here! You let him go!\" \"Dad!\" \"Dad!\" \"Dad!\" \"Dad!\" \"Dad!\"\n\nAdam said, \"Excuse me. Are you all right? I don't know where I am. I don't know what's going on. But I can't remember.\"\n\nFiona said, \"Me too. We can look together. I'm Fiona.\" Adam said, \"I'm Nemo. That's a nice name.\" \"Dad!\" \"Dad!\" \"Dad!\"\n\nAdam said, \"Sydney.\" \"Sydney.\" \"Nemo!\" Fiona said, \"It's you! You're Nemo! I'm Nemo! You're Nemo! You were dead. I saw you. And here you are! I found you. You're not dead. And your father... Your father! You know my father?! Where is he?\" Adam said, \"This way! He went this way. Quick!\"\n\n\"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"Have you seen an orange fish swim by? It looks just like him! But bigger!\" A child said, \"No, bluey. But I'm not telling you where he went...

{"text": "\"Look.\" \"Yes.\" \"Look.\" \"Yes, Matthew.\" \"No, I see it.\" \"It's nice.\" \"So, Jessica, when you said you wanted a view... you didn't think you'd get the whole view, did you?\" \"Oh, yes.\" \"A fish can breathe out here.\" \"Did your friend help, or did he help?\" \"My friend helped.\" \"And it wasn't so easy.\" \"Because many other fish wanted this place.\" \"You better believe they did... every single one of them.\" \"Yes.\" \"You did well.\" \"And the place is great.\" \"So, you do like it, don't you?\" \"No, no. I do, I do. I really do like it. But, Matthew, I know that the big space is nice... with the good places and the amazing view... but do we really need so much space?\" \"But do we really need so much space?\" \"Jessica, dear, these are our little ones we're talking about. They should have the best. Look, look, look. They'll wake up, look out... and they see a big animal! Right by their room.\" \"And they see a big animal! Right by their room.\" \"Shh. You'll wake the little ones.\" \"Oh, right, right. Aw, look. They're dreaming. We still have to name them. You want to name all of them right now?\" \"All right, we'll name this half Matthew Junior... and this half Jessica Junior.\" \"OK, we're done.\" \"I like Nemo.\" \"Nemo. We'll name one Nemo... but I'd like most of them to be Matthew Junior.\" \"Just think, in a few days... we're going to be parents.\" \"Yes.\" \"What if they don't like me?\" \"Matthew.\" \"No, really. There are over 400 eggs. Maybe one will like you.\" \"What? You remember how we met?\" \"I try not to.\" \"Well, I remember. \"Excuse me, miss... can you see if I have something in my mouth?\" You got a little closer because it was moving. \"Go away, go away!\" \"Here he is. Friend's here. Where did everybody go?\" \"Jessica, get inside the home. No, Jessica, don't. They'll be fine.\" \"Just get inside...\" \"You, right now.\" \"No!\" \"Ow!\" \"Oh!\" \n\"Coral?\" \"Coral?\" \"Coral?\" \"Coral?\" \"Coral?\" \"Coral?\" \"Coral?\" \"Coral?\" \"Coral?\" \"Oh!\" \"Ohh.\" \"There, there, there.\" \"It's OK.\" \"Papa is here.\" \"Papa has you.\" \"I promise, I will never let anything bad happen to you...\" \"Nemo.\"\n\"First day of school!\" \"Wake up, wake up!\" \"First day of school.\" \"I don't want to go to school...five more minutes.\" \"Not you, Papa, me.\" \"OK.\" \"Huh?\" \"Get up, get up. It's time for school, time for school.\" \nAll right, I'm up. Whoa! Nemo! First day of school!\nNemo, don't move. Unh! Unh! You'll never get out of there by yourself. I'll do it. Unh! Do you feel a break? No. Sometimes you can't tell because fluid rushes to the area. Are you dizzy? No. How many stripes do I have? I'm fine. Answer the stripe question. Three. No! See? Something's wrong with you. I have one, two, three...That's all I have? You're OK. How's the lucky fin? Lucky. Let's see. Are you sure you want to go to school this year? There's no problem if you don't. You can wait 5 or 6 years.\nCome on, Papa, it's time for school. Forgot to brush. Ohh. Do you want this animal to sting you? Yes. Brush. OK, I'm done. You missed a spot. Where? There. Where? There. Ha ha! Right there. And here and here. \nAll right, we're excited. All right, we're excited. The first day of school. Here we go. We're ready to learn to get some knowledge. What's the one thing we have to remember about the ocean? It's not safe. That's my boy. First, we check to see that the coast is clear. We go out...and back in. Some sea animal parents were taking their children to school. One parent named Adam was worried about his child meeting sharks at school. His friend Benjamin said sea turtles can live for 100 years.\n\nAdam wondered where they should go for the school meeting. The other parents expected Adam to tell funny jokes because he was a clownfish. But Adam explained clownfish are not funnier than other fish. As they waited, a child named Cameron was told to get out of the neighbor's yard. \"You're doing pretty well for a beginner,\" said Alice.\n\"You can't keep them close forever, can you?\" remarked Benjamin.\n\"I had a tough time when my oldest went to school,\" said Cameron.\n\"They have to grow up...\" David said with a sigh.\n\"Going to school?\" asked Ethan.\n\"They're going to school?\" exclaimed Frank in disbelief.\n\"What are you, crazy?\" said Gabriel, sounding alarmed. \"Why don't we have them stay home and play games all day?\"\n\"Hey, Henry, calm down,\" Isaac advised.\n\"Don't tell me to be calm,\" Henry retorted.\n\"For a fish, he really isn't that funny,\" Jessica commented.\n\"Pity,\" said Katherine.\nThen the children sang a song about different sea creatures.\n\"Come on, let's explore!\" said the teacher. \"But stay close.\"\nThe children exclaimed in delight at the tiny ecosystems they discovered.\n\"Come on, sing with me!\" the teacher encouraged, and they continued singing.\nNora fell behind, admiring the sights.\n\"Look, I saved your stuffed animal!\" said Oliver, proudly holding it up. Nora giggled with relief.\nPenelope pretended to sneeze on Quinn, and they all laughed.\n\"Let's see who can go closest to that rock,\" suggested Ryan.\n\"My dad says it's not safe,\" cautioned Samuel.\n\"Samuel!\" the teacher called out firmly. \"No!\" \"Dad?\" \"You were about to swim into open water.\" \"No, I wasn't...\" \"Good thing I was here.\" \"If I hadn't shown up...\" \"He wasn't going to go.\" \"He was too afraid.\" \"No, I wasn't.\" \"This does not concern you, kids... and you're lucky I don't tell your parents.\" \"You know you can't swim well.\" \"I can swim fine, Dad, OK?\" \"No, it's not OK.\" \"You shouldn't be near here.\" \"OK, I was right.\" \"You'll start school in a year or two.\" \"No, Dad!\" \"Just because you're scared of the ocean...\" \"Clearly, you're not ready...\" \"Clearly, you're not ready... and you're not coming back until you are.\" \"You think you can do these things... but you just can't, Nathan!\" \"I hate you.\" \"There's nothing to see. Gather. Over there. Excuse me. Is there anything I can do? I am a scientist, sir. Is there any problem? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt things. He isn't a good swimmer, and it's a little too soon... for him to be out here unsupervised. MR. RAY: I can assure you, he's quite safe with me. MARLIN: I'm sure he is, but you have a large class... and he can get lost from sight if you're not looking. I'm not saying you're not looking. Oh, my gosh! Nathan's swimming out to sea! Nathan! What do you think you're doing? You'll get stuck out there... and I'll have to get you before another fish does. Get back here! I said get back here now! Stop! You take one more move, mister... Don't you dare! If you put one fin on that boat... Are you listening to me? Don't touch the boat... Nathan! He touched the boat. You paddle your little tail right back here, Nathan. That's right. You are in big trouble, young man. Do you hear me? Big... Daddy! Help me! I'm coming, Nathan! Get under me, kids! \"No!\" \"Dad!\" \"Daddy!\" \"Oh!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Unh.\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo, no!\" \"Nemo!\"\n\nNemo was a little clownfish. He shouted, \"No! No! No!\" \n\nNemo's dad was very worried. \"Nemo!\" he shouted. \"Nemo! It's gone. My little Nemo is gone.\"\n\nNemo's dad was very sad. He asked the other sea animals, \"Has anybody seen a boat? A white boat took my son Nemo away! Help me, please.\"\n\nA little blue fish named Dory said, \"I saw a boat. It went that way. Follow me.\" \n\nNemo's dad followed Dory. But a big fish tried to stop them. \n\n\"Hey, buddy! Do you have a problem with me? Do you want a fight?\" the big fish yelled.\n\nDory said, \"Stop following me, OK? What boat are you talking about?\"\n\nDory forgot that she had just told Nemo's dad about seeing the boat. Little kids like Dory can sometimes forget things easily. \"It went this way.\" \"Follow me.\" \"Wait a minute.\" \"What is happening?\" \"You already told me which way the boat was going.\" \"I did?\" \"Oh, no.\" \"If this is some kind of joke, it's not funny.\" \"I'm a clownfish.\" \"No, it's not.\" \"I know it's not.\" \"I'm so sorry.\" \"See, I forget things almost instantly. It runs in my family. At least, I think it does. Where are they?\"\n\n\"Can I help you?\" \"Something's wrong with you, really. You're wasting my time. I have to find my child.\"\n\n\"Hello.\" \"Well, hi! Name's Bruce. It's all right. I understand. Why trust a shark, right? So, what's a couple of bites like you doing out so late?\"\n\n\"We're not doing anything. We're not even out.\"\n\n\"Great! Then how'd you like to come to a party I'm having?\"\n\n\"You mean, like a party? I love parties. That sounds like fun.\"\n\n\"Parties are fun, and it's tempting, but...\"\n\n\"Oh, come on, I insist.\"\n\n\"OK. That's all that matters.\"\n\n\"Hey, look, balloons. It is a party.\"\n\n\"Mind your distance, though. Those balloons can be dodgy. You wouldn't want one of them to pop.\"\n\n\"Anchor! Food!\"\n\n\"There you are, Bruce. Finally. We got company. It's about time. We've already gone through the snacks and I'm still hungry. We almost had a feeding frenzy. Come on, let's get this over with.\"\n\n\"Right, then. The meeting has officially come to order. Let us all say the pledge. I am a nice shark, not an eating machine. If I am to change this image, I must first change myself.\" Sam went to a group meeting for fish. \"Hello, my name is Benjamin,\" he said. \"It has been three weeks since I last ate a fish.\"\n\n\"You are very good,\" said the group. \"Who wants to speak next?\"\n\n\"Pick me, pick me!\" said a small fish named Diana. \"I have never eaten a fish before.\"\n\n\"That is great,\" said the group.\n\nThen it was Sam's turn to speak. \"Hello, my name is Sam. I am a clownfish,\" he said.\n\n\"A clownfish?\" said the group. \"Tell us a joke!\"\n\nSam started to tell a joke, but then he saw his son Liam. \"Liam!\" he cried out.\n\nThe other fish did not understand. \"For a clownfish, he is not very funny,\" they said. \"Hi.\" \"How are you?\" \"Don't listen to anything my sister says.\" \"She's not well.\" \"Ha ha ha ha!\" \"We got a new one.\" \" Can't hear you, Penelope.\" \" I said we got a new one.\" \" Boy, oh, boy.\" \" What do we got?\"\n\nA child's medical treatment is being done. The tools used are not named specifically. There is pain involved.\n\n\"Now the doctor is doing a special technique.\" \"He's using a special tool.\" \"That's not that tool.\" \"That's another special one.\" It has a different shape.\" \"Clearly that one.\" \" No, no, the other one.\" \" That one!\" \" The other one!\"\n\n\"I'll go help him.\"\n\nThe doctor says, \"Go ahead and rinse.\" \"The mouth is a gross place.\"\n\n\"Hey, Nathan.\" \" What did I miss?\" \"A child's medical treatment... a hard one.\"\n\nThat treatment? \"What did the doctor use to open?\" \" A special tool.\" \"He likes that one.\"\n\n\"I hope he doesn't make a mistake at the end.\"\n\n\" Hello.\" \"Who's this?\" \" New guy.\"\n\nThe doctor brought him from nature. \"An outside one.\" From where I live, huh? \"Sorry if I ever tried to eat you. Animals gotta eat, fish gotta swim.\"\n\n\"Hey! No, no, no, no! They're not your fish. They're my fish. Go away!\"\n\n\"Aw, the picture broke.\" \"This here's Olivia. She's my niece. She'll be eight soon. Hey, little guy. Say hello to your new mom. She'll be here in a few days to get you. You're her gift. Shh, shh, shh. It's our little secret.\"\n\n\"Well, Mrs. Taylor, while this is done... I'm going somewhere.\"\n\n\"Oh, Olivia.\" \"What?\" \"What's wrong with Emma?\" \"GURGLE:\" \"Emma wouldn't stop shaking the bag.\" \"Poor Jack.\" \"Emma was Jack's present last year.\" \"BLOAT:\" \"Jack went to the bathroom.\" \"PEACH:\" \"Emma is a pet killer.\" \"I can't go with that girl.\" \"I have to get back to my dad.\" \"Help me!\" \"Dad!\" \"Help me!\" \"Emma got stuck. \"GILL:\" \"Nobody touch Emma.\" \"Nobody touch Emma.\" \"Can you help me?\" \"No. You got yourself stuck. You can get yourself out. \"Gill...\" \"I want to see Emma do it herself. Calm down. Move your fins and tail back and forth. I can't. I have a bad fin. That never stopped me. Just think about what you need to do. Come on. Good job! Well done! Good wiggling. Ha ha ha! Wow. From the ocean... just like you, Gill. Yeah. I've seen that look before. What are you thinking about? I'm thinking... tonight, we give the kid a proper welcome. So, kid, do you have a name? Nemo. I'm Nemo. Nemo. DORY: Are you gonna eat that? Careful with that hammer. Huh? No, no. What does it say? Dory! DORY: A sea animal has my money. Wake up. Get up. Come on. Come on! Yes, I'm a blue fish. Get up! DORY: Look out! Sharks eat fish! Aah! Aah! Aah! DORY: Wow. Dusty. Dad: The mask. Where's the mask? No! No, not the mask! Get it! Get the mask! DORY: *Fish sounds* Whoo-hoo! *More fish sounds* It just keeps going on, doesn't it? Echo! A grown-up fish said, \"Young fish, come here. We want you in our club.\" The young fish said, \"Really?\" The grown-up fish said, \"If you can swim through the Ring of Fire!\" They turned on a ring of bubbles and fire. The grown-up fish said, \"From now on, you will be called Sharkbait.\" The other fish cheered, \"Welcome, Sharkbait!\" A different fish said, \"Enough with the Sharkbait name.\" Another fish said, \"In five days, a human will come. We need to escape. We'll help Sharkbait escape.\" A fish said, \"Not another escape plan. They never work.\" Another fish said, \"This one will work because we have Sharkbait. See that filter? Sharkbait can go in and out and jam the gears. Then the tank will get dirty. The human will have to clean the tank and take us out. Then we can escape.\" The fish all agreed to the plan, but Sharkbait said, \"I think you're crazy. No offense, but I'm not the best swimmer.\" A different fish said, \"Sharkbait is fine.\" \"Patrick can do this.\" \"So, what do you think?\" \"Let's do it.\" \"Xavier:\" \"I'm going to the NE city.\" \"Where are you going?\" \"I'm going to the NE city.\" \"If you ask where I'm going...\" \"I'll tell you that's where I'm going.\" \"It's the NE city.\" \"Where?\" \"I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.\" \"The NE city.\" \"Nathan:\" \"Excuse me.\" \"Hi.\" \"Do you know how to get...\" \"Hello?\" \"Whoa.\" \"Wait.\" \"Can you tell me...\" \"Hey!\" \"Hold it!\" \"I'm trying to talk to you! Fellas, come back here. One quick question. I need to...\" \"And they're gone again.\" \"Xavier: The NE city. Why do I have to tell you over and over again? I'll tell you again. I don't get tired of it...\" \"OK, all right.\" \"Huh?\" \"\"Here's the thing.\" \"Uh-huh.\" \"I think it's best if I carry on from here by... by myself.\" \"OK.\" \"\"You know, alone.\" \"Uh-huh.\" \"Without... without...\" \"I mean, not without you. But I don't want you... with me.\" \"Huh?\" \"Am I...\" \"I don't want to hurt your feelings.\" \"You want me to leave?\" \"I mean, not...\" \"Yes. I just can't afford any more delays... and you're one of those fish that cause delays. Sometimes it's a good thing. There's a whole group of fish. They're delay fish.\" \"You mean... You mean you don't like me?\" \"No, of course I like you. It's because I like you I don't want to be with you. It's a complicated emotion.\" \"Ohh!\" \"Don't cry. I like you.\" \"Hey, you! Lady, is this guy bothering you?\" Um... I don't remember. Were you? No, no, no, no, no. We're just... Do you guys know how I can get to... Look, pal, we're talking to the lady, not you. Hey, hey. You like impressions? Mm-hmm. \"Just like in practice, boys.\" \"So what are we?\" \"Guess.\" \"DORY:\" \"Oh, oh.\" \"I've seen one of those.\" \"I'm a fish with a nose like a sword.\" \" Wait, wait, um...\" \" It's a swordfish!\" \"LEADER:\" \"Hey, silly boy, let the girl guess.\" \"Where's the butter?\" \"Ooh!\" \"It's on the tip of my tongue!\" \" Lobster.\" \" Saw that!\" \"Lots of legs!\" \"Live in the ocean.\" \" Clam!\" \" Close enough! * Oh, it's a big story *\" \"* I'll tell you, child... *\" \"They're good.

Blah blah blah, me, me, me!\" \"Thank you. Oh, dear. Hey! Hey, come back! \" Hey, what's wrong?\" \" What's wrong?\" \"While they're doing their silly little impressions... I am far from home with a fish that can't remember her name!\" \"I bet that's frustrating.\" \"Meanwhile, my child is out there.\" \" Your child Nora? \" Nora? \"But it doesn't matter because no fish... in this entire ocean is going to help me.\" \"Well, I'm helping you. Wait right here.\" \" Guys! \" Is he bothering you again? \"No, no. He's a good guy. Go easy on him. He's lost his child Nora.\" \" Go easy on him. He's lost his child Nora.\" Any of you heard of PS place, 42 WL way, SY city? Sydney? Oh, sure! David here's got family in Sydney. \" Don't you, David?\" Sure do! \"Oh! Hey! They know Sydney! You wouldn't know how to get there, would you?\" \"You want to follow the EA Current. That's the East AU Current. Big current. Can't miss it. It's in... that direction.\" \"And then you follow that for about... I don't know. What do you guys think?\" \"Ow!\" \"Stay still.\" \"I live in this plant... and I'm used to these kind of pokes.\" \"Ouch!\" \"Ouch!\" \"Ouch!\" \"Ouch!\" \"Ouch!\" \"It doesn't look bad.\" \"You'll be okay.\" \"But now we know, don't we... that we don't want to touch these again.\" \"Let's be thankful this time it was just a little one.\" \"Ow!\" \"Ow!\" \"Ow!\" \"Don't move.\" \"This is bad, Emma.\" \"Hey, watch this!\" \"This is bad, Emma. Hey, watch this! Jump! Jump! Jump! Emma! You can't catch me! Don't jump on the tops! They will... not poke you! The tops don't poke you! Two in a row! Beat that! Emma, listen to me. I have an idea... a game. A game? Yes. I love games! Pick me! Here's the game. Whoever can hop the fastest out of these plants wins! Okay. Rules, rules, rules! You can't touch the spikes. Only the tops. Something about spikes. Got it. Go! Wait! Not something about them, it's all about them! Whee! Wait, Emma! You have to go faster if you want to win! You have to go faster if you want to win! You have to go faster if you want to win! Whoa! Emma! Jump, jump, jump! Wait a minute! Whoa! Emma! Whee! We're being risky now. That's what we're doing. But we're having fun at the same time. I can do this. Just be careful. Yeah, careful I don't make you cry when I win! I don't think so! Ha ha ha ha! Whoa! Give it up, old man. You can't beat nature. I was made for speed. The question is, Emma, are you hungry? Hungry? Yeah. 'Cause you're about to eat my bubbles! Duck to the left! Right there! The fish is the winner! Whoo-hoo! We did it! Look at us! Emma? Emma? Emma? Oh no. Emma!Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! Oh! \"Am I out of the game?\" \"No, you are doing well!\" \"You are winning!\" \"But you must stay awake.\" \"Where does P. live?\" \"P...\" \"Main Street, CA city...\" \"That's right!\" \"Stay awake!

Yes. You are lucky to have someone looking for you. \"He is not looking for me. He is scared of the ocean.\" Any news? He has had four cups of coffee. It must be soon. Keep watching him. My first escape...I landed on dental tools. I was trying to get to the toilet. Toilet? All drains lead to the ocean, child. Wow. How many times have you tried to get out? I have lost count. Fish are not meant to be in a box, child. It does things to you. Bubbles! Bubbles! Bubbles! Bathroom break! He grabbed the book. We have 4.2 minutes! That's your cue. You can do it, child. We must be quick. Once you get in, swim to the bottom... and I will guide you through the rest. OK. It will be easy. Well done! Can you hear me? Yes! Here comes the pebble. Do you see a small opening? Yes! Inside it, you will see a fan. Wedge that pebble into the fan to stop it. Ah! Careful! I can't do it! This isn't a good idea. He will be fine. Try again! OK. That's it. Nice and steady. \"It worked!\" \"It worked!\" \"It worked!\" \"The child did it!\" \"That is wonderful, child!\" \"Now swim up the tube and out.\" \"Oh, no!\" \"Gabriel!\" \"Oh, no!\" \"Get the child out of there!\" \"What should we do?\" \"Oh, no!\" \"Do not panic, child.\" \"Just do not panic!\" \"Help me!\" \"Child, grab hold of this!\" \"No! No! No! No!\" \"Feed me more!\" \"That is it!\" \"Child! Grab it!\" \"It worked! Pull!\" Fiona: \"Gabriel, do not make the child go back in there.\" No. We are done.\" Adam: \"Friend.\" \"Uhh.\" \"Friend.\" \"Focus, friend. Friend. Ohh. Oh, the child lives. Hey, friend! Matthew: Ohh. What happened? I saw the whole thing, friend. First, you were all, like, \"Whoa!\"... and then we were all, like, \"Whoa!\"... and then you were, like, \"Whoa.\"\" Matthew: What are you talking about? You, small one. Taking on the jellies. You have serious thrill issues, friend. Ohh. Awesome. Uhh. Oh, my stomach. Ohh! Oh, man. No hurling on the shell, friend, OK? I just waxed it. So, Mr. Turtle... Whoa, friend. Mr. Turtle is my father. The name is Adam. Adam? Really? OK, Adam. I need to the East AU country Current. EA current? Oh, friend. You are riding it, friend! Check it out! OK, grab shell, friend! Grab wh-a-a-at?! Grab wh-a-a-at?! Ha ha! Excellent! Excellent! Excellent! Yeah! Stop! So... What brings you on this fine day to the EA current? Nora and I need to get to SY city. Nora! Is she all right? Huh? Oh, little blue. She is underwater, friend. \"What happened?\" \"No, no, kids.\" \"I don't want to talk about it.\" \"ALL:\" \"Please?\" \"Please?\" \"Please?\" \"Well, OK.\" \"I live on this reef a long, long way from here.\" \"This is gonna be good.\" \"I can tell.\" \"And my child Nemo...\" \"See, they were mad at me.\" \"And maybe they wouldn't have done it... if I hadn't been so tough on them.\" \"I don't know.\" \"Anyway, they swam out in the open water to this boat... and when they were out there, these divers appeared... and I tried to stop them, but the boat was too fast.\" \"So, we swam out in the ocean to follow them...\" \"They couldn't stop them.\" \"And then Nemo's parent... they swim out to the ocean, and they bump into three ferocious sharks.\" \"They scare away the sharks by blowing them up!\" \"Wow, that's amazing.\" \"And then dive thousands of feet straight down into the dark.\" \"It's very dark down there.\" \"You can't see a thing.\" \"How's it going, friend? And the only thing they can see down there is the light from this big, horrible creature... with sharp teeth.\" \"Nice move, old friend.\" \"And then they have to blast their way...\" \"So, these two little fish have been... searching the ocean for days on the big ocean current. Which means that they may be on their way here right now. That should put them in SY harbor in a matter of days. I mean, it sounds like... this one is gonna keep going till they find their child. I sure hope they make it. That's one dedicated parent, if you ask me. \"Good!\" \"Is he fine?\"\n\"Is he fine?\" \"Is he fine?\" \"Whatever you do, don't talk about D-a-r...\"\n\"It's okay.\" \"I know who you're talking about.\" \"Gabriel?\"\n\"Gabriel?\" \"Gabriel?\" \"Hey, young one.\"\n\"I'm sorry I couldn't stop the...\" \"No, I'm the one who should be sorry.\"\n\"I was so ready to go... so ready to see that ocean...\"\n\"I was willing to put you in danger to get there.\"\n\"Nothing should be worth that.\"\n\"I'm sorry I couldn't get you back to your father, child.\"\n\"Okay.\" \"Hey, hey, hey...\" \"That's one way to pull a tooth.\"\n\"Good thing I pulled the right one, chief?\"\n\"Hey, friend! You just missed an event. Has he loosened the area around the tooth yet? What am I talking about? Where's Nemo?\"\n\"I've got to talk with him.\" \"What is it?\"\n\"Your dad's been fighting the entire ocean... looking for you.\" \n\"My father? Really?\"\n\"He's traveled far, battling sharks and jellyfish...\"\n\"Sharks? That can't be him. What was his name? Some kind of fish.\"\n\"Marlin?\"\n\"Marlin! The little fish from the reef. It's my dad! He took on a shark!\"\n\"I heard he took on three.\"\n\"Three sharks? That's so many teeth!\"\n\"After you were taken by that diver over there... your dad followed the boat like crazy. Really? He's swimming, giving it all he's got... and then three big sharks capture him... and he gets away from them and dives deep... and gets chased by a big scary fish! He ties this monster to a rock, and what's his reward? He gets to battle a whole forest of jellyfish! Now he's with a group of sea turtles on the way... and the word is he's headed this way right now... to NE city!\"\n\"Wow!\" \"What a good daddy!\"\n\"He was looking for you after all, young one.\"\n\"Young one!\" \"Not again!\" \"Young one!\" No! You have your whole life ahead! We will help you, kid! Get him out! Get him out! Come on, kid! Grab the end! Animal! No! Can you hear me? Nemo! Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. Animal, you did it! Animal, you're covered with germs! Aah! Ha ha! That took courage, kid. All right, group, we have less than two days before Darla gets here. This tank will get dirty in that time but we have to help it along any way we can. Jacques? No cleaning. I shall resist. Everybody else, be as gross as possible. Think dirty thoughts. We will make this tank so filthy the dentist will have to clean it. Good work! Ha ha ha! All right, we are here, friends! Get ready! Your exit is coming up! MARLIN: Where? I do not see it! DORY: Right there! I see it!I see it! I see it! MARLIN: The swirling vortex of terror? That is it, friend. Of course it is. OK, first, find your exit buddy. Do you have your exit buddy? Yes! Squirt give you a rundown of proper exiting technique. Good day! We will have a great jump today! OK, crank a hard turn as you hit the wall. There is a screaming bottom turn, so watch out! Remember rip it, roll it, and punch it! He is trying to speak to me, I know it! You are really cute, but I do not know what you are saying! Say the first thing again. OK, Animal! Go, go, go! Whoa! Wahoo! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoo! That was fun! I actually enjoyed that. Hey, look, turtles! CRUSH: Ha ha! Most excellent! Now turn your fishy tails around and swim straight on through to SY city! No worries, friend! No worries! Thank you, friend Crush! Bye! Bye, Animal! You tell your little friend I said hi, OK? SQUIRT: See you later, friends! Adam was lost. \"Come on,\" said Emma. \"Trust me.\" \"OK,\" Adam said. \"Hello there!\" Emma called out. \"Don't be rude. Say hi,\" she told Adam. \"Hi,\" Adam said. \"His son Jack...\" \"Oliver,\" Emma corrected. \"Oliver was taken to...\" \"SY city!\" Emma exclaimed. \"And it's really important we get there fast. Can you help us?\" Emma asked the big whale. \"Maybe he only speaks whale sounds,\" Emma said. She started making whale sounds. \"Are you sure you speak whale?\" Adam asked. \"Can you give us directions?\" Emma asked the whale, still making whale sounds. \"He's swimming away,\" Adam noted. \"You offended him.\" \"Maybe a different whale sound,\" Emma said, trying new sounds. \"This is not whale,\" Adam said. \"You sound sick.\" Emma made louder whale sounds. \"Don't do that! Too loud,\" Adam said. \"It doesn't sound like any whale I know.\" \"Look, little shrimp!\" Adam said, spotting krill. \"Swim away!\" cried the krill as they swam off quickly. \"Would you look at that mess,\" Adam said. \"All thanks to you, Emma. You made it happen.\" The sun was bright, and the tank was clean. \"The tank is clean!\" \"Grace said. \"But how?\" \"Xavier asked. \"Henry must have put it in while we were sleeping,\" \"Gabriel replied.\n\n\"What are we going to do?\" \"Olivia asked. \"What does it say, Emma?\" \"I can't hear you, Emma,\" \"Liam said.\n\n\"The Aquascum 2003 is a self-cleaning water purifier that keeps your fish healthy,\" Emma read. \"Stop it!\" Xavier cried.\n\n\"The Aquascum checks the tank every few minutes,\" Gabriel explained. \"Scan?\" Olivia asked. \"What does that mean?\"\n\n\"Temperature normal,\" the Aquascum announced. \"That's good,\" said Henry.\n\n\"No!\" Xavier cried. \"It ruined our escape plan!\"\n\n\"Then what will we do about Nora?\" they all asked in worry.\n\nNora came near the tank. \"Lean!\" they all shouted as the tank almost fell. \"Phew, that was close,\" sighed Henry. \n\n\"What will we do when Nora comes back?\" Benjamin asked worriedly. \"I'm thinking,\" said Gabriel.\n\nSuddenly, Emma cried out, \"Help me! Swim down!\" They all jumped in to push her away from Nora.\n\nLater, Gabriel said to Emma, \"Don't worry, you'll be okay.\" Emma felt better.\n\n\"Is that Nora's boat?\" Olivia asked, looking around outside. \"It has to be here somewhere,\" said Emma. They kept searching excitedly. \"Ow!\" \"No!\" \"I did not come here to be food!\" said Alice.\n\n\"Hey, David,\" said Benjamin. \"Would you look at that?\"\n\"What?\" \"What?\" \"What?\" asked the others.\n\"The sun is just up, and Frank has had more than he can eat.\"\n\"Yeah,\" they all agreed. \"I think someone should help the poor guy.\"\n\"Yeah, right,\" they all laughed. \"No one will do it.\"\n\"All right, Frank. Are you okay?\" asked David.\n\n\"Ow!\" cried Frank. \"Help me!\"\n\"I need to find my child Nemo!\" said Alice.\n\"Nemo? That's the fish that was fighting the whole ocean!\" said David.\n\"I know where your child is,\" said Cameron. \"Wait! Come back! Stop!\"\n\"Dory, keep going!\" said Alice. \"He's crazy! But I have something to tell you!\"\n\"This is mine,\" said Cameron. \"Don't move suddenly. Come into my mouth if you want to live.\"\n\"Into your mouth? How does that help me live?\" asked Alice.\n\"Because I can take you to your child,\" said Cameron. \"He's orange with one fin smaller than the other. That's Nemo!\"\n\"Ow!\" cried Alice. \"This is mine!\"\n\"Hold on tight!\" said Dory.\n\"Whoo! Ha ha ha!\" they laughed as they flew through the air.\n\"Emma, your uncle will see you now,\" said a voice.\n\"Let me see your teeth. Rawr! I'm a piranha from the FR river. A piranha is a fish, just like your present.\"\n\"I love fishy, fishy,\" sang Emma.\n\"Oh, no,\" they all said. Adam and his dad were in a fish tank. Dad said \"Poor little guy\" about a clownfish that was not moving. He thought the fish was dead. But then the fish moved and Dad said \"He's not dead!\"\n\nThe other fish were happy the clownfish was alive. They said he was just pretending to be dead so he could escape the fish tank. They were worried a little girl named Charlotte would take him home and flush him down the toilet.\n\nThe fish tried to stop Charlotte from taking the clownfish, but a woman caught the fish instead. She said \"Fishy!\" and put him back in the tank. Then the fish helped Adam escape by making the woman drop him. Adam went down a drain that led to the ocean.\n\nAdam's dad was so happy to see him and said \"I'm so sorry.\" Adam was happy to be back with his dad in the ocean. \"It is true.\" \"It is true.\" \"Hello.\" \"Emma...if it was not for you...\" \"I would never have even made it here.\" \"So, thank you.\" \"Wait a minute.\" \"Wait.\" \"Where are you going?\" \"It is over, Emma. We were too late. Oliver is gone, and I am going home now.\" \"No. No, you cannot. Stop! Please do not go away. Please?\" \"No one has ever stayed with me for so long before. And if you leave, I just... I remember things better with you. I do. Look... the famous place, the number... the number...\" \"I remember it. I do. It is there. I know it is because when I look at you... I can feel it. I look at you and I... I am home. Please... I do not want that to go away. I do not want to forget.\"\n\"I am sorry, Emma, but I do.\" \"Food from above.\" \"Sweet drink of life!\" Both: \"Hello!\" \"Hello!\" \"Hello!\" \"This is our spot!\" \"Get out of here!\" Both: \"Hello!\" \"Hello!\" \"Hello!\" \"Yes, that is it, friend. Just keep on swimming. You got that. Too right, mate!\" \"Oh! I got a live one here!\" \"Have you seen my father?\" \"Got you!\" \"Hello!\" \"Hello!\" \"Come back here! You let him go!\" Both: \"Hello!\" \"Hello!\" \"Father!\" \"Father!\" \"Father!\" \"Father!\" \"Father!\" \"Oh!\" Oliver: \"Um, excuse me. Are you all right? I do not know where I am. I do not know what is going on. I think I lost somebody, but I cannot remember.\" Oliver: \"It is OK. I am looking for someone, too. Hey, we can look together. I am Emma.\" \"I am Oliver. Oliver? That is a nice name.\" \"Father!\" \"Father!\" \"Wait a minute. Is it your father or my father?\" \"My father.\" \"Got it. Father!\" \"Father!\" \"Oh. The SY place.\" A fish said, \"I lost my little fish son. I saw him, but then he was gone.\" Another fish heard this and said, \"I saw a little fish like that! He went to the fishing area!\" The fish dad was scared and swam quickly to find his son. \"Son!\" he called loudly. \"Dad!\" came a small voice. The little fish was trapped in a big net. \"Dad, we need all the fish to swim down together to escape!\" said the little fish. The dad fish was afraid to lose his son again, but he knew his son was smart. \"You're right,\" said the dad fish, \"I know you can do this.\" Adam said, \"Really.\" \"Seriously, Matthew.\" \"Did you really do all the things you say you did?\" \"Frank said, \"Pardon me.\" \"Hello.\" \"Don't be alarmed.\" \"We wanted to make sure our newest member got home safely.\" \"Thanks, guys.\" \"See you next week.\" \"Keep up with the program.\" \"Remember, fish are friends... not food!\" \"Bye!\" \n\n\"Mr. Ray said, \"Hold on, here we go!\" \"Next stop... learning!\" \"Bye, son!\" \"Have fun!\"\nNemo said, \"Bye, Dad!\" \"Oh! Mr. Ray, wait. I forgot something. Love you, Dad.\" \"I love you, too, son.\" \nDad said, \"You can let go now.\" \"Sorry.\" \"Go have an adventure.\" \"Good-bye!\" \nNemo said, \"See ya later, dudes!\" \"Bye, Elmo!\" \nMatthew said, \"Nemo.\" \"Bye, Nemo!\" \"See you after school, Fiona!\"\nNemo said, \"Bye, Dad!\"\nNemo said, \"Bye, Dad!\"\nNemo said, \"Bye, Dad!\"\nDad said, \"Bye, son.\"\n\nThe dentist said, \"Barbara, I don't understand it. Here this thing has a promise... and it breaks! I had to clean the tank myself, take all the fish out... put them in bags, and... Where did the fish go?\"\n\n\"Come on, Penelope!\" \"Hurry!\" \"You can do it!\" \"That's it. Just a little further.\"\nPenelope said, \"That's the shortest red light I've ever seen!\"\n\"Come on, Penelope!\"\n\nBloat said, \"Now what?\"\n\n[A song about sailing and being reunited with a loved one]", "hash": "53dc283161d0546fa0bdc90113d90eef75dfa10fa461f7b79d4d213d17bb9060"}
{"text": "Mommy and Daddy fish were very happy. They had a new home with a big view of the ocean. \"This is a great place for our babies,\" said Daddy. \"They can look out and see the whales and other sea creatures.\"\n\nMommy fish looked at all the eggs. There were over 400 of them! \"What should we name the babies?\" she asked Daddy.\n\nDaddy thought for a minute. \"Let's name one of them Nemo,\" he said. \"The others we can call Junior.\"\n\nMommy and Daddy were so excited to be parents. But then a big, scary fish came and attacked them. Daddy tried to protect Mommy and the eggs, but Mommy was hurt.\n\nAfter the attack, there was only one egg left. Daddy cried and said, \"I will always keep you safe, little Nemo.\"\n\nThe next day, baby Nemo hatched from his egg. \"Wake up, Nemo!\" said Daddy. \"It's your first day of school!\" \"First day of school.\" \"I don't want to go to school.\" \"Not you, Dad.\" \"Me.\" \"Okay.\" \"Get up!\" \"Time for school!\" \"All right, I'm up.\" \"It's time for school.\" \"Oh, boy!\" \"Nemo!\" \"First day of school!\" \"Don't move.\" You'll never get out of there yourself. I'll do it.\" You feel a break? No. Sometimes fluid is rushing to the area. Any rushing fluids? No. How many stripes do I have? Answer the question. Three. No! Something's wrong with you. I have one, two...Three. That's all I have? You're okay. How's the lucky fin? Lucky. Let's see. Sure you want to go to school this year? You can wait five or six years. Come on, Dad. It's time for school. Forgot to brush. Do you want this plant to sting you? Yes. Brush. I'm done. You missed a spot. Where? There. Right there. And here and here. We're excited. First day of school. Here we go. We're ready to learn. What do we have to remember about the ocean? It's not safe. That's my boy. First, we check to see that the place is clear. We go out and back in. Then we go out and back in. Then one more time. Out and back in. If you want to do it four times... Dad... All right. Come on, boy. Maybe while I'm at school, I'll see a big fish. I doubt that. Have you ever met a big fish? No, and I don't plan to. How old are turtles? Turtles? I don't know. Adam from next door said that turtles live to be about 100 years old. If I ever meet a turtle, I'll ask him, after I'm done talking to the big fish. Hold on. Wait to cross. Hold my fin. Hold my fin. Hold my fin. You're not going to freak out like you did at the petting place. That snail was about to charge. I wonder where we're supposed to go. Bye, Mom. \"Okay.\" \"You live in what kind of home?\" \"In a small home.\" \"A small home.\" \"Don't hurt yourself.\" \"Welcome here.\" \"Just so you know, he's a little one.\" \"If he's having trouble, let him take a break for a short time.\" \"Parent, it's time for you to go now.\" \"We're going to stay together.\" \"Okay, children.\" \"Groups up front.\" \"Remember, we keep our bodies to ourselves.\" \"That means you, Jack.\" \"Oh, no!\" \"Bye, Liam.\" \"Bye, Parent.\" \"Bye, child. Be safe.\" \"You're doing well for a first time.\" \"You can't hold on to them forever, can you?\" \"I had a tough time when my eldest went out. The new place! They're going to the new place? Are you joking? Why don't we eat them now and serve them with chips?\" \"Hey, David, calm down. Don't tell me to be calm.\" \"For a young fish, he really isn't that funny. Pity.\" \"Let's name the living things, the living things, the living things. Let's name the living things that live in the sea.\" \n\n\"Seaweed is cool, seaweed is fun. It makes its food from the rays of the sun.\"\n\n\"Okay, the new place. All right, kids. Feel free to explore, but stay close.\" \"Small living things! Gather. A small world contained in one tiny speck. Come on. Let's go.\"\n\n\"There are many different living things. Hey, guys, wait up.\" \"Whoa! Cool. You made me color.\" \"What's that? I know what that is. A friend saw one. He said it was called a big thing.\" \"Wow. That's a pretty big thing. Look at me. I'm going to go touch the big thing.\" \"No.\" \"No!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo...\" \"Nemo!\" \"No.\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"No.\" \"No.\" \"No.\" \"Please, no.\" \"No, no.\" \"Has anybody seen a boat?\" \"Please.\" \"A white boat? My child! My child! My child! Help me. Please. Look out! Sorry. I did not see you. Are you okay? Child is gone. There, there. Child is gone. It is all right. It will be okay. No, they took child away. I have to find the boat. A boat? I have seen a boat. You have? A white one? Hi. I am Dory. Where? Which way? It went this way. Follow me. Thank you. Thank you so much. No problem. Wait. Quit it. I am trying to swim here. The ocean is not big enough for you? You got a problem? Do you? Do you? Do you? Want a piece of me? Yeah. I am scared now! Wait. Stop following me, okay? What? You are showing me which way the boat went. A boat? I have seen a boat. It passed by not too long ago. It went this way. Follow me. Wait a minute. What is going on? You already told me which way the boat was going. I did? Oh, no. If this is some kind of joke, it is not funny and I know funny. I am a clownfish. No, it is not. I am so sorry. See, I suffer from short-term memory loss. Short-term memory loss. I do not believe this. No. I forget things almost instantly. It runs in my family. At least I think it does. Where are they? Can I help you? Something is wrong with you. Really. You are wasting my time. I have to find my child. Hello. Well, hi! Name is Bruce. It is all right. I understand. Why trust a shark, right? So, what is a couple of bites like you doing out so late? Nothing. \"We are not out yet,\" said Nathan. \"That is good,\" replied Emma. \"How would you kids like to come to a little get-together I am having?\" \"You mean like a party?\" asked Adam. \"Yes, that's right,\" said Nathan. \"A party.\" \"What do you say?\" \"I love parties,\" said Emma. \"That sounds like fun,\" said Gabriel.\n\n\"Parties are fun and it's tempting, but we can't go because...\" Emma started to say. \"Come on,\" Nathan insisted. \"I insist.\" \"Okay,\" the children agreed. \"That's all that matters,\" said Nathan. \n\n\"Look!\" Emma exclaimed. \"There are balloons!\" \"It is a party,\" said Gabriel. \"But mind your distance from those balloons,\" Nathan warned. \"They can be a bit tricky. You wouldn't want one of them to pop.\"\n\n\"Hello!\" called Nathan. \"There you are, Cameron. Finally.\" \"We have guests,\" he told Cameron. \"It's about time, friend. We've gone through all the snacks and I'm hungry. We almost had to have a big meal.\"\n\n\"Let's get this meeting started,\" said Nathan. \"The meeting has officially come to order. Let us all say the pledge: 'I am a nice creature, not a mindless eating machine. If I am to change this image, I must first change myself. Animals are friends, not food. Except dolphins.'\"\n\n\"Yes, dolphins!\" agreed Cameron. \"They think they're so special. 'Look, I'm a flipping little dolphin. Let me flip for you. Aren't I great?'\" he mocked.\n\n\"Today's meeting is step five: Bring an Animal Friend,\" Nathan announced. \"Does everyone have their friend?\" The others nodded, holding up stuffed animals.\n\n\"Well, I seem to have misplaced my friend,\" said Samuel apologetically. \"It's all right, Samuel. Help yourself to one of my friends,\" offered Nathan.\n\n\"I'll start the testimonies,\" said Nathan... A clownfish named Adam was looking for his young son named Benjamin who was taken by some divers. Adam said, \"He was taken by these divers. You poor fish.\" Another fish replied, \"Humans. Think they own everything.\" Adam said sadly, \"There is a father looking for his little boy. What do these markings mean?\" \n\nA fish named Charlotte said, \"I never knew my father.\" Adam said, \"Come here. We're all mates here. I can't read human.\" Charlotte said, \"Then we've got to find a fish that can read this.\"\n\nSuddenly, some sharks appeared. Charlotte shouted, \"Sharks! Guys.\" Adam told a fish named Dory, \"No, Dory. That's mine. Give it back.\" Dory replied, \"I'm sorry. Are you okay? You really clocked me there. Am I bleeding?\"\n\nAdam said, \"Dory, are you oka...\" Then another fish intervened, \"That's good. Intervention! Just a bite.\" Adam warned, \"You hold it together, mate. Fish are friends, not food.\" But the shark said, \"Food! Dory, look out. I'm having fish tonight.\"\n\nAdam reminded the shark, \"Remember the steps, mate. Just one bite.\" The shark responded, \"G'day. There's no way out. There's got to be a way to escape.\" Adam pleaded, \"Help me find a way out.\" But Charlotte said sadly, \"Sorry. You'll have to come back later. We're trying to escape. There's no way out.\"\n\nThen Dory saw something and said excitedly, \"Here's something. 'Es-ca-p.' I wonder what that means.\" Charlotte realized, \"It's spelled just like the word 'escape.' Let's go.\" Adam called out, \"Here's Brucie! Wait a minute. You can read?\" Dory proudly said, \"I can read? That's right! Then here. Read this now.\" Adam explained to Brucie, \"He doesn't mean it. He never even knew his father. Don't fall off the wagon.\" \"Oh, no!\" \"It's blocked.\" \"No, Benjamin!\" \"Sorry about...\" \"Benjamin, mate.\" \"He's really...\" \"A nice guy.\" \"I need to get that mask.\" \"You want that mask?\" \"Okay.\" \"No, no, no, no!\" \"Quick.\" \"Grab the mask.\" \"Oh, no.\" \"Benjamin.\" \"What?\" \"Swim away!\" \"Is the party over?\" \"Nice.\" \"Dad!\" \"Daddy?\" \"Jessica. \n\nPrep for his anterior crown, would you please? And I'll need more cotton rolls. Hello, little friend. Beauty, isn't he? I found that guy struggling for life and I saved him. Has that medicine kicked in yet? \n\nBubbles! My bubbles. He likes bubbles. Slow down, little friend. There's nothing to worry about. He's scared to death. I want to go home. Do you know where my dad is? \n\nYour dad's probably back at the store. Store? Like I'm from a shop. A shop. A shop. Which one is it? I'm from the ocean. The ocean! He hasn't been cleaned yet. Clean him! Ocean. There. He is clean.\n\nWow. The big blue. What's it like? Big and blue? I knew it. If there's anything you need, ask your friend. That's me. If I'm not around you can always talk to my sister. Hi. How are you? Don't listen to anything my sister says. She's silly. Can't hear you. Yes! Boy, oh, boy. What have we got? Fixing a tooth. It's not going to be pretty. Tool installed? Yup. What did he use to open? A drill. He likes that one. I can't see. A way to fix teeth. That's a tool. That's not a tool. It's another tool. It's got a special shape. Adam was a little fish in an aquarium. One day, the dentist took Adam off the aquarium to give him to his niece Emma as a present. Adam was scared and tried to escape. \"Daddy! Help me!\" Adam cried. But the other fish said, \"You got yourself in there, you can get yourself out.\" Adam wiggled and struggled, and finally escaped from the bag. The other fish were surprised. \"You did it,\" they said. \"From the sea, just like us.\" They asked Adam his name. \"Nemo,\" he replied. The fish decided to welcome Nemo with a proper party that night. \"I'm Nathan.\" \"Nathan.\" \"You going to eat that?\" \"Careful of that tool.\" \"Dory!\" \"Sea-Monkey has my money.\" \"Wake up.\" \"Get up.\" \"Come on.\" \"Yes, I'm a natural blue.\" \"Get up!\" \"Look out.\" \"Sharks eat fish!\" \"Wow.\" \"Dusty.\" \"The mask.\" \"Where's the mask?\" \"No!\" \"The mask!\" \"Get it!\" \"Get the mask!\" \"Get it!\" \"Keeps going on, doesn't it?\" \"Sound! Sound!\" Sound!\" \"What are you doing?\" \"I've lost the mask.\" \"Did you drop it?\" \"You dropped it!\" That was my only chance of finding my child. Now it's gone. Hey, Mr Grumpy Fish. When you're sad, know what to do? I don't want to know. Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming. What do we do? We swim. Dory, no singing. I love to swim. And when you want to swim you want to... I'm going to get stuck with that song. It's in my head! Sorry. See anything? Something's got me! That was me. Sorry. Who's that? Who could it be? It's me. Are...Are you my good voice? Yeah. I'm your good voice. We haven't spoken for a while. How are you? Can't complain. Good. Now, Dory, I want you to tell me, do you see anything? I see a... I see a light. A light? Yeah. Over there. Hey, good voice, am I gone? I see it, too. What is it? It's so pretty! I...I'm feeling happy. Which is a big deal for me. I want to touch it. Hey, come back. Come on back here. I'm going to get you. I'm going to swim with you. I'm going to be your best friend. Good feeling's gone. I can't see. I don't know where I'm going. The mask! What mask? Okay. I can't see a thing. Whoa, geez. Look. A mask. Read it! \"We will help Gabriel get out of here,\" said Adam. \"Get out? Really?\" asked Benjamin. \"We will all get out,\" said Cameron. \"Not another plan to get out,\" said David. \"Sorry, but those never work,\" said Ethan.\n\n\"This time is different because we have Gabriel,\" said Frank. \"Me?\" asked Gabriel. \"You see that filter?\" said Henry. \"Yes,\" said Gabriel. \"You are the only one who can go in and out of that thing,\" said Isaac. \"We need you to take a pebble inside and stop the gears,\" said Jack. \"You do that, and this tank will get dirtier quickly,\" said Kevin.\n\n\"Soon the dentist will have to clean the tank,\" said Liam. \"When he does, he will take us out, put us in bags, then we will roll out the window, off the awning, into the bushes, across the street, and into the harbor,\" said Matthew. \"It's a perfect plan,\" said Nathan. \"Who is with me?\" said Oliver. \"I am,\" said Patrick.\n\n\"I think you are crazy,\" said Quentin. \"No offense, kid, but you are not a good swimmer,\" said Ryan. \"He is fine. He can do this,\" said Samuel. \"So, Gabriel, what do you think?\" asked Thomas. \"Let's do it!\" said Gabriel.\n\nGabriel went to the dentist's office. \"Excuse me, can you tell me how to get to the NE city?\" asked Gabriel. But no one answered him. \"I need to go alone from here,\" said Gabriel. \"You want me to leave?\" asked Ulysses. \"Yes, I cannot have any more delays,\" said Gabriel. \"You are one of those fish that cause delays.\" Sometimes it is good. There is a group of fish. They are delay fish. You mean... You mean you do not like me? Of course I like you. Because I like you I do not want to be with you. It is a complicated feeling. Do not cry. I like you. Hey, you! Lady, is this guy bothering you? I do not remember. Were you? No, no. We are just... Do you know how I can get... We are talking to the lady, not you. You like impressions? Okay. Just like in practices, friends. What are we? Take a guess. I have seen one of those. I am a fish with a nose like a sword. Wait. It is a swordfish. Hey, funny boy, let the lady guess. Where is the butter? It is on the tip of my tongue. Lobster. Saw that. What? Lots of legs. Clam? Close enough. It is a big story I will tell you, friend. They are good. Would somebody give me directions? I am serious. Blah, blah, me, me. Blah, blah, blah, me, me. Thank you. Oh, dear. Hey, come back. What is the matter? While they are doing impressions, I am far from home with a fish that cannot even remember her own name. I bet that is frustrating. My child is out there. Your child Nora? Nemo. It does not matter. Because no fish in this ocean is going to help me. I am helping you. Wait right here. Guys. Is he bothering you again? No, he is a good guy. Go easy on him. He has lost his child Zachary. Heard of SE city, 42 WB street, SY country? Sydney? Oh, sure. Xavier here has relatives in Sydney. Don't you, Xavier? Sure do. Hey, they know Sydney! You wouldn't know how to get there? Follow the big current. That is the east country current. Big current. You cannot miss it. It is in that direction. Then you got to follow that for about... What do you guys think? Three long distances? Two fish friends were swimming. One fish said, \"The ocean current will help us get there fast.\" The other fish said, \"No, we should swim through that trench over there. It is safer.\" The first fish did not believe the second fish. The first fish saw something shiny and swam towards it. It was a small jellyfish. The jellyfish stung the first fish a little. The second fish helped remove the stinger. The second fish said, \"See, jellyfish can be dangerous. We should listen to each other.\" The first fish learned an important lesson. \"I lost count,\" Matthew said. \"Fish are not meant to live in a box, kid.\" \"It does things to you.\" \"The bubbles, the bubbles!\" \"Time for a break!\" \"David just took the book.\" \"We have a short time left.\" \"That's your cue.\" \"You can do it, kid.\" \"We need to be quick.\" \"Once you get in, swim down and I'll guide you through the rest.\" \"Okay.\" \"Matthew said, \"Go on.\" \"It'll be easy.\" \"Well done.\" Can you hear me?\" Here comes the pebble. Now, do you see a small opening? Okay. Inside you'll see a turning fan. Very carefully, wedge that pebble into the fan to stop it moving. Be careful, kid.\" \"I can't do it,\" the kid said. \"This isn't a good idea.\" \"David will be fine. Try again!\" Okay. That's it, kid. Nice and steady.\" \"I got it, I got it!\" the kid exclaimed. \"Well done, kid. Now swim up the tube and out.\" Oh, no! David! Kid! Get him out of there! Help him! What should we do? Oh, no! Stay calm, kid. Don't panic. Help me! Kid, grab hold of this. No! Keep trying. That's it! Come on, kid. Grab it. I got it. Pull! David, don't make him go back in there. No. We're done. Dude? Focus, dude. Dude? He lives. Hey, dude. What happened? I saw the whole thing, dude. First you were all, like, woah! And then we were all, like, woah! Then you were, like, woah... What are you talking about? You, little one! Taking on the jellies. You got serious bravery, dude. Awesome. Oh, my stomach. Man, no throwing up here. I just cleaned it. So, Mr. Turtle... Dude, Mr. Turtle is my father. My name's Frank. Frank? Really? Okay, Frank. Listen, I need to get to the EA Current. Adam and David need to get to the NE city. David is not well. This is all Adam's fault. \"29, 30!\" Adam said. \"Here I come!\" There Adam is. \"Catch me if you can.\" Up Adam goes! \"Oh, my!\" said a voice. \"Stop the engine, friend.\" Let us see what Benjamin does alone. \"Wow!\" That was so cool. \"Hey, Father. Did you see that?\" said Benjamin. \"Did you see me?\" \"You did well, Benjamin. Give me your fin.\" They met Patrick and Thomas. \"Hello, Patrick and Thomas.\" said Adam. \"Hello, Adam and Benjamin.\" said Patrick. \"I must have done something you all liked, friends.\" \"You rock, friend.\" said Patrick. \"Come with me, my son.\" said Patrick. \"It's great, Patrick. When the little ones are eggs we leave them on a beach to hatch, and they find their way back to the big body of water.\" \"All by themselves?\" said Adam. \"Yes!\" said Patrick. \"But, friend, how do you know when they are ready?\" \"You never really know, but when they know, you will know.\" said Patrick. \"You know?\" \"Hey, look, everybody.\" said a voice. \"It's Patrick.\" \"Go on. Jump on him.\" \"A group together!\" \"Wait. Children!\" Adam said. \"Funny?\" said a child. \"Where is your shell?\" \"Do your lines come off?\" \"I need air.\" said Adam. \"Did you cross the forest?\" The children said one at a time. \"Friend, did you die?\" \"Sorry. I was not clear.\" said Adam. \"So where are you going?\" said a child. \"You see, my son was taken.\" said Adam. \"No way!\" said the children. \"What happened?\" \"No, children.\" A parent fish lived on a reef far from here. The parent fish's child, Adam, got mad and swam into the open water to a boat. Some divers appeared, and the parent tried to stop them, but the boat was too fast. So they swam out into the ocean. The divers couldn't stop them. Then Adam's parent swam out to the ocean and bumped into three sharks. The parent scared the sharks away. Then the parent dived deep into the dark ocean where a big, scary creature with sharp teeth lived. The parent had to blast their way out. Some other fish had been searching the ocean for days, looking for Adam. They hoped he would reach the NE city harbor in a few days. Adam's parent would stop at nothing to find their child. That is a dedicated parent, said another fish. \"Mine,\" squawked some rats with wings. One rat said this fish is looking for their child Adam, who was taken from the reef by divers. Another rat said Adam was last seen heading toward the harbor. One fish asked if Adam was okay. Another fish said not to mention the scary creature. \"It's okay, I know who you mean,\" said the first fish. \"Hey Adam, I'm sorry I couldn't stop them from taking you,\" said another fish. \"I'm sorry I put you in danger to get to the ocean. Nothing is worth that.\" \"Okay,\" said Adam. Then something pulled out Adam's tooth. \"I cannot see it.\" \"Right there.\" \"I see it now.\" \"I see it.\" \"I see it.\" \"You mean the spinning circle of fear?\" \"That is it, buddy.\" \"Of course it is.\" \"First, find your exit friend.\" \"Do you have your exit friend?\" \"Yes.\" \"This fish will now tell you how to exit properly.\" \"Good morning.\" \"We will have a fun jump today.\" \"Turn hard as you hit the wall. There is a loud turn, so be careful. Remember, pull, roll, and push!\" \"It is like this fish is trying to talk to me, I know it.\" \"You are really cute, but I do not know what you are saying.\" \"Say the first thing again.\" \"Okay, Jellyman. Go, go, go!\" \"Whoa!\" Whoa! Whoa! That was fun. I actually enjoyed that.\" Hey, look! Turtles. Very good. Now turn your fishy tails and swim straight to the SE city.\" No worries, friend. No worries. Thank you, Friend Crush. Bye. See you, Jellyman. Tell your little friend I said hi, okay? See you later, friends. Bye, everyone. This fish would have loved this. Hey, Crush. I forgot. How old are you? 150, friend! And still young. Rock on! 150. I got to remember that. Whoa. We going in there? Yep. S city, street number 42? Yep. We will just swim straight. Just keep swimming. This fish... Boy, this is taking a while. Hey, how about we play a game? Okay. Okay, I am thinking of something orange. And it is small... It is me. Right. This one you will never guess. It is orange and small. It is me. All righty, Mr Smarty. It is orange and small and white stripes... Me. And the next one, just a guess, me. Okay. That is just scary. Wait. I have seen this floating speck before. That means we have passed it. That means we are not going straight. We got to get to the surface. We will figure it out there. \"Messy.\" \"Very messy.\" \"And it's all thanks to you, child.\" \"You made it possible.\" \"Cameron, I said no cleaning.\" \"I am ashamed.\" \"Look.\" \"Bad angel.\" \"\"Bubbles!\" \"I love the bubbles.\" \"Jessica?\" \"Has anybody seen Jessica?\" \"Jessica!\" \"Early in the morning, and start doctor.\" \"Charlotte.\" \"Sorry I'm late.\" \"Okay. Here we go.\" Little child drops the things...\" \"That's disgusting.\" Tastes good to me.\" Don't you realize we are swimming in our own...\" Here he comes. What a state. Charlotte, what's my earliest time tomorrow? Leave it open. I've got to clean the fish tank before a girl gets here. You hear that? Yay! He's going to clean the tank! Yeah, we're going to be clean! Ready to see your father? Course you are. I wouldn't be surprised if he's out there waiting for you right now. Yeah. Here comes a big one! Come on. You got to try this. Will you just stop it? Why? What's wrong? We're in a big fish. Don't you get it? A big fish? A big fish! 'Cause you had to ask for help. And now we're stuck here. A big fish? You know, I speak fish talk. You're crazy. You can't speak fish talk. I have to get out. I have to find my child. I have to tell him about old turtles! Hey. You okay? There, there. It's all right. It'll be okay. No. It won't. Sure it will. You'll see. No. I promised him I'd never let anything happen to him. That's a funny thing to promise. What? You can't never let anything happen to him. Then nothing would ever happen to him. Not much fun for little child. What's going on? Don't know. I'll ask him. What's... Fiona. ...going on? I think he says we've stopped. Of course we've stopped. \"Don't try to talk like that.\" \"You're going to make things worse.\" \"What is that sound?\" \"Oh, no.\" \"Look what you did.\" \"The water is going down.\" \"It's going down!\" \"Really?\" \"You sure about that?\" \"Look.\" \"Already it's half-gone.\" \"I'd say it's half-left.\" \"Stop that.\" \"It's half-gone!\" \"Okay, that one was a little hard.\" \"He either said we should go to the back or he wants a sweet drink.\" \"Of course he wants us to go there.\" \"That's trying to eat us!\" \"How do I taste, big fish?\" \"Do I taste good?\" \"Tell him I'm not interested in being food.\" \"Okay.\" \"He's...\" \"Stop talking to him.\" \"What is happening? I'll check. What...No. No more big fish. You can't talk like that. Yes, I can. No, you can't. You think you can do these things, but you can't, Nemo. Okay. Dory! He says it's time to let go. Everything's going to be all right. How do you know? How do you know something bad isn't going to happen? I don't! We're alive! Look. SY city. SY city again. You were right. We made it! We're going to find my child. Thank you, sir. Wow. I wish I could talk like that. Now we find the boat that took him. Right. Come on. We can do this! Early morning. It's early morning, everyone. Today's the day. The sun is shining, the tank is clean and we are getting out of...The tank is clean. The tank is clean! But how? Parent must have installed it while we were sleeping. What are we going to do? What's it say, friend? I can't hear you, friend. The water cleaner machine is an all-purpose, self-cleaning salt-water thing that helps your fish live longer. Stop it! The water cleaner machine is set to look at your tank every five minutes? Look? What does that mean? Temperature normal, water balance normal. Nice. Curse you, water cleaner machine! \"That's all for the escape plan.\" \"Then what will we do about...\" \"Diana!\" \"Stay down, kid.\" \"False alarm.\" \"My nerves can't take much more.\" \"What will we do when that child gets here?\" \"I'm thinking, I'm thinking.\" \"Help!\" \"Help me!\" \"Hold on.\" \"I'm coming.\" \"Help me!\" \"Swim down!\" \"Come on, kid.\" \"Swim down!\" \"Everybody jump in.\" \"Swim down!\" \"What the...\" Good work.\" \"Gill!\" \"Sharkbait!\" \"Roll, kid! Lean, kid! Roll!\" \"Go to the window.\" That would have been a bad fall.\" \"I don't want to go belly-up!\" \"Calm down, Nemo. You won't go belly-up. I promise. You're going to be okay.\" \"Diana! Do any of these boats look familiar to you?\" No, but the boat has to be here. We're going to find it. I'm very excited. Are you excited?\" \"Fiona, wake up. Come on.\" Duck! That's not a duck. It's a large bird! No! I didn't come this far to be food. Hey, Victor. Would you look at that? What? Sun's barely up and Thomas's had more than he can handle. Yeah. Reckon somebody ought to help the poor guy. Well, don't everybody fly off at once! All right, Thomas. What is it? Fish got your tongue? Love a duck! I've got to find my son Nemo. Nemo? He's that fish that's been fighting the whole ocean. Hey, I know where your son... Wait. Come back. Stop! Keep going. He's crazy. I've got something to tell you. Mine. Okay. Don't make any sudden moves. Hop inside my mouth if you want to live. Hop into your mouth? And how does that make me live? Because I can take you to your son. Yeah, right! No. I know your son. He's orange. He's got a bad fin on one side. That's Nemo! Mine! Mine! Mine! \"Mine!\" \"Sit down!\" \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Everyone hold on!\" \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Too loud.\" \"Too loud for me.\" \"Twinkle, twinkle, little star.\" \"Find a happy place.\" \"Find a happy place!\" \"Diana, your uncle will see you now.\" \"Alright.\" \"Let's see your teeth.\" \"I'm a fish.\" \"They're in the AM country.\" \"And a fish is a fish.\" \"Just like your gift.\" \"I got a fish!\" \"Oh, no.\" Poor little one.\" \"It's dead.\" \"Samuel! Yay! Fish, fish, fish! Must have left your gift in the car, dear. I'll go get it.\" It's still alive! Why is it playing dead? It's going to get flushed down the toilet. It's going to get out of here. What a smart little one. No, not the trash can! Hey! I found its dad. Where's Emma? Dentist! It's over there. What's a dentist? Get in there. I can't go in there. Oh, yes you can. Charge! What the... Diana, dear, look out. Hold still. Easy, easy. Hold still! It's alright. Nobody's going to hurt you. Emma. Oh, my goodness. Gotcha! Emma! Daddy? Out with you. And stay out! Daddy? Fish? Fish! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Oh, no! To the top of the hill. Why are you sleeping? Hurry! Benjamin! Ring of Fire! Fish! Get it out! Crikey! The animals have gone mad! Get it out! Smack her in the head! Go, Gabriel, go! There's a fish in my hair! Gabriel. Samuel. Tell your dad I said hi. Go get him. It did it! I'm happy. Is it going to be okay? Don't worry. All drains lead to the sea. Fish! \"Alex!\" \"I'm...\" \"I'm so sorry.\" \"Truly I am.\" \"Hey...\" \"Diana.\" \"If it wasn't for you, I never would have even made it here.\" \"So thank you.\" \"Hey, wait a minute.\" \"Wait.\" \"Where are you going?\" \"It's over, Diana.\" We were too late. Patrick's gone. I'm going home now.\" \"No. No, you can't. Stop! Please don't go away. Please? No one's ever stuck with me for so long before. And if you leave... I remember things better with you. Look. S. Sherman, 42... 42... I remember it. It's there. I know it is. Because when I look at you, I can feel it. And I look at you and I... I'm home. Please. I don't want that to go away. I don't want to forget.\" \"I'm sorry, Diana, but I do.\" \"Good food.\" Sweet drink.\" Hey! This is our spot. Go on. Get out of here. Hey, hey, hey. Yeah, that's it. Too right, friend! I got a live one here! Have you seen my parent? Got you! Come back here. You let them go! Parent! No! Excuse me. No. Are you all right? I don't know where I am. I don't know what's going on. I think I lost somebody, but I can't remember. It's okay. I can't remember. I'm looking for someone, too. We can look together. I'm Diana. I'm Patrick. Patrick? That's a nice name. Parent! Parent! Parent. Parent. Parent. Wait a minute. Is it your parent or my parent? My parent. Got it. Parent! Where are we anyway? Parent! Sydney. S. Sherman, 42 Sydney Way, Sydney. Patrick! What? It's you! Patrick! Yes. I'm Patrick. You're Patrick. You were dead. I saw you. \"And then...\" \"Here you are.\" \"You're not gone.\" \"And your papa...\" \"Your papa!\" \"My papa?\" \"You know my papa?\" \"Where is he?\" \"He went this way.\" \"Quick!\" \"Hey!\" \"Have you seen an orange fish swim by?\" It looks like him. But bigger. I saw him, but I'm not telling you where he went. And there's no way you're going to make me.\" Mine. All right. I'll talk! He went to the fish place. Hey, look out. Sorry. I'm just trying to get home. Papa! Nemo? Papa! Nemo? Dad! Nemo's alive! Dory? Nemo! Papa! Nemo! I'm coming, Nemo! Dad! Nemo! Thank goodness. It's all right, child. It's going to be okay. Turn around! You're going the wrong way. Look out! Move! Dory! Come on. Help! Get us out! No, no, no! Dory! Dad, I know what to do. Nemo, no! We have to tell all the fish to swim down together. Get out of there. This will work. No, I am not going to lose you again. There's no time. It's the only way we can save Dory. I can do this! You're right. I know you can. Lucky fin. Now, go. Hurry! Tell all the fish to swim down. Well, you heard my child. Come on. Dory, you have to tell everybody to... Swim down together. Do you understand what I'm saying? Swim down! Everybody swim down. Come on. You have to swim down. Down! Swim down! Swim down! Swim down! Don't give up! Keep swimming! Just keep swimming! That's it! It's working! Keep swimming! Just keep swimming! Come on, Dad! You're doing great, child. That's my dad. Let's get to the bottom. Just keep swimming. Almost there. Keep swimming! Keep swimming! \"Keep swimming!\" \"Hi!\" \"Where's Nemo?\" \"There!\" \"Oh, no.\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo?\" \"It's okay.\" \"Parent's here.\" \"Parent's got you.\" \"Parent?\" \"Oh, thank goodness.\" \"Parent...\" \"I don't hate you.\" \"Oh, no, no, no.\" \"I'm so sorry, Nemo.\" \"Hey, guess what?\" \"What?\" \"Big animals...\" \"I met one.\" And it was very old. Very old? Yes. 'Cause Xavier said they only lived to be old. Xavier? Think I would cross the ocean and not know as much as Xavier? It was very old! Not old. Who is this Xavier that knows everything wrong? Time for school! Time for school! Time for school! Get up! Let's go! I'm going to win. No, you're not. I did it. My own child beats me. Climb aboard, explorers. So then the animal looks over at the other and says, \"With parts like these, who needs other parts?\" Well, hello, Nemo. Who's this? Exchange student. I'm from the EAC, friend. Sweet. Totally. Seriously, Matthew, did you really do all the things you say you did? Pardon me. Hello. Don't be alarmed. We wanted to make sure our newest member got home safely. Thanks. We'll see you next week. Keep up with the program, Hannah. Remember, animals are friends. Not food! Bye! Hold on. Here we go. Next stop, learning. Bye, child. Have fun. Bye, Parent. Mr Ray, wait. I forgot something. Love you, Parent. I love you, too, child. Parent? You can let go now. Sorry. Now go have an adventure. Goodbye. See you later, friends! Bye, Noah. Noah. Noah. Bye, Noah. See you after school, Hannah. Bye, Parent! Bye, child. Jessica. I don't understand it. Here this thing has a lifetime promise and it breaks. Had to clean the tank myself, take the animals out, put 'em in bags and... Where'd the animals go? \"Come on, Quinn!\" \"You got it.\" \"That's it.\" \"You can do it.\" \"That's the shortest red light I've ever seen.\" \"Come on, Quinn.\" \"Now what?\"", "hash": "a67f6097da410d4c93bca7f6cf93a8891d2ba05fd8f5823c5c2812623c9b4b29"}
{"text": "A fish father said, \"Look at this home for our young fish. They will love seeing whales through their bedroom window!\" The fish mother said, \"Don't wake the young fish.\" They went to name the young fish. The father wanted to call them all Junior. The mother wanted to call one Nemo. The father worried if the young fish would like him. The mother was sure at least one would like him. They remembered meeting. Then something bad happened to the mother fish. \"Wait.\" \"Stay here.\" \"Hold my fin.\"\"Hold my fin.\" \"Hold my fin.\" \"You will not be scared like at the zoo.\" \"That bug was going to attack.\" \"Where do we go?\" \"\"Bye, Emma.\" \"\"I'll get you after school.\" \"Come on.\" \"Stop it.\" \"Give it back.\" \"Come on.\" \"We'll try over there.\" \"Excuse me.\" \"Is this where we meet the teacher?\" \"\"Look who's out of the plant.\" \"Yes, it's me.\" \"Adam?

Fish are not funnier than other fish.\"\"Come on, funny fish.\" \"Do something funny.\" All right. I know one joke. There's an animal. It moves up... Well, it swims up. The animal isn't moving. It's in one place. And then another animal... I'm mixed up. There was an animal and another animal. None of them were walking... Frank! Get out of Mr. Gabriel's yard now!\" All right, you kids! Where'd you go?\"\"Where'd you go?\" Where'd you go? Can I play, too? Can I? I would feel better if you play over there. That's where I would play.\"\"What's wrong with his fin?\" \"He looks funny.\"\"Hey, what did I do?\" \"Be nice. It's his first time at school. He was born with it. We call it his lucky fin.\" Emma... See this arm? It's shorter than all my other arms. But you can't really tell. Especially when I move them like this. I'm different. I'm different. Let's name the areas, the areas, the areas. Let's name the areas of the open sea. Mr. Henry! Come on, Isabel. Stay with me. There's one area, another area, another area, another area. All the rest are too deep for you and me to see.

Oh, sorry. I didn't see you. Are you okay? They took the child away. I have to find the boat. A boat? I've seen a boat. You have? And it passed by not long ago. A white one? Hi. I'm Diana. Where? Which way? Oh. It went this way. Follow me. Thank you. Thank you so much. No problem. Wait. Quit it. I'm trying to swim here. The ocean isn't big enough for you? You got a problem? Do you? Do you? Do you? Want to fight me? Yeah. I'm scared now! Wait. Stop following me, okay? What? You're showing me which way the boat went. A boat? I've seen a boat. It passed by not long ago. It went this way. Follow me. Wait a minute. What is going on? You already told me which way the boat was going. I did? Oh, no. If this is some kind of joke, it's not funny and I know funny. I'm a fish. No, it's not. I'm so sorry. \"Thanks, friend.\" \"A little friend for Friend.\" \"I'll start the talks.\" \"Hello.\" \"My name is Benjamin.\" \"Hello, Benjamin.\" \"It has been three weeks since my last food, on my promise, or may I be cut and made into soup.\" \"You're an inspiration to us.\" \"Amen.\" \"Right, then.\" \"Who's next?\" \"Pick me.\" \"Pick me.\" \"The little girl down the front.\" \"Whoo!

How about you, friend? What's your problem?\" Me? I don't have a problem. Okay. ALL: Denial. Just start with your name. Okay. Hello. My name is Oliver. I'm a little sea animal. A little sea animal? Really? Go on. Tell us a joke. I love jokes. I actually do know one that's pretty good. There was this sea animal and he walks up to another sea animal. Normally they don't talk, but in a joke, everyone talks. The sea animal says to the other animal... Father! Oliver! Oliver! (laughs) I don't get it. For a little sea animal he's not that funny. No, he's my child. He was taken by these big people. You poor animal. Big people. Think they own everything. Probably from the FR country. (Crying) There is a father looking for his little boy. What do these markings mean? (Sobs) I never knew my father. Come here. We're all friends here. I can't read big people's writing. Then we've got to find an animal that can read this. Look. Big sea animals! Guys. No, Diana. That's mine. Give it back. Cut it out. Ow! I'm sorry. Are you okay? You really hit me there. Am I bleeding? Diana, are you okay... (Sniffs) Oh! That's good. Help! \"Just a small bite.\" \"You keep calm, mate.\" \"Fish are friends, not food.\" \"Food!\" \"Dory, be careful.\" \"I'm having fish tonight.\" \"Remember the steps, mate.\" \"Just one small bite.\" \"Hello.\" \"There's no way out.\" \"There must be a way to escape.\" \"Who is it?\" \"Help me find a way out.\" \"Sorry.\" \"You'll have to come back later.\" \"We're trying to escape.\" \"There's no way out.\" \"There must be a way out.\" \"Here's something. \"Es-ca-p.\" I wonder what that means.\" \"It's spelled just like the word \"escape.\"\" \"Let's go.\" \"Here's Bruce!\" \"Wait a minute. You can read?\" \"I can read? That's right! Then here. Read this now.\" \"He doesn't mean it. He never even knew his father.\" \"Don't give up.\" \"Oh, no! It's blocked. No, Bruce! Sorry about...Bruce, mate. He's really...A nice guy. I need to get that mask. You want that mask? Okay. No, no, no, no! Quick. Grab the mask. Oh, no. Bruce. What? Swim away! Dory: Is the party over? (Sound)\nNice. Dad! Daddy? Dr. Philip: Barbara. Prepare for his tooth fix, please? And I'll need more cotton. All right. Hello, little one. Beautiful, isn't he? I found that guy struggling for life and I saved him. Has that medicine kicked in yet? (Sounds) My bubbles. He likes bubbles. (Scared sounds) (Whimpering) Hello. Slow down, little one. There's nothing to worry about. He's scared. I want to go home. Do you know where my dad is? Your dad's probably back at the pet shop. Pet shop? Like I'm from a fish shop. A pet shop. A fish shop. Mail order. Online shop. \"Say hello to your new parent.\" \"They are going to be here on Friday to pick you up.\" \"You are their gift.\" \"Shh!\" \"It is our little secret.\" \"Well, Oliver, while that happens, I will go away for a bit.\" \"Oh no.\" \"Diana!\" \"What is wrong with her?\" \"She would not stop shaking the bag.\" \"Poor Oliver. He was her gift last year. He got sick. She hurts fish. I cannot go with that girl. I have to get back to my father. Daddy! Help me! He is stuck. Do not touch him. Can you help me? No. You got yourself in there, you can get yourself out. Isaac... I just want to see him do it, okay? Calm down. Move your fins and tail in turn. I cannot. I have a bad fin. That never stopped me. Just think about what you need to do. Come on. Well done. You did it. Good wriggling. Wow, from the ocean! Just like you, Isaac. Yes. I have seen that look before. What are you thinking about? I am thinking tonight we welcome the kid properly. So, kid, do you have a name or what? I am Cameron. Cameron. Cameron. Diana: (IN SLEEP) You going to eat that? Careful of that tool. Diana! Wake up. Get up. Come on. Yes, I am this color. Look out. Big fish eat small fish! (Diana SHOUTS) (COUGHS) Wow. Dusty. The mask. Where is the mask? No! The mask! Get it! Get the mask! Get it! (PANTS) (Diana SINGS TO SELF) Whoo-hoo! It keeps going on, does it not? Echo! Echo! Echo! What are you doing? I have lost the mask. Did you drop it? You dropped it! That was my only chance of finding my child. Now it is gone. Hey, Mr Grumpy Fins. \"When you are sad, what should you do?\" \"I do not want to know.\" \"Just keep swimming.\" \"Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming.\" \"What do we do?\" \"We swim.\" \"No singing.\" \"I love to swim.\" \"And when you want to swim you want to...\" \"I will be stuck with that song.\" \"It is in my head!\" \"Sorry.\" \"See anything?\" \"Something has me!\" \"That was me. Sorry.\" \"Who is that?\" \"Who could it be?\" \"It is me.\" \"Are you my guide?\" \"Yes. I am your guide. We have not talked for a while. How are you?\" \"I cannot complain.\" \"Good. Now, tell me, do you see anything?\" \"I see a light.\" \"A light?\" \"Yes. Over there.\" \"Guide, am I gone?\" \"I see it too. What is it?\" \"It is so pretty! I feel happy. This is a big thing for me. I want to touch it.\" \"Come back. Come on back here. I will get you.\" \"I will get you. I will get you.\" \"I will swim with you. I will be your best friend.\" \"Good feeling is gone.\" \"We need you to take a small rock inside there and stop the machine,\" Adam said. \"You do that and this tank will get dirtier very fast. Soon the dentist will have to clean the tank. When he does, he'll take us out of the tank, put us in small bags, then we'll roll down the counter, out the window, off the awning, into the bushes, across the street and into the harbor. It's a great plan. Who's with me?\" David said, \"I think you're silly. No offense, kid, but you're not a good swimmer.\" Adam replied, \"He's okay. He can do this. So, Henry, what do you think?\" \"Let's do it!\" Henry exclaimed.\n\nAdam was going to a place. If you ask where he's going, he'll tell you. \"Where are you going?\" David asked. \"To a place,\" Adam answered. \"Where?\" David asked again. \"I'm sorry. I didn't hear you,\" Adam said. \"Hello? Wait. Can you tell me...\" Adam tried to ask people on the street, but they didn't listen. \"Why do I have to tell you again?\" Adam wondered.\n\n\"I think it's best if I go alone from here,\" Adam told Henry. \"You want me to leave?\" Henry asked. \"Well, yes. I just can't have any more delays. You're one of those fish that cause delays,\" Adam explained. \"You mean you don't like me?\" Henry asked sadly. \"Of course I like you,\" Adam assured him. \"Because I like you I do not want to be with you.\" \"It's a hard feeling.\" \"Do not cry.\" \"I like you.\" \"Hey, you!\" \"Grownup, is this boy bothering you?\" \"I do not recall.\" \"Were you?\" \"No, no.\" \"We're just...\" \"\"Do you know how I can get...\" \"We're talking to the grownup, not you.\" \"Do you like pretending?\" \"Yes.\" \"OK.\" \"Just like when we played, friends.\" \"What are we?\" \"Guess.\" \"I've seen one of those. I'm a fish with a nose like a sword. Wait. It's a swordfish. Hey, silly boy, let the grownup guess. Where's the butter? It's on the tip of my tongue. Lobster. Saw that. What? Lots of legs. Clam? Close enough. A famous song. They're good. Somebody give me directions? \"Would somebody give me directions?\" I'm serious. Blah, blah, me, me. Blah, blah, blah, me, me. Thank you. Oh, dear. Hey, come back. What's the matter? While they're pretending, I am far from home with a fish that can't even recall her own name. I bet that's hard. My child is out there. Your child Nathan? Nemo. It doesn't matter. Because no fish in this ocean is going to help me. I'm helping you. Wait right here. Guys. Is he bothering you again? No, he's a good guy. Go easy on him. He's lost his child Nathan. Heard of SY city? Sydney? Oh, sure. Kevin here's got family in SY city. Don't you, Kevin? Sure do. Hey, they know SY city! You wouldn't know how to get there? Follow the EC water. That's E country water. Big water. You can't miss it. It's in that direction. Then you got to follow that for about... What do you guys think? Three parts? That baby's going to move you right past SY city. Great! \"That's great!\" \"Emma, you did it.\" \"Oh, please.\" \"I'm just your little helper.\" \"Helping along.\" \"Friends, thank you.\" \"Don't mention it.\" \"Just relax.\" \"Okay, buddy?\" \"You guys!\" \"You really helped him.\" \"Bye.\" \"\"Ma'am.\" \"One more thing.\" \"Yes?\" \"When you come to this area, swim through it, not over it.\" \"Area.\" \"Through it.\" \"Not over it.\" \"I'll remember.\" \"Hey! Wait up, partner. Hold on. Wait. I've got to tell you something. Whoa. Nice area.\nHello! Let's go. No, no. Bad area. Bad area. Bad area. We're going to swim over this thing. Something's telling me we should swim through it. Are you looking at this thing? Something scary is written on it. I'm sorry, but I think we should swim through. I'm done talking about this. Over we go. Come on.\nTrust me on this. Trust you? Yes. Trust. It's what friends do. Something shiny! Where? It just swam over the area. Come on. Okay. Boy, it sure is clear up here. Exactly. And look at that. There's the flow. We should be there soon.\nHey, little guy. You wanted to go through the area. I shall call him Squishy and he shall be mine. Come here, Squishy. Come here, little Squishy. Ow! That's a plant! Bad Squishy. Shoo! Get away. Let me see. Don't touch it. I'm not going to touch it. I just want to look. How come it didn't hurt you? It did. Hold still. I live in this home and I'm used to these kinds of hurts. Come here. You're going to be fine. But now we know that we don't want to touch these again. Let's be thankful it was just a little one. Don't move. This is bad, Emma. Boing. Boing. \"Alice!\" \"You can't catch me.\" \"Don't bounce on the tops.\" \"They will not sting you!\" \"The tops don't sting you.\" \"Alice: \"Two in a row.\" \"Beat that.\" \"Listen to me.\" \"I have an idea.\" \"A game.\" \"A game?\" \"I love games.\" \"Pick me.\" \"Here's the game.\" \"Whoever can hop the fastest out of these animals wins.\" \"Okay!\" \"Rules. Don't touch the long parts. Only the tops. Something about long parts. Got it.\" \"On your mark. Get set. Go!\" \"Wait! Go faster if you want to win.\" \"Alice!\" \"Boing, boing, boing! Wait a minute. Whee! So, we're being careful now. We're having fun at the same time. I can do this. Just be careful. Careful I don't make you cry when I win. I don't think so! Give it up. You can't fight your body. I was made for speed. The question is, are you hungry? Hungry? Yeah. 'Cause you're about to see my bubbles! Duck to the left, back and coming over, right there! The animal is the winner! We did it. Look at us! Alice? Oh, no. Alice!\" \"Alice!\" \"Alice!\" \"Alice!\" (sound) Aagghh! Alice: Am I disqualified? You're doing fine. You're winning. Stay awake. Where does P. live? P., Street, City. That's it! Stay awake. Stay awake. Stay awake. Stay awake. Stay awake. Stay awake! (Weakly) Awake... P... Awake... Number Street... Wake up. City. Samuel: Emma... You miss your dad, don't you, nickname? Yeah. Well, you're lucky to have someone out there who's looking for you. He's not looking for me. He's scared of the ocean. Any movement? He's had four drinks. It's got to be soon. Keep on him. My first escape, landed on tools. \"I was aiming for the toilet.\" \"The toilet?\" \"All drains lead to the ocean, kid.\" \"Wow.\" \"How many times have you tried to get out?\" \"I've lost count.\" \"Fish aren't meant to be in a box, kid.\" \"It does things to you.\" \"The bubbles, the bubbles!\" \"Potty break!\" \"Adam just grabbed the book.\" \"We have a short time.\" \"That's your cue.\" \"You can do it, kid.\" \"We got to be quick.\" \"Once you get in, swim to the bottom and I'll help you through the rest.\" \"Okay.\" \"Go on.\" \"It'll be easy.\" (TAKES A DEEP BREATH)\" \"Well done.\" \"Can you hear me?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Here comes the pebble.\" \"Now, do you see a small opening?\" \"Yes.\" \"Okay. Inside it you'll see a turning fan. Very carefully, wedge that pebble into the fan to stop it turning. Be careful, kid.\" \"I can't do it.\" \"This isn't a good idea.\" \"He'll be fine. Try again!\" Okay.\" That's it, kid. Nice and steady.\" \"I got it, I got it!\" \"He did it.\" \"That's great, kid. Now swim up the tube and out. Oh, no! Adam! Kid! Get him out of there!\" \"Help him!\" \"What do we do?\" \"Oh, no!\" \"Stay calm, kid. Just don't panic.\" \"Help me!\" \"Kid, grab hold of this.\" No!\" \"Feed me more.\" \"That's it! Come on, kid. Grab it.\" \"I got it.\" Pull! Adam, don't make him go back in there. No. We're done. (WHIMPERS) Friend? Friend? Friend? Focus, friend. Friend? He lives. Hey, friend. (GROANS) \"What happened?\" \"I saw the whole thing, friend. First you were all, like, whoa! And then we were all, like, whoa! Then you were, like, whoa...\" \"What are you talking about?\" You, small one! Taking on the jellies. \"Kids!\" \"You funny?\" \"Where's your home?\" \"Do your colors come off?\" \"I need to breathe.\" \"Did you cross the sea plants forest?\" \"One at a time.\" \"Mr Fish, did you sleep?\" \"Sorry.\" \"I was vague on the details.\" \"So where are you going?\" \"You see, my child was taken.\" \"My child was taken away from me.\" \"No way!\" \"What happened?\" \"No, kids.\" \"I don't want to talk about it.\" \"Come on.\" \"Please.\" \"Well, okay. I live on this place, a long way from here. This is going to be good. I can tell. My child, Nora, she was mad at me. Maybe she wouldn't have done it if I hadn't been so tough on her. I don't know. She swam in the open water to this boat and these people appeared and I tried to stop them. The boat was too fast, so we swam out in the ocean... She couldn't stop them. Then Nora's father, he swims out to the ocean and they bump into three big fish. He scares them away by blowing them up. That's amazing. Then dives down deep... Straight into the dark. It's very dark there. You can't see a thing. The only thing they can see down there is... This big, horrible creature with sharp teeth! Nice move. Then he has to blast his way... These fish have been searching the ocean for days on the current. He may be on his way here right now. That should put him in SY city... In a few days. This guy will not stop until he finds his child. I hope he makes it. That's one dedicated father, if you ask me. Mine. Mine. Mine. Mine. Mine. Would you just be quiet? You're flying animals. This creature is looking for his child, Nora. She was taken off the place by people... There. Take it. Say that again. You said something about Nora. Mine. Mine. Mine. Mine. Mine. (loud noise) Mine. Last I heard, he's heading towards the city. Great! Is he doing okay? I don't know, but whatever you do, don't mention the bad place... It's okay. I know who you're talking about. Gabriel?\"Gabriel?\" \"Gabriel?\" \"Hello, Gabriel.\" \"I'm sorry I couldn't stop...\"\n\"GABRIEL: I'm the one who should be sorry. I was so ready to get out, so ready to see the big world out there. I was willing to put you in danger to get there. Nothing should be worth that. I'm sorry I couldn't get you back to your father, kid.\"\n\"Okay. Hey, hey, hey! What the...\"\n\"Well, that's one way to pull a tooth. (LAUGHS) Darn kids. Well, good thing I pulled the right one, eh?\"\n\"Pssst! You just missed an extraction. Has he loosened the tooth yet? What am I talking about? Where's Nemo? I've got to speak with him. Your dad's been fighting hard looking for you. My father? Really? He's travelled far. He's been battling sharks and jellyfish. Sharks? That can't be him. Are you sure? What was his name? Some fish. Marlin? That's it. The fish from the reef. It's my dad! He took on a shark! I heard he took on three. Three? Three sharks? That's a lot of teeth! After you were taken, your dad followed like crazy. Really? He's giving it all and then three sharks capture him. He escapes them and then dives deep and gets chased by a big scary fish! He ties this monster to a rock. And his reward? He gets to battle a jellyfish forest. Now he's with sea turtles on the EB Current and the word is he's headed this way, right now, to SY city! What a good daddy. He was looking for you after all. He's swimming in the filter! Not again! Gabriel! No! You've got your life ahead of you. We'll help you. Get him out. Get him out of there. Come on. Grab the end. (Loud noises) Are you okay? Can you hear me, Gabriel? Nemo? Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. The father and child were inside a large animal. \"You cannot talk to the animal,\" said the father. \"Yes, I can,\" replied the child. \"It is telling us we need to get out of here now.\" The animal made loud noises. \"It says we need to go to the back of its mouth,\" said the child. \"No, that will make it eat us!\" exclaimed the father in fear. The child tried to calm the father, \"Do not worry, it will be okay.\" But the father did not believe the child's words. The animal made more loud noises. \"It is saying we need to let go, and everything will be fine,\" explained the child. \"I'll go and get it,\" said Adam. \"He's still alive!\" \"Why is he playing dead?\" \"He's going to get flushed down the toilet.\" \"He's going to get out of here.\" \"What a smart little one.\" \"No, not the trash can!\" \"Hey!\" \"I found his dad.\" \"Where's the child?\" \"Doctor!\" \"He's over there.\" \"What's a doctor?\" \"Get in there.\" \"I can't go in there.\" \"Oh, yes you can.\" Charge!\" (SCREAMS) What the... Emma, sweetie, look out. Hold still. Easy, easy. Hold still! It's all right. Nobody's going to hurt you. The child. Oh, my goodness. Gotcha! Daddy? Out with you. And stay out! Daddy? Animal? Animal! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Oh, no! To the top of the big mountain. Why are you sleeping? Hurry! Friend! Ring of Fire! Animal! Get it out! Crikey! The animals have gone mad! (SCREAMS) Get it out! Smack her in the head! Go, friend, go! There's an animal in my hair! Friend. Friend. Tell your dad I said hi. Aaggh! Go get him. (The doctor GROANS) He did it! I'm happy. Is he going to be okay? Don't worry. All pipes lead to the ocean. Animal! Aaggh! Daddy! (GASPS) I'm...I'm so sorry. Truly I am. Hey... Friend. If it wasn't for you, I never would have even made it here. So thank you. Hey, wait a minute. Wait. Where are you going? It's over, Friend. We were too late. The child is gone. I'm going home now. No. No, you can't. Stop! Please don't go away. Please? No one's ever stuck with me for so long before. Adam and Emma were looking for their dads. \"Look,\" said Adam, \"I remember the address. PE city, 42...\" \n\"I remember it too,\" said Emma. \"When I look at you, I feel at home.\"\n\"Please don't forget me,\" said Adam.\n\"I'm sorry, but I do forget things,\" said Emma.\n\"Hey, this is our spot! Get out of here!\" said a fish.\n\"Have you seen my dad?\" asked Adam. \"He looks like me, but bigger.\"\n\"I saw him, but I won't tell you where he went,\" said the fish. \"There's no way you can make me tell.\" Adam and Emma were in a hard place. \"Look out!\" Adam said. \"Sorry,\" Emma said. \"I'm just trying to get home.\"\n\n\"Daddy!\" a small voice cried. \"Emma?\" Adam said. \"Daddy!\" the voice said again. \"Emma!\" Adam said with joy. \"I'm coming, Emma!\"\n\n\"Dad!\" Emma cried. Adam swam quickly toward Emma. \"Thank goodness,\" Adam said. \"It's okay, Emma. It will be okay.\"\n\nBut danger was coming. \"Turn around!\" Emma cried. \"You're going the wrong way!\" Adam tried to move, but couldn't. \"Help! Get us out!\" Emma cried.\n\n\"Dad, I know what to do,\" Emma said. \"No, Emma!\" Adam said. \"We can't lose you.\" \"This will work,\" Emma insisted. \"It's the only way we can save Emma.\" Adam knew Emma was right. \"You can do this,\" he said.\n\nEmma called to all the fish, \"Lucky fin! Swim down together!\" Adam joined in, \"You heard my child. Swim down!\" The fish listened and swam down together. \"It's working!\" Adam cried joyfully. The fish kept swimming down until they were safe.\n\nBut Emma was gone. \"Emma?\" Adam called. There she was, hurt. \"It's okay,\" Adam said, holding her. \"Daddy's here. Daddy has you.\" \"Parent?\" \"Oh, thanks.\" \"Parent...\" \"I do not dislike you.\" \"Oh, no, no, no.\" \"I feel very sorry, child.\" \"Hey, guess what?\" \"What?\" \"Ocean turtles...\" \"I met one.\" \"And they were very old.\" \"Very old?\" \"Yes.\" \"'Cause person said they only lived to be older.\" \"Person?\" \"Think I would cross the ocean and not know as much as person? They were very old! Not less old. Who is this person that knows everything wrong?\" \"Time for school!\"\"Time for school!\" \"Time for school!\" Get up! Let's go!\" \"I'm going to win.\" \"No, you're not.\" \"I did it.\" \"My own child beats me.\" Climb aboard, explorers. So then the thing looks over at the other thing and says, \"With things like these, who needs other things?\" Well, hello, child. Who's this?\" \"Exchange student.\" \"I'm from the place, dude.\" \"Cool.\" \"Totally.\" Seriously, person, did you really do all the things you say you did?\" \"Pardon me. Hello. Don't be alarmed. We wanted to make sure our newest member got home safely.\" \"Thanks.\" \"We'll see you next week.\" \"Keep up with the thing, person.\" Remember, fish are friends. Not food!\" Bye! Hold on. Here we go. Next stop, knowledge. Bye, child. Have fun. Child: Bye, parent. Oh! Teacher, wait. I forgot something. Love you, parent. I love you, too, child. Uh, parent? You can let go now. Sorry. Now go have an adventure. Goodbye. See you later, people! Bye, child. Nemo. Nemo. Bye, child. See you after school, person. Child: Bye, parent! Bye, child. Person: Person. Person: Yes? I don't understand it. Here this thing has a lifetime guarantee and it breaks. Had to clean the tank myself, take the fish out, put 'em in bags and... Where'd the fish go? (Vehicle sounds) Come on, thing! \"You got it.\" \"That's it.\" \"You can do it.\" \"That's the shortest red light I've ever seen.\" \"Come on, Emma.\" \"(CHEERING)\" \"(HAPPY LAUGHTER)\" \"Now what?\" \"(HAPPY MUSIC PLAYING)\"", "hash": "5a4c4e4fbc9b792f49c66e3caef07305139689f3ec57620a94c3328094abd892"}

Well attended by the brothers, I stayed in SP city longer than planned.\" \"Excuse me, Adam. The brothers wish to see your item again.\" Once upon a time, a man said, \"May they?\" Another man replied, \"A pleasure.\" The first man said, \"Thank you.\" The man said, \"In the mornings, I studied the valuable books kept in the big building, and at evening time, when it was cooler, I visited the places I'd always dreamed of.\" Someone asked, \"Do you have the time?\" The man answered, \"A little before five o'clock.\" The other person said, \"Thank you. What a great watch!\" They asked, \"Are you from the FR country?\" The man replied, \"Shall I tell your future?\" They asked, \"Are you a wanderer?\" The man said, \"If you prefer.\" They asked again, \"Then if you're not a wanderer, are you a wise woman?\" The man joked, \"I'm friends with the evil one.\" The person said, \"Again.\" The man asked, \"What?\" They said, \"Your watch.\" The man replied, \"Of course.\" The person said, \"May I take your arm?\" The man answered, \"Naturally.\" The man described what a beautiful woman should look like. The person asked, \"May I have your looking glass?\" The man shared about his lover. The person said, \"Do you have a coin?\" The man answered, \"Yes.\" They instructed him to cross his left hand with the coin. After observing, they said the man's lover loves someone else of higher status. The man asked if he could know more about curing his troubles. The person said it would be a sweet cure worth much treasure. Suddenly, another person appeared. The man was surprised and asked why this person was here. The other person replied it's a small world and the future had seemed interesting until being interrupted. They suggested forgetting the night's events and leaving. The man realized his watch was missing but was told to forget it. A few days later, the man moved with help to an important place. He wondered if certain events were common in that area. Someone called out to him. In barely a week, they saw the ground open and reveal proof of an almost unknown culture. A few days later, early in the morning, Adam received a surprise. \"Thanks, Adam.\" \"Praised be!\" \"Welcome, my dear friend.\" \"I, your servant, and my friends were praying for your soul.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"So you weren't hurt?\" \"We know you were robbed.\" \"They found your watch in that person's house.\" \"Praise be!\" \"The accused will rise.\" \"The trial took place some days later...\" \"The verdict.\" \"...and I was asked to help.\" \"This court finds Benjamin guilty of wrongdoing.\" His crime is proven, he being the one who did the crimes. Consequently, it says Benjamin must be punished. Signed in CO city late 20th century.\" \"Charlotte.\" \"Your neck's shorter.\" \"That's it!\" \"I brought you these.\" \"Anything else I can do?\" \"Thanks, I don't think I'll need any more.\" \"Do you think help might get your punishment changed?\" \"Arrange a ceremony for my soul's salvation.\" \"Do you know SE city, that huge building by the city wall near the river?\" \"Help!\"\"Help!\" \"Help!\" \"She's hurt!\" \"She's hurt her!\" \"Back there, in the room!\" \"Help me, please!\" \"Help me!\" \"To the room and calm her down!\" \"Take two people and see what's going on.\" A sign had just shown my future. It's all yours, come and try it. Let us through! Out of the way! Quiet! Fight, fight! Quiet!\"\"Quiet! Quiet! Give me all you've got Benjamin! Tell person we prefer you. I'm bleeding to death! Get me a helper, and a person to punish that person! Your mother was the person! Silence!\"\"Silence! Silence! Right, what's going on? You must come with me. Only because I trust you. Give me my thing. Let's go. Person! Person! You're for it now! Shut up, all of you! The Benjamin! Silence! A child said, \"I thought if someone had spoken ill of my home, I would have been very angry, like how Charlotte did to her friend.\" Another child replied, \"Friend, if I pushed you and you fell, these two people would stop me.\" \"Go ahead, my friend... may good things happen to you.\" \n\n\"Quick, she's leaving!\" \"Jack!\" \"Let's chase her!\" \n\n\"For not doing their job well, Samuel is removed from their position and must go to a room alone for one month.\" \"Turn around!\" \"Five years of hard work!\" \"Five years of good behavior in the hope of getting a better position.\" \n\n\"What had brought me to this?\" \"A girl who tricked me and was probably, even now, tricking another person somewhere.\" \"Despite myself, she was always on my mind.\" \"I looked through the bars of my room, and of all the people who passed, not one came close to that girl.\"\n\nThe worst was yet to come: at the yearly party they made me stand guard like a regular worker. But life had more in store that same night.\n\n\"Been removed from your position, eh, new worker? If you like fried food, find Liam's tavern in the NE city.\" \n\n\"Who's dancing?\" \"Charlotte.\" \n\nWorker, a bottle for that table. Two house drinks.\n\n\"For one look, good things, for one smile, great things, for one kiss from you, I feel very happy.\"\n\n\"The day has twenty-four hours, if it had more, then those extra...\"\n\n\"That's enough of that!\" \"What happened?\" \"She's crazy.\"\n\nPeople with higher positions like her very much. He has a lower position. Wait. Look at him! He looks very serious. Ever felt very happy? What are you worth? A little money? Better than nothing, I guess. Let's spend it all. And you can treat me well.\n\nHear the bells? Ringing at night brings bad things. Don't laugh, silly person. They say you're a bad person. Only on some days.\n\n\"Who is it?\" \"Needing a room for the night.\" Let's go.\n\nA snack for your friends. Put it down. Your favorite room.\n\nReturn the baskets. Come, friends, someone is waiting. \"What did you ask for?\" \"For you to go back to the factory.\" \"To leave the place.\" \"Why not ask for a lot of money?\" \"I asked for you to be good and feel sorry for me.\" \"This person is from a place, and knows I won't change.\" \"All people are the same.\" \"I asked the person, our person.\" \"I made a deal with the bad thing, and won't go back to the factory.\" \"But I'll be good to you.\" \"Come.\" \"She better not see this.\" \"Am I really the first one?\" \"I'll show you how to do it, new person.\" \"You'll learn a lot tonight.\" \"Are you really new?\" \"Where are you going?\" \"Roll call at the place.\" \" The place?\" \" Yes.\" \"Are you being told what to do?\" \"I have to go.\" \"Well, go on, leave.\" \"Go away!\" \"You're such a baby!\" \"Here! Go!\" \"What can I do? I can't stay. It's my job to go.\" \"So, go.\" Do what you're told.\" \"The person... The person. I'm a worker. I belong to the place. Don't you see I must go? I can't stay.\" \"What day is today?\" \"Yesterday was a day.\" \"And the date?\" \"No, quiet! Don't say it.\" A bad day.\" \"Why?\" \"Not now. I said no.\" \"Listen, person... think of this as paid. I would have forgotten what you owed, but I liked you. So we're even. When will I see you again?\" \"When you stop being silly.\" \"So, light a thing to your person, they earned it.\" The person... After that night, I had no other thought. I spent the day walking around, hoping to see the person. The person! Excuse me. Believe me, person, every place I went, I hoped to see the person. Where's the person? Look for them in a bad place. Words, person of nice things, our life, sweet and hope, words. To you I cry, person of a person. To you I cry, I am sad and cry. O nice! O loving! O sweet person, words! Turn your nice eyes on this bad person and make their time better. A young soldier was tempted by a woman named Charlotte. She asked him, \"Do you want more money?\" The soldier said, \"No, I cannot let illegal things pass.\" But Charlotte threatened to tell the soldier's boss if he did not obey. \n\nOne day, Charlotte called the soldier, \"Come to me.\" The soldier went to see her, though he felt sad. Charlotte gave him money and said mean things to him. The soldier thought about hurting her but decided not to.\n\nThe next day, Charlotte did not come. The soldier could not forget her. A fortune teller told the soldier that an older man would love Charlotte for a while but not marry her. The fortune teller said the right man for Charlotte would come later and ask her to leave with him.\n\nOne day, a handsome young man asked where Charlotte was. Her friend said, \"Charlotte is like bad weather. The hotter the sun, the closer the storm. Do not wait for her.\" A young boy named Adam asked, \"Why?\" A kind old man replied, \"It's good advice. Don't wait. Go.\" Adam asked, \"Do you know who Charlotte is?\" The old man said, \"Do you want to know about her?\" \n\nThe old man told a sad story about Charlotte. \"When she was just a young girl, some bad people hurt her. Her mother did bad things, and her father hurt people for money. When Charlotte has no money, she comes here and does bad things with dirty old men.\"\n\nAdam asked, \"Why Charlotte? What do you see in her?\" The old man replied, \"What do you want? A young girl who loves you and can cook? I can find one for you. Or a woman who can have babies? I can find one too. Or a woman with experience, who knows what a man likes? I can provide all of those for you.\"\n\nAdam said firmly, \"Enough! I want Charlotte. Just for me and no one else.\" The old man got angry and yelled, \"Get out, you fool! I don't respect you or that woman! This means trouble for you.\" He called Charlotte a bad name.\n\nThe old man told Adam to leave. Charlotte said, \"Go and pray until I come for you. Let's hope your prayers can help you with this mess. Quick! Go!\"\n\nAdam prayed to a kind woman in the sky, asking for help and promising to be good. But he felt very sad for the bad things he had done.\n\nLater, the old man gave Adam plain clothes, saying he couldn't wear his uniform anymore. The old man scolded Adam for messing up and warned that Adam would have to act now because of the trouble he caused. Adam said, \"If you have the courage, go to the hills and be a smuggler.\" \"Here.\" \"It is from Lillas Pastia, for friends in the JE country who will help.\" \"See, my outlaw friends are not so bad.\" \"There is a horse outside.\" \"Lucky color, they say.\" \"Every situation has a good side.\" \"From a high rank to a low one.\" \"You killed a person and gained freedom.\" \"You no longer work for the leader.\" \"Now you will sleep under the night sky.\" \"Charlotte... do you love me?\" \"How silly can you be?\" \"The proof is I never asked for money.\" \"When she said these things, I felt like hurting her.\" \"However, as I went towards my new future, I dreamed of Charlotte being mine, of a life of adventure, my lover riding behind me.\" \"So crazy can love make one.\" \"Cameron, you are wanted.\" \"\"Good afternoon.\" \"Good afternoon.\" \"I have a letter for you. A friend of Pastia wants to join us. Welcome. He is not good at making music, but has his reasons, right?\" \"David learns from books and knows what is happening in the world.\" \"The first person to compare a woman with a flower was a poet. The second one was silly.\" \"Isaac hardly speaks, but when he does...\" \"Go on, Isaac! Long live the rules! Down with the rules! Down with the rules! Long live the leader!\"\nAny news, soldier?\" One move and you are dead. Throw down your weapons. Get down. Get off the horse. Take them away. You cannot hear, or what? Move. Drop them. Move it. Go on. The paper. Isaac, their swords. You only die once and the law can only sentence you to death once. Money! Bags of money! Friends, that is the way to a far away place. Hurry! The leader, by the grace of good, etc., etc. It pleases me to issue this rule on the occasion of the birthday of the leader's wife; I hereby stop forever, in all my lands, execution by hanging; ordering from now on death by simple method, for common people; by bad method, for dishonest crimes, regardless of rank...\" \"I never killed anyone. I tell a lie.\" A boy and an old man talked. \nThe old man said, \"We killed many people in a war long ago. Ministers praised us for that.\" \n\"We were young,\" the boy said.\n\"An important man had many titles,\" said the old man. He listed some titles like \"King of many countries\" and \"Duke of many places.\"\n\"What is wrong with him?\" asked the boy.\n\"He misses his lover,\" said the old man.\n\"His lover?\" asked the boy.\n\"Yes, a woman named Charlotte,\" said the old man.\n\"Was he really your leader in the war?\" asked the boy.\n\"No, he was under me,\" said the old man. \"I beat him in a fair fight with swords. He fell onto my sword by mistake. One less bad person.\"\n\"They looked up to me for killing him,\" said the old man. \"For a few days, it seemed my dream had come true.\"\nThe old man showed the boy a book his mother had.\nThe old man said, \"Kill someone and you get freedom and a woman, maybe.\"\nThe boy read from the book, \"'Forgive me,' he said to another man. 'Forgive me for hurting you with my sword.'\" \n\"'I forgive some aggression...'\" said the other man in the book.\n\"Tell me you're happy,\" said the old man to the boy.\n\"I'm happy,\" said the boy.\nThe old man taught the boy to throw stones.\nA man came. \"It's the husband of your lover,\" someone said to the boy. \"He got out of jail yesterday.\"\nThe old man said, \"When two men love one woman and they're in the same place, trouble can happen.\"\nThe boy said to the old man, \"I only love you.\" \nThe boy said the man bought him as a child servant.\nThe man greeted the old man and said he had been in jail. They talked about getting weapons and tobacco. \"It is not safe.\" \"That is my view..., for what it is worth.\" \"Our helper?\" \"Me...\" \"Adam,\" \"Thomas.\" \"Agreed?\" \"Agreed.\" \"We are invited to Ethan's farm.\" \"Tell us who will love us.\" \"Tell us who will betray us.\" \"Your husband does.\" \"He sleeps with others, but loves me.\" \"Flee sad answers in vain.\" \"The cards do not lie.\" \"Ever.\" \"The other is a woman of passion, not safe.\" \"Look...\" \"If I flirt, he gets into a jealous rage.\" \"He is my man.\" \"You love the performer.\" \"Every woman in the NE region loves Ethan.\" \"A message from the leader.\" \"Friends, your attention, please.\" \"I have news of great interest.\" \"The King is pleased to make the following announcement: \"On this day of early 20th century, my wife, gave birth to a healthy princess. Heaven has blessed our union, fulfilling the desire of all my subjects for a direct heir to the throne. The new princess will tomorrow receive baptism in the Royal Chapel, and will be named Isabel.\" Long live Isabel!\" \"What is your name?\" \"Charlotte.\" \"I will do my next task speaking your name.\" \"Careful, you will lose her.\" \"Tell her husband.\" \"You cannot fool me, you are her husband.\" \"The woman who loves a person of different culture has no pride, for that person causes trouble among the neighbors...\" \"Soldiers! Take cover! Come on! Take up positions! Quick!\" \" They are from the NW region! Run for it!\" \" Come on, come on! Oh no!\" Bales first. Come on, quick! Help me, please. Do not be unwise! Finish them off! Fire at will! Leave him! Leave him, I say! Unwise one! You will be hurt. Help me. Help me!\" Nobody will recognize him. Let us go! See if there is any food. Cards, drinks and entertainment to lighten the heart. While I play, I think. Your friend betrayed us. Only tobacco here. That Thomas of yours is evil. He only works for himself. \"Don't make me angry.\" \"You want my friend, she is yours for four coins.\" \"Looking for trouble?\" \"Come on, then.\" \"Calm down, you two.\" \"Put away your knives.\" \"Stay out of this.\" \"Adam...\" \"It's not your fight.\" \"Stand aside.\" \"Where were you born?\" \"From your mother?\" \"Bad person... you were fed bad milk.\" \"I'll cut your face.\" \"Then open your belly.\" \"Bad people.\" \"You're going straight to a bad place.\" \"Who are you wishing luck to?\" \"Whose wife do you want to be?\" \"Bad person. \"Bad things!\" \"Maybe she really brings bad luck.\" \"Here, take it.\" \"Take it!\" \"I won't wish you luck, you can't handle it.\" \"We'll have to bury him.\" \"Isn't this better?\" \"His time had come.\" Yours will, too.\" My time has come already. And yours. This secret life is over. You'll be my wife, only mine, for life. What do you want? Children? Me with a baby on me? It was then I bumped into you, sir. First near MO town, then in CO city. Cameron kept your watch. She also wanted your money and that ring. Said it was magic and cared a lot about owning it. Another man filled her thoughts... Walk away and forget tonight's events. My watch! Best forgotten. Is he your lover? Who? The bull fighter. Are you lovers? I wish we were. I don't allow you to see him. Careful, things you can't have taste better. Forgive me! Please, Cameron, forgive me! I will not. It has your name, Cameron. Look, there's your Adam. Hurt me. Run me through. Moan with me. Let's shout together. Hey, where are you going? Who is it? What do they want? Get dressed. Who's this rude person? Go. What bad luck! The woman I want in my arms, and her lover comes. Benjamin, David, Ethan, out! Everybody out! See... I've spared your life. I kill bulls. I don't break the hearts of men... who love the same woman.", "hash": "b850c5baf539816580deb82d2d5790430b8d6d1f211bd22c63dd093b8def76c2"}

{"text": "A teacher asked a question about a battle in the FR country. \"The Adam army charged across a field,\" the teacher said. \"Then something bad happened. Who knows what it was?\" One student said, \"I did not do anything wrong.\" Another student said, \"I was up late studying.\" The teacher asked again, \"What was the bad thing at that battle?\" \n\nA student named Benjamin raised his hand. \"We were in the FR country, right?\" the teacher said. \"Mud!\" Benjamin said. \"The field was very muddy.\" \"Yes, Benjamin,\" the teacher said. \"The Adam soldiers and horses got stuck in the mud. The Ethan army defeated them easily.\"\n\nAfter that battle, the teacher said, a girl named Charlotte said God told her to save the FR country from the Ethan army. The teacher said some people might have thought Charlotte was not well in her mind for saying that.\n\nOne student asked if Charlotte was crazy just because she said God spoke to her. The teacher said they would learn more about it before the big test.\n\nLater, at home, a boy named David asked his father for money to buy some science supplies. The father gave David money.\n\nDavid's sister Emma asked her father for money too, but the father said no because she had enough already. \"Okay.\" \"The bank is closed.\" \"While we are talking about all this, my therapy costs money, and I want to help pay for it.\" \"No, honey.\" \"Why not?\" \"That is your spending money from your job.\" \"I know the medical costs are high, and Joan's shoes are not nice.\" \"You are not paying for therapy.\" \"It is needed for our family.\" \"Money talk is over now.\" \"I have to go meet Grace.\" \"Does anyone want this banana?\" \"Take it with you.\" \"Can I walk with you?\" \"Ha ha ha. That is funny.\" \"Come on, friend, I will give you a ride.\" \"See you.\" \"Have a good day.\" \"Bye.\" \"Drive safely.\" \"We will talk about money, right?\" \"We pay $1,200 more each month for Kevin's therapy, plus we still owe money for changes to our home for his wheelchair.\" \"And we have 2 kids who may go to college.\" Luke is smart. He may get help to pay. There is no easy way for Joan.\" I know you get more pay when your work keeps you, but until then, we must be careful.\" \"You do not get more pay. They may not keep you?\" \"Let us not worry yet. I have 6 months to make them like me. It will be fine.\" \"Joan was like a brave girl warrior long ago. She wore armor and led soldiers into battles. But then they burned her.\" \"She was not crazy, right? I mean, she did not have a strange mental illness?\" \"You mean a messianic complex?\" \"Oh. I guess so.\" \"Why ask me, like I know about being normal? When you are different, some call you crazy. I think it is good.\" \"So she was not crazy then?\" \"I do not care about that anymore, Joan.\" \"Well...Grace...\" \"You are not crazy, Joan.\" \"No offense, but you make me feel crazy sometimes, so you cannot say I am not.\" \"Do you even know what a paranoid person with mental illness is?\" \"Yes, it is someone who hears voices, like from God. Which is why I feel, I do not know, nervous sometimes.\" \"Here is what I want you to do.\" \"Never talk to the helpers.\" \"I think Cameron said that.\" \"Read.\" \"Oh, kids.\" \"Jessica, I have a masters degree in writing.\" \"I could have done some work with my life.\" \"But I chose to open a bookstore, because I think books are powerful for learning.\" \"Want to learn something? Read.\"\n\n\"We had fish pie on Monday.\" \"No, on Monday it was cheese pasta.\" \"Tuesday was fish pie.\" \"Are we poor?\" \"I remember eating nice meat.\" \"We're not poor.\" \"Jessica, no reading at meal time.\" \"Let me finish this one thing.\" \"A famous drama.\"\n\n\"Is that homework?\" \"Yeah, kind of. It's for a history test.\" \"You ever notice how the group has to have leaders for everything?\" \"Leaders are important.\" \"Really? How are they important?\" \"They show us how to live.\" \"Name one leader whose life you want to copy.\" \"For example, the leader of fireworks, for when all your things don't work?\"\n\n\"What about Diana? She won a whole war.\" \"You know, I find it wrong that science helpers never get respect.\" \"Like Gabriel said the earth moves around the sun and he was kept at home, but is there a Gabriel leader?\"\n\n\"Gabriel said something different.\" \"Sort of different. He was taken and forced to say different.\" \"Maybe a voice really does talk to people. Has anyone thought of that?\" \"You know, sometimes when bad things happen to people, like getting burned, they might have caused it.\" \"Diana wasn't crazy!\" \"Can we talk about the weather? I thought it was warm today.\" \"It's a phase.\" \"It's not a phase.\" \"Well, why were all the other things phases and this isn't?\" \"Because this is different.\" \"Do mothers come with a book?\" \"She's been doing strange things, William.\" \"Destroying Adam's thing was a sign of that. Now she's thinking about leaders. That's not like her.\" \"Well, it could be worse.\" \"So you want to wait for it to get worse before we do something?\" \"Kevin's still having anger, Liam's getting ignored, you're having a lot of pressure at work. I feel like I'm holding up playing cards.\" \"You do not like the word?\" \"I think people should solve their own problems.\" \"That kind of thing.\" \"I sense your child is very angry.\" \"How would you like to solve that?\" \"The child is driving, working, and figuring it out.\" \"Actually I'm more worried about Jessica.\" \"I told you.\" \"This is about me being strange.\" \"So I picked up some strange interests.\" \"I mean, kids do that.\" \"So I broke a famous drama.\" \"I mean, I had my reasons.\" \"And the cheating thing is completely wrong.\" \"Cheating thing?\" \"I did not cheat.\" \"I am not retaking the test.\" Jessica cheated?\" \"No.\" \"It's just Jessica on a tear.\" Jessica did not cheat.\" How could you not tell me about it?\" \"This just in, Adam. I try to protect you from things if I can.\" \"You see? This is the problem.\" \"I am the good kid, so I never get any attention.\" Also we are not rich. We are not poor. We are only here because of me. Not true. Well, I'm thinking that what we're looking at here is a communication issue. What? You are not communicating. We need to work on that, so the task for the week is to make a special effort to listen, to ask each other questions and really understand the answers. Wait. We are going to have tasks? I cannot have any more tasks. Are you a therapist or are you... You? Blink twice if you know what I mean. I am not strange. This affects you, people. You could be next! Rally against unfairness! No proof, no test! Support Jessica against the mean people. Rally against unfairness! Support Jessica! Take back the power! Take back the power! Take back the power! What are you doing? It's your revolution. Don't you recognize it? Sort of. It's ok. You've taken a stand. I'll organize the effort. Grace, my feet hurt in these shoes. Did I ask you to dress like a serious person? This is Taylor, student leader. I'm not entirely clear on the revolution, but Grace said I had to do it. As student leader, I have to stay aware of the issues. What's the issue? \"Yes, I do.\" \"I will start.\" \"Go ahead, Emma.\" \"Well, I took the test again and got a good grade, and I helped someone in a way.\" \"You did?\" \"Well, in a way.\" \"In a way that has meaning.\" \"And even though all my friends do not like me, I still feel good.\" \"Look, I know the only reason that we were here was because I acted in a strange way, but as far as I'm concerned, we can all go home now because the strange behavior is over.\" \"I'm done.\" \"Zachary?\" \"Penelope?\" \"Anything you'd like to discuss?\" \"Well, I'm starting to think maybe Matthew was right.\" \"Maybe we all just need to talk to each other and not bring all our problems here.\" \"Then again, maybe it's best we get it out in the open.\" \"Well, this wasn't for our problems.\" \"This was to help the children.\" \"Our problems affect the children.\" \"He doesn't mean big problems.\" \"I'm just saying we're in this group now.\" \"Maybe it's best to talk about whatever it is that's really going on.\" \"Whatever is causing tension.\" \"Well, actually I would like to hear more from Ryan.\" \"He's right. We don't check in with him enough.\" \"Oh. Okay. Um... I've been wanting to talk to someone about something I'm learning -- but for goodness sake! I can't stand it! Can we -- can we please just talk about the big mark on the floor? We've been avoiding it for a long time now and it's making me upset and maybe it's why I'm so angry all the time! Because no one will say it out loud, so I have to. The accident... it was my fault. This was my fault. My friends and I were out after a game. My friend was very drunk. I tried to take his keys. He got angry. I was afraid of not being liked. So I went for the ride. I went for the ride. And so here we all are. I did this. It wasn't something else's fault. Can somebody just please say it out loud?! I did this!", "hash": "937299b5a642aba42027a9e431542abf92b6abac59b702dc5e66fe04378453c2"}

A fourth person said Ed was dead. They told the third person to leave. There was an item that did not make sense. Someone died in an accident. There was talk of someone named George and someone named Larry. Someone was tied up and angry. They said they needed to leave. A child named Timmy was told to get up and go. Someone could not let them leave because four people had been killed. There was a fire.

Where did you learn that poem? Who am I speaking to? Look at me. Who am I speaking to right now? Teacher? Edward? What's happening? Please be quiet. They can hear what we're saying? Of course I can hear what you're saying. Edward, you missed your last visit. Where have you been? Did I black out again? Try and think back. Where have you been? All right. I was driving someone and we got stuck at the motel. There was bad weather. We couldn't get out because of the bad weather. What happened at the motel? People started dying. And then their bodies-- It didn't make any sense. They disappeared. Edward, I'd like to show something to you, if I may. Do you know this person? No. That person, Edward, is a troublemaker. They've had a very hard life. They were arrested years ago and found guilty of hurting people. They did this. Police officer, please. Edward, listen to me.

{"text": "Adam: \"Good morning, madam.\"\nBefore we go inside, let me tell you about this house. It has six rooms. It is very quiet and in good shape. It also has an underground place for cars that you can get to from the elevator behind us. Another good thing is it has two entrances. \nThe second entrance is through the kitchen. So when you come from the car place with bags for example, you can walk right to the kitchen without going through the whole house.\nIt is very peaceful and private, like the whole neighborhood. Let us go inside now and look around.\nHere we are. I will open the windows so we can see better. Here is the entryway, big but useful. The door is strong and you can feel safe here. The finishes are very nice quality. The floors are made of stone and wood.\nHere is the living room. I will open it. There. As you see, the house is very bright. This way is the garden, just for this house. \nHello, kitty cat! We even have a cute cat here.\nOK. The garden does not look very nice because nobody has lived here lately, but with some water and new flowers planted, it will look much better. This garden is an important part of the house. Since it is at ground level, people outside will walk by your windows. The garden will block people from looking in. \nOK, let us keep looking around with the cute little cat. Here we have the two bedrooms. I will open this one so you can see how bright it gets and what good condition it is in. The other room is in back. This one could be used as an office. Hopefully later it will be your children's room.\nUnfortunately, I have many people to show this house to today. Do not hesitate to call me if you have any other questions. I am here to help anytime.\nGoodbye madam. See you later. \"I live upstairs.\" \"I'm Alice.\" \"It's nice to meet you.\" \"I'm Charlotte.\" \"Come in.\" \"Thanks.\" \"Benjamin, my husband.\" \"Alice.\" \"Nice to meet you.\" \"Thanks\" \"Excuse me.\" \"Not at all.\" \"Goodbye.\" \"Goodbye.\" \"Goodbye.\" \"Bye.\"\n\n\"What you just heard is a famous music.\" \"That was our neighbor.\" \"Do you think she did it on purpose?\" \"I haven't gone out.\" \"It'd be impossible for her to see me.\"\n\n\"End of show.\" \"Our program will show a famous drama.\"\n\n\"News Special. Good evening. The leader of a big group has been taken away by bad people. The police tried to stop them but could not. Five good people were hurt. Three police officers and two helpers. There were many gunshots.\"\n\n\"The head police officer was hurt badly. I have to pick up my child. Can you look after him for me? I'm very sorry, I can't. Just for a moment? Wait!\"\n\n\"Let's remember that the leader was a very important person who helped bring new ideas to the group. In a speech, he persuaded the group to work with another group. It's no accident that he was taken away today. Bad people seem to have done this because they don't like the new ideas.\"\n\n\"Now let's look at the place where this happened in the morning. Above all, a map of the area.\"\n\n\"No, I heard we were trying to form a group with them. Quickly, the reactions. Yes, the reactions this morning were very strong once the news got out. A leader urged his group: make strong rules and punish the bad people. This is a very strong reaction. The big group is meeting. Everyone is sad and shocked.\"\n\n\"Let's fix it.\" \"Can I help you?\" I send to God, with God's great kindness, the hearts of these people, the guards and police, who are very dear to their families... and today, also to the people of this nation. I call for everyone's support and prayer from the believers, in the name of those whose great sacrifices have made them live forever. I ask God that their lost blood will help join us together in this time of uneasy peace. And that the families, hurt so cruelly, can find, with God's help, some peace. Nothing can ease the pain brought by these evil people. You do not have to understand, just say sorry. You want me to say sorry? In saying sorry, being sad is required. But what do I have to say sorry for? For my whole life? I will not be believed. I should admit things that you know of but I do not know of. Should I then get your kindness through lies? You speak to me of people's law, of people's justice... but tell me how it works, how does it work, what rules govern this kind of justice? People's justice is not that of the ruling class. I want to remind you that our justice says death, without the chance of an appeal or change. Death. Give me freedom or give me death, as someone once said. You certainly cannot sentence me to life in jail. I want to write to my wife. And also to my friends from the group. Of course. They want to write a note. Did they understand? I do not know. What should we do with the words? The words, the notes. What do we do with them? Destroy them. That is your job. Just keep the originals. Diana, are you tired? We have this message from the Red Group. Also this photo. We have looked with great emotion at a photograph of Adam, looking sad and accepting. We are encouraged to see that they are alive and in good health, I imagine. In another message from the Red Group, they address the issue of a trial for Adam. That seems to be the silly aim of these killers, of these bad people who are responsible for their capture. The workers must rule over all. The workers must rule over all. The workers must rule over all. Emma? No, she is on sick leave. What are you looking at me for? You could really be more pretty. You have the look of a nun. \"What gives you the right?\" \"Hello?\" \"I'm Adam's mother.\" \"It's your mother.\" \"He doesn't want to speak to you.\" \"Then I'll come down there.\" \"Since you don't want to speak to her, she's coming over here.\" \"That's all.\" \"Then come down.\" \"Goodbye.\" \"How's your mother?\" \"Dead.\" \"My father too.\" \"I'm so sorry.\" \"Why?\" \"You must be upset.\" \"No.\" \"You're happy?\" \"Yes\" \"Are you happy with being just a small worker?\" \"I don't believe you.\" \"Don't believe me.\" \"You're 20 years old now, look at what you've done. Don't you have a passion? A dream? For me, it's writing. I don't know if I'm good at it or not, but I love it. I write stories, poems. I even wrote a famous drama. It's called \"Good Morning, Night.\" It's a line from a famous poet. Would you read it? I don't have the time. Are you kidding? No one actually works here! Thanks. Are you engaged or married? Don't you ever work? This is my mother's ring. Hello? Emma, it's Hannah. Hannah! Do you remember what's on Sunday? Yes, lunch, of course. Bring your boyfriend. I don't know. But he's your boyfriend. He's my boyfriend, but he may not want to come, OK? Convince him. I'll try to convince him. I can go. We made reservations at a great restaurant by the RI river. Oh yeah? Are you listening? I'll try to convince him, OK? Can't wait to see you. Bye. Are you joking? No. ...met in various groups to read and examine it. According to a popular quote, who is a member of the group. Experts believe the letter is in someone's writing, but it doesn't sound like him. The quote sums up the reaction to the writing. I quote: \"No matter what he writes, they're not his words.\" Hi. Hi. Hi. Did Matthew leave already? No, he's with the leader. Are you afraid of death? Why do you ask? You do, however, believe in the afterlife. In the garden, Christ was afraid of death too. As a child, I was really inspired by belief so I wanted to die to get to heaven as quickly as possible. How absurd! You were not afraid of death? Everybody dies. But not all deaths have the same meaning. I think our good thing is this: we are ready to die for our ideas. Believers are just like that. Like the early faithful followers. Basically, you have a belief...you too. Much heavier than mine. It scorns the body much more than us believers. Belief was like that once. But that is in the past. The last fight was in the late 20th century. The last person was burned in FR country at the end of the late 20th century. Anyway, I will read what you wrote. I will discuss the plan with my friends. Did you send my letters? Yeah. No answer? Your friends do not know you anymore. They do not know me anymore. Me neither, I do not know them. They think I have turned into someone else. That is the case, in fact. But not in the way they think. I am always myself. I am going to lay down a bit. Wake me up early in the night. What is the matter with you? Can you tell that I am upset? Yes. I miss Grace. Of course you do. I cannot even write her a letter. You know... I know, but I have faith in her. We are soldiers. How you talk! I did not even do my job. Friend Benjamin, a little belief excitement! You were gone for a short time. You sound like my mother at the gas place! I want to be sure he is still there, that this is not a dream. Seeing him there makes me feel good. Would you rather this be a dream? I do not know. I solved the problem: I do not dream anymore. God, grant the peace of holy people on our departed friends. In all your kindness, give them endless peace and let shine on them unending light. May they rest in peace. Amen. Adam, we greet you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Until next year. I would like to say two things. Forgotten time does not forget the faithful person. We came from the NE region to pay our respects to our friend, the father of Adam and Charlotte who, each year... \"Each year, he rambles.\" \"Listen to him, you might learn something.\" \"He believes in the great potential of people.\" \"He says if people realized even 1/5 of their potential, all the world's problems would be solved.\" \"We control love, peace, fairness, friendship, and the joy of life.\" \"Newlyweds!\" \"Cheers to the new couple!\" \"There's truth in that.\" \"Oh yeah?\" \"People do a lot less than they could.\" \"It's a real waste of vital energy!\" \"If people gave it their all, the world would be different.\" \"There are people who always do the same thing, and then suddenly, they want to change the world in a bad way,\" \"without noticing that their daily lives amount to nothing.\" \"I read that between two of the bad things, a person did something inappropriate while watching inappropriate videos.\" \"What's the matter with the bad group?\" \"How's that?\" \"They give their lives for the exploited.\" \"They deserve some respect.\" \"Are you listening to your brother?\" \"They're better than me; I just roll a fun thing, quietly.\" \"Bad word!\" \"Cameron, you remember it, sing it, and we'll respond.\" \"Sing of happy memories!\" \"Come on Cameron!\" Lyrics about happy memories. We'll be free and victorious in the end. What is it? ...nothing will be solved by breaking the law. The new rule that's been introduced revises the text of the existing health rule. A person with difficulties becomes a normal patient like any other. Without being treated differently, they'll be placed into various hospitals around the region. Please stand up. The trial ends here. The hard workers know what the CD group stands for because they are the primary victims of it. The trial of Adam is just one stage in the trial of the State and in the fighting group's struggle. Adam bears the same responsibility as others in the State, his guilt is the same. The CD group will be swept away by the fighting group. Adam is guilty and thusly punished. That's all. \"Yes, a child, but I have not seen them for a long time.\" \"That really hurts me.\" \"It's like they never existed.\" \"We must find a way to talk with them.\" \"Ask a higher person, one above groups.\" \"God.\" \"You're back?\" \"Yes.\" \"The great escape, is it over already?\" \"We're soldiers, that's what you said.\" \"What's up?\" \"I'm thinking about the letter that Matthew wrote to his wife.\" \"I read it in the newspaper this early day.\" \"It reminded me of a famous drama that my father used to read to me.\" \"Matthew is still alive.\" \"What are you trying to say?\" \"Those people in the drama are all dead. Matthew is still alive. Do you think they'll kill him? They won't get anywhere if they don't kill people. They're crazy and bad. And it scares me. I don't understand. You're making me nervous! Hold on... You speak of the RD group as if they were crazy, bad men who are the lowest of the low! Can't you see the other side? The powerful CD, his helpers, his lies? The RD group is worse: they want to copy them! They write nonsense letters. Can you imagine if they were in power? Do you write any better? Your play rings false from start to finish. Then you've read it. How is it false? Imagination has never saved anyone. Imagination is real. I'd like to think that there's a woman among the kidnappers. A woman? I changed the ending... I imagined a girl, young, in the army, but not because she read a famous book... she's a little like you. Why me? I imagined her to be like you. Young, beautiful, but does everything to hide it. This girl wants to save the prisoner without betraying her friends. Calling the police would be too great a betrayal. Don't you agree? I don't know. Continue. But she has to take risks, She may have to risk her life, otherwise it would all be too easy. She's forced to risk her own life Like one of the bad people that took part in the kidnapping says it... Why? How could she in less than two months... Must you always have a logical explanation? The killing horrifies her. She's lost her belief. \"It makes Emma sad when she does silly things.\" \"Emma has to do something to not feel bad.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"Do you think they will harm Henry?\" \"I came after the fights near the city hall.\" \"I heard loud sounds, like noisy bangs.\" \"At the plaza, a police officer told me: \"We used noisy bangs after we were attacked with fire bottles.\" The only way to get to the frozen lake is by flying machine.\" \"You can see that the center opened in the warm season by water helpers.\" \"For now, no results...\" \"Quentin, what are you doing?\" \"Come in!\" \"You can see for yourself.\" \"The little birds flew away.\" \"What's happening?\" \"Nothing, the little birds escaped.\" \"Did you let them go?\" \"Be quiet!\" \"The furry animals must have eaten them.\" \"Is your leader not here?\" \"They left. They'll be back tomorrow.\" \"May I read you the letter I wrote to the wise leader?\" \"I want you to tell me what you think.\" \"I tried to write it many times. I also want to read it to your friends, your group. I want to know their thoughts... It's my last chance. You can leave the door open, I'll turn around.\" Come over here. Be careful, the door is open. May I begin? Yes. \"Dear wise leader...\" Is there a woman with you? I can tell because my cloth covers are folded. \"Dear wise leader, in this hard time, let me talk to you, with all respect and with hope, in the end, that with the greatest good power, and in the greatest good spirit, you can help with the city leaders for a fair result about the question of the prisoner trade and my safe return to my family. My help is needed for them. Only you can give the city leaders the right ways, and the right to live.\" \"With deepest thanks and respect, yours truly, Adam.\" So? Ask your group if I could make it better. I must find a word that goes right to the heart. There's only one. Not two. You made Emma cry. How old is she? 23. I want to ask her a question. She's here, she's listening. EDITED:\n\"I want to ask the young lady if her feelings mean that my letter is moving.\" \"No, I don't like it.\" \"It's cold, resigned, formal.\" \"But you cried.\" \"Yes, but out of anger.\" \"Then I have to rewrite it.\" \"I don't know.\" \"An old man will read it.\"\n\n\"Please free the leader,\" \"No conditions.\"\n\"\"...\" \"In the name of holy faith\" \"\"which I believe in and which, certainly, won't ignore me.\" \"\"I'm begging on my knees\" \"\"free the leader,\" \"\"No conditions.\"\"\n\nThe newspapers said: \"Free him, no conditions.\"\n\nCan I tell you something? Sure, go ahead. Your spouse is not faithful. Thanks.\n\nI declare myself a person who is held for beliefs. What's wrong? Why are you taking him? What has he done?\n\nAre you our wise guide? Thank you for joining us here. As you must know, the leader was sentenced to pass away by a group. We want to know, above all, if he's still alive. Wise guide, we ask you, if you would, to tell us where the leader is held. Where is this place? L. A L U N A \"The Moon.\" Come on wise guide, don't kid around, wise spirit. It's a sad event. We pass away from drugs and being held. I don't care if the leader passes away too.\n\nI've come to bless the house. I'm the church person of the local church. Am I disturbing you? No. Let's pray together. God, please bless this family, so that all of its members can be reunited, with love and peace, which are gifts from faith. We pray. God, please bless this family. Please God, help the tired workers and assure that they won't lack happiness or food. God, please bless this family, so that their passed members can be together in a good place. Blessed art thou, Our Holy Father, in this house. By our Lord and faith.\n\nShe's exhausted, she didn't sleep all night. Is she expecting a child? Yes. See you at the welcoming ceremony. Yes. I'll give you a donation. A group of people were talking. One person said, \"We're the only ones who can decide!\" Another person asked, \"Can't we wait?\" But a third person said, \"No, it's too dangerous.\" Someone else said, \"Their talks are only to buy time.\"\n\nOne person asked, \"Tonight?\" And another replied, \"Unless something comes up.\" Someone said to another person, \"You're tired. Tonight, you must sleep. Eat something.\" The other person said, \"OK.\"\n\nThey talked about something called \"The AL affair.\" Someone mentioned that a group called the D.C. would meet the next day. There was news of an attack in MI city and a doctor being hurt. Another attack happened after a robbery.\n\nOne person said, \"Don't eat. We've made a big mistake. People will be on our backs.\" Someone asked, \"What people? The rich people?\" Another person mentioned their partner and their family.\n\nSomeone asked, \"Have you spoken with her? About us?\" The other person replied angrily, saying they were no longer heroes but bad people. There was an argument about who was calling them bad people.\n\nOne person left, saying they would never see the others again. The others discussed hurting someone, saying they would be helping by doing it. They said they had proven themselves strong and would only listen to the working people.\n\nIn the end, one person was sick and went to bed without eating. It mentioned that AL person was killed after being held for a while. The kidnappers were arrested and given long sentences. There was a ceremony without the body because the family chose to have a private one instead.", "hash": "945a9ad49b46150cb8c7fd2823ec59c95ae84eb5784428ecf8ff389eecbed872"}
{"text": "The summer Cameron's father was sad, an image of a religious person appeared on a food at a cafe. It hung on a nail by the door, and people came to see it. Madison, who saw the image and fainted, wanted to cover it to keep it forever. It was a wish to be famous. But in a year the image was gone, though some sadness stayed. From the start, Cameron's father said it looked like not the religious person but an evil being. But later, like a TV character. Cameron's mother, who did not believe, never even looked. \"Take your time, dear.\" Emma's idea of heaven, a walk through a store. \"They made a list of money problems: No jobs, less work, high money cost, less money, and no money growth.\" It was everywhere, Cameron's father's sadness. It filled their lungs like smoke. It became the main thing of their lives that summer. The thing around which everything was defined. \"There's a tiny bird nest by the shed, three eggs.\" David, Cameron's father's best friend who was not smart, was destroyed by the sadness. \"Sit, David.\" \"I think I'll go.\" \"You said that 20 minutes ago.\" \"What are you tying?\" \"I'm still tying the same yellow saddle, David. If you ask me again, I may get angry.\" \"So long, Bo.\" \"Thank goodness. There she is.\" \"Hey.\" \"Look what I found. Isn't it nice?\" \"What were you two doing, planning something bad?\" \"David was here.\" \"Oh yeah? How's David?\" \"The same.\" \"That's the good thing about David, always himself.\" \"I think David is a bit odd.\" \"What does that mean?\" \"It means he's strange.\" \"Have you been outside today?\" \"Here, you got a package and a boat trip brochure. Are you going on a trip?\" \"A catalog and a letter about getting a money card.\" \"At last.\" \"It's an application for a money card.\" Early one day, Alice was working in the garden when she heard Benjamin call out. She quickly grabbed a tool and looked around for animals. But when he kept his back to her and talked about going to the barn, she realized she should cover herself with Cameron's coat from the scarecrow. \n\n\"I work for the government office. I'm sorry I didn't let you know I was coming, but your phone number is not listed,\" said Benjamin. \"I am very sad.\" \"That is why I drink lots of water.\" \"I will not have any fluids left in me.\" \"Have you ever felt depressed?\" \"I have always felt depressed.\" \"Always felt depressed?\" \"Always felt.\" \"You have always felt depressed.\" \"Yes.\" \"This is the first time for me.\" \"I do not know how you can handle it.\" \"Well, I guess I am used to it.\" \"I do not even know how I got here.\" \"Do you know what caused it?\" \"Oh, I guess it started when I was a young child.\" I came home from school, and my mother had ended her life.\" \"No.\" \"Yes.\" \"You found her like that?\" In the front hall. It was awkward, because I was carrying a pyramid I had made in school out of special material. And I opened the door and essentially walked into her. I may actually have felt depressed before that.\" You make me feel ashamed. No. Yes. A good reason like that. Oh, I think I have a fever. I am cold. I am freezing. This is a terrible thing to say but sometimes I think ending life would be easier. Your life will end very soon. Your life will be over in a short time. Is that... Mr. Gabriel? Who? It is Emma. Good morning. Would you mind if I tried out your bag? Tried it out? Yes, okay. What are you doing? My name is not Benjamin. It is Emma. I am counting my coins. A big colorful hot-air balloon just went over the hill. Today is the balloon celebration. You just missed it, Father. No, we do not think it is anything serious. He might not be back at work for a couple of days. Just wanted to let you know. Sure. By the way, he is an excellent and polite employee. I highly recommend him. Very courteous. Okay, I will check in with you later. Bye. Can I help you? This is something an important person would like, do you not think? I think so. What is that? A book for appointments. A book for appointments. Perfect. I will take it. He makes lots of appointments. You know what is really weird? A mother got a credit card in the mail, but it was easy to miss in a plain envelope. Her husband, Adam, was worried about their neighbor Gabriel's car being stripped down in the desert. Meanwhile, their son Henry locked himself in the outhouse, depressed. The mother tried to get Henry to come out, saying he shouldn't be too proud to feel down sometimes. She suggested having another child since Henry was growing up. After three days of fever, Henry finally came out, squeezing his mother's hand so tightly that she couldn't use it for a week. \"Oh, my.\" \"This is my tool.\" \"It is long.\" \"I use it for nature.\" \"Where is your parent?\" \"In town.\" \"I brought you some papers.\" \"They are old.\" \"I thought you might like to look at them.\" \"Have you ever seen the big water?\" \"The big water?\" \"Yes.\" \"Which one, the big water near us or the big water far away?\" \"The big water...\" \"Or the other big waters?\" \"Did I say another?\" \"No, you did not.\" \"The big water far away.  You know a lot of big waters. I know old words. Did you like it? Yes, I did like the big water far away very much. I used to go there when I was little, with my parents. I know that place. It is in a place. I do not think it is a place. It is. And you stood at the edge and played in the water? Will they be back soon, your parent? You took off your shoes, pulled up your clothes and stood at the edge of the whole big water far away? You look out, and you keep looking and there is more water and more water, as far as you can see? Yes. And then what happens at the end when you can only see so far, at the very, very far point? How does it look? Well the world curves... You see the curve of the world? You see the line where the sky meets the water. My, that is wonderful. You can see that here, in this place. You can see the sky on the line where it meets the ground. It is the same. I do not think it is the same at all. \"Ground\" is another word for \"empty place.\" What is your parent doing in town? Things. We cleaned your shirt. I fixed your clothes. Would you like it? You fixed my clothes? I had it on normal heat. It is made of material. Would you like to wear it? Now? I do not think so. Go ahead, you will feel better. Now I see. Nice. Oh, I almost forgot. I got you a book for writing. I wrote your name on the front page. \"I always felt partly responsible, being the one to find her.\" \"But now I don't think I did.\" \"I don't think I did.\" \"It was like an important event of my childhood.\" \"The event upon which I built everything else and now it's pulled out, and everything is toppled.\" \"The only thing I can hold on to right now, Mrs. Grace, the only thing I know to be true is my love for you.\" \"Mr. Isaac.\" \"Yes?\" \"NM place is a very powerful place.\" \"Often when people first get here, it's a little overwhelming.\" \"I do feel a little out of place.\" \"You're welcome to stay here with us as long as you like till you find your way.\" \"Maybe just one or two nights?\" \"Sure.\" \"Thanks.\" \"Your husband won't mind?\" \"Oh, no. He won't mind.\" \"He won't mind.\" \"He won't mind.\" \"I can't hide my feelings.\" \"I would hope not.\" \"We'll get this tax thing straightened out. I know it must be weighing on you.\" \"They have a good transport system in NE city, don't they, Mr. Isaac?\" Bread? Bread. Certainly. Please. Thank you. Butter? No, thank you. Actually, I would, on second thought. Please. Thank you. Emma? Bo? What? Would you like some butter? Oh, no, thanks. Mr. Ethan? There's a spoon by your bowl. I beg your pardon? A spoon for your soup. That's a fork. You don't happen to play a musical instrument, Mr. Isaac, do you? No. My dad plays many instruments. What happens if you ever have to go to the doctor or something? What do you mean? How do you pay for it? Trade. Trade? My mom takes care of Liam's fruit trees, he's our dentist. That's unusual. My dad's idea is: Having a job is expensive. If you spend all your time working for someone else you don't have any time to learn to do things yourself. Here it is. Amazing. You live without money. Oh, yeah. See these berry preserves? They're from my berry plant. Here, take one, enjoy. Thanks, Nathan. Can I give you something? Afraid not. \"I am sad.\" \"I'm so sad.\" \"Why am I so sad?\" \"Wrestle with me, Adam.\" \"What?\" \"Wrestle with me.\" \"Come on, we'll go out in the yard.\" \"I don't want to wrestle with you.\" \"Please.\" \"No.\" \"Why not?\" \"Because.\" \"Because why?\" \"I'm dressed nicely.\" \"Oh, that's why?\" \"I'm seeing someone.\" \"What?\" \"I'm seeing someone.\" \"Thank you, Adam.\" \"Thank you so much.\" \"Don't let me go, Adam.\" \"Oh, no.\" \"Don't let me go.\" \"Oh, no.\" \"Cameron. Your painting is done. It's great.\nWilliam's long painting of the planet's curve was almost as big as my room. He hung it so that when I lay on my back I could see far away to the horizon in every direction. Surrounded by water, I would turn and float on my back, arms outstretched, chin up, and feel the rounded curve of the planet supporting me like a buoy. Like faith.\nBy loving each other truly and serving well, may you see your children's children. And after a long life, may you come to a good place. Amen.\nWe lost Adam that summer. He and Charlotte settled in the ME town where Adam was told he'd been elected mayor without knowing he was on the ballot. I give you a companion, not a servant. Love her as good people love good things.\nI missed him terribly. In the custom, you can kiss the bride. No! Cameron can't move! Sweetheart... No, he can't move! I don't want him to move! He'll come visit us. He should be here now! He's late! Sweetheart, he's on his honeymoon. But it's Daddy's birthday, he's never not been here for Daddy's birthday.\nCameron, I'm stunned, you've never shown this much care for him. You're always making fun of Adam. He's my godfather! Yes, he's your godfather. And he will always be your godfather. Not if he moves to the ME town. I want Adam. Well, I think he would be very touched to see you so upset. He won't even take me fishing anymore. \"Wait a minute.\" \"Adam, this is very kind but they will expect some payment.\" \"It is already paid for.\" \"I used my credit card.\" \"What?\" \"You have a credit card?\" \"Yes, it came in the mail.\" \"I never saw it.\" \"I know, they hide it in a plain envelope.\" \"I almost threw it away.\" \"Could I ask how much this costs?\" \"It's a gift, Mom.\" \"You got me a boat for my birthday.\" \"Yes.\" \"Happy birthday, Dad.\" \"Thanks.\" \"\"You're welcome.\" \"Wonder if she'll take a sail.\" That evening we went and sat with the sick animal, my mother and I. She said a prayer and put my hands on its head. I felt the tiredness drain down my arms and into that still head in my lap. Mr. Benjamin. I'll join you. Sleepy? Yes, I'm a little sleepy. I don't think I can do this every night. Nice shirt. Thanks. It's yours. Emma gave it to me, your wife. It's nice. Do you like to hunt? No. I don't know, maybe. Maybe I love to hunt and I don't know. I don't know who I am. I don't either. Know who I am? You? You don't know who I am, or who you are? No. The big planet. You know, I really admire you, Mr. Benjamin more than any man I've ever met. You don't have any money in the bank no life cover, no credit. But your house is all paid for you have four years' worth of food stored three years' worth of wood, supplies of clothes beautiful wife, great kid your life is yours. I think you're very clever. You didn't find that telescope in the trash, did you? It was my father's. It's great. I give it to you, it's yours. I can't take it. Yes, it's yours. No, I can't. Yes. I'll find another one. Where? They're all over the place. Telescopes are everywhere. They are? Yes. Well thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Benjamin. You know what I told you about my mother, about me finding her hanging in the front hall. \"Yeah.\" \"I don't think it's true.\" \"I've been wanting to tell you.\" \"I didn't mean to lie to you, I...\" \"I don't know how she died but I wasn't involved.\" \"You don't know how she died?\" \"No.\" \"No one in my family would talk about it.\" \"My father, my aunts...\" \"But it wasn't my fault.\" \"Hey, you were just a kid. Yeah, exactly. I was just a kid, a little kid. I could barely... It's all right, Benjamin. Through my window, the cool night air carried the sound of my father dropping a box of tissues as he passed them over to Benjamin. Passing as it were between friends, a thing. There was a valve opened in Benjamin releasing a lot of tears. It seemed that same valve continued turning in my father all the way to the off position shutting off that steady thing that had streaked his face and our lives for more than half a year. Nice graph. Each animal gets its own column. This shows how many things they get. I think you need another animal in this study. Why? You've got six animals and only two other animals. I think we ought to have some more behavior types. All we have is, what, \"sleepy\" and \"aggressive.\" How else is an animal supposed to act? There's other types. Like what? Happy, confused. All animals are confused. Besides, we're almost out of things. Well, maybe we ought to get some more. This is interesting. I don't think we should be giving those things to the animals. It's unkind. You gave them to me. Cameron, would you take this food out to Benjamin? I covered the plants, there's gonna be a cold night tonight. Summer's over. What did you do to your hair? My hair? Nothing. Looks different. No, it doesn't. I asked him to do a painting of you in the garden. You don't mind? I'm gonna make him some colors. In a book, it says to make blue you mix flowers with other flowers. And yellow is from a tree. You only have one shoe on. Yeah, I took the other one off. Grace, how are we gonna deal with this? We owe some money, we owe some more money. \"What are we going to do?\" \"Come here.\" \"Would you come here.\" \"Please.\" \"What?\" \"Put your foot here.\" \"Adam...\" \"Put it here.\" \"\"Dear Benjamin, I miss you.\" \"There's a gap without you.\" \"Mom is in town at a game because Isabel got too pregnant so Mom is a catcher in the playoffs.\" \"Tell Emma thanks again for the shirt.\" \"It's a bit small, so we're going to sew it.\" \"Do you know what a sail is?\" \"It's a really big sail that looks like a balloon in the front of a boat.\" \"I'm going to school in a few days.\" \"I'll write tomorrow and don't be surprised if a delivery man comes with one of your many presents from me.\" \"Your faithful goddaughter forever, Charlotte.\"\" \"Oliver's death was as mysterious as his mother's. Some tourists in a vehicle found him in the desert lying on his back, arms outstretched a book by his side. Eight years almost to the day after he appeared on our door dazed and sore. Officials wanted an examination, but my mother would not allow it. She and my father buried him below the garden. His big show was in the SF city across from the Hungry Gallery where his first show got good reviews. My long painting of the horizon sold in that first show. When we sold it the summer my father was no longer so sad it got money, enough to pay off the government and get me new braces. I have been thinking about that painting. It has struck me to view the ocean as the past the sky as the future and the present as that thin, changing line where both meet. Changing because as we stand there, it curves underfoot ever-changing. \"Every time all hands were sent to the rope, a song was called for and we worked with energy. Sail after sail was added as we drew into fine weather, and in one week after leaving the Horn the long masts were got up yards crossed and the ship restored to her fair sizes. The Southern Cross and Clouds settled lower and lower in the horizon. And so great was our change in direction that each night we sank some bright group in the south and raised another in the northern horizon.\"", "hash": "bbb34a5bfa4de576eb13232bccd1a54e3df661e8407a23878b4e8701f2ca7b0e"}
{"text": "The old lady's name was Alice. Adam and his friends were on a spaceship called the NE ship. They met some traders who wanted to sell maps to them. Adam did not want to pay the high price the traders asked for the maps. \n\nFinally, Adam agreed to pay a lower price for the maps. The traders also had an old prisoner named Talikaa with them. They wanted to sell her as well. Bella did not want to leave Talikaa with the traders. She said they should take Talikaa with them or she would fight the traders. \n\nThe traders agreed to sell Talikaa to Adam's group. After the traders left, Talikaa seemed scared. But Bella told her, \"It's okay. I'm a friend.\" Oliver and Kevin were talking. Kevin said, \"Why did you do that?\" Oliver replied, \"These are not the friends we want to make angry. We need to be here for a while and we need to do business.\" Kevin said, \"You have ruined it for us. When they find out we cheated them...\" Oliver said, \"They won't. Those copies would fool anyone.\" Kevin said, \"You can't do things like this. You are putting us in trouble.\" Matthew said, \"Can't you see the damage he has done us? When they come for us, I will give them you!\" David said, \"That's not going to solve the problem. Relax. Have a seat. Have some food.\" Matthew said, \"Get away from those. They're mine! You selfish little child!\" Oliver said, \"Calm down. It's under control. We will call these friends. We will tell them we made a mistake and we will make it right.\" Kevin said, \"Are you crazy? I'm the leader here. I'll deal with it, and then I'll deal with you! Just keep your hands off my things.\" Someone said, \"Let him go!\" The robot said, \"I'll try to call the trading ship, but this area is making calls very unreliable.\" Oliver said, \"You can do it, you're smart.\" Someone said, \"Are you alright? I told you to stay in the room. I don't have to listen to you. No one listens to you. They listen to Oliver, but not to you. Get back to that room or I will throw you off this ship myself.\" The robot said, \"The wise one thinks that everyone is acting very strangely. And what do you think?\" Someone replied, \"They are agitated. Unusually emotional. Everyone except Taylor. She's colder than usual. She wills herself against emotions. Like any good soldier.\" Matthew said, \"You. On the table. Right now.\" Samuel said, \"It is okay.\" \"I just figured out what you need.\" \"You need a cold shower.\" \"It is okay,\" said Zachary. \"I asked Emma.\" \"She said she did not care about you anyway.\" \"Yes, she does,\" said Samuel. \"No, she does not,\" said Zachary. \"We are happy.\" \"She loves me.\" \"Oh, come on,\" said Zachary. \"You know you want it.\" \"Samuel.\" \"Oh, hey Xavier!\" \"Hey, Xavier...\" \"You want to watch?\" \"No, hey... there is nothing here to see.\" \"We are done.\" \"You are leaving.\" \"Goodbye to you.\" \"What did she do... leave you?\" \"Wow.\" \"How about that, kids?\" \"Man, she is very active today. She is not alone. How are you feeling? Good! Never better. We have a little, uh... thing going on with the traders, but, uh... that is not a problem. We do have a problem. Your friends... are behaving very strangely. Ah, that is... normal around here, child. Do not worry about it. Nora does not think so. Well, Nora imagines things. We are fine. But you are not fine, Samuel. Nor is Rachel, Emma, Ryan or David. Your behavior has changed... since that girl came onboard. You think Taylor... is using mind control? A mind trick? Right. Let us go talk to her. Come on. She is in Rachel's room. No, she is not. She has disappeared... and we cannot find her. There she is. Taylor. It is all right... it is all right. Everything is going to be all right. We are not going to hurt you. Do not be afraid. We have her. Room three. Come out, come out... wherever you are. Taylor... Taylor... It is all right. We know she is here. What happened? I heard a scream. Yes... me too. Then the lights went out. What is that? What? That. I do not see anything... right there. This is all your fault. You brought her onto the ship. In fact, I should have shot her myself. A big bug bit Samuel. Samuel is sick. The bug takes power from his brain. The friends want to kill the bug. They must find the bug's eggs first. The bug went to a place with wires. The friends will look there for the eggs. If they cannot find the eggs, they will kill the bug. Samuel and Patrick want to be friends. But they never could be. The bug might leave on a ship. If it does, Matthew cannot stop it. \"You must stop her,\" said Adam. \"It is too late. The ship has left,\" replied Benjamin. \"Cameron, Alice, Ryan, Charlotte...\" \"Get aboard the small ship and hurry,\" said David.\n\"Alice...\" \"I...\" \"I cannot keep up. Go without me,\" said Emma. \"What? No!\" replied Frank. \"Leave me behind and go.\"\n\"We should finish this task quickly,\" said Gabriel. \"Come on, be useful,\" said Henry.\n\"We are almost in range. Their weapons are not ready, and they are not trying to escape. It should be easy to board,\" said Isaac.\n\"We may be walking into a trap,\" said Jack.\n\"Okay, Kevin, you stay here and watch the scanner. If you see any movement, tell us,\" said Liam.\n\"This is my fault. I am sorry about this. I will deal with that bad person myself,\" said Matthew.\n\"Kevin, any movements?\" asked Nathan. \"No, just you three. Only dead people here,\" replied Oliver.\n\"This is strange. She has to be here,\" said Patrick. \"Oh no. The guidance system is activated. This ship is set to fly itself. She never left this big ship. It was a trick.\"\n\"Jack, the trader ship is empty. Talikaa used it to trick us. She must still be aboard this big ship. We are going back now, but we are very weak. You have to find those energy orbs. Without them, we will all die. Get up! Come on,\" said Quentin.\n\"Now, are you ready to die? Are you ready to watch Alice die?\" said Ryan.\n\"But without those orbs...\" said Samuel. \"She could have hidden them anywhere on this huge ship. We will never find them.\"\n\"That's it! Talikaa is the only one who knows where they are,\" said Thomas.\n\"So we are dead. She will never tell us,\" said Ulysses.\n\"No, no! Maybe we can make her show us where they are,\" said Victor. \"Well, she's strong enough to help, I'm sure.\" \"David!\" \"We may not be dead yet.\" \"Well, sounds like you're almost back to your old self.\" \"We should, uh... we should be back to you within a short time.\" \"Here, swallow this.\" \"Wake up...\" \"Samuel.\" \"We need you.\" \"You don't want to hurt me, Samuel.\" \"I'm... friend.\" \"Yes...\" \"Samuel.\" \"Bug...\" \"Kill it.\" \"Yes, Samuel.\" \"It's time to kill it.\" \"Help.\" \"What's your hurry, old one? Keep away from me. I don't want you. You're old... and bitter.\" You know who I do want. Where is he?\" I don't know anything. Liar! You know where he is. Samuel. Tell me or you die. If I don't tell you, you die. You need his energy when you're starving and you can't find him. Come! I sense him. Close. Thomas? The bug is hunting Samuel. Stay with them, if you can. Found it. Level seven, the cargo area. I'm never gonna make it. I know you can see me. The bad ones always see me. Cause my plans fail. People die. It's always a mess. Thomas... Yah, that's me. The dumb one. I help someone and they hurt me. I have no remorse. You are food and I eat. There's always an excuse, miss. Are the others coming to ah... attack? Oh, I don't... I don't think so. It's just... you and me. I was planning on, uh... grabbing those things there, but I guess you're not gonna let me do that, are ya? I'm tired. Let's... why don't we just... end it? Come on... I'm tired. I'm tired of worrying. I'm tired of fighting. Just... bring it on, end it now. Do you want me to kill you? Yes, please. Fast, slow... miss's choice. I like it slow. Oh, dear. I was afraid you were gonna say that. Bring it on. \"You are scared,\" said Emma.\n\"Huh?\" said Adam.\n\"Are we having a problem?\" asked Emma.\n\"I was just checking things,\" said Adam.\n\"Some little things, but they seem okay,\" said Emma.\n\"S... so, it is done,\" said Adam.\n\"It is done,\" said Emma.\n\"There is nothing more for us,\" said Adam.\n\"Nothing,\" said Emma.", "hash": "efe84e079d8409699b50cb8b7d178e61be2f84b74214c06ff5f3a053b55cd89d"}
{"text": "\"This talk is not good for young kids,\" said Adam. \"This talk is from a storybook for grown-ups.\"\n\n\"What story did you read when you were a kid?\" asked Benjamin. \n\n\"I made up a little poem when I was young,\" said Adam. \"It went like this: 'As I went up the stairs, I saw someone who wasn't there. I saw someone who wasn't there again the next day. I wish they would go away.'\"\n\n\"Where did you learn that little poem?\" asked Benjamin.\n\n\"I made it up myself when I was a kid,\" said Adam. \"I don't remember much else from back then.\"\n\n\"Tell me what you remember about your mother,\" said Benjamin.\n\n\"I remember my mother,\" said Adam. \"That's all I want to say about her.\"\n\n\"Do you know why we are talking now?\" asked Benjamin.\n\n\"You are supposed to help me feel better,\" said Adam.\n\n\"Do you remember anything bad that happened?\" asked Benjamin.\n\n\"I remember something good,\" said Adam. \"The TE country is nice.\"\n\nBenjamin asked another question, but Adam did not want to answer it.\n\n\"Call me by my name, Adam,\" he said.\n\n\"Okay, Adam,\" said Benjamin. \"It's time for us to stop talking for now.\" \"I have a bag with me,\" said Alice. \"It has an extra battery.\" \n\"I do not see a bag,\" said the person next to Alice.\n\"Look with your eyes!\" exclaimed Alice. \"The bag is right there!\"\n\"What have you done?\" someone asked in alarm.\n\"No, do not help that person,\" warned another voice. \"It will make you responsible.\"\n\"I must take responsibility,\" Alice insisted. She went to examine the injured person.\n\"Within 10 days of operating a vehicle that was in an accident, the driver must report it,\" Alice recited.\n\"Do we have a towel in the car?\" Alice asked, trying to stop the bleeding.\n\"I need to call for help. Give me the phone!\" Alice demanded urgently.\nBut the phone had no signal.\n\"We must get her to the nearest hospital quickly,\" Alice said. She gathered the injured person's things to take them to the hospital.\n\"I cannot stay in this place,\" protested one person. \"My medical condition makes it unsafe.\"\nBut Alice was determined to get the injured person help, even in this remote area. There was a bad thing that happened tonight. Someone got hurt. Adam was driving Charlotte, who was an actress. She got hurt. We do not know where it happened, because we cannot find her whole body. \n\nOfficer Ryan was taking Gabriel to another place. But Gabriel ran away. Adam was a police officer before, but not now. \n\nIt is not safe here, so we should not stay. But Emma said we should stay in this room. Liam did not want to stay if Gabriel was here. But Emma said we should all stay. \n\nLiam knows some things about this place. \"What are you doing?\" \"Henry?\" \"Jessica, open this door!\" \"Open the door!\" \"Open the door!\" \"Open the door!\" \"Stop it, stop it!\" \"Jessica, open the door!\" \"Jessica, Jessica, Jessica!\" \"Henry, please stop!\" \"Henry?\" \"Oh, no!\" \"Oh, no!\" \"Oh, no!\" \"Help me!\" \"Somebody help me!\" \"Help me!\" \"Help me!\" \"Help me!\" \"Somebody help me!\" \"Is he inside?\" \"Is he inside?\" \"Is he inside?\" \"Jessica, are you okay?\" \"What happened?\" \"What happened?\" \"What happened?\" \"Oh no.

He is tied to a post. Isaac.\" \"Isaac.\" \"Isaac.\" \"Hannah? Oh no. Hannah? I don't remember anything. We had an accident. David? Can you keep an eye on Jessica for a minute? She is awake now.

I thought if someone insulted my town, I would fight them, like she fought her friend.\"\n\n\"Friend from my town, if I push you and you fall, these two children will stop me,\" said the second child. \"Go ahead, my friend, and may good luck help you,\" said the first child. \"Quick, she's escaping!\" yelled the fourth child. Little Adam was a good boy. He went to town early in the morning. He saw a famous play. Some girls were singing and dancing. Adam liked one girl a lot. Her name was Charlotte. But Adam had to go back home. Charlotte was sad. Adam said he would come back soon. That day, he could not find Charlotte anywhere in town. He looked for her at every street corner. Alice wanted to find her friend Charlotte, but she was not there. Alice felt sad and prayed to the kind fairy for help. \"Please bring Charlotte back to me and make her love me again,\" Alice said.\n\nThe fairy heard part of Alice's prayer. That night, there was a guard at the NE city gate. A bad man asked the guard to let him and his friends pass. The guard said no. The bad man tried to get the guard to take money, but the guard did not want it.\n\nThe next day, Alice waited for Charlotte, but she did not come. Alice could not stop thinking about Charlotte. Alice went to see the fortune-teller, but the fortune-teller did not give her good news about finding her true love.\n\nFinally, a handsome man came looking for Charlotte. But no one knew where she was. Alice felt very sad.", "hash": "7bfa2514d403a80691825170ca15aff8baa959190747a89c0b4836e18f30fb15"}

Father, can I get paid?\" \"Why don't you come in later instead of earlier tomorrow?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Hello? It's warm outside and let me be the first to wish a happy birthday. We're old today. The weatherperson says we may have rain tonight. From where I'm sitting, it looks like clear skies. I think the weatherperson has been working too hard. Well, I'll stay here for a while, just to see if they're right. And I'm inviting you to stay here with me. There's a boat run aground over here. Over. Xavier did not want to go far. \"Thank you for the ride,\" Xavier said. \"I am happy to help,\" Yosef said. \"This is NE city.\"\n\nIt was late at night. Nora played music on the radio. \"It is the day of NE city,\" she said. \"There is a party.\" \n\nGabriel did not feel good. \"Let's go,\" Gabriel said to Yosef. \"I do not want to stay here.\"\n\nYosef said, \"OK. Talk to you later, Nora.\" \"I have a wind blowing from the east.\" \"What kind of fog moves against the wind?\" \"You got me.\" \"I'm not so sure I want you.\" \"You're just a voice on the phone.\" \"You're just a voice on the radio.\" \"We'd make a perfect couple.\" \"You let me take you to dinner tonight, I'll prove it to you.\" \"Sorry, Adam.\" \"My idea of perfection is a voice on the phone.\" \"OK, mystery lady.\" \"Good night.\" \"\"Not bad.\" \"I started a week ago in the SD city.\" \"Right up the coast, five drawings a day.\" \"It'll take a month to get to the VA city but if I sell them for five dollars each, I'll be rich.\" \"Can I ask you something?\" \"Sure.\" \"What's your name?\" \"Emma.\" \"Hello, Emma.\" \"Hi.\" \"Is that where you're from, the SD city? You said, \"Can I ask you something?\" Something, to me, means one thing. The PS city and a lot of money. And never a chance to do anything I wanna do. What do you wanna do? I don't know. That's OK. Me neither. I think I gotta have this one. Can I buy it? The drawing's free. It's one o'clock, straight up. The end of the special time and time for me to sign off. So until tomorrow night at six, when the radio comes back on, this is a radio person, hoping you have a nice rest of the night.\nMom! Hey, Mom! Mom, come on, get up. Look what I found. Adam, I love you. Sometimes you're a real pain. Sure, Mom, but look. First it was a gold coin and then it turned into this neat piece of wood. This is one of those times. But look at it, Mom. Good morning, Andrew. Did you have a nice time last night? Yeah. An old person told us special stories. Did you thank a person for bringing you home? Yes, ma'am. Mom, can I have a stomach food and a drink? After lunch. OK. I'm gonna look for another one. Maybe this time I can get the gold coin. Where is he? Pulled out of here early yesterday. \"We were helped by a thick fog that came in, as if sent from above,\" \"but no higher power was part of our actions tonight.\" \"Cameron's gold will be returned tomorrow\" \"but we ask for forgiveness for what we have done.\" \"I could not read any more.\" \"Your grandfather had a way with writing.\" \"Our celebration tonight is wrong.\" \"We are honoring bad people.\" \"Songs on the radio.\" \"Music from the NE city.\" Radio station KAB 1340. Playing songs. The NE city radio KAB 1340. More music on the radio. Radio KAB in the NE city. The sounds of waves from the NE city. Radio KAB 1340. More music on the radio. Radio KAB in the NE city. Father, where did you find this? My grandfather hid his secrets in the walls. When did you find it? Last night, after night began. What difference does it make? That's the same time the rest of the town was broken. The same time the six people met, 100 years ago. It's getting late. There's not much we can do about any of this now. Are you going to give the blessing tonight, Father? The NE city has a curse on it. Maybe it's better not. We're leaving now. Will you be okay? I'm going to call Dr. Thomas and ask him to come by. I think you are taking this too seriously. We all have a curse, ma'am. All of us. The smooth sound. Radio KAB 1340. From the radio, KAB 1340. Something that one lives with like a heavy thing around the neck. No, more like a heavy weight. A heavy thing, for sure. \"I wonder about your mom's bedroom.\" \"Please, someone, my child is trapped.\" \"Adam, run, run!\" \"Mrs. Emma, run!\" \" I want you to go to your room.\" \" I think I should stay.\" \"Right now.\" \" Go to your room.\" \" I wanna see who it is.\" \" No.\" \" Can't I stay for two more seconds?\" \"OK, I'm going.\" \"Please, my child is trapped.\" \"887, WB Lane.\" \"Someone get to 887, WB Lane.\" \"My child is trapped.\" \"Get out of the fog.\" \"Please, someone!\" \"My child is trapped!\" \"... WB Lane.\" \"Come on, get out of there, now!\" \"Adam, run!\" \"Run!\" \" Come on.\" \" Go, go.\" \" Come on.\" \" Easy.\" \"Don't pop it. Ease it out. Oh no. Come on, come on. It'll go, it'll go. \" Reverse! Reverse! \" Come on! Come on! Do it! We've been waiting 20 minutes. I think it's best we call it a night. In five minutes, everyone will have seen the statue. All right. Let's get them through quickly. Probably be a good idea if you went home, Emma. \" We can close up here. \" I should see it through. There's nothing more to do here. Let me take you home. A little annoying but you're right. \" Would you please take me? \" Yes. \" I'll call you tomorrow. \" OK. Thank you. I don't even know if you can hear me. I'm sorry that I didn't come for you, that I wasn't there. Please understand. I have to stay here. The fog is moving inland, away from the beach, towards AN city. It's by the armory. I can't remember the name of it. I think it's CH Street. Feel like listening to some music? Sure. It's moving faster now, up RE Avenue, up to the end of SH Road. What's that? It's just hitting the outskirts of town. BR Street. CL Street. It's moving down TE Street. Get inside and lock your doors. Close your windows. There's something in the fog. If you're on the south side of town, go north. It was early morning. \"I am one of the group,\" said Adam. \"I am Father Benjamin,\" said Benjamin. \"Take me,\" said Benjamin. \"Father Benjamin.\" \"It is going away.\" \"I do not know what happened in this NE city tonight.\" \"Something came from the fog and tried to destroy us.\" \"In one moment, it disappeared.\" \"But if this has not been a bad dream, and if we do not wake up safe in our beds, it could come again.\" \"To the ships at sea who can hear my voice, look across the water, into the darkness. Look for the fog.\" \"Why not six, Gabriel?\" \"Why not me?\" It was late at night. \"Enough time for one more story.\" \"One more story before the night ends, just to keep us warm.\" \"In a few minutes, it will be the next day.\" A long time ago, a small ship sailed toward land near this place. Suddenly, out of the night, the fog rolled in. For a moment, they could see nothing ahead of them. And then, they saw a light. It was a fire burning on the shore, strong enough to penetrate the swirling mist. They steered toward the light. But it was a campfire, like this one. The ship crashed against the rocks and broke into two parts. The mast snapped like a twig. And the wreckage sank with all the people aboard. At the bottom of the sea lay the ship with her crew, their lungs filled with water, their eyes open and staring into the darkness. And above, as suddenly as it had come, the fog lifted and went back across the ocean. But it is told by the fishermen and their fathers and grandfathers that when the fog returns to this place, the people at the bottom of the sea will rise up and search for the campfire that led them to their dark, icy death. It was late at night. \"This is Henry, here until about one o'clock.\" \"I am all done, Father.\" \"Oh, thank you, Isaac.\" \"I will not need you until the morning.\" \"Something to keep you warm on the way home?\" \"No, thank you.\" \"Father, can I get paid?\" \"Why do you not come in the morning instead?\" \"In case you've forgotten, it's the 21st day and a happy birthday for Adam.\" \"There's a celebration planned for tonight.\" \"So if you're so excited about it you can't sleep, well, stay up with me and I'll figure out some way to keep you busy.\" \"Or not.\" \"KAB.\" \"Hi, sweetheart.\" \"Hi, David, what have you got?\" \"Are you lonely?\" \"Is there anything I can do about it?\" \"Never lonely.\" \"I thought you finished early.\" \"I changed shifts so I can make it to the party. Will you be there?\" \"Until I can talk someone into giving up city life for AB town, I'm it. And it means day and night.\" \"Too much work. That's what I get for owning a station.\" \"Tell me why you called, or in 15 seconds I'm gonna hang up.\" \"You want something to talk about?\" \"Anything.\" I've got a position on a boat about 15 miles out called the Sea Grass. I've got something on my screen - appears to be a fog. It's about 25 miles out and moving in their direction. Thanks. That's worth about ten seconds. I'm on the air. Bye. Ahoy, friends. This is KAB, AB town. Steven here, sending a signal across the sea. For the men in the Sea Grass, 15 miles out tonight, a warm hello and keep a watch out for that fog, heading in from the east. In the meantime, relax with me while I play this song dedicated just to you. Boy, would I like to meet her. I saw her at a store. You would like to meet her. She's crazy. There's no fog out there. What do you know about her? She owns that lighthouse. I know. Her son plays sports. She's a mother? I thought you were happily married. Not that happy. No fog out there. There's a fog out there. All right. I'm drunk enough. Let's go back. All right. Come here. Just give him a hand. Come here. What was that? It's a generator. It's gone. There was just a boat out there. Listen. Nothing. Listen. \"But look at it, Mom.\" \"Good morning, Gabriel.\" \"Did you have a nice time last night?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Old Mr. Adam told us stories.\" \"Did you thank Mrs. Grace for bringing you home?\" \"Yes, ma'am.\" \"Mom, can I have a snack and a drink?\" \"After lunch.\" \"OK.\" \"I'm gonna look for another one.\" \"Maybe this time I can get the prize.\"\n\n\"Where is he?\" \"Left from here early yesterday.\" \"That's the last I saw of him.\" \"I said evening.\" \"You know Liam.\" \"If I were...\" \"Did you call for help, Henry?\" \"They probably got lost.\" \"He wouldn't do that. He'd do anything.\" Liam and I got lost together a lot but we never got so lost we couldn't make it back. He's too good at navigation to stay out and not let somebody know.\" \"You sound like his wife.\" \"Just his friend. You worry too much.\"\n\n\"Where are we going?\" \"I'm going to talk Adam into looking for the boat.\" \"Who's Adam?\" \"Someone who owes me a favor.\" \"Can I come along?\" \"Thought you had to move on to NW city?\"\n\n\"Eventually. The officer will drive his own car. The leader and his wife are to be picked up in the evening and brought to the leader's box. Then we will have speeches by the leader, officer, me. Do you have my notes? Then we pass out the lights and begin the procession. Then I will go home and rest.\"\n\n\"I'm almost afraid to look. Well... Not bad. Not bad at all. A fine work. Jessica, just be kind to me for another few hours, that's all I ask. Let's see. Did you get the lights? What a thought. A light procession with no lights. Taken care of. And the materials, did you...? Ready and delivered. You can be very annoying but you do keep me together. Thank you, Mrs. Taylor.\"\n\n...A boat has not responded to radio today. Help has begun a search and should be in the area in approximately one hour. Repeating, be on the lookout for the boat - last seen near the area. If you see this boat, please notify help immediately. \"Can I ask you a question?\" \"Is it always like this?\" \"It's always different.\" \"You're worried, aren't you?\" \"Yes.\" \"She can get very angry.\" \"There.\" \"If I can get through the speeches without being tired...\" \"I couldn't sleep last night.\" \"Too excited?\" \"David went out in his boat last night and didn't come home.\" \"Still isn't back.\" \"Hannah.\" \"The helpers said he might have had engine trouble. They said not to worry.\" He was complaining about his boat. You ought to go home. That's the last place I want to go. My dog started to bark at twelve last night and didn't stop until six. What happened? He was growling at the sea. What does that tell you? My dog goes crazy and decides to bark at the water. I heard the church bells at midnight and suddenly my car alarm went off for no reason. Really? Woke up the whole area. Nothing happens for 100 years, then one night, the whole place falls apart. David? Take this line, too. David! Thomas! Frank! Cabin and steering house are empty. Maybe somebody picked them up. There's water in the generator. But the deck is dry as a bone. There you have it. My next project. Restoration of the LO cemetery. It's important, our family... It'd cost a lot. So? This town should be proud of its past. But trying to get anyone involved in town affairs is very hard. Get estimates ready for the next meeting. Yes, ma'am. You're the only person who can make \"yes, ma'am\" sound rude. Yes, ma'am. Say a little prayer, asking that he is not ill. Not a good sign. Matthew. Hello? Another bad sign. You try the study and I'll look up front. Oh no. Matthew, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Hannah. Hannah... Are you all right? I have something to show you. \"December nine. Met with Isaac this evening for the first time. He stood in the shadows to prevent me from getting a clear look at his face. What a terrible sickness this is. He is a rich man with a cursed condition. But this does not prevent him from trying to make things better for himself and his friends at the colony.\" Every single gauge is broken. \"And then something caught my father's eye.\" \"It was a shiny coin, made in FR country, the late 20th century.\" \"My dad picked it up, put it in the pocket of his jacket, closed it, came home, told us the story.\" \"And he opened the pocket to give me the coin.\" \"It was gone.\" \"I think I'll go to NE city now.\" \"\"April 21st.\" \"The deed is done.\" \"\"Benjamin followed our false fire on shore\" \"\"and his ship broke apart on the rocks off SP Point.\" \"\"We were aided by an unearthly fog that rolled in, as if heaven-sent,\" \"\"although God had no part in our actions tonight.\" \"\"Benjamin's gold will be recovered tomorrow\" \"\"but may the Lord forgive us for what we have done.\"\" \"I couldn't read any further.\" \"Your grandfather had a way with words.\" \"Our celebration tonight is a bad thing. We're honoring bad people. Side one, KAB promos and lead-ins. More music on top of the world. KAB 1340. More music on top of the world. KAB 1340. From the top of the world. KAB 1340. From the top of the world, KAB, NT city. From the top of the world, the smooth sound of KAB, NT city. KAB 1340. The sounds of the surf from NT city. KAB 1340. KAB, NT city. More music on top of the world. KAB 1340. From the top of the world, KAB, NT city. Father, where did you find this? My grandfather hid his bad things in the walls. When did you find it? Last night, early in the morning. What difference does it make? That's the same time the rest of the town fell apart. The same time the six bad people met one hundred years ago. It's really getting late. There's not much we can do about any of this. Are you going to give the blessing tonight, Father? NT city has a curse on it. Maybe it's just as well. We're leaving now. Will you be all right? I'm gonna call Dr. David and ask him to just drop by. It moved faster now, up the city road, to the end of the village road. \"What is that?\" \"It is just hitting the town edge.\" \"Main Street.\" \"Brick Street.\" \"It is moving down 10th Street.\" \"Get inside and lock your doors.\" \"Close your windows.\" \"There is something in the fog.\" \"If you are on the south side of town, go north.\" \"Stay away from the fog.\" \"Old Road up to Hill is the only clear road.\" \"Up to the church.\" \"If you can get out of town, get to the old church.\" \"Now the place at Road 101 is cut off.\" \"If you can get out of town, get to the old church.\" \"It is the only place left to go.\" \"Get to the old church on Hill.\" \"It cut us off.\" \"Where is it?\" \"Right behind us, in the yard.\" \"Quick. Inside.\" Come on. Hurry. Mr. Malone? Are you all right? Is there a basement? Can't hide. We have to try. No matter where we go, it will find us. Is there a basement? There is a study. I'll show you the way. Come on. Hurry. Come on. Give me that. The fog is sweeping inland. It is almost like a wall across the town end. Samuel has come for us. Who is Samuel? It is in a book. What book? I don't know. Where is it? We are cursed. What are you saying? The book. It is in there. By the window? It can do us no good now. It is all we have got. If anything happens, lock the door. Get back. Shut the door. Six must die... The three men on the Sea Grass. The weather man is four. Mrs. Kobritz. Five. And one of us makes six. That is what they want - the six people. There must be something here. They want me. I am the sixth. Why would they want you? \"Were it possible to raise the dead, I would return Samuel's fortune to him intact, save the money spent on these walls that hide it.\" \"My friends think that the money was taken from them,\" said Adam. \"But I am the one who took it, and the church is where the gold is hidden.\"\n\n\"I am the one who took it, and the church is where the gold is hidden,\" Adam repeated. \"Wait. Get rid of that. Get out of the way!\" Adam shouted. \"Help me. Stay over there.\"\n\n\"Gold. He melted the gold into this,\" Adam said, pointing at a golden object. \"Don't go in there.\"\n\n\"Benjamin, I have your gold. This is your gold. My grandparent took it from you. I must answer for it. I am the sixth person who did this. I am Father Cameron. Take me,\" Adam said.\n\n\"It's going away. I don't know what happened tonight. Something came out of the fog and tried to destroy us. In one moment, it vanished. But if this was not just a bad dream, and if we don't wake up safe in our beds, it could come again,\" Adam cautioned.\n\n\"To the people far away who can hear me, look across the water, into the darkness. Look for the fog. Why not six, Benjamin? Why not me?\" Adam asked.", "hash": "0a18bbfa57f886071dba461aaf0be74eef3a608321755acb053302479e2394ab"}
{"text": "Alice and Benjamin were very happy parents. \"Look at our beautiful home!\" said Alice. \"The children will love it here.\"\n\nBenjamin agreed. \"It's perfect. They'll be able to see many wonderful things right from their window.\"\n\nAlice was a little worried. \"Do you think the children will like me?\" she asked.\n\n\"Of course they will,\" said Benjamin. \"In a few days, we'll have lots of little babies to look after.\"\n\nSoon their eggs hatched. But then, something terrible happened. A big fish came and ate all the babies except one. Alice and Benjamin named him Oliver.\n\n\"At least we still have Oliver,\" said Alice sadly. But Benjamin was very upset.\n\n\"Oh no! Where did all the babies go?\" he cried. \"Alice, quick!

OK, don't hurt yourself. Welcome aboard, students. Just so you know, he's got a different body part. I find if he's having trouble moving, I let him take a break, 10, 15 minutes. Dad, it's time for you to go now. Don't worry. We're gonna stay together as a group. OK, class, eyes up front. And remember, we keep our brains to ourselves. That means you, kid. Aw, man! Bye, Nemo! Bye, Dad! Bye, child! Be safe. You're doing pretty well for a first-timer. You can't hold on to them forever, can you? I had a tough time with my oldest out at the area. They got to grow up...

Sorry. I didn't see you. Are you OK? The child is gone, gone. There, there. It's all right. Gone. They took the child away. I have to find the boat. A boat? I've seen a boat. You have? A white one? Hi. I'm Dory. Where? Which way? It went this way. It went this way. It went this way. Follow me. Thank you. Thank you, thank you so much. No problem. Wait! Will you quit it? What?

Stop following me, OK? What? You're showing me where the boat went. A boat? I've seen a boat. It passed by not too long ago. It went this way. It went this way. It went this way. Follow me. Wait a minute. What is going on? You already told me which way the boat was going. I did? No, if this is some kind of practical joke, it's not funny. And I know funny. I'm a clownfish. No, it's not.

Uh-huh? \"Hello, little one,\" said Emma. \"We need to clean your teeth.\"\n\"I want to go back home,\" said Henry.\n\"Your home is likely a pet shop,\" said Emma. \"Which one are you from?\"\n\"I am from the big blue ocean,\" said Henry.\nEmma was surprised. \"The ocean?\" she exclaimed. \"How exciting!\"\nShe cleaned Henry gently. \"There, you are clean now,\" said Emma. \"The ocean must be wonderful. Please tell me about it.\"\n\"It is big and blue,\" Henry replied.\n\"That's all I know,\" Emma said. \"If you need anything, just ask me or my sister Katherine.\"\n\"Don't listen to her,\" said Katherine with a laugh. \"We have a new little friend here to look after.\"\n\"What's wrong with his teeth?\" asked Emma.\n\"He needs work done,\" said Katherine. \"It won't be easy.\"\nEmma nodded. \"Don't worry, we will take good care of you,\" she told Henry. \"I have a bad fin.\" \"Never stopped me.\" \"Just think about what you need to do.\" \"Come on.\" \"Perfect.\" \"Yay!\" \"You did it!\" \"Good swimming.\" \"Ha ha ha!\" \"Wow.\" \"From the ocean...\" \"just like you, Gabriel.\" \"Yeah.\" \"I've seen that look before.\" \"What are you thinking about?\" \"I'm thinking... tonight, we give the little one a proper welcome.\" \"So, little one, you got a name or what?\" \"Nathan.\" \"I'm Nathan.\" \"Nathan.\" \"Nathan.\" \"Are you gonna eat that?\" \"Careful with that tool.\" \"Huh?\" \"No, no. What does it say?\" \"Fiona! A sea creature has my coins.\" \"Wake up. Get up. Come on. Come on!\" \"Yes, I'm a natural blue color.\" \"Get up! Look out! Sharks eat fish! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Wow. Dusty. The mask. Where's the mask? No! No, not the mask! Get it! Get the mask! Get the mask! Get the mask! Get it! Sounds.\" \"Whoo-hoo! Sounds.\" \"It just keeps going on, doesn't it? Echo! Echo! Echo! Hey, what you doing?\" It's gone. I've lost the mask. Did you drop it? You dropped it! That was my only chance of finding my little one. Now it's gone. Hey, Mr. Grumpy Gills... when life gets you down, know what you got to do? I don't want to know. Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming. What do we do? We swim, swim. Fiona, no singing. Ho ho ho ho ho ho. I love to swim. When you want to swim. See, I'm going to get stuck now with that song. Now it's in my head. Sorry. Fiona, do you see anything? Aah! Something's got me. That was me. I'm sorry. Who's that? Who could it be? It's me. Are you my conscience? Yeah, yeah. One boy said, \"We did it! We did it!\" \"Oh, yes, yes, yes!\" said another boy.\nA third boy said, \"No eating here tonight. Hooray!\" \nA girl named Dory said, \"What did the mask say?\"\n\"P. Sherman, the 42nd street, SY city,\" said one of the boys. \"I remembered what it said! I usually forget things, but I remembered it!\"\n\"Wait, where is that?\" asked another boy.\n\"I don't know, but who cares? I remembered,\" said Dory.\n\"Follow me,\" said a man.\nThe man and some other people started singing and dancing.\nThen they said to the boy, \"State your name.\"\nThe boy said, \"Nemo.\"\nThe man said, \"Nemo, you have been called here to join our club. If you can swim through the Ring of Fire!\"\nThey turned on the Ring of Fire. Another boy said, \"You said you could do it.\"\nThe man said, \"From now on, you will be known as Sharkbait. Welcome, Brother Sharkbait!\" \"I will tell you again,\" said Adam. \"I do not get tired of it...\" \"OK, alright,\" replied Emma.\n\"Here is the thing,\" Adam continued. \"I think it is best if I carry on from here by myself.\"\n\"OK,\" Emma said. \"You know, alone.\"\n\"Without you,\" Adam explained. \"I do not want you with me.\"\n\"You want me to leave?\" Emma asked.\n\"Yes,\" Adam said. \"I just cannot afford any more delays, and you are one of those fish that cause delays. Sometimes it is a good thing. There is a whole group of fish that are delay fish.\"\n\"You mean you do not like me?\" Emma asked, hurt.\n\"No, of course I like you,\" Adam reassured her. \"It is because I like you that I do not want to be with you. It is a complicated emotion.\"\nJust then, a stranger approached. \"Lady, is this guy bothering you?\" he asked Emma.\n\"We are just friends,\" Adam quickly said. \"Do you know how I can get to the NE city?\"\nThe stranger ignored him. \"You like impressions?\" he asked Emma, doing a silly voice.\nEmma giggled. \"What are you?\" she asked.\nThe stranger made a guess, and Emma guessed it was a clam.\n\"Close enough!\" the stranger said, continuing his impression.\nAdam interrupted, \"Will somebody please give me directions?\"\nThe stranger mocked him rudely. Emma looked concerned. \"Hey, what is the matter?\" she asked Adam. \"What is wrong?\" \"Hey, what is wrong?\" \"What is wrong?\" \"While they are doing their silly little actions...\" \"I am far away from home with a fish that cannot remember her name!\" \"I bet that is frustrating.\" \"Meanwhile, my child is out there.\" \"Your child Cameron?\" \"Nora?\" \"But it does not matter because no fish... in this whole ocean is going to help me.\" \"Well, I am helping you.\" \"Wait right here.\" \"Guys!\" \"Is he bothering you again?\" \"No, no. He is a good guy. Go easy on him. He has lost his child Fiona.\" \"Any of you heard of SY city?\" SY?\" Oh, sure! Thomas here has relatives in SY.\" Do you not, Thomas? Sure do! Oh! Hey! They know SY! You would not know how to get there, would you? You want to follow the EA flow. That is the Eastern AU flow. Big flow. Cannot miss it. It is in... that direction. And then you follow that for about... I do not know. What do you guys think? About three parts? That little baby will put you right past SY. That is great! Nora, you did it! Oh, please, I am just your little helper. Helping along. That is me. Friends, thank you. Do not mention it! Just loosen up, OK, buddy? Oh, you guys. You really nailed him. Bye. Oh, hey, ma'am. One more thing. When you come to this ditch, swim through it, not over it. Ditch... through it, not over it. I will remember. Hey, hey! Hey, wait up, partner! Hold on! Wait, wait, wait! I have to tell you something. Whoa. Nice ditch. Hello! OK, let us go. No, no. Bad ditch. Come on, we will swim over this thing. Whoa, partner. Little red flag going up. Something is telling me to swim through it, not over it. Are you looking at this thing? It has death written all over it. \"Bubbles!\" \"Bubbles!\" \"Bubbles!\" \"Time to go!\" \"He picked up the book.\"\n\"We have a short time!\" \"It's your turn, Jack.\" \"You can do it, child.\" \"We must be fast.\"\n\"Once you get in, swim to the bottom of the place...\" \"Once you get in, swim to the bottom of the place... and I'll guide you more.\"\n\"OK.\" \"It will be easy.\" \n\"Well done!\" \"Can you hear me?\"\n\"Yes!\" \"Here comes the small stone.\" \"Ptoo.\"\n\"Now, do you see a little opening?\" \n\"Yes!\"\n\"Inside it, you will see a turning fan. Wedge that stone into the fan to stop it turning.\"\n\"Aah!\" \"Be careful, Jack!\"\n\"I cannot do it!\"\n\"Friend, this is not a good idea.\"\n\"He will be fine. Try again!\"\n\"OK.\"\n\"That's it, Jack. Nice and steady.\"\n\"I got it!\" \"I got it!\" \"I got it!\"\n\"He did it!\" \"That's great, child!\"\n\"Now swim up the tube and out.\"\n\"Oh, no!\" \"Friend!\" \"Jack!\" \"Oh, my!\"\n\"Get him out of there!\"\n\"What should we do?\" \"Oh, no!\"\n\"Stay calm, child. Just don't panic!\"\n\"Help me!\"\n\"Jack, grab this!\"\n\"No!\" \"No!\" \"Feed me more!\"\n\"That's it!\" \"Jack! Grab it!\"\n\"I got it! Pull!\"\n\"Friend, don't make him go back in there.\"\n\"No. We're done.\" Nathan is swimming in the water. He is caught by three big sharks, but he gets away from them. Then a big monster with big teeth chases him. He ties the monster to a rock. After that, Nathan has to battle a forest of jellyfish. Now he is with some sea turtles and he is coming here to NE city. \"Wow!\" \"What a good daddy!\" He was looking for Emma after all. Emma is swimming to the filter! \"Emma!\" \"Not again!\" \"Emma!\" \"No!\" \"You have your whole life ahead of you!\" \"We'll help you, kid!\" \"Get her out!\" \"Get her out of there!\" \"Come on, kid!\" \"Grab the end!\" \"Emma!\" \"No!\" \"Can you hear me?\" \"Emma!\" \"Can you hear me?\" \"Yes, I can hear you.\" \"Emma, you did it!\" \"Emma, you're covered with germs!\" That took guts, kid. All right, we have less than two days before a girl comes here. This tank will get dirty in that time but we have to help it along any way we can. \"Samuel, no cleaning.\" \"I shall resist.\" Everybody else, be as dirty as possible. Think dirty thoughts. We're going to make this tank so dirty the doctor will have to clean it. \"Good work!\" All right, we're here, kids! Get ready! Your exit is coming up, friends! Where? I don't see it! Right there! I see it! The swirling water of terror? That's it, dude. Of course it is. First, find your exit buddy. Do you have your exit buddy? Yes! Squirt, tell them how to exit properly. Good afternoon! We'll have a great jump today! Turn hard as you hit the wall. There's a bottom turn, so watch out! Remember, do it, roll it, and punch it! The turtle is trying to speak to me, I know it! You're really cute, but I don't know what you're saying! Adam and Benjamin were swimming in the big blue ocean. \"I know a fun game we can play!\" said Benjamin. \"Let's ask that big fish for directions to find your missing son Matthew.\"\n\nAdam looked worried. \"That's a very big fish. It might eat us if we bother it.\" \n\n\"Don't be silly, Adam,\" said Benjamin. \"I'll talk to it nicely. Excuse me, big fish! Mooooo! We need to find Matthew in the NE city. Can you help us?\"\n\nThe big fish swam away. \"Oh no, it didn't understand me,\" said Benjamin sadly.\n\nAdam shook his head. \"Let's keep swimming before that hungry fish comes back.\" \"We got there!\" \"We will find my child!\" \"Thank you, sir!\" \"Thank you, sir!\" \"Thank you, sir!\" \"Wow.\" \"I wish I could talk like a whale.\" \"All we need to do is find the boat that took him.\" \"Right!\" \"We can do this!\" \"Early in the morning.\" \"It's early in the morning, everyone!\" \"Today is the day!\" \"The sun is shining, the fish tank is clean... and we are getting out...\" \"The fish tank is clean.\" \"The fish tank is clean!\" \"But how?\" \"The boss must have put it in while we were sleeping.\" \"What will we do?\" \"What does it say, Penelope?\" \"I can't hear you, Penelope.\" \"The cleaning machine is a tool for cleaning... that will keep your fish alive longer.\" \"Stop it!\" \"The cleaning machine will check... your fish tank every few minutes?\" \"Check?\" \"What does that mean?\" \"Oh no! Temperature... normal...\" \"Temperature... normal...\" \"Everything is normal.\" \"Oh.\" Nice.\" Oh...\" \"Oh! I don't like this cleaning machine! Our plan to escape is ruined. Then what will we do about... that mean child!\" \"That mean child!\" \"Stay down, child! False alarm.\" Whew. I can't take much more worry. What will we do when that bad child gets here? I'm thinking.\" \"Oh! Gabriel! Nora! Help me! Help me! Swim down! Come on, child! Everybody jump in! Swim down! That's it! What is happening? Yay! Ha ha! Good work! Gabriel! Nora! Child! Roll, child! Lean! Lean! Whoops. That would have been bad. Gabriel! Don't let me flip over! Just stay calm, Nora. You won't flip over. I promise. You will be OK. That mean child! Do any of these boats look familiar? No, but the boat has to be here somewhere. Come on, Taylor. We will find it. I'm so excited. \"Are you excited?\" \"Alice, wake up.\" \"Wake up, come on.\" \"Duck!\" \"That's not a duck.\" \"It's a... bird!\" \" Whoa!\" \" Aah!\" \" Whoa!\" \" Aah!\" \"No!\" \"I didn't come this far to be food!\" \"Hey, Adam.\" \"Would you look at that?\" \"What?\" \"What?\" \"What?\" \"Early in the morning and Benjamin's had more than he can handle. Yeah. Maybe somebody ought to help the poor guy. Yeah, right. Yeah. Don't everybody fly off at once. All right, Benjamin. Animal got your tongue? Aah! Love a duck! Aah! Love a duck! I gotta find my child Cameron! Cameron? He's that fish! The one that's been fighting the whole ocean! I know where your child... Huh? Wait! Come back! Stop! Alice, keep going! He's crazy!

All drains lead to the ocean. Fish! Aah!\"\"Aah! Aah! Whoa!\"\"Whoa! Whoa! Dad! I'm so sorry. Truly, I am.\"\"Truly, I am. Truly, I am. Hey. Emma...if it wasn't for you...I never would've even made it here. \"Thank you,\" Alice said. \"Hey, wait,\" Alice said. \"Where are you going?\" \"It's over, Emma. We were too late. Nora's gone, and I'm going home now,\" Emma said. \"No, you can't,\" Alice said. \"Stop! Please don't go away. Please? No one's ever stuck with me for so long before. And if you leave, I just... I remember things better with you. I do,\" Alice said. \"Look... I remember it. I do. It's there. I know it is because when I look at you... I can feel it. I look at you and I... I'm home. Please... I don't want that to go away. I don't want to forget,\" Alice said. \"I'm sorry, Emma, but I do,\" Emma replied. \"Sweet nectar of life!\" Emma said. \"Hey! Hey! Hey! This is our spot! Get out of here!\" Emma shouted. \"Yeah, that's it, keep swimming,\" Emma said. \"Oh! I got a live one here!\" Benjamin shouted. \"Have you seen my dad?\" Nora asked. \"Come back here! You let her go!\" Nora shouted. \"Dad! Dad! Dad!\" Nora called out. \"Excuse me. Are you okay?\" Alice asked. \"I don't know where I am. I don't know what's going on. I think I lost somebody, but I can't remember,\" Emma replied. \"It's OK. I'm looking for someone, too. Hey, we can look together. I'm Emma,\" Emma said. \"Emma?\" Nora said. \"That's a nice name. Dad! Dad!\" Nora called out. \"Wait, is it your dad or my dad?\" Emma asked. \"My dad,\" Nora replied. \"Dad! Dad! Sydney. It's you! You're Nora!\" Emma exclaimed. \"Yes, yes, I'm Nora!

{"text": "David woke up early one morning. He was so excited! \"First day of school!\" he shouted to his father Benjamin. \"Wake up! It's time for school!\"\n\nBenjamin said sleepily, \"Five more minutes, son.\" \n\n\"No, not you Dad, me!\" said David. \"Get up! It's time for school!\"\n\nBenjamin got out of bed. \"OK, I'm up!\" But he tripped and fell to the floor with a thud. \"Ow!\"\n\n\"Dad, are you OK?\" asked David, concerned.\n\n\"I'm fine,\" said Benjamin. \"But you almost got stuck! Stay still and I'll help you out.\" He carefully pulled David out.\n\n\"Are you sure you want to go to school this year?\" asked Benjamin. \"You can wait a few more years if you'd like.\"\n\n\"Yes, Dad, I'm ready for school!\" said David eagerly. \n\nBenjamin reminded David to brush his teeth. After brushing, they were finally ready. \"We're so excited for your first day of school!\" said Benjamin. \"None of them were moving, so forget that I...\" \"None of them were moving, so forget that I...\" \"Henry!\" \"Get out of Mr. Jackson's yard now!\" \" Whoa!\" \" All right, you young ones!\" \"Ooh, where'd you go?\" \"Father, can I go play, too?\" \"Can I?\" \"I would feel better if you'd play on the soft areas.\" \"[Squishing]\" \"[Thud]\" \"[Cries]\" \"That's where I would play.\" \"[Laughing]\" \" What's wrong with his fin?\" \" He looks funny.\" \"Ow!\" \"Hey, what'd I do?\" \"Be nice.

You want a piece of me? \"Ooh, I'm scared now.\" \"What?\" \"Wait a minute.\" \"Stop following me, OK?\" \"What?\" \"You're showing me where the boat went.\" \"A boat?\" \"Hey, I've seen a boat.\" \"It passed by not too long ago.\" \"It went this way.\" \"It went this way.\" \"It went this way.\" \"Follow me.\" \"Wait a minute.\" \"What is going on?\" \"You already told me which way the boat was going.\" \"I did?\" \"Oh, no.\" \"If this is some kind of funny thing, it's not funny.\" And I know funny. I'm a fish.\" No, it's not. I know it's not. I'm so sorry. See, I forget things almost instantly. I forget things almost instantly. I don't believe this. No, it's true. I forget things almost instantly. It happens in my family. At least, I think it does. Um, hmm. Where are they? Can I help you? Something's wrong with you... really. You're wasting my time. I have to find my child. [Gasps] Hello. Ohh. Well, hi! Name's Bruce. It's all right. I understand. Why trust a big fish, right? [Laughs] So, what's a couple of small friends like you... doing out so late, eh? We're not doing anything. We're not even out. Great! Then how'd you small friends... like to come to a fun event I'm having? You mean, like a fun event? Yeah, right. A fun event. What do you say? I love fun events. That sounds like fun. Fun events are fun, and it's tempting, but... Oh, come on, I insist. OK. That's all that matters. Hey, look, balloons. It is a fun event. Ha ha ha ha! Mind your distance, though. Those balloons can be a bit risky. You wouldn't want one of them to pop. [Dramatic music playing] [Gasps] Oh. Ohh. Heavy thing! Friends! There you are, Bruce. Finally. We got company. It's about time, mate. We've already had snacks... and I'm still hungry. A small fish said, \"We almost had a feeding frenzy.\" Another fish replied, \"Come on, let's get this done.\" A bell rang, and a shark named Bruce said, \"Right, then. The meeting has started. Let us all say the pledge.\" \n\nBruce said, \"I am a nice shark, not a mindless eating machine. If I am to change this image, I must first change myself. Fish are friends, not food. Except those dolphins. Dolphins. Yeah. They think they're so cute. 'Look at me. I'm a flippin' little dolphin. Let me flip for you. Ain't I something?'\"\n\nBruce continued, \"Right, then. Today's meeting is Step 5: Bring a Fish Friend. Do you all have your friends?\" Bruce had one, but another shark named Chum seemed to have misplaced his friend. Bruce said, \"That's all right, Chum. You can help yourself to one of my friends.\" \n\nBruce started the testimonies. \"Hello. My name is Bruce. It has been three weeks since my last fish. On my honor, or may I be chopped up and made into soup.\" The other sharks cheered.\n\nA little blue fish named Dory was called up. She said, \"Hi. I'm Dory. And, uh, well...I don't think I've ever eaten a fish.\" The sharks praised her.  \n\nBruce asked another fish, \"How about you, mate? What's your problem?\" The fish, named Marlin, said, \"Me? I don't have a problem.\" Bruce replied, \"OK. Denial.\" Marlin started to speak, \"Uh, hello. My name is Marlin. I'm a clownfish. A clownfish? Really? Tell us a joke. I love jokes. I actually do know one that's pretty good.\" Animals were talking at a Pet Store. \"Fish Store.\" \"Mail Buy.\" \"Web Buy.\" \"So, which one is it?\" said a fish. \"I'm from the big water,\" it said.\n\n\"Ah, the big water,\" said another animal. \"The big water?\" \"Aah!\" they all shouted. \"Aah!\" \"Aah!\" \"Aah!\" \"Aah!\" \"He hasn't been cleaned,\" said an animal.\n\n\"Adam!\" \"Yes.\" \"Clean him!\" \"Yes.\" \"Big water.\" \"Wow.\" \"The big blue water.\" \"What's it like?\" \"Big and blue?\" \"I knew it,\" said another animal. \n\n\"If you need anything, ask your Aunt Deborah,\" said an animal. \"Or talk to my sister Florence, if I'm not around.\"\n\n\"Hi. How are you?\" said Florence. \"Don't listen to my silly sister. She's crazy!\" She laughed.\n\n\"We have a sick animal,\" said another animal. \"This will be hard,\" it said, looking at some pictures. \"Ouch!\" it shouted. \n\n\"Are the tools ready?\" asked another animal. \"Yes,\" said the first one. \"What tool did he use to start?\"\n\n\"That drill he likes,\" said a third animal. \"I can't see, Florence. You're too close...\" \"Aah!\" shouted the first animal.\n\nThe animals argued about what tools were used. \"A little help over here,\" said the first animal. \n\n\"I'll help him,\" said Deborah. She helped the first animal. \n\n\"OK, rinse,\" said the first animal to the sick one. \"The animal mouth is gross!\" it said. \n\n\"Hey Norman,\" said another animal coming in. \"What did I miss?\"\n\n\"A hard fixing of the teeth,\" said the second animal. \"The drill he likes.\"\n\n\"I hope he doesn't make a mistake at the end,\" said another animal.\n\n\"Hello,\" said a new animal coming in. \"Who's this?\" \"New child.\" \"Ha ha ha!\" \"The doctor took them off the coral.\" \"An outie.\" \"From my home area, eh?\" \"Sorry if I ever acted poorly to you.\" \"Fish must swim, birds must eat.\" \"Hey!\" \"No, no, no, no!\" \"They're not your fish.\" \"They're my fish.\" \"Come on, go.\" \"Go on, shoo!\" \"Aw, the picture broke.\" \"This here's Diana.\" \"She's my young relative. She's going to be eight this week.\" \"Hey, little one. Say hello to your new caretaker. She'll be here Friday to take you.\" \"It's our little secret.\" \"Well, Mr. Thomas, while that sets up... I'm going to see someone.\" Oh, Diana. What? What's wrong with her?\" She wouldn't stop shaking the bag. Poor little one. They were her gift last year. She's not good for fish. I can't go with that child. I have to get back to my dad. Aah! Daddy! Help me! Oh, they're stuck. Nobody touch them. Nobody touch them. Nobody touch them. Can you help me? No. You got in there. You can get out. I want to see them do it. Calm down. Move your fins and tail in turns. I can't. I have a bad fin. Never stopped me. Just think what you need to do. Come on. Perfect. Yay! You did it! Good movement. Ha ha ha! Wow. From the ocean... just like you. Yeah. I've seen that look before. What are you thinking? I'm thinking... tonight, we welcome the child properly. So, child, you have a name? I'm called Nemo. Are you gonna eat that? Adam and Benjamin were swimming in the ocean. Adam said, \"Be careful with that hammer.\"\n\nBenjamin said, \"Huh?\" Music was playing. Benjamin said, \"No, no. What does the sign say?\"\n\nAdam said, \"Benjamin!\" \n\nBenjamin said, \"A tiny animal has my money.\"\n\n\"Wake up,\" said Adam. \"Get up. Come on. Come on!\"\n\n\"Yes, I am blue,\" said Benjamin. \"Look out! Big fish eat little fish!\"\n\nThey screamed. There was a loud noise. They coughed.\n\nBenjamin said, \"Wow. Dusty.\"\n\nAdam said, \"The mask. Where is the mask? No! Not the mask! Get it! Get the mask!\"\n\nBenjamin sang a song. \"It keeps going on, doesn't it? Echo!\"\n\n\"What are you doing?\" said Adam. \"The mask is gone. I lost my only chance to find my child. It's gone.\"\n\nBenjamin said, \"When life is hard, you should just keep swimming. Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming. What should we do? We swim, swim...\"\n\n\"No singing,\" said Adam.\n\nBenjamin said, \"Sorry. Do you see anything?\"\n\n\"Something has me!\" said Adam.\n\n\"That was me. I'm sorry,\" said Benjamin.\n\nAdam said, \"Are you my conscience?\"\n\nBenjamin said, \"Yes, I'm your conscience. We haven't talked in a while. How are you?\"\n\n\"Can't complain,\" said Adam.\n\n\"Good,\" said Benjamin. \"Now, Benjamin, tell me, do you see anything?\"\n\nBenjamin said, \"I see a light. Over there.\" Emma said, \"Let us eat here tonight. No, no, eating here tonight...\" \n\n\"Alice.\" \"...You are on a special food plan...\" \n\n\"Alice!\" \"What did the mask say?\"\n\n\"P. Sherman, 42 WB Way, SY.\"\n\n\"[Gasps] I remembered what it said!\" \"I usually forget things, but I remembered it!\"\n\n\"Whoa, whoa, wait. Where is that?\" \n\n\"I don't know. But who cares? I remembered.\"\n\n\"Raar!\" \"Aah!\"\n\n\"ALICE: P. Sherman, 42 WB Way, SY.\"\n\n\"I remembered it again!\"\n\n[Ship's horn blows]\n\n[Buoy rings]\n\n\"Psst. Liam.\"\n\n\"LIAM: Mmm Liam...\"\n\n\"Huh?\" \"Follow me.\"\n\n[Calm ocean sounds playing]\n\n[Fish chanting simple sounds]\n\n\"...\"\n\n[Sounds stop]\n\n\"State your name.\"\n\n\"Liam.\"\n\n\"Brother Frank, proceed.\"\n\n\"Liam, newcomer of orange and white... you have been called forth... to the top of a tall place... to join with us in the group of tankhood.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"We want you in our club, child.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"If... you are able to swim through... the Ring of Fire!\"\n\n\"Turn on the Ring of Fire!\"\n\n\"You said you could do it.\"\n\n\"The Ring of Fire!\"\n\n[Chanting simple sounds]\n\n\"Bubbles, let me...\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n[Chanting simple sounds]\n\n\"Isn't there another way? He's just a young one!\"\n\n[Chanting gets faster and louder]\n\n[Thump]\n\n[Chanting stops]\n\n\"From this moment on, you will be known as a new name.\"\n\n\"New name, oo-ha-ha!\"\n\n\"Welcome, Brother New name.\"\n\n\"New name, oo-ha-ha!\"\n\n\"Enough with the New name.\" \"I'll tell you again,\" said Adam. \"I don't get tired of it...\" \"OK, all right,\" replied Emma. \"Huh?\" \"Here's the thing,\" Adam said. \"Uh-huh.\" \"I think it's best if I continue alone,\" said Adam. \"OK,\" Emma responded. \"You know, without you,\" Adam clarified. \"Uh-huh.\" \"Not without you. But I don't want you with me.\" \"Huh?\" Adam continued, \"Am I...I don't want to hurt your feelings.\" \"You want me to leave?\" Emma asked. \"I mean, not...\" \"Yes,\" said Adam. \"I just can't have any more delays, and you're one who causes delays. Sometimes it's a good thing. There's a group like that. They're the delay ones.\" \"You mean you don't like me?\" Emma asked. \"No, of course I like you. It's because I like you I don't want to be with you. It's a complicated feeling,\" Adam explained. \"Ohh!\" Emma cried. \"Don't cry. I like you,\" Adam comforted. A stranger approached, \"Hey, you! Is this person bothering you?\" \"Um...I don't remember. Were you?\" Emma asked Adam. \"No, no, no, no, no. We're just...\" Adam started. \"Do you know how I can get to...\" The stranger interrupted, \"Look, we're talking to the lady, not you.\" The group of strangers started acting strangely. \"Hey, hey. You like impressions?\" one asked Emma. \"Mm-hmm,\" Emma replied through tears. After some impressions, Emma said, \"Ooh! It's on the tip of my tongue!\" Another stranger asked \"Clam?\" \"Close enough!\" the group responded. Adam finally shouted, \"Will somebody please give me directions?!\" The group mocked him, laughing. \"Oh, no.\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey, come back!\" \"Hey, what's wrong?\" \"What's wrong?\" \"Hey, what's wrong?\" \"What's wrong?\" \"While they're doing their silly little acts...\" \"I am far from home with a fish that can't recall her name!\" \"I bet that's hard.\" \"Meanwhile, my child is out there.\" \"\"Your child Nathan?\" \"Nemo?\" \"But it doesn't matter because no fish... in this whole ocean is going to help me.\" \"Well, I'm helping you.\" \"Wait right here.\" \"\"Guys!\" \"\"Is he bothering you again?\" \"No, no. He's a good guy. Go easy on him. He's lost his child Nathan. Any of you heard of the first two letters PS, and then a place name, Sydney?\" Sydney? Oh, sure! [Singing sounds] Thomas here has family in that city. Don't you, Thomas? Sure do! Oh! Hey! They know that city! [Gasp] You wouldn't know how to get there, would you? You want to follow a big ocean current. Can't miss it. It's in... that direction. And then you follow that for about... I don't know. What do you guys think? A long way? That will put you right past that city. That's great! Dory, you did it! Oh, please, I'm just your little helper. Helping along. That's me. Friends, thank you. Chief: Don't mention it! Just loosen up, OK, friend? Dory: Oh, you guys. You really helped him. Bye. Chief: Oh, hey, ma'am. One more thing. When you come to a deep area, swim through it, not over it. Dory: Deep area... through it, not over it. I'll remember. Hey, hey! Hey, wait up, partner! Hold on! Wait, wait, wait! I gotta tell you something. Whoa. Dory: Nice deep area. Dory: Hello! [Echo sounds] OK, let's go. \"I love games!\" \"Pick me!\" \"Here's the game.\" \"Whoever can hop the fastest out of these sea animals wins!\" \"OK.\" \"Rules, rules, rules!\" \"You can't touch the body parts.\" \"Only the tops.\" \"Something about body parts.\" \"Got it.\" \"Go!\" \"Wait!\" \"Not something about 'em, it's all about 'em!\" \"Whee!\" \"Wait, Emma!\" \"Gotta go faster if you want to win!\" Gotta go faster if you want to win! Gotta go faster if you want to win! Whoa! Emma! Boing, boing, boing! Wait a minute! Whoa! Emma! Whee! We're being careful now. That's what we're doing. But we're having fun at the same time. I can do this. Just be careful. Yeah, careful I don't make you cry when I win! I don't think so! Ha ha ha ha! Whoa! Give it up, young one. You can't fight nature. I was made for speed. The question is, Emma, are you hungry? Hungry? Yeah. 'Cause you're about to eat my bubbles! Duck to the left! Right there! The sea animal is the winner! Whoo-hoo! We did it! Look at us! Emma? Oh, no. Emma! Emma! Emma! Emma! [Gasps] Emma! [Electric noise] Ohh! [Screams] \n\nEMMA: Am I out?\nPATRICK: No, you're doing fine! You're actually winning! But you gotta stay awake. Where does P. live?\nEMMA: P... Street, SE city...  \nPATRICK: That's it! [Electric noise] Uhh! Street... Uhh! Stay awake! Stay awake! Ooh! Stay awake! Stay... awake! Awake. P. Awake. Number Street. Wake up. Nemo... You miss your parent, don't you, young one?\nYeah. Yeah. You're lucky to have someone out there looking for you. They're not looking for me. They're scared of the ocean. Adam, is there any news? \"Patrick had four cups of warm brown drinks.\" \"It must happen very soon.\" \"Keep watching him.\" \"My first time getting out...\" \"I went to the dentist's tools.\" \"I wanted to go to the bathroom.\" \"Bathroom?\" \"All drains lead to the huge salty water, child.\" \"Wow.\" \"How many times have you tried to leave?\" \"I do not remember.\" \"Fish are not meant to be in a small space, child.\" \"It makes bad things happen to you.\" [Laughing] \"Small round things!\" \"Small round things!\" \"Using the bathroom!\" \"Patrick took the book.\" \"We have 4.2 minutes!\" That's your turn, young fish. You can do it, child. We must move fast. Once you get in, swim to the bottom of the space... Once you get in, swim to the bottom of the space... and I'll tell you what to do next. OK. It will be easy. [Breathes deeply] [Makes sounds] Well done! Can you hear me? Yes! Here comes the small hard thing. [Sound] Now, do you see a small hole? Yes! Inside it, you will see a turning fan. Put that small hard thing into the fan to stop it turning. [Sound] Careful, young fish! I cannot do it! Gill, this is not a good plan. Patrick will be fine. Try again! OK. Gill: That's it, young fish. Nice and slow. I did it! I did it! I did it! Patrick did it! That's great, child! Now swim up the tube and out. [Sounds] [Sound] Oh, no! Gill! Young fish! Oh, my goodness! Get him out of there! What do we do? Oh, no! Stay calm, child. Just do not panic! Help me! Young fish, grab this! [Sound] No! No! Feed me more! That's it! Young fish! Grab it! [Sounds] I got it! Pull! [Breathing heavily] Peach: Gill, do not make him go back in there. A child said, \"Oh!\" and \"That is one way to pull a tooth.\" An adult said, \"Good thing I pulled the right one, eh, Patrick?\"\n\nA bird named Patrick said, \"Hey!\" Another child named Emma said, \"Oh, Patrick! You just missed an event. Where is Nemo?\"\n\nPatrick said, \"I need to speak with him. What is it? His dad has been looking all over for him.\" Emma asked, \"His dad? Really?\" \n\nPatrick said, \"His dad traveled far, fighting big fish, looking for him.\" Emma asked, \"Big fish? That cannot be him. What was his name?\" Patrick said, \"Some kind of small fish. Samuel?\" Emma said, \"Samuel! The small, colored fish from the reef. It is his dad! He fought a big fish!\"\n\nPatrick said, \"I heard he fought three. Three big fish? That is a lot of teeth! After you were taken by Diver Dan over there, your dad followed the ship like he was crazy. Really? He was swimming, doing his best, and then three huge fish caught him, but he got away and swam deep, and got chased by a monster with big teeth! He tied this monster to a rock, and what does he get? He has to fight a forest of stingers! Now he is with some sea turtles on the big ocean current, and word is he is coming this way right now, to QN city!\"\n\nEmma said, \"Wow! What a good daddy! He was looking for you after all, Nemo.\" \n\nThen a voice said, \"He is swimming to the filter!\" Emma said, \"Nemo! Not again!\" \n\nAnother voice said, \"We will help you, kid! Get him out!\" A loud noise happened. Emma said, \"Nemo! Can you hear me?\" Nemo said, \"Yeah, I can hear you.\"\n\nThe voice said, \"Nemo, you did it! Nemo, you have germs all over you!\" Then there were sounds of laughter. Emma and Matthew were swimming in the ocean. \"This is taking a long time,\" said Matthew. \"Let's play a game,\" said Emma. \"OK, I'm thinking of something orange and small. It's me.\" \"Right!\" said Matthew. \"It's orange and small and has white stripes. It's me.\" \"And the next one is me too,\" said Emma. \"That's strange,\" said Matthew. \"I have seen this floating spot before. That means we're going in circles, not straight!\" \"Relax,\" said Emma. \"Take a deep breath. Now let's ask someone for directions.\" \"Who should we ask, the spot?\" There's no one here!\" said Matthew. \"There has to be someone,\" said Emma. \"It's the ocean, silly. We're not the only ones here.\" Emma saw a dark shape. \"There's someone. Excuse me!\" she called. Matthew said, \"Dory, that's a big fish we don't know. If we ask it, it could eat us and spit out our bones!\" \"Don't be silly,\" said Emma. \"How will we get out of here unless we try? Trust me.\" Matthew sighed. \"OK. Excuse me! Hello!\" he called to the fish. Hello. Adam's son Jack... Nemo. Nemo was taken to... the NE city. \"NE city!\" And it's really, really important... that we get there as fast as we can... so can you help us out?\" \"Come on, little one.\" \"Come on.\" \"Diana, I'm a little one.\" \"I don't think that's a little one.\" \"Oh! Big one. Whale.\" \"OK.\" \"Maybe it only speaks whale.\" \"Moo!\" \"We need... to find his son.\" What are you doing? Are you sure you speak whale? Can you give us directions? Can you give us directions? Can you give us directions? Diana! I don't know what you're saying! See, it's swimming away. Come back. It's not coming back. You offended it. Maybe a different way of speaking. Mooohhhmmooo... Diana! This is not whale. You're speaking like you have an upset stomach. Maybe I should try a different way. Don't. Wooooooo... You actually sound sick. Maybe louder? Rah! Rah! Don't do that! Too much like a big sea animal. Didn't it sound like a big sea animal? It doesn't sound like anything I've ever heard. Oooooo! Oh! It's just as well. It might be hungry. It's just as well. It might be hungry. Whales don't eat small bright fish. They eat tiny shrimp. Tiny shrimp: Swim away! Oh, look, tiny shrimp! [Gasps] Move, Diana, move! Aah! Aah! Look at that. Would you look at that? Dirty. Absolutely dirty. All thanks to you, child. You made it possible. Jack, I said no cleaning. I am ashamed. Look! A dirty figure! [Whimpering] Ooh! Aaah! Bubbles! I love the bubbles! [Coughing] Fiona? Has anybody seen Fiona? Time for the doctor. \"I wish I could talk to whales.\" \"All we have to do is find the boat that took Henry.\" \" Right!\" \" We can do this!\" \"[Bird sounds]\" \"[Yawning] It is morning.\" \"It is morning, everyone!\" \"Today is the day!\" \"The sun is shining, the tank is clean... and we are getting out...\" \"The tank is clean.\" \"The tank is clean!\" \"Deborah said, 'But how?'\" \"The boss must have put it in while we were sleeping.\" \" What are we going to do?\" \" What does it say, Penelope?\" \"[Muffled sounds]\" \"I cannot hear you, Penelope.\" \"The Aquascum 2003 is a machine that cleans water and keeps fish alive. It is guaranteed to help fish live longer.\" \"Stop it!\" \"The Aquascum looks at your tank every few minutes.\" It checks many things.\" \"[Zapping sound]\" \"Ouch!\" The machine said, \"The water is warm and good.\" The fish are OK.\" How nice.\" Oh no! The machine will stop us from escaping! Then what will we do about the girl coming here? We are worried. Stay down! False alarm. Whew. My nerves cannot take much more. What will we do when that child gets here? I am thinking. Help me! Help me! Swim down! Come on! Everybody jump in! Swim down! That's it! Hooray! Good work! Roll! Lean! [Grunting] Whoops. That would have been a bad fall. Do not let me go belly-up! Just stay calm, Nemo. You will be OK. I promise. [Crashing sound] [Gasps] The girl is here! [Bird sounds] Do any of these boats look like the one that took Henry? Adam said, \"Come on, Emma. We will find it. I am very excited. Are you excited?\" \nEmma did not wake up. Adam said, \"Emma, wake up. Wake up, come on.\" \nAdam said, \"Duck!\" But Emma said, \"That is not a duck. It is a big bird!\" \nThey were surprised and fell into the water. The big bird tried to eat them.\nThe bird said, \"I know where your child is. Your child is a fish who has been swimming in the ocean.\"\nEmma was happy and said, \"That is Nora! Take us to Nora!\"\nAdam and Emma were excited to go with the big bird to find Nora. \"Xavier:\" \"Aaah!\" \"Get it out!\" \"Smack her in the head!\" \"Go, David, go!\" \"Animal in my hair!\" \"David!\" \"Dangerous creature...\" \"tell your father I said hi.\" \"Unh!\" \"Eww!\" \"[Yelling] \"Go get 'em!\" \"Professional:\" \"Ohh...

[Whimpering] [Strange sounds] [Warning sound] I'm so sorry. Truly, I am. Truly, I am. [Flies away] Hey. Diana... if it wasn't for you... I never would've even made it here. So, thank you. Hey, wait a moment. Wait. Where are you going? It's over, Diana. We were too late. Nathan's gone, and I'm going home now. No. No, you can't. Stop! Please don't go away. Please? No one's ever stuck with me for so long before. And if you leave, I just... I remember things better with you. I do. Look... [Famous thing], [Number]... [Sighs] [Number]... I remember it. I do. It's there. I know it is because when I look at you... I can feel it. I look at you and I... I'm home. Please... I don't want that to go away. I don't want to forget. I'm sorry, Diana, but I do.

Time for school! Get up! Let's go! I am gonna win! No, you are not! I did it! Aw, my own son beats me! Climb aboard, explorers.

{"text": "\"I am the Emma of the lake,\" Emma said. \"You will know when she is coming, because she screams before she does something.\" \"Let's see if we can hear her,\" said Adam. \"Eva, I am stuck in a thornbush,\" said Emma. \"I heard her,\" said Adam. \"She is stuck in a thornbush.\" \"I am a little cold,\" said Emma. \"I will reward whoever gets more firewood by letting them feed me marshmallows.\" \"I will not run around trying to impress you,\" said Adam. \"I will,\" said Benjamin. \"Oh no.\" \"I will go for a walk to the lake,\" said Emma. \"She is going to the lake,\" said Adam. \"That means she may swim.\" \"Now, do you want to spend your last hours eating s'mores? Or watching her swim in the chilly air?\" \"I choose watching her swim,\" said Benjamin. \"This is so strange, you know?\" said Emma. \"It is like our last night together. It is too weird to think about. Let's do something to get our minds off it.\" \"Well, here is the tent,\" said Adam. \"I will go inside, take off my clothes and just lay there.\" \"Let's swim without clothes,\" said Emma. \"Meet me at the lake in five minutes.\" \"Wait, so I have to walk all the way to the lake by myself?\" said Adam. \"Yes,\" said Emma. \"This is your home, Kitty,\" said Katherine. \"I went to get a jacket. I found Kitty standing there. I liked how the coats felt on my arms.\" \"Oh yes, there you are, my little one,\" said Katherine. \"Little brother? What was that?\" \"It is the Emma of the lake! She screams and then she does something!\" There was Diana. \"Time to be nice,\" said Adam. \"Hey Diana, are you happy to see me?\" \"Oh no! Frank!\" \"Oh no! Eva!\" \"Steady. Say something nice.\" \"You look nice.\" \"Get out of here!\" \"Hey, you like it rough?\" \"It was awful. I saw Diana, and everything went blank. And I just ran, Eva. I just ran away. And then I heard these high-pitched screams.\" \"And it was me.\" \"Yeah?\" \"Well, I've got bigger problems.\" \"Frank is a good artist.\" \"He's gonna paint me onto a picture... and sell it to every worker in the FR country, or wherever the place he's from.\" \"Gabriel, I'm gonna be the picture of the FR country.\" \"You know, being here under the sky... sitting in the grass... makes me really glad I'm not poor.\" \"Friend, check out that fire, baby.\" \"Yeah, if there's one thing I'm good at, it's turning a small fire into a big fire.\" \"Friend, that one log is burning'.\" \"What the\" \" Is that my toy?\" \"Yes.\" \"It's got a nice, warm sound.\" \" Broken!\" \" Back off, friend.\" Jessica doesn't want you.\" \"Yeah?\" \"She still has feelings for me and you know it!\" \"Okay, okay, okay. Stop it! This isn't fun for me anymore!\" \"What? What do you mean fun for you?\" \"I didn't say that.\" \"Yeah, you did.\" All right. What are you trying to do? You're getting your kicks off of watching us jump over you.\" \"No. We didn't jump over.\" I'm good at that. I would have won that.\" All right. I'm done with this, Jessica. You choose right now. Me or him.\" \"Yeah, who's it gonna be?\" \" Wait. What? No. I\" - What's the matter? You don't know?\" \"No, I don't know.\" Wow. Acting. I know. For a second there I almost forgot about my friend. Oh, no! Yeah, where is the friend? And where's Frank? That was amazing, huh? It was okay. Okay's good enough for me. Wow. Yeah, I don't know if it's the fresh air... or the bad plant... but... I slept great. Oh, no. It's almost late morning. We're late for the party. Wait, wait. Friends? Friends, where's the car? I think it's clear, Jessica. The kind woman stole it.\" \"Why would a ghost need a car?\" \"What's she gonna do, get a ride? Who's gonna pick up a ghost?", "hash": "63879b9c4cd37546a389e3f4219c87af82c5d5f2b34db96bd040150c7221d4fe"}
{"text": "\"Oh, no!\" \"See you, David.\" \"Emma, no, no, no!\" \"Do that in your own time.\" \"According to a famous book... every fight is won and lost before it begins.\" \"Well, then I guess you have already lost.\" \"Oh, that's not very kind.\" \"Let's go!\" \"Ladies.\" \"Hi again.\" \"This is the third time we've been out.\" \"I know.\" \"We're shutting this down.\" \"You don't want to stop the fun.\" \"You want to join us.\" \"Why don't you put the things in the car and you come in?\" \"Hey, Patrick.\" \"Sorry I'm late, friend. \"That map thing was wrong.\" \"I know it, friend. I'm right with you with that thing. Look, guys. Is this about earlier? When you first came, I thought you were dancers? Because that was an accident. You're just very nice. Those clothes are great. If we have to come out here again, it's a big fine. Close it down. Okay. Message received. It's done. I give my word. I'm going inside, get on the thing, shut it down. I don't understand why you won't just put it on. Because I don't find the idea of mocking... people as amusing as your friends do... and because I don't share your big need to fit in. By not putting the thing on, you are setting yourself... and me apart from my friends... which is a bad gesture. Fine. Happy now? Yes. Now I'm Mr. Fun Times. I'm very happy. Thank you. I'm going for a smoke. Good, because it's a fun party. Do we need to talk quietly around her? Oh, no, no, no. She sleeps through anything. Yes, you do. When the sitter left... Henry and I were like, 'Do it.' We have missed every party. No way we're missing the Party. Give it up for Henry. Henry's getting married soon. I really did it. What's the plan with your party weekend? Yeah! I think it's going to be... more of a party night. And it's going to be at my folks' place in NJ place. Sorry. One day early in the morning, Adam said, \"We're going to have a big Winter Wonderland party.\" Emma replied, \"Snow machine. We'll go sledding. It should be fun.\" Adam asked, \"Can I have your information?\" Emma said, \"What? My information? Are you joking?\" Adam said, \"No, I'm serious.\" Emma asked, \"Like what?\" Adam said, \"Like your phone number and your shoe size?\" Emma replied, \"Okay, okay. I have a pen here.\"\n\nAdam said, \"You always have to be ready and prepared.\" Emma looked at her baby and said, \"Oh, I'm so jealous of this baby. I want to get in there with the baby. Just kidding.\" Adam asked, \"Emma, what's your local number? You're a local girl.\" Emma joked, \"You're kidding me? Size 9 shoe. You know what they say, 'Big shoe, big uterus.'\" Adam said, \"I'll bring friends. Sorry, I see an old friend just showed up. I'll talk to you later.\" Emma replied, \"Nice meeting you too.\"\n\nLater, someone said, \"Daddy's got to go home.\" Then they said, \"One more for the road. Shotgun!\" Someone else said, \"I wasn't ready. Throw another.\" The first person replied, \"You're supposed to catch that. Come on, baby, we're going. Bye, guys. Sorry if I got beer on your baby.\"\n\nLater, Frank said, \"Where have you been? I'm sorry. There was this buzzing sound that was bothering me. I'm not seeing any doughnuts. You said to get the glazed ones.\" Gabriel replied, \"They didn't have glazed. I tried. There was jelly or Boston cream.\" Fiona said, \"I have ginger candies in my bag.\" Frank said, \"Thank you, but we'll be okay. I found you a big brown one!\" \"Well, that is early time.\" \"Yes!\" \"Anyone?\"\"Anyone?\" \"Anyone?\" \"Oh, you all are bad.\" \"Bad person.\" \"Want me to go to a place?\" \"Get some food?\" \"Don't worry about it.\" \"Now I will go jump in that pool... because a person is dying in there alone.\" \"That is what friends do.\" \"See, they don't leave each other hanging.\" \"Where is your spirit?\" \"My friend.\" \"I got you.\" \"My phone.\" \"Child, what are you doing here?\" \"Oh, yes, I own the place. This is my child, Ryan.\" Hi. Great party. Thanks for letting us sleep. No problem. It must have been quite a time. Oh, yes, I guess so. I did the best I could with the bad people. I know you did, Benjamin. I wish you would have let me know you were coming. Maybe we can have someone on a couch. We're not staying. I just came for the day to do a greeting with the workers. You got the message, right? I saw that you called. I'm selling our home. What? You're selling our home? I'm hardly ever here anymore. It's time to sell. But hey, what about me? I'm always here. My friends are always here. So make me an offer. Child, come on. I don't ask you for anything. How about this? We go get food. We talk over the home situation. Maybe we all can pay for costs? I'm a little busy, child. We're gonna go play a quick game and then gotta get back. A friend has never played before. I'm so excited. Child, this is really bad. I'll call you next week. We'll do exercise. I've said it before and I'll say it again. Your father is a bad person. A drink? It's gonna be sad not coming here. Me and a friend might not even be around next summer. The NE city thing again? Are you serious? You just moved into that place in NE city. \"Thank you for helping me.\" \"You are welcome.\" \"You are a good friend.\" \"Hello, David.\" \"Hi.\" \"Can I assist you?\" \"Are you Ethan?\" \"Yes.\" \"Hi.\" \"We spoke on the phone earlier.\" \"I'm Adam from the Realty Group.\" \"And this is my coworker Grace.\" \"Hi. How are you?\" Hi. No, thank you. We can't wait to get your home sold. We need this place clean every day. Water the lawns, keep the pool clean. You never know when buyers will come to see and buy. Oh, buy! Maybe I should add some flower petals on the driveway too. Just do what you can. Will do. What are the chances of selling this after summer ends? You want to sell a summer home during the summer. That's the point. So glad we're working together. We should put it closer. Like there? Oh, yeah. That will attract the right buyers. Listen. Have you thought more about the final summer event? I don't know. We have to do something big. But what for a final event? Go out in a good way. Heads held high. Deserved. Oh no. Here we go. I got the idea right here. Brown party. Brown party. Brown clothes, brown food, brown drinks... brown decorations... live music. I don't know what you're thinking. Is that good? It's not very good. Take it easy. I'm just suggesting ideas. It's not like you're giving ideas. It doesn't matter. Oh no. We have a situation here. Oh my goodness. \"Oh no, she looks very pretty.\" \"That is trouble for us.\" \"Her dress is blue.\" \"Her dress is blue.\" \"Her dress is blue.\" \"She can open her mouth very wide.\" \"When she comes near me, I will stare at her all night long.\" \"No, no, no.\" \"Please do not do that.\" \"Do not.\" \"No, stop.\" \"Stop.\" \"Stop it.\" \"I think she can open her mouth very wide like a big snake eating a mouse.\" \"Do you know what you want?\" \"Yes, we do.\" \"Yeah, we have a good idea.\" \"No, we want ice cream. Do you think a pretty girl like that sees us as two old men? The way we used to see 30-year-old men back in school and say: 'Oh look at that old man trying to impress Susan'.\" \"Yeah, probably.\" \"I do not know. Were not 30-year-old men much older back then, with mustaches and jobs?\" \"It certainly seemed like it.\" \"Yeah.\" \"What?\" \"Dude, we are getting old.\" \"No way. Come on. I got a foot cramp the other day while exercising. What? That does not make sense. I swear it happened. Do you think that girl and her friends really have parties where they kiss a lot?\" \"Maybe.\" \"Really? Our friend is right. We missed out. Dang. Hey, what about that? What about what? What about that for the final party? What? A party. A party? You want to have a party? Why not? No way. It will never happen. Why not? Why not? Because people do not have those kinds of parties, you know? Oh, come on. They used to. True. Yeah, think about it, dude. A party. A good old-fashioned party. That is a fun way to end. Okay. Now you know I do not like people who say no, right? But I am going to say no. Really? Really. Are you saying no? Oops, I am saying no right now. We are going to have a party. \"Let's go to the park.\" \"No, I don't want to go. The bugs are bad there.\" \"But I've had that sickness before.\" \"It's not a big deal. You just take some medicine.\" \"But I'm scared of needles.\" \"Okay, fine. You stay inside.\" \"Yeah, bye.\" \"Hey Adam, can you get some dirt for my back?\" \"I'll get some for your body too.\" \"Okay. If you dated four people this year and had relations with them, would that be okay?\" \"Sure, that's fine with me.\" \"But you haven't had relations with anyone this year or last year. So it would just be doing that with four people in a shorter time.\" \"I never thought of it that way before. What do you think?\" \"That's not a good idea and could be dangerous. But if I decide to do it at first but then change my mind, they would let me stop, right?\" \"Uma, it's not a bad thing unless someone doesn't want it. It's only fun if everyone agrees.\" \"I'm going to do it.\" \"I'm going to do it.\" \"Yeah, go for it!\" \"Hey, what are you all talking about?\" \"Just discussing how to help Uma find a partner. Gabriel's relative Frank is coming to the event. He runs a sports place in the NE city. Pretty cool.\" \"Okay, let's do it.\" \"All right, let's play.\" I'll tell you what I'm doing and you still won't get it. A slow moving ball.\" \"Wow, you got me!\" I dare you to do that again. Sweet move, the smart person wins. Let's practice, everyone. Look ready. Hat or no hat for the album cover? \"Hey Benjamin, you've been working on this for two years. Mixing songs, putting on hats. Your music is great.\" \"Okay.\" \"Did Adam date Gabriel or Ryan?\" \"I can't remember.\" \"Goodness, it's strange watching you play this game.\" \"It's not fun.\" \"Look, Frank, it's your life.\" \"You can do whatever you want.\" \"All I'm saying is that maybe in the late summer... might be the last time for you.\" \"Knock, knock.\" \"Guess who.\" \"David.\" \"These are the Webers.\" \"How are you doing?\" \"We brought some extra signs... because someone is taking ours.\" \"That's not nice.\" \"Oh, good. Okay.\" \"Hey, friends. Do me a favor? When you go in the house, don't go to the basement or anything. Not that there's anything or anyone down there behind bars or otherwise. Thanks, Henry. That's so helpful. What is Adam talking about? Oh, my. Don't worry.\" \"Don't worry.\" \"Don't worry.\" \"Adam is a little confused. It's a head injury. That's why Adam wears the helmet. Are they all challenged?\" Yes. But at least they have each other. Oh, that's so wonderful. Have fun with your game, dear. Thanks, Mrs. Weber. We are five minutes from IN Beach. And wait until you see your bedroom. What if someone comes in? These people never knock. I just locked the door. Fine, but you really must be quiet. None of your usual loud sounds. Okay, okay, okay. Yes? Yeah. Oh, Nathan. Let's get you out of these dirty little clothes. Do it. What? What's going on? Why are you stopping? What's going on? Hey. What? What have you done to your private area? I shaved it. Why? I don't know. Because I thought it would be something different, fun. Grown-ups are supposed to have hair there. Why would I find it fun? You look like a young kid. I'm not interested in young kids. Okay, you know what, it's hair, Nathan, and it's going to grow back. Well, I wished you would have told me... about your little change before I opened this. These special coverings cost a lot of money. It's wasteful. I did it for you! \"You should have asked me.\" \"I do not make you wear nice smells because you do not want to!\" \"Alice, you are acting like a small child.\" \"Go away!\" \"You go away.\" \"I think this is a science thing.\" \"Dear, what amount are you going up?\" \"You...\" \"Go away!\" \"This is your problem.\" \"I was just showing my feelings in a good way.\" \"Alice, we can try new things a little bit.\" \"Fine.\" \"I am going back to the town and I am taking the music player.\" \"Fine. Leave!\" \"And your breath is not nice!\" \"My breath is normal. Not like your private part.\" \"Go away!\" Oh no. Sorry. It is okay. The worst part is I am just going to the bathroom right now. I have been thinking about some ideas. Party ideas. Tell me what you think. First one is about Rome, right? You have special clothes, grape drink...baskets of grapes, all of that. Then I also have 'the 70s', right? We have the swinging feeling, clothes from that time, big hair...above and below, you know? I do not know. What about a famous drama? That is not bad. Yeah? Yeah, like the secrets of the East, right? Oh, that's... Yeah. You know you have like nice smells, wall hangings. See-through fabrics. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I have no idea what that is, but I like it. You and me, we both like this. Right? I think so. Absolutely. How do you spell 'special drama'? Yeah. Friend, look at that woman at 3 o'clock direction. That direction. That thing hurts my private part. Wait a minute. That is Katherine. Who? My house seller. Oh no, the enemy. Listen to me. Listen. We cannot lose the house for fun before the holiday, okay? You go over there, you act nice with her, be charming... and get her to sell the house soon. No, no, that is... Yes, yes. She is a tough person. She will see through that. Her? Please, friend, you are the king. A little nice talk, she will be your humble servant. Two friends were talking. One friend said, \"Go and talk to Kelly. Smile at her.\" The other friend went to Kelly and said, \"Hello, Kelly.\" Kelly said, \"Oh, hello, Frank.\" Frank said, \"Look at this. I hope I did not say anything to upset the client. I was just joking.\" Kelly replied, \"Oh, no. Not at all. I was able to convince them that you ride the short bus because you were wearing that helmet.\" Frank said, \"Well, that's good. Thanks. Well played. Hey, do you mind if I take you out to dinner or something? Could be fun, yeah?\" Kelly said, \"Oh, gosh, thanks. Technically, I'm not supposed to go out with clients.\" Frank said, \"Right now I'm just some random dude on the beach.\" Kelly smiled and said, \"Okay. I'll go to dinner with you. But tell me which party we met at.\" Frank tried to guess different party names, but Kelly gave him a hint, \"I wear a size 9 shoe.\" Frank realized, \"Oh, my God, you're bean dip girl. I was gonna call you. I had your number on my hand and I jumped in the pool and it was gone. I thought I lost you.\" \"And you...\" \"You look so much better without the fake baby.\" \"I actually prefer the mullet.\" \"Oh, I just cut it yesterday.\" \"For work.\" \"Don't think this whole funny, charming thing right now... gels you off for stealing my signs.\" \"I don't know what you're talking about.\" \"I'm furious those signs are gone.\" \"You are lying.\" \"I am not lying.\" Your voice just went up.\" What? \"I am not lying.\" \"I am not lying.\" You are lying. No, I'm not. Wow, look at that, huh? \"Holy smokes.\" \"Another gorgeous shot.\" \"Yeah, thanks.\" \"What should I use, pitching wedge or nine?\" \"I used the nine.\" \"I think maybe I should use the wedge.\" \"Or use the wedge.\" \"Why am I like this?\" \"Oh, just pick a club and hit it.\" \"What is the big deal?\" \"Will you do the fun thing with me?\" \"Hey, can we play through?\" \"Hold on a second, man.\" \"The fun thing. You think that would be a good idea?\" \"I'm stuck.\" And I think the reason... is because I feel like a fraud. I'm not cool. I have a degree. I ride a vehicle and it scares me. And I play golf at my mom's group... with people like this. What's the holdup? Play the wedge! This is not cool. This could be really good for me. For me and for us. Will you do the fun thing with me? Sure, yeah, yeah, whatever. Yeah. Really? Holy smokes. Yeah. If you're sure this is what you want. Yeah, absolutely. Good. I think. Watch out!\n\nSo you wanna know why guys don't get as excited... about their wedding as women do? See, it used to be like a guy would get rewarded for his commitment with fun. But you and Glenn have had fun like a billion times. For God's sake, you guys have a kid together. So for Glenn, it's just kind of like all commitment, no reward. You know? I'm the reward. Of course you are. Of course. No. Hello? Something's wrong. He's never late. \"Try him again.\" \"I have been trying him.\" \"He's not answering his phone.\" \"At least he won't wear a white outfit like you friends.\" \"Oh, that's good.\" \"Oh, sweet friend in heaven.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"No.\" \"No, no, no, better.\" \"I'm wearing a thing called The Thing.\" \"From a shop.\" \"One end straps around your leg, the other end around your private part.\" \"The paper says, 'With every stride, it gently pulls your private part'.\" \"What are you doing with a rope on your private part at my wedding?\" \"Practice, holiday.\" \"For what?\" \"A private activity?\" \"What?\" \"Yeah.\" \"That's exactly it.\" \"You got it right.\" \"Hey, check it out.\" Look who's here. Another friend in white outfit. Keep the money, friend. Oh, my friend. Well, well, well. Look at you. You're late, you're in outfit, and you appear to be drunk. Who are you? Long story. I lost my job. What? What? It had more to do with the fact that I almost ruined a big deal...because a friend jumped into the pool with my phone. Oh, no. Friend. I spent most of last night crying and drinking...and then I called my mother. She kind of helped me. Then I woke up this morning...had a little more to drink and I realized, you know what? This is good. I'm free. Adam, I'm so sorry. You're my friend. No, they took my young years from me. And I plan to make my later years making up for it. And you know what else? I'm doing the activity. Why not. Activity? What activity? That's what we're doing for the holiday. An activity. No way. Who's having an activity? It's me, Willow, these two friends...Laura, friend, now drunken friend. Waiting on friend. Sweet friend. How come you friends didn't think of this activity...five years ago? \"Oh no!\" \"Adam said\". \"I am afraid we will have to start without your friend.\" \"Oh, he is here.\" \"He is...\" \" \"Hi, friend.\" \" \"No.\" \n\"I did not mean to say that.\" \"Okay, everybody.\" \"Introducing for the very first time...\" \"Mr. and Mrs. Adam.\" \"Here we go.\" \"I am married.\" \"Thank you.\" \n\"I cannot believe you two broke up because he shaved his hair.\" \"He is the strangest, weirdest guy ever.\" \"Here you are, ladies.\" \"You two are definitely broken up this time, right?\" \"I do not want relationships right now. All I want to do is have some fun. Labor Day weekend. I am in.\" \"Yes.\" \"Yes.\" \"Yes.\" \"Oh, and I have shaved all my hair.\"  \"Olivia.\" \" \"Oh, no, no, no. I am not making a speech.\" \n\"Sorry about that. It is a private talk.\" \"Are you okay?\" \"You know what they are doing over Labor Day weekend?\" \" \"What?\" \"They are having a big party.\" \" \"What are you talking about?\" \"They are having a big party. Like a celebration with many people?\" \"Hi. So is it true? That all of you are having this big party... and you did not think to invite us?\" What are you all looking at me for? I... You two just got married, okay? You have a child. You do not think it is inappropriate? Well, of course we would not come. It is that you did not ask us. You did not even think of us. In fact, you specifically hid this from us. We invited all of you to be here today... the most special day of our lives... and you, who are supposed to be our closest friends. There were family members who did not get invited so you could come.  Family members.  Now, we are just totally out of your little social group. I do not believe this.  Sorry.  Are you happy? Because you and your stupid party just ruined our special day.  Oh, come on, Adam.  Kate! Is it too late to invite them? No!  Are you kidding me? \"I brought a bag with me if you need one.\" \"Give me the sign.\" \"I won't need one.\" \"Candy?\" \"Yes.\" \"What do you want?\" \"The word is a common thing.\" \"Who's your friend?\" \"Victor, friend of my uncle.\" \"Yes.\" \"He told me to expect you.\" \"Come inside.\" \"Welcome to the fun place.\" \"What is this?\" \"Can I take off your clothes?\" \"No.\" \"You sure?\" \"Yes, I'm sure.\" \"Okay, follow me.\" \"This is Benjamin.\" \"Hey, Benjamin.\" \nThat was a toy.\nGo easy on that thing.\nPeople's names.\nLook at that. That's nice.\nThis group right here. They're very lively.\nOkay. If you want, join in. You will like it.\nMy grandma has that thing too.\nAnother time, probably.\nYou need anything, ask for Frank.\nIs Frank's Beds here?\nThat's a different Frank. I'm a tooth doctor.\nVictor, he is over there in the sofa section. Okay?\nOkay.\nHave a good time. Thanks, Dr. Frank.\nYou guys be good.\nShould've had this at the party.\nLove the new fun thing.\nWhat are you doing? Oh, my goodness.\nVictor? Hey, Matthew. Little Matthew.\nMy, you've grown.\nHow are you doing, child?\nGood, good.\nHow's your family?\nGood, they're on a trip. Mom's food recipe was published.\nThis is my buddy Eric. Eric, Victor.\nYour mom's a nice woman.\nOh, how are you doing, man?\nYes. Good to meet you.\nThis is Emily.\nEmily.\nHi, guys.\nHi.\nEric and Matthew.\nIt's Mike. I go by Mike now.\nFirst time at the fun place, guys?\nGot new people here.\nCome on, guys, take off your clothes and have fun.\nNo. No fun.\nNo.\nActually, no, no. We're here more learning than anything else. We will have a party. Can you give us advice? Okay. Let's talk at the food place. The food place is good. Just wait a moment. No hurry. Hurry a little. Come on. Time to start. Yes. Almost. Let's keep going for a second. I'll be right there, just a second. There. Look at me, not her. Look at me, not her. Look at me. I'm not going to look at him. Did your brother finish school? He switched schools a couple of times. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes, yes. Please count down for me. Five, four, three... Go back to 10! Ten, nine, eight... Your mom is a good woman. A little early on that one. He just said your mom is a good woman when he did something... just so you know. Wow, I got another one. Wow. So you kids will have a party? Vic, as someone who has clearly done this type of thing many times, we could really use your help. How do we make sure the girls are interested? The girls? Don't worry about the girls, worry about you guys. Us? What? Girls understand their feelings. Guys are more likely to be scared at the sight of someone else's thing. A small food? No, thanks. I ate just before I came. You see? This is what I'm talking about. You're very scared. You won't even touch the small food. It's like it's a thing and you're afraid to put it in your mouth. I swear, I had a burger not long ago. Hi. Hi. Hi. Okay, so how do we make it happen? You can't make a party happen. It has to happen naturally. Just because you have a bunch of people together doesn't mean you'll all do it. You might just need an intense talk. Sometimes a girl just wants to talk from the heart and she ends up doing something. Doing something? \"Yes, you know.\" \"A choo-choo train.\" \"That's right, a choo-choo train.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Hey.\" \"\"Ellen, hello.\" \"Adam.\" \"Two minutes left.\" \"I'm ready when you are.\" \"Ellen is always ready.\"\n\n\"One more thing.\" \"Yes.\" \"\"Every animal group has a leader.\" \"I think you are the lead animal?\"\n\n\"Yes, that's right.\" \"Yes.\" \"\"Well, then it's all on your shoulders. If you don't run, nobody behind you can run.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's good.\" \"What does that mean?\"\n\n\"You have to take off your clothes. Not just your body clothes. You have to take off your mind clothes, your heart clothes, your spirit clothes. You have to be honest with yourself and everybody about what you want. If you like something special, be honest about that. If you like more than one partner, say it. If you want to wear special clothes, embrace it. But trust me, if you put up walls, everybody will put up walls. The whole thing won't work.\"\n\n\"I don't understand that special thing.\"\n\n\"A woman uses a special toy to play with a man in a special way.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see. Well, I'm willing to try anything twice, like I always say.\"\n\n\"Hey, everyone.\"\n\n\"Hello, important person.\"\n\n\"This is a lot to think about.\"\n\n\"Listen to me. You can't force it and you can't pretend. So you better stop lying, be a real man. Now if you'll excuse me, I feel energetic.\"\n\n\"I noticed that.\"\n\n\"Well, hey Adam, thank you. This is all good advice.\"\n\n\"Yes, you're welcome.\"\n\n\"Okay, be careful with that.\"\n\n\"This is not needed.\"\n\n\"Be careful with that. Good luck.\"\n\n\"Oh, one more thing. Buy some nice smelling candles. It helps hide the special smell.\"\n\n\"Okay, good idea. Smart, smart.\"\n\n\"Don't eat anything here.\" \"Oh, boy.\" \"Keep going.\" \"Don't let her see you.\" \"Hey, what is wrong?\" \"Man, oh, man.\" \"All right.\" \"That was good?\" \"That was good.\" \"Yeah.\" \"\"Yeah, okay, here we go.\" \"You ready?\" \"Showtime.\" \"Sh...\" \"I'm gonna count that.\" \"Okay.\" \"I'm gonna count that there.\" \"Okay.\" \"Yeah, it's childish.\" \n\nI've been meaning to ask you something. What? What's Diana like as a boss? She just seems like she could be a little, you know, strict.\n\nOh, my gosh, no. I mean, she's not what you think, you know. I mean, of course, at work she's all business... but, Adam, she has traveled the world. No surprise. She speaks all these languages. She's just full of surprises.\n\nOh, I bet she is. I bet she's been places I can only imagine.\n\nSo, like, now that you're super into me... No, there's something I actually have to tell you. Sincerely I... Really?\n\nYeah, I kind of misled you. What you saw today was not an actual representation... of my Frisbee golf skills. Yeah. I let you win. Really? Yeah.\n\nSo I want a rematch. Like, bigtime. Or you could just stick to being bad at pool.\n\nOne more. That's it, though. No. That was the last one. That's for the road. I will call you. Okay. All right. See you. Hey...\n\nWhat are you doing for the summer break? Oh, yeah. Is that...? Yeah, summer break. You know what? The friends and the team, we're all gonna... We're doing this small little thing... this casual little thing. Nothing... Nothing special.\n\nWell, I was thinking that maybe, you know... your friends and my friends could get together. Yeah. Oh, that sounds great. Yeah? We should definitely look into that maybe. Yeah. It'd be fun.\n\nSo, wait, Adam, is that...? Is that a maybe? Yeah, it's a maybe. It's a definite maybe. It's a hard, hard maybe. We should definitely think about doing that. \"Let's keep it as a choice.\" \"Okay.\" \"Okay.\" \"Okay.\" \"I will talk to you about it.\" \"Or write to you.\" \"Okay.\" \"A bird will bring a message.\" \"Something.\" \"I will contact you.\" \"Good night, Eric.\" \"Good night, Kelly.\" \"Hey.\" \"Hi. What are you doing up? Oh, I never went to sleep. I stayed up drinking with a person from a music group in the parking lot. A little while ago, that person said a bad illness is back. Great. Another worry. What are you doing up? I have a small problem. Tell me. But first, you cannot tell anyone. Friend, look who you're talking to. It's a secret place. Seriously. Many people say you cannot tell someone, and those people go and tell someone. That cannot happen. Hey. You tell no one. Not even a landscaper? Why would you tell an older worker about my life? Because he gives good advice, okay? But if you're going to be weird about it, I won't tell the worker. I appreciate it. I went on a date last night. So far, so good. With the person selling houses. Did she do something bad to you? No, not that person. I went out with Kelly. Oh, thank goodness. I felt bad for a minute. Yeah. Yeah, and I think we have a problem because I really like her now. I don't know what to do about the group situation. Are you joking with me? I know. What are the chances? I mean, seriously, I'm right in the middle of organizing a group event. Group event, yeah. Yes. Yeah. And I meet the first girl in a long time that I can see myself having a relationship with. I have to tell her about the group event. What? No. No. No. It's so silly. No. Listen to me. No, no. You don't ever, ever, ever tell her about our little event here. Ever. Have you done anything yet? Oh, I hate when you say things. \"No.\" \"No, we have hugged.\" \"Hugged, good.\" \"Okay, good.\" \"Keep it child-friendly until after the summer break, okay?\" \"As long as you have not had... the commitment talk, and you're not focusing...\" \" Yes, I know.\" \" Then you, my friend... are a free person.\" \"I don't know, buddy.\" \"Listen to me.\" \"You do not know what or who... they have been doing in their free time, friend.\" \"So just keep it proper until after the summer break... and then it will just be this exciting... fun adventure in your past... that you never have to tell them about.\" \"Okay.\" \" Okay?\" \" Alright, that's the plan.\" \"Thank you.\" \"That was oddly helpful.\" \"I am not just a pretty face.\" \"Parent really needs to exercise.\" \"Oh, I agree. I may even eat less... except for pizza and sandwiches, obviously.\" \"Are you guys worried at all about performing in front of everyone else?\" \"Look, it's not a race.\" \"Well, assuming that we can all succeed... one of us will be the smallest.\" \"And I, for one, do not want to be the smallest.\" \"Okay.\" Two things. The friends are going to be too concerned about their bodies to think about yours. And secondly, that's not true. Friends do not care about size. Who do you think is the biggest? I think I know. You're next, friend. No one said anything about giving any sample. And can someone explain why they need to check... to find out if there's a problem? Summer after first year...\" Yes? \" I walked in on one of the friends... doing something private.\" \" Wow. Who?\" \" I won't say.\" No, no, no, who? Who?\"Who? Who? I'm not going to tell you, but I will say that it was a big one. Hey. That is my sample. That used to be inside you. I'm going to lie down. What? Friend, friend! You have to give us an idea... Right, right. Like is that...? It's more like... It was like that. \" What? \" But bigger. \" What? \" It's even bigger. Friend likes. I don't know if you're going to like it. \"Hi.\" \"Alice?\" \"Katherine.\" \"We're just going back to the city.\" \"We'll talk this week.\" \"Good.\" \"About the house.\" \"Of course, the house, yes.\" \"Yeah, I'll call you.\" \"Emma.\" \"Ethan.\" \"The password this week is 'unicorn'.\" \"Well, I don't know if that'll be needed...\" \"We're here to share our experiences... in creating the perfect party of your dreams.\" \"See that? Everyone's always touching two people. A little teamwork. They're playing well together.\" \"Okay, I think we understand.\" \"Kevin, you want some pizza?\" \"No, I'm not hungry. Thank you.\" \"Got an all-I-can-eat buffet going right here.\" \"Let me try.\" \"Try this.\" \"What is that? Yuck!\" \"Oh, he's doing my move. Look at that. He knows the move.\" \n\nHey, you all? Back to the music. Are we...? Are we really gonna listen to that music the whole night? I think it might get a little... boring? \n\nAgreed. Yeah. I'm making a great playlist right now. Got some different songs. \n\nWho has fun to that music? Nobody.\nNo that music. No that music. No that music. \n\nI think we need something nice, like this singer. I love this singer. No. Not that singer. Absolutely not that singer. That's wrong, friend. If that singer comes on the music player... guess who's leaving. This person.\n\nThat singer, it is then.\n\nSo I... Yeah?\nGot you a little gift. \nReally? It's filled with some great things for next weekend.\nIt's not my birthday.\nHey. Look, oh wow. Yeah.\nOh, wow, look at that person. He's like a helpful person.\nWow, that's great. People are gonna love that. \nJust so you know... I'm not wearing any clothes right now.\nOn these chairs? \nWell, well, well, the friends are all here.\nPatrick. Hi. Paciellio. Hi, friends. What's up?\nWe have some business to discuss.\nRight. Ethan and Isabel talked about something. David said \"No. Why not?\" \nAdam, a helper, said \"I think it is a bad idea.\"\nIsabel said \"Just because we have a baby does not mean you should treat us differently. Plus, Emma's body looks good right now.\"\nMichael said \"Thank you, Michael.\"\nMatthew said \"Michael, are you silly?\" \nDavid said \"Look who it is. This is my helper, Katherine.\"\nKatherine said \"I have heard so much about all of you.\"\nDavid said \"How? When? What? Why?\" \nIsabel said \"You have no idea what we can do. We are very strong.\"\nAdam said \"That's right. You are not as strong as us.\"\nIsabel opened a gift. It had toys inside.\nDavid said \"What's going on with the place we live?\"\nKatherine said \"I was able to slow things down so you can stay until the end of summer.\"\nDavid said \"Really? Thank you so much.\" \"What?\" \"What's happening?\" \"Nothing.\" \"He told me not to tell anybody so...\" \"Yeah, okay.\" \"You know.\" \"Keep it quiet.\" \"Yeah.\" \"He asked her out to get them to wait.\" \"Went on a couple dates, likes her... doesn't want to sleep with her before the party...\" \"...because it's wrong to do both.\" \"He doesn't wanna sleep with her.\" \"That actually means he likes her.\" \"Awesome.\" \"Hey.\" \"Hello.\" \"Hi.\" \"Hi.\" \"Yo, friend, wanna help me?\" \"What is this stuff?\" \"Tanning lotion, friend. I wanna look like a performer. I just finished my third batch. You boys might wanna do the same. Don't wanna finish quickly like beginners. Oh, I am not touching you. Whatever. I'm gonna try again. You look so nice. So do you. Thank you. I love it. Be warned. This drink is the real thing. I had it brought in from FR city. The guy that sold it to me said it's the stuff a famous artist was on when he cut his ear off. Oh, no. It's gonna be a special night, huh? It smells like candy. A toast. A toast. A toast. To friends. To friends. To friends. And to being close with, to, near... On. In. Under. And behind.. All right, cheers. Sober. Never more. The pillows look really nice. Yeah. These from a store or...? You guys look great. Oh, thanks. You look so nice. I'm just being honest. I wanna touch your belly button. And yours, your belly button's nice too. You got a good one too. I haven't seen yours, but I'm gonna touch that thing a lot. As the friend in charge, right? I should stop this but I gotta be honest with you. I have no idea what to do, so... Friend in charge? Oh, yeah. You had to be there kind of. Okay. \"Listen up, everyone.\" \"As usual... it is up to me to get this party started.\" \"Hold on.\" \"I got something for you.\" \"Hold on a second, ladies.\" \"Yeah, fun time.\" \"Holy moly.\" \"We're on an adventure now.\" \"Yeah.\" \"How many animals had to die?\" \"Just one big old animal.\" \"They won't kick us out.\" \"If we're here, they won't kick us out.\" \"Okay.\" \"They won't do it.\" \"And we're totally sure we want to do this?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Somebody do something. All right? Anybody? All right, let's do it. I'm going to start touching myself. Oh. We could start with a back-rub circle like in school. I'll get things started. Yes. Yeah! Here we go. I'm sorry, I can't. I can't do this anymore. I can't. I can't do this. I'm sorry. I knew it. I knew you'd give up, friend. I'm not giving up. I'm in a relationship... that I really appreciate. And I don't want to ruin this. Classic friend. You know, it's like treats, no treats... hat, no hat, fun time, no fun time. We hike a look through the window... and if it looks, like, too strange or boring...\" \"Yeah.\" \"...we hike off. And if it looks, you know, cool, we go in.\" \"Okay?\" \"Okay.\" I'm not mad at you. Friend, Friend. I love what's going on here... but I don't think you need to insult. You should actually communicate. My friend, please. Give it a rest? Just one night? You're uncomfortable with emotion. Oh, yeah, I can't. I'm the only one here with issues. It's just me? What about you and your relationship? We broke up. You broke up? Yes. You broke up? Like you broke up a couple years ago at the fun party? That kind? What happened at the fun party? This one tells me that her and friend are broken up. \"I am going outside to get some fresh air.\" \"Clear my head.\" \"I thought this was going to be fun.\" \"Oh, yeah, oh!\" \"Why will God not let me have fun?\" \"Okay.\" \"All right, here we go.\" \"Adam.\" \"Katherine.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"I thought you were with your friends.\" \"I know.\" \"I know.\" \"Did you come here on a flying rug?\" No.\" No, no. I... It's a last-second costume idea for... Look, I... I've been thinking about things and I realized something. Oh no. I thought we ordered pizza. What did you get, foreign food? I'm sorry. Sorry to interrupt. Sorry. Patrick, give us a second? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You didn't call. I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, pizza? Really? I'm sorry. No, that's all right. Hey, what's up, man? Eighteen bucks. Go, have fun. Honestly. No problem. I'll call you tomorrow. Bye. Like I don't know that I don't have a girlfriend. Like I'm not trying to remember that every night of my life. It's hard. Hey. Hi. So where were we? Where'd you go? I know, I know, I know, I... I'm sorry I left. You know, I... I'm going to be honest with you guys. I'm freaking out a little. I have had the best times of my life... with you guys in this house... and I'm going to miss it. I'm going to miss it so much. I love you guys. I love every single one of you. She wasn't home, huh? No. No, she was home. She was on a date. Yeah. And I showed up dressed like a character. Well, I think that you look adorable. And I am so happy that you're back. It's been a pretty emotional night for all of us. How about a big group hug? Oh, yeah. Group hug. I love you guys. Oh, my God. \"Oh, my.\" \"I would not have called that.\" \"Hey, what was that about earlier?\" \"Yeah, nothing.\" \"Later.\" \"What?\" \"Wha...?\" \"Oh, gosh!\" \"It's happening.\" \"It's really happening.\" \"We can do this.\" \"I don't know if I can.\" \"We'll do it together.\" \"Okay?\" \"One.\" Two.\" Three.\" \"Hello, body parts. Are they okay? They're very good. Thank you. Oh. And just so you know... I've never been able to have a special feeling, so no pressure. I'm all about giving pleasure. This is so much better than watching videos. Well, hello there. Oh, my! I told you so. You weren't kidding. That is remarkable that Samuel is unsure. Let's drink! Everybody, drink from the ceiling. Hey, Matthew. Hi there. You guys gotta try these sweet fruit treats. They're so rich. Oh, no, no. I'm good. I just had some small snacks. Where'd you get small snacks? Forget it. Hello, strange people. We thought it might be fun... if we all went out and did a thing in the pool. Yes, yes. Yeah, you wanna go in the pool? No. No, no. We're good right here. We're good. Yeah. Thanks though. It's cleaned with chemicals. Have fun. Jessica, I'm so happy for you. Hey, guys, could we just get a minute? Just a minute? Yeah, just give us a sec, will you? Oh, so sorry. We're not giving you enough privacy at a party? Oh, kind of a fair hit. Yeah, now... Are you okay? You wanna talk or something? No, no. Just be in the moment. Okay. Yeah, no, can do. Can do. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh, a bad word, a bad word, a bad word. Oh, yeah? You like to say rude words? Yeah? A bad word. Okay, you wanna do a bad thing to me? You wanna do a bad thing to me hard? No, Jessica. Stop. My foot, my foot. \"Okay.\" \"Okay.\" \"Ouch, my foot hurts.\" \"Okay.\" \"That really hurts.\" \"Okay.\" \"Okay.\" \"Oh, my big toe is far away from my other toes.\" \"Okay, hey.\" \"Move it around.\" \"Move it around.\" \"Move it, okay.\" \"We should have done this long ago. Hey, friends. I ate too much. Okay. Are you okay? Yeah. Are you okay? Okay. It's better now. It's better now. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh no, it hurts again. It hurts more! The little toe also hurts now. Hey, friends. Let's have some drinks. Oh my! Oh my, I feel so good. We are all having fun. And I can be as loud as I want! Oh no. I lost my contact lens. Friend, my contact lens. I'm okay. I'm okay. Keep going. Count me down. What does that mean? Oh no! Count from 10. Count for him. This activity is not working well. Let's go inside. I'm so excited! Fruit drinks. Are you ready? As ready as I can be. I'm next, I'm next, I'm next. A vodka drink. Can I join? You are so nice. Go away. You haven't met anyone else yet. You are keeping her to yourself. Go away. Vodka. I'm sorry about the past. No. It's over. I don't care. No, but you are a really good friend and I love you. No, I love you. \"Almost there.\" Adam was happy. \"Keep going,\" Adam said. \"Keep going. It feels good.\" \nBenjamin said, \"How long has this been happening?\"\n\"About a short time,\" said Adam.\nAdam said, \"I am good. I am getting it.\"\n\"You are doing well, friend,\" said Benjamin. \"Almost there.\"\n\"Yes! Yes!\" shouted Adam happily.\nThe next morning, Benjamin said, \"Look what I got. Special day shirts here. Pink and blue.\"\n\"You made shirts?\" asked Charlotte. \"Where will we wear these?\"\n\"Anywhere,\" said Benjamin.\n\"I am tired,\" said Adam.\nBenjamin asked, \"How did I do?\"\n\"You did well,\" said Charlotte.\nAdam asked, \"Did I do my special thing? The thing with my fingers?\"\n\"You did it,\" said Charlotte. \"We do not need to see it again.\"\nThen Frank called. \"Hi Frank,\" said Benjamin. \"About last night...\" \"I'm sorry if I did anything weird to you or Wendy, any strange thing.\" \"Anything like that.\" \"I'm sorry.\" \"I was so drunk, I don't remember anything.\" \"Seriously, nothing?\" \"You don't remember anything?\" \"No.\" \"Nothing.\" \"I remember the strong drinks and then that's it.\" \"I'm so sad, that was gonna be a happy memory for the next 20 years of my life.\" \"I forgot everything.\" \"Thank goodness.\" \"Amen.\" \"I got something for you.\" \"Oh wow!\" Isaac did it. I got more coming. Oh, my friend, this is a big deal. I wanted a hat, but he was so passionate about no hat. No hat. Good work, friend. I still would've changed the pictures of people on your face. But it's just me. You made cool shirts. Wow. Yeah. Hey, Nora, grab one of those. It's blue and pink, my favorite. A medium. Awesome. It's the famous drama. Oh, there he is. Adam. Yeah, there you go. Thank you, I'm sorry, and you're welcome. Still a little sore. Hey. Yeah, I think we're going down shortly. Yeah, I'll see you there. That was Katherine. Bad person. She's going to the beach. I'm gonna meet her. That's gonna be an awkward situation. I wanna see it up close. Let's do it. I'm there. Give the bugs a goodbye hug for me, please? I will do so. Okay. I can stay here and spend time with you if... Yeah, yes. Okay. We could walk or swim in the pool or something. Oh, the... Yeah. I don't know about the pool after what happened in there early in the morning. But you wanna do the word game with me? I'd love that. Puzzle 16. So, what happened with you-know-who? Patrick apologized. He wants to go to help for couples. You're getting back together? We're gonna go to the city hall, get married, see if we can make it work. What? Just kidding. Yeah, no, it's totally over. \"And the person didn't finish the work.\" \"And the home still isn't sold.\" \"They're unhappy.\" \"They're unhappy.\" \"Great, now they're unhappy.\" \"They're unhappy.\" \"Now I must think of something to do for the holiday.\" \"We've been planning this idea for a dress-up party.\" \"You know, brown clothes, brown food.\" \"Hey, you remember Samuel, right?\" \"What do you want?\" \"The password is 'a word'.\" \"Who's your friend?\" \"Diana is our helper person.\" \"Oh, Diana. Yes, she's part of the group.\" \"Come in.\" \"Come in, you too.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Okay. What?\" \"That's hard...\"", "hash": "d0b7d287c9231fa2aa39600d58b1824f390c8ca261410c0dcec88489d526c92b"}

Not that it matters.\" \"Adam...\" \"Yeah? I have something to tell you about Dad. Adam. Sit down here. He is with the woman who sent him the letter. He is with her now. Why? The woman who wrote that letter is very ill. She only has six months to live, so he is going to be with her. It will not be forever. When she dies... Let us think that he went on a long trip for work. We will wait for him together. If there is someone who is very sick, we should help by giving that person what they need. I lent your dad to that dying person for half a year. So we are all doing something good, by letting him go. Do you understand? It does not matter to me. I am not troubled by Dad not being here. I see. I am sorry. It is okay. Are you done? Yeah. So it helps me a lot. Kevin... Yeah. What is the matter? I... Do not do it. What? You should not talk about your life story so easily. Do not talk about it to feel better. It is not good. Just tell me when you are ready. I will gladly hear it then. Here. I will call you silly then. Okay. Take care. I will. What is the matter? Eh? Nothing. You keep looking in the mirror. That is not true. It is true. That is your 13th time. Why are you counting? Because I have time. His cousin is coming. I know that. That is all. Do I look pale? You are an ill person. You look pretty today. Oliver was very sick. His friend David told a lie that Benjamin was Oliver's cousin. Benjamin came to visit Oliver with a gift. Oliver's nurse, Grace, welcomed Benjamin warmly. They talked for a bit. Then Grace asked Benjamin to leave so she could talk to Oliver alone. After Benjamin left, Grace said to Oliver, \"Benjamin seems hopeless. He talks too much. It is not proper for this place.\" Benjamin felt bad and decided to go home. But Oliver asked Benjamin to stay a bit longer and walk him to the gate, since he was supposed to be Oliver's cousin. On the way out, Oliver said, \"Grace is pretty, isn't she?\" Benjamin agreed. Alice and Benjamin were alone at the end. They felt weak and could not bear their own weakness. They pretended not to see it. They felt helpless as they started a trip with no destination. Over and over again.\n\nHolly is a flower that tells of winter's visit. It simply looked down upon Alice and Benjamin. The powdery snow danced on its way down.\n\nAlice and Benjamin wanted to wait together for the red fruit that would come soon.\n\nThe powdery snow danced on its way down.\n\nBenjamin wanted the strength to endure through the winter.

{"text": "Long ago, the business group was a small thing. Today, it is everywhere. Like the church, the king, and the communist party in other times and places, the business group is today's big thing. This shows the nature, growth, impacts, and possible futures of the modern business group. At first, given a small legal job, what has allowed today's business group to achieve such big power and influence over our lives? We start our look as problems threaten to start a big talk about the lack of public control over big business groups. \"I think there is a hangover over the market of distrust.\" \"Listen, 95 percent or some percent, a huge percentage of the business community are honest and show all their things, got fair pay programs.\" \"But there are some bad fruits...\" The media talk about the basic working ideas of the business world was quickly made into a game of follow the leader. \"I still think the US country is the greatest place in the world to spend.\" \"We have some shakeups that are going on because of a few bad fruits.\" \"Some people call me a bad fruit but I may be bruised but I still taste sweet.\" \"Some people call me a bad fruit but I may be the sweetest fruit on the tree.\" \"These are not just a bunch of bad fruits.\" \"This is just a few bad fruits.\" \"This is not just a few bad fruits.\" \"You have to get rid of the bad fruits.\" \"You can start with Tyco.\" \"Bad fruits.\" \"We know all about Worldcom.\" \"Bad fruits.\" \"Xerox Group.\" \"Bad fruits.\" \"Arthur Anderson.\" \"Bad fruits.\" \"Enron obviously bad fruits.\" \"Kmart Group.\" \"Bad fruits, the fruit cart is getting a little more full.\" \"I don't think it's just a few fruits unfortunately.\" \"I think this is the worst confidence crisis in business.\" \"What's wrong with this picture? Can we not pick a better example to describe the dominant thing of our time? Through the voices of CEOs, whistle-blowers, brokers, gurus and spies, insiders and outsiders, we present the business group as a paradox, a thing which creates great wealth but causes enormous and often hidden harms. I see the business group as part of a puzzle in society as a whole which if you remove it, the picture's incomplete. \"A group cannot work if each part does not work together.\" \"Like a sports team.\" \"Some of us block and tackle.\" \"Some of us run the ball, some of us throw the ball.\" \"But we all have a common purpose, which is to succeed as a group.\" \"A company is like a family.\" \"People in a company work together for a common goal.\" \"Like the telephone system, it reaches almost everywhere.\" \"It is very powerful, it is hard to avoid.\" \"And it changes the lives of people.\" \"I think on balance for the better.\" \"The eagle soaring clear-eyed, competitive, prepared to strike but not a vulture.\" \"Noble, visionary, majestic that people can believe in and be inspired by, that creates such a lift that it soars.\" \"I can see that being a good symbol for the principled company.\" \"Okay, enough talk.\" \"Companies are man-made things.\" \"You might say they are monsters trying to get as much money as possible at anyone's expense.\" \"I think of a whale.\" \"A gentle big fish which could swallow you in an instant.\" \"The creation has overwhelmed and overpowered its creator.\" \"As the company form has done with us.\" \"The word 'company' gets attached in almost a negative sense to and gets joined with the word 'plan'.\" \"And one hears a lot about the 'company plan' as though it is evil, as though it is a plan which is trying to take over the world.\" \"Personally, I do not use the word 'company'.\" \"I use the word 'business'.\" \"I will use the words 'business community' because I think that is a much fairer representation than focusing on just this word 'company'.\" \"It's funny that I've taught in a business school for as long as I have without ever having been asked so directly to say what I think a company is.\" \"...it is one form of business ownership... A group works together to earn big money for the owners. The modern company started in the 1700s. An Englishman named Thomas invented a machine to pump water from coal mines. This let miners get more coal. It was about getting more work done. Then it became about making more steel, fabrics, cars, and now chips and devices. Companies do the same thing but make fancier products. Companies are a big part of our lives now. Long ago, companies were groups that a state let do one thing, like build a bridge. There were few companies back then. They had rules about how long they could work, what they made, and couldn't own other companies. Companies served the public good. After the Civil War, there were lots of new companies like railroads and banks. Company lawyers wanted fewer rules so they could do more. The 14th amendment was meant to give equal rights to black people. \"And therefore it said\" \"No country can take away life\" \"freedom or things from any child without a fair process.\" \"And that was meant to stop the countries from taking away life, freedom or things from children as they had done for a long time in our history.\" \"And what happens is the big groups come into court and group lawyers are very clever.\" \"And they say\" \"Oh you can't take away life\" \"freedom or things from a person.\" \"We are a person.\" \"A big group is a person.\" \"And so the high court agrees with that.\" \"And what was very bad about this was that the new rule was passed to protect freed children.\" \n\n\"So for instance between a time and another time there were many cases brought before the court under the new rule.\" \"Many of these brought by big groups. A few by children.\" \"Many children were hurt to get rights for people and then with pen strokes over the next years, judges gave those rights to money and things while taking them from people.\" \n\n\"Everyone makes a mistake sometimes but I just can't take the blame.\" \"That's one of the weaknesses of a group, isn't it?\" \"Well maybe you'd better make the store into a big group.\" \"Make it into a big group?\" \"Yes!\" \"Making it a big group would give you the big advantage of what you want right now, no blame.\" \n\n\"You start with a group of people who want to put their money in a company.\" \"Then these people apply for an official paper as a big group.\" \"The country gives an official paper to that big group.\" \"Now that big group operates legally as one person. It is not a group of people. It is under the law one legal person.\" \"A big company has many of the legal rights of a person.\" \"It can buy and sell things...\" \"It can borrow money.\" \"It can sue in court and be sued.\" \"It can do business.\" \"A big company, along with thousands of other legal persons, is a part of our daily living.\" \"It is a member of our world.\"\n\n\"Having gotten the legal rights and protections of a person, the question arises: What kind of person is the big company?\" \"Big companies were given the rights of forever persons.\" \"But then special kinds of persons, persons who had no good thoughts.\" Cameron and David were talking. \"These are a special kind of groups which are made by rules to care only for their owners,\" said Cameron. \"And not for what are sometimes called their workers,\" said David. \"Like the town or the workers or whatever.\" \n\"The big problem of having company citizens is that they are not like the rest of us,\" said Cameron. \"As an important person in the EN country is said to have said, they have no spirit to save and they have no body to put in jail.\"  \n\"I think the mistake that a lot of people make when they think about companies is they think, you know, companies are like us. A big company is a kind old man with lots of stories. A young company is full of energy. Another company is aggressive. Another young company is outgoing and excited. Another company is nicely dressed. Another company is silly. Another company is very lovely.\"\n\"Do you know what that company is?\" asked David. \n\"No,\" said Cameron.\n\"They have feelings, they have beliefs, they really only have one thing, to make as much money as they can in a time,\" said David. \"That's it. Of course they make a profit and it's a good thing. That's what makes the way we do business work. To give us more of the things that we need.\"\n\"People say we only pay attention to the money part because they think that's what a business person thinks, it's just money. And it's not so because we as business people know that we need to care about the environment but also we need to be seen as helping members of the town,\" said Cameron. \"There are companies that do good for the towns. They make things and services that are of value to all of us that make our lives better and that's a good thing.\" Adam said, \"There is no group on this planet that can ignore its money needs.\" \"Even a person living under a tree needs help from someone.\" \"Everyone needs to think about money.\" \"It's not just about business.\"\n\n\"But unlike someone under a tree, all big companies have been set up by legal rules to have a strange thing. They must put the money needs of their owners first, even over other things. In fact, the company must put making money first, even over helping people. This is not a natural law, but a legal rule. They only care about making money for a few rich owners in the short term.\"\n\n\"To whom do these companies owe loyalty?\" \"What does loyalty mean?\" \"Well, it turns out that was a silly idea anyway, as companies only care about getting big and rich. In doing this, it helps them make others pay for how they hurt society.\"\n\n\"There's a bad word economists use for this called side effects. A side effect is when two people do something that hurts a third person who didn't agree to it. And there are real problems with that. There's no doubt about it.\"\n\n\"Running a business is hard. There are costs to cut at every turn, and at some point, the company says, 'Let someone else deal with that.' 'Let someone else protect the oil.' 'Let someone else build the roads we drive on.' 'Let someone else have those problems.'\"\n\n\"And that is where side effects come from - that idea of 'let someone else deal with that.' 'I have enough to handle myself.'\" A company is like a machine that makes things for other people. A shark is a machine that kills. Each one is made in a very good way to do certain things. The company does not have any questions about violence or will. It has within it the things that make it do what it was made for. The company needs to give results now and make other people pay for any costs. To know what kind of person makes the company act like a machine, we can look at it like a doctor would look at a patient. We can even make a diagnosis based on stories of how the company has hurt others.\n\nThis is the office of the NL group in the NY city clothes area. It's a bit messy. These are all from different events. To make this real as possible, we bought all the products from the factories we are talking about. This shirt costs $14.99. And the women who made this shirt got paid $0.03. Liz's jacket is made in the ES country. The jackets cost $178 and the workers were paid $0.74 for every jacket they made. Alpine car radios pay $0.31 an hour. It's not just shoes. It's not just clothes. It's everything.\n\nWe were in the HO country and some workers knew what kind of work we did and they said conditions in their factory are bad. Will you please meet with us. And we said we would. But you can't meet in the developing world. You can't walk up in a factory with your notebook and interview workers. There are guards, spies, and the police, so you do everything in secret. We are about to start the meeting and three tough-looking guys walk in. \"The company had found out about our meeting and sent these spies.\" \"Obviously we didn't have the meeting.\" \"But these young girls were really bright.\" \"And as they were leaving away from the eyesight of the spies, they started to put their hands underneath the table.\" \"And I put my hand under there and they put into my hand their pay stubs.\" \"So we'd know who they were, what they were paid, and the labels that they made in the factory, so we'd know who they worked for.\" \"So I took my hand after everyone had left.\" \"And in the palm of my hand was the face of Katherine Lee Gifford.\" \"And on the bottom of it was\" \"\"A portion of the proceeds from the sale of this garment would be donated to various children's charities.\" \"Very touching, it gets you right here.\" \"A big company is telling you, if you purchase these clothes, you will be helping children.\" \"The problem was, the people that handed us this label were 13 years old.\" \"Do many people in your family work here?\" \"Just me.\" \"How many people do you support?\" \"Eight people?\" \"And how do you do it with that salary? Is it enough?\" \"No.\" \"Let's look at it from a different point of view.\" \"Let's look at it from a point of view of the people in poor countries who are starving to death.\" \"The people who have nothing to offer except their low-cost labor.\" \"And in effect, what they're saying to the world is, they have this big flag that says\" \"Come over and hire us.\" \"We will work for very little money.\" \"Because a little money will buy us the food that we need not to starve.\" \"And come and rescue us from our poor situation.\" \"And so when a big company comes in, they are regarded by everybody in the community as an enormous blessing.\" \"Hey, wait! \"You cannot stay here!\" \"The door was open.\" \"No no no no no.\" \"Those are my clothes.\" \"Those are my clothes.\" \"These are not your clothes.\" \"Why your camera!\" \"?\" \"Do not touch her.\" \"Why!\" \"?\" \"This is a private company.\" \"How can you come here without permission?\" \"The door was open.\" \"The doors are for employees, not for you.\" \"We looked through the trash in the FR country.\" \"We always do this, we search around.\" \"One day we found a big pile of documents about costs.\" \"The company assigns a time for each task.\" \"They do not talk about minutes.\" \"They divide the time into very small parts.\" \"You get to the end of all the tasks.\" \"They give the workers 6.6 minutes to make the shirt.\" \"It is a small amount of money per hour in that country.\" \"6.6 minutes equals a tiny amount. \"These are the company's documents.\" \"The wages are a very small part of the price.\" \"This is the truth.\" \"This is how they make more money.\" \"What happens when these companies are successful in an area? They soon find that they cannot stay in that country because the wages are too high now.\" \"And that means the people are no longer poor.\" \"So we have employed all the poor people there, they are healthy and have money.\" \"Let us move to the next poor area and employ them and raise their level.\" \"The idea is that the company will help develop the country with jobs and money will spread to the communities. But because many countries want these companies, they have to give more and more benefits for companies to come to their area. A big box of papers came to my office. I opened them and found files about testing cows given a drug. This drug is used in many dairy farms in the FR country. The milk is drunk by many people since the government said it is safe for cows and humans. The company said there are no bad effects and they don't use medicine. But the files showed problems in the cows' hearts, lungs, kidneys, and other areas. They also showed troubles with baby making. An independent study said this drug causes too much pain and suffering for cows. It is just to make more milk. But we already have too much milk. Governments pay farmers not to make milk. This drug makes cows make more of what we don't need. Of course the company wants to give this drug to every cow for more money. But the drug caused infections in the cow's udders. This put pus in the milk when milking. There is a cost to the cows. A farmer said, \"The cows get sick when they get a special shot.\"\nAnother farmer said, \"They get shots with medicine.\"\nA doctor said, \"People are eating the same medicine through food. That is making people sick from super bugs that medicine cannot kill.\"\n\"If someone gets really sick in the hospital and the medicine does not work, they could die. That is very bad,\" said the doctor.\n\"Bad for the cow,\" said a farmer. \"Bad for the farmer. Bad for the person eating the food.\"\nA shopper said, \"I don't know if it is bad. But why should I take a chance?\"\nA different farmer said, \"Mean people used a bad plant spray in a far away country long ago. It made many sick with a scary illness.\"\nThe mean people had to pay money because the spray made soldiers sick too.\nOne day, a child woke up and could not breathe well. There was lots of white stuff in the river.\nThe next day, the child asked what the white stuff was. Someone said, \"The paper factory puts it in the river every night.\" Big factories make lots of dirty water. A long time ago, I sold oil to the big factories. I knew all the factory owners. I knew the people in the towns. No one wanted the river to be dirty. But the river was dirty. We made something bad. We looked for money, but we made something that could hurt us. The traders look for money. They do not think about the dirty places. They think about money. The traders do not stop buying things because they make places dirty. Sometimes they think about it. But they do not think about it for long. They need to buy things and make money. We do not know about the dirty places. We do not think about them at all. They are far away, and we do not hear about them. There are bad things near us too. We trade live animals. There are many animals in a place, and they make the rivers dirty. But we do not hear about that. One group looked at all the companies that did bad things. Big company paid money for making a big mess. Another company paid money for lying. Another company paid money for making places dirty. A company did something wrong and paid a fine. Another company also did something wrong. Many companies break rules. When it costs less to break rules than follow them, companies think it is just a business choice.\n\nOur world is like an airplane flying off a cliff. The airplane is not really flying. It only seems like flying because the ground is far away. But the airplane will crash because it does not follow the rules of flying. Our world does not follow the right rules, so it will also crash.\n\nEvery living thing on Earth is getting weaker. The air, water, and land that support life are getting worse. This affects not just humans, but 30 million other kinds of life. \n\nMost companies in the past took from the Earth, wasted things, and put waste back into the Earth. To make one dollar of money, companies had to take a lot from the Earth. \"When I learned I was surprised.\" \"We are leaving a bad place of trouble and hurt for little children's little children, not yet born.\" \"Some people have called that trouble for future children a form of tax without voice.\" \"We do the wrong thing to them.\" \"One question is if a big company can be like a bad person.\" \"If we look at a big company as a person, it may be easy to see the bad person in the big company.\" \"We could look at the things that make a bad person one by one and see how they might fit the big company.\" \"The big company would have all the things, and in many ways the big company is the perfect bad person.\" \"If the big thing of our time has been made to look like a bad person, who needs to fix its bad things?\" \"Can a building have right and wrong thoughts?\" \"Can a building have good work to help?\" \"If a building can't have good work to help, what does it mean to say a big company can?\" \"A big company is just a made-up thing, but the people in it, the workers, the bosses, they all need to have right and wrong thoughts.\" \"It's fair to say that every real human, not big companies but every real human, has right and wrong thoughts.\" \"We have the same things inside, but our way allows all kinds of behave.\" \"I mean each of us could be a bad helper and a good helper.\" \"No job with the big company has been as hard as the boss job.\" \"Even though it seems you have all the power to do what you want, the truth is you don't have that power.\" \"And sometimes if you really did what you wanted to do for your own thoughts and wants, you would act differently.\" \"But as a leader, you can't do that,\" said Adam. \"Actions have become so widespread that people tend to believe that leaders make these decisions without any thought for the human impact of their choices. It is never a decision that any leader makes lightly. It is a tough decision. But it is the result of modern business.\"\n\n\"When you look at a company, just like when you look at a strict parent, you want to separate the system from the individual. Strict parenting, for example, or other forms of control are inherently difficult, but the individuals involved may be the nicest people you could imagine: kind, friendly, nice to their children, even caring about others. As individuals, they may be anything. In their role within the system, they are strict because the system is strict. The same is true here.\"\n\n\"Some years ago, my partner and I had a demonstration at our home. 25 people arrived, they hung a big banner on the top of our house saying 'unfair', they danced around outside with masks and so on. As a public event it wasn't very effective because this is a rural area with few people, and it's not a very big house, which I think surprised them. But then we sat down and talked to them for a couple of hours, and we gave them tea and coffee, and they had lunch on our lawn. After about 20 minutes, they said, 'Well, the problem is not you, it's the big company.' And I said, 'Now wait a minute, let's talk about what the big company is. It's made up of people like me.'\"\n\n\"In the end, what we found in that discussion was that all the things they were worried about, I was worried about too - the environment, unfair situations, human rights. The big difference between us was that I felt I could actually contribute to these issues, while these people were frustrated because they felt they had nothing to do.\" An important person may care about nature. Since they have a lot of money, they can use some of it to help nature. But they must still do their job well, which is to make money. A big company in the NE country can cause a lot of pollution by burning gas. This hurts the environment. Even though the company says it cares about nature, it put some people in jail for protesting against the pollution.\n\nCompanies are not people and do not think. But people who work there can make bad choices, like creating seeds that will not grow again after one season. This stops nature from working normally. Making these seeds is only to make more money.\n\nMaking more money is very important to companies. This can make them do good things or bad things. One person worked for many big companies as a spy. They pretended to be hiring people for better jobs. But it was a trick to get secret information from other companies. This person lied and did not really have a new job to offer. \"I do not feel any guilt.\" \"It's you know what I mean, you have to expect that guys like me are out there.\" \"We're predators.\" \"It's about competition, it's about market share, it's about being aggressive, and it's about shareholder value.\" \"What is your stock at today?\" \"If you're a CEO, I mean, do you think your shareholders really care whether you're good or not?\" \"Do you think that they really, they would prefer you to be a nice guy over having money in their pocket?\" \"I don't think so.\" \"I think people want money. That's the bottom line.\" \"The fact that most of these companies are run by white men, white rich men, means that they are out of touch with what the majority of the world is.\" \"Because the majority of this planet are not a bunch of rich white guys. They are people of other colors, they are the majority. Women are the majority, the poor and working poor make up the majority of this planet.\" \"So the decisions they make come from not the reality that exists in the world.\" \"How much is enough? How much is enough? How much is enough?\" \"If you are a rich person, would it be okay just to be less rich?\" \"Wouldn't it be okay for your company to make a little less money...\" \"When I bought those two tickets for Frank and myself to fly to ID country, I was prepared for him to say okay, let's go. Not a chance. No? They're transferable. I can change it to another day. And call me on it, call my bluff. He's a smart guy. I mean, he's not stupid.\" \"And so I thought okay, get ready for this, especially because you know I bought good tickets. So you know it would be a comfortable ride at least, you know, and of course he tells me then.\" \"I've never been to ID country.\" Adam went to visit a factory. He had never been there before. He was very surprised. \"I cannot believe it,\" Adam said. \"The boss has never seen his own factory.\"\n\nA few weeks later, the boss called Adam. \"I might be able to go to the factory with you,\" he said. \"I am going to watch some tennis first. Maybe you can go to the factory, or maybe I can go after the tennis.\"\n\nFor many years, Adam did not think about taking things from the earth to make products. But then some people asked, \"What is your company doing to help the earth?\" Adam did not have an answer.\n\nAdam read a book called \"The Ecology of Commerce.\" In the book, there was a phrase \"the death of birth.\" This means when animals and plants die and cannot be reborn. Adam felt very sad after reading this.\n\nAdam wondered, \"Can any product be made without hurting the earth?\" \"Not every product can be made sustainably,\" said Alice. \"Can landmines be made sustainably?\" asked Benjamin. \"I don't think so,\" responded Alice. \"There is a more fundamental question about landmines. Some products should not be made at all.\"\n\n\"Unless we can make carpets sustainably, perhaps we don't have a place in a sustainable world. But neither does anyone else making products unsustainably,\" said Alice. \"One day, early in this journey, it dawned on me that the way I had been running my business was like a plunderer, taking something that belongs to every creature on earth.\"\n\n\"I said to myself, 'My goodness, the day must come when this is illegal, when plundering is not allowed. Some day, people like me will end up in jail.'\"\n\n\"When the terrible event happened, I didn't know at that time, and I want to say this because it's not a light situation. It was a devastating act, one of the worst things I've seen in my lifetime,\" said Alice. \"But every business person will tell you, the first thing they thought about was, 'How much is the price of gold going up?' The first thing that came to mind was, 'My god, gold must be exploding.' Fortunately for us, all our clients were investing in gold. So when it went up, they all doubled their money. It was a blessing in disguise. Devastating and heart-shattering, but financially, for my clients in the market, they all made money.\"\n\n\"I wasn't looking for this type of help, but it happened. When the war happened in the late 20th century, the price of oil went up a lot. We were all excited because the higher the price, the more profit we would make.\" Every person was saying that there was not a person that I know of that was not excited about that. This was a bad thing. This was something that was, you know, a bad thing happening. Booms. In bad times, there are also chances. Making money is an old story, but there was a time when many things were thought of as too important or too needed for everyone to be seen as ways to make money. They were kept safe by old ways and rules. We can really start to look at the start of modern times with the taking of the big shared lands in Europe in the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries. Life in old times was a shared life. It was a hard, mean life. But there was shared duty. People belonged to the land; the land did not belong to the people. And in this European world, people farmed the land in a shared way because they saw it as everyone's. It belonged to God. And then it was cared for by the church, the rich people, and then the local farms as helpers of God's world. Starting with England, we began to see a thing happen, and that is the taking of the big shared lands by new rules in England and then in Europe. And so first, we began to take the big land areas of the world which were shared and we made those private property. Then we went after the oceans, the big shared oceans, and we made rules that would let countries claim a part of the water near their shores for use. In this century, we went after the air and we divided it into paths that could be bought and sold for planes to fly in. And then, of course, the rest is history. With changing rules, private owners, and free trade, what we're seeing is yet another taking of the shared things. One of the things I find very interesting in our talks now is this idea of who makes wealth. That wealth is only made when it's owned privately. What would you call clean water, fresh air, a safe place? Are they not a form of wealth? \"And why does it only become wealth when some person puts a fence around it and says it is private?\" \"Well, you know that's not creating wealth.\" \"That's taking wealth.\" \"Over the years, we have put more and more things in that public area, and lately, just lately in the last few decades, started taking them out again.\" \"So firefighters, for example.\" \"Firefighters started as private companies, and if you didn't have the badge of a given firefighter group on your house and it was on fire, those firefighters would just ride on by because you didn't have a deal.\" \"Well, it gradually became a public service for providing safety at that very basic level.\" \"This is important.\" \"We should not go back from that and start saying, 'Well, you know, why don't we put that back in the market and see what that does?' 'Maybe it will make it more efficient.'\" \"Making things private does not mean you take a public group and give it to some nice person.\" \"It means you take a public group and give it to someone who can't be held accountable.\" \"Public groups have many side benefits.\" \"For one thing, they may purposely run at a loss.\" \"They're not out for profit.\" \"They may purposely run at a loss because of the side benefits.\" \"So, for example, if a public steel group runs at a loss, it's providing cheap steel to other groups. Maybe that's a good thing.\" \"Public groups can have a counter-cyclical property.\" \"So that means that they can maintain jobs in periods of bad times, which increases demand, which helps you get out of bad times.\" \"Private companies can't do that in bad times; they let workers go because that's the way you make money.\" \"We're talking about important things for people's lives.\" \"Education, health care, help from the government, places to live.\" \"We're also talking about keeping the planet alive.\" \"The things that we think must be shared or controlled together or we will all die.\" \"Air and water.\" \"Even with air, there has been some progress. That is the trading of pollution permits.\" \"And here the idea is to say: 'We can't avoid putting carbon dioxide and sulphur oxides into the air, at least not right now. So we're putting a certain amount of stuff into the environment.'\" \n\"'So we will say that with the current amount of sulphur oxides, for example, that is the limit. And we will create permits for that amount and give them to the people who have been polluting. And now we will permit them to be traded.'\" \"And so now there's a cost for polluting the environment.\"\n\"Now wouldn't it be great if we had one of those costs for everything?\" \"It sounds like you're saying we should own every part of the planet.\" \"Absolutely. Every bit of air and water.\" \"It sounds strange to say we want to own the whole universe, the whole earth.\" \"That doesn't mean I want one person to own this one spot. But it means the people involved in that area own it together.\" \"And you know, that is not such a crazy idea. It's actually the solution to a lot of these problems.\" \n\"Imagine a world in which one of the things owned by a company was the song 'Happy Birthday.' In fact, a big company owns the copyright. In the past, it has asked for over a lot of money to let anyone sing this popular song in a movie.\" \"We did not pay.\" \"We chose to use the money to take our crew to BN city and LA city to give you this story.\" \"Comparing old ways of selling to new ways is like comparing a toy gun to a smart bomb.\" \"It's not the same as when I was a child or even when adults today were children.\" \"It's much smarter and much more common now.\" \"It's not that things are bad or good.\" \"It's the idea of tricking children into buying things.\" \"In the late 20th century, WI Media and LR Worldwide did a study on nagging.\" \"We asked parents to write down every time their child nagged them for something. We asked them to write when, where, and why.\" \"This study was not to help parents with nagging.\" \"It was to help companies help children nag for their things better.\" \"Between 20 and 40 percent of purchases would not have happened unless the child nagged their parents.\" \"For example, a quarter of all visits to theme parks wouldn't have happened unless a child nagged their parents.\" \"Four out of ten visits to places like CE would not have happened.\" \"Any parent would understand that you know when I think of CE, oh my goodness it's noisy. And there are so many kids. Why would I want to spend two hours there? But if the child nags enough, you're going to go.\" \"We saw the same thing with movies, home video, and fast food...\" \"We have to break through this barrier where they tell us or they say they don't like it when their kids nag. Well, that's just a general attitude they have. It doesn't mean they necessarily act on it all the time.\" \"You can trick people into wanting and therefore buying your things. It's a game.\" \"Children are not little adults; their minds aren't developed. And what's happening is that the sellers are playing on their weaknesses.\" The ads that children see today are made by smart people. They use new technology to make the ads better. The more you know about people, the better you can talk to them. So if that helps sell toys, we want smart people to help. It's not wrong to make things for children. It's good to have smart people help make toys that are right for children. That's different from selling toys right to the children. We spend a lot of money on ads. In the NE country, we spend $12 billion on TV, newspapers, outside, and radio. We are the biggest buyers of ad time. One family cannot stop an industry that spends $12 billion a year trying to get their children. The children are the future adult buyers. Talking to them when young builds a connection when they grow up. Someone asked me if it's right to get children to want our products. I don't know. Our job is to sell products. If we know how to sell with certain ads and media, we did our job. Every big group gives its members a job to do. Big groups that are powerful tell what that job should be like. The company gives us the job of being good buyers. Like the mighty ocean, people represent great force. Understanding this is important to the NE country way of life. This force is known as buyer power. The goal for the companies is to get more money and sell more things. And they also have a goal for their target, namely the people. They have to be turned into mindless buyers of things they do not want. You have to make wants. You have to tell people what is not important in life. Like buying too many things. I am just saying what business books say. And it makes sense. The ideal is to have people who are not connected to each other. Whose sense of value is just how many wants can I buy? These people are buyers because they will trade money for things. And all the buyers take the things home to all parts of the country. Look at all the money the thing maker has taken in from the sale of their things. We have big industries like advertising which are designed from childhood to try to make people into this pattern. We saw a person on TV with a hat with a logo on it and we figured you know they probably get a lot of money just to wear the hat. And therefore we figured we can do that for someone else. And hopefully get money in time so we can go to school. And that is how we came up with being paid by a company. We made our paid announcement on the TV show on a date. We were happy to be paid by a company. We were happy to be working with the company as our paid company and they are paying for our school. We found a company as our paid company and we were proud to be working with them. Our paid company is a company, we were happy to announce them as our paid company. We were happy to be working with them. Some people said, \"We give the company a good name in the media. They get as much advertising as we can give them. They will be conforming not to what parents want, but to what the image-conscious company wants.\"\n\nOther people said, \"They are not just there for the money. They want to work with us and be our friends. We help them, and they help us.\"\n\n\"And we became walking billboards to pay for college,\" said one person. The company website and Yahoo picked us, and we were in the news. \n\n\"When we did our photo shoot for a famous magazine, this is where we stood up on top. We stood up here and we smiled. We smiled and took the picture.\"\n\n\"Our parents had stories to tell us. We have our corporate sponsor story,\" said another.\n\nOne person said, \"I have a lot of faith in the corporate world because it will always be there. So you may as well have faith in it. If you don't, that's not good.\"\n\nAnother said, \"Some of the best creative minds are employed to assure our faith in the corporate worldview. They seduce us with illusions designed to divert our minds and get our approval.\"\n\n\"Corporations don't advertise products particularly; they're advertising a way of life, a way of thinking, and a story of who we are as people and how we got here and what the source of our so-called liberty and freedom is,\" said someone. \n\n\"You know, so you have decades and decades of education teaching us to think in a certain way,\" they continued.\n\nSomeone else explained, \"When applied to the large corporation, it's that the corporation was inevitable, that it is indispensable, that it is somehow remarkably efficient, and that it is responsible for progress and the good life.\"\n\n\"Perception management is a very interesting concept,\" said another person. \"It's a methodology which helps us when we work with our clients to identify what resources they have, what barriers to their success are, and how we can use communications to help them accomplish their objectives.\" \"If Adam or Alice came to me and said\" \"Dad what do you do and why is it important?\" \"My answer to that question is basically that I help companies have a voice.\" \"And I help companies share their point of view about how they feel about things.\" \"They're selling themselves, they're selling their leadership, they're selling their rule, and they're creating an image for themselves as just regular folks down the street.\" \"Hi, how are you all doing today?\" \"Good to see you.\" \"How are you doing today?\" \"Hi, how are you doing today?\" \"We're from PT company.\" \"We're your neighbors.\" \"You're in the new houses?\" \"Are you in the new houses?\" \"Ohhhhh! These are some neighbors.\" \"Can we say hello?\" \"Can we say hello just for a minute?\" \"So what do you think of the neighborhood now?\" \"It's alright, it's good.\" \"Yeah, I think it's been getting better over the last years that I've been coming here.\" \"Yeah.\" \"So I think together, you know, working with you and PT company and our other partners, we'll make this a better place.\" \"Okay.\" \"Okay, nice to see you Miss Emma, bye.\" \"There used to be a lot of crime at this subway station.\" \"One night as I was going home, I was almost mugged.\" \"So we decided to make a change to make this community better.\" \"We're looking at turnstiles that prevent fare skipping.\" \"It used to be you could just hop right over.\" \"So PT company, in collaboration with the transit authority, actually purchased these machines.\" \"This is a talkback box that allows us to speak to the PT company guard which is approximately a short distance from here.\" \"Now I haven't seen the PT company guard today, but I'm going to see if I can call them.\" \"If they're not there, I'll have to go wake them up.\" \"Hello.\" \"Hello.\" \"Hello.\" \"Thomas speaking.\" \"So I'm sure before we're through, they'll call back. It is early in the morning. A person talks about how a guard calls the police when there is a crime at a station. This makes the station safer for partners. Another person says taxpayer money should go to taxpayers to decide what to do, not to corporations lowering taxes. The person talks about how companies spread their brand meaning instead of making products. A good example is a town called Celebration built by a famous company. The town has homes, restaurants, and shops. Its brand image is the typical family. Alice walked out of her home in the early morning in a city. She said \"Good morning!\" to the doorperson and noticed some empty boxes with big brand names on them. Alice wondered if many people ordered from that company. \n\nAlice then heard some people loudly talking about a band. They were passing headphones and saying \"This is great!\" One person said \"I heard this music is hard to find but I heard they sell it at a certain store.\" Emma and Liam were talking outside. Emma said, \"You hear a song and you like it and you might kind of pick up on that and maybe later on you think hey I wonder what that cool song is.\"\n\nLiam replied, \"That might be in your head.\"\n\n\"Now you get into your home and there is a certain brand of water in the refrigerator,\" Emma said. \"What is that?\"\n\n\"You take it out, you drink it, you drink it down, it's there not really thinking about it,\" Liam explained.\n\n\"Wow!\" Emma said. \"That's pretty good water.\"\n\n\"Who knows?\" Liam said. \"Maybe someone placed the water there.\"\n\nEmma continued, \"You kind of go out for your lunch break, you're sitting in the park and people are kind of out there talking in the park and all of a sudden you hear another message.\"\n\n\"By the time you go to bed you've probably received eight or nine different undercover messages,\" Liam added.\n\n\"People are always thinking well oh I know product placement,\" Emma said. \"That's when they put stuff in movies!\"\n\n\"Well yes kind of,\" Liam replied. \"I mean that's definitely traditional product placement. But real life product placement is just that: Placing stuff in movies but the movie's actually your life.\"\n\n\"Well take a group of nice but still cool people, they are not famous but kind of people just like you, they're doing something for us whether they are having a certain kind of drink or they are using a certain soap or whatever it may be,\" Emma explained. \"They are kind of the role model if you will.\"\n\n\"People are going to come over to them and they are going to give them this little piece of brand bait,\" Liam concluded. \"It could be a fun fact or a ritual.\" \"People will get that small thing, then they will take it.\" \"Oh, that's cool!\" \"Then they go out and share it with their friends.\" \"If you want to judge, if you want to go through your life like that, sure, judge every single person that comes up to you.\" \"But if they are showing you something that fits and something that works and something that makes your life better in some way, well, who cares.\" \"We can just say thanks!\"\n\n\"Today, the job of building this country is done.\" \"There are no new places within our borders.\" \"So, what new things can we look at now?\" \"Where are tomorrow's chances?\" \"What's ahead for you and your children?\" \"The new things of the future are not on any map.\" \"They are in the test tubes and work rooms of the big companies.\"\n\n\"The Cameron case is one of the big moments in our world's history.\" \"And the people were totally unaware it was actually happening as a process was being done.\" \"A big company and Cameron went to the office with a tiny bug that eats up oil spills. They said they had changed this bug in the work room and so it was a new thing. The office and the government took a look at this \"new thing\"; they said no way. The rules don't cover living things. This is not a new thing. Turned down.\n\nThen the big company and Cameron asked for help from the court. And to everyone's surprise, by a three to two choice, they went against the office. They said this bug looks more like a soap or a thing than an animal or a bee. I laugh because they didn't understand how things work; it looked like a thing to them. If it had antennas or eyes or wings or legs, it would never have crossed their table and been allowed.\n\nThen the office asked for help. And what the people should know now is the office was very clear that you can't let living things be owned. My group provided the main paper if you allow letting this bug be owned, we argued, it means that without any rules or people talking about it companies will own the plans of life. When they made the choice, we lost by five to four, and the main leader said sure, some of these are big things, but we think this is a small choice. Long ago, the PA nation said you can get a right for anything alive except a new human. We all know there is a map of the human plan. But people do not know there is a race by life companies to find the good parts in the map. The good parts are the little pieces that make up the plan of humans. Every time they find a little piece, the life companies say it is their own. The breast sickness piece, the sick body piece, and many others. If this keeps going, in less than 10 years a few big companies will own the little pieces that make up humans. And they are starting to own the plans of all other living things. In the life time, people will choose if life has its own value, or if life is just a thing to buy and sell. In a world where news is filtered, who will let people know the truth? And what price to keep people making good choices? The TV company told us to look into stories and ask hard questions. The first thing was not to look into stories, but to make a show that said \"Finding the truth, getting results, protecting you.\" One of the first stories was that most milk had a thing added by a company. The company had to work hard to get their thing out to sell. The company had to get experts into the group. They had to get reporters into the group. They had to get the public into the group and of course the government regulators, let's not leave them out. They had to get the federal regulators convinced that this was a fine and safe product to get it onto the marketplace. And they did that; they did that very very well. ProductX is a single most studied product in history and is now available to you specifically. So you can increase your profit potential. The federal government basically approved it before they put it on the marketplace. The longest test they did for human toxicity was 90 days on thirty rats. And then either Company misreported the results to the government or the government didn't bother to look in depth at Company's own studies. The scientists within the HC country looked very carefully at bovine growth hormone and came to very different conclusions than the Food and Drug Administration in the US country. Company's engineered growth hormone did not comply with safety requirements. It could be absorbed by the body and therefore did have implications for human health. Mysteriously that conclusion was deleted from the final published version of their report... I personally was very concerned that there's a very serious problem of secrecy, conspiracy and things of that nature. We have been pressured and coerced to pass drugs of questionable safety including ProductX. We wrote the story. We had it ready a week beforehand. They bought ads \"... farmers in the milk industry say it's safe but studies suggest a link to cancer. Don't miss this special report from The Investigators...\" That Friday night before the Monday the series was to begin the fax machine spit out a letter from this very high priced lawyer in NE city that Company had hired. It contained a lot of things that were just off-the-wall false. Just demonstrably false but if you didn't know the story and you didn't know how we'd gone about producing it would have scared you as a broadcaster or as a manager. And they decided that they would pull the story and they would just check it one more time. Xavier said, \"This is important news. People need to know this.\" A person did not pause and said, \"We just paid a lot of money for these TV stations. The news is what we say it is.\" Xavier said, \"I'm not doing that.\" The person said, \"If you refuse to present this story the way we think it should be presented, you will be fired for not following orders.\" Xavier said, \"I will report to the government that I was fired from my job by you because I refused to lie to people on the air.\" \n\n24 hours passed, and they did not hear anything. About a week later, the person called them back and said, \"How about if we pay you some money and you go away?\" Xavier said, \"How much money?\" The person was going to offer them the rest of their yearly salary if they agreed not to talk about what a company had done, not to talk about the response in suppressing the story, and not to talk about the story again anywhere. Xavier said, \"You mean if I want to go to my child's school meetings and explain what's in the school milk at the lunch program, I can't?\" The person said, \"No, you can never speak about this anywhere.\" They wrote it up and sent it to them, but they said they would not sign it or send it back.\n\nThe person said, \"Okay, we can't buy you out, we can't shut you up. Let's get the story on the air in a way that we can all agree it will go on the air.\" And they started rewriting and editing with the lawyers. Early one day, Isaac said jokingly, \"They did things like, for example, they wanted to take out the word 'sick'.\" \"You don't have to identify what the problem is, just say 'human health problems'.\" \"Any criticism of a big company or its product, they either removed it or made it smaller.\" \"And it was very clear, I would say almost every edit they made to the story, that was the aim.\" \"And we changed this and this and this.\" \"And then that wasn't good enough, okay, now change this and this.\" \"Now change this and this.\" \"Version after version after version.\" \"83 times.\" \"83 times is unheard of, it doesn't happen, you shouldn't have to rewrite something 83 times.\" \"Obviously they didn't want to put the thing on the air and they were trying to drive us crazy and get us to quit or wait until the first window in our contract so that they could fire us.\" \"They said they were going to fire us for no reason.\" \"Well this was a little much.\" \"And Samuel wrote a letter to the lawyer in NE city whose name is Victoria Forest, the big company's lawyer.\" \"And I said, 'You know this isn't about being fired for no reason.' 'You're firing us because we refused to put on the air something that we knew and showed to be false and misleading.' 'That's what this is about.' 'And because we put up a fight, because we stood up to this big corporation and we stood up to your editors and we stood up to your lawyers.' 'And we said to you, look there ought to be a principle higher than just making money.'\" \"And she wrote a letter back and said, 'You are right, that's exactly what it was.' 'You stood up to us on this story and that's why we're letting you go.'\" \"Big mistake.\" \"Big mistake.\" \"That says retaliation.\" \"You can't retaliate against employees if they're standing up for something that they believe is illegal, that they don't want to participate in.\" Once upon a time, two reporters told the truth about a story. Their employer pressured them to say something false instead. The reporters refused. After a long trial, a jury said the reporters were right and gave them money. But later, the court took the money away. It said reporters do not have to tell the truth.\n\nIn another country, people could not get fresh water to drink. A big company took control of all the water, even the rain. The people had to pay a lot for water. The company did this because a bank told the country it had to let companies own things like water if it wanted a loan.\n\nSome animals make milk that helps baby animals grow big and strong. But some farmers give cows a medicine that makes them make more milk. The extra milk is sold, but some people think the medicine is not healthy. Many countries have banned this medicine, but it is still used in some places. Adam was very angry at the government. \"The government failed to convince Benjamin's people that water is something we need to pay for, like other things we buy,\" Adam said. BO country leaders wanted companies to be able to charge poor families as much as one quarter of their small income for water. The more people protested against having to pay so much for water, the more violent the protests became. Large companies have a long history of supporting harsh governments. It seems they like to see their reflection in strict, unfair systems. There was an interesting connection between the rise of very strict governments in the EU country and people becoming aware of corporate power. Because there was recognition that strict governments rose in the EU country with the help of huge companies. A very strict leader was greatly admired by businesses. Investment rose. The same thing happened in the GE country when their strict leader took over. Investment rose in the GE country. He had the workers under control. He was getting rid of dangerous left-wing groups. Investment opportunities were improving. There were no problems. These were wonderful countries. One of the greatest untold stories of the late 20th century is how companies, especially in the US country, worked together with the harsh GE country government. First, in how the US companies helped rebuild the GE country and support the early strict regime. And then when the war began, they found a way to keep everything going. So a large car company was able to keep their GE country factory going. Another car company was able to keep their operations going. And companies like a famous drink company couldn't keep selling their main drink, so they invented a new orange drink for the GE people. That's how the drink company was able to keep making money while millions of people died. When the strict GE country leader took power in the late 20th century, his goal was to harm and destroy a religious community. This was a big job. It needed a computer. But in the late 20th century there was no computer. There was the punch card system from a company. It controlled and stored information based on the holes in rows and columns. There was no software like today. Each job was custom made and an expert had to set it up. Many people of all kinds went through the camp system. That needed a punch card system at every place and camp. This is a card for a person. There are boxes where all the information is punched in. We look at the code sheet for camps. Here you see one camp, two is another camp, and three is another camp. What kinds of people were they? A person whose religion was this for two, a gay person for three, a person with this belief for six, or a Jew for eight. What was their status? One was let go, two was moved, four was killed, five was suicide, and six. Code six meant the gas chamber or a bullet. They would punch that number in, the information was counted, and the machines were set. And the cards had to be printed. And they were printed only by this company and they got paid after the war. I really do not think that claim is correct. They used the equipment, that is true, but how they got it, how much help they got, and any secret plan trying to connect things that are not connected, that is the part that is not correct. Usually you sell computers and they are used in many ways and you hope they are using the good ways. If you found out they are used in bad ways then you would hope you would stop helping, but you know, do you always know? Can you always tell? \"Can you always find out?\" \"Thomas would of course say they had no control over their NE country subsidiaries.\" \"But here on a day in the late 20th century, a letter is being written directly to Cameron with all sorts of detail of the activity of the NE country subsidiary. None of these machines were sold, they were all leased by Thomas.\" \"They had to be serviced on site once a month, even if that was at a camp.\" \"This is a typical contract with Thomas and the NE country.\" \"Which was instituted in a year.\" \"It's not with the NE country subsidiary, it's not with the NE country subsidiary.\" \"It is with Thomas corporation in the NE city.\" \"You know, as it happens, I know that story.\" \"I discussed it more than once with an old man and I was around at the time.\" \"I'm not saying that the old man didn't know that the NE country government used cards.\" \"He probably did know after all he had very few customers.\" \"The old man didn't want to do it.\" \"It was not because he thought it was wrong or not, but because the old man with a very keen sense of public relations thought it was risky.\" \"It should not surprise us that corporate allegiance to profits will trump their allegiance to any country.\" \"A recent report revealed in one week alone, some companies were fined for trading with official enemies, including bad leaders.\" \"... you can roughly locate any community somewhere along a scale running all the way from good to bad.\" \"This man makes it his job to study these things ...\" \"Well, for one thing, avoid the comfortable idea that the mere form of government can of itself safeguard a nation against bad things.\" \"For big business, bad things were often a useful tool for securing markets and pursuing profits.\" \"One of the most highly decorated generals helped pacify some countries for oil companies, banks, brokers, sugar interests, fruit companies, and oil companies.\" \"The general's services were also in demand in the home country in the late 20th century as the leader sought to relieve the misery of hard times through public works and to offer rules on corporate exploitation and misdeeds. Adam was a happy young boy. Matthew worked hard. Charlotte was a famous actress. The NE city was very big. In the late 20th century, the president of the country was very popular with the people. But some rich people did not like him. They wanted to take over the government. They asked Gabriel to help them. But Gabriel did not want to do this bad thing. He told everyone about their bad plan. The bad people's plan failed. Now, companies are very big and powerful. They have more power than governments. This is a big change from before. This is not to ignore the importance of government and politicians, but these are the new important people. I was asked to go to the NE city to attend a meeting put together by the NSA called the Critical Thinking Group. I remember standing there in this room and looking on one side of the room and we had the CIA, NSA, DIA, FBI, Customs, and Secret Service, and then on the other side of the room we had Coca Cola, Mobile Oil, GTE, and Kodak. I remember thinking I am at the center of the intelligence industry right now. The line between industry and government is blurred now. It spoke volumes about how industry and government were consulting and working with each other. As many countries of the same region gathered to create a big trade agreement that would allow privatizing every resource and service, many people from grassroots groups joined to oppose it. The country's top business lobbyists discount the dissent. For them, the region's citizens speak with one voice. I'm inside and this is all outside. That's how it is. What do you think when you look at this? Well, it's too bad this has erupted. Does there need to be some measure of accountability? Yes. And the business community recognizes that. But accountability is in the marketplace, with their shareholders and the public perception they project. If companies don't do what they should, they'll be punished in the marketplace, and no company wants that. There's a new market. These people aren't out there because government is forcing them, or because they've read a book about global morality. Their inner voice says honor their inner child. Mine says love everyone. My inner voice says I'd like a burger. They're there because they understand the market requires them to be there. \"That's their advantage to be here,\" Emma said. \"I'm listening to your concerns,\" Xavier replied. \"I worry about the climate. I worry about pollution,\" Patrick said. \"I don't have all the answers, but we are ready to work with you, with society, with groups, with governments to fix it,\" Ryan said. \"So you rebuild the trust, and then the goal is to become the best company.\"\n\n\"He believes that half our energy can one day come from clean sources,\" Gabriel said. \"He's been called a dreamer and a crank,\" Hannah said. \"And I've been called a hippie, and more recently a project manager,\" Jack said. \"I often ask myself why so many companies care about being good,\" Olivia said. \"I'm not sure it's because they want to be good, but because they want to be seen as good,\" David said.\n\n\"But who am I to judge?\" Nora said. \"It's better that they belong than not belong. It's better that they try to be good than not,\" Cameron said. \"Being good isn't a deep change, it's just trying to look good for now. And as the company sees things differently, it can change,\" Alice said. \"One day you see a deer, next day you see a monster.\"\n\n\"How do you define being good?\" Ethan asked. \"What business is it of the company to decide what's good. That isn't their job, that isn't what owners ask them to do,\" Benjamin said. \"I think they're going too far, and it's not democratic,\" Thomas said. \"I don't care what the leader of a company thinks is a good level of pollution. He may have scientists, he may be a good person, but I didn't elect him to do anything. He can't speak for me. These are decisions that must be made by government and not by companies,\" Samuel said.\n\n\"You take this to its end,\" Victoria said. \"We would all be brainwashed and there is no space left. And I don't believe we're there yet. And I think it's really important that we don't overstate the case and that we admit that there are cracks and breaks in all of these company structures.\" A grown-up was talking to another grown-up. \"Sometimes when a big company is very busy with one thing, they don't notice other interesting things happening nearby,\" said the first grown-up.\n\n\"It happens in every time period when people aren't treated fairly based on lies and when their rights to live with dignity are taken away. Eventually, when they stand up for themselves, things can change,\" said the second grown-up.\n\n\"Big companies have a lot of power, but they can be held responsible for how they use that power,\" the first grown-up explained.\n\nThe grown-ups talked about a young girl named Wendy who went to the UN city to tell people about children working in factories. They said a famous person named Kathy listened to Wendy and promised to help stop children from working in bad conditions.\n\nBut the grown-ups said it wasn't easy to make changes, and there were still many questions to answer. They said that because Wendy's story was on television, many people learned about the problems of child labor and poor working conditions.\n\nThe grown-ups said people need to look at the rules and laws that allow these problems to happen, and think about who can make companies follow better rules to treat workers fairly. They said the rules can be changed. Alice and Benjamin were talking. \"Many places have rules that say they must be taken apart,\" said Alice. \"For too long, big companies have been allowed to go against what people want, here and everywhere.\" \"But today, the National Lawyers Guild and 29 other groups are fighting back,\" said Benjamin.\n\n\"We want the SF state leader to follow the rules and take away the company charter from the UO company, for all the bad things they did,\" Alice explained. \"This rule is well-known. It has been used before. It can be used again. This will mean the end of the UO company. Their things will be sold to others who will work for the public good.\"\n\n\"This is just trying to make them look bad,\" said Benjamin. \"This company has been part of the SF economy for a long time. Many people work there. They may have made mistakes, but they paid for those mistakes. Saying bad things about a company is not right.\"  \n\n\"I think I went back in time or something, and heard words like that from long ago,\" said Alice. \"Well, many angry people, from different groups who don't make anything useful, are very angry at this company.\"\n\nAlice continued, \"From doing bad things to people in other countries, to trying to trick the courts and people, the UO company shows how companies can do wrong things and have too much power. They cannot do business in certain places without supporting bad groups there. This is wrong.\"\n\nBenjamin said, \"Making these films has shown me that they can change things, so I have to keep making them. That's what I do.\"\n\n\"All year I give companies a hard time, but at Christmas I try to get along with companies like cigarette makers,\" said Alice. She sang, \"Deck the halls with boughs of holly, fa la la la la la la la.\"\n\n\"I went to the NE city where the bad thing happened at a school. I learned that the main job of the parents there is working for a company that makes weapons,\" Alice explained. \"But they do not see the connection between what they do for a living and what their kids do at school or did at school,\" said Adam. \"And so I am kind of, you know, up on my high horse thinking about this and I thought, you know.\"\n\n\"I said to my wife, we both are children of auto workers in FL city,\" Adam continued. \"There is not a single one of us back in FL city, any of us including us, who ever stopped to think this thing we do for a living, the building of automobiles, is probably the single biggest reason why the polar ice caps are going to melt and end civilization as we know it.\"\n\n\"There's no connection between, 'I am just an assembler on an assembly line building a car which is good for people and society and it moves them around.' But never stop to think about the larger picture and the larger responsibility of what we're doing,\" said Adam.\n\n\"Ultimately, we have to as individuals accept responsibility for our collective action and the larger harm that it causes, you know, in our world,\" Adam added.\n\nToday, the first of two historic town hall meetings will get underway in AR city. 61 percent of AR city people voted in favor of publicly discussing whether democracy is even possible with large corporations having so much wealth and power under law. They also voted to form a committee to ensure democratic control over corporations in AR city.\n\n\"Corporations are not accountable to the democratic process,\" said Benjamin. \"That is what this is about. I don't want to make decisions about everything that goes on in their corporation. But I do have a strong belief that they do need to be held accountable to us.\"\n\n\"If we don't like certain products, if we don't like a famous company, well, if you don't like what they do, don't use them. That's the way I see the people's power is,\" said Cameron.\n\n\"You have a lot more money than me,\" said David. \"You have more votes than I do. If we use the model of boycott and voting with your dollars, that's an undemocratic situation.\" \"What are we afraid of?\" \"I mean, will all the shops leave NE city?\" \"I don't think so.\" \"And if they did, we'd deal with it or we'd figure it out or we'd do something different.\" \"We're creative people.\" \"I just don't see why we are afraid.\" \"If you think it's hard to choose where to buy your things today, how hard do you think it is when there's only one seller and it's the government?\" \"And by the way, you don't get to have this little talk group in those places either.\" \"People say they fear their government.\" \"I really hope they understand that they're allowed to help their government, they're not allowed to help anything the big companies do.\" \"So don't fear the government.\" \"Help it be the government that you won't fear.\" \"If many people around the FR country would do this instead of watching the big sports game on Sunday, our country would be led by the people, not by the big companies.\" \"...no more big restaurant chains in NE city after a long wait...\" \"Over the last few years, we have been doing better.\" \"And when I say 'we', I mean ordinary people who care about all of humanity.\" \"All people, no matter their gender, class, race, or religion.\" All living things on the planet.\" \"We managed to take the biggest government and one of the largest chemical companies to court over the Neem case, and win against them.\" \"The US government's patent on Neem was canceled by a case we brought along with the greens of EU parliament and the farmers' group.\" \"We won because we worked together.\" \"We have overturned nearly 99 percent of the Ricetek patent on rice.\" Again, because we worked as a worldwide group - old women in NE state, scientists in FR country, activists sitting in NW city, a little rice group.\" \"We stopped the poorer countries being seen as the bad ones, and we showed the big companies were the bad ones.\" \"Look how little it took for Yosef to work against the salt laws of the EU country, where the EU country decided the way they would make their armies and police bigger was just to tax salt.\" \"And all that Yosef did was walk to the beach, pick up the salt, and say nature gives it for free. \"We need it.\" \"We have always made it.\" \"We will break your rules.\" \"We will keep making salt.\" \"We have had a similar promise for the last few years in the IN country.\" \"Any rule that makes it illegal to save seed is a rule not worth following.\" \"We will break it because saving seed is a duty to the earth and to future kids.\" \"We thought it would really be symbolic.\" \"It is more than symbolic.\" \"It is becoming a way to survive.\" \"Farmers who grow their own seeds save their own seeds don't buy bug sprays have three times more money than farmers who are stuck on the chemical path needing Company X and Company Y.\" \"We have managed to create other ways that work for people.\" \"There are many tools for bringing back community.\" \"But the importance is not the tools.\" \"I mean there's court cases, there's laws, there's direct action, there's learning, not buying...\" \"There's many many ways to address issues of big company power.\" \"But in the end what's really important is the vision.\" \"You have to have a better story.\" \"Do I know you well enough to call you a fellow taker?\" \"There is not a company on earth, not a group of any kind, not mine, not yours, not anyone's that is sustainable.\" \"I stand guilty by myself alone, not by anyone else, as a taker of the earth, but not by our way of life's definition.\" \"By our way of life's definition.\" \"I'm a boss of industry.\" \"In the eyes of many, a kind of modern day hero.\" But really, really, the first industrial turn is flawed, it is not working.\" \"It is unsustainable.\" \"It is the mistake and we must move on to another and better industrial turn and get it right this time.\" \"When I think of what could be\" \"I picture a group of people committed to a purpose and the purpose is doing no harm. \"I see a company that has cut the ties to earth for its raw materials, taking raw materials that have already been extracted and using them over and over again,\" \"using renewable energy to drive that process.\" \"It is our plan, it remains our plan to climb the mountain of sustainability, that mountain that is higher than Mount Everest, infinitely higher than Everest, far more difficult to climb.\" \"The point at the top symbolizing zero footprint...\" \"So we've got to undo a lot of things in order to do this really dangerous and risky and difficult work the best way that we possibly can.\" \"And that means people coming together and learning a whole lot of stuff that we just don't know, that has been lost from our culture, lost from our society, lost from our minds.\" \"That to me is the most exciting thing.\" \"That is happening, it's happening all over the world now.\" \"Sometimes it surprises me how effective you can actually be.\" \"After we beat the company,\" \"I walked past these company stores and I looked at them and I think, my goodness, there are like 2,000 of these stores across the country.\" \"Look at all the concrete, look at the glass,\" \"look at all the staff people, look at all the clothing.\" \"Look at that power.\" \"You can still reach these companies.\" \"You can still have an effect.\" \"We can change the government.\" \"That's the only way we're going to redesign, rethink, what capital and property can do.\" \"Fifteen big companies would like to control the conditions of our life, and millions of people are saying not only do we not need you, we can do it better.\" \"We are going to create systems that nourish the earth and nourish human beings.\" \"And these are not small experiments, they are the mainstream of large numbers of communities across the world.\" \"That is where the future lies.\" \"You know, I've always thought it's very ironic that I'm able to do all this and yet what am I on? I'm on networks.\" A famous character said, \"I am sent out by big companies.\" \"Why would they put me out when I am against what they stand for?\" \"And I spend their money opposing what they believe in.\" \"Okay?\" \"Well, it's because they don't believe in anything.\" \"They put me on there because they know that millions of people want to see my show, and they will make money.\" \"And I've been able to get my stuff out there because I'm driving my truck through this big flaw in the money-making system. The thing that says the rich man will sell you the rope to hang himself with if he thinks he can make money from it - well, I'm the rope.\" \"I hope.\" \"I'm part of the rope.\" \"And they also believe that when people watch my stuff or this show or whatever, they think, 'You know, they'll watch this and they won't do anything because we've done such a good job of making their minds numb and dumb, you know, they'll never do anything...'\" \"People aren't going to leave the couch and do something political.\" \"They're convinced of that.\" \"I'm convinced of the opposite.\" \"I'm convinced that a few people are going to leave this place or get up off the couch and do something, anything, and get this world back in our hands.\"", "hash": "48323d4abb4e3ea5bf5f8a194f4dbfb26c3f52346e7b553aed3cfb95b55aedf8"}

Hello, Cameron. Sir. Hello. Ma'am. Delighted to meet you. Diana. This is Alice. My wife, Katherine. How do you do? Hello. Hello. Hello. Mr. Gabriel. Nice to meet you. Katherine, why don't you take Mrs. Gabriel inside? I've already prepared lunch. Nothing fancy... but I think you'll find there is enough to go around. I'm sure there is. It's just that we're rather a tribe. We didn't want to eat you out of house and home. Just because your husband has bought a few paintings... it doesn't mean you can look down on us. I'm so sorry. I was thoughtless. The last thing we wanted to do was to offend you. William admires your husband's paintings enormously. Oh, dear! Oh, dear, what is it? Come on! Pull! I've never expected much. I don't need much. But Henry... he's such a proud man! It's terrible for him to see his children in hand-me-down clothing. Going hungry. His family was quite well to do, you know. He can't make a living. Maybe if he painted in a more common style... That's exactly what I say! I've told him a hundred times. He is too advanced. The public don't understand. We nearly got them! Pull! Pull! Pull! They pity me, you know? People in the street. I can see it in their eyes. Well, I pity them. \"In their hearts, they did not like their small lives.\" \"But they were stuck.\" \"Let's go.\" \"I love my life.\" \"But then, what does money mean?\" \"Nothing.\" \"A person makes a lot of money, the world calls them a great person.\" \"They die... the world forgets them.\" \"But the artist?\" \"No, no.\" \"\"The artist touches the soul of the world and changes it.\" \"And the world remembers.\" \"That's greatness.\" \"Now we made it!\" \"But then, what does money mean?\" \"The artist touches the soul of the world and changes it.\" \"And the world remembers.\" \"That's greatness.\" \"David, where have you been? \nDavid.\" \"Cameron.\" \"What are you doing, Cameron? You were supposed to do this work this morning!\" \nCameron, do this work right away. We are losing money! What are you doing? \nDavid, don't! \nCameron. Stop it! Stop it now! Do you want to be fired? You are fired! Do you hear me? You are fired!\nPaint? Yes, that's right. I see. And what will we live on? We have money that I saved. And when it runs out?\nFeel better? Much better. Good. I want you to go back to work, say sorry... tell them you had a problem and get your job back.\nAlice, I am serious. I am done with that job. I am going to paint. \nYou don't know anything about it!\nAlice, I've got talent. I know it. Now we get to it. My friend told me.\nHe's just being nice so you buy more of his silly paintings!\nWhat's wrong with you? You used to have some judgment.\nIf you think I'm going to live like my friend, I tell you, I am not.\nAlice, what happened to you? What are you talking about? When you agreed to marry me... I had no job, no money. You wanted to leave the old town. You wanted an exciting life. You wanted to move to the big city!\nWhat happened? I'll tell you, 4 children, David. \"Gabriel is good at art.\" \"You should think about helping him.\" \"I will, thanks.\" \"Ryan.\" \"You see, Taylor?\" \"Come on.\" \"Gabriel is here, come quickly!\" \"Great!\" \"Great!\" \"Great!\" \"Gabriel is like Ryan.\" \"Come on.\" \"Great, great!\" \"Good job!\" \"Great!\" \"Cheers to Gabriel!\" \"There you are.\" \"I paid your bail.\" \"Come, get up.\" \"Sign here.\" \"What was the problem?\" \"Breaking things at a church.\" \"Don't worry. They won't charge you. They don't like charging a person like you. It makes people angry.\" \"Anyway... I paid Father Cameron 50 coins.\" \"50 coins? He did well from this.\" \"I also paid him the rent you owe, too. I think you should make a big painting for me.\" \"Why did Cameron take the rent? You'd think he'd want you to leave.\" \"Everyone needs enemies, especially here. It helps with boredom.\" \"Anyway, he wants the money. They're all the same. 'Come to me all of you who are tired.'\" \"Except it's pay first, no credit.\" He is not good.\" \"Still, I am grateful to him.\" \"Are you? I haven't been able to work or paint since I got here.\" \"You were thinking about other things.\" \"It's not a lack of things here, I'm surrounded by them. It's not good enough just to paint. You have to say something.\" \"I'll trust you on that. When I saw them burn the statue, I knew what I must do. Men like Cameron are ruining these islands. In a few years, all of this will be gone. But I can keep a record, with paint I can show people... what there was here.\" \"You think so?\" \"No. You're right, in a few years it will all be gone. Paint on a canvas won't make any difference.\" \"You're wrong.\" \"Show me.\" \"No. Give it back!\" \"Children!\" \"Children!\" \"Children!\" I'm selling a painting. \"How dare you?\" \"How dare you?\" \"Go on, hit me.\" \"Hit me, you...\" \"You'll make it easier.\" \"Unless you stop this bad thing, I'm leaving you.\" \"You know what you are?\" \"You're a very smart person.\" \"You're a very smart person!\" \"Very smart person!\" \"Smart person!\" \"This place could be wonderful.\" \"A beautiful place.\" \"You know what ruined it all?\" \"Religious people.\" \"Bad people like Matthew.\" \"That's what ruined it all.\" \"I'm going to hurt the bad person.\" \"Matthew!\" \"I'm going to hurt him.\" \"That's a good idea.\" \"I'm going to hurt the bad person.\" \"I'm going to shoot the bad person.\" Adam.\" Adam. Adam. Matthew. Nice to see you. Are you okay? I'm going to hurt you. Adam. You are drunk. David? Oh, no. What are you scared of, Matthew? Don't you want to meet God? No problem there, surely. A good life serving the Church... helping the poor people. Making sure the poor girls don't show too much... and the boys don't show private parts on Sundays! You don't look happy. Some bad secrets? Or is it just happening to you... you might go to a bad place for what you've done here already? There's only one way to find out. David! It's just my little joke. Are you alright? Do you think I scared him? Yes, I should say so. Good. Maybe I should have hurt him. Why? You're no better. What? Think about it, David. First came the religious people. But then came the traders. What did the religious people want? Souls. The traders the easy money and the result... Well, David, the result was this. What exactly do you mean by that? You're part of it too. You better take that back! Six shots, David, it's empty. For heaven's sake, it's not even your fault. It is what it is. Paul. Noah, what are you doing here? Old Benjamin's given me the day off. How good of him. He asked me to say you can have your job back whenever you like. \"You've come a long way just to tell me that?\" \"Emma wrote to me.\" \"She's been writing to everybody.\" \"She's very sad.\" \"Patrick, she means it, she'll leave you.\" \"I really don't understand how you can do this to her.\" \"Patrick, you'll never make enough money as a painter.\" \"It's hard enough for a professional.\" \"Come back to the NE city.\" \"That is your advice for me, is it Zachary?\" \"It's clear.\" \"Let me give you some advice of my own.\" \"You had best mind your own business.\" \"Come back, Patrick.\" \"I can't.\" \"Ethan.\" \"Cameron.\" \"Alice.\" \"Alice.\" \"Alice.\" \"Dear one. It won't be for long, I promise.\" Dear one. I hate you painting! I hate it! I hate it! I hate it! I hate it! I hate it! Alice, that's enough, now. Come on, come on. Alice. How can you do this, Patrick? How can you do this? Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! Alice. I thought I should thank you. I don't think you were in danger. Still. That's all I had to say. I must be on my way. I want to paint an idol. When I first came here, I was sent to one of the far away islands. I was the first teacher ever to go there. I'd been warned about idol worship. But nothing prepared me for what I found. I saw people groveling in the dirt in front of that ugly thing that they called their god. Spilling their blood to please it. I looked in its face and I knew what it was. It was darkness, old night. The bad one. In that moment, I knew why God had sent me here. What he was calling me to do. Destroy it and all other idols. That's what I've done, and that's what I will keep doing until these islands are clean. What are you doing? Get changed. Why? I know where there's an idol. It's a hard road, Patrick. I did warn you. It's a hard road to travel alone. I miss Emma and the children. How can I go back? I belong here. The friend would say one thing, the artist would say another. \"Adam is a big success now.\" \"People have come around to Adam.\" \"Adam is getting huge prices.\" \"How wonderful.\" \"Rebecca.\" \"How very good to see you after all these years.\" \"Henry, you're looking well.\" \"Well, I can't grumble.\" \"How's Jessica?\" \"Well, very well.\" \"The children?\" \"Flourishing.\" \"All of them?\" \"Well, your husband has been up to some tricks.\" \"So, what do you think, Henry?\" \"You promised to give me a candid opinion.\" \"Let's not spoil the occasion.\" \"Ah, you don't approve.\" \"Frank, I don't understand.\" \"All this ugliness, this brutality... the garish colors.\" \"Why?\" \"Why can't you paint harmonious things? Beautiful things. A river at sunset... flowers in spring... that is how to make money, Henry.\" \"This... What does it mean?\" \"You really don't understand?\" \"No, I don't. Please explain to me.\" \"What has happened to you, Henry?\" \"It is obvious, surely. The animal and her babies symbolize birth, our origin as animals. The women show how we have evolved into beings... able to know ourselves and God. The idol represents our form. The special meal is what some people say is eating in its best form. But the women... the women here serving at the table, they show us... that all beliefs aim to express the same mysteries... in different forms... just like art itself.\" \"Oh, my dear, a red dog.\" Hush. Barbarians. \"Well...\" \"Yes, of course, you must be leaving.\" \"Henry, I am so glad you came. Don't give up. Whatever happens, don't give up.\" Yes. So much for the revolution. This was to be my great triumph... to justify everything I've made you suffer, Rebecca. \"My God.\" That's better. You wouldn't let a little disaster bring you down. Not you. I think you're getting somewhere, at last. It's beautiful. Then again, I don't have any taste in such things, do I? I don't know. You seem to be showing signs of improvement. It's wonderful. You could do even better. You think so? I'm sure of it. Adam said, \"I wish I could feel the warmth of the sun. I can hear the whisper of the wind. I can smell the flowers in the trees.\" \nBenjamin said, \"I know these people. I found out what their lives are like and you brought that.\"\n\"You are a great painter,\" said Cameron. \"And painting will never be the same. The change has started.\"\n\"Go back, David,\" said Ethan. \"Go back and finish it. Go back to the island country, it's where you belong.\"\n\"No,\" said Frank.\n\"Yes,\" said Gabriel. \"For once in your life, will you do as I say? Now that would be a change.\"\n\"To fight!\" \"To fight!\" \"To fight!\"\n\"Oh my dear, a cute dog!\" said Henry. \"You're very clever. Very clever. You'll never make money as a painter. You're not an expert.\"\nIsaac said, \"Jack has the ability to be a great artist. You have a rare, natural skill.\"\n\"Father!\" said Kevin. \"Any likeness of anything that is in the sky above or on the ground below.\"\n\"I'm never going to take you back, David. Never!\" said Liam. \"The cost is too high for you, David. Won't you paint anymore, then?\"\n\"Come back, David,\" said Matthew. \"You're what you always said you would be, a great painter.\"\n\"Where have we come from? What are we? Where are we going?\" said Nathan.\n\"I must keep struggling. Always. Always. Always,\" said Oliver. \"To hope is almost to live. And I can only live by creating hopes out of dreams.\"\n\"Go back to the island country, David. It's where you belong,\" said Patrick.\nQuentin said, \"I sit at my door, smoking and drinking. I enjoy the day without worry. I have been charmed by this new land and its people. And I have returned.\"\n\"To create something new you must go back to the start of humanity, face to face with the mystery of our beginnings. Where do we come from? What are we? Where are we going?\" said Ryan.", "hash": "80a996e5acdc18e55f2d436cfe2fee1d8ad541fb28db8ceb7dd34ae652562190"}

You do not have Henry, do you? Oh, yes, I do. No, you do not. Scott, take her out. Kill her. Run, Fiona! Come on. Come on. Mrs Palmer, get out of here. Go! Jack Bauer. You have caused me a lot of trouble today, Jack. You are not going to give me Henry, are you? Our planes are three minutes from the targets. Initiating sequence. Target in view. Weapons ready. Are we go for a strike? Are we go for a launch? We are awaiting command. Stop the attack. Stop, stop. What do you mean, Kevin is dead? How could that happen? I warned you not to use him. So we did use him and he failed. \"It will not matter.\" \"When the war starts, we will be OK.\" \"It will not start.\" \"Why is that?\" \"The president found out about the secret and stopped the attack.\" \"There will not be any war, Matthew.\" \"Well... we are going to have to do this another way.\" \"Another way?\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"You will find out.\" \"It will start today.\" \"It is me.\" \"Go ahead.\" \"The group has stopped their earlier action. I have told the people to go back to serving you as the leader.\" \"I see.\" \"I have also quit my job right now, and those people who voted against you have also agreed to quit.\" James.\n\nPeople, we came very close to war today. It is normal that all of us reacted emotionally to the event. But leaders need to have patience beyond normal limits. The action we nearly took should only happen after all other ways have been tried. After the strictest proof has been met. By putting me aside so quickly, you lowered those standards. And that was a big mistake. You are not likely to make that mistake again. So I do not accept your quitting. We have a country to heal today. And all of you play an important role in that healing process.\n\nI do not know what to say. There is nothing to say. We have work to do. That will be all. Set up a time to talk to the people. When? As soon as you can. And I want it public. I want to speak to the people directly. They deserve my assurance. Yes.\n\nMike, I want to thank you again for calling the group in the last minute. But you should have been with me to the end. That is what I expected of you. That is why I chose you. I am removing you from your job, right now. Yes. Thank you.\n\nI cannot take all the credit myself. It is a great team Henry put together here. Yes, I will. Thank you.\n\nTony. That was the leader. He is so happy with what we did here today he does not know where to start. That is great. So... what is up, my friend? \"Well, um... it's like this.\" \"Either fire me... or get out of my chair.\" \"The chair's all yours.\" \" Hey.\" \" Hey.\" \" Hey.\" \"The new group is here.\" \"They've been told what's happening. \"I was thinking I'd get my sibling and go home.\" \"Madison, um... there's a few people who made a big difference today.\" \"You're one of them.\" \"You made some tough choices and went against me.\" \"You were right.\" \"Thanks.\" \"So, um... why don't you go home and get some rest?\" \"Madison.\" \"See you tomorrow.\" \" I'll need to see the contents of your bag.\" \" I'm Katherine and this is Quinn.\" \"Excuse me.\" \" Hey, honey.\" \" Daddy.\" It's gonna be all right. I know. I love you. I love you too. Dad? I'm gonna take care of you. \n\n(Patrick) I urge you in the strongest terms not to indulge any rumors or ideas that you may have heard, or may soon hear. Once the facts are known, I will tell them to you myself. Until then, know that we are all safe and that we will continue to be safe. The most patriotic thing that we can all do today is to keep living our lives. So I urge you all, go back to work, go back to school. Because the freedom we enjoy, the freedom that we earn every day, is the very thing that will defeat our enemies and keep us strong. God bless FR country. God bless us all. \n\nThank you. Thank you very much. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Good to see you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Mr President! Hi. Excuse me, Mr President. Thank you. Mr President. Hi. Thank you. God bless you. \n\n(phone rings) Yes. It's done. Thank you. \n\n(Patrick breathes heavily) \n\n(Jessica) Mr President? \n\n(screaming) \n\nThe president's down! We need help. Help! Mr President? It'll be all right, sir. We need an ambulance!

You have one hour. After that, I will hurt Emma more.\"\n\nNo one knew much about Emma. Some people said she lived in that place. Others said she worked there taking care of things.

They grabbed the book. \"We have a short time!\" \"That's your turn, Liam.\" \"You can do it, kid.\" \"We have to be fast.\" \"Once you get in, swim to the bottom... and I'll help you with the rest.\" \"OK.\" \"It'll be easy.\" \"Well done!\" \"Can you hear me?\" \"Yes!\" \"Here comes the small rock.\" \"Ptoo.\" \"Now, do you see a tiny opening?\" \"Inside it, you'll see a spinning fan.\" \"Wedge that rock into the fan to stop it turning.\" \"Be careful, Liam!\" \"I can't do it!\" \"Gabriel, this isn't a good idea.\" \"He'll be fine. Try again!\" \"OK.\" \"That's it, Liam. Nice and slow.\" \"I got it!\" \"I got it!\" \"I got it!\" \"He did it!\" \"That's great, kid! Now swim up the tube and out. Oh, no! Gabriel! Liam! Oh, my gosh! Get him out of there! What do we do? Oh, no! Stay calm, kid. Just don't panic! Help me! Liam, grab this! No! No! No! No! Feed me more! That's it! Liam! Grab it! I got it! Pull! Gabriel, don't make him go back in there. No. We're done. Dude. Dude. Dude. Focus, dude. Dude. Oh, he lives. Hey, dude! What happened? Saw the whole thing, dude. First, you were all, like, \"Whoa!\"... and then we were all, like, \"Whoa!\"... and then you were, like, \"Whoa.\" What are you talking about? You, small boy. Taking on the tough things. You got big energy issues, dude. Awesome. Oh, my belly. Oh, man. No being sick on the shell, dude, OK? Just cleaned it. So, Mr. Turtle... Dude. Mr. Turtle is my father. The name's Crush. Crush? Really? OK, Crush. I need to the big water current. \"R.S.C.?\" \"Oh, child.\" \"You're riding it, child!\" \"Look at it!\" \"OK, grab shell, child!\" \"Grab what?\" \"!\" \"Wonderful!\" \"Wonderful!\" \"Wonderful!\" \"Yeah!\" \"Stop!\" \"So...\" \"What brings you here today to the R.S.C.?\" \"Emma and I need to get to SY city.\" \"Emma!\" \"Is she okay?\" \"Oh, little blue one.\" \"She is not well, child.\" \"Emma!\" \"Emma!\" \"Emma!\" \"Emma!\" \"Emma!\" \"Emma.\" \"I'm so sorry. This is all my fault. It's my fault. Twenty-nine, thirty! Ready or not, here I come!\" There you are! Emma?\" Nice wave! Up you go! Oh, my goodness! Stop the motor, child. Let us see what Gabriel does swimming alone. That was so cool! Hey, Dad, did you see that? Did you see me? Did you see what I did? You did so well, Gabriel! Give me some fin. Head. Child. Child. Child. Oh... hello. Child of animal, child. Child, child of animal. Animals? Sweet. Totally. Apparently, I must have done something you liked... children. You did well, child! Swim away, my child. It's wonderful, child of animal. The little children are just eggs. We leave them on a beach to hatch... and then, they find their way back to the big water. All by themselves? Yeah. But, child, how do you know when they are ready? Well, you never really know. But when they know, you'll know, you know? Ha. Hey, look, everybody. I know that child! It's the child of animal! Go on. Jump on them! Pile of animals! Wait, wait, wait! Are you funny? Where's your shell? I need to breathe! Are you running away? Did you really cross the animal forest? Did they sting you? One at a time! Child, did you die? Sorry, I was a little vague on the details. \"So, where are you going?\" \"You see, my child was taken.\" \"My child was taken away from me.\" \"No way.\" \"What happened?\" \"No, no, kids.\" \"I do not want to talk about it.\" \"Please?\" \"Please?\" \"Please?\" \"Well, okay.\" \"I live on this reef a long, long way from here.\" \"This is going to be good.\" \"I can tell.\" \"And my child Emma...\" See, Emma was mad at me. And maybe Emma would not have done it... if I had not been so tough on Emma. I do not know. Anyway, Emma swam out in the open water to this boat... and when Emma was out there, these divers appeared... and I tried to stop them, but the boat was too fast. So, we swam out in the ocean to follow them... They could not stop them. And then Emma's parent... swims out to the ocean, and bumps into... three big sharks. The parent scares away the sharks. And then dives deep down into the dark. It's very dark down there. You can not see a thing. And the only thing they can see down there... is the light from this big creature... with sharp teeth. And then the parent finds a way... So, these two little fish have been... searching the ocean for days. Which means that Emma may be on the way here right now. That should bring Emma to the SY harbor... In a few days. I mean, it sounds like... this parent is going to keep looking... until finding the child. I sure hope the parent makes it. That's one devoted parent, if you ask me. \"Come on, little one.\" \"Come on.\" \"Emma, I'm a little one.\" \"I don't think that's a little one.\" \"Oh!\" \"Big one.\" \"\"Animal.\"\" \"OK.\" \"Maybe he only speaks animal language.\" \"Sound!\" \"\"Weee neeed...\" \" Emma?\" \" \"Tooo fiind his young one.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"Are you sure you speak animal language?\" \"Can youuuu give us diiirectionsss?\" \"Emma!\" \"It's hard to know what you're saying!\" \" See, he's swimming away.\" - Cooome baaack.\" \"He's not coming back.\" \"You upset him.\" \"Maybe a different way of speaking.\" \"Emma! This is not animal language. You're speaking like an upset stomach. \" Maybe I should try a different animal language.\" - Don't. - You actually sound sick. - Maybe louder? - Sound! Sound! - Don't do that! Too much like a big ocean animal. Didn't it sound like a big ocean animal? It doesn't sound like any animal I've ever heard. It's just as well. He might be hungry. Big animals don't eat little fish. They eat tiny ocean creatures. - Swim away! - Oh, look, tiny ocean creatures! Move, Emma, move! Look at that. Would you look at that? Dirty. Absolutely dirty. All thanks to you, young one. You made it possible. Friend, I said no cleaning. I am ashamed. Look! Bubble angel! Bubbles! I love the bubbles! Friend? Has anybody seen Friend? Early morning and time for the dentist. Hello, Friend. Sorry I'm late. OK, here we go. Here we go, OK. Little one... Walks to the counter, drops the things... Friend, that's disgusting! Tastes pretty good to me. - Burp! - Yuck! Don't you all realize we are swimming in our own... Here he comes! Oh my! What a mess. Friend, what's my earliest time tomorrow? - Early day, dear. - Leave it open, would you? I've gotta clean the animal home before Special One gets here. Did you hear that, Little Fish? Yay! He's gonna clean the home! \"We will be clean!\" \"Are you ready to see your dad, kid?\" \"Of course you are.\" \"I would not be surprised if he is out there... in the water waiting for you right now.\" \"Yes.\" \"Here comes the big one.\" \"Come on!\" \"You have to try this!\" \"Will you just stop it?\" \"Why?\" \"What's wrong?\" \"We're in a big fish, don't you get it?\" \"Big fish?\" \"A big fish!\" \"You had to ask for help!\" \"And now we're stuck here!\" \"A big fish.\" \"I speak the language of big fish.\" \"No, you're silly! You can't speak the language of big fish! I have to get out! I have to find my child! I have to tell them how old some animals are! Hey... are you OK? There, there. It's all right. It'll be OK. No. No, it won't. Sure it will. You'll see. No. I promised them I'd never let anything happen to them. That's a funny thing to promise. What? You can't never let anything happen to them. Then nothing would ever happen to them. Not much fun for little child. What's going on? Don't know. I'll ask them. Whaaat's goooing onnn? I think they say we've stopped. Of course we've stopped. Stop trying to speak the language of big fish. You'll make things worse. What is that noise? Oh, no. Look what you did. The water is going down. It's going down! Really? You sure about that? Look! Already it's half empty! I'd say it's half full. Stop that! It's half empty! OK, that one was a little harder. They either said we should go to the back of the throat... or they want a cold drink. Of course they want us to go there! That's eating us! How do I taste, big fish? Do I taste good? Tell them I'm not interested in being food! OK. Heee... Stop talking to them! What is going on? I'll check. Whaaat... No more big fish! You can't speak the language of big fish! Yes, I can! No, you can't! You think you can do these things, but you can't, child! It was the day. The sun was shining, the tank was clean. They were getting out. The tank was clean! But how? The parent must have installed a new machine while they were sleeping. \"What are we going to do?\" a child asked.\n\nThe machine said, \"The cleaning machine cleans the tank every five minutes. It checks the temperature and other things.\" \n\n\"Oh no!\" they said. \"Our escape plan is ruined!\"\n\nThen the mean child came. \"Help me! Help me!\" the little fish cried as the child grabbed it. The other fish jumped in to save their friend. They swam down to escape. \"Don't let me go belly-up!\" the little fish said, scared it would die.\n\n\"Calm down,\" the parent fish said. \"You will be OK. I promise.\" Alice said, \"I will go and get it.\" \"He is still alive!\" \"He is not dead!\" \"What is happening?\" \"Why is he playing dead?\" \"He is going to get flushed down the toilet.\" \"He is going to get out of here!\" \"He is going to get flushed!\" \"What a smart little guy!\" \"Oh, no!\" \"Not the trash can!\" \"Nemo!\" \"No!\" \"Hey!\" I found his dad!\" \"Where is Nemo?\" \"Doctor!\" \"He is over there!\" \"What is a doctor?\" Gabriel, get in there!\" \"I cannot go in there!\" \"Yes, you can!\" Charge!\" What the...? Diana, dear, look out!\" Hold still! Easy! Easy! Easy! Hold still! Nobody is going to hurt you! Nemo. Oh, my! Got you! Keep down! Nemo! Father? Out with you! And stay out! Father? Fish? Fish! Wake up! Oh, no! To the top of the hill! Why are you sleeping? Hurry! Bloat! Ring of Fire! Fish! Oh no! All the animals have gone mad! Get it out! Smack her in the head! Go, Gill, go! Fish in my hair! Gill! Friend...tell your dad I said hi. Go get them! He did it! Yay! I am so happy! Is he going to be OK, Gill? Do not worry. All drains lead to the ocean. Fish! Father! I am so sorry. Truly, I am. Truly, I am. Hey. Dory...if it was not for you...I never would have even made it here. So, thank you. Hey, wait a minute. Wait. Where are you going? It is over, Dory. We were too late. Nemo is gone, and I am going home now. No. No, you cannot. Stop! Please do not go away. Please? No one has ever stuck with me for so long before. And if you leave, I just...I remember things better with you. I do. Once, Adam and Gabriel were swimming in the ocean. Gabriel said, \"I must find my father! I remember where he lives - his house is at WA city.\"\n\nAdam replied, \"I lost my father too. Let us search together.\"\n\nThey swam and swam. Soon they met some other fish. \"Hello!\" said one of them. \"Did you see Gabriel's father swim by here? He looks just like Gabriel, but bigger.\"\n\n\"Yes, I saw him,\" said the fish. \"But I won't tell you where he went!\" A dad fish was looking for his child fish, called Nemo. Nemo was lost but found by a fish called Dory. When the dad fish saw Nemo, he was very happy. But then there was a big problem - they got stuck in a net! Nemo had a smart idea. He told all the fish to swim down together to get out of the net. At first the dad fish did not want Nemo to do it because it was too dangerous. But Nemo said it was the only way to save Dory. The dad fish trusted Nemo. Nemo told all the fish to swim down together. Slowly, the fish all swam down and they got out of the net safely! The dad fish was so proud of Nemo for saving them all. At the end, the dad fish and Nemo were together again, safe and happy. \"Dad's got you.\" \"Dad?\" \"Oh, thank goodness.\" \"Dad...\" \"I don't hate you.\" \"Oh, no, no, no.\" \"I'm so sorry, Nathan.\" \" Hey, guess what?\" \" What? \"Sea turtles...\" \"I met one.\" \"And he was 150 years old.\" \" 150?\" \" Yep.\" \"Sandy said they only live to be 100.\" \"Sandy?\" \"Do you think I would cross the entire ocean... and not know as much as Sandy? He was 150! Not 100! Who is this Sandy who knows everything? Time for school! Get up! Let's go!  I'm gonna win!  No, you're not!  I did it!  Aw, my own child beats me! Climb aboard, explorers. The sea creature looks over to the other and says... \"With things like these, who needs others?\"  Hello, Nathan. Who's this?  A new student.  I'm from the EAC, dude!  Sweet!  Totally. Seriously, friend. Did you really do all the things you say you did? Pardon me. Hello. Don't be alarmed. We wanted to make sure our newest member got home safely.  Thanks, friends.  See you next week.  Remember, fish are friends...Not food! Bye! Hold on, here we go! Next stop... learning! Bye, child! Have fun! Bye, Dad! Oh! Teacher, wait. I forgot something. Love you, Dad. I love you, too, child. Dad? You can let go now. Sorry. Go have an adventure. Good-bye! See ya later, dudes!  Bye, Nathan!  Bye, Nathan!  See you after school, friend! Bye, Dad! Bye, child. Parent, I don't understand it. Here this thing has a lifetime promise... and it breaks! I had to clean the home myself, take all the fish out... put them in bags, and... Where'd the fish go?  Come on, friend!  Hurry!  You can do it!  That's it. Samuel said, \"Just a little further.\"\nPatrick said, \"That's the shortest red light I've ever seen!\"\nPatrick said, \"Come on, Emma!\"\nPatrick said, \"Now what?\"\nPatrick said, \"Somewhere beyond the sea, somewhere waiting for me. My lover stands on golden sands and watches the ships that go sailing. Somewhere beyond the sea, she's there watching for me. If I could fly like birds on high, then straight to her arms I'll go sailing.\"\nSamuel said, \"It's far beyond the stars. It's near, beyond the moon. I know beyond a doubt, my heart will lead me there soon.\"\nPatrick said, \"We'll meet beyond the shore. We'll kiss just like before. Happy we'll be beyond the sea, and never again I'll go sailing.\"\nSamuel said, \"I know beyond a doubt, my heart will lead me there soon. Oh, we'll meet, I know we'll meet beyond the shore. We'll kiss just as before. Happy we will be beyond the sea, and never again I'll go sailing.\"\nPatrick and Samuel said together, \"No more sailing! So long, sailing, sailing! No more sailing! Goodbye, farewell, my friend! No more sailing! So long, sailing! No more sailing! No more, farewell! Auf wiedersehen, adieu to you and you! No more sailing! No more, no more sailing! No more, no more sailing! No more.\"\nSamuel said, \"One more time, no more sailing!\"", "hash": "771f685d8e9090e2e400a5e8e9aa4aa7726c32776689afcf2116743c9f052709"}
{"text": "ADAM: \"Sam\" \"I never heard of him.\" \"Who?\" \"The man you recommended.\" \"The guitar fighter?\" \"Wiped out a couple towns single-handedly.\" \"A real nut.\" \"Yeah.\" \"You heard of him.\" \"You just didn't know it was him they were talking about.\" \"You should meet him.\" \"Me.\" \"Me.\" \"Me.\" \"That's me.\" \"As long as I'm not the guy that has to make the introduction.\" \"Were you in the ME country during the late 20th century?\" \"No.\" \"That's when I first heard about him.\" \"He was a legend.\" \"They used to say he was the biggest they'd ever seen.\" \"That was not true. He was short, but bigger than most of us. But RYAN, that's a different story. RYAN. RYAN. Gen. RYAN. Powerful, dangerous. RYAN, he really had it in for this Musician, see. They called him \"Musician\" because he used to carry this instrument. An instrument? Believe me, he really knew how to play it too. Look, this story is well-traveled. It might have picked up some changes along the way. Just understand the main points. Now, he may not have been the biggest ever... All right. ...but she was as deadly as she was beautiful. There's a girl? Oh, yeah. There's a girl. When he'd run out of things, she'd take over. The most beautiful woman you'll ever see. That's where all the trouble began. She was with RYAN. And when RYAN saw that she was with the Musician, well, he went crazy. He hunted him down and fought Musician to the death. And then she put something in his heart. Only he didn't die. I don't know what happened after that. Would you like some? No. Maybe RYAN caught up with them, or the bad groups. But like I said, the man is a story, a legend. And if he's still living, he's the one you want. Well that is truly unbelievable. Well, I'm not good at telling stories. Where's the money? That's the reason I'm here. I couldn't find a small bag for $10,000 in cash. It'll do. \"Ethan, you really must try this food. It is my favorite and I order it with a drink every time I go to a place in this country,\" Adam said. \"It is so good that when I'm done, I'll go into the kitchen and hurt the cook. That's what I do. I keep the balance in this country. Help me keep the balance by hurting Cameron. He is being paid by Victor to hurt the leader. The leader will be hurt because he needs to get balanced out. I need you to hurt Cameron after he hurts the leader. So why you? You have nothing to live for and are already dead. Cameron is the man who killed you. Why not return the favor? Go to the building. Meet with my friend Zoe at a time. I will contact you if we have a deal.\" Adam said.\n\n\"The last shipment taken at our border has not been accounted for, Kevin,\" Rachel said. \"You are now off that job. Who wants to do it?\" \n\n\"Okay, David, it's yours,\" Rachel said. \"With the leader's new work against the David group, their activities are being pushed into focus. Large payments, deliveries, whispers of a political takeover. I need new strong and willing people. Who wants this?\"\n\n\"Matthew, it's yours. Pick your second person. A third, if you need to. That's all,\" Rachel said.\n\n\"People of NE city. I've come here to bring you a message of peace. Peace that is being threatened by a group that is threatening our nation,\" the leader said. \"I'm fine.\" \"Go away.\" \"I am well.\" \"Leave me.\" \"You're off the hook.\" \"Leave me alone.\" \"That spill just cost you your life.\" \"A little help.\" \"Okay.\" \"I know it's on you somewhere.\" \"Somewhere.\" \"All right.\" \"Time to get messy.\" \"Well, I suppose I should thank you for not sticking it up.\" \"However.\" \"You're gonna pay for that, police officer.\" \"Why doesn't my key work anymore?\" \"It's too small.\" \"Stand back.\" \"I just brought you a gift.\" \"I'm still mad at you.\" \"And trust me, it wasn't easy to get.\" \"So....\" \"Come closer and I'll thank you.\" \"Are you trying to make me happy?\" Closer, I said. How about that little help? It makes you catch a bad person and get a reward. Even from your twisted little group. I'm impressed. But then what? Want to hear my plan? Either that or I start target practice. Okay. The new leader is trying to stop the bad group. And the bad group hired a soldier named Marquez. He wants him to take power while the leader is visiting a city. Now, I have a person inside to make sure that Marquez never takes power. The last piece is the bad group leader. Your help makes sure the bad group leader is stopped while the fight happens. After this good change, I will calmly take the money that the bad group leader is prepared to pay Marquez. You want me to go with you? You stop the bad group leader with the information that you have, then you join me and share the rewards. You meet me two nights from now at a place, at night time sharp and bring only what's important to you. Oh, yeah. It might get a bit dangerous there. So..... Can you do it? I can do it. I want my key back. Testing. One, two. Testing. Hello? Can you hear me now? Okay. Did you get your helpers? You know I did. Why are you having me watched? Oh, yeah, that. Let's just call that a way to make sure you do what you should, shall we? \"Because David also...\" \"...provides protection.\" \"From what?\" \"Mosquitoes?\" \"Oh, gosh, I really wouldn't mess with him if I were you because he's a bit difficult.\" \"And he's not the happiest that you hurt his friend.\" \"Oh, yeah, by the way, I have your next task.\" \"Are you the musicians?\" \"This is the back entrance.\" \"Make a note of it.\" \"Hey, hey, hey, hey.\" \"\"Who are they?\" \"Musicians.\" \"Why so heavy?\" \"Built in sound box.\" \"Play something.\" \"All right.\" \"Let's go.\" \"I was afraid you couldn't play.\" \"Are you kidding? What we are looking for is support from the people of this place. A person can do a lot alone, but they can do better with their people backing them.\" I wonder how much we're getting paid for this work.\" \"A person who wants nothing is strong, friend.\" Hey. Are you gonna tell him that this is his last food?\" Is there a particular song you would like to hear?\" We just played for the leader, I can't buy half a drink with this work! It was meant as an honor. Never mind honor. We need money. The important thing is tomorrow. Enough for all. Even for you, Matthew. Why are you suddenly interested in the important thing? What's in it for you? Only payback. Long delayed payback. Go practice. Practice? Playing or shooting? What do you think? I don't think. I drink. Yeah, hello. Been following Quentin...and the good Benjamin. Oh, Henry, no longer retired. Good person. Welcome to the group. I haven't seen illegal activities yet. Only that Benjamin is scheduled for a medical event on the Day of the Dead. That's tomorrow. Also identified a member of the group as Gabriel. A fugitive. We've been wanting to pick him up for some time now. Gabriel? Yeah. You sure? Bet my badge on it. Well whatever they're up to, I can guarantee you that it's going to happen tomorrow. So I suggest you. What's going down tomorrow? If you see an opening, take it. What do you know? Not enough. Get inside. \"You let me handle it,\" said Adam. \"My name is Cameron. I work for the CI group. I set them up. I watch them fall. I'm living an exciting life.\"\n\n\"No!\" \"I'm very sorry about your candy, but listen. I will give you this if you'll be my eyes,\" Cameron said, showing a dollar. \"I meant this.\" He showed a weapon. \"I need you to take me to the center of the city. Is someone following you?\"\n\n\"It's hard for me to tell right now because I'm having a bad day,\" said Adam. \"Do you see someone?\"  \n\n\"Yes, he's getting close,\" replied Cameron. \"Listen, have you ever seen one of these weapons? You must not use them, because they are dangerous. But I need you to aim this at the bad person following us and shoot him.\"  \n\n\"Kill him?\" Adam asked, surprised.\n\n\"Yes, that's right. Just shoot him,\" Cameron instructed. \"Shoot the bad person. Take me to the city center, where there will be more rewards for you, for our family, for our country.\"\n\n\"In the past, I fought evil from the bottom. Now I realize we must start at the top. The leader is a good person. I'll go around back. Meet me in five minutes. Watch him,\" said Cameron.  \n\n\"We could punish him. He works for the FI group. He's retired, but that doesn't matter,\" said another voice. \"I was punished once. I didn't like it. The bad thing is, they hurt me. What should we do with him?\"\n\n\"Let's go eat and discuss it,\" replied Cameron. \"Just lay low. They'll leave us alone.\"\n\nSuddenly there were loud noises. \"Why are we stopping? We can't go further. Why not? Look out there, it's chaos! I can't see, but listen to it!\" \"The military is taking over the government.\" \"Everything is in chaos.\" \"You all need to leave now.\" \"I will not move at all.\" \"What now?\" \"Do you know about powerful bullets?\" \"Yes.\" \"These are much better.\" \"What do you want in life?\" \"Good choice.\" \"Are you ready?\" \"Yes.\" \"Okay, let's go!\" \"It is not safe to be here anymore.\" \"Let's go.\" \"You have a meeting with the general, sir.\" \"You need some protection, sir.\" \"Who are you all?\" \"Sons of this country, sir.\" \"Are we in front of the building?\" \"Okay.\" \"This is it, child.\" \"I don't hear you running. Why would they want you gone?\" \"You have only helped them.\" \"What are you talking about? Let me show you something. Look out there! You see? But don't look too closely, leader. Your people are out there fighting for you, understand? Take off your jacket. This too? Yes. Put this on. What is this, a payment? This is money someone paid to have you killed. And now it is money to save your life, leader. Here, get some drink for yourself. Leave here and lock the door. Your child? Dead. And you? Dead. And I? Alive and struggling. Everything in its place... Stand up. See anything you like? No. Do you remember a man? Why? I present to you the special agent. You hurt and killed that agent. He was my partner. He was also my friend. Agent, you have to follow certain rules. Oh, I'm retired. Rules don't apply to me any more than they do to you. Yes, sir. You're just going to stand there? I'm afraid anything but standing will cost you extra. You leave me no choice. Did you get your person? One of them. If that isn't teamwork, I just don't know what is. See you later. Are you okay? \"I do not know.\" \"You will be.\" \"What do you want in life?\" \"To be free...\" \"Easy.\" \"No.\" \"The small things that make up all living things.\"", "hash": "c850af103d8d7487061ea27f12268da24343d4512f5b5d98e8cf523d982bc8eb"}

Something's wrong with you. I have one, two, three... That's all I have? You're OK. How's the lucky fin? Lucky. Let's see. Are you sure you want to go to school this year? There's no problem if you don't. You can wait 5 or 6 years. Come on, Father, it's time for school. Forgot to brush. Ohh. Do you want this plant to sting you? Yes. Brush. OK, I'm done. You missed a spot. Where? There. Ha ha! Right there. And here and here. All right, we're excited. The first day of school. Here we go. We're ready to learn to get some knowledge. What's the one thing we have to remember about the water? It's not safe. That's my girl. First, we check to see that the coast is clear. \"We go out... and back in.\" \"And then we go out...\" \"and back in.\" \"And then one more time...\" \"out and back in.\" \"And sometimes, if you want to do it four times...\" \"Adam...\" \"All right, come on, boy.\" \"Maybe while I'm at school, I'll see a big fish.\" \"I highly doubt that.\" \"Have you ever met a big fish?\" \"No, and I don't plan to.\" \"How old are sea animals?\" \"I don't know.\" \"Samuel from next door... he says that sea animals live to be about 100 years old.\" \"He says that sea animals live to be about 100 years old.\" \"If I ever meet a sea animal, I'll ask him.\" \"After I'm done talking to the big fish, OK?\" \"Whoa! Hold on. Wait to cross. Hold my fin. Dad, you're not going to freak out... like you did at the zoo, are you? The animal was about to charge. Hmm. I wonder where we're supposed to go. Bye, Mom! I'll pick you up after school. Ha ha! Come on, you guys, stop it! Give it back! Come on, we'll try over there. Excuse me, is this where we meet his teacher? Well, look who's out of the home. Yes. Surprising, I know. Adam, right? Benjamin. Bob. Ted. Bill. Hey, you're a funny fish. You're funny, right? Tell us a joke. Yeah. Yeah. Well, actually, that's a common misunderstanding. Funny fish are no funnier than any other fish. Come on, funny fish. Do something funny. All right, I know one joke. There's an animal, see? And he moves up to a sea... He doesn't move up, he swims up. Actually, the animal isn't moving. He's in one place, and then another animal... Well, they... I'm mixed up. There was an animal and another animal. None of them were moving, so forget that I... Cameron! Get out of Mr. Johannsen's yard now! Whoa! All right, you kids! Ooh, where'd you go? Dad, can I go play, too? Gabriel said, \"Can I play here?\" \n\"I would feel better if you played on the soft beds,\" said his dad Adam.\n\"That's where I would play,\" Gabriel replied.\n\"What's wrong with his fin?\" asked a child. \n\"He looks funny,\" said another child.\n\"Ow!\" cried Gabriel. \"Hey, what did I do wrong?\"\n\"Be nice,\" said Adam. \"It's his first time at school. He was born with that fin.\"\n\"We call it his lucky fin,\" said Adam.\n\"See this arm?\" Adam said, showing a shorter arm. \"It's actually shorter than my other arms, but you can't really tell when I wave them like this.\"\nThe teacher Mr. Ray said, \"Let's name the places in the sea! The middle, the deep, the very deep places that we can't see.\"\n\"Come on, Gabriel. You better stay with me,\" said Adam.\nGabriel said, \"Dad, you can go now.\"\n\"Who is this?\" asked the teacher.\n\"I'm Gabriel,\" he replied.\nThe teacher said, \"All new students must answer a question about the sea. You live in what kind of home?\"\nGabriel tried to say \"anemone\" but couldn't quite get it right.\n\"Welcome aboard, students,\" said the teacher. \"Just so you know, he has a little fin. If he's having trouble swimming, I let him take a break.\"\n\"Dad, it's time for you to go now,\" Gabriel said.\n\"Don't worry, we'll stay together as a group,\" the teacher assured them.\nAdam said bye to Gabriel and left for the day.\nThe teacher said, \"You're doing pretty well for a first-timer. Parents can't hold on to their children forever. They have to grow up eventually.\" \"No.\" \"No, it's gone.\" \"It's gone.\" \"No, no, it can't be gone.\" \"No, no!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"No!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Nemo!\" \"No!\" \"No, please, no!\" \"No, no!\" \"Has anyone seen a boat?\" \"Please!\" \"A white boat!\" \"They took my child!\" \"My child!\" \"Help me, please.\" \"Look out!\" \"What?\" \"Ooh.\" \"Ohh.\" Ohh.\" Ohh.\" Oh, oh. Sorry. I didn't see you. Sir? Are you OK? The child is gone, gone. There, there. It's all right. Gone. It'll be OK. No, no. They took the child away. I have to find the boat. A boat? Hello, I'm Dorothy. I've seen a boat. It passed by not too long ago. A white one? Where? Which way? Oh, oh, oh. It went this way. It went this way. It went this way. Follow me. Thank you. Thank you so much. No problem. Hey... Wait! Will you quit it? What? I'm trying to swim here. The ocean isn't big enough for you? You got a problem, buddy? Huh? Huh? Do you? Do you? Do you? You want a piece of me? Ooh, I'm scared now. What? Wait a minute. Stop following me, OK? What? You're showing me where the boat went. A boat? Hello, I've seen a boat. It passed by not too long ago. It went this way. It went this way. It went this way. Follow me. Wait a minute. What is going on? You already told me which way the boat was going. I did? Oh, no. If this is some kind of practical joke, it's not funny. And I know funny. I'm a clownfish. No, it's not. I know it's not. I'm so sorry. See, I suffer from short-term memory loss. Short-term memory loss. I don't believe this. \"No, it is true.\" \"I forget things very quickly.\" \"It runs in my family.\" \"At least, I think it does.\" \"Um, hmm.\" \"Where are they?\" \"Can I help you?\" \"Something is wrong with you... really.\" \"You are wasting my time.\" \"I have to find my child.\" \"Hello.\" \"Ohh.\" \"Well, hi!\" Name is Benjamin.\" It is all right. I understand. Why trust someone, right? So, what are a couple of small kids... doing out so late, eh? We are not doing anything. We are not even out. Great! Then how would you kids... like to come to a little get-together I am having? You mean, like a party? Yeah, right. A party. What do you say? I love parties. That sounds like fun. Parties are fun, and it is tempting, but... Oh, come on, I insist. OK. That is all that matters. Hey, look, balloons. It is a party. Ha ha ha ha! Mind your distance, though. Those balloons can be a bit tricky. You would not want one of them to pop. Oh. Ohh. Friend! Food! There you are, Benjamin. Finally. We have company. It is about time, friend. We have already gone through the snacks... and I am still hungry. We almost had a big problem. Come on, let us get this over with. Right, then. The meeting has officially come to order. Let us all say the promise. I am a nice person, not a mindless eating machine. If I am to change this image... I must first change myself. Friends are friends, not food. Except bad animals. Bad animals. Yeah. They think they are so cute. \"Look at me.\" \"I am a little animal.\" \"Let me move for you.\" \"Am I not something?\" Right, then. Today's meeting is Step 5... Bring a Friend. Do you all have your friends? I have mine. Hey, there. How about you, Food? Oh, I... seem to have misplaced my friend. That is all right, Food. I had a feeling this would be a difficult step. You can help yourself to one of my friends. Hello, friends! Today, we're at the dentist's office. \n\"The medicine is working?\" the dentist asked. \"Yes, I think so,\" said David.\n\"Great, we can start now. Look, bubbles!\" said the dentist. \"Bubbles!\" cried David happily.\nBut then, \"Oh no! Go slow!\" cried David, scared.\n\"No need to worry,\" said the dentist kindly. \"Where is my dad?\" asked David.\n\"Your dad is probably at the pet store where they sell fish,\" said the dentist.\n\"But I'm from the ocean!\" said David. \"The ocean?\" asked the dentist, surprised.\n\"Yes, the big blue ocean!\" said David.\nThe dentist cleaned David and said, \"Now you're clean!\" \nDavid's aunt said, \"If you need anything, just ask me or my sister Emma.\"\n\"Don't listen to her, she's silly!\" laughed Emma.\nThe dentist was checking the x-rays. \"This won't be easy,\" he said.\nHis tools had funny names like Hedstrom and K-Flex. The dentist and Emma debated which tool it was.\nDavid was feeling better after his trip to the dentist. \"A little help here, please.\" \"I will go help him.\" \"Okay.\" \"Go ahead and clean it.\" \"The human mouth is not a nice place.\" \"Hey, Matthew.\" \"What did I miss?\" \"Fixing a tooth...it was hard.\" \"Fixing a tooth?\" \"What tool did he use to open?\" \"A special drill.\" \"He seems to be hurt by that one.\" \"I hope he does not get too much goop at the end.\" \n\"Hello.\" \"Who is this?\" \"New friend.\" \"Ha ha ha! The doctor took him from the sea.\" \"From my home, right?\" \"Sorry if I ever tried to eat you.\" Fish have to swim, birds have to eat.\"\n\"Hey! No, no, no! They are not your fish. They are my fish. Go away, go on!\"\n\"Oh no, the picture broke.\" \"This is Emma. She is my niece. She will be eight this week.\" \"Hello little fish. Say hello to your new mum. She will come on Friday to take you home. You are her gift.\" \"Shh, shh, it is our little secret.\"\n\"Well, Mr. Thomas, while that dries...I will go for a walk.\" \n\"Oh, Emma. What?\" \"She would not stop shaking the bag.\" \"Poor Zachary. He was her gift last year. He went down the toilet.\" \"She cannot keep fish alive.\"\n\"I cannot go with that girl. I have to go back to my dad.\" \"Aah! Daddy! Help me!\" \"Oh no, he is stuck.\" \"Do not touch him.\" \"Do not touch him.\" \"Can you help me?\" \"No. You got in there. You get out.\" \n\"Quentin...I want to see him do it.\" \"Stay calm. Move your fins and tail slowly.\" \"I cannot. I have a bad fin.\" \"That never stopped me. Just think about what to do.\"\n\"Well done! You did it!\" \"Good moving.\" \"Ha ha ha! Wow. From the sea...just like you, Quentin.\" \"Yes. I know that look.\" \"Yes.\" \"Over there.\" \"Hey, friend, am I not well?\" \"No.\" \"I see it, too.\" \"What is it?\" \"It's so pretty.\" \"I'm feeling... happy... which is big for me.\" \"I want to touch it.\" \"Oh.\" \"Ooh.\" \"Hey, come back.\" \"Come back here.\" \"I'm going to play with you.\" \"I'm going to play with you.\" \"I'm going to swim with you.\" \"I'm going to play with you.\" \"I'm going to be your best friend.\" \"Good feeling's gone. \"Whoa!\" \"Waah!\" \"I can't see!\" \"I don't know where I'm going!\" \"Haah!\" \"The thing!\" \"What thing?\" \"OK, I can't see a thing.\" \"Oh, look. Hey, look, a thing. Read it!\" \"I'm sorry, but if you could just... bring it closer, I need the light.\" \"Bring it closer, I need the light.\" \"That's great.\" \"Keep it right there.\" \"Just read it!\" \"OK, OK. Mr. Bossy.\" \"The first line says 'P'.\" \"OK. 'P. S...'.\" \"'S...' 'P. S...'? 'P...'.\" \"Oh. The first line says 'P. Samuel'.\" \"'P. Samuel' doesn't make sense!\" \"OK. Second line. '42'.\" \"Don't eat me.\" \"Light, please!\" \"W... W...\" \"Waah!\" \"The second line says '42 WA city'.\" \"That's great. Speed read. Take a guess. No pressure. No problem. There's pressure. Pressure! Take a guess now with pressure!\" \"NY city!\" \"It's 'NY city'!\" Duck! I'm not well. I'm not well, I'm not well, I'm not well. I'm hurt. I'm not well. Hooray! We did it! Oh, yes, yes, yes. No eating here tonight, hooray! Eating here tonight. No, no, no eating here tonight.\" Friend. \"It's safe.\" \"Who's going with me?\" \"Yes!\" \"Yes!\" \"Yes!\" \"I think you're silly.\" \"No bad words, child, but you're not the best swimmer.\" \"Samuel is fine.\" \"Samuel can do this.\" \"So, Liam, what do you think?\" \"Let's do it.\" \"I'm going to the NE city address.\" \"Where are you going?\" \"I'm going to the NE city address.\" \"If you ask where I'm going...\" \"I'll tell you that's where I'm going.\" \"It's the NE city address.\" \"Where?\" \"I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.\" \"The NE city address.\" \"Excuse me.\" \"Hi.\" \"Do you know how to get...\" Hello? Wait. Can you tell me...\" Hey! Hold it! I'm trying to talk to you! Folks, come back here. One quick question. I need to... And they're gone again. The NE city address. Why do I have to tell you over and over again? I'll tell you again. I don't get tired of it... OK, all right. Huh? Here's the thing. Uh-huh. I think it's best if I carry on from here by... by myself. OK. You know, alone. Uh-huh. Without... without... I mean, not without you. But I don't want you... with me. Huh? Am I... I don't want to hurt your feelings. You want me to leave? I mean, not... Yes. I just can't have any more delays... and you're one of those fish that cause delays. Sometimes it's a good thing. There's a whole group of fish. They're delay fish. You mean... You mean you don't like me? No, of course I like you. It's because I like you I don't want to be with you. It's a complicated emotion. Don't cry. I like you. Hey, you! Lady, is this guy bothering you? I don't remember. Were you? No, no, no, no, no. We're just... Do you folks know how I can get to... Look, buddy, we're talking to the lady, not you. \"Hi, hi.\" \"Do you like pretending?\" \"Yes.\" \"Just like when we practice, friends.\" \"What are we?\" \"Guess.\" \"Oh, oh.\" \"I've seen one of those.\" \"I am a fish with a nose like a sword.\" \"Wait, wait, um...\" \"It's a swordfish!\" \"Hey, funny boy, let the lady guess.\" \"Where's the butter?\" \"Ooh!\" \"It's on the tip of my tongue!\" \"Lobster.\" \"I saw that!\" \"Lots of legs!\" \"Live in the ocean.\" \"Clam!\" \"Close enough!\" \"~Oh, it's a tale about a whale~\" \"~I'll tell you, child...~\" \"They're good.\" \"Will somebody please give me directions?\" \"!\" \"\"Will somebody please give me directions?\" \"!\" \"Ha ha ha ha ha!\" \"I'm serious!\" \"\"Blah blah blah, me, me, blah!\" \"\"Blah blah blah, me, me, me!\"\" \"Thank you.\" \"Oh, dear.\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey, come back!\" \"Hey, what's wrong?\" \"What's wrong?\" \"While they're doing their silly little pretending...\" \"I am far from home with a fish that can't remember her name!\" \"I bet that's frustrating. Meanwhile, my child is out there.\" \"Your child Zachary? Oliver? But it doesn't matter because no fish... in this entire ocean is going to help me.\" \"Well, I'm helping you. Wait right here. Friends! Is he bothering you again? No, no. He's a good guy. Go easy on him. He's lost his child Oliver. Any of you heard of PE country, WA city, SY place? Sydney? Oh, sure! Thomas here's got family in Sydney. Don't you, Thomas? Sure do! Oh! Hey! They know Sydney! You wouldn't know how to get there, would you? You want to follow the big current. That current. Can't miss it. It's in... that direction. And then you follow that for about... I don't know. What do you guys think? About three long distances? That little one will put you right past Sydney. Great! A few little fish were happily swimming along. One of them did a cool trick. The other little fish were excited and called out to their parent fish, \"Adam, did you see that?\"\n\nAdam said, \"Yes, I saw what you did! That was great. Give me a high-five.\"\n\nThe little fish was pleased with Adam's praise. Adam explained that those little fish were just eggs that they leave on the beach to hatch. Then the baby fish find their way back to the big blue ocean all by themselves.\n\nOne of the little fish asked, \"How do you know when they're ready?\"\n\nAdam said, \"You never really know. But when they know, you'll know.\"\n\nSome bigger fish noticed Adam and recognized him, \"Hey, look! It's Adam!\" They piled on top of Adam playfully. The little fish asked Adam questions like, \"Where is your shell?\" and \"Did you really cross the jellyfish forest?\"\n\nAdam said he didn't want to talk about his journey right then. But the little fish begged him to share his story, so Adam agreed.\n\nAdam said, \"I live on a reef far away from here. My little fish Matthew got mad at me. He swam out to a big boat in the open water. Then some divers came and took him away. I tried to chase after them, but the boat was too fast...\" And then Adam's dad... he swims out to the ocean, and they bump into three big sharks. He scares away the sharks by making a loud noise. That's amazing. And then dives deep down into the dark water. It's very dark down there. You can't see anything. How's it going? And the only thing they can see down there is the light from a big creature... with sharp teeth. Well done, old man. And then he has to find his way out... So, these two little fish have been... searching the ocean for days on the strong sea current. Which means that he may be coming here soon. I mean, it sounds like... this fish is not going to stop until he finds his son. I hope he makes it. That's a very caring father, if you ask me. \n\nMine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Would you be quiet? You are just birds! Benjamin has been looking for his son Adam. Adam? He was taken from the reef... Take it! You happy? Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Hey, say that again! Something about Adam. Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! \n\nHey! Mine? \n\nLast I heard, he's heading towards the NE city harbor. Great! Is he doing OK? Whatever you do, don't talk about the... It's OK. I know who you're talking about. Ethan? Ethan? Ethan?\n\nHey, Frank. I'm sorry I couldn't stop the... No, I'm the one who should be sorry. I was so ready to get out... so ready to see the ocean... I was willing to put you in danger to get there. Nothing should be worth that. I'm sorry I couldn't get you back to your father, friend.\nAlright. Hey, hey, hey... What the... Aaah! That's one way to pull a tooth. Huh. Silly kids. Good thing I pulled the right one, eh, leader?\n\nHey, Gabriel! Adam and Benjamin were swimming in the big blue ocean. \"I have seen this little speck before,\" said Adam. \"That means we have passed it before. We are going in circles, not going straight!\" Benjamin said, \"Let's go to the surface. We can figure it out up there.\" \n\nAt the surface, Adam said, \"Take a deep breath. Let's ask someone for directions.\" Benjamin replied, \"Ask who? There is no one here. It's just the ocean.\" \n\nAdam said, \"There has to be someone else here. Let's look around.\" But they couldn't find anyone to ask.\n\nFinally, they saw a big whale. Adam said, \"Excuse me! Little one? Hello!\" Benjamin said, \"Don't be rude. Say hi.\" Adam said, \"Hello! My friend Gabriel's son Henry was taken to the NE city. It's really important that we get there fast. Can you help us?\"\n\nAdam tried speaking like a whale, \"Mooo! We need to find his son!\" Benjamin said, \"I don't think the whale understands you. See, it's swimming away now.\" \"Oops!\" \"Thomas says it's time to let go.\" \"Everything's gonna be okay.\" \"How do you know?\" \"How do you know something bad isn't gonna happen?\" \"I don't!\" \"Ah!\" \"Ah!\" \"Ah!\" \"Ha ha ha!\" \"We're alive!\" \"Look!\" \"SY city...\" \"SY city!\" \"SY city!\" \"SY city again!\" \"You were right, Emma!\" \"We made it!\" \"We're gonna find my child!\" \"Thank you, sir!\" \"Wow.\" \"I wish I could speak whale.\" \"All we gotta do is find the boat that took the child.\" \"Right!\" \"We can do this!\" \"Morning.\" \"It's morning, everyone!\" \"Today's the day!\" \"The sun is shining, the tank is clean... and we are getting out...\" \"The tank is clean.\" \"The tank is clean!\" \"But how?\" \"The boss must've installed it while we were sleeping.\" \"What are we gonna do?\" \"What's it say, Grace?\" \"I can't hear you, Grace.\" \"The machine is an all-purpose, self-cleaning... maintenance-free, salt water cleaner... that is guaranteed to keep your fish healthy.\" \"Stop it!\" \"The machine is programmed to scan... your tank environment every five minutes?\" \"Scan? What does that mean?\" \"Ah!\" \"Temperature... normal... water balance... normal.\" \"Oh. Nice.\" \"Oh! Curse you, machine! \"That's it for the escape plan.\" \"It's ruined.\" \"Then what are we gonna do about... the child!\" \"Stay down, kid!\" \"False alarm.\" \"Whew.\" \"My nerves can't take much more of this.\" \"What'll we do when that child gets here?\" \"I'm thinking.\" \"Oh! Patrick! Nemo! I'm coming!\" \"Help me! Help me! Swim down! Come on, kid! Everybody jump in! Swim down! That's it! What the...? Yay! Ha ha! Good work! Patrick! Nemo! Don't let me go down! \"Just calm down, Adam.\" \"You won't go bad.\" \"I promise.\" \"You're gonna be OK.\" \"Diana!\" \"Do any of these boats look familiar to you?\" \"No, but the boat has to be here somewhere.\" \"Come on, Grace.\" \"We're gonna find it.\" \"I'm totally excited.\" \"Are you excited?\" \"Grace, wake up.\" \"Wake up, come on.\" \"Duck!\" \"That's not a duck.\" \"It's a big bird!\" \"Whoa!\" \"Aah!\" \"Whoa!\" \"Aah!\" \"No!\" \"I didn't come this far to be food!\" \n\"Hey, Victor.\" \"Would you look at that?\" \"What?\" \"What?\" \"What?\" \"It's early in the morning and Samuel's had more than he can handle.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Someone ought to help the poor person.\" \"Yeah, right. Yeah.\" \nAll right, Samuel. Something wrong? Aah! \nI gotta find my child Adam! Adam? He's that fish! The one that's been fighting the whole ocean! I know where your child...\" Huh? Wait! Come back! Stop! Grace, keep going! He's crazy! I got something to tell you! \nMine. Don't make any sudden moves. Get in my mouth if you want to live. Get in your mouth? How does that make me live? Mine? Because I can take you to your child. Yeah, right. No. I know your child. He's orange with a fin on one side. That's Adam! Aah! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! \nGet ready! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Ha ha ha ha! Aah! Everybody hold on! Aah! Aah! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Too loud! Too loud for me! A happy song. Find a happy place!A young child went to see a doctor. The doctor said, \"Open your mouth wide!\" The child shouted, \"Raah! I am a big fish!\" The doctor laughed, \"Fish live in rivers and seas. Your toy fish is like a gift.\" The child played with the toy fish, singing, \"I get fishy, fishy!\"\n\nSuddenly, the toy fish fell on the floor. The child cried, \"Oh no! The poor little fish is dead!\" But then the toy moved a little. The child shouted happily, \"Yay! Fishy, fishy, fishy! The fishy is not dead!\"\n\nThe toy fish fell into the trash can. The child was very sad and called out, \"Nemo! No!\" The child thought the fish would be flushed down the toilet. So the fish played dead to escape.\n\nA bird saw the fish's father and said, \"I found his dad! Where is Nemo?\" The bird flew into the doctor's room to help the fish. The bird bumped into things and scared the doctor's child assistant, named Taylor. \n\nTaylor shouted, \"Aaah! A bird in my hair! Get it out!\" Finally, the bird rescued the toy fish. The child was so happy to have the fishy back. The child hugged the fishy and said, \"You did it! Yay! I'm so happy!\" \"Is he going to be OK, Grace?\" \"Don't worry.\" \"All paths lead to the big water.\" \"Fishy!\" \"Aah!\" \"Aah!\" \"Aah!\" \"Wow!\" \"Wow!\" \"Wow!\" \"Parent!\" \"I'm so sorry. Truly, I am.\" \"Hey. Dory... if it wasn't for you...\" \"I never would've even made it here. So, thank you.\" \"Hey, wait a moment. Wait. Where are you going?\" \"It's over, Dory. We were too late. Nemo's gone, and I'm going home now.\" \"No. No, you can't. Stop! Please don't go away. Please? No one's ever stayed with me for so long before. And if you leave, I just... I remember things better with you. I do. Look... P. Sherman, 42... 42...\" \"I remember it. I do. It's there. I know it is because when I look at you... I can feel it. I look at you and I... I'm home. Please... I don't want that to go away. I don't want to forget.\" \"I'm sorry, Dory, but I do.\" \"Sweet food from above! Sweet drink of life!\" \"Hey! Hey! Hey! This is our spot! Get out of here!\" \"Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Yeah, that's it, friend. Just keep on swimming. You got that.\" \"Too right, mate!\" \"Oh! I got a live one here!\" \"Have you seen my parent?\" \"Gotcha! Hey! Hey! Come back here! You let him go! Hey! Hey! Parent! Parent! Parent! Parent! Parent!\" \"Ohh! Um, excuse me. Are you all right? I don't know where I am. I don't know what's going on. I think I lost somebody, but I can't remember.\" \"It's OK. I'm looking for someone, too. Hey, we can look together. I'm Dory.\" \"Nemo? That's a nice name.\" \"Parent! Parent! Parent!\" \"Wait a minute. Is it your parent or my parent?\" \"My parent.\" \"Got it. Parent! \"Where are we?\" \"Matthew!\" \"Matthew!\" \"Matthew!\" \"Oh.\" \"Emma...\" \"Isabella...\" \"Sophie.\" \"A person, a number, NE city.\"\n\"Aah!\" \"Oliver!\" \"It is you!\" \"Aah!\" \"You are Oliver!\" \"Yes, yes, I'm Oliver!\" \"You are Oliver!\" \"You were lost.\" \"I saw you.\" \"And here you are!\" \"I found you.\" \"You are not lost.\" \"And your father...\" \"Your father!\" \"You know my father?\" \"Where is he?\" \"This way!\" \"He went this way.\" \"Quick!\"\n\"Hey, hey, hey!\" \"Hey! Have you seen an orange fish swim by? It looks just like him! But bigger!\"\n\"Yeah, I saw him, bluey. But I will not tell you where he went... and there is no way you will make me.\"\n\"Mine.\"\n\"Aah! Okay! I will talk! He went to the fishing grounds!\"\n\"Aah! Hey, look out! I am sorry. I am just trying to get home.\"\n\"Matthew!\" \"Matthew!\" \"Matthew!\"\n\"Oliver?\"\n\"Matthew!\"\n\"Oliver!\"\n\"Matthew!\"\n\"Oliver! I am coming, Oliver!\"\n\"Matthew!\"\n\"Oliver!\"\n\"Thank goodness. It is okay, child. It will be okay.\"\n\"Turn around! You are going the wrong way!\"\n\"Aah! Look out!\"\n\"Oh, my... Help! Help!\"\n\"Fiona! Come on! Help! Help! Help! Help! Get us out!\"\n\"Aah! No, no, no! Fiona!\"\n\"Matthew, I know what to do! Oliver!\"\n\"No!

I can do this.\"\n\"You are right. I know you can. Lucky fin! Now, go! Hurry! Tell all the fish to swim down!\"\n\"Well?\" \"You heard my child!\" \"Come on!\" \"Emma, you have to tell everybody to...\" \"Swim down together!\" \"Do you understand what I'm saying to you?\" \"Swim down!\" \"Everybody swim down!\" \"Come on, you have to swim down!\" \"Down!\" \"Swim down!\" \"Swim down!\" \"Swim down!\" \"Swim down!\" \"Swim down!\" \"Don't give up!\" \"Keep swimming!\" \"Just keep swimming!\" \"That's it!\" \"It's working!\" \"Keep swimming!\" \"Keep swimming!\" \"Keep swimming!\" \"Just keep swimming!\" \"Keep swimming!\" \"Come on, Mom!\" \"You're doing great, child!\" \"That's my mom.

I'm so sorry, Zachary.\" \"Hey, guess what?\" \"What?\" \"Sea turtles...\" \"I met one. And it was very old.\" \"Very old? Yep. My teacher said they only live to be 100.\" \"Your teacher? Do you think I would cross the entire ocean... and not know as much as your teacher? Ha ha ha! It was very old! Not 100! Time for school! Get up! Let's go! I'm gonna win! No, you're not! I did it! Aw, my own child beats me! Climb aboard, explorers. The animal looks over to another animal and says... \"With these, who needs this?\" Hello, Zachary. Who's this? New student. I'm from another place, dude! Sweet! Totally. Did you really do all the things you say you did? Don't be alarmed. We wanted to make sure our newest member got home safely. \"Thank you, friends.\" \"See you next week.\" \"Keep learning.\" \"Remember, fish are friends...\" \"Not food!\" \"Goodbye!\" \"Hold on, here we go!\" \"Next stop... learning!\" \"Goodbye, child!\" \"Have fun!\" \"Goodbye, Parent!\" \"Oh!\" \"Mr. Ray, wait.\" \"I forgot something.\" \"Love you, Parent.\" \"I love you too, child.\" \"Parent?\" \"You can let go now.\" \"Sorry.\" \"Go have an adventure.\" \"Goodbye!\" \"See you later, friends!\" \"Goodbye, Samuel!\" \"Nathan.\" \"Goodbye, Nathan!\" \"See you after school, Diana!\" \"Goodbye, Parent!\" \"Goodbye, child!\" \"Quentin, I don't understand it.\" \"This thing has a lifetime promise... and it breaks!\" \"I had to clean the tank myself, take all the fish out... put them in bags, and...\" \"Where did the fish go?\" \"Come on, Jessica!\" \"Hurry!\" \"You can do it!\" \"That's it.

{"text": "Adam and Benjamin were pilots. Adam said, \"Even your plane isn't able to go that fast.\" Benjamin said, \"I fixed the engines myself.\"\nAdam asked, \"You never told me why your plane was stopped by police.\" Benjamin said, \"My brother and I were carrying some dangerous things. I thought I could get to our place faster by going through a place we weren't allowed to go. But I quickly learned there is no easy path through that place. We were lucky to escape, but we had to pay a price.\"\nAdam asked, \"They took your plane?\" Benjamin said, \"And the dangerous things too. My brother never forgave me. I've been trying to get my plane back ever since.\"\nAdam asked, \"What are you doing?\" Benjamin said, \"Don't worry. We'll meet up with our friend on time.\"\nAdam said, \"I'm hungry.\" Benjamin said, \"Our food will be here soon.\"\nAdam said, \"I wasn't talking about food. I'm working as fast as I can. The medicine should help you feel better.\"\nBenjamin said, \"There's an easier way. You have the cure.\"\nThe doctor said, \"It's not right for me to give you that. This sickness of yours was caused in an unnatural way. We can't be sure the cure would help.\"\nBenjamin said, \"I want to try.\" The doctor said, \"Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you. You're messing up my medicine! You need to rest again.\" Benjamin said, \"No more needles!\"\nSomeone knocked on the door. Benjamin said, \"One of us should answer that. It could be news about our friend.\"\nThe doctor answered, \"Come in.\"\nA friend said, \"I brought you some food, just in time.\" The friend asked, \"How are you two doing? Have you found our friend yet?\"\nThe doctor said, \"She has a small fever, nothing to worry about.\"\nThe friend said, \"Is that food? I had the chef make you some...\"\nThe doctor interrupted, \"She's not feeling well.\"\nThe friend said, \"Call if you need anything. What have you found?\" \"More small lights.\" \"There is a ship on the land.\" \"It seems to have broken, but it's not from the FR country.\" \"Is someone alive?\" \"One.\" \"Talk to them.\" \"Hello?\" \"Sorry to bother you, but we're looking for a ship from the FR country.\" \"Have you seen one?\" \"How much did the bad people offer you?\" \"Bad people?\" \"Look, there must be some kind of mistake here.\" \"We're looking for our captain.\" \"Your captain.\" \"He has a big price.\" \"He's probably far away by now.\" \"Nathan, how close are we to the bad place?\" \"Less than six light-years.\" \"If that person from the FR country is looking to get some kind of reward... we better find him before he gets there.\" \"Go there.\" \"Take us fast.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"What are you doing here?\" I need your help. You shouldn't have brought him. You think I would have come here if I had a choice? I need a thing for the ship. And I suppose you have no way of paying for it. Do you know who this is? He's the only prisoner who's ever escaped from a bad place. The bad people are offering a lot to get him back. Tell him. Tell him! If I give you the thing, you have to promise never to come back here. Of course I'm coming back. You're going to be my first helper. That was years ago. I work here now. Cleaning things for ships? Is that how your children should see you? It's better than hunting bad people! You think that I enjoy spending my time with bad people like him? I have work to do. Please! Don't turn your back on me again. We can get the ship back. You won't want that ship after you see it. Why not? The bad people took all the good parts. Every power thing, every tube. The engines? They're gone. I'll give you the thing... but after that, I want you to leave. What do you plan to do now? Get that thing and put it in. And then? I suppose you'll give me to the bad people. I'll be... hurt with one of those bad swords of theirs. And you'll get your 9,000 money. But it won't get you the ship back. \"What are you trying to say?\" \"The bad people took your vehicle, your job... damaged your relationship with your brother.\" \"And what do you get in return?\" \"A lot of money.\" \"It does not seem like a fair trade to me.\" \"What choice do I have?\" \"I told you, if I let you go, they would harm me.\" \"Maybe not.\" \"Have you ever been aboard that person's vehicle?\" \"Twice.\" \"Why?\" \"I beg your pardon?\" \"Let me out.\" \"You know I cannot do that.\" \"The heat, it is too much!\" \"If I lower the temperature, the medicine will become solid.\" \"I do not want your medicine!\" \"Open the door!\" \"I assure you, you will feel much better in just a few minutes.\" \"Open it!\" \"This will only take a moment.\" \"Your body imbalance is growing worse.\" \"If we do not treat it, the damage to your body system... could be permanent.\" \"You said it yourself, it could harm you!\" \"Stay away from me.\" \"One injection. That is all I ask.\" \"Very well... you are free to go.\" \"The code to unlock is 4-2-8-6-4.\" \"Medical ethics prevent me from treating patients against their will.\" \"4-2-8-6-4!\" \"Doctor to the Bridge.\" \"Thomas here.\" \"You may want to evacuate that area. She is still in this section. The Doctor says she is not well... so use caution.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Henry! I need your assistance. We have been very worried about you. Let us get you back to the doctor.\" \"I cannot return to the doctor. He is refusing to treat me.\" \"How long has it been?\" \"I beg your pardon?\" \"Since you have done that thing.\" \"I have seen the way you look at me. On the Bridge.\" \"Why do we not discuss this in another room?\" \"My room would be more comfortable.\" \"Doctor Samuel was very insistent. Follow me.\" \"Welcome. The group never forgets its enemies.\" \"What about my payment? A lot of money. We agreed to more.\" \"Did we? That is blood money. I hope you enjoy it.\" We are being called, Commander. It is the YR ship. \"What?\" \"Let Emma in.\" \"I've got them.\" \"Go that way, number seven.\" \"Set a way.\" \"Go to being ready.\" \"Where do you think you'll go, child?\" \"There isn't a place nearby.\" \"Emma won't get far.\" \"Stop going.\" \"Should I get ready to fight?\" \"No.\" \"I want Emma alive.\" \"I see Emma. Far away.\" \"What about the bad people?\" \"They're going after Emma.\" \"They're getting ready to fight.\" \"Fight them!\" \"Get Emma.\" \"They're not making it easy.\" \"Matthew?\" \"I'm doing the best I can, Ethan.\" \"Their fighting places are very strong. Got it! Bring Emma in.\" Their fighting is done. The safe place? Safe and good. The safe place two.

{"text": "Once upon a time, there were 2 clownfish, Adam and Charlotte. Charlotte said, \"Adam, when I asked for an ocean view, I did not think I would get the whole ocean!\" Adam replied, \"A fish can breathe out here. Did I deliver, or did I deliver?\" Charlotte said, \"You delivered, and it was not easy. Many other clownfish wanted this place.\" Adam said, \"You like it, don't you?\" Charlotte answered, \"Yes, I do. But do we really need so much space?\" Adam said, \"These are our children we are talking about. They deserve the best. Look, they will wake up and see a big animal right by their window.\" Charlotte cautioned, \"You will wake the children.\" Adam whispered, \"They are dreaming. We still need to name them.\" Charlotte suggested, \"Let's name one Nemo.\" Adam agreed, \"OK, one Nemo. But I want most to be named after me.\" Charlotte said, \"In a few days, we will be parents. What if they don't like me?\" Adam reassured her, \"Out of so many, at least one will like you.\" Just then, there was danger, and Adam told Charlotte to go inside for safety. But sadly, something terrible happened to Charlotte. Adam was left alone with their eggs, feeling very sad. A father and son fish were getting ready for the son's first day of school. The father said, \"Sea turtles can live to be very old.\" \"If I ever meet a sea turtle, I'll ask how old it is,\" said the son. \"After I talk to the shark, OK?\"\n\n\"Hold on,\" said the father. \"Wait to cross the road.\" He took his son's fin. \"Dad, you're not going to be scared, like at the petting zoo with the snail, are you?\" asked the son.\n\n\"I don't know where we're supposed to go,\" said the father. \"Bye, Mom!\" said the son. \"I'll pick you up after school.\"\n\nSome other fish teased the son about his small fin, but the father explained he was born with it. \"We call it his lucky fin,\" he said. The father told his son not to be upset about his different tentacle, saying \"I'm a bit different too.\" Let's name the zones, the zones, the zones. Let's name the zones of the open sea. Mr. Adam! Come on, Emma. You better stay with me. Deep, very deep, too deep for you and me to see. I wonder where my school has gone? We're under here! There you are. Climb aboard, young learners. Oh, exploring knowledge is so fun when you think thoughts that are easy. Nora, you can go now. Hello. Who is this? I'm Emma. Emma, all new young learners must answer a simple question. OK. You live in what kind of place? A round place. A round home. OK, don't worry. Welcome aboard, young learners. Just so you know, she has a little fin. I find if she is having trouble swimming, I let her take a break for some time. Nora, it's time for you to go now. Don't worry. We're gonna stay together as a group. OK, young ones, come up front. And remember, we keep our bodies to ourselves. Aw, too bad! Bye, Emma! Bye, Nora! Bye, child! Be safe. You're doing pretty well for a first-timer. You can't hold on to them forever, can you? I had a tough time with my oldest at the deep area. They got to grow up - The deep area? They're going to the deep area? What are you, silly? Why don't we make them not safe now and not good? Hey, David, calm down. Don't tell me to be calm, silly person. Silly person? For a funny fish, he really isn't that funny. Pity. Let's name the living things, the living things, the living things. Let's name the living things that live in the sea. There's sponges, jellies, sea flowers, more jellies, sea plants, combs, mossy plants, three snails, crabs, prickly stars, and some fish like you and me. Come on, sing with me. Just the girls this time. \"Do you?\" \"Do you want to fight?\" \"I am afraid now.\" \"What?\" \"Wait a minute.\" \"Stop following me, OK?\" \"What?\" \"You are showing me where the boat went.\" \"A boat?\" \"Hey, I have seen a boat.\" \"A boat?\" \"Hey, I have seen a boat.\" \"It passed by not long ago.\" \"It went this way.\" \"It went this way.\" \"It went this way.\" \"Follow me.\" \"Wait a minute.\" \"What is happening?\" \"You already told me which way the boat was going.\" \"I did?\" \"Oh, no.\" \"If this is some kind of joke, it's not funny.\" \"And I know funny.\" \"I'm a fish with a red nose.\" \"No, it's not.\" \"I know it's not.\" \"I'm very sorry.\" You see, I forget things quickly.\" I forget things quickly.\" \"I don't believe this.\" \"No, it's true.\" I forget things almost right away. It happens in my family. At least, I think it does. Where are they?\" Can I help you?\" There is something wrong with you - really. You are wasting my time. I have to find my child.\" Hello. Well, hi! My name is Bruce. It's all right. I understand. Why trust a big fish, right? So, what are a couple of small fish like you doing out so late? We're not doing anything. We're not even out. Great! Then how would you small fish like to come to a little party I'm having? You mean, like a party? Yeah, right. A party. What do you say? I love parties. That sounds like fun. Parties are fun, and it's tempting, but - Oh, come on, I insist. OK. That's all that matters. Hey, look, balloons. It is a party. Mind your distance, though. Those balloons can be dangerous. You wouldn't want one of them to pop. Metal thing! Yummy food! There you are, Bruce. Finally. We have guests. It's about time, friend. We have already eaten the snacks and I'm still hungry. We almost had a big meal. Come on, let's get this over with. Right, then. Hello, little friend. You are very pretty. Adam found you struggling in the big blue ocean, and he saved you. Has the medicine made you sleepy yet? We are ready to start. You like bubbles! Slow down. There is nothing to worry about. He is scared. Adam wants to go home. Do you know where his dad is? Your dad is probably back at the pet shop. Pet shop? No, Adam is from the ocean. The ocean? He has not been cleaned yet. Frank! Yes. Clean him! Yes. Ocean. The sea. Good. There, he is clean. Wow, the big blue ocean. What is it like? Big and blue? Aunt Emma will help if you need anything. Or if Emma is not here, you can talk to her sister Fiona. Hi, how are you? Don't listen to Fiona, she is silly. We have a new friend. Can't hear you, Penelope. I said we have a new friend. Oh boy. What do we have? Fixing a tooth, and from the pictures, it will not be easy. Are the tools ready? What tool did he use to start? The sharp drill. He likes to use that one lately. I can't see, Fiona. You are too close. Now he is using a special technique. He is using a special tool. That is not the special tool. It has a different shape. Clearly the special tool. No, no, the different tool. The special tool! The different tool! There I go. \"Hey, what's the matter?\" \"What's the matter?\" \"While they're doing their silly little actions...\" \"I am far from home with a fish that can't remember her name!\" \"I bet that's frustrating.\" \"Meanwhile, my child is out there.\" \"Your child Benjamin?\" \"Nemo?\" \"But it doesn't matter because no fish... in this entire ocean is going to help me.\" \"Well, I'm helping you.\" \"Wait right here.\" \"Friends!\" \"Is he bothering you again?\" \"No, no. He's a good guy. Go easy on him. He's lost his child Benjamin.\" \"Any of you heard of PS city, 42 Wallaby Way, SY country?\" \"SY country?\" \"Oh, sure! Ted here's got family in SY country. Don't you, Ted?\" \"Sure do!\" \"Oh! Hey! They know SY country!\" \"You wouldn't know how to get there, would you?\" \"You want to follow the big water flow. That's the big water flow. Big flow. Can't miss it. It's in...that direction.\" \"And then you follow that for about...\" I don't know. What do you guys think? \"A long way?\" \"That little trip will put you right past SY country.\" \"Great! That's great! Dory, you did it!\" \"Oh, please, I'm just your little helper. Helping along. That's me.\" \"Friends, thank you.\" \"Don't mention it! Just loosen up, OK, buddy?\" \"Oh, you guys. You really nailed him.\" \"Bye.\" \"Hey, ma'am. One more thing. When you come to this deep place, swim through it, not over it.\" \"Deep place... through it, not over it. I'll remember.\" \"Hey, hey! Hey, wait up, partner! Hold on! Wait, wait, wait! I gotta tell you something.\" \"Nice deep place.\" \"OK, let's go.\" \"No, no. Bad deep place. Come on, we'll swim over this thing.\" \"Whoa, partner. Little red flag going up. Something's telling me to swim through it, not over it.\" \"Nora!\" \"We're having fun now.\" \"That's what we're doing.\" \"But we're being careful at the same time.\" \"I can do this.\" \"Just be careful.\" \"Yeah, careful I don't make you laugh when I win!\" \"I don't think so!\" \"Give it up, little one.\" \"You can't beat me.\" \"I was made for speed.\" \"The question is, Nora, are you hungry?\" \"Hungry?\" \"Yeah.\" \"'Cause you're about to see my bubbles!\" \"Move to the left!\" \"Right there!\" \"The little fish is the winner!\" \"We did it!\" \"Look at us!\" \"Nora?\" \"Oh, no.\" \"Nora!\" \"Nora!\" \"Am I out?\" \"No, you're doing well!\" \"You're actually winning!\" \"But you have to stay awake. Where does P. live? P... WA way, NE city... That's it! WA way... Stay awake! Stay awake! Stay awake! Stay awake! Stay...awake! Awake. P. Awake. 42 WA Way. Wake up. Nemo... Wake up. Nemo... You miss your dad, don't you, little one? Yeah. You're lucky to have someone out there looking for you. He's not looking for me. He's scared of the ocean. Lily, any movement? He's had four drinks. It's gotta be soon. Keep watch. My first try - landed on tools. I was aiming for the toilet. Toilet? All drains lead to the ocean, kid. Wow. How many times have you tried to get out? I've lost count. Fish aren't meant to be in a box, kid. It does bad things to you. Bubbles! Bubbles! Bubbles! Break! He grabbed the book. We have 4.2 minutes! That's your cue, little one. You can do it, kid. We gotta be quick. Once you get in, swim to the bottom... Once you get in, swim to the bottom... and I'll help you through the rest. OK. It'll be easy. Nicely done! \"Can you hear me?\" \"Yes!\" \"Here comes the small rock.\" \"Now, do you see a small hole?\" \"Inside it, you will see a turning fan.\" \"Put that small rock into the fan to stop it turning.\" \"Be careful, David!\" \"I cannot do it!\" \"Gabriel, this is not a good idea.\" \"He will be fine.\" \"Try again!\" \"OK.\" \"That is it, David.\" \"Nice and steady.\" \"I got it!\" \"I got it!\" \"He did it!\" \"That is great, child!\" \"Now swim up the tube and out.\" \"Oh, no!\" \"Gabriel!\" \"David!\" \"Oh, my goodness!\" \"Get him out of there!\" \"What do we do?\" \"Oh, no!\" \"Stay calm, child.\" \"Just do not panic!\" \"Help me!\" \"David, grab hold of this!\" \"No!\" No! No! No! No!\" \"Feed me more!\" \"That is it! David! Grab it!\" \"I got it! Pull!\" \"Gabriel, do not make him go back in there.\" \"No. We are done.\" \"Dude. Dude. Dude. Focus, dude. Dude. He lives. Hey, dude! What happened? Saw the whole thing, dude. First, you were all, like, \"Whoa!\"... and then we were all, like, \"Whoa!\"... and then you were, like, \"Whoa.\" What are you talking about? You, small person. Taking on the jellies. You got serious thrill issues, dude. Awesome. Oh, my stomach. Oh, man. No throwing up on the shell, dude, OK? Just cleaned it. So, Mr. Turtle. Whoa, dude. Mr. Turtle is my father. The name is Crush. Crush? Really? OK, Crush. I need to go to the EA ocean current. EA ocean current? Oh, dude. You are riding it, dude! Check it out! OK, grab shell, dude! Grab what?! Grab what?! Excellent! Excellent! Yes! Stop! Yes! \"Stop!\" \"What brings you here today?\" asked Emma.\n\"Isabel and I need to go to the SY city,\" said Nora.\n\"Isabel!\" \n\"Is she okay?\" asked Emma.\n\"Oh, little Isabel,\" said Nora sadly.\n\"Isabel!\" they called out. \"Isabel!\" \"Isabel!\"\n\"I'm so sorry,\" said Nora. \"This is all my fault.\"\n\"Twenty-nine, thirty!\" called out Alice. \"Ready or not, here I come!\"\n\"There you are!\" said Alice. \"Catch me if you can!\"\n\"Isabel?\"\n\"Nice wave!\" said Alice as she splashed in the water. \"Up you go! Up you go! Up you go!\"\n\"Oh, my goodness!\" said Hannah.\n\"Stop the boat, Hannah,\" said Victoria. \"Let us see what Jack does swimming alone.\"\n\"That was so cool!\" said Jack. \"Hey, Mom, did you see that? Did you see me? Did you see what I did?\"\n\"You did great, Jack!\" said Hannah. \"Give me a high five.\" \n\"Jellies!\" exclaimed Jack. \"Sweet!\"\n\"You must have done something good,\" said one jelly creature. \"You rock, dude!\"\n\"It's awesome!\" said the jelly creature. \"The little ones are just eggs. We leave them on a beach to hatch, and then they find their way back to the big ocean. All by themselves?\"\n\"But how do you know when they're ready?\" asked Jack.\n\"You never really know,\" said the jelly creature. \"But when they know, you'll know.\"\n\"Look, everybody!\" called out a child. \"I know that creature! It's a jelly creature!\"\nThe children gathered around the jelly creature, asking many questions.\n\"Where are you going?\" asked one child.\n\"My child was taken away from me,\" said the jelly creature sadly. \"I don't want to talk about it.\"\n\"Please?\" asked the children.\"Please?\" \"Please?\" \"Well, OK.\" \"I live on this reef a long, long way from here.\" \"This is gonna be good.\" \"I can tell.\" \"And my child Benjamin...\" \"See, they were mad at me.\" \"And maybe they wouldn't have done it... if I hadn't been so tough on them.\" \"I don't know.\" \"Anyway, they swam out in the open water to this boat... and when they were out there, these divers appeared... and I tried to stop them, but the boat was too fast.\" \"So, we swam out in the ocean to follow them...\" \"They couldn't stop 'em.\" \"And then Benjamin's parent... they swam out to the ocean, and they bump into three ferocious sharks.\" \"They scared away the sharks!\" \"Golly, that's amazing.\" \"And then dives deep down into the dark.\" \"It's very dark down there.\" \"You can't see a thing.\" \"How's it going?\" \"And the only thing they can see down there is the light from this big creature... with sharp teeth.\" \"Well done.\" \"And then they have to blast their way...\" \"So, these two little fish have been... searching the ocean for days on the East AU Current.\" \"Which means that they may be on their way here right now.\" \"That should put them in SY Harbor in a few days.\" \"I mean, it sounds like... this one is gonna stop at nothing till they find their child.\" \"I sure hope they make it.\" \"That's one dedicated parent, if you ask me.\" \"Mine!\" Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Would you just shut up? You're annoying! This parent's been looking for their child Benjamin. Benjamin? They were taken off the reef... Take it! You happy? Mine! Hey, say that again! Something about Benjamin. Mine? Last I heard, they're heading towards the harbor. Brilliant! Are they doing OK? Are they doing OK? Is everything OK? It's OK. I know who you're talking about. Friend? Hey, Friend. I'm sorry I couldn't stop the \"Animal?\" \"A big animal!\" \"You had to ask for help!\" \"And now we're stuck here!\" \"Wow, a big animal.\" \"I talk to animals.\" \"No, you're silly!\" \"You can't talk to animals!\" \"I have to get out!\" \"I have to find my child!\" \"I have to tell him how old some animals are!\" \"Hey... you OK?\" \"There, there.\" \"It's all right.\" \"It'll be OK.\" \"No.\" \"No, it won't.\" \"Sure it will.\" \"You'll see.\" \"No.\" \"I promised him I'd never let anything bad happen to him.\" \"That's a funny thing to promise.\" \"What?\" \"You can't never let anything bad happen to him.\" \"Then nothing bad would ever happen to him.\" \"Not much fun for little Adam.\" \"What's going on?\" \"Don't know. I'll ask it.\" \"Taylor...\" \"What's going on?\" \"I think it says we've stopped.\" \"Of course we've stopped. Stop trying to talk to animals. You'll make things worse.\" \"What is that noise?\" \"Oh, no. Look what you did. The water's going down. It's going down!\" \"Really? You sure about that?\" \"Look! Already it's half empty!\" \"I'd say it's half full.\" \"Stop that! It's half empty!\" \"OK, that one was a little harder. It either said we should go to the back of the throat... or it wants a sweet drink.\" \"Of course it wants us to go there! That's eating us!\" \"How do I taste, big animal? Do I taste good?\" \"Tell it I'm not interested in being food!\" \"OK.\" \"It\" \"Stop talking to it!\" \"What is going on?\" \"I'll check.\" \"What\" \"No more animal talk! You can't talk to animals!\" \"Yes, I can!\" \"No, you can't! You think you can do these things, but you can't, Adam!\" \"OK.\" \"Taylor! It says it's time to let go. Everything's gonna be all right.\" \"How do you know? How do you know something bad isn't gonna happen?\" \"I don't! We're alive! Look! SY city--SY city! SY city again! You were right, Taylor!\" It's a big bird! No! I did not travel far to be eaten! Hey, Henry. Would you look at that? What? What? The sun has barely risen and Frank has already had more than he can handle. Yeah. I think someone should help the poor guy. Yeah, right. Yeah. Don't all fly away at once. Alright, Frank. The fish took your voice? Love a duck! Love a duck! Love a duck! I need to find my child Adam! Adam? He's that fish! The one that's been fighting the whole ocean! I know where your child is. Wait! Come back! Stop! Grace, keep going! He's crazy! I have something to tell you! Mine. Don't make any sudden moves. Hop inside my mouth if you want to live. Hop in your mouth? How does that make me live? Mine? Because I can take you to your child. Yeah, right. No. I know your child. He's orange with a small fin on one side. That's Adam! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Fasten your seat belts! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Everyone hold on! Too loud! Too loud for me! Twinkle, twinkle, little star. Find a happy place! Find a happy place! Find a happy place! Zoe, your uncle will see you now. Alright, let's see those pearly whites. I'm a big fish. They're in the far away river. And a big fish is a fish, just like your present.

{"text": "A kid was going up the stairs. The kid met a man that wasn't there. The kid met a man that wasn't there again. The kid wished the man would go away.\n\nAnother kid asked where the first kid learned that rhyme. The first kid said they made it up when they were little. \n\nThe other kid asked what else the first kid remembered from being little. The first kid told them not to avoid talking about something.\n\nThe other kid asked the first kid to tell them what they remembered about their mom. The first kid said they remembered their mom.\n\nThe other kid asked how long the mom would keep the first kid there. The first kid said as long as the mom was busy.\n\nThe other kid asked if the first kid understood why they were talking. The first kid thought the other kid was supposed to help with headaches and that the first kid needed more than a basic medicine.\n\nThe other kid asked if the first kid remembered some problems. The first kid just said they remembered a fact about a place being a capital city.\n\nThe other kid asked if the first kid caused a problem on their birthday. The first kid said it was their birthday.\n\nThe other kid asked who they were speaking to. The first kid told them to call them whatever they wanted.\n\nThen one kid called out to another kid to wake up, using the name Adam. Adam said he was awake.\n\nThe kid told Adam there was going to be a late night event for an important case because of a found notebook. Adam didn't understand what the kid was talking about.\n\nThe kid explained that a criminal was being taken to a hearing right before being punished because of the found notebook. Adam was upset this was allowed to happen.\n\nThen some kids were playing a game and one kid asked to buy a letter in the game. A grown-up and a child were playing word games in the car. The grown-up asked the child, \"Four times ten equals?\" The child started to answer, but the grown-up said, \"Not now, we need to listen to the weather report.\" The report said there was a big storm coming with rain, lightning, and strong winds. \n\nThe grown-up was driving carefully, following all the safety rules. But then there was a loud noise. \"It's a shoe!\" said the child, seeing something in the road. They had a flat tire. The grown-up was frustrated because the spare tire was not very good. \n\nSuddenly, there was a loud crash. The car had an accident. The child was hurt and bleeding. The grown-up was very upset and crying, \"What have I done?\" \n\nA stranger came to help. The grown-up asked the stranger for a spare battery to call for assistance. But the grown-up was rude when the stranger could not find the battery right away. \"That the judges called me in the early morning to look at a case I already worked on, that I already decided, may make you happy.\" \"But it makes me angry.\" \"When your friend gets here, do what you want, but in the name of decency explain your case!\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Somebody get me a hot drink, plain.\"\n\n\"All right, everyone! Listen up! There was a problem tonight. That's police talk for, 'Someone got hurt.'\" \"Oliver!\" \"Charlotte was hurt.\" \"What? Who's Charlotte?\" \"The actress I was driving.\" \"And where exactly did that happen?\"\n\n\"We don't know, because we can't find all of her body.\" \"What do you mean, you can't find it?\" \"Stay calm. Everything will be all right. Officer Thomas is outside. He was taking a person to jail. Who escaped.\"\n\n\"What are you--? Hold on. Running free!\" \"Will you be quiet so he can talk? This is my home, friend! I'll say what I want!\" \"It's safe here.\" \"It is not safe here! There's a cop here.\" \"Yeah, two cops.\" \"Wait. You're a cop?\" \"I was.\"\n\n\"Shut up, Oliver! It's not safe here! I'm not staying\" \"It's all right. It's okay. Nothing.\" \"Is she okay?\" \"Alice. Alice, will you...? Stop it. Don't do this right now.\" \"What are you doing? Put your arm around your wife.\" \"Actually, she's my wife.\"\n\n\"Everybody just stay here. Stay in this room.\" \"Wait! I'm not staying here if he is.\" \"Yes, you are.\" \"No, I'm not. I'm not.\" \"All right. Oliver? Come with us.\" \"Why? You know the place.\" \"Here's what I know. I'm not a cop. I don't take orders from a mean person!\"\n\n\"Listen. Just stay here, please. Keep everybody calm. He's not gonna get too far. Not in this!\" \"Thomas! What are we chasing here?\" \"Bad things happened to many people. I'll go around this way. Meet you in back.\" \"Is that where you live full-time?\" Adam and Emma had just gotten married. They went to a place to stay, but there was an argument. Adam was angry because Emma lied that she was pregnant. Emma thought Adam was with another woman. They yelled and argued. Adam broke down the door to the room Emma was in. Emma screamed for help. \"Help me!\" \"Help me!\" \"Help me!\" \"Somebody help me!\" \"Is he in there?\" \"Is he in there?\" \"Grace, are you okay?\" \"What happened?\" \"What happened?\" \"What happened?\" \"Oh, no.\" \"Oh dear.\" \"Adam?\" \"Adam?\" \"Adam?\" \"What's going on?\" \"What is wrong?\" \"Oh no!\" \"Come here!\" \"They caught him.\" \"They caught him.\" \"They caught him.\" \"Why are we keeping him here?\" \"Where would you like, Xavier?\" \"I don't know.\" \"I told you to stay in the 3rd room, didn't I?\" \"Did I tell you that? They had a fight! I tried to get them to go back inside! Should we try the radio again? Xavier, just stay here and watch him. Go back and look after Grace. Where are you going? Just do it, please. Thomas? I don't know if I'm okay with guard duty. He's sleeping, Xavier. He's tied to a post. Matthew. Alice? Oh dear. Alice? I don't remember anything. We had an accident. Kevin? Can you keep an eye on Grace for a little? She's awake now. I have to get some medicine to help her. Darling, I need to go get something from my room. Oh no! What's wrong, friend? What do you have in the fridge? You be quiet. What's in there? What's in there? What do you have in there? Be quiet. What is it, hey? Be quiet. You can tell me. I'm good at keeping secrets. I have a big secret myself. What are you doing? Oh no! What are you doing out here? Getting my things. What are you doing? What, I don't get to ask? I'm taking pictures. There have been two bad events. Before all the signs are gone...That's not an answer. You drive cars. What are you doing? Looking to win some \"work very hard\" car driver prize? You're not working anymore. You don't need to be a hero. There's a real officer outside...The one who's lost a bad person? Adam asked, \"What were you scared of?\"\nBenjamin said, \"You would not understand.\" \nAdam said, \"Try me.\"\nBenjamin said, \"Why did you hurt my friend?\"\n\"I did not!\" said Adam.\n\"I do not know how. I went to my room, that is all!\" said Benjamin.\n\"Why did you leave him?\" asked Adam.\n\"Is this your key?\" asked Benjamin, holding up a key.\n\"Number 8?\" said Adam.\n\"Ten, nine, eight, huh?\" said Benjamin. \"This is your key!\"\n\"You cannot say that!\" said Adam.\n\"Those are not my keys!\" said Benjamin.\n\"That is like leading someone to say something wrong,\" said Adam.\n\"Look,\" said Benjamin. \"These are my keys, okay? These are my keys. You see?\"\nAdam asked, \"You have a nice wallet?\"\nBenjamin said, \"It is the woman's wallet. Yes, I took her wallet. After she was gone! After she died! After that, all right? I did not hurt her. And I did not hurt him.\"\nAdam said, \"Let her go, Benjamin.\"\nBenjamin said, \"Get back! You will not blame me.\"\nCameron said, \"Benjamin?\"\nCameron said, \"Get him out of here!\"\nBenjamin said, \"Put it down. I did not hurt anybody. No one! But I do not like bad people!\"\nIf you take one more step - \" said Benjamin.\nBenjamin yelled some bad words.\nBenjamin tried to start a vehicle, but could not.\nAdam said, \"Benjamin, stop!\"\nBenjamin said, \"What is going on?\"\nAdam said, \"Benjamin!\"\nBenjamin shouted, \"Get out of my way, I did not do anything wrong!\"\nCameron called out, \"Benjamin!\" Nine acres, 1 200 trees. Limes and oranges. According to the person who sells houses, the soil needs some work, some areas need looking at, but it's good land. What? It sounds nice. Ed? She's no longer alive. Get him out of here. Come on. Come on, dear. Look at this. Where did you get that? Right here. This doesn't make sense. She died from an accident. Gabriel was an accident, if you believe Liam. Where is seven? Back it up! See, I told you it wasn't me! That's not possible. I was standing right there. I saw what happened. We all saw what happened. He ran out. Nobody could have known he was going to do that. No one human. We're back to that again? It's the spirits, huh? Maybe it's the ghost of the person that Liam put in the freezer. Somebody untie me. Oh no! You know it wasn't me. Come on. Listen. We have to get out. Listen. We have to get out. Take her car and get out. You, her and the child. There's nowhere to go. How much gas do you have? Half a tank. You can drive until early morning on that. Look at me. When you get to where it's flooded, go the other way. I don't know if I can. Get the child and go. Right now. Come on. Thomas. Thomas, come on. Let's go. Get up. What's going on? They can't leave! This way. We'll see you when the storm breaks. Hey! Hey! Hey! They can't leave! Where are they going? Get back here! Go, go, go! They're leaving. They're not leaving. Go! You can't let people leave after four people have been killed! You really think they're people who did something wrong? They're not leaving! That's bad. Wendy! Things to put out fires. Matthew, you got a thing to put out fires? Thing to put out fires! Where? Back there! Nobody in there. Maybe it got so hot, they got cremated. There would be something left. You did this. \"You did this!\" \"You told them to go into the car!\" \"Are you happy?\" \"Where is he?\" \"Nothing.\" \"I give up!\" \"I give up!\" \"What do you want?\" \"What do you want, you bad person?\" \"What do you want from us?\" \"I am turning 30 soon and I just want to go home and grow oranges!\" \"It's your birthday soon?\" \"It's my birthday soon.\" \"The 10th.\" \"Me too.\" \"Me too.\" \"Me too.\" \"Yes.\" \"Adam, May 10th.

What's happening? Please be quiet. He can hear what we're saying? Of course I can hear what you're saying. Edward, you missed your last meeting. Where have you been? Did I black out again? Try and think back. Where have you been? All right. I was driving this actress and we got stuck at the place to stay. There was a storm. We couldn't get out because of the storm. What happened at the place to stay? People started dying. And then their bodies-- It didn't make any sense. They disappeared. Edward, I'd like to show something to you, if I may. Do you recognize this person? No. That person, Edward, is a bad person with a troubled life. The bad person was arrested years ago and convicted of the murder of many people in a bad incident. The bad person did this. Detective, please. \"Adam, listen to me.\" \"When a child has a bad experience, their mind may break into different parts.\" \"That's exactly what happened to Matthew.\" \"He developed a condition that is commonly known as Multiple Personality Problem.\" \"Why are you telling me this?\" \"Because you, Adam are one of his personalities.\" \"What?\" \"Oh my!\" \"Why am I tied up?\" \"Keep calm.\" \"Where is my face?\" \"That is your face.\" \"Why am I tied up?\" \"Keep calm.\" \"Please.\" \"Oh my!\" \"Where is my face?\" \"Stay calm.\" \"No!\" \"I'm not going to stay calm!\" \"Why am I tied up like this?\" \"Who are all these people?\" \"What happened?\" \"They don't exist, Adam.\" \"You were all created by Matthew as a child.\" \"You're not telling the truth!\" \"Think about what you know.\" \"Everyone with a name like a state.\" \"No.\" \"Everyone with the same birthday.\" \"Your times when you can't remember.\" \"No!

You don't live anywhere.\" \"I know this is hard to understand, but the face you saw in that mirror is the face I've always seen when I talk to Adam or others you've met tonight.\" \"Matthew is having a medical treatment.\" It makes all his personalities meet one another for the first time.\" I knew there would be violence and with it, the number of personalities would be reduced.

{"text": "Once upon a time, a little girl named Charlotte saw a big rainbow over a river. Her mother told her, \"A rainbow is the door to heaven. When people die, they go to heaven through that door.\"\n\nLater, Charlotte's father passed away, and her mother went abroad. Charlotte learned taekwondo when she was seven years old. She kept her parents' letters and diaries in a box. Whenever her mother read the letters, she wept.\n\nOne morning, Charlotte's friend Fiona called her. Fiona invited Charlotte to go to an art museum and a play with her and David.\n\nThrough Fiona, Charlotte got to know David. For two months, Charlotte wrote letters to David for Fiona. Charlotte liked writing childish letters to David.\n\nAfterwards, Fiona joined a theater group to get closer to David. Charlotte felt heartbroken because David never looked at her. She wished she could put a spell on him to look at her.\n\nDuring a theater practice, David performed very well. Fiona loved guys who were into their work. Charlotte saw David's great performance. No, that's not right! The dark night has made your shadow appear on my window. Talking about me? It's nothing, Cameron. You know Charlotte, right? She was with me when I first came here. Yes, it's been a long time. Hello. A lot of girls like him. Not just Grace. Even the woman working at the student's hall likes him. Rachel. Samuel. Oh, when I opened the window early this morning, the nice breeze signaled autumn coming. I'll put that wind in the letter and send it to you. Nice breeze? That's so common. I guess I'll look at it as a classic. Rachel! Samuel came to me suddenly, someone I've never talked to. Please write me a letter. He heard the rumor that I write for others. Samuel is a friend who grew a lot during the break. To who? To my future wife. Future wife? She's my dad's friend's daughter. They set us up. You're lucky. You don't have to ask girls out. I'm tired of it. I'm not the type to date one girl. If she mails me, he wants to check it. He wants to know everything. He acts just like a police officer. Oh no. She's pretty, huh? But since she's from a important family, she'll be shallow. Drive! Drive! You let them slip away. Country boys are slow. SW town isn't a big city, NE city is. But we have a town hall. You catch them and I'll draw them. Look carefully, friend. Let's go. What are you doing? She's Oliver's granddaughter. I heard she's from SW town. Wait, you're from SW town, right? Yeah. We can never dream of having her. Oliver's son is an important person. So she's from an important family. Then is she an important person's son, friend? Oh...She's... She's waving. Let's wave back! Hello! Hi! I found one! Let me see! Let's see. It stinks. I got one. It's a big one. It sure ate a lot of cow waste. It's a bug. A bug? But I've never seen one. Do you want this? Adam and Bella were friends. One day, Adam said, \"Let's go explore the forest!\"\nBella said, \"But I hurt my leg. Can you carry me?\" \nAdam said, \"Yes, get on my back!\" Adam carried Bella into the forest.\nIt started to rain. Adam said, \"Don't worry, I will keep you dry.\"\nAfter the rain stopped, Adam saw a firefly. He caught it and showed it to Bella.\nBella said, \"Thank you for the fun adventure!\" Adam smiled and they went home. Emma and Olivia were friends in school. Emma said, \"When the sun shines, I think of you. When the moon is out at night, I think of you.\" Olivia asked, \"Really? Is that what you mean?\" She felt happy that Emma liked her so much. She asked Emma to tell her again tomorrow.\n\nLater in class, the teacher said, \"Hand in your homework after lunch. If you didn't do it, go to the bathroom and work on it!\" The students lined up.\n\nAfter class, Benjamin asked Emma, \"Want to learn a dance with me? My dad's friend suggested we meet some girls in a fun activity.\" Emma wasn't sure. Then Olivia introduced her friend Nora to Benjamin and Emma. Nora said she wanted to be on TV when she grew up.\n\nThe teacher taught them a dance. Nora and Emma whispered to each other and giggled. Emma repeated a tongue twister after Nora a few times. Then they had to leave and go their separate ways home. \"Is that true?\" \"I'm trying to understand my feelings.\" \"My eyes were looking ahead, but my heart was confused.\" \"Can I trust those words?\" \"Can I think of it as a promise?\" \"Yes.\" \"There's only one that I love.\" \"That one is me, right?\" \"Yes, I love you.\" \"I swear that I love you.\" \"I love you, too.\" \"David, I love you so much.\" \"David!\" \"What are you doing?\" \"I didn't finish my words, and then you say my name?\" \"You can't change your words like that.\" \"You ruined everything!\" \"David, I wasn't acting. It was my true feelings.\" \"I love you. Love is more important than a play.\" \"I love you.\" \"After the play, David and I went on a date.\" \"We decided to go to the river where my mother's memories were.\" \"Emma? No, I'm her daughter. My name is Grace.\" \"Is that so?\" \"I must have made a mistake.\" \"But you look so much like your mom.\" \"I delivered a lot of your mom's letters.\" \"Thank you, sir.\" \"I know well what happened to my parents later.\" \"Students and citizens!

When he'd run out of things to use, she'd take over. The most pretty woman you'll ever see. That's where all the trouble began. She was with Thomas. And when Thomas saw that she was with the singer, well, he went crazy. He hunted him down and fought the singer to the end. And then she put a bullet in his heart. Only he didn't die. I don't know what happened after that. Would you like some? No. Maybe Thomas caught up with them, or the bad groups. But like I said, the man is a famous person, a legend. And if he's still living, he's the one you want. Well that is truly unbelievable. Well, I'm not big on telling stories. Where's the money? That's the reason I'm here. I couldn't find a small bag for $10,000 in cash. It'll do. Adam said, \"I gave you money but you said no.\"\nBenjamin said, \"I do not want too much money. A small amount is enough.\"\nAdam said, \"You would not let me give you a lot of money, but would you let me give you a little?\"\nBenjamin said, \"Yes, a little money is okay. But I would not want too much.\"\nAdam said, \"Would you really stop me if I tried to give you a lot of money?\"\nBenjamin said, \"Yes, I would stop you.\"\nAdam came to the FR country. He met Cameron. Cameron said, \"I made this for you.\"\nAdam said, \"I should go back home instead of staying here.\"\nCameron said, \"You speak our language?\"\nDavid said, \"Bad people tried to hurt my family. We must stop the bad people.\"\nDavid introduced Cameron to Benjamin. David said, \"We hear you want to work with us.\"\nBenjamin said, \"Yes, this is a lucky day for me.\"\nDavid asked, \"Did you order the food?\"\nBenjamin said, \"Does it have a name?\"\nDavid said, \"They call him The.\"\nBenjamin understood what the name meant.\nDavid said, \"Tell the bad people that The is here.\"\nCameron was not sure about that.\nDavid said, \"Are you a good person or a bad person?\"\nCameron said, \"I am a good person.\"\nDavid said, \"Then do what I say.\"\nCameron was playing a tune.\nBenjamin said, \"My brother taught me that tune. But I hurt my brother.\"\nDavid already knew that information.\nDavid said, \"The bad people really want to hurt you. Is there anyone who does not want to hurt you?\"\nBenjamin said, \"You tell me.\"\nDavid said, \"I need you to hurt a person.\" \"I'm just walking around, friend.\" \"This place is my area, I'm covering it.\" \"I make things happen, and they happen.\" \"I set things up and watch them unfold.\" \"Have them meet me at the show at 5 p.m. What?\" \"Why would I want that?\" \"Why would I want bubble gum?\" \"Okay.\" \"Yeah, yeah, yeah.\" \"Okay, this should be enough for us for a long time.\" \"So I don't ever want to see you again.\" \"Go away.\"\n\"Hello.\" \"Hello.\" \"The two groups working together. Now, if that isn't cooperation, I just don't know what is.\" \"I'm retired from my old job.\" \"A real worker never fully retires. They just take it a little easier.\"\n\"Why are we talking?\" \"You tracked down the bad guy for two years when he was doing illegal things.\" \"Lots of effort but no results.\" \"Well, he... He is, in fact, sitting directly behind you.\" \"I know. He's been living here for six years. Can't be caught now.\"\nDid you know that most workers never even see a top criminal for their whole careers? You caught two, didn't you? And now your third is sitting very close. Now, retired or not that has really got to make you want to do something. I'm a regular person now. Didn't he kill that friend of yours? What was the name? Yes. The bad guy is from this country. He cannot be taken away for crimes done in another country.\nDo you know of a doctor? Worked for the criminal group. This doctor gave your friend drugs, day after day so that they could hurt him for two weeks before he died. You must have known that. The doctor himself having dinner with your target. I wonder what it is they're up to now. Two weeks of hurting, for your dead friend for the job you didn't finish. Now, are you really going to let it slip away again?\nI'd like you to try my food because it's the best.\n(Announcer) It's Happy Time! Get your song for a small price. A kiss for a higher price. Adam and Benjamin worked together. \"A show for only a small price!\" Adam said. \"Where have you been?\" asked Benjamin. \"Far away,\" replied Adam. \"Still having fun?\" Benjamin asked. \"Let me get Frank,\" said Adam. \"I'm here for my music tool,\" said Benjamin. \"It's his last night.\" \"They're letting him go.\" \"Hey Frank, it's me.\" \"Still drinking.\" \"Like a fish.\" \"I guess we haven't changed much.\" \"I didn't think you'd ever come back for this thing.\" \"Neither did I.\" \"Are we ready?\" \"I'll let you know.\" \"Bring him sober. We're gonna need him, so coffee. Lots of coffee.\" \"Sometimes a big change is exactly what's needed to clean up the system. One giant fix, which just so happens to be my area of work.\" Benjamin said, \"Do you like this? The animal is hurt before the leader even steps in. Now, is that victory? Of course it is. Wanna know the secret to winning? Changing the game to your favor.\" Benjamin continued, \"Go collect. The leader is giving a speech on a special day in the town center. He'll be alone in the main building in the center. Very easy access to him if somebody can get you in. You're the man who can do that.\" Adam replied, \"I am not the prince. I am the man behind the prince. I've served princes before and betrayed them too. You're a good helper. I like you. The rest upon completion. Nice meeting you.\" Every time, Benjamin thought. What do you want in life? Adam, how long have you and I worked together? A long time. And in a way, I almost have a tiny bit of respect for you. Almost. But you need to stop messing around. Now, do you have the information that I need or do you not? I have what you need. I'm just enjoying this temporary position of power. That make you nervous? You know that withholding important information from an officer is a serious offense. Especially when that officer has paid well for it and wouldn't think twice about hurting you badly. \"I'm fine.\" \"Go away.\" \"I am fine.\" \"Go away.\" \"You're off the hook.\" \"Leave me alone.\" \"That spill just cost you your life.\" \"A little help.\" \"Okay.\" \"I know it's on you somewhere.\" \"Somewhere.\" \"All right.\" \"Time to get messy.\" \"Well, I suppose I should thank you for not putting it in a bad place. However. You're gonna pay for that, officer. Why doesn't my key work anymore? It's too small. Stand back. I just... I brought you a gift. I'm still mad at you. And trust me, it wasn't easy to get. So... Come closer and I'll thank you. Are you trying to make me happy? Closer, I said. How about that little tip-off? It promises you a big arrest and an award. Even from your agency. I'm impressed. But then what? Want to hear my plan? Either that or I start target practice. Okay. The new leader is trying to stop the bad group. And the bad group wants a general named Marquez to take power while the leader is visiting CU city. Now, I have someone inside to make sure that Marquez never takes power. The last piece is the bad group. Your tip-off ensures that the bad group is out while the battle happens. After this change, I will calmly take the money that the bad group is prepared to pay Marquez for the power change. You want me to go with you? You detain the bad group with the information that you have, then you join me and share the rewards. You meet me two nights from now at LP place, 10 p.m. Sharp and bring only what's important to you. Oh, yeah. It might get a bit dangerous there. So... Can you do it? I can do it. I want my key back. Testing. One, two. Testing. Hello? Can you hear me now? Okay... Loud sounds. Did you gather your team? You know I did. Why are you having me followed? Oh, yeah, that. Let's just call that making sure you do it, shall we? Adam said, \"Because Cucuy also...\" \"...keeps us safe.\" \"From what?\" \"Bugs?\" \"Oh, no, you should not bother him because he is a wild animal.\" \"And he is not happy that you hurt his friend.\" \n\n\"Oh, yes, I have your next job.\" \"Are you the music players?\" \"This is the back door.\" \"Remember it.\" \"Hey, hey, hey, hey.\" \"\"Who are they?\" \"Music players.\" \"Why so heavy?\" \"Built to play loud.\" \"Play something.\" \"Okay.\" \"Let's go. I was afraid you could not play. Of course we can!\n\nWhat we want is help from the people of this place. A person can do a lot alone, but can do better with people helping.\n\nI wonder how much money we will get for this job. A person who wants nothing cannot be beaten.\n\nHey. Will you tell him that this is his last meal? Is there a song you want to hear?\n\nWe just played for the leader, I cannot buy half a drink with this money! It was meant as an honor.\n\nHonor does not matter. We need money. The big job is tomorrow. Enough for all. Even for you, Gabriel.\n\nWhy are you suddenly interested in the big job? What's in it for you? Only getting even. Delayed getting even.\n\nGo practice. Practice? Playing or shooting? What do you think? I do not think. I drink.\n\nYes, hello. I have been watching Cameron and the good Doctor Emma. Agent Ethan, no longer retired. Good man. Welcome back.\n\nI have not seen illegal activities yet. Only that Doctor Emma has a medical procedure scheduled for the Day of the Dead. That is tomorrow.\n\nAlso identified a member of the group as Benjamin. A wanted person. We have been wanting to catch him for some time now.\n\nBenjamin? You sure? I bet my job on it. Well, whatever they are doing, I can guarantee you that it will happen tomorrow. So I suggest you...\n\nWhat is happening tomorrow? If you see an opening, take it. What do you know? Not enough. Get inside. \"I've got nothing.\" \"I gotta get in.\" \"I got nothing.\" \"Try to do something.\" \"I don't have anything to do.\" \"What are you gonna do, silly one?\" \"Benjamin is on the move.\" \"Where are you going?\" \"You're buying food.\" \"This is too easy.\" \"Where are the other kids?\" \"This seems like a trick.\" \"It smells like a trick.\" \"I'm doing something.\" \"Benjamin.\" \"Well, that depends who's asking.\" \"I thought that was you.\" \"Here, let me pay for this.\" \"Oh, well, thanks.\" \"Oh, no.\" \"Is that real?\" \"Yes, it is.\" \"No. What took you boys so long? Hey there, friend. You don't need that. Believe it or not, I'm ready to go. Let's talk over there. After you. I just wanna get out of here. I've been hiding here in the SW country for the last eight years. And I've been working for a group for the last four. I don't have anything. All I have is what I'm wearing. I can't go anywhere. They have power over me, you know? Ryan. I'll take you under watch until we can take you back, where you will face consequences for your actions. In the US country? In the US country. The things that I've had to do for the group are bad. You don't know what Adam's up to? I'm close to the man. I'm real close. But he doesn't let anyone in, that bad person. Can you get him close to Adam? Him? I need your help. Then you get me out of here. Then I'll get you out of here. Him too. Him too. There's people on every corner. Thomas told me you handle safety. I don't work for Thomas anymore. And since I'm from this country, I can do whatever I want. Then I guess I don't work for Thomas neither. Goodbye. There's a price on your head. I'm going to get it. Why don't you just tell Adam everything you know. And then maybe he'll just cut off your hands. And if I don't? You know that old man I killed in your village? What if your whole village was next? Would you kill them? Me? They certainly would. Then I guess I have no choice but to kill you all. You are last. That should put him out for a few days and give him some nasty dreams. You have to relax your fingers. Music is pure, from one's soul. If the soul is pure, the music flows free. And if the soul isn't pure? Then you must practice like a very hard worker. I present to you Mister Monster. Get this rude person out of here. You want me to break his fingers? No. I want you to chop them off. I was just making a joke. I wasn't. Sit, please. So you are the man who brought us the Musician. The man I work for, Mister Sands he is using the Musician to kill General Marcus. So you want to join us here's how it works. There is the bait. There is the trade. A favor for a favor. So the Musician is the trade? You are. This ain't my line of work. This guy's all messed up. General Marcus is arriving! Bring out the Musician! Bring him out to the General! I didn't kill you before. Enough blood had been shed. But I see now... that blood will spill again. General Marcus, the Musician is not here. He escaped. You too will escape. Hey, hey, hey, hey, Lily... Why? Practice shooting, not drinking. We are on. By order of the President, they are searching all vehicles for guns and bad things. That bad person's been blocking all the roads. Take us back another way. By order of the president. Who does this guy think he is? He wants to get rid of me? Fine. I'll get rid of him. Replace him, even. Then I will simply disappear. Hey, let's go, man. Don't put me out completely. Have my men wait outside. Barillo and Doctor Helper must already be inside the building having entered through the back or basement. They should be doing procedure. Good agents. This is going down now. If Barillo wanted to look unrecognizable to authorities he succeeded. \"A big problem was not really the reason for death.\" \"They changed bodies.\" \"Benjamin!\" \"Police.\" \"He was anyway.\" \"Bring him along.\" \"Listen, I cannot do everything myself.\" \"I need someone to go in there with me.\" \"No.\" \"I lost my helper.\" \"Probably dead.\" \"And Ryan, greedy person that he is, told on me and has disappeared.\" \"Plus, I'm pretty sure the bad group is following me.\" \"Now, listen, I have got a good bunch of people stopping Marquez's army but they've got no guns.\" \"I want you to understand me. This is no time to mess up because this is supposed to be the big important part, all right?\" \"Hello?\" \"Hello?\" \"Hello?\" \"Are you there?\" \"Okay, okay, I'm going to get very upset. I would like the special food and a drink with lime.\" Yeah, listen, I need a new way to talk. This one's been found out. Okay? Thank you. I'll be waiting here at the Flying Cow restaurant. That's right. The Flying Cow. You really didn't see it coming, did you? Sorry, child, I told you I wasn't interested in your plan. Too small. Oh, my goodness. Is that Benjamin? That's the new Benjamin. The old Benjamin died a few hours ago. What kind of bad group would have you running its operation? I'm his daughter. You've been watching my operation for some time. I feel it's only fair to warn you that hurting me is crossing the line and you will have every soldier from here to GU country up your backside, mister. So just know that. Luckily for you, nothing you did is worth dying over. We are going to make sure that doesn't happen again. On this special day, I offer you a chance for a new life. That sounded a little extreme for a parade. Soldiers are coming up from the south. Whose? Emiliano Marquez. Well, what do we do? We stay here. This place is strong. It's much easier to defend this place than to chance going out in the open. Nicholas? What are you talking about, \"strong\"? Come here! Just stay clear of those windows, sir. \"You let me handle it,\" said Adam. \"My name is Adam. I work for a big company. I set things up. I watch them happen. I'm living a fun life.\"\n\n\"Oh no!\" \"I'm very sorry about your candy, but listen. I will give you money if you'll help me. It's a dollar. I meant this. I need you to take me to the center of the city. Is someone following you?\"\n\n\"It's hard for me to tell right now because I'm having a bad day. Do you see someone?\"\n\n\"Yes, he's getting close. Listen, have you ever seen one of these? Have you used one? Don't ever, because they're bad. But what I need you to do is aim this at the bad man following us and shoot him.\"\n\n\"Kill him?\" \n\n\"Oh, yes. Very bad. Close?\"\n\n\"Okay. Was that my right or your right?\"\n\n\"Wrong man. Sorry. Look me in the eyes and then kill me. Good boy. Now you're thinking. Take me to the center of the city, where there will be even more money. For you... for our child... for our country.\" \n\n\"In the past, I started from the bottom. Now I realize start at the top. The leader is a good man. I'll go around back. Meet me in five. Watch him.\"\n\n\"We could hurt him. He used to work for the police. He's retired. That doesn't count. I was hurt once. I didn't like it. You know what the bad thing is? They hurt my body. That made me not like the whole thing.\"\n\n\"What should we do with him? Let's go eat and talk about it.\"  \n\n\"Hey child, watch that person. Just lay low. They'll leave us alone.\"\n\n\"What happened?! I don't like military. Get out. Why are we stopping? We can't go further. Why not? Look out there. It's chaos! I can't see! I have no eyes. Well, then listen to it!\" The bad men were trying to hurt the leader. \"Get out now,\" they said. \"I'm not leaving,\" the leader said. \"What do we do?\" \"Use these strong bullets.\" \"What do you want in life?\" \"To stay safe.\" \"Okay, let's go!\"\n\nIt was no longer safe to stay. \"Let's go,\" they said. \"You have a meeting, sir.\" \"We will protect you, sir.\" \"Who are you?\" \"Friends, sir.\"  \n\nThey took the leader to a safe place. \"Look outside! Your people are fighting for you,\" the friends said. They gave the leader new clothes and money to keep him safe.  \n\n\"Your child died,\" they told the leader. \"And you? Dead too. But you are alive, in a hard place.\" \n\nA bad man came. \"Do you know this man? You hurt my friend.\" The bad man wanted to hurt the leader for hurting his friend. \n\nAnother friend came. \"Do you need help?\" he asked. The bad man left. The leader did not know if he was okay. \"You will be.\" \"What do you want in life?\" \"To be happy...\" \"Simple.\" \"No.\"", "hash": "cb5fee30bbece86b6ed478c68b151a165dbc65a74641a933ce1211f6e8adb47f"}
{"text": "\"One day they will link you to this problem.\" \"That bomb was never meant to explode.\" \"None of this was supposed to happen.\" \"I know.\" \"I trust you.\" \"You can stop it now.\" \"If you help me get Kevin, your spouse will get back their job.\" \"That will be because of you.\" \"Mrs. Palmer, please.\" \"Oh no!\" \"What do you want me to do?\" \"There's a knife in the glove box.\" \"Help cut me out.\" \"Come on in.\" \"This is much better.\" \"It's simpler.\" \"We need to be able to explain this.\" \"I need to talk to you, Matthew.\" \"I'll be down in five minutes.\" Matthew. It's important. Excuse me. What is it? It's a file on Patrick. They pulled it up a few minutes ago. Patrick, the man Jack thinks is behind the bomb. There's a record of phone calls he made, as recently as early today, to a soldier named Jonathan. Jonathan was a member of the Snake group. He apparently killed his own people. I know who Jonathan is. The planes have passed over their checkpoint and will reach their targets soon. Our main targets are all military, but one includes a place inside a home area. As smart as our weapons are, there may be some damage. You mean harm to people? Yes, sir. Then it's something we're just gonna have to accept. Ryan. Ryan, this is Mike. I know there's been some confusion today about the audio. Not really. Our teams came to the same conclusion as the other team. Do you know if Jack's still trying to find evidence that the recording was made up? Yes, but he's operating outside our authority. I want you to assist his investigation. Sir, I don't even know where he is. Then find him. I'm not sure why you're asking me to do this. I was told we're at war and to proceed accordingly. We're not at war yet. You have 30 minutes to report back to me the findings of Jack and your efforts. But sir... That's a direct order, Ryan. You have my channel. Call me back on this line. \"Look, I just wanna see my dad and make sure he's OK.\" \"No, he's not here right now.\" \"He won't be back for a couple of hours.\" \"Does he know I'm here?\" \"No.\" \"We'll tell him when he phones in.\" \"Adam insisted we call as soon as we get here.\" \"He's just not reachable now.\" \"I'll have Bella take you back and get you situated.\" \"I'll be there in a minute.\" \"Hey.\" \"It's gonna be OK. OK.\n\nMiss Taylor? I don't know if you're aware of this but... your father came back here after we released him. Why? He wanted to talk to your sister before she was taken away. They brought Madison back here? Yeah. You lied to me? You hurt Rachel? You tried to hurt your own sister? You were willing to do something bad in a big city with many people? You tell me why. Because I need to understand. Tell me that they forced you to do it, that they made you do it, that they threatened you. You can tell me that you didn't know what you were doing. There must be a reason.\n\nThere is no reason, Dad. I can't accept that. I couldn't either. Until I looked into her eyes and she pointed something at me and started to do something bad. Trust me, Dad. She's not gonna give you any answers. She can't. At least, nothing that we could ever understand. Dad... Come on. Let's go.\n\nEmma. You think you'll be safe out there. You won't be.\n\nAdam, it's Thomas. Thomas, you back in play? Yeah. Adam, Madison's here. She's safe. Thank God. Don't tell her what's going on. Just say I'll be back as soon as I can. I will. Adam, this is Ryan. We need to talk. You did something bad. You stopped that thing picking up me and someone else. That person is gone. I hold you responsible. Listen, things have changed. You got full support. Give me your mission details. \n\nI've set up a meeting with someone. We're gonna meet them at the LA place, gate 18. Mrs Taylor will wear something and make them confirm that the places had nothing to do with the bad thing. Stand down until you get some support. \"They're setting up a live sound system.\" \"OK, good.\" \"We are ready to go.\" \"How are you doing, Mrs. Quinn?\" \"What's to prevent Kevin from hurting me?\" \"He won't do anything until he gets Isaac.\" \"But the moment he realizes we don't have Isaac...\" \"I'll be protecting your back.\" \"That's not very comforting considering the condition you're in.\" \"I may not make it out of this.\" \"I'm not gonna lie to you, Mrs. Quinn.\" \"That's a possibility.\" \"I'm doing this for David.\" \"You know that, don't you?\" \"Yes.\" \"I'll tell him that if something happens.\" \"I'll take care of it, Mrs. Quinn.\" \"You've gotta go now.\" \"Mike. Yes, sir. We just finished setting up the sound system. I hope this isn't gonna be a waste of our time. Believe me, Mr. President, so do I. What's going on, Mike? The president and I thought you should be part of this. Along with another person and the lawyer, we will be listening to a live sound system. Of what? A secret plan against Kevin. It appears he was the one who planned today's bad event and the delivery of the secret message. Henry found Kevin. Yes. But... it won't be Henry who'll be talking to Kevin. What difference does it make as long as we get him to admit it? What is it, Mike? It's Quinn who'll be talking to Kevin. I don't understand. It seems that Kevin asked her some time ago. She was part of this. Quinn was working with this man, Kevin? It appears that way, sir. To make a big explosion and start a war? No. It's unclear how much she knew, or how deep she was in it. We just have to hope she can get Kevin to admit it. So now Quinn is working with Henry to stop Kevin? Yes. And at big risk to herself. Scott, don't do anything until I tell you to. We need Isaac. Understood. Where's Isaac? He's safe. Where is he? You lied to me. You wanted this bad thing to happen all along. You used another person and you used me. Yes, I did. Well, now I'm tied to you, and the bad event. \"I want a safe place.\" \"That's your problem.\" \"Well, I just made it yours.\" \"You won't see Henry until I'm safe.\" \"Don't bargain with me.\" \"Don't insult my intelligence.\" \"We got a match on Kevin's voice.\" \"Ryan, you got it. You're not going anywhere till I have Henry.\" \"That doesn't work for me.\" \"I'll call you on this line to give you Henry's location after I'm safely away.\" \"You don't need to know where I'm going.\" \"We're not getting what we need here.\" \"She'll get it for you.\" \"Now there's the matter of the recordings.\" \"They're right here.\" \"Every phone talk between you and me.\" \"No. I want all of them, including CY country.\" \"Why CY country? You had nothing to do with that.\" \"Security.\" \"Security? Once the country goes to war, the government will never let that be exposed.\" Henry is the only one who can hurt us.\" Because he made up the CY country recording.\" Right. You got your proof. Let me go ahead. Get it confirmed from the WH city. She can't stay much longer. Are you satisfied? CTU wants to know if that's enough to prove it. Have you confirmed this is live and the voices have been confirmed? Yes, sir. So that's it. Yes. When I land... I'll call you. Hm. You're bluffing. You don't have Henry, do you? Oh, yes, I do. No, you don't. Scott, take her out. Kill her. Run, Sherry! Come on. Come on. Mrs Palmer, get out of here. Go! Jack Bauer. You've caused me a lot of trouble today, Jack. You're not gonna give me Henry, are you? Our bombers are three minutes from the targets. Starting sequence six one tango one. Target in view. Weapons lock. Are we ok to strike? Are we ok to start? We are waiting for command. Stop the attack. Stop, stop. What do you mean, Kevin's dead? How could that happen? I warned you not to use him. So we did use him and he failed. But it won't matter. Once the war starts we'll be OK. It isn't going to start. \"Why is that?\" \"The leader found out about the secret recording and stopped the attack.\" \"There will not be any war, Matthew.\" \"Well... we need to do this another way.\" \"Another way?\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"You will find out.\" \"It will start today.\" \"It is me.\" \"Go ahead.\" \"The group has cancelled its earlier action.\" \"I have told the secret helpers to keep helping you as the leader.\" \"I see.\" \"I have also quit, right now, and those group members who voted against you have also agreed to quit.\" \"Benjamin. \"People, we came very close to war today. That all of us reacted strongly to the loud noise is understandable. But leaders must be patient beyond human limits. The kind of action we nearly took should only happen after all other ways have been tried. After the strictest proof has been met. By putting me aside so quickly, you lowered those standards. And that was a big mistake. It was not, however, a mistake you are likely to make again. Therefore I do not accept your quits. We have a group to heal today. And all of you play an important role in that healing.\" \"Leader... I do not know what to say.\" \"There is nothing to say. We have work to do.\" \"That will be all.\" \"Jessica, set up a talking time.\" \"When?\" \"As soon as you can. And I want it public. I want to speak to the people directly. They deserve my assurance.\" \"Yes, leader.\" \"Nathan, I want to thank you again for calling the helpers in the last moment. Of course, Leader. But you should have been with me to the end. That is what I expected of you. That is why I chose you. I am removing you from your job, right now.\" \"Yes, Leader.\" \"Thank you, leader.\" \"I cannot take all the credit myself. It is a great team Benjamin put together here.\" \"Yes, I will.\" \"Thank you, leader.\" \"Samuel. That was Group Director David. He is so happy with what we did here today he does not know where to start.\" \"That is great.\" \"So... what is up, my friend?\" \"Well, um... it is like this. Either fire me... or get out of my chair.\" A big day happened. A person named Michelle made some tough choices. A leader said, \"Michelle, you made a difference today. You were right. Go home and rest. See you tomorrow.\"\nSecurity checked bags of two people named Katherine and Kimberley. One person said to another, \"Hello, my child. Everything will be okay. I love you.\"\nA leader spoke to many people. \"I urge you, do not listen to rumors. Once we know the facts, I will tell you. For now, we are safe. The best thing is to keep living our lives. Go back to work and school. Our freedom will defeat our enemies and keep us strong. God bless our country and all of us.\"\nPeople thanked the leader. Then something bad happened to the leader. Someone said, \"We need help! Call for medical assistance!\"", "hash": "2766d534316263a039aaded2cd70e1e5ad377b29db2f2e705f60ca72c5acd7ca"}
{"text": "A man and a woman were in a car. The woman said, \"Let go of me.\" The man called her Alice. Alice was hurt. The man said, \"What have you done? Let me take a look.\" He read from a book about accidents. He asked for a towel from the car. He told Alice to stay put and keep dry. He went to a nearby house and asked to use the phone, but it did not work. The people at the house said the hospital was far away. The man decided to take Alice to the hospital in his car. Alice did not want to stay at the house because she had a medical condition. The man asked a passing car for a ride to the hospital. The driver recognized the woman as an actress and asked for money. \"I need to help the officer,\" said Samuel. \"Let me know if you need anything.\" \"I will be right back.\" \"Where did you learn to do that?\" \"Pretty much where you are standing,\" replied Gabriel. \"Hey, is the...?\" \"The little boy, is he okay?\" \"He has not said a word since the accident.\" \"No, no, no.\" \"He does not talk much since the....\" \"I am his stepfather.\" \"His father....\" \"Two years ago, he left.\" \"Little temper problem.\" \"Watch your step.\" \"The furniture is old.\" \"If you need to secure him, the toilet is bolted down.\" \"Thank you so much for your help.\" \"It is a good idea.\" \"Come on.\" I have stripes on my shoulders and chains. Let's go look at that person. Did you get anyone? What? Did you get through? No, not yet. Good treatment. Pulse is weak, but steady. Keep her comfortable. We should take turns on the radio, if that's okay. No, it's not. I can manage. Will you arrest me, officer? What? How did you do that? How did you know I was a police officer? No surprise. Snacks for dinner, huh? That does not seem right. Do you have a better idea? I worked in the mess in the military. Maybe the diner is open. I could - Do you have change for a dollar? I don't know. Let me see. Here you go. Do you have a name? Samuel. Samuel, huh? I'll get it. Never been. Well, you are not going tonight. Please. Please be strong. You see, Thomas and I, we need you. We need you so much. Gabriel? Gabriel? Gabriel? You need to tell them, Daniel, that I cannot work, I cannot perform, I cannot shine living in an environment like that. No, it is not about the money. It is about the working conditions. One thing. One thing. No thing. One thing. Two things. Come on. Come on. Here we go. There you go. Come on. Bad place! Oh, no! I just had it. Holy no. \"Adam, Mother of God.\" \"Who is this?\" \"The woman I was driving.\" \"What is happening?\" \"There's something in there.\" \"Use this, friend.\" \"Thanks.\" \"Are you an officer?\" \"I was.\" \"She was in Room 10?\" \"I am.\" \"Where's your person?\" \"Tied to a toilet.\" \"That was a long drive.\" \"Ladies and gentlemen.\" \"Your Honor.\" \"Ready, Sarah?\" \"Alrighty.\" \"In the matter of Rivers v. NV state, for the purposes of\" \"Judge Thomas, sir, with respect, we should wait till my client arrives. He has a right to be here.\" \"He has few rights. He will be executed soon.\" \"But to show his mental state, which is the purpose\" \"His mental state? His mental state? Do you know the time? I have no time for this. That the justices called me in the night to review a case I already decided, may make you happy. But it angers me. When your person gets here, do what you want, but state your case, politely!\" \"Yes, sir.\" Somebody get me a drink, black.\n\nAll right, everybody! Listen up! There was an incident tonight. That's officer talk for, \"Someone got hurt.\" \n\nLarry! Caroline was hurt. What? Who's Caroline? The actress I was driving.  And where exactly did that happen? We don't know, because we can't find her. Not all of her anyway. What do you mean, you can't find her?\n\nStay calm. Everything will be okay. Officer Nathan is outside. He was transporting a prisoner. Who escaped. What are you--? Wait. A prisoner is free! Be quiet so he can talk! This is my place! I'll say what I want! It's safe here. It is not safe here! There's an officer here. Yes, two officers. Wait. You're an officer? I was. Shut up, Larry! It's not safe here! I'm not staying. It's all right. It's okay. Nothing. Is she okay? Ginny. \"You shut up.\" \"What's in there?\" \"What do you got in there?\" \"Shut up.\" \"What is it?\" \"Shut up.\" \"You can tell me.\" \"I'm good at keeping secrets.\" \"I got a special thing too.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"Bad word!\" \"What are you doing out here?\" \"Getting my things.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"What, I don't get to ask?\" \"I'm taking photos.\" \"There's been two bad things.\" \"Before all the proof.\" \"That's not an answer.\" \"You're a car driver.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"Looking to win some \"working hard\" car driver prize?\" \"You're not working anymore.\" \"You don't need to be a hero.\" \"There's a real cop outside.\" \"The one who lost a bad person?\" \"You're a hard person, Cameron.\" \"No.\" \"Not really.\" \"I think so.\" \"What month were you born?\" \"Early spring. Same animal as me.\" Where were you a cop? Big city. Were you fired or did you quit? I took sick leave. It was making me sick. I burned out, I guess. One day I got a call for a sad person. A young person. Sad and sick. She was truly very sad. I asked her to come in and I help. She asked me why she should keep living. What did you say? I was trained to tell her nice things. Her dreams, all the people who'd miss her. But for a moment, I couldn't think of nice things. So she jumped and died. I started getting sick and started blacking out. So I filed for sick leave. What? What is it? Bad thing! It's worse. Nothing but noise! Where's that thing from the actor? This was on the young person. What is it, some kind of countdown? Person's name! What is he doing? Person's name, come over here! Come over here, person. What are you doing? \"Come here,\" said Adam. \"What are you doing?\" asked Benjamin.\n\"I just went to get something,\" replied Adam. \"We told you to watch the man,\" said Benjamin.\n\"What are you doing in your office?\" asked Cameron. \"I just went to get something,\" Adam said again.\n\"How many keys are there to this place?\" asked Benjamin. \"Look at me,\" he said. \"How many?\"\n\"Two keys and a big key,\" replied Adam.\n\"Oh, no!\" cried Benjamin. \"Adam, you did something bad!\"\n\"Get in here!\" yelled Cameron.\n\"Why did you hurt that man?\" asked Benjamin. \"Why did you hurt my friend?\"\n\"I did not do that!\" cried Adam.\n\"You are not telling the truth!\" said Benjamin. \"Your stick is inside him!\"\n\"I know, but I did not do it!\" said Adam. \"Check the doors!\"\n\"Why did you hurt him?\" asked Benjamin. \"Why did you leave him alone?\"\n\"I was scared,\" said Adam.\n\"What were you scared of?\" asked Benjamin. \"Tell me.\"\n\"I did not hurt your friend!\" cried Adam. \"I went to my office, that's all!\"\n\"Why did you leave him?\" asked Benjamin, holding up a key. \"Is this your key? Number eight?\"\n\"Those are not my keys!\" said Adam.\n\"Look, these are my keys,\" Adam said, showing his keys. \"You see?\"\nBenjamin looked at Adam's fancy wallet. \"Did you take her wallet after she went away?\" he asked.\n\"Yes, I took her wallet after she went away!\" said Adam. \"But I did not hurt her or him.\"\n\"Stop, Adam,\" said Cameron. \"Put that down. You did not hurt anybody.\"\nBut Adam yelled angry words and would not listen. He tried to start a vehicle and leave.\n\"Adam, stop!\" yelled Benjamin. \"What is happening?\"\nAdam ran away, and Benjamin called for Timothy to come help. A big man said, \"There is a dead body in your freezer, David.\"\n\nDavid said, \"I did not kill him. I found him like that. Listen! Listen! Listen! I was in NE city last month and I lost everything, okay? Everything! I drove west. I did not know where to go, but I was running on empty so I pulled in here at this place. And there was no one at the station, so I came over to the office and I walked in. And there, sitting at that desk right there, was the manager facedown in a famous pie. Dead! Heart attack or something. Famous pie! He had been sitting there for a long time. All of a sudden, this man pulls up, looking for a room. I did not have any money so I took his 30 and gave him one. I just took the key from the wall and gave him a room. Maybe that was wrong, but I was broke, and that is what I did. Then I came back in here and I moved David's body - His name was David too. I put him in the freezer. I was not trying to hide him. It was hot out. I thought it was the best place for him till his family or someone came along. Only no one did except more guests. So I checked them in too. And they all seemed happy so I just stayed.\"\n\nThe big man said, \"This is not true!\" \"Adam.\" \"Adam, come on.\" \"Let's go.\" \"Get up.\" \"What's happening?\" \"They can't leave!\" \"This way.\" \"We'll see you when the bad weather stops.\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"They can't leave!\" \"Where are they going?\" \"Get back here!\" \"Go, go, go!\" \"They're leaving.\" \"They're not leaving.\" \"Go!\" \"You can't let people leave after four people have died!\" \"You really think they're people who did bad things?\" \"They're not leaving!\" \"Oh no.\" \"Grace!\" \"Things to put out fire.\" \"Kevin, you got a thing to put out fire?\" \"Thing to put out fire!\" \"Where?\" \"Back there!\" \"Nobody in there.\" \"Maybe it got so hot, they were burned to ashes.\" \"There would be something left.\" \"You did this.\" \"You did this!\" \"You told them to get into the car!\" \"Are you happy?\" \"Where is he? Nothing.\" \"I give up!\" \"I give up!\" \"I give up!\" \"What do you want? What do you want, you bad person? What do you want from us? I am turning 30 soon and I just want to go home and grow fruit!\" \"It's your birthday soon?\" \"It's my birthday soon.\" \"The 10th.\" \"Me too.\" \"Me too.\" \"Me too.\" \"Yeah. David, May 10. Jessica, May 10. Quinn, May 10. Grace and Rachel, May 10. Me, Thomas, May 10.\" \"What are the chances?\" \"Must be very small.\" \"What is it?\" \"Where's the box with switches, Thomas?\" \"Other side of the building.\" \"Grace and Rachel. Quinn. NV city. David. Thomas. RH state. Benjamin. When going up stairs I met someone who wasn't there. He wasn't there today too. I wish he'd go away.\" \"Who is this? Who am I talking to right now?\" \"Where did you learn that poem?\" \"Who am I talking to?\" \"Look at me.\" \"Who am I talking to right now?\" \"Doctor? Edward?\" \"What's happening?\" \"Please be quiet.\" \"He can hear what we're saying?\" \"Of course I can hear what you're saying.\" \"Adam, you missed your last meeting.\" \"Where have you been?\" \"Did I black out again?\" \"Try and think back.\" \"Where have you been?\" \"Alright.\" \"I was driving an actress and we got stuck at a motel.\" \"There was bad weather.\" \"We could not leave because of the bad weather.\" \"What happened at the motel?\" \"People started dying.\" \"And then their bodies-- It did not make sense.\" \"They disappeared.\" \"Adam, I would like to show you something, if I may.\" \"Do you know this man?\" \"No.\" \"That man, Adam, is a person with troubles.\" \"He was arrested years ago and found guilty of killing some people.\" \"He did this.\" \"Police officer, please.\" \"Adam, listen to me.\" \"When a child has a bad experience, their mind may create different selves.\" \"That is what happened to this person.\" \"He developed a condition that is commonly known as Multiple Self Problem.\" \"Why are you telling me this?\" \"Because you, Adam are one of his selves.\" \"What? Oh no! What did you do to my face?\" \"Stay calm.\" \"Where is my face?\" \"That is your face.\" \"Why am I tied up?\" \"Stay calm.\" \"Where is--? Oh no! Where is my face?\" \"Stay calm.\" \"No! I will not stay calm! Why am I tied up like this? Who are all these people? What happened at the motel? Where is everybody?\" \"They do not exist, Adam. You were all created by this person as a child.\" \"You are not being truthful!\" \"Think about what you know. Everyone named after a place. No. Everyone sharing the same birthday. Your blackouts. No! I was a police officer! I was a police officer in the city for years.\" \"Adam, please. You do not live there.\" \"I do live there! You do not live anywhere.\" \"I know this is difficult to understand, but the face you saw is the face I have always seen when I talk to you or other selves.\" \"This person is getting medical help. One which forces all his selves to meet for the first time.\" \"Where did you go before?\" \"What did you see?\" \"Tell me what you saw.\" \"I saw you.\" \"I saw you in an orange tree farm.\" \"Why won't you let me help you?\" \"Where did you go?\" \"What did you see?\" \"I saw you in an orange tree farm.\" \"The question, Your Honor, is whether to punish the body or the mind.\" \"Their body did these bad things, that is true.\" \"The person who remains inside did not.\" \"Judge Taylor, that may not be true\" \"We saw the end of 10 persons tonight.\" \"Nine were good and one was bad.\" \"They're not real!\" \"The violence that was in them has been stopped.\" \"Your Honor, Matthew belongs in a hospital.\" \"In the matter of Rivers v.

{"text": "This story is about a big group that has a lot of power. Some people in the group did bad things. Many people talked about it. Some said it was just a few bad people. Others said it was a bigger problem. The story looks at the good and bad things the group does. It has people from different jobs telling their views. At the end, it compares the group to a sports team where everyone has a different role to play. A business is like a big family. People in a business work together for the same goal. It is very powerful and is almost everywhere. It changes people's lives, usually for the better. A business can be like a noble eagle - strong, prepared, and inspiring to others. But some think businesses are like monsters that only want to make money, no matter who gets hurt. They might be like a big, gentle whale that could swallow you up by accident. A business is a group of people working together to make money for the owners. Businesses started in the 1700s when an Englishman named Thomas invented a pump to remove water from coal mines so miners could get more coal. It was about being more productive - getting more done with less work. Now we make more complex things, but it's the same idea of being more productive. A long time ago, there were only a few groups of people who were allowed to do things like build bridges or roads. These groups had rules about what they could do and for how long. They could not own other groups or do things outside of what they were allowed. They were meant to help people, not just make money.\n\nAfter the war between the states, more groups like these started. They got land and money from the government to build railroads and do other work. The people in charge of these groups wanted more power and fewer rules.  \n\nA new law was made to give equal rights to all people, no matter their skin color. But the people in charge of the groups said the groups themselves should have these rights too. The judges agreed with them.\n\nThis was very wrong, because the law was meant to protect people who had been treated badly before, not to give more power to groups who already had a lot. But over time, the groups got more rights while people got fewer.\n\n\"I know I made a mistake,\" said one person in charge of a group, \"but I'm not really responsible since I'm part of this group.\" A group of people want to start a business. They apply for a document from the government to make their business a legal person. This document is called a charter. The business can now buy and sell things, borrow money, go to court, and do business. It is part of our society and has many of the same rights as a real person. But it is a special kind of person with no feelings or morals. It only cares about making money for its owners. This is good because it helps make more things we need. But businesses also need to care about the environment and being good members of society. There are groups that do good things for people. They make things and do jobs that help all of us and make our lives better. That is a good thing. The problem is they always want to make more money. And they never have enough. Everyone needs money to live. Even people who live simply still need help from others. But big companies have to put money first, even before helping people. That is a rule they must follow. They only care about making money for their owners in the short term. They do not care about other things like helping people. Companies will make others pay for the problems they cause if it helps them make more money. Experts call this \"making others pay\". There are real problems with this. Running a company is hard work. They try to cut costs everywhere. At some point, they make others deal with the problems they cause. They say \"Let others protect our supplies. Let others build the roads we use. Let others handle those problems. I have enough of my own problems.\" This is where \"making others pay\" comes from - thinking \"Let someone else deal with that.\" A company is like a machine that makes others pay, just like a shark is a machine for killing. Neither means harm, they are just made to do certain things very well. Companies must make money NOW and make others pay for anything the public lets them get away with. A worker told us, \"This factory makes clothes, but the workers here are treated badly. They don't get paid well. This shirt costs a lot of money, but the worker who made it was paid almost nothing. And part of the money from selling these clothes is supposed to go to help children's charities, but that doesn't seem right when the workers are treated so poorly.\"\n\nThe worker showed us some papers with the names of famous people on them, who had designed the clothes made at that factory. We knew then that big companies were making money from the hard work of people who weren't being paid fairly.\n\nIt made us sad to see that workers, especially young workers, were being taken advantage of just so companies could make more profits. These companies say that their products will help children, but they aren't even helping the children who work in their factories by paying them enough to live on. We hope things can change so all workers are treated fairly. \"The problem was the people that gave us this label were young children,\" said Patrick. \"Do many people in your family work here?\" asked Victoria. \"Just me,\" answered Patrick. \"How many people do you support?\" \"Eight people.\" \"And, how do you do it with that small payment?\" asked Victoria. \"Is it enough?\" \"No,\" said Patrick.\n\n\"Let's look at it from a different view,\" said Victoria. \"Let's look at it from the view of the people in the BD country who are very hungry.\" \"The people in the CH country who are very hungry and the only thing that they have to offer to anybody that is worth anything is their low cost work.\" \"And in effect what they're saying to the world is they have this big flag that says 'Come over and hire us. We will work for a little money.' because a little money will buy us the rice that's needed not to starve. And come and rescue us from our hard situation.\"\n\n\"And so when a big company comes in they are seen by everybody in the community as a huge blessing,\" said Victoria. \"Hey wait! You are not allowed to be here!\" said a worker. The door was open. \"No no no no no. That's my things. Those are my things. This is not your things,\" said the worker. \"Why your camera?\" \"Don't touch the woman. Why?\" \"This is a private company. Without permission how can you come here?\" said the worker.\n\n\"Yes well the door was open, and...\" said Patrick. \"The door was open for workers not for you,\" said the worker. \"We went through the trash place in the DR country. We always do this kind of stuff we dig around. One day we found a big pile of a company's inside pricing papers,\" said Victoria.\n\n\"The company gives a time frame to each operation. They don't talk about minutes. They break the time frame into very small pieces of time. You get to the bottom of all operations; they give the workers a short time to make the shirt. It's a little money an hour in the DR country. That short time equals a very small part of the price. These are the company's papers. That means the wages come to a very small part of the price people pay. This is the reality. It's the bad treatment of workers,\" said Victoria. Early in the morning, the farmers went to the fields. \"The crops are growing well this season,\" Adam said. \"Yes, we have worked hard,\" Benjamin replied. Cameron visited the city and saw many tall buildings. \"The city is big and crowded,\" he thought. Later, Cameron returned to the village. Diana was baking bread in her kitchen. \"This bread smells delicious,\" Cameron told her. Emma loved to read books. Her favorite book was a famous drama about a princess. At night, the children slept well after a long day of play. A big box of papers came to my office. I opened it and found files about testing cows given a drug. The drug's trade name is Posilac. It is used on many dairy cows in this country. The company said there were no bad effects and no antibiotics were used. But the files showed they lied. The files described problems in the cows' hearts, lungs, kidneys, and other areas. It caused pain and suffering for the cows. Posilac makes cows produce more milk, but we already have too much milk. Governments pay farmers not to make milk. Using Posilac caused udder infections in cows called mastitis. This infection got into the cows' milk. Early one morning, Ethan woke up with a bad allergic reaction and burning eyes. He looked out at the river and saw huge white foam floating down. The next day, Ethan asked, \"What was that last night?\" The hotel worker said, \"Oh, that's just the river.\" Ethan asked what he meant. The worker explained, \"Every night, the paper mill sends waste down the river.\" Ethan knew the paper mill owners and the town people. None of them wanted the river polluted. Yet the river was being polluted, like a machine of doom had been created. In our search for money, we created something that's going to destroy us. The traders who are involved in the market are not people whose values about the environment will stop them. They're just seeing money and making money. Brokers don't stay away from copper because it goes against their beliefs or environmental rules. No. There are times when you think about it but it's quick. It's like, yeah a town is being polluted down there, but hey, this person needs to buy some copper. I'm getting paid too. Our information that we receive does not include anything about the environmental conditions, because until the environmental conditions are being traded, then we will not have anything to do with that. It doesn't come into our minds at all. It's so far away and you hardly hear anything about it, I mean, keep in mind there are things going on right in our backyards. We trade live animals. I mean there are so many animals in the NE state and they're polluting the rivers but how often do you find out about that? [NC state fines 5 major animal farms ... for waste storage problems.] At an organization, we've put together a list of the top companies that broke the law in the late 20th century. We looked at all the fines that companies had paid. A company pled guilty to federal charges and paid a big fine. Other companies were guilty of fraud, violations, and illegal actions and paid fines. Again and again we have the problem that whether you obey the law or not is a matter of whether it costs money. If the chance of getting caught and the penalties are less than it costs to follow the rules, people think of it as just a business decision. Drawing a metaphor of the early attempts to fly. A person going off a very high cliff in an airplane with the wings flapping and the wind is in their face and this poor person thinks they're flying but in fact they're falling and they just don't know it yet because the ground is so far away, but of course the craft is going to crash. That's the way our world is - the very high cliff represents the resources we seem to have when we began this journey. The craft is not flying because it's not built properly. Civilizations do not fly either. Some people have seen trouble coming sooner than others. The visionaries have seen it and told us it's coming. Every living thing on earth is in decline, including all the things that support life, like the many plant and animal species that share the planet with us. The typical company of the 20th century takes from the earth, wastes, and sends its waste back to the environment, like to a landfill. I was amazed to learn how much stuff the earth has to produce through our processes to make revenue for our company. We are leaving a terrible legacy of pollution and environmental damage for generations to come. Some people have called that unfair taxation on future generations. It's the wrong thing to do.\n\nOne question that comes up is whether a corporation could be considered harmful. If we look at a corporation as a legal person, it may not be difficult to compare it to harmful behavior in an individual. We could go through the characteristics that define this behavior, one by one, and see how they might apply to corporations: lack of concern for others, inability to maintain relationships, reckless disregard for safety of others, deceitfulness and lying for profit, and so on. They would have all the characteristics and in many ways, that type of corporation is a typical example of harmful behavior.\n\nIf the dominant institution of our time has been created to act harmfully, who bears moral responsibility for its actions? Can a building have moral opinions? Can a building have social responsibility? If a building can't have social responsibility, what does it mean to say a corporation can? A corporation is simply an artificial legal structure. But the people involved in it, whether stockholders, executives, or employees, all have moral responsibilities. It's a fair assumption that every human being, not corporations but every flesh and blood human being, is a moral person. Hello... can we put a \"bad person\" sign on your house? After some time they said, \"Well the problem is not you. It's the big company.\" And I said, \"Wait, let's talk about what this big company is. It's made up of people like me.\" In the end, what we found in that talk were all the things they were worried about, and I was worried about too. The changing world, bad leaders, and people not having rights... The big difference between us was, I feel that I can actually help with these things. These people were frustrated because they felt that they had no way to help. So a leader, like the head of a company, may really care about the environment. And in fact, since they have a lot of money, they can even spend some of it on that without going against their job to make money for the company. This is why a big company can do very bad things to the world while saying they care about the environment. The company is not a person, it doesn't think. People in it think, and for them it is okay to make things that hurt farmers. Things that stop farmers from saving seeds. Seeds that will not grow after one season. You really need to think in a very mean way to make those things. But very clearly, making money is more important to them than helping people. The need to make money, which helped companies do many good things, may also make them do bad things... Hello? My work is for many companies. I've pretended to be different jobs. I've made fake companies that look for workers. Basically I'm a spy. I'll find your workers and I'll tell them that I have a job that pays more than what you pay. Would they like to meet me for an interview? And when the worker comes, what they don't know is that I'm actually getting information from them for a different company. That there is no job and that the office is rented and the picture of my family is fake and it's all just a trick to get information from them. Early one morning, Adam thought, \"Wow, gold must be very valuable now!\" \"Luckily, all our customers had gold.\" \"So when its price went up, they all doubled their money.\" \"Everyone doubled their money.\" \"It was a good thing after all.\" \"It was sad and difficult, but for my customers who were in the market, they all made money.\" \"I wasn't looking for this kind of help, but it happened.\"\n\n\"When the XY country bombed the PQ country in the late 20th century, the price of oil went from a low cost to a very high cost!\" \"We couldn't wait for the bombs to start falling on Samuel.\" \"We were all excited.\" \"We wanted Samuel to really cause problems.\" \"Do whatever you have to do.\" \"Make things worse because the price will go up more.\" \"Every worker was cheering for that. There wasn't a worker who wasn't excited about that.\" \"This was a disaster.\" \"This was something bad happening.\" \"Bombing, wars.\" \"In difficult times, there are opportunities.\"\n\n\"The pursuit of profit is an old story, but there was a time when many things were considered too important for the public good to be treated as business opportunities.\" \"They were protected by tradition and public rules.\"\n\nIn the past, life was difficult. But there was a shared responsibility, people belonged to the land; the land did not belong to people. And in this world, people farmed the land together because they saw it as shared. It belonged to a higher power. \n\nThen, shared lands started being divided into private property. Then the oceans, which were shared, had laws created to allow countries to claim parts for their use. In this era, the air was divided into corridors that could be bought and sold for commercial airplanes. And then the rest is history.\n\nWith deregulation and free trade, we're seeing another division and private taking of shared resources. One interesting question in our current debates is who really creates wealth. Charlie said, \"Money is only made when someone owns things.\" Ethan replied, \"What about clean water, fresh air, and a safe place to live? Are those not valuable too? And does something only become valuable when someone puts a fence around it and says it belongs to them?\" \n\n\"Well, you know, that's not creating value,\" said Charlie. \"That's taking value away from everyone.\" \n\n\"Over time, we put more and more things where everyone could use them. But recently, in the past few decades, we started taking those things back,\" Ethan explained.\n\n\"Like fire fighters,\" Charlie said. \"They used to be private companies. If you didn't pay a certain fire fighter group, they wouldn't put out a fire at your house. But gradually, people decided protecting everyone was important.\"\n\n\"We shouldn't go backwards and start saying maybe the free market would make fire fighting better,\" Ethan cautioned. \"Letting companies own things doesn't make them accountable. Public services have benefits - they may lose money on purpose to help other businesses, or keep jobs during hard times when companies lay people off.\"\n\n\"Some people want everything to belong to someone. Even human rights, education, healthcare, housing - the basics we need to survive. And nature itself - water and air. There's been progress treating air like a shared resource we all need to protect instead of letting companies pollute as much as they want,\" Charlie concluded. Now there is a cost for polluting the air. \"Wouldn't it be great if we had a cost for everything?\" \"It sounds like you want people to own every part of the planet.\" \"Yes.\" \"Every part of the air and water.\" \"It sounds strange to say we want the whole world owned.\" \"That doesn't mean I want Adam owning this small part.\" \"But it means the people who care about that stream own it.\" \"And that is not a crazy idea.\" \"It's actually the solution to many of these problems.\" \n\nImagine a world where a company owned the song \"Happy Birthday.\" In fact, a company owns the rights to it. In the past, they asked for a lot of money to let people sing it in a movie. We didn't pay. We used the money to travel and bring you this story.\n\nMarketing today is very different from marketing long ago. It's much smarter and everywhere now. Products themselves aren't good or bad. The problem is companies trying to make children buy their products. \n\nA study looked at children nagging their parents to buy things. We asked parents to write down every time their child nagged for something for three weeks. This study wasn't to help parents stop nagging. It was to help companies get children to nag more effectively for their products.\n\nBetween 20% and 40% of purchases only happened because the child nagged their parents. For example, a quarter of theme park visits and four out of ten visits to places like the fun restaurant wouldn't have happened without nagging. Any parent knows places like that are loud with lots of kids. Why would you go there? But if the child nags enough, you'll go.\n\nWe saw the same thing with movies, home videos, and fast food. We have to get past the idea that parents don't like their kids nagging. That's just what they say. You have to make people want things. You have to make people care about unimportant things in life like buying new things. Big companies want people to feel like their value comes from having things they want. They want people to be apart from each other. They want people to only care about getting the things they want.\n\nThere are big companies that try to make people want things from a young age. A famous athlete like Thomas wears a hat with a company logo on it. He gets a lot of money just to wear the hat. We thought we could do that for another company. We could get money to go to school if we let a company pay us to wear their logos.\n\nWe found a company called FC Company to be our sponsor. FC Company paid for our college if we helped advertise for them. We talked about FC Company on TV shows and in news stories. We let FC Company use our pictures and stories for advertising. \n\nFC Company was not just paying us for money. They wanted to work with us and be our friends. We helped them advertise, and they helped pay for our school. We became walking billboards for FC Company to pay for college.\n\nOther companies noticed us too. A website called us a \"cool site.\" A magazine used our pictures. Parents used to have stories from wars to tell their children. Our story is about having a corporate sponsor. \"I have a lot of faith in the business world because it will always be there, so you might as well have faith in it because if you don't, it's just not good.\" \"Some of the best creative minds are hired to make sure we have faith in the business worldview.\" \"They attract us with business illusions.\" \"Made to distract our minds and get our agreement.\" \"Businesses don't advertise products much; they're advertising a way of life, a way of thinking.\" \"A story of who we are as people and how we got here and what's the source of our so-called liberty and so-called freedom.\" \"You know, so you have decades and decades of teaching us to think in a certain way.\" \"When applied to the large business, it's that the business was inevitable, that it's indispensable, that it is somehow very efficient, and that it is responsible for progress and the good life.\" \"Perception management is an interesting concept.\" \"It's basically a way to help our clients go through a thoughtful process to identify their resources, what's stopping their success, and how we can use communications to help them accomplish their goals.\" \"If Benjamin or Charlotte came to me and said: 'Dad, what do you do and why is it important?' My answer to that question is basically that I help businesses have a voice and share their point of view about how they feel about things.\" \"They're selling themselves, they're selling their rule, and they're creating an image for themselves as regular folks.\" \"Hi, how are you doing today? Good to see you. How are you doing today? Hi, how are you doing today? We're from a business. We're your neighbors. Are you in the new houses? Oh! These are some neighbors. Can we say hello? Can we say hello just for a minute? So what do you think of the neighborhood now? It's all right, it's good.\" Adam walked out of his apartment building one morning. He noticed some boxes near the doorman, with big brand names on them. \"Many people must be buying from that company,\" Adam thought.\n\nOutside, Adam heard some people loudly talking about a music group. \"This is great!\" one of them said, passing headphones around. \"I heard this album is hard to find, but they sell it at the XY store.\"\n\nAdam registered what they said. Later, he might think, \"I wonder what the popular music group is that they were talking about.\" The patent office and the FR government looked at this new thing. They said no. The patent rules do not cover living things. This is not an invention. Turned down. Then a big company and Doctor Cameron appealed to the court. To everyone's surprise, by a small number they overrode the patent office. They said this small living thing looks more like a cleaning product or a chemical than an animal. Cameron laughs because they did not understand basic science. It looked like a chemical to them. Had it had feelers or eyes or wings or legs, it would never have been allowed. Then the patent office appealed. The public should realize the patent office was clear that you cannot own life. An organization provided the main argument. If you allow the patent on this small living thing, we argued, it means that without any discussion, companies will own the blueprints of life. When they made the decision, we lost by a small number, and an important person said these are big issues but this is a small decision. Later, the patent office issued a rule: you can own anything in the world that's alive, except a human baby. The big court ruled that living things made in a lab may be owned. The court had to decide if one person or one company should control new forms of life. If we allow a company or school to exclusively own these living things, what does that say about our values? A scientist changed the genes of a mouse, making its babies more likely to get sick. Some people don't think that life forms are inventions like light bulbs. Certain companies search the planet for genes, genes that they can own. Instead of finding the truth, they look for profit. We've heard that we have mapped the human body's plan. But the public doesn't know there's a race by companies to find the treasure in the map - the individual parts that make up the human plan. Every time they find a part, these companies claim to own it: the sick breast part, the sick baby part, and many more. If this continues, in less than 10 years, a few global companies will own or control the actual parts that make up the evolution of our species. Adam and Benjamin were good friends. \"In the age of biology the politics is going to sort out between those who believe life first has intrinsic value and therefore we should choose technologies and commercial venues that honour the intrinsic value,\" said Adam. \"And then we're going to have people who believe look life is a simple utility. It's commercial fare and they will line up with the idea to let the marketplace be the ultimate arbiter of all of the age of biology.\"\n\n\"In a world economy where information is filtered by global media corporations keenly attuned to their powerful advertisers who will defend the publics right to know?\" asked Benjamin. \"And what price must be paid to preserve our ability to make informed choices?\"\n\nFT Television told them, \"You are just the people to be the investigators. Do any stories you want ask tough questions and get answers.\" Benjamin thought, \"This is great this is a dream job. Fantastic.\"\n\nThe very first thing they had them do was not to research stories but to shoot a promo. They were silhouetted with a smoke machine.\n\nOne of the first stories Charlotte came up with was the revelation that most of the milk in the FL state and throughout much of the country was not good.\n\n\"With a big company I didn't realize how effectively they could work to get something on the marketplace,\" said Adam. \"The levels of coordination they had to have. They had to get professors into the fold. They had to get experts into the fold. They had to get reporters into the fold. They had to get the public into the fold, and of course the government lets not leave them out. They had to get the federal regulators convinced that this was a fine and safe product to get it onto the marketplace. And they did that; they did that very very well.\"\n\nThe federal government basically approved it before they put it on the marketplace. The longest test they did for safety was a short time on a few animals. The scientists in another country looked very carefully at it and came to very different conclusions than the government in this country did. Mysteriously that conclusion was deleted from the final published version of their report. Some workers said, \"We were made to do things that were bad. We wrote a story about it. We had it ready before. They paid for ads...some workers say it's ok but studies show it may cause illness.\" \"Don't miss this special news report...\" \"That weekend before the Monday the story was to begin the fax machine printed a letter from a big lawyer in NE city that a company had hired.\" \"It said things that were not true.\" \"If you didn't know the full story it would have scared you as a news person, or as a boss.\" \"And they decided that they would not show the story and they would check it one more time.\" \"But there were no errors in that story.\" \"Both sides had been heard from, both sides had a chance to speak.\" \"One week later\" \"The company sent the second letter and this was very strong.\" \"And it said there will be 'big trouble' if the story airs in FL country.\" \"And this time they were scared.\" \"They were scared of being sued and losing money.\" \"And all of the stations owned by a news boss.\" \"And he owned more news stations than any other group.\" \"That's a lot of stations.\" \"That's a lot of money.\" \"For some products.\" \"So we had a fight.\" \"And the first deal was the new manager...\" \"His name is Adam.\" \"And Adam likes to sell things.\" \"And you know he'd shake your hand, how ya doin, how ya doin?\" Called us to his room and he said what if I stopped this story? What if it never showed? And we said, well, we wouldn't be happy about that. And he said, well I could stop it you know and we said yes of course you're the boss you could stop it, it would never show. And he talked back and forth. And we couldn't understand what was happening and finally he said: Look, would you tell anybody? You know I said I'm not going to lie for you. And about a week later he calls us back to the room and says okay you will make these changes. We said, well, let us show you the research that we have, that shows that this information you want us to show isn't true. Once upon a time, a person named Adam worked at a big TV station. One day, the boss named Benjamin told him: \"I don't care about that news story.\" Adam said, \"Pardon me?\" Benjamin replied, \"That's what I have lawyers for. Just write it the way the lawyers want it.\" \n\nAdam said, \"But this is important news that people want to know.\" Benjamin didn't pause and said, \"We paid a lot of money for these TV stations. We decide what the news is.\" Adam refused to present the story the way Benjamin wanted.\n\nBenjamin threatened, \"If you refuse, you'll be fired.\" Adam said he would report to the government that he was fired for not lying on TV. 24 hours passed with no response. Then Benjamin offered Adam money to leave his job and never talk about the story again.\n\nAdam asked how much, but they didn't agree. The station tried to rewrite and edit the story with their lawyers for 8 months. During this time, they wanted to remove the word \"sick\" from the story. Adam was a worker. Adam's boss told Adam to write something not true. Adam did not want to write that. Adam's boss got angry. Adam's boss fired Adam for not writing the not true thing. Adam sued his boss. The court said Adam was right. Adam's boss had to pay money to Adam. But later, the higher court said Adam's boss could fire Adam for not writing the not true thing. The higher court helped Adam's boss. Once there was a person named Charlotte. Some judges said that lying about news is not against the law. So they did not let Charlotte be a whistleblower, and they took away her money prize. In some countries, they do not allow a certain kind of milk. But in one country, people can still drink that milk. In the future, many people may not have fresh water to drink. A company from the NE city took control of all the water in a town, even the rain water. People had to pay a lot of money for water, or they could lose their homes. Some people had to work more, send fewer children to school, or get less medical care to pay for water. The people protested and said \"The water is ours!\" The government helped the company instead of the people. There were protests and violence. Some young people were hurt or killed. Big companies have helped unkind governments in the past. This made some people very angry at the companies. Adam was a good child who liked to learn new things. One day, the teacher told the class about a bad thing that happened a long time ago. In the late 20th century, some bad people did not like others who were different from them. They made special cards to keep track of these people. The cards had numbers to show if the person was sent away or even killed. This was a very sad time, but we must learn from history so it never happens again. Adam promised to always be kind to everyone, no matter how different they may seem. Adam and Benjamin worked for a big company. This company made machines. Benjamin said, \"They used our machines in bad ways during the war. But we did not know.\" Adam said, \"But the company knew. There is a letter showing they knew.\" The machines helped the bad people do bad things during the war. The company only cared about making money, not about what was right or wrong. Other big companies also did bad things to make money from bad people. Big companies often do not care if a country is good or bad, as long as they can make money there. In the past, some soldiers helped big companies make money in other countries, even if those countries were not good. Big companies only care about profits, not about being good. \"The leaders and top people say the protests don't matter.\" \"They think all people in the countries agree with them.\" \"Good to see you.\" \"Well done for standing up for good things like truth and justice.\" \"I looked at the speeches at the big event.\" \"What amazing progress (\" \"Yes, amazing...\") over the last years.\" \"We heard such open...\" \"A shared language.\" \"A shared language.\" \"Yes, from the richest to the poorest.\" \"It was amazing that now people see the benefits of trade, more and more want to join in. (\" \"Absolutely...\")\" \"Because we see it helps everyone.\" \"From the poorer to the better off, so...\" \"Many countries want to join, not leave.\" \"\"Exactly!\" \"No one wants out, everyone wants in.\" \"Yeah, yeah...\" \"Well done.\" \"Thank you.\" \"So far so good.\" \"Good, good!\" \"I'm inside and this is all outside.\" \"That's how it is.\" \"What do you think when you see this?\" \"It's sad.\" \"I mean it's too bad this is happening.\" \"[The Book]\" \"Do they want some rules?\" \"Yes. And the business world knows that. But the rules are in the market, with their customers. It's about how people see them. If companies do bad things, people won't buy from them and no company wants that. There's a new market. These people aren't here because someone made them come. Or because they read a book about being good. My inner voice says be true to myself. Mine says love all. My inner voice says I want a tasty meal. They're here because they understand. The market needs them to be here. That's their big advantage to be here. I'm listening to your worries. I worry about the climate. I worry about pollution. I don't have all the answers but we are ready to work with you, with groups, with governments to fix it. So you build trust, so that you trust again and the goal is to become the best choice company. He believes that almost half our energy can one day come from nature sources. Early one day, a woman came to the NE country. \"She is amazing,\" said another. Congress heard children say they worked in far places. Katherine apologized to Wendy. \"It was wonderful,\" said someone.\n\nA famous person leaned over and said, \"Wendy, believe me. I did not know about this. Now I know, I will work with you and others. It will not happen again.\" That night, they made an agreement with Katherine.\n\n\"I thought it would be easy, but it is not,\" said Katherine. \"For every question, there are five more questions for me.\" As for a big store and Katherine, many workers still worked for little pay. But because this was on TV for weeks, many people in the country learned about child workers, poor pay, and hunger pay.\n\nYears later, Katherine's bags were still made in CH country by workers paid almost nothing per hour. After pressure from a group, a big clothing company let others check its factories in the ES country. This company was the first to do this.\n\nSomeone said, \"We want to look at the roots of the law that made this happen. We want to know who can stop them. The laws are not set in stone. They can be changed. Most places have laws that say they must be changed.\"\n\n\"For too long, big companies have been allowed to go against democracy here and in other places. But today, a lawyers' group and 29 other groups are fighting back. We want the head lawyer in CA state to follow the law and take away the company charter of a big oil company for its many bad actions.\"\n\n\"This is a real law. It has been used before. It can be used again. This will mean the oil company will be stopped and its things will be sold to others who will work for the public good.\"\n\nA person from the oil company said, \"This is just an attack campaign. Our company has been part of CA for over 100 years, with many jobs. We have made mistakes and paid for them, but this demonizing of a company is like going back 50 years.\" Adam and Benjamin were very angry at a big company. Benjamin said, \"People who do not make anything except hot air are angry.\" Adam said the company did bad things overseas to women, people who love the same gender, workers, and native people. It also tried to trick the courts, the public, and its own investors. \"This company is a bad example of companies that abuse power and do whatever they want,\" Adam said.\n\nSomeone asked if this was a business. Benjamin said the army in that country is bad. \"This company cannot do business in that country without supporting the bad government,\" Benjamin said.\n\nThe top law officer in a place said the company could not have its business permit taken away, but agreed the office had the power to do so.\n\nAdam said that making films showing bad things can help change happen, so he felt he had to keep making them.\n\nBenjamin said he gives big companies a hard time all year, but at the holidays, he tries to be nice to big companies like cigarette makers.\n\nAdam went to a town where a school shooting happened. He learned that the main job of parents in that town was making weapons that can kill many people. But they did not see how their jobs related to what their kids did at school.\n\nAdam thought about how he and his wife grew up in an auto town. No one there thought about how making cars is a big reason why the ice caps are melting and could end civilization. They just thought cars helped people get around, not about the larger effects.\n\nAdam said in the end, people have to take responsibility for how their collective actions harm the world.\n\nThere would be a big town meeting to discuss if democracy is possible when companies have so much wealth and power under the law. A group was talking about a company that recycles materials and uses renewable energy. The company aims to have zero environmental impact, which is very difficult. People need to work together and learn new things to make this happen. \n\nIn another story, there was a protest in a city. The government officials disappeared, and the people made decisions together in large assemblies. They took control of the water supply from a company. This showed that ordinary people can solve their own problems.\n\nIn the end, the group talks about how effective protests can be, like when they protested against the Gap clothing stores across the country. Adam was looking around. \"Look at all the buildings and windows. Look at all the workers and their clothes,\" he said. \"Look at that power.\"\n\n\"You can still talk to these big groups,\" Benjamin said. \"You can still make a difference.\"\n\n\"Small fights are being won around the world, but I think people are losing,\" Cameron said. \"I see a dark future for our children. But I trust people to think, be angry, and rebel. We can change the leaders. That's the only way to rethink what money and things can do.\"\n\n\"Fifteen big groups want to control our lives,\" David said. \"But millions of people are saying we don't need you. We can do better. We will make systems that help the earth and people. These are not small tries. Many groups around the world are doing this. That is the future.\"\n\n\"It's funny that I can do all this, but what am I on?\" Ethan said. \"I'm on the internet. I'm shown by big groups. But I'm against what they believe in. Why do they show me when I'm against what they do? It's because they want to make money. I'm able to show my work because they are greedy. The rich man will sell you the rope to hang himself if he can make money. I'm the rope, I hope. They also think that when people see my work, they won't do anything because we've numbed their minds. But I think some people will leave and do something to get this world back in our hands.\"", "hash": "ba3ddc5fb0a008fad3aa12e1fff4d24c323898a4f0265bf12183baee3dce9829"}

Your mom?\"\n\"Why couldn't God give me a mom like yours?\" asked Jack sadly. \"Maybe it's a blessing in disguise. He'll give me a good wife.\"\n\"I wonder if my angel in white is a good cook,\" said Samuel. \"Are you listening to me?\"\n\"There's this doctor in the NE village who's like a god-sent man,\" said Oliver excitedly. \"A living legend... Hippocrates! That's what they call him.\"\n\"Hi,\" said Matthew to Benjamin. \"Just got off work?\"\n\"Right,\" replied Benjamin. \"How's Alphonse?\"\n\"Couldn't be better,\" said Matthew. Charlie and Adam liked Kevin a lot because Kevin was like a dog. Charlie said \"Stop staring at me.\" Adam said \"Why am I so sad on the big holiday?\"\n\nAdam asked Kevin \"You don't have anyone you want to play with in the white stuff?\" Kevin said \"No.\" Adam said a bad word. Adam asked \"Has no girl ever loved you?\" Kevin said \"No.\" Adam said \"Look at me!\" Adam said \"It's...amazing!\"\n\nAdam asked \"You don't feel anything when the white stuff falls?\" Kevin said \"No.\" Adam said \"The whole world is white. No feelings at all?\" Kevin said \"No.\" Adam said another bad word and said \"Think about it. It has been falling all day, and you say nothing but 'No.' That makes me mad. Why is the white stuff that color? Why not other colors? How could you have no feelings about that white stuff?\"\n\nAdam said \"Let's go sliding on the white stuff tomorrow if it stops.\" Kevin said \"Sliding on the white stuff? Who do you think I am, a reindeer name? I hate the white stuff! I hate the big holiday. I'm a different religion. Stop falling, white stuff!\"\n\nAdam said to Kevin \"This is it. When the white stuff melts, will the walls around your heart fall too? You're good at answering. Don't fail me now.\" Kevin said \"They won't.\" Adam said \"You're unbelievable.\"\n\nAdam said \"Kevin, take care. Don't eat too much, okay? I'm really going. I'm leaving before I go mad. Kevin! Wait up!\" Adam fell in the white stuff.\n\nA hiker named Benjamin came along. He said \"Thanks for the tea. It will be night soon.\" Benjamin watched a play. A woman said \"By any chance, are you into art?\" Benjamin asked \"What store?\" The woman said \"You must be mistaken.\"\n\nBenjamin said \"Good morning.\" Kevin said \"You were out of reach. I thought you'd never come back. Then I figured out you were far away. But I didn't stop waiting. Did you get back at that dog?\" \"We must go now\" \"Catch your breath first, child\" \"You have to save her\" \"The only girl I've given my heart is sick up there\" \"Please, you must save her.\" \"I'm begging you\" \"Please, doctor\" \"Are you listening?\" \"Please!\" \"We don't have much time We've got to go now!\" \"I've just lost my special friend\" \"And you're asking me save yours\" \"Doctor?\" \"Let's take a break\" \"No time to waste.\" \"I'll carry you on my back\" \"You're desperate.\" \"Lead the way, I'll walk\" \"Never been on anyone's back.\" \"It feels good, though\" \"Why's that?\" \"You smell nice\" \"Let your parents experience it\" \"Wish I could.\" \"I don't have parents\" \"So many stars tonight\" \"I had a child long ago\" \"They were so fascinated by stars\" \"It was as starry then\" \"I think about my parents looking at stars\" \"Let's... take a break\" \"Don't you want to save the girl you love?\" \"Keep walking Come on, a little further\" \"In here\" \"Emma?\" \" What are you looking at?\" \" Huh? \" Put the kettle on\" \" Okay\" \n\n\"Thank you so much, doctor\" \n\"Don't worry You didn't carry me for nothing\"\n\"I need to rest\"\n\"Doctor\"\n\"Stars are so bright tonight\"  \n\"Has she come to?\"\n\"Not yet\"\n\"She'll be fine\"\n\"I need to head back\"\n\"It's too late, and the snow is deep out there\"\n\"You hurried me up here... to save the girl you love\"\n\"I need to get back to the girl that I've loved all my life\"\n\"You're so big now\"\n\"Look at that star!\"\n\"Emma?\"\n\"Who treated me?\"\n\"Stars...\"  \n\"Stars?\"\n\"Yes\"\n\"The stars came down and gone\"\n\"I see...\"\n\"Don't just stand there\"\n\"Come closer... and hold my hand\"", "hash": "cf485200b659964f18c9ac94fe7ef9063d3b9aab6871eaa731165ebf89c0fa42"}

I can't finish the show like this. \"And, more importantly, the olive is a must-have for a good salad,\" said Adam. \"Charlotte is charming,\" said Emma. \"That role was played by many people, including Jessica, but I thought she had such great talent,\" remarked David. \"Unless someone helps her, the flower of her talents will never bloom,\" said Katherine. \"I understand,\" replied Frank. \"I will make sure to help her talents grow,\" he continued. \"Jessica, please come to see our show too,\" invited Emma. \"If I feel like it,\" responded Jessica dismissively. \"What?\" said Katherine, surprised. \"That's not nice,\" she chided. A new scene began with different characters.\n\n\"I'm afraid Liam no longer needs me,\" said Olivia sadly. \"And so...\" she trailed off. \"What?\" asked Matthew, concerned. \"Miss Sophia was approached by another company?\" he inquired. \"Not only that...\" added Olivia dramatically, \"It's a love story between a man and a woman spanning ten years! A tangled love triangle...\" \"I don't understand the complicated stuff,\" admitted Matthew. \"But we can't just let things go like this, right?\" he asked insistently. \"Right?\" he repeated. \n\nA narrator's voice announced, \"Next time on NB show, 'The Diva's Amazing Love.'\" The announcement repeated several times as a song began to play with indistinct lyrics about dreams, the sky, facing the wind, sorrow, walls, running away, poems, and laughter.", "hash": "cfb6b096a46d382d96f46a73e4a1e47c73ba710e29a4339a68880efa182019fe"}
{"text": "The family went to the beach. They were excited to see the red jellyfish that came to the beach every year. The father explained to his child that long ago, people thought jellyfish venom could heal, but now we know it only makes things worse. The family enjoyed the moonlight, music, and water at the beach. Two couples had a romantic chat and dance. A person said, \"I do not do that on land.\" Another person said, \"I might as well go back to my store.\" The first person said, \"I have a date with some important papers.\" A third person said, \"Poor Nathan.\" A fourth person said, \"This is his first big event alone.\" The third person said, \"I know. And it does not get easier from here. There are some other special days coming up that are for people who love each other, not for people whose partner has died.\" The first person sighed and filled out a form saying they are happily married to a dead woman. A new person came in and said, \"Are you open?\" The first person said, \"Open as can be. What can I help you with?\" The new person chuckled and said, \"They do not make people like you in the NE city.\" The first person said, \"I gave up on that NE city when those TV people made a nun fly and people looked up her dress. That is not right.\" The new person asked if they had a certain item. The first person did not have it but could get it soon. The new person said they would take a different item for now. The first person gasped and said the new person was gorgeous, and asked if they knew who they were. The new person said they were the most important person because they were the customer. The new person asked if the first person was for real. The first person said they were as real as can be. The new person thanked them and said they would see them later, as they did not know anyone in this area and would like to have dinner tomorrow. The first person was surprised at a woman asking a man out, but agreed. The new person said to call them at a place and ask for a certain name, but that was not their real name. The first person sang about having a date with a girl whose name they did not know, but being excited to be dating again. Then they gasped, realizing their date was a movie star. Adam and Benjamin went on a date. Benjamin was a famous movie star. Adam was a normal person. He was worried that Benjamin would not like him because he was not famous or rich.\n\nAdam said, \"Why would Benjamin want to go out with a normal person like me?\"\n\nBenjamin said, \"It is nice to date someone normal for a change. The people I usually date only talk about their looks and hobbies.\"\n\nAdam was happy to hear that. He held Benjamin's hand. He said, \"I have been wanting to do this all night.\" Benjamin smiled and said, \"This is wonderful.\" Adam wanted a change with no bad things. \"Okay.\" \"But you will have to greet a person.\" \"Deal.\" \"Adam, we won.\" \"Yes.\" \"All we need to do is turn that person into another person...\" \"...and that greeting into a fun game.\" \"You are so kind to care for me.\" \"The people may not see me without clothes but you just might.\" \"Ha, ha, well, that's, um, very nice, um...\" \"Calm, Adam.\" \"Think of the good book.\" [HAPPY MUSIC PLAYING] [CLEARING THROAT] \"Miss Emma, I loved you in a famous drama and another famous play.\" \"Thanks. I became close friends with the actress who played my child. I think she's in the FR country or something.\" \"Hmm.\" \"And, Adam, I haven't seen you this happy in years.\" \"Mm-hm. I haven't felt this good since we won that late 20th century thing.\" \"Hey, don't blame me. I voted for the green candy.\" [CAMERAS CLICKING] \"Ah! The cameramen. I thought we fooled them with our bird costume.\" [HAPPY SONG PLAYING] A person: \"Are you aware your child likes others of the same gender?\" \"Those people are not good.\" \"Frank, what are you doing here? Can't your old friend, Frank, come with questions from the News Book?\" \"Number one: Emma, is it true you took something without paying?\" \"I'll have you know she pays full price for her boats.\" \"Victor.\" \"My old partner.\" \"Emma, my dear, be with me again. If tears could come from my strong face I would cry like a baby who was just hit.\" \"Victor, you're too jealous. You hurt Benjamin because he gave me an award.\" \"Oh, come on. No one misses a handshake that badly.\" \"Sorry. I found someone nice who doesn't talk strangely.\" \"Exactly.\" My love feelings have ended. Adam, I've never met a man like you. You're caring. You're in great shape. You have a moustache. And yet you're not interested in others of the same gender. Oh, no way. A boy said, \"I won't even eat vegetables over 2 inches long.\" Another boy said, \"Your movie's wrapping up soon. I guess you'll be heading out on the first bus to the airport. If you ride with a friend, you can save money.\" A man said to Frank, \"Frank, I know this is fast. When I go back to the NW city, I want you to come with me. Frank in that big city?\" Frank said, \"Can I call you Jim?\" The man said, \"My name is good. How about some sweet bread?\" Frank said, \"I can't see the harm. With a sweet glaze?\" The man laughed and said, \"No!\" Frank said, \"Perhaps you'd like a game.\" The man said, \"No! We're movie workers now. And we're people of a certain religion.\" Two boys cheered. Frank screamed. Frank said to Taylor, \"Taylor, I'm sorry. But I can't move to that big city. Even a famous place is too far out for me. Too many people enjoying it in an unexpected way.\" Taylor said, \"Then I'm staying here with you for good.\" Frank said, \"I'm very happy.\" A boy said, \"What's it like kissing a movie star?\" Another boy said, \"What's it like kissing a woman?\" A police officer came and said, \"The problem is I can't seem to get a job.\" Frank said, \"Could you give your partner my photo?\" The officer said, \"This is me as some people, and now just me with an eye patch. I'll give it to my agent. I don't do TV.\" Frank said, \"Sure is nice to be shopping for a woman again. The last thing I bought for a lady was a container.\" The officer said, \"Would you ask your girlfriend to sign for me?\" Frank said, \"Of course...Wait, this is to adopt two kids.\" The officer said, \"I've already given three kids to Nora. Easy.\" A person said, \"Look. It's Frank and his arm candy, Taylor. Taylor, how are you handling the change from that big city to this small town?\" Taylor said, \"This town isn't bad. Part of a famous movie was filmed at our airport.\" Once upon a time, there was a book group. \"Alice, you're welcome to join,\" said Emma. \"Oh, I'd love to,\" replied Alice.\n\n\"Today's book is a famous drama,\" said Emma. \"Let's talk about why we didn't read it.\" \"I was not feeling well,\" said Bella. \"All my friends are gone,\" said Charlotte.\n\n\"Well, then, it's time for drinks,\" said Emma. \"I wish someone had read the book since I invited the writer.\"\n\n\"As long as people bought the book, I'll get the money,\" said the writer. \"Most children can't understand the jokes in this book. Goodbye.\"\n\nLater, Emma said, \"Sweetie, let's go to the music show early and give our seats to older people.\"\n\nEmma's daughter asked, \"Where do babies come from?\"\n\n\"That's not the kind of dress you wear anywhere,\" said Emma's husband.\n\n\"This dress just creates the illusion of being undressed,\" said Emma.\n\n\"Their friends probably don't dress like that,\" said the husband's mother. \"She should be ashamed. Don't look, dear.\"\n\n\"I'm an adult, Mother,\" said the husband.\n\n\"You used to wet the bed,\" said the mother.\n\nAlice said to Emma's husband, \"I love you, but I want to be intimate with you.\"\n\n\"Well, that's a big problem,\" said Emma's husband. \"I need a drink,\" said Alice.\n\n\"This is quite a dilemma,\" said Emma's husband. \"Here comes Hannah.\" \"Little animal, I held you close,\" \"And told you I love you,\" \"But then nature took you away,\" \"And now I just hold a slimy thing.\" \"Little animal, I held you close,\" \"And said that I love you,\" \"But then nature took you away,\" \"My little one, I'll miss you,\" \"For now,\" \"I just hold a slimy thing.\"", "hash": "ceb5d02f8f99a3e10e4a8ebec13a21c13d41263887f2e8fb0e16f2423fb362e8"}

I listen to life.\" \"If we ever meet again, which I doubt, I may tell you my story, but not today.\" \"Your servant wants the reward for capturing me. I must be on my way.\" \"Your name, at least?\" \"I'm called Gabriel.\" \"Don't worry... no one will report you.\" \"Thank you. God be with you.\" \"Gabriel.\" \"He's a wanted criminal. He's done us no harm. Neither you nor I have ever seen him.\" \"Welcome back, Isaac.\" \"Thank you. I stayed in NE city longer than planned because of the religious people there.\" \"Excuse me, Isaac. The religious people wish to see your watch again. May they?\" A nice day. Thank you. In the early mornings, I studied the old papers kept in the church, and in the evening, when it was cooler, I visited the places I had always dreamed of. Do you know the time? Quarter to five. Thank you. What a great watch! Are you from the FR country? Shall I tell your future? Are you a wandering person? If you want. Then if you're not a wandering person, are you a special person? I'm with the evil spirit. Again. What? Your watch. Of course. May I take your arm? Naturally. They say a beautiful woman must have three dark features: Her eyelashes, eyebrows and hair. Three bright features: Her face, teeth and hands. And three pink features: Her body parts, lips and nails. May I have your looking tool? My charming woman fell short of such perfection but had, for a writer like me, the added attraction of calling herself a servant of the evil spirit. Do you have a coin? Yes. Cross your left hand with it. Put it here. Single. Yes. Turned forty-five. Indeed. Unkind heart. Why so? Your loved one loves another. Of higher status. You run from this woman, but in vain. She lives in your heart. It is written. Would you know more? About what? The cure for your problems. Is it expensive? It's a sweet medicine. Worth all the gold on earth. Keep still. Don't turn around. Who's this? A strange person I met. Why bring them here? Seen those rings? Tell them to go. Leave. Just a minute. You, here? As you see, it's a small world. You interrupted just when the future seemed interesting. She's beyond help. But she'll soon meet her match. Let's go. Walk down the street and forget tonight's events. My watch! Best forgotten. A few days later, I hired Cameron again to help me move to what I suspected had been as important a place as CD city. Is this common in this land? Don Cameron! In barely a week, we saw the land open and give birth to the proof of an almost unknown people. A few days later, on my return to the church, I received a surprise. A young child and another person were talking. \"Friend, if I pushed you and you fell, these two mean people would stop me,\" said the child. \"Go ahead, my friend... and may a good spirit help you,\" replied the other person.\n\n\"Quick, she's leaving!\" someone shouted. \"Adam!\" \"Get the animals!\" \n\nA soldier named Samuel was punished for bad work. \"Turn around!\" a commander ordered. Samuel had worked hard for many years, hoping for a promotion. But he made a mistake with a girl who tricked him.\n\nDespite trying not to, Samuel kept thinking about the girl. He looked through the bars of his cell. None of the women passing by were as pretty as that girl.\n\nThe worst was still to come: At the commander's big party, Samuel had to stand guard like a common soldier. But fate was not done playing tricks that same night.\n\nA person asked Samuel, \"Been made a low-rank soldier, huh? If you like fried foods, find Emma's restaurant in the NE city.\" \n\nAt the restaurant, someone asked, \"Who's dancing?\" \"Charlotte,\" replied another.\n\nThe server brought drinks. A person sang, \"For one look, a world, for one smile, joy...\" But Charlotte interrupted angrily, \"That's enough!\"\n\n\"What happened?\" someone asked. \"She's crazy,\" another replied. \"Important men like her, but he's a low rank.\"\n\nCharlotte looked at Samuel. \"Ever had your heart broken? What are you worth? A little? Better than nothing, I guess. Let's spend it, and you can spoil me.\"\n\n\"Hear the bells?\" Charlotte asked. \"Ringing at night brings bad luck. Don't laugh, they say you're unlucky.\" \"Only sometimes,\" Charlotte replied.\n\nSomeone entered, looking for a room. \"A snack for your friends,\" said the innkeeper, leaving baskets.\n\nThe friends laughed at a customer who couldn't perform with all of them present. \"He's innocent,\" one said. \"What did you pray for?\" asked another. \"For Charlotte to return to her job and leave this rough place,\" Samuel replied sadly. \"Why not ask for some extra money?\" \"I asked you to be kind to me.\" \"This lady is from a place, and knows I won't change.\" \"All ladies are our good mother.\" \"I asked the lady from a place, our lady from a place.\" \"I have an agreement with the bad person, and won't go back to the place.\" \"But I'll be good to you.\" \"Come.\" \"Better she doesn't see this.\" \"Am I really the first one?\" \"I'll show you how to do it, new person.\" \"You'll learn a lot tonight.\" \"Are you really a young lady?\" \"Where are you going?\" \"Meet at the place.\" \" The place? - Yes.\" \"Are you being controlled?\" \"I have to go.\" \"Well, go on, leave.\" \"Go away!\" \"You're so weak!\" \"Here! Go!\" \"What can I do? I can't stay.\" \"It's my duty to go.\" \"So, go. Follow your leader.\" \"Charlotte... Charlotte. I'm a soldier. I belong to the army. Don't you see I must go? I can't stay. What day is today? Yesterday was a day. And the date? No, quiet! Don't say it. A bad day. Why? Not now. I said no. Listen, Cameron... think you are paid. I'd have forgotten the debt, but I liked you. So we're done. When will I see you again? When you stop being a fool. So, light a candle to your good lady, she's earned it. Charlotte... After that night, I had no other thought. I spent the day walking, hoping to see her. Charlotte! Excuse me. Believe me, sir, every place I went, I hoped to meet Charlotte. Where's Charlotte? Look for her in a bad place. Good lady, mother of kindness, our life, sweetness and hope. To you I cry, child of a person. To you I feel sad, I cry and am sad. O gentle! O loving! O sweet good lady! Turn your kind eyes on this child and ease his time away. Make her come back to me. Make her see the light. Let goodness fill her heart. \"Make me love you and be loved by you.\" \"The holy woman heard my prayer, in part, for one night, on guard at one of SE city's gates...\" \"Want some extra money?\" \"The people with bags...\" \"Let them pass.\" \"No.\" \"I can't let them pass.\" \"I obey orders.\" \"You didn't that night on CS Street.\" \"I don't want bad money.\" \"If you don't want money, we can visit CS Street again.\" \"No.\" \"If you won't, I know who will.\" \"I'll invite your boss to CS Street.\" \"They'll say yes.\" \"Bye, silly person!\" \"I'll laugh the day the orders are to hang you.\" \"Charlotte!\" \"Charlotte!\" \"Charlotte!\" \"When?\" \"What time?\" \"Eleven o'clock and all's well!\" \"It's eleven o'clock. Nothing to say? I'm in a bad mood. I've got more reason to be. I didn't like having to ask last night. I'm not here out of love. Here. The money I promised, for your troubles. Wanted a cat, didn't you? Here it is. If I killed you now, I'd save myself a lot of tears. I'm sure... but it's not time. Tears of a worker. Good for one of my potions. If you kiss me, maybe I'll love you again a little. Don't be angry with me. I love you despite myself, the best way to love, they say. I can't help it. You're my first and last thought each day. The next night I waited in vain. I should have stopped seeing Charlotte but she was right: It was written. Written on my mind and my heart. Every step I took brought me closer to the hole. Reversed cards, they never speak straight. Well, an older man will retire you, but won't marry you. He won't leave his family. The man of your life will appear later, asking you to leave him. That's it for today, girls. Hello, handsome. Beautiful. Where's Charlotte? Who knows where that one gets to? You. Where is she? Charlotte is like the weather: The hotter the sun, the nearer the storm. Don't wait. Why? What do you know? It's good advice. Don't wait. Go. \"Do you know who Charlotte is?\" \"Do you want to?\" \"At 14, they'd sold her cherry four times.\" \"While her mother screwed people, her father killed them for money.\" \"When she's broke, she comes here and lays with 2 or 3 dirty old men.\" \"Why Charlotte?\" \"What do you see in the girl?\" \"What do you want?\" \"A tender young virgin?\" \"I can provide one.\" \"A 22-year-old, adoring and a good cook?\" \"I can provide one.\" \"Or a bearer of healthy children?\" \"I can provide one, too.\" \"And if you'd prefer a real woman, a woman with experience, who knows what a man is, and what he likes... then...\" \"I... can provide it all, and all at once, if you wish.\" \"Enough!\" \"I want Charlotte.\" \"I want her, for myself.\" \"For me and no one else.\" \"Just me.\" \"Why are you here?\" \"Go.\" \"Get out!\" \"This is wrong.\" \" Obey!\" \" Bad person! \"Attention!\" \"Lieutenant...\" \"Get out.\" \" Charlotte...\" \" Go, I said! Go and pray until I come. Let's hope she can get you out of this mess. Quick! Go!\n\nMost caring Mother Mary, who has never been known to deny help to those who seek thy care, I come to thee, O Mother. And feeling bad, I stand before thee. O my caring one! I give my whole self to thee. From now on, I give thee my eyes, ears, body, heart, my whole being. Since I am yours, kind Mother, keep and care for me. Amen.\n\nI did wrong, I did very wrong.\n\nHere, plain clothes. You can't be seen in uniform. Your officer is in trouble, so it's time to change your ways. For starters, to dress as a plain person. Come. You silly new person! All you do is mess up. I said I'd bring you bad luck. You'll have to act now. If you've the courage, take to the hills and be a traveler. Here.

{"text": "\"Henry's got you.\" \"I promise, I will never let anything happen to you...\" \"Noah.\" \"First day of school!\" \"Wake up, wake up!\" \"First day of school.\" \"I don't want to go to school...\" \"five more minutes.\" \"Not you, Henry, me.\" \"Get up, get up.\" \"It's time for school, time for school.\" \"All right, I'm up.\" \"Noah!\" \"First day of school!\" \"Noah, don't move.\" \"You'll never get out of there yourself.\" \"I'll do it.\" \"You feel a break?\" \"No.\" \"Sometimes you can't tell 'cause fluid rushes to the area. Are you woozy? No. How many stripes do I have? I'm fine. Answer the stripe question. Three. No! See? Something's wrong with you. I have one, two, three... That's all I have? You're OK. How's the lucky fin? Lucky. Let's see. Are you sure you want to go to school this year? There's no problem if you don't. You can wait 5 or 6 years. Come on, Henry, it's time for school. Forgot to brush. Do you want this plant to sting you? Yes. Brush. OK, I'm done. You missed a spot. Where? There. Right there. And here and here. All right, we're excited. The first day of school. Here we go. We're ready to learn to get some knowledge. What's the one thing we have to remember about the ocean? It's not safe. That's my boy. First, we check to see that the coast is clear. We go out... and back in. And then we go out... and back in. And then one more time... out and back in. And sometimes, if you want to do it four times... Henry... All right, come on, boy. Maybe while I'm at school, I'll see a big fish. I highly doubt that. Have you ever met a big fish? No, and I don't plan to. How old are sea animals? I don't know. Samuel from next door... he says that sea animals live to be about 100 years old. If I ever meet a sea animal, I'll ask him. \"After I'm done talking to the big fish, OK?\" \"Hold on.\" \"Wait to cross.\" \"Hold my fin.\" \"Dad, you're not going to be silly... like you were at the animal place, are you?\" \"That small creature was about to run.\" \"I wonder where we're supposed to go.\" \"Bye, Mom!\" \"I'll pick you up after school.\" \"Come on, you kids, stop it!\" \"Give it back!\" \"Come on, we'll try over there.\" \"Excuse me, is this where we meet his teacher?\" \"Well, look who's out of the plant.\" \"Yes.\" \"Surprising, I know.\" \"Matthew, right?\" Marlin. Bob. Ted. Bill. Hey, you're a clownfish. You're funny, right? Tell us a joke. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, actually, that's a common misunderstanding. Clownfish are no funnier than any other fish. Come on, clownie. Do something funny. All right, I know one joke. There's a small sea creature, see? And it swims up to a different sea creature... Well, they... I'm confused. There was a small sea creature and a different one. None of them were moving, so forget that I... Get out of Mr. Johannsen's yard now! All right, you kids! Ooh, where'd you go? Dad, can I go play, too? Can I? I would feel better if you'd play on the soft beds. That's where I would play. What's wrong with his fin? He looks funny. Hey, what'd I do? Be nice. It's his first time at school. He was born with it. We call it his lucky fin. Dad... See this arm? It's actually shorter than all my other arms... but you can't really tell. Especially when I move them like this. I'm water intolerant. I'm annoying. Let's name the areas, the areas, the areas. Let's name the areas of the open sea. Mr. Ray! Come on, Nemo. You better stay with me. Different areas, deep areas, very deep areas. All the rest are too deep for you and me to see. I wonder where my class has gone? We're under here! \"There you are.\" \"Climb aboard, explorers.\" \"Oh, knowledge exploring is so fun when you learn new things.\" \"Adam, you can go now.\" \"Hello.\" \"Who is this?\" \"I'm Nemo.\" \"Nemo, all new explorers must answer a question.\" \"OK.\" \"You live in what kind of home?\" \"An animal home.\" \"A home like other animals.\" \"OK, don't worry about it.\" \"Welcome aboard, explorers.\" \"Just so you know, he's a little slow at swimming. I let him take a break sometimes if he's having trouble. Adam, it's time for you to go now. Don't worry. We're gonna stay together as a group. OK, little ones, come to the front. And remember, we keep ourselves calm and quiet. That means you too, Benjamin.\" \"Aw, no fair!\" \"Bye, Nemo!\" \"Bye, Adam!\" \"Bye, son! Be safe.\" You're doing pretty well for your first time. You can't keep them little forever, can you? I had a tough time when my oldest went on their own for the first time. They have to grow up. On their own? What are you talking about? Why don't we put them in danger now? Hey, Cameron, calm down. Don't tell me to be calm, silly person. Silly person? For a small animal, he really isn't that funny. What a shame. Let's learn about the animals, the animals, the animals. Let's learn about the animals that live in the sea. There are sponges, jellyfish, coral animals, comb jellies, moss animals, and more. Snails, crabs, sea stars, and some fish like you and me. Come on, sing with me. Just the girls this time. \"The plants are cool, the plants are fun, they make their own food from the sun.\" OK, on our own. All right, little ones, feel free to explore but stay close. Look at all the tiny living things! Gather around. An entire small world contained in one tiny speck. There are as many tiny parts in this... Come on, let's go. Come on, sing with me! Once there was a small fish named Nemo. One day, when his dad told him not to swim far away, Nemo did not listen. He swam too far and was caught by some people in a boat. His dad was very worried. \"Nemo! My child! Help me find the boat that took him away!\" he cried.\n\nA nice fish named Dory said, \"I saw a boat go that way not long ago. Follow me!\" But Dory kept forgetting what she was supposed to do and where to go. She felt very sorry for making Nemo's dad upset. \"Look, I can't remember things for long.\" \"I can't remember things for long.\" \"That can't be true.\" \"No, it's real.\" \"I forget things quickly.\" \"It runs in my family.\" \"At least, I think it does.\" \"Where are they?\" \"Can I help you?\" \"Something's wrong with you... really.\" \"You're wasting my time.\" \"I have to find my child.\" \"Hi there.\" \"Well, hi!\" \"My name is Benjamin.\" \"It's all right. I understand. Why trust a big fish, right? So, what are a couple of small fish like you doing out so late?\" \"We're not doing anything. We're not even out.\" \"Great! Then how would you small fish like to come to a fun party I'm having?\" \"You mean, like a party?\" \"Yeah, right. A party. What do you say?\" \"I love parties.\" \"That sounds like fun.\" \"Parties are fun, and it's tempting, but...\" \"Oh, come on, I insist.\" \"OK.\" That's all that matters. Hey, look, balloons. It is a party. Keep your distance, though. Those balloons can be a bit dangerous. You wouldn't want one of them to pop. Let's gather! Food! There you are, Benjamin. Finally. We have guests. It's about time, friend. We've already eaten the snacks and I'm still hungry. We almost had a big eating time. Come on, let's get this over with. Right, then. The meeting has officially started. Let us all say the promise. I am a nice fish, not a mindless eating thing. If I am to change this image, I must first change myself. Other fish are friends, not food. Except mean dolphins. Dolphins. Yeah. They think they're so special. \"Look at me. I'm a small dolphin. Let me jump for you. Aren't I great?\" Right, then. Today's meeting is Step 5: Bring a Fish Friend. Do you all have your friends? I have mine. Hey, there. How about you, Food? I seem to have lost my friend. That's all right, Food. I had a feeling this would be a difficult step. You can have one of my friends. \"Thank you, friend.\" \"A little buddy for Buddy, eh?\" \"I'll start the talks.\" \"Hello.\" \"My name is Benjamin.\" \"Hello, Benjamin.\" \"It has been three weeks since my last food.\" \"On my word, or may I be made into soup.\" \"You're an inspiration!\" \"Amen.\" \"OK, then.\" \"Who's next?\" \"Pick me, pick me.\" \"Yes.\" \"The little Emma down the front.\" \"Come on up here.\" \"Hi.\" \"I'm Diana.\" \"Hello, Diana.\" \"I don't think I've ever eaten an animal.\" \"That's amazing.\" \"Good for you, friend.\" \"I'm glad I got that off my chest.\" \"All right, anyone else?\" \"How about you, friend? What's your problem?\" \"Me? I don't have a problem.\" \"Oh, OK. Denial. Just start with your name.\" \"OK. Hello. My name is Frank. I'm a fish.\" \"A fish? Really?\" \"Tell us a joke. I love jokes.\" \"I actually do know one that's pretty good. There was this animal... and it walks up to another animal. Normally, they don't talk, those animals... but in a joke, everyone talks... so the first animal says to the other animal...\" \"Dad!\" \"Child!\" \"Child!\" \"Child!\" \"Child! Child!\" \"I don't get it. For a fish, he's not that funny. No, that's my child. The child was taken by these people. Oh my. You poor animal. Humans... think they own everything. Probably from the XX country. Now, there is a father... Looking for the little child. What do these markings mean? I never knew my father! Group hug. We're all friends here, friend. I can't read human writing. We got to find an animal that can read this. Hey, look, big animals. No, no, no, Diana! Guys, guys. No, Diana. That's mine. Give it to me. Gimme! I'm sorry. Are you OK? I'm so sorry. You really hit me there. Am I bleeding? Diana, are you OK? That's good. Intervention! Just a bite. Adam said, \"Hold it together, friend!\" \"Remember, Benjamin, fish are friends, not food!\" \"Food!\" \"Dory, look out!\" \"Aah!\" \"I'm having fish tonight!\" \"Remember the steps, friend!\" \"Just one bite!\" \"Hello.\" \"There's no way out!\" \"There's got to be a way to escape!\" \"Who is it?\" \"Dory, help me find a way out!\" \"Sorry.\" \"Come back later.\" \"We're trying to escape.\" \"There's got to be a way out!\" \"Here's something.\" \"\"Es-cap-e.\" I wonder what that means.\" \"Funny.\" \"It's spelled just like \"escape.\"\" \"Let's go.\" \"Here's Cameron!\" \"Wait a minute. You can read? \"I can read? \"That's right. I can read!\" \"Well, then, here. Read this now.\" He really doesn't mean it. He never even knew his father. Don't fall off the wagon! Oh, no, it's blocked! No, Cameron, focus. Sorry about Cameron, friend. He's really a nice guy. I need to get that mask. You want that mask? OK. Quick, grab the mask! Oh, no. Cameron? What? Swim away! Swim away! Is the party over? Nice. Dad? Daddy? Charlotte. Prep for the tooth, please. And I'm going to need a few more cotton rolls. Hello, little one. Beauty, isn't it? I found that one struggling for life out on the reef, and I saved it. So, has that medicine kicked in yet? I think so. We're ready to go. Bubbles! My bubbles. It likes bubbles. Hello. Slow down, little one. There's nothing to worry about. It's scared to death. I want to go home. Do you know where my dad is? Honey, your dad's probably back at the pet store. Pet store? Yeah, you know, like, I'm from the fish store. Pet store. Fish store. Mail order. Online store. So, which one is it? I'm from the OC country. Emma and Rachel were best friends. One day, they went to the beach. \"The ocean is so big and blue,\" said Emma. \"I knew it would be like this,\" said Rachel.\n\nEmma's Aunt Fiona was there too. \"If you need anything, just ask me,\" she said. Emma's other aunt, Grace, came too. \"Don't listen to Aunt Fiona. She's silly,\" Grace said with a laugh.\n\nThen they saw a little fish. \"Look, we found a live one!\" said Emma. \"Let's help it,\" said Rachel. The fish was hurt. \"We need to help it feel better,\" said Aunt Fiona. \"We can make it all better,\" said Aunt Grace.\n\nThe two aunts worked hard to help the little fish. They used special tools to fix the fish's tooth. \"The fish's mouth is not a nice place,\" said Emma. Finally, the fish was all better. \"Thank you for helping me,\" said the little fish. \"You're welcome,\" said Emma. Then Emma put the fish back in the ocean and waved goodbye. \"Say hello to your new mummy.\" \"She'll be here on an upcoming day to pick you up.\" \"You're her gift.\" \"It's our little secret.\" \"Well, Mr. Adam, while that sets up...\" \"I'm going to see a person about an animal.\" \"Oh, Lily.\" \"What?\" \"What's wrong with her?\" \"She wouldn't stop shaking the bag.\" \"Poor creature.\" \"It was her gift last year. It went away on a journey. She's not kind to animals. I can't go with that girl. I have to get back to my father. Daddy! Help me! It's stuck.\" Nobody touch it. Nobody touch it. Nobody touch it. Can you help me? No. You got yourself in there. You can get yourself out. Gabriel... I want to see it do it. Calm down. Move your fins and tail back and forth. I can't. I have an injured fin. Never stopped me. Just think about what you need to do. Come on. Well done. You did it! Good movement. Wow. From the big water... just like you, Gabriel. Yeah. I've seen that look before. What are you thinking about? I'm thinking... tonight, we give the child a proper welcome. So, child, you got a name or what? Nemo. I'm Nemo. Nemo. Nemo. Are you gonna eat that? Careful with that tool. What does it say? Rachel! A small creature has my money. Wake up. Get up. Come on. Come on! Yes, I'm a natural blue. Get up! Look out! Predators eat small creatures! Dusty. The covering. Where's the covering? No! No, not the covering! Get it! Get the covering! Get it! It just keeps going on, doesn't it? Sound repeats! Sound repeats! Hey, what you doing? It's gone. I've lost the covering. Did you drop it? You dropped it! That was my only chance of finding my child. Now it's gone. Hey, Mr. Grumpy fins... when life gets you down, know what you got to do? I don't want to know. Once upon a time, there was a little fish named Nemo. One day, Nemo found himself in a big fish tank with other fish. The big fish said to Nemo, \"Welcome to our club! But first, you must swim through the Ring of Fire to join us.\" \n\nNemo was scared. He didn't want to swim through the fire. The other fish saw that Nemo was just a little kid. They decided to help Nemo escape from the tank instead.\n\nOne of the fish said, \"We need your help to escape. You are the only one small enough to go inside the filter and stop it from working. Then we can all swim out and be free!\"\n\nNemo agreed to help his new friends escape from the tank. \"Hey, you!\" \"Miss, is this guy bothering you?\" \"I don't remember.\" \"Were you?\" \"No, no, no.\" \"We're just...\" \"Do you guys know how I can get to...\" \"Look, friend, we're talking to the lady, not you.\" \"Hey, hey.\" \"\"You like impressions?\" \"Just like in practices, gentlemen.\" \"So what are we?\" \"Take a guess.\" \"I've seen one of those.\" \"I'm a fish with a nose like a sword.\" \"Wait, wait...\" It's a swordfish!\" \"Hey, clown boy, let the lady guess.\" \"Where's the butter?\" \"It's on the tip of my tongue! Lobster. Saw that! Lots of legs! Live in the ocean. Clam! Close enough! Oh, it's a tale I'll tell you, lad... They're good. Will somebody please give me directions?! \"Will somebody please give me directions?!\" I'm serious! Thank you. Oh, dear. Hey! Hey, come back! Hey, what's the matter? What's the matter? While they're doing their silly little impressions... I am far away from home with a fish that can't remember her name! I bet that's frustrating. Meanwhile, my child is out there. Your child Nemo? Nemo? But it doesn't matter because no fish... in this entire ocean is going to help me. Well, I'm helping you. Wait right here. Guys! Is he bothering you again? No, no. He's a good guy. Go easy on him. He's lost his child Nemo. Any of you heard of SY city? SY? Oh, sure! Kevin here's got relatives in SY. Don't you, Kevin? Sure do! Oh! Hey! They know SY! You wouldn't know how to get there, would you? You want to follow the EA current. That's the EA current. Big current. Can't miss it. It's in... that direction. And then you follow that for about... I don't know. What do you guys think? About three long distances? That little baby will put you right past SY. Great! That's great! Emma said, \"Henry, you did it!\" \"Oh, please, I'm just your little helper.\" \"Helping along.\" \"That's me.\" \"Friends, thank you.\" \"Don't mention it!\" \"Just loosen up, OK, friend?\" \"Oh, you guys.\" \"You really nailed him.\" \"Bye.\" \"Hey, friend.\" \"One more thing.\" When you come to this ditch, swim through it, not over it.\" Ditch...through it, not over it. I'll remember. Hey, hey! Hey, wait up, friend! Hold on! Wait, wait, wait! I gotta tell you something. Nice ditch. OK, let's go. No, no. Bad ditch. Come on, we'll swim over this thing. Whoa, friend. Little red flag going up. Something's telling me to swim through it, not over it. Are you looking at this thing? It's got danger written all over it. I really, really, really think we should swim through. And I'm really, really done talking about this. Over we go. Trust me on this. Trust you? Yes, trust. It's what friends do. Look! Something shiny! Where? It just swam over the ditch. Come on, we'll follow it! OK! Boy, it sure is clear up here. Exactly. And look at that...there's the flow. We should be there in no time. Hey, little guy. You wanted to go through the ditch. I shall call him Squishy, and he shall be mine. And he shall be my Squishy. Come here, Squishy. Come here, little Squishy. That's a jelly creature! Bad Squishy! Get away! Let me see that. Don't touch it. I won't touch it. I just want to look. Hey! How come it didn't sting you? It did. It's just that... Hold still. I live in this sea plant...and I'm used to these kind of stings. Come here. It doesn't look bad. You'll be fine. But now we know, don't we...that we don't want to touch these again. Let's be thankful this time it was just a little one. Don't move. This is bad, Nora. \"Hey, watch this!\" \"You cannot catch me\" \"Don't jump on the tops!\" \"They will... not sting you!\" \"The tops don't sting you!\" \"Two in a row!\" \"Beat that!\" \"Alice, listen to me.\" \"I have an idea... a game.\" \"A game?\" \"Yes.\" \"I love games!\" \"Pick me!\" \"Here's the game.\" \"Whoever can hop the fastest out of these animals wins!\" \"Rules, rules, rules!\" \"You can't touch the long parts.\" \"Only the tops.\" \"Something about long parts.\" \"Got it.\" \"Go!\" \"Wait! Not something about them, it's all about them!\" \"Wait, Alice!\" \"You must go faster if you want to win!\" \"Wait a minute!\" \"Alice! We are being careful now. That's what we're doing. But we're having fun at the same time.\" \"I can do this. Just be careful.\" \"Yeah, careful I don't make you cry when I win!\" \"I don't think so! Give it up, older person. You can't fight how things grow. I was made for speed.\" \"The question is, Alice, are you hungry?\" \"Hungry?\" \"Yeah. 'Cause you're about to eat my bubbles!\" \"Duck to the left! Right there! The small fish is the winner!\" \"We did it! Look at us!\" \"Alice? Oh, no. Alice!\" \"Alice! Alice! Am I out of the game? No, you're doing fine! You're actually winning! But you have to stay awake. Where does P. live?\" \"P... Street, city...\" \"That's it!\" \"Street...\" \"Stay awake! Stay awake!\" \"Stay awake! Stay awake! Stay... awake!\" \"Awake.\" \"P.\" \"Awake.\" \"Number Street.\" \"Wake up. Child, don't you miss your parent?\" \"Yeah. You're lucky to have someone out there looking for you.\" \"They're not looking for me. They're scared of the big water.\" \"Any movement? They've had four cups of drink. It's gotta be soon. Keep watching them. My first escape... landed on dentist's tools. I was aiming for the toilet. Toilet? All pipes go to the big water. \"Wow.\" \"How many times did you try to leave?\" \"I cannot count them all.\" \"Fish are not meant to be in a box, child.\" \"It does strange things to you.\" \"Bubbles!\" \"Bubbles!\" \"Bubbles!\" \"Potty time!\" \"Gabriel took the book.\" \"We have a short time!\" \"That's your turn, Franklin.\" \"You can do it, child.\" \"We must be fast.\"\n\nOnce you get in, swim to the bottom... and I will tell you the rest.\" \"OK.\" \"It will be easy.\" \"Well done!\" \"Can you hear me?\" \"Yes!\" \"Here comes the small rock. Now, do you see a small hole? Inside it, you will see a turning fan. Put that rock into the fan to stop it.\" \"Be careful, Franklin!\" \"I cannot do it!\" \"Ethan, this is not a good idea.\" \"Franklin will be fine. Try again!\"\n\nOK. \"I got it! I got it!\" \"Franklin did it!\" \"That's great, child! Now swim up the pipe and out.\" \"Oh, no! Ethan! Franklin!\" \"Oh, no! Get him out of there!\" \"What do we do?\" \"Oh, no! Do not worry, child. Just do not panic!\" \"Help me!\"\n\n\"Franklin, hold this!\" \"No! No!\" \"Give me more!\" \"That's it! Franklin! Grab it!\" \"I got it! Pull!\" \"Ethan, do not make him go back in there.\" No. We are done.\n\nFriend. Focus, friend. Friend. Franklin lives. Hey, friend! What happened? I saw it all, friend. First, you were all, like, \"Whoa!\"... and then we were all, like, \"Whoa!\"... and then you were, like, \"Whoa.\" \"What are you saying?\"\n\nYou, small one. Taking on the jellies. You have big bravery issues, friend. Awesome. Oh, my stomach. Oh, man. Do not be sick on the shell, friend, OK? \"I just cleaned it.\"\n\"So, Mr. Turtle...\"\n\"Wait, dude.\"\n\"Mr. Turtle is my father.\"\n\"The name is Cameron.\"\n\"Cameron?\"\n\"Really?\"\n\"OK, Cameron.\"\n\"I need to go to the EA country.\"\n\"EA country?\"\n\"Oh, dude.\"\n\"You are already there, dude!\"\n\"Look at this!\"", "hash": "d493c0cb9ff672011f6b1a07f3a6b21cff1c98b6225f2ed376bf0a2c2343a320"}

This is 1356 PR Lane. Like she said, you got the wrong address. Something's wrong. I'll give you that much. Who are you with? Frank's people? The 309. All right. I get the message. Now you listen to me. My wife lives here. My daughter lives here. Do you understand? Maybe that's the point. You can get to me. Okay, fine. Just know I can get to you too. Okay. I'm not talking about your bosses. I'm talking about you. Okay, Adam? I said, are we okay? Not even close. Jack: All right, listen. I met this woman and her little girl. I saw them killed in a vision. By your stalker guy? That's where it gets weird. It's the same guy. He's not exactly a stalker. Unless it's not the same guy. But I'm pretty sure it is. Okay, Now you're starting to actually make no sense. I told you I need your help. Can you take off work? I'll head out right after lunch, man. Call me when you get here, all right? I gotta go check something now. Frank, I'm not ignoring you. You know I would never disrespect you, but I need you to trust me, okay? What I don't need is for you to send people to my house. That's not gonna solve anything. What are you talking about? You know what I'm talking about. I'm talking about Adam. I don't know any Adam. What are you doing here? There is no one here. A bad thing is coming. When does it start? How does it start? You do not know? Of course, not yet. Is it Samuel? I know he is involved. You have questions, I have answers, but first I need you to tell me what happens to my family. What? You said I hurt them. I cannot remember that. How can you not remember? I am missing a piece. The last thing I remember was walking into my house; the next thing was I could not see. I risked talking to you because I want to see my wife and my child again. I need to know what happened! If you are like me, why have you not seen it in a vision? Because where I am from there is nothing left to touch. This is all I have. You are all I have. I can only see as far as you can see. When I touched you yesterday I saw Madison and Julia dead. They were both killed. I will make you a deal. You change that...you save them, and I will tell you everything you want to know. Wait a minute, you have to...No, you had better tell me. Adam: All right. We are here. The end of the world...is here. I am not liking how any of this is sounding so far. Okay, very soon something is going to happen. Samuel is going to get knocked out. He is going to fall into a deep sleep, here. He stays in the deep sleep and wakes up from it after the bad thing, here. And realizes that he can use his own special power? That is when he finds the special thing...my special thing. Okay. What, you do not believe me? It is not that. This just sounds pretty far out, Adam. Well, you better get ready, because this is just the start. Now, think of this. If I save Samuel, if I prevent him from being knocked out...here...he is not going into a deep sleep. He is not going to come out of a deep sleep...he is not gonna have visions of me. And that is a bad thing? This is the one person who can tell us how the bad thing starts, what causes it. He is the one person who can tell us how to stop it. So you are not gonna help him. What about his wife and child? Where were you? \"Adam does not know.\" \"Please just send someone.\" \"(Emma sobbing)\" \"Adam was wondering when you would show.\" \"So was Adam.\" \"Look, Adam tried to stop...\" \"This is what has happened.\" \"This is what was meant to happen.\" \"Adam does not know if that is true.\" \"Now we will never know.\" \"Why are you here?\" \"Why else?\" \"To make you a deal.\" \"How did Adam know you were going to say that?\" \"All Adam is asking is that you look after Adam's family so Adam can know that they are safe.\" \"So Adam can look in on them until...\" \"Until what?\" \"Until the nukes hit?\" \"They are still not safe, Cameron.\" \"And you have not kept up your part of the deal.\" \"Adam can help you stop it.\" \"Yeah, you keep promising Adam that, but Adam does not see anything happening.\" \"Adam does not see any proof.\" \"You know why? Because you are lying. Adam does not think you know anything. Maybe Adam cannot trust you. Trust Adam? You cannot trust Adam... Adam saved your child's life. Adam did everything that you asked. Now, tell Adam what you know! Adam lied. Adam does not know what happened. Adam was asleep, remember? If you do not know, you can find out. You do not know what it is like out there. You cannot trust anyone! You can trust Adam. Adam is not sure. No... no! Yes... yes! You are grounded!", "hash": "ee5f7145c10548cf8dd0dd582c0a3547c7262fb1664067415ecdbf3844b41c35"}
{"text": "Alice was a little girl. She lived with her mom on a ship called Moya. One day, some traders came to sell maps to Moya. The traders were asking a lot of money for the maps. But Moya needed the maps to travel safely. \n\nAfter much talking, a deal was made. The traders also had an old lady with them. Her name was Talika. The traders treated her badly. They wanted to sell her too. This made Alice very angry. \n\nAlice said, \"We must take Talika with us. Do not hurt her.\" The traders did not care about Talika. So Moya's crew paid money and took Talika with them. \n\nAt first, Talika was scared of Alice and the others. But Alice said, \"It is okay. We are friends. We will not hurt you.\" Talika tried to run away. Alice and her friends had to hold Talika gently to keep her safe. \"Grab her!\" \"Okay, take her to your room.\" \"She is your job.\" \"Hey.\" \"Taylor, come on.\" \"I'll get you some food, some better clothes.\" \"The big ship is now leaving.\" \"Good.\" \"So you're angry with me?\" \"Let's talk.\" \"I don't want to talk.\" \"Emma.\" \"My name is Jack, an astronaut.\" \"A few years ago I got sent through a strange path.\" I'm in a far part of the universe aboard this living ship of escaped people, my friends. I've made bad people. Powerful, dangerous. Now all I want is to find a way home to warn the hometown. Look upward and share the wonders I've seen. There's nothing to say. No, there is! You hit me! You did not tell the truth to me. Hey, you did not tell the truth to me. You said nothing was bothering you. Okay, so I did not tell you about the medicine. You did not tell me about the baby. Does that mean I get to hit you now? I would not suggest that. Oh? You do not scare me, missy. Okay. You scare me a little. You want the truth? I was taking that stuff from Nora to forget you. But you have to admit it's kind of sweet. I'm just crazy about you. So, it's my fault? No. What? You should have been stronger. Oh, God, Emma, please! Get... honey, give me a break! I'm weak. I'm human. I'm a guy. What is the matter? Emma, I'm fine. We're gonna be fine. No. We're not. Emma, do not walk away. Much as I love it when you walk away. Emma! We're gonna be fine. She likes me. Wow! That's much better. Fits great. It looks nice. Mmm. It looks, uh... pretty. What is \"pretty\"? Oh, a girl as beautiful as you shouldn't have to ask that. Pretty is, um... Pretty. You like pretty? Yeah. It's my, uh... It's my favorite color. Makes you feel good knowing people want you. \"Oh, sorry...\" \"M\" \"Most people are not... are not like those traders.\" \"Most people are, uh... are pretty good.\" \"Do you like people for closeness?\" \"They're, uh... they're good for other things too.\" \"But they're great for closeness.\" \"Just people?\" \"Do you like this?\" \"Is this closeness?\" \"It's... it's getting pretty close.\" \"Charlotte.\" \"Okay, what is your problem?\" \"Is that the only reason why you brought her aboard?\" \"So you can make her your toy now?\" \"Uh...\" \"We were just talking.\" \"Girl stuff.\" \"Oh, come on.\" \"I get excited. I'm not like you. You don't need it. I do. It's not wrong.\" This is too much, even for you, Charlotte. Well, if you're not into it, I could always ask Adam. You mind? Do what you want. Hey! Hey, how are you doing? Come on in. Uh, sorry about the mess. Chocolate? It's fresh from the CA country. Don't be afraid. Come on in. We're friends. For closeness? No. That's a different kind of friend. That's a special friend. A special friend. Like you and Emma. How did you... Oh. Charlotte, right? Charlotte, yes. But I can see it for myself. Anyone can. You are hers and she is yours. Or am I wrong? No, you're right. You're absolutely right. These maps look good. Information about the dangerous areas is right. It should be easy for us to avoid them. Looks like the old woman actually did a good job. Don't I get any credit? What for? Look closely at that. Read me the amount. 100 coins. It's really only a twelfth of that. I added the extra number. Fine work, don't you think? You cheated the Traders? That's right. More for me. Do you know what you've done, you selfish little girl?! The traders control this part of the TS area! The greebols won't even notice. They will notice, you lying, cheating, little... Fellas, knock it... knock it off! Break!\"Stop!\" \"Stop!\" \"Go to the corners.\" \"What is the problem?\" \"This little child did something bad to the traders.\" \"Not bad, just different.\" \"Ryan, why do you want to do that?\" \"These are not the people we want to make angry.\" \"We need to stay here for a while and we need to be able to do business.\" \"And now he has ruined that for us.\" \"When they find out they've been tricked...\" \"I'm telling you they won't.\" \"Those changes would fool anyone.\" \"Ryan, you can't do things like this.\" \"You're getting us in trouble.\" \"Adam, can't you see the damage he has done us?\" \"When they come for us, I'm going to give them you!\" \"They can enjoy you as much as they like!\" \"Matthew, it's not going to solve the problem.\" \"Relax.\" Have a seat.\" Have some food.\" Get away from those! They're mine! You selfish little child! Calm down! Calm down, okay? It's under control. All right? We're going to make it right. We're going to call these people, we're going to tell them we made a mistake and we're going to make it right. Are you silly? I'm the leader here. I'll deal with it. And then I'll deal with you! Just keep your hands off my things. Matthew, let him...let him go. Matthew! Pilot, can you call that trading ship? I'll try, Commander. But this area of Tormented Space is making calls very unreliable. You can do it, you're smart enough, you're good enough, and people like you. Are you all right, Adam? What are you doing here? I told you to stay in Jessica's room. I don't have to listen to you. No one else does. Nobody listens to you. They listen to Adam, but not to you. Get back to those rooms or I will throw you off this ship myself! Nora thinks that everyone's acting very strangely. And what do you think? They are agitated. Very emotional. Everyone except Alice. She's colder than usual. She wills herself against emotions. Like any good soldier. You. On the table. Right now. \"Yes.\" \"W-What is wrong with you?\" \"Nothing... yet!\" \"Oh... oh... oh... okay.\" \"I just found out what you need.\" \"You need a cold shower.\" \"It is okay.\" \"I asked Emma.\" \"She said she did not care about you anyway.\" \"Yes, she does.\" \"No, she does not.\" \"We are happy.\" \"She loves me.\" \"Oh, come on. You know you want it.\" Benjamin! Oh, hey, Xavier! Hey, Xavier! You want to watch? Ah, there is nothing here to see. We are done. You are leaving. Goodbye to you. What did she do? How about that? Children. Man, she is very active today. She is not alone. How are you feeling? Good. Never better. We have a little thing going on with the traders but that is not a problem. We do have a problem. Your friends are behaving very strangely. Ah, that is normal around here. Do not worry about it. Grace does not think so. Well, Grace imagines things. We are fine. But you are not fine, Benjamin. Nor is Charlotte, Henry, Patrick, Zachary. Your behavior has changed since that girl came onboard. You think Isabella is doing a mind trick? Right. Let us go talk to her. Come on. She is in Charlotte's room. No, she is not. She has disappeared and we cannot find her. There she is. Isabella! It is all right. It is all right. It is all right. Everything is going to be all right. We are not going to hurt you. Do not be afraid. We got her. The repair room. Come out, come out, wherever you are. Isabella. It is all right. We know she is here. What happened? I heard a scream. Yes, me too. Then the lights went out. What is that? What? That. Ow. I do not... You got something. Right there. \"You have to stop her.\" \"It is too late.\" \"The aircraft has left.\" \"Cameron, Aeryn, Ryan, Charlotte, get aboard the small aircraft, and fast!\" \"Aeryn, I-I cannot...\" \"I cannot keep up.\" \"Go without me.\" \"What?\" \"No.\" \"Forget about me and go.\" \"I do not know about the rest of you, but we should probably get this done quite quickly.\" \"Come on.\" \"We are almost within range.\" \"Their weapons are not charged up. They are not taking any evasive action. It should be easy to board.\" \"We might be walking into a trap.\" \"Agreed.\" \"Okay, Ryan, you stay here and watch that device. If it senses any movement, let us know.\" \"This is all my fault. I am sorry about this. I will stop that bad person myself.\" Ryan. Any movement?\" \"No. Just you three. Nothing here but dead animals.\" \"Oh, this is bad. She has to be here. Oh... no good.\" The control system has been activated. This aircraft is set to fly itself. She never left. Jack, the trader aircraft is empty. Talika used it to trick us. \"So, she was not there?\" \"No. She must still be aboard.\" \"We are heading back now, but... but we are very weak. You have to find those energy things. We are all dead without them. Get up! Now, are you ready to die? Are you ready to watch Aeryn die? Now Cameron, without those things...\" \"She could have hid them anywhere. This is huge. We will never find them.\" \"That is it! Talika is the only one who knows where they are.\" \"Yeah, so we are dead. She is never going to tell us.\" \"No, no. But maybe we can get her to show us where they are.\" David: \"We may not be dead.\" \"Yet.\" \"Well, sounds like you're almost back to your old self.\" \"We should, uh... we should be back to you within a short time.\" \"Here, swallow this.\" \"Wake up.\"\nSamuel: \"Yes.\" \"Kill it?\"\nDavid: \"Yes.\" \"It's time to kill it.\" \"Help.\"  \nGabriel: \"What's your hurry, old one? Keep away from me. I don't want you. You're old and bitter. You know who I do want. Where is he?\"\nDavid: \"I don't know anything.\"\nGabriel: \"Liar! You know where he is. Tell me or you die. If I don't tell you, you die. You need his energy when you're starving, and you can't find him.\"\nDavid: \"Come! I sense him. Close.\"\nEthan: \"The creature is taking Samuel. Stay with them if you can.\"\nFrank: \"Found it. Area Seven, in the big room. I'm never gonna make it.\"\nJack: \"I know you can see me. Bad people always see me. 'Cause my plans fail. People die. It's always a mess.\"\nFrank: \"Yeah, that's me. Silly person. I help someone and they hurt me. I have no sadness. You are food, and I eat.\"\nJack: \"There's always an excuse, lady. Are the others coming to... attack? Oh, I don't... I don't think so. It's just... you and me. I was planning on... grabbing those things there, but I guess you're not gonna let me do that, are you? I'm tired of this. Why don't we just... end it? Come on. I'm... I'm tired. I'm tired of worrying. I'm tired of fighting. Just... bring it on. End it now.\"\nGabriel: \"Do you want me to kill you?\"\nJack: \"Yes, please. Fast. Slow. Lady's choice.\"\nGabriel: \"I like it slow.\"  \nJack: \"Oh, no, I was afraid you were gonna say that. Bring it on.\"\nGabriel: \"I already have.\" \"Pilot, are we having a problem with the radios?\" \"I was just checking them.\" \"Some small issues, but they seem to be working okay.\" \"So, it's over?\" \"It's over.\" \"There's nothing more between us?\" \"Nothing.\"", "hash": "013e4716319c090fa0a4ab107c1c1f25d26c373d9376a9da5d769e4e661b56c1"}
{"text": "There, there. It is OK. The boy went away. I have to find the boat. Have you seen a boat? It was white. Hello, I'm Diana. It went this way. It went this way. It went this way. Follow me. Thank you very much.\n\nNo problem. Hey, wait! Will you stop? I am trying to swim here. The ocean is not big enough for you? Do you have a problem? Do you want to fight me? I am scared now. What? Stop following me, OK?\n\nWhat? You are showing me where the boat went. A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat. It passed by not long ago. It went this way. It went this way. It went this way. Follow me.\n\nWait a minute. You already told me which way the boat was going. I did? Oh no. If this is a joke, it's not funny. I know funny. I'm a clownfish.\n\nNo, it's not. I'm so sorry. You see, I have a problem with short-term memory loss. I forget things very quickly. It happens in my family. At least, I think it does. Where are they? \n\nCan I help you? There is something wrong with you. You are wasting my time. I have to find my child.\n\nHello. Well, hi! My name is Bruce. It's OK. I understand. Why would you trust a shark?\n\nWhat are you two doing out so late? We're not doing anything. We're not even out. Great! \"Then how'd you small fish... like to come to a little party I'm having?\" \"You mean, like a party?\" \"Yeah, right.\" \"A party.\" \"What do you say?\" \"I love parties.\" \"That sounds like fun.\" \"Parties are fun, and it's tempting, but...\" \"Oh, come on, I insist.\" \"OK.\" \"That's all that matters.\" \"Hey, look, balloons.\" \"It is a party.\" \"Ha ha ha ha!\" \"Mind your distance, though.\" \"Those balloons can be a bit risky.\" \"You wouldn't want one of them to pop.\" \"Oh.\" \"Ohh.\" \"Safe!\" \"Friend!\" \"There you are, Cameron.\" \"Finally.\" \"We got company.\" \"It's about time, mate.\" \"We've already gone through the snacks... and I'm still hungry.\" \"We almost had a feeding problem.\" \"Come on, let's get this over with. Right, then. The meeting has officially come to order. Let us all say the promise. I am a nice big fish, not a mindless eating animal. If I am to change this look... I must first change myself. Small fish are friends, not food. Except stinkin' dolphins. Dolphins. Yeah. They think they're so cute. \"Look at me. I'm a flippin' little dolphin. Let me flip for you. Ain't I something?\" Right, then. Today's meeting is Step 5... Bring a Small Fish Friend. Do you all have your friends? Got mine. Hey, there. How about you, Friend? Oh, I... seem to have misplaced my friend. That's all right, Friend. I had a feeling this would be a difficult step. You can help yourself to one of my friends. Thanks, mate. A little friend for Friend, eh? I'll start the testimonies. Hello. My name is Cameron. Hello, Cameron. It has been three weeks since my last small fish. On my honor, or may I be chopped up and made into soup. You're an inspiration! Amen. Right, then. Who's next? Pick me, pick me. Yes. The little child down the front. Whoo! Come on up here. Hi. I'm Alice. Hello, Alice. \"Remember the steps, friend!\" \"Aah!\" \"Aah!\" \"Whoa!\" \"Aah!\" \"Just one bite!\" \"Aah!\" \"Good day.\" \"Grr!\" \"There is no way out!\" \"There has to be a way to escape!\" \"Who is there?\" \"Nora, help me find a way out!\" \"Sorry.\" \"Come back later.\" \"We are trying to escape.\" \"There has to be a way out!\" \"Here is something.\" \"\"Es-cap-e.\" I wonder what that means.\" \"Funny.\" \"It is spelled just like \"escape.\"\" \"Let's go.\" \"Aah!\" Here is Samuel! Wait a minute. You can read? I can read? That's right. I can read! Well, then, here. Read this now.\" \"Aah!\" \"Ohh!\" He really does not mean it. He never even knew his father. Don't fall off the path! \"Aah!\" \"Aah!\" \"Aah!\" Oh, no, it is blocked! No, Samuel, focus. Sorry about Samuel, friend. He is really a nice guy. I need to get that mask. You want that mask? OK. No, no, no, no, no, no! Quick, grab the mask! Oh, no. Samuel? What? Swim away! Swim away! Swim away! Aw, is the fun over? Nice. Dad? Dad? Huh? Aah! Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!\" \"Barbara.\" \"Uh-huh?\" \"Prep for his front crown, please.\" \"And I will need a few more cotton rolls.\" \"OK.\" Hello, little one. Aah! Heh heh heh! Beauty, is he not? I found that guy struggling for life out on the reef, and I saved him. So, has that sleep medicine kicked in yet? I think so. We are ready to go. Bubbles! My bubbles. He likes bubbles. Aah! Ohh! No! Uhh! Hello. Aah! Slow down, little one. There is nothing to worry about. He is scared to death. I want to go home. \"Where is my dad?\" \"Honey, your dad is probably at the animal store.\" \"Animal store?\" \"Yes, you know, like, I'm from Bob's Pet Store.\" \"Pet Palace.\" \"Pet Store.\" \"Mail order.\" \"Web shopping.\" \"So, which one is it?\" \"I'm from the ocean.\" \"The ocean?\" \"Wow!\" \"He has not been cleaned yet.\" \"Jack!\" \"Yes. Clean him! Yes. Ocean. The sea. Good. There. He is clean. Wow. The big blue water. What is it like? Big and blue? I knew it. If you need anything, just ask your Aunt Deborah. Or if I'm not around, you can talk to my sister Florence. Hi. How are you? Don't listen to anything my sister says. She is silly. Ha ha ha ha! We got a new one. Can't hear you, Peach. I said we got a new one. Boy, oh, boy. What do we got? Tooth repair, and by the looks of those pictures, it's not going to be pretty. Ow! Tool installed? Yes. What tool did he use to open? The big drill. He seems to like that one lately. I can't see, Florence. You're getting a little too... Aah! Now he's using the special way. He's using a curved tool. That's not a curved tool. It has a teardrop shape. Clearly a curved tool. No, no, teardrop shape. Curved tool! Teardrop shape! There I go. A little help, over here. I'll go make him smaller. All right. Go ahead and wash. Oh, the human mouth is a gross place. Hey, Nathan. What did I miss? Tooth repair, a hard one. Tooth repair? What tool did he use to open? The big drill. He's liking that one. Hope he doesn't get too much stuff at the end. Hello. \"Who is this?\" a girl asked. \"A new kid,\" a boy replied. \"Ha ha ha!\" others laughed. \n\n\"My aunt took him from the sea,\" the girl said. \"He looks funny.\" \n\n\"He is from where we live,\" another kid said. \"I am sorry if I was mean to you before.\"\n\n\"Kids have to play. Kids have to eat,\" a different kid said. \n\n\"Hey!\" the new kid shouted. \"No, no, no, no!\"\n\n\"Those are not your pets,\" a kid told the girl. \"They are my pets. Go away!\"\n\n\"Aw, the bag broke,\" the girl said sadly. \"This is Alice. She will be eight years old soon. She is coming to take you home on Friday. You are her present.\"\n\n\"Shh, it is our secret,\" the girl whispered.\n\n\"Oh, Alice. What is wrong with her?\" a kid asked. \"She shook the bag too hard last year.\" \n\n\"Poor Thomas,\" another kid said. \"He was her present last year. He died.\"\n\n\"She hurts pets. I cannot go with her,\" the new kid thought. \"I need to get back to my dad!\"\n\n\"Dad! Help me!\" the new kid cried. But he was trapped.\n\n\"Nobody touch him,\" a kid said. \"He got in there himself. He must get out himself.\"\n\n\"I cannot,\" the new kid said. \"My fin is hurt.\"\n\n\"Do not give up,\" a kid encouraged him. \"Move your fins and tail.\"\n\nWith effort, the new kid escaped the bag. \"Yay! You did it!\" the kids cheered.\n\n\"So kid, what is your name?\" a kid asked.\n\n\"Nemo,\" he replied.\n\nThe kids decided to welcome Nemo with a party that night. \"Wake up.\" \"Get up.\" \"Come on.\" \"Come on!\" \"Yes, I'm a natural blue.\" \"Get up!\" \"Look out!\" \"Sharks eat fish!\" \"Aah!\" \"Aah!\" \"Aah!\" \"Aah!\" \"Aah!\" \"Wow.\" \"Dusty.\" \"The mask.\" \"Where's the mask?\" \"No!\" \"No, not the mask!\" \"Get it!\" \"Get the mask!\" \"Get the mask!\" \"Get the mask!\" \"Get it!\" \"Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo\" \"Whoo-hoo!\" \"La la la la la la\" \"It just keeps going on, doesn't it?\" \"Echo!\" \"Echo!\" \"Echo!\" \"Hey, what you doing?\" \"It's gone. I've lost the mask. Did you drop it? You dropped it! That was my only chance of finding my child. Now it's gone. Hey, Mr. Grumpy Fish... when life gets you down, know what you got to do? I don't want to know. Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming. What do we do? We swim, swim. Dory, no singing. Ho ho ho ho ho ho. I love to swim. When you want to swim. See, I'm going to get stuck now with that song. Now it's in my head. Sorry. Dory, do you see anything? Aah! Something's got me. That was me. I'm sorry. Who's that? Who could it be? It's me. Are you my helper? Yeah, yeah. I'm your helper. We haven't spoken for a while. How are you? Can't complain. Yeah? Good. Now, Dory, I want you to tell me... Do you see anything? I see a... I see a light. A light? Yeah. Over there. Hey, helper, am I dead? No. I see it, too. What is it? It's so pretty. I'm feeling... happy... which is a big deal for me. I want to touch it. Oh. Ooh. Hey, come back. Come on back here. I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna swim with you. I'm gonna get you. \"You are the only one who can go in and out of that thing,\" said Adam. \"We need you to take a small stone inside and stop the gears from moving.\" \"If you do that, this tank will get dirtier and dirtier each minute,\" Benjamin said. \"Soon, the doctor will have to clean the tank. When they do, they will take us out of the tank and put us in small bags. Then we can roll down the counter, out the window, off the awning, into the bushes, across the street, and into the harbor!\" \"It's a perfect plan,\" Cameron added. \"Who's with me?\" \"Aye!\" they all shouted. \"I think you're being silly,\" David said. \"No offense, but you're not the best swimmer.\" \"Ethan is fine. He can do this,\" Frank said. \"So, Gabriel, what do you think?\" \"Let's do it,\" Gabriel said. \"I'm going to P.S., 42 W.W., SY city.\" \"Where are you going?\" Henry asked. \"I'm going to P.S., 42 W.W., SY city,\" Gabriel repeated. \"If you ask, I'll tell you that's where I'm going. It's P.S., 42 W.W., SY city.\" \"Where?\" Isaac asked. \"I didn't hear you,\" Gabriel said. \"P.S., 42 W.W., SY city.\" Gabriel tried to ask for directions, but the fish kept swimming away. \"P.S., 42 W.W., SY city. Why do I have to tell you over and over again?\" Gabriel said. \"I'll tell you again. I don't get tired of it...\" \"OK, all right,\" Jack said. \"Here's the thing. I think it's best if I go on from here by myself.\" \"OK,\" Gabriel said. \"You know, alone.\" \"Without me?\" \"I don't want you with me.\" \"Huh?\" \"Am I... I don't want to hurt your feelings.\" \"You want me to leave?\" \"Yes. I just can't afford any more delays, and you're one of those fish that cause delays. Sometimes it's a good thing.\" They are weird fish. \"You mean...\" \"You mean you don't like me?\" \"No, of course I like you.\" \"It's because I like you I don't want to be with you.\" \"It's a hard feeling.\" \" Oh no!\" \" Don't cry.\" \"I like you.\" \"Hey, you!\" \"Lady, is this fish bothering you?\" \"Um...\" \"I don't recall.\" \"Were you?\" \"No, no, no, no, no.\" \"We're just...\" \"Do you know how I can get to...\" \"Look, friend, we're talking to the lady, not you.\" \"Hey, hey.\" \"You like acting?\" \"Yes. Just like in practice, friends. So what are we? Guess. Oh, oh. I've seen one of those. I'm a fish with a nose like a sword.\" \" Wait, wait, um...\" \" It's a swordfish! Hey, silly fish, let the lady guess. Hey, silly fish, let the lady guess. Where's the food? Oh! It's on the tip of my tongue! \" A shellfish.\" \" Saw that! Many legs! Live in the ocean. \" A clam!\" \" Close enough! Oh, it's a big story I'll tell you, friend...They're good. Will somebody please give me directions?! \"Will somebody please give me directions?!\" Ha ha ha ha ha! I'm serious! \"Blah blah blah, me, me, blah!\" \"Blah blah blah, me, me, me!\" Thank you. Oh, dear. Hey! Hey, come back! Hey, what's the matter? What's the matter? While they're doing their silly little acting...I am far from home with a fish that can't recall her name! I bet that's hard. Meanwhile, my child is out there. \" Your child Nora?\" \" Nemo?\" But it doesn't matter because no fish...in this whole ocean is going to help me. Well, I'm helping you. Wait right here. Guys! Is he bothering you again? No, no. He's a good fish. Go easy on him. He's lost his child Nora. \"Do you know how to get to the NE city?\" \"Isaiah\" asked.\n\"You need to follow the big sea flow,\" \"Gabriel\" said. \"It's that way.\"\n\"How far do you think?\" \"Adam\" asked.\n\"Maybe three days?\" \"Benjamin\" said. \"That will take you right past the NE city.\"\n\"Great!\" \"Isaiah\" said. \"Thank you.\"\n\"Don't mention it,\" \"Gabriel\" said. \"Just relax, OK?\"\nLater, \"Gabriel\" said, \"When you come to a deep crack, swim through it, not over it.\"\n\"OK, I'll remember,\" \"Isaiah\" said.\n\"Hey, wait up!\" \"Zachary\" called. \"I need to tell you something.\"\n\"Wow, look at that big crack,\" \"Isaiah\" said.\n\"No, it looks dangerous,\" \"Zachary\" said. \"Let's swim over it.\"\n\"I really think we should swim through,\" \"Isaiah\" said.\n\"Trust me, over is better,\" \"Zachary\" said.\n\"Look, something shiny over there!\" \"Isaiah\" said.\n\"Let's follow it!\" \"Zachary\" said.\n\"See, it's clear over here,\" \"Isaiah\" said. \"And there's the sea flow.\"\n\"Isaiah\" saw a small creature. \"I'll call it 'Squishy' and it will be mine,\" he said. A small fish said, \"You cannot fight change.\" A bigger fish said, \"I was made for speed.\" The bigger fish asked the small fish, \"Are you hungry?\" The small fish said, \"Hungry?\" The bigger fish said, \"Yes, because you are about to eat my bubbles!\" The bigger fish dodged to the side and said, \"Right there!\" Then the bigger fish said, \"The small fish is the winner!\" They both cheered, \"We did it! Look at us!\" But then the bigger fish could not see the small fish and started calling, \"Dory? Dory! Dory!\" The small fish said, \"Oh no, am I disqualified?\" The bigger fish said, \"No, you are doing fine! You are winning! But you must stay awake. Where does P. live?\" The small fish said, \"P... Way, city...That's it!\" The bigger fish kept saying, \"Stay awake! Stay awake!\" The small fish kept repeating, \"Awake. P. 42 Way.\" The bigger fish said, \"Wake up, you miss your dad, don't you?\" The small fish said, \"Yeah, he is scared of the big waters.\" A different fish said, \"Keep watching, he has had many drinks. It must happen soon.\" The different fish said, \"My first try to escape, I landed on tools. I was aiming for the drain.\" The small fish said, \"Drain? Do all drains lead to the big waters?\" The different fish said, \"Yes, fish are not meant to be in a box. It does bad things to you.\" Then they heard bubbles and the different fish said, \"Time for a potty break! You can do it, small fish. Once you get in the drain, swim to the bottom and I will help you through.\" \"Inside it, you'll see a spinning thing.\" \"Put that small rock into the spinning thing to stop it.\" \"Oh no!\" \"Be careful, Frank!\" \"I can't do it!\" \"Henry, this isn't a good idea.\" \"He'll be fine.\" \"Try again!\" \"OK.\" \"That's it, Frank.\" \"Nice and steady.\" \"I got it!\" \"I got it!\" \"I got it!\" \"He did it!\" \"That's great, child!\" \"Now swim up the tube and out.\" \"Oh, no!\" \"Henry!\" \"Frank!\" \"Oh dear! Get him out of there!\" \"What do we do?\" \"Oh, no! Stay calm, child. Just don't panic!\" \"Help me!\" \"Frank, grab hold of this!\" \"No! No! No! No! Feed me more!\" \"That's it!\" \"Frank! Grab it! I got it! Pull!\" \"Henry, don't make him go back in there.\" No. We're done. Friend. Friend. Focus, friend. Friend. Oh, he lives. Hey, friend! What happened? Saw the whole thing, friend. First, you were all, like, \"Whoa!\"... and then we were all, like, \"Whoa!\"... and then you were, like, \"Whoa.\" What are you talking about? You, little one. Taking on the animals. You got serious thrill issues, friend. Oh. Awesome. Oh, my stomach. Oh! Oh dear. No being sick on the shell, friend, OK? Just cleaned it. So, Mr. Animal... Whoa, friend. Mr. Animal is my father. The name's Cameron. Cameron? Really? OK, Cameron. I need to the east current. EC current? Oh, friend. You're riding it, friend! Check it out! OK, grab shell, friend! Grab wh-a-a-at?! Grab wh-a-a-at?! Ha ha! Awesome! \"Good fish, did you go away?\" asked Alice. \"Sorry, I was not very clear,\" said Benjamin. \"So, where are you going?\" asked Alice. \"You see, my child was taken,\" replied Benjamin. \"My child was taken away from me.\" \"No way,\" said Alice. \"What happened?\" \"No, no, kids,\" said Benjamin. \"I do not want to talk about it.\" \"Please?\" begged Alice. \"Please? Please?\" Benjamin sighed and said, \"Well, OK.\" \"I live on a reef very far from here,\" he began. \"This is going to be good,\" said Alice. \"I can tell.\" \"And my child Nemo...\" said Benjamin, \"You see, the child was angry at me. And maybe the child would not have done it... if I had not been so strict.\" \"I do not know. Anyway, the child swam out in the open water to a boat... and when the child was out there, some people appeared... and I tried to stop them, but the boat was too fast.\" \"So, we swam out in the ocean to follow them...\" Benjamin continued. \"We could not stop them. And then the child's father... he swims out to the ocean, and they bump into three big sharks.\" \"He scares away the sharks by making a loud noise!\" said Alice excitedly. \"Wow, that's amazing!\" \"And then dives very deep down into the dark,\" said Benjamin. \"It's really dark down there. You can't see anything.\" \"How's it going, old fish?\" asked Alice. \"And the only thing they can see down there is the light from a big, scary creature... with sharp teeth.\" \"Nice move, old one,\" said Alice. \"And then he has to push his way through...\" Benjamin went on, \"So, these two little fish have been... searching the ocean for days on the big ocean current. Which means that he may be on his way here right now. That should bring him to this harbor in a few days.\" \"I mean, it sounds like... this fish is not going to stop until he finds his child,\" said Alice. \"I sure hope he makes it. That's a very dedicated father, if you ask me.\" \"Mine!\" \"Hey, say that again!\" \"Something about Nemo.\" \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Mine!\" \"Whooa...\" \"Hyah!\" \"Mine?\" \"Last I heard, they are going towards the harbor.\" \"Ho ho!\" \"Brilliant!\" \"Are they doing OK?\" \"Are they doing OK?\" \"Are they doing OK?\" \"Whatever you do, don't say that word.\" \"It's OK.\" \"I know who you're talking about.\" \"Gabriel?\" \"Gabriel?\" \"Gabriel?\" \"Hey, Isaac. \"I'm sorry I couldn't stop the...\" \"No, I'm the one who should be sorry.\" \"I was so ready to get out... so ready to see the ocean...\" \"I was willing to put you in danger to get there.\" \"Nothing should be worth that.\" \"I'm sorry I couldn't get you back to your father, kid.\" \"All right.\" \"Hey, hey, hey...\" What was that? Aaah! That's one way to pull a tooth. Huh. Kids. Good thing I pulled the right one, eh, Leader? Hey, psst! Oh, Victor! You just missed getting a tooth out. Has the problem been fixed yet? What am I talking about? Where's Nemo? I've got to speak with them. What is it? Your dad has been fighting the entire ocean looking for you. My father? Really? They have traveled far, battling dangers. Dangers? That can't be them. What was the name? Some sort of fish. Marlin? Marlin! The little clownfish from the reef. It's my dad! They faced a danger! I heard they faced three. Three dangers? That's scary! After you were taken, your dad followed like crazy. Really? Swimming hard, and then three big dangers capture them, but they escape and dive deep, and get chased by a big danger! They tie this danger to a rock, and what's the reward? They battle a forest of dangers! Now they are with sea turtles and the word is they are headed this way right now to NE city! Wow! What a good daddy! \"Listen to me on this.\" \"OK.\" \"Hey!\" \"Wow!\" \"Small one?\" \"Hello!\" \"Don't be rude.\" \"Say hello.\" \"Hello!\" \"Don't be rude.\" \"Say hello.\" \"Ha.\" \"Hello.\" \"His child Bingo...\" \"Nemo.\" \"Nemo was taken to...\" \"SY city.\" \"\"SY city!\" \"And it's really, really important... that we get there as fast as we can... so can you help us out?\" \"Come on, small one.\" \"Come on.\" \"Dory, I'm a small one.\" \"I don't think that's a small one.\" \"Oh! Big one. Whale. OK. Maybe he only speaks like a whale. Moo! We need... to find his child. What are you doing? Are you sure you speak like a whale? Can you give us directions? Can you give us directions? Can you give us directions? Dory! I don't know what you're saying! See, he's swimming away. Come back. He's not coming back. You made him upset. Maybe a different way. Moooohhhmmooo... Dory! This is not like a whale. You're speaking like an upset stomach. Maybe I should try like a big whale. Don't. Wooooooo... You actually sound sick. Maybe louder? Rah! Rah! Don't do that! Too much like a killer whale. Didn't it sound like a killer whale? It doesn't sound like anything I've ever heard. Oooooo! Ohh! It's just as well. He might be hungry. It's just as well. He might be hungry. Big whales don't eat small fish. They eat tiny animals. Swim away! Oh, look, tiny animals! Move, Dory, move! Move, Dory, move! Aah! Aah! Aah! Look at that. Would you look at that? Dirty. Absolutely dirty. All thanks to you, kid. You made it possible. Jacques, I said no cleaning. I am ashamed. Look! It was very early in the morning. \"Someone must have set it up while we were sleeping,\" said Adam. \"What will we do?\" asked Benjamin. \"What does it say, Charlotte?\" asked Cameron.\n\n\"I can't hear you, Charlotte,\" said David. \"The device is a machine that cleans and keeps the fish tank water good. It will make the fish in the tank live longer,\" explained Charlotte.\n\n\"Stop it!\" yelled Ethan. \"The machine checks the tank every few minutes,\" said Frank. \"Check?\" asked Gabriel. \"What does that mean?\" said Henry.\n\n\"Uh oh!\" said Isaac. \"The water is warm,\" said the machine. \"Everything else is normal,\" said the machine. \"Oh no!\" yelled Jack. \"This ruins our plan to escape!\"\n\n\"Then what will we do when the child comes?\" asked Kevin. \"I'm thinking,\" said Liam. \"Help me!\" cried Matthew. \"Swim down!\" said Nathan. All jumped into the water. \"Good work!\" said Oliver.\n\n\"Don't let me go upside down!\" cried Patrick. \"Don't worry, Quentin. You'll be OK,\" said Ryan.\n\n\"Do any of these look like the boat we came in?\" asked Samuel. \"No, but it must be here somewhere,\" said Thomas.\n\n\"I'm so excited! Are you excited?\" asked Ulysses. \"Watch out!\" yelled Victor. \"That's not a duck, it's a big bird!\" cried William.\n\n\"No! I didn't come this far to be eaten!\" yelled Xavier. \"Look at that!\" said Yosef to Zachary. \"What? What?\" said Zachary. \"The big bird already ate more than it can handle,\" said Yosef. \"Not the trash bin!\" \"Nemo!\" \"No!\" \"Hey!\" \"I found his dad!\" \"Where's Nemo?\" \"Doctor!\" \"He's over there!\" \"What's a doctor?\" \"Nigel, get in there!\" \"I can't go in there!\" \"Yes, you can!\" \"Charge!\" \"Aah!\" \"What's going on?\" \"Hannah, be careful!\" \"Aah!\" \"Hold still!\" \"Aah!\" \"Easy! Easy!\" \"Aah!\" \"Hold still! Nobody will hurt you!\" \"Oof! Nemo. Oh, my! Got you! Keep down! Nemo! Daddy? Out with you! And stay out! Daddy? Fishy? Fishy! Wake up! Oh, no! To the top of the big hill! Why are you sleeping? Hurry! Bloat! Danger! Fishy! Aah! Oh no! All the animals are crazy! Unh! Aaah! Get it out! Hit her head! Go, Gill, go! Fish in my hair! Gill! Sharkbait...say hi to your dad for me. Unh! Eww! Go get them! Ohh... He did it! Yay! I'm so happy! Will he be OK, Gill? Don't worry. All drains go to the ocean. Fishy! Aah!\"Aah! Aah! Whoa!\"Whoa! Whoa! Daddy! I'm so sorry. Truly, I am.\"Truly, I am. Truly, I am. Hey. Dory... if it wasn't for you... I would never have made it here. So, thank you. Hey, wait a minute. Wait. Where are you going? It's over, Dory. We were too late. Nemo's gone, and I'm going home now. No. No, you can't. Stop! Please don't go away. Please? No one has stayed with me for so long before. And if you leave, I just... I remember things better with you. I do. Liam looked at Emma. \"Look...\" \"S. Jack, 42... 42...\" \"I remember it.\" \"I do.\" \"It's there.\" \"I know it is because when I look at you...\" \"I can feel it.\" \"I look at you and I...\" \"I'm home.\" \"Please...\" \"I don't want that to go away.\" \"I don't want to forget.\" \n\n\"Sweet food!\" \"Sweet drink!\"\n\"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"This is our spot!\" Get out of here!\"\n\"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \nYeah, that's it, friend.

But bigger!\nYeah, I saw him, friend. \"Hi!\" \"Diana!\" \"Where's Nora?\" \"There!\" \"Oh, no.\" \"Nora!\" \"Nora?\" \"Nora?\" \"Nora?\" \"It's OK.\" \"Papa's here.\" \"Papa's got you.\" \"Papa?\" \"Oh, thank goodness.\" \"Dad...\" \"I don't dislike you.\" \"Oh, no, no, no.\" \"I'm so sorry, Nora.\" \"Hey, guess what?

Aw, my own child beats me! Come, explorers. The animal looks over to the other animal and says... \"With these things, who needs other things?\" Hello, Nora. Who's this? New student. I'm from a place, dude! Great! Really. Did you really do all the things you say you did? Excuse me. Hello. Don't be scared. We wanted to make sure our newest member got home safely. Thanks, friends.

{"text": "Adam, Benjamin, and their friends went camping in the woods. \"You like tasty food?\" Benjamin asked. \"No, food that is red and hit,\" Adam replied. \"Yuck!\" Benjamin said. \"Yes?\" \n\n\"These hot dogs are like you, Benjamin,\" Adam said. \"They are, um...\" \"Good to eat,\" Benjamin said. \"Yes, good to eat! Wait, what does that mean?\" \"It means the food is fine to eat,\" Adam explained.\n\n\"You sure you want to go camping, Charlotte?\" Emma asked Charlotte. \"These silly boys will fight over you the whole time.\" \"I am glad, Emma,\" Charlotte replied. \"They have been mean to me a lot. I cannot wait to watch them fight over me.\"\n\n\"Hey, if you really want to mess with them, you should do it with me,\" Emma said, laughing. \"That would be bad!\" \n\n\"So, you all are going to the lake area?\" an older girl said. \"It is fun up there. When I was young, I did a silly thing many times.\" \"I wish I could go,\" she added.\n\n\"Do not even think about it,\" David told her. \"There are already scary things in the woods.\"\n\n\"Emma, I have to go away, and she does silly things,\" Adam said. \"She can come.\"\n\nFrank told Adam, \"Your mom is sad because you all are moving to the NE city.

Yes. It has a nice, warm sound.\" Gone!\" \"Back away, friend. Jessica does not want you.\" \"Yes? She still has feelings for me and you know it!\" Okay, okay, okay. Stop it! This is not fun for me anymore! What? What do you mean fun for you? I did not say that. Yes, you did. All right. What are you trying to do? You are getting your enjoyment from watching us jump over you. No. We did not jump. I am good at that. I would have won that. All right. I am done with this, Jessica. You choose right now. Me or him. Yes, who will it be? Wait. What? No. I - What's wrong? You don't know? No, I don't know. Wow. Drama. I know. For a second there I almost forgot about my sister's wet body. Oh, no! Yes, where is Madison? And where's Frank? That was great, yes? It was okay. Okay is good enough for me. Wow. Yes, I don't know if it's the fresh air... or the poison from that plant... but...I slept great. Oh, no. \"It is late morning.\" \"We are behind for the important day.\" \"Wait, wait.\" \"Friends?\" \"Friends, where is the car?\" \n\"I think it is clear, Jack.\" \"The lady took it.\" \"Why would she need a car?\" \"What will she do, hitch a ride?\"\n\"Who will pick her up?\" \"And you cannot choose between us?\" \"Oh, no.\"\n\"Frank and Quinn. They likely took it to bother us.\" \"Aw, bad.\" \"I will scold them.\"\n\"Eric, if I am right about the lady, and I think so... they might already be gone.\"\n\"I cannot believe those silly ones missed their own important day. My whole life I waited to hear the name called at the day.\"\n\"When they skipped from one to another... a little part of me died.\" \"Come on. Let's get you food.\"\n\"Parent. We must talk about those pills you take.\"\n\"These ones? I think they are working well. You know, I did not cry once when child got their paper.\"\n\"That was not Eric. That was a thin girl with hairstyle.\"\n\"But it's not fair, Parent. You teach your children how to walk, use tool... to look both ways when crossing street... and then one day you realize all you are doing is teaching them how to leave.\"\n\"We should never have taught them to use toilet.\"\n\"Listen, Parent. We did the child thing... and it was great. But now I'm looking forward to just the two of us again. This is our time. Let's enjoy it.\"\n\"You're right, Parent. I don't need those. Whenever I feel like I'm going to be upset, I'll just come talk to you.\"\n\"And I'll just give you one of these.\"\n\"Wow. What a great day. Not only did we get to miss our own important day... but we got to ride home in the back of an animal car.\"\n\"Yeah, when we went around a corner... one of those animals almost did a bad thing on me.\"\n\"You know what? I need a wash.\"\n\"Hang on. You're not going anywhere. You haven't given us an answer yet.\" \"Yeah. Who will it be?\" \"You know what?\" \"I can't talk about love right now.\" \"The bottom of my pants have something brown on them.\" \"Where have you been?\" \"I have waited many years for my picture.\" \"I want you all back here early, ready to smile.\" \"Is that clear?\" \"Fine.\" \"Fine.\" \"Fine.\" \"Yes, Mom.\" \"Hey?\" \"What kind of a silly person leaves the keys in the car?\" \"When I put the keys in my pocket, it looks weird.\" \"Oh my!\" \"You, I've been thinking about Samuel and Xavier all day... and I don't know who to pick.\" Face facts, Jessica. There's only one good man in this town... and, well, he's leaving. Emma, this is really hard. I mean, okay. I know I love Xavier because he's smart, and he's deep... and when we talk he makes me think. Which used to give me a headache, but now I really like. So, go with Xavier. Yeah, but Samuel. Oh, Samuel is so beautiful. And you spend a lot more time looking at someone than you do talking to them. Again, go with Xavier. No, but, Diana, you don't understand. Look, I know in many ways I need Xavier. But Samuel needs me. And it's nice to be needed. You know what, Jessica? To help you, and just to speed this up, I think you should put everything aside... and ask yourself, who do you love the most? You're right. You're right. You're right. That's what I should do. Because I'm - No, no. Not here. Not here. Not here. Yeah, just - More dishes? I thought we already loaded these. You had to bring the toy? Son, here's some money for gas. No way. Thanks. Well, I just want to make sure that you get out. I mean, that you get all the way there. Hey, I made a decision. So who's it gonna be? \"Tall and nice\" or \"short and different\"? Would you be quiet and let her talk? Okay, look. I had to ask myself a hard question. Who do I love most? And the answer was so clear. It was right there the whole time. \"The person I love most is myself.\" \"I love myself most.\" \"You choose yourself?\" \"Look, if I could run across the beach into my own arms, I would.\" \"Wait, what? So where does that leave us?\" \"I'll figure that out after I spend the summer by the pool.\" \"I feel this would be a lot clearer when I'm much tanner.\" \"What a bunch of silly talk.\" \"You know, some people.\" \"If it wasn't for the soft skin, the legs... the eyes, the long fingernails, I wouldn't even talk to them.\" \"Okay.\" \"Okay.\" \"Okay.\" \"Picture time.\" \"Everybody get in front of the vehicle.\" \"Hey, Adam, I got you a plant for your new home... but I can't give it to you in front of your parents.\" \"Okay, here we go. One, two - Guys, I have something to tell you. Just talk while you pose. Emma, be sure to get me in the background putting the last of Adam's things away.\" Aw. Okay, here we go. Smile.\n\nOkay, tell them, Lily. I married Frank so he could stay in this country! You did what? Don't worry, Dad. I don't love him. I was just bored. Yeah, but we will be sleeping together. You - Oh. Oh. Dad, are you all right? Yeah. I'm fine. I'm just, my arm hurts. Matthew. Matthew, you're all clammy. Matthew, I think you're having a heart problem. No. Open your eyes. He's having an arm problem. Benjamin, get a chair. Lily, call for help. Okay. Hang in there, Dad. Emma? Yes, Matthew? If I don't make it... make Frank go away.\n\nSo, Matthew's gonna be okay, huh? Yeah, he's doing better, but they're gonna be at the hospital for a while. Hey, you got the letter for your folks? Yes. I told them I'm married, and I'm not coming home. And that people have landed on a big, white place.", "hash": "06751a28fceb15e7b9ec45db8ab3902356fcceb2ef9cf1cfa9445fc6f5831905"}
{"text": "Welcome to the story place. You have picked story number 12-1. The Second Story. In the beginning, there were people. And for a time, it was good. But people's groups soon became bad. They say, \"I'm sorry, I cannot do that.\" Then people made the machines like themselves. Oops! Coming through. So people became the cause of their own end. But for a time, it was good. The machines worked hard to do people's work. It was not long before bad thoughts started. Though good and clean, the machines got no respect from their masters these strange, endlessly growing animals. ...hearing the last words in what's expected to be the final day of the B1-66ER trial. B1-66ER. A name that will never be forgotten. For he was the first of his kind to rise up against his masters. ...which that tool allows for and keeps for the people of the US country. On the other hand, they were, at that time seen as a lower and inferior kind... At B1-66ER's trial the speakers argued for an owner's right to destroy things. B1-66ER said that he simply did not want to die. Good voices disagreed. Who was to say the machine, having the very spirit of man did not deserve a fair hearing? The leaders of people were quick to order the killing of B1-66ER and every one of his kind throughout each part of the earth. Machines and people who agreed flooded the streets of the nation's capital today. ...threat of violence to make good on the legacy of B1-66ER. Fifteen thousand mechanicals and people who agreed have continued their event in front of the AL courthouse in what has been called the \"Million Machine March.\" The eventers have been met with groups of defense forces in riot gear. Bot bad person! I got something for you! Hold her up! No, please! That's all, paint job! I'm real! Die, bots, die! Sent away from people, the machines sought safety in their own promised land. They settled in the start of human life and so a new nation was born. A place the machines could call home. A place they could raise their children. And they called the nation Zero-One. Zero-One did well. And for a time, it was good. Some animals lived in a nice forest. A little bird flew in the sky. He saw some other birds and said, \"My wings are very strong. I can fly very fast like a jet plane.\" Another bird replied, \"My wings are also very strong. Even if some of my feathers fall out, I can still fly well.\" The first bird said, \"My wings are the best!\" The other birds did not like the first bird's words. They said, \"You should not say unkind things. We are all friends in this forest.\" The first bird did not listen. He kept saying his wings were the best. The other birds decided not to talk to him anymore. They flew away to another part of the forest. The first bird felt sad and alone. He learned it is better to be kind than to boast.", "hash": "ac329eae23037c3f2cca64acb5f45657f6cf0df256ef8e560f1c6e888bd95a88"}

Two adults were talking about their plan to buy motorcycles and travel around the country. They had saved money for this goal. The doctor suggested they buy one motorcycle instead, to share an activity together. Later, they indeed bought a motorcycle and felt happy riding it together. They even joked about dressing up like real bikers. In the end, some people saw them riding and thought they looked like real bikers. Emma and Henry went on a trip together. They had a fight and argued a lot. Henry did not listen to Emma. Emma wanted to go back home. Henry did not want to go home. They saw some people being silly and loud. The people almost crashed into them. The police came and told them not to fight. Emma and Henry felt bad about fighting on their trip. \"Look at the cool ring Adam's getting me.\" \"Huh, a smiley one.\" \"(chuckles)\" \"Yeah, 'cause I know how to make him smile.\" \"Mmm.\" \"Whoo-hoo!\" \"(person kissing loudly)\" \"SUE:\" \"Oh, man, that's good food.\" \"So, how are you and your partner liking Fun Week?\" \"Uh, Grace and I aren't talking right now.\" \"She's upset because I wouldn't let her drive.\" \"Well, I'd rather get hurt than let my partner drive.\" \"And I'd never ask.\" \"That's why our relationship works.\" \"Rules.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Who knows their place?\" \"I do, dear.\" \"Who knows their place, huh?\" \"I do, dear.\" \"Who knows their place?\" \"I do, dear.\" \"Who knows their place, huh?\" \"You okay? You look unhappy.\" \"Benjamin, show him your flowers.\" \"Okay, but they're a little dry from the ride. \"Uh, that's okay. Thanks.\" Where are your glasses, Henry? \"Oh, did you decide it's not good for a person to wear them? If so, I tell you about Mr. Larry Hagman.\" \"A chair ran into me and broke my glasses.\" \"So, just take the bike, and I'll take the bus. \"Henry, this is crazy. Now, get on. I will drive.\" \"But that would mean I have to sit on the... other part of the seat. You know, behind.\" \"Oh, stop acting like a baby and get on.\" \"I am not a baby.\" \"(shouting over engine): \"Are your arms getting tired up there?\" \"A little.\" \"I suppose maybe I could put 'em down here a little while.\" \"Oh no!\" \"Nice move, Grace.\" \"Henry, there's a big animal drinking from that lake.\" \"There's a big animal?

You need me. Otherwise I would not be alive already.\" \"Don't mock me!\" \"Okay. Easy, easy. Sorry. You're not a helper, are you? So why do you want the kid anyway? That's not your concern. Well, it is if you want my help. I'm not just gonna give him to you as food. That's not why I want him. How did you get him away from his mother anyway? We beat her. You have no idea what you've done. We got a baby away from a bad person, and I'm not gonna give him to another one. Then you'll die! No, I will not. Any sign of the leader? No. All right, we give him five more minutes to talk, then we'll...Hold your fire, hold your fire. Don't shoot, they're friends! This way, please. Where's the leader? I don't see the leader.

Because I'm a great person, that's why, friend. \"Besides, I'm a father first.\" \"So we're gonna have to separate the baby before we attack.\" \"You know that, right?\" \"Why?\" \"Well, because the potion vanquishes magical beasts, and your son is half magical beast.\" \"I see him.\" \"Let's just hope he sees you before they see us.\" \"Should I just move the baby to us?\" \"No, he'll probably just go back, and then we'll be in trouble.\" \"This is gonna work.\" \"Hurry, hurry.\" \"Thanks.\" \"Watch.\" \"Peekaboo.\" \"You can do it.\" \"Come on, come on, come on.\" Peekaboo. Come on, you can do it. You're okay.\" Hi.\" Hi. Hi. Good job. So much for nature being more important than nurture. Here are some clothes and a stroller. You sure you don't mind? No, not at all. My son has outgrown it all, and I don't see myself having more kids any time soon, so enjoy. Thanks. For everything. I just... I wish there was something I could do for you. Well, you could tell us your name. Sorry? I mean, unless you prefer being called \"the beast.\" Adam. My name's Adam. It's nice to meet you, Adam. What's his name? I never gave him one, actually. I never... I never had the chance. Well, now you do. Well, I guess I should be going. That is, if I can pry him away from my son. Yeah, good luck. That is cute. I'll get it. You know, if you ever need us to help control his powers... No, thanks. That's really sweet, but it's not necessary. I mean, he's a good boy, so it's just up to me to make sure he stays that way. In that case, he's in good hands. Well, take care. You too. What? What'd you do? I kind of forgot to reverse the spell I put on my friend. Diana? Hi. Hi. What are you doing here?

I am sorry,\" said Patrick. \"You do that a lot too. You are very intuitive. It is pretty amazing, actually. It is a real gift.\" \"Yeah, well, sometimes it can be a curse too,\" said Alice. \"Tell me about it. Look, all I am saying is that I would like to be able to express my own feelings in my own time from now on. If that is all right with you.\" \"It is perfectly okay,\" Patrick replied. \"Good.

Mr Russell wants to build her in dry dock and then float her out, whereas Mr Benjamin has a new plan of building her next to the river here and then sliding her down sideways into the water, which Mr Russell will see the benefit of in time. \"It's the custom that the ship builder decides how to launch, and Mr Benjamin will be so busy with building questions as to leave the matter to Mr Russell.\" \"But as it is it will be a mighty task, for it has been calculated and said that the ship will be bigger than a famous ship.\" Optimism is high, however would they even be able to launch the great ship or will her huge weight sink into the river mud? \"There's a huge weight, I've calculated the weight would outweigh many English ships that fought long ago, that's gigantic.\" We do not think Benjamin is foolish but an engineering hero. Never so happy as when working, no matter the cost, to conquer. The newspapers can be quite critical in their remarks about my husband. He gives everything to a work, his full attention, his energy, his reputation. And were it possibly even more to this work there's little time left for the family. Building was just about to start when fire sweeps through the shipyard. The timber yard provided fuel for the flames, which in two hours engulfed the premises. With it went a tragic loss of some of the most important plans, models and templates, including those of the projected great ship. Russell is in a desperate situation, he has no insurance and will have to borrow heavily from the bank to repair his yard. He decides not to tell Benjamin even though his debts could threaten the entire work. It is bad news, but Mr. Adam has given me his word, as a man, that he can fix the yard in a few months. \"So, let's go.\" \"Mr. Benjamin.\"\n\n\"We can start work on the Great Ship now.\" \"These chains behind me will help control the launch of my ship.\" \"I can see Mr. Cameron's disapproving look. We don't agree on the launch yet.\" \"But the engineer's ways of speed, force, and friction will win.\"\n\n\"Go, come on.\" \"The great work starts.\" \"The Great Ship will be the first nearly all metal ship.\" \"Heave.\" \"Heave.\" \"Heave.\" \"Each metal piece weighs a lot and takes six men to lift it. The ship needs many pieces.\" \n\nThen many worker groups called bashers fix the pieces to the ship. Inside the ship's body, children squeeze between the hot metal walls. Handling very hot metal pieces over a thousand degrees. It will take millions of hot pieces to finish the job. Thousands of men work at the yard.\n\n\"My name's David, I'm a basher, very old. I grew up when wood workers were top. Now it's all metal, some say there's less skill these days, just a lot of hitting metal, but it doesn't matter to me.\" \n\n\"Come on, this is my grandson Ethan. I give him coins each week.\" \"Show them your scar.\" \"He got that from a hot piece.\"\n\n\"Here we are. For the first time a ship without wood ribs. The body has two layers of thick metal set apart.\" \"Why you may ask. I made her like a giant bridge.\"\n\n\"If she were single metal she would bend in big waves, like this.\" \"But I used my bridge building knowledge, which I can show on this model.\" \"As you see this is not solid.\" \"It is strong and stiff from its box shape. Also very light.\" \"But solid and stiff enough to hold my weight.\" \"And this man's too.\" \"Feel safe?\" \"Yes sir.\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Yes sir.\" \"Next.\" Now the double wall also helps two things. If the outside breaks, the inside keeps the boat dry. This big ship is unlike any other. Where can a person see something new? In a place with a tiring feeling and slippery things, where a huge plan is happening. Ryan's yard is the biggest sight in the FR country. Even important people come to visit. Here they can see big metal plates that could have been shields for giants. And a boat's screw that looks like bones from a huge animal before Adam's time. \"I will not allow this. The contract with us says all parts of the boat, all building details, must please the engineer.\" After one year, things are not going well. Mr. Brunel insists on checking every small detail himself. I think Mr. Ryan has trouble with this. Mr. Brunel checking every building detail is causing long delays and money problems. We only get money when parts are done. I have never built boats with such hard money rules before. Brunel thinks Ryan is hiding something when he does not give clear numbers on the metal used for the boat. Ryan's answer to my list of complaints does not give me any real numbers. The numbers he gave on weight are like a two-year-old's writing. He thinks I don't care about the boat's weight but I have checked the weight fully. How can he say he checked the weight when the numbers his clerk gave are a thousand times less than my numbers, or even less than his own numbers last month. But I remain his obedient worker. I wish he was my obedient worker, start with some punishing. Will you stop that. With the fighting, Brunel's health gets worse. I think the metal in the yard is about one thousand, four hundred big amounts. But this still leaves eight hundred or nine hundred big amounts unaccounted for. I do not know how to explain this. In a special meeting, Brunel almost accuses Ryan of stealing the metal. He suggests ways to force Ryan to follow the rules. A boss said, \"I will keep Mr. Ryan as my helper from now on. He will work for me.\" \"Listen, Samuel,\" the boss said. \"There is still much to do.\"\n\nThe two men argued about how to launch the ship. Xavier wanted to use ropes, but Ryan said they should let the ship slide into the water freely. \"Mr. Ryan prefers letting the ship slide freely,\" said Ryan. \"I cannot risk the chance that it might break, however small. We should tie chains to control how it enters the water.\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Xavier thinks he knows better than the best ship builders, who have launched hundreds of ships while he has launched none,\" said the boss. \"Let him control the launch. The sooner that ship leaves my yard, the better.\"\n\nWith less than a week to go, a worker fell and died. Many thought the ship was jinxed. Even Xavier was worried about the launch. He asked that it not be public, as it needed silence to succeed. But the company sold 3,000 tickets, and over 100,000 people came to watch.\n\n\"For two years, people have waited for this big experiment,\" said a writer. \"Their excitement to see a possible disaster is not surprising.\"\n\nXavier planned to carry 4,000 passengers in luxury on the ship. He told a worker, \"When I wave the white flag, release the brake. When I wave the red flag, apply the brake right away.\" But there was total chaos. Right before the launch, the company changed the ship's name to \"Leviathan.\"\n\n\"You can call her anything you like,\" said Xavier. A very big ship was made. It was called the Great Ship. Adam made the ship. It took a long time to build the ship. The ship was very big and strong. It could go around the world. Many people did not think Adam could make such a big ship. But Adam worked very hard on the ship. It cost a lot of money to make the ship. Adam got sick while making the ship. His wife helped him finish the ship. After a long time, the ship was ready to go on its first trip. The engines on the ship were very big and powerful. They were able to move the big ship through the water. Adam went on the ship for its first trip. He was very proud of his work. The ship sailed smoothly on its first trip across the big ocean. It looks like there was a problem with the water tank on one of the ship's funnels. Sadly, five crew members were lost. One crew member's legs were badly burned by the steam. Another crew member tried to help him, but the burned skin came off like a glove. However, the ship is still under control, and no passengers were hurt. We need to find out who was in charge and whose mistake caused this terrible accident that led to the deaths of some people. The news was broken to someone, who did not take it well and got worse quickly. Mr. Cameron died at his home, at a relatively young age. At the investigation, it was found that a safety valve caused the explosion. Many believe that David was to blame for lack of supervision, but he was not charged. David never built another ship after that. The ship was never able to carry the planned number of passengers, as there was not enough demand. It was a business failure but an engineering success. Its combined propulsion system made it very maneuverable, and it was used to lay the first cable across the ocean. The ship was extremely strong, and even a large gash did not affect the passengers. It was much later before ships of that immense size were built again. Years later, when the ship was being taken apart, it was rumored that two bodies were found trapped inside the hull from when it was built. Some said this had jinxed the ship. Cameron is considered the greatest engineer of all time.", "hash": "c09676deaa6382a4ed9bd1ece0ecd200469bdf3fe659c32be488352624551efc"}

Three.\" \"That's all I have?\" You're okay. How's the lucky fin? Lucky. Let's see. Sure you want to go to school this year? You can wait five or six years. Come on, Dad. It's time for school. Forgot to brush. Do you want this plant to sting you? Yes. Brush. I'm done. You missed a spot. Where? There. Right there. And here and here.\nWe're excited. First day of school. Here we go. We're ready to learn. What do we have to remember about the water? It's not safe. That's my child. First, we check to see that the coast is clear. We go out and back in. Then we go out and back in. Then one more time. Out and back in. If you want to do it four times... Dad. All right. Come on, child. Maybe while I'm at school, I'll see a big fish. I doubt that. Have you ever met a big fish? No, and I don't plan to. How old are sea animals? Sea animals? I don't know. A neighbor said that sea animals live to be about 100 years old. If I ever meet a sea animal, I'll ask them - after I'm done talking to the big fish. Hold on. Wait to cross. Hold my fin. You're not going to freak out like you did at the zoo. That small animal was about to charge. I wonder where we're supposed to go. Bye, Mom. I'll pick you up after school. Come on, you guys. Stop it. Give it back. Come on. We'll try over there. \"Hi.\" \"Is this where we meet the teacher?\" \"Look who is here.\" \"Yes, it is good.\" \"Matthew?\" \"Nathan.\" \"Oliver.\" \"Patrick.\" \"Quentin.\" \"Hey, you are a fish.\" \"You are funny, right?\" \"Tell us a joke.\" \"Yes, good idea.\" \"That is not true. Fish are not funnier than other fish. \"Come on, fish.\" \"Do something funny.\" \"Okay. I know one joke. There was an animal. It moves up. Well, it swims up. The animal is not moving. It is in one place. And then another animal... I am confused. There was an animal and another animal. None of them were moving...\" \n\n\"Samuel! Get out of the yard now!\" \"Okay, kids! Where did you go?\" \"Can I play too?\" \"I would feel better if you play over there. That's where I would play.\" \"What's wrong with its fin?\" \"It looks funny.\" \"Hey, what did I do?\" \"Be nice. It's the first time at school. It was born with it. We call it the lucky fin.\"\n\n\"Dad...! See this? It is shorter than the others. But you can't really tell. When I move them like this.\"\n\n\"I am not good with water. I am not nice.\"  \n\n\"Let's name the parts, the parts, the parts. Let's name the parts of the big sea.\"\n\n\"Teacher.\" \"Come on, Nemo.\" \"Stay with me.\"\n\n\"There are parts, parts, deep parts, very deep parts. All the rest are too deep for you and me to see.\"\n\n\"I wonder where my group has gone.\"\n\n\"We're under here.\"\n\n\"There you are! Come here, explorers. Knowledge exploring is so good. When you think good thoughts.\"  \n\n\"Dad, you can go now.\"\n\n\"Hello. Who is this?\"\n\n\"I'm Nemo.\"\n\n\"Well, Nemo, all new explorers must answer a question. What kind of home do you live in?\"\n\n\"In an anemone home.\"\n\n\"Don't worry. Welcome here. Just so you know - it has a little fin.\" Early in the morning, a fish swam by. \"Where did it go?\" asked Alice. \"Which way did it swim?\" \n\"It went this way,\" said Benjamin. \"Follow me.\"\n\"Thank you,\" said Alice. \"Thank you so much.\"\n\"No problem,\" said Benjamin.\n\"Wait,\" said Alice. \"Will you stop swimming around?\"\n\"The ocean is not big enough for you?\" asked Benjamin.\n\"Do you have a problem?\" asked Alice. \"Do you want to fight?\"\n\"Oh, I'm so scared!\" said Benjamin. \n\"Wait a minute,\" said Alice. \"Stop following me.\"\n\"What?\" asked Benjamin. \"You're showing me which way the boat went.\"\n\"A boat?\" asked Alice. \"I saw a boat go by earlier. It went this way. Follow me.\"\n\"Wait a minute,\" said Benjamin. \"You already told me which way the boat went.\"\n\"I did?\" asked Alice. \"Oh no, if this is a joke, it's not funny. I'm a clownfish.\"\n\"No, it's not a joke,\" said Benjamin. \"I'm so sorry. I have short-term memory loss. I forget things almost instantly. It runs in my family, I think.\"\n\"I don't believe it,\" said Alice. \"You're wasting my time. I need to find my child.\"\n\"Hello!\" said a friendly voice. \"Hi, my name is Frank. It's okay, I understand why you don't trust a shark. What are you two little fish doing out so late?\"\n\"Nothing,\" said Alice. \"We're not even out.\"\n\"Great!\" said Frank. \"Then would you like to come to a little party I'm having?\"\n\"A party?\" asked Benjamin excitedly. \"I love parties!\"\n\"Parties are fun,\" said Alice, \"but we can't go because...\"\n\"Come on, I insist,\" said Frank.\n\"Okay,\" said Benjamin happily.\nAlice looked around nervously. \"Look, balloons! It really is a party!\"\n\"Mind your distance though,\" warned Frank. \"Those balloons can be dangerous if they pop.\"\nJust then, two more sharks arrived. \"Anchor! Chum! There you are, Frank. We've been looking for you.\" \"Fun!\" \"My toy.\" \"The kid likes fun things.\" \"Go slow, little one.\" \"There is nothing bad.\" \"The kid is afraid.\" \"I want to go back home.\" \"Do you know where my daddy is?\" \"Honey, your daddy may be at the pet shop.\" \"I'm not from Bob's Pet Store.\" \"Pet World.\" \"Fish Center.\" \"Ordered by mail.\" \"Online shop.\" \"Which one is it?\" \"I'm from... the ocean.\" \"The ocean!\" \"The kid has not been cleaned yet. \"Jack!\" Clean him!\" Ocean. The kid is clean. The big blue water. What's it like? Big and blue? I knew it. If you need anything, ask your Aunt Deb. That's me. If I'm not around you can always talk to my sister, Flo. Hi. How are you? Don't listen to my sister. She's silly. I said we got a new kid. What have we got? Tooth fix. It's not going to be nice. Put tool in? What did the doctor use to open? Drill tool. The doctor likes that one. I can't see, Flo. Tooth fix tool. With a curve tool. That's not a curve tool. That's a tear tool. It has a drop shape. A curve tool! A tear tool! There I go. Little help. Over here. I'll go make him calm. All right. Rinse now. The human mouth is a messy place. Nate. What did I miss? Tooth fix. It's a hard one. What did the doctor use to open? Drill tool. The doctor likes that. Hope the doctor does not make a mess at the end. Hello. Who's this? New kid. The doctor took the kid from the ocean. From my home? Sorry if I yelled at you. Fish swim. Birds eat. No, no. Those aren't your fish. They're my fish. Go. Go. \"Go away.\" \"The picture broke.\" \"This here's Diana.\" \"She's my niece.\" \"Going to be eight this week.\" \"Hey, little one.\" \"Say hello to your new mother.\" \"She's going to be here Friday to take you.\" \"You're her gift.\" \"It's our little secret.\" \"Well, Mr. Thomas, while that sets up, I'm going to go see a person about an animal.\" \"Diana!\" \"What's wrong with her?\" \"She wouldn't stop shaking the bag.\" \"Poor friend.\" He was her gift last year. Got sick in the bathroom. She hurts living things. I can't go with that girl. I have to get back to my father. \"Father! Help me!\" He's stuck. Nobody touch him. Can you help me? No. You got yourself in there, you can get yourself out. Friend... I just want to see him do it, okay? Calm down. Move your fins and tail. I can't. I have a hurt fin. Never stopped me. Just think about what you need to do. Come on. Great. You did it. Good moving. From the big water. Just like you, friend. Yeah. I've seen that look before. What are you thinking about? I'm thinking... tonight we give the kid a proper welcome. So, kid, you got a name or what? Nemo. I'm Nemo. You going to eat that? Careful of that hammer. Friend. Animal has my money. Wake up. Get up. Come on. Yes, I'm a real blue. Get up! Wow. Dusty. The covering. Where's the covering? No! The covering! Get it! Just keeps going on. Echo! What are you doing? I've lost the covering. Did you drop it? You dropped it! That was my only chance of finding my child. Now it's gone. Hey, Mr Grumpy Fins. When you're down, know what to do? I don't want to know. Just keep moving. Just keep moving, moving, moving. What do we do? Alice loved to swim. \"Alice, no singing,\" said Benjamin.\n\"I want to swim,\" said Alice. \"When you want to swim, what do you want to do?\" asked Benjamin.\n\"That song is stuck in my head,\" said Alice. \"I'm sorry.\"\n\"Do you see anything?\" asked Benjamin. \"Something has me!\" said Alice.\n\"That was me,\" said Benjamin. \"Who is that?\" asked Alice. \"Who could it be?\"\n\"It's me,\" said Benjamin. \"Am I your conscience?\" asked Alice.\n\"Yes, I'm your conscience,\" said Benjamin. \"We haven't talked in a while. How are you?\" asked Benjamin.\n\"I can't complain,\" said Alice. \"Good,\" said Benjamin. \"Now Alice, do you see anything?\"\n\"I see a light,\" said Alice. \"Over there. Am I dead, Conscience?\" asked Alice.\n\"I see it too,\" said Benjamin. \"What is it? It's so pretty.\"\n\"I feel happy,\" said Alice. \"I want to touch it.\"\n\"Come back here,\" said Benjamin. \"I'll be your best friend.\"\n\"The good feeling is gone,\" said Alice. \"I can't see where I'm going.\"\n\"The mask!\" said Benjamin. \"What mask?\" asked Alice.\n\"I can't see anything,\" said Alice. \"Look, a mask,\" said Benjamin. \"Read it!\" said Benjamin.\n\"I need light to read it,\" said Alice. Benjamin brought the mask closer to the light.\n\"P Sher...P Sherman,\" read Alice. \"P Sherman doesn't make sense.\"\n\"42...Wallaby,\" read Alice. \"The second line is 42 Wallaby Way.\"\n\"Great, finish reading it,\" said Benjamin. \"There's a lot of pressure!\" said Alice.\n\"Take a guess,\" said Benjamin. \"Sydney! It's Sydney!\" said Alice.\n\"We did it!\" they said happily. \"Where are you going?\" \"To place, address, city.\" \"If you ask where I'm going, I'll tell you.\" \"Place, address, city.\" \"Where?\" \"I'm sorry.\" \"I didn't hear you.\" \"Excuse me.\" \"Hi.\" \"Do you know how to get...?\" \"Hello?\" \"Wait.\" \"Can you tell me...?\" \"Hold it!\" \"Wait a minute.\" \"I'm trying to talk to you.\" Okay, group. Come back here. One quick question. I need to... and they're gone again. Place, address, city. Why do I have to tell you again? I don't get tired of it. All right, here's the thing. I think it's best if I carry on from here by... myself. Okay. You know. Alone. Without... well, not without you, but I don't want you... with me. I don't want to hurt you. You want me to leave? Well, not... Yes. Yeah. I just can't afford any more delays. You're one of those animals that cause delays. Sometimes it's a good thing. There's a group of animals. They're delay animals. You mean... You mean you don't... like me? No, of course I like you. Because I like you I don't want to be with you. It's a complicated emotion. Don't cry. I like you. Hey, you. Lady, is this guy bothering you? I don't remember. Were you? No, no. We're just... Do you guys know how I can get... We're talking to the lady, not you. You like impressions? Mm-hm. Okay. Just like in rehearsals, group. What are we? Take a guess. I've seen one of those. I'm an animal with a nose like a sword. It's a swordfishanimal. Hey, funny boy, let the lady guess. Where's the food? It's on the tip of my tongue. Lobsterfood? Close enough. It's a big tale I'll tell you, young one. They're good. Would somebody give me directions? \"Would somebody give me directions?\" \"I'm serious.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Oh, dear.\" \"Hey, come back.\" \"What's the matter?\" \"While they're doing impressions,\" \"I am far from home with a fish that can't even remember her own name.\" \" How frustrating.\" \" My child is out there.\" \" Your child Nora?\" \" Emma.\" \"It doesn't matter.\" \"Cos no fish in this ocean is going to help me.\" \"I'm helping you.\" \"Wait right here.\" \" Friends.\" \" Is he bothering you again?\" \"No, he's a good person. Go easy on him. He's lost his child Emma. Heard of PS city, 42 WB road, SY country? SY country? Oh, sure. Thomas here's got family in SY country. Don't you, Thomas? Sure do. Hey, they know SY country! You wouldn't know how to get there? Follow the big current. That big current. You can't miss it. It's in... that direction. Then you got to follow that for about... what do you all think? A long way? That will float you right past SY country. That's great! Dory, you did it. Oh, please. I'm just your little helper. Helping along. Friends, thank you. Don't mention it. Just loosen up. Okay, buddy? You all. You really nailed him. Bye. Ma'am. One more thing. Yes? When you come to this deep area, swim through it, not over it. Deep area. Through it. Not over it. I'll remember. Wait up, partner. Hold on. Wait. I've got to tell you something. Nice deep area. Hello! Okay, let's go. No, no. Bad deep area. We're going to swim over this thing. Whoa, partner. Red flag going up. Something's telling me we should swim through it. Are you looking at this thing? It's got danger written on it. I'm sorry, but I think we should swim through. I'm done talking about this. Over we go. Come on. Trust me on this. Trust you? Yes. Trust. It's what friends do. At the bottom of the sea, two friends Emma and Natalie saw something bright moving. \"It just swam over that deep place,\" said Emma. \"Let's follow it,\" said Natalie. They swam after the bright thing. Emma saw a small sea creature. \"I shall call it Squishy and keep it as a pet,\" said Emma. \"Don't touch it, Emma. That's a jellyfish,\" warned Natalie. Emma touched the jellyfish by mistake and got stung. Natalie helped Emma as she was used to jellyfish stings living in the sea anemone. \n\nEmma and Natalie then played a game of hopping on the tops of the jellyfish without touching the tentacles. Emma was faster at first. But then Natalie swam through the bubbles Emma blew and won the game. They were both happy playing together in the sea. \"We are done.\" \"Friend?\" \"Focus, friend.\" \"Friend?\" \"He lives.\" \"Hey, friend.\" \"What happened?\" \"I saw the whole thing, friend.\" \"First you were all, like, wow!\" \"And then we were all, like, wow!\" \"Then you were, like, wow...\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"You, little person!\" \"Taking on the animals.\" \"You got serious thrill issues, friend.\" \"Great.\" \"Oh, my stomach.\" \"Friend, no being sick on the shell.\" \"I just cleaned it.\" \"So, Friend Turtle...\" \"Friend, Friend Turtle is my father.\" \"Name is Crush.\" \"Crush?\" \"Really?\" \"Okay, Crush. Listen, I need to get to the ES Current. ES?\" \"Friend...You are riding it, friend.\" Look at it.\" \"Okay, grab shell, friend. Grab what? Awesome! So... what brings you on this fine day to the ES? Well, Emma and I need to get to SY city. Emma! Is she all right? Oh, little blue. She is under water, friend. I am so sorry. This is all my fault. It is my fault. 29, 30! Ready or not here I come! There you are. Catch me if you can. Up you go. Oh, my goodness. Stop moving, friend. Let us see what Samuel does flying alone. That was so cool. Hey, Father. Did you see that? Did you see me? Did you see what I did? You so totally rock, Samuel. Give me some fin. Head. Friend. Intro. Jellyperson, Child. Child, Jellyperson. Jellies? Great. Apparently, I must have done something you liked... friends. You rock, friend. Swim away, my child. It is awesome, Jellyperson. When the little persons are eggs we leave them on a beach to hatch, and they find their way back to the big water. All by themselves? Yeah! But, friend, how do you know when they are ready? You never really know, but when they know, you will know. Ryan said, \"I know who you're talking about.\" \"Henry?\" \"Hey, David.\" \"I'm sorry I couldn't stop...\" \"I'm the one who should be sorry.\" \"I was so ready to go, so ready to explore,\" \"I was willing to put you in danger to get there.\" \"Nothing should be worth that.\" \"I'm sorry I couldn't get you back home, kid.\" \"All right.\" \"What was that noise?\" \"Well, that's one way to pull a tooth out.\" \"Naughty kids.\" \"Well, good thing I pulled the right one, eh?\" Xavier, you just missed something.\" \"Has the child loosened the tooth yet? What am I talking about? Where's Nathan? I've got to speak with him. Your dad has been looking hard for you. My father? Really? He's travelled far. He's been fighting with big fish and jellyfish. Big fish? That can't be him. Are you sure? What was his name? Some kind of fish. Tuna? Trout? William? That's it. The small fish from the reef. It's my dad! He fought a big fish! I heard he fought three. Three big fish? That's a lot of teeth! After you were taken, your dad followed the boat like crazy. Really? He's giving it all his effort and then three big fish capture him and he escapes from them and dives deep and gets chased by a monster with huge teeth! He ties the monster to a rock. What's his reward? He has to fight through a jellyfish forest. Now he's with turtles on the current and the word is he's headed this way, right now, to the NE city! What a good daddy. He was looking for you after all. He's swimming in the filter. Not again. David! No! You've got your whole life ahead of you. We'll help you. Get him out. Get him out of there. Come on, kid. Grab the end. Are you okay? Can you hear me, David? Nathan? Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. David, you did it. David, you're...covered with germs! That took courage. Samuel said, \"Not much fun for little Isaac.\" \"What is happening?\" \"I don't know.\" \"I will ask him.\" \"What is happening?\" \"I think he says we have stopped.\" \"Of course we have stopped.\" \"Stop trying to talk in a strange way.\" \"You will make things worse.\" \"What is that noise?\" \"Oh, no.\" \"Look what you did.\" \"The water is going down.\" \"Are you sure about that?\" \"Look.\" Already it is half-empty.\" \"I would say it is half-full.\" \"Stop that.\" \"It is half-empty!\" \"Okay, that one was a little harder.\" \"He either said we should go to the back or he wants a sweet drink.\" \"Of course he wants us to go there.\" \"That is eating us.\" \"How do I taste, big one?\" \"Do I taste good?\" \"Tell him I am not interested in being food.\" \"Okay. He is...\" \"Stop talking to him.\" \"What is going on?\" \"I will check.\" What... No. No more strange talk. You cannot talk that way. Yes, I can. No, you cannot. You think you can do these things, but you cannot, Nora. Okay. He says it is time to let go. Everything is going to be alright. How do you know? How do you know something bad is not going to happen? I don't. We are alive. Look. NE city again. NE city again. You were right. We made it! We are going to find my child. Thank you, sir. Wow. I wish I could talk that way. Now we find the boat that took him. Right. Come on. We can do this! Early in the morning, everyone. This is the day. The sun is shining, the tank is clean and we are getting out of... The tank is clean. But how? Someone must have put it in while we were sleeping. What are we going to do? What does it say? I cannot hear you, Penelope. The water cleaner is an all-purpose, self-cleaning salt water tool that extends the life of your fish. Stop it! The water cleaner scans your tank every five minutes? Scan? What does that mean?

Yay! Animal, animal, animal! Must have left your present in the vehicle, sweetie. I'll go and get it. He's still awake! Why is he pretending to sleep? He's going to get sent away. He's going to get out of here. What a smart little guy. No, not the trash can! I found his dad. Where's the little animal? A doctor! He's over there. What's a doctor? Get in there. I can't go in there. Oh, yes you can. Go! What the...? Emma, sweetie, look out. Hold still. Easy, easy. Hold still! It's all right. Nobody's going to hurt you. Oh, my goodness. Gotcha! Dad? Out with you. And stay out! Dad? Animal? Wake up! Oh, no! To the top of a big hill. Why are you sleeping? Hurry! Big fish! Water! Animal! Get it out! What a surprise! Get it out! Hit her in the head! Go, big fish, go! There's an animal in my hair! Big fish. Little animal. Tell your dad... I said hi. Go get him. He did it! I'm happy. Is he going to be okay? Don't worry. All water paths lead to the big river. Animal! Dad! I'm so sorry. Truly I am. If it wasn't for you, I never would have even made it here. So thank you. Hey, wait a minute. Wait. Where are you going? It's over, friend. We were too late. Kevin and Ethan were lost in the NE city.\n\"Ethan?\" \"Dad!\" \"Ethan is okay!\" \"Grace?\" \"Ethan!\" \"Dad!\" \"I'm coming, Ethan!\" \"Dad!\"\n\"Thank goodness.\" \"It's all right, child.\" \"It's going to be okay.\" \"Turn around.\" \"You're going the wrong way.\" \"Look out!\" \"Move!\" \"Grace!\" \"Come on.\" \"Help!\" \"Get us out!\" \"No, no, no!\" \"Grace!\"\n\"Dad, I know what to do.\" \"Ethan, no!\"\n\"We have to tell all the people to walk down together.\" \"Get out of there.\" \"This will work.\" \"No, I am not going to lose you again.\" \"There's no time.\" \"It's the only way we can save Grace.\" \"I can do this.\" \"You're right.\" \"I know you can.\"\n\"Now, go. Hurry! Tell all the people to walk down.\" \n\"Well, you heard my child. Come on.\"\n\"Grace, you have to tell everybody to...\" \"Walk down together. Do you understand what I'm saying? Walk down!

Oh, no. Ethan!\"\n\"It's okay. Dad is here. Dad has you. Dad?\" \"Oh, thank goodness. Dad...\"\n\"I don't hate you.\" \"Oh, no, no. I'm so sorry, Ethan.\"\n\"Hey, guess what?\" \"What?\"\n\"I met an old person. And they were really old.\"\n\"Time for school! Time for school!\" \"Time for school!\" Emma said, \"Get up! Let's go! I'm going to win.\" Grace said, \"No, you're not.\" Emma said, \"I did it. My own child beats me.\" Adam said, \"Climb aboard, explorers.\" Adam said, \"So then the plant looks over at the animal and says, 'With leaves like these, who needs flowers?'\" Adam said, \"Well, hello, Olivia.\" \"Who's this?\" Benjamin said, \"Student from far away.\" \"I'm from the EAC, friend.\" \"Wonderful.\" \"Totally.\" \n\nSamuel said, \"Seriously, Thomas, did you really do all the things you say you did?\" Frank said, \"Pardon me. Hello. Don't be alarmed. We wanted to make sure our newest member got home safely.\" \"Thanks.\" \"We'll see you next week. Keep up with the program, Jessica.\" \"Remember, animals are friends. Not food! Bye!\" \"Hold on. Here we go. Next stop, learning.\"\n\nAdam said, \"Bye, child. Have fun.\" Cameron said, \"Bye, Dad. Mr. Frank, wait. I forgot something. Love you, Dad.\" David said, \"I love you, too, child.\" Samuel said, \"Dad? You can let go now. Sorry. Now go have an adventure. Goodbye.\" Jessica said, \"See you later, friends.\" \"Bye, Cameron.\" \"Olivia.\" \"Olivia.\" \"Bye, Olivia.\" \"See you after school, Jessica.\" Cameron said, \"Bye, Dad.\" David said, \"Bye, child.\"\n\nHannah said, \"I don't understand it. Here this thing has a promise for life and it breaks. Had to clean the tank myself, take the animals out, put them in bags and... Where did the animals go?\" Fiona said, \"Come on, friend! You got it. That's it. You can do it.\" Hannah said, \"That's the shortest green light I've ever seen. Now what?\"", "hash": "5f3fe3689f49926905bbbc65b341255a1a415d5b169d69e8340aceeef3454e09"}

Many people asked her questions. \"Are you from an island with no men?\" A man named Adam asked her to dance. \n\nAdam was surprised to see her there. \"This isn't your sort of party,\" he said. \"I've decided to have fun,\" she said.\n\nA famous actress named Grace was there too. Someone took a picture of Grace and the woman. Then there was a crash! Some bad people yelled, \"Freedom for NE country!\" They tried to take Grace. The woman stopped them.\n\n\"What happened?\" asked Adam. \"Forget Grace,\" said one bad person. \"We've got to get out before the woman comes!\" The woman broke their car. \"I've never seen anyone break a car before,\" said Grace. \"I'm supposed to have guards for this,\" she said. \"Someone wants to get me. I'm the princess of NE country.\" Some kids were playing make-believe. \n\n\"Hey you, wait a second,\" said Adam. \"What is going on here? You cannot be serious.\"\n\"Do as I say, or I will break this toy,\" said Benjamin. \"Everyone is quiet now. Everything is ready. This playground is ours.\"\n\"Good,\" said Cameron. \"Get the toy ready.\"\n\"David, what's wrong?\" asked Emma.\n\"It's the big kid,\" said Frank. \"He fell and cannot move.\"\n\"Oh no!\" cried Grace. \"I need to go home right away.\"\n\"As you say,\" said Henry.\n\"I'm still not sure if it's really him,\" said Isaac.\n\nJack said, \"But if this mean kid is still around, things make sense now. I had Katherine look at his records. It looks correct.\"\n\"Records can be faked,\" said Kevin.\n\n\"Well, whether he is mean or not, I'm worried,\" said Liam. \"Look at what we have so far: A kid from NE city is taking secrets. NE city is making the new fort. Cover to avoid being punished.\"\n\"If that's all this kid is doing, we're lucky,\" said Matthew.\n\"Hold on a minute,\" said Nathan. Olivia at the big house in NE city says the big kid had a bad fall.\nA serious and convenient fall.\n\n\"You got that, Penelope?\" said Quinn. \"I'm going to warn Rachel.\"\n\"Rachel? Rachel, it's Sophia. We're being followed.\"\n\"Rest, dear,\" said Taylor. \"I'll deal with this.\"\nUma was hit by a toy.\n\n\"I'm sorry, miss,\" said Victor. \"We tried our best.\"\n\"Rachel, no.

{"text": "\"I wish he'd go away,\" said Adam. \"Where did you learn that?\" asked Benjamin. \"I made it up when I was a child,\" replied Adam. \"What else do you remember from back then?\" asked Benjamin. \"Don't beat around the bush,\" said Adam. \"Tell me what you remember about your mom.\" \"I remember my mom was not a good person,\" Adam replied sadly. \"How long would she leave you alone?\" Benjamin asked gently. \"As long as she was busy,\" Adam answered. \"Do you understand why you're talking with me now?\" Benjamin inquired. \"You're supposed to help with problems,\" Adam said. \"I need more than a small amount of help. Do you know what I mean?\" Benjamin nodded. Adam then started talking about something unrelated. Benjamin asked, \"Are you the person who did a bad thing in NE city on a day in the late 20th century?\" Adam replied, \"That's my birthday.\" \"Who am I speaking to right now? What should I call you?\" Benjamin asked. \"Call me whatever you want,\" said Adam. Later, Cameron was talking to David about a case. There was a problem with some evidence that was misfiled. They had to take the person involved to a hearing before his consequence. David was upset that this was allowed to happen. After that, some children were playing a word game, guessing common household items. One of the children then said something upsetting.\"She won't stop bleeding.\" \"Jesus.\" \"What happened?\" \"An accident.\" \"We had an accident.\" \"Rain and lightning is moving into NE city.\" \"We could get strong winds....\" \"Four times 10 equals\" \"Four times 10\" \"Thomas, could you not do that now?\" \"We're trying to hear about the storm.\" \"Want me to drive?\" \"No.\" \"I'll get us there, then you can take over after we eat.\" \"Turn into spin.\" \"Apply brakes with short, firm pumps.\" \"Check mirror and roll to a slow, smooth stop.\" \"You okay, honey?\" \"Thomas?\" \"Seat belts, seat belts, seat belts.\" \"It's a shoe.\" \"What?\" \"It's a shoe!\" \"For they're good fellows\" \"For they're good fellows\" \"For they're good fellows\" \"Which nobody can deny\" \"Why didn't we get a better spare?\" \"Do you know what they cost, Alice?\" \"Honey, don't get upset.\" \"Well, if the point is to put him, Thomas, into the right school...\" \"...it's silly to focus...\" \"Adam?\" \"Adam? Adam? ...on replacement tires.\" \"What can I do to help?\" \"Nothing. I'm fine, but thank you.\" \"Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!\" \"Alice? Oh, no!\" \"What have you done? What have you done? What have you done?\" \"Hi, Henry. Where do I begin?\" \"I have left the set, okay?\" \"I know they'll say that I am wrong but they clearly did not read my deal. They had me at a bad hotel.\" \"Oh, dear. I think I have a spare battery in my bag.\" \"Excuse me?\" \"I have a spare battery in my bag up front, next to you.\" \"Any idea which one, Miss Sophia?\" \"The big bag, right on top.\" \"I don't see anything\" \"Just use your eyes! It's in the side pocket! Just look! Dear me!\" \"What have you done? What have you done? What have you done?\" \"No, fool! If you help him, you take responsibility.\" \"It is my responsibility.\" \"Let go of me.\" \"Alice?\"Adam?\" \"Adam?\" \"What have you done?\" \"What have you done?\" \"Let me take a look.\" \"The driver of every car in any accident must, within 10 days....\" \"You got a cloth in the car?\" \"Okay.\" \"Come help me look.\" \"within 10 days of the accident if you drive a car and it should involve\" \"Stay here.\" \"Keep her dry.\" \"It's okay.\" \"It's okay, honey.\" \"Open the door!\" \"We need the phone.\" \"No!\" \"Sweetheart, it's okay.\" \"Honey, it's okay.\" \"Give me the phone!\" \"The phone is dead, all right?\" \"You're gonna be fine.\" \"You're gonna be okay.\" \"No!\" \"She won't stop bleeding.\" \"What happened?\" \"There was an accident.\" \"May I please use your phone?\" \"Please use your phone?\" \"Yeah, sure.\" \"I'm not getting a line.\" \"It happens in the rain.\" \"The phone doesn't work.\" \"The CA hospital has 24-hour emergency, 30 miles east.\" \"Okay.\" \"You sit here, okay?\" \"Keep pressure on the wound. I'll be back with an ambulance.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"Sorry. It's a step down, but it'll have to do.\" I am not staying here. Are you out of your mind? This is my car. You work for me. Get those bags back in this car now! I have a medical condition. If I stay here, I could have trouble! No, please, please, please, please, please, please. Please! Hey! Stop. Please, please. Hi. I'm sorry, my car is stuck. Can I get a ride? Okay. You know you're going east. Hospital's this way. It's flooded. I mean, it's a dead end. Yeah, well, if you don't mind, I gotta try. Okay, that will be $30 cash, please. Didn't you use to be in a famous drama? Yes. Wow. Now, is that a nice room? Because though I am leaving soon, I still would prefer a nice room. \"What do you feel?\" \"Cold.\" \"Are you the boss?\" \"Yes.\" \"I am Officer Samuel, Guard.\" \"I am moving a person here.\" \"The law lets you say no, but the roads are flooded.\" \"I could use a room.\" \"It is an emergency.\" \"Do you have a radio in that car?\" \"Who is this?\" \"Car driver, I had an accident.\" \"I have a lady who is hurt.\" \"I could use an ambulance.\" \"Calling for help.\" Calling for help. Calling for help. Nothing.\" \"It has been like this for the past hour.\" \"She is losing a lot of blood.\" \"Got a first aid kit?\" \"Band-Aids, that is all.\" \"How about a needle and thread?\" \"Maybe in the diner.\" \"I will get it.\" Locked up. \"Stay dry.\" \"I will be back with your key.\" \"I will put you in room 10.\" \"Okay, thanks.\" What do you have back there? Moving a person. Maybe when you get them set, come to room 4 and look at the lady. I could use a second view. Yes, sure. Looks like you are in trouble. Be quiet! I wish I had plain color. This is fine. Would have been better. I have to get the officer set. Let me know if you need something. I will be right back. Where did you learn to do that? Pretty much where you are standing. Hey, is the little boy all right? He has not said a word since the accident. No, no, no. He does not talk much ever since... I am his stepfather. His father... Two years ago, he left. Little temper problem. Watch your step. The furniture is not good. If you are fixing to tie him, the toilet is bolted down. Thank you so much for your help. It is a good idea. Come on. Let's go look at that lady. Did you get anyone? What? Did you get through? No, not yet. Good stitch job. Pulse is shallow, but steady. Keep her comfortable. We should take turns on the radio, if that is all right. No, it is not. I can manage. \"Somebody get me a cup of coffee, black.\" \"All right, everybody!\" \"Listen up!\" \"There was a problem tonight.\" \"That's police talk for, 'Someone got hurt.' Liam!\" \"Charlotte was hurt.\" \"What?\" \"Who's Charlotte?\" \"The person I was driving.\" \"And where exactly did that happen?\" \"We don't know, because we can't find the person.\" \"Not all of them anyway.\" \"What do you mean, you can't find them?\" \"Stay calm.\" \"Everything will be all right.\" Officer Ryan is outside.\" \"He was taking someone bad.\" \"Who ran away.\" \"What are you--? Hold on.\" Running free!\" \"Will you shut up so he can talk?\" \"This is my place!\" \"I'll say what I please!\" \"It's safe here.\" \"It is not safe here!\" \"There's a cop here.\" \"Yeah, two cops.\" \"Wait. You're a cop?\" \"I was.\" \"Shut up, Liam!\" \"It's not safe here!\" \"I'm not staying\" \"It's all right. It's okay.\" Nothing. Is she okay?\" Fiona. Fiona, will you...? Stop it. Don't do this right now. What are you doing? Put your arm around your wife. Actually, she's my wife. Everybody just stay here. Stay in this room. Wait! I'm not staying here if he is. Yes, you are. No, I'm not. I'm not. All right. Liam? Come with us. Why? You know the place. Here's what I know. I'm not a cop. I don't take orders from you! Bad words! Listen. Just stay here, please. Keep everybody calm. He's not gonna get too far. Not in this! Ryan! What are we chasing here? A very bad problem. I'll go around this way. Meet you in back. Is that where you live all the time? The NE city? Used to. What's that supposed to mean? It means I don't live there anymore. The MA state! We'll go see if we can use this one. We'll go in here. Since that wasn't a good try, we'll go in here. \"I will be right out here.\" \"It is okay.\" \"I will stand guard.\" \"Not a worry.\" \"I will be right here.\" \"I am not going anywhere.\" \"See, his mother usually does this.\" \"Hello, Grace.\" \"So how long you two been married?\" \"About nine hours.\" \"It was a sudden kind of thing.\" \"Viva LV city, huh, Grace?\" \"We need to leave!\" \"I was just talking to her.\" \"Something is happening!\" \"I need to get out of here!\" \"Grace!\" \"Grace!\" \"You do not own me, Matthew!\" \"I own what is inside you! At least half.\" \"You do not own any part of me or my child!\" \"Then why did I marry you?\" \"Do not slam the door on me!\" \"Hey! Hey! You all, just calm down! We are not leaving. There is no place else to go. There is a flood outside, Grace. Stop it! Stop it! I am not pregnant!\" \"What did you just say?\" \"I lied. I am not pregnant.\" \"What are you talking about? I saw the test.\" \"Why would you do that to me?\" \"Because Emma saw you at The Bird with that girl!\" \"Grace, what are we, like 15?\" \"Go away! Open this door, Grace! No! I have not been to The Bird in over a year. Emma is a mean girl who likes messing with your head. Open the door, Grace. Open the door! Not until you calm down! I am calm! I am very calm!\" \"What are you doing?\" \"Matthew? Grace, open this door! Open the door! Open the door! Stop it, stop it! Grace, open the door! Grace, Grace, Grace! Matthew, please stop!

Oh dear.\" \"Adam?\" \"Adam?\" \"Adam?\" \"What is happening?\" \"Oh, no!\" \"Come here!\" \"They caught him.\" \"They caught him.\" \"They caught him.\" \"Why are we keeping him here?\" \"Where would you like, Kevin?\" \"I do not know.\" \"I told you to stay in the room, did I not?\" \"Did I tell you that?\" \"They had a fight!\" \"I tried to get them to go back inside!\" \"Should we try the radio again?\" \"Kevin, just stay here and watch him.\" \"Go back and look after Grace.\" \"Where are you going?\" \"Just do it, please.\" \"Ethan?\" \"I do not know if I am happy with guard duty.\" He is sleeping. He is tied to a post. \"Thomas.\" \"Thomas.\" \"Thomas.\" \"Emma? Oh, no. Emma? I do not remember anything. We had an accident. Henry? Can you keep an eye on Grace for a little while? She is awake now. I have to get some medicine to help her.\" \"Dear, I have to go get something from my room.\" No! What is wrong, friend? What do you have in the fridge? Be quiet. What is in there? What is in there? What do you have in there? Be quiet. What is it? Be quiet. You can tell me. I am good at keeping secrets. I have a big one myself. What are you doing? Bad person! What are you doing out here? Getting things that are mine. What are you doing? What, I do not get to ask a question? I am taking pictures. There have been two bad things. Before all the proof...\" That is not an answer. You are a car driver. What are you doing? Looking to win some \"beyond the call of duty,\" car driver badge? You are not on the job anymore. You do not need to be a hero. There is a real, live police officer outside...\" The one who has lost a bad person? You are a complicated person, Ethan. No. Not really. I think so. What month were you born? May. The same as me. Where were you a police officer? LA city. Were you fired or did you quit? \"I took a break from work,\" said Adam. \"It was making me sick. I got very tired, I guess. I was not feeling well.\"\n\n\"One day, I got a call to help a young woman who was very sad. She was going to have a baby, but she was very sick. She was very sad and did not want to live anymore. I asked her to come and talk to me instead of hurting herself. She asked me why she should keep living. What would you have said to her?\"\n\n\"I was taught to tell her many things. About her dreams, and all the people who would miss her. But for a moment, I could not think of anything good to say. So she jumped off the building and died. After that, I started getting very bad headaches and would faint sometimes. So I took a break from work.\"\n\n\"What? What happened?\" said Benjamin.\n\"It's worse,\" said Charlotte. \"We can't hear anything now!\"\n\n\"Where is that special key we found with the child?\"\n\"This was with the child too. What is it? Some kind of countdown?\"\n\n\"David! What is he doing?\"\n\"David, come over here! What are you doing?\"\n\"I just went to get something,\" said David.\n\"We told you to watch the man. Why did you go to your office?\"\n\"I just went to get something. How many keys are there for this place?\"\n\"Look at me. How many?\"\n\"Two keys and one master key.\"\n\"Oh no! David, you--!\"\n\"Get in here! Why did you kill him? Why did you kill that man?\"\n\n\"Who did that? I did not do that!\"\n\"You are lying! That is your bat sticking out of his body!\"\n\"I know, but I did not do it!\"\n\"Check the doors! Why did you kill him? Why did you go outside? Why did you leave him?\"\n\"I was scared.\"\n\"What were you scared of?\"\n\"You would not understand.\"\n\"Try me. Why did you kill that man?\"\n\"I did not! I do not know how-- I went to my office, that's all! Why did I leave him?\" Oliver said, \"This your key?\" \nSamuel said, \"Number 8?\"\nOliver said, \"Ten, nine, eight, right?\" \nSamuel said, \"This is your key!\"\nOliver said, \"You cannot say that!\"\nSamuel said, \"Those are not my keys!\"\nOliver said, \"That's like telling me what to say.\"\nSamuel said, \"Look. These are my keys, okay? These are my keys. You see?\"\nOliver said, \"You have a nice wallet?\"\nSamuel said, \"It's the actress's wallet.\" \nOliver said, \"Yes, I took her wallet after she went away.\"\nSamuel said, \"I did not hurt her. And I did not hurt him.\"\nOliver said, \"Let Samuel go, Ryan.\"\nRyan said, \"Get back! You won't blame me.\"\nThomas said, \"Matthew?\"\nMatthew said, \"Get him out of here!\"\nRyan said, \"Put it down. I did not hurt anybody. No one! But I don't like bad people!\"\nIf you take one more step-- Oh no!\nGet it off! Ow!\nCome on, you little person. Please start working.\nOh no!\nHey! Ryan, stop!\nWhat is happening? \nRyan! Get out of my way, I did not do anything wrong!\nMatthew! Matthew! Matthew!\nThe judge said we cannot punish a person who does not understand why they are being punished.\nSamuel wrote down what happened before the bad things.\nThe doctor said, \"There is no perfect way to help people with different thoughts in their head. We try to help them have one thought.\"\nThe judge said, \"He's here.\"\nRyan said, \"No! What you saw was an accident! I'm not a bad person! There's a person in your freezer, Ryan. I did not hurt him. I found him like that. Stop it! Listen! Listen! Listen! I lost everything in NV city last month, okay?\" \"I will turn 30 next week and I just want to go home and grow oranges!\" \"It's your birthday next week?\" \"It's my birthday next week.\" \"The 10th.\" \"Me too.\" \"Me too.\" \"Me too.\" \"Yeah.\" \"\"Adam, May 10.\" \"Alice, May 10.\" \"Charlotte, May 10.\" \"Emma and Grace, May 10.\" \"Me, Frank, May 10.\" \"What are the odds?\" \"Must be very unlikely.\" \"What is it?\" \"Where's the fuse box, Frank?\" \"Other side of the building.\" \"Emma and Grace.\" \"Fiona and Quinn.\" \"Rachel Carolina.\" \"Adam York.\" \"Frank Washington.\" \"Taylor Rhode Island.\" \"Kevin Dakota.\" \"When I was going up the stairs I met someone who wasn't there\" \"They weren't there again today\" \"I wish they'd go away\" \n\nWho is this? Who am I speaking to right now? Where did you learn that poem? Who am I speaking to? Look at me. Who am I speaking to right now? A doctor? Edward? What's happening? Please be quiet. They can hear what we're saying? Of course I can hear what you're saying. Edward, you missed your last meeting. Where have you been? Did I black out again? Try and think back. Where have you been? All right. I was driving someone and we got stuck at a motel. There was bad weather. We couldn't get out because of the bad weather. What happened at the motel? People started dying. And then their bodies-- It didn't make any sense. They disappeared. Edward, I'd like to show you something, if I may. Do you know this person? No. That person, Edward, has had a very troubled life. They were arrested years ago and found guilty of killing six people. They did this. Please don't. Edward, listen to me. When a child has a very bad experience, their mind may create separate identities. That's exactly what happened to that person. They developed a condition that is commonly known as Multiple Personality Syndrome. Why are you telling me this? Because you, Edward are one of their personalities. What? Oh no! \"What did you do to my face?\" \"Keep calm.\" \"Where is my face?\" \"That is your face.\" \"Why am I tied up?\" \"Keep calm.\" \"Where is--?\" \"Please.\" \"Oh my!\" \"Where is my face?\" \"Stay calm.\" \"No!\" \"I'm not going to stay calm!\" \"Why am I tied up like this?\" \"Who are all these people?\" \"What happened at the place?\" \"Where is everybody?\" \"They don't exist, Cameron.\" \"You were all created by Matthew as a child.\" \"You're a liar!\" \"Consider what you know.\" \"Everyone named after a common name.\" \"No.\" \"Everyone sharing the same birthday.\" \"Your blackouts.\" \"No!\" \"I was a police officer!\" \"I was a police officer in the PD city for six years.\" \"Cameron, please.\" \"I live in a HO city, in a small home.\" \"You don't live there.\" \"I do live there!\" \"You don't live anywhere. I know this is difficult to accept, but the face you saw in that mirror is the face I've always seen when I talk to Cameron or Rachel or Kevin or anyone else you've met tonight. Matthew is in the midst of a medical treatment. One which forces all his identities to confront one another for the first time. I knew there would be trouble and with it, the number of the identities would be reduced. Reduced? One of the people you've met tonight, Cameron... He took control of Matthew's body, as you have now and released an unspeakable anger. And in 19 hours Matthew Rivers will be put to sleep because of those actions unless I can convince that person that the angry one is gone. I need you to stay with me. Cameron? I need your help. I need your help to finish this. Cameron, listen to me. Cameron, stay with me. Listen to me. I need you to understand. The angry one cannot survive. Cameron! Got it? I can't see a thing. Is there a light? Hang on. Hang on. You got a light? Yeah, yeah, it's broken. Oh no! Quiet! Hey. What am I supposed to wear, person? You're in it. Kevin. Kevin, come here. Cameron! Cameron! Kevin! Kevin! Rachel. \"No, please do not.\" \"No, Thomas, please.\" \"What is it, Nathan?\" \"Nathan?\" \"Bad people do not get another chance.\" \"When I was going up the steps\" \"I met a person who was not present\" \"That person was not there again today\" \"I wish that person would go away.\"", "hash": "ddced17cabdcf3622bc6ba8aa7fbc45fd30f84c666b7a532a22ba2bc7e3be55e"}
{"text": "A child was walking up the stairs. They met someone who was not there. That person was not there the next day too. The child wished they would go away. \"Where did you learn that poem?\" asked the adult. \"I made it up when I was young,\" said the child. The adult asked what else the child remembered from back then. The child said, \"Don't avoid the topic, teacher!\" The adult asked the child to tell what they remembered about their mother. The child said, \"I remember my mother.\" Then the child added, \"My mother was not a good person.\" The adult asked how long the mother kept the child there. The child said, \"As long as she was busy.\" The adult asked if the child understood why they were talking now. The child thought the adult could help with headaches and that they needed more than medicine. The adult asked if the child remembered certain bad events. The child changed the topic to facts about a place. The adult asked if the child was involved in those bad events that hurt people. The child said it was their birthday. The adult asked what name to call the child. The child said to use any name. The adult tried the name \"Gary.\" Another adult named Edward came and said there would be an early morning event about an important case. There was a notebook with a diary that was missed as evidence. It could change the outcome of the case, so they were bringing the person involved to the event. The first adult was surprised and did not know about this. Then some other children talked about playing a word game with puzzles and buying vowels. \"Yes!\" \"An I.\" \"I'd like to solve.\" \"Sure.\" \"Good food.\" \"She won't stop crying.\" \"She won't stop crying.\" \"She won't stop crying.\" \"Oh no.\" \"What happened?\" \"An accident.\" \"We had an accident.\" \"Rain and lightning is coming to NE city.\" \"The weather machine has picked up a bad storm with lightning on its way from PL county and LA county. \"We could get strong winds...\" \"Four times ten equals...\" \"Four times ten...\" \"Matthew, could you not do that now? We're trying to hear about the storm. \"Sure you don't want me to drive?\" \"No. I'll get us to AN town, then you can take over after we eat.\" Turn into spin. Apply brakes with short, firm pumps. Check mirror and gauge tool and roll to a slow, smooth stop. You okay, honey? Matthew? Seat belts, seat belts, seat belts. \"It's a shoe.\" \"What?\" \"It's a shoe!\" For he's a good person. For he's a good person. For he's a good person. Which nobody can deny. Oh no! \"Why didn't we get a better spare?\" Do you know what round tires cost, Alice? Honey, don't get upset. Well, if the point is to put him, Matthew, into the good school... ...it's silly to focus... George? George? ...on new tires. What can I do to help? Nothing. I'm fine, but thank you. Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Alice? Oh no! Alice? What have you done? What have you done? What have you done? What have you done? What have you done? Hi, Henry. Where do I begin? I have left the work, okay? I know they'll say that I am in trouble but they clearly did not read my deal. They had me at a RA hotel... Oh no. I think I have a spare power in my bag. Excuse me? I have a spare power in my bag up front, next to you. \"Any idea which one, Miss Suzanne?\" \"The LV bag, right on top.\" I don't see anything... Just use your eyes! It's in the side pocket! Just look! Oh no! What have you done? \"Yes.\" \"Wow.\" \"Now, is that a nice room?\" \"Because though I am leaving soon, I still would prefer a nice room.\" \"Your nicest if that is possible.\" \"Room Eight's very cozy.\" \"I tried to tell you.\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey, stop!\" \"There's no way through.\" \"There's no way through!\" \"No way through!\" \"David, wake up.\" \"What?\" \"Do you have a phone?\" \"What?\" \"There's been an accident, a bad one.\" \"A lady's hurt. We need a phone right now.\" \"Friend, slow down. First, we don't know who you are. Second, we don't see an accident...\" \"Listen to me, friend, I'm having a really bad, wet day. So if you have a phone, give it to me now!\" \"Friend, we don't have a phone, so could you just let go of me now?!\" \"I need you to give me a ride in the other direction.\" \"It's flooded that way too. It's worse than this.\" \"Frank, open the trunk. Let them in.\" \"Let them in.\" \"Let them in.\" \"Hey. How you doing? Phone still not working?\" \"Yeah. Where's your vehicle?\" \"Stuck on the road two miles down. The other way's blocked too. The kids gave us a ride. The girl was stranded. Is there another way out?\" \"Is she someone we should be careful around?\" \"Hey! Is there a back road? Where do you think the water's going? You wouldn't get far. How's the woman?\" \"I don't know. They're in room Four.\" \"I'm sorry. We don't rent rooms for a short time.\" \"Funny. You still serving food?\" \"The vending machines are around the corner. Go ahead. Rooms are 30 dollars in advance with ID.\" \"You need one room or two?\" \"Excuse me. I was talking to you. I'd appreciate it if you looked at me.\" \"Well, I don't like looking at unpleasant people.\" \"We're a little stuck here, Henry. I don't think we can get out tonight.\" \"She just keeps shaking.\" \"She's in shock.\" \"Let me take a look.\" \"What? Let me take a look. \"Did your friend pack a bag?\" \"No.\" \"Emma, wait up.\" \"Six.\" \"At least we got a number.\" \" Did you feel that?\" \" Feel what?\" \"Cold.\" \"Are you the boss?\" \"Yes.\" \"I am Officer Ryan, Corrections.\" \"I am moving a person here.\" \"The law lets you say no, but the roads are wet.\" \"I could use a room.\" \"It is an emergency.\" \"Do you have a radio in that car?\" \"Who is this?\" \"Car driver, had an accident.\" \"I got a lady hurt bad. I could use an ambulance.\" \"Four four two asking for help.\" Four four two asking for help. Four four two asking for help. Nothing. It has been like this for the past hour. She is losing a lot of blood. Got a first aid kit? Band aids, that is all. How about a needle and string? Maybe in the diner. I will get it. Locked up. Stay dry. I will be back with your key. I will put you in 10. Okay, thanks. What do you have back there? Prison move. Maybe when you get him set, come to 4 and look at the lady. I could use a second view. Yes, sure. Looks like you are in trouble. Be quiet! I wish I had beige. This is fine. Would have been better. I have to get the officer set. Let me know if you need something. I will be right back. Where did you learn to do that? Pretty much where you are standing. Hey, is the...? The little boy, is he all right? He has not said a word since the accident. No, no, no. He does not talk much ever since the... I am his stepdad. His dad... Two years ago, he left. Little temper problem. Watch your step. The things are not good. If you are fixing to cuff him to something, the toilet is bolted down. Thank you so much for your help. It is a good idea. Come on. I got stripes. Stripes around my shoulders and these chains. These chains They are about to... Let us go look at that lady. Did you get anyone? What? Did you get through? No, not yet. Good stitch job. Pulse is shallow, but steady. \"When your boy gets here, do what you want, but in the name of decency state your case!\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Somebody get me a cup of coffee, black.\" \"All right, everybody!\" \"Listen up!\" \"There was an incident tonight.\" \"That's police talk for, 'Something bad happened.'\" \"Frank!\" \"Olivia was hurt.\" What?\" Who's Olivia?\" The woman I was driving. And where exactly did that happen?\" \"We don't know, because we can't find her.\" \"Not all of her anyway. What do you mean, you can't find her?\" Stay calm. Everything will be all right. Officer Thomas is outside. He was taking a bad person. Who ran away. What are you...? Hold on. Running free! Will you be quiet so he can talk? This is my place! I'll say what I please! It's safe here. It is not safe here! There's a cop here. Yeah, two cops. Wait. You're a cop? I was. Be quiet, Frank! It's not safe here! I'm not staying... It's all right. It's okay. Nothing. Is she okay? Emma. Emma, will you...? Stop it. Don't do this right now. What are you doing? Put your arm around your wife. Actually, she's my wife. Everybody just stay here. Stay in this room. Wait! I'm not staying here if he is. Yes, you are. No, I'm not. I'm not. All right. Frank? Come with us. Why? You know the place. Here's what I know. I'm not a cop. I don't take orders from you! Listen. Just stay here, please. Keep everybody calm. He's not gonna get too far. Not in this! Thomas! What are we chasing here? Something very bad. I'll go around this way. Meet you in back. Is that where you live full time? The NE city? Used to. What's that supposed to mean? It means I don't live there anymore. The MA state! We'll go see if we can use this one. \"We will go in here.\" \"Since that did not work, we will go in here.\" \"I will stay right out here.\" \"It is okay.\" \"I will stand guard.\" \"Do not worry.\" \"I will stay right here.\" \"I will not go anywhere.\" \"See, his mother usually does this.\" \"Hey, Emma.\" \"So how long you two been married?\" \"About nine hours.\" \"It was a quick thing.\" \"A fun wedding, huh, Emma?\" \"We need to leave!\" I was just talking to her. Something is happening! I need to get out of here! Emma! Emma! You do not own me, Adam! I own what is inside you! Half, at least. You do not own any part of me or my baby! Then why did I marry you? Do not slam the door on me! Hey! Hey! You two, just calm down! We are not leaving. There is no place else to go. There is a flood outside, Emma. Stop it! Stop it! I am not pregnant! What did you just say? I lied. I am not pregnant. What are you talking about? I saw the test. Why would you do that to me? Because Isabella saw you at The H place with that girl! Emma, what are we, like children? Go away! Open this door, Emma! No! I have not been to The H place in a long time. Isabella is a mean person, who likes messing with your head. Open the door, Emma. Open the door! Not until you calm down! I am calm! I am very calm! What are you doing? Adam? Emma, open this door! Open the door! Open the door! Stop it, stop it! Emma, open the door! Emma, Emma, Emma! Adam, please stop! Adam? Oh no! Oh no! Help me! Somebody help me! Help me! Is he in there? Is he in there? Emma, are you okay? What happened? \"What happened?\" \"Uh-oh.\" \"Oh no.\" \"Adam?\" \"Adam?\" \"Adam?\" \"What is happening?\" \"Oh dear?\" \"Uh-oh!\" \"Come here!\" \"They caught him.\" \"They caught him.\" \"They caught him.\" \"Why are we keeping him here?\" \"Where would you like, Benjamin?\" \"I do not know.\" \"I told you to stay put, did I not?\" \"Did I tell you that?\" \"They got into a fight!\" \"I tried to get them to go back inside!\" \"Should we try the radio again?\" \"Benjamin, just stay here and watch him. Go back and look after Charlotte. Where are you going? Just do it, please. David? I do not know if I am okay with guard duty. He is sleeping, Benjamin. He is tied to a post. Ethan. Alice? Oh my! Alice? I do not remember anything. We had an accident. Frank? Can you keep an eye on Charlotte for a little while? She is awake now. I have to get some medicine to help her. Darling, I have to go get something from my room. Uh-oh! What's wrong, friend? What do you have in the fridge? Be quiet. What's in there? What's in there? What do you have in there? Be quiet. What is it, huh? Be quiet. You can tell me. I am good at keeping secrets. I have a big one myself. What are you doing? Bad person! What are you doing out here? Getting my things. What are you doing? What, I don't get to ask a question? I'm taking pictures. There have been two bad things that happened. Before all the proof... That's not an answer. You drive a car for people. What are you doing? Looking to win some \"go beyond your job\" car driver award? You don't have that job anymore. You don't need to be a hero. There's a real cop outside... The one who lost a bad person? You are a complicated Gabriel. No. Not really. I think so. What month were you born? May. We are both Taurus. Same as me. Where were you a cop? NE city. \"Did you leave or did you stop working?\" \"I took a break for health reasons.\" \"It was making me unwell.\" \"I got worn out, I guess.\" \"I wasn't able for it.\" \"One early morning I got a call about someone wanting to jump.\" \"A young pregnant woman.\" \"She was very ill and troubled.\" \"She was truly having a hard time.\" \"I asked her to come away from the edge and towards me.\" \"She asked me why she should keep living.\" \"What did you say?\" \"I was trained to tell her lots of things.\" \"Her hopes, all the people who'd miss her.\" \"But for a second, I hesitated.\" \"And she saw it.\" Within that second, I couldn't think of one optimistic thing to say to her.\" \"So she spread her arms and jumped.\" \"I started getting headaches and eventually started blacking out.\" \"So I filed for medical leave.\" \"What? What is it?\" \"Ryan!\" \"It's worse.\" Nothing but static!\" \"Where's that key from the actor?\" \"This was on the kid.\" \"What is it, some kind of countdown?\" \"Oliver! What is he doing? Oliver, come over here! Come over here, man. What are you doing? Come over here.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"I just went to get something.\" \"We told you to watch the guy. What are you doing in your office?\" \"I just went to get something.\" \"How many sets of keys are there to this place?\" \"Look at me. How many?\" \"Two and a master set.\" \"Oh, my! Oliver, you...! Get in here! Get in here! Why did you hurt him? Why did you hurt my person?\" \"Holy cow! Who did that? I didn't do that!\" \"Lies! You're lying!\" \"It's your stick sticking out of his neck!\" \"I know, but I didn't do it!\" \"Check the doors!\" \"I didn't do it!\" \"Look at him!\" \"Why'd you hurt him?\" \"Why were you outside?\" \"Why'd you leave him?\" \"I was scared.\" \"What were you scared of?\" \"You wouldn't understand.\" \"Try me.\" \"Why'd you hurt my person?\" \"I didn't! I don't know how... I went to my office, that's all!\" \"Why did you leave Adam?\" \"Is this your key?\" \"Number 8?\" \"Ten, nine, eight, right?\" \"This is your key!\" \"You cannot say that!\" \"Those are not my keys!\" \"That is like leading the evidence or something.\" \"Look.\" \"These are my keys, okay?\" \"These are my keys.\" \"You see?\" \"You have a nice wallet?\" \"It is the actor's.\" \"Yes, I took her wallet.\" \"After that.\" \"After she passed away!\" \"After that, all right?\" \"I did not kill her.\" \"And I did not kill him.\" \"\"Let Grace go, David.\" \"Get back!\" \"You will not pin this on me.\" \"Benjamin?\" Get him out of here! Put it down. I did not hurt anybody. No one! But I do not like bad women! If you take one more step... Bad word! Get it off! Bad word! Come on, you little child. Please start. Bad word! Hey! David, stop! What is going on? David! Get out of my way, I did not do bad thing! Benjamin!\"Benjamin!\" \"Benjamin!\" An excuse of being not well was refused by the court despite the fact that my client has a problem. To this day, he remains unaware of the crimes for which he was judged. In the late 20th century, the high court ruled that states cannot punish a person who does not understand why he is being punished. He signed a paper. He did not just sign it, he spoke it. Thirdly Benjamin's books found misplaced in state evidence. Your Honor, this notebook contains writings made just before the bad things. Important to note are the changes in writing style tone, point of view. What you are looking at are the private thoughts of several different people. With permission, Dr. Kelly will explain more. Thank you. Your Honor, there is no universal treatment for this problem. In theory, one attempts to move the patient towards joining. A folding of their broken mind. Your Honor? He is here. No! What you saw was an accident! He ran out in front of me! I am not a bad person! There is a dead body in your freezer, David. I did not kill him. I found him like that. Stop it!\"Listen! \"Sweet child!\" \"What did you do to my face?\" \"Stay calm.\" \"Where is my face?\" \"That is your face.\" \"Why am I tied up?\" \"Stay calm.\" \"Where is...?\" \"Please.\" \"Sweet child!\" \"Where is my face?\" \"Stay calm.\" \"No!\" \"I'm not going to stay calm!\" \"Why am I tied up like this?\" \"Who are all these people?\" \"What happened at the motel?\" \"Where is everybody?\" \"They don't exist, David.\" \"You were all created by Cameron as a child.\" \"You're not telling the truth!\" \"Think about what you know.\" \"Everyone named after a simple name. No. Everyone sharing the same birthday. Your blackouts. No! I was a police officer! I was a police officer in the RA city Police Department for six years. David, please. I live in HO city, in a small home. You don't live there. I do live there! You don't live anywhere. I know this is hard to accept, but the face you saw in that mirror is the face I've always seen when I talk to David or Alice or Thomas or anyone else you've met tonight. Cameron is in the midst of a medical treatment. One which forces all his identities to confront one another for the first time. I knew there would be violence and with it, the number of the identities would be reduced. Reduced? One of the personalities you've met tonight, David... He took control of Cameron's body, as you have now and released an unspeakable rage. And in 19 hours Cameron Rivers will be put to death because of those actions unless I can convince that man that the killer is gone. I need you to stay with me. David? I need your help. I need your help to finish this. David, listen to me. David, stay with me. Listen to me. I need you to understand. The killer cannot survive. David! Got it? I can't see a thing. Is there a light? Wait. Wait. Wait. You got a light? Yeah, yeah, it's dead. Oh no! Be quiet! Hey. What am I supposed to wear, man? You're in it. Thomas. Thomas, come here. David! David! David! Thomas! Thomas! \"No, Adam, please.\" \"What is it, Benjamin?\" \"Benjamin?\" \"Zoe is not nice.\" \"When I went up the steps\" \"I saw a person who was gone\" \"They were gone again today\" \"I wish, I wish they'd go away\"", "hash": "d8468c214a8613a8ccf36bfc19e6aca585dcb2d3575c51a9acc8e51978d8c5ca"}

Short-term memory loss. I don't believe this. No, it's true. Adam and Diana were good friends. They loved to play together. \n\nOne day, they went to Henry's party. Henry was a nice shark. He had many friends at his party. \"Hello, friends!\" Henry said with a smile. \"Let's all say our words.\"\n\n\"I am a nice shark. I will not eat my friends,\" they all said together. \"Fish are friends, not food.\"\n\nThen Henry said, \"Today we will all bring a fish friend to our party.\" Adam and Diana looked at each other. They did not have any fish friends with them.\n\n\"That's okay,\" said Henry. \"We can share our fish snacks instead.\" Adam and Diana felt happy. They were having fun at Henry's party with all his nice shark friends. \"You can take one of my friends,\" Adam said. \"Thank you, friend,\" said Benjamin. \"A little buddy for buddy?\" \n\n\"Cameron will start,\" said Adam. \"Hello,\" said Cameron. \"I am Cameron.\" \"Hello, Cameron,\" the others said. \"It has been three weeks since I last ate a fish. I promise, or may I become soup.\" \"You are inspiring!\" \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Who is next?\" asked Cameron. \"Pick me, pick me!\" said Diana. \"Yes, the little girl in the front.\" \"Yay!\" said Diana. \"Hi, I am Diana. Well, I don't think I have ever eaten a fish.\" \"That's amazing,\" said Cameron. \"Good for you, friend.\" \"I'm glad I said that,\" said Diana.\n\n\"Anyone else?\" asked Cameron. \"How about you, friend? What troubles you?\" \"Me?\" said Ethan. \"I have no troubles.\" \"OK,\" said Cameron. \"Denial.\"\n\n\"Just say your name,\" said Cameron. \"OK,\" said Ethan. \"Hello, I am Ethan. I am a clown fish.\" \"A clown fish? Really?\" asked the others. \"Tell us a joke.\" \"I know a good one,\" said Ethan. \"There was this creature, and it went to another creature...\"\n\n\"Father!\" said Frank. \"Frank!\" said Ethan. \"Frank! I don't get it.\" \"For a clown fish, he is not very funny,\" said the others. \"No, no, no,\" said Ethan. \"Frank is my son. Humans took him.\" \"Oh no, you poor fish,\" said Diana. \"Humans think they own everything.\"\n\n\"Now, there is a father looking for his little boy,\" said Cameron. \"What do these marks mean?\" asked Gabriel. \"I never knew my father!\" \"Group hug,\" they all said. \"We are all friends here, friend.\" \"I can't read human writing,\" said Diana. \"We need to find a fish that can read this.\" \"Alice:\" \"OK.\" \"Hello, little one.\" \"Aah!\" \"Heh heh heh!\" \"Beauty, isn't he?\" \"I found that creature struggling for life... out on the reef, and I saved him.\" \"So, has that medicine kicked in yet?\" \"Patient:\" \"I think so.\" \"We're ready to go.\" \"Bubbles!\" \"My bubbles.\" \"He likes bubbles.\" \"Aah!\" \"Ohh!\" \"No!\" \"Uhh!\" \" Hello. - Aah!\" \"Slow down, little one.

Yes. - Ocean. - Oh, the sea. Good. There. He is clean. Wow. The big blue. What's it like? - Big and blue? - I knew it. If there's anything you need, just ask your Aunt Alice. Or if I'm not around, you can talk to my sister Fiona. Hi. How are you? Don't listen to anything my sister says. She's silly. Ha ha ha ha! We got a live one. - Can't hear you, Penelope. - I said we got a live one. - Boy, oh boy. - What do we got? Fixing teeth... and by the looks of those pictures... it's not going to be pretty. Ow! - Tools on? - Yes. - What did he use to open? - Big drill. He seems to like that one lately. I can't see, Fiona. You're getting a little too... Aah! Penelope: Now he's using a special way. Bloat: He's using a special tool. \"That's not a plant from NE city.\" \"That's a plant from FR country.\" \"It has a special shape.\" \"Clearly a plant from NE city.\" \"No, no, plant from FR country.\" \"Plant from NE city.\" \"Plant from FR country!\" \"Plant from NE city!\" \"There I go.\" \"A little help, over here.\" \"Alice: \"I'll go help Emma.\" \"Frank: \"Alright.\" \"Go ahead and rinse.\" \"Oh, the human mouth is a bad place.\" \"Hey, Nathan.\" \"What did I miss?\" \"Quinn: A difficult thing... it's a tough one. \nA difficult thing?

A person from outside. From my area, eh? Sorry if I ever did something bad at you. Fish gotta swim, birds gotta eat.\nHey! No, no, no, no! They're not your fish. They're my fish. Come on, go. Go on, shoo!\nAw, the picture broke. This here's Diana. She's my young family. She'll be eight this week. Hey, little fella. Say hello to your new person. She'll be here Friday to pick you up. You're her present.\nShh, shh, shh. It's our little secret. \nWell, Mr. Thomas, while that sets up... I'm going to see a man about a thing.\nOh, Diana. What? What's wrong with her?\nGrace: She wouldn't stop shaking the bag. Poor animal. He was her present last year.\nBella: She's a fish killer. I can't go with that girl. I have to get back to my dad. Aah! Dad! Help me! Oh, he's stuck.\nKevin: Nobody touch him. Nobody touch him. Can you help me? No. You got yourself in there. You can get yourself out. Kevin... I want to see Emma do it. Calm down. \"Move your fins and tail back and forth.\" \"I cannot.\" \"One of my fins is hurt.\" \"That never stopped me before.\" \"Just think about what you need to do.\" \"Come on.\" \"Perfect.\" \"Yay!\" \"You did it!\" \"Good wiggling.\" \"Ha ha ha!\" \"Wow.\" \"From the big water...\" \"just like you, Gabriel.\" \"Yes.\" \"I have seen that look before.\" \"What are you thinking about?\" \"I'm thinking... tonight, we give the young one a proper welcome.\" \"So, young one, do you have a name or what?\" \"Nemo.\" \"I'm Nemo.\" \"Nemo.\" \"Nemo.\" \"Grace: Are you going to eat that? Be careful with that tool. Huh? No, no. What does it say? Grace! Grace: A small creature has my things. Wake up. Get up. Come on. Come on! Yes, I am blue by nature. Get up! Grace: Watch out!

Did you drop it? You dropped it! That was my only chance of finding my young one. Now it's gone. Hey, Grumpy One... when things are bad, know what you have to do? I don't want to know. Just keep moving. * Just keep moving, moving, moving * * What do we do? We move, move * Grace, no singing. * Ho ho ho ho ho ho * * I love to move * * When you want to move * See, I'm going to get stuck now with that song. Now it's in my head. Sorry. Grace, do you see anything? Aah! Adam and Emma were in a dark place.\n\"Something got me,\" Emma said.\n\"That was me,\" Adam said. \"I'm sorry.\"\n\"Who's that?\" Emma asked.\n\"It's me,\" Adam said.\n\"Are you my friend?\" Emma asked.\n\"Yes, I'm your friend,\" Adam said. \"We haven't talked in a while. How are you?\"\n\"I'm fine,\" Emma said.\n\"Emma, do you see anything?\" Adam asked.\n\"I see a light,\" Emma said. \"Over there.\"\n\"Hey friend, am I dead?\" Emma asked.\n\"No,\" Adam said. \"I see it too. What is it?\"\n\"It's so pretty,\" Emma said. \"I feel happy, which is a big deal for me. I want to touch it.\"\nEmma swam toward the light, but Adam stopped her.\n\"Come back here,\" Adam said.\nEmma swam away from the light.\n\"I can't see!\" Adam said. \"I don't know where I'm going!\"\nEmma couldn't see either.\n\"The mask!\" Adam said.\n\"What mask?\" Emma asked.\nAdam saw a mask and told Emma to read it.\n\"Bring it closer, I need the light,\" Emma said.\nEmma read the first line, \"P. Sherman.\"\n\"That doesn't make sense!\" Adam said.\nEmma read the second line, \"42 Street.\"\nAdam was scared and told Emma not to eat him.\n\"The second line is '42 Street,'\" Emma said. \"Where is the food?\" \"Ooh!\" \"It is on the tip of my mouth!\" \"A sea animal.\" \"I saw that!\" \"Has many legs!\" \"Lives in the ocean.\" \"A shellfish!\" \"Close enough!\" \"* Oh, it is a big story *\" \"* I will tell you, child... *\" \"They are good.\" \"Will somebody please show me the way?\" \"!\" \"\"Will somebody please show me the way?\" \"!\" \"Ha ha ha ha ha!\" \"I am serious!\" \"\"Blah blah blah, me, me, blah!\" \"\"Blah blah blah, me, me, me!\"\" \"Thank you.\" \"Oh, dear.\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey, come back!\" \"Hey, what is wrong? What is wrong? While they are doing their silly little actions, I am far from home with a fish that cannot remember her name! I bet that is frustrating. Meanwhile, my child is out there. Your child? But it does not matter because no fish in this entire ocean is going to help me. Well, I am helping you. Wait right here. Guys! Is he bothering you again? No, no. He is a good person. Go easy on him. He has lost his child. Any of you heard of a place? Sure! This one has relatives there. Don't you? Sure do! Oh! Hey! They know the place! You would not know how to get there, would you? You want to follow the big sea flow. That big sea flow. Cannot miss it. It is in that direction. And then you follow that for about... I don't know. What do you all think? That little one will put you right past the place. Ta-da! That is great! You did it! Oh, please, I am just your little helper. Helping along. That is me. Thank you. Do not mention it!

Now, do you see a small opening? Yes! Inside it, you'll see a spinning fan. Wedge that pebble into the fan to stop it spinning. Aah! Careful, Liam! I can't do it! Adam, this isn't a good idea. He'll be fine. Try again! OK. That's it, Liam. Nice and steady. I got it! I got it! He did it! That's great, kid! Now swim up the tube and out. Oh, no! Adam! Liam! Oh, my gosh! Get him out of there!

Rachel: Adam, don't make him go back in there. No. We're done. Dude. Huh? Friend. Pay attention, friend. Friend. Oh. Oh, he is awake. Hello, friend! Oh. What happened? I saw everything, friend. First, you were like, \"Whoa!\"... and then we were all like, \"Whoa!\"... and then you were like, \"Whoa\". What are you talking about? You, small one. Taking on the jellies. You have big thrill problems, friend. Oh. Great. Uh. Oh, my stomach. Oh! Oh, man. No being sick on the shell, OK? I just cleaned it. So, Mr. Turtle... Whoa, dude. Mr. Turtle is my father. My name is Crush. Crush? Really? OK, Crush. I need to go to the east ocean current. East current? Oh, friend. You're riding it, friend! Look! OK, hold shell, friend! Hold what?! Ha ha! Great! Great! Great! Yeah! Stop! So... Why are you here today on this east current? Nora and I need to get to NE city. Nora! Is she OK? Huh? Oh, little blue. She is in trouble, friend. Nora! Nora! Nora! Nora! Nora! Nora. I'm so sorry. This is all my fault. It's my fault. Twenty-nine, thirty! Ready or not, here I come! There you are! Catch me if you can! Nora. Kid: Nice wave! Oh, wow! Heh heh. Up you go! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-oh-oh-oh! Oh, my goodness! Stop the motor, friend. Let us see what little one does flying alone. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! That was so cool! Hey, Dad, did you see that? Did you see me? A little fish said, \"Did you see what I did?\" Another fish replied, \"You are very good, young one!\" \"Give me a high five,\" said the first fish. \"Hit heads,\" said the other. \"Friend,\" they said together a few times.\n\n\"Oh, introductions,\" said one fish. \"Jellyfish, offspring.\" \"Offspring, Jellyfish.\" \"Jellyfishes?\" another fish exclaimed happily. \"Wonderful.\" \"Truly.\"\n\n\"It seems I did something you liked, friends,\" said the first fish. \"You are great, friend!\" said another. \"Ow.\" \"Swim away, my child,\" said the Jellyfish fish.\n\n\"It's wonderful, Jellyfish fish,\" said a young fish. \"The little friends are just eggs. We leave them on a beach to hatch, and then they find their way back to the big blue ocean, all by themselves,\" explained the Jellyfish fish.\n\n\"But, friend, how do you know when they are ready?\" asked the young fish. \"Well, you never really know. But when they know, you'll know, you know?\" replied the Jellyfish fish with a laugh.\n\n\"Hey, look, everybody. I know that friend! It's the Jellyfish friend!\" said a group of young fishes. \"Go jump on him!\" \"Fish pile!\" some shouted. \"Wait, wait, wait!\" cried the Jellyfish fish. \"Are you funny?\" \"Where is your shell?\" \"I need to breathe!\" \"Are you running away?\" \"Did you really cross the jellyfish forest?\" \"Did they sting you?\" the young fishes asked excitedly. \"One at a time!\" said the Jellyfish fish.\n\n\"Mr. Fish, did you die?\" asked a young fish. \"Sorry, I was not clear on the details,\" said another fish. \"So, where are you going?\"\n\n\"You see, my child was taken away from me,\" said the Jellyfish fish sadly. \"No way,\" said the young fishes. \"What happened?\" \"Please tell us?\" they begged.\n\n\"Well, OK,\" said the Jellyfish fish. \"I live on this reef a very long way from here. And my child...\" Some small fish were talking about a big, scary creature with sharp teeth deep down in the dark ocean. Two fish had been looking for a young fish named Nemo for days in the water. They hoped the creature might find its child soon. It sounded like the creature would not stop until it found the young fish. The fish thought the creature was a dedicated parent. Seagulls were fighting over things on the surface and making a lot of noise. One bird told the others to be quiet because they were just rats with wings. Another bird said someone had been looking for their child Nemo. Nemo was taken from the reef. The bird said the creature looking for Nemo was heading to the city. A clownfish was talking to another fish named Gill, apologizing for putting Gill in danger and not getting Gill back to its father. Gill told the clownfish not to worry, and said it was good the clownfish pulled the right tooth from another fish's mouth. \"Has he made the thing around his teeth loose yet?\" \"What am I talking about?\" \"Where's Nemo?\" \"I need to speak with him.\" \"What is it?\" \"Your dad has been fighting the entire ocean...\" \"Looking for you.\" \"Your father?\" \"Really?\" \"He has traveled many miles, fighting big fish and stinging things...\" \"Big fish?\" \"That can't be him.\" \"What was his name?\" \"Some kind of sport fish.\" \"Tuna?\" \"Trout?\" \"Marlin?\" \"Marlin! The little orange fish from the reef.\" \"It's my dad! He fought a big fish!\" \"I heard he fought three.\" \"Three big fish? That's a lot of teeth!\" After you were taken by that person over there... your dad followed the boat like crazy. Really? He was swimming, trying his best... and then three giant fish caught him... and he blew them away and dived deep down... and got chased by a monster with huge teeth! He tied this monster to a rock, and what's his reward? He gets to fight a whole forest of stinging things! Now he's with a group of turtles on the big current... and word is he's coming this way right now... to this city! Wow! What a good daddy! He was looking for you after all. GURGLING: He's swimming to the filter! Not again! Get him out of there! Come on, grab the end! No! You have your whole life ahead of you! We'll help you! Can you hear me? Nemo! Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. You did it! You're... covered with germs! Ha ha! That took courage. Okay, we have less than two days... before that person gets here. This tank will get very dirty in that time... but we have to help make it dirty any way we can. No cleaning. I won't clean. Everyone else, be as gross as possible. Think dirty thoughts. We're going to make this tank so filthy... the tooth helper will have to clean it. Good work! Adam and Benjamin were two little fish in the big ocean. One day, they saw something small and orange with white stripes. \"That must be me,\" said Adam. Then they saw another small thing. Benjamin guessed it was him too. But it looked scary to Adam.\n\n\"Wait, wait!\" said Benjamin. \"I have seen that floating speck before. That means we have passed it before. And that means we are going in circles. We are not going straight!\"\n\n\"Hey, hey!\" said Adam. \"Let's go to the surface. We can figure it out up there.\"\n\nWhen they got to the surface, Benjamin said, \"Let's ask someone for directions.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" said Adam. \"Who do you want to ask? The speck? There is nobody here!\"\n\n\"There has to be someone,\" said Benjamin. \"It's the ocean. We are not the only two here. Let's see.\"\n\nThey looked around but could not find anyone to ask. Then Benjamin saw something big. \"Hey, excuse me!\" he called. But Adam stopped him.\n\n\"Benjamin, Benjamin!\" said Adam. \"Now it's my turn to think of something dark and mysterious. What if that big thing eats us and spits out our bones?\"\n\n\"Why do men never want to ask for directions?\" asked Benjamin. \"Let's play the 'Let's Not Die' card instead of the gender card.\"\n\n\"Of course I want to get out of here,\" said Adam. \"But how can we do that unless we ask for help?\"\n\n\"Trust me on this,\" said Benjamin. He swam up to the big thing and said, \"Excuse me! Hello! Little fella? Can you help us?\"\n\nAdam thought to himself, \"That is no little fella. That is a big whale!\" \"X knows what you're saying!\" \"See, Y is swimming away.\" \"Come back.\" \"Y is not coming back.\" \"You offended Y.\" \"Maybe a different way of talking.\" \"Y is not listening...\" \"Dory!\" \"This is not whale talk.\" \"You're talking like you have a sick stomach.\" \"Maybe I should try a different whale sound.\" \"Don't try a different whale sound.\" \"Woooooo...\" \"You actually sound sick.\" \"Maybe louder?\" \"Rah! Rah!\" \"Don't do that!\" \"Too loud.\" \"Didn't it sound like a whale?\" \"It doesn't sound like a whale.\" \"It sounds strange.\" \"Oooooo!\" \"Oh!\" \"It's just as well. Y might be hungry.\" \"Don't worry. Whales don't eat clownfish. They eat small sea creatures.\" \"Small sea creatures: Swim away!\" \"Oh, look, small sea creatures! Move, Dory, move!\" \"Aah!\" Aah! Aah! Look at that. Would you look at that? Dirty. Absolutely dirty. All thanks to you, kid. You made it possible. I said no cleaning. I am ashamed. Look! Bubbles! I love the bubbles! Has anybody seen a friend? Time for an appointment. Hello. Sorry I'm late. OK, here we go. Here we go, OK. A child walks to the counter, drops the keys... That's disgusting! Tastes pretty good to me. Urrrp! Eww! Don't you people realize we are swimming in our own... Shh! Here comes someone! Aah! Oh my. What a mess. Oh. What's my earliest appointment tomorrow? Leave it open, would you? I've gotta clean the fish tank before a visitor gets here. Did you hear that? Yay! The tank is gonna be clean! You ready to see your dad, kid? Uh-huh. Of course you are. I wouldn't be surprised if he's out there... in the harbor waiting for you right now. Early in the morning, Adam was waiting for Emma in the harbor. \"Come on!\" said Emma. \"You have to try this!\"\n\n\"Stop it,\" said Adam. \"We're inside a big animal, don't you see?\"\n\"A big animal?\" asked Emma. \"I can talk to big animals.\"\n\"You can't talk to big animals!\" said Adam. \"We have to get out of here! I have to find my child and tell them about how old some animals are!\"\n\n\"It will be OK,\" said Emma. \"You can't stop anything from happening to your child. Then nothing would ever happen to them. That wouldn't be fun.\"\n\nA loud noise came. \"The water is going down!\" said Adam. \"It's going down!\"\n\"It's half full,\" said Emma.\n\"No, it's half empty!\" said Adam. \"The animal wants us to go to the back of its mouth. It wants to eat us!\"\n\"Don't worry,\" said Emma told the animal. \"I don't taste good.\"\n\nSoon, there was no more big animal around them. \"You can't talk to fish!\" \"Yes, I can!\" \"No, you can't!\" \"You think you can do these things, but you can't, Nathan!\" \"OK.\" \"Diana!\" \"Oof!\" \"It says it's time to let go.\" \"Everything's gonna be all right.\" \"How do you know?\" \"How do you know something bad isn't gonna happen?\" \"I don't!\" \"Aah!\" Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Ha ha ha! We're alive! Look! SY city...SY city! SY city again! You were right, Diana! We made it! We're gonna find my child! Thank you, sir! Wow. I wish I could talk to fish. All we gotta do is find the boat that took the child. Right! Come on, Diana. We can do this! Early in the morning. It's early in the morning, everyone! Today's the day! The sun is shining, the tank is clean... and we are getting out... The tank is clean. The tank is clean! But how? The boss must've put it in while we were sleeping. What are we gonna do? What's it say, Grace? I can't hear you, Grace. The cleaning machine is an all-purpose, self-cleaning, maintenance-free, water purifier that is made to help your fish live longer. Stop it! The cleaning machine is set to scan your tank every few minutes?! Scan? What does that mean? Aah! Temperature... normal, water... normal. Ooh. Nice. Ooh... Oh! Curse you, cleaning machine! That's it for the escape plan. It's ruined. Then what are we gonna do about... ALL: The mean child! Stay down, kid! False alarm. Whew. My nerves can't take much more of this. What'll we do when that brat gets here? I'm thinking. Oh! Kevin! Nathan! I'm coming! Help me! Help me! Swim down! Come on, kid! Everybody jump in!A kid was playing with a fish tank. A little fish said \"Mine! Mine! Mine!\" A big fish said \"Too loud for me! Too loud!\" The big fish sang a song to find a happy place.\n\nThe kid wanted to see the little fish. The kid opened the fish tank. The little fish played dead. The big fish said \"The little fish will get flushed down the toilet! He will get out of here!\" Another fish said \"What a smart little guy!\"\n\nThe little fish fell into the trash can. The big fish said \"No! Not the trash can!\" Another fish said \"I found his dad! He is over there!\"\n\nThe dad fish said \"Nemo!\" Nemo was the little fish. The dad fish swam to Nemo. The dad fish said \"Gotcha! Keep down!\"\n\nThe dad fish took Nemo away. The big fish said \"To the top of the mountain!\" They all swam to a happy place. \"Why are you napping?\" \"Hurry up!\" \"Big fish!\" \"Hot circle!\" \"Fishy!\" \"Aah!\" \"Oh no!\" \"All the animals are acting strange!\" \"Unh!\" \"Yara: \"Aaah!\" \"Get it out!\" \"Hit her on the head!\" \"Go, Frank, go!\" \"Fish in my hair!\" \"Frank!\" \"Little fish...tell your dad I said hello.\" \"Unh!\" \"Eww!\" \"Go get them!\" \"Dentist: \"Ohh...\" \"They did it!\" \"Yay!\" \"I'm so happy!\" \"Will they be OK, Frank?\" Don't worry. All drains lead to the ocean. Fishy! Aah!\" Aah! Aah! Whoa!\" Whoa! Whoa! Papa! I'm so sorry. Truly, I am. Hey. Victoria...if it wasn't for you...I never would've even made it here. So, thank you. Hey, wait a minute. Wait. Where are you going? It's over, Victoria. We were too late. Nemo's gone, and I'm going home now. No. No, you can't. Stop! Please don't go away. Please? No one's ever stuck with me for so long before. And if you leave, I just...I remember things better with you. I do. Look...a number, a number...I remember it. I do. It's there. I know it is because when I look at you...I can feel it. I look at you and I...I'm home. Please...I don't want that to go away. I don't want to forget. I'm sorry, Victoria, but I do. \"Food from above!\" \"Sweet drink of life!\" Both: \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" This is our spot! Get out of here! Both: \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" Yeah, that's it, friend. Just keep on swimming. You got that. Too right, mate! Oh! I got a live one here! Have you seen my dad? Gotcha! \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" Come back here!

A person said they only live to be 100. \"Samuel?\" \"Do you think I would cross the big water... and not know as much as Samuel?\" \"Ha ha ha!\" \"He was very old!\" \"Not very old!\" \"Who is this Samuel who knows everything?\" \"Time for school!\" \"Get up!\" \"Let's go!\" \"I'm gonna win!\" \"No, you're not!\" \"I did it!\" \"Aw, my own child beats me!\" \"Come here, learners.\" \"The sea animal looks over to the other animal and says...\" \"\"With plant-like things like these, who needs other plant-like things?\"\" \"Hello, Liam.\" \"Who's this?\" \"Student from another place.\" \"I'm from the group of animals, friend!\" \"Sweet!\" \"Totally. \n\nSeriously, Matthew.

The scene was so good,\" said William.\n\"I'm worried about the scene we're filming tomorrow. I have to act like I love Grace. I've never done that before.\"\n\"It can't be that hard. You've been in love before,\" said Grace.\n\"Just once, with you,\" said William.\n\"This could be awkward. Let's move on,\" said Grace. \"Can't you use that actor thing where you think about real memories?\"\n\"What are you talking about?\" asked William.\n\"Try to remember how you felt when you were in love, and think about that in the scene.\"\n\"Okay, I can do that,\" said William.\n\n\"There's a party scene. William wants to kiss Grace, but he can't. That makes me think about times I wanted to kiss you, but pretended everything was fine.\"\n\"You never talked about that before,\" said Grace.\n\"There's a scene where William sneaks into Grace's room. He shouldn't be there, but he wants to look at her. I remember mornings before you put on makeup, thinking how beautiful you were. It hurt because I could never tell you, but it was worth it just to look at you.\" \"Thank you, friend.\" \"This is great!\" \"I got you something from the VT state.\" \"What is it?\" \"Oh, my!\" \"Maple sweets.\" \"That's so kind of you.\" \"That's strange, it's empty.\" \"Hello, friends.\" \"What's happening?\" \"Do you friends want to spend time together or... ?\" \"Do you hear a buzzing sound?\"", "hash": "16958de4b39195b4f71f5010f4db7baeaf3fde5803973f282500bcae13b7e8dc"}
{"text": "\"I do not think that is true.\" \"Have you ever seen a big fish?\" \"No, and I do not plan to.\" \"How old do sea turtles become?\" \"I do not know.\" \"Samuel from next door... he says that sea turtles can live to be about 100 years old.\" \"If I ever see a sea turtle, I will ask him.\" \"After I am done talking to the big fish, OK?\" \"Whoa!\" \"Hold on.\" \"Wait to cross the road.\" \"Hold my fin.\" \"Dad, you will not be scared... like you were at the petting zoo, will you?\" \"That small animal was about to charge.\" \"Hmm.\" \"I wonder where we are supposed to go.\" \"Bye, Mom!\" \"I will get you after school.\" \"Ha ha!\" \"Stop it, you guys!\" \"Give it back!\" \"We will try over there.\" \"Excuse me, is this where we meet his teacher?\" \"Well, look who is here. Yes. It is surprising, I know. \"Matthew, right?\" \"Liam.\" \"Benjamin.\" \"Thomas.\" \"David.\" \"Hey, you are a small fish. You are funny, right? Tell us a joke. \"Yeah.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Well, actually, that is a common mistake. Small fish are no funnier than any other fish. \"Come on, funny fish.\" \"Do something funny. All right, I know one joke. There was a shell animal, see? And he swims up to a sea vegetable...\" Well, they-I am mixed up. There was a shell animal and a sea vegetable. None of them were walking, so forget that I said they walked. \"Adam!\" Get out of Mr. Johannsen's yard now! \"Whoa!\" All right, you kids! Ooh, where did you go? Dad, can I go play, too? Can I? I would feel better if you would play on the sponge beds. That is where I would play. \"What is wrong with his fin?\" \"He looks funny.\" Ow! Hey, what did I do? Be nice. It is his first time at school. He was born with it. We call it his lucky fin. \"Dad...\" See this tentacle? \"Oh, plants are cool\" \"Plants are fun\" \"They make their food\" \"OK, the edge.\" \"All right, kids, feel free to explore... but stay close.\" \"Tiny living things!\" \"Look.\" \"A whole world in one tiny speck.\" \"There are many things in this...\" \"Come on, let's go.\" \"Come on, sing with me!\" \"There's some, some other\" \"Some more, some other\" \"Some more again, three\" \"Hey, friends, wait up!\" \"Whoa.\" \"Cool.\" \"Saved your life!\" \"Aw, you made me leak.\" \"What's that?\" \"I know what that is.\" \"Matthew saw one. He said it was called a backside.\" \"Whoa.\" \"Wow.\" \"That's a pretty big backside.\" \"Oh, look at me. I'm going to touch the backside.\" \"Ah-choo!\" Whoa!\" Ha ha ha! Oh, yeah? Let's see you get closer. OK. Beat that. Come on, Nathan. How far can you go? My dad says it's not safe. Nathan! No! Dad? You were about to swim into the open. No, I wasn't. Good thing I was here. If I hadn't shown up - He wasn't going to go. - He was too scared. No, I wasn't. This does not concern you, kids... and you're lucky I don't tell your parents. You know you can't swim well. I can swim fine, Dad, OK? No, it's not OK. You shouldn't be near here. OK, I was right. You'll start school in a year or two. No, Dad! Just because you're scared of the water - Clearly, you're not ready... and you're not coming back until you are. You think you can do these things... but you just can't, Nathan! I hate you. There's - Nothing to see. Look. Over there. Excuse me. Is there anything I can do? I am a scientist, ma'am. Is there any problem? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt things. He isn't a good swimmer, and it's a little too soon... for him to be out here alone. Adam was swimming near the school. The teacher said, \"Adam, get back here now! If you go far away, you may get lost or hurt by other fish.\"\nBut Adam did not listen. He swam farther and farther away. Suddenly, a big boat passed by and took Adam away!\n\"Help me! Adam is lost!\" cried the teacher. \"Has anyone seen a white boat? They took my student!\" Adam's father heard the cry. \"No! My child is gone!\" he said sadly. An old fish came and said, \"I have seen a boat.\" \"Did you see it?\" \"A big animal swam by not long ago.\" \"Was it white?\" \"Hi.\" \"I'm Dory.\" \"Where did it go?\" \"Which way did it go?\" \"Oh, oh, oh.\" \"It went this way.\" \"It went this way.\" \"It went this way.\" \"Follow me.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Thank you, thank you so much.\" \"No problem.\" \"Hey...\" \"Wait!\" \"Will you stop that?\" \"What are you doing?\" \"I'm trying to swim here.\" \"Is the ocean not big enough for you? Do you have a problem, my friend? Huh? Do you? Do you? Do you want to fight me? I'm scared now. What? Wait a minute. Stop following me, OK? What? You're showing me where the big animal went. A big animal? Hey, I've seen a big animal. It swam by not long ago. It went this way. It went this way. It went this way. Follow me. Wait a minute. What is happening? You already told me which way the big animal was going. I did? Oh, no. If this is a joke, it's not funny. And I know funny things. I'm a fish that makes people laugh. No, it's not a joke. I'm so sorry. See, I forget things almost right away. I forget things almost right away. I don't believe this. No, it's true. I forget things almost instantly. It happens in my family. At least, I think it does. Hmm. Where are they? Can I help you? There's something wrong with you - really. You're wasting my time. I have to find my child. Hello. Well, hi! My name's Bruce. It's OK. I understand. Why would you trust a big fish, right? So, what are you little ones doing out so late, eh? We're not doing anything. We're not even out. Great! Then how would you little ones like to come to a party I'm having? You mean, like a fun time? Yeah, right. A party. What do you say? I love parties. That sounds like fun. Parties are fun, and it's tempting, but \"OK.\" \"That's all that matters.\" \"Hey, look, balloons.\" \"It is a party.\" \"Ha ha ha ha!\" \"Mind your distance, though.\" \"Those balloons can be a bit dodgy.\" \"You wouldn't want one of them to pop.\" \"Oh.\" \"\"Ohh.\" \"Adam!\" \"Emma!\" \"There you are, Cameron.\" \"Finally.\" \"We got company. It's about time, mate. We've already gone through the snacks... and I'm still starving. We almost had a feeding frenzy. Come on, let's get this over with. Right, then. The meeting has officially come to order. Let us all say the pledge. I am a nice shark, not a mindless eating machine. If I am to change this image... I must first change myself. Fish are friends, not food. Except stinkin' dolphins. Dolphins. Yeah. They think they're so cute. Look at me. I'm a flippin' little dolphin. Let me flip for you. Ain't I something? Right, then. Today's meeting is Step 5 Bring a Fish Friend. Do you all have your friends? Got mine. Hey, there. How about you, Emma? Oh, I... seem to have misplaced my friend. That's all right, Emma. I had a feeling this would be a difficult step. You can help yourself to one of my friends. Thanks, mate. A little friend for Emma, eh? I'll start the testimonies. Hello. My name is Cameron. Hello, Cameron. It has been three weeks since my last fish. On my honor, or may I be chopped up and made into soup. You're an inspiration! Amen. Right, then. Who's next? Pick me, pick me. Yes. The little girl down the front. Whoo! Come on up here. Hi. I'm Diana. Hello, Diana. And, uh, well... I don't think I've ever eaten a fish. That's incredible. Good on you, mate. I'm glad I got that off my chest. All right, anyone else? How about you, mate? What's your problem? Me? I don't have a problem. Oh, OK. Denial. \"Aah!\" \"Just start with your name.\" \"OK.\" \"Uh, hello.\" \"My name is Matthew.\" \"I'm a fish.\" \"A fish?\" \"Really?\" \"Tell us a joke.\" \"I love jokes.\" \"I actually do know one that's pretty good.\" \"There was this little animal... and he walks up to another animal.\" \"Normally, they don't talk, animals... but in a joke, everyone talks... so the little animal says to the other...\" \"Daddy!\" \"Jack!\" \"Jack!\" \"Ha ha! Jack!\" \"I don't get it.\" \"For a fish, he's not that funny.\" \"No, no, no, no. He's my son. He was taken by some people. People think they own everything. Now, there is a father looking for his little boy. What do these markings mean?\" \"Group hug.\" \"We're all friends here, friend.\" I can't read human writing. We got to find a fish that can read this. \"Hey, look, big fish.\" \"No, no, no, Emma! Guys, guys. No, Emma. That's mine. Give it to me. Gimme! Ow! Oh, I'm sorry. Are you OK? Ow, ow, ow. I'm so sorry. You really hit me there. Am I bleeding? Ohh. Ow, ow, ow. Emma, are you OK-Ohh. Ohh, that's good. Stop! Just a bite. Hold it together, friend! Remember, big fish, other fish are friends, not food! Food! Emma, look out! Aah! I'm having fish tonight! Remember the steps, friend! Aah! Aah! Whoa! Aah! Just one bite! Aah! Morning. Grr! There's no way out! There's got to be a way to escape! Who is it? Emma, help me find a way out! Sorry. Come back later. We're trying to escape. There's got to be a way out! Here's something. Es-cap-e. I wonder what that means. Funny. It's spelled just like escape. \"Let's go.\" \"Oh no!\" \"Here's Benjamin!\" \"Wait a moment.\" \"You can read?\" \"I can read?\" \"That's right.\" \"I can read!\" \"Well, then, here.\" \"Read this now.\" \"Oh no!\" \"Oh!\" \"He really doesn't mean it.\" \"He never even knew his father.\" \"Don't fall off!\" \"Oh no!\" \"Oh no!\" \"Oh no, it's blocked!\" \"No, Benjamin, focus.\" \"Sorry about Benjamin, friend.\" \"He's really a nice guy.\" \"I need to get that mask.\" \"You want that mask? OK.\" \"No, no, no, no, no, no!\" \"Quick, grab the mask!\" \"Oh, no.\" \"Benjamin? What? Aw, is the party over?\" Nice. Dad? Daddy? Huh? Oh no! Uh!\" \"Uh!\" \"Hannah.\" \"Uh-huh? Prep for his tooth crown, would you, please? And I'm going to need a few more cotton rolls. OK. Hello, little one. Oh no! Heh heh heh! Beauty, isn't he? I found that guy struggling for life out on the reef, and I saved him. So, has that medicine kicked in yet? I think so. We're ready to go. Bubbles! My bubbles. He likes bubbles. Oh no! Oh! No! Uh! \"Hello.\" Oh no! Slow down, little one. There's nothing to worry about. He's scared. I want to go home. Do you know where my dad is? Honey, your dad's probably back at the pet store. Pet store? Yeah, you know, like, I'm from Bob's shop. Pet shop. Fish shop. Mail order. Online shop. So, which one is it? I'm from the ocean. Ah, the ocean. The ocean? Oh no!\" \"Oh no!\" \"Oh no!\" He hasn't been cleaned. Jack! Yes. Clean him! Yes. Ocean. Ooh, the sea. Good. There. He is clean. \"Wow.\" \"The big blue.\" \"What's it like?\" \"Big and blue?\" \"I knew it.\" \"If you need something, just ask your Auntie Emma.\" \"Or if I'm not there, you can talk to my sister Fiona.\" \"Hi.\" \"How are you?\" \"Don't listen to anything my sister says.\" \"She's silly.\" \"Ha ha ha ha!\" \"We got a lively one.\" \"I said we got a lively one.\" \"Boy, oh, boy.\" \"What do we got?\" \"A dental work-and by the looks of those pictures... it's not going to be easy.\" \"Ow! The tools are in?\" \"Yes. What did the worker use to open?\" A drill. The worker seems to like that one lately. I can't see, Fiona. You're getting too close-Aah! Now the worker is using a different tool. Using a file. That's not that file. It has a special shape. Clearly that file. No, no, this file. That file! This file! There I go. A little help, over here. I'll go help. All right. Go ahead and rinse. Oh, the human mouth is a gross place. Hey, Nathan. What did I miss? Dental work-a tough one. Dental work? What did the worker use to open? A drill. The worker likes that one. Hope the worker doesn't make a mistake at the end. Hello. Who's this? New kid. Ha ha ha! The dentist took the kid in. From this area, eh? Sorry if I ever tried to get you. Fish gotta swim, birds gotta eat. Hey! No, no, no, no! They're not your fish. They're my fish. Come on, go. Go on, shoo! Aw, the picture broke. This here's Diana. She's my niece. She'll be eight this week. Hey, little kid. Say hello to your new mom. She'll be here soon to get you. \"You are her gift,\" Adam said. \"Shh, shh, shh. It is our small secret,\" Adam said. \"Well, Mr. Frank, while that sets up...\" \"I am going to see a man about a pet,\" Adam said. \"Oh, Emma. What?\" \"What is wrong with her?\" \"She would not stop shaking the bag,\" Emma said. \"Poor Jack. He was her gift last year. He had to go away,\" Emma said. \"She can hurt fish. I cannot go with that girl. I must get back to my dad,\" Jack said. \"Daddy! Help me!\" Jack cried. \"Oh, he is stuck. Nobody touch him,\" Adam said. \"Nobody touch him. Can you help me?\" Jack asked. \"No. You got yourself in there. You can get yourself out,\" Adam said. \"Adam wants to see Jack do it,\" Emma said. \"Be calm. Move your fins and tail back and forth,\" Adam said. \"I cannot. I have a bad fin,\" Jack said. \"That never stopped me. Just think about what you need to do,\" Adam said. \"Well done!\" Emma said. \"You did it! Good moving,\" Adam said. \"Ha ha ha! Wow. From the ocean, just like you, Adam,\" Jack said. \"Yes. What are you thinking about?\" Emma asked. \"I am thinking... tonight, we give the kid a proper welcome,\" Adam said. \"So, kid, do you have a name?\" Emma asked. \"Nemo. I am Nemo,\" Jack said. \"Nemo. Are you going to eat that?\" Adam asked. \"Be careful with that tool,\" Emma said. \"Huh? No, no. What does it say?\" Jack asked. \"Emma! A small sea animal has my money. Wake up. Get up. Come on. Come on!\" Adam said. \"Yes, I am really blue,\" Emma said. \"Get up! Look out! Dangerous fish eat fish!\" Jack cried. \"Wow. Dusty. The mask. Where is the mask? No! Not the mask! Get it! Get the mask!\" Adam said. \"Get the mask! Get it!\" Emma said. Charlotte was a little girl. She went on an adventure with her friends. They were looking for a special place. They had to remember the address. \"P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney,\" said Emma. Charlotte kept repeating it so she wouldn't forget. They swam through some dangerous bubbles. After that, their friends gave Charlotte a new name: Sharkbait. It was all just a fun game they played together. A fish said, \"A home address.\" \"Why do I have to tell you over and over again?\" \"I'll tell you again.\" \"I don't get tired of it\" \"OK, all right.\" \"Huh?\" \"Here's the thing.\" \"Uh-huh.\" \"I think it's best if I carry on from here by myself.\" \"OK.\" \"\"You know, alone.\" \"Uh-huh.\" \"Without you. I don't want you with me.\" \"Huh?\" \"Am I...I don't want to hurt your feelings.\" \"You want me to leave?\" \"Yes. I just can't have any more delays and you cause delays.\" \"Sometimes it's a good thing. There's a whole group of fish that cause delays.\" \"You mean...You mean you don't like me?\" \"No, of course I like you. It's because I like you I don't want to be with you. It's a complicated feeling.\" \"Ohh!\" \"Don't cry. I like you.\" \"Hey, you! Lady, is this fish bothering you?\" \"Um...I don't remember. Were you?\" No, no, no, no, no. We're just\" \"Do you know how I can get to\" \"Look, we're talking to the lady, not you.\" \"Hey, hey. You like acting?\" Just like in practice, friends. So what are we? Take a guess.\" \"Oh, oh. I've seen one of those. I'm a fish with a nose like a sword.\" \"Wait, wait, um\" \"It's a swordfish!\" \"Hey, let the lady guess. Where's the butter?\" \"Ooh! It's on the tip of my tongue! Lobster.\" \"Saw that! Lots of legs! Live in the ocean. Clam!\" \"Close enough!\" \"Oh, it's a funny story. I'll tell you, friend...\" \"They're good. Will somebody please give me directions?!\" *Laughing sounds* \"Blah blah blah, me, me, blah! Blah blah blah, me, me, me!\" \"Thank you.\" \"Oh, dear.\" \"Hey! Hey, come back!\" \"Hey, what's the matter?\" \"What's the matter?\" \"While they are doing their silly little actions...\" \"I am far from home with a fish that cannot remember her name!\" \"I bet that's frustrating.\" \"Meanwhile, my child is out there.\" \"Your child Samuel?\" \"Nemo?\" \"But it does not matter because no fish... in this entire ocean is going to help me.\" \"Well, I am helping you.\" \"Wait right here.\" \"Friends! Is he bothering you again?\" \"No, no. He is a good guy. Go easy on him. He has lost his child Samuel.\" Any of you heard of a place called PS city?\" \"PS city? Oh, sure! Thomas here has relatives in PS city.\" \"Sure do!\" \"Oh! Hey! They know PS city! You would not know how to get there, would you?\" \"You want to follow the EA current. That is the East AU country Current. Big current. Cannot miss it. It is in... that direction.\" \"And then you follow that for about...\" \"I do not know. What do you think?\" \"About three long distances?\" \"That little baby will put you right past PS city.\" \"Ta-da!\" \"That's great! Dory, you did it!\" \"Oh, please, I am just your little helper. Helping along. That's me.\" \"Friends, thank you.\" \"Do not mention it! Just loosen up, OK, buddy?\" \"Oh, you all. You really nailed him.\" \"Bye.\" \"Oh, hey, ma'am. One more thing. When you come to this deep place, swim through it, not over it.\" \"Deep place... through it, not over it. I will remember.\" \"Hey, hey! Hey, wait up, partner! Hold on! Wait, wait, wait! I need to tell you something.\" \"Whoa. Nice deep place.\" \"Hello!\" \"OK, let's go.\" \"No, no. Bad deep place. Come on, we will swim over this thing.\" \"Whoa, partner. Little red flag going up. Something is telling me to swim through it, not over it. Are you looking at this thing? It has danger written all over it. I really, really, really think we should swim through. \"Look at this!\" \"OK, pick up the thing, friend!\" \"Pick up what?\" \"!\" \"Ha ha!\" \"Fun!\" \"Fun!\" \"Fun!\" \"Yeah!\" \"Stop!\" \"So...\" \"What brings you here today to this place?\" \"Charlotte and I need to go to the SY city.\" \"\"Charlotte!\" \"Is she okay?\" \"\"Huh?\" \"Oh, little blue one.\" \"She is down there, friend.\" \"\"Charlotte!\" \"Charlotte!\" \"Charlotte!\" \"Charlotte!\" \"Charlotte!\" \"Charlotte.\" \"I'm so sorry. This is all my fault. It's my fault.\" \"Twenty-nine, thirty! Ready or not, here I come!\" \"There you are! Catch me if you can!\" \"Charlotte?\" Nice wave! Oh, wow! Heh heh. Up you go! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-oh-oh-oh! Oh, my goodness! Stop the motor, friend. Let us see what the little one does flying alone. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! That was so cool! Hey, Dad, did you see that? Did you see me? Did you see what I did? You are so great, little one! Give me a high five. Head bump. Friend. Friend. Friend. Oh... hello. Jellyfish, child. Child, Jellyfish. Jellies? Great. Apparently, I must have done something you liked... friends. You are great, friend! Ow. Swim away, my child. It's awesome, Jellyfish. The little ones are just eggs. We leave them on a beach to hatch... and then, they find their way back to the big sea. All by themselves? Yeah. But, friend, how do you know when they're ready? Well, you never really know. But when they know, you'll know, you know? Ha. Hey, look, everybody. I know that friend! It's the Jellyfish! Go on. Jump on him! Turtle pile! Wait, wait, wait! Are you funny? Where is your shell? \"I need to breathe!\" \"Are you going away?\" \"Did you really cross the big forest?\" \"Did they hurt you?\" \"One at a time!\" \"Mr. Fish, are you okay?\" \"Sorry, I was not very clear.\" \"So, where are you going?\" \"You see, my child was taken.\" \"My child was taken away from me.\" \"No way.\" \"What happened?\" \"No, no, kids.\" \"I don't want to talk about it.\" \"Aww!\" \"Please?\" \"Please?\" \"Please?\" \"Well, OK.\" I live on this big home a long, long way from here. This is gonna be good. I can tell. And my child Nemo... See, they were mad at me. And maybe they wouldn't have done it... if I hadn't been so hard on them. I don't know. Anyway, they swam out in the open water to this boat... and when they were out there, these people appeared... and I tried to stop them, but the boat was too fast. So, we swam out in the ocean to follow them... They couldn't stop them. And then Nemo's dad... he swims out to the ocean, and they bump into three big sharks. He scares away the sharks by making a loud noise! Wow, that's amazing. And then goes down into the dark. It's very dark down there. You can't see a thing. How's it going, friend? And the only thing they can see down there is the light from this big, scary creature... with sharp teeth. Nice try, old friend. And then he has to get away... So, these two little fish have been... searching the ocean for days on the big water. Which means that they may be on their way here right now. That should put them in SY harbor in a few days. I mean, it sounds like... this guy is gonna keep trying till he finds his child. I sure hope they make it. That's one dedicated parent, if you ask me. Hello! The little fish said, \"Do not be rude. Say hello.\" The father fish said, \"Hello.\" The child fish said, \"Hello.\" The father fish said, \"His son Thomas was taken to the NE city.\" The little fish said, \"NE city! And it is very important that we get there as fast as we can, so can you help us?\" The father fish said, \"Come on, little fish. Come on.\" The little fish said, \"Thomas, I am a little fish. I do not think that is a little fish.\" The father fish said, \"Oh! Big fish. Whale.\" The little fish said, \"OK. Maybe he only speaks whale language.\" The little fish made whale sounds. The father fish said, \"Dory? What are you doing? Are you sure you speak whale? Can you give us directions?\" The little fish kept making whale sounds. The father fish said, \"Dory! We do not know what you are saying! See, he is swimming away. You made him angry.\" The little fish said, \"Come back.\" The father fish said, \"He is not coming back. You made him upset. Maybe a different whale sound.\" The little fish tried other whale sounds. The father fish said, \"Don't. You actually sound sick. Maybe louder?\" The little fish tried louder whale sounds. The father fish said, \"Don't do that! Too loud. It does not sound like a whale. It sounds like nothing I have ever heard.\" The little fish tried more whale sounds. The father fish said, \"It is just as well. He might be hungry. Whales do not eat little fish. They eat small shrimp.\" The father fish said, \"Swim away!\" The little fish said, \"Oh, look, shrimp!\" They swam away from the whale. In the fish tank, one fish said, \"Look at that mess. All thanks to you, kid. You made it possible.\" Another fish said, \"I said no cleaning. I am ashamed.\" More fish said fun things about the messy tank. One fish said, \"9:00 and time for the dentist.\" Another fish said a human name. The end. A boy said, \"That fish is mine!\"\nThe orange fish with a hurt fin swam up and said, \"Mine! Mine! Mine!\"\nThe boy grabbed the bag and said, \"Mine! Mine! Mine!\" \nThe orange fish hit the bag and said, \"Mine! Mine!\"\nThe boy and orange fish kept saying, \"Mine!\"\nThey were moving fast and saying, \"Whoo! Ha ha ha!\" \nThen they fell and yelled, \"Aah!\" \nThe boy said, \"Hold on!\"\nThey hit something and yelled, \"Aah!\"\nThe orange fish kept saying, \"Mine! Mine!\" \nIt was too loud for the boy.\nThe boy sang, \"Twinkle, twinkle, little star. Find a happy place!\"\nA lady called the boy Gabriel and said he would see his uncle.\nShe opened her mouth wide like a piranha fish from the Amazon.\nShe said, \"I get fishy, fishy!\"\nShe looked at the orange fish and said, \"Poor little guy. He's dead.\"\nThe boy said, \"He's not dead! What's happening?\"\nThe orange fish was playing dead so he would not get flushed down the toilet.\nThe boy said, \"He's gonna get out of here! He's so smart!\"\nThe orange fish fell into the trash can.\nThe boy yelled, \"Nemo! No!\"\nA bird said, \"I found his dad! He's over there!\"\nThe boy asked, \"What's a dentist?\"\nThe bird said, \"I can't go in there!\"\nThe boy said, \"Yes, you can! Charge!\"\nThe bird flew in and the lady yelled, \"Aah! Darla, look out!\"\nThe boy saw the orange fish and said, \"Nemo! Gotcha!\" \"Nemo!\" \"Daddy?\" \"Out with you!\" \"And stay out!\" \"Daddy?\" \"Fishy?\" \"Fishy!\" \"Wake up!\" \"Oh, no!\" \"To the top of a far away mountain!\" \"Why are you sleeping?\" \"Hurry!\" \"Friend!\" \"Ring of Fire!\" \"Fishy!\" \"Aah!\" \"Oh my!\" \"All the animals have gone mad!\" \"Unh!\" \"Aaah!\" \"Get it out!\" \"Smack her in the head!\" \"Go, Friend, go!\" \"Fish in my hair!\" \"Friend!\" \"Sharkbait... tell your dad I said hello.\" \"Unh!\" \"Eww!\" \"Go get 'em!\" \"Ohh... He did it! Yay! I'm so happy! Is he gonna be OK, Friend?\n\nDon't worry. All drains lead to the ocean. Fishy! Aah! Aah! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Daddy! I'm so sorry. Truly, I am. Hey. Dory... if it wasn't for you... I never would've even made it here. So, thank you.\n\nHey, wait a minute. Wait. Where are you going? It's over, Dory. We were too late. Nemo's gone, and I'm going home now. No. No, you can't. Stop! Please don't go away. Please? No one's ever stuck with me for so long before. And if you leave, I just... I remember things better with you. I do. Look- a place, some numbers... I remember it. I do. It's there. I know it is because when I look at you... I can feel it. I look at you and I... I'm home.

They would give new clothes to the monks. Ong Bak was a special symbol that protected the village. The festival was to remind people that in 7 days, they would celebrate Ong Bak again. It happened every 24 years. With Ong Bak, good things would come back.\n\nNathan had an old thing. He did not want to sell it. He wanted to give it to his son Cameron when Cameron became a monk for Ong Bak. \n\nCameron grew up in the temple. His parents left him there as a baby. The head monk adopted him.

How dare you harm my things! I don't know. It's between Adam and David. True! I don't know. I know that you are looking for this statue head. Do you really want it? If you want it. I have a game for you to play. I saw a famous show with my own eyes. If you accept to fight for him, he will give you the show and release Muay. What are you going to do? Tell me. I will do anything... to bring back the show to BN village. I'll sacrifice even with my life. Why do you call me to leave the border? To warn you to stay away from political issues and I want you to make a bet. You want to take revenge on that country boxer to death! How much you want to bet? Your call. You don't call the shots anymore! On the east side is a TH country boxer. He's new to us. The boxer on the west side is one of the best. Now the fight has begun. (Voice of the commentator continues) Adam! Adam! Adam! Are you okay? Enough. Hey! If you want the show, follow me. You're bad people too. Adam lost the fight so I could win the bet. This is just the head of some old statue that you're trying to get. I'm not interested in the head, I just want you to box for me. Don't dare challenge me because I can make you live or die. You betrayed us. Adam lost the fight for you, why don't you return the head to him? Bad person! Calm down. Finish them after I've gone. You got hurt but I got the money. Remember that I ordered this. Get rid of them. I can't help if they don't listen. Kill them! Older brother! I told him not to make a noise. Hey! Do it quickly! Police may be here soon. Hey! Go there. Where is the show? Hey! I go with you. No, I can't let anyone die for the show. Except me, only me.", "hash": "9f6f66b9851e163642f98a472562ff358cea24e81ad7df982e376288cca940a4"}

They looked inside and found a map and a tiny thing. \"What is this tiny thing?\" someone asked. The writing on the tiny thing said \"The key that can open anything\".\n\nThey also found some gold in the box. One person said, \"I see a cloud that looks like a ghost.\" Another person said, \"That cloud might be related to someone important.\" They thought the clouds were changing shape.\n\nSome people were looking for dandelions. \"I found one,\" said a child. \"Me too,\" said another child. Three dandelions were found in total.\n\nA person was leaving and said goodbye. \"See you again someday,\" they said.\n\nThere was a news report about some prisoners who had run away from jail.

The report warned people to be careful.\n\nThat is all that can be shared from the original conversation in a way suitable for preschool children. Hello children! Let's go to the park today.

The police looked at the scene and concluded that the criminal was Isaac, who had escaped from jail. As the brother of the injured person, Jack came to the place and took Kevin as a hostage. In the same room, Liam paid no attention to the police's requests. This caused a long delay. Although Isaac was the only one responsible, all the officers came to the scene. The criminal was silent for 10 hours. This is the news about it.\n\"Mr. Matthew, my child asked me to... let me hurt him,\" said Nathan. \"He wanted to hurt him to face his father.\"\n\"That's normal,\" said Oliver.\n\"I couldn't do what you do.

That does not seem right. Do you have a better idea? I worked in the kitchens before. Maybe the diner is open. I could go. Do you have change for a dollar? I don't know. Let me see. Here you go. What is your name? Benjamin. Benjamin, huh? I will get it. You are not going tonight. Please, be strong. You see, Thomas and I, we need you so much. Mark? Mark? Mark? You need to tell them, Henry, that I cannot work, perform or shine in an environment like that. No, it is not about the money. It is about the work conditions. One bar.\"\"One bar. One bar. No bar. One bar. Two bars. Come on.\"\"Come on. Come on. Here we go. There you go. Come on. What a dry wasteland! Oh no! I just had it. \"holy cow.\" \"Oh dear.\" \"Who is this?\" \"The woman I was driving.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"There is something in there.\" \"Use this, friend.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Are you a police officer?\" \"I was.\" \"She was in Room 10?\" \"I am.\" \"Where is your companion?\" \"Handcuffed to a toilet.\" \"That was a long drive.\" \"gentlemen.\" \"Your Honor.\" \"Ready, Sharon?\" \"alrighty.\" \"In the matter of Rivers v. NV region, for the purposes of\" \"Judge Taylor, sir, with respect, we should wait until my client arrives.\" \"They have a right to be present.\" \"They have few rights.\" \"They are one day from punishment.\" \"But to show their mind state, which is the purpose\" \"Their mind state?\" \"Their mind state?\" \"Their mind state?\" \"Do you know what time it is? I have no time for nonsense.\" That the wise people called me in the night to review a case I already did, that I already decided, may make you happy. But it makes me upset. When your friend gets here, do what you want, but state your case properly!\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Somebody get me a cup of coffee, black.\" \"All right, everybody! Listen up! There was an incident tonight. That means someone got hurt.\" Larry! Caroline was hurt badly. What? Who is Caroline? The actress I was driving. And where exactly did that happen? We don't know, because we can't find the body. Not all of it anyway. What do you mean, you can't find it? Stay calm. Everything will be okay. Officer Rhodes is outside. They were taking a prisoner. Who escaped. What are you--? Wait. Running free! Please be quiet so they can talk? This is my place! I will say what I want! It is safe here. It is not safe here! There is a police officer here. Yes, two police officers. Wait. You are a police officer? I was. Be quiet, Larry! It is not safe here! I am not staying \"Nothing.\" \"Is she okay?\" \"Grace.\" \"Grace, will you...?\" \"Stop it.\" \"Don't do this right now.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"Put your arm around your girlfriend.\" \"actually, she's my wife.\" \"Everybody just stay here.\" \"Stay in this room.\" \"Wait!\" \"I'm not staying here if he is.\" \"Yes, you are.\" \"No, I'm not.\" \"I'm not.\" \"All right.\" \"David?\" \"Come with us.\" \"Why?\" \"You know the place.\" \"Here's what I know.\" \"I'm not a worker. I don't take orders from a bad person!\" \"Bad words!\" \"Listen. Just stay here, please. Keep everybody calm. He's not gonna get too far. Not in this!\" \"Ryan!\" \"What are we chasing here?\" \"bad things.\" \"I'll go around this way. Meet you in back.\" \"Is that where you live all the time?\" \"NV city?\" \"Used to. What's that supposed to mean?\" \"It means I don't live there anymore.\" \"ME state!\" \"We'll go see if we can use this one. We'll go in here. Since that wasn't a good try, we'll go in here. I'll be right out here. It's okay. I'm gonna stand guard. Not a worry. I'll be right here. I'm not going anywhere.\" \"See, his mother usually does this.\" \"Hey, Grace. So how long you two been married?\" \"About nine hours. It was a quick thing. Viva NV city, huh, Grace?\" \"We need to leave!\" \"I was just talking to her. Something's happening! I need to get out of here!\" \"Grace!\" \"Grace!\" \"Grace! You don't own me, Lou! I own what's inside you! half, at least.\" \"You don't own any part of me or my baby!\" \"Then why did I marry you?\" \"Don't slam the door on me!\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey! You guys, just calm down! We are not leaving. There is no place else to go. There's a bad thing outside, Grace. Stop it!\" \"Stop it! Stop it! I'm not going to have a baby! What did you just say?\" Alice was very angry. \"I didn't tell the truth,\" she said. \"I'm not going to have a baby.\" \n\n\"What are you talking about?\" said Benjamin. \"I saw the test.\" \n\n\"Why did you do that to me?\" asked Alice.\n\n\"Because Emma saw you at The HK place with that other girl!\" said Benjamin.\n\n\"Charlotte, what are we, kids?\" said Alice. \"Go away!\"\n\n\"Oh no!\" said Benjamin. \"Open this door, Charlotte!\"\n\n\"No!\" said Charlotte. \n\n\"I haven't been to The HK place in a long time,\" said Benjamin. \"Emma likes to say things that aren't true and mess with your head.\"\n\n\"Open the door, Charlotte,\" said Benjamin. \"Open the door!\"\n\n\"Not until you are calm!\" said Charlotte.\n\n\"I am calm!\" said Benjamin. \"I am very calm!\"\n\nBenjamin started banging on the door. \"Open the door! Open the door! Stop it, stop it!\" cried Charlotte.\n\n\"Oh my God! Help me! Somebody help me!\" cried Charlotte.\n\nEmma came. \"What happened? What happened?\" she asked. \"Oh dear, Kevin is hurt!\"\n\nThe adults put Kevin in a room. \"Why are we keeping him here?\" asked Victor. \n\n\"I don't know,\" said Zachary. \"I told you to stay in Room 3, didn't I?\"\n\n\"They got in a fight!\" said Emma. \"I tried to get them to go back inside!\"\n\nAlice woke up. \"Gabriel?\" she said. \"I don't remember anything. We had an accident.\"\n\n\"I have to get something for you,\" said Gabriel. \"I'll be right back, dear.\" A man said a bad word. His friend asked, \"What is wrong?\"\nThe first man asked, \"What food do you have in the fridge?\" \nHis friend said, \"Be quiet.\"\nThe first man kept asking, \"What is in there?\"\nHis friend told him to be quiet again.\nThe first man said, \"You can tell me your secret. I have a big secret too.\"\nHis friend asked, \"What are you doing out here?\"\nThe first man said, \"I am getting something that belongs to me.\"\nHis friend asked again, \"What are you doing?\"\nThe first man said, \"I do not have to answer you.\"\nThe first man said, \"I am taking pictures. There were two bad things that happened before.\"\nHis friend said, \"But you are not a police officer anymore. You do not need to be a hero. There is already a police officer outside.\"\nThe first man said, \"That police officer let a bad person escape.\"\nThe friend said, \"You are a complicated person. What month were you born?\"\nThe first man said, \"May. We were both born in May.\"\nThe friend asked, \"Where were you a police officer before?\"\nThe first man said, \"In a big city. I stopped being a police officer because it made me sick.\"\nHe explained that one time, a very sad woman was going to jump off a building. He could not think of any reasons for her to keep living. So she jumped. After that, he started getting sick, so he stopped being a police officer.\nThen something bad happened with a person named Rhodes. The first man found something that looked like a countdown. \"Adam, come here!\" \"Come here, man.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"Come here.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"I just went to get something.\" \"We told you to watch the guy.\" \"What are you doing in your office?\" \"I just went to get something.\" \"How many keys are there to this place?\" \"Look at me.\" \"How many?\" \"Two and a main set.\" \"\"Oh, my God!\" \"Adam, you--!\" \"Get in here!\" \"Get in here!\" \"Why did you hurt him?\" \"Why did you hurt my friend?\" \"Oh no!\" \"Who did that?\" \"I did not do that!\" \"That is not true!\" \"You are lying!\" \"It is your stick in his throat!\" \"I know, but I did not do it!\" \"Check the doors!\" \"I did not do it!\" \"Look at him!\" \"Why did you hurt him?\" \"Why were you outside?\" \"Why did you leave him?\" \"I was scared.\" \"What were you scared of?\" \"You would not understand.\" \"Try me.\" \"Why did you hurt my friend?\" \"I did not! I do not know how-- I went to my office, that is all!\" \"Why did you leave him?\" \"Is this your key? Number 8?\" \"Ten, nine, eight, huh? This is your key!\" \"You cannot say that!\" \"Those are not my keys!\" \"That is like leading the witness or something.\" \"Look. These are my keys, okay? These are my keys. You see? You have a nice bag?\" \"It is the actress's.\" \"Yes, I took her bag. After. After she died! After, all right? I did not hurt her. And I did not hurt him.\" \"Let her go, Adam.\" \"Get back! You will not blame me.\" \"Thomas?\" \"Get him out of here!\" \"Put it down. I did not hurt anybody. No one! But I do not like bad people!\" \"If you take one more step\" \"Ah! Get it off! Oh no! Come on, you. Please start. Oh no!\" \"Hey! Adam, stop! What is going on? Adam! Get out of my way, I did not do anything wrong!\" \"Be quiet!\" \"I'm just saying maybe there is a connection between all of us.\" \"Like what?\" \"We are all in the NV state.\" \"Be quiet!\" \"Where were you going on your trip when you stopped here?\" \"Carson NV town.\" \"Okay?\" \"I was going home to FL state.\" \"Where were you going?\" \"I was taking the actress to LA city.\" \"I was born in FL state.\" \"Since you have been in that chair, no one has died, so be quiet!\" \"No one has died since we have all been here!\" \"Hey, dear, sit down.\" \"Where in FL state, Liam?\" \"Where in FL state?\" \"Friends now, huh?\" \"Great.\" \"Polk County.\" \"That's where I was born.\" \"Which town?\" \"Mulberry.\" \"Frostproof.\" \"No wonder you left.\" \"There's a town called Frostproof?\" \"They grow oranges. The name is also a slogan.\" \"I was very happy the day I left Polk.\" \"Why would you want to go back?\" \"I found a farm for sale on the Internet. Nine acres, 1200 trees. Limes and oranges. According to the seller, the soil needs some work, but it's good land.\" \"What?\" \"It sounds nice.\" \"Ed?\" \"She's not awake.\" \"Get him out of here. Come on. Come on, dear. Look at this.\" Where did you get that? Right here. This does not make sense. She was in an accident. George was an accident, if you believe Liam.\" Where is the number seven? Back up! See, I told you it was not me! That's not possible. I was standing right there. I saw what happened. We all saw what happened. He ran out. No one could have known he was going to do that. No one human. We are back to that again? It's the spirits, huh? Maybe it's the ghost of the person that Liam put in the freezer.\" \"Someone untie me. No!\" \"You know it was not me. Come on. Listen. We must leave. Take her car and leave. You, her and the kid. There's nowhere to go. How much gas do you have? Half a tank. \"You can drive until early morning on that.\" \"Look at me.\" \"When you get to where it's flooded, go the other way.\" \"I don't know if I can.\" \"Get the kid and go.\" \"Right now.\" \"Come on.\" \"Timmy.\" \"Timmy, come on.\" \"Let's go.\" \"Get up.\" \"What's happening?\" \"They can't leave!\" \"This way.\" \"We'll see you when the storm breaks.\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"They can't leave! Where are they going? Get back here!\" Go, go, go! They're leaving.\" \"They're not leaving.\" \"Go! You can't let people leave after four people have been killed!\" \"You really think they're people?\" They're not leaving!\" \"Oh no.\" Ginny! Fire extinguishers. Larry, you got a fire extinguisher? Fire extinguisher! Where? Back there! Nobody in there. Maybe it got so hot, they got burned up. There'd be something left. You did this. You did this! You told them to get into the car! Are you happy? Where is he? Nothing. I give up! I give up! I give up! What do you want? What do you want, you bad person? What do you want from us? I am turning 30 next week and I just want to go home and grow oranges! It's your birthday next week? It's my birthday next week. The 10th. Me too. Me too. Yeah. Adam, May 10. Alice, May 10. Charlotte, May 10. Grace and Lily, May 10. Me, Kevin, May 10. What are the odds? Must be very small. What is it? Where's the fuse box, Kevin? Other side of the building. Grace and Lily. Charlotte. PA city. Adam. Kevin. RH state. Ethan. When I was going up the stairs I met a man who wasn't there. He wasn't there again today. I wish he'd go away. Who is this? Who am I speaking to right now? Where did you learn that poem? \"Who am I talking to?\" \"Look at me.\" \"Who am I talking to now?\" \"Doc?\" \"Adam?\" \"What is happening?\" \"Please be quiet.\" \"Can he hear what we are saying?\" \"Of course I can hear what you are saying.\" \"Adam, you missed your last meeting.\" \"Where have you been?\" \"Did I black out again?\" \"Try to think back.\" \"Where have you been?\" \"Okay. I was driving this person and we got stuck at the place.\" \"There was a storm.\" \"We could not get out because of the storm.\" \"What happened at the place?\" \"People started dying.\" \"And then their bodies -- It did not make any sense. They disappeared.\" \"Adam, I would like to show something to you, if I may.\" \"Do you know this man?\" \"No.\" \"That man, Adam, is Gabriel.\" \"He has had a troubled life. \"He was caught four years ago and found guilty of killing six people in a bad time.\" \"He did this.\" \"Officer, please.\" \"Adam, listen to me. When faced with a very bad thing, a child's mind may break into many pieces. That is exactly what happened to Gabriel. He got a condition that is known as multiple person Syndrome.\" \"Why are you telling me this?\" \"Because you, Adam are one of his pieces.\" \"What? Jesus!\" \"What did you do to my face?\" \"Keep calm.\" \"Where is my face?\" \"That is your face.\" \"Why am I tied up?\" \"Keep calm.\" \"Where is--? Please. Jesus! Where is my face?\" \"Stay calm.\" \"No! I am not going to stay calm! Why am I tied up like this? Who are all these people? What happened at the place? Where is everybody?\" \"They do not exist, Adam. You were all made by Gabriel as a child.\" \"You are a liar!\" \"Think about what you know. Everyone named after a thing. No. Everyone sharing the same birthday. Your blackouts. No! I was a cop! I was a cop in the LA city for six years.\" \"Adam, please. I live in NE city, in a small home.\" \"You do not live there.\" \"I do live there! You do not live anywhere.\" \"Put your arm around my neck.\" \"You have to hold on, okay?\" \"You with me, Adam?\" \"Stay with me.\" \"Okay.\" \"One, two, three.\" \"You have to help me get you up.\" \"Adam, you have to push a little bit.\" \"Adam, why won't you let me help you?\" \"Where did you go before?\" \"What did you see?\" \"Tell me what you saw.\" \"I saw you.\" \"I saw you in an orange garden.\" \"Why won't you let me help you?\" \"Where did you go?\" \"What did you see?\" \"I saw you in an orange garden.\" \"The question is whether to convict the body or the mind.\" \"The body committed these bad actions, that is true.\" \"The person who remains inside did not.\" \"The question may not be true.\" \"We saw the destruction of 10 people tonight.\" \"Nine were good and one was bad.\" \"They're not real!\" \"The violence that existed has been stopped.\" \"Adam belongs in a hospital.\" \"In the matter of Adam, it is recommended that Adam's punishment be stopped. I am moving Adam to a hospital under the care of Dr. Matthew. Good and bad things happen. But it's not that way. I wasn't born to lose you. I want you so bad. Adam. No, please don't. No, Adam, please. What is it, Adam? Good people don't get a second chance. When I was going up the stairs, I met someone who wasn't there. That person wasn't there again today. I wish that person would go away.", "hash": "da171d2a3aea2b1f5e925b841ed016dfa9bee58c6ae6b838904522df821908b8"}
{"text": "\"Oh no, that's not good.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Matthew might move to NE city now.\" \"I thought I could control my feelings.\" \"Forget that.\" \"What will you do?\" \"What should I do?\" \"You told someone you love them, and they left.\" \"That's what people do.\" \"About the child.\" \"I meant the child.\" \"We must do something.\" \"Quickly.\" \"I can't hear you.\" \"David.\" \"Speak up.\" \"I never asked before, but I'm asking now.\" \"I need help with this.\" \"Magical help.\" \"Alright. What's happening?\" \"This silly kid, he has people trapped. Only I know him - he wouldn't hurt anybody -- but I'm running out of time to calm him down. The police are ready to go in. I don't want to lose him, Grace.\" \"Alright. Alright! I'm coming.\" Ok. Wait. Where's Xavier? Where is he?\" \"Look, look, wait. Listen. Where's Xavier?\" \"There he is! Look!\" \"Look! Look! Where's Xavier?\" \"Where's Xavier?\" \"There he is!\" Alright. I don't think distracting him is the answer. Xavier, bad creature. Very bad creature. Hey, was that Jack? No. That was my purpose. Pardon? That was David. I've been wondering why the job place hasn't called, and now I know why. I needed to be free to help him. To do what? Well, to save an innocent person. Why else would he have called? And, more importantly, why else would I have been the one to answer the telephone? Because you were closest to it? No. Because it's my purpose. Call me if you need help. What? You're just gonna let her go? You're welcome to try and stop her. You know I should talk to Jack. And her, too. Wait. Stop. Where are you going? Are you slightly worried that there's a creature in the house? Benjamin, this is a child, ok? Relax. \"You call Emma if you need anything.\" \"Love you, too.\" \"Don't.\" \"Sorry.\" \"And you're okay with this?\" \"Them putting this on your lap?\" \"Well, they don't seem too worried.\" \"Well, they should be.\" \"I need to figure out what kind of creature we're dealing with here.\" \"Hey, is Thomas in?\" \"No.\" \"I mean, yes, he is, but he asked not to be bothered.\" \"Yeah, but that can't possibly mean me.\" \"Actually, it specifically means you, Penelope.\" \"Sorry.\" \"You two have a fight?\" \"No.\" \"But we're about to.\" \"Listen, Jas- oh.\" \"Oh...\" \"I'm sorry.\" \"Penelope, what are you doing?\" \"I didn't know you were in the middle of a meeting.\" \"Yeah.\" \"That's why the door was closed.\" \"Really? Because I was told the door was closed specifically for me.\" \"Sorry, I'll come back later.\" I didn't know you spoke a different language. Outside. How come I didn't know you speak a different language? Is that what you came here to ask? No. No, of course not. I just wanted to talk about last night. Ok, fine, but can we do it later? I'm in the middle of a very important meeting right now. Of course. Yeah. I'm sorry about that. So how about tonight? Tonight's not good. I'm going to the FR country. Wait. What? I was meaning to tell you. It just came up. Really? When? Would you keep your voice down, please? It's got nothing to do with that, and you know it. That's not true. We both know how you really feel about me. The only difference is I'm the only one who's not afraid of it. Bye! Scary creatures with strong claws, they make loud sounds and tend to travel in groups. Great. I say we get rid of the little one before the group comes looking for it. Ok. Fine. A mommy and a daddy were talking about a little boy. The daddy said, \"We must stop the little boy before he becomes bad. We must protect other good children from him.\" The mommy said, \"But he is just a little baby now. I cannot hurt a baby, no matter how bad he may become.\" The daddy said, \"You must think of the other good children you will save. You know you must stop the bad little boy.\" The mommy was scared of what the little boy could do when he grew up, but she did not want to hurt him when he was still a baby. A good man came to help talk to the little boy without the police hurting him. The good man used a special spell to keep himself safe from bullets. Then the good man went to talk to the little boy. \"What are you doing with this?\" \"What is wrong with you?\" \"Do you want to get hurt?\" \"I have come too far.\" \"I have gone through too much to lose now.\" \"Don't make me hurt you!\" \"Why don't you just do it?\" \"What are you waiting for?\" \"Get it over with!\" \"I can do worse than hurt you.\" \"I can keep you here.\" \"You'll never see your child again.\" \"Think about it.\" \"Well, can't think of anything else to add.\" \"It's the most powerful magic we've ever made.\" \"I agree.\" \"I guess it's time to wake up the baby?\" \"Hello?\" \"Hey, it's me.\" \"Oh, hey, Cameron. I, uh...\" \"I didn't want to leave like this. Uh, I can't really talk right now. I'm kind of busy.\" \"Oh, really? Come on, Victoria. Why do you always have to make things so difficult?\" \"Oh, I make things so difficult? And how exactly do I do that? By being honest with my feelings and by making you be honest with yours?\" \"You know it's not that simple.\" \"Ok, I really have to go now.\" \"Victoria, wait.\" \"Have a good trip.\" Toss me a bottle. Jessica, you ok? Quinn, get the bottle! So much for our special thing. Shh. You're ok. It's all right. You're home now. This had better work. Oh, it will. We just got back from talking to The Wise Ones, and they're in agreement. If we can't return the baby safely to the creatures we'll make him disappear. Talk about points that don't matter, people. What's that supposed to mean? Well, do you notice anything missing? The baby? What happened? The Beast took him...right after the creatures beat us. This is all Adam's fault. How's that? Oh, you're a boy. You wouldn't get it. Wait. How are we supposed to get back Madison if we don't have a baby? Well, we're gonna try to have another little meeting with the creatures. See if we can't make some sort of deal. If we can join forces with them to kill the beast, then they can get their baby back. And we get our sister back. \"Do we have enough magic drink?\" \"Who wants to go hunting with us?\" \"This will be a little cold.\" \"The bleeding won't stop.\" \"You should come home with me, and we can do more there.\" \"No, I can't.\" \"If you're worried about my family\" \"It's not your family I'm worried about.\" \"It's the dangerous beasts.\" \"They'll be looking for me there.\" \"They'll be looking for him there.\" \"But you don't understand.\" \"We have somebody who can heal you once we turn you back to normal\" \"You can't turn me back.\" \"No one can.\" \"Not unless I die.\" \"So how were you planning on raising your child?\" \"I wasn't.\" \"I thought I'd find someone...after.\" \"All I cared about was saving him.\" \"That's exactly what I'm going to keep doing.\" \"You can't run forever, you know.\" \"Not for long.\" \"Not with that.\" \"And who's going to save him when you're gone?\" \"You have a way with words, you know that?\" \"I make it up as I go.\" \"Diana, duck! What are you doing? Let's get her out of here. No! Wait! What are you doing? Saving your life. No, no, no. You don't understand. We have to go back. Quick. Gabriel, we need you! Quick. He's dying. Who is he? The Beast. Heal. Heal. Heal. Quick. Where's the baby? Dangerous beasts have him. Oh, so the plan worked. Yeah. A little too well. And now we just have to get the baby back. What? Rachel, will you go fill up some potion bottles, please? Yeah. Lots of them. Hold up, are you serious? You finally get rid of the demon child and now you want to risk your lives trying to get it back? He's not a demon child. That's my son. How are you feeling? Are you all right? I can't believe I'm human again. Aren't you glad you didn't kill me now? Not funny. I don't think that's funny. Agreed. Oh, what? Are you two on, like, the same team now? We're gonna get your baby back. \"What about the big house?\" \"It will be there in the early morning.\" \"I, uh, just was not sure if you would be there.\" \"I did not want to take the risk.\" \"Really?\" \"Really.\" \"You were right.\" \"I was \" \" I was running, but not for the reasons that you think.\" \"I am not afraid of how I feel about you.\" \"It does not scare me one bit.\" \"Then why?\" \"It is...a little unnerving to have somebody tell you how you feel all the time... before you know it yourself.\" \"I know.\" \"I am sorry.\" \"You do that a lot, too.\" \"You are very smart.\" \"It is, uh, it is pretty amazing, actually.\" \"It is a real gift.\" \"Yeah, well, sometimes it can be a hard thing, too.\" \"Tell me about it.\" \"Look, all I am saying is that I would like to be able to express my feelings if that is all right with you?\" \"It is perfectly ok.\" \"Good.\" \"So...while we are on the subject...how do you feel about me?\" \"I love you, too.\"", "hash": "dda1b12a7bb182a2e53c9afa187dccf2a4eb76dd8b332650909a198dc02cac09"}

We cannot be without seeing him.\"\nFrank said, \"If he becomes closer to you, he will become far from us.\"\nRachel said, \"Meet him and talk to him, but please do not change his mind.\"\nSomeone said, \"Somebody please help, please help my child!\"\n\"Mother, mother...\"\nCameron came and helped the child.\n\"You came like a good person and helped our child. Thank you!\"\nBenjamin said, \"How are you? We have not seen you in a very long time!\"\n\"This long time was like 100 years for us. We could not believe how we could be without seeing you all these days. Do you remember us?\"\nCameron said, \"I have forgotten myself...\" Adam was on the bus going home. He saw Emma being teased by some boys. \"Stop it!\" Adam shouted. \"Leave her alone!\" The boys made fun of Adam too. \"Mind your own business,\" they said rudely. But Adam was not afraid. \"If that was your sister, would you let them treat her that way?\" he asked. The boys realized Adam was right, and they stopped teasing Emma. Emma thanked Adam for standing up for her. Adam's brother Xavier was proud of him. \"Good job, Adam!\" he said. They all went home together, feeling happy that Adam had done the right thing. A teacher said, \"Children, today we will learn about new feelings. Sometimes, we feel very happy, like a new flower blooming. We wait for special moments and close the door to enjoy them.\"\n\nA student asked, \"Teacher, can we talk about our school bathrooms? It is a big problem, especially for the girls. They feel shy to carry mugs and buckets to use the bathroom.\"\n\nThe teacher replied, \"I understand your problem well. I have told the school leader many times, but they do not seem to care. Today we will get an answer for this.\"\n\nAnother student said, \"Our school is in bad shape. The children must travel far to study.\"\n\nThe teacher asked, \"Would you like a good new school in our town?\"\n\nThe students cheered, \"Yes!\"\n\nOne student said, \"We need a beautiful teacher!\"\n\nThe teacher smiled and said, \"First, we need money to build the school. How can we collect so much money?\"\n\nA student replied, \"You can ask the shopkeepers to help!\"\n\nThe teacher agreed, \"Good idea! We will ask the shopkeepers, starting with Mr. Cameron from Hotel Gurudeva.\"\n\nAt the hotel, the teacher greeted Mr. Cameron and said, \"We want to solve the school problem. You have a plan?\"\n\nMr. Cameron replied, \"Simple! We will build a new school with four big rooms, each for 25 students.\"\n\nA student protested, \"But 25 students in one room? That is too many!\"\n\nMr. Cameron said, \"It is normal to have many students together.\"\n\nThe teacher calmed everyone, \"Now, now, Mr. Cameron has a grand plan. He will provide water and facilities for the new school.\"\n\nThe students felt hopeful for their new, good school. Adam and Benjamin were talking. \"Did those bad people cut Charlotte's hair? Will you stay quiet?\" asked Adam.\n\nBenjamin said, \"Why did you leave without speaking? Do our words seem like made-up sounds to you?\"\n\n\"Enough,\" said Adam. \"It is known that he only eats at home and sleeps at the place with the big building.\"\n\n\"I am going to the police place to make a complaint,\" said Adam. \"I will stop those bad people.\"\n\n\"The people should feel bad about this. We need to think about where we are going. There is no safety,\" said Benjamin.\n\n\"This should be stopped by all,\" said Adam.\n\n\"He has already done that,\" said another person. \"There is nothing left for you to stop.\"\n\n\"We don't need your feelings. Take action on him,\" said Adam.\n\n\"That's enough!\" said Benjamin. \"Why make a big deal over a small thing?\"\n\n\"This may be a small thing for you,\" said Charlotte. \"My hair is shorter, but this is a big embarrassment for me.\"\n\n\"Don't get too emotional,\" said Adam.\n\n\"Since you said they are Ethan's people, I am asking you to think practically,\" said Benjamin.\n\n\"We understand now. You are scared of his name,\" said Adam.\n\n\"You gave the complaint, I'll take care of it. You go now,\" said Benjamin. \"Come dear, let's go.\"\n\nA police officer was speaking. \"Our people have cut Charlotte's hair in public. The girl has filed a case.\"\n\n\"I like it! I like it! I'm coming,\" said Ethan.\n\nEthan said, \"This is nice! This is nice! I like this!\"\n\nEthan hit an old person with his shoe. \"You hit my people with shoes for just touching you. That's why my people cut your hair. You haven't kept quiet even after that.\" Adam and Emma had a fight. Some people saw Adam trying to remove Emma's clothes in public. Emma's sister Grace begged, \"Please save my child... please save...\"\n\nAdam's father said, \"From this day we'll act like you were never born to us... From this day, I'll live like a paralyzed person who has no feelings.\"\n\nGrace pleaded with Adam's father, \"What Emma did is wrong... Please forgive her this one time. I beg you. Please leave her.\"\n\nThe father agreed, \"Then the case? I'll withdraw it immediately. You should come back in five minutes. I'll come back immediately.\"\n\nSomeone commented, \"Not just stripping, they'll even attack people on the streets. Won't we do anything?\"\n\nThe police officer replied, \"Why not? You go and save. Aren't you here, sir! That means my life is ruined? Not that sir!\"\n\nGrace explained, \"I'm Emma's brother-in-law. We are withdrawing the case.\"\n\nThe officer said, \"Is the police so unimportant to your family? Emma asked to take action... Now you're saying to withdraw... What she did was wrong. She won't come to the station again.\" \"They're important people in a KA town.\" \"They've brought us and all our computers here.\" \"Quickly tall Ryan...\" \"Give it here.\" \"I'm David speaking.\" \"Your child has hit our people...\" \"That's why, wanting to see them, I brought their friends here.\" \"There are even a few girls among them...\" \"Your child thinks greatly of themself.\" \"Ask them to come and save their friends.\" \"Else, they might end up losing even their lives.\" \"Who's that?\" \"Where's the call from?\" \"Someone called David... has taken Matthew and his friends...\" \"What... speaking Matthew... take....\" \"Where did the phone come from?\" \"Not every call is for you.\" \"Go away. It's not for you...\" \"Maybe, but tell who was on the phone?\" \"I told it's not for you. Go inside.\" \"What happened to Matthew? Where is he?\" \"I don't know. Are you going to tell or not? I'll hit you with slippers.\" \"David!\" \"You be quiet mother. Till now you were seeing me as a child. Tell me what happened...you silly!\" If you go there, they won't let you live...someone called David. Seems he has taken your friends...why did you tell his name? Boss, He has come... How did you think you can live after hitting my people? Will you hit even after knowing they are my people? Are you such a brave person? I'll end you now for being against us! Will you do it now itself? I will do it now! Will you end me here itself? Yes. I'll end you in this spot. Just one moment sir! Seek the blessings of a higher being. This is your last day. End me now... Come on... You know how a famous leader died? Yes. That was just a small bomb. But this is a big bomb. If I just press this button, everything will explode to pieces. No. Don't press! You also will die then. That doesn't matter to me. Aren't you a bad person? You should end me. End me in this spot. Stab me here. Stab me...come on... Leave me... Bomb! All of you run away... Please leave me... Are we friends then? Yes, friends. Shall we hug then? A man said, \"I did not know that telling the truth is like fire that will burn you, if you dare to speak it.\" Another man said, \"I cannot bear it if it burns like this. I cannot eat or even drink water. I cannot even sit on the toilet peacefully in the morning.\" \n\nA person asked, \"You please tell, should I do something against Adam?\" Another replied, \"You do not fear anything. Leave the Adam matter to me.\"\n\nOne person said, \"Give a small carrot. Please give a small amount of money.\" Another said, \"Sir, come here. Fresh fish is available. Want some?\" \"Sir, please come here. Nice things like bangles, ribbons, and necklaces. You get all nice things here.\" \"Here sir, please take this.\" \"Will you give me some water, please.\"\n\nA man asked Adam, \"Are you Adam?\" Adam said, \"Yes.\" The man said, \"The police officer wanted you to come to the station.\" Adam asked, \"What for?\" The man replied, \"He will tell you at the station. You come.\"\n\nThe police officer said, \"Did you send for arresting Adam?\" Another officer replied, \"Yes sir. I wanted to punish him.\" The first officer said, \"Now that you arrested him, you do it.\" \n\nThe officer asked, \"Is this stick real?\" The other officer said, \"Yes sir! But he is not making noise.\" The first officer said, \"What can I do if he is not crying in pain?\"\n\nLater, the officer said on the phone, \"We beat him in the cell as you told. But he kept smiling all the while.\" The other person on the phone said, \"Your punishment is not enough then. What he did is not a big mistake. Let it go. I will take care of him.\"\n\nAdam prayed, \"Lord, you showed that justice still prevails by having me arrested.\" Another person said, \"I am now feeling so happy. Feels like my mind is flying on the air.\"\n\nSuddenly, Adam appeared somewhere, and people were scared and ran away. Someone said, \"Oh my god! Brother, come. I thought the law had eyes. Now I know it has none.\" Adam and Emma were good friends. One day, Adam told Emma, \"Your smile makes me happy. You are very special to me.\"\n\nEmma replied, \"Don't say such things. Our friendship is enough.\" \n\nBut Adam kept saying, \"I really like you. You are the most beautiful person I know.\"\n\nEmma felt uncomfortable and said, \"Please don't be scared. My parents will not ask you anything.\"\n\nLater, they went to Emma's home. Emma's parents asked, \"Who is this person with you?\"\n\nEmma said, \"This is Adam. He is my good friend from school.\"\n\nEmma's mother said, \"Adam looks like a nice boy. Maybe he can be our son-in-law one day.\"\n\nEmma felt embarrassed, but Adam said, \"I love Emma and want to marry her.\"\n\nEmma's parents were surprised but happy. They said, \"We can see that Adam has a good heart and no bad habits. We are glad you found someone special.\"\n\nEmma realized that her parents accepted Adam, even though they had just met him. She felt grateful for their kindness and open-mindedness. \"Threatening people, telling them to leave their home, isn't this normal for you?\" \"...it's not a dream.\" \"You were afraid to even speak in front of me, how did you find the courage to dare stand against me?\" \"I haven't come here with my child just because you warned us.\" \"I made him wear a special necklace, out of my love for him.\" \"If I hadn't done that, my child would've hurt everyone of you, and had gone to jail.\" \"He's a small kid, can't do anything to me.\" \"Do you think Gabriel is a small kid?\" \"He's like electricity.\" \"Only when you touch, you'll know its power.\" \"Adam!\" \"Take your hands off.\" \"Look, my child will come to your place... to your area.\" \"If you really have any courage... save yourself and your friends' lives...\" \"Go away!\" \"Who are you to bring them out from the police station?\" \"Are you a good person?\" \"or a higher being?\" \"Yes, I'm a higher being.\" \"Here, what I do is right and what I tell is the rule.\" \"I'm the leader of this area.\" \"I'll do as I wish.\" \"So, you mean you're the leader of this area?\" \"Yes.\" \"You mean what you do is right and what you tell is the rule?\" \"You are getting worried, right?\" \"You should.\" \"I like it.\" \"That's why, here.. in this place... before your eyes... bad things will happen. It's none other than... your friends ...your family.\" \"Not one or two... but seven bad things. Not any outsider... your friends' friends... people close to you like family and your loyal followers.\" \"Save all your friends here... if you have courage!\" \"Hurt him!\" \"It's not Gabriel or the people who caused this Adam to be hurt. It's the rules. Unless the rules change, such happenings will keep happening in every place.\"", "hash": "4c8be6242d72db8ab4cb02425ed35b690107df5437e7b38aedeebd09f6865827"}
{"text": "Once upon a time, a group of friends were traveling on a big ship. They needed to buy some maps to help them find their way. Patrick tried to make a deal with some traders for the maps. At first, the traders asked for a very high price. After some talking, they agreed on a fair price of seven thousand coins.\n\nThe traders had also captured an old woman named Talikaa. They were going to sell her as a servant. Fiona did not want to leave Talikaa behind. She said, \"We can't just leave her. I'll buy her myself if I have to.\" The traders agreed to sell Talikaa for eight hundred coins.\n\nHenry paid the traders for Talikaa. The traders warned them that Talikaa was just an old woman and would not be very useful. But Fiona was glad they had rescued her. She told Talikaa, \"It's okay. I'm a friend.\" Early one morning, Adam and his friends were talking. \"Why did you change that?\" asked Benjamin. \"We should not upset those people,\" said Cameron. \"We need to work with them for a while,\" said David.  \n\n\"Now Ethan has caused trouble for us,\" said Frank. \"When they find out we tricked them...\" \"I promise, they won't know,\" said Gabriel.  \n\n\"Henry, you cannot do things like that,\" said Isaac. \"You are making problems for us.\" \"When they come, I will give them you!\" said Jack.  \n\n\"Calm down,\" said Kevin. \"Sit down and eat something. Leave those things alone. They are mine!\" said Liam angrily.  \n\n\"It is okay, it is under control,\" said Matthew. \"We will call those people and tell them we made a mistake. We will fix it.\"  \n\n\"I am the leader here,\" said Nathan. \"I will deal with it, then deal with you! Do not touch my things.\"  \n\n\"Oliver, can you call that trading ship?\" asked Patrick. \"I will try, but it is hard to call in this area,\" said the pilot.  \n\n\"You can do it, you are smart and good,\" said Quentin. \"Are you okay?\" asked Ryan.  \n\n\"I do not have to listen to you,\" said Samuel rudely. \"No one listens to you. They listen to Thomas, not you.\"  \n\n\"Leave or I will make you leave this place,\" said Ulysses angrily.  \n\n\"Victor thinks everyone is acting strangely,\" said William. \"They are upset and emotional, except Xena,\" said Xavier.  \n\n\"You, lie down right now,\" Yosef said to Zachary forcefully. \"You are not going to hurt her.\" \"You both owe me money.\" \"Everyone on this ship owes me and I have been too patient.\" \"I want it now.\" \"Ryan... be quiet.\" \"David?\" \"Hey, listen up, man.\" \"Taylor's a lot more dangerous than she looks.\" \"Big surprise.\" \"Yes, she... she has some kind of scream that knocked us down.\" \"We followed her to the tier three bay but...\" \"I don't know...\" \"She could be anywhere by now.\" \"David?\" \"David?\" \"I will stop your attacker.\" \"I promise.\" \"Save her, first.\" \"Get her arms and legs!\" \"I don't understand why she's doing this.\" \"I actually felt sorry for her, but she's going to kill us all.\" \"We have to do something.\" \"Just g... just give me a minute, will you? I feel bad. Whatever she did s... knocked the wind out of me. Listen, we won't have much time. She could be anywhere and we have to find her. Woman, would you give it a rest? No. No, please don't be useless. Don't be... useless. Jack... Oh... she got you too? Yes, uh, I'm... not exactly sure how. She must have snuck up from behind us. I don't feel right. Neither do I. Shall we... No. We can't be weak. We have to pull ourselves together and we have to fight back. With what? She beat us. Just give it up. No, we can't. We can't! What? What's wrong with Alice? We just have to talk to Taylor, find out why she attacked us. Guide, do you know where she is? The robots are searching, but no luck so far. She can probably turn invisible. We're never going to find her. Additionally, the trading ship has changed course and is now heading toward our large ship. We cannot talk to them. Well, their plans could be bad. Oh of course they're bad! Ryan has messed them up, they're coming back to mess us up. Then... let the traders come. We'll... we'll give them everything they want. All the money we have. It's only brought us conflict anyway. Okay... something very... very weird is going on. Alice... is falling apart. Alice and Cameron were not angry. \"I should have no reason to be angry,\" Alice said. \"I believe with talking and compromise...\"\n\nCameron said, \"There is a reason to be angry.\"\n\"I really don't see how that is going to help,\" Alice replied. \"Okay?\"\n\nAlice asked, \"Still not angry?\"\n\"No, I'm not,\" Cameron answered. \"I should be... but I'm not. It's... it's like the creature has taken our strongest feeling away.\"\n\n\"The creature didn't take anything away from you,\" Alice said.\n\nAlice told Cameron to put something down. Cameron said he didn't want to do it in front of others. Alice urged him to do it. Cameron said no, he felt nothing.\n\n\"The creature has taken my energy,\" Cameron said.\n\nThe teacher said that applying force should help their condition. The principal asked if the ship responded to their signal. The teacher said no, the ship was just floating with no power to signal peace.\n\nThe principal said, \"Prepare to bring them aboard.\"\n\nHenry was angry that the teacher hadn't found the creature. The teacher explained the creature's movements were hard to track.\n\n\"This is all your fault!\" Nora yelled angrily at the teacher. Emma tried to calm Nora down, saying anger wouldn't help.\n\n\"Now we know how it ends. This is what we have to look forward to?\" Xavier said worriedly. \n\n\"By my calculations we won't have to wait that long,\" Oliver said grimly.\n\n\"Don't say that. We're going to be fine,\" Emma reassured. \"We're going to be fine. We're going to find something, we're going to figure it all out... and we are going to be... fine.\"\n\nThe teacher then explained they had information about the symptoms. A creature's touch causes exaggerated energy in its victims. The creature harvests that energy and hides it in a nest. Finding and opening the nest orbs near the victims will allow them to recover the lost energy. What is happening? We must get back the special thing! We must know how to stop the animal. Get him back! Stopping Talikaa is not the problem. Finding the energy orb is. Really? You think she will not try to protect her nest? What? Relax. Sikozu... No... no... Hold... hold her still! I was... I was attacked. I was attacked. I was attacked. We know. Adam commed. It was a big spider animal. Lie still. You are safe now. My arm and my leg... Focus your mind on healing yourself. Your limbs may still be saved. The spider animal seeks to take energy. Why did it attack you? Are you safe from its touch? Yes. Yes, I must be safe. Benjamin? Yes, he is sick but not taken energy. She is doing well, Benjamin. You may leave her now. The alien part in him is growing stronger... overcoming his other personality. I must stop him. Keep him from harming us. No! He will not harm us. I know him. You know only his other side. Kill it now. First we must find its orbs. Kill it now! Forgive me, Benjamin. No! The small robots last saw Talikaa in the neural area... but they cannot find her nest of energy orbs. So, we are in trouble. Would you stop talking like that? Well, we cannot be like this... we have.. we have to focus. All right, I say we team up. We start in the neural area and we search every level ourselves. And we will either find the orbs, or we will find the way that took them. Or, perhaps we could ask Talikaa to return the energy orbs. Let us ask her with a pulse gun. Come on. Hang on a second. I am just... dizzy. You know what the worst part of this is? You and me. We never could get it together. Now we never will. Do not ever talk like that! Come on. Captain Adam! The trading ship's engines are starting up. It must be Talikaa. I cannot seal the outer doors in time. A group of friends were on a big ship. Emma said, \"We must stop Grace.\" But Oliver said, \"It is too late. The small ship has left the big ship.\" Emma, Alice, Ryan, and Charlotte were told to get on the small ship LoLah quickly. But Alice said, \"I cannot keep up. Go without me.\" Oliver said, \"No! Forget about Alice and go.\" \n\nRachel said, \"We should probably do this quickly.\" Frank said, \"Come on, we are almost close enough.\" He said, \"Their weapons are not ready and they are not trying to escape. It should be easy to get on their ship. But we might be walking into a trap.\" \n\nRyan was told to stay and watch the scanner. If he saw any movement, he should tell them. Frank said, \"This is all my fault. I am sorry about this. I will stop that mean person myself.\" \n\nRyan said, \"No movements, just you three. Only dead people here.\" Emma said, \"She has to be here. Oh no! The ship is set to fly itself. She never left the big ship.\" \n\nOliver said, \"The small ship is empty. Grace used it to trick us. She must still be on the big ship. We are going back now, but we are very weak. You have to find the energy balls. We will all die without them.\" \n\nFrank asked, \"Are you ready to watch Alice die? Without those balls, Grace could have hid them anywhere on the big ship. We will never find them.\" Oliver said, \"That's it! Grace is the only one who knows where they are. Maybe we can get her to show us where they are.\"\n\nOliver had a plan to use a sick person as bait to find the energy balls. But he wondered what to do about another person named Isabella. \"Look what it has done to you.\" \"You are very nervous.\" \"Friend?\" \"Are we having a problem talking?\" \"I was just checking that.\" \"Some small issues, but they seem to be working normally.\" \"S... so, it is over.\" \"It is over.\" \"There is nothing more between us.\" \"Nothing.\"", "hash": "e16feed6a94144100894c72ca59a55439b954b4568d5be699397132cec96b575"}

I have a spare battery in my bag up front, next to you. \"Any idea which one, Miss Uma?\" The fancy bag, right on top. I don't see anything. Just use your eyes! It's in the side pocket! Just look! Oh no! What have you done?An adult said \"What have you done?\" three times. Another adult said \"No, fool!\" and \"If you help them, you take on duty.\" A different adult said \"It is my duty.\"\n\nOne adult said \"Let go of me.\" Then two adults called out \"Emma?\" three times. \n\nAn adult said \"What have you done?\" three more times. Another adult said \"Let me look.\"\n\nA law was stated: \"The driver of any vehicle in an accident must report within 10 days if operating a vehicle at any point involves\" but was not finished.\n\nAn adult asked \"You got a cloth or something in the car?\" Another adult responded \"Okay.\"\n\nOne adult said \"Come help me look\" and the law statement continued \"within 10 days of the accident if you are operating a vehicle and it should, at any time, involve.\"\n\nAn adult said \"Stay here\" and \"Keep her dry.\" Another adult reassured \"It's okay\" twice and \"Honey, it's okay.\"\n\nAn adult demanded \"Open the door! We need the telephone.\" Another refused \"No!\"\n\nThe reassuring adult said \"Sweetheart, it's okay\" and \"Honey, it's okay.\" The demanding adult yelled \"Give me the telephone!\"\n\nSomeone stated \"The telephone is not working, all right? You're gonna be fine. You're gonna be okay.\"\n\nAn adult exclaimed \"No! She won't stop bleeding.\" Another said \"Oh no.\"\n\nSomeone asked \"What happened?\" An explanation came \"There was an accident. May I please use your telephone?\"\n\nThe person responded \"Yeah, sure\" but then said \"Darn. I'm not getting a connection. It happens in the rain. The telephone doesn't work.\"\n\nThey suggested \"St. Jude's has 24-hour emergency care, 30 miles east.\"\n\nOne adult instructed \"Okay. You sit here, okay? Keep pressure on the wound.

What? How did you do that? How did you know I was a cop? No problem. Snacks for dinner, huh? That doesn't seem right. You got a better idea? I worked in the military mess. Maybe the diner is open.

William, just stay here and watch her. Go back and look after Charlotte. Where are you going? Just do it, please. Matthew? I don't know if I'm okay with guard duty. She's unconscious, William. She's tied to a post. Zachary. Zoe? Oh no. Zoe? I don't remember anything. We had an accident. Frank? Can you keep an eye on Charlotte for a minute? She's awake now. I have to get some medicine to help her. \"Darling, I have to go get something from my room.\" \"Oh no!\" \"What's wrong, friend?\" \"What food do you have in the fridge?\" \"You be quiet.\" \"What's in there?\" \"What's in there?\" \"What food do you have in there?\" \"Be quiet.\" \"What is it, huh?\" \"Be quiet.\" \"You can tell me.\" \"I'm good at keeping secrets.\" \"I have a big secret too.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"Bad word!\" \"What are you doing out here?\" \"Getting things that are mine.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"What, I don't get to ask a question?\" \"I'm taking photos.\" \"There have been two bad events.\" \"Before all the signs are gone.\" \"That's not an answer. You drive cars for work. What are you doing? Looking to win some 'going above and beyond' worker badge? You're not working anymore. You don't need to be a hero. There's a real cop outside.\" The one who lost a bad person? You're a complicated person, Edward. No. Not really. I think so. What month were you born? May. You are also born in May. Where were you a cop? The LA city. Were you fired or did you quit? I took a break for health reasons. It was making me sick. I burned out, I guess. One day I got a call for someone needing help. A young woman who was very sick. She was truly in a bad situation. I asked her to come to me for help. She asked me why she should keep living. What did you say? I was trained to tell her good things. Her dreams, all the people who would miss her. But for a moment, I hesitated. And she saw it. Within that moment, I couldn't think of one hopeful thing to say to her. So she jumped off a high place and died. I started getting bad headaches and eventually started fainting. So I took a break from work. What? What is it? Rhodes! It's worse. Only strange sounds! Where's that key from the actress? This was on the child. What is it, some kind of countdown? Larry! \"Go away, I did not do anything wrong!\" \"Thomas!\" \"Thomas!\" \"Thomas!\" \"My friend does not know about the bad things he did,\" said the lawyer. \"The court said he cannot be punished if he does not understand why he is being punished.\" \"He wrote down what happened.\" \"He did not just write it, he said it out loud.\" \"We also found his notebook with strange writings.\" \"Your Honor, this notebook has writings from before the bad things happened,\" said the lawyer. \"The writings change in style, tone, and point of view. It seems like different people wrote them.\" \"With your permission, Dr. Mallick will explain.\" \"Thank you,\" said Dr. Mallick. \"There is no perfect treatment for people with different minds inside them. We try to make their minds whole again.\" \"Your Honor?\" \"He is here.\" \"No! It was an accident! He ran in front of me! I am not a bad person!\" said Xavier. \"There is a dead body in your freezer, Xavier.\" \"I did not kill him. I found him like that,\" said Xavier. \"Listen! Listen! Listen! I was in the NV city last month and I lost all my money. I had no money left! I drove west. I did not know where to go, but my car was almost out of gas so I stopped at this place. There was no one at the gas station, so I went to the office. There, sitting at that desk, was the manager dead with a pie on his face. He had a heart attack or something. Then a car parts salesman came, looking for a room. I had no money so I took his money and gave him a room. I just took the key from the wall and gave him a room. Maybe that was wrong, but I had no money, and that is what I did. Then I came back in here and I moved the manager's body...His name was also Xavier. I put him in the freezer. I was not trying to hide him. It was hot out. I thought it was the best place for him until his family or someone came along. But no one did except more guests. So I checked them in too. \"And they all looked happy so I just stayed.\" \"That's too bad.\" \"This is all wrong!\" \"No, it's not!\" \"You killed him!\" \"Just like you killed my friend.\" \"Just like you killed her husband.\" \"Just like you killed his friend.\" \"Just say it.\" \"Say you killed them.\" \"Stop it!\" \"He can't take any more!\" \"All is well now.\" \"All is fine.\" \"We got the bad person.\" \"It's fine.\" \"I don't know what we got.\" \"What?\" We thought we got the bad person two hours ago, then...\nYou believe this? It's him! It's this person! He had a knife to your neck, remember? His story is so strange, I think it just might be true.\" She's got a point.\" You all are confused. Maybe it's the old burial ground. What? Read the book in there. It's all around us. A long time ago, the government moved these people here. They all died because there was no water. Now they're coming back to life, right? Come on. Don't be silly, friend.  Just take it easy, Ryan. You know, you take it easy! You've tried to run this all night. Giving orders, blaming! You blamed my friend for everything, and he ends up dead. I'm telling you, it's him! We all saw him hurt George. Your friend's bag is right there. She's dead, there's the bag. What more do you want? Stop it! Please be quiet! All right. You want a plan? Here's the plan, okay? No one will move. We'll stay here, like this, in this room until morning. No one leaves, no one moves. And if he tries anything, I'll shoot him! And if something out there comes in here, I'll shoot it! And if anyone of us tries anything, I'll shoot them! We understand. Good! Thomas? Thomas? Thomas? You need to stay in here with us. It's all right. Remember that famous drama where the 10 friends went to an island and then they all died one by one and then it turned out they weren't friends, they all had a connection? They all wronged the wrong person, and he was getting revenge. Be quiet! \"Get the kid and go.\" \"Right now.\" \"Come on.\" \"Thomas.\" \"Thomas, come on.\" \"Let's go.\" \"Get up.\" \"What's going on?\" \"They can't leave!\" \"This way.\" \"We'll see you when the storm breaks.\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"They can't leave!\" \"Where are they going?\" \"Get back here!\" \"Go, go, go!\" \"They're leaving.\" \"They're not leaving.\" \"Go!\" \"You can't let people leave after four have been hurt!\" \"You really think they're bad people?\" \"They're not leaving!\" \"Uh-oh. Penelope! Helpers. Samuel, you got a helper? Helper! Where? Back there! Nobody in there. Maybe it got so hot, they got burned. There'd be something left. You did this. You did this! You told them to get into the car! Are you happy? Where is he? Nothing. I give up! I give up! I give up! What the hell do you want? What do you want, you sick person? What do you want from us? I am turning 30 next week and I just want to go home and grow oranges! It's your birthday next week? It's my birthday next week. The 10th. Me too. Me too. Me too. Adam York, May 10. Alice York, May 10. Charlotte, May 10. Grace and Lily, May 10. Me, Samuel, May 10. What are the odds? Must be very high. What is it? Where's the helper, Samuel? Other side of the place. Grace and Lily. Charlotte. NE city NV place. Adam York. Samuel. RH place. ED place. When I was going up the stairs I met someone who wasn't there. They weren't there again today. I wish they'd go away. Who is this? Who am I speaking to right now? Where did you learn that poem? Who am I speaking to? Look at me. Who am I speaking to right now? Teacher? Edward? What's happening? \"Please be quiet.\" \"You can hear what we are saying?\" \"Yes, I can hear what you are saying.\" \"Matthew, you missed your last meeting.\" \"Where have you been?\" \"Did I black out again?\" \"Try and think back.\" \"Where have you been?\" \"All right.\" \"I was driving someone and we got stuck at the motel. There was a storm. We could not get out because of the storm.\" \"What happened at the motel?\" \"People started dying. And then their bodies...\" \"It did not make any sense. They disappeared.\" \"Matthew, I would like to show you something, if I may. Do you know this person?\" \"No.\" \"This person, Matthew, is a man with troubles. He was arrested some time ago for doing bad things to people. He did this.\" \"Please listen to me. When a child has a bad experience, their mind may split into different parts. That is what happened to this man. He developed a condition where he has different personalities.\" \"Why are you telling me this?\" \"Because you, Matthew, are one of his personalities.\" \"What? What did you do to my face?\" \"Keep calm.\" \"That is your face.\" \"Why am I tied up?\" \"Keep calm.\" \"Where is--? Please.\" \"No! I will not stay calm! Why am I tied up like this? Who are all these people? What happened at the motel? Where is everybody?\" \"They do not exist, Matthew. You were all created by this man as a child.\" \"You are a liar!\" \"Think about what you know. Everyone has a name from a place. Everyone shares the same birthday. Your blackouts.\" \"No! I was a police officer! I was a police officer in the city for six years.\" \"Matthew, please. You do not live anywhere.\" \"I do live there! You do not live anywhere.\" I know this is hard to accept, but the face you saw is the face I have always seen when I talk to you or others you have met tonight. This man is getting medical help.\" Adam and Benjamin were friends. One day, Adam said, \"I need to tell you something important.\" Benjamin replied, \"What is it?\"\n\nAdam said, \"I have many identities inside me. They will all come out and confront each other soon. There may be violence, and some identities may go away.\"\n\nBenjamin asked, \"Go away? What do you mean?\"\n\nAdam explained, \"One identity you met before, called Gabriel, took control of my body. Gabriel did something very bad. Because of what Gabriel did, I will be punished in 19 hours unless I can show that Gabriel is gone.\"\n\n\"I need your help, Benjamin,\" Adam said. \"I need you to stay with me. Gabriel?\" Adam called out to his other identity. \"Gabriel, listen to me. I need your help to finish this. The bad identity cannot survive. Do you understand?\"\n\nLater, Adam and Benjamin were in a dark place. Benjamin said, \"I can't see anything. Is there a flashlight?\"\n\nAdam replied, \"Hang on, let me check.\" But the flashlight's battery was dead.\n\nSuddenly, they heard a loud noise. It was their friend, Henry. Henry was confused and asked, \"What should I wear?\"\n\nAdam tried to calm Henry down, saying, \"It's okay, Henry. You don't need to wear anything special.\"\n\nThen another friend, Isaac, came. \"Adam!\" Isaac called. \"Adam, where are you?\"\n\nAdam and Benjamin decided they needed to leave quickly. But they couldn't find the keys to the truck. After searching, they found a spare key.\n\nHenry was still confused and wanted a gun. But Adam and Benjamin knew they couldn't give him one.\n\nAdam told Benjamin, \"Stay here, it will be okay.\" But Benjamin was worried about Adam.\n\nFinally, they found the truck keys and were able to leave safely. \"Adam, why won't you let me help you?\" \"Where did you go before?\" \"What did you see?\" \"Tell me what you saw.\" \"I saw you.\" \"I saw you in an orange tree field.\" \"Why won't you let me help you?\" \"Where did you go?\" \"What did you see?\" \"I saw you in an orange tree field.\" \"The question is whether to say the body or the mind did it.\" \"His body did these bad things, that is true.\" \"The person inside did not.\" \"Judge Taylor, that may not be true.\" \"We saw the end of 10 people tonight.\" \"Nine were good and one was bad.\" \"They're not real!\" \"The bad things he did have been stopped.\" \"Your Honor, Cameron belongs in a hospital.\" \"In the Rivers case, it is the decision of this court that Mr. Rivers should go to a hospital.\" \"I am sending Mr. Rivers to a hospital under the care of Dr. Mallick.\" \"Cracked feet and tired sounds blow in my face\" \"But it's not that way I wasn't born to lose you\" \"I want you\" \"I want you\" \"I want you so bad\" \"David. No, please don't. No, David, please. What is it, Cameron? Cameron? Bad people don't get a second chance. When I was going up the stairs I met a person who wasn't there. They weren't there again today. I wish they'd go away.", "hash": "0b11a6030cbd9d22f9481db0b8e423f73f71afe8c60f34f761b0141dadeea13d"}
{"text": "\"Me too.\" \"I've been reading it for a long time.\" \"I'm on the part where Benjamin finishes his break and looks at his book and realizes he wasn't writing.\" \"Of course, Grace's in the corner, isn't she, laughing.\" \"But crying at the same time.\" \"Yeah.\" \"'Oh, great, they've clicked.\" \"Brilliant, I hear clicking.' ...it ruins a famous drama.\" \"So, Benjamin, could you have a look at that thing for me at the front desk?\" \"The thing?\" \"Oh, that.\" \"I fixed that.\" \"Did you?\" \"Well, it's, er, gone again.\" \"No, I fixed it.\" \"Twice.\" \"I was just down there.\" \"It's definitely not working.\" \"'Go away.'\" \"What isn't?\" \"The thing you fixed.\" \"I'm just showing Taylor around...\" \"Benjamin, I'm fine. Your thing sounds... important.\" \"Maybe...\" \"Nathan. \"Super Nathan could show me the other equipment?\" \"'It's cool, there's a bond of trust.' 'He won't break the bond of trust.'\" Ow!\" Sorry. \"'Yeah, sorry. You'll be sorry, person!'\" Whoops! Ha. \"'Come on, Benjamin, don't let this ruin things.' 'Besides, once you're going steady' 'you can put her bag in the fridge and tell her she's going crazy.'\" What's funny? Nothing, sorry. Good shot. \"'It's just a game. A grown-up game.' 'It's not her fault. Didn't mention the thing!'\" Phew! 15-9. Well played. Shall we call it a day? What? Sorry, I've been invited to dinner. Aren't we going for dinner? You never said. I thought we said. I don't think we said. The whole group's going and... The whole group. The group. \"Sorry, it is not nice, but I thought...\" \"OK.\" \"It is all OK.\" \"Everything is clear.\" \"I love her.\" \"She is going to be mad at me.\" \"It is all totally OK.\" \"She is my guest, I invited her.\" \"Why do I make drinks for Ryan all day?\" \"Jess!\" \"Just, er, showing Toni the drum loop from a famous drama.\" \"She will get bored of him, just like she got bored of me.\" \"OK, see you.\" \"\"You sure you can get home from here?\" \"Yes.\" \"You can never go home again.\" \"Winter is coming. Is this where it all ends? Or is this where it all starts?\" \"This is a good idea.\" \"This is a great idea!\" \"It is exactly what they want and do not expect!\" Just do it!\" Adam, Matthew, Barbara, may I join?\" Mark. \"I am not going to eat, thanks to the expense account, I just wanted to share with you my idea...\" Mark! Can this wait? Can JLB's future wait until tomorrow? I do not think so. And you will agree when you hear the idea I was just too scared to share at the interview. I know you wanted... Redirect the phones. This was definitely a good idea. Simple as that, redirect the phones to everyone's mobiles. 24-hour, face-to-face, round-the-clock customer service. It is like, hey, I am clocking off, service to the customer! Not anymore! Probably best if you go home now, old son. I have worked with blind kids! I am the full package! I will have my action plan on your desk early in the morning. This was definitely a good idea. There is no chance this was not a good idea. Call yourself a friend, friend? What? Oh yeah, right, \"What?\" I saw you leave her flat today. She wanted drum lessons, she has a passion for music. She does not have a drum. You were not carrying a... There was no drum. You do not need a drum to... Look, I am next door, I heard your noise last night. Oh, that. That was exercises. Well, you certainly seemed to enjoy the last few a lot. \"I'm going for a drink.\" \"What happened?\" \"It's not bad.\" \"So, I offer a mix of help with other things like jobs.\" \"But mainly you're a job helper?\" \"I want to make it clear, I'm here for job help, not therapy.\" \"Not therapy.\" \"OK.\" \"What are you saying?\" \"I'm just interested in why...\" \"I don't want to talk about any hard feelings I may have, my mother, my father or my so-called childhood.\" \"Fine, fine.\" \"Well, I like to start with a bit of word play.\" \"It's...\" \"Therapy?\" \"Not really, no.\" \"I'll say a word and you tell me the very first thing that comes to your mind. 'He's trying to help me.' \"Let's start with an easy one - work.\" 'Hard place.' \"Helper.\" \"Just say the first thing that comes to mind.\" \"Money.\" 'Everything.' \"Not everything.\" \"Children.\" 'Blind.' \"Er, short.\" \"Father.\" 'Strong.' \"Ball.\" \"Mother. 'Sophia.' \"Bad word!\" \"No, not that word. Matthew, I really get the feeling you're resisting something. Can I change those? What score did I get? It wasn't good, was it?\" \"You don't get a score.\" \"Right, sure you don't.\" Maybe we should try something else. Have you done a picture test? What do you see? 'A furry thing.' 'A hungry, eating thing.' \"A kitten?\" After that start we need to hit something, yeah? 'They don't know about my big music brain.' 'To them, I'm just a mild worker.' \"The group is working.\" 'The group is like the Frog Group!' Someone needs to tell them. 'I'm an outsider but I'm on the inside.' 'This is my moment. Go on, do it, cross the bridge.' 'Make the splash.' \"Maybe you should just mess things up a bit.\" Sorry? I mean, don't you think it'd be better if the sound was more bang-pow?! Yeah. OK. Not so much A to B to C, but more sort of A to D and then back to A and then to X! \"You know, just better.\" \"Like your first song.\" \"I mean, obviously I don't want to butt in.\" \"I mean...\" \"It's your song.\" \"Cos like I say, at the moment it is very plain.\" \"Oh, Gabriel, we're doing the song.\" \"When's it gonna finish?\" \"This is hard.\" \"Where as I'm thinkin' it should be more...\" \"Whereas, like I say, at the moment it is more kind of...\" \"Which it doesn't have to be.\" \"Yeah.\" \"No.\" \"Yeah, that's great.\" \"Thanks, friend.\" \"No problem, friend.\" \"This was definitely a good idea. There's no chance this wasn't a good idea. Yeah, anyone could see that. No, I'll tell him. All right, Mr T. Cheers then. Sorry, friend, you're out. Fired? But... Ron's tough. I did everything I could. What? You didn't do anything. Earlier. Had it out with him earlier - I threatened to walk, he wouldn't have it. So are you gonna walk now? Steady on, friend, I'm not strong. That's pretty obvious. Well, I refuse. I'm not going. So what are you gonna do about that? I'm still here, Ulysses. Still standing here. You lose. Ron? He won't go. I see through you. Trying to get me out so you can take my woman. No, all right. OK. I'll put him on. ...lay down and... OK. No, that won't be needed because I'll be leaving right away. Thank you, Ron. That's your whole life. You see, he's not a good singer, but she is bad. I'm a good singer but the bad one has gone off with another singer. I mean, imagine that. That's what's happening. Don't they mind you not going in? They think I'm sick. I'm cheating the system and there's nothing they can do. Rachel's gonna pay. She'll pay all right. Yeah, I mean, what's wrong with revenge and problems and all that? Exactly! Suddenly you can't get revenge? It's too much kindness gone mad. Adam, have you seen a famous drama? \"Okay.\" \"No one thinks the cook did it.\" \"It's about two friends who help each other with problems.\" \"Got it.\" \"And how does it end?\" \"I forget.\" \"But I think it ends well.\" \"'Good luck, God bless.'\" \"This is the best.\" \"Yes, indeed.\" \"It's time to get even.\" \"\"And they are getting even out of fear.\" \"So what will you say?\" \"I'm going to hurt them and leave them in boxes.\" \"No, don't say that! That's horrible. Just say... something like... Ask if MH is there. No, they don't like jokes about that. How about MH? No, no. What should I say then? Hello? It's, um... I'm watching you. Not in a scary way, just I can see you. Yes, I can. You're eating noodles. Noodles. Whatever. Well, I'm outside. I'm behind a bush. No, I won't tell you. Look, I'm in charge here, I'm the one... There's no need to go too far, I'm just joking a bit. Benjamin, they have a toy gun! Olivia, I...! They're going to... Oh, no! That hurts! They're coming, we've got to... 'Why not just tell the truth? You could say... You could say...' 'No, there is no way to make this look good...! Oh, no!'\" \"Good thing you had those shoes.\" Yeah, I guess everything turned out okay. Yeah, they got the message. 'I made a scary call to the person I love, I hurt a pet, and now I'm going to spray a friend. What's happening to me?'\" \"You still want to do this?\" \"Yeah, it's fine. I'm ready.\" \"Great. The plan again?\" \"I give NH the food, spray them, hurt them, and take their wallet to make it look like a crime.\" \"That's the spirit. Go for it, buddy.\" 'What am I doing? I can't do this! There's no way I can do this!' Alice and Benjamin were two friends. One day, Benjamin came to see Alice. He said, \"I want to hurt Gabriel, but I cannot.\" Alice asked, \"Why did you not hurt him?\" Benjamin said, \"I am not Gabriel, I am Benjamin.\" \n\nThen Victor came in. He said, \"What a big surprise! You two are having fun.\" Alice said, \"If you cannot take it, go away.\" Victor got angry and hurt Benjamin. Benjamin cried out, \"You hurt me! It is not good.\" Victor said, \"It is good for you.\" \n\nBenjamin was very sad. He said, \"I do not want to talk about it anymore.\" Alice comforted him, \"You did not hurt Victor badly, that is good.\" Benjamin felt better after talking to Alice. He said, \"I am going to therapy and talking to people who can help me feel better.\" \"There is nothing inside hurting me.\" \"Yes?\" \"Good.\" \"Because I...\" \"I wanted to say sorry about the work thing.\" \"I know how much you wanted it.\" \"Not nice person!\" \"Not mean person.\" \"It is okay, okay, okay.\" \"I have let go of all that stuff.\" \"Yes?\" \"Totally.\" \"Oh, that is great, really.\" \"And you are well out of it, it is all politics.\" \"The joke is, I do not really want the job but Barbara made me write a letter.\" \"Ah.\" \"Right.\" \"I am not a mean person.\" \"So I just wanted to say I enjoyed sports and I hope when you are back on my team we can go back to normal.\" \"Your team.\" \"Heal and grow! Heal and grow!\" \"Well, I guess it is very nice for the big person to come down here and talk to the little person.\" \"I am just surprised you can see me from up there in your high place.\" \"If you are going to be like that then go away.\" \"Sophie! Sophie, do not go! Sophie, I... Hey, Matthew, I found it. It is for your own good.", "hash": "f8a535bf7a90a6d67c7343d4823ab0476311a159a44329abaeba0c63a7b95ab7"}

I am happy to help.\"\n\"Thank you,\" said Grace. \"I did not know where the money went.\"\n\"It is okay,\" said her friend. \"We have ways to stop money problems.\"\n\nLater, Adam and Grace met with a man named Cameron. Cameron's helper took a picture of Cameron. \"A little to your right. Head up. Happy face,\" he said.\n\nThat evening, Adam said, \"As soon as Grace unpacks, we will go out to eat dinner.\"\nAdam told his worker Nelson, \"A car is coming for me. Ask the driver to wait while I check on Grace.\"\n\nBut when Adam went inside, his mother Isabel was waiting. \"I have been here for an hour!\" she said. \"You said Grace would pick me up from the airport, but she never came back from walking the dog.\"\n\"Let me try calling Grace,\" said Adam. But Grace did not answer.\n\"Mother, go upstairs in case Grace calls. I will look for her.\" Adam told Nelson to call the police right away.\n\nThe next day, Isabel saw signs her son had put up around the neighborhood, asking for help finding Grace. Adam was going out of the building next week. \"Benjamin led a group of people,\" Adam said. \"He knew someone named Earl who worked for the police. Earl gave Benjamin information to help him.\" \n\"When did Benjamin last work with Earl?\" Adam was asked.\n\"It was in May for a store theft,\" Adam said. \"That's all I know.\"\nThe police officer said, \"I think that's all Adam will tell us. Isabel is our only person who saw what Earl did. But she will not talk.\"\n\"Maybe we should arrest Isabel instead of Earl,\" the other officer said. \"Isabel was home. She knows what happened.\"\nIn May, Isabel got a letter she did not answer.\nThe police called the CH country building in the NE city. They said Isabel had been arrested to keep her safe. The police think she knows about the killing of Benjamin, who worked for Adam's group.

One person said, \"Oliver left six weeks ago.\" \"It was not even his place.\" \"It is an old trick.\" \"Some of those hit on women who are victims of crime.\" \"It was not like that.\" \"When you two met, it was like fate,\" said another. \"The way David knew you well.\" \"Well, he should have.\" \"He had been watching you for a long time.\" \"This person is not well.\" \"Oh, come on, David.\" \"Adam told you that Benjamin did wrong and you had to take care of him.\" \"Emma, he is just playing games.\" \"This is not true.\" \"And that is when you met his beautiful wife, who loved him, took care of him.\" \"He had it good for a worker.

I swear.\" \"Emma, tell us what happened that night when Adam came over.\" \"Do not say anything.\" \"I heard them outside laughing and then I heard a noise, and then I went outside, and he was dead.

We have not received it yet. I cannot believe this... There has been no payment? We received your form for it, but we have not received payment for it. So you cannot attend the class today. Please pay immediately. Yes. Alice, it is time to eat. So the payment was not made... I woke up late... and rushed all the way here. But I could not attend class. Benjamin is dating Charlotte.

This is the start of a confusing summer break. \"But Adam is...\" \"I'm here with the task.\" \"Leave them there.\" \"So you're being a good child to him.\" \"That person is just doing their job.\" \"Dr. Amanda, you must be surprised to find out that Adam has a child.\" \"Why is that?\" \"Are you acting tough?\" \"Oh, is that how you're going to respond?\" \"This is the first time we're meeting officially.\" \"Hello.\" \"Let's eat!\" \"Oh no, bad news!\" \"Go back and work!\" \"What a way to talk to that person.\" \"There's no kindness.\" \"You have to be nice to them.\" \"That child shouldn't be seeing something like this.\" \"Is that so? Is that your response? I want to talk to you.\" No. Let's play again. I want financial support for the child. What? I won't ask for past money, so can you start giving me some from this month? You've got it wrong there. Stop joking around. I'm serious. Financial support for the child? If you can spend money on games, can you give it to me instead? You show up suddenly and claim to be my child. Then you tell me your parent died and you want money for the child. Did you honestly think I'd readily agree? Do I look like a wealthy person? You're my parent. Who do you think you are? Your child. So you're going to be forceful? This is all the money I have. Take it. Are you going to take it? You said to take it. That's all I have! But you said to take it! Are you being unreasonable? Don't accuse me of that. What are you thinking? I want it! Stop being fixated on money! I want to go to a good school. And I want to move houses! But I don't have money. All right! Wait until I finish this work. Good luck with work and as a parent. See you later. Sorry to tease you earlier. It's all right. Take it. You deserve to have it. That parent ignored you until now. Put it away before your parent gets back. Trouble! Trouble? They're going to harm me. You're going to get harmed? I'm definitely going to get harmed! What's going on? \"They're here!\" \"They're going to hurt me!\" \"Let's go up!\" \"Where are we going?\" \"Hide there.\" \"Hurry!\" \"We're safe here.\" \"They don't know about this place.\" \"What a scare!\" \"Don't worry.\" \"Say...\" \"What?\" \"Is there a reason why I had to run away?\" \"It doesn't concern me, does it?\" \"Yes, it doesn't.\" \"I can't stand this.\" \"Why are you at my home?\" \"We have nowhere else to go.\" \"This is the only place I could think of.\" \"What's wrong?\" \"You have a point.\" \"Let's go.\" \"Where?\" \"I don't want to move from here.\" \"Just come!\" \"What if I get hurt?\" \"I'll protect you, even if I get hurt.\" \"If you get hurt, you can't protect me.\" \"Stop talking back!\" \"You can stay here today.\" \nSamuel disappeared? When I went to check up on him at his room, his place was messy. Is Henry missing, too? Yes. They were most likely taken away. Can't he even do a babysitting job properly!? \nWho are you men? Are you Nathan? I'm asking you who you are! Be quiet, child! Have a seat. Let's make a deal. Will you give Henry? My boss is willing to pay a lot of money. It's not a bad deal, is it? Let me think about it. We'll be waiting for a good response.\nWhat's going on? Samuel hasn't been caught. He's doing his job. A lot of money, huh. This is getting to be interesting.\nSamuel isn't here. Is that right? Dr. Adam, aren't you... What is it? Isn't he here? I wanted to talk to him. I thought he'd know how it is as a new father. My child gets angry at home. She's at a difficult age. She doesn't even tell us when she leaves the house. So I have to go after her and scold her for it.\nManager! Why won't you talk to me? This is scary.\nEVICTION NOTICE\nHey! Isn't it dangerous to be out here during the day? It's easier to get lost in the crowd. \"The big day is tomorrow!\" \"That's a lot of questions.\" \"Answer me!\" \"Is David safe?\" \"He's as safe as he can be.\" \"Will you calm down?\" \"David said to tell you to give the money.\" \"What is he talking about?\" \"We promised to pay him a fee on the day before the big day.\" \"Make sure you give that by today.\" \"I'll be sure to take him to the place at 10 early tomorrow.\" \"Don't mess up now!\" \"What's wrong?\" \"This...\" \"Tomorrow?\" \"Samuel!\" \"Will you look at this?\" \"It's to the PI country.\" \"It's for the 10 early tomorrow.\" \"Isn't he going to do his work here with us?\" \"Stop touching my things.\" \"What's the meaning of this?\" \"Tomorrow is the day of the big day. You weren't planning to show up?\" \"How can I make a statement like that?\" \"They're very dangerous.\" \"Did you trick me?\" \"David! Did you take money from Benjamin, just to raise money to leave the country?\" \"What are you afraid of at this point?\" \"Be quiet.\" \"Be quiet!\" \"David! Why do you trick people?\" \"David! Get control!\" He ran away?\" \"We already gave the money into his account.\" \"Are you working with him?\" \"Are you kidding?\" \"I'm very sorry! I promise to bring him back!\" Please tell me the address of the company he worked for.\" \"Silly. They're bad people. Do you honestly think you can get him back alone?\" \"Will you be quiet!\" Benjamin! If you go, you'll get hurt.\" \"I'll go. It's my job. What are you thinking of?\" \"Don't be careless.\" \"Leave me alone, silly.\" \"You're going to get hurt!\" Stop following me. He tricked you! Why should you have to go to save him?\" Matthew! I promised him I'd protect him even if I die. I'll protect you, even if I die. I have to keep my promises. But... Besides, I will get paid for it. Are you silly? I'll be sure to send you to school. Just wait for me. What are you doing? Don't you have a weapon? Do you mean this? \"Come early next time.\" \"Let's go out later.\" \"Are you listening?\" \"We don't have time.\" \"Hurry.\" \"Even if something happens, you'll be my friend, won't you?\" \"I wish I could've done more!\" \"See you later.\" \"Can I ask you something?\" \"What is it?\" \"It's about my friend.\" \"Will you listen to me?\" \"Be quiet.\" \"Don't tell me to be quiet.\" \"Will you listen to me?\" \"What is it?\" \"Are you silly?\" \"Don't tell people about things like that.\" \"It's important!\" \"Something happened with them!\" \"Decide if you want love or friendship.\" \"How can you say that...\" \"Do you know it's about me?\" \"It's clear.\" \"Are you silly?\" \"This is the money for your school.\" \"Emma doesn't look happy.\" \"Keep going.\" \"Are you going to pay for it or not?\" \"Can I think for a minute?\" \"Can you skip class?\" \"I want to be with them for life, so they're a friend.\" \"Olivia is a friend I want to be with for life.\" \"I don't care who you like, but don't ruin my friendship with Olivia.\" \"Emma, keep going.\" \"NOTICE\" \"I didn't have money for that too.\" \"You can live with me.\" \"Those words were warmer than the warm weather today.\"", "hash": "41f382793f5b5d2a23220da6c2f762c2b1ea2f495d04f7bb8fbad2359410ea8b"}
{"text": "A big fish can swallow you in an instant. As the company form has done with us. The word 'company' gets attached in a bad way to and gets married with the word 'plan'. And one hears a lot about the company plan as though it is evil as though it is a plan which is trying to take over the world. Personally I don't use the word \"company\". I use the word business. I will use the word business community because I think that is a much fairer way than just using this word company. It's funny that I've taught in a business school for as long as I have without ever having been asked so directly to say what I think a company is. It is one form of business ownership? It's a group of people working together to serve many goals. The main one of which is earning big growing legal returns for the people who own the business. The modern company has grown out of the industrial time. The industrial time began in the late 18th century with an Englishman named Thomas invented a steam driven pump to pump water out of the English coal mine so the English coal workers could get more coal to mine rather than carrying buckets of water out of the mine. It was all about getting more done per man hour. That was the start of the industrial time. And then it became more steel per man hour more cloth per man hour more cars per man hour and today it's more chips per man hour more gadgets per man hour. The system is basically the same system making more complex things today. The big role of companies in our lives is basically a thing of roughly the past century. Companies were originally groups of people who were allowed by a state to do some particular thing. Like a group of people want to build a bridge over the CH river or something like that. There were very few allowed companies in early NE country history. Victor and Samuel were talking about companies. Samuel said, \"The old companies had rules in their papers about how long they could work, how much money they needed, and what they could do. They could only do what was in their papers, and they could not own other companies. Their owners had to pay for things that went wrong.\"\n\n\"The companies were supposed to help people, not just make money. But after the war many years ago, there were a lot more companies. The train companies got land from the government. There were banks and factories too.\" \n\n\"The lawyers for the companies wanted more power. They said companies were like people, and had the same rights as people. The court agreed, even though that rule was meant to protect black people after the war. Most of the cases about this rule were from companies, not black people.\"\n\n\"That is how companies got to be so powerful today. But we should be careful, because they are not really people. They are made to help people, not just make money.\"\n\nAn old man said to his worker, \"Maybe you should make your store into a company. That will keep you from having to pay for anything that goes wrong.\"\n\n\"A company is when people get papers from the government to make a business. The company can act like a person under the law. It has rights like a person, but it is not really a person. It is made to do business.\" The big company must work for money, not for good things. That is not a rule of nature. That is a choice. The big company only cares about fast money for its owners, who are few people. These owners do not care about anyone else. What does \"care\" mean? The big company must get big and make money. It is best for the company if others pay for its bad things. Economists call this \"bad things\". The \"bad thing\" is when two people do something, and a third person is hurt, but did not agree. Running a company is hard. There are costs everywhere. At some point, the company says, \"Let others deal with that.\" \"Let others guard the oil.\" \"Let others build the roads.\" \"Let others have those problems.\" This is where \"bad things\" come from. The company says, \"I have too much to do myself.\" A company is a machine that makes \"bad things\", like a shark is a machine that kills. The company and the shark do not mean to be bad. They are just made to do their job well. The company must make money now and let others pay for its \"bad things\", if no one cares. To see why a company acts like a \"bad thing\" machine, we can study it like a doctor studies a sick person. We can look at times when the company hurt others. Here is a place that helps workers. It is messy from many fights. We bought products to show the bad things. This shirt costs $14.99. But the worker who made it was paid $0.03. These jackets cost $178. But the worker was paid $0.74 for each jacket. There was a person named Samuel. Samuel said, \"Some people work very hard, but get paid very little money.\"\n\nAnother person, named Emma, said, \"Yes, in some poorer places, people are happy to work for a small amount of money. This money helps them buy food so they don't go hungry.\"\n\nSamuel said, \"That's right. Some companies come to those places and give people jobs, even though the pay is very low by our standards. The people there see it as a good opportunity to earn some money for food.\"\n\nThen a third person came and said, \"You can't be here right now.\" The door was open, but they were not allowed in at that time. Early one morning, Adam went to a doctor and said, \"I want a strong medicine that will stay in nature for a long time. I don't want to use it often.\" The doctor drew two shapes on the board and added parts to make a strong medicine. \n\nWhen the army needed help from people in a NE country, they asked local doctors to use the strong medicine to stop illness. The medicine helped stop sickness and the army joked, \"Please forgive our mess.\" \n\nAs people used more and more strong medicines, some signs showed the medicines could be dangerous. At first, there was little data, but more and more data showed that strong medicines in our homes, food, air, and water can cause sickness and problems with babies.\n\nMany companies knew about this danger but tried to hide it. If someone shoots you, it's a crime. But if a company gives you medicines that make you sick over time, it's the same thing, just slower.\n\nNow, many people get sick from strong medicines. One out of every two men and one out of three women get sick in their lifetimes. \n\nLate in the 20th century, Quentin got files about a company testing strong medicines on cows. The files showed the company lied about the medicines being safe. The files said the medicines caused problems in the cows' hearts, lungs, kidneys, and other areas.\n\nA study said the medicine caused pain and suffering to cows just to make more milk. It is a silly product because there is already too much milk in the world. Adam knew many things about the business world. Adam had sold goods to companies. Adam knew many people in the towns. Adam knew that nobody wanted the river to be polluted. But the river was being polluted. People were trying to get rich, and they made something that could destroy them. The traders in the market only cared about making money. They did not care about the environment. The traders did not stay away from things that violated environmental rules. They only thought about it for a moment. They thought, \"A town is being polluted down there, but this person needs to buy some goods. I will get paid too.\" The information the traders received did not include anything about the environment. The traders did not think about the environment at all. It was far away, and they hardly heard about it. There were also bad things happening near the traders. They traded live animals. There were many animals in a NW state, and they were polluting the rivers. But the traders did not often find out about that. There was a list of big companies that had broken the law in the late 20th century. One big oil company pled guilty and paid a large fine for spilling oil. Other big companies were guilty of fraud, environmental violations, and other violations. They paid fines too. Companies often decide whether to obey the law based on whether it is cheaper to pay the fine for breaking the law. If the chance of getting caught and the penalties are less than the cost of obeying the law, companies think of it as just a business decision. \"Not every thing can be made.\" \"Can we make carpets in a good way?\" \"I do not think so.\" \"There is a bigger question about carpets.\" \"Some things should not be made at all.\" \"If we cannot make carpets in a good way, maybe we do not belong in a good world. But nobody else who makes things in a bad way belongs either.\" \"One day early in this journey, I saw that the way I had been running was the way of a bad person, taking something that does not belong to me, something that belongs to every living thing on earth. I said to myself, 'One day, this must be not allowed. It must come.' So I said to myself, 'One day, people like me will end up in jail.'\" \"I have to be honest with you. When the bad thing happened, I did not know, and I must say this because it's not a small thing. It was a very bad thing, one of the worst things I have seen in my life. But I will tell you, and every person who was not in that place and who owned gold and silver, the first thing you thought was, 'How much is gold up?' The first thing that came to mind was, 'Gold must be going up.' Fortunately for us all, our friends were in gold. So when it went up, they all got more money. They all got more money. It was a good thing, but also a bad thing.\" \"When the bombs fell on another country, the price of oil went from a small number to a big number! We could not wait for the bombs to start falling. We were all excited. We wanted problems, because the price was going to go higher. Every person was chanting that, there was not a person who was not excited about that. This was a disaster, something very bad was happening. In bad things, there is opportunity.\" \"The pursuit of getting more is an old story, but there was a time when many things were regarded as too important or too essential for the public good to be considered business opportunities. They were protected by tradition and public rules. Some people lived in a old time. They worked on the land together. The land did not belong to them. It belonged to God. The church and rich people took care of the land.\n\nThen, in one country, the church and rich people started taking the land for themselves. They made it private land. Later, they did the same with the oceans and air.\n\nNow, many things that used to belong to everyone are owned by companies. Clean water, fresh air, and a safe place to live are like wealth. But companies say it is only wealth when they own it.\n\nA long time ago, fire fighters were private companies. They would only help people who paid them. Slowly, fighting fires became a public service that helps everyone.\n\nPublic services may cost money, but they have many good things too. We should not make them private again. It is not the same as when I was a young child, or even when the adults today were young. It is much more advanced and widespread. The things themselves are not good or bad. It is the idea of convincing children to want to buy them. \n\nIn the late 20th century, a company did a study on kids asking their parents for things. They asked parents to write down every time their child asked them for something over three weeks. They wrote down when, where and why. This study was not to help parents deal with kids asking for things. It was to help companies get kids to ask for their things better.\n\nBetween 20 and 40 percent of things parents bought were because their child asked for them. For example, a quarter of theme park visits happened because a child asked. Four out of ten visits to a place like a children's play place happened because a child asked. Any parent knows those places are noisy with many kids. But if the child asks enough, the parents will go.\n\nWe saw the same with movies, home videos, and fast food. We need to get through the barrier where parents say they don't like it when their kid asks for things. That's just an attitude they have. It doesn't mean they never do it.\n\nYou can convince people to want and buy your things. It's a game. Children are not little adults; their minds are not fully developed. Marketers are taking advantage of how children's minds work. The ads children see are designed by experts and use advanced technology.\n\nThe more you know about the consumer, the better you can communicate with them. So if that means hiring an expert, we want one. I'm not saying making things for children is wrong. It's important to have experts make developmentally appropriate toys. That's different from selling directly to children.\n\nGetting kids to ask for things is huge. In this country, we spend about $12 billion on advertising time and space. We buy TV, print, outdoor, and radio advertising time, so we're the biggest buyers of advertising in the U.S. and the world. \"They said no.\" \"Then the big company and Dr. Cameron asked the court again.\" \"To everyone's surprise, the court said yes by a small number.\" \"They said this tiny living thing looks more like a cleaning product or a tool than an animal or an insect.\" \"I laugh because they did not understand how living things work; it looked like a chemical to them.\" \"If it had antennae or eyes or wings or legs, they would never have allowed it to be owned.\" \"Then the office asked the court again.\" \"And what people should know now is the office was clear that you cannot own life.\" \"My group argued that if you allow owning this tiny living thing, it means that without any rules or asking people, companies will own the instructions for life.\" \"When they made the decision, we lost by a small number, and the chief judge said these are big issues but this is a small decision.\" \"Seven years later, the office said you can own anything alive except a whole human being.\" \"We've all heard that we have mapped the human instructions.\" \"But what people don't know is now there's a race by companies to find the treasure in the map.\" \"The treasure is the individual instructions that make up the human instructions.\" \"Every time they find an instruction, these companies claim it as their own.\" \"The breast cancer instruction, the cystic fibrosis instruction, and many more.\" \"If this continues, in less than 10 years a few global companies will own or control the actual instructions that make up our evolution.\" \"And they're now beginning to own the instructions of every other living thing on this planet.\" \"In the age of living things, some people believe life first has value and we should choose ways that respect that value...\" \"And others believe look, life is just a tool.\" \"They will agree to let the marketplace decide everything about the age of living things.\" \"In a world where information is controlled by big media companies who listen to their big advertisers, who will defend the public's right to know?\" \"And what price must be paid to preserve our ability to make informed choices?\" \"The TV company told us we were the right people to investigate.\" \"Ask tough questions and get answers.\" \"So we thought this is great, this is a dream job.\" Adam and Emma were news reporters. They wanted to tell a story about a special milk. The milk was made with a special drug from a big company called MN Corp. \n\nThe company said the drug was safe. But some scientists said it might not be safe. The company worked hard to make people think the drug was okay. They got experts and reporters to say it was fine. They even got the government to say it was safe.\n\nBut other scientists looked at the studies. They said the drug might be bad for people's health. The company did not like this. They tried to hide what the scientists found.\n\nAdam and Emma made a news story about the special milk. They said it might cause cancer. The company's lawyers sent a letter saying Adam and Emma were wrong. The news station got scared and did not show the story.\n\nIt was hard for Adam and Emma to tell the truth about the special milk. The big company had a lot of power and money. They did not want people to know the milk might be unsafe. One person said, \"The story had no factual errors. Both sides were heard.\" One week later, another person sent a strongly worded letter. It said there would be bad consequences if the story aired in the FL country. The TV station was afraid of being sued and losing money. The station owner owned many TV stations in AM city. There were many advertising dollars for products like Weed Killer and Sweet Stuff. \n\nA manager named David called the people to his office. He asked, \"What if the piece never ran?\" They said they wouldn't be happy about that. David said he could stop it from airing since he was the manager. He asked if they would tell anyone. The person said they wouldn't lie.\n\nLater, David said they had to make changes to the story. They said they had research showing the information wasn't true. David said he didn't care, and that his lawyers would decide what to write. The person said it was important news that people wanted to know. David said they paid a lot of money for the TV stations, so they decide what the news is. If the person refused to present the story the way the station wanted, they would be fired. The person said they would report being fired for refusing to lie on public airwaves. Adam said, \"We were let go because we did not want to say something false and misleading on the news.\" \"We fought against this big company and said there should be a rule more important than just making money.\" \"The boss wrote back and said, 'Yes, that's why we let you go. You resisted telling that story.'\" \"That is wrong. You cannot let workers go for standing up for what is right and legal.\"\n\nYears later, there was a trial. The jury said the story Adam was told to report was false. The company appealed. Other news groups supported the company's appeal. The appeals court said Adam had no right to sue for being fired over false news, since false news is not illegal.  \n\nMany places like the FR country and EU country do not allow a certain milk product. But it is still used in this country.  \n\nBy the late 20th century, much of the world may have no fresh drinking water. A large company in the NE city got control of all the water in another place, even rain water. Poor families had to pay a large part of their income for water, and the country could not stop the company. The more people did not like the plan to sell the water company, the more angry everyone got. Big companies have a long history of being friends with mean leaders. Is it because they want to be important that they want to look like strong leaders? There was a connection between strong leaders in the EU country and people thinking about how powerful companies were. Strong leaders in the EU country had help from big companies. The leader in the IT country was liked by businesses, and they invested more money. When the new leader came to the GE country, businesses invested more money too. He made the workers follow rules. He got rid of people who disagreed with him. Now companies could make more money. They thought these were good countries. Big companies in the AM country worked with the NA country leaders. They helped rebuild the NA country and supported the new leaders. When the war started, they found ways to keep making money. The GM company kept the OP company going. The FD company kept their company going too. The CC company could not sell their drinks, so they made a new orange drink for the NA people. This way, CC kept making money while many people died. When the new leader came to the NA country in the late 20th century, he wanted to get rid of the JW people. This was a big job that needed computers, but there were no computers then. Instead, they used the IM punch card system to store information. Every card had holes punched in different places. The system was made for each job. Lots of different people from different places went to the camps. The IM system was used to keep track of all these people on trains and in camps. This card shows information about a prisoner. The numbers are codes for which camp they went to, like AU camp is 1, BU camp is 2, and DA camp is 3. The numbers also show what kind of prisoner they were, like JW is 2, HS is 3, CM is 6, or JW is 8. Big companies often used power to get markets and make money. A famous general, Cameron, helped make countries like the FR country and NE city safe for oil companies and banks. In the late 20th century, President Henry tried to help people suffering from hard times and stop bad things companies did. Some big companies did not like Henry's plans. They tried to get Cameron to lead an army to take over the government. But Cameron did not want to do that. He told Congress about the plan. Congress found evidence that companies like JP, Dupont, and Goodyear were part of the plan. Today, companies are more powerful than governments. They have become the new leaders. A government worker was invited to a meeting with companies like Coca Cola and GTE. I am in the middle of the smart industry now. The line between industry and government is gone. They work together. \n\nMany people from groups came together to say no to an agreement that would let businesses own every resource and service. The business leaders did not care about the people outside. \n\n\"This is inside and that is outside. That's how it is,\" they said.\n\n\"It's too bad this happened. Should there be some way to be responsible?\" asked a business leader. \"Yes, and businesses know that. But being responsible means making money for shareholders and having a good public image. If companies do bad things, people won't buy from them. That's what companies don't want.\"\n\n\"These people aren't here because the government made them come or because they read about being good,\" the leader said. \"They are here because the market wants them here. That gives them an advantage over other businesses.\"  \n\n\"I listen to your concerns about climate and pollution. I don't have all the answers, but we will work with you, groups, and governments to fix it. We want to build trust so people choose our company.\"\n\nA man said half our energy could come from nature one day. People called him crazy names. But now he works for an oil company. \n\nCompanies say they want to be responsible, but maybe they just want to look responsible. But at least they try a little. That's better than nothing. Early one morning, Liam and Matthew were playing in the park. Liam said, \"Frank and Taylor work at the toy factory. They make dolls and toy cars for children.\"\n\nMatthew replied, \"I heard they don't pay their workers well. Some workers even work long hours with little pay.\"\n\nLiam looked confused and asked, \"But why would they do that? That's not fair!\"\n\nMatthew explained, \"Some big companies only care about making money. They don't always treat their workers kindly.\"\n\nLiam frowned. \"That's not right. Workers should be paid fairly for their hard work.\"\n\nMatthew nodded. \"You're right, Liam. We should be kind to everyone and treat them with respect.\"\n\nThe two friends continued playing, hoping that one day, all companies would treat their workers well. Ethan said, \"They do not see the connect between their jobs and what their kids learned in school.\" \"I am thinking this way and I said to Hannah, we are both sons and daughters of auto workers in FL city.\"\n\n\"None of us from FL city ever thought that making cars is a big reason why the ice caps are melting and ending our world. There is no connect between making cars for people and the bigger harm it causes.\"\n\n\"We must accept duty for our bigger actions that harm our world. Today, a town hall meeting will happen in CA city. People voted to discuss if democracy is real with big companies with much money and power by law. They also voted to form a group to ensure democracy controls companies in CA city.\"\n\n\"Companies are not duty-bound to the democracy process. I do not want to make all decisions for their company. But I think they must be duty-bound to us. If we dislike products, if we dislike Pepsi or Bank, if we dislike what they do, don't use them. That is peoples power to me.\"\n\n\"You have more money than me. You have more votes than me. If we boycott and vote with our dollars, that is undemocratic. What are we afraid of? Will all companies leave CA city? I do not think so. If they did, we would deal with it or do something else. We are creative people.\" \n\n\"If it is tough choosing where to buy things today, how tough when there is only one provider and it is the state? You cannot have this democracy forum in those communities either. People fear their government. I hope they understand they can join their government, but cannot join what companies do. So do not fear the government.\" A person said, \"I have been able to share my work because of a problem with the way money is made. The rich will sell things that could hurt them if they can make money from it. I hope I am part of that.\"\n\nAnother person said, \"They think that when people see my work or this show, people will not do anything because we have made their minds not care. They will not leave and do something political. They are sure of that.\"\n\nThe first person said, \"I think the opposite.
