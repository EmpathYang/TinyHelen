Here we just print a message saying if the change was made or not.\n\nThe main part goes through both the eating and drinking thing lists, asking the user if each thing is for one person or many people.

If `test_mode` is False, the code will also print a success message after changing the record.\n\nLet's think step by step:", "hash": "e43646cfc928f5dbfea43a92c4083b3c7e1cae0bde3723e07e04ed7b7aa0f0c5"}

Node names could be WeatherSeen, Place and Event. Links can show when one WeatherSeen was made at a Place. For instance, a link named \"SEEN_AT\" can connect two WeatherSeen nodes showing when one was seen at a Place.\n\n2 - Next we think about missing numbers or weird numbers. In hard weather like heat or cold or heavy rain, some numbers might not be there because of no readings or weird things happening. We can add fake nodes or links to show missing numbers or take them out depending on what we need. We can also add rules to keep the graph good. For example, all Places must have real maps or no loops in the graph.\n\n3 - To make the data easier to read for students, we can make separate views for different hard weathers (like hot days, cold nights). This lets us only look at parts of the data about the lesson topic. For example, we could view highest temperatures over 80 grouped by month and country. Or we could view lowest temperatures below freezing sorted from lowest to highest. These views can be seen using picture tools or web pages made with code like ReactJS or AngularJS.\n\n4 - To talk about good ways to act for weather guessing, we can add new nodes and links about how weather affects things, what people do, and ways to be safe from bad weather. By using science papers, news, or talks with experts like climate scientists or emergency helpers, we can show students the many parts of guessing hard weather while also talking about dangers and ways to help.\n\nLet me know if this makes sense!", "hash": "56658a804f12173514fc8c010e702e370585ec0ed51ab00e41a94b0f8b680eb9"}

Then it calculates how the money grows over the years using that interest rate.\n\nThe `getInterestRateForAge` method uses a switch to give a different interest rate for young kids (3%), middle age kids (5%), and older kids (7%). If an invalid age is given, it shows an error.\n\nThe code grows the money a little bit each year by multiplying the current money by 1 plus the interest rate. It does this for each year until the given number of years is reached. Then it adds up all the yearly money amounts to get the total grown money.\n\nThis shows kids how saving money for more years with a higher interest rate makes their money grow more over time. The different ages represent how older kids can earn higher interest rates on their savings.", "hash": "2b0b7c375ea3f27d87ffd3d6312fb3eca55efc0e2b70955d50f3098b9da2558a"}

This lets us find people by gender and age to choose the right water heat.\n\n3 - Our first code can look like this:\n```cypher \nMATCH (p:Person)\nWHERE p.gender = 'Male' AND p.age >= 65  \nRETURN COUNT(DISTINCT p.name), SUM(size(rels)) as num_takes_baths\nORDER BY num_takes_baths DESC;\n```\nThis returns the number of male persons above 65 and the total baths they've taken. The SUM() counts the sizes of relationships between a person and bathtubs. Sorting by descending order shows which males take more baths.\n\n4 - Next we could add more rules such as location, time of day, etc. For instance, let's say we want to know the average bath time for men living in Florida during the winter. We might change the code like so: \n```cypher\nMATCH (p:Person {gender:'Male'})-[r:TakesBath]-(bt:Bathtub)  \nWHERE p.location='Florida' AND r.takenDuring='Winter'\nRETURN avg(size(r));\n```\nIn this new code, we added a rule on the location of the person and also the season (winter) via the takenDuring relationship property. Since we only care about the average bath length here, we didn't use the sum() function but just calculated its average across all matches.\n\n5 - To implement if/else or switch statements, we can create separate MATCH parts for each possible condition. Here's an example where we check whether someone takes longer baths at home vs outside:\n```cypher\n// Home  \nMATCH (p:Person)-[r:TakesBath]->(bt:Bathtub)\nWHERE p.homeMode=true\nWITH p, count(*) AS cnt\nWHERE cnt > 0  \nRETURN p.name, cnt, avg(size(r))\nUNION ALL  \n\n// Outside\nMATCH (p:Person)-[r:TakesBath]->(bt:Bathtub)\nWHERE NOT p.homeMode OR p.homeMode IS NULL  \nWITH p, count(*) AS cnt\nWHERE cnt > 0\nRETURN p.name, cnt, avg(size(r))\n```\nWe used UNION ALL to include all results from both parts. \n\n6 - Finally, we can wrap up everything into a single process that takes rules and returns a list of names and statistics of the people who take the longest baths:\n```cypher  \nCREATE (person:Person{name:\"Jack\", age:30, gender:\"male\"}),(bathtub:Bathtub{})\nCREATE (:Person{name:\"Mary\", age:28, gender:\"female\"})-[:TAKES_BATH {duration:10}]->(bathtub)\nCREATE (:Person{name:\"Bob\", age:70, gender:\"male\"})-[:TAKES_BATH {duration:20}]->(bathtub)\n\nCALL myProcess({gender:\"Female\", minAge:25}) YIELD name,numBaths,avgBathTime\nRETURN name, numBaths, avgBathTime\n\n# Process definition \nPROCEDURE myProcess(rules map)\nBEGIN\n  # Find males over 65\n  WITH peopleOver65=(\n      MATCH (p:Person {gender:\"Male\", age>:65})\n      RETURN DISTINCT p\n    )\n  CALL group([peopleOver65], \"name\", {count(){as: \"numBaths\"}, sum(r.duration){as: \"totalTime\"}})", "hash": "f5b7cb02e37c2b8ef0b81fbce8c0d441ed5f7793b28b4fb6b9f4c68c2ea54fb4"}

This way, we make sure that each thing in the list has a new name.\n\nSimilarly, when taking a thing, we first make sure that the given number is in the list. Then, we use the `remove()` way to delete the thing at that number and print a message saying that the taking worked.

Make a class named Habits with three things - agreed (true/false), smokes (true/false) and drinks (a word). The constructor sets these things based on what the kid says.\n\n2. Make two lists of words called SmokingList and DrinkingList to store okay words for those things. We can use these words in our program instead of true/false. This makes the code easier to read.\n\n3. Write a method named findBadHabits() inside the Habits class. This method does not need any input and returns a word describing the worst habit for kids in the program. If there are many kids with the same worst habit, it returns all their names with ; between them.\n\n4. Inside findBadHabits(), first check if any kid has agreed to be in the program. If not, return \"Not enough kids agreed\".\n\n5. If a kid agreed, go through each kid one by one and call another method getBadHabitForKid(). This method takes one kid object and returns a word with the kid's name and worst habit. \n\n6. Also make a method getBadHabitForKid() which looks at the smoking and drinking things for a kid and finds the worst one. It keeps checking new ones against the current worst one in the loop. At the end it returns either the first worst one or a new worse one it found.\n\n7. Make sure your methods can handle problems like null properly.\n\n8. Here is sample code for getBadHabitForKid():\n\n```java\nprivate String getBadHabitForKid(Kid k){\n    //things to store temp info during looking\n    boolean currentWorst = false;  \n    String currentWorstDrinking = \"\";\n\n    //look at smoking things\n    for(String s : SmokingList){\n        //check if kid does this smoking thing\n        if(k.getSmokingThings().contains(s)){\n            //if yes, compare to current worst\n            if((currentWorst == true && !s.equals(\"no\")) ||\n                   (!currentWorst && s.equals(\"yes\"))){\n                currentWorst = !currentWorst;\n                currentWorstDrinking = s;\n            } \n        }\n    }\n\n    //look at drinking things\n    for(String d : DrinkingList){\n        //check if kid does this drinking thing\n        if(k.getDrinkingThings().contains(d)){\n            //if yes, compare to current worst\n            if((currentWorst == true && !d.equals(\"none\")) ||\n                   (!currentWorst && d.equals(\"a lot\"))){\n                currentWorst = !currentWorst;  \n                currentWorstDrinking = d;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return currentWorstDrinking;\n}\n```", "hash": "e44610ed77e381d58c6e6f94bd9a2c2c2db5a4117b170397db365046fb265288"}

First we need to make a table called 'kids' which will have info about each kid like their name, age, and if they are a boy or girl. Here is what the table might look like after adding some kids:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS kids (\n    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\n    name TEXT NOT NULL,\n    age INT,\n    gender TEXT,\n    CONSTRAINT unique_name UNIQUE(name)\n);\nINSERT INTO kids VALUES\n(NULL, 'Jack', 5, 'Boy'),\n(NULL, 'Jane', 4, 'Girl'),\n(NULL, 'Jim', 6, 'Boy');\n```\n\n2. Next let's make another table called 'check-ups' where we can store details about each kid's check-up like the date, time, and what type of check-up it was:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS check-ups (\n    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\n    kid_id INTEGER REFERENCES kids(id),\n    date TEXT NOT NULL,\n    time TEXT NOT NULL,\n    type TEXT NOT NULL,\n    notes TEXT\n);\nINSERT INTO check-ups VALUES\n(NULL, 1, '2023-02-18', '9am', 'General', 'Healthy kid'),\n(NULL, 2, '2023-02-27', '1pm', 'Vaccine', 'Got flu shot'),\n(NULL, 3, '2023-03-02', '4pm', 'Talk', 'Talked about eating good foods');\n```\n\n3. Now we can use the two tables together to answer our question \"Are kids going for their check-ups?\" by making a new view that joins all the info together:\n\n```sql\nCREATE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS kid_check_ups AS\nSELECT k.name AS kid_name, c.date, c.time, c.type FROM kids k\nLEFT JOIN check-ups c ON k.id = c.kid_id;\n```\n\n4. To see which kids did not go for a check-up, we can run this code against the view:\n\n```sql\nSELECT kid_name FROM kid_check_ups WHERE date IS NULL;\n```\n\nThis returns the names of kids who did not have any check-ups recorded in the `kid_check_ups` view. That means they likely did not go for their check-up. There could be other reasons too, like being sick or out of town, so it's good to also think about those.\n\nLet's go step-by-step:", "hash": "0ce2e7016de99b11f45ef3e9519561d43ae1ac009339b8a15310bb4c44088e15"}

The `LookAtSmallThings` class has three ways to do things:\n\n    1. `AddThing`: This way adds a new small thing with a weight. It adds the weight to the total weight and tells us a new thing was added.\n\n    2. `GetTotalWeightWords`: This way gives us words that say how heavy all the small things are together.\n\n    3. `IsTooHeavy`: This way looks at if all the small things together are too heavy. If they are, it tells us they are too heavy and gives us true. If not, it tells us they are not too heavy and gives us false.\n\n2. To use this class, make a new `LookAtSmallThings`, add some things, and look at their weight:\n\n    ```csharp\n    var looker = new LookAtSmallThings();\n\n    looker.AddThing(50);  // Added new thing that weighs 50\n    looker.AddThing(75);  // Added new thing that weighs 75\n    looker.AddThing(89);  // Added new thing that weighs 89\n\n    Console.WriteLine(looker.GetTotalWeightWords());\n\n    looker.IsTooHeavy(100);  // Output: All small things (214) are too heavy (100).\n                             // Returns: True\n\n    looker.IsTooHeavy(200);  // Output: Small things are not too heavy.\n                             // Returns: False\n    ```\n\nIn this simple set of words, we used if/else and switch/case words to look at different things that could happen. For each thing, the words first look at if that thing should happen, and then do what they need to do. This lets us write words that can change when we need them to change.\n\nLet's think one thing at a time:", "hash": "94ab2c27acbfe135faecc21f48cbe90498c81a495b04b2fe4efdf1acc37d6db8"}

The results are sorted by OverallCleanlinessScore from highest to lowest.\n\n4) Sample Code 2: Find the average number of big problems per check\n\n    ```\n    MATCH (r:EatingPlace)-[:CHECKED_AT]->(c:Check),\n    (p:Problem)<-[:HAD_PROBLEM]-(c)\n    WHERE c.bigProblems > 0\n    RETURN avg(c.bigProblems) AS AvgBigProblemsPerCheck;\n    ```\n    This code calculates the average number of big problems per check by only looking at checks where there were big problems (`WHERE c.bigProblems > 0`). The `avg()` function returns the mean value.\n\n5) Control Flow Example: If/Else Statement to Handle Different Situations Related to Duty\n\n    Let's say we want to find the name of the eating place having the highest number of big problems in the month of June. We can write code like this:\n\n    ```\n    MATCH (r:EatingPlace)-[:CHECKED_AT]->(c:Check),\n    (p:Problem)<-[:HAD_PROBLEM]-(c)\n    WHERE c.month = 'June' AND c.bigProblems > 0\n    RETURN r.name AS \"Eating Place Name\"\n    ORDER BY c.bigProblems DESC LIMIT 1;  \n    ```\n    Here, we first match all eating places and their check records that are associated with the month of 'June'. Then we filter out only those checks where they had big problems (`c.bigProblems > 0`) in that month. Finally, we sort the result by the largest number of big problems scores and return the result limited to one record using `ORDER BY` followed by `LIMIT`.\n\n    Now let's say that instead of looking for the eating place with the highest number of big problems scores in June, we really want to consider both big and small problems to get a total problems score. We can modify our code like this:\n\n    ```\n    MATCH (r:EatingPlace)-[:CHECKED_AT]->(c:Check),\n    (p:Problem)<-[:HAD_PROBLEM]-(c) \n    WHERE c.month = 'June'\n    WITH sum(c.bigProblems) AS totalbigprobs, COUNT(DISTINCT p) AS totalprobs\n    WHERE totalbigprobs > 0\n    RETURN r.name AS \"Eating Place Name\", totalbigprobs + totalprobs AS TotalProbCount\n    ORDER BY TotalProbCount DESC LIMIT 1;\n    ```\n    Now, instead of just looking at the record having the largest big problems score in June, we use another WITH subquery to total up both the number of times big problems occurred as well as the total number of unique problems that occurred during June. Then, we use another WHERE clause to filter out only the most recent record when the returned value from the subquery is greater than zero.", "hash": "2be2be11de934ea35e583f42cae0a8fcf49a5680e97363a246fa48fc3329600f"}

Then, we do not count any pages the person made themselves by checking if there is a `MADE` connection between them and the page. We use the `MAX()` function to get the latest time of all the comments on a page, and compare it with the `TIME` value of the `LIKES` connection. If the `LIKES` connection is after the latest comment time, the person did not make the commented page, so we give them 10 points. Otherwise, we only give 1 point. Finally, we order the results by score from highest to lowest and only show the top 5.\n\nThis way, we do not count likes on a person's own pages, which fixes that problem. But this code may need more changes based on how you actually want it to work.\n\nOverall, making a computer program to help new people learn requires thinking about many things like what is popular, what is new, what people like, and fixing any problems.

If the person is a man from IN city and we can't contact them, they get a 25% discount. If the person is a woman or from USA, they don't get a discount.
