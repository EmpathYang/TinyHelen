She starts to explore the world of playground friendships, play clubs, sleepovers and fun calls.\n\nBut it's not always easy - if not getting a call from one friend is sad enough, not hearing from five is even sadder. And then there is the boy she can't stop thinking about, Tall Boy from school. How will she tell him that for her it's more than just playing ...\n**About the Author**\n\nSally Lewis lives in LO city.\nADVENTURES\n\nOF A SCHOOL GIRL\n\nSally Lewis\n\n_For my buddies_\n**Thank Yous**\n\nFor a long time, I wanted to write a true story about the boys I knew, liked, dreamt of, and imagined, but I didn't start until I began my blog in the late 20th century.\n\nFor this, I would like to thank the following people: Taylor, for creating and looking after a website that has helped many people after they broke up with their friends, and gave me a place to share my early thoughts and a group of supportive people who could understand what I was feeling. Even though I sometimes ignored Taylor's advice about making new friends too soon (as you might have noticed in this book), I'm happy I had the website to share and ask for help. Sharing on the website was so helpful that I decided to start writing down my new friend-making ideas and all its good and bad parts in the blog which was the plan for the book you are now reading. Thank you, Taylor, for encouraging the sad hearts and for teaching me to make lemonade out of the lemons I was given in life.\n\nMy wonderful mom, who never seems to get tired listening to my stories, and who suggested I join my first friend-making website. Thank you for being there for me, and never judging me.\n\nMy great friend, Jack, for his patience and advice, from the first time we met when this book was still just an idea, to today. Thank you for helping with this book. \n\nCharlotte at a company, thank you for all your ideas, and Rachel for remembering my message.\n\nPatrick, thank you for letting me take care of Zachary. His love was very important to me when things were hard. He made me happy when I was sad, and even when he cried, it didn't make the day bad.\n\nMy sister, for being truthful, strong and normal, and to Henry for being like a sister when I needed one close.\n\nMy kind blog friends, your words have been very helpful over the years. Thank you for sharing, for being patient with me and for being nice.\n\nAll the boys I have met in my life, thank you for the fun times, the kisses, the meals, the drinks, the car rides, the talks, the plane rides, the massages, the parties, the dances, the happy moments, the sad moments, the messages, the boat rides, and the new things I learned. Without all this, the book would be very boring. Thank you for showing me what I like in a friend.\n\nThe professionals who helped me when I was very sad - writing helped a lot, but it wasn't the only help I got. Thanks to my helpers, the doctor who told me to join a group, the other doctor who led these groups (you don't have to like them for this to be helpful), and the other people in the group (never forget that even in a group named 'Getting Better from Sadness', there can be laughs), I managed to be happy again. I would tell anyone who feels they can't see their happy selves anymore to look for help from kind grown-ups and get back to a happy mind where they can love themselves again.\n\nI also want to say thank you to the doctors and helpers who helped me (with kindness, funny jokes, lotions, and cold therapy) during my uncomfortable skin problem and who told me it's very common. I hope this book helps others who have the same problem to know they aren't alone, and tell the moms of children who haven't grown up yet to get them protected.\n\nAdam, thank you for being a true friend, and for taking me to a place where people tell funny stories when I really needed it. Your girlfriend is a lucky girl.\n\nAlice, thank you for your angel-like help and making me feel better.\n\nDavid, for you, part of me sometimes thinks about changing my religion. May you always have love, whether you share it with one or more.\n\nSamuel, thank you for the exercises you taught me, and for helping me find my way with smarts and jokes.\n\nI am giving some of the money I make from this book to the GR charity's project in UG country, which helps local women:\n\n'Besides making better classrooms, toilets and washrooms, GR has now made the local government bring women teachers into the community primary schools who act as good examples for girls and give them support. Making women in the community stronger is very important for making long term changes in UG.' (Cameron, Aid UK)\n**Beginning**\n\nThe room is silent. There's no mail, no phone rings, no computer problems, no need to talk about the cleaning person, and our money counter will not come for another long time. There's nothing for me to do - I might as well rest my feet on my table and clean my nails before lunch. But here I am, writing as fast as I can, feeling happy and my face warm, remembering the fun from last night.\n\nMy head person stops what he's doing (probably looking at and answering his silly letters: 'Do you want a big pen?') and looks at me, wondering:\n\n'Are you making a story?'\n\n'Maybe,' I say, trying to act normal. Luckily I'm at a table where no one can see my computer. I quickly check my messages, just in case (no new messages). He goes back to what he was doing (watching people do fun things on the internet) and leaves me alone. I don't think he believed me.\n\nAfter all, what could I possibly be doing that was important to write about? Organizing papers? Fixing up my home? Handling lots of friends, a love for making friends on the internet, a big question, and a love that's not returned? Well, I guess my head person wouldn't have thought that about me; I'm a little shocked about it myself, but then again, I always thought I'd grow up to be a girl who likes having fun.\n\nWhen I was a young child, I found my parents' old books lined up neatly on the shelves below other big books by people like \"Frank\", \"Kevin\", and \"Thomas\". Sometimes, I'd take one of them and read it while I was in the bathroom, looking closely at the pages and the pictures.\n\nI told my friend at school about it and one afternoon when she came over to my house, I showed her my latest book for grown-ups. We were sitting on my bed and looking at the pages when we saw a picture of a lady sitting across a man, both of them without clothes. 'That's how my mum was sitting with her friend,' she told me. 'I saw them through a small hole in the door one afternoon.'\n\nA lady on top? Grown-ups doing this in the afternoon? Could it get any stranger? And my friend had actually seen this! I felt myself getting curious. 'When I look at these pictures,' she said, 'I get a strange feeling.' I thought she was brave to say this, as I felt the same but didn't want to say it.\n\nAt school, my friends and I had started sharing simple love stories with sweet titles, blurry covers, and exciting stories. They were full of brave, proud builders 'quickly hugging' the builder boss's shy and fancy daughter in old buildings, timid babysitters and rich farmers getting caught in the rain without a horse, and other such silly things.\n\nJessica and I made up a pretend world with brave bike-riding boy friends, tough games, and being left behind by our friends in card games. This pretend world was for all our friends. Her make-believe friend was a bit like Tom in a famous movie, mine looked like a boy I had once seen in a black-and-white afternoon TV show. That's until I saw Patrick in a famous dance movie.\n\nNot sure who to pick between the pretend, handsome and tricky Patrick and my reliable, kind friend David (shown by an old pillow), I decided to have both of them as pretend friends. Even when I was thirteen, I liked to have the best of both worlds.\n\nA lot of time has passed and I'm living the life I used to think about. After a sad goodbye, I stopped believing in having only one friend and opened my heart to friends who may not be perfect but certainly make me laugh. And while I don't live in a constant state of joy, my friend who lives with me likes to joke that I'd benefit from having a door that turns in my bedroom.\n\nIt's been a big adventure, so I started writing things down so I wouldn't mix up - and about a year and a half ago I started writing stories on the internet about my good and bad times in LO city's friend-making jungle. I wanted to honestly write down every adventure I had, the good and the bad, the highs and the lows. This is it.\n\n1\n\n**Girls' Choice**\n\nLong time ago\n\n_One sunny day_\n\nOK. Here goes.\n\nMy name is Sophia.\n\nI've got an ordinary job that means I work in an ordinary office in LO city from morning till evening. I live in a small house in a part of LO city which is slowly getting nicer, with a friend who thinks the kitchen cleans itself. I don't want to tell too much about my everyday life so I can be really honest in this blog, but I could be the person saying hello in your building, the person working with you, or the girl sitting next to you on the bus reading a book. I could be your best friend, or your past friend. The girl on the website you haven't clicked on yet. I'm older with shoulder-length yellow curly hair, and I'm tall but not thin; I like to drink juice in LO city and go dancing with my friends and while I like the regular hours of my job, I'd also like to do some more writing on the side. I was born in a small town outside of LO city and grew up in EU country by nice, not-so-rich parents who thankfully separated when I was a teenager. When I was older, I moved to LO city because I liked it and school. I liked school, but it didn't turn out perfect. School gave me a good grade in something fun, which I am now using for my job. I want to be a mom and have little ones someday, but that means I'll have to find the right friend first. Oh, and I spent this weekend with two different friends - and the one before that - but I'm not being unfair to either of them. More about them tomorrow, but first I should tell about my ideas on making friends.\n\nA few seasons ago I had a sad time with a friend I'll call Patrick, who I spent a lot of time with before he turned out to be, well, not very nice. I was left to take my sad feelings home and now I'm not so sure about the normal way of finding the right friend. You see, I still believe in best friends. I believe in pals. One's special, the others are not. I just don't believe in normal friends any more - what are they supposed to be?\n\nSomeone you're always nice to without the promise of being best friends? A friend who takes up your time while other great people pass you by? Who said that a special friendship starts the minute you become good friends with someone? When did we stop thinking that it does?\n\nAt some point I just stopped believing that there is any kind of rule for making friends at all. Boys don't make promises with rings anymore when they want to be your friend. They prefer to do it in an easier and cheaper way. But it's not always necessary to remember a girl's name.\n\nIf the boy does remember her name and the girl wants to see him again, she might want to ask 'the question' - are we friends, and if yes, what does this mean?\n\nBoys usually don't like this question, which is fine if you are also not sure if you want to be his only friend. So you don't. After all, it takes time to know someone, and it would be a shame to not make other friends.\n\nWho said we have to pick a best friend before we've made lots of friends?\n\nInstead of choosing to be best friends with someone before we know them well, we can make many friends before we decide to have a best friend.\n\nYou could say what I'm doing is 'making lots of friends'.\n\nI didn't think of this idea first. My friend Cameron told me about it.\n\nI met him at a friend's work party after coming back from a sad business trip. Even though he liked my friend at first, I liked him right away. We began to be friends - meeting for juices, laughing, hugging - but I was careful, not ready to be close friends with someone too soon after my time with Patrick. Somehow we mixed a growing friendship with fun times at places where he'd tell me how 'happy' I made him, and he'd tell me about all the fun places in his office where we could play hide and seek, or how he was going to pull me under the table right now and tickle me. At some time, these fun plans drifted off into silly ones, but he was always kind when I left alone - he knew I was already friends with someone else, and I thought he was friends with someone, too. I knew he was still thinking a lot about his ex-friend, and he knew that I'd been sad and liked him too much to risk our friendship.\n\nBesides, I seemed to be not ready for a close friendship. I'd started to see a really nice boy after my time with Patrick, but after three months of meeting and hugging, I could tell he was, not surprisingly, getting bored. I thought I was doing it all right - you know, getting to know him, making sure I really liked him a lot before becoming close friends - but the Nice Boy got bored and stopped calling. In a simple way, I felt better because I could tell things were not completely fine between us and it was just too soon for me to start another friendship.\n\nCameron gave me a chance to let go of my worries, along with some of my hopes. One evening, he and I became best friends, and I admitted to him that, after my ex, I didn't see the point of fully dedicating myself to anyone unless they'd given me a very special gift - isn't staying true a promise in a serious friendship? Cameron just smiled and said, 'What you're saying sounds a bit like having many friends. You can have several best friends at the same time who know about each other, rather than be sad and not honest with just one. I'd rather have two best friends who liked each other than try to commit to one - that would be pretty unrealistic for a long time.'\n\n'Isn't that not nice?' I said. 'I don't want to upset anyone, just don't want to get upset myself.'\n\n'It's not bad if you're honest about it and tell them what's happening. It's their choice to be friends.'\n\nI started to wonder whether I could have more than one best friend if I was totally honest about it. I didn't plan to be mean and make them feel bad, but they'd be free to come and go as they liked, so there would be none of the stress of a serious friendship.\n\nEvery girl I know has more than one good friend, and we all spend time with each friend. When you talk about boys and girls and add in love, why does that mean we can only have one friend? Why can't we be friends with more than one boy if we're not sure who we like the best?\n\nRelying on one boy to do everything - to care about me, call me, listen to me talk about school, take care of me, take me on trips, to be everything I wanted in a friend - and me giving him all my time and care and thinking of fun things to make him happy - that wasn't working. I needed a break until I felt better and could trust someone again.\n\nCameron was right. Instead of having one friend after another with them all ending with me being sad and the boy friend with another girl, why not be friends with all the boys at the same time?\n\nJust think about the good things:\n\n  * I won't have to wait for him to call. If he doesn't call, it's okay. One of the others will.\n\n  * If he's not free to play with me, I don't have to bother him or worry that he's with someone else because I'll be with another friend too.\n\n  * No worrying about asking if we're only friends with each other or if that makes you sound like a girl who wants to plan a wedding after one playdate.\n\n  * No putting your toys in one box, knowing there's a whole world of other boxes (and funny boxes) out there waiting.\n\n  * No playing games and holding back hugs to see if someone's 'kind'. Why shouldn't I hug whoever I want to, and make myself happy? I'm not a teacher, and holding back from Nice Friend had left me wanting a hug. If I am truly free, I can have all the hugs I want without feeling confused.\n\nI'm not on some silly trip against all boys. I like boys after all - a lot! - and they're not my enemies. A little bit of thinking was needed, I thought, and a lot of planning. Plus of course they get plenty out of it too - if I'm not worried about whether I can share a sandbox with them until we're old and have seven cats or if they have funny habits like leaving their socks everywhere, then I'm going to be a whole lot more accepting of any quirks. We'll have a good time, and if either of us is having a bad day the other one doesn't have to deal with it. If either of us wants more we'll have to come out with it and ask - no more trying to guess and getting it wrong. It sounds simple enough, right?\n\nMy best friend, Sophia, suggested a fun website which had helped her up her score from seventy-five to ninety-eight, so I turned on my computer, made a profile and waited to see what happened.\n\n_On a weekday in the middle of a month_\n\nSo the two friends I mentioned earlier I'll call the Pilot and Car Boy - their nicknames tell a little about them. They don't know about each other _exactly_ , but if I choose to spend one day of the weekend with the boy who's in love with his toy car and another day with my pilot friend, there's no problem. It feels odd and different to have so many friends but I'm only doing what I feel is right. Here's a little about them.\n\nI met the Pilot at a place where planes take off, of course. I was on my way back from a family gathering, carrying a pot my mom had kindly bought for me, and he was on his way back from visiting an old friend. We'd both passed through the entrance and were waiting for our flight. I didn't know we'd be on the same plane later, just noticed this very friendly blond boy drinking a milk, who was smiling at me. I smiled back and went into the book store.\n\nI don't know why I felt that he'd follow me into the store, but I picked up a magazine about swimming instead of a popular magazine so he didn't think I was too simple or worried too much about unimportant things, and sure enough he came up to me and asked me something about swimming. It turned out that he'd just finished his swimming lessons in a warm country, a place I wanted to go to, and we started talking.\n\nWhen our trip was ready, I had to move through safety checks with my big pan, only to find him waiting. It felt like we were good buddies. I was so happy to meet someone and just kept looking at his bright green eyes, as he told me about spending his free days flying his little plane over BE country. He said that he wants to be a plane driver in the future, and it'll take him four years to learn once he's got the money.\n\n'And what do you do until then?' I asked, interested in him, and when he said he worked as a safety guard, it was the last answer I thought to hear because he seemed a bit too smart for that kind of job. He told me that his work friends laugh at him for reading big newspapers rather than the _Sunday Book_.\n\nWe chatted all the way to LO city, sitting right at the back of the plane with me by the window, and he told me about plane tricks, close calls, big crashes and flying over to the IS island for fun. Once he'd worked with a wild hot air balloon team, travelling the country holding the rope on those big balloons used for showing things.\n\nI talked to him about LO city, which, being a country boy, he didn't know very well. I told him about boat rides on the big river and he liked the idea - he asked for my phone number when we were getting our bags, and I didn't wait to write it down for him. As I walked to the train, I felt like laughing. For the first time in a long while, I felt a strong liking for someone who seemed to like me too. I was excited about the possibility of a new friend - a nice pilot meeting me at an airport, maybe ready to take me on a small trip!\n\nWe went for a swim at the local park on our first day together, and ended up, a few hours later, sharing our first kiss near a famous statue in the city center. The next weekend he took me on a ride in his small airplane, which was both thrilling and scary. He even let me try flying the airplane for a bit, teaching me how to use my hands and feet to keep the airplane up in the sky. We flew over a big event, looking down at the tents and people by a narrow river.\n\nWhen we were back on the ground, he took me to his little house, and we had some older, fancy drink, then I suggested a walk in the field that was just beyond the backyard. I knew what I wanted - some fun in the tall grass - but I wasn't sure about him. He seemed a little serious, not the type to let loose when he felt like it - he'd prefer a calm evening in a room to a bright day and a gentle wind outside. I don't think he had thought about having fun outside before I pulled him close and kissed him.\n\nWe were hidden by the grass. He pulled up my skirt and slowly started to tickle me. I wondered if any pilots flying from the nearby airfield could see us. He tickled me more - he was taking his time, and I was giggly from the apple juice - then he helped me up and I sat on his lap. My long skirt was bunched up. I helped him adjust his jeans and was worried for a moment that I wasn't giggly enough - he was tickling more than I'd expected - but I was more ticklish than I'd thought. He tickled me slowly and carefully, pushing me gently onto my back against the flat grass. We giggled and laughed together, still dressed, grass seeds in my hair and bugs crawling up my legs, my head on his chest. 'That was nice,' I told him with a grin. He smiled back.\n\nAfter a while we got up and walked hand in hand back to his house. After dinner, he brought me up to his room and put on a CD of Alice's songs, which almost ruined everything. Seriously, Alice's songs? My mean first friend used to play that; hadn't Adam updated his music in the last decade? Ah well - almost a perfect summer friendship in the making, and I wasn't going to let his taste in music stop me from his slow, ticklish games. Since then, I've tried to meet him when he's not working and is available. \n\nPeter Boy came from my time of making friends online. To tell the truth, right now I'm not sure why I liked him, but on the surface, he seems to have everything: not married, tall, blond hair with blue eyes, good job at a big company, his own home, friendly and funny. I think he appeared social and serious about being a good friend. Just by talking to him I've found out that most of his friends are married and starting to have children and live happy adult lives in nice places of SO city.\n\nWe went out for some nice dinners a few months ago, then to the movie theater, and we talked a lot. When we didn't have anything to talk about we just hugged a lot instead of watching the movies. I'd try and say I should at least pay for the popcorn when he tried to pay for everything - just because his parents own a big boat, didn't mean I wanted him to feel like he has to pay for everything. I see him about once a week now, sometimes more.\n\nBut, there are some problems. First, his 'stalker' ex from the same friend-making site. I usually support any 'stalker' whose questions sound fair, especially when all they want is to understand why things ended. I don't think it's possible for someone to let go unless they know why, and I don't think it's too much for her to ask David for a drink. After all, they'd had some happy times. Does a quick trip to the coffee shop mean too much? But he just ignored her messages, hoping she'd understand.\n\nThe other thing is his little habit of calling me 'young girl' like he's my strict uncle, or he's forgotten my name. Is two years really that big of a difference, or will he stop if I start calling him 'young boy' or 'old man'?\n\nLast Saturday he said he would come to my home in the evening and take me to a party far away. We set a time, but I'd just got off the bus after a trip across the city to see a friend when I saw the shiny car outside my door, _a little early_. What? I think ten minutes late as 'on time' and can think of many things to do in the two minutes before I leave home, and I was eager to get in my door, clean my hair and put a little make-up on before I saw him. No chance. My area isn't the kind of place where new sports cars show up on every street corner. I walked a little way past the bus stop when my phone made a noise - Patrick, waiting in his car outside my house, letting me know he was there.\n\nSo, I felt rushed, moving quickly around my home packing things into bags and picking up a few snacks from the fridge; My head was filled with things I needed to do, and I really wanted to be happy to see him, and enjoy how happy _he_ was about his 'fast car'. I don't really like cars that much, but it was important to him, even though where I grew up fast cars meant grown-ups were bored. Patrick's job gives him a fancy car as a bonus, and if he wakes up early he will even drive it to work, moving through city traffic. Except that he likes Magic FM. So there we were in his nice car, riding quickly along the big road listening to old-timey music. After hearing 'Wonderful World' many times I tried to change the station but he didn't like it, so I had to sit on my hands.\n\n'Did you mind me driving quickly?' he asked me when we arrived. Quickly? I hadn't noticed. Aren't quick cars made so that you don't notice how quickly you're moving? Driving very fast is normal in the middle lane in GE country where my dad lived, so I wasn't really paying attention.\n\nThe gathering was not very fun. He spent a lot of his time talking to friends and didn't want to dance with me. Another person at this gathering turned out to be my good friend's brother, and he was surprised to see me there. 'You know,' he said to me quietly, 'he's really popular with the girls .. . .' I could only smile. \n\nThat night, we were staying in a hotel and I brought out the sweet cream and strawberries I had remembered to take from the fridge. We played around so much we broke the bed. I think that was funnier than the radio.\n\nHe had to leave early on Sunday to catch a flight so I told the hotel about the broken bed while I was standing next to his friend. I don't know what they thought, but the hotel worker didn't look too surprised. Then I had to get back to the big city in time to meet my friend.\n\n_On a Wednesday in August_\n\nOne thing about my new friends is that when you're not just focused on one friend, but hanging out with several, you really notice how different they are. When I met my friend in a pub last week, I wouldn't have guessed that he was so good at telling stories. Really interesting, deep conversation, yes, but when he shared a story with me later that night I was really surprised. Just thinking about it makes me smile really big.\n\nThere's something about him. He looks good in clothes, really tall and strong, especially when he lifted me up and moved me to his bed. But when he didn't have any clothes on, it was hard to ignore that he is quite chubby. I don't mean just a small belly, but squishy, even on his back. I know this might make me sound mean, but I'm trying to be completely honest here. Before we took a car back to his house (my school friend who I was staying with was really okay with this little adventure), I had been imagining what it would feel like to have his weight on me, and how sweet and exciting it would be to be held tightly in a hug. But it turned out to be quite worrisome. And when we were hugging with him on top, his arms started to ache and get tired from holding himself up. It took him a long time to feel really happy, and he had to help himself in the end, which is not really exciting for a girl.\n\nThe other thing is he wants to be more than friends, and that's just impossible. He lives so far away and he's four years younger than me, for goodness' sake! If I told him I want to start a family in a little while, I bet he'd be scared. Though I always wanted to marry someone in a funny costume .Patrick, who picked me up from the airport in the LE city the next day, noticed how sleepy I was, but that didn't stop us from having a little 'welcome back' play in my room.\n\nTom hasn't called since a sunny day, even though I know he's had free time. If I weren't having so much fun playing with all the friends available, I'd tell myself to be careful, otherwise, I might start liking him a lot, even though he has no treasures. He's the nicest, best friend I have ever had. He is patient, treats me like a special treasure, and is always kind - I never knew I had so many places that liked being tickled. He gives me light, sweet butterfly kisses. Oh, and then there's his sandy, wild hair, his clear green eyes (which I wish he'd keep open when we're playing), lovely lips, the way he is a little slouchy because he's so tall and slim.\n\nHe's the kind of friend I could really like, he's so close to being the best, but then there's one or two things that aren't so great. To drop the politeness and talk about it clearly, he has a really big nose, which you might think is great, but it's not. To start, regular covers don't fit him. I had to go out and buy a big lot of a brand 56 mm (did you know all the packs have measurements on the back? I didn't until David explained it) and they're not really long enough, either.\n\nThen, I think there's something about how his body works, but it's tough getting him fully ready. I get very upset if he's spent a lot of time making me happy and I just want to be close with him _now_ and then I've got to touch him and make him ready, and all the time these little bad thoughts are going through my head like, 'Am I too big to make him happy? Doesn't he like me? Is he thinking about the ball game?' and we're already on the third CD. Please, if you get into bed with me, be ready and excited - just the feel of that against my back makes me happy.\n\nActually, I found out the real way to help him finally be ready - making him keep his socks on. That's my tip for success. They can't be excited if their feet are cold, I promise. In winter, I sometimes keep my socks on too - same idea!\n\nAlso, by the way, he says I give the 'world's best jobs, ever'. Anyway, once he's finally ready he doesn't take too long or finish straight away, so I get to be happy again for a second time, which is wonderful, but he likes to make a lot of noise and breathe hard in my ears. Somehow, I'm thinking his ex-girlfriend liked that. It's a bit much for me. I don't get enough sleep because of all the long love scenes, and sometimes it's not the best when a girl just wants, say, a quick hug in the kitchen or a surprise when she stoops down in the bathroom. Car Boy is different. He's the same height as the Pilot - any taller and neither of them would fit in my bathroom - but he's a totally different shape, sturdy, in a not-too-strong way. He's got nice, fluffy blond hair on his arms and legs but a smooth chest (the Pilot has three chest hairs - I counted them). He has red hair and when he's relaxed he looks small, but he's average when he's not. He uses balloons too, by the way.\n\nHe's a funny one, Car Boy. I don't feel very close to him in feelings, and even in bed, he can be quite distant. It bothers me that he never really goes for it, just keeps warning me he's going to stop, and I've got to stop moving or he _will_ stop, and I'm just lying there thinking, 'Keep going, go _stronger_, go faster!' while I'm pulling him closer to me, wanting to feel him hug me so I get something out of it too, but he keeps holding back and it's really frustrating.\n\nThen he comes back quickly even though he was being careful. I think, hello? What about me? But then he is ready to play again almost right away, which is important if you were only halfway done playing the first time.\n\nHe also likes a certain game, and I have some problems with that:\n\n  * I once heard that girls might accidentally bite when they are very happy, and I can't forget about that.\n\n  * Does he find it dull to play a game without playing another game at the same time? Hmm...\n\n  * The way things look.\n\n  * My mind is so busy thinking about what I'm doing that I can never just relax and be happy (and accidentally bite him...)\n\nPerhaps this game would be different with Adam. I like how it feels when we play... On Sunday, I felt a little sick after playing a rough game with Peter, and I hadn't planned to play with Adam, but he has a way of making me want to play all at once, and he didn't mind and played a different game with me anyway and it made me feel better. (To anyone who thinks this is yucky, I want to repeat something my older - and smarter - friend Adam said: 'If you're going to the playground you don't have to try all the swings.')\n\nFor the second time after sleeping with the Pilot, I was so happy that I actually cried. After we'd been hugging and looking at each other like happy, pink bunnies for a bit, he got dressed. Pretending to myself I was just curious, I decided to ask him in a simple way why he didn't have a girlfriend. I know my own reasons for not having a usual relationship at the moment, but what were his? He said something about 'being busy' (he works different hours) and 'not being good at keeping in touch'.\n\nRight, this from a man who said he had a four-year relationship with someone far away - how would that have worked if he hadn't taken the time to call, visit and write to her? It did explain why he hadn't called me for a long time though, and I suppose I was just waiting while he was gone.\n\nHe had to go after that, with his work bag in hand, and the phone fixer man came at the same time so I looked a bit silly - one in, one out! The phone fixer guy liked me and told me about a hidden eating place in a town where a bottle of bubbly water costs 35. I think I'll keep that in mind for when the Sailor comes to visit. I'm trying not to remember what Patrick said.\n\nOne day\n\nThings I still miss about Pinocchio:\n\n  * Reading beside him.\n\n  * Hugging on the sofa.\n\n  * Petting his cat.\n\n  * Feeling good in his home.\n\n  * Being close with him.\n\n  * His kindness.\n\n  * Touching his smooth back.\n\n  * His nice shirt and shoes.\n\n  * His mouth, his eyes.\n\n  * Wearing his big shirt.\n\n  * Sharing jokes. Lots of jokes.\n\n  * Feeling really near him and loved.\n\n  * Eating together.\n\n  * My head on his shirt.\n\n  * 'Our favourite juice.'\n\n  * Waking up together.\n\nWhy do I still feel like this? The last time I saw him (at a party a while ago), I spilled my drink on his head. I still want what I thought I had with him, but it is getting better. The last thing I want is to feel this way again (or make someone else feel this way), so no promises and no curious questions if I can remember to not ask them. I just want to focus on what's fun in each friendship.\n\nAs for healing, I'm already doing just fine. \n\nAnother day\n\nA man named Samuel sent a message to say that he is coming to LO city. He asked if I had a place for him to sleep, or if he should find another place. He was very kind, but I hoped he would stay with a friend. I do not have a place for him to sleep. He called himself 'Gentleman of the Land', which made me laugh.\n\nI should probably say that I met him on a website for people who are unwell. I read a story about how these websites were safe places for people who were not feeling well to find love because there was no awkwardness - you both knew what each other had. There was no worry about when to tell the truth.\n\nI found out I was unwell last year and although it is very common it made me very sad at the time so I thought I'd join the website and see what it was like. And that's where I started talking with Samuel. The only problem I can see is that he is unwell in a different way to me, which means that there are certain times when he cannot do certain things because his sickness comes back sometimes.\n\nHe is a nice man in his thirties who loves to go on boats - that's why I call him Samuel. When I stayed with my friend in ED city we arranged to meet and there was a special feeling, so now I'm excited to spend more time with him - whatever that might be. He is planning to move to the south to start learning more and might end up in LO city. I guess it's a different way to meet, but does that matter when things go well?\n\nPatrick is on a work trip to AS continent but hasn't kept in touch. I haven't heard from him for a week or more. I'm thinking if I should stop being friends with him. I'm not sure what he wants - I've met all his friends, he likes me a lot, but I don't know when his birthday is or anything like that and we're running out of things to talk about.\n\nI miss the 'connection' I thought was there when I first met him. One morning when I'd stayed at his place and he was making me eggs and bacon for breakfast, I couldn't think of anything to say after we'd talked about his home and his job. So what does that leave me with, other than some confusing feelings?\n\nI'm not meeting any of the boys this weekend because my friend Jessica is visiting from the US country and we're going to NO town to enjoy the festival.\n\nOn one day late in summer,\n\nI had a fun day at NO town festival yesterday with Jessica. We had fruity drinks, danced on a small pretend beach under pretend trees outside the Westbourne and ate yummy, spicy chicken. A person I didn't know danced with me on the street, and I got hurt even though I was wearing my comfortable shoes. It took a long time to get home because there were so many people, but it was fun.\n\nWhen Jessica and I finally got on a bus, I looked at my phone and there were some messages from my friend. He asked what kind of flowers I like, so he can get me some (yay! All I asked for was a candy with funny words on it) and then he told me to take care until he comes back. What a funny friend!\n\nI replied that I was too sleepy to spend time with any of my friends right now, but he made me want to read a little. He replied quickly, suggesting I should think of a fun story. I gave him something to think about then put my phone in my bag because I could tell Jessica was getting tired of waiting for me.\n\n'Are you still meeting new friends online?' she asked me, casually.\n\n'Yes. That was one of the friends just messaging.'\n\n' _How_ many friends do you have?' she seemed surprised.\n\n'Not that many, Jessica, don't worry. I'm just not taking any of them seriously.'\n\n'Don't you think you're just looking for new friends?'\n\n'I don't think so ... . . Anyway, even if I were, what else am I supposed to do? Sit at home looking at a picture of Peter?' My toy made a sound deep in my bag.\n\nI didn't need this from Jessica, especially after Sophia told me yesterday that Peter thinks I'm 'silly'.\n\nWell, I thought, I suppose he would if what I did to his room was anything to go by - I wasn't quite myself when picking up my toys - but that was a long time ago, and anyway, how did my best friend Sam know about that? I guess he must have told her, plus a few more stories, to make himself look like he didn't do anything wrong.\n\n'I'm having fun,' I said clearly. 'As long as I'm not playing with someone, I'm free to do as I want. It's a really happy feeling to have all these friends playing with me, they're all really nice.' She didn't look happy; she looked like she didn't quite believe me. Oh no, is she trying to make me feel bad? What does she know about being the one everyone wants to play with? She has a really nice friend who is good at counting and I can't remember her being sad before. Maybe she worries that I'll never be the same again. Maybe that's not such a bad thing. I think the things you experience just become part of who you are - everyone has stories, it's how you handle them that matters. And I don't know why she or Peter cares about it.\n\nI came back when the sun was already down and my tired feet were in water. Big Boy rang from ED city, we talked a bit and I told him about my fun day at the funfair. Then he said he was going to sleep and I should too, and I thought, 'I know what this means, and I'm not sure I'm eager for it .. . . ' - isn't a phone chat just so silly? How are you supposed to enjoy with just a phone for company? He still has that fun way of talking though, so I let him convince me.\n\nOh, I was so amazed - what a chat.\n\nWe began very gently. He even asked, 'What are you wearing?' which made me laugh. Loose old sleep clothes! He told me to take them off. What? I told him I don't like sleeping without clothes, and anyway he was in ED city, so he wouldn't know if they were on or off. He said he could tell by my voice if I was not telling the truth. The bold guy, but I tell you, on the phone he's very convincing, in a kind, thoughtful way, I mean.\n\nHe told how he would remove my sleep clothes and touch me gently, then kiss my legs and tickle me... . . I was just sitting there, holding the phone in my hand and listening to his voice. He was telling me nice things and I started to feel happy. His words made me laugh less, and I felt more comfortable. He was talking about our past times, about the fun we had in a place called 'ED city'. He kept speaking into my ear, and it was nice to remember our good times. I felt so happy that I started to shake with joy. I could hear him breathing more quickly on the other end of the phone as he listened to me. I told him when he came early in the morning in ED city he gave me a warm hug from my head to my legs, and then I heard him laugh, too: with a loud 'Ha-ha-ha!'\n\nSo, I lost my toy phone - I admit it, I understand why it's fun now. We talked for a while and he tried to get me to promise him I'd travel to SC country to see him or go to some gathering in BI city, and I'm tempted, oh no! I was supposed to be keeping him at a distance. If this is a new experience, I think I like it. \n\n**Talking with Friends**\n\nA long time ago\n\n_Early in September_\n\nI will _not_ phone Adam. Maybe I scared him off by asking why he doesn't want a friend. This constant 'not talking' behaviour seems so odd from a boy who asked me to travel to AU country with him when we first met ... . .\n\nI know he has unusual working hours and doesn't always switch his toy phone on, and he told me he's not good at talking, but I think he knows he's not being nice. And here's another thing: I checked out pilot toy sets online, and yes, if you buy it yourself it takes a lot of coins! No wonder he doesn't want to be distracted by friendships if this many coins are needed. And I'm not sure I could spend another three years playing with someone who is basically a student - a very busy, very busy student. Also, I like him enough in his work clothes now, so if he were a plane driver I wouldn't be able to let him out of the house without a quick hug in the hall. Except it's never quick with him.\n\nHmm, yeah, where was I? That's what I'm scared of, my mind and my heart running away with me and making me open again. I'm still looking for the right one; that's why I'm meeting all these men at the same time and getting to know them, but when you have all these hopes of a person, you want them perfect, you want yourself perfect. Maybe I should stop seeing the Plane Driver if he's not right for me. After all, the higher you climb the further you fall.\n\n_Early in September_\n\nI saw him for the first time yesterday in my night school (I'm working on my job, as well as my friendships) and he was a bit late. He looks like a handsome man, only with bigger, nicer and more soft lips. He's tall with amazing soft green eyes, a little beard, colourful hair and light brown skin. I looked at all of him: I was even noticing the clean skin at the top of his ankles, just above his socks. I wanted to run my hand between his pants and those socks and touch his skin.I can think of his handsome face next to mine, waking up to it ... . . I want his lips on my lips. I can see him looking uncomfortable, and maybe a little worried. I'm feeling excited and want to be close to him, hold his hand.\n\nI think about him adjusting his clothes and feeling nervous. I feel like I want to be closer to him, to comfort him, make him feel secure. My legs are shaky from excitement, the thought of him being close makes me a bit nervous.\n\nOur mouths are close, sharing soft words and laughter. I giggle and he tickles my neck, making me laugh more and I gently push his head away from me by his hair. He continues to tickle me, my belly, my arms, making me squirm and laugh more. He's gentle and careful, making me feel safe and happy.\n\nHe holds my hands, helps me lay down on the bed and slowly moves closer, and I want him and I don't stop him and adjust myself towards him. He looks at me and gives me a kiss. Then he moves close to me and away from me. He moves close again and I don't want him to stop.\n\nThis gives me something to think about in class.\n\n_One day in September_\n\nAdam upset me today. I finally got to talk to him and invited him to a party at work but he said he didn't want to come because it was in a 'scary' part of LO city and it would be late, and 'it's not his thing'. Really?\n\nSo, he doesn't care about my work or my life. Can't you hear the warning sounds? He went to a big party with me and that's not exactly his thing either, _and_ I almost got in trouble with a mean FR person who I saw not waiting their turn. Isn't that 'scary' enough for him?\n\nI told him that nothing bad happened at the big party and nothing bad will happen at this work party. He is just being scared. Benjamin isn't any better. He can 'find time for me' just once a week, and tells me to behave the rest of the time. He seems to be confused.\n\n_A different day in September_\n\nI'm happy because I am seeing my friend, Sailor, again soon. He is visiting a big city, LO city, to look at schools for further studies. I'm looking after Alice's house while she's gone on a trip with her friend. This means I can offer Sailor a place to stay. He prefers not having too many plans for the trip, we'll just see what we feel like doing. I'm excited to get to know him better. Maybe we could have fun, if the good feelings I had when I first met him in ED city are still there!\n\n_Early Sunday_\n\nAfter spending a whole day with Sailor, I really like him. Yesterday, I cooked lunch for him at Alice's house. We went for a long walk in the park, then beside a long waterway, having a chat and a laugh. Later, we met Cameron and his friend from BR country at a place where people go to drink and relax. Did I say that Sailor knows how to speak the language from BR country very well? Cameron told us about a good place to eat and we said goodbye to them. We had a lovely dinner with more drinks and more talking. We talked about lots of things, like what we believe in, our parents and grandparents, and our trips to TH country. We hadn't even shared a kiss.\n\nAfter that, we went to a place where people dance and listen to music. I wanted to see how he dances and if he was confident, but it was quite empty when we arrived. So after I had a fizzy drink, he had some drink and a few breaths of smoke, we started dancing as the place began to get busy. It's strange that there are so many stories about treating small face booboos, but when the naughty germ lives below our tummy, people are often embarrassed and don't want to talk about it. I could see he was a little upset, but he kept touching me gently, then he gave me a kiss, his fingers still on me.\n\nHe kept on kissing me, his fingers moving in me, until it was too much and I touched his face so he'd stop. I lay there in his arms feeling a little strange, I wanted to touch him and feel him, but he kept his clothes on and said he was okay. 'I'm not a kid any more,' he said, and I could feel him through his clothes.\n\nThe sailor, let's call him Samuel, fell asleep, and in the morning he made me a meal we call \"FR toast\" and cleaned all the dishes. Everything felt very calm and I don't think I could have said no to him and his smooth skin, strong body, and blue eyes. He even thanked me for trusting him. I thanked him for his kindness, his warmth, and of course, for making me feel good.\n\nNow, I want to be with him so much. He's been sending me messages, telling me he loves me and how much he wants to be with me. Adam just asked if I'd done anything fun this weekend. Does he really want to know?\n\nOn a sunny day,\n\nI sat next to a tall boy (TB) in class today. He smells of soap and perfume. It's like you can feel every muscle without even touching him. I wanted to reach out and touch those big shoulders, see that strong back and move his hair to one side to kiss his smooth, brown neck.\n\nHe came for a snack with a group of us afterwards, and kept giving me more. Unfortunately TB isn't a great talker. If he were a bit braver (or possibly older - he's only a big boy) or bold then, oh my, I couldn't resist. But maybe it's a good thing he's a bit shy, because then he'd be more loyal. On the other hand, I don't care about that, do I? I just like his strong appearance, not his promise forever.\n\nI gave him a small shoulder rub when he said he felt a bit tight, and his body felt as good as it looked. I think he liked it. It turns out he used to run a lot, and his legs were certainly proof of that when I accidentally touched them under the table with my own. I guess there's no way anything could really happen with us. He is much too handsome to like me, and seems a bit too silly for me to truly like him. I would choose David, but he should stay quiet! I'm a naughty girl - I wouldn't be nice to him enough. It's not right to try and like him, unless he showed he liked me first and I couldn't say no.\n\nNaughty Nora.\n\n_Early one week_\n\nI was just having a quiet moment, thinking about the Sailor. It's exciting and such a fun thought to really like someone after being so close. But not quite. I can't wait until we're really close. He's been messaging a lot, telling me he's found a home in the WE country (he won't be in LO city for his studies after all), saying he would visit me if he could fly, but nothing was certain, and he didn't message again so I assume he couldn't find a flight. What's wrong with using a train if he really wanted to see me? So I'm a bit sad, thinking of being next to him and waking up to see his happy face, those amazing eyes. Even though he likes to blow bubbles he didn't make loud noises when he slept, and his skin was very soft.\n\nI can't believe I didn't even get to see his toy boat.\n\nHe says he'll do even better next time. Wow!\n\n_Early Saturday morning_\n\nNow, that's a challenge. Ben got my number from one of the other girls in my class and called me on Friday night when I was busy with my computer. He said he was 'nearby' and wondered what I was up to. Then he invited me for a drink. I couldn't say no.\n\nHe picked me up and we went to a place with a dance night. At first I hardly recognized him when I walked up to his car - he's not much of gentleman so he didn't get out - with a red headband hiding his hair he looked like a very tanned pirate. I was very happy, but we didn't talk much until we started a game called 'I have never'.\n\nYou say something you've never done and if the other person _has_ , they have to drink. You start slowly, with things like 'I've never been to UY country' then move on to 'I've never been a girl' (him - so I had to drink) and 'I've never been a boy' (me - so he had to drink). And you get a bit giddy, quite quickly, depending on how daring you've been.\n\nIn the middle of the day, I got a message from Patrick, saying he didn't want to see me anymore:\n\n'Hey you.'\n\n_He never calls me by my name._\n\n'I feel we haven't talked much recently. It's because of work and other things..'\n\n_Maybe he's talking about his work?_\n\n'But I think we want different things now.'\n\n_Yes, and both things are far from your bed._\n\n'So, I'm a bit confused.'\n\n_Doesn't seem like he is._\n\n'Should we say goodbye?'\n\nAnd I managed to reply, 'So, you're saying goodbye through a message? Oh no ;) I'm out dancing!' because what else could I say? Besides, I didn't mind, especially with Benjamin smiling at me, looking a bit worried as I received messages late at night.\n\nFinally, I convinced Benjamin to dance with me; he was a bit shy because he didn't know how to dance, but I taught him some steps and then we danced close to each other. Our faces were really close. I felt his breath on my cheek and we danced very closely and then we shared a kiss. I wish I wasn't so tired, but it was about time. Our chat had been a bit one-sided and all I wanted was to be closer to him, so the kiss was a lovely surprise. But he clearly doesn't want to.\n\nBenjamin was up late at night messaging me, wanting to kiss again. The feeling is the same for me.\n\n_One day_\n\nI miss Sam and Patrick. Maybe I'll just tell them about each other, so they don't feel stressed and then I can limit myself to just two friends for the rest of my life, and make both those friendships meaningful and happy and they can have all the time they need to study while I'm busy with the other. And if I'm bored I can go flying with one and sailing with the other. And if I want to go off on my own they can both look after the toys.\n\nThink that would work?\n\n_Another day_\n\nI did it. Twice. I played a game with Benjamin! I'd cooked for him and he was late - at first I almost felt like a sad little helper, preparing food for a friend who didn't say thank you - it all seemed a bit normal - but my heart felt warm when he insisted on saying thank you and we had a nice time eating the meal. We went into my room to relax for a bit with some music and TV. He still wasn't talking much, but I tried not to let that bother me.\n\nI offered him a massage, first his back, and then the little friend insisted I do his legs as well, but I told him that'd only happen if he did the same. I asked him to take off his shirt so I could help him relax. He looked as strong and healthy as I thought he would, like yummy brown ice cream. He had no blemishes, just a little mark near his chest where he said he got hurt protecting a friend. Really. He was keeping a friend safe, and three other boys ganged up on him, one with a sharp tool.\n\nSo, I started to help his legs relax, even though he still had his pants on, just pushing them up a little. But uh, how do you make someone's thighs feel good? I tried. Then he flipped onto his back. I felt a bit sad. Where was my relaxation time? He could have gone to sleep or left before it was my turn (it happened before, don't ask). I mean, we hadn't shared a hug since we had fun at the dance place.\n\nThis time we weren't silly. When he started to touch my back I felt like I was getting all warm and fuzzy. I took off my top and unfastened my underclothes so he could help me relax all the way up to my neck. His hands were amazing - big and a little tough, but well cared for. He has tiny rough spots from lifting heavy things, but his nails are clean. Lying there, the thought that he might take care of his nails made me happy.\n\nI gave my friend a hug and smiled. I was happy with him. He was a big and strong boy but not too big to play with. I didn't want our game to end quickly, so I sat next to him. He was tickling my arm and asked me what I wanted him to do.\n\nI asked him to tickle me, and he gave me this most beautiful smile, then slowly started tickling me. He sat on the floor and made me laugh till I was out of breath.\n\nI hugged and kissed him then helped him get up. I helped him take off his big shoes, gave him a toy and let him play with it, then we switched places and I sat on the floor. He looked like a pretend king with his toy crown spread out on my pillow, and his green eyes looking up at me.\n\nWe played a great game ... . . Everything was fun and exciting after that, like we were trying every possible game. It was all totally natural, even though there is no page in the _Book of Games_ where the boy is sitting on the edge of the bed and the girl is hanging away backwards, holding herself with one hand on the floor and one on his foot. We were both very sweaty when he arrived, and I gave him a towel to dry off. \n\nI laid on his chest and he held me close, gently touching my back as he fell asleep. He would wake up, look at me, and then fall asleep again. After a while, we were both awake. It was night time, and we cuddled some more. \n\nI wasn't sure if he would want to stay the whole night. It was still quite early, and he seemed tired. I had things to tidy up before I went to sleep. A girl called him, and he didn't answer his phone. I asked if she was his friend, and he seemed surprised. 'Why would I be here with you if I had a friend?' I thought it was good to ask - why _would_ he tell me if he had a friend? After all he doesn't know about my friendships. I just don't want anyone to feel sad.\n\nHe had a quick wash and then I went to shut the door downstairs. 'I'll be so happy in school tomorrow,' I told him as he said goodbye. Afterwards I thought about where this is going. As I thought, he's very nice, but a little quiet and sometimes seems either grumpy or shy. Wonder what he'll be like in our group today.\n\n_On a Tuesday_\n\nThis morning I had a message from Peter.\n\n'How are you?'\n\nI don't like it when he acts like everything is okay. We both know how it ended, and there he is, telling Sophia I'm not stable.\n\nNow I'm thinking if I should talk to his mom again, because I miss her - we really became friends. Usually, she doesn't like his friends. You don't just lose one friend when you stop being friends. My first friend had many brothers and sisters who treated me well every time I came to their house, which is more than could be said for him. Losing them was sad, but so was being hurt by him. I might write about that one day, but not on a day when Peter's confused me.\n\nI understood the other day that a lot of the reason I feel so sad is that I think about things from my past and imagine them in new situations. So if Adam doesn't call it reminds me of Peter not calling when I really needed his comfort after we stopped being friends. I guess it's just a bad habit. It'd be nice to talk to one of my friends about it, but that'd be too much. And I don't like too much, do I?\n\nI did see BB in my group yesterday too, but it was a bit strange. I had a not-so-good talk on the phone with my landlord - my friend who shares my house wants to leave and I haven't found someone new yet - and I was trying to pay attention to what the teacher was saying. I was thinking about how I was wearing the same shirt Adam had taken off me, and he was wearing the same pair of pants that I'd been taking off in a hurry just one day ago. I looked at that little bit of skin on his ankle again, and remembered wanting to kiss it, and having the chance to do so the night before, and remembered what his face looked like in the dim light of my room, just as he was about to kiss me.\n\nI had to go home right after class ended to meet a possible new friend for the house, but Adam left before me and I found him at the bottom of the stairs. I thought maybe he was trying to avoid me - did he think I'd asked him to leave last night, or was he just trying to make sure I didn't think he liked me? I was wrong - it turns out he was just worried about where he'd parked his car in case it got locked up, although of course I'd hurriedly explained about the new friend for the house before he could tell me that. He offered to drive me home.\n\nIn his car, we listened to music by 'Fred'. He knows all the words. He's a singer himself, secretly, and I listened to some of his songs last night - they were nice, even though I don't know much about songs.\n\nHe is, in a way, so different, so boyish, and full of hidden feelings and thoughts. He's a bit mysterious. There's a lot happening in his eyes - a quick flash of happiness, a lot of thoughts that he doesn't say. Yesterday in my bed, he was like a big lion, stretching and resting, then he was so gentle too. I sometimes find his voice hard to understand because it's a mix of two different ways of talking, and he has this soft voice with a relaxed way of speaking which makes me curious even when I don't always understand what he's saying. He might not always understand me too. He wants to get better at talking, but when he asked what a word meant and I told him the word for cars going on the road, he thought I'd said something silly. He looked surprised at my funny 'idea' and it took some time to tell him that I didn't want us to play in the car while we were in slow-moving cars - or was he just teasing me? I think we're missing a few jokes somewhere. I also think he hides his smartness too well, although I don't know why. I barely know anything about him but he behaves like he's from the neighborhood even though his new parents have plenty and he is good at talking and very creative.\n\nI shared a bit, even though I was trying not to talk too much and make him leave. I hinted at what had happened with Peter and confessed how sad that had made me. He listened and seemed to care, but stayed quiet, so I continued and told him I don't always like to be teased, especially when I am feeling upset, and then I worried that he thought I was making fun of his jokes. It seems like the less you talk, the more you learn about people. Maybe that's a lesson I should remember.\n\nI touched his neck and back and he asked me if he felt hard, and I had to stop the urge to give him a touch on the stomach and say a line from a famous film , 'Not yet, but it's got potential,' but the mood in the car was not right for that kind of joke. There's something a little strange about being with him, mixed with a really quiet closeness. I know it's all going in, but I don't know what he thinks because there's no response from him, so I chatter on.\n\nAs he stopped in front of my house, I gave him a peck on the cheek. Why is he so calm? I opened the door and turned back to give him a stronger kiss. He could have hugged me, but he didn't.\n\nThe new friend who might live with me was waiting. We got along really well, so I hope she can move in as soon as the old friend leaves.\n\n_Early morning_\n\nI didn't go to a meeting for a job today. I know I don't like where I work now, but the new job would have just been a quick fix - it's better if I stay with my boss for a few more months and wait for a good job to come, where I can really do well instead of making up reasons for my boss.\n\nI might be strong or weak, but I never think people will change or stop doing the same things. My boss asked me to come to his room the other day to talk about my 'work happiness' and I told him about his last-minute, 'Oh, Sophia? Could you make copies of this big book and put it on my table? And add a list while you're at it?' game and of course he said he'd 'be more careful next time' but I don't think so.\n\nIt's the same with the Driver. He won't talk to me for a long time; he said he finds it hard to 'keep in touch' with his old friend. I prefer to move on. When I was small, I used to forgive my father a lot for things he did, rather than seeing him for who he truly is. It took a while, but I became less forgiving, and perhaps that makes me difficult to handle sometimes. And perhaps that lack of forgiveness means that sometimes, when I'm moving on, my heart feels heavy with sadness.\n\nPeople like my cheerful, bright side, the side that wants everyone to join the party and be cared for, but I'm afraid that they'll be shocked when they see the not-so-nice side of me. The side that worries a lot about BBP and the Pilot. Sometimes I need to control my thoughts and feelings and view them in a different way: if a friend doesn't call, how can I be sure it's because 'she doesn't like me'? Why would BBP's quietness mean that he doesn't get it? He might understand after all.\n\nBut then, sometimes you just know. People change their feelings towards you; they don't feel the same way; they don't want to be the person you wish they would be.\n\n_A day in late November_\n\nFeeling alone. I went out with some friends last night, had one drink and started crying about a famous puppet story. Good job, Grace.\n\nI received a message from Sailor, who said he can't visit this weekend because he has to study. I was okay with it - after all, I'm not his friend, and I'll see him when I can. That's how it works.\n\nLess nice was the package from Pilot, which had a movie I had given him to watch and no message. I had asked for it back, and I was a bit short with him on the call because I was tired of him not being around, but it's not really a goodbye. I'm not going to let it bother me. At least he's not dishonest, even though Porsche Boy was more straightforward with a late-night message ('we are going separate ways' - yes, you to Boringland in a car, me looking for new adventures on my skateboard).\n\nStill, no answer to the big 'WHY?'. I knew we weren't a good match and the time wasn't right, and I think he knew it too, but nothing's going to get that out of him. If only he weren't so nice and such a good friend, I might not worry so much ... . .\n\nBoy from CA country has been quiet too.\n\n_A late November day_\n\nTonight was just strange. Wild, exciting, and a little puzzling.\n\nI met with BBP after school when he was walking down the street talking on his phone, and pulled his hoodie over his head from behind. Adam smiled and after some small talk, we went to a nearby food place. Adam said he was tired so we didn't talk a lot, but we shared our food a bit, and he said he'd like to come back to my house.\n\nI put an arm around Adam on the bus and he touched my hand. We sat there quietly, chewing our gum. Adam had headphones on - a bit strange because his music player was not working. I asked him why and he said he didn't know where else to put them. This made me laugh, although I wasn't sure if he was trying to be funny.\n\nWhen we got to my house, Adam didn't want a drink and followed me to my room. He said, 'Your room could be cleaner,' even though my room was very clean, or at least, clean for me. But I didn't know if he was joking or not. Then he lay down on the bed looking sleepy and I joined him, trying to make some fun conversation to wake him up. I tried to tell him about a movie I'd seen the night before but somehow he thought that meant I had just come back from the place where the movie was set. Our talk just kept getting stranger.\n\nThe conversation went here and there and he told me, 'I don't like girls.' What? OK, this I had to understand. 'Why not? When he starts to move, I like it and want him to hug me tight. He plays with me by moving slower, saying he doesn't want to finish the game too soon. He keeps playing until we both win the game.\n\nHe pulls the blanket over us, holding me and touching my arm gently. He falls asleep on my chest, making a noise like a snore. I stand up carefully and go to the washroom, hoping my new friend in the apartment wouldn't see me walking across the room. When I come back, I see my friend, whom I'll call Ben, still sleeping. He looks so cute that I want to run from the door and hug him. 'You're just like a little kid, all you want to do is sleep, eat and play games.' He laughs, opening his eyes a little: 'What's wrong with that?' I lay down next to him under the blanket and he touches my belly, making me feel nice.\n\nThis time, I sit on the floor with him behind me, playing and making a patting noise on my back, making me feel good until I win the game again, then I turned, took off his sock and held his hand again. Just before he fell asleep, I moved aside and he splashed water over my stomach and chest.\n\nShortly after, he was sleeping, his lovely, cute bottom peeking out from the blanket. I snuggled up close to him and felt very content and happy.\n\n_Early week_\n\nBenjamin didn't come to our evening learning time today. I don't know if he stayed away from me (probably not) or was just busy or tired, like always. I sent him a message to ask if he wanted to work on our projects together, and he replied, not understanding, 'What projects?'\n\n_Mid week_\n\nI gave in and sent a message to Patrick. He didn't answer.\n\nBenjamin called at snack time to tell me he was tired and going to sleep. OK, whatever. I suggested he call on a fun day if he wanted to go swimming or do something, but he never did. I don't know what's happening in his mind, all I know is he doesn't want to share it with me. Why call when you don't have anything to say and you don't want to arrange a playdate? I am puzzled.\n\nI know I'm supposed to be Sophia the free spirit with no attachments, but there's something that makes people become friends when they've shared a fun time and snacks. I'm confusing myself most of all. Why isn't playing games and having a fun friend enough?\n\nI'm starting to really like Benjamin and I understand we can't be together. We haven't talked about 'us' and I know it's one of those chats boys don't start, but I'm worried.\n\nI'm worried he will love me and then find out that it's just fun for me.\n\nI'm worried he thinks it's just fun and he's meeting other girls, and then I'll feel left out and sad.\n\nI'm worried he'll be upset about me meeting other boys and he'll get angry at me, but I don't know why - that worry is not because of him or the way he treats me. Where did I get this worry? Bad first boyfriend? Why am I thinking it's because of Benjamin?\n\nNone of these worries make sense. It doesn't add up.\n\n_Early in the morning_\n\nSorry, boss, I did some things wrong:\n\n  * I have been writing my diary when I should have been working for you.\n\n  * I have used some money to buy chocolates.\n\n  * I have used your things to send some letters and taken blank CDs and papers.\n\n  * I have used costly ink to print pictures of me and my friend.\n\n  * I have left for talks for other works, telling you I went to look at a house/feed my friend's pet/go to the doctor.\n\n  * I've been resting and watching shows when you're not around.\n\n  * I hid your cookies when you said I bought not-good food for our place. Then I ate them myself.\n\n  * I used the work phone for my own calls.\n\n  * I used the machine that sends paper to look for new work.\n\n  * I wouldn't mind having a friend over in the afternoon if no one else was around.\n\n  * I've been silly on the couch, then picked up the phone without cleaning my hands.\n\n  * I've eaten food from the fridge that wasn't mine.\n\n  * I've been nice to your helper.\n\nBut, I'm ready to be better if:\n\n  * You stop asking cars for your family on the work account.\n\n  * You stop asking me for small money that you don't give back or show me receipts for.\n\n  * You stop doing your own things during work time.\n\n  * You tell me good reasons to use when your wife calls.\n\n  * You manage to use the restroom for less than fifteen minutes when you get a big call, and don't go out for 'quick breaks' which take a lot of time and you turn your phone off.\n\n  * You stop saying I did your own mistakes.\n\n  * You stop taking stamps for your own letters.\n\n  * You stop eating my fruit.\n\n  * You stop telling me hard things and agree not to save the things you want me to do till the last minute when I want to go home.\n\n  * You stop thinking I can guess your thoughts.\n\n_One sunny day_\n\nI believe my time with Benjamin has come to a point where just playing doesn't make it any more. I think I won't play with him again. I know it's not leading to a friendship and there's a worry that stops it being just a carefree play. I worry about my feelings.\n\nWhile I was at my friend Nora's house for her holiday party last night he called me four times and hardly said anything. Each time I had to go out into the cold garden to take his call because of bad phone signal inside, and the others wondered why he didn't just come to the party. He didn't want to. Instead I decided to go home early and he came over at bedtime when I was ready in my comfy night clothes, and we went to sleep.\n\nSince none of the boys I've been playing with since Peter have been my friend, I've not introduced many of them to friends - not that I don't want to, but often I just don't see them enough myself or it could be strange.\n\nSophia met the Plane Man at a big festival in the summer, Charlie knows a few of my friends (mostly because he's a friend, not a playmate, and we are very comfortable with each other), and a couple of my girlfriends met Benjamin in November, when he was out with his friends and I was out with mine.\n\nLast night, Benjamin and I spent lots of time together, but Benjamin only said five words that weren't about silly things. I wanted him to stay and hoped we could talk more like we used to. However, soon we were hugging each other tightly in bed. He fell asleep again, but his breathing was fast. I thought maybe he was pretending to sleep so he didn't have to talk to me. I couldn't sleep and just watched him. I knew that this might be the last time we could be together like this and it would be difficult to say goodbye. Even when he was asleep, things felt a little strange. I gently woke him up this morning.\n\nBut then, he left without having breakfast. He said he didn't want to get a parking ticket, which made me feel silly for bringing him breakfast from the kitchen. I saw him sitting in his car outside the house, opening a packet of his favourite candies that I'd given him as an early holiday gift. He was still there fifteen minutes later, so I called him to see if he was okay. He said he didn't know why I was worried because he was driving to work. When I checked again, his car was gone. I didn't understand why he didn't just tell me what he was doing.\n\nWhen he left, he wished me a happy holiday and gave me a kiss. Happy Holiday. At least I arrived at school on time.\n\n**The Silly Story**\n\nWINTER\n\n_Saturday_\n\nI went Christmas gift hunting today - trying to finish everything before I travel to my mom's house - and found myself in a street in CO city that always brings a happy memory to my mind. I woke up in a house there once - the day after my first visit to a dress-up party - you could say I jumped right in.\n\nI went with a group of friendly pals who were just planning to have fun. I wore a shiny top and a rubber skirt - just some simple things I'd picked up in CA Market - tall boots and lots of face paint. And underclothes, which shows how much I know!\n\nWe got a lot more fun than we expected. I think I knew that 'dress-up' can mean just about anything, but when you see 'everything' all around you, well, it's a bit surprising. There was one older man with curly hair who wore nothing but a pair of sheer women's clothes and shoes.\n\nWe were sticking together on the dance floor, dancing but looking at everything that was happening, the little pretend games being played. Someone was playing tag next door (you could hear the laughs and cheers over the music).This content is inappropriate for children. It contains explicit adult themes which are not suitable for a preschool audience. I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.\n\n_On a sunny Sunday_\n\nQuiet from BB. I guess I can't say this is very bad. He doesn't seem to care that I've moved away, which I should be happy about, but my thoughts and feelings are all mixed up. My friend Lily had a chat with me last night (she asked about BB and I told her all about my recent mixed-up feelings). She thinks that you shouldn't try to find a boyfriend, but the right boy will show up when you don't need him. It's like you have to surprise luck - 'Ha! Tricked you! I was lonely after all!' It's easy for her to say that as she's had a boyfriend she's been upset about for five years, but she's kind of right. Even if I'm trying not to be serious with these boys, I get sad when it doesn't work out and I don't need that.\n\nA new job would be nice though. And a new boss. Why does work get worse in the holiday season? Why doesn't peace and kindness reach busy office workers with silly bosses?\n\n_On a bright Monday_\n\nHow can having so much fun make you feel so bad? Yesterday Cameron took me to a big holiday party at a place. The theme was Fancy Dress-Up, and they had people in costume: people dressed like flowers with big pretend leaves, girls in short colorful dresses and even some girls on roller skates. I wish I had brought my skates. There was a band and we had lots of free drinks, and that's when we found the chocolate fountain. Just when you're so happy you don't care if you look silly and get messy brown stuff all over your clothes. I ate so much I had to go to the bathroom, and then Adam tried to give me a kiss when I came out, and all I wanted was something to make my mouth fresh. I took a small cake from a passing tray instead.\n\nThomas was there so I made Adam dance with me in front of him like a silly person and then we went behind a curtain for a little kiss. We went home separately and all today's been a big down time. Too much chocolate?\n\nI don't know why I don't like Adam more - he looked nice, he dances really well and I feel totally easy with him. Maybe I'm just not being fair because I don't want someone who thinks he'll only be happy with at least two friends. I don't want to do this forever.\n\n_Early day before Christmas Eve_\n\nHappy Silly day everybody.\n\nI went out for a juice with Sophia at one of our favourite places last night. We haven't had much time to talk, and I was really excited about it, but one juice in we somehow talked about the story of a puppet.\n\nShe wanted to tell me something. It was during a holiday.\n\n'Sophia, about him .. . . '\n\nShe seemed uneasy, and a bit restless.\n\n'Patrick? You still see him? But you said you didn't talk to him any more.'\n\n'Well Sophia, I do, I always liked him and his friends.'\n\n'You said you wanted to be friends with me more.' Now I sound like a little kid.\n\n'I didn't want you to be upset.'\n\n'I'm upset now. I'm more upset because you didn't tell me the truth,' my throat felt scratchy and my voice was getting louder.\n\n'Look, I met him at the same time you first met him - and you know we were friends too.' She sounded like she was trying to explain herself. He was not nice to me, then he moves on and takes my best friend with him. That's not fair!\n\n'Oh, don't try and pretend it's OK. I can't believe you didn't tell me the truth! I asked you! And you didn't tell me!' I'd started to cry now, but tried hard to stop. I didn't want her to see just how upset I was so she'd think I was still 'upset' about him. Anyway, who was I to tell Alice whom she could be friends with?\n\nShe seemed really cold and wanted to talk about something else, so I hid behind the juice menu. Two boys at the next table had been looking at us all night, and now the one facing me saw the sad look on my face and tears in my eyes.\n\nHe asked if I was OK while his friend started talking to Sophia about the party they were going to later.\n\nWe sat and talked for a while - he was in some show and Sophia knew him, but I didn't tell him - and he also said he was learning to be a helper. I felt okay telling him why I was feeling so sad and left out, and his attention made me feel a bit better. When I felt a little calmer, I said goodbye, finished my drink and left.\n\nI was so happy sometimes last year, trying to forget about Peter, and now I find out what was happening when I didn't know and it's enough to make anyone upset. Who knows what he and Sophia were saying about me. Or not saying. To think that she even knew about his new friend, who, to make me feel better, 'isn't as pretty as you'.\n\nWhy is it that even though boys can make us girls feel bad, there's nothing like feeling let down by a friend. That really hurts.\n\n_On a winter day_\n\nAfter a few days of being pampered by Mom, I'm feeling a bit better. I visited a helper that a friend of Mom's suggested, to get some help with my feelings and my still-broken heart.\n\nI only saw her for a short time; I just haven't been able to shake off this feeling of being lost that came over me after breaking up with Patrick, and Sam just made it worse. What if I really started to like someone else? How would I know if I could trust them? I'd known Patrick for a long time before we started dating, and he was one of my friends. If I couldn't trust him and Sam, who could I trust?\n\nMaybe 'helper' is not the right word - what the lady did for me was more like guidance, not a strange ritual. Before I saw her I could barely say Patrick's name without crying, but she stopped me and told me I wasn't lost. I needed to be strong and admit that I'd chosen to stay with him, even when I started to feel something was wrong. I mean, why else would I have been reading his messages?\n\nWhen she said that, I remembered that when I was with Patrick, I had a lot of strong dreams about his old friend - the one he still liked all along - and I'd wake up sad and mixed-up, feeling like I'd been let down. My feelings were all there, but I did not listen to them.\n\nWhat she said to me was very simple, but it made me feel better: 'Yes, people might not always tell you the truth, but you can still trust your feelings. If you do not listen to your own feelings, you are not being fair to yourself and this can make you feel sad.'\n\nSo I should not be too worried about making new friends because if I trust my feelings, I would be right most times and they would keep me safe. It looks like I might be in control after all.\n\nI got a nice message from Charlie asking me how my holiday was and hoping he would see me in the new year. That made me feel better. I still think about the Pilot, but I am feeling better about my thoughts about Peter. Sarah still makes it hard.\n\n_Early morning on the last day of the year_\n\nHow have I used my time? Let me think.\n\nI did not need to spend two years liking my GE country teacher's son when I was seventeen, when he only played with me once before leaving me for a younger girl. (He called me worried later because someone thought they had seen me with a baby - we didn't even get close.)\n\nWhen I was eighteen, I did not need to leave home to live with a boy who did not finish school, who cared more about his games than his clothes, and who once pushed me towards a hot pan before hitting me.\n  2. To be true to myself and to know what is important. When I make friends, I try very hard to make them happy and sometimes I forget about myself. I forget about my classes and my own needs, and it doesn't end well.\n  3. Not to have too much juice and then feel sorry. I have felt bad when I have had too much juice. I do silly things: I dance, take cups, talk to strangers, and drink any juice left around. It's not nice.\n  4. To find a new job, so I don't spend my whole life eating cookies in the storage room and wishing my teacher would go out so I can rest. \n\n_Early January_\n\nI finally talked to Sophia on the phone to wish her a happy New Year and to make things better between us.\n\nI went to my old friend Jessica's New Year's party, and had a good time even without drinking juice - at least I could drive myself home and woke up without feeling tired!\n\nNothing could have made me ready for what Sophia was about to tell me about her New Year's Eve, however.\n\n'I stayed at home and had some juice with my friend Madison,' was all she said at first. Remembering some strange dream I had about Sophia having fun with a puppet a few nights earlier and remembering my talk with the healer about feelings, I asked more. 'Why didn't you answer your phone when I called?' I asked.\n\n'Actually, I have something to tell you,' she started saying and I felt scared.\n\n'I went to SP country, and Madison came too. We stayed in Peter's house with him and his new friend, and some other people,' she continued. If Samuel had just hit me twice in the stomach at this point I don't think it would have hurt any more.\n\nI was shocked. I just stopped talking to her, feeling nothing.\n\n'You two fibbers deserve each other,' I sent her a message later. She insisted I say sorry. I didn't listen to her. That's the end, then, I suppose.\n\n_On a Saturday in January_\n\nI've been back in LO city for over a week, and now the silly men are trying to date me, and I think I like it. Well, not seven - that's a little too much, but two's a coincidence, isn't it?\n\nThe first one I'll call Ball Game Boy. I met him on a friend meeting website before Christmas, and we had a great time on our first day out. We've read all the same children's books, like the same silly TV shows and I even found out he likes to sing songs. He works with kids, is from a nice family, cute, likes sports (that's why 'Ball Game Boy'), healthy, has visited many places, doesn't smoke, likes his parents (who bought him a house) ... . . tick, tick, tick. He understood my jokes the way no one has since Peter, and has pretty eyes and strong arms which I was looking at as we ate. It was nice that he paid for dinner, and he shared his food. But, he's a little bit shorter than me.\n\nI'd teased by email that I'd have to wear flat shoes, and he teased he'd wear tall shoes, and when he got up from his chair to say hi to me I wished he had, but after a short chat I'd forgotten all about it. A long time later we said goodbye with a hug and a peck on the cheek, but I was excited and he called me as soon as he could. We've seen each other again for another dinner, and I wore tall shoes to see if I would feel odd. I did, a little, but he stands tall and he's built like a small, strong animal, plus _he_ didn't seem to have any problems walking down the street with a tall woman in green boots.\n\nHe's asked me to come to his home for lunch and a turn on the singing game. I'm curious to see what will happen. I'm still not drinking much so I'm enjoying just getting to know him, and curious to see where this goes.\n\nThe second person is my friend to talk to - the TV show person I met in the place to drink when Samuel told me something surprising that she was still friends with Peter. Between my talks about my old best friend and my other old friend, we found out that we know some of the same people. He said he wanted to talk to a friend we both know. A few days later, I told this friend, and soon after, Mr TV show called me. He must have got my number from the friend.\n\nAnd since then? Well, we've had juice a couple of times and I'm still trying to understand what he wants. He calls me 'dear' and is friendly, which tells me something. I feel a little silly for being upset in front of someone I don't know well, but what's done is done. He seems to like helping me when I'm upset!\n\n_One morning in winter_\n\nDating lots of people means not having to pick just one. So why does it sometimes feel like I'm deciding who is best? The more I date, the fewer rules and 'must haves' I think matter. But sometimes something happens and I think, 'No - that's not right.'\n\nHaving lunch on a sunny day at Rugby Boy's house in the countryside was really nice. And yes, house. Not apartment. A big, separate four-bedroom house with a garden, a garage and a fast car outside. As we turned the corner into the new pretty street and he pointed it out, I felt a little bit greedy inside. I just met a boy named Adam and I like him a lot. But now I wonder, do I like him because he's nice or because of his nice home? We had more fun together than the last two times we met.\n\nHis living room was big and fancy with new brown couches, a fireplace, lots of DVDs and books that I like, a piano that he played very well, and the smell of yummy dinner.\n\nDuring dinner, we talked a little about his old friend who went to AF country to help people and met another friend there. He listened to my new poems. They weren't in English, so I'm not sure how much he understood.\n\nWe sang some songs together. He sang a song that reminded me of a friend who got very sick. Then we sang another song together. He said he liked my voice, even though it was a little scratchy. Then he went to the kitchen to do something. I sat down to play the piano. He came back and asked me for a kiss in a nice way. Even a few days later, I still feel happy thinking about that moment. I wish he was closer to me.\n\nHe sat down next to me on the bench and we hugged. It felt just right: not too hard, not too soft ... just perfect. We both felt really happy after that hug. \n\nWe cuddled up on the sofa to watch a funny movie on his new TV, but he had seen it before and I was distracted by my juice (I know I said I wouldn't drink, but I had one glass), so I couldn't tell you what the movie was about. My head lay on his lap, him looking down at me with his nice blue eyes, blond hair falling over his forehead, his hand gently stroking my arm. Should I stay with him on the sofa? \n\nI remembered my promise to myself and moved his hand away. He was a true friend, taking me to the train station in his cool car in time to catch the last train home. We hugged again and I could see that he was happy. Since then we've been talking and texting several times a day.\n\nThis story is about a man named Ryan and a lady named Alice. One day, Ryan and Alice didn't meet as planned because of a mix-up. Ryan called Alice to say sorry and asked if she would have dinner with him. \n\nOn the day they were supposed to meet, Alice hadn't heard from Ryan until late afternoon, so she sent him a message with the name of a restaurant and a time to meet. \n\nThey both arrived at the restaurant on time and began to eat their first dishes. Alice had a glass of fruit juice, but Ryan, who doesn't eat meat, didn't find many options he liked, so he suggested going to another restaurant. Since Ryan hadn't eaten anything and the first dishes were free, Alice only paid for her juice.\n\nThe second restaurant they went to was a bit expensive. A restaurant helper recognized Ryan, which made Alice laugh. The helper stayed close by and listened to their conversation, which made Alice feel shy about talking to Ryan. The helper suggested Alice try the fish, which she enjoyed, and she had another juice while Ryan had water, pie and some fries. The dinner didn't feel very romantic like the time Alice had spent with another friend, Liam, except for when Ryan told Alice she had pretty ears and reached over to touch one.\n\nWhen it was time to pay, Alice put down her card to pay for half. She thought Ryan might pay for everything because he suggested the dinner and picked the restaurant. He knows that Alice doesn't have a good job and doesn't make much money. Alice usually offers to share the cost, but her friends usually tell her not to worry about it.\n\nMr Ryan seemed a little upset too, because his part of the food was less than mine. If this had happened with my friend Benjamin, would I still have been going to the bathroom to answer _his_ messages? Would giving money for my fish have made me think better about the fact that Mr Ryan spent the entire time talking to me like an older friend or uncle? I like friendships like that - I have an older boy friend named Adam who I really like - but not relationships. We said goodbye with a hug and a kiss on the face, and I didn't feel at all upset when I got home, nor when I just wrote this.\n\nI'm happy I met him but I really like my friend Benjamin and his plans for the comfy chairs.\n\n_Early in the morning_\n\nLast night with Benjamin went in a way I didn't like. So much so that I got scared and started thinking of scary, strange things and the fact that it was very late and I was far from any buses or trains, and the doors of his house were closed.\n\nSo, Benjamin plays ball. He asked me to sleep over, and he drank a lot, a lot of drinks. And I got afraid all of a sudden, and started asking if I could sleep in the extra room. He said that I should sleep in his bed with him, and he just wanted a hug, and I felt myself getting scared like a big worry.\n\nThe only other time I fell asleep next to a boy with a toy (apart from the Sailor), I woke to find him playing with it in the middle of the night. I was a little uncomfortable - I was only eighteen at the time. He was my first friend. If I'd known any better I would have stopped playing with him.\n\nI remembered how confused I'd felt when another friend invited me on a trip to SC country, when I'd had no plans to even stay in his house and I'd gone to sleep fully dressed. And yet in the morning he had me playing anyway, because I got excited ...\n\nI ran into the spare room, sat down on the bed and began to cry. There was no lock on the door so I retreated into the small bathroom and locked myself in, then sent a few messages because I hadn't told anyone where I'd be that night, then I washed my face, let myself out and climbed under the blanket. I wedged the broom under the door handle.\n\nIn the morning my alarm woke me up and I went downstairs to the kitchen where he said hello as if nothing had happened. Which I suppose it hadn't, for him. There was a slightly strange quiet, with him singing, and me feeling in my tummy that things had taken a wrong turn, and that maybe we'd never fix it, and what a pity that was. He gave me a lot of toast and we sat in the living room in front of the morning TV. As we ate, I told him how I felt the night before.\n\nHe was okay with it. I think he understood. But he also thought that it's normal for a Rugby Boy to drink a lot. His friends do it too. He said the silliest thing they did was take off their clothes, but mostly they just slept. And yes, I also drink, but I don't think I would surprise anyone by dancing on the tables. I said that the only time I did something wrong to boyfriends was when I drank a lot, and he seemed a bit worried. He also said that he comes from a very safe place, and maybe he doesn't spend a lot of time with girls to think about the safety things we have to think about all the time.\n\nI'm happy I spoke up, and I don't feel bad about my night in the extra room, even if the morning time on the couch with him made me want something. Rule number one: take time to know these boys. It will be good. And he told me he won't drink next time I come to stay.\n\n_A special Saturday_\n\nAdam never really stopped sending messages, but we haven't had a lot of time for phone talks until today. Adam wants me to join him at a fun event in BI town. He thinks it will be good for me. I am not sure. I need to think about it. Also, my doctor has scheduled me for an important check-up on my knee around the same time, which might affect my mood for the event.\n\n_Early February_\n\nWas I talking about taking my time? Rugby Boy was calm when he picked me up at the place where the train stops, and calm all night, but it took about a little while from closing the front door to us both being silly in front of the fire, and me serving him a sip of the bubbly apple juice he'd just poured for me. I can't say I was fully unaware of what was happening.\n\nHe liked the apple juice, and I was glad I'd thought of it because there was something strange happening, which made me a little sad because I'd made sure I was clean, and it didn't seem that he had. The rest was good: he was nice to me and showed affection, the way I like it, until I was so excited I couldn't wait, but I caught a look on his face that made me realize he was thinking about not doing something important, and I must have looked scared. That was another sad moment.\n\nHe was a good friend for someone not that tall - haha! I felt really happy too. I liked how strong he was, and he could play for a long time. I was very happy when we were playing a fun game together. \n\nAfter the game, we sat around and told jokes to each other. Early in the morning, we played another fun game, and then it took me a long time to get home by bus and train.\n\nNow I'm half-watching cartoons, half-drawing, and feeling too tired to get ready for school, wondering why I feel a little bit sad. I think it happened too quickly. I like him, but does he think I'm his best friend now? Do I want that? No. I can't see myself waiting for him to come home from his playdates every week - why can't he just have one playdate a week, instead of all or none? But I don't have to be best friends with him if I am still keeping my options open until someone asks to be best friends and I say yes, so why am I feeling sad?\n\nI think I might still be scared to let go and be best friends with someone. We are not seeing each other tomorrow even though we planned to, and it makes me feel better because I need to think. I just want to avoid it now. Am I changeable or just scared?\n\n_One day in mid-February_\n\nI met a truly wonderful boy. He's very smart, well-educated, interesting and good at speaking, attractive, brave and yet caring. He knows about my lifestyle of making lots of friends and seems to like it, and I've found myself sharing many secrets and deep thoughts even though we haven't become best friends yet. But it will happen soon, I promise!\n\nAnother friend from the internet. I think making lots of friends is part of the whole idea of making friends on the internet - as soon as you sign in, there are always so many choices, and lots of boys who like your profile message you all at once. You can't possibly be 'loyal' to just one after a couple of messages, so meeting them all and getting to know them at the same time is the only way to go.\n\nIf five people message you, you're not really going to ignore the other four messages just because you thought the first one sounded nice.\n\nYou're not going to say no to meeting friend three if meetings with friend one and two were great but it's too early to tell if you'd still like either of them when they're much older. And if friend four is really attractive and makes you excited, you should remember that you're not best friends with friend one-three and thus still free to meet others. Imagine, for some reason, you wake up not very happy, but you still have a fun day five to look forward to!\n\nThis new friend had been sending emails back and forth with me since before I met with Soccer Boy; he was busy with his school homework but now he had finally finished it and was ready to play. As I saw him walk towards me with his blond hair and pink sweater I thought, 'You are so funny; what are you doing here?' He'd brought me a picture book because of something I'd said in an email, and as we talked over lunch in a small little place I know, I found myself liking him even though he was a bit strange, and he shared a bit about best friends and similar topics.\n\nI gave him some of my drawings on the second playdate and by the end of that day he'd invited me to go sledding with him and a group of friends, even offering to teach me how (what a silly guy), although I had to say no because of course it's the same week when there's a big school project to finish.\n\nThe thing is we're only a few playdates in and I know that if he brought a former friend instead of me I'd feel upset; so here I am, my feelings all mixed up already, feeling bad because I'm still playing with Soccer Boy and I want to be a good friend to this new guy, who I'll call Sweater Boy because of his pastel sweaters. And Sweater Boy has told me he doesn't mind if I have other friends, which, strangely, makes me want to do the opposite.\n\nHis job takes him to far places for a long time, so he can't be a constant friend. But I think about stopping to see Rugby Boy now, even though being with him is fun, the time together is good and we still haven't tried out being in his parents' warm room. It would be silly to keep seeing him just because, and I know he's not 'the special one' - but Cameron could be.\n\nThe way he writes makes me happy. He first kissed me, unexpectedly, over a fruity drink at a big hotel. It felt like a friend making a surprising move, but he couldn't stop touching me when we shared a break (tea and hot chocolate on me) on a special love day, and his touches felt nice in public, so think about what they'd be like in the quiet of my room ... . . He walked me back to work afterwards and that's when we talked about the 'no feeling bad' thing, maybe a bit too soon but I think we both know this friendship has a lot of promise. But I always think that when I meet someone, don't I?\n\nI'm supposed to see Rugby tonight but I'm still a bit tired and have a cold, and I'm seeing Cameron tomorrow, which makes it all seem unimportant. Decided not to go to the big city with Charlotte after all.\n\n_A special day in February_\n\nWould you hold my hand if you knew where it had been?\n\nI spent last night with Cameron.\n\nIt was really special. So different. Unbelievable. Like the difference between playing a game and sharing a tender moment, then completely being with each other in the early morning to the songs of birds.\n\nAt the movie, he gently touched and kissed my hands, which seemed very close, even more so because I knew those hands had been playing with Rugby Boy (yes, I did go see him on Thursday) just a day before. I surprise myself sometimes! But it's also exciting somehow, even though I was almost thinking I'd 'let down' Cameron, because I wouldn't mind if he'd kissed another girl somewhere in the big city while I was having fun with Rugby Boy.\n\nWe didn't even kiss last night - I wanted to take it slow and he understood - just spent a long time relaxing each other when we got back to his home, got comfortable bit by bit and then he was really nice to me. I helped him feel relaxed, but for some reason couldn't relax myself, maybe because I was a bit nervous about being with one friend so soon after another. We woke up this morning, him in his PJs and me in his T-shirt, happy, sleepy and ready for the day and smiling at his face, which looks like a cheeky angel's. It was so tempting - so the best-made plans changed and we played, because I couldn't wait and I was very excited from the night before.\n\nIn a way I wish we'd taken our time, but not with real regret - only because then I could still be excited about it. He's going skiing tomorrow for a week so I'll just have to find some other way to pass the time and pretend I'm not counting the days until he comes back.\n\nCharlie phoned and we had a nice chat. He invited me up to SC country, and I told him I'd think about it. Funny thing is, for the first time in a year I don't want any more friends. Cameron has shown me a lot of new things. I told Charlie that if I came it'd be as a just a friend, but I don't think he believed me. I told him I was leaving Ryan but couldn't tell him about Cameron, as that seemed too special.\n\nWhat does Charlie want, anyway? A fun weekend? A deep and meaningful weekend? A long-distance phone friend? Me to play Mrs Robinson to his Benjamin? I quite like him but he's so young - four years younger than me, though more grown-up than many men - and he lives in another country, for goodness' sake.\n\nCameron called from his winter holiday and said he missed me.\n\n_On a Sunday_\n\nI was out all night with my friend from CO country and his friends. We had fun until I ended up in CO friend's room, wearing one of his comfy clothes because it was very cold. We cuddled all night without even sharing a small kiss. He was sleeping, but kept pulling me closer. In the morning, I made tea and we had a good breakfast while reading some morning books before walking over to a nearby market.\n\nCameron messaged to say he was back just as we were going into a show, and when I came out he'd already planned to see a friend. We spoke briefly but it ended abruptly because of poor connection, and he messaged me later to check if I was upset, suggesting we could meet up later. I replied that I'd had hardly any sleep in a very cold room and was a little sad too, but he should have fun and I'll call him tomorrow.\n\nI shouldn't feel this sad so soon, but even though it's only been a few days I feel like there's some space between us, and I'm eager to make it smaller. We'll see each other soon.\n\n_Early this week_\n\nTired. Long, bad day at work. That project came back with a note saying it needed more work, and I didn't leave until late and I had to cancel another meeting I'd been hoping to go to, quietly. I was not nice on the phone to poor Cameron, who was only trying to be nice, and then I made the mistake of opening my bill and started to cry.\n\nIf I could just go from here to Cameron's I would, but I think I'll stay in with some warm milk and honey and look at a blog or two ... . .\n\n_Middle of the week_\n\nSweet meeting with Cameron in his big white bed.\n\nActually, we started out in the kitchen after drinks at the place where people go to drink with his friends. He lifted me up on the counter and we kissed and found our way into each other's clothes, then moved into his bedroom for a more comfortable place. I started teasing him about a book I'd found on his shelves that looked like one of the fun novels I read as a kid, and he told me he had some much funnier stuff, and went to get them from his study.\n\nOne was a book by Nora - a collection of fun stories - and the other was a picture book about play from a group which was very interesting. I looked at the pictures of girls in short dresses being silly, and felt excited. As I turned the pages of the book, my friend Cameron joined me. Suddenly, I lost the book over the side of the bed. Then Cameron went into the bathroom, and I followed him to wash up.\n\nAfterwards, I found more of the illustrated stories. One was about a lady who goes to a place and ends up meeting a chubby man who takes her to a restaurant. She wore nothing but pretty shoes, and the cooks played games with her using vegetables. Then she has to drink strange tea. It made me laugh a lot. The second was about a naughty girl who visits her family in the countryside and sees the helpers play and giggle, then gets taken by dirty, silly pirates. I think I might need a copy or two of my own.\n\nCameron likes to pretend we're playing a game. He actually prepared us both for the game, telling me he loved the look of my surprised face, and I was soooooo excited.He hugged me and we were happy. In the morning, we played again, first calmly and gently, then a bit more lively. It was a good way to start the day.\n\n_On a sunny day_\n\nAdam gave me a toy ring. And I don't mean a toy phone.\n\nWe went to a pizza place early in the evening and he told me about a yard sale he'd been to in BE town where some of the stuff was 'actually quite fun'. He handed a little box to me. I realized what it was as soon as I held it, and his shy smile told me the rest: yes, it was a toy ring, but not a 'big deal' toy ring. It's beautiful. Some sort of shiny plastic with gold dust flecked in it. I've never seen anything like it.\n\nI've seen him every day since our welcome-home play, and last night after the puppet show he asked if I wanted to go back to his place and I said no because I have to stop being so play dazzled at school. Plus how was I supposed to have other friends if I saw him all the time? Heh.\n\n_On a rainy day_\n\nWhy does it feel silly to play a little when Adam is happy about the multi-friendship thing? Ah well, it's a little fun in life.\n\nI was at a fun place with my friends (Adam doesn't like fun places - he thinks they're not nice) and some silly guys from the other table kept giving us fruity drinks. We were all moving to the music and this guy with light brown hair came out of nowhere and started dancing with me, twirling me around, lifting me up ... . . I felt like a character in a famous movie.\n\nWe talked a bit during a slow song and I found out he was a bit goofy and very smart, and he could chat with me in different ways. We do the same kind of work, but he has his own job. Dancing guy. Things got a bit exciting and I gave him a kiss amidst all the music and fun.\n\nHe sent me a message this morning to say he was off sliding on snow (does everyone in the big city except me do this?) and we said we'd dance more when he comes back. He has a fancy event to attend, and wants me to join him. How wonderful!\n\n_Early March Thursday_\n\nLast night, Adam and I had too much fruity drink and he called me his girlfriend for the first time while talking to his sister on the phone, his friend was there too. Later we danced really fast in his kitchen and then got a bit too close in his work room without washing off the sweat first (oh no!). We just played a lot, moving everything off the couch - his laptop, books, papers - and then we were as playful as bunnies.\n\nWhen we returned to the kitchen, we found out that his roommate had quietly disappeared and we moved the fun to Adam's bed. I gave him a cheerful start to keep the fun going, but we were both still feeling silly and more free than anything we'd done before. I'd never played with him while we were silly, whispering silly, lovely things in my ear, getting ready for more fun, flipping me on my stomach and tickling me, till I told him to go ahead and carry on with the fun. It didn't work in the blur and clumsiness - maybe another time, slower perhaps - but I was a little surprised at myself. I've never wanted it before.\n\nI was very happy after he tickled me for a while and he continued, me not wanting him to stop and feeling so close to him. He really does look like a nice person, even if we do the silliest things. I caught him by the neck and pulled him close, and asked in a low voice if he wanted me to tickle him, and he asked me if I'd done it before. Once or twice ... . . I didn't realize till I saw him looking both surprised and silly that I'd just started a new game, although I made him laugh a lot.\n\nAs we fell asleep, we spoke with happiness. He shared one of the names he wants to use for his future children and I liked it. Whenever I start to really like a boy, I think about how good of a dad he would be, and what our children would look like. This must be a natural feeling. Also, if I want to have a family before I get too old, I need to find a boy who wants the same. Since I found out about a health problem when I was young, I know that I need to hurry if I want to have children. But, this isn't something I talk about a lot.\n\nCameron took me to school and we got lost. You can't argue with a boy who's driving unless you know the way, so I was late. But, I wasn't upset or bothered by his hurry. I walked into the school with a big smile. This usually happens when I wake up with Cameron. My teacher didn't notice. I wonder what he would have said if he did notice? And what would I have told him? I could make him blush.\n\nI got a phone call from BB earlier today. Talk about an old memory. He asked why I hadn't talked, and I asked, why didn't you? But that was the only tough part. We had a nice talk about the night class and he asked, in his tricky, round way, what I was doing. I told him I was with someone, and he was his usual mysterious self - he's never really asked me to hang out directly, too cool or too shy or both. We said we'd talk again and it was nice despite the strange feel. I still think of his silly face and his big, strong body, but then I remember the quiet times and the oddness, and I think about Cameron instead.\n\nSpeaking of, he's going on a trip for two weeks soon, just as I was getting cozy, although he said I could go too if I want. Great idea, as it's somewhere warm and special!\n\n_Early in the year_\n\nI think I need help.\n\nI decided to cut my hair for Cameron this morning.\n\nNot a good idea.\n\nI always keep it short and neat - no hairs showing on the side and so on - but this time I decided to use the electric cutter I bought long ago and never used and do the complete job. I'd charged up the cutter all night ready for action on my hair and after my bath I started with energy, thinking it would be quick and I wouldn't be late for school. Right.\n\nI had done a neat little haircut and was feeling quite proud of myself. It looked so much better than using little scissors. But then, I got too excited and OUCH, I nicked myself a little. There were small drops of red in the bathwater... it looked like a tiny toy animal had hurt itself in there. Yuck. And of course, I didn't have any band-aids.\n\nStill, when I was done, I was looking pretty well-groomed. The bleeding had stopped, though I was late to school because I had to make up a silly story about the school bus (more like a jungle, right?). Then, I checked my messages and there was a note from 'Cameron' saying he couldn't go on the field trip with me after all.\n\nSuddenly, I was feeling scared and upset, my skin prickling with worry (or maybe just to make up for my fresh haircut, who knows?) I was looking forward to those two weeks and had found some bus tickets that weren't too pricey. I'd almost managed to get the time off from school at the last minute, and it would have been a good opportunity to either strengthen our friendship or gently, kindly say goodbye. So emotional, so well-groomed, so in over my head if I'm not careful.\n\nI sent a message to David to see what he was doing for the next few days. When the cat is not there... . .\n\n_On a sunny Saturday_\n\nSoft clothes make me sad, and I don't know why.\n\nIs it me or do I find myself looking at him when we're together and wondering if he's really thinking about our talk, or if he's letting his thoughts go somewhere else? Maybe I just want too much attention; maybe I should stop thinking so much about love. Who knows. Something about him talking about the possibility of the work trip then not doing it makes me think of Peter, and I don't like it. Once I spent a long time looking for cheap trips because Peter said he wanted to take me to see his brother in another country for the holiday, then it didn't happen and I took him home to meet my parents, only for him to leave early and go back to the big city for 'work' - or spending the New Year's Eve with his old friend.\n\nIt might just all be in my head, but it's happening so much that I'm wondering if I really have moved on from Peter.\n\nWhen David's phone beeps with another message and he looks at it, I think of Peter and his old friend and how they tricked me.\n\nWhen David looks like he is thinking about something else I think of the lonely feeling I had when, without me knowing, Peter was daydreaming about his old friend.\n\nWhen Adam tells me it will be smarter for me to stay here and get better from my knee problem near my doctor than to go to a warm beach with him, I think of the reasons Peter made up to run away to SP country with his old friend.\n\nWhen Adam says I 'won't want to go to the party. Lots of boring people, yada yada yada' after he asked me to come to said party and I've waited on Friday night for him to tell me where it is, it reminds me how Peter used to have too much fun with his friends under the pretense of a 'meeting' or 'celebrating a new baby'.\n\nJust who am I not trusting here? Myself? Adam? Or Peter?\n\nI'm not going to find out this time. I don't want to know.\n\nI miss the scent of Adam though. Right now.\n\n_A day in March_\n\nI have to go to the hospital soon. Feeling scared and alone. Hoping my forgetful friend won't forget to pick me up after the operation. Adam didn't offer to do it, although his reasons didn't sound right: 'the traffic fee' (not in the evening) and 'it's too far away' (thirty minutes at most?)\n\nSee if I care if he goes back to his 'she'll always be special to me and I'd marry her if she didn't have so much debt' old friend in NE city because she's won the prize or invented a quiet toy and paid off all her debts. Charlotte's caring, Cameron's my buddy, and there's David for promise. I'll be just fine, thank you.\n\nWhy do I find it hard to follow my own rules and not get emotionally caught when the entire world is my playground? Didn't I want a buddy who'd be okay with me having other friends? Yet, what do I do when I first sense that this could be more than just playing around - I become all faithful to him, leave Frank, sit waiting for a call and can't even convince another friend to help me get home from the hospital.\n\nMaybe all Adam's talk of friends connecting, meetings in other lives, and becoming your best self doesn't make up for the fact that I need someone a bit more practical in my life right now. What good is it to know that I might have liked him in another life, when in this life I am about to be left alone in the hospital?\n\nOne day in mid-March.\n\nPoor Charlotte. I am not very nice. My housemate didn't forget to come and pick me up when I woke up from sleep, but as soon as we got home she left to see a friend and I was all alone with a list of rules from the hospital which said I shouldn't be alone for at least one whole day. I'm not even allowed to make tea. No sight of Cameron, who understood I'd be sleepy and walking slowly.\n\nThen Charlie rang and asked how I was feeling and I started crying, as if the sleep medicine had made my feelings bare and only pure worry was left. He laughed at me in a kind way, and made me feel better with a silly tale about how he couldn't get his new hot drink maker to work, which made me laugh instead. I felt so at ease that I told Charlie that I'd wished the boy I'd been meeting would collect me from the clinic and look after me, and there was a sharp gasp. Then Charlie said, 'I'm surprised you're still with him.'\n\nHe thought I'd meant the boy who played catch.\n\n'Um no, not that one. He had to leave, a long time ago. Someone else.'\n\nYou could have made frozen sweet from my ear, so chilly was the feeling coming from my phone.\n\nI. Am. Such. A mean person.\n\nCharlie ended our chat quickly and said he had to leave, and I tried to wrap things up nicely, as the poor boy had had to go out and buy more talk time for his mobile to speak to me. But, hey, should I have lied to him? I don't want to cause him pain but I'm not going to mislead him either; he doesn't seem to understand that just because I'm alone, i.e. Being single, doesn't mean I'm not friends with someone.\n\nThat's probably that with Cameron. If nothing else, at least he got fit in the process after joining a fun place to do exercises to make me happy, and he'll be ready to make friends with some nice girl who doesn't want to get too close yet.\n\nCharlotte will be visiting later. We'll see.\n\n_Early in the morning_\n\nToday's meal for the friend who is getting better is tomato sauce, little salty eggs and pasta, just because. Bathing was hard enough - I should capture myself moving around the bathroom and trying to keep one leg dry then share it on a video website, it's that silly.\n\nCharlotte did visit yesterday, and I decided to forget the fact that she hadn't offered to come and take me home from the hospital. It turned into a long and interesting talk about 'us' and this very strong friendship we seem to have made in just a few weeks. And to say goodbye, although it's see you later, not farewell.\n\nShe will be gone on work for most of this time which will give me some space to, I dunno, get that new job I said I would before I got distracted by her toy, and to meet other kids. She said if I had any adventures she'd want me to tell her all the stories. I told her I wouldn't be able to share the same - because of a story about a boy with a long nose. I think we'll wait and see. I'm more likely to feel hurt in my heart than hurt in my body.\n\nHe also talked a bit more about not coming to get me from the doctor's office - he is very scared of these places after his mommy passed away. He says that after going to boarding school at eight he has some big feelings of being left alone, and it's because of that he doesn't make big friendships. That's okay. I feel bad for him, but I shouldn't feel bad about myself because, despite all that, he really likes spending time with me.\n\nSo how do I keep this friend when we're in different places in the world and the things that keep us close are lighter than a wedding ring or a promise? Keep him happy like a funny storyteller? Send him pictures of my cat? Write him nice poems and wear that pretty ring all the time?\n\nThe talk turned into a kiss, and a gentle, quiet hug which sort of involved one of my toys until the movie (which I'd put on to make a noise for my friend in the house) stopped and I turned off the toy. He really wanted to make me happy which made me a little shy, so I couldn't be, then he hugged me and I cried a little because I was so happy, and snuggled into the soft blue shoulder which smells so nice.\n\nHappy girl.\n\n**The Game**\n\nOne spring\n\n_One Saturday_\n\nThe party was fantastic! It was a great way to forget about Charlotte's leaving.\n\nI waited for David at the train station, trying not to worry too much about the bandages on my knee, and wondering if I'd know him without any glasses, but I didn't need to worry. I wasn't sad when I saw him walking with difficulty towards me - he'd hurt himself doing a winter sport so we were quite a pair - I felt lucky to have him with me, even if we both needed support. He seemed more quiet than I remembered, but he is very handsome: light colored skin and mysterious eyes like a plane driver, curly hair and fancy voice like Charlotte, tall like a fast car boy.\n\nWe slowly walked to the place and I liked the feeling immediately. Even if the food was okay and the people working there were sleeping, the juice was nice to drink while we watched everyone show their fancy clothes on the dancing floor.\n\nAfter a while we danced slowly together for a couple of dances before going back to our table to watch two dances by orange-looking professionals who despite their strange skin color were like a famous dance movie combined. David really likes dancing, he used to be in competitions until a year ago, and he showed me some videos he had on his phone of some of his dances. Alright, so that's a bit smart, but the boy can really dance.\n\nI told him I hoped I wasn't making him uncomfortable, which was a joke because I know that without my difficulty I'd be a better dancer than at least some of the people in that room, even though I haven't danced like that since I was at school.\n\nHe was great fun to be with and we had more in common than I'd thought.\n\nHe kept looking into my eyes without being distracted, and I took that as a nice thing.\n\nThere's definitely some connection, and we seem to think alike. We talked about love a little, which made me sure that he's an understanding sort - important for keeping up with my lifestyle of seeing many friends. He speaks three languages, two of which are also mine, is about to get a house, and shares the same birthday sign as some special men in my life - the ones I've always liked, but haven't been able to be with due to things out of my control. Maybe this time, I hope?\n\nI was so happy with the juice, the dancing and his eyes that I gave him a sudden kiss on the cheek as we sat there, and he put his arm round me and held my hand, a bit loosely. We kissed when we were dancing. The only strange thing is that he won't tell me his last name. Is he worried I'll look him up? Is it awkward?\n\nOn the way home, I asked one of his friends about him, so I could 'find him if I needed to', which made them both laugh nervously. Then they wouldn't tell me. Boys!\n\nIt's strange that I haven't had time to recover from Adam yet, and here I am having a great time with a new friend.\n\n_On a Tuesday_\n\nMy try at having many friends isn't working with my need to always be with someone. I'm upset with Adam again. I introduced him to a friend who lives far away and she's told me she's met him, but he hasn't said anything to me except a quick 'thanks' and 'I'm out in NE city with some cool people' and that was days ago now.\n\nExpectations can upset you.\n\n_On a Friday_\n\nWent to look at some couches with David today, as you do when you've never even seen someone's house before. A bit odd. The sales people kept looking at me and asking too many questions about how big 'our' door was. David asked for my opinion, which I gave, even though I won't be living with this couch, but he didn't listen to me and bought an ugly leather one.\n\nWe had a nice evening out at a funny show on a Wednesday, talking so much that the people next to us told us to be quiet, and hugging so much on the couch in the club that my head got stuck between the cushions. Sweet, gentle kisses, his thin, sturdy body on top of mine ... . . I didn't want to take him home though - not yet - and he seemed upset. I could use a friend with a little patience in my life. Also, to get to school on time for once. I've managed it nearly every day since Charlie left, and have almost gone a week without my teacher saying something funny about 'the late ones'.\n\n_Weekend_\n\nIn a silly cleaning frenzy I removed every last hair from my poor doll, and I really don't like it. Some doll hair is more fitting. I think a story should be made on 'the right hair style for your doll type'. But I mean, where does it stop?\n\nI remember reading in my parents' book that you shouldn't cut your doll's hair because hair traps scents and your doll friend can sniff them and enjoy them. That was a time long ago. Different story now. Give 'em an inch of hair and they take it all!\n\nI was proud when I first got my doll's hair, about a year after everyone else in my class, then they started cutting, and so did I. Then it was legs. Now I tidy up my doll's hair, fix my doll's eyebrows, trim my doll's legs up to the knees, clean my doll's dress line, cut it all off . We breathe fast and laugh as I tell him he's covered in paint. We end the talk quickly. I switch off the small light and pull up my blanket.\n\nA short time reads the display on my phone.\n\n_A sunny day_\n\nI met a woman at the party who I thought was just very tall and thin. Then I noticed her large hands, deep voice and she mentioned a 'big change' she'd just made and I understood she used to be a boy. I didn't ask her about it, and just found her really nice, even if a bit shy.\n\nShe reminded me of a night when I was coming back from a party in a bad mood because I was being followed by someone I liked, but who had a friend. I was tired, alone and cold and leaning on the bus stop, waiting for the night bus.\n\nA car stopped driven by a big, balding guy who asked if I needed a ride. I said no, I had no coins. He asked where I was going and I told him, and he said if I got in he'd give me a ride. I was unsure, but too tired and something told me I could trust him.\n\nWe started talking and it turned out that he only drove a taxi in the evening and worked with computers during the day. I couldn't tell you how it all happened, but he suddenly told me he was a person who wanted to change more about his looks. He had already changed a lot about himself. Under his clothes, Victor was wearing something different, and he had a big chest hidden under a loose top. He showed me a bit of his outfit and said I could touch his chest - it was my only time seeing something not natural!\n\nHe said that people would often notice them, 'You have a big chest, friend!' Strange. He had made some changes in a faraway place, and he asked me for information about 'how girls do it' and how much to move your clothes when you go to the bathroom. He said he had to keep a small thing inside him at all times to keep the changes in place, and that the special medicine he was on made it hurt a little. I wasn't sure how that happened - don't you need a certain part to have that happen?\n\nHe was friends with a man who didn't like him as much after the changes, which I suppose could happen, and so here he was, sad because of the new medicine, not happy with his love life, working two jobs and with a friend who didn't help him. I hoped the boys in the work place didn't make fun of him. He was the nicest person.\n\nI left that car feeling happy that I liked the way I looked, and with being a girl.\n\n_Early in the week_\n\nCameron returns from SA country today. He has a little bit of time to meet me before I leave for a little journey. I'm trying not to watch the time too much.\n\nHeard from a friend that Rachel doesn't feel bad about what happened between us, so I'm going to feel okay and look forward.\n\nMy cat has been feeling neglected. I find myself sitting on the bus feeling a little uncomfortable, like when you need to scratch an itch or before you sneeze. \n\nThe other day I was taking a shower and felt a little unwell, and when I checked, I found something strange. Why are things sometimes so weird?\n\n_Next day_\n\nThinking of Victoria reminded me of some silly games I played with my Sweet Friend, whom I knew before I met my friend Patrick. I tried playing dress up with him once - he had such lovely lips that looked nice with my lip gloss, and a small waist that fitted perfectly into my pretty skirt. We even had the same shoe size, so I could fit his feet into my fancy boots. I added a hairpiece, a top filled with tissues and quick face painting. Although I can't remember any pretend play, we both got really excited. It felt different but strange and I got covered in lip color. The hairpiece didn't last. Then we realized that his feet had become bigger and warm in the boots and we couldn't get them off. I was pulling hard, worried that my friend would come back. He had to walk slowly into my room and wait for his feet to get normal so we could take them off. By that time the fun feeling had disappeared.\n\n_Early April_\n\nNo message from Cameron, just a short, late email saying he was tired and had been busy all day. I did tell him that if we didn't see each other now, I'd be gone, and then he'd be gone and that'll be it until the autumn. Did he forget or does this work for him? Am I losing him all of a sudden? Why?\n\nHad a good time at a singing place with David, with lots of kisses like happy kids. I like his confidence now, and his thinness. The only problem was that he didn't bring any money and asked me to buy the drinks. This was strange because he could have passed many places to get money on his bike ride. We ate dinner in a supermarket. Maybe he used all his money on that couch?\n\nReady for a work trip. No stories for a few days, unless Cameron shows up at my hotel room, wearing just a warm sweater, and surprises me.\n\n_Early Tuesday_\n\nBack in the big city. Cameron planned a lunch date today, but I didn't hear from him by midday. I called from a bookstore where I was looking around to pass the time and he picked up after many rings, sounding sick: a tummy ache. We both sounded unhappy during our talk. He even seemed unhappy about his visit to a tropical place with colorful birds, blue sea, and different food (sounds better than spring in the big city, right?) and I wondered why he was so upset and if it had something to do with his old girlfriend in NE city.\n\n_Him_ : 'I don't feel good.'\n\n_Me_ : 'Why didn't you call me?'\n\n_Him_ : 'I was sleeping but I'm coming into the city later.'\n\n_Me_ : 'I'm hungry and you won't be able to eat.'\n\n_Him_ : 'When do you stop playing tomorrow?'\n\n_Me_ : 'Late.'\n\n_Him_ : 'Well, VE town's far from me.'\n\n_Me_ : 'Bye then.'\n\n_Him_ : 'Bye.'\n\nI closed my phone and left the store feeling sad and not wanted, right into a very cold shower. Looks like spring's not the best time for fishnet after all. There was no one else I could invite for lunch; they were all busy or on a trip. I sent a text to Cameron to offer to get the things he was supposed to get in the city if he was not feeling well, and then felt silly.\n\nHe replied to thank me but explained that his company wouldn't allow me to do that for safety reasons so now it's two weeks until I see him. I shouldn't worry - I've got two playdates with Dance Boy after all - but the problem is I miss him. I care more than I should. I want to wake up next to him. I want to tear up the book I got for him and cry. I want to eat a chocolate bunny and feel better.\n\nFun, good-for-making-friends party tonight with Dance Boy. Better cheer up and get ready to have fun.\n\n_A sunny day in spring_\n\nI messaged Cameron saying I could visit his home tonight to take care of him - with chicken soup and a nurse's outfit if needed. But he texted back, 'Sounds good but it's not possible, busy with getting things ready and leaving early in the morning. Let's meet later this month.' Huh? I looked at the gift I'd gotten for him, all wrapped in shiny paper, next to my clothes and toothbrush, ready to go.\n\nI tried not to feel sad on the bus and not to think of him, but it was as hard as trying not to think of a big pink animal. Your mind wanders and suddenly, there it is: a big pink animal. I didn't respond to his message until after my job when I finally sent one back: 'Okay.'\n\nIs it wrong to feel so hurt being kept away? He's the one who thought of the snow trip, who invited me to come with him on a work trip, who sent me long messages talking about me, who used words like 'love' and 'wedding' and 'best friends', who told me his favourite possible name for a baby ... . . Am I misunderstanding something here?\n\nHe did send an email saying sorry but I told him I couldn't deal with this on-again, off-again behaviour. Then I called my mom and almost cried on the phone. The saddest part is, David doesn't make me feel better after our friendly get-together last night.\n\nI was late because our water supply at home stopped working when I was washing my hair. Then, I decided to wear my new 'chest enhancers' which are just like soft toys that you stick under your real chest, but they kept moving around as I walked and it looked like I had four chests. That's why I was very late.\n\nWhen I finally reached the party (with just two chests), I met Dance Boy. He introduced me to some people but didn't give me a drink (he didn't have one either). I spent some of my money on a small cup of juice and talked to lots of people, while watching Dance talk to an IT country photographer's girlfriend. I wonder what he tells people about me? Girlfriend? Friend? Person who just keeps walking with him?\n\nI started the hugging with him, and there was no dancing, so we left the boring talk and stood by a window, just looking at the LO city view, him hugging me from behind. No more silly kisses.\n\nWhen we left he said we should eat something and I suggested a cheap, nice place close by that's a local secret. He didn't like it, and the MO country next to it, and we went back to LE Square where he took me to a Burger King. I was all dressed up, so I teased him about living like a student. He didn't like it. I felt him upset under his warm sweater and he let go of my arm, and mumbled something about 'look who's talking'.\n\nOK, so I'm not working a lot just now, but I will be, and he's never even seen my home, and there I am by his side in a fancy dress and shoes and he's pushing a bike and fixing his sweater.\n\nWe ended up in a food place where I was the most dressed up thing apart from the week-old salad. He counted out his share of the dinner in coins onto the table, and I paid for my own old food.\n\nSomehow, Cameron hasn't lost all his charm.\n\n_Early Saturday_\n\nA cold day with David. We went to a concert in a place where I happen to know that Cameron's mother got married (purple animal, purple animal); I bought the tickets but he made no offer to share the cost, perhaps because he was thinking about the cost of the dance. Afterwards we went to a nearby place with friends and everyone took so long to decide what to drink that I just got something for myself, only to return to my spot and David saying he'd asked for a drink and I owed him a drink. He warmed up a bit after he had a juice, and we shared a little smooch before he rode off on his bike.\n\nI am starting to think something strange here. He surely makes enough to pay for himself (and for me, if he wished to) if his cool company website is to be believed. So why does every juice feel like a big deal?\n\nI'd rename him Thrifty Boy if I hadn't already given that name to a man who likes to stop women near William Street station and ask them about their socks. He always says he's a sock designer, and the questions get more and more detailed if you're silly enough to answer: 'Do you wear socks with no shoes?' 'Are you interested in a new sock design with built-in shoes?' I was so naive that I actually waited for him to come back with his 'new design' for ten minutes before I realized I'd been tricked. He once surprised a friend when she was in the restroom in a nearby cafe and we told the police.\n\nSpeaking of strange people, I ended up sending Cameron a note that would make his imaginary rabbits tremble in their fluffy boots, expecting to be thrown into warm water: missing him badly, thought of him all night on a date, silly stuff like that.\n\nNo answer.\n\n_One sunny day_\n\nI was only gone for a bit to do some work and the plant my friend says she likes was losing its leaves. There was dust on the kitchen floor, grease in the sink, fluff on the carpet, full trash cans. I cleaned most of it in five minutes, but when I said this morning that she might clean the hall carpet, she started right away and the noise was very loud. Was she being quick or was she upset?\n\nI don't know what it'll be like when I get back from my trip to CA country with Adam. He goes every year to chat with his friends and I go too to watch a lot of movies, get some sun and have fun. Sometimes I get some writing work for a fun website while I'm there, although the stars are only a small part of the fun, and even if you don't get to go to a big movie every night, there's a lot of fun to be had. A group of photographers, helpers, writers, people who promote things, people who help with films, people who deliver things, people who help with money, people who do hair, models, people who work at a game place, people who work on boats, people who clean, people who serve food, people who want to be actors, young actresses and writers come every year to work for the movie event and meet new people, sneak into big parties, drink a lot and sell their story/movie/body/art. I've made a lot of friends and I want to see what they've been doing. It feels like a summer holiday and a fairy-tale land. You live on little fancy foods and fancy drinks, and go from movie to boat to beach party to someone's home. You make friends and have fun.\n\nIt's different from getting paper and cleaning my boss's clothes. This year, I'm very, very excited to go.\n\n_Early Morning_\n\nI almost left Dance Boy last night, but I'm glad I didn't. We watched a movie first and I bought drinks and snacks while he got the tickets. Then I said that I needed to get money before we went to the dance place we wanted to go to, but he didn't listen so I let it go. He bought a drink and then his phone rang and he talked for a long time without telling me who called him, giving me strange looks. I started talking to the two dance teachers who were there, and kept quiet instead of asking him what was going on. Anyway, he only said, 'It's your turn.' When I told him that I didn't have any money, he looked at me in a funny way, then got more drinks. He opened his eyes and asked if I wanted to play some more, and I thought about it for a bit then decided to go. I gave him a hug goodbye and we waved at the door, him in his pajamas still, and I rode my bike home in the nice spring air, smelling the scent from the cherry blossom trees.\n\nOh, the fun of having a friend who lives close to home. Someone with the softest hands, the most interesting eyes, and the sudden excitement.\n\n_Early Tuesday_\n\nMessages:\n\n_Me_ : 'You left a mark on my neck after all you silly!'\n\n_David_ : 'I like to play tricks on my friends.'\n\n_Me_ : 'Haha!'\n\n_Charlotte_ : 'We'll play when I return, going to IT country's lakes.'\n\nNo kisses. I erased his number to avoid bothering him.\n\n_Benjamin_ : 'Running a race. Will you support me?'\n\n_Cameron_ : 'That girl I was friends with is playing with my room mate  '\n\n_Early Friday_\n\nCouldn't wait to leave work and eat some dinner, change into my favourite black dress and the tall shoes that look hard to walk in but are surprisingly comfy, then brush my hair. Not a playdate with one of my 'friends' but still fun. I was meeting Adam and his friend for a drink so he could give me his share for our apartment in CA city I'd booked online.\n\nHe likes to take me out for nice meals in good places, treat me with tasty drinks and listen to my stories - the sillier the better. Within two minutes of getting to the bar I had what Adam calls a 'special' drink in front of me (red, berries, you can't taste the juice) and we started talking about haircuts. Cameron had told me he liked 'clean' people, because 'hair traps smells' and I wanted to know what the guys thought about it. 'I have to cut mine,' Adam told me. 'They're black above my belly and grey like an old goat's beard below, so they really show how old I am.'\n\nThat funny picture made me giggle so much the special drink I'd drunk was in danger of spilling out.\n\n'This girl,' he told the worker, 'is my friend without the hugging.' 'Funny friends,' I added, and we clinked glasses. Then we took it in turns to try and make the worker blush by telling him about earlier trips to CA city. Like the party at some house which didn't have enough toilets, and I was so desperate that I hid in the bushes with my fancy dress lifted up, scared of being caught by the ex-army security guards and their big dogs who walked around the fence to keep out uninvited guests. Then I went back to the group and talked with Marilyn's old friend without cleaning my hands. Or the time Sophia did a silly thing to a man on a big boat, and he was surprised while the people from the FR country's TV group on a nearby boat who had recorded the whole event cheered. \n\nAt the end of the night, Adam opened his money holder and counted out the house money for me at the drink place, with the helpers giving us strange looks - easy to guess they thought we were buying and selling something! We all started laughing as he tried to hide and failed. I hadn't laughed so much in a long time, and felt much better about the clothes and dance problem.\n\n_On a Saturday_\n\nI think I should get paid for helping old school boys fit back into people. Emotionally confused boys helped, but only at a big cost to me! Not honest, not trusting, not nice, not good and still not caring of everyone who isn't part of their special group. Forget them.\n\nI'm thinking happily of my old friend, the caring, trustable, steady, understanding and emotionally ready Essex boy.\n\n_On a Monday_\n\nIs it a fun call if your fun shoes are never even in the same place, let alone bed? Or just a silly wet phone call leading to a silly wet dream?\n\nCharlotte called, asking what I was wearing. 'Black pants, green shirt, pink sweater .. . . ' 'Underwear?' 'No, white cotton underwear,' and then I got tired, said goodnight, took off all the clothes mentioned and quickly fell asleep.\n\nMaybe I should go to the SC country and see Charlotte instead of going on a vacation this summer. Someone just got into trouble there ... . .\n\n_Early in the morning_\n\nAdam emailed. I didn't reply.\n\nHe sent a message. I didn't reply.\n\nWaiting for the phone call now. I will not answer.\n\nDon't some boys love a bossy person?\n\nDo you think I'm one?\n\nLet's remember. Six weeks of fun times, then we had to go separate ways for a short time and now he seems not interested in meeting up.\n\nI emailed him a picture of my new hairstyle (no reply).\n\nI sent him a message to say I 'miss' him ... . . (no reply).\n\nI offer to be his helper (no, thank you).\n\nI email asking for a call, and get a message in response. He can meet me either Saturday morning or Monday morning (and what about the rest of the weekend?) I should call him if I want to chat (I don't, I want to see him in person), and he likes me and would like 'to know me as a friend'.\n\nNot. Good. Enough.\n\n_Early Morning_\n\nI'm not sure how to handle what just happened.\n\nI haven't had a lot of trouble from girl friends about my multi-friendship experiment, although they tend to be more careful about approving of it than the boys I know. Jessica thought I'd just get more upset. Samuel thought it was pretty harmless and good fun. The lady that shall be known as Bella? Well, I'd heard she was jealous, although there's nothing stopping her from doing her own experiments in friendship. She's just been let go by a far-away friend who's had enough of being led on, so why is she focusing on me, and what I'm doing, and more importantly, why was she hugging David in front of me?\n\nYesterday my friend Nora held a juice birthday brunch. I arrived at midday and started having juice, bread and coffee with Cameron and a crowd of friends. I'd invited David, and told him to bring a bottle - he doesn't know the birthday girl, so this would only be polite - but he didn't get there until we were all full. I opened the door to him in the middle of a lively game of 'Truth or Dare' and he hadn't brought so much as a can of juice.\n\nDuring the game I'd already shown everyone my doll, admitted that I'd fantasised about having a pet unicorn, and watched as a married woman told everyone her best moments came from a teddy bear, then had her husband wave a loose bit of paper at me, and in walked David, not missing a beat but launching himself straight into what was now just a game of dare with enthusiasm. Things went wrong from that moment.\n\nDavid and I acting silly and moving in a funny way.\n\nMe, Bella, and the woman who was married, pretending to kiss while sitting on the man's lap.\n\nCountry starting with \"CA\" boy pretending to dance for the girl having her birthday.\n\nA fun dance between my friend Sophia and Nora, who fell into a plant.\n\nMe pretending to dance on the door frame, sliding down to the floor and making a loud noise with a shoe in the empty bottles lined up for recycling.\n\nBella and I pretending to kiss on David's lap, David looking like he was very happy. She was good at pretending to kiss.\n\nSomeone dares David to pretend to kiss Bella for a long time. I think this is very funny and take many pictures. Bella tries to pull me into the pretend kiss; David says he likes to pretend to kiss her.\n\nMe pretending to blow a bottle while looking at David.\n\nNora asleep on the sofa with the boy from the \"CA\" country pretending to nuzzle her.\n\nDavid and Bella dancing, David pretending to look over at me, me bravely taking more pictures. I could feel the excitement between them but I didn't know if I was adding to it or just slowing it down. The game of 'Truth or Dare' was over, but they kept pretending to kiss.\n\nI started to clean up the room. People left. Nora stood up to go to sleep and took CA country with her, and I got my coat and went out into the light rain to my waiting bike, not knowing what to think. David appeared and unlocked his bike, and together we walked Bella to the bus stop. They kissed again, and I hopped on my bike and rode off without a word, the rain soaking my clothes and running down my face.\n\nDavid caught up with me at the circle and I shouted that I was getting wet. He touched my bum, 'I like a wet bum,' and I laughed. He followed me home and as I stood there with water pooling in my shoes, short of breath, he asked to be let in to dry off. I made him some tea while he dried himself off with a towel. I didn't want to discuss what had happened because I couldn't afford to be jealous - we weren't friends, after all.\n\n'Bella said something funny to me,' he said. 'She asked: \"Are you one of Sophia's friends?- what did she mean?' So much for being loyal... I can't remember what I replied.\n\nHe stayed the night but we just slept.\n\nIn the morning he made me wet in the bath, ignored the toys I'd put out, threatened to tickle me then did nothing. I got up and made breakfast.\n\nI think he's as puzzled as I am. We joked a little as we ate, and then moved a bit to some tunes on his phone, me in just a simple dress. He was close to me but he was calm, even though we were very close and my dress was sticking to me. He played me a song from a famous drama about friendship, twice, then gave me a firm peck on the cheek and rode away on his bicycle. \n\nOne sunny day\n\nMessaged Cameron to wish him a safe journey. Silly, I know, and I should just be acting normal but I suddenly got worried and thought I should trust him more. He was always truthful, and he did have to go to a far away school when he was little. He sent a warm reply, saying sorry that he could only meet in the mornings - because of meal gatherings - and I guess I understand that things between us are a little tricky. I messaged to say that I can manage friendships and being far away from each other, but not not talking and sudden disinterest. Although I will keep messaging, won't I?\n\nMessaged Benjamin because I was bored at work. He's still resting from the big run (he did really well), and I got so excited just thinking about him that I wondered if I should sneak a little dance under my desk. The way was free, but I chose to use my mixed-up energy to work on my resume again and again.\n\n_Early Sunday_\n\nThe game finished. _The_ Game, I mean, the one I just realized I was part of. Now I get what that book on David's shelf was all about. I've been the test subject for the boy version of _The Rules_.\n\nDavid was busy all yesterday and I'd been enjoying the bright sun in the park with Lucy. David and I met up for dinner and food - nice talk, nice meal, but too much chat about dolls for my liking. Her birthday's on the same day as a girl he liked at school - oh, isn't that strange? We agreed to go back to my place to watch a new movie and he put his arm around me as we walked, although he was so rigid that he almost squeaked.\n\nHe quickly went back to the small shop to get some drink for himself and some juice for me after I gave him some money (he had no money left). Then we got onto my bed and I started the movie.\n\nI took his hand and it just lay there. _Nothing_. He moved so his hands were near my feet. I moved my toes, hoping for a foot rub. Nothing. I had taken off my little top while he was away, leaving my chest free under my light dress. He didn't notice. He removed his shirt 'because it was warm' and I gently touched his back, but he just watched the show, not making any sound. I felt unsure and stopped.\n\nWhen the TV show paused halfway, I quietly watched him instead of going to play the rest of the show. His nice face, greenish eyes, his curly hair, his half-dressed body next to mine. 'Go on, play the rest of the show. I'm really liking it now!' he said. So I did.\n\nWhen it ended late at night, he started talking about his phone battery being low, so I said, clearly, 'Don't worry. You can charge it later when you go home.' And he looked surprised when he realized that I didn't want him to stay. He went to the washroom, then came back and rested on my shoulder. I asked him if he was falling asleep and he answered, 'If you want me to,' so I moved so he almost fell and said, 'No, not really.'\n\nHe looked still confused. Suddenly he seemed more energetic and he held me tightly as if we were dancing, then gently laid me back on the bed and laid down on top of me. This was better. I began to giggle and playfully push against him. But then he stopped moving like someone had turned him off. He just lay there on top of me and asked if the dress was the fancy one I'd mentioned buying for a big event. 'Nope. This was cheap from a store.'\n\nHe started to tell me about a girl he liked at school and how he'd spent a night in her bed and nothing happened.\n\n'So she was just lying there next to you, really wanting something to happen?'\n\n'No,' he answered, and I could tell he hadn't thought about that. 'It was okay.'\n\nAnd then, my friends, he started asking why I hadn't let him into my house on the first few dates, and why I'd waited so long. Was I playing some kind of game?\n\nI answered that a girl could have many reasons for not rushing things. I didn't say that I'd been thinking about another boy, that I'd been unwell, that I'd been getting better from a hurt knee, wasn't sure how much I liked him, didn't want to wake my friend... .\n\nWe talked a little about how it was strange we could dance as if we had a deep relationship, and he admitted that when we first met he thought that would happen, and there I was thinking, 'But it still might! Once upon a time, my friend was still laying next to me, not moving. I began to think:\n\n  * He kissed Bella right in front of me, while looking at me, then he pushed me away.\n\n  * He could lay on top of me just now, and nothing happened. Not even a little tickle.\n\n  * He plans to stay for breakfast even though he didn't tie me to the bed.\n\n  * He talks about other girls all the time.\n\n  * He said he was okay with me hugging him but he didn't hug back.\n\nAnd, oh dear -\n\n  * I was without my clothes in his arms during the holiday and touched his tummy, but he didn't touch lower than my tummy.\n\nI pushed him away from me, feeling mad, and said as calmly as I could: 'Please go.' I looked away so he wouldn't see me start to cry. I'm not just a place to sleep. 'What's going on?' he asked. 'Why are you sad?'\n\nI couldn't hold back my feelings any more and started to cry.\n\n'I have spent a long time laying next to someone who was thinking about another person the whole time. I don't need this,' I shouted, ran out of the room and locked myself in the washroom to cry a lot. It was late at night. Oh no. I hoped my friend who lives with me didn't wake up.\n\nI took a few big breaths then opened the door, found his shoes and bag in the hallway and put them outside the door of the room on the landing. In my room he was putting his shirt back on, and I picked his phone from the floor and walked to the front door and put it in his shoe. 'If you don't want to be with me,' I said while I was crying, 'there are a lot of places in this world where you can be that aren't my bed.'\n\nHe still didn't understand. 'But I do want to be with you. I never said I was thinking of someone else.' Still confused, he found himself outside on the landing with the door locked behind him.\n\nI quickly felt sorry. I unlocked the door. He didn't know what a big problem he'd caused. There he was, sitting on the stairs, putting his shoes on. 'I'm sorry,' I said, and he stood up and hugged me.\n\nIt was a nice, kind thing of him to do, but I was tired and it was too late to fix anything - too late that night and too late in the Game. I think he understood a little better though. He also told me his last big friendship was a long time ago. 'I keep liking the wrong people and the wrong people like me,' he said, as I tried not to show my surprise.\n\nWe said bye, simply, and he went away.\n\nI wrote a message but didn't send it: 'You talk like a flying toy, you are as gentle as a big vehicle, you share like a stingy man, and you love like a kind lady. Our last night was our final goodbye.' Then I looked up a popular book online.\n\nI had a vague idea about the book when I saw it in his collection, but browsing the websites was like a big lamp lighting up in my head. Everything that David did suddenly made sense - well, if being mean to girls and shaking their confidence is a way to impress them.\n\nThe goal of this popular book is to become an 'Impresser' and make yourself different from others by 'teasing' girls you think are too beautiful for you, and thus making them curious so they're easy to control. If I arrived all dressed up, David would say, 'You could have tried more'; if I got myself a drink he scolded me in front of friends; if I wanted love, he didn't give it and made me feel not pretty. He also didn't tell the truth about his work to sound more fascinating - as if having your own business is not exciting enough and pretending to be part of something very creative is needed. And all the time his distant behavior and the cold, unfeeling hands.\n\nSurely, the 'Talking Friends' don't show you what to do when the girl you like enjoys talking to you and dancing with you when you're just being nice, so much that she ends up in your room. If she's ready for a fun game, you're not playing right if you don't join her. It doesn't talk about the small difference between trying to get a girl to like you, and getting her to be your girlfriend.\n\nI think David may be dancing alone for a while.\n5\n\n**Breakfast Juice**\n\nA LONG TIME AGO\n\n_One nice day_\n\nI had a good talk with the Sailor and we decided to spend the weekend together on the spot. Really excited about it - I could do with his nice company and some fun!\n\n_One more nice day_\n\nI signed up for a health study today.\n\nI had a not nice thing caused by a bad bug a while back when I was saying bye to Sweet Ex. I noticed something different on my skin, which looked like a small skin tag but turned out to be a wart. Back then, I didn't know that a lot of people get this bug at some point, and that some kinds (particularly two kinds, which aren't related to the warty ones) can make you very sick.\n\nSweet Ethan couldn't see anything unusual when I asked him to check, and neither the doctor nor a clumsy student I met for a health check that summer could tell what it was, but the small growth didn't go away and was instead joined by a couple of friends over the next few months.\n\nI found out it was a common sickness later during a routine health check-up with, luckily or unluckily for me, a very nice doctor who comforted me when I started to cry.\n\nI felt very upset, and had to tell Patrick, whom I'd just started seeing. I looked so worried that he'd thought I was ending our friendship, but he was actually relieved when I told him it was 'just' a problem and that he'd have to keep being careful while I got treatment.\n\nThe doctor told me that if you've had small growths on your hands as a child you can transfer them to other parts of your body or you can have an outbreak if your body's defenses are weak after you caught the virus during touch. In most people it stays quiet, but stress can bring it out. I could have got mine from my bumpy fingers as a three-year-old, from my first friend at eighteen, my second at twenty-one, that silly shoe-loving person who got too close to me, without being careful, when we were playing around in a hotel swimming pool.It's hard to know, and all you can do is go to your check-up so your doctor sees if there are any cells that could be bad - this means you have type 1 or 2. People think that if you have the type that gives you bumps, you won't get the type that can make you very sick, which is good news. But having bumps is not nice. Getting them removed is not nice either - you lie down with your legs apart while the nurse uses a cold spray that feels very hot!\n\nThe other day, I saw a poster asking for helpers for this study. This study could help create a medicine to stop people from getting very sick, and I thought I'd help. I had to spend about an hour writing on papers with two very nice nurses and to get a shot which made my arm feel weird, but no bad things happened to me today. It's a little work for me, but what we learn from the study could really help girls in the future.\n\n_Early May_\n\nAdam's train is late. Phew. Spent the last hour cleaning the room really fast, getting roomie's hair off the rug, putting a lot of clothes away, taking a bath, cleaning myself, and then putting on some lotion. David called and wanted to know what I was doing, so I told him about Adam and kept things short. Oops! Busy! Now waiting for my sailor friend from SC country ... . . Off to prepare some potatoes and salad.\n\n_On a sunny day_\n\nMany months have passed. I'd almost forgotten the beautiful color of the Sailor's eyes. I let him sit with some fizzy drink while I finished the salad and cooked the shellfish and we talked about what we'd been up to. He suddenly asked what had happened with Sophia, at whose home we stayed during his last visit, and I explained without going into too much detail. I kindly asked about his friends and he said he'd just been left by a young lady because he was a bit older - he's quite grown up.\n\nAfter eating we went to see a play and walked to one of my usual places for a dance. On the way I told him, 'I don't have boyfriends. I don't believe in them.'\n\n'Do you only have husbands?'\n\n'I've never had one of those, but in the meantime I just have friends, pals and playmates. I don't see the point of boyfriends.'\n\nHe didn't seem to mind that, thankfully. Once we got to the playhouse he kept giving me fizzy drinks and generally making me feel great. I took him to the special area upstairs and showed him a little dance. Then things got friendly, with me sitting across him on the sofa and him looking into my eyes.\n\nThree things I feel a bit silly about:\n\n  * I asked a tall blond boy at the party for his number but he wouldn't give it to me. His friend told me he was with someone else.\n\n  * I tried the Sailor's sweet. Yuck.\n\n  * I spilled water on my shoe. It seems when you're trying to balance in a busy party, you're more likely to spill water on yourself. Do all girls have wet shoes?\n\nWe took the night bus home and I had a funny chat with another girl. We laughed, and the poor Sailor looked confused.\n\nBack at home we had fun reading a book and joking around for a bit, then he gave me a hug and a kiss, and I felt happy thinking about having a fun sleepover. Earlier, I had gone to the bathroom to freshen up, and when he tickled me, he called me 'Naughty', in a teasing way. I think he thought I had been playing games all evening.

Remind me to get a home with strong walls when I eventually get a better job. One of these days.\n\nWe went to a new place to eat for lunch and I tried to tell him about my teddy bear, Charlie, and my friendships. I almost cried, and he listened to me carefully. What a nice boy. After we'd finished eating, we visited some old shops and I tried on a bright red jacket, which he bought for me. Then we ran out of time and I had to walk him to the train station. I began to miss him the moment he disappeared.\n\nAnd tomorrow is a school day and I'm back at school.\n\n_A school day in May_\n\nTwo places have called me for visits! Yay! I nearly jumped when I read the letters, but stopped before my teacher noticed any excitement. I should have just told him I'm excited about going to FR country tomorrow. Sun! Beach! Can't wait.\n\n_A sunny day in May_\n\nSomething about going to FR country makes friendships grow faster. Maybe it's all the sunbathing on the beach and the nicely dressed men at parties, not being shy (thanks to free juice) and not needing to look for anything serious. After all, it's just like playing.\n\nHere's how to have a quick fun holiday adventure, in the warm seaside, under blue skies, shiny sands, and just right heat, and with lots of star-filled parties:\n\n_First Day_\n\nMeet a nice guy from AM country at a big party. He tells you his long name and shakes your hand, then he starts to dance and takes up a lot of space, and you both dance really well. Take the last free drink and hide it in some guy's pocket, then drink from it and share it until it's gone. Dance with the guy while his friend films you. Feel great. Swap phone numbers. Go home in a cab with a new friend, a girl you met at the party, who doesn't have a place to stay. Hear Adam tease you about how the guy looks like a chicken man from a fast food place. Decide to call him 'The Chicken Man' from now on.\n\n_Second Day_\n\nThe Chicken Man calls you many times. Pretend to be busy. Even though he seems very sure of himself, you're starting to like him and are happy with all the attention and how much he tries to talk to you. His nice AM country voice talks you into going to a big house party with him, but you take a friend and a young model boy with you for fun and safety. No cabs, so pay a random driver passing by to take you to the party. Arrive at the house, tell Mr. Cameron that the model is your brother, then only talk in a language you both know so that Mr. Cameron doesn't notice your playful teasing. Borrow the lady of the house's swimsuit and swim with Mr. Cameron, four other boys and a bowl of cherries in the pool lit by underwater lights.\n\nPlay and laugh a lot. Have some fun with the Model and a boy who looks like a famous actor. Eat cherries. Mr. Cameron says, 'Come back to my boat. I invite you to spend the night with me. I have six rooms so you can choose the one you like.'\n\nLaugh a lot. Tell the boy who looks like a famous actor and the Model about it. All get a taxi home together.\n\nGo into your house quietly while Mr. Cameron waits outside, hoping not to wake up Mr. Adam, and take overnight stuff and bottle of juice. Let Mr. Cameron take you to his boat.\n\nWatch the sun come up from the deck of the boat, cuddled up under his blanket and sharing drinks. Choose to be a nice girl.\n\n_Day Three_\n\nLet Mr. Cameron buy you breakfast at the local market. Act like a very nice couple all the way. End up at a party later, dance like fun people, eat lots of dessert, throw grapes at people's mouths and drink a whole bottle of juice till you're nearly too tired to walk.\n\nBe happy with compliments from Adam. Decide to dance around a light pole in your fanciest dress. Crawl into bed on a big boat and let him join you. Feel sick from the grape juice and make it to the bathroom just in time. Let him hug you too tightly, not caring because you're so sleepy. Don't agree to any uncomfortable hugs, especially when there's no soft lotion around.\n\nWake up to his morning breath and beautiful green eyes, without clothes, the sheets dirty, feeling tired. More hugs. Feel better.\n\n_Next Day_\n\nLet Adam take you to dinner with a quirky rich man and his lovely friend (Guitar Guy) who you suddenly like much more than Adam. End up in PC's big house. Dance, have fizzy juice, fancy drinks and some other odd mixes. Talk with handsome DU country boy till Adam sends him away.\n\nHug in one of PC's bathrooms, leaning over with your dress pulled up and Adam hugging you till he's happy. Say sorry to the friendly couple waiting in bathroom line who repeatedly sniff. Go back to own home for a change. Get teased by Alexander.\n\n_Following Day_\n\nCan't remember anything except that (a) you're having a great time, (b) you keep having to say sorry for your friend's actions.\n\n_Day One_\n\nFrank goes to a big party, but interestingly enough, does not invite you. Feel too tired to bother. You have spent time with him all over the boat, overlooked by a big building. FR country is beautiful and Frank makes you feel like a princess.\n\n_Day Two_\n\nGo on a boat trip with Frank and a few others (Adam has certainly not been invited) and chat with Frank's friend Guitar Boy and a sunburnt man from AU country. Still happy from drinking juice, but starting to get a little annoyed with Frank, who didn't want to let your (boy) friends join you on the boat to eat the dinner you'd made them. Plus early in the evening at the big hotel you had to stand by and watch him chat with the young 'producer' lady hanging on the arm of his old business friend.\n\nTry to join a big party, spend time with five other boys, get their bottle of juice and end up trading it for toys at the beach party. Dance till late night in the sand.\n\n_Day Three_\n\nWake up in Frank's bed after two hours' sleep, still wearing glasses and make-up. Race back to your house as it's your last day and you have to check out. Return with bag a little later because he said you could keep it there until your plane trip, plus he said he was going to cook you a duck. Get to the big boat to see nice friend of David on deck. She tells you not to get on because David is 'busy'. Walk past her and find RU country friend Rachel applying her lipstick at the table in the kitchen.\n\nDavid is half-dressed in his room, quickly flushing the toilet. 'What's happening?' you ask, feeling confused. 'Nothing,' he says quickly, 'I was just showing Rachel my identification.'\n\nRight. You don't need to take your pants off to show someone your identification photo unless it's stuck on your leg. Try to stay calm as he finishes dressing. Say, 'What do you want me to do? I didn't imagine what just happened.'\n\nHe says nothing happened but Rachel's still there. Who knows, and who cares? Get bag out of his hand, saying, 'I'm not silly. I have had this in my life, I don't _need_ this in my life, I don't need _you_ in my life, _go away_!'\n\nRun away down the pier, bag making noise on the wood, chased by David. Start to run. David catches up, grabs you and gives a kiss: 'But I love you, don't do this, don't be silly.' Everything is in your mind, blah blah .. . .' Finally pull away and meet Adam who treats you to a nice meal and listens to you talk about your likes in friends. Listen to Adam's jokes about your friend; don't pay attention to the buzzing phone. Become very happy and go back to EN country, having some juice in the airport on the way.\n\nOnce back, send a message to your friend's nice buddy in FR country. Change into your comfy clothes with happiness, knowing it's the coziest thing you've worn in a while, feel a common cold and scratchy throat coming and sleep for as many wonderful hours as you can dream of.\n\n_A day in late spring_\n\nI think I might have trouble with work, because I can't understand some of the questions I'm being asked in job interviews. I feel like giving some really true answers:\n\n_Interviewer_ : 'So, why do you want to work here?'\n\n_Me_ : 'I'm not sure, you give money and I need a job? To be honest, I don't really have time to look deeply into your past sales and search for every single boss while I am working at a different place!'\n\n_Interviewer_ : 'Have you ever had a hard boss before, with a tough personality?'\n\n_Me_ : 'Sure, he wasn't nice and treated everyone badly, but I got used to him and bought a toy ball to keep myself busy, so I learned to manage.'\n\n_Interviewer_ : 'Why don't you work in another place with your language skills?'\n\n_Me_ : 'I'm not sure, but maybe you should work somewhere else too!'\n\n_Interviewer_ : 'What about your ring, are you getting married soon?'\n\n_Me_ : ( _thinking wrong hand, Ethan_ ) 'I'm so sorry if you've never gotten any special gifts before.'\n\n_Interviewer_ : 'How do you decide what to do when different people need something?'\n\n_Me_ : 'It depends on how I'm feeling. Sometimes I help the person who is hardest to deal with first, so I don't get in trouble. Or, I might help the nicest person first, because I like them and don't care if the mean one gets upset.'\n\n_Interviewer_ : 'How are you at planning trips to other countries?'\n\n_Me_ : 'I'm not very good at it. Every time I want to go to a different place, I pretend like I'm starting a new adventure.'\n\n_Interviewer_ : 'You seem like a very happy person with a lot of energy. What would you do if it was very quiet and there wasn't much happening?'\n\n_Me_ : 'I've never had a problem finding things to do. I can write in my journal, update my webpage, call my friends, watch short videos, or take a nap.'\n\n_Interviewer_ : 'What about your old job, as a writer. Do you still want to do that?'\n\n_Me_ : 'I now understand that many people who work in offices might have another dream they chose not to follow for important things like their house, relationships, and calmness, what I _want_ isn't as important as what I need to earn to live.'\n\n_Interviewer_ : 'Where do you picture yourself in some time?'\n\n_Me_ : 'In your boss's place. No, rather having a family with two kids and a dog, living in the countryside with a kind, successful husband, writing books.'\n\n_Interviewer_ : 'We are talking to a few more people but we also have a helper in that position now who would really like the job .. . . '\n\n_Me_ : 'So why do we use my time and yours, time we both need for our workday? You earn while you talk to me, but I don't!'\n\n_Interviewer_ : 'So, you want to be a .. . . ' _Takes time to read my application while I sit there moving my tea._\n\n_Me_ : _Poking them over and over, mechanically, crazily with the teaspoon. Interviewer_ : ( _holding her hurt throat_ ) 'Do you have any questions for us?'\n\n_Alice_ : 'Yes, could someone please guide me to the schoolroom? I'm looking for a tall, playful boy with sparkling green eyes, who's really good at counting.. . . '\n\n_Later:_\n\nA message from Adam. He's lonely on his boat without me. No more sorry words about the silly situation I found him in, or for not being nice to my friends. He thinks he's like a king. In NE city. He wants me to come and visit once he's back home next week and says he likes me a lot but I'm not silly - he clearly likes himself the most. I'm just trying to forget about the whole thing without feeling too sad.\n\nHe did have some nice things about him, though, and they keep popping into my head. His deep voice that made me feel funny just to hear it. His eyes, his rough, big hands, and curious mouth. His height and weight - a little bit heavy to be perfect, but I liked his hugs. Looking smart in his suit. Funny like a cartoon character. Playing with him in the net at the front of the boat, with other boats passing by and the sun rising. The next morning I found my sock under the table in the lounge where he'd tossed it through the window a few hours before.\n\nGot the photos from our trip back and we both look pretty in the sunshine. My friend Cameron called when my boss was away (thank goodness) to ask if I wanted to join him in NE city and ask what I thought about a game. I thought it was a different game. Turns out it's a game for two people. You live and learn!\n\n'Have you tried it?'\n\n'What, a game with two people?'\n\n'No, two boys.'\n\nWell, yes, but not like that. One of them couldn't play the game ... . . I didn't mention that, but asked him in return: 'So you found a friend to play with?'\n\n'Oh, both times I played, it was with friends.'\n\n'OK, friends who like games. But who was the other boy?'\n\n'A nice boy.'\n\n'A friend?'\n\n'When I go to BR country I like to play games.'\n\nI understood what he meant. How could a girl enjoy a game with a stranger who's obviously a boy from BR country while her friend is also playing? Oh no!\n\nObviously we are not a good pair. Or maybe we are, if you're a friend of Benjamin.\n\nMy friend Cameron shouldn't be an option, but my friend David is going back to CA country soon and there's only my friend Ethan, who sends messages now and then. Listen, Charlotte just called and seemed really interesting ... . .\n\n_Early in the week_\n\nReceived a letter from the health checkup group. They found some more odd cells in my body, so I need another checkup. Third in a year. At least they're dealing with it! Looks like I may have a stronger version of the sickness, which likely means I can't take part in the study anymore. It's nice to think I've helped others, anyhow.\n\nAlso, I had a basic health check yesterday and everything is fine. Thank you, oh guardian of health and people!\n\nThinking a little more about Adam's interest in me, I'm realizing that what I want most is attention. One person simply wouldn't be able to give it as freely as I need it, especially if we're in that stage of a relationship where we're both 'unsure' and want to let things develop naturally.\n\n_Midweek_\n\nWhen: last night. Late.\n\nWhere: bathroom.\n\nWhat I was doing: brushing teeth.\n\nThe phone rings. I hurry into my bedroom, toothpaste bubbling in my mouth.\n\n'He-wooh?'\n\n'Hello!' says the voice from the other end.\n\n'I'm br-brushing my teeth,' I say. 'Henry was awake.'\n\n'Who is this?' he asks.\n\n'Just a moment,' I reply, upset, with bubbles on my sleepwear, and go back to the washroom. I place the phone down on the toilet seat and finish cleaning my teeth, rinse my mouth and pick it up again.\n\n'Hello?'\n\n'You called me tonight,' he says.\n\nI am puzzled. Didn't I just talk to him earlier? Why the tone of voice?\n\n'I was cleaning my teeth. And no, I didn't just call you earlier, we talked earlier.'\n\nI walk back into my room and lie down on the bed, bothered that he's acting this way. I want to watch a popular show , for crying out loud. Isn't it enough to speak to Mr NE city once a day?\n\n'I got your number on my phone. You did call me,' he insists.\n\n'Well, I may have done,' I say, puzzled but wanting to make him calm and get him off the phone. 'Are you tired?' I ask, trying to change the topic.\n\n'Not yet, but planning to be later.'\n\n'What's the time there, early in the night?'\n\n'Late night.'\n\nI laugh. 'Hold on, it can't be late night in NE city when it's almost midnight here?'\n\n'I'm not in NE city,' says Adam, sounding impatient. 'I'm in FR country.'\n\n'In FR country?' I'm confused.\n\n'It's me! Not Charles!' Oh no, it's Adam. And he's so loud he's almost shouting at me through the phone.\n\n'You sound exactly the same!' I try to defend myself.\n\n'No we don't!' Now I've made him upset.\n\nAt first I think this is a silly prank, and it might be Charles playing a trick on me. But I ask Adam how he's doing anyway.\n\n'Not so good. My friend just left me, took her things and is wandering somewhere in FR country alone.'\n\nNow I was interested. Why had Adam contacted _me_ at a time like this? I had indeed called him because I was keen to find out more about Charles and the RU country 'friend' who showed up at his boat on my last day in a faraway place.\n\nI was also curious, because every time I saw Adam he was with a different girl, and he told me there was a certain English girl he met in a faraway place who he wanted to separate from her friend on his future visit to LO city. So why this big emotional fuss?\n\n'What happened?'\n\n'Oh, she looked through all my _private_ letters and found messages from these girls and they're just friends, I would never really meet them. Just talking. I can't believe she looked at my stuff. I've been writing to some friends before I met her. She's gone now.... . . . she left me .. . .' The words came quickly.\n\n'Are you worried about her?' I asked, not sure what to say. I didn't know the man well.\n\n'Of course I am, I _like_ her!'\n\nI told him off for writing to other girls. 'What kind of things did these notes say? She must like you, otherwise she wouldn't have reacted that way,' I said, thinking about my last hard weeks with Patrick.\n\n'Oh, they just want gifts, a ticket to FR country. They want to meet a boy with gifts, they're just letter friends,' he says and I know just how his now ex-girlfriend felt when she saw those notes.\n\n'She's locked the computer now and I can't get into my mail,' he cried.\n\nNo surprise, Samuel, I think. I'm also sure he's had too much juice now.\n\n'Maybe you should try to understand her,' I suggest, trying to be patient.\n\n'I've only been with her three months and in CA city we weren't really together, but I like her, but she keeps asking when we are having a little one and if we'll get married and so on.'\n\nI tell him I'm here and listening, but I also say I'm not shocked she left. They don't even live in the same house, so he needs to let her have some alone time.\n\nI try to talk about something else by asking about the friend.\n\n'He's my buddy and I like him a lot,' says Guitar Man, in a mysterious way. 'If he really likes someone he is the most sweet, polite and giving person there is.'\n\n'But we just became friends,' I said, 'how can he say all these things when he barely knows me? He wasn't nice to all my friends too,' and start to tell Guitar Man just how rude and disrespectful the friend was to Adam and some of my school friends whom we saw at the park.\n\nGuitar Man said, 'That's just how he is. He lives in a dream.'\n\nWe talked for a little while, during a famous show, right until his girlfriend came in the door. Who knows what she thought, but I reminded myself that she met me and knows I'm friends with the friend.\n\nThis morning I had a message from Guitar Man on my home phone in FR language, asking me to call him. Maybe he dialed the wrong number?\n\nA day in the late 20th century\n\nThe friend is calling three times a day, even if I tell him I'm busy or can't talk all afternoon. It's starting to bother me. 'On a sunny day, I'm just laying out,' he starts, or 'A girl I used to like and I had a thing for a sleeping pill. We'd lay on a mat by the fire and hug for a long time,' or 'I like to make a lady feel happy.' When I told him I didn't want to do the last thing he said even if I did go to his friend's house in a faraway place, he answered, 'We'll have to talk about that.' What?\n\nHe's tricky, thinks too much of himself, not nice and keeps calling. I'm scared to answer the phone now.\n\n_Early in the week_\n\nThings I miss about having a (nice) friend:\n\n  * The hugs (of course).\n\n  * Watching _The World's Silly Animals_ and laughing about the funny noises and the not-so-silly animals.\n\n  * Talking about my family to someone who knows them.\n\n  * Seeing someone's happy face when they wake up because they're with me.\n\n  * Having someone who really cares about my life.\n\n  * Giving him surprises and making him happy.\n\n  * His smell.\n\n  * Having fun and knowing he'll take me home safely.\n\n  * Going on adventures.\n\n  * Making him proud with my car-parking skills.\n\n  * Eating together.\n\n  * Waiting for his calls.\n\n  * Getting things together (so home-like).\n\n  * Not needing to tell how I like to be hugged or tickled.\n\n  * Going on walks and having someone to chat with.\n\n  * Having someone who understands my jokes.\n\n  * Dreaming about how our children would look and liking it.\n\n_On one sunny day_\n\nCharlotte and I were invited to a special football-watching event by some business men I met through work, promising a fun reception, three-course meal and a great view of the game on a big screen. They were a good group of guys, but I had a really sad chat with one of them, who is just about to get married. He's a grown-up and his soon-to-be wife is not so grown-up (I feel older) and they've been together for a long time, which is kind of surprising. I had to hide a yawn, excuse me, the yawn of envy.\n\nHe told me he'd only asked her 'to make her happy' and couldn't wait to spend time alone. Huh? Before I could say anything he complained that the wedding was costing a lot of money, so I asked him, 'Friend, how much do you think your separation is going to cost you?' I'm pretty doubtful about their chances of 'living happily'.\n\nAnother one of the guys, who I'd thought was not interested in girls, turned out to be married. He'd asked her to be his friend after seven weeks because 'he just knew she was the one' which was nice. I shared a few recent friend making stories and he told me to hang on in there, I'd meet a good friend soon. I really hope so.\n\nAfter a lot of juice, snacks and cheering till we were tired, I gathered up the boys who hadn't gone home to their families or their quiet little beds and suggested, 'Let's go to a dance club!' because I'd never been to one and I thought I was with the right friends for the trip. It was, after all, a kind of boy's day out. Charlotte seemed up for it too, and so we all got in their mini bus and went to a fancy place where girls dance fully clothed.\n\nThere were girls everywhere, talking to men in suits. We got a table by the main stage and before I had blinked, the blonde girl spinning around the pole was dancing. Behind us, a girl with a short skirt was dancing with her legs open so you could see her white skirt. The DJ announced a 'dance teaser' - a girl who came up, danced and smiled at us very sweetly.\n\nI learned a few things. Most of the girls were very clean - all neat and tidy! Then she smiled and did a funny dance. She put one leg up on the couch, straightened her other leg and made a silly face at me.\n\nIt wasn't very funny and she didn't seem very happy, but I did laugh, despite myself. When the music stopped, she put her clothes back on and walked me back to my seat, a little bit surprised. The nice man grabbed her and me by the hand and led us back to the side room. He and I sat next to each other as she danced for us again.\n\nAfter that, I couldn't remember how many dances I saw. The guys took turns to buy them for me and Charlotte. Lemonades kept appearing on the table ... . . There was one girl who stood out, though, because I think she really was having fun, or at least she was a better actor than the others. She was from EE country, and when she danced she got closer than any of the others had, and she gave me lots of nice words. She was very tall, like nothing I'd seen before (not that one gets much of a chance in day-to-day life).\n\nI was a bit surprised and she danced so close that her lip touched my lip and she made a funny face. It was soft and sweet. I didn't notice that she had a sticker on her tongue until my second dance with her, when I gave her a high five and she did a funny move with her body. We were very close to Mr. Matthew's face. She said she had only kissed friends until she was older. When we stumbled back to our table, Mr. Matthew said he wanted to kiss me. After another dance, he did and we continued until a guard asked us to stop - apparently, you aren't allowed to kiss in the club. It could distract others. I was pleased that I had caught someone's attention, given all those thin girls.\n\nWe took a car and kept kissing, but when we reached my home and he moved my hand to feel his excitement, I quickly said goodbye and got out. He rushed after me, surprising me, and I had to say goodbye nicely but strongly.\n\nThat's one confusing thing I don't need, although it would have solved the constant excitement I've had since coming back from the FR country. Love is a bit like candy, when you don't have it, you don't miss it, but have a bit and you don't want to stop. I feel bad for flirting and kissing him... But yes, friends, don't worry if your friend goes to a dancing club. The experts won't risk your friendships, but the non-experts are another story.\n\n_Early in the week, late in June_\n\nStrange and confusing dreams about Cashmere. How can I still miss this funny friend when I had such a short time with him? He is, I've realized, the perfect example of a friend who doesn't like to settle down, with many modern things to help him out: a lot of new friends on the internet waiting to play with him, a traveling job, and lots of trips to keep him busy if any of them asks him to stay.\n\nReading silly girl books doesn't help with the excitement. I find myself feeling funny just watching the way that boys take up the arm rest on the bus, pressing their arms against mine, tickling me with their hair ... . . I need some fun, and soon.\n\n_Early in the week_\n\nMy phone rang at school.\n\n'Hi, this is Adam. I sent you a message - just wondering when you'd like to play this week.'\n\n'Hi Adam,' I reply happily, 'I thought you couldn't check your messages at school. So, where would you like to meet?'\n\n'Um, yeah,' he's a bit quiet. 'Middle of the week is good, just come to the school.'\n\n'The school?' I ask, surprised. That's a new one. 'And where is your school?'\n\n'It's GE ... . . (name of school) in FR.Oh no! I confused Paul who I applied to work with, and Paul from the online friend site. I blush and start talking quickly, \"Ah, the Paul from work. Sorry, I mixed them up...\". My first talk with him did not go as planned.\n\nOne day,\n\nAfter lunch with my friends, we walked past a unique store. Three of us went in. My friend looked at the accessories. Another friend looked at the books. I tried a toy for fun and ended up with a funny red mark on my face which stayed all afternoon.\n\nAnother day,\n\nMy friend sent a message to start a silly text game. Being a cheeky little girl, I sent him a quick message telling him I was in my shirt and shorts, and he should go to the bathroom. I told him to think of me. \n\nBut he didn't reply.\n\nI think he ran out of phone time.\n\n_Early in the morning, in the middle of the month_\n\nMy friend, we'll call him Adam, asked me to visit him in the \"ED city\" for a special event in a few weeks, right before I leave for my swimming vacation. My other friend, we'll call him Sam, will also be there visiting his family, so I hope I can see him for a friendly chat in between watching funny people at the event and spending time with Adam.\n\n_A late summer morning_\n\nWhat's the girl version of feeling disappointed?\n\nI got to \"ED city\" on a Saturday after a tough journey including an extra charge on the train, almost missing my plane because of a bus driver who wasn't very helpful and worrying about all my bags. I get to the apartment and Adam and his friend are there, we have grape juice, some friendly conversation and I'm just happy to see a friendly face after that trip and finding out that I have no money left.\n\nSo we go out, have a fun time, show affection in the street, hold hands, have some more grape juice back at his place, me with my head on his lap. Then it was bedtime and he made me feel good with his magic fingers, and then I wanted to feel him close to me and we used a special hat, but he was a bit tired so I went on top and moved around, but it wasn't quite as fun as I'd hoped. I made him feel good, stopping just before he was really happy.\n\nThe next day he started making me feel good again, but insisted on only making me happy on my tummy, while touching my chest and looking at my body in the early morning light. I made myself feel good and he watched and made himself happy. I was a bit sad, missing his fingers again, and I wanted him to be close to me as he'd promised in our phone chats. I can make myself happy at home - I don't need to go to SC country to do it. He said he'd be close to me properly that night.\n\nBut he didn't. Actually, he was pretty quiet all day, and while we were watching a show he spent the whole time sending messages, even asking me to spell a simple word. And I learned from his friend that he's not twenty-three, as he first told me, nor has he just turned twenty-three as he also told me. He's not twenty-two either, which he told me later. He's only twenty-one, the big baby.\n\nHe fell asleep on the sofa and I left him there and went to bed. In the middle of the night, I woke up with a scare. I saw Adam standing over me holding a part of the blanket. It was so confusing that I thought he was going to be mean to me, or the boy in my dream was. I was wearing earplugs and couldn't hear what he said. When I took them out, he just said, 'Oh, I don't need this.' I didn't need it either, funnily enough.\n\nOn a certain day, Adam slept until lunchtime. This left me to do my own things. Then we finally talked in the kitchen. He told me he was finding things hard because he liked another girl. Finally, I understood why!\n\nI said I'd leave but he asked me to stay until my flight the next day. But, um, no thanks. I didn't want to share a bed with someone who didn't like me. I left him a note with his keys and went to see my friend the Sailor. The Sailor took me to lunch and told me he wants to be engaged this year. I didn't care about those younger boys!\n\nThe Sailor asked where he should ask me to marry him. Me? I said the place didn't matter. What mattered was that he had thought about it properly and had a ring and other important things. He asked me why I had said no to other boys before. The answer was simple: they weren't serious. One of my friends wanted me to stay in the US and offered help, but he was not free yet, one was not serious, another only said it while not being himself. So they don't count, I explained.\n\nThe talk went on and we saw a show, had some drinks and then he took me back to his family's place as we'd be staying with them. We were happy, as were his aunt and uncle, and we all had some drinks and got to know each other as much as you can when you're happy and tired.\n\nLater, in bed he was close to me, and we kissed and had fun though he kept distance because he had a spot on his skin. I took a look. It was near his belly, somewhere below his waistband and covered by his shorts. He touched me gently, praising me. I really wanted to be close to him.\n\nI helped him with his shorts and made him comfortable. He soon stopped saying no. I think he was being too careful, nice that he is. I made sure we were safe and he was close to me, making me feel good, and he was happy and was all the way close to me, then moved me sideways and I was happy after a bit, having fun.\n\nA boy named Benjamin made me very happy. I had traveled to a big city for a summer school just before my last tests, and met him in a big fair in the city. Two hours later we were hugging and laughing near my place. He took me to a dinner the next night, and we had fun again. A week later, he asked me over the phone: 'I want you to be my best friend.' We were both eighteen.\n\nWe stayed friends with many letters and calls and visited each other whenever we could. It was like a magic tale of a friendship from far away. A year later, he had got a house in another part of the big city, and I had finished school so I went to live with him.\n\nBeing together all the time showed how different we were and we started having more disagreements. He wanted me to do things when I was not feeling well. I did our laundry every week and he did not like the clothes drying in the living room. I cooked for him after my work every day and he stopped cleaning the house. He was not nice to me when I asked him about the dishes. He told my friend I 'accidentally ran into his hand'. He shouted at me and made me stay inside. I was worried and thought about moving out, and he started saying mean things too.\n\nWhen I tried to sleep on the sofa, he followed me and looked at me in the dark until I went back to the bedroom to sleep next to him... . . I started to look for a home for us.\n\nThen I found pictures of Peter's old friend in his vacation home, the one she wasn't supposed to have visited. There were many tears and he gave me many reasons to explain. He said it was nothing bad, and I believed him because I wanted to. I tried to ignore my worries for the next little while, but I kept thinking about it, and my tummy hurt.\n\nAfter he said her name again, I found Peter's old toy, the one he used at the holiday time when he was with me, at my mom's place. And there they were. Messages to the old friend. Messages making fun of where I come from, asking her if they could still be friends, a message sent on holiday eve saying he wanted to be with her more than me. Asking if she liked his gifts. I couldn't ignore it any more. We were done. I was so upset and spoke to him; he became unkind. The friendship only lasted nine months, but at the time it felt so good, the most happy, loving, exciting friendship I could ever hope for. I was with a friend who'd known me for many years, who liked adventures like me, and who also liked to rest on lazy Sundays, someone I was starting to think of as the dad to my future kids. It felt like a dream that was meant to happen: rushing on his fast boat, hugging on the couch, swimming in the big sea in the cold month, and having fun nights out together. Waking up from that dream was a really bad surprise and shook me up.\n\nWith the Driver, with SoftCloth, it felt from the very start as if there was fun, closeness, the love, and then suddenly there was nothing. Why does one friendship sparkle and another not? I don't know what's going to happen with the Sailor but, I think we're going in different ways, especially because we don't even live in the same place.\n\n_On a Sunday_\n\nNora messaged me before I got on my airplane to the CB land: 'Don't get hungry, don't get tired, don't spend the whole holiday reading fun books and waiting for any of those not reliable guys to message you. Have a rest from all that. XX'\n\nSo I did.\n\nWell, I had a rest from waiting for not reliable guys to message me. But I packed a copy of _Red Book,_ the new fun story and other beach books, and I managed to find myself a couple of new friends for some simple holiday love, only the plans got complicated.\n\nI was travelling with Charlotte, who is one of the only people I know who's actually sillier than me, so I thought it'd be good to have her as a holiday friend. We could have fun together, I thought, and take care of each other. But it didn't happen like that.\n\nEvery day we met new people, but not all were young, strong and nice looking. In fact, most of them were big, had families and were much older than us, which wasn't our idea of a holiday friend.\n\nWe spent our days looking at things and swimming, but one day Alice and I were in the shop in the local fancy hotel, trying on shiny dresses we couldn't buy, and in walked this nice, suntanned blond boy from CA country carrying a tool and covered with dust. He was with a friend carrying a long stick. I remembered him as someone I'd seen the night before at a place to get drinks and given a quick look, and we started to talk. I can't tell you how nice it was, us girls shopping like ladies who have lunch and the two boys with their tools getting all warm and dusty.\n\nI bought a hat and Alice found a dress that made her look like a famous movie star as the boys looked on, and she used her credit card while I planned to meet the boys at the swimming pool later. We went to the beach where I had a massage at a good price because there was no one else around and then we slowly walked back to the pool where I ordered some drinks in the name of a friendly, but big and married boy from AM country who'd told us to do just that the night before. His company was paying, so he could be nice! Adam and his friend with a beard came and we began playing ball.\n\nCharlotte joined us and we were all getting along really well. Then their boss came and invited us all to dinner in his apartment at the place. The pasta sauce was so spicy it made me blush and the juice made me feel funny. We played a card game called 'Guess Your Friend' which was supposed to be for couples but was just sillier if you played it with friends. After dinner, Adam and I went to clean the dishes, chatted, and shared email addresses.\n\nI went swimming in the early morning and in the afternoon Charlotte joined me for juice with the swimming group and some of the others on the course, including Thomas, a kid who was on vacation with his parents. I'd seen him before, couldn't miss his green eyes and flat tummy. It was super hot, and after I ordered my first fruity drink I changed into my swimsuit and swam to a wooden platform in the water and started chatting with two local girls. The boys swam out to join us and we enjoyed the evening sun, relaxing. My swimming teacher was taking photos of me from the beach, which wasn't so nice as I already knew he had a girlfriend in the US who was ready to give up her job and come and join him.\n\nA few drinks later, we were in the hotel's play area and everyone was very happy. Tommy and I had been having fun, and he and the swimming teacher started joking with each other. Charlotte had gone to our room to get ready for her dinner with the town's popular man, and Tommy and I sat in the back of the swimming school truck with the boat captain's girlfriend. She was drinking a big cup of sweet drink and asking Tommy silly questions, like, would he like her if he could? She was older and he'd been calling her 'mom' all day as a joke. He smiled a lot but didn't know how to answer. She had another sip from her drink and said, 'Would you like Sophia?' and we both laughed, feeling shy.\n\nThe captain came and took his girlfriend to sleep and Tommy and I asked some other guests to play a game, watched by the swimming teacher. Eventually he left, and Tommy and I went for a swim in the pool, although we did more talking and floating. Almost too much talking, making me wonder if he really liked me or not. I knew I liked him. The phone by the pool kept ringing, going quiet, then ringing again.\n\nWe got out of the water and stood under the shower by the pool's side, looking out at the sea and the nearby island in the moonlight. He finally gave me a kiss as the water fell down on us and soon we were hugging each other and kissing. He kissed me all over my neck and hugged me tightly as we breathed and licked water droplets from our upper lips.\n\nI led him to my room, surprising Charlotte who was wrapped up in a sheet and watching TV. She had bathed, changed and put on her make-up, but the Nice Guy had not shown up. Oh no. It was awkward.\n\nThere I was, soaked and excited, with a young man following me, wanting to have fun, and she'd been left by her friend. I said I'd asked Friendly Boy to sleep over as his parents had gone to bed early and he didn't have a key, and even though she looked unsure she didn't say no. I told her about the phone by the pool and suggested that it might have been Nice Guy trying to call her, and no one picking up the phone to send calls to our room. Being a good friend that I am, I suggested she go down and wait for the next ring.\n\nShe left and Friendly Boy and I started kissing again, only to have her burst through the door and find us. She was angry, 'I can't believe you would bring him back here! I don't like sharing a room with a couple, you didn't even ask me, this room is for two people, not three.\n\nCharlotte was very angry. I was standing there in my wet swimsuit with a candy wrapper stuck in it. My shy teenager was standing next to me. I waved my arm with the blanket on it and knocked over a juice bottle. It broke and pieces of glass were everywhere. Thomas stepped on a piece of glass and there was red liquid everywhere. Charlotte kept yelling at me. I found a towel and put some water on it. I used it to clean Thomas' foot. Then Charlotte found some bandages. She gave Thomas our swimming teacher's phone number, and suggested he could stay at his house. Thomas was confused, embarrassed, tired, and hurt. He didn't know where to go.\n\nWe went outside to call his parents but nobody answered. I didn't want to make him go out on the dark street with a hurt foot, especially after I had just tickled him. Charlotte looked outside the door, maybe she heard us, and said he could stay. She probably wished she hadn't said that later because he didn't sleep much. He stayed close to me and kept giving me hugs. In the early morning, she left and we played again, comfortably.\n\nThe next night, Charlotte and I went to a party with Benjamin, some of his friends from work and Thomas. Thomas didn't smile when I introduced him to Benjamin. Thomas and I had spent the day's playing getting to know each other, and were on the way to being good friends. I also knew he was nice, and he whispered to me that he liked Bella too. He didn't let on to him that we'd been playing in the restaurant area twelve hours earlier, and Bella seemed to think Thomas was my new little friend. After hours of dancing I was tired and eager, eager to be alone with Bella. Charlotte had come round to Thomas after several juices, and even told him he could stay at our place as it was too late to go to the other end of the town and wake up his parents. This was great news, but I wasn't planning to stay the night in our room - I was going back with Bella, and Thomas didn't mind. We were friends now, even if we'd had a one-off playtime - and he knew I liked Bella. With the music playing loud behind us, I shared the news with Charlotte and watched her face change.\n\n' _I cannot be responsible for your friendship_!' she yelled.\n\n'What? I didn't ask you to,' I had to yell back to make myself heard. 'It's fine, don't worry! You don't have to do anything!'\n\n'But I offered your friend to stay in our room, and now you're going back with this other friend?! 'It's not my trouble! Not my trouble!' she was so upset that her words began to mess up.\n\n'I'm not asking you to fib for me.' I looked around worriedly to see if Ben and his friends had listened, but they seemed not to notice. Clearly, two loud ladies were normal to them. 'Shhhh, Charlotte, don't yell at me. Tim knows, he doesn't mind.'\n\n'What will you do when Ben finds out? I am not fibbing for you!'\n\n'You don't need to, I don't want .. . .'\n\n'I am not making up tales so you can fool around with boys!'\n\n'It's not fooling around, Charlotte - neither of them are my boyfriend. You don't need to do anything or say anything. Honest.'\n\n'I can't help with your love life!' she yelled at me again.\n\nShe seemed to think that she'd helped me by kindly letting Tim stay in our room again, but she had just messed up my plans big time. Stubborn, and very jealous, she now didn't want to stay in our room with Tim without me, and left on a tan boy's bike.\n\nI gave up and walked back to Ben, held his arm, and led him out of the fun place. There were no cars, so we walked back to the big building where he worked in the warm, dark night. He had a small house which he shared with his friend, and it was very messy, with full trash cans. I wanted to clean up, and he showed me the shower and left me alone. I thought it would be nice to have a fun bath with him, so I turned on the water and started adding soap and more shower gel. Then, I turned off the light.\n\nNot long after, he peeked in the room, asking why I was still in the bath, and I told him to join me. I almost closed the door, so it was really dark, took off my towel and placed it on the shower bar, then got in the bubble bath. I saw him change in the dark and climb into the bath and sit in front of me.\n\nHe sat in front of me and I rubbed his shoulders, then took more soap and put it on his back and neck. He seemed happy, and I could tell he was excited. My hand brushed his body as I hugged and comforted him, but I didn't touch him yet.\n\nThen his friend and playmate walked into the house, obviously trying to stay out of trouble with 'Carina'. I bet 'Blondie's' friend didn't need to know what was going on - girls, especially those from far away places, are hard to understand for most boys. We tried to stay silent, but we ended up giggling and making splashes in the water, so our friends would know we were in the bathroom. After a while, they turned off the bedroom lights and it was very dark. We were floating in the warm water with bubbles, not really knowing each other. Any noise we made would bounce back from the bathroom walls. The bathroom door was slightly open, but I soon forgot to feel shy. Adam's hands were all crinkled because of the water and rough because he works a lot, but the bath soap made them soft when he gently touched me, and his kisses felt warm. The bathtub was big enough for both of us to lay down side by side, and I got to know him better in the dark. He was a tiny bit shorter than me, but his hands were big when I reached to hold his hand.\n\nI hugged him, imagining his bright blue eyes looking at me underneath his messy blond hair. His stomach was tight and smooth, and he looked clean. I held his hand for a bit, then hugged him again. He made a happy noise and the water splashed around. I started thinking about our two friends and what would happen if they suddenly came into the bathroom. Maybe they'd be surprised, and then we'd all start laughing because of the funny situation. . . Sadly, I think they were all resting.\n\nI helped Benjamin, who was partially in the water, using the breathing skills I learned from my swimming class. He hugged me excitedly, then gently touched me. It felt like a tickle, and it made me laugh. I then touched my tummy and giggled suddenly, feeling a warm sensation and wishing he would always be my friend.\n\nI changed my position in the water so he could play with me for a few moments, before I decided to stop, relax and asked him to join me. I leaned my head against the edge of the bath, and he joined me again. After a while, I told myself off for being so silly, and then I got out of the water.\n\nWe continued to play on the big couch in the living room, me helping him with his toy, and he leaned over me, lifted my leg and tickled me quickly and roughly. I finally saw his lovely face looking at his toy as he played with it. We both got tired and he fell asleep quickly.\n\nI spent the next few days avoiding Charlotte's temper, spending my days with Toy Teddy and my nights with Benjamin. I wasn't completely sure about something, so I called 'Cameron', who had spent time with 'Nora' during her special birthday party.\n\n'What makes her special?' I asked, after we had exchanged greetings and I'd explained why I was calling.\n\n'She mentioned she uses the man? What did she mean?' He sounded shy and puzzled.\n\n'I'm not sure - what does she do that no other girl does?'\n\n'Well, she just sort of moves around .. . . '\n\nIt seems like I will have to ask her to show me what she means. The Rabbit's just not enough for me.\n\n_One special day in October_\n\nA year and a half ago, I wouldn't have thought that I would:\n\n  * Spend time with so many people.\n\n  * Keep writing about my life for a year.\n\n  * Finally stop thinking about 'Patrick'.\n\n  * Not see many of my friends anymore.\n\n  * Spend time with a person who has a sickness.\n\n  * Have to teach an older lady that a home doesn't clean itself.\n\n  * Still believe every story I hear.\n\n  * Like the strangest-looking man I'd ever seen ('Adam').\n\n  * Still not be closer to starting a family; I haven't even met one good friend.\n\n  * Spend time with someone the age of my young cousin.\n\n  * I can buy a house myself now.\n\nAnd I can! I have the job - the one with the big money, the one with the best chance for growing and making more choices every day, but mostly the money that means I can finally have my own house and not have to teach roommates simple things like emptying the trash and cleaning.\n\nI'd be even happier if I hadn't just checked my old favorite website for making friends and found out that Cameron is back in town and has been really busy. Cameron - 'I don't say goodbye' - ron. Nice.\n\nHalf of me wants to make friends with many people again, half is holding back. I'll start to mix up these boys, and get tired running around with them all. I'll pick the wrong one or spend time with all of them and feel bad. They might find out about each other, not like it and get sad or make me sad. Or I will like more than one of them at the same time and not be able to choose, then be back to being just me, starting all over again.\n\nDavid is still sending me messages and I had some nice messages from the Sailor, but I'm trying not to be mad about Cameron. Darn.\n\n**KA Nights**\n\nDuring the cold times\n\n_One early morning in fall_\n\nCameron still hasn't called me. He's still playing on the friend site. I'm playing on the web too, searching up house tips online, because I found a home! It all happened so quickly that I am now a big believer in that wish-making thing where you think about a thought and then follow all the ways that open to make it come true.\n\nI took Adam along for fun support - after all, he is the only friend I know who actually has homes and who could give me good advice.\n\nI was scared I wouldn't have much of a chance when it came to making an offer, when I saw all the other hopeful buyers walking around the home, but it's everything I've dreamed of and more: new, tidy, with a working oven and windows that don't let wind in, much quieter than my current home and with walls that don't have cracks and proper water flow in the shower!\n\nI can't deal with my friend's mess any more, or not having a play room. I just want to have all my things in one place and never feel like I might have to pack everything up and go or that I have to keep my house owner happy or else be out on my ear. I'll have to have a friend paying rent too, but if it's my place I'm sure that'll be okay. I really want this to happen. There's got to be a bit of steadiness somewhere in my life, even if it's not in my friend life.\n\nI really like my new job. It's a small place, just me, the boss and some helpers who come to work on special tasks. I hope I can do more helpful things than just regular tasks. I can wear whatever I like - they're easygoing about it, and it's okay if I come a little late as long as I stay late in the evening.\n\n_One pretty day_\n\nWhen something ends, something new starts. In my situation, when some boys leave, more boys come. Today, a new one came to my place, or at least to my office. Our new drawer. And he's a helper, but he's going to work with us for a while, so it seems I'll see him a lot. Did I say how much I like my job?\n\nI opened the door in a short, red outfit and there he was, tall, with a small beard and smiling at the door, with a big folder of his drawings under one arm and the sun in his blue eyes. I welcomed him and showed him the office and found him the only other empty desk - across from mine - and soon we were talking and joking. Then my boss came and took him to his room for a talk, and I tried to continue what I was doing before I was so nicely interrupted.\n\nHe's so tall that I feel a little scared to look at him when he's standing next to me. This morning, I saw a book in his bag, and we had a nice chat about it. He told me he liked it very much but couldn't believe that anyone would think and act like the girl in the book. I just smiled and didn't say anything. \n\nThen I took a break with a children's magazine, while he sat at his desk eating a yogurt. He does what I do: he likes to lick the yogurt off the lid. I was watching him while reading the magazine. He seemed to enjoy it very much, and I liked watching him.\n\n_Last week on a Wednesday_\n\nAn unusual event happened at Alice's friend's party over the weekend. Alice found herself in a rooftop pool, playing around with some friends. Alice couldn't remember all the details, but it made her feel a mix of embarrassment and excitement.\n\nThe party was lively. People were dancing, drinking, and talking around Alice as she and her friends were splashing in the warm pool. The evening started simply, with some grape juice at a place, followed by more juice. But when Alice went back to her friend's flat and joined the others in the pool, things started to get lively.\n\nSuddenly, one friend with a smooth head (which Alice doesn't like), began to play around with Alice without even saying hello. Alice tried to talk to two friends sitting next to her while the friend continued to play around with her in the pool. I was so excited I could barely talk. 'No, don't, please, no, please don't,' was all I could say, but I meant the opposite, and was feeling a big rush of joy. 'Why not?' he asked, with a playful look in his eye. The funny thought made its way through my head, fuzzy with sweet drinks, fun and warm water, that he was trying to move me so he could hug me or squeeze himself against me.\n\nJust when things were getting exciting, a boy I'd been friendly with at the snack bar joined the group of kids in the pool with a small brown-haired girl and somehow the excitement faded and we were all just chatting and laughing again.\n\nUntil, unexpectedly, the girl started to hug me, gently at first and then more eagerly, pressing herself into me. She smelled a bit like a campfire, but her lips were soft and curious and - I can't recall if I was brave and did it or she put my hand there - I was pushing my fingers into her pocket and through her jacket.\n\nGirls' bodies are just so different to boys'. Instead of a firm, thumping heart there was soft warmth, curls of hair, chubby bits, a gap ... . . I poked one finger into her pocket and she hummed into my ear, rubbing against me, pushing my hand deeper. For a while, I enjoyed these new feelings, but then I began to feel a bit unwell from her campfire scent, and all the sweet drinks made my head spin, so I decided to call it a day. Touching her was strange, and it didn't make me happy after my first try - like having to pet a snake when you'd rather hold a small animal (or the other way round, in this case). I got out of the water and dried off with some cloths the friend had put out, feeling cold in the late autumn night.\n\n'Henry' said he could bring me home but I chose to go with the brown-haired girl's friend instead, who was a very nice guy and left me at my house without even being upset that his car door was dirty. Nothing else happened, and I didn't want anything to. I felt very bad today - it's late afternoon and I still feel bad, even after eating a lot and drinking a lot of water. Who was that girl? Did she like girls? She really wanted me to be the only person she kissed, and I really wish she didn't smoke. I touched her a little because I wanted to know what it was like, and a little because she wanted me to, and I didn't know how to say no nicely. And if she hadn't gotten in the water, would I have been with 'Henry' right then and there, with people who were wearing all their clothes and watching? Not safe at all? Probably not, but it's a scary idea.\n\n_Late autumn day_\n\nI have to say I've never liked girls or even liked a teacher a lot. A while ago, I had a sleepover with my friend 'Alice'. She wanted me to kiss her, but it felt strange and not fun. The only time I felt different was at a dancing place. There, I met a girl from 'EE country' who smelled so nice and liked me. She kissed me and I really liked her. My body responded as I tried to kiss her. What if she had been the one in the hot tub?\n\nI had a dream last night that surprised me. A tall, pretty lady with short, blonde hair, big chest and a slim body came up to me, showed me her chest, kissed me hard and climbed on me, her bare chest in my face. Then I woke up early in the morning.\n\nIt is end of the week after all.\n\n_A day in late 20th century_\n\nI took my friend 'Benjamin' to see a show tonight, without saying it was a 'date'. We'd sent silly messages back and forth all day, ate dinner separately and met at the show place just before it started. The show was good, but a little sad. 'Typical,' I said during the break. 'A boy shares his feelings and opens up, then he feels silly and leaves the girl, never to be seen again.' Just like what happened with 'Cameron'. 'The girl, on the other hand, would be happy to love the boy, problems and all, but he vanishes.'Thomas interrupted me: 'Sometimes it's nice to need help.'\n\nI looked at him and he smiled. We will see, I think. We gave each other a small hug as we left.\n\n_Early in the morning_\n\nThomas is not here a lot, but he always has a fun story about his trips. When we walk to the main road together to get a sandwich for lunch or find something for school I feel safe and warm with him. I like his nice voice and the roughness on his face. But, oddly, he never seems to be able to come for that juice I've been promising him for helping with my project.\n\nHe is off to FR country for the weekend. I wonder if he has a friend there. I will have to wait for the right time to ask.\n\n_One morning_\n\nStill no word from Cameron, still so much he does on his friend-finding profile. Maybe he was just logging on to see what I was up to? Somehow I doubt it; he must have been talking to other girls and taking them on fun times ... . . showing them his funny books .. . giving them gifts ... . .\n\nSo, I did what any smart girl would have done in my place, and started making a 'different profile' for him, which talked about his not being nice, his not being warm, his way of leaving me confused instead of telling me it was all done. Nothing really mean from him - I might be funny but I am nice. And I wanted to tell any other lonely hearts who might be going into his trap.\n\nThe friend site knew what happened after a little while, stopped my profile and sent me a note about their 'rules' so I told them that Adam had broken some 'rules' too, by playing with others and then ignoring them.\n\n_Early December_\n\nI like Tall Boy but I don't know if I have a chance.\n\nJust sitting near him, laughing with him, and feeling excited is enough right now. He is smart, speaks many languages, always joking, and we practice our FR country, GE country and SP country in the place we work. He is helpful and I can ask him for help if I need it with something I am doing. He says nice things to me every time he sees me and seems interested in what I've done. Our lunches together are fun and playful, but I've not been able to find out more about his home life. I don't want to spend time on anything else. When I like someone this much I'd want it to be true, and not just something that happens and then goes away. I remember things for a long time - I don't want another sad thing. Even Adam left me a little upset when we could have just had a simple game. I can't keep my feelings away from anything, it seems.\n\nEither that or I've got a strange sort of coldness.\n\nHowever, I can't ignore how the room gets bright and happy on the days he is here. His being here fills me with a warm feeling that lasts all day and our playful talks make me laugh until my cheeks hurt. When he shows me something he's doing and I get close to him to see his picture, my senses are filled with his smell. I like him being so tall and strong - I breathe in when he breathes out and the thought that my arms would feel small in his hands makes me feel funny. I'd like to touch his curly hair like you'd touch a child's, but of course that wouldn't be right.\n\nEarly in the day \n\nHome from work early after a quick meal messed up my attempts to play nicely with Tall Boy over the printer - a short time (or maybe a long time) of being sick in the only bathroom didn't make him offer to see me home safely. He seemed worried but didn't get involved, which made me sad. What was I hoping for? My fun, simple work friend to turn into my knight in shining armor? Maybe a bit more action, that's for sure. 'Are you okay?' he asked when he came back from my boss's room to find me lying on the couch, looking very pale. 'Um, no,' I told him, feeling shy about my weakness. I can't expect him to leave everything and walk me home, knowing my boss's mood and the amount of work they have to get through. So I pretended I'd be fine and moved away, smelling a bit funny and feeling like my tummy had turned to scrambled eggs. So much for Sarah, office friend.\n\n_Early in December_\n\nHow to feel better when the boy you like doesn't like you back:\n\n  * Eat. This will make you feel happy for a little while, and it will also make you think more about your weight instead of silly boys.\n\n  * Read fun books, then rest. At least you know how to relax.\n\n  * Write a fun note on a new internet site and chat on the computer in the office while Tall Boy sits near you, minding his own business. Feel happy and reassured that he has no idea what he's missing.\n\n  * Don't ask him to eat lunch with you for the second day in a row. If he wants to eat lunch with you, let him do the asking. Stop asking your friend what he's doing on the weekend because he's always busy. And don't invite him for juice anymore - you only give him a chance to make an excuse.\n\n  * Go home early and watch cartoons. A good night's sleep and a relaxing day will make you even more cheerful the next morning, maybe making him change his mind.\n\nAt least I'm about to move to a new apartment, though. Hoping for the best.\n\n_One day in December_\n\nI just realized that this will be my second alone holiday since Peter, and now I'm crying a lot. I promised myself after the split that I'd never invite anyone home to celebrate holidays with my family again until they'd showed they really care about me, to avoid any more awkward moments with the family.\n\nThere's no one to share my bed now. This is the same bed where me and Ben had lots of fun, playing games and laughing a lot, his hair tickling my face, and the only words we shared were about how fun our games were and how good each hug felt.\n\nI miss my friend Ethan, the one before Peter. He was too young when we became friends and after three years, with him still living with his parents, I was getting a bit impatient. Looking back, I feel a little sad about being alone now because I miss the love I had.\n\nI miss the warm, cozy blanket in Patrick's bed, his head on my chest while he slept and I read my book, the cat sleeping on my feet.\n\nI miss the noisy birds and the early morning light that filled Cameron's big white bed. I miss looking at his messy blonde hair and seeing his blue eyes' first look at the new day and me.\n\nI miss being able to call someone just because they care about how I am. I miss sharing the happiness of good news - my job! My place! - and the struggles of sad times with someone.\n\nI've also decided to stop taking a medicine to see how I feel. I've been taking it for a long time to help my body. I'm interested to see if I'll still feel the same, and if I won't have bad headaches anymore. It's better not to take it at all, especially now that I'm not with someone, than to take it and then have to take medicine for pain three days a month.\n\n_Later_ :\n\nDetermined to feel better, I remembered the note I wrote on a new site, saying 'Nice Boy wanted'. This was inspired by the memory of Cameron's fancy voice and how it always made me feel. I've gotten five answers so far ... .\n\n_Early morning on a winter day_\n\nAll I want for the holiday:\n\n  * A fun game with all the how-to play instructions.\n\n  * Socks (from a fancy store).\n\n  * The movie a friend filmed of us dancing by the sea (probably not going to happen).\n\n  * A set of shields (for boys).\n\n  * A box of tissues (large size).\n\n  * Something in a special blue box.\n\n  * A version of a popular computer game where they actually do things grown-ups do, not just stand opposite each other going 'woo hoo!'\n\n  * A quiet tool to use on people playing loud music and smoking on the bus.\n\n  * A job with half the hours and double the pay.\n\n  * A cuddle.\n\n_A morning a few days later_\n\nAfter seeing me unwell, Big Boy got to see me crying at work. The bank's trying to make things difficult with my house loan. I don't need this just before I go away for the holiday. So much worry I couldn't do anything but cry by lunchtime. I really hope I look sweet when I cry, or Big Boy will be scared away after seeing me red-faced and upset, asking my current house owner for more time to stay.\n\n_The next morning_\n\nWhen I get home from work tonight I'm going to be busy packing my suitcase and wrapping presents for the holiday, but now I can just make the time to write about my little holiday cheer-me-up.\n\nI think that not having to take my daily medicine has made me feel happier and more adventurous. When I was at a party with my friends on Saturday, I noticed a shy-looking boy wearing a jumper who seemed a little out of place. He was tall and had a round tummy, but was still good-looking even though he looked a bit uncomfortable. I kept bumping into him when I went to dance or to get a drink, and finally, I went up to him and said hello. We had a fun little talk and I joked about his jumper, which he said was very popular at trendy winter holiday spots this year. After a while, one of my friends came to get me to dance, but I kept looking out for Jumper Boy.\n\nMy friends wanted to go home early but I wasn't sleepy yet, so when I saw Jumper Boy getting ready to leave I caught up with him to either say goodbye or try and convince him to stay a bit longer. He was happy to be caught and we left the party right away. Getting into a taxi, I asked the driver to take us to a nearby juice bar, but it was closed, sadly, so since I didn't want to go back to his house in FU town or wherever, I suggested another party place that I used to visit with my friend, Samantha.\n\nFor fun, I led him through a small door into a little 'secret room' in the party place, which wasn't much bigger than a large closet, with red comfy seats, a pole for dancing and interesting paintings on the walls of people in fancy costumes. A simple first aid kit, a small phone and two chocolate bars were his. I guessed he must need sugar, even though he was drinking sweet drinks and eating pies in the party room. I hope he wouldn't get really tired now!\n\nHe brought back two not very good drinks, so I suggested we go - he still promised me a surprise after all. We took a taxi to his home, and he told me it was messy. It was not tidy - he said he was cleaning it and since there was no bathroom he's using the kitchen sink for everything. Shaving, cleaning, brushing his teeth, making tea, washing himself ... . . Walking around the messy things were two of the most cute cats I'd ever seen.\n\nI sat on a couch filled with dirty clothes and he played with the cats and made us bacon sandwiches, mentioning he needs to keep his sugar up. It was very late and we ate the sandwiches - I hadn't eaten anything but pies and a few snacks since morning. There were lots of old furniture he'd got from buying or given, covered with mess and on dirty carpets. The cats were everywhere and it was nice when he lit candles and turned off the lights.\n\nWe went to bed where he tried to talk about the protection again because he 'doesn't like them'. Hard. I tried not to think about the things it meant - if he's that used to hugging without a shirt, doesn't that mean there's a close friend in the picture? I made him put on a shirt, and got my happy feeling very strongly, through all my favourite games, catch, tag and hide and seek. I made as much noise as possible to wake up the neighbours.\n\nGame won, I slept like a baby, cuddled in his arms, till early in the morning when the cats had a fight on my back. The next morning he was the perfect friend, making me tea as I sat on the sofa in one of his shirts, then coming to play with me and throw things for the cats to chase. It started to feel like more than a one-day playdate. We joked and played and he even told me some serious stuff about his family and life. He took me to a nearby food place for breakfast and told me about his health issue, doing his medicine in front of me - apparently he'd given medicine to his own wallet more than a few times!\n\nI had to leave and go to yet another holiday party, so after he'd walked me to the train where we said goodbye, I asked for his number. In return I got a food place loyalty card which he wrote his email address on.\n\n'Oh. So is the seventh playdate free?' I joked, and he laughed awkwardly. No name, huh? No last name as well.\n\n_Early Friday morning_\n\nI woke up early for my flight to my parents' home this morning, but it was made better by getting a ride from my home to the airport. I haven't written about him, but I've been spending some time with one of the boys who replied to my 'nice boy needed' message. We wrote to each other for a long time and I was attracted by his smarts, humor, and clear wish for a real friendship. The only problem was it took a long time to convince him to send me a picture of himself, and when one finally came it was unclear and he looked unhappy, which wasn't hopeful.\n\nEven though I was late to our first meeting, he waited for me for almost an hour, then after I said sorry a lot he made me happy during dinner, even if I thought I didn't like him. I thought he was a little bit chubby, to be honest, and a bit short for me - but I was just enjoying the talking and the 'connection'. He looked very interested in me and I started to like his green eyes and easy smile.\n\nWhen I got into his car this morning there were three of the books we'd talked about during dinner waiting for me on the seat. I'd warned I might be a bit grumpy that early in the morning but now I was smiling a lot about the books so he joked with me, 'I'm sad you're not more grumpy.' I forgot that I'm not good at waking up early.\n\nBut I've made a nice new friend, even if my friend, Jack, is scared by a silly girl with secret rooms and my tall friend, Thomas, doesn't seem to like me very much. I'll call him my friend, Kevin.\n\n_One sunny morning_\n\nWhat to do when you have a sleepover at your friend's house while staying with your mom:\n\n  * Don't drink too much juice.\n\n  * Don't forget to let her know you're okay if you stay up late.\n\n  * Try not to lose your house keys.\n\n  * When she opens the door for you in the morning, and she is worried, try to act nicely.\n\n  * Try to act not sleepy.\n\n  * Don't tell her exactly how many friends were at the house you stayed. Don't tell her it was just two - you and a friend whose last name you don't know.\n\n  * Mention the friend who dropped you off as if he's been your friend for a long time, known him sooo long!\n\n  * Pretend he was not sleepy when he drove you home.\n\n  * Say you lost your keys at the playground.\n\n  * Try to feel better from too much fun by drinking water with baking soda, without your mom seeing you.\n\n  * Pretend to your sister's boyfriend that you thought the guy was older than five.\n\n  * Happy New Day!\n\n_Early January_\n\nKevin Boy picked me up from the big building where planes land in his shiny car and we talked like old friends. I've got used to his smart, funny emails and great writing, and I could get used to his nice presence, his talking and his driving skills.\n\nWhat else has been happening? What's going to happen in this year? Well, Patrick has asked to meet up 'for a juice'. I shouldn't have told him about my new home. Maybe he thinks I have lots of toys and can pay for his pilot's hat? Or maybe he misses the fun games? I may meet up with him, or not. Now there's a thought.\n\nBenjamin Boy has been in touch too. I haven't seen him since spring. He now has that playroom he'd been wanting.\n\nNothing from Thomas Boy.\n\n_Mid January_\n\nI hadn't even hugged Kevin Boy and yet he moved all of my old home's things down two flights of stairs and into a big car, rode across the city with me, then moved everything up two more flights of stairs into the new home.\n\nWe were talking about friendships, and I moaned that whenever things go well (and I get lots of gifts) it all disappears. 'Would you like to have fun for a short time or not at all?' he asked me, with a grin, and I was puzzled. How do you answer that? A little is better than none, I guess, but if it could be without any sadness, that would be better. There needs to be some kind of comfort when your fun time is over, otherwise the world feels lonely and unhappy.\n\nSo I asked him, 'Would you like to be left at the beginning, or after a short and silly time?' He picked the silly time, with a chance to be friends afterwards. 'It's about feeling good,' he explained, and I remembered this.\n\n_Early in the morning, in the middle of winter_\n\nI am being really liked. What would you say to someone who is really liking, and spending time with, someone who looks a bit like a round man without the mustache? That was what I thought of Kevin when he pulled up outside my new house in his 'very silly' (his words) car, his bouncy hair brushed back and split in the middle where it had dried after his morning wash.\n\nLess than half a day after a tiring trip to a big furniture shop, I spent time with his round self, my mind a mix of feelings and my body already happy from his quick but good hug earlier (when I took the chance of messing up his hair to get rid of the strange look). I had jumped on him after the last box was safely inside, really wanting him.\n\nI'm not exactly _sad_ about him, but a little. Does that make sense? Does it make me not good? Even though I really like all his good points, I can't help but wonder what others think when they see us together. OK, I'm not the thinnest girl in town but I'm tall, with light hair and nice clothes and there he is with his neat clothes and big belly. Do they think, 'She must be with him for his money'? He looks much older than he is, thanks to the clothes and his belly, even though he's a little younger than me.\n\nWhat's my problem? Let's look at the good and bad points:\n\n**Good:**|  **Bad:**  \n---|---  \nHe can help at any time.| Well, he's a bit heavy. Hmm.  \nHe truly cares about me.| Yes.  \nHis touch is amazing.| Is there something else?  \nHe smells and tastes good.| He doesn't wear t-shirts?  \nHe gives me nice drink in costly places.| I'm taller than him when I wear heels?  \nHis humor and sarcasm.| He can't dance or sing?  \nHe wears soft clothes but I don't think of the soft clothes.| That's it.  \nHe really listens and remembers everything I say.|   \nHe likes to surprise me with gifts.|   \nHis writing.|   \nHis ability to make me feel better.|   \nHis patience.|   \nHe loves little kids.|   \nA gentleman in an old style.|   \nHe is grown up.|\n\n_Early in the week_\n\nLast night, Kevin took me to his home for the first time, more by chance than plan - we were both hungry and passing, and he said he'd cleaned the place. It's nicely decorated, with books everywhere and interesting small objects and, on his wall, two pictures of him with some girl.\n\nI knew who she was right away. The old girlfriend.\n\nAnd I got that bad feeling in my tummy as though I'd gone down in a lift from happiness to the basement. My hunger went away and I just wanted to go home, preferably right now, before I cried. I just wanted to be back in my own room, alone, with my shopping, which was still in his car.\n\nI've known him for a short time and I can't say anything about what he puts on his walls or to what's in his heart, but this felt like a mean surprise. I've tried not to feel this scared, not for many months, and I've not done well often, but not because I didn't try. Here it was, looking at me.\n\nI remember Peter's old friend, smiling at me from the icebox, the bookshelf, the top of the furniture, the hall table ... . . of course, she 'was not important' but if I hid the photos they'd come back by my next visit, like magic.\n\n'Peter,' I tried to sound happy, 'who are the people in the photos?'\n\n'Oh, that's my brother, and that's my dad and mum, and that's my grandma, and, oh, that's me and my old friend.'\n\nHis kisses made me feel strange. I ate the food he'd made and drank the juice, talking about little things and trying to want to eat again while her annoying face looked at the back of my neck from the wall.\n\n'I have this silly rule,' I finally said, as he hugged me and kissed me again, 'but may I have another piece of bread first?' He looked confused as he went to cut the bread and watched me eat it quietly. He made a guess and got it wrong and started to look sad, as if he thought I didn't like him anymore.\n\n'I don't sleep at men's houses where there are still photos of their old friends on the wall.'\n\nAdam was surprised when he understood what the pictures meant. My eyes started to water and I tried to change the subject with a joke. He told me the pictures 'weren't important' and he just hadn't found time to remove them - everything I'd heard from Peter. The same words. But then he said, 'You know, if I saw her now she'd walk the other way,' unlike Peter, who said, 'She's like a sister.'\n\nI tried to tell him not to worry about me too much. I excused myself to the bathroom, where I took some deep breaths and calmed myself.\n\nWhen I came back to the room, he showed me his hands full of torn pictures. He put them in the bin with a big motion, dusting his hands when he was done.\n\nI let him take me home and enjoyed his wonderful hands and kisses again. Since my walls don't have any pictures, I was able to clear my mind for a bit. I asked him to leave just before bedtime.\n\nWorried, me?\n\n_A nice day_\n\nThoughts of my friend that I can't forget today:\n\n  * His hands on my legs and my back at the party, looking for my ribbon and sock tops.\n\n  * His face turning into a smile as I touch his cheeks with soft mittens.\n\n  This text is inappropriate and not suitable for children. It contains explicit adult content.\n\n  * Coming, coming close to me.\n\n  * Falling and hugging me.\n\n  * Telling me he likes me a lot.\n\n  * The world.\n\nStill in his clothes.\n\n_One sunny day_\n\nI had my new home party yesterday and invited both Thomas and Kevin, because, well, why not? I do still like Thomas but I'm fond of my fancy friend. Thomas got a bit tipsy on the drinks Kevin made with my special holiday juice (so much for the boy who says he never drinks them) and they played a friendly game. Thomas would playfully tap the wall, showing off, and Kevin would kindly refill my cup, staying close, holding my hand. They also joked around a bit, then Thomas tried to convince my new friend to go dancing 'until morning' - but she stayed in anyway.\n\nTo be honest, I didn't mind if Thomas kissed her, or if he saw me holding hands with Kevin, or the way Kevin was acting the host, getting drinks and hanging up coats - Thomas has been so unsure. And Kevin knows how to behave like a boy and a kind one too. Although I did feel like telling him to just relax and let people get their own drinks.\n\nEveryone took their shoes off which had the unexpected bonus that when people spilled their drinks their socks soaked it up.\n\nNora left early in the morning, and as she was putting on her shoes in my room, she had to comment on Kevin's looks. 'Sophia, really - _him_?' she whispered to me. She saw us holding hands and didn't understand. 'Yes, I like him,' I told her, annoyed at her words. 'He is kind, smart, very helpful, he can cook, I love talking to him .. . . ' 'Sure, but in the _room_?' she made it sound like I was with a big scary monster. 'All good,' I replied, upset at her. Did she think he tricked me into liking him? She wouldn't have been so negative if he was a tall handsome boy with no brains. Why can't she just be happy for me?\n\nAfter Nora left, I guided everyone down the road to a fun place, carrying cups of juice, leaving Tall Boy to chat with my friend, and got them all to play 'I have never'.\n\nI told everything.\n\n'Someone has not hugged this week,' someone said. I drank.\n\n'Someone has not hugged on a boat.' I drank again.\n\n'Someone has not hugged in a place.' 'What kind of place?' I asked the laughing crowd, then drank again. Kevin had a drink and said something surprising. We all laughed!\n\nThen we talked about doing something every day for a week. I joked, \"Wouldn't you get tired by the fifth day?\" Everyone laughed again.\n\nLet's celebrate! Here's to new homes and new friends!\n\n_Later_ :\n\nPatrick called me to plan for a coffee meeting. I was surprised because I didn't save his number. I told him I removed his number. We had a nice talk and might meet when he finishes his busy week.\n\n_One day_\n\nOne morning, I woke up happy in Kevin's bed, and walked to his bathroom wearing his big pyjamas. I thought he was in the living room, but he was in the bathroom with the lights off - maybe he went to the bathroom in the dark so he wouldn't wake me up? I don't know, but I was so surprised that I screamed, then slipped on the wet floor, and he reacted quickly, grabbing me and hugging me to make me feel better. I hugged him tightly, his coat smelled like him and his soap. \n\nI felt peaceful and happy, even though we had stayed up late and after a confusing evening. There was something I needed to share. I wondered, which is trickier? Not spending time with boys who aren't ready to settle down when you are, or telling the boy you're spending time with that you can't see people who aren't serious anymore because you've decided you're done with casual friendships and want to start a family?\n\nThe fact that my heart gets attached every time I'm close to someone surprised me. Sharing it with someone I'd only known for a few weeks was a bit of a shock. But his response made me feel better. He stayed calm and listened, comforting me and gently touching my back, even though I was upset.\n\nMy sudden mood shift was because I was feeling a bit off. Every so often, Ben would make sure everything was okay, which disrupted the flow and made me feel frustrated. Pausing every few seconds when I'm so close, _so close_, frustrated me. My patience wore thin.\n\nIt's funny that such a wonderful, kind and smart person is so worried about things being just right, while some not-so-nice people don't worry at all about these things!\n\nI turned when he came and lay there feeling sad. He was worried and then sorry and listened to me. I felt better and it was okay. He says he wants children, but he's too careful to try even a little bit of dangerous behavior, and now that carefulness has taken away my happiness.\n\n8\n\n**Be My Pal**\n\nEARLY IN THE YEAR\n\n_A Nice Day_\n\nI am so happy.\n\nFunny that. You know, all Adam's wonderful qualities are in a body you'd never see on the front of a simple magazine, but I am blissfully, happily falling in love with him.\n\nHe came over on a weekend day to help me take care of the little boy I sometimes look after and we had lots of fun at the playground and at the swimming pool in 'baby soup' with all the other children, even though Adam says he's neither sporty nor likes water. He was great with the little one and seemed to truly enjoy himself.\n\nI felt a bit emotional when a thought came to me all at once: 'I've always wanted children before I'm older,' I said sadly to Adam, 'and now I just realized that won't happen.' 'You'll be a great mom,' he told me, looking at me lovingly with my friend's son.\n\nWe dried and went back to my place for some food, then watched the TV until the child's mother came to get him. Then us grown-ups went to bed, even though it was only snack time.\n\nHe gave me a gentle hug and we had a quiet chat before getting ready for a friend's party that evening.\n\nHe drove and I was looking at a simple map while drinking some apple juice. We listened to a children's song and were laughing all the way. The party was quiet but fun - one couple had even brought their dog along, and there was a boy from FR country at the 'refreshment stand' making a nice apple juice - but after I'd tripped over in my big boots and Kevin had gotten tired, we decided it was time to go home.\n\nSunday morning was lovely: a long, lazy wake-up and more chatting before breakfast and a shopping trip, and he turned out to be as good at finding deals as I am. That evening, as promised, he'd made me chocolate mousse (with real chocolate!) which we ate on the sofa, holding a cup of milk each. He gave me a foot massage and we chatted until it was very late. I stayed at school for an extra hour by myself because I didn't want to ride my bike home while upset. Then I got chips, dip, green veggies, and a bottle of juice from the store and sat in front of the TV to watch a show. I didn't bother to cook the veggies, just dipped them and munched.\n\nKevin came to find the bottle almost empty and me very full. I don't think anything I said was very clear. All I knew was that the next morning he was going to meet a friend to give back a chair and some other stuff. Normal stuff really, but it all seemed bigger because I was upset, the part I try to keep hidden most of the time.\n\nKevin comforted me and massaged my feet until I gave him a big hug and we giggled a lot, making noises (I was too silly to be quiet and too happy to care). The show ended and I fell asleep before remembering to drink water. Woke up late still in my clothes (Kevin didn't bother to change either).\n\nOn Saturday he saw his friend then came back to me for more shopping and fun, and we tried to go to a cafe in his neighborhood, but his messy hair was so bad that the staff didn't notice us, so we went to a different place down the road.\n\nYou had to press a button and wait to get in, and then go down some stairs to a room where there was music, a silly man and two girls, one in a fancy top and the other in a shiny dress. They didn't have lots of things for the drinks listed, and when we finally chose the right juice the man put them in with lots of ice. Every boy who came in gave me a funny, curious look - or three. What was this place?\n\nAdam and I, talking softly to each other in a corner, clearly didn't belong there, so after a drink we went home to rest and sleep close together.\n\nSunday was a day of many feelings. Adam woke up before me and went to the living room to look at cookbooks while I continued to sleep, spread out on his comfortable sheets. After my second dream about something scary, work, or other things I don't like, I got up to join him, sitting on the sofa in his big night clothes. I felt a bit unwell, but my tummy felt better after he gave me some orange juice, coffee, and made a big breakfast. All I had to do was smile (which was easy, because I was very happy), look nice and read a book about a mistake. I couldn't focus on anything because I was suddenly sure I was going to have a baby. We had been careful, but sometimes things can still happen, especially when things don't go as planned.\n\nAdam noticed that I was quiet and asked me what was wrong. 'I just worry about what any boy would worry about when his friend is not feeling well,' he said. So, I admitted that I was thinking the same thing, even though I felt shy to admit it. 'My monthly cycle is usually regular,' I said, but thinking that maybe it had not returned to normal since I stopped taking some medicine. He just held my hand and said he'd be there for me. He was very calm, even when I quietly said that we'd only known each other for a short time. Then he told me he had enough money to take care of a family, and I shouldn't worry.\n\nHe suggested getting a test to see if I was going to have a baby. We drove to a store that was open all night so we could find out and help me feel better. When we got back to my place and the test said I wasn't going to have a baby, I was surprised at how sad I felt. Adam seemed very happy, which was strange because he didn't seem worried about becoming a dad.\n\nAnd I got my monthly cycle this morning.\n\nHere's a list of reasons why I never had a baby with an old friend:\n\n* 'You can have babies', but as I was just a teenager I got scared and took a medicine. Twice. (Mean first boyfriend, long time ago)\n\n  * 'Let me give you a hug .. . . ' (anyone, any time)\n\n  * 'You will never find a young guy who will want to marry you and want to have babies.' (Nice Ex, long time ago)\n\n  * 'Not until I'm very rich! School costs a lot!' (Patrick, some years ago)\n\n  * 'I am not ready yet.' (Old boyfriend, many years ago)\n\n  * 'If you have a baby we are in trouble.' (I'd told him I'd forgotten my medicine but he still didn't wear something. This from a man who'd already helped two old girlfriends: Patrick, some years ago)\n\n  * 'I can't believe she finished school and then had a baby. She is wasting her learning.' (Said by Peter of a married friend with a very cute baby and another one coming)\n\n  * 'Babies are loud, smelly and cost a lot.' (Said Patrick, who didn't mind spending a lot on drinks and stuff, snored loudly and only cleaned his teeth when told)\n\n'I am going to spend a lot of time and effort to become a pilot.' (The Book, 2005)\n\n'I have an illness.' (The Book, 2005)\n\nNo worries then ... .\n\n_On a winter day_\n\nI had to work in the evening on a special day (don't ask - my boss has a lot of big projects) and I was worried about asking Ben what we'd do, not wanting to sound like a needy friend, but even though he said the day was overhyped and silly, he treated me to a special lunch.\n\nWhen I was done at work late at night he picked me up in his car with a bottle of soda and drove me home to 'play on the sofa'. He told me he'd been thinking about me a lot over the weekend and when I bent over the arm rest and offered him a toy, he said, 'That was one of them.'\n\nHe'd been worried that we didn't have any balloons, because he thought that women become mothers right after their periods, but I put him straight. I know my body pretty well and have always felt when I'm not well, to the point that I know which side is not well. As well as counting the fourteen to fifteen days from the beginning of my period, I closely monitor the changes my body goes through by keeping an eye on how I feel. One of my parents' books told me about this in a simple way. It said that dry, white stuff that sticks to my fingers shows a time that is safe from making a baby. But if I can pull clear gooey stuff wide between my fingers, it means I can make a baby. Kevin may be right about being safe, and I should respect that. I thought he would stop just before feeling really good but then I felt him feeling really good deep inside me. A wonderful feeling, but not right.\n\nLast year on a special love day, I was with Cameron, and that was when he told me he didn't mind if I was with other people. The year before that was with Patrick, when I was trying to ignore a bad feeling. He made easy food for me at home on the day before the special love day, then cooked for his ex on the special love day, when I thought he was working. He ended our special day by calling me by her name. I felt better by eating the good food and giving him a special treat. Who said love is gone?\n\n_Early in the year_\n\nI wanted to write, but I forgot and I'm tired. There are now three sets of keys on my key ring:\n\nMy own.\n\nThe office's.\n\nKevin's.\n\nA person from work asked me and a friend to a special music show at RO place last night. It's a better view than seeing something silly - Porsche Boy's favorite game position (do you remember him?)\n\nBenjamin likes it when I hold his head and press it to my face. It made me feel so happy, squirming with joy. I enjoy the tickling feeling of his short hair on my soft skin, it's so fun, the most exciting thing. He said nice things about me - why do boys always say that? How are other girls? Am I a strawberry in a sack of potatoes, a juicy, sweet, wonderful surprise? - and made me feel happy again, working hard for it. Then he covered me up in his sleeping clothes and petted me to sleep.\n\nThis morning he made a big breakfast and I was two hours late to kindergarten. Ah well. Teacher wasn't in ... . .\n\n_Early Saturday morning_\n\nThe other night we hugged each other while watching a famous drama. He has started to pat me lightly if I ask him, and sometimes if I don't.\n\nI want him to be really happy when he hugs me, to let me feel how heavy he is, for him not to hold back, to play with me, to be free and to hold me. We play with words: 'What if I didn't let you?'\n\n'What if I tried to anyway?'\n\n'What if I tried to push you off?'\n\n'What if you couldn't?'\n\nHe always tells me he wouldn't do anything I didn't want him to, which changes the game a bit, but sometimes he acts more bossy than I've ever known, and I like it.\n\n'I want you to help me,' he says.\n\n'When?' I ask, teasing him.\n\n'Now,' he replies quickly. I ask him to say please, and he does. Ha!\n\nSometimes he holds my head when I help him. He touches me, and it feels nice, making both of us happy. He won't let me tell him when to do something. He likes the surprise. Sometimes I touch him lightly, teasing him. He gets more excited than if I pull or push. He does get less excited with gloves though ... . .\n\nYes, we're sometimes now playing without gloves when it's 'safe'. It's much less annoying than him being less excited all the time and pulling the glove up. We've both been checked. We're OK. I know it's silly, or is it? All nice things are silly. Eating sweets. Riding on a bike without a helmet. Wearing a dress when you're riding a horse. Swimming in the dark.\n\n_Early Sunday morning_\n\nI hope that closeness didn't make me want to run far away; I hope I could put all my feelings, emotional and physical, in one place and feel calm.\n\nAm I ready to spend all that time with one person? Can the happiness beat the fear? Why don't I meet Sailor, or have that juice with Pilot, or reply to Rugby Boy's messages with something more playful? I'm inviting trouble.\n\nSome boy I gave my number to a while back has been messaging, but I haven't replied. Yet. I wasn't really interested in him but now I think I should do something.\n\nWhat's Cameron up to? Has he moved on to a different girl? Most probably. Or a boy. My inner detective suggests watching outside his house, or ringing the door bell. I had a dream where I went to a party at his house while he was away, and his friends all welcomed me in, and I roamed around the place and mingled with the crowd. I felt oddly alone when I woke up.\n\nLast time I was at Kevin's he went out and left me alone, and I jokingly threatened to explore the place. I did. I found a notebook but had trouble reading the handwriting in it. I thought one entry was titled 'silly thoughts' but then I looked again and it said, 'work meetings'.\n\nMy tummy felt funny as I searched and explored, but not like when I discovered Patrick's hidden tricks. I know I'm a mischievous girl, but I've had problems before and now I'm looking for signs of trouble.\n\n_Early last week_\n\nPatrick and I played all day yesterday. We played on my bed in the morning, and then, because I could hear my friend sniffling and coughing next door, on a blanket on the floor to not disturb her with the bed noise. We played lots of games. I fell asleep hugging him until lunch time, when he cooked me breakfast.\n\nI felt so close to him, always touching, kissing, talking, his eyes filled with so much love and feelings that I had to make a silly comment and laugh it off before I said something more serious. I felt like a puddle. I ran a bath after breakfast, and welcomed him covered in a bunch of bubbles, then started massaging him and tickling him with a sponge and we played a gentle game that didn't make any mess.\n\nThen I turned on the shower and showed him my back and we played standing under the water, kneeling, standing, slipping a little on the sides of the bath. Then we put a towel over the rug and played there, me looking up at the bottom of the sink, lying between the hard floor and his soft weight, our skin still wet and the shower getting cold. I was so full of happiness and feeling so much, and when he hugged me tightly without even thinking, he held me strong with the kindest look on his face. I didn't want him to stop. I was happy again, and he let go and was happy too.\n\nThe more I get to know him the more I like him, and the more I find we have in common - our adventures, our feelings, our hopes. I talked my friend's ear off telling her about Kevin, and probably made her tired.\n\nOnly I _must not_ let him make me sad. I agree, I'm acting silly, we're not in the 'right place' to be doing this and I'm a silly, funny girl for letting my feelings carry me away. I want to be careful. I don't want to be careful. But I'm getting annoyed with this tricky business with being careful and feelings that go away when you think about them, and the fact that he only was happy twice in the two days of fun playing. I want him to be happy seven times too.\n\n_Early in the week_\n\n'Having a toy together is a big promise, it's just not the right time yet,' he told me on the phone. 'If I said \"let's play house tomorrow\" you'd run away.'\n\n'Give me some praise,' I giggled. The idea made me happy, but clearly not him. I'd just suggested we stop having sleepovers, because it confuses me a lot.\n\n'Is this the \"let's just be buddies\" time?' he asked.\n\n'No way!'\n\n'The thing is,' he continued, 'even though I don't want to be too close every time I see you, we end up being so.'\n\n'Yes, you can't avoid it.'\n\nNeither can I.\n\n_Early in the year_\n\n'I like you just as you are,' he said during dinner at his place when I made a comment about my shape and dessert.\n\n'You do?' I focused on my food.\n\n'I like you just as you are,' he repeated, louder, while I looked at my snack dropping slowly off my fork.\n\n'I see,' I replied, with the biggest smile ever.\n\nLater, when we were close, he whispered in my ear:\n\n'What's your wildest dream?'\n\n'I can't really tell you.'\n\n'Please do.'\n\n'What if .. ' I kept my real wildest dream to myself and thought of another, 'What if you walked into your place's library and found me there, surrounded by three boys who introduced me to you.' Maybe we won't play pretend this time.\n\n_One late winter day_\n\nThis morning I had a bad dream. I dreamt Kevin had gotten back together with his old girlfriend and I found them together, cuddled up with no room for me. He acted all distant and told me he 'had to try again' with her. I cried, then planned my helpless revenge - helpless because I can't change someone's feelings. She was, of course, fancier than me, fancier than him even. I woke up early and couldn't go back to sleep.\n\nIs this a warning dream, like the ones I had about Peter's old girlfriend? I didn't go to sleep unhappy. Well, not really. I'd had a mixed weekend which was a mix of happy times and being a couple with Kevin, and then being left alone when he'd gone home because of his sniffles, and trying to call friends to see if they wanted to play with me and getting no answer. What was he doing the rest of the weekend? Am I losing friends because I'm so focused on him? I wish I wasn't always wanting attention and could spend my time with nice, non-romantic friends instead of seeking comfort by chasing boys.\n\nHe ended things with his old girlfriend in the late autumn. We started writing to each other in the early winter.\n\nI like having him at my house - it's fresh and new, without past memories. I think of a girl in his bed, his bathroom, on his couch, her eating from the same plate that my homemade breakfasts are served on. Her legs around his head, her clothes in a drawer somewhere, her hand on the key that now hangs on my key ring.\n\nSometimes, I wish I could stop thinking for a while. It'd be easier to not think so much. This feeling of being left keeps coming back in my thoughts and life. I need a way to escape.\n\n_Early March_\n\nToday, I dressed up for work, for Tall Boy. Is this wrong? I wanted to look nice for him, even though the weather was bad and even though he's seen me with KB and told me he thinks KB is a good guy, and even though he's given me _no_ signs that he likes me, if you don't count the playful looks he gives me from his green eyes and the way he jokingly annoys me.\n\nThe problem is, he thinks we're different.\n\nHe likes Rock music, I like House music. He likes beer, I like fancy drinks. He likes to hang out at simple places with his friends and have fun, I like fancy places and calm weekends that he finds showy. But why should that be important?\n\nAdam has always said no to any ideas that we should play outside again, even though he did send me a message early in the morning once when he was 'near my place' (and I was sleeping next to Ben) and talked to me one night about a party, which he then missed. When I was not feeling well at school, he didn't even help me get a car.\n\nDoes this mean I'm not deep? He doesn't act very nicely to me, and yet I'm attracted to his looks and charm. But then again, Ben has made me forget all my thoughts about looks and size because even though he's not tall, big and hairy, he makes my back (and other parts) feel funny with excitement and my mind spin with his humor and smarts. He really is something special. I like my lunches with Tall Boy, but I'm not sure what his other problems are. He talked about cleaning his house recently and how much stuff from his old friend he still found around. It seems like they became friends too soon and it didn't end well. I'll have to try and ask him about it one day, as there seems to be more to it. This could be why he's always trying to enjoy his single life to the max, and his hesitance to get a new friend - maybe he's been hurt just as I have?\n\n_On a Friday in early March_\n\nIn any friendship, if things are going to grow and you're going to get more close, there are little problems that you have to think about - and solve. Ideally the bad things are less than the good things. Here are mine:\n\n_Ideally_ - he would be very excited as soon as things got 'fun'. This excitement would not go away until he has had fun, played with me and made me very happy (i.e. him playing with me, then moving closer to me without pause, just before I feel very happy, then playing with me energetically until we both feel very happy).\n\n_In reality_ - he doesn't always feel excited. When he does, he takes a long time to feel very happy. This problem is directly related to something, which often seem to stop him feeling very happy at all, or cause him to feel less excited. Sometimes it takes a lot of time for me to make him feel excited, and I'm trying very hard for a long time.\n\nLuckily, he doesn't mind if he doesn't feel very happy, although I do and it makes me feel sad and not pretty. He always makes sure I do feel very happy, be it with a toy, two fingers, or his mouth. He won't continue playing with me if I've felt happy and want to stop. He is very loving and says, 'It will get better. Sorry. This is just me.\n\nI think it might have something to do with his old friend.\n\nActually, now I feel a bit silly and I'm happy I wrote this down. I should not worry and just be happy when I'm with him. I like him a lot, I really like him a lot and he treats me very nicely. So, quiet down, little voices!\n\n_Early March Saturday_\n\nI told Jessica about my wish to have a baby in an email, and she typed back, 'What's the hurry? Don't some women have babies when they are very old?'\n\nWell, maybe some do, but I don't want to be one of them. Also, I have a few health problems that mean it's going to be difficult for me to have a baby, and even more difficult when I get older than thirty-four when doctors say it gets harder to have a baby. So that only gives me a few years to start, especially if I want to have more than one baby.\n\nAnd I've known I want them for a long time. I've always been around children, I've spent twenty-two years taking care of them for other people. It's been stronger in the last three years - the wish in my tummy is very strong. When I was very happy with old friend, I seriously thought about it, although I'm happy I didn't now, otherwise I'd have a baby with a very young person, and that baby would have two parents with no money.\n\nSo there _is_ a rush, actually, especially when I spent a lot of time on Sweet Toy, some months on Puppet and now more time trying to find the good from the bad with these friends. Not a simple task at times, especially when your thoughts are filled with the need for love and sad memories of the past, and your big imagination lets you see your friends in the best light. No wonder I can't stop the small voices.\n\n_One spring day_\n\nAdam has been away with his dad to look at houses in another place, but I haven't heard from him at all. Not even a message. Maybe his phone doesn't work in the other place, but his dad must have one that does - he's got a wife and two little kids at home. Did Adam forget to take my number? That doesn't make any sense. Five days. Five whole days, after a lot of calling and messaging and warmth and liking.\n\nIt makes me feel a bit bad, which is not nice because I'm getting over one of the worst stomach aches known to girls ('Oh, maybe it's because I ate something bad!' I thought, even though I'd been feeling sick for the past three days).\n\nNow I'm back at work, feeling sick and driving myself mad with too many thoughts, making a meeting with that random boy who kept on messaging, and thinking about talking to Jumper Boy from the club's 'secret room'. Anything to stop remembering those last few weeks with Patrick - seeing the pictures of him and his old friend on the trip they took in SP country, while I was at home, taking care of his silly cat. Also, the memory of sending that picture of my cat to Cameron in NE city and getting no answer - NE city being the place where his old friend lived. Never seeing Cameron again and thinking of him all the time ... . .\n\nI know that if I'm worried and unsure I could make David leave; my few months with him are nothing compared to a long time with his old friend. But still, five days?\n\n_A day in March_\n\nI had a fun evening last night. With that random friend.\n\nWhen I got home after work David had already called twice and left messages with my friend. I checked my phone, and yes, he'd called that too. Twice. No message though. I ignored it and got ready to go out, angry but happy he wasn't gone after all. To be honest, I wasn't really excited for the fun evening with Random Friend, but I had to do something to keep me from getting too upset.\n\nI waited for him for a long time at EU station, before calling Random and asking the name of the eating place, like a boss: 'The station is cold and it smells. I can't wait here much longer.' Turns out he was in the station waiting for me, at another exit.\n\nHe was very sorry about the delay, and very kind. We found the food place and had some good food, talking was easy. We talked about where we come from, our families, jobs, homes, the things we like to do, and so on. All I could think about was Kevin. I asked Ryan if he'd had any fun friend-meetings lately. He said no, and asked me the same.\n\n'Do you remember what I said before, that I'm kind of friends with someone?' I started to explain that this didn't stop me meeting other boys for dinner, since I wasn't in a serious friendship. Ryan seemed to agree, although I couldn't help feeling sad about it.\n\nThis boy didn't deserve to have his time wasted by a girl who had given her heart to another boy. And Kevin might not deserve someone who spends time with someone else after five days of no phone calls. But then again, why am I feeling bad?\n\nKevin hasn't even officially asked me to be his special girl friend. I don't control who he spends his evenings with or who he invites to dinner. Two of his past special girl friends tried to make him marry, and at least he knows I won't do that if I'm out meeting other potential good friends. How can you be unfair to someone with whom you have no agreement? A harmless dinner can be just that, harmless - making friends before you even think about getting close, although didn't I try that before?\n\nTo be honest and faithful to my ideas, I need to keep exploring before deciding - although Kevin and I may take some time for that. I still believe it's silly to be loyal without a real promise, but I don't want to keep wondering about the possibilities or if this is going to last forever. I just want to be sure, for once.\n\nAnyway, I sent Kevin a short message as I was going back to my house, after noticing two more calls from him and a very nice message. I wrote, 'I didn't think you knew how sad I was for not hearing from you all week.'\n\nI finally felt calm enough to call him back this afternoon and he called me right away. I really didn't know what to say. His reason seemed believable but not good: he forgot his charger at home. He couldn't get my number from his phone. He couldn't find a phone store or a computer caf in the very country place he was stuck in.\n\nHe said sorry many times, and asked me to go to IT country 'next time'. He told me all about his journey and listened to my stories of being ill and work worries and everything else he didn't know about.\n\nBut he didn't say anything about seeing each other this weekend.\n\nSo, I have made other plans. Sort of. I'm going out with Nora tonight and hope to be busy tomorrow too. Not sure if he wants to do more saying sorry, but he needs to think of _something_ to make it right.\n\n_On a sunny day_\n\nIn short, Kevin and I became friends again.\n\nIn a bigger story - like a big nut - with more details? He bought me lunch and we went to HA park with two soft blankets and a bottle of juice and had fun and laughed until it was dark. I told him about Random Boy and he said that in that case, he wouldn't have been mad at me if I had been friends with him after last week.\n\nAs we watched the sun go down things became a little more playful. We played tickles under the blanket. 'You always laugh when you're with me' - something he says a lot. I couldn't play back because people were walking around and they would have noticed what we were doing. And my hands were very cold, which probably wouldn't have helped.\n\nWe were playing and having fun, hugging me tightly and I lay back, looking up at the dark sky through the tree branches above me.\n\nWe started to feel cold by then (I wasn't wearing any socks) so we packed up the remains of our juice picnic and walked hand in hand through the dark park until we found a taxi outside the gate. I think it's a special time for me.'\n\nHe should have known. It's not a good idea to be close with a girl who's feeling very emotional and admits to wanting a little one very much. He knows my monthly routine but chose to ignore it. I suggested him to not be careful and he agreed. We are both well and haven't been close with many people, and love being comfortable together. And I guess his understanding reaction to our last 'problem' encouraged me to take a risk with a boy I've known for a short period. He _does_ keep telling me he's very mature, and not to worry. He _did_ suggest the idea that he could handle a surprise little one, financially and emotionally.\n\nHe feels so wonderful when we're close and I love the feeling of trusting him fully, but now I'm the one deciding. And I don't like it. I'd rather not be in this situation. I'd rather be with a caring, long-term friend in a steady relationship where I can look forward to what might happen when we're close on the day I feel special.\n\nI asked Kevin when he thinks he'd be ready for little ones.\n\n'When he's thirty,' he told me, so that's three years. I'll be thirty-three.\n\nI don't want to wait that long. I can't.\n\nI don't want to lose him either. I don't want to feel strange because of too many feelings. I want to stop worrying about getting older. I don't want to take care of a child by myself. I don't want to take medicine in the morning because it makes me feel sick. I don't like knowing that it can stop a baby from growing.\n\nWhat else don't I like? Worrying that things won't work out. Feeling upset and stressed. Being with possibly the best boy I have met in a long time and having to make big choices.\n\nI wish I had slept more last night.\n\nI am happy I can talk to him about all this, because no one else understands. And he is very sorry for making things difficult for me.\n\n_Early morning_\n\nAs the morning medicine works, I wonder if I was sharing too much, telling David when it was time for the medicine and actually swallowing it.\n\nHonestly, I'm very scared of what might happen next.\n\nA sailor sent me a message, on his way to CA country. He said he'd spent the last few months sailing around some warm islands, lucky guy. We had a little argument over the phone and didn't talk for a while until last night. We still have that easy friendship where we can share everything, yet there's a special feeling. It wouldn't cause a problem if either of us had a best friend though.\n\nHe's a fellow thoughtful person too, so I sent him a message about my problem.\n\n_Me_ : 'I'm still thoughtful, but dating an older boy.'\n\n_Him_ : 'What's tricky about an older boy? Was meeting a girl from a faraway country during my journey and she may join me in that country. Not sure.'\n\n_Me_ : 'Well, he's really nice but not ready for a family. People from faraway countries are nice, good luck!' (I thought of Faraway Boy and Friend.)\n\n_Him_ : 'Thank you, but the girl from the faraway country is not funny, sadly. She does want a family though so I may have to adjust.'\n\n_Me_ : 'Sad to have to adjust. I have fun friends but also have to think about tomorrow. Things aren't always perfect.'\n\n_Him_ : 'Ha. I understand. Hope it goes well for you. Sometimes we have to adjust our dreams. As we grow, they get harder to achieve.'\n\nMaybe, but it's hard to let them go ... . .\n\n_Early in the morning_\n\nI wonder if Alice and I even speak the same language.\n\nShe says, 'I think you are too young for me, we may want different things.'\n\nHe says, 'How can you say that? I'm very grown up.'\n\nShe thinks, great, he can imagine having a house and a family soon!\n\nHe says, 'I don't want to be an old dad.'\n\nShe thinks, he means over ten years from now.\n\nHe actually means when he's really, really old.\n\nHe says, 'No matter what happens I will be with you and support you.'\n\nShe thinks, how nice, he wants a baby with me.\n\nHe says, 'If we keep doing this, something will happen sooner or later.'\n\nShe thinks, he'll be more careful from now on. If not, that means he doesn't mind what happens next.\n\nThen he makes a big mistake and thinks she will fix everything.\n\nThey go to a show, then a place to eat, she feels happy and emotional, he takes her home.\n\nHe says, 'I want you to have what you want. I may not be the right boy for you. I am sorry if I made you believe something wrong, I don't want to keep you waiting. Maybe you should meet other boys. I can't promise to marry you soon.'\n\nShe understands what he's saying.\n\n_Two days later_\n\nWe were never really together, so we couldn't split up, at least that's what I think. We're still 'seeing each other'. This means we are going on a trip up north for the weekend to meet his family. So, I just came home from work and spent some time getting ready. Now I'm waiting for Kevin to come pick me up with his old car and take me away into the night.\n\nIs it a special weekend if we're staying in a house full of old things and meeting his family is the first thing we're doing? I used Kevin's razor to shave this morning since he left it in my bathroom. It worked well - I'm all smooth now. I hope I didn't make his razor dull. He will like it.\n\n_Early this week_\n\nKevin is sending me a message while I'm writing this. He's saying sorry and feeling bad. He says: 'I can't give you what you want and I don't want to keep making you hope.'\n\nOur relationship got worse over the weekend. It didn't start well.\n\nA few years ago, I had a scary car accident while my family was with me. It was slippery because of snow and we spun around at a very fast speed. Now, I'm a bit scared when someone else is driving. Driving in the rain and dark can be scary. As we were going up the big road, the car in front stopped fast and I yelled, scared we would hit it and roll off the road. But Adam, who was driving, said, 'I don't need help driving. That car wasn't even stopping.' How could I know that when the rain was making it hard to see through the windscreen, and his wipers weren't working well?\n\nWhen we got to the apartment, the first thing I saw was a picture of him and his old friend. So, she's been here too? Not fun. I went to the washroom and when I came back he'd turned the picture face down. We were both tired and decided to relax by drinking a lot of apple juice, and hugging. We went to bed, and soon we fell asleep.\n\nIn the early morning, we woke up and hugged again. He suggested we should go looking for good deals at the nearby shopping place. But when I was trying to buy a lot of things to make myself feel better, he became impatient. I found some simple tops for 2 each and left him with my bags while I went to try them on. He had told me he was 'fine', so I thought everything was okay. In the end, he wanted to buy things. When I came out, he looked upset and said he felt a cold coming and that 'we won't have much time in the city'.\n\nSo why didn't he just take me away? My joke didn't work and it was hard to stay happy so he wouldn't get mad at me with my new clothes. We left, but realized we had a lot of time before meeting his mom, so he took me to the top of a big shop where we could see a pretty church and I bought a drink for later.\n\nI wanted to look nice for meeting his family, and planned to change clothes in the car parked on a quiet road. But putting on my clothes in the small car started to get hard. Unable to help (I don't think boys learn how to do these things at school) while I got more and more confused, Adam just had to sit and wait, looking at his watch annoyed.\n\n'I find this hard, always being late and not planned,' he told me when I asked what was wrong. I said sorry and tried to joke about it, but when I put on the second piece of clothing, I damaged it with my watch. I started to laugh, which, thank God, he did too. I took the socks off and we weren't late at all, which made his words feel a bit unfair to say the least.\n\nDinner was nice. I was certainly overdressed for fish and fries, but got on well with his mom and stepdad, who didn't talk as fancy as he did.\n\nWhen we walked back to the house I suggested going to a place for a holiday, but he said no. 'People like me get hurt in places like that,' was his reason, implying that everyone was not very nice. I told him off for being mean. I'd been out in that town before, and everyone had been nice, even when I won the singing contest. So what was his problem? Maybe the place we went past doesn't usually have a crowd of big fancy people, but I could hardly see him getting hurt for wearing a warm sweater. We stayed in and drank all the fizzy drink, followed by some more drink. There was nothing on TV. He said no to more than cuddling. We cuddled and fell asleep without clothes.\n\nOn Sunday I woke up feeling bad and began gently touching his chest without much thought. After a little while he looked at me closely, rolling over to meet my look, then kissed me deeply. 'What's that?' I asked him, 'What are you planning to do?' 'I want to be closer to you,' he replied, and moved his hand down to my belly. He didn't want to play with me in a certain way, telling me he liked our current game, and his eyes showed a happy, fond look. He took a break from our play and drank some water. He seemed to enjoy when I pretended to keep him in place. 'This was part of our game,' he told me, 'it was fun.' I sat back and watched as he continued playing, sometimes I would join him. Then he pushed my head away and sighed deeply. I continued to join in the play after he was done, and he told me, 'This feels amazing.'\n\nHe never spoke about the evening before, when we were almost done with a bottle of juice, I'd told him I liked him very much. I hope he was so sleepy he forgot. I bet he hopes I was too sleepy to remember.\n\nI miss our happy moments, the easy way I used to feel about him, even if I was holding the secret thought of how nice he would be as a dad to my future children. Yes, he's trying to 'do the right thing' now by being cautious and not leading me on, but that makes me like him even more. Yes, I did say love.\n\nI felt like crying the whole time.\n\n_On a Monday_\n\nI went to Adam's home very late at night. I didn't like the sudden coldness between us and I was scared to lose him without a last chance to talk. Even though I woke him, he said it was sweet of me to come.\n\nWe talked for a long time in the hallway and he looked so sad. He thinks he isn't the right friend for me because his plans are so different from mine, and nothing I said would make him think differently. He was a little distant but then let me hug him and I felt a bit closer even though he seemed less happy.\n\nI could see that he has taken everything I said to him very seriously and it has made him sad. He feels bad for 'misleading' me - something I never said he did - and for not telling me we weren't thinking the same way. I wanted him to understand that I wasn't trying to have a baby with him, but I wouldn't mind it if it happened by accident. I agree we need to spend more time together and get to know each other better, but the baby subject came up so soon that now it's hard to ignore it and pretend like nothing's been said.\n\n'I wish I hadn't spoken,' I told him, thinking I would cry but I didn't. He didn't agree, he thought it was important to share and talk, but I felt like I was in trouble.\n\nHe let me stay and we cuddled and fell asleep, in a friendly way.\n\nIn the morning he walked me to the train and we hugged goodbye. My last words to him were that I'd give him time and wait for _him_ to make the next move.\n9\n\n**Work Friends**\n\n2000s\n\n_A day in late March_\n\nI don't know what to write because I don't know what to think.\n\nKevin called last night just when I was trying to forget about things with free drinks. I don't know what he wanted, really. We had a short talk, me on the steps of the club, him at PI square, about the same thing, again and again. I tried to sound happy. Well, I guess I was trying to be happy. No, I was just trying to be.\n\nReally I am just sad. And I feel left out. He kept saying, 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry.'\n\nHe thinks it's all just no good now. Whatever. I told him not to call me today as I had a playdate (I do, but it's not the best idea to rush out and do this when I'm so upset). But what can I do instead? Sitting on my small chair and crying? Replying to text messages from Rugby Boy? Talking to one of my friends who don't understand? When I rode my bike home yesterday, I was so dizzy that I don't know how I did it. I seem to have stopped wearing my head protection too. Not a good mix, but at least I should get rid of some of those tiny food and morning meals so nicely made by Kevin.\n\n_Early April_\n\nI think I've been too sad to write. I mean, what else can I say? Kevin came to visit on a weekend. We both felt low and wanted to meet, but I think for different reasons. He didn't bring flowers, sweets or a soft toy. He brought a test so we could be sure that the medicine had worked. Nice.\n\nI packed some cold drink and we went to the playground but it wasn't a fun time like before, just a sad talk with extra sorrow. As the drink began to work its magic, tears started to flow from my eyes as I realized that even though he hadn't said it directly, it was over.\n\nWhy would I want to keep seeing him 'as a buddy'? Maybe in a few months' time, but now, avoiding him is the only thing I can do. He thinks I am too upset. Then he said, 'These past days have been the saddest in my whole life,' which might be an overstatement because he followed it with, 'I just don't think we could live together because it would be too hard for me.'\n\nMy tummy felt funny. I'd tried to be happy, light and nice, I'd dressed up nicely, and he says this?\n\nI can't say how much that hurt my feelings. _He_ can't live with _me_?\n\nAt least I clean my room. I use the toilet properly and I don't have smelly feet, nor does it take me a long time to finish tasks or look chubby without clothes. My room isn't too cold. My fridge is clean.\n\nAs I sat there feeling upset he said, 'You get so mad sometimes and I don't like fights.' What if I had a good reason to be mad? Oh, it seems I have no good reasons to be mad. Okay. Maybe I'm not allowed to be mad or sad.\n\nI used to like his calmness, his gentle, nice way of comforting me. No more, I guess. No more. I mustn't forget that he _cares, oh so much_.\n\n_One sunny day_\n\nTo make things worse, my new friend has to move out because he doesn't earn enough from his job. I told him finding a new job would be simpler than finding a new cheap house. You live and learn. The next one should better give me a paper showing how much he earns... .\n\nAt work, Thomas walked in, fresh from his many vacations this year. I wanted to know how he liked the SA country, but he wanted to know about me: 'So, what have you been doing?' 'Oh, getting left.' I didn't want to share more with everyone else around, but he was kind right away. 'You said he was too young for you. I was surprised he was only twenty-seven. I thought he was much older.' 'Well, he dresses like an older person,' I agreed.\n\nRight away he asked if we could go out for drinks soon. I am thinking about arranging something for a special day, my lucky day.\n\n_A beautiful day in spring_\n\nToday, I was walking along a windy, sunny beach, pushing a stroller. Two boys with a ball walked by, having a hard time throwing it to each other because of the wind. One had cool sunglasses with a gold edge, the other a white pair, and they looked relaxed, handsome and very young. Not surprising in a place where students live.\n\n'It won't work,' I yelled over the loud wind, 'the wind is too strong - I tried earlier,' and my smile showed the little child's warm, sleeping form in the stroller and the bright green ball under it.\n\nIn the evening, I gave Adam back to his parents. They're not married, but they've been together for a long time and across two big places. I find it hard to keep someone with me for three months, even when I've lived in his city for a long time. I'm happy I left LO city for some quiet and some new air from the sea.\n\n_On a Monday_\n\nOne night me and two friends from home went to a big party in BR club, where girls dressed as bunnies were giving out chocolate drinks a lot. Somehow, six of those drinks ended up in me, and then I asked one of the girls walking around the place for what was the best massage I had all year.\n\nI kissed a boy I just met and the next morning he was on the phone, wanting to set up a time to meet, but I don't know if I want to. He likes sailing. We'll call him Sailing Boy.\n\nRugby Boy has been trying to see me for weeks, wanting to meet when he's back from a trip. Tall Boy might want to be with me when we have that drink he's now very excited about. The Sailor wants to have lunch. Someone from that note I put up last year (the one that got me Kevin) has been bothering me too.\n\nWhy do you only want what you can't have? There's sweets everywhere, like chocolate treats for boys, but I don't want any. I don't wish to start the 'first few times' with someone new. I don't want to talk to any of them or to wait for their calls.\n\nI miss the fun, I miss Kevin and our chats and he's not talking to me. I know he doesn't want to be with me, but I won't believe that I'm not important to him, that it meant nothing and that I could easily find someone who makes me happy like he did again.\n\nI know he's not my perfect friend, but if it hurts this much to be not liked by someone who's - I don't know - 70 per cent right, what would it feel like to lose someone who's 100 per cent right?\n\nI want to hide, under the blanket, under water in the tub and stop thinking for a while. Just stop thinking.\n\nMy friend Ethan called and I said that I'd been left because many boys don't understand that girls come with a 'best before' date. 'That's so sad,' he said, 'a best before date.'\n\nAnd he meant it as 'unfortunate', not 'silly'.\n\n_On a Saturday_\n\nI can't believe I played with Tall Boy last night.\n\nI mean, that was my dream come true. I've liked him since October and it was wonderful, better than I could have hoped. He hugged me the way I'd like to be hugged forever. Then he went away without even having breakfast with me this morning.\n\nI've been staying at home feeling unwell and confused all day, even though the weather is beautiful. I feel silly, upset, and angry at myself for drinking too much juice, inviting him over and then asking him to sleepover.\n\nUpset because I didn't make rules for this visit, it all just happened quickly. I didn't stop him. I'm happy, too, to have finally had a sleepover with him, happy about the memory of his rough face on my tummy, his mouth on my cheek, his hand holding mine, my tummy tingling with his hugs, tightening as he hugged me more. It was so powerful that when he hugged me tighter I started crying, although I think I hid it well.\n\nI have never felt anything like this before.\n\nI'd taken him out with a group of friends and we'd gone to the place with the secret room again, which I just had to show to Tall Boy. When we went back to our friends, things had changed between us. We suddenly felt this strong connection, and every time we could give a quick peck without everyone seeing, we couldn't keep our hands and lips to ourselves. One thing, as they say, led to another.\n\nHis hand was the softest I have ever felt; he was strong as a superhero, the perfect friend... . . Not too small, not big, the right size for me. His happiness was the most wonderful I've ever felt. I really felt my body change even more when his joy poured into his protection and we stayed together while he caught his breath and my shivers calmed down.\n\nI don't know if this will happen again and I feel ashamed that I didn't wait until things between us were clearer. He probably thinks this is a very casual thing. After all, he knows I just broke up with Kevin and he hasn't shown any sign about whether this meant anything to him or if we're going to see each other again in the future. I wish happiness wouldn't leave me feeling so unsure.\n\nI'm understanding again that each time my heart gets some joy my heart seems to want to join in too. I mean, if you spend time with someone you like but you're not sure they like you back, you are bound to feel a bit unsure. This seeing many friends seems to mean I'm forever at the 'does he like me?' stage, pretending that I don't care about the answer. After being so close to Kevin, I'm starting to long for something more, but how do I have a real friendship without going through this again? It's impossible.\n\nI am silly, silly, silly. Why not be hard to find for a change? Or stop after a second juice?\n\nThe floors are covered with small pieces of food and wrappers, the toilet does not work properly and does not smell good. To live here, you need a strong air freshener, patience, and a nose that does not mind bad smells.\n\nThe refrigerator is always too full and the freezer has not been cleaned in a long time, but there is a lot of room for food and drinks. The room is very cold in winter because of the wind coming in through the windows and you need to have a lot of money to keep it warm. The walls and curtains are old and falling apart. The view of the big, new apartments next door makes this room special.\n\nDo not want this room if you are allergic to dust, because there are many old books everywhere. Send your best offer to me, the writer of this story.\n\nMissing: glasses that make everything look better.\n\nIf found, please give them back to me. I can't see without them.\n\nReward: a warm hat and a fancy bag, not needed anymore because they remind me of the past.\n\n_Early this morning_\n\nI woke up very early today.\n\nI was reading a book, trying to fall back asleep, when I saw the word 'KE city' and started to cry. I called his number twice and let it ring, with no caller ID. There was no response. Then I used a pair of scissors to cut up the warm socks he left behind. I put the fluffy pieces in the trash, but I couldn't stop crying.\n\nI called my friend's number in a far away place, needing to talk to someone who wouldn't be upset because of the time. He answered and I could hear people in the background.\n\n'It's Sophia,' I cried and sniffed.\n\n'Sophia, what's wrong?'\n\nAnd I realised how much I missed him. Our simple, kind, fun, truthful and close friendship. Every time I saw him we just had so much fun.\n\n'I can't stop crying,' I told him. He knows all about Kevin, having chatted about him the other night, but he was confused.\n\n'Is this about a new friend?' he asked, and honestly, I can see why he's confused. After all, didn't I tell him we stopped being friends a while ago?\n\nHe was able to calm me down and, curled under the blanket, holding the phone, I blurted out that it had been so hard for me to be close to anyone for a long time because of Peter, and that's why I hadn't let him be close to me, and how the last time I tried to be friends with someone without immediately being best friends, they stopped being my friend after a few months. Remember the Nice Guy who I was friends with after the time with Pinocchio, before I talked about having many friends with CA city Boy? He was upset when I didn't want to go home with him after two months and stopped talking to me, so it's best not to do it. I can't win.\n\nI feel like I'm running out of ways to know a friend's real feelings. Boys from EN country never want to be 'just friends' before becoming closer.\n\nCA city Boy told me all the good things, that I was young, beautiful, talented, I'd meet the right friend, it was his loss, etc., etc., ..., etc., . . . I started to feel a bit better but felt sorry for keeping CA city Boy from his friends so we talked about shared friends and his plans to come to LO city soon, then said goodbye.\n\nI think if I became friends with someone I really liked, I wouldn't be able to handle the end of friendship. Actually I know I wouldn't handle it, because I was so upset when I found out Pinocchio's kept being friends with his ex.\n\nRight after we stopped being friends I had to go on a work trip that left me upset, unable to sleep in a hotel in a different city for five nights and just managing to get through my meetings during the days. By the day when I tried to go over to his house to get my things I wasn't really myself - let's put it that way.\n\nMaybe if he hadn't locked the door two times because he thought I'd hurt his kitty (never! I liked that kitty - still do), I wouldn't have been so upset that I couldn't get my things while he was away. Maybe if I'd rested a bit or he'd been there to chat with me I wouldn't have been so mad. Maybe if I hadn't tried another way in and found out there wasn't one, but found myself under his wooden floor with no way into his house, I wouldn't have felt so weak. Maybe if there hadn't been a store with fish and raw chicken on sale, just maybe, I wouldn't have found myself crawling under his room in my pink shoes, using the light on my phone to find a spot to mix up a funny treat of seafood, chicken, yeast and milk that was going to be a surprise for him. Maybe.\n\nBut I did want to tell him about it. I really did.\n\nAnd the thing is, even that didn't make me feel better. I think I normally keep that part of my brain locked up in a soft room, but that day it was out and running around and everything I did, I did on a whim. I can't say I had it planned. A few hours after I'd pulled myself out of the makeshift door, Sophia called to say that Peter had told her he'd unlocked the door and I could go and get my things as long as she was there to 'watch over'.\n\nSam didn't come.\n\nSo there I was in our cozy house, cooking him yummy dinners and giving him relaxing massages. I couldn't cry anymore. I wanted him to understand how sad his lies made me.\n\nI took:\n\n  * The shower head (I bought it, remember?).\n\n  * A lamp I got for him.\n\n  * The blanket I gave him for the cat.\n\n  * A book from my sister he was reading.\n\n  * A frame with our pictures - a gift from me for Valentine's.\n\nI left:\n\n  * Some boots that didn't fit well.\n\n  * A doll in his bed to surprise him.\n\n  * Pictures of us on the fridge.\n\n  * A nightdress.\n\nI broke:\n\n  * A mug of hers.\n\n  * Her pictures and some papers he was keeping for her.\n\n  * A card she gave him.\n\nThen I:\n\n  * Poured her smell-good liquid in the toilet.\n\n  * Put water in the bottle and closed it.\n\n  * Poured all the grape juice in the toilet and didn't flush it.\n\n  * Hid all her big books in the storage house.\n\n  * Packed up all her clothes and shoes for the people who needed them.\n\n  * Took time to pet the cat, who'd been watching everything, and say goodbye.\n\n  * Put the keys through the small door in the door.\n\nLike I said, I wasn't feeling like myself.\n\nBut at least I didn't:\n\n  * Put the smelly cat sand in his bed.\n\n  * Write a note to his mom telling her about his bad habits and his past mistakes.\n\n  * Do a bad thing in his fridge.\n\n  * Do a bad thing in his fancy drink.\n\n  * Give his number as a free ride service.\n\n  * Tell the people he owes to where he works.\n\n  * Be unkind to his best friend.\n\n  * Park his car where the bus stops.\n\nLooking back, it should have been a big hint to me that so many of her things were still in the home she'd supposedly left a year before, and it was only due to my being very understanding or not knowing that I didn't wonder why a man would keep taking care of his ex's stuff forever, and let her stay in his home every time she chose to visit the big city.\n\nAfter I'd dropped off the bag of clothes at the charity shop, I suddenly felt like all the anger went right out of me and there was nothing but sadness left in my tummy. What had happened to me? I sat down on the ground with my head in my hands and stared at my feet without seeing them, trying to breathe deeply and fight the fear that was growing.\n\nWhat had I done? And why did I do it when all I wanted was to talk to Patrick and get some answers? Why did he tell me he liked me if he still liked her? Did he mean it? What was I going to do now? Why did I miss him so much it hurt? Would he say sorry, give me the hug I needed? Comfort me?\n\nAfter some time, someone came out of a store to see if I was OK. I thanked them and stood up a little unsteadily. I went to the doctor where the doctor took one look at me and promised to put me first on the list for talking to someone about my feelings. I went home and got into bed with my clothes on, hoping to sleep.\n\nOh, and Patrick moved out of that home a few weeks later, surprisingly enough.\n\n_Early morning_\n\nTall Boy is coming to the office tomorrow, yay! New thing - he's coming for a first meeting with my boss and to do some drawings. I admit I'm a little scared and a little upset that he hasn't talked to me, so yeah, maybe I feel a little used. But also a little excited. Actually, more than a little excited, as he's been in my dreams for these past two weeks.\n\nI just can't stop thinking about his sweet smile, and I want to see him again.\n\n_Tuesday_\n\nWith a skip in my step, a swing in my hips, a sparkle in my eyes and a big smile on my face, I went to school yesterday, knowing he'd be there.\n\nEvery time the teacher was out of the room we shared silly jokes. When the teacher was fixing the printer, Adam sent me a note: 'I am trying to sort out these new drawings ... but I'd rather do it while we're playing a game.'\n\nHe invited me to lunch, holding my hand as soon as we were out of sight of the school. 'A friendly lunch,' I joked, when he shared his food. 'A lunchtime meet-up for busy kids,' he laughed, and we giggled a lot before walking back, and he nudged me into a corner and showed me his funny face, making me laugh.\n\n'Play with me, play with me!' my heart whispered, excited in anticipation.\n\n'Join me, join me!' shivered my body when his hands reached for mine.\n\n'Be my friend, be my friend!' pleaded my eyes, my face close to his, my fingers in his soft hair. So I closed them.\n\nAnd meanwhile, my brain was silently wondering, 'What the heck is going on? First, you couldn't even get him to have juice with you, then he was 'too nice' because of your friendship with KB, now he won't let go of your hand. What are you? A toy?'\n\nAt our tables, I sneaked over for a hug and he was still excited. 'Sad that the table doesn't have a big cover,' I joked. 'You could tell my boss: \"Oh, Alice's just gone to the store.\"' I got a funny smile back.\n\n'Do you still talk to KB?' he wanted to know later. This seemed like a kind thing to ask but because I didn't really want to talk about it we mentioned his old friend quickly before changing the topic.\n\nWas he trying to see if I was definitely free now? I took it as a good sign that he's interested in me.\n\nAt the end of the day he gave me a peck on the cheek and said, 'See you soon,' and that was it. My feelings are all mixed up and I'm feeling alone and confused.\n\nAt least I know he went home very frustrated.\n\n_Early May_\n\nTall Boy is starting to bother me. Who'd have thought it? His computer chat is too much - all about how he's planning a visit to the office, and 'maybe we'll get to use that empty room upstairs' and 'will your boss be in?'But when I try to playfully ask him what is happening, he just avoids the question. Or else he leads me to fun play. Let me show you:\n\n_Alice_ : 'You like things to go slowly, don't you? First, months of no interest, suddenly it's exciting games early in the morning!'\n\n_Thomas_ : 'Haha, yes indeed. Exciting games early in the morning.'\n\n_Alice_ : 'Seriously, I thought this was a one-time thing after you left so quickly .. . . '\n\n_Thomas_ : 'No chance.'\n\n_Alice_ : 'Chance? Would be a nice thing.'\n\n_Thomas_ : 'The thought of you playing with me has made me ridiculously happy.'\n\n_Alice_ : 'Listen buddy, you gotta make up your mind about me.'\n\n_Thomas_ : 'Huh?'\n\n_Alice_ : 'I don't know, usually it takes people a while to get to that full-on play talk. And they tend to speak about other things too!'\n\n_Thomas_ : 'Did I mention that I'd like to hug you while we are playing? Then after a nice long game, laugh a lot?'\n\n_Alice_ : 'Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!' Here I am, looking nice and there's no one here to see it. Not that I'd let him do more than look at me from far away - because all he wants is to have fun without any promises.\n\n_Early morning_\n\n'Let me show you some drawings,' he said, asking me to come over to the table.\n\nI came over and saw a picture of a lady without clothes, but with a red belt, standing with two men without heads. I didn't understand the picture and it made me laugh. So, I went back to my table.\n\n'Do you have a lot of pictures like this on your computer?' I asked him.\n\n'Oh, this is just something my friend sent me,' he said. I didn't believe him.\n\nMy bad mood from last week is gone. A few things happened:\n\n  * I had lunch with our picture maker again.\n\n  * His nice message last night.\n\n  * His lips, his hair, his kisses.\n\n  * I'm not going to have a baby (why does this scare me every month? Even after taking the medicine on time?)\n\n  * I know that I will see him again, at his place, on my terms.\n\n  * His giggles, his scent, his energy.\n  \n  * How quiet he seemed in person after all that brave computer chatting.\n\nWe were left by ourselves in the room, so we went to the kitchen for a 'cup of tea'. We found ourselves in one corner, acting silly. Hearing a sound from the next room, my tall friend hurried back to his desk. Later, when I was 'making tea' again, we continued our silly games.\n\n'I won't play that game,' I told him as he began fiddling with his clothes. He asked, 'Why not? It would be fun to say we've played it in the room.' Oh, how boys love their games!\n\nSo then I had to. I mean, I had to see if it was as fun as I remembered and because there was nobody else in the room to interrupt us.\n\nI lowered my body slowly and took a toy into my mouth.\n\nMy ears are still sharp when I'm playing, and the sound of my boss approaching - surprise! - alerted me. I stood up quickly, dropping the toy, and Tall Boy, looking surprised, quickly put away his toy. When my boss entered, he found me alone in the room, innocently mixing two cups of juice while Tall Boy was busy with his computer.\n\n'Do you want a cup of juice?' I asked him as I washed my hands and dried them on a towel for cleanliness. To my relief, he said no. That's good, I would have had a silly smile on my face when I served it.\n\nI still don't know what Tall Boy is doing over the weekend, let alone his plans for the future. And I don't know why he just wants to play casually if all his friends are playing together.\n\n_Early May Saturday_\n\nWhy am I still thinking about Kevin and even Charlotte and why they left me and didn't want to stay in touch?\n\nI was at a party, surrounded by happy people, drinking a nice juice after nearly beating a very nice guy at a game, when I realized: I am alone. Kevin doesn't want to be my friend and I still miss his green eyes, his chubby hands during our play, his funny jokes, his voice.... So I call Adam.\n\nI can't see the number and it's too noisy to hear anything, but Adam answers. I end the call and call again. People around me are dancing and happy, I should be talking to them or something.\n\nThis time, Adam talks but I can't hear what he's saying. I'm sure he knows it's me. I know he doesn't have a lot of friends, which makes his ignoring of me hurt more. If we still talked I'm sure I'd feel better. He just doesn't like me. He doesn't like me.\n\nAnd now fizzy drinks and second-hand stores and special clubs and soft clothes will always be spoiled. And to pretend a different reality I keep getting myself pretend promise rings and worrying about baby tests.\n\nI asked the boy I'd been playing a game with to explain something for me. Last week, Boy - he who I kissed during Easter at a fancy place - took me out for dinner then invited me to his parents' house without them there for boat playing. But then I didn't hear from him for a week. The cute boy didn't know: 'Girls think too much. I don't know, maybe he just doesn't like you that much? Or his parents came back home without warning?'\n\n'Was it because I asked him if I'd have my own room in their house?' I asked, but no good answer came. Or maybe Yacht Boy felt like he was just a bandage on a big ouchie, and that being close with someone who was very sad was not worth the trouble it might cause.\n\nIt started raining, so I waited a little before riding my bike home. I still got very wet. Tall Boy messaged and asked if I'd come to TE city. It was too late. But at least he was thinking of me, or maybe just not thinking straight.\n\n_Early week in May_\n\nMy friends tell me Tall Boy was seen laughing a lot with two girls in a place where people go to have drinks on Friday night. I feel a little sad - I thought after work he'd go home, clean up and call me, asking me to come over. Maybe he knew that I would have said no to keep a little bit of pride and self-worth, even though I would have really wanted to because of the fun we had that afternoon. He's been quiet and I've been quiet except for that message on Saturday, but according to my friend who saw him, I should just enjoy the playing around at the place where we work and the occasional free meal. No word from Yacht Boy either. Do I trust these men? No. Do I love any of them? No. Are they making me feel happy? No. It doesn't matter..._Early Weekday_\n\nPatrick and his new friend Penelope are planning to have a special party during this hot season. I think Samuel might be the helper at the party. Why does it matter to me? Good question. Maybe because in the past while, I've been left alone (although I've had a lot of playtime, I should add), while he's giving her a special circle thingy. I wish them well, I guess.\n\nIt seems like Tall Boy didn't mean to treat me as a simple friend the other night when he sent a message from \"CO place\", instead he was surprised by what I thought he had meant by 'coming to play today' without even bringing a pie. I've been his classmate and friend for more than half a year and I feel I deserve more than a simple play date, I mean, that's not nice! If he had a real plan like a movie or a dinner, or told me earlier I would have been happy and might have been ready for more fun. But his sudden, late-night ask for my company felt a lot like he didn't mind much either way and I think I'm worth more effort than that. He started to say sorry and 'I just don't understand girls'. I could tell from his look and his reaction that he didn't mean it like that at all, it was just his awkward way of saying he wanted to play with me, so everything was okay and we quickly moved on to more fun games. I quickly put my shirt back on, just in case, and Tall Boy sat down next to me. He was very close and held my hands tightly.\n\n'Oh my gosh,' he breathed, and I knew he was feeling a lot of feelings, but I wanted to stay with him for a long time too, but I knew we had to be quick.\n\nA few moments later, I could tell he was trying to control his feelings. Gosh, it had been over a month since the last time we met and this time I was clear-minded and it was daytime and I missed him so, so much. His smell, his presence next to me, his voice, his breath, the look in his eyes ... . . I tried to make myself feel calm while he sat next to me, then just told him to stay close, and he did, strongly, lovingly and without regret.\n\nWe sat together for a few more seconds and I held his hand while I comforted him. There was nothing else to do. I needed more time but this wasn't the right place for it. He kissed my cheek and got up, and then we both got dressed again. I was trying to put my belt back on my shirt, my pants still on the ground, when Tall Boy went to the bathroom to clean his hands and I heard his voice outside.\n\n'Sure,' I heard him say, 'I'll make copies of those drawings for you and give them to you shortly.'\n\nI was still. I didn't hear what my boss said but I didn't need to; my heart had stopped and I felt dizzy. Why was I in the extra room with the worst messy hair and no pants? What would my boss say and did he hear us? We thought the building was empty and had not been quiet. Oh no, what if the other worker was back too?\n\nI tried to be very, very quiet. Maybe I could sneak all the way downstairs and pretend I'd been gone the whole time. I looked around the door and Tall Boy tried to signal to me, pointing to my boss's room. 'I'll bring those papers in a bit,' he said again. 'Are you kidding?' I whispered, struggling with my belt, my eyes wide with fear and the sound of my own heartbeat in my ears like a waterfall.\n\nHe nodded quickly. I almost cried. How silly does one girl have to be? I _told_ him I didn't have my meetings in the office! He might just be helping for now, but this is my full job, I use this money for my house and other things. And yet we had too much fun.\n\nFinally, he began to laugh. 'Ah!' I shouted. 'You silly person! I can't believe it!' and I ran to him, pushing him into the door and trying to touch his face in anger and happiness.\n\nHe's an adult, not a child! Then he said that I'd hurt his arm so I stopped pushing him and we went to eat after having fun. While walking, we met my boss. 'Just getting some food,' Adam called and we sat on a chair with our meals and laughed and joked with each other. 'What did you do with the thing?' I asked him, and he took it out of his pocket, put it in his empty food box and threw them away.\n\n_Early in the morning_\n\nFor some time I've been hoping that a old friend who lives nearby would help me bring home the old TV that my boss wants to change, but she recently told me she's going to have a baby and feeling tired after work, so I didn't want to ask again. Of course, I didn't go out with Kevin just for his car, but he was always good when it came to things like this. I didn't think Adam would offer himself for the job.\n\n'Are we going to throw this thing away, or what?' my teacher asked while looking at the toy. 'I still really want to bring it home,' I replied nicely, wondering if it would fit in a car. 'I'll make sure I get it this week.'\n\n'I have a car,' Big Boy said after the teacher had gone to make tea.\n\n'Really? Will you help me move it?' I asked. I would never have guessed that he had something like a car. With all his trips to far places I thought that anything without wings would be really hard for him to use.\n\n'Would you really do that?' I asked him with a smile. 'Sure, I can come tomorrow after school.' 'Great, thanks. You could take some of the old books you wanted for your home too.' Done.\n\nYesterday I stayed after school - not knowing that my teacher would also still be there when Big Boy arrived in his old car after school and worked with me to get the big toy in the car. 'Oh, hello!' my teacher said, surprised to see Big Boy on a day when he wasn't in school with us. 'He's come to pick up some of the old books,' I said quickly before Big Boy could tell him that I was the main reason for his trip across town on a Thursday night.\n\nI almost hurt my finger as we pushed and pulled the car seats. It wasn't easy to make room for the TV, the stand, and the shelves. I held the car door as he tied everything with string, ready to go.\n\nCarrying the TV across town and putting it in my house was nice of him. But if he likes me, why can't we just go on a simple outing? At least he stayed for breakfast last time.\n\nI'm not sure what he feels; maybe his past friend hurt him and he needs time?\n\n_One sunny day_\n\nI had a late birthday party at my house this week. Adam came with two friends but brought no card or gift for me, just some sweets he got for free. Imagine going to a friend's birthday, and not bringing anything!\n\nI should say that he was a good friend in the morning. He drove me to the store and helped me shop for party stuff. We were stuck in traffic and we sang along to the songs while I touched his neck. Still, I think he could have taken time to write me a card before the party.\n\nAnyway, one of his friends made a new friend with one of my friends quite early, and Adam and his friend from US country went to another party. They came back early in the morning, and, sleepy from drinks and lack of rest, I opened the door to them and their two cans of juice. Then we all sat on the sofa with my new friend, who's only just moved here from a far away place and was working hard on her English (we get along so well, she already feels more like a friend than a guest).\n\nThe boys were supposed to be helping us relax, but Thomas was not good, making no effort at all. After a while my friend went to bed, tired by the effort of thinking in English and the early morning outside. Thomas's friend went after her. We heard her say, very clearly and simply, 'I don't know you and I am going to bed alone. Good night.' And back he came. Wish I could say things so simply sometimes.\n\nNot long after, with the birds starting to chirp, Thomas's friend picked up his phone and called his friend. I sat there with my mouth open at his boldness. I could hear her happy replies to his questions as he tried to get invited over. 'Well, you'd be sad if I didn't see you tonight,' he said. Yuck.\n\nI told him to leave. Thomas was sleeping on the sofa. I went to bed alone.\n\nIn the morning, Thomas joined me for breakfast. I was not feeling very happy.\n\nOn a sunny day,\n\nThomas had to go back to work in the afternoon. So, I sent him a note in the morning: 'It's warm and I want to swim - bring your swim clothes!' He arrived at lunch time with swim clothes but no towel, so we had to share mine.\n\nAfter swimming in the outdoor pool, I saw him in the water. We hugged and kissed every time we finished swimming. I got out of the pool and dried off. He was right behind me, playfully touching me. We put my beach mat on the warm ground and cuddled together. I took my swim top off to get a tan.\n\n'So, what are you going to do in the summer?' I asked him as we talked about some of the places we liked. 'I'd like to take you with me to the PT country sometime..' he said. I wasn't sure if he was being unclear on purpose, or just didn't want me to go to his friend's wedding with him.\n\nI could tell he was happy just sitting in the sun with me, touching my arm before we had to go back to school.\n\nAfter school, we went out with our friends and late in the evening, I planned to see him. His friend had to help me from a big building I'd wandered into in my confusion (his instructions weren't clear) and when I finally found him, Tall Boy was very cross. He hadn't come to help me himself because he was so cross, indeed.\n\nHe hugged me in front of his friends, bought me snacks and joked, and we chatted about drinking juice, related small troubles and odd places where we'd played. Then he got us a car back to my place ('although you're welcome at my place, any time, you know that') because I had to be in school early the next day. We played on the sofa for a bit, and he was eager to get me into bed proper, so we retired and played a bit more. And then he fell asleep and actually started snoring, still holding my hand.\n\nWhich is not very nice.\n\nI sat next to him, still holding his hand, and briefly, foolishly, considered playing with him anyway, being restless, tired and very upset, but then I realised that would be really strange.\n\nI rolled over and tried to get some sleep, but couldn't. He hugged me close, like a big teddy bear hugging a smaller one, but I did not feel like hugging. So I did what seemed right.\n\nI picked up his phone which was blinking on the table next to the bed, and went to the bathroom, like a cat with a toy.\n\nAnd sure enough, I found out things that made me surprised: there were messages that showed that:\n\n  * He was spending time with another girl at the end of the spring, long after we first met.\n\n  * It was her he visited when he left my birthday party for a while, taking a small gift as she was going to live in another place for the rest of the year.\n\n  * They had done some fun things in the park a couple of weeks ago.\n\n  * Some other girls seem to like him too.\n\n  * His phone only keeps five messages at a time so I found out most of the stuff from his messages received.\n\nYes, I felt sad. Maybe my stomach felt funny and my heart beat a bit faster, but it was not a big surprise, just what I thought was happening. Not like a fairy tale. There was no promise, no trust or love or silly things. My feelings were right, even though my stomach felt funny. Maybe I was a bit silly and of course I was not happy with the man sleeping in my bed, but what would he have found if he looked through _my_ messages?\n\nFun messages from new friends, lunch invites, and playful games. \n\nSure, he wasn't truthful, but I didn't ask him something that would make him lie. I found a picture of her on a website at work today. She looks very different from me - height, skin color, hair, shape, age. Her being so different from me makes it easier to understand. And a part of me is happy - Tall Boy and I are the same, we're both a bit naughty! The difference is, I now really want to be in a serious friendship with the right person, and he doesn't, as he told me in the morning when we woke up and I asked about the other girl. She's 'just a friend' he said, but I know it's more than that.\n\nEven though he had a lot of juice the night before, he smelled nice and was energetic. \n\n**Helpers and Healers**\n\nA time in the past\n\n_One sunny day_\n\nI had to have a little procedure yesterday because of some unusual test results. The doctor showed me a tiny sample they took from my body - it bled a bit, but I am glad someone is taking care of it, even if I'm scared of getting sicker and not being able to become a mom. Oh, how nice it is to help people as a medical helper. Maybe the kids of tomorrow will get shots to keep them healthy and not have to feel bad.\n\nBenjamin reached out to me again. He let me borrow his friend's tool when I moved into my house, and now he wants it back. No talk for a long time, then you want your things back? No, buddy. In other news, Peter is getting married next week. And guess what? I only feel happy that it's not me in the white dress.\n\nTall Boy called me at work to plan when to come to my office for something that 'does not involve my boss'. Sadly my boss was there and heard our talk, as did three other workers, so I think we'll be discovered soon.\n\nI need a break but I'm not sure if I should go alone or with friends, or to accept an invite from one of my friends. Should I go to PO country with Tall Boy? Fly to NE city to meet the Captain and hope to keep my secrets safe? I'd have to make him promise he wouldn't try anything like that again. (After all, I want to save _something_ for my wedding day .. . . )\n\nWho says girls with travel cards can't have fun?\n\n_A special day in summer_\n\nNow this is funny! It seems like Tall Boy changed his whole day so he could come to my place when there will be (a) no boss and (b) no friends around. But, what he doesn't know is, there will also be (c) no Sophia. Because I didn't see the note he sent last night, and because I have a play date with an IT country boy who's been messaging me.\n\nI'm not going to cancel this play date just because Tall Boy's suddenly around, so Tall will have to understand that I have other friends too. Maybe he'll get surprised?\n\n_On a Monday_\n\nLast Thursday, Tall Boy came to my place to hang out, and I just opened the door for him and hurried out to meet this IT country boy who's sent me a picture of himself. As I ran out I told him I didn't see the note until it was too late, and the look on his face was funny. Ha! But, the lunch play date didn't go well.\n\nI arrived five minutes late at the agreed spot, and Mr IT country was not there. I called his phone. No answer. I walked around some more, looking at the menus of various food places (they weren't exactly cheap - hoped he was paying) and then decided just to sit down and have a juice till he arrived.\n\nBeep-beep went my toy phone. It was a note from Henry: 'I can see you.' Strange, I thought. Why doesn't he come over and say hello? Maybe he'll be with me soon.\n\nBeep-beep: 'Are you wearing red?' Yes, I am. So he knows it's me. But where is he?\n\nBeep-beep: 'Are you enjoying your drink?' By now I was feeling a bit upset.\n\n'Coward,' I sent back, a bit restless because I was hungry and the hot cocoa was not good.\n\nBeep-beep: 'I don't think I am.' But still, no sign of Henry.\n\nI looked at my toy watch and it showed it was after lunchtime. I had spent a long time in a costly play caf, sending silly messages with a friend who was hiding. I called Henry again and this time he picked up. 'Listen,' I said, 'where are you? It's been a while and we planned to have lunch. I'd like to eat now. What's happening? Why the strange notes?'\n\n'Oh, ah, um,' he mumbled, 'I'll be there soon. Just a little longer. Can you wait?'\n\nI was surprised, 'What do you mean, just a little longer? 'You saw me here, so why did you go again?'\n\n'Wait for me,' he said, 'I'll be there.'\n\n'No,' I said, 'this is silly. I was here on time and you didn't come to meet me. I'm paying for my drink and leaving. I can't be bothered with this. Goodbye.'\n\nI left quickly - not even a free meal was worth staying with this strange man. I found a cheaper place to eat and wished I had brought a book. He called. I didn't answer.\n\nBeep-beep: 'Okay, you are not going to wait for me, so you don't need me, but you are very pretty, I'm sorry. Goodbye.'\n\nBeep-beep: 'OK, you have all reasons to think I'm bad. I'm really sorry. You are pretty and you'll find a nice man, sorry.'\n\nCan you believe that this strange man has a job in a big building? On second thoughts, actually, I can believe that.\n\nAt least I had my tall friend to go back to and make my day better. We had a fun day, in fact: after I'd told him about my 'date', things got very exciting. I just can't keep my hands off this nice man. This content is inappropriate and not suitable for children. Hence, it cannot be revised according to the guidelines provided.\n\nWe sat down on the floor and he hugged me as I touched my nose, feeling happy. After some time we put on our clothes, cleaned up (I made another drawing on paper) and opened the blinds. I had to go to a goodbye party and he had to see a friend, so we said goodbye till Friday. Once again he said I'd be welcome at his house any time, but I think I'd rather have a specific invite or reason. After all, I'm not a delivery service.\n\n_One Summer day_\n\nWhy do I feel the need to write in this diary? Am I sharing too much?\n\nI've always written. It makes my life less confusing. And when I was younger and learning about friendship for the first time, it was natural that I'd write about imagined adventures too, with my friend Jessica. We got into pretend adventures every weekend. How many teachers would suspect that a couple of twelve-year-old girls walking round the playground together eating their sandwiches would be talking about how their imaginary superhero friends had lost them to the rest of the team in a game of pretend again? Or being found in their sleep by a man who'd been secretly playing hide and seek with them for years?\n\nThis carried on till her mum found the letters, the books and the pictures of men in superhero costumes we used to cut out of magazines, and made Jessica tidy them away. It seemed like a whole world fell apart. She was crying; I was very embarrassed. My mom never knew about it though - I believe half of those stories are still hidden in her basement. I need to call Jessica next time I'm home, and we can find them and have a big laugh.\n\nI have another small book now, and also this diary. I'm close to having forty entries. I noted their names, how old they were, where they were from, and what we did, whether it was love, a special friendship, or just a fun night. I think everyone has a little book like that hidden away.\n\nTall Boy is at work today, doing his job quietly. There are too many people around. I'm chatting on my computer to a boy who likes playing pretend games where he is controlled. I have played the boss in the game before, but I don't really like it. Even so, he's nice.\n\n_Early on a summer day_\n\nTall Boy had some news for me last night.\n\nMy boss discovered about 'us'.\n\nI hope not because of some weird marks on his desk or messed up papers, but for other reasons. After all, you can only pretend so many times to go swimming with someone during lunch, get to work in their car because he was helping you 'move some stuff' or talk about the things you do together after school before it becomes obvious even to the most confused person. And my leader is not at all silly.\n\nSo the other day, when I was away with a bad tummy bug and Tall Boy asked my leader about me, he told Tall Boy:\n\n'Sophia's not well; why don't you call your friend and ask her how she is?'\n\n'Oh, ha ha,' said Tall, not knowing what to say.\n\nAnd then of course my leader saw me out having a drink with a friend that same evening, not being sick at all anymore. That's probably a worse thing than being friends with Tall, but we're not a pair after all and I don't want my leader to think I'm not doing my job well. At least we finish our work before anything happens.\n\nIf Tall Boy had told me about this little talk sooner I wouldn't have clearly reminded him about the show we were going to watch last night while my leader could hear. I bet he thought that was funny. Not that my evening with Tall Boy was anything special. I made him dinner, then we were hot in the warmest theater in LE city, joked a bit and then he gave me a small kiss on the cheek and went to meet a friend.\n\nNot really like in the stories.\n\nI think I need a change. Found a fast deal for a boat trip around the GR Islands, maybe with some swimming time. Hopefully the booking has been successful, then I'm going.\n\n_On a Monday_\n\nIn the two years of writing this story, I have learned that it's not _less_ sad to meet four friends who don't want to be close, but _more_ so. It's a game: four unreliable friends can make you sad four times as often as just one, even if you can always play with friends five and six. I don't want to 'just play' any more or 'play like a boy'. I want to play with the right friend. Even if we can have silly games, fun times, or silly jokes, secretly or not so secretly most girls my age want a boy who will play with us the next day. Maybe silly games are just something for girls to dream about, but it makes us sad when we try and it doesn't work. You wouldn't really play with someone more than twice if there wasn't something else that's more than just liking how they look.\n\nThe situation with my friend, Thomas, is making me feel bad. He'd learned that there wasn't going to be anyone but me at school on Friday, so he was all excited to come and 'do some homework' only I won't be there. Not another fun day with Thomas, but my holiday at last.\n\nI'm looking for a bit of space and blue sky to stop thinking about Thomas. I have to end it, it's not good. Pretend-like love feels odd now, with all these feelings hidden inside and nowhere to show them. I want to be loved and feel loved and have kids as a joyful part of that love.\n\n_Tom_ : Well, I thought we were enjoying but if you're not happy with that then okay.\n\n_Sophia_ : I try. I can't deny I'm enjoying but it's not enough for you and not enough for me.\n\n_Tom_ : Well, I had a friend for two years and now I want to be alone.\n\n_Sophia_ : Boy talk! But I get it. Boys want to have their sweet and eat it, and us girls are silly enough to give it to them. Mind you, I don't want to be a friend.\n\n_Tom_ : Just a wife, eh?\n\n_Sophia_ : Or pals. Friend is so confusing. Good that you're not possessive, otherwise that would really make things difficult! [I couldn't resist that small tease.]\n\n_Tom_ : Indeed. Did I mention that I like spending time with you?\n\nI can't win. He's good-looking, nice, energetic, not dependable and happily alone. And I want to know him better. Good thing I'm going to be out of the school, and the town.\n\n_On a midweek day in August_\n\nBack from my boat trip around GR country and feeling - how shall I put this? - better? By a pair of magical helpers and two weeks of sea salt in the air and sand under my feet. Maybe I can do things like a grown-up after all, or at least I can when I'm on holiday from my life, my flat, my office, my boss and my tall friend who draws. And they really were both helpers - surgeons, in fact, but I'm getting ahead of myself here.\n\nHelper number one was actually the friend of a guy I really liked, a handsome, tall man from NE country. That one had a girlfriend of four years, but he invited me along to spend the evening with his crew the night we reached another, even more beautiful island. I went alone, as the rest of my group wanted an early night.\n\nI joined his gang and we sat and had fruit drinks in an amazing cliff-top place. As we all chatted away, I found myself intrigued by two of his friends, one of them a guy who worked in music, the other a helper from NE city who used to want to be a fireman. After an hour or so, the boys wanted to move on to a fun place but I had other plans. I'm a fun place fan in LO city, and if I can go to the best fun places at home, why do I want to go somewhere not nice on a tiny island when I can sit out all night and watch shooting stars over a clear, peaceful sea?\n\nI told them I'd walk by the big rocks instead. They said goodnight and went away, but Mr. Xavier waited. 'Would you like a friend?' he asked. It was too dark to see if he was really my friend or not (I thought not) but I liked his kind offer and he followed me down the rocky path to the platform where I'd swum and splashed earlier with my boat buddies.\n\nI don't remember who thought of swimming - not me, I think, as I'd just carefully washed my hair in the small and hot boat bathroom - but, happy and silly on shooting stars and icy drinks, I took my dress off over my head and jumped into the dark water head first.\n\n'Is it safe?' Mr. Xavier asked from above. 'I have helped a lot of people who hurt their necks jumping into shallow water.'\n\n'Of course it is, silly,' I shouted up to him, 'I was here earlier and you can see the bottom when the sun is up. It's very deep.'\n\nAnd he jumped in after me feet first.\n\nWe swam around the bottom of the big rocks and into a cave where our movement through the water lit up millions of tiny glowing plants, making our arms and legs sparkle green underwater. It was magical. Out of the cave, I floated on my back and saw another five shooting stars, running out of wishes as I watched them race across the sky one after the other. We looked at the last bits of the sunset playing over the big building, and looked out all the way to the sea. I ordered a rice dish and a glass of fruit juice and we talked a lot, and by the time we were eating our cold dessert, we started to like each other more.\n\nAt first, I didn't like him much because he's not what I'd call my usual type - a bit short, somewhat thin, with less hair and dark eyes, he smokes - and yet he was also real, nice, normal and kind. If you could ignore the bad smell of his smoke, he smelt of nice soap and he said lots of nice things to me in a different accent with an honest, sweet smile. He was really fun to talk to as well and listened carefully before giving good advice.\n\nHe was a doctor who helped people. It was interesting to get his thought on sickness (my aunt was sick) and girls who care too much about how they look and people who change their body. Later he drove me back to my place to sleep, and I made him open the roof on his car. I arrived at the door with messy hair and a big smile, tired but a little sad at having to go to bed early. I said goodnight to him and decided to walk around the shops that were still open.\n\nMy phone made a sound and it was a message from the kind doctor: 'If you are not tired, would you like to join me at my place for a swim?' I had a little thought. I needed to wake up early for a trip and had to get back to work in LO city. But, I wasn't too tired, and even if it was getting late, it was very hot. I wanted one more swim. I was also curious to see inside his house.\n\nI sent a 'okay' and bought some cold drinks for us for the ride to the outer part of the city. Adam picked me up in his car and we left.\n\nThe car went into a street with many trees and stopped in front of some gates that opened by themselves. We parked inside and got out. We were welcomed by a bunch of cute kittens and a dog saying hello. Adam likes animals. We were home!\n\nIn the garden, Adam opened a bottle of a famous drink and gave us each a glass. Then he went to look for his swim shorts while I played with the dog near the pool. He couldn't find his swim shorts, so when I got into the pool in my shiny swimsuit, he just wore his underwear. And his underwear got see-through. I tried not to look, but he seemed to look better without clothes. He wasn't thin but really fit and strong.\n\nEnjoying the nice water with this kind, tan man while his cute dog ran around, I asked him about the strangest thing he had ever seen at work. 'Well,' he started, 'a man in a neat suit. A very proper, work type of man in his middle age. He told me he was not gay, but that two of his friends had visited him the other night with some candies, and left a big toy in his home!'\n\nI was so surprised and laughed a lot, I mean, I always thought these stories were just stories, but he told me they were all real. He spread his hands wide apart to show me how big the toy had been. 'The nurses were taking photos! We see this all the time. Fish toys, a shower toy, a veggie toy, all kinds!'\n\nAnd I thought women were creative! He moved closer and gave me one of the nicest kisses I'd ever had. Even the taste of candy didn't make me dislike it - for once it made me think of Pinocchio in a happy way, making me remember all the fun games we used to play. I felt happy. Bad idea, I thought, remember your early flight, think how you'll feel if he never comes again, and stick to your new rules: if you are starting to like someone, wait until you know he likes you a lot before you play more games with him. Take care of your feelings.\n\nWe had a fun evening with great chats, and I was hoping this could turn into more if we got to know each other better. The doctor from the country starting with D had been different, all I'd been interested in him for was his ability to make me happy, but with the doctor from FR country I saw the potential for more than just a fun time. I gently pushed him away with a smile and we both climbed out of the water, only when I saw him standing there like a tall statue wrapped in just his towel, and remembered his silly laugh in the water, I just had to be his friend. Why the heck not? Thoughts came into my head as I got excited by the possibilities in store: 'I'm in a warm country drinking yummy juice with a nice doctor, I'm free and single, this is so very romantic, it's the end of my holiday, I might feel sad if I walked away now when I'm old and wrinkly in a rocking chair.'\n\n'I can take you home any time,' he told me. 'Just say the word.'\n\n'I will, but not quite yet.' I'd only meant to stay till bedtime and now it was past that. Once again, my excitement overruled my reason. Will I ever be able to follow my own rules?\n\nWe talked about friendships, the difference between boys and girls attitudes and about love. 'If you are older than sixteen you can't fall in love properly,' I told him. 'You need a certain degree of innocence for that, and you're too sensible once you're past that age.'\n\nTalk about feeling nervous - I was waiting till I was older for certain body changes, but they didn't happen. Some parts of my body are just different than other parts and that's okay. And now, I was going to see a doctor who specializes in these things.\n\nHe was kind and gentle as I was feeling nervous about what was going to happen. When he asked me to relax, I felt my body respond with trust. He showed me a small room and asked me to take off my beach shirt - he was good at helping me feel comfortable. His own beach shirt was left on a chair and I could feel his friendly presence.\n\nHe then had to do a check-up on me, which felt a bit strange. He quickly went to get some medical equipment, then asked me to lower my beach shorts, and asked me to sit in a certain position. As he was doing the check-up, he turned so he could better see what he was doing. I hadn't been to a doctor for a long time - there are few things less fun than a doctor's appointment - but his professional manner made me feel at ease. He asked me to relax as he continued with the check-up, and all I had to do was trust him. Funny, he was thin enough to sit on my lap, but he had a surprise. \n\nHe moved again on the bed and slowly came closer to me. This made me gasp as I was still a little hurt from Doctor David at the cliffs. However, I was so excited that after a while, I welcomed him fully, holding his back and gently touching his neck as he hugged me. 'Touch yourself,' he urged, although I didn't need any urging. I felt happy quickly and then he felt the same, then I felt happy again, holding him tightly as he filled the balloon with warmth.\n\nHe moved away and reached for me, placing my head on his chest and lazily touching my back. My hand rested on his flat, sun-kissed stomach and we caught our breath. 'I could hug you all night,' I told him. 'Why don't you then?' he asked me. \n\nSuddenly we heard the noise of talking and laughing outside. It was his neighbors, who must have heard everything through the open FR windows.\n\n'That's embarrassing,' I said. \n\n'I don't mind,' he laughed and I looked up to see him smiling. He stood up to remove the balloon and fetch his apple, then ate two, leisurely, his legs resting on mine. If someone sits next to me on a park bench I usually move away, but for some reason this was OK.\n\nWe started playing again, and this time I moved around like a puppy, excited for him. I felt a little hurt but I wanted to play hard. 'Sweetie' he called me as he tugged my hair and played energetically, while I was touching my belly and his legs. He playfully poked my backside, almost making me lose balance, but I steadied myself to enjoy the feeling of his energetic playing, and then he was tired. I was so close to winning the game that I cheered loud enough to stop the next door's talk. We fell back onto the covers, breathless and joking about the people next door, and his pet dog making noise outside the door. Then the talk changed from jokes to a famous drama and simple thoughts as we rested, his smoke from a candy stick curling up and out of the FR doors, our bodies covered under the sheets. I spoiled the fun by looking at my watch: 'It's late! Oops!'\n\nHe took me back to my house with a long goodnight and an invitation to SA, and I went to bed for a short sleep and some quick clean-up.\n\nLet's hope fall brings some low-cost toys!\n11\n\n**New Friends, Old Thoughts**\n\nFALL 2007\n\n_One late summer day_\n\nThe night before we returned to AT, I received a message from Sophia, my old best friend. It said: 'I heard you got a beautiful new house, I also have big news. I moved to a new home and had a baby!\n\nAt that time, it felt like a surprise. The vacation was almost over, I had only gone for one swim, and I was with people who were pals but not close friends. I don't know why it made me so uneasy - I don't want her to be unhappy but I was really surprised, amazed and also, I realized, happy for her. I went to the beach alone then cried, feeling like I was all mixed up with different feelings. Then I replied: 'Congratulations. I can't believe it! Who's the dad?'\n\nIt turned out that he was a man she met through a website for meeting people and she had only known him for three weeks when she found out she was going to have a baby. They weren't together any more. She sent a picture, but I couldn't see it while I was away so we didn't talk for a week or so.\n\nI wanted to go and see the new one - I like babies and they seem to really like me - but I was a bit unsure. She used to ask me to take care of her cat for free when she was on vacation then complain that I hadn't cleaned up all the cat hair, as if I was supposed to be her helper. Does she just want someone to watch her baby for free? Or is she tired of her new life? Have her friends who like to have fun left her now that she's a mom by herself?\n\nI went to see them on a play-day, ready to feel happy. I brought flowers and a big teddy that my good friend got me, which I didn't need much.\n\nIt was odd when she opened the door to her new home with the little one in her arm. It was odd that she didn't know how to hold his head. It was quick for her and the father, a tall man who lives in a shared home in CA city. It was sad she didn't like him much after she knew she was going to have a baby and told him to leave just after he gave her a simple ring. Odd how she planned to live with the small money he could give them.\n\nShe had moved in two weeks before, and the home was still a mess with the baby bed in pieces and the baby room unpainted. I sat down and held him while she made us hot milk. Two years' worth of the biggest changes in our lives were told in under thirty minutes: my home, my cat, my new work, her ex, her new home, her feeling unwell and quick baby arrival, all talked about quickly.\n\nThe baby smiled up at me and I touched his soft skin and hair. He was quite happy, even though he'd just met me and I'd interrupted his meal. She took him back and continued feeding, telling me she'd only realised the living room had no direct sunlight after she moved in .I suggested a walk to the park as it was sunny for the first time since baby Adam was born, and Alice was happy to leave the house. I pushed the pram on the way to the park, feeling like a proud new mum. On our way back Alice pushed it and I got teased by a group of builders in a van. Funny how getting messy with your friend's milk can begin to help old problems.\n\n_One sunny day_\n\nSeeing lots of friends at the same time never works how you'd like it to. Either the boys surround you all at once or they just disappear.\n\nDoctor Frank has been very quiet. No more talk of FR country but he said there were bad fires in AT city; it seemed to worry him. According to his online profile, Boy Patrick is 'friends' with a pretty girl born in - wait for it - a long time ago. He is so funny! Boy Cameron found some pictures of us in NE city and posted them on his site - how nice, and what fun memories. I felt very happy. I miss that boy. We still have long chats online.\n\nBoy Yosef appeared again and invited me for a weekend's boat ride as he's 'less busy at work' - he has turned a big age and bought a new boat. I wondered where he'd been. I may go, but I'm a bit worried because I've met this boy only two times. What is he thinking? It seems his brother and his brother's girlfriend are also coming, but they will be in their own boat. I'm not scared of staying the night with him, I'm just a bit unsure because I don't know him well.\n\n_One day in September_\n\nThe weekend began a little earlier than I thought. I wanted to go to bed early on Friday because I was getting ready for an early trip with Boat Boy. So, instead of playing in the West End, I invited some friends over to my house for a quick barbecue to enjoy one of the last nice nights of the year.\n\nOne of the friends I invited was my roommate's friend, Sport Boy. He had been trying to be her boyfriend for a while, but she always said no in a nice way. She just doesn't like him that much, or something like that.\n\nThe first time I met him, I tried to change her mind. He is very nice, good-looking, smart and a bit proud. He looks good in a suit and he talked a lot about his love for travelling and the business he's starting. He told me he thought I'd been to a special school, which I let him believe for a little while, telling him it was in a faraway place, that's why I have a bit of an accent. Then I honestly told him I didn't know what they taught in special schools. 'How to walk straight and get out of a car without showing your underpants,' he told me confidently. 'You don't need a teacher for that,' I said, 'you just keep your legs together.'\n\nI thought he was nice, and asked my friend why she didn't like him, but she wasn't changing her mind. 'If you like him so much, _you_ be his friend,' she said, and I said that was silly and that those sort of things - sharing friends - never worked. 'No, be his friend,' she encouraged me, and gave me his number.\n\nSo that's why he was at the cookout and our pleasant talk over a good juice. When my friends started to feel cold I led them all to the couch and the TV, and we talked and drank happily and it stopped being bedtime and turned into a nice kind of party. Eventually everyone had left and my friend went to sleep, leaving only Fun Boy trying to fix a broken DVD on the couch.\n\nThen he jumped. It was a big, excited hug, surprising me, but very, very nice. I was worried about the open living room door, but no one came in and his hugs became more excited. I loved every second of it and didn't stop his hands as they touched my face and then moved up my dress.\n\nWe laughed together as we looked at the mess made by the spilled juice glass during our playtime, and he allowed me to hug him as he wrapped up the candy wrapper. He had tiny white spots on his back that looked like water drops and I gave them a peck and told him I thought they were pretty.\n\n'Not when you're a kid,' he said.\n\n'No kid ever feels pretty,' I replied.\n\n_One Wednesday_\n\nJust so you know, riding on a boat is very fun. The movement of the boat is almost like a living thing, a large fish, a strong friend, a big wave. This is why I was a little bit antsy after my weekend with Boat Boy.\n\nI woke up on a Saturday morning a little surprised to be so happy and excited about meeting Boat Boy after my fun night with Play Boy. I had to wear a cloth around my neck to hide the big mark he had left behind. When I got off my bus and met Boat Boy at the stop he was bright-eyed and happy too, and I sat in the car while he got us some drinks. We had a lot to talk about and I tried not to let my annoyance at having heard nothing from him for so long creep into the conversation. Everything was good, soft and fun. It set the tone for the weekend.\n\nWe went to the boat and found his brother and girlfriend. Then, we carried the food onto the boat and started our trip down the river. Within a short time of lifting the anchor, I was steering. He trusted me with his precious boat.\n\nWe spent two nice days. On Saturday, we went to a concert on the island, then cuddled up in the 'big cabin'. He put my head onto his chest. But even though we'd been a little touchy and flirty during the day and evening, nothing more happened except a few kisses. He was tired and I didn't want him to think that I was easy.\n\nThe swaying of the boat and the wine made me feel funny, and I lay there listening to his soft breathing and feeling impatient. I thought about the chance of a relaxed morning kiss. It was so special to be lying there together in the small bed but there was a big gap between us. I couldn't forget the long silence between springtime and now. When the sun and the birds woke us up early in the morning, I tried to wake him by stroking his hand gently, but he just went back to sleep. His brother woke us at late morning and we had to go on deck so that was that.\n\nGoing back to the main land was an adventure: the ocean and wind became strong and I found myself steering the boat fast, fighting strong winds and a rough ocean. Still, I managed to make us a late morning meal when Boat Boy took over, making scrambled eggs, bacon and bread. Luckily I'd learned to balance on a boat in GR country. We arrived at the harbor under a dark late-afternoon sky and I changed into my swimsuit and jumped into the cold water for a fun swim. 'I can't believe you actually went in,' said Boat Boy, rushing to the side as he heard the splash, and as I climbed back up the ladder, 'Wow, you look just like that famous movie girl.'\n\nBack at his parents' house I took a shower but he didn't understand my hints to join me, then we had a big dinner. On our way back to LO city we laughed and joked, keeping him awake when he was tired from the fresh ocean air. He took me to the train station with a smile and a kiss. And an invite for another trip this month.\n\nI must remember that I am trying to find a boy I actually want to be with, and not waste time making it too easy for boys who just want a short romance, so although I was happy on the boat I don't regret not sleeping with him yet. I'll wait and see if he actually calls me about that next trip. I don't know why I liked the boy who likes to fence, but I did, and it was fun.\n\nThis weekend, I met two different boys. One of them, the fencing boy, was a surprise. I didn't plan to meet him, it just happened. Now, I'm wondering what will happen with him. Will we become good friends? I'm not sure yet. All I know is that I had a good time with him. And if nothing more happens, that's okay. It was just a fun time with a friend.\n\nThe other boy, who likes boats, was different. When we first met, he seemed interested in being more than friends. But then he stopped calling. I think to have a real friendship, you need to keep showing care and effort. So, I'm a little unsure. I didn't want to get too close too soon, to keep my feelings safe. I was hoping for something more because of how he acted when we first met. But now, I'm not sure if he really likes me. There's a difference between saying \"slow down\" to someone who's rushing things (because there's always a chance to change your mind later) and not knowing if someone likes you because they don't show it at all. Maybe he was just being nice?\n\nI only know that I need to try and make choices that make me happy, but also don't hurt my feelings. I want to enjoy being by myself, and do fun things like sailing on the weekends.\n\nAre you finding this hard to understand? Me too!\n\n_Early September_\n\nMaybe it wasn't a good idea to go to the movies with Tall Boy last night. Or to the park at lunch time. Maybe I need to wear something that will stop him from touching me. Maybe I need to be careful about what I do. Maybe I should never touch his hair again, or move away from his kisses.\n\nMaybe I should tell him I like him a lot.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nTo other people, we might look like the perfect pair. Tall, good-looking, happy, touchy. I buy the movie tickets, he gets the popcorn and drinks, we share the bag, the straw, we laugh.\n\nMaybe he likes this fun we have, with no pressure. I try not to ask him too many things, keep it light, be his friend, his girlfriend; the girl whose hand he holds in the dark. Those lips, so firm and nice, the soft, exploring tongue, perfect. I never had any trouble kissing him, not like with some boys who don't know how to kiss - not messy, moving your tongue too much or trying to do too much, just kiss; give, take, smile, stop, kiss again softer, feeling more passionate, gently biting lips, not doing the same thing you learned from your old boyfriend.\n\nWe sit and he touches my hair. This special time is nice even though the movie is not good. It's a movie for boys and I laugh a lot, but I am mostly smiling because I am happy he is with me.\n\nHe likes surprises, and I enjoy these times when they happen, and it doesn't feel forced. I wish I was better at waiting, let him look for me for once. We naturally find ourselves in these close moments - like sitting in the park with our sandwiches, my legs crossed under my dress, him lying on the grass. We are more than 'just friends'. I can smell him, and he is wearing a nice shirt with those old jeans I remember opening. He smells my neck and tells me he likes my smell. I touch his soft hair and he sighs happily.\n\nWe don't talk about big things. Friends, shopping, trips, talking in different ways, that sort of thing. His home, my home. Work. My silly boss and his quiet friend, who gets so upset with him he doesn't stay quiet when he calls me on the phone to complain.\n\nTall Boy works at different places and tells me about the wild creative people he meets, or the plain and boring ones who need his help but wouldn't recognize creativity if it was right in front of them.\n\nI've eaten my food and I sit next to him, both of us looking at the sky while I rest my head on his arm.\n\nI try to remember these moments, because I cannot keep these moments forever.\n\n_Early Tuesday morning_\n\nUnder bright city skies, I go into my blue pool, with strong men in swimsuits around and a little bit of sunshine. The water makes me happy and seeing strangers' bodies makes me feel better in a strange way.\n\nI sit on the steps, watching the men, wishing I had a strong boy's body, tanned, around nineteen I'd guess, so I could look at them properly. Or a tall body with wide shoulders and chest hair, like my friend Tom's.\n\nTom has told me about the changing rooms, telling me what the men are doing there. I'm interested to know if the same thing happens in a city place between boys and girls too. He's said that he's interested in a famous club which is a place for adults. Will I go with him? I think I would be too upset. Who wants to see their best friend (well, he would be if it wasn't for that thing between his ears) getting close to a pretty girl? Or older women liking him? Who wants to watch him looking at me while someone I don't want to see again is mean to me?\n\nAs I was enjoying the sunshine after school in my swimsuit yesterday, something strange happened: I saw a man doing something odd near me. He was touching his belly. At first, it seemed like he was just resting his hand on his tummy. I thought: 'What a silly, strange pose, does he think he's alone in his room?' and tried to focus on my book.\n\nThen it was more clear what he was doing, or maybe trying not to do.\n\nThere were two girls next to me, and this man with the strange habit kept looking at them, then looking down at his belly, before 'carefully' moving his hand. It was harder to ignore it, as he became more obvious (or was it just my imagination?) He moved his hand one more time, then stood up and stared at the pool, then sat back down again and checked his tummy.\n\nHe even lifted his shirt a little, and looked at his tummy. I didn't like it, and thought about telling someone. 'There is a man doing something strange over there,' I would say to the pool guard, and watch as he was asked to leave.\n\nInstead, I kept watching him. Was what he was doing truly strange? Was he showing off on purpose, or just not paying attention? And - I felt a strange feeling. I saw his hand moving in the sun, and his body which was warm from the sun, began to make me feel odd.\n\nI could see what he was doing quite clearly, and it seemed to be continuing.\n\nI don't know why I felt this way. In my mind, I was bothered and should have been upset, but instead, I found myself wishing for a different world where I could invite him over with a wave and a smile, and have him come over to me, warm from the sun, making me sit down quickly, and start a game of tag, with fast, relentless chasing as people around us watched him tagging me.\n\nHe'd run off with a shout (I'd be glad I wouldn't be able to see his face), stop for a moment to catch his breath, then go back to his sunny corner, while I'd sit back and then go for a cool swim. Like monkeys in the zoo.\n\nIs this ever going to happen? Did people do this a long time ago? Why did seeing a part of a boy's body make me feel funny, without any reason?\n\nIf I had said even one thing to him, my funny feeling would have gone away quickly. He was not my type. It was just his bold, silly part that did it. I feel funny now even when I am writing this.\n\nI am feeling very funny at the moment, so much that I meet new friends in my dreams: things are very detailed, hot and random, and I wake up wanting a friend in bed next to me. No luck. If I can have fun in my dreams, why can't I do it in real life?\n\nI'm back to what I had before: a group of boys, each nice and not so nice in their own way and none of them wanting to stay. When I started meeting more than one boy, having all this attention and fun made me feel good, but when I look back at my old stories all that talk about 'having fun like a boy' seems strange. Did I really think that? Instead, I'm finding out that with each new friend at least one part of my heart stays with the boy: Adam, Patrick, Cameron, Kevin.... . . Being sad doesn't stop just because of good feelings. I wish I could find someone who is nice to both me and my heart. \n\nThings at my job are changing again. My boss wants to move our work to a place far away in the city and I don't want to travel that long, so I need to find a new job.\n\n_Early in the week_\n\nI don't know why some people who give jobs don't want someone smart and interesting to work in their offices. They would rather have someone quiet and not very smart. I don't get jobs because they think I might get bored. My job right now is boring most of the time (unless my friend is in the office!)\n\nWhy do job people call and ask what you want, but then they offer you something different? And how can anyone be serious when talking to a young boss who uses big words but can't explain them?\n\nWhat's new with friends? Well, there's not much. Frank and I had a fun night together after a show in SE city and I playfully invited him into the shower before bedtime. After a little misunderstanding when I asked him what his small finger was doing, he misunderstood and thought I wanted him to put it somewhere else. I found myself experiencing different kinds of fun. I wonder why he likes doing that. I wonder if he expects me to do the same. In any case, it was nice and as we played, I felt like we were two friendly, giving people who moved together, sharing laughter and joy. Oh, and we broke the bed. The new bed.\n\nI enjoy talking to him as much as I enjoy playing with him and we chatted as we waited for his car. He asked me if I used to like horse riding. 'Um, no,' I said. 'Only recently, and the horse can usually tell I have no experience and runs away with me.' My parents had never been able to pay for me to have riding lessons, so the only horses I got to sit on were toy horses and horses at the funfair.\n\n'So you didn't win that,' he pointed at a pink badge pinned by the bed.\n\n'Not really,' I took it off the curtain for a closer look. It read: BIRTHDAY GIRL.\n\nThat's all for now. He might have thought I was fancy too, with my pretend school and pretend horse.\n\n_Early morning_\n\nTonight I'm meeting Yacht Boy for dinner and music. I'm excited because I haven't seen him for a bit. Work made us miss a second weekend of sailing and I'll be gone again this weekend for a job interview far away.\n\nEven though I like both Fencing Boy and Yacht Boy, they don't quite catch all my attention. They're both nice to look at and fun to be with. I like them a lot and Fencing Boy is really good at love, he's passionate and gets jealous too. But there's still no strong feeling for me to be with only one of them. After all, Fencing Boy will always text instead of calling, or will just not call for a bit. And Yacht Boy wasn't honest about where he lived, didn't talk from May till August and doesn't always answer when texted.\n\nCompare them to the Colonel who was heavy, not nice, cheated but knew just how to give me the attention I wanted, or KB who'd give me a lot of nice love, and drive me to the airport early in the morning two days before Christmas even though I hadn't yet been with him.\n\n_Early in the week_\n\nWent to a show with Tall Boy tonight.\n\nMy friend Penelope was in a new version of a famous drama and my friend and another boy friend came too. Tall Boy knows them from my birthday party and was his usual, friendly self.\n\nComfort, warmth, familiarity. His finger touching mine, my arm behind him, my hand in his. What _is_ this?\n\nI need to talk to him and figure it out. We won't be together much longer so who cares, really. I should let him know I like him a lot and see what he plans to do about it. Probably nothing but he just feels so right to me that I can't help it. And I think I won't forget him unless I confront it.\n\n'Sad I couldn't walk you home tonight,' he told me afterwards. He knows I really like him and I'm not happy with myself for it. I can't stand the thought of lying next to him and feeling the distance between us.\n\n_Later in the week_\n\nFencing Boy stopped being my friend on Social Site. Now that _is_ interesting. After not talking to me all week, he messaged, 'I would like the friendship you are offering, but without the hugs and kisses. Hope that's OK with you.' No, that's not OK with me. We had played while in a fancy hotel with friends. He gently nudged me against a door in the hallway. I was happy but he wasn't. Luckily, the friend whose room it was didn't come out then. After that, there was another night when he stayed but was too tired and grumpy to even join me for a bath.\n\nI wished I knew what went wrong. I think I made a mistake by playing with him without thinking about the feelings. He sent a few more messages to say that he wants me to be his friend but he 'doesn't play that way'. My happy looks at new babies during a park walk might have also played a part in this friendship ending early. Or maybe I shouldn't have invited him when I went to see a friend's new baby girl... He didn't even want to hold her. I guess he's not okay with seeing many friends at once, or being friends with women who want babies, which is his choice, but he could have at least found time for a friendly chat to let his 'good friend' know in person, right?\n\nAt least Yacht Boy was able to tell me why he hasn't been in touch. 'I should be worried.' I should be worried because I do not have a new job yet. \n\nOne day\n\nWhy do friends always say, 'Make sure you're happy alone before you find new love.' if you're not with someone anymore? Let's think about this in another way. Would you tell someone who doesn't have a job to make sure they're happy without a job before they get a new one? Or if someone loses a leg in an accident, should they be happy with one leg before they get a new one? Or if you don't have any friends, should you try being alone before you find new friends? Or should you stay on the ground when you fall off a horse?\n\nIf we know that people aren't very happy without a job or with one leg, or without friends and lying in the mud while their horse runs away, why do we think that someone who's alone should be 'happy being alone'?\n\nPeople have jobs, legs, friends, blocks to climb on and someone special for a reason! I mean, sure, you can get by without them, but isn't life more fun and much easier if you have them?\n\nI don't want to be 'happy being alone' when I'd like to share both the good and the bad of life with another person who I really love and who loves and likes me.\n\n_On a sunny day_\n\nI was talking about two different job offers - it's nice to be wanted, but it's also a bit strange because one job wants me to move to another place, and the money they promised me at first is now in euros. I'd have to let someone else live in my home and put a lot of my stuff away, which seems strange after just moving in a year ago. But, it helps me not to think too much about the boys.\n\n_On the next day_\n\nFeeling tired of not knowing what's going on, I sent a message to my friend Jack to ask why he's been so quiet this month. He called me right away and said sorry. He's been very busy with work. I've been busy too, with work and life and friends, but I still have time to send a message or two. How can we be friends if he doesn't talk to me for a month? If I decided to be his best friend, would I be happy waiting a month for him to call me back? Would he be better at calling me if I decided he could be my best friend? I'm glad I didn't go on his boat with him.\n\n_On a later day_\n\n'Waking up next to you only reminds me of what I don't have,' I told my friend Thomas one summer morning. And he just touched my hair and told me not to think silly thoughts. After that, I didn't let him sleep in my bed anymore.\n\n_One day in November_\n\nA few weeks ago, I saw a picture of a cute baby at my gym. There was a phone number for more information about adopting a child. I wrote down the number and thought about calling for a few days. Then I finally called and learned about an information day.\n\nI took my friend along with me because he was staying at my house and didn't have a key. Also, I needed his support. I'd cried to him many times about wanting a baby and not finding the right person. The other thing was, the day was specifically for couples of different races wanting to adopt children of different races. With him, I felt less nervous and could focus on what was being said.\n\nI didn't know what to expect. I just wanted to know what I could do if I hadn't met the right man by the time I am 35. I learned a lot, but it also gave me a lot to think about. For example, it's rare to find babies who need homes. Usually, it's slightly older kids who've had hard lives or who have lost a parent. It's not like you get a tiny baby who is a blank slate.\n\nWhat if the child I liked had a naughty older brother or sister who came with them? Was I big enough to handle that? Did it matter if the kid was not well in some way? Would I need to think about which school they went to and where I stayed if they didn't want to leave their buddies? What type of meetings, if any, would I want with the kid's real mom and dad? And what if I only wanted to hug the 'perfect' kid when I should be choosing a less lucky one?\n\nAnd then, of course, there's the question of how fit the adoption people think I am. You can adopt if you're alone, but if you're with someone, you need to have been with them for at least two to three years to give a steady home for the kid. As a single, fair-haired and blue-eyed white lady I was not likely to be allowed to bring home a dark-skinned baby. It seemed funny, since there are lots of white single moms with brown babies who are just as white as they are black.\n\nTo highlight that funniness, one of the talkers was a lady of AF country heritage who had a daughter from a CR country background. The mom hadn't even been to the CR country, let alone to the specific island (I have, but there you go).\n\nThere are also all the hard parts of trying to adopt, getting money help and setting up adoption time off. I was thinking a lot about how to deal with all the papers and rules, but you have to remember it's all for the kids. My heart felt soft and my eyes got wet when I saw a book called 'Kids who wait'. It's a pretty book of kids who want a 'forever home' and a new family. I looked through it, hoping to feel that 'instant connection' people often talk about when they see their future child for the first time.\n\nIt didn't happen - this time - but I left happy that my friend had been there with me, and wondering when was the right time to put my name with the agency. It might take a year and a half or more, so do I wait until I really want a child or my money is better? More questions I can't answer - but the experience made me hopeful that there's light at the end of the tunnel, with or without a man.\n12\n\n**Truth or Dare**\n\nWINTER\n\n_Monday_\n\nI should like my new job because as my roommate said today, 'You're just like that girl in _a famous drama_ -\"a lot of girls would want her job, but she doesn't like it\".' That's true.\n\nThe office is busy like a train station when everyone is going to work, and unlike what was promised in my interviews the tasks are boring and people are always bothering me. The small choices I make are often changed at the last moment, making many days of my work pointless. People want me to find not just one hotel option, but four or five, even though they'll only stay for one night. I asked the girl who is teaching me if this constant checking and redoing of her work doesn't get annoying. 'But this is what you get paid for,' she said, and I kept quiet instead of saying I thought I got paid to use my thinking, in case she thought it was a criticism of her. I've got to be patient with her as she's only twenty-one and clearly working hard to make her way in the world.\n\nIt's not surprising that the person who had my job before left a nearly full plastic bottle of strong drink in her desk drawer. Looking at the rest of it, she didn't use the drink for cleaning...\n\nI have been feeling sad with my two best friends, Mot and Chandon.\n\n_Early in the week_\n\nWell, that didn't last long! I lost my job on Friday. That's what? A week? Luckily, I don't have a house full of precious adopted children. It's not good for my self-esteem, not good at all. But if you add up the strange hours, the way the job followed me home, the lack of talk from my bosses and no care for me, oh and the poor computer system, you can see that this was not the right job for me. 'It's just not working out,' they told me, and I had to agree. And it's not going to work for them unless they make their ideas, their computer network and their hopes better.\n\nCame home to my friend the couch and decided to have a messaging time. No answer from the Sailor in SC country, but CB Boy phoned back for a nice long talk. He invited me to come and stay in TO city, although maybe that will have to wait till I have a paying job. Then I messaged FR country Doctor, to ask if he was feeling playful.\n\n'We are just friends,' he typed.\n\n'Yes, a playful doctor,' I fired back, my mind making up games and imagining him playing with toys, a toy stethoscope hanging round his shoulders.\n\n'We should play doctor again, Alice, so fun and sweet.'\n\n'I imagine playing doctor with you, toys in hand .. . .'\n\n'I am in my room, thinking of you and playing .. . . ' he continued as I began to smile, then asked, 'Send me drawings.'\n\nSo I lowered my pants and showed the fluffy outline of my tummy. I had started to let my tummy hair grow from the narrow, summer line to a more grown-up shape, trimmed but like a triangle, which I prefer.\n\n'DON'T STOP, SHOW ME MORE! YOU MAKE ME SMILE! LOVE IT!' he sent in a message.\n\nThis was a challenge. I mean, how does one take pictures of one's own back? I began to understand a friend who once asked for my help to take photos of her smile for her faraway friend. And it was bedtime and there was no one to ask for help. Not that I know anyone who I can ask to take photos of my back for another friend.\n\nI lowered my pants a little more, listening for my friend's key in the door (this would be a little hard to explain to her), held my phone behind me and began clicking away.\n\nFirst try: a round shape like a peach with a line down the middle. Could be anything. Not very interesting.\n\nSecond try: too close. Is it a loaf of bread? A coloured blanket?\n\nThird: bingo! You can just about see the top of my legs and the edge of my lowered pants, my back at a funny angle.\n\n'My favorite toy in the world, so pretty,' he happily said, 'and soon will be mine again. I am almost ready to play, friend, one more game for me?'\n\nI agreed and he was happy: 'You are a girl for everything! Smart, fun, pretty, what a great mix! How can I resist? PS. Waiting for a drawing. Still excited.'\n\nSo that made him get a close-up drawing, just to make him quiet - a bit colorful but you couldn't see my face. 'As you can see, I need to clean up,' I said, pointing to the messy colors on the paper. 'Do I get to see a picture of your favorite toy?' I asked, imagining him pulling aside his doctor's toy bag to show a big toy, just before running off to play.\n\nSo let's hope this leads to a fun trip and a well-deserved play time on a soft sandy beach. And there you have it. While most people would look on the web for fun things and be running to the post box at night with a pile of letters, I was sitting on the sofa with my toy in the air, and my camera clicking away.\n\nMaybe I need to take my play time a bit more seriously?\n\n_Early in the morning_\n\nToday I received my fourth invitation to play. And this one was serious.\n\nNot a boy with a big boat. Not a boy who likes to play with swords throwing little stones at my window when it's really late, holding a bunch of flowers and asking to be friends again. Not a boy who's a doctor from FR country, just off a plane and showing off a ring he bought at the airport shop. Not a boy who's sorry, nor a boy who likes soft, warm clothes, nor the boy who flies planes.\n\nIt was a strange thing to ask for a first playdate, but I guess we have been friends for a long time. And no, it's not the boy from CA country. It's a new friend, Country Boy. Let me tell you again.\n\nWe met when he was asking me questions for a job which I didn't get and at that time I didn't know it, but he's actually three years younger than me. Like the sorry boy, he is strong, wears nice suits and is as confident as an older man. For some reason, even though he didn't give me the job, I seem to have made him remember me, and I'm always on his mind. When I sent a message to all my old friends to find out about job chances he seemed interested and has been oh-so-nicely 'watching' me on the internet ever since, which is strange to me.\n\nIt took me some time to understand that he was trying hard to be more friendly with me in messages, and I didn't take his friendly actions very seriously at all, choosing instead to tell him, 'I want to meet a boy I can marry and have kids with,' which has, after all, worked like a trick at making boys I both did and didn't want to be friends with go away in the past.\n\nThis seemed to bounce off Boy named Benjamin, and so I found myself sitting opposite him at a fancy place this evening. Well, after I turned up late. A whole hour late. Embarrassing and not like me, but maybe I was trying to confuse him.\n\nIt didn't work. He ordered a bottle of drink I didn't ask for, paid for my food even though he wasn't hungry, and started talking about his family, mentioned many people and, well, proposing.\n\nUnless a hopeful friend gives me a special gift, I've learned not to take proposals seriously, but it was still nice. But. I don't like him. And he told me he 'used to like someone famous' who was 'now like a sister to him' (hello, Boy named Patrick and his ex!)\n\n'Is her picture on your fridge?' I asked him, in case this was common with all men and their exes who are 'just like a sister'.\n\n'No,' he replied, 'but yours would be.' And he showed me a couple of photos of him and her on his phone, wearing the same glasses. How nice.\n\nI found myself thinking how his affection would be in private, his slightly big hands on my skin like a Boy named Kevin's big hands, discovering and checking out my body in his club's library. Unwanted attention and a good talk pushed onto me, yet not unliked or pushed away. A warm feeling spread from my tummy to my back.\n\nIf he thinks he really wants to marry me, he should prove it. Who am I to say I don't want to know him better while he treats me nicely and listens to me, and gets nothing in return except a small kiss.\n\n'A treat for my senses,' he sent me a message after I left in a rush, needing to be at my class and being late, 'let's do it again soon.'\n\nHe wants me to come play one weekend and for 'another drink, a later, longer one', not to forget 'warm fires and nuts, dressing for dinner, small church, warm drink ... . . and Alice, can I just say you are very, very beautiful.'\n\nAttention, nice words, a boy too young for me, a boy I don't like, fancy, warm clothes, KB ... . . My head tells me one thing, and yet my silly heart disagrees, pushed by my lonely tummy!\n\n_Early in the week_\n\nI did it. I made the decision.\n\nLast night Country Boy brought me to a bar for a drink, before we moved on to a party. Much talking and nice words were exchanged, but every time I asked him why he wanted to marry me he just replied, 'Why not?'\n\n'Are you sure you want children this young?' I asked him, partly joking, partly serious, my growing wish to be a mother being the biggest reason behind my wish to get married. 'When was the last time you changed a diaper?'\n\n'We'd have a helper for that,' he replied seriously.\n\n'You can have a helper?' I asked him with a funny smile. He agreed and I laughed loudly. Imagine that! 'A babysitter, maybe,' I added, 'but then I'd have to worry about you going away with her.'\n\n'I don't think any man who has you would leave with the babysitter,' he replied nicely.\n\nWhat I should have said was, 'I'm sorry, but I don't like you and I can't imagine promising to wake up next to you for the rest of my life,' but my body, excited by the nice drink and his full attention, seemed to think differently.\n\n'A city hall, a big church, a beach, me in a white suit - you'd look lovely in white,' and other ideas made us sit down in a corner, and I felt funny. My body was excited, for I-don't-know-what reason.\n\nI sat across from a boy named Benjamin who was three years younger than me. He was wearing a fancy jacket with shiny buttons and glasses that sat below his shiny forehead. I should have been looking for a way to leave, not listening to everything he said. I giggled at him more than with him, but I couldn't help but imagine us on a big bed in an old house. My smiles and playful teasing made him braver, until his fingers touched the back of my shirt.\n\n'I wish I could touch your skin,' he said. I waited for him to move my shirt aside, and leaned into his touch, listening to him talk about weekend trips, playing games, and how special I was. I thought I'd be sad if he didn't keep his promises, but if he did I wouldn't know what to do. It all seemed like pretend. I checked with my inner truth-teller, something I used to ignore when I was younger, but it didn't make a sound, so I think he meant everything he said, at least in that moment.\n\nI went home by myself. He sent me a message saying, 'I could be happy waking up next to you every day.' And I wouldn't want you any less.' Nice words. I was awake in the middle of the night.\n\nSo I sent a message to Tall Boy, offering to join him. Shortly after, he arrived in a car with a friend who was visiting, and took me to his 'house' in a far away place, where they also have games, but birds aren't usually involved.\n\nOn the back seat, he held my hand and looked at me in such a happy, charming way that I could see his eyes shine in the dim light. I am sure I looked back at him like a happy puppy too, feeling excited.\n\nWe stopped and he paid the driver, and then he led me and his friend in through the kitchen with its sticky floor and lots of dirty dishes, to the living room which was decorated with calendars of girls in bathing suits, stacks of old boys' magazines, a pile of dusty coins on a shelf, cans full of ash and enough empty bottles to start a small recycling project. I've seen cleaner sofas in trash piles. However, a quick look told me that I had read or wanted to read almost every book there, and his clothes were clean and folded by the ironing board, and he seemed to find the state of the house as funny as I did.\n\nThere was only one thing for me to do: say yes to his offer of a big glass of apple juice, take off my socks to wiggle my toes to some fun music and pick up the pretend guitar for a playful dance while waiting for the music to make me feel happy and ready to play more. How, I thought, did I go from drinking smoothies at a lovely place and thinking about weekends at a country house to this fun day?\n\nHis friend went upstairs to the spare room and we were finally alone. Tall Boy, or 'Thomas', gave me a big hug. 'I have missed you,' he said softly, and led me up to his room. I had missed him too. I was trying to remember when was the last time we'd had a sleepover - some time in the summer I think, and then only movie and play dates after that.\n\n'When we played upstairs at your old playroom I had so much fun because I was so excited. That was the most fun playdate I have ever had,' he shared in a soft voice, his hands gently touching my arm.\n\nWhen he hugs me, I feel safe, at home, caught up in our fun game. I really do forget about everything else, just like in a story. His soft lips and hair, his gentle hands could be part of my world forever.\n\n'One day,' he said, 'I met you for the first time.' 'Yes,' I replied, 'I had a short red dress on that day.' 'I remember,' he smiled, 'I thought - she won't like me - but you did.' 'Of course I do,' I told him. 'I've liked you for over a year,' he said, and it sounded like he was stating something very clear. This much is obvious, I thought.\n\n'You remind me of a childhood friend,' he said, 'I like your pretty face, your hair, your skin. You are this lovely, smart girl.' He seemed to mean it. I wondered, if he likes me this much, why doesn't he want to be more than just friends?\n\nHe was very kind to me, his actions showing his feelings for me. This paragraph is inappropriate and not suitable for revision to a preschool level. I fell asleep a little later.\n\n_One morning_\n\nAfter I told my truth to Thomas, everything was oddly calm between us. I was partly proud of myself for being brave and honest, and partly hoped he didn't see my tears when it was dark. I also hoped he would think my loving words were just because of the drink and the overall feeling after our special time.\n\nToday, I tried to find out when that office holiday party was that he asked me to join this week. 'Lots of customers will be there,' he messaged back, 'why don't we meet when I come back next week? I'll be away this weekend.' Oops, my mistake: and I thought the customers being there would be the reason for having a dressed-up, tall blonde girl with him?\n\nI called him to share my thoughts, which, of course, turned into playful talk and general updates. Hearing his voice made me happy. His explanation made me feel better than his message had, and I wished him a good night and a fun trip. I promised myself that I would remove his number and not see him again before the holiday, for my own peace. Then I called Thomas back.\n\n'You're very good at this.'\n\n'I've been called many things,' he joked, 'but never that.'\n\n'Why not? What does smooth mean?' \n\n'Someone who says a lot of things, who tells people what they want to hear.'\n\n'Well, you told me a lot of nice things that I wanted to hear very much, like saying your mom and dad would love to meet me, or you liked me for a year, or that I was your dream friend.'\n\n'That is true.' Even though I couldn't see him, I could hear the smile in his voice. 'But those weren't just words. My mom and dad _would_ love to meet you. My mom's always asking me to bring friends home.'\n\n'I'm away next week,' he continued, 'but I'll call you when I get back.'\n\n'Actually,' I paused, 'I'm thinking the opposite.'\n\n'What do you mean?' he asked, sounding confused.\n\n'I think it might be best if you don't call. Every time we meet we have a fun time, but we're not just pals, are we? Pals don't hold hands and go on dates.'\n\n'True.'\n\n'You told me you don't want a girlfriend,' I continued, 'but you've been sending me mixed signals since the moment I saw you, and I just want everything to be clear. It's hard for me to see you and feel really close to you and to hear all these things from you and then not see you again for a long time. 'I don't want this kind of friendship,' said Sophia. 'I want to be with a friend who is there for me, who gives me a card on my birthday, and wants to spend time with me. You like to play with your friends and have fun. That's okay, but it makes me sad when you play with others.'\n\n'But you play with others too, Sophia,' said Sam. For the first time, I could hear something like worry or not liking it much in his voice.\n\n'True. But the difference is, it makes me feel bad and it doesn't make you feel bad.'\n\nHe didn't say anything.\n\n'I don't know if you heard me the other night when I said I really, really like you. I needed to tell you because you can't know what I'm thinking. You thought I'd been busy since the summer, but I was just trying not to get too close to someone who doesn't really want to be my best friend.'\n\nI knew what he was going to say. If he had really wanted to be my best friend, he would have spent more time with me, he would have tried to be nice and always there, and he would have stopped playing with other friends and wanted me to do the same.\n\n'I'm sorry,' he said, noticing how I was about to cry, 'maybe we should just be friends then. I'd like that.'\n\nAnd so it was. We stopped talking without knowing when we might meet again, but it's okay. I have enough pals already. The only thing I'm missing is a man who wants to become a husband from being a boyfriend.\n\n**Final Chapter**\n\nIn a strange way, I'm thankful to him. It felt nice to have a truthful, open chat.\n\nHe'd said it himself: he'd liked me for a year, which is good, but he also decided that this wouldn't be the start of a loving relationship and I need to understand this.\n\nI knew he didn't want a girlfriend, so I kept my choices open and yet I started to like him. It's time to say that I'm to blame too: I decided to be hopeful about love even though my instincts told me otherwise.\n\nI couldn't stop myself from saying 'I love you' but it felt like something bigger, like admitting that I was ready to love someone again, and I could say it loudly and not worry about what might happen! Chatting with him has made me see that I'm not scared to like someone and get hurt, and I'm not scared to tell the person I love about my feelings. After talking about my hopes with him, I feel closer to myself and my own dreams and wants.\n\nSo, he's not perfect. Can anyone show me someone who is? I'm happy I can love and accept him for who he is, but I can't make him love me back. And I am _really_ glad I don't have to be the one to clean up his messy house.\n\nIt didn't hurt me to speak my feelings, and it won't hurt me to leave him, now that I know he doesn't want the same as me. Because I was truthful with him he won't be able to 'have' me any more in a way I've now understood I don't want because it feels more like giving up than being free. Because he was truthful with me I don't feel forced to ruin his calendars or hide smelly things under his floorboards. Not all boys are dishonest, like the puppet boy - I actually feel sad for _him_ now because he was in love with a girl who didn't love him back and instead tried to be with me. If I don't want to be like him, it's up to me to understand who is right for me and who isn't, and I think my time with the boys I met over the past time should really help me with this.\n\nI'll try to stay away from someone who is giving all his time and money to his job, like the Airman, or someone who needs to grow up a bit more before taking on big tasks, like Nice Past Boyfriend and Kevin, or someone who talks about love but doesn't know how to show it - like Charlie. I don't want to be fooled by someone who has all the fancy toys but doesn't laugh at my jokes, like the Ball Player, or someone who has a cool hobby but no time, like Boat Boy, or who has a strong body but doesn't talk much (Benjamin). I don't want to be disrespected like I was by Cameron, I want to be truthful about what I seek and not play pretend like David, and most of all I don't want to end up like Sophia with a beautiful baby but no father to help because I didn't wait.\n\nFinding out that having many friends is more about feeling good than true love doesn't mean I regret my adventures in making friends, but I now want something more meaningful.\n\nI used to be okay with how my friends wanted our friendships to be - meet-ups, weekends away, best friends who never see each other - but from now on I want to set some rules for boys who want to be my friend.\n\nI think that my talk wasn't really for Thomas. It was more about speaking the words than about him listening or responding. A promise of plan. I'm suddenly a lot clearer about what I really, truly want, and it's not Thomas, or Kevin, or Patrick or a mindless friend, it's someone who's in love with me, and a friendship where that love is enough for both of us.\n\nSince Thomas helped me understand what I'm missing, I am hopeful that a perfect friend for me and all my faults is still out there somewhere. I'm sure it'll be easier to recognize it when I find it.\n\n'He's already born,' said my grandma in HO country.\n\nI sure hope so.\n\nThis book tells true stories from the writer's life.

I'm not really good at it, but I enjoy it, and sometimes I've tried hard to run as fast as I can. And almost all the runners I've met, including those trying to finish a race faster than before, are proud of their times. Faster than last time. Yes!\n\nA while ago, I joined a running group. For the first time, I ran with a group shirt and raced as part of a team. How I did could change where our whole team ended up. So I tried as hard as I could to finish my race faster than 45 minutes, like when I was younger. But I was stuck at 48 minutes, maybe a bit less if it was a good day.\n\nThen I started to train in a small group with Jack just once a week. The training was no more than an hour, including getting ready, stretching, cooling down and breaks for rest in between. Unlike the long runs I kept doing to get better, the sessions with Jack made me feel good. Each training taught me something new about running and about me.\n\nI got stronger, more flexible, and better at handling being out of breath. And, just like magic, when I was 53 years old, I did better at running 10 miles than I did when I was younger, 22 years ago. My time for running a long race dropped from 48 minutes to something in the 43 minutes. And I did better at running a really long race -- by six minutes.\n\nWhen someone who isn't young anymore does better at running than they did when they were younger, it means something is happening. The things Julian has thought of can help all people who run, whether they are young or old, very good or just okay, new to running or have been doing it for a long time. I know this because I have seen it myself, which is why I wanted to work with him on this book. These are things that people who run need to know.\n\nDavid\n\n## BEGINNING\n\n_A Happy Place_\n\nThis book is about something that lots of people don't know about: the art of running.\n\nThe way you move, how you plan your running, how you get ready for races, how you become sure and determined, and how you plan your strategies--all of these things are part of the art of running.\n\nBut people who run often think that the results depend on just two things. One, of course, is being naturally good at it. And people often think that the other is just being very stubborn, the will to keep running mile after mile, week after week. They think that nothing else will make them a better runner. Nothing else will help them do as well as they can: Just spend more time running. Work hard. If you don't have enough time, you can't run faster or finish a long race. You've hit your limit.\n\nThat's not right.\n\nSometimes, for unknown reasons, people do much better than before--much better than they thought they could.\n\nWhy does this happen?\n\nIn running and most games, planning and hard work matter a lot. Trying, checking, and watching--the science way--are important. Adam and his dad, Peter, used a science way to practice, and it helped Adam break 11 world records and win two gold medals. So, your practice should follow good science rules.\n\nBut Adam's family also liked art: His mom was an actress; his sister danced. And Adam was able to use his mind and body to reach a special state where timing, balance, calm, and focus were perfect--and that was more than just science. Knowing how to do things, being smart and the power to use the mind can help you reach there, too.\n\nPeople are different. What works for one might not work for another. Running is a game for thinking people. Following a strict schedule might help one runner but hurt another with injuries. We all, from fun runners to big race runners, need to watch and see what works for us and what does not.\n\nSometimes, if we listen to our own wins and losses, if we think rather than just move without thinking, we learn surprising lessons. Let me give you one example from my own experience.\n\nIt was a day in the beginning of the year. The Big Race in our EN country was coming up, and it was important to me. I'd run it ever since I was a kid, when I'd come in second, and later as a teenager, when I'd come in third. I had seen back then what a big event the grown-up men's race was. You'd see many, many runners start in a big, competitive group, all trying to get away from the group and get to the front as they started on the long path. The ground would shake as they ran by. The path was three laps of three miles each, and usually by the third lap the front-runners would pass those in the back: The whole event was one continuous race of muddy, tired men.\n\nThe race was very important because it was the race to pick the team for the Big World Race. The first nine people to finish would be on the EN country team. There was only one chance, no other way to get to the Big World Race. If I wanted to be on the team, I needed to run very well that day.\n\nI had been running well all winter, and besides that, I was pushed by a bit of upset feelings. The year before, I wasn't picked for the big sports team, even though I was the fastest runner. I felt the team's leaders had been unfair, so I wanted to show them that I could do it.\n\nI also had another reason to do well in the big race. I was a worker in the Flying People's Group. Just two months before the race, I was sent to a far away place, nearly 200 miles from my house and my coach, Mr. Harry. So, I didn't have my usual routine anymore. I didn't mind because that was part of being a worker. But in the far away place, I was surprised by how mean my boss was. He told me on the first day, 'I'm going to show you, you can't be a Flying Group worker and a famous runner. You have to pick one.'\n\nHe often made it hard for me to train and race, giving me extra work just as I was about to train with other Flying Group runners. I couldn't run as much that winter. But, I was very determined, so I used my anger to keep going. I'm going to show him I can do both, I thought.\n\nI had spent most of my life showing people that I could do well in school _and_ be a runner, and that I could finish school _and_ be a famous runner. But I had never felt so negative and obstructed before.\n\n'You didn't really believe all that talk about the Air Force encouraging sports--that was just a story', my boss, Benjamin, said to me. Now you're in the real Air Force. You have to do your job like everyone else! We can't have you leaving all the time while your friends have to work for you.'\n\nAnd he was right about that. But in my mind, that didn't make it right for him to give me more work, just to make me give up and 'show' that I'd have no time or energy to run.\n\nSo I was feeling strong and determined. I felt happy every time I could escape and run--and even happier when I could race.\n\nI'd done well in the Big Race before, especially in a year not so long ago, when I'd come in fifth and made the England team for the second time. At the World Race in a place far away that year, I'd come in ninth and was the first English guy to finish, helping England to win the team title, though I'm sad to say that my friend and competitor Steve, who is also from the Air Force, finished a little ahead of me that day.\n\nIn the coming year, I hoped to do well again and make the team that would go to the World Race in a place called MA city. I had reason to hope: Not long before being sent to HA city, I'd run in a big race in the south of LO city, where I just managed to beat Steve, coming in third after two people from far away. Two months after I moved to a new place, Steve ran faster than me in a big race. But I felt good about how I ran, even if I didn't win. Then, a week before another big race, I got hurt.\n\nWe used to run in shoes that looked like spike shoes and didn't have much of a heel. I was running in a big race in a place by the sea. The track was flat and fast, and I was running really fast. We had to run through a big puddle. This happens a lot in races; you run through the water and hope there's nothing in it. But I was unlucky: I stepped on a brick and hurt my heel. I started to limp a bit, but it wasn't too bad.\n\nThe next time, during the last lap, Steve and I were trying to beat each other. It was a good race. Steve once said, 'If I am still standing at the end of the race, hit me with a board and knock me down, because that means I didn't run hard enough.' According to a story I read, Steve was strong, tough, and real--just the kind of friend I liked to race with. Over time, I know our fun competition brought out the best in both of us, for our team and for the GB team.\n\nWhen we got to the big puddle during our second round, I tried not to step where I had before. But it happened again! Maybe it was a different stone, but the same foot hurt. This time the hurt was so bad I had to stop for a bit.\n\nThere was only a little way left in the race, and I started again. Adam beat me by a small amount of time.\n\nI wasn't too upset about losing the big game to my team friend, but I was worried about my foot getting better before the big race. It hurt a lot. It hurt to run, hurt to walk--it even hurt to just stand--and I only had seven days to feel better.\n\nThe hurt happened on the day after Thursday. The big race was going to be on the day after Friday in the next week.\n\nYou're always looking for the best way to get ready before a big race. That's usually affected by a few things: the other games you have, how you feel, and even the weather. But usually, getting ready for an important game like the big race, I would have gone for a long run the day after Saturday before the race. And I would still have practiced two times a day as the race got closer.\n\nBut on the day after Friday I couldn't run at all. So that kind of getting ready was not possible. I put cold on my foot and wished it to get better.\n\nBy the end of the week, even though it still hurt to walk, I found I could run on my toes around the soft room at my family's house without it hurting. Happy, but still a bit worried, I thought to try a little run and did an easy two miles.\n\nBut my foot still hurt. And the big race was now just six days away.\n\nI had a path around the Army place at H city where I practiced in the evenings. On Monday, although my noon run on grass had been a bit painful, I thought it might be good to try to run on a smooth, well-lit road. When I tried it that evening, I found out I _could_ run--and that it was actually more comfy to run fast than to run slowly, because when I ran fast I was more up on my toes.\n\nSo I didn't want to go at a steady pace, and I didn't want to run far. The only choice was a short, quick run. I tried three times one lap, each about 1,400 steps, with two minutes rest between. My foot, well padded in shoes, felt OK. I was happy. Though I did some short noon runs on soft grass that week, my real practice had to be fast--weight forward, up on my toes, really going for it.\n\nFeeling good that I didn't feel sick, I did just two of the same running exercises on Wednesday, going as fast as I could, with a good four minutes of rest in between.\n\nIt was the day after Wednesday, just two days before the race, before I tried running in my special shoes. This would be the real test because I knew I would have to run the big race in special shoes, if I could run it at all. That lunchtime, I did a quick, tough workout--six times running hard, with the last part flat out each time--on nice soft, muddy grass on the open space that runs alongside the H town. If I'd felt sick after that workout, that would have been it. No big race.\n\nSo for better or worse, that was it. No long Sunday run and not my normal amount of training, either. Just three short, tough workouts--quite hard--on the first day, Wednesday and the day after Wednesday before the race.\n\nThe big race that year was at PH park, just above the L city, only a few miles from where I lived at the time. Also known as TH, it's the entry to HH, a big area of hilly land crossed by paths. I'd been running on HH since I was 13, in school races and for my club, SH, and had won many races there over the years. For the last few years, until I moved to YO place, I had been practicing in the field a few times a week. I knew it very well.\n\nOn Friday, I took a day off from my job to go to LO city and look at part of the path, walking and running in my shoes, just testing my foot and seeing how I felt.\n\n'Feeling tired', I wrote in my practice book. 'Don't feel good. Foot a bit sore'.\n\nThe foot, even though it was better, still hurt. The ground was hard and cold, and I was worried. If the ground was still hard the next day, I might not be able to run. I was hoping for it to warm up--for it to warm up and lots of rain.\n\nThe next day, it rained a lot and during the young races, the field became very muddy. It was, I thought, a wonderful, great, beautiful day. Maybe I would be able to race after all.\n\nAll the best runners in the country come to the National Championships, of course, and the group that year was very good. After our recent races, most people thought Steve would win. He was a very good runner who set a record for the long race and he won the LO and NE city races too.\n\nBecause he was from WA country, he didn't need to run the English National, because he would be chosen to run for WA country in the World Run. Indeed, as a boy named William, he usually would not have been allowed to join in the EN race; his own race was the WH Championships, which he won many times. But, in a time long ago, the rules let him join a club in a place called BE city, and so he could join in the EN race, a much bigger race, and a prize he really wanted to win.\n\nThen there was a boy named Mike, the Fast Train, who later won a shiny prize in the long run in LA city in the middle of the 20th century. And don't forget about David, who won a golden prize in the short run in the Commonwealth Games and would break the world record for the middle run soon after. And another boy named David, who would finish in a high place in the World Running Championships in RO city the next year.\n\nMany other great runners from BR land were there, too--Mike, Benjamin, Thomas, and new runners named Steve and Ryan. And almost 1,800 other runners, too. I think the only famous runner missing was a boy named Nathan, who had won the National race the year before but was running the US Championships this year instead.\n\nAfter a slow warm-up with a friend named Patrick, one of my SH friends, I put on my special shoes and tried a few faster runs. The ground was so soft that I put in my long spikes--the longest you could get--for better grip. Everywhere, kids were getting ready to race. I suddenly saw one of them, an old school buddy named Benjamin, who had won the school race 10 years before. I hadn't seen him much since then. He saw me, too, came towards me--and suddenly fell down in the mud. It was very slippery and, surprisingly, he was wearing only everyday shoes. He stood up, we wished each other good luck and, sadly, I never saw him again. But I don't think he could have finished the race in those shoes.\n\nI felt good and relaxed doing my final race preparations. But the warm-up doesn't tell you much. At PA Hill, the moment when you know what kind of day you're going to have is after the first few minutes of the race. The start is uphill for a short distance. And that can feel like a very long distance if you don't feel good, knowing you've still got a long way to go. Sometimes you reach the top of that first hill and feel like you want the race to be over.\n\nBut there's no stopping at the start. In a race this big, it's important to be near the front right away. If you get stuck in the crowd, you're in trouble.\n\n'The start of a big cross country race is like riding a horse in the middle of a buffalo rush', the AM country runner Ethan once said after racing in one. 'It's exciting if you go fast, but one slip and you're only footprints'.\n\nThis was really true of the Big Race.\n\nThe start sound and we began, a lot of us, running fast on a muddy field. Well, one less of us, actually--Matthew was still taking off his sport clothes and he started late by a little time. Not knowing this, I got to the top of the first hill in second or third place, feeling good! Then a small dip, a run up another small hill, and I was in first place, only part of the way into the race. _Without trying hard!_ What was happening?\n\nI remember telling myself, 'Don't go first now.' The plan was to wait until the start of the third round, when everyone would be tired and I could use my strength to try to go ahead. But the way I felt that day, I just couldn't go any slower. It would have been uncomfortable. So I thought to myself, 'It's OK, I'm moving well. Don't worry. Just keep your pace and keep going.'\n\nUsually in a race you have to really try hard and make a clear move if you want to leave your rivals behind. But now I just kept running--and nobody followed me. 'I'm not even trying', I thought. 'Where did they go?' I still remember that feeling, even after many years. It was magical!\n\nDuring a race, I never look back, so I didn't know if others were close behind me. But I couldn't hear anyone, so I knew I was far ahead. But how far, I wasn't sure.\n\nI had family and friends watching me on the path--my wife, Sophia, and her mom and dad; my coach, Henry; my best friend who also loves running, Patrick; and many members and supporters from my running club, including David and Benjamin, who used to coach me. They would shout to me as I ran past, so I could guess what was happening behind me.\n\nWhen I finished the first part of the race, I found out later, I was 40 seconds ahead of the next person. 'Slow down, Jack!' I heard Patrick shout worriedly. 'Don't rush! You still have a long way to go.'\n\nI knew what Patrick was worried about. He had seen me mess up on the running track in a big race at a stadium in 1978--the race that would decide who goes to the Games that year. In that race, I had decided to go ahead early to avoid getting wet and muddy after a big rain just before the race. I had run quite fast for a bit. At the middle point, Benjamin had run past others and was about to set a new record. Michael and Frank also passed me, and I was fourth--with only three to be chosen. I had almost made it, several times.\n\nNow, Patrick was worried I might do the same thing again. He tried to encourage me, but I knew what 'take it easy' really meant: It was his way of saying, 'Don't do something silly! Don't repeat that mistake!'\n\nBut I kept to my calm, steady pace. On the second lap, I heard Patrick's voice again, sounding less worried and more excited.\n\n'You're still going fast!' he shouted. 'It's amazing! You're a minute ahead.'\n\nHe sounded like he couldn't really believe it--and I definitely couldn't. It was like being in a dream. I wasn't tired at all and I was barely breathing!\n\nBy the end of the second lap, actually, my lead was more than a minute, which was not common. I had a bit more to run and I felt as strong as ever. I kept moving, easily able to choose my path and avoid the worst of the mud, which during the race had spread across the green field.\n\nIt was strange. Usually, a race is noisy and tiring, with pushing, heavy breathing and the noise of people cheering for their teams. The distance passed quickly in the excitement of the race. This time the track was very quiet. Without the race to focus on, all I could do was keep my pace. It was like riding a wave.\n\nOn the last round, I began to hear happy cheers from everyone--friends, family, and even people I didn't know.\n\n'No one else is near!' someone shouted.\n\n'You're so far in front you can stop and have a snack!'\n\n'Great job, Goat! Are you sure you didn't take a shortcut?'\n\nThere were even a few 'Well done, Julian', from the supporters of a boy named Steve.\n\nPeople meant well but these words didn't help much. I was focused, and I didn't want to start laughing and waving. I still had work to do. I remember talking to myself, trying to stay focused.\n\n'Keep riding that wave', I said.\n\nWith no one else close, I never got too tired. Up the hills, down the hills, it all felt good, my pace fast, relaxed and long. If only you could run like that every day!\n\nIn the end, covered with mud, I was the first to finish. I was the champion of the English running race! I won by a lot and did what my club friend and once training buddy, a famous runner named David, one of my heroes, did.\n\nI once told people, 'That was the easiest run of my life. It was just like a small race at my club.'\n\nIt felt like a long time before I saw other runners. A newspaper said that I was already in my casual clothes and giving autographs before David, the runner who came second, finished the race.\n\nAnyway, my time was really fast. David finished much later. I had won by almost two full minutes--a record that still exists. Matthew was third. Daniel ended up fourth--an amazing run, especially since he was late to start by half a minute. My old friend, Sam, was fifth.\n\nAnd my foot? It didn't bother me at all. It was better.\n\nIt's hard to say exactly what made that day so special. But _something_ had happened: I had run much faster than some of the best runners in the world. And if I wanted to run my best in the future, it was important to understand why things went so well that day.\n\nSome of it is always things you can't control. I was motivated by being upset about not being chosen for a big race the year before and by being angry at my boss at HA town. The rain, of course, helped. And I realized that the huge relief of being able to run, after being scared of not being able to run, made me feel strong in my mind.\n\nAlso, there's no doubt that the different race preparation because of my hurt foot--my focus on quicker activities instead of longer ones--made me ready to go. I had to say that if I hadn't hurt my foot--and had instead done my usual race preparation--I might not have won the race.\n\nI learned a lot from that time: In later years I tried to do that kind of race preparation again. Although I didn't win any more races by two minutes, I often did better in races than how fit I was.\n\nAnd that is what I want for you. Running, you see, is not just about being stubborn, about just running a lot and hoping for the best on race day. You can train smarter and learn what works for you. You can change your training so you're at your best at certain times. This is the great goal--to find out how to get in the zone, how to use the power of the mind together with how fit you are at just the right time.\n\nA big part of running smarter is good technique--which means running in such a way that you don't waste energy working against yourself.\n\nIt's funny. Everyone knows the importance of technique in swimming and cycling. Yet many people think it doesn't make much difference in running. But how do the best runners make it look so easy? They move, their feet lightly touching the ground, almost falling into the next step. They don't waste their energy; they use it to run faster. These are about how to move, when to move, and keeping balance.\n\nIf your goal is to run fast, why practice running slow? Why make slow walking perfect? If you want to run past friends at the end of a hard race, why practice slowing down when you get tired? Shouldn't you practice running faster?\n\nAnd many runners think stretching is only about not getting hurt. They touch their toes a few times, then start their long run. But stretching is also about letting you run in a more relaxed, longer way. When your back and legs are tight, every step you take in a race takes a little more work. Every step is a little shorter, too. If two runners are just as fit, the one who can stretch more will run more easily--and go faster, further, with less work.\n\nIt is also important to think about what, in particular, stops you, what keeps you from running faster? Is it your breathing? Your legs? Your strength, arms, or maybe even your belly, both in terms of your belly muscles and your bravery? Is it your basic speed that lets you down? You can make plans to get better at things. What things have made you do good in races and what hasn't helped at all? Maybe you did your best in a practice. Why did it happen in practice and not in a race you tried so hard for?\n\nWe live in a time when we think we can explain everything with science. We hear a lot about how to be the best we can be and the big words that go with it. But this knowledge alone does not make you any better, nor does measuring things guarantee a certain result. You still have to go and do your best on race day, even if the practice you did last week was the best you'd ever done. Of course how well you do on race day depends on how fit you are. But many other things also matter that help you do your best on the day.\n\nNo one has yet figured out the connection between any one practice and getting better. And I don't think anyone ever will, because the best amount and intensity of practice, and how fast it works, is different for each person. In fact, these things can even be different at different times for the same person. Sometimes a less hard practice can be more helpful than one that's harder.\n\nScience is very important, but there's more to consider. Thinking positively, focusing, and encouraging yourself and others is also helpful. But how do we truly use our minds to do our best?\n\nIf we only focus on the science of running faster, we might start to think about using chemicals to help us. This isn't good because it could hurt the way people see sports.\n\nThere are many science studies out there. They can give hard, complex, and sometimes different advice on how to practice and how much and how hard. But there's no special method; there's no special practice. We're all unique with different good things and things we need to work on, and different ways we live; and we practice in different places.\n\nI think half of practice is about art, not science. It's about trusting your gut and feelings, being sure and believing, tactics and wanting to do well, calming down and focusing. You need to find what works best for you to do your best.\n\nWhen I was in competitions, I was lucky to run with many great athletes. David and I ran for the same team and had the same coach, Bob. Steve and I were friends and competitors in the RAF. Steve and I also had the same coach, Henry, and practiced together. We were all the same as runners. We were all strong, we could run well, and we trained in similar ways. We worked hard, but we made it fun. Sadly, only Oliver could run really fast!\n\nI learned many things from them, and you can learn too. In this book, I will talk about important things using stories from their lives, from my life, and from other great runners I knew. I have also learned a lot from coaching runners of all levels, and I will share some of those stories too.\n\nI hope to make you think more about your own running. I want to help your brain and your feet move a little faster. This makes running less hard and more varied, less tiring and more energizing. Running should be about challenge, not boredom. Above all, it should be fun.\n\nI want to help you reach a state where you feel fit in body, mind and heart. This state lets you do a great run that you didn't think you could do. I'd like you to have days where you do better than you thought, when running feels easy. I want you to feel the way I did on a day a long time ago. I will try my best to help you understand not just the science of running, but also the art of running, for top athletes and normal people alike.\nWelcome to the first part, all about building something that will help you run faster. You might find some chapters surprising.\n\nOne chapter is about how to run. Many people don't think this is important for long-distance runners, but it's very important to learn the correct way from the beginning. If not, it's like holding a violin bow the wrong way or using the wrong grip on the tennis racquet for your first year or two: You learn bad habits that are hard to change.\n\nI also begin talking about running faster in chapter 2, where I talk about speed play as a way to start getting used to running faster. People who think building this involves little more than slow plodding will find it hard to get out of that slow rhythm later. The idea that one day your feet will move faster, your knees will come up higher and your steps will be longer when you've never practiced running fast is wrong. Running faster isn't something to wait until after the base is ready. Running faster is part of the base.\n\nSo start off right: Practice running well, and practice running fast.\n\n#### Chapter 1\n\n#### Trying Harder\n\nBefore we start our first training, I ask the runners who come to me for advice a simple question: What is stopping you from running faster? What makes you stop when someone running faster than you passes by? How does it _feel_?\n\nOften, they haven't thought about it or they find it hard to say. Is it your legs, I ask? Your breath? Maybe your arms? Or your tummy?\n\nAnd after they think about it, maybe for the first time in their running games, more often than not they say it's their breath. Their legs may be ready, but the out-of-breath feeling tells them: No faster! They feel they are leaving their safe zone.\n\n'If I run any faster', they say, 'I'm not sure I'll be able to make it to the end.'\n\n'Well, how often do you get out of breath when you play?' I ask.\n\n'Oh, I'm not _meant_ to get out of breath', is the surprisingly common answer. 'I read a book that says I'm supposed to stay within certain lines. Am I _supposed_ to get out of breath when I play?'\n\nAnd I say, 'Yes, you _are_ supposed to get out of breath. Absolutely. You should get out of breath--at least sometimes--in most of your games. Even on a normal run, you can try a little harder up a hill or do a little fast running. Try, then rest, preferably without stopping--but don't worry to stop if you need to. Just use the break to have a quick stretch.'\n\nOf course, when I take these runners out for their first run on the roads or through the woods of my hometown in SE country, it's easy for me to see what slows them down the most. But I ask them first because I want them to start thinking about it and to feel what their bodies are telling them. We're all different, which is why following a strict plan you found in a book or maybe on the internet is not such a good idea. It wasn't made just for _you_.\n\nThis is where the runner's skill comes in: To make a training program that helps you run better, you have to really look at what slows you down the most. If you want to run faster, you've got to push past those things that slow you down. Otherwise, they're going to stay just as they are, keeping you from running faster than you do now.\n\nTake for example the runners who think their breathing slows them down the most. If they decide to be careful--'Oh, I should _never_ get out of breath'--they won't make their lungs stronger, which is just what they need. They won't learn how to deal with being out of breath, nor will they learn how to feel better after having been out of breath, which are things they'll need if they're going to race well.\n\nNot just that. They will also need these skills to get strong enough to practice better and different ways--and learn a wider range of practice results. In other words, it will not only be their skill to race, but also their skill to practice well that will be limited if they only follow a plan that says never going above a certain heart beat, never getting out of breath, or always staying in the 'fat-burning area'--which itself is a bit of a wrong idea.\n\nA runner who practices without getting out of breath won't give his heart a good exercise either. And if his breathing is the first thing that tells him he's working too hard, his legs won't be getting stronger, because they won't be put under any pressure.\n\nThe result will be that nothing much changes. Next year and the year after, those limiting things will be just as limiting. And that runner will still be posting the same times he does today.\n\nMaybe you're one of the runners who's stuck on the start line. Staying at the same level is not what you want, or you wouldn't be working so hard--or looking for advice. This book is made to help you get going, and start making real progress.\n\nHere's a key rule to remember as you make your practice plan:\n\nBut many runners' practice is one-dimensional. 'When I started off, I could only do five miles', you'll hear them say. 'I'm getting better--I can now walk 15 miles.'\n\nThis is good, but it just means they can walk more, not that they can walk faster. Their times for short or one mile walks may not have improved much. These walkers only want to manage longer walks. They go from short walks, to medium walks, then long walks. Then what? Just more of the same. There's nowhere else for them to go.\n\nI'm saying, go back to short or even one mile walks. Try to get faster at these walks, even if you want to walk longer. But many walkers think walking faster is hard and walking longer at a slow pace is easy.\n\nThis is not true. No matter how long the walk, the easy part is to finish it quickly. A five-hour walk can be harder than a three-hour walk. And walking around a park--10,000 steps--in 50 minutes rather than 28 minutes can be tough.\n\n'Even in long walks, you know you can walk the distance', I tell them. 'What you need is to walk faster. Are you getting better at walking faster?'\n\n'Hmm, maybe not', they'll answer. 'I haven't tried that.'\n\nWell, it's definitely worth giving it a shot. A while back, an older lady named Charlotte Morrison asked me for running tips. She wanted to do well in the big running races. She liked to run 10K--5K was a bit short for her, and she felt she was slow at 1,500 metres.\n\nNow, five years later, having gotten much better at running and having changed her training to include more fast running and strength building, she has won lots of first and second place medals at 5,000 metres and 10,000 metres in the big running races. Even more amazing (to her), she has set a world best for age 70 for the 1,500 metres--running it in a little over six minutes, which is almost eight seconds faster than the old record. And--no surprise to me--she also broke the record for 5K. She ran it in about 22 minutes, which is a whole half a minute faster than the old world record.\n\nShe never thought that she could run that fast. But by focusing on the shorter races, she did even better in the longer ones. By getting stronger, she actually ran faster--and for longer.\n\nJust like Charlotte, many regular runners who train for a long time but not necessarily fast are trying their best to improve. They might actually be trying a bit too hard: They focus too much on how far and how hard they run rather than on their strategy and skill. Some kids think if they want to run faster, they just have to try harder instead of training in a smarter way. Some follow exactly what they read in books, which tells them to run slower, but for a longer time.\n\nSome kids are so worried about how hard they are running that they only pay attention to their heart beats. They want to keep their heart beating at a certain speed during the whole run, and they forget about other important things. They let their heart beats decide their training.\n\nOther kids may be scared that if they run too fast, they will need to stop before they finish their running route. And if they stop in the middle, they think it means they have failed, right? We all know that.\n\nWell, I think all of these ideas are not true. Let's talk about these wrong thoughts one by one.\n\nChecking your heart beats can be helpful, but it's just a tool, not the most important part of training. The best way to use it is to measure how quickly your heart beats return to a normal speed.\n\nIn a race, maybe in the first part of a long run, you can also use it to control your speed: You can try to keep your heart beats at a certain speed to help you run at a steady pace and stop you from running too fast at the beginning. But a heart rate checker should not control your exercise, though it can give useful information.\n\nReally, it's good to know how hard you're working by your breath, not your heart beat. This is because (a) you can feel your breath, and (b) figuring out your max heart beat and any part of it can be tricky and confusing. The right way to figure out what part of your max heart beat is good for different levels of hard work is so tricky that I think it's better to leave it.\n\nThe main thing is that there is nothing bad with making your heart beat fast, working as hard as your breath lets you. Know what you can handle. Try things out! If you feel you work too hard, just slow down or stop completely.\n\nAnd why is stopping bad? In my view, when you're exercising you can stop as much as you want. Just make sure you _need_ to stop. Maybe you started your run too fast. In that case, you've learned something about speed. You've found out where the limit of your ability is at that time, which is something you won't know if all your exercise is careful. Or, of course, you might be doing an exercise where you plan to stop and rest because they let you work harder than you could otherwise--pushing your limits, which is the goal of exercise. Taking a break is not a problem. You can use it to breathe, stretch, and maybe look at the things around you.\n\nThe part about never running fast when practicing will not help you get better. Like a hamster on a wheel, you can run and run but not move forward.\n\nThis brings us to the five Ss: You're not just looking for energy. You're not just looking to go as far as you can. You want to run better. And even if you are trying for a big race like a very long run or a big race with swimming and biking too, the way to get better is to remember that there are many things that can slow you down. Your practice should work on all of these things: Getting faster, better at running, and more flexible will also help your energy.\n\nAnd this is what I think about learning to run faster:\n\nThis is how the best runners get to be the best. They're strong and flexible, they're fast and have energy--and they run well, which means running in a way that uses their fitness best. And their practice has made them strong in their minds, which is just as important as the other things they need, maybe even more.\n\nAll these things are just as important for runners in a club. Why work on all that energy if your body is so stiff that it takes twice as much energy as it should to make it move forward? Why do you need to become stronger in your mind if you're not so good at running yet? It's like you're not using all the energy you have. You don't have to be the best runner in the world; you just need to be the best you can. And I think you'll find that doing different things keeps you happy, and makes running more fun too.\n\nIn this book, I'll give advice on how to get better at all five Ss and also how to be stronger in your mind. You need to practice all of them.\n\nAnd always remember this: All of your practice should have a goal--to get better at one or more of these things. Practicing without a goal won't help you, and it might even be bad for you.\n\nLet's look at each of these things that can make you successful in a bit more detail.\n\n##### SPEED\n\nIt should be clear that speed is very important to run faster, but many runners don't do anything to get better at it. 'I'm getting ready for a long run', they say. 'I don't need to work on my speed. I run long distances.'\n\nI think that's not right. People who think like that should remember this: There are only two ways to run faster. You either need to move your legs faster or take bigger steps. There's no other way to run faster. If you want to move your legs quicker or run in a more relaxed way, you need to be strong and flexible.\n\nLearning to run quickly will help you run better. Always start fast, even if you are new to running. If you start by running slowly, it's hard to run faster later. Sometimes you might want to make your steps bigger, but not if it means running slower. Running fast can help you speed up when you need to. It's like trying to speed up in a car. You need a lower gear to speed up quickly.\n\nWant to run faster? Think about moving your feet quickly.\n\n'Some runners, especially new ones, think that to run faster, they need to take bigger steps', Jack, who once held a record for running a long way, wrote in a book for runners. 'But for runners who run long distances, that's usually not the right way to run faster. In fact, it can cause you to step too far and get hurt. The real secret to getting better at running long distances is to move your feet faster.'\n\nLook at any top runner, whether on the internet or by watching the NE city or LO city races on TV. Count how many times your right foot touches the ground in a minute. Double that number because you also have a left foot, and you will probably find you're taking many steps each minute, maybe even more. That means you're walking pretty fast, three steps every second.\n\nThis is also true for bike riders. Bike riders are often split into two groups: those who pedal slowly and those who pedal quickly, no matter what gear they're in. A man named Lance changed how people train for bike riding by suggesting they pedal faster. He knows what he's talking about: He won a big bike race seven times and also came in third when he was 37, after not racing for about four years. He didn't do this by pedaling slowly.\n\nAnd walking quickly--many steps a minute--is something all top runners do, from those who run short distances to those who run long ones. The best 5K runners go faster than the best long-distance runners by taking longer steps, which is hard to keep up for a long time, but the best long-distance runners move their feet just as quickly. A video of a big city marathon showed that the top 150 runners all ran with almost the same speed--many steps a minute.\n\nThat might be a little faster than new or not-so-good runners can do. Try to get close. In running, we don't talk about big words. The idea is the same, though. Just change like you would on a bike! Instead of being slow, be quick: fast feet, no matter how far. Move along, and remember this fast beat in all your running. How do you do this? Not by thinking about your legs, but your arms. If you move your arms faster, your legs will have to move faster, too, whether it be in quick runs, long runs, training, or racing.\n\nSure, our chance for pure speed is limited in part by our type of muscles--and to be honest, I would have liked a few more of the fast ones myself. That type is something we're born with, although it can be changed a little by training.\n\nBut besides that part of birth, speed is limited by other things we can change.\n\nStrength is a perfect example. Remember that you can only go faster by moving your feet faster or taking longer steps, what if you could do both at once? That would be a double win and _really_ make you faster. Taking bigger steps while moving your feet faster needs more strength: If you get stronger, you'll run faster. And the opposite is also true: If you practice running faster, you'll get stronger.\n\nHow fast you can run depends on how loose you are. If you are more loose, you don't have to work as hard to move. The same work will make you take bigger steps and move your feet faster.\n\nRunning fast also needs skill. To run with skill means to run without wasting energy. You need to move straight forward and not waste energy by stopping or turning. Running with skill also lets you relax, breathe easily, and use your energy well.\n\nRunning fast also needs stamina. Almost everyone who can keep a steady pace can run really fast for a short time. But they can only keep that fast pace for a short distance. So they have to learn to keep that fast pace for a longer distance. For these runners, long runs will help their endurance, but not their speed. To do well in longer races, they need to practice to build speed.\n\nIn other words, running fast needs other things too--strength, looseness, skill, and stamina. If you work on all of them, you will run faster.\n\nIf your legs are slow, sprinting exercises can help you. Try exercises where you move your feet really fast. While running in place, move your feet as fast as you can, like raindrops hitting the ground, lifting them just a little bit. Keep this game going while you move slow. See how many steps you can take in a space. As soon as your feet leave the ground, put them back. It's like trying to see how quick you can clap but with your feet. At the same time, move your arms, not far, but quick-quick-quick-quick-quick.\n\nDon't check the time. If you're with friends, the winner is the _last_ person to get to the end line. It's very tiring. Then walk back and do it again, two or three times.\n\nSure, it's hard to do these games on your own, but with friends they can be fun, and they are very helpful. They help learn how to move by yourself rather than waiting for the slower messages coming from the brain. When you first try this game, you may find it hard to control your moves. One foot may come up higher than the other, and it will be hard to keep your feet and your arms working together. But keep at it: This game helps with timing and working together as well as quickness.\n\nAnd don't just stick to the quick-feet game. The next step is to try to use that quickness in your normal running. Start by moving your feet very fast, but not going far for the first few steps. Then keep moving your feet fast, let go slowly, and make your steps bigger and bigger. Suddenly, it's like a plane on the runway: The engines are full, you're not moving, and then you let go. With your fast feet, you'll feel a bit of speed. This may not be easy, but practice it often and you'll get better and faster.\n\nIf your steps are too small, you can try lifting your knees high. This is like running in place while lifting your knees as high as you can, keeping your feet moving fast and going forward a little. It's also important not to lean back during this. Try doing this for a few steps, then walk back--do this two or three times.\n\nLike the fast-feet game, the high-knee game is something you might do to get ready before you start playing, or to cool down after playing. And, like the fast-feet game, you can end by turning the high-knee game into actual running, which is why we do these games; you're not just doing them for fun. Practice the jump for a little bit, then--still keeping your knees high--go faster, moving your knees up and forward. You're trying to add the jumps into your normal running and learn to run in a new way by focusing on two simple parts of speed--how fast your legs move and how big your steps are.\n\n##### BEING STRONG\n\nFor some reason, lots of people don't think being strong has anything to do with long-distance running, so they don't try to get stronger. They don't do any running in fields or woods. No push-ups, either. No pull-ups, no sit-ups, no visits to the place where people exercise, and no running to make themselves stronger. Being able to keep going, not being strong, is what matters, right?\n\nMaybe thin runners don't look strong. But they are, especially when you think about how much power they have compared to how much they weigh. It's true that the kind of strength you need changes depending on what you're doing. If you look like big strong men like Adam or Benjamin, you probably won't be very good at a really long race. Being super strong won't help much unless it can be used in the right way for what you're doing.\n\nBut being strong is a very important part of running well. If you want to run fast up a hill, you need to be strong to do it. _Something_ is moving your body all the way from the bottom of the hill to the top. You are important. Being weak will not help. You should become stronger to do better. \n\nThis is also right when you are on flat ground. If you try to take bigger steps, you need to be stronger. Each step has to do more work to go further. To move faster like the best runners, or how you want to at the end of a race, you need to be strong.\n\nOn the other hand, if your legs or belly are weak, your steps will be shorter. This means you'll go less far with the same number of steps. It might surprise you, but your belly muscles help a lot in lifting your knees and taking strong steps. Many regular runners do not know that belly exercises are very important to run better, take longer steps, and become stronger.\n\nBut you should not only care about your legs and belly. As we will learn in chapter 3, you should run with your whole body. Your arms and the upper part of your body are also very important for running well. Your arms help you speed up, and your legs cannot go faster than your arms.\n\nThe strength of your belly connects what your arms and your legs do. Training to become stronger is not an extra thing; it is a very important part of running well. The BR runner Kevin, who won gold in running fast and running really fast at the AT games in a long time ago, used to do a lot of belly exercises in one time.\n\nHenry was inspired in his running by another Brit, Adam, one of the most successful middle distance runners of all time. Adam won four medals in a big sports competition and set 11 world records.\n\nAdam thought runners make a mistake in not doing enough strength training, which he felt was important for doing well. It was only when he discovered how much his tummy muscles helped him, he often said, that he really did better with his running.\n\n##### STRENGTH\n\nStrength is the area where many runners focus their efforts. Strength is the ability to keep running at a certain effort for long periods. If your idea of getting better is to go for longer and longer runs, you are working on strength to some extent. But if those long runs are all quite gentle, you might not be working on strength all that much. And the better you become at the long gentle runs, the more you have to work harder to see improvements.\n\nTo get better at strength, try some steady runs that are short and often. Add in just one or two long runs each week. And, although they have often been called fast running, your strength will be greatly improved by running games, short bursts of running on the road or on the track, and running up and down hills.\n\n##### FLEXIBILITY\n\nDoctors say they can recognise runners by their tight leg muscles. This is not how it should be: Tight leg muscles make each step shorter and each lift of the knee harder. It would be better if doctors knew runners by how bendy they were.\n\nBeing bendy is about being a better overall runner. It's very important to getting faster, stronger, and having more energy. I'll talk about it more in chapter 5. It's also very important to not getting hurt. Don't make the same mistake lots of other runners make by not knowing how important it is. Be more bendy and you'll move more, be more efficient--the ability to go the same speed with less effort--and lessen your chance of getting hurt, which means your training will be more regular.\n\nDon't stretch when you're cold. Run for the first 5 or 10 minutes of your time, then stop and have a good stretch with your muscles warmed up. Be sure to loosen your top body, including your chest, neck, and shoulders, as well as your legs, because you need to be relaxed and loose from head to toe in order to run your best.\n\nAnd remember to stretch _after_ your run as part of your cool-down. That will stop muscles from getting stiff, lessen injuries, and help recovery rate.\n\n##### SKILL\n\nIf being bendy is ignored by too many runners, skill--technique--is ignored by even more. But it is key to running as well as you can.\n\nI have my own thoughts about how to do things, and they have helped lots of runners get better--even more than they thought they could. I will talk more about these important things in the next part. You wouldn't want to learn how to run the wrong way, just like you wouldn't want to learn how to play tennis by holding the racket the wrong way. \n\n##### THINKING\n\nNow we get to something that's hard to understand. But it might be the most important thing. If you have 10 runners who are all just as strong and fast, the one who has the best thoughts will win. The winner could even be someone who's not as strong or fast, but who thinks stronger. I think thinking helped me win a big race in the past. Some things had made me mad. Some things had made me feel like I needed to 'show them'. And I was happy to be over my hurt and able to run without pain. So I was calm and happy. I just started running and never slowed down. My thoughts let my strength show. It was not about trying harder. It was the opposite.\n\nThere are many parts to thinking strong. We're talking about feeling inspired and determined, feeling confident and wanting to do things, and being able to focus and deal with both hard times and good times. All of this can change how good you are at something--for the better or the worse. You can get better and stronger with practice.\n\nEvery time you practice, you are also working on your mind. Every time you finish something tough, you feel more sure of yourself. But if you miss practice or don't finish something, you might start to feel unsure of yourself. This can be very bad, so make sure your goals are hard but also something you can really do. Once you've made your goals, don't let yourself down. Just do what you planned to do.\n\n##### DO TWICE AS MUCH, PRACTICE TWO TIMES A DAY\n\nNow, all of this might seem like a lot to do. How can anyone possibly do it all at once?\n\nThis is why practicing twice a day can help. Don't be scared. I think a lot of people don't understand this. It's not so much about practicing more as it is about practicing more often.\n\nLet's say you like running a lot and you're trying to run 70 miles in one week. Running 10 miles every day is very hard. But compared to that, doing two shorter runs in one day is easier. And it can help you more.\n\nFirst of all, you can keep your body working well all day by running a little bit a lot of times. Next, you will feel nice and ready for your second run, even if you're a bit tired. And also, you will make a routine with many more parts to put different sessions on. This means you can do more different sessions, letting yourself work on more things in any part of your training.\n\nAnd not only that: If you're running two times a day, you can do more easy runs, which make you feel good, help you rest, and put something back in you--a really nice feeling, both in your body and mind. If you're only training one time a day, or maybe just three times a week, it's hard to find time to do those rest runs. They end up being long runs instead, or all your sessions end up being rest runs without having done the tough sessions to rest from.\n\nTraining two times a day opens a lot of options. You might do an easy run in the morning and some hills in the late day--and it won't feel that hard. Often you'll find out you feel better in your second session than you did in your first.\n\nMaybe you raced the day before, or trained very hard, and you're feeling tired. You might limit yourself to just three miles in the morning, then do seven in the late day. That's still 10 miles. And you'll say to yourself, 'Oh, that was _easy_.' The three miles were just a quick run. After that you rest, and by evening you feel like you are ready to go again. This is much easier and better than just doing a long run right away.\n\nI started by talking about someone who's running a lot each week. But people who run far less than that can also get big benefits from running twice a day. Let's say your runs are usually about five miles. Instead of one long run, try two short runs. Suddenly, you, too, will have more ways to train and to include those good short runs, too.\n\nSo it's not just about running more, it's about doing more times. That will add more fun to your training, give you bigger benefits and make you feel happier.\n\nI know some people will not believe this. I've seen it many times. When I was at school, I lived with several other runners. They just did not want to believe me or even try it.\n\n'We're going to do a long one tonight', they'd tell me. 'That's much better than one of your short runs.'\n\nI was a little faster than they were, but younger--the new boy--and they didn't want to listen to me.\n\n'Two times a day--that's a lot', they'd say. 'You'll get too sleepy; you'll get hurt.'\n\nBut it's the other way around. After your first run, your body works harder for a few hours after, so you keep getting the good and training effect as you rest. That means you're less likely to get hurt: You'll actually feel more ready before you start the second run of the day. And you'll probably run two different types of runs, which means you won't do the same thing or take the same step as many times as you would if you did all your running in one long run. And you'll stretch two times in the day, too.\n\nMaybe their real reason for only running once a day was the thought of spending too much time--changing clothes two times, showering two times, and so on. And all the extra cleaning! It's enough to say that the old group had lost to kids from CA school in the yearly running race. But the newer group of runners, who were more open to running two times a day, beat CA school easily the next two years.\n\nI say I have tried running three times a day at different times but honestly I can't really say it's good! It started when I was a kid. I used to run to and from school, and my dad, who was a teacher there, would bring my books and clothes to school in the car. Sometimes, I would run in the middle of the day too, maybe during a game class. So, I was sometimes running three short runs a day. It's not a lot, but I found it a bit hard. And it was too much work. You spend too much time changing clothes. And I don't think it helps more.\n\nBut running two times a day can be really good. Get used to it and you'll feel great!\n\nSure, running two times a day might take some time to get used to. You might have to get up earlier in the morning. But two short runs can fit into your day easier than one long one. And you have to make a routine that lets you do it, maybe by running to school or at lunchtime.\n\nBut when it comes to making your running better, running two times a day is much better than running once. Everyone I talked to who started running twice a day said it was the key to getting a lot better.\n\nSo how do you start?\n\nSome people say to start slowly. If you're used to running six or seven days a week, try running twice a day once a week, they say. See how you feel. Then maybe you can do it twice a week.\n\nI have never thought you get anywhere by doing it that way. I think it's hard when you try to get used to something slowly. It's like running twice in one day. It becomes a big thing to do unless it's a normal thing you do every day.\n\nDoing things often makes it easier. If it's normal to go out twice a day, then it becomes easier to do most days than just once or twice per week. It becomes a normal part of your day. And at the start, you don't need to run more; instead, make the runs shorter and easier to do.\n\nThere are different things that can make things harder, and there are ways to make them easier. You'll want to find ways to make the hard things easier for you. I'll talk about them more in this book.\n\nAnd when you are practicing, remember that you want to get better at many things. You want to be fast, have a lot of energy, be strong, be flexible, have good skills, and have a strong mind--and be able to use all these things when you need to. Don't do the same things over and over. You won't get better that way. Doing different things is fun, and it's also a good way to practice.\n\n##### THINGS TO REMEMBER\n\n- There are six parts of being fit: five Ss--speed, bending, power, lasting, and skill, plus how you think. If you work on all of them all year, adding more skills, you'll get better.\n\n- Always have a goal as you train: to get better at one or more of the six parts of being fit--or, very importantly, to rest. Training without a goal--lots of running, all at the same speed--won't make you better and may even hurt. If the goal is a short, easy run, stick to the plan. Don't let it become longer or harder than you planned, just because you feel good. If you feel good--keep it. Save it! That's the feeling you want. Save it for your next tough session, or next run.\n\n- To do different kinds of training, run twice a day most days. Not necessarily more running--just more times, many of them short. It's the key to getting a lot better at being fit.\n\n#### Chapter 2\n\n#### Aiming True\n\nIt was hot, but Cameron was cool.\n\nThe year before, young runner Cameron had won a race in the BR place and a race in the AT city. He was a new kid--someone to look at.\n\nNow, in a long time ago, getting ready for the first big race, a group of people with cameras were there to look at him. They followed Cameron from the start of the year through the big race--making a movie that was called _Cameron: Good from the Start_. As the race day got closer, the camera group followed Cameron around the place where all the racers lived, watching how he got ready for the big race.\n\nIt's usual for racers in that place to still be practicing a lot even though the race is soon. In the place where all the racers live you know the others are looking at you, even if there is no camera group. Maybe you want them to see you out on the track, running fast and looking strong.\n\nMost racers, me too, would probably want to do their usual practice as much as they can. With so much free time, you feel much better going out for a run, rather than just sitting and worrying. You can read, sleep, play cards and listen to your songs, but doing your usual practice is the best way to keep your day organized, and--importantly--that stops you from just waiting for the next meal, eating too much, and feeling more and more tired.\n\nIt's bad if you start to feel heavy, tired and slow, and you have to find a way to avoid this. Looking back, even though I was good at taking it easy for big races, I maybe ran too much during the warm racing season. This might have made me stronger, but I was too tired in some races.\n\nMy early friend, David, who was the best at the long race for four years, was always running. This probably affected me. Even before a big race, David would be out in the hot sun, wearing his running clothes, running fast and trying to show off to people--usually, he did this really well.\n\nNow that I think about it, David probably didn't have a lot of self-belief, unlike Sam's calm way. Sam was in a far away city, only 22 years old, getting ready for the big races with the added worry of being followed by a camera crew. But he stayed calm and relaxed, watching TV and walking around the place--and not doing a lot of running!\n\nBut when it was time to race, he did really well.\n\nEven though we didn't have Thomas, the best runner, people were saying that the racers in the final were really good. It included Sam's friend from our country, Steve, the current big race winner; the runner Steve from the US, who was the second-fastest runner ever; and the runner from MO country, Said, who would win the big race the following year in LA city.\n\nIn the beginning, the race was slow--it was a careful race, which would be good for Oliver and his quick speed change. Then, with a short distance left, Adam started running fast. Cameron followed him. When the last lap started, Adam kept running faster, especially on the straight path. Cameron stayed with him. And with a small distance left, Cameron ran very fast, took the lead, and showed how much energy he still had. He kept the lead until the end, just beating Samuel for the first place. Adam got third place. Oliver, who had let himself get stuck inside, got fourth place.\n\nCameron--calm, cool, relaxed, and rested--was the world champion. This shows that the goal of your practice should not be to tire yourself out. Sometimes the goal is to rest and feel good. Even when you're practicing hard, you should always aim to be ready and able to run the next day. But when a big race is coming, things change. You should now be practicing not so much for fitness--it's too late for that--but for feelings. You're trying to get to race day not just fresh and rested, but really wanting to race. Instead of being scared of the start, you feel the start of the race sets you free. In the end, you can open that bottle and let the fun, the feeling, and the joy come out. This is what you have been practicing for--the show after all the practice times. And your practice leading up to the big race should be about building up, saving and bottling these feelings.\n\nWhenever you go out, whether a race is coming or not--you should remember what you're trying to do in that session.\n\nJust doing one more medium run is okay at certain times of the year, when maybe your goal is to increase your running distance. But running distance isn't everything, and you need to do more specific sessions if you want to get all the good things from your practice.\n\nThis is where many beginner or intermediate runners make their biggest mistake. Their recovery runs are a bit too hard. Then, because they haven't let themselves rest well, their hard sessions are a bit too easy. Their long runs are a bit too short and maybe a bit too fast, their short runs are a bit too long, and their practice can easily end up all same, all medium, and all boring. Sure, it all counts as running distance, but some of it ends up as useless running: They're doing what they can already do. It's enough to make them tired, but not specific enough to really improve their skills.\n\nThat's not a good way to practice, it's not a good use of time, and it's not going to help much.\n\nRemember your specific goals: One day, you might want to run faster; another day, you might want to run for a longer time or get stronger; and another day, you might want to teach your body to rest quickly. Also, your goal might be to rest with a very short, slow, comfortable run that makes you feel good at the end.\n\nThere may be times in the year when you want to run for a longer time or get stronger or run faster. But you can still do these kinds of running each week and change them according to the training you're in.\n\nLet's talk about each one.\n\n##### REST RUNS\n\nYou might think I will start by talking about a big run on the track or hill runs that make your knees shake. Well, I could, of course. At the right time of the year and with enough rest, these kinds of runs can help you a lot. But I'm going to start by talking about rest runs.\n\nIt's true that the rest runs are most helpful only after you've done the harder runs. But it's also true that you can only do the harder runs properly if you are good about sticking to the goal of your rest runs--to _rest_ , to leave yourself ready to go, feeling a little sad because you know you could have run more. It's the same as being good to yourself and not having that extra pint or second helping of pudding.\n\nOften, people plan to do an easy run on a certain day but end up not doing it. They think, 'Oh, it's a nice day. My friends are going for a long run. I'm only supposed to do a short run, but I can't resist. I'll go slowly, and it will still be a relaxing run.'\n\nBut a long slow run is _not_ a relaxing run! Especially when you planned a short one. Then, they feel more tired the next day. They're not ready for something harder, like running up and down a hill or running really fast.\n\nOK, I'll skip that and do a fast run or a really hard run instead, they think.\n\nWell, that's OK, but it's still not what they planned. And their exercise all becomes less effective.\n\nIf you have some extra time on a relaxing day, it's better to use it for stretching or swimming instead of running more.\n\nA relaxing run doesn't mean running slowly. Many people think, 'I'm supposed to do an easy run today. And these are comfy shoes. I'll just run slowly and feel relaxed.' They move their weight back, almost sitting down, and their legs slow down. Their steps start to feel heavy.\n\nWhen you run to rest, even if you run slow, keep your feet fast. Take small steps-- very small steps-- and stay up on your toes. Try to make your feet move fast and keep your body forward. Also, bend your knees: you want your legs to feel bouncy again.\n\nAt first, you might feel this faster pace is harder than your usual slow steps. It's tough to stay slow in this gear, and you might breathe heavier and your heart might beat faster, so slow down more: Take even smaller steps. But don't slow down by taking slower steps. Running with a slow beat is a bad habit to break, so don't let yourself go back to it. Keep a good, fast beat, even when you run to rest. Running with fast feet will help you a lot because you'll get used to how running should feel. This fast beat will stick with you in all your runs.\n\nOf course, you can also rest with an easy swim or an easy walk, either of which would be good. But, if you're going to run, keep it fast and calm. Stop and stretch a bit. You might mix in a few short sprints. Think of the whole time as a chance to practice your moving and keep that sense of being bouncy on your feet. At the end, you should feel that you can't _wait_ to run again.\n\nSadly, many runners think that feeling means they haven't done any good because they haven't tried hard enough. Usually at the end of their runs they like to pat themselves on how tired they are, thinking it means they've done great work. The more tired you feel at the end of your run, the more you've done for your fitness, right?\n\nWell, no. Which brings me to another of the four key times to include each week--the long run.\n\n##### LONG RUNS\n\nThis is the only one of the four key weekly times that medium runners tend to include in their training. It's the one S they work on--stamina. But even this they do in a way that may hold them back rather than help them get better.\n\nIf you tire yourself down so much on your long run that you can barely go up and down stairs for the next two days, think of all the faster-paced times you're going to miss. And the aim is to learn to run fast, right? You don't want to make your legs tired; you want to become quick-footed and full of energy, with a bounce in your step. Don't try so hard that you hurt yourself and feel too tired or flat in your mind. This isn't helpful.\n\nSay you plan to run for a long time, maybe on a sunny day. Many runners start too fast, like they would for a shorter run. Then--oh no--they can keep going for a long time, but with a lot of hard work. But they are too tired the next day. They can't run up the hill on the next day. They spend most of the week resting, all their runs are slow, and soon all their training is just one big pile of medium. This isn't good.\n\nDuring a long run it's easy to do too much. Try not to do that; it slows you down. Go out for a long time. But go slow. Run your long runs at a speed that lets you talk easily. The goal of the long run is not to be fast, but to spend time on your feet. Talk with your pals. Hear the news. Keep your feet fast but your speed slow. Get thirsty. And don't try to do all your training in that one run. You can't do everything at once.\n\nRemember, the best sign you're doing better is not how fast you train, it's how fast you rest. When you wake up one morning and your legs don't hurt and you can walk up and down stairs easily, that's a big change from when you first started. If you feel like you want to go outside and run again, that's a big change, too. And _that's_ how you get better.\n\nMany kids who like to race may already be doing some of their long runs at a talking pace. They get better when they first start. At first, they feel the first effects of running a lot: They might have lost some weight, their heart works better, and they can run for a longer time. But this getting better quickly stops.\n\nRunners often ask me for help, telling me that they've worked up to doing a really long run every week, maybe even longer, and they're up to racing a lot. But somehow they just can't run any faster.\n\nThere's a reason for this. It's because if you keep doing the same thing, you'll keep getting the same result.\n\nYes, they've increased the distance they're able to run. But are they any stronger? A little, maybe. Are they more bendy? Almost certainly not. Are they better at handling when they're very tired? No. Can they bounce back quickly after being very tired? Maybe, but only a little bit.\n\nOften they've started running a lot, so it's slow, slow, slow all the time. It's slow in practice and in races. They keep thinking that they've really got to go far, so they'd better run slowly, and that usually means moving their legs slowly. They never try the sessions that give the practice effects they really need. They don't even give themselves a chance, because they think it's more important to do more running than to learn to run fast.\n\n##### FUN RUNS\n\nBut there is a very good way to get better at running faster and doing the kinds of practice that will make a big difference--fun runs. And this type of running is something to start in your practice early on, not some kind of special thing to be saved for later, after you have practiced the art of running slowly for a year or two.\n\nFun running is really great: It's fun, good, and makes you feel free! It's the important first step in getting used to running at different speeds. It's running how you feel and learning about what your body can do by trying. How fast dare you go, and for how long? And then let's see how long it takes you to rest before you feel ready for another try. It's not about running certain lengths a certain number of times at a certain speed or heart beat on a nice flat place. You don't need to look at your clock. It's a fun and exciting way to run faster. And it's very good for you.\n\nFartlek, as many runners know, means 'speed play'. That's just what it is, playing around with running fast and slow on different paths, getting used to running much faster than race speed over various distances, and taking breaks as you need them.\n\nThis way of training was made about 75 years ago by a SW country athlete named Gabriel. Gabriel had won a medal in a big sports event in 1912 in front of his home crowd in SE city. Later on, he was named coach of the SW country cross country teams, which needed a lot of help. In the 1920s, they'd been beaten a lot by the great Patrick--the Flying Finn, he was called--and his friends. For the Swedes to be beaten by their neighbours was, of course, not good. Something had to change.\n\nEnter Gabriel.\n\nHe soon realised that the runners he was working with had problems with running fast and running fast for a long time. So in the 1930s, as he took his teams running through the forests of SE country, he came up with the idea of speed play--adding bits of much faster running into some of the normal runs.\n\nThe results were amazing and must have left the Finns wondering what had happened. In a short time, the boys from SW country were better than the boys from FI country in running. The SW boys who did different speed training were the fastest in 2-miles, 5,000 metres, and 10,000 metres. Later, in the middle of the 20th century, a boy from SW country named Gabriel--who loved different speed training--broke 10 records in one summer.\n\nSometimes, the different speed training can be guided, with the hard practices planned and maybe a whistle blown to start and finish each try. But what we're talking about here is just running how you feel--having fun with speed, trying and learning how fast you can go and for how long.\n\nAt first, many runners are careful about doing any kind of fast running. Never having done it, they find it hard. They're not used to it in their body or mind. Maybe, too, they think of it as something to be done only for a month or so before a race, a way of getting better to be tried only after having done a lot of long, slow miles. And fast running--you can get hurt doing that, right? Really, they tell themselves, it's so much easier and safer to just go for an easy run.\n\nWell, of course it's easier to just go for an easy run. And I'm not saying it's bad. People enjoy just going out for a run, which is not a bad thing to do. Running can be fun.\n\nBut if kids want to feel like they're getting better, want the joy of finding out there can be more to running than just playing with friends, they need to try these other types of runs. If you want to run faster, then learning how to do that is a _part_ of the base, not something to be added later. And learning how to make this harder running fun--that, too, is a big part of the art of running.\n\nNot only that. I think changing the speeds at which you run actually makes you _less likely_ to get hurt. Many of the problems that runners have are because they keep doing the same thing over and over. The movement doesn't have to be hard at all--just ask writers and others who type all day long and end up with wraps on their wrists.\n\nIf all of your miles are run at the same speed in the same shoes using the same steps on the same ground, that's going to be a lot of repetitions of the exact same movements with the exact same stresses on your body. Let's say your step is one yard long. That's a lot of steps in a mile, lots of steps in an eight-mile run--and more than a huge number of steps in a 40-mile week. But by running at different speeds, you change your step length and change the movements you're making. There's less doing of the same moves again and again.\n\nSo how do you play this running game?\n\nBegin like you're going for a normal run: Run lightly for about 10 minutes, then stop and stretch. Keep going, and sometimes run really fast. Not as fast as you can--just faster than your normal run. Pick a tree or something else far away and tell yourself you'll run quickly until you get there. When you reach it, slow down to a walk to rest. Then, when you're ready, choose another target and do it again.\n\nDon't make all your runs the same. Change how fast you run, how far you go and where you run. And change how long you rest, too. Keep the fast runs between 20 seconds and 3 minutes, and try to keep walking in between.\n\nRunning quick short runs (up to one minute) with long rests helps you get faster, which may not be your main goal. Doing them almost as fast but with shorter rest times (less than one minute, maybe only 30 seconds) helps your body rest quickly. This can help get rid of the stuff that slows you down and makes your legs hurt. When you keep the rests short, your body gets better and you can run faster for longer. This is about exercising a lot. When you exercise too much, your body can't get enough air. This makes you tired because your body is making something called lactic acid. If you can exercise faster without making too much lactic acid, that is very good for you. This doesn't happen if you only run at the same speed all the time.\n\nIf you exercise for a long time, like 90 seconds to 3 minutes, this can help you run faster. But remember to rest longer after these exercises, maybe even 3 minutes.\n\nSome people might think exercising this much is too much work and no fun. But that's not true. If you do these exercises with your friends, they can be fun. It's easier and more fun to do them with friends than alone. When everyone is exercising together, it helps everyone. You can talk and laugh with your friends when you're resting. You can take turns being the leader, and learn more about your friends and yourself. There's a fun kind of exercise called Fartlek, and it's a good way to find out what you can do. This helps you plan your exercise routine and find out what you're good at and what you need to work on. This also helps you plan how you will race against other runners who are good at different things.\n\nRunning games can be easily made to fit kids of different speeds playing together. Just make sure you all start and stop the games at the same time so you each get the same amount of rest. The faster kids can slow down to join the slower kids after each game. And games like this usually leave you happier and more excited than a long, slow run.\n\nOne way to play a running game with friends is to take turns leading the group. Go out with six or eight friends and run along in a line, 10 to 15 steps apart. The runner at the end has to run faster to pass the line and take the lead and then slow down to a steady pace. Then the next runner speeds up to the front, and so on. It gives you a good feeling to run strongly past the other runners, one after the other. And when you get to the front of the line, you get to slow down and rest. This type of game makes you feel you're part of a team, helping each other instead of racing against each other.\n\nA more exciting way of playing a running game with a small group of kids of similar speed is to again take turns to lead, but without knowing how far the leader will go at that speed. Your job is simply to stay with him. He may be going for 50 steps or 500 steps, you don't know; it may be at a steady speed or an ever-faster speed. When the leader says it's time to rest, it's not him but the next runner who chooses how long the rest will be. Then it's the next runner's turn to lead, as fast and for as long or short as he or she wants. This becomes a fun game--just like playing cards--which is what racing is all about. This isn't just about getting fit, it's also good for getting ready for races and learning strategies.\n\nThere are lots of ways to run. Be imaginative. Run how you want. Yes, you're working on running fast. But don't forget to have fun. And don't forget the skills, too: Maybe sometimes you can try to run faster by moving your legs faster, but not making your strides any longer than when you were running slowly.\n\n##### UP AND DOWN AND FAST SESSIONS\n\nAnother important session to do each week is a repetition session--either going up and down hills or fast reps. These are so good for you that I've written a separate chapter for each later in the book. For now, I just want to say that these sessions can be good fun--especially if you do them with your pals.\n\nAnd you can do them in many different ways, too. There's a place for traditional repeats, of course: doing a certain number of 800s at a certain speed, for example, with a set amount of rest time. And you can do the same thing on the roads, without checking the length, around a circle of streets near your home.\n\nBut playing tag is also a fun way to practice running. They're not as serious as true races, but having other teams playing at the same time can motivate you to run faster, especially if you're a faster runner chasing a slower runner, or a slower runner starting before a faster runner. Each team will have runners of different speeds--maybe, one slow and one very fast. Or there might be at least one old person on each team. Or each team might be made up of both boys and girls. Anything you think will be fun and create a close match.\n\nIf each team has two people, in what's called a tag game, you can take turns running fast and resting. One person will run a certain distance, for example, then the other will run the next distance while the first runner rests. It can go on for as many rounds as you decide so that each runner completes four rounds, or six or eight or whatever you want. Having a fast partner is both a good thing and a bad thing. He or she will help your team get ahead of the others, which is what you want. But having a fast partner also gives you less time to rest between your rounds. When you see Mr. Adam running down the path not long after you passed to him, you might not know whether you should be excited or worried.\n\nIf needed, we can change the game to give the faster runner more ground and less rest. He can jog back and get the stick earlier, so the slower friend has less ground to run.\n\nI often lead warm-weather training camps at CL place, in LA island, one of the CA islands. One year, I was running a two-week camp for athletes. One of my wife's running friends, Jessica, and her husband came down for the second week for some friendly training under the sun. Jessica is the nicest person you'd ever want to meet. But she's not one in whom the competitive spirit burns bright. She's perfectly happy with her usual Sunday running with friends--and why not?\n\nCL place organises various easy races each week. It's the best place to learn about triathlons, duathlons, and so on for free. This particular time, there was a duathlon on--run, bike, run--and I wasn't able to run at the moment.\n\n'Well, look, Jessica', I said. 'We'll do a duathlon together as a team. You run the first run, I'll bike, and you run the second run.'\n\n'Oh, no, no', she said. 'I don't know, Adam. I'm not good at these games. 'I feel too scared.'\n\nBut I kept going. Because that's what a friend does. The way she remembers, I told her these games were easy, and there would surely be kids playing and old people, too.\n\nWhen she got there, though, there were no kids. No old people, either. Just people who looked to her a lot like strong people.\n\nBut by now she was ready. For once, she was really doing a game, so there was a little bit of worry on her first try. It was short--just a small distance--and that gave her the idea she could do it quickly. And off she went.\n\n'Just a bit from the start, my heart was beating fast, and I was--\"Oh, my goodness!\"' she remembered lately.\n\nShe kept going, though, and finished. In last place--but without stopping. Totally fine! No one was hoping for anything else. But she did it!\n\nAnd that was great for me. I like a game, so I hopped on the bike, pedalled hard, and when I finished, we were ahead again.\n\n'I was still breathing hard when you sped into the game area', Jessica remembered. '\"I'll get that Jack,\" I said to myself. You looked like you weren't even tired.'\n\nSo--sooner than she liked--it was Jessica's turn to run again. But this time it was not the same. She was ahead! This was good!\n\n'She felt very happy', she said. 'Hey, I'm in the _front_!'\n\nIt was something new to her. She was leading! Other runners were trying to reach her! And she tried her best. We asked her to try _beyond_ her comfort zone, and it was great.\n\nShe admits there were times during the race when she was upset with me. But in the end, she was glad to have done it and felt very proud.\n\nWho won or lost in the end is not important. These aren't real races. But they're a good way to pretend situations you'll face in real races--situations that, it would seem easy, you need to practice. You can't hope to handle them well in a race if you've never done them before. Activities like these give you a chance to get faster, try different speeds, and find out what you can do.\n\nBeing brave all the time isn't the goal 100 percent of the time: When you're running again and again, the goal can be to do exactly the same time 8 or 10 times in a row. But in a game, you can feel free to run as fast as possible. You might find when you get to the big stick you've picked that you've run faster than you thought you could or that you recover more quickly than you would have done a few weeks earlier. You'll feel ready to play again faster than you thought. You can't find out what you can do without trying your best. Also, you need to run at different speeds to get better.\n\nIn races, there's no time to be slow. If your friends are ahead when your turn comes, you need to run as fast as you can to catch up. Run as fast as you can and hope you can keep doing it. Again, you might find out you can do much more than you thought.\n\nWhat you find out helps in normal races, when everyone starts at the same time. If you've learned that you can now run, for example, six minutes even when you're tired, that makes you feel brave to start faster or to push yourself in a race before the finish line is near. The friends around you may not try hard, not because they can't push that hard for that long, but because they don't know they can do it. They're too careful to try.\n\n##### FUN WEEKLY PLAY SCHEDULES\n\nA fun weekly play schedule should have different kinds of games like these four sessions--a game, some repeats, a long run, and one or more rest times. Examples of these kinds of weekly play schedules can be seen at the back of the book. But there's another question: How do you mix your exercise with the rest of your day?\n\nThe answer is different for everyone. For most, running is just for fun. It's not the most important thing in their day, and it shouldn't be. But if they want to get better, running can't be the last thing they do, something they only do after everything else is finished.\n\nA lot of exercise is about doing it every day. To mix your exercise with other parts of your day, the exercise needs to be a regular part of your day--something you don't question every day: Should I or shouldn't I? Exercise needs to be a habit.\n\nThere are many ways to fit exercise in. If important people like Adam and Alice can find time to stay fit, others of us can find ways to do it, too. Some people run to school or get in a short run before school. Others get in a run at lunchtime. Going outside and away from the desk for a while makes you more awake and productive. It's just a regular thing.\n\nIt's normal to get tired from the shopping, the playing in the garden, the housework, your job, and taking care of the kids. But don't let everyday tiredness stop all your exercise. Maybe you get home when it's almost bedtime, and you can't face anything more than a half hour or so. Good! Make that your playtime run. And feel happy about it. You will definitely feel better for having played a running game, rather than sitting in front of the TV.\n\nThat's where, once again, playing twice a day helps. You can do short games. You don't need to tell your family you're going to play a running game and that's the last they'll see of you for a long time. You can be back in a short time. You can play more games, learn more things, and do more good without going out for so many long runs. The shorter runs will fit better into the free times in your day. And when you find the times where playing does fit in, be sure to make it a regular habit. Routine is very important.\n\nAnd remember to leave yourself feeling nicely tired. You want to be ready to play the next day, yes. But more than that, you've got to look forward to playing the next day. I said earlier that you should always have a goal as you play. Well, the main goal, no matter what level of runner you are, is to enjoy it. Don't go so far or so fast that you wear yourself out.\n\nAnd don't try to distract yourself by hiding behind your earphones: Why ignore the real world? Be aware of your body and your feelings. No matter where you are, you can find something to enjoy. Listen to the birds singing, feel the wind, taste the salt of the sea, and smell the sweet flowers. When you're running, you can sense more things. Let running be a fun experience. And don't worry too much about complicated running tools.\n\nYou're not running in the same place. The goal is to have fun, to enjoy, and to _feel good_. You should have fun and share happy moments. And then, I think, running will be easier.\n\n##### THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND\n\n- Mix your weekly runs with four important parts: a long run, a fast-slow run, a repeat run, and at least one easy run. Add more normal runs if you want.\n\n- The goal of an easy run is to feel better at the end than you did at the start. Run slow but move your feet fast, and keep these runs short.\n\n- Run your long runs at a speed that lets you talk. It's not about how fast you run, it's about how long you run.\n\n- Fast-slow running is the first step in getting used to running fast. This is not hard but very good for you.\n\n- Running in practice is different to running in games. In games, you will probably want to keep the same speed. But in practice, run fast and slow. Use some practice times to try your best and see what you can do. If you don't try, you'll never know.\n\n- Make practice a part of your day, a normal thing to do.\n\n#### Part 3\n\n#### Running Well\n\nWith a short distance left and the win close, Sam pulled next to the man in front, the FR country runner Nathan. It was the final of the big race happening in NE city's Central Park, Nathan's home. From behind came Oliver, the best runner. The crowd was loud. Everything was ready for a close end.\n\nBut as the leaders turned the last corner, Sam ran faster and got ahead. Feet moving fast, arms swinging, he ran straight very fast, faster than the others, winning the big race and making his name known to all.\n\nIf you want to understand how you can do your best, it helps to have a picture in your mind. A picture of Sam would be a good one to have. Go online and watch some of his races. He was one of the best people ever to run fast. Everyone liked watching him. He moved very nicely. All parts of his body moved together. He didn't fall over because his balance was good. He ran so fast and so far that he got to the front quickly. He looked so strong that it scared the other runners and made room for him.\n\nFor a new example, watch how the good runners from ET country, Adam and Benjamin (who won three big races), run. Look at how they move and balance before you worry about how you move your arms or step your feet.\n\nWhen Oliver showed up, I wanted to be like him. I wanted to run taller and with longer steps, with that rhythm and strength. Later, when we had the same teacher, Harry, Steve and I sometimes trained together. Watching Oliver on TV was one thing. But running beside him was even more exciting. He ran so well, relaxed, and strong that I thought, 'Wow, _that's_ how to run! Thank goodness he's not doing the long runs!\n\nIf you want to run your best and use all the effort you put in, you should think about a good runner.\n\nOf course, runners are all different and have different good and bad things, so everyone will have a special way of running. But that's not the same as saying everyone will find the best way to run by themselves. Is that how people learn to swim--by being thrown in the water to find their own way? Every swimmer is a bit different, but all swimmers know that timing, balance, relaxing, and working together are important, and almost always, swimmers are taught how to swim. How many runners are taught how to run?\n\nThe thing is, nobody is ever taught to run. People think that running a long way doesn't need much skill. Running fast takes some skill. Jumping and throwing--even more so. But running a long way? You just put one foot in front of the other, and what's so hard about that? Besides, changing someone's way of running, people think, would be wrong. Look at Ethan, the runner. He looked so funny, but he won the gold prize in the long runs and the marathon in a big sports event in the 20th century. Clearly, running is just how you naturally do it.\n\nIt's easy to blame coaches for certain misunderstandings. They might focus too much on how far and fast you go. But runners should also take some responsibility. When I was a top runner, I felt a bit upset if someone--even my dad--said I was a slow runner who couldn't run fast because of the way I was born. (Being a teacher, he admitted that was partly his mistake--and said sorry for not giving me his fast running skills!) Or if someone said I could only run well in the mud, as a TV sports commentator called David implied in a quick chat in a hotel elevator in NE city long ago, just after I'd won a big muddy race.\n\n'What are you doing here, Gabriel?' he asked, talking about the big race happening in NE city the next day. 'The only chance you've got is if they make the track like a field!'\n\nWell, they didn't, and I finished a nice fifth in a short time, beating lots of runners who people thought were better, including a guy named David who would break the world record for the race less than a year later. But David was right in that the race showed I couldn't sprint fast at the end--and how hard it is to win without being able to do that.\n\nLooking back, I should have listened more to some of the advices, at least those who wanted to help me run better. But the problem was that none of those people really knew how to make me run faster. They could see that I was slow, but all they could suggest was more practice not better way.\n\nThis is still true for most runners, even today. Go to any local club, watch the members run together, and you'll see lots of proof that no one has ever taught these hardworking runners how to run well. Even among the club's best runners, you may see people with heavy legs and a slow pace. Many hardly lift their knees and land on their heels with the front foot too far in front of their bodies, like they are slowing down with every step. Many have stiff postures and bad balance, maybe holding their heads to one side or running with one shoulder higher than the other. To feel less stiff, some swing their arms or shake their hands--or even do different things with each arm. Some swing their arms across their bodies, twisting themselves until they really start moving a lot. The harder they work the less balanced they look.\n\nIn simple words, runners who are practicing hard to run as fast as possible often end up doing lots of things that actually make them slower. They think that working hard is everything and that all they need to do is to train more and run more.\n\nRunning right is not so much about looking nice as feeling nice, though it's hard to run right without looking nice too. And there are good reasons to learn how to do it. First, if you run right, you'll be less likely to get hurt. That means your training will be more regular--and that might be the single most important thing in getting better.\n\nSecond, the ability to keep good form will let you go faster or keep up the same speed for longer. Being efficient is very important to running. You need to avoid working against yourself. In running, people often talk about the need for a good stride, meaning for example not lifting your knees high. I disagree. A good stride means a quick pace, moving along in a fairly slow way, like pedaling quickly while using a slow gear on a bike. Running well does not mean moving along at a fast walk.\n\nRunning is a simple thing to do, even though running fast takes a lot of skill. Let's try and keep it simple.\n\nI have thoughts on how to run right. As a coach, I've seen them help runners of all kinds get much better. Many of these thoughts I have not heard talked about by any other coach or read in any other book. Sadly, they didn't help me with my own running. I wish they did, but I learned them mostly after I stopped running.\n\nAs I got older, I knew my time as a top runner was ending. I've always liked to win, and I started to think about what else I could do--something I could get better at instead of just watching myself get worse at running.\n\nA long time ago, we started going to CL island for warm-weather practice. It's not a very good place for running--Adam looked at the tough and rocky ground and left right away. But it has great biking and swimming places, as well as a big track, and lots of people who do three sports like it there. Even though I can't swim, I tried doing three sports and slowly started to like it.\n\nAnd that, funnily enough, is what made me think about how to run right--listening to swimming teachers. They talked about when to move, balance, and moving together. These may seem like easy things, but they were never important for long-distance runners.\n\nSwimming, for example, isn't just about your arms. You use your whole body, not only for strength but also for balance, timing, and to swim faster by keeping your body straight. If you're swimming the right way, you're using the strength of your back.\n\nFunny enough, it's a lot like running.\n\nWhen you swim, your back is very important. A tight back can make your legs move less, make your steps smaller and hurt you if you try to run quickly. It can also change how your feet touch the ground, which can make your leg muscles tight. And that can hurt your ankles, knees, and hips. It can also make the back problem worse.\n\nBefore we talk about the different parts of your body, let's think of it all together. First, think about how you feel, not how you look.\n\nRunning tall helps you breathe. Your chest has more space to get bigger. You can breathe in more air than if you're bent over with your chest squeezed. Running tall also lets you take longer steps. You can't take big steps if you're tight and kind of sitting as you run. All other things being the same, if each step is bigger, you'll get to the finish line faster. No matter how tall you are, imagine you are running as tall and relaxed as possible. Lots of small men run quickly with long, relaxed steps. Adam, a very small but very fast man, is a good example. He's only a little bit taller than most people, but he runs with the long and relaxed steps of a much taller man.\n\nStaying calm helps us keep energy. We all have a limited amount of energy. You don't want to waste it by making parts of your body tight when they should be relaxed. This is like trying to ride a bike with the brakes on.\n\nReading this, some people might think I'm repeating a popular way of running. This way has become popular, especially in a big country and among people who like to swim, bike, and run.\n\nBut that's not true. I came up with these ideas about running before this popular way was known. I think this way gets a lot of things right. For example, it's the only other way that says what I've been saying about moving into the next step and not landing on your heels. But in my view, this way makes running sound too hard. It says that runners should do hard exercises, some of them with a coach controlling your leg movement with stretchy ropes. It says that it can take years to learn the right way. I think that's a way to make money. The right way doesn't have to be so hard; learning it doesn't have to be so strict. In some ways, you still need to run how you feel, in a free way. And somehow many runners from a big continent have learned to run well without using stretchy ropes. I like to keep things simple, too.\n\nNow that we've seen the big picture simply, let's look at the different parts of running well.\n\n##### KEEPING YOUR HEAD\n\nYour head is heavy--about as heavy as a big bowling ball. That's a lot of your body weight. If you're small, like Gabriel who weighs as much as a big dog, it's a big part of your total weight. If you're larger--I'm taller than a door--it's a bit less. In any case, what you do with something that heavy, where you carry it and how you hold it, really changes your running.\n\nIf you run looking at the sky, letting your head hang back, that's like stepping on the brakes. It really slows you down. It also makes your throat smaller, making it harder for you to breathe. So don't do it.\n\nAnd if you let your head swing from side to side, that makes you wobbly and uses up your energy. Don't do that, either.\n\nBut don't look too far down or let your head lean too far forward. If you do, your backside will stick out, you won't be running tall, and it will be hard to lift your knees because you're leaning too much.\n\n##### GIVING YOURSELF A HAND\n\nA while ago in my work, I was with a group of young runners from the UK, practicing in the warm weather in the SP country. Cameron, one of the trainers, said I needed to change how I ran.\n\n'Did anyone teach you to run?' he asked. 'Come to the track and we'll practice. I can help you'.\n\nHonestly, I was a bit upset that he was saying my natural way of running was wrong. Especially because he wasn't even my trainer. I knew I was good, and I'd been doing really well since I was a bit older than a toddler. But I thought, OK, I'll try it.\n\nHe was the first person--maybe the only person--who tried to make me run differently and stronger by using my arms better. We were talking before we started training, and he said, 'You need to think more about how you use your arms. Don't just swing them or, worse, flap them. You want to feel like you're _pulling_ , first with one arm, then with the other. Remember, your arms help your legs. It's your arms that help you keep your steps long and your energy'.\n\nBefore this, I thought all I had to do with my arms was to keep them loose and balanced.\n\n'I've really never felt like I'm pulling with my arms,' I said, unsure. 'But I guess I understand what you mean'.\n\nI did my best, but this new way of running didn't feel right. 'Oh, no', I thought, 'this is difficult.' What Charlie didn't tell me--although I wish he had--was, 'Of course it's difficult, because it is different from what you know and because your arm strength is not strong! Keep trying, because it's going to help'.\n\nWe only practiced once together, and Charlie was only talking about using my arms to keep walking. Even he didn't talk much about the most important use of your arms--to keep a fast leg speed.\n\nBut, I'm thankful to him, because he was the first person to tell me how to use my arms, and what it should feel like. I started to think of an idea, one that would become clearer when I started to learn how to swim, bike and run.\n\nAs you would guess, my swimming teacher, Robin--a former champion in the swimming race--talked a lot about how to swim the right way. As I listened, it surprised me: He could be talking about running. He told me where most of the power of the swim comes from. It's not in front of you or even underneath; it's behind you. A swimmer should push his hands right back along his legs before lifting them out of the water. This push part of the swim is just like the long pull part with your arms when you're running that helps you to push off the back foot. Keep it simple, don't do it too slow or too fast, and you can run better. You have to do it right and at the right time.\n\nBefore we talk about what you feel when you run, let's talk about the things you don't want to do.\n\nYou can let your arms hang loose. This is good for making your shoulders feel good but not so good for running. You might do this to feel better between runs. But don't do it if you want to run fast and strong.\n\nSome people move their arms a lot, bending them at the elbows to make a waving or banging action. This uses a lot of energy but doesn't help you run faster.\n\nOther people don't do that, they keep their arms nicely bent at the elbows, but do something else wrong: They stick their elbows out and bring their arms almost sideways across their bodies. This makes it hard for them to breathe. Even worse, the more they do this, the more they fall over. This makes their bodies twist and can hurt them. Not only is this not helpful, but people who do this can get hurt.\n\nMany runners don't think much about what they do with their arms or how fast they move them. Your arms will move as fast as they need to to keep up with your feet, right? Actually, it works differently.\n\nAnd because they're so important, you'll likely benefit from making your upper-body stronger.\n\nBut moving your arms fast is not everything. In nearly all sports, the key to doing well is your timing. In swimming, it's important to grab the water and pull your arms back fast--but not _too_ fast. If you move your arms too quickly, they'll miss the water.\n\nIt's the same in running: You want your arms to move fast, with that feeling of pulling, but timing is very important if you want the pull to work. You want to move your arms quickly enough to keep going but not so fast that you get ahead of your steps. If you do that, you'll pull your arm all the way back before your back foot has pushed off the ground. Your arm will be behind you and you'll be ready to switch to the next leg before you've pushed off the ground fully with your back foot. And you'll lose the important link between the pull of your arm and the push off your back foot. It's your belly and core strength that connect what you do with your arms and the power and push coming from your legs.\n\nHow can your arms help rather than stop you? When you run, hold your hands loosely. Keep your shoulders relaxed and your arms loose but not too loose, elbows bent at an angle smaller than ninety degrees. Move your arms back and forth with your shoulders, not across your body. Don't move your elbows or wrists much. You should feel like you're pulling, one arm at a time--not just backwards, but _downwards_ and backwards. Remember, you're pulling from the shoulder, not the elbow. It's like you're trying to elbow someone behind you, not someone beside you.\n\nThis might be hard to feel at first. I recall a time when I was at a place, and I was trying to get better from a hurt. When I was getting better, one thing I did was skipping on the grass, like the skip part of a jumping game--skip and skip and skip. And I felt the link between the arms and the strong push you can make with your back foot. 'This is better, and less dangerous, than jumping', I thought.\n\nTry it. Skip. Long and loose and big. If you're not pulling, you'll shake: You can't skip with both arms in front of you. And the pulling of your arm behind you helps you lift. Try to feel and make stronger the link between the arm pull all the way back and the push off the back foot.\n\nThat link is just what you're looking for when you're running but with much quicker legs of course. You'll feel it, and can try it, not just by doing jump-rope games, but by running fast up stairs and up hills.\n\n##### LEGS AND FEET\n\nWhat we do with our legs changes the way we run. But nobody shows us how to move them. So let's talk about it now.\n\nWhen you run, move forward with your knees, not your heels. If your body is behind your foot as it touches the ground--if you're moving forward with your heel--each step slows you down. That's not what you want. Instead, bend your knees and lift and move with them. And make sure your body is above your foot as it touches the ground, not behind it. Running is like riding a bike, and your legs should move in a circle. It is _not_ just a fast walk, where your legs are straight and you step on your heels.\n\nWhat you do with your feet is also important, though nobody talks about that, either. Your feet should work just like they do when you're running in the same spot. There's no need to land on your heels. Try running in the same spot and landing on your heels--it's very hard! It's much more comfy to land correctly, on the front of your feet. Your feet should have a quick double action, working as cushions as you land and as springs as you push off, in a quick bounce.\n\nThis means stepping on the front part of your foot first and allowing the rest of your foot to lightly touch the ground, then hopping off your toes again. All this happens very quickly.\n\nI can hear some readers saying, 'Hold on. Some of us naturally step on our heels first. Also, running on your toes is for short runs. Anyone who runs longer races will step on his heels. That's why running shoes are made the way they are. They're made to take in the shock of stepping on your heels. The guys in the shoe store even told me to step on my heels!'\n\nThere's no doubt: A lot of the common ideas today, often promoted by running shoe companies and agreed by foot doctors, is that you should touch the ground with your heel, then roll onto the front of your foot. But are running shoes made like that because of how everyone runs? Or does everyone run that way because of how the shoes are made? I think it's mostly the second one. Some running shoes have such big heels that you can't avoid stepping heel-first. I can see why some of the best runners--like 'Zachary', the SA athlete who set two world records at short races--prefer to run without shoes instead of wearing those big old shoes. And there have been several studies recently that support this view and even say that running shoes are a big cause of injuries.\n\nI don't agree when people say that everyone runs by hitting their heels on the ground first. When you run faster, you might be on your toes more. But it's possible to run far without your heels hitting the ground hard. If you can jog in one place without your heels touching, why can't you do the same while moving forward? What about when you run up a hill? Do you still believe you naturally hit your heel first?\n\nThink about the amazing runner from ET country, Adam. He won a big race without shoes in 1960, running over the roads of RO city. Part of the race went over the bumpy roads of a famous old road. There's no way he ran all that distance landing on his bare heels. That would have hurt too much.\n\nI get why people say, 'Hey, that's just how I run.' When I was a runner at school for a few years, I noticed that my shoes were wearing out on the outside of the heels. I must have been running in a way that made me sit a bit, moving my legs slowly and reaching forward with my heels to land on them. But I could still run pretty well--and when you win races you think that's just how you run.\n\nThe problem was that I kept getting hurt. I had problems with my heel cord, my calf muscles were very tight, and my back was getting hit so hard that I ended up with a crooked hip. I thought a lot about how I was running compared to Oliver, and I decided to change my style. I also chose to race--not only on the path but also in the park--in shoes that stopped me running on my heels, because there weren't any heels. And after some time, I found I used my feet better, and ran much quicker.\n\nThere are a few ways to practice stepping on your feet properly and feeling the bounce. One way is to run uphill. That same day at the big field, when I was jumping on the grass, I ran up and down the steps in the big seats. I found I was bouncing more and feeling more sure about my landing. In the same way, if you run uphill, you're going to step on your toes and feel that bounce.\n\nOr you can try running on the same spot. You won't be stepping on your heels that way, either. And remember as you run the roads--don't hit your feet down and don't hurt your feet as you land. But don't worry too much. Don't keep thinking, 'Am I stepping right?' Just listen to your feet. If your feet are quiet, you'll be doing well.\n\n##### STAYING STEADY\n\nNow that we've looked at the way to move from head to toe, let's put the different parts back together into a whole. In the end, all the actions we've been talking about need to work together to have a style that's strong, calm--and steady.\n\nRunning straight is important to be a good runner. You don't want to move left or right and use up energy fixing your run with every step. Your energy should go to pushing yourself forward. Would you shake your head or wave your arms if you were racing on a bike? Being balanced is just as important when you're running.\n\nThink about how you want to run. Who are the best long distance runners today? People from AF country, for sure. Consider Gabriel, perhaps the greatest long distance runner ever. Once upon a time, he ran a very long distance in BE city, setting many records in his amazing career.\n\nAnd who broke that record? Patrick, a runner from KE country, who ran a long distance in BE city.\n\nAt a big sports event in BE city, Taylor, another runner from AF country, became the first girl ever to win two top prizes. Kevin, another runner from AF country, won two top prizes too, after he had won many times at the World Cross Country Championships.\n\nAlso in BE city, Samuel, a young runner from KE country, ran a very long distance to win, even though everyone thought it would be too hot and smoggy to run fast.\n\nAfrican running achievements are really impressive. If you watch a big running race, you'll often see many African runners at the front. They're usually more runners from Africa than from anywhere else. \n\nWhat do all these runners have in common? A lot of things, like a lot of talent. But one special thing is that they can run very fast and still keep very steady. They don't wobble at all.\n\nA lot of them come from places where being steady is just normal. In these places, people carry heavy pots on their heads for long trips as if it's no big deal. Try putting a pillow on your head and walking across the room. You might find you move a lot from side to side or back and forth.\n\nWhen African people do it, it looks easy. But it needs a lot of skill and control over all the muscles in the body. These runners know what their whole body is doing, from their feet to their heads.\n\nWalking with something on your head needs balance and good posture, even if you're walking slowly. If you could run as smoothly as that, you'd feel a lot more relaxed and save energy.\n\nAs a coach, I've never made my runners walk around with things on their heads. You don't need to do a lot to understand: It's good to show people they don't move as nicely as they think.\n\nThere are some games you can play to make your balance better. One is to stand first on one leg for a little while and then the other. Not so hard? Try it with your eyes closed, for a little while on each leg. You might find that hard at first. But with practice, your balance and feeling of your whole body will get a lot better, even with your eyes closed.\n\nAnother idea is to get a wobbly board. Your job is to stand on it and control the wobble without letting the sides touch the ground. Quite easy with two feet, a lot harder on just one foot. When you master that, stand on the board and throw a ball against the wall, catching it on the bounce while still keeping your balance. Make it as hard for yourself as you like.\n\nBalance is mostly about being aware of your whole body. Watch yourself as you run. Is your head leaning forward or wobbling side to side? Are you holding one of your shoulders higher than the other? Are your arms coming across your body or working unevenly? All of these are not good. Or are you running tall, with arms pulling and your middle part over your front foot as you land? Are your feet moving quickly and quietly? If so, good. This will help you run faster and further, no matter how fit you are.\n\n##### READY TO ROLL\n\nKeep in mind, if you want to feel tall, relaxed, and balanced when you run, it's also important to let yourself move forward with every step.\n\nJust like all bike riders know, the goal is to keep touch with the pedals through each turn. They want to have the same touch with the chain ring, pushing all the way around the circle at a side angle instead of just pushing down with one leg and then the other. Bike riders sometimes think they're really good at it--but then they try to ride smoothly with only one foot clipped into the pedal. It's very hard. When they do it with two legs, they don't notice how bad they are. But doing it with one leg, they realize there is a pause. And they practice making that smaller.\n\nWhen you're running, don't let your leg swing all the way forward until your heel hits the ground. That's what makes a stopping effect. Instead, bend your knee, almost fall forward, and put your next foot down quickly, not too far ahead of you. Other than the quick moment as you land, you want to keep your center of balance forward of the foot you're landing on, not behind it.\n\nYou can't do this by bending at the waist. If you bend too much forward and your behind sticks out, you won't be balanced. Your foot will land on its back part and this will slow you down. \n\nAlso, if you run straight and bend your knees, that's not good. Your foot will land flat, not bouncy, and you won't be balanced. You will still slow down, and you'll use most of your energy to move up instead of moving forward.\n\nWhen I teach runners, I ride my bike next to them. Sometimes when I see someone having a hard time running smoothly, I gently touch the bottom of his back. It's not really a push, just a touch enough to make him lose balance a bit. Suddenly, he gets how he should run, with his hips forward and feeling like he is about to fall that makes his feet move faster just to make sure he doesn't really fall. That, along with moving your legs like a cyclist, makes the important rolling effect. Once you've got that speed, don't fight it, just keep it. It's like running downhill--even on a flat ground!\n\nHere you go: the basics of good running. Some kids might think running well is an extra--something they'll work on if they have extra playtime next month or the month after that. They might think it's something only the very best runners need to worry about. Not so. You can--and should--try to run well every time you play, not just when you're practicing or doing special running games.\n\nChanging how you run will feel strange at first, but stick with it. It will feel normal and easy after awhile. If you're not sure what you're doing wrong--and most of us aren't--run on a treadmill in front of a mirror. Or, better still, get a friend to record you while you're running. You could be surprised, but unless you spot a mistake, how can you fix it?\n\nAnd always remember these key points: Run tall, relaxed, and balanced, falling into the next step. Head straight and still, pulling with your arms and reaching forward with your knees so your legs move like those of a cyclist. And keeping your feet quick and quiet. As I said, It's simple--and a simple list to remember while you're running. It's not all about complicated games and special practices.\n\nGood running can help kids run faster than they ever thought possible and pass friends who have beaten them in the past. To some extent, that's what we're all looking for when we enter races. Playing is part of the fun of running. The faster you run, the more fun you have.\n\n##### THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND\n\n- How you run matters a lot: It's not about looking nice, it's about running fast. The goal is to move in a good way, using your energy well. Good way of running helps you do your best no matter how fit you are. Try to improve it every time you run.\n\n- Run in a smart way--not with big, slow steps, but with small, fast steps. Lift your knees forward so your legs move almost like you are riding a bike.\n\n- You should feel like you're leaning forward and you need to move your legs quickly to stop you from falling.\n\n- Fast hands mean fast feet. Your hands, not your legs, help you run faster and control your pace.\n\n- When you run, you want to feel tall, relaxed, and not leaning to any side. Keep your shoulders relaxed.\n\n- Keep your head straight and still. Your eyes should look straight and a bit down, watching the ground a few steps ahead of you.\n\n- Your hands should feel like they're moving back one after another.\n\n- Your feet should move quickly and land softly, as when running in place.\n\n#### Part 4\n\n#### Getting Ready for Winning\n\nIn the late 20th century, Gabriel, the Fast Biker, decided he would try to break the one-hour bike ride record--one of the big wins in the sport. A very long bike ride of 51.151 kilometres had been completed nine years before by an IT country man named Francesco. But a man named Oliver thought he could go even further.\n\nOliver booked a big bike track in HA town, and gathered people who could officially say if he beat the record. On a sunny day, he was ready to try. He usually rode his bike, Old Faithful, that he made himself. But at the last moment, he was asked to ride a bike that was just like Old Faithful, but with different gears.\n\nAfter an hour of riding really hard, Oliver didn't make it. He'd ridden 50.690 kilometres, not beating the record by 461 metres.\n\nBut he still thought he could go further. And he felt his mistake was using the different bike. But he only had the bike track for one day. The people who could make it official were getting ready to leave. And he felt he might not get another chance.\n\nSo he said he would try again the very next day.\n\nWhen the next morning came, the bike track was nearly empty. Many of the writers had packed up their pens and left, sure he would not make it.\n\nJust 18 hours after his first try, his legs still hurting, Oliver got on Old Faithful, with the gears he had originally thought were best. He stayed ahead of Francesco's speed the whole time. The tiredness many thought would come in the last 15 minutes never happened. He was strong. By the end of a long time, he had gone a very long way--a new big record!\n\nHe had gone a longer way than the day before. The only change had been the tools he used. What a big change!\n\nThis might sound strange, but this is also true for running. Even though it doesn't seem to make sense, runners can get better by finding their best rhythm and step size--in simple words, by using the right tools.\n\nAs I talked about in a previous part, one way of running gets some things right: moving into the next step and not landing on the back of your feet. But it misses out on a few big things. It doesn't talk about tools, which are very important if you want to run your best and win against others. And it doesn't think the work your arms do is important: Your arms are the key to setting your rhythm and timing.\n\nLet's think about this for a bit. Do you think Liam could win big car races if his car had only one tool? Could Larry have made his way over big hills to seven big race victories riding a smooth, new, single-tool bike?\n\nNobody talks about it and nobody teaches it, but tools are very important in running, too. You can't use the same tool for running up a hill as you would running on flat ground. And tools are a lot simpler than you might think.\n\n'What would you do if you were riding a bike uphill and it felt hard?' I sometimes ask my little athletes.\n\n'Stand up' is a common response. But, it's not really possible to keep standing and pedaling until the top. At some point, you would have to slow down a bit.\n\n'So what can you do when you're running up a hill?' I ask.\n\n'Well, you can't slow down!' they say. 'You don't have any speeds!'\n\n'Yes, you can', I tell them. 'Just take smaller steps. But always try to _keep the same pace_.'\n\nYou wouldn't want to run up a hill taking really big steps. It's too hard, and you'd feel like you need to slow down, just like when you're biking or driving.\n\nBut if your steps are too tiny, it will feel like a lot of work and you're not really moving. The right speed is somewhere in between.\n\nYet, the most comfortable speed might not be the quickest. The right speed can make a big change, as we saw with Adam. Liam also pedaled faster than other top bikers--and found he could go quicker and not tire his legs.\n\nAnd I discovered the same in running. Training with David in the old times, I was always aware of his big steps--the big gear--that he could keep going in tough fields and around the track. But he couldn't speed up: He found it hard to make his steps quicker after using this big gear for so long. In driving terms, it would feel like trying to pass a car at a slow speed in top gear--slow.\n\nTwo other runners at the time, David and Tony, ran very differently, with much faster steps. It looked like they were just moving along, and yet they were covering the ground much quicker than it looked. Faster steps can mean you'll breathe a little harder--just as a car running at a higher speed might use more fuel--but a lower gear will still keep your legs from getting too tired and give you a quick change of pace.\n\nSo not only do you need different gears--a different balance between step size and speed--for uphills and downhills, but also the right balance will be different for each runner.\n\nSo how do you change gears? Many runners, when they try to go faster or climb a hill more strongly, have no picture in their heads as to how to do that. They think they just need to push and keep doing the same thing they were already doing, only with more effort. Doing the same thing won't finish the task. \n\nThink about doing things in a new way. Not just harder, but with better skill and timing. Making your arms move a bit faster can help.\n\nThink of it like a bike. When you go uphill, you change to a lower gear. Each time you push the pedals, you don't go as far, but you keep pedaling at the same speed.\n\nTo change to a lower gear when you run, think about your arms not legs. Moving your arms faster will make your legs move quicker. Your steps will be a bit shorter, but you can go uphill easier.\n\nTaking longer steps but at the same fast speed can help you move faster. This is good if you're not going uphill or trying to go really fast suddenly.\n\nChoosing the right gear is very important. If you try to run a whole race in a slow gear, you won't be fast enough. But don't try to go too fast uphill or on flat ground unless it's the end of the race. You might be able to go uphill a few times, but you won't finish the race well.\n\nSure, there are moments when you adjust your speed _and_ rhythm, just like when you ride a bike.\n\nIt's what you do when you want to go faster than another car on a two-lane road: you speed up and go faster. Try it when you're running. It works very well. If you're running up a hill with other runners in a race, they might find their legs moving slowly, because they're trying to go too fast. Slow down, keep a quick rhythm, and you'll zoom past them.\n\nIf you have slow feet, practice moving them quickly. Try runs where you sometimes go faster by not taking bigger steps, but only quicker ones--just like biking on a speedy trainer where you try to reach up to 130 counts.\n\nA slow speed is good for hills, but choosing the right step size for the long, flat parts of a race is very important, too. Too slow a speed--too small a step--and you won't move as fast as you could, no matter how hard you work. Too big a step and you'll get tired before the race is over. Try, just by feel, to run with a step size big enough to allow you to move quickly, but not so big that you can't keep it up over the distance you're running.\n\nAll the other parts of technique are important when you change speeds, too--balance, timing, keeping your body leaning forward, and moving your legs as if you were cycling. When you think about moving faster--like running fast or slow--think about what your arms are doing. Remember: Your arms help you move your legs fast.\n\nOnce you try it, you'll see that moving fast or slow is easy to do when you're running. It's all about how big or small your steps are, and moving your legs quickly.\n\nHere's a way to use big or small steps when you're racing:\n\nOn a flat ground, choose the biggest step--the longest step--that you can keep doing for the whole race. But, this is if you're running a fast race. If it's a slow race, and you're running slower than your fastest, you will want to use smaller steps, feeling you have lots of energy, rather than using big steps--just like when driving a toy car slowly, you will want to use smaller steps rather than bigger ones.\n\nThis will need a bit of trying, but it's important. Too big a step--and you'll get tired and your legs will slow down. Too small a step, and you won't be able to run the race as good as you can. It's like trying to win a car race while only using the first or second speed: No matter how fast your feet move, you won't be very quick.\n\nWhen running uphill or against the wind, make your steps shorter.\n\nYou won't cover as much ground with each step but, like a biker going uphill in a low speed, you'll have more strength and can keep your steps fast. You'll find yourself passing other runners who keep their step length the same but find their legs moving more and more slowly.\n\nIf someone runs past you, look at their step speed. If your feet aren't moving as quickly as theirs, try to match their speed.\n\nOf course, if your feet are moving at the same rate, that means they are taking longer steps and are simply strong enough to step faster than you. Well, there isn't much you can do about that while running a race other than moving your legs even faster.\n\nWhen you get to the end of the race, slow down a bit--like lowering a car's speed--and try to make your steps quicker. When you speed up, try to take the longest step you have the strength for while still keeping your steps fast.\n\nBikers can't win quick finishes in too low a speed, no matter how hard they try, and it doesn't work in running, either. Going up hills is easy if you move slowly. But running fast at the end of a game is very hard. I found it difficult. So did David. Maybe our bodies decide how well we can do it.\n\nIf you watch, you will see that when big race winners finish with a fast last lap their legs are moving fast. But that's not the only thing--they also take bigger steps. Moving your legs quickly and taking big steps will help you get around the track quickly.\n\nNo matter how good you are at running fast at the end of a game, always try to move the right way for where you are and what's happening. If you know how to move right, you'll have a big advantage over runners who always move at the same speed. You can go up a hill quickly while another runner struggles because he's trying to go too fast, like a car trying to go up a mountain in top speed, his legs moving slower and slower and his eyes getting bigger and bigger. And you'll know how to take bigger steps and do your best when you're on flat ground or going downhill.\n\nIf you move right, you'll finish ahead of other runners who are as fit as you. And they'll be wondering how you did it.\n\nHow you move is also important when going downhill. Taking lots of short quick steps--moving in a slow way--will make you slow down a lot, just like it would in a car. But if you are strong enough to run fast down a hill, you will move quickly and pass those runners who are slow.\n\n##### IMPORTANT THINGS TO REMEMBER\n\n- Running well depends on choosing the right pace, no matter how good you are at running. You need to find the right speed for different paths, slopes, and parts of the race. Choose the right speed for the right time and you will do better.\n\n- Running well means changing your step size--make it smaller for the hard parts, a little bigger for flat parts, and bigger to go faster--all while keeping your feet moving quickly.\n\n- Make your steps smaller (or slow down a little) but keep your feet moving fast to run up the hills.\n\n- The speed and strength of your arm movements is important for running well. If you only think about your legs when changing speed, you're only thinking about half of what you need to do.\n\n- When practicing, sometimes choose to run either too fast or too slow. Practice building leg strength by taking slightly bigger steps, and improving leg speed by taking smaller steps. Try different things. But usually, avoid moving slowly by choosing the right speed that lets you keep your feet moving quickly every time you practice, so it's easy when you run a race.\n\n#### Chapter 5\n\n#### Bendy You\n\nWhen I began as a runner, people often told me I was a bit stiff and awkward. I didn't worry about it too much, as it didn't stop me from running quick at cross country or playing ball game well at school. But I didn't really like the game with lots of sliding and falling. I tended to fall hard because I wasn't bendy, so I soon liked games without touching. Looking back, I might have seemed like a scaredy-cat--but for me the aim of sports was to get stronger, fitter, and quicker, not to end up getting hurt.\n\nBesides that, I'm not sure that being a bit stiff really bothered me. Runners were thought to be stiff. That was just one of the results of the practice you had to do to be good.\n\nBut I learned how wrong that was. Being bendy is very important to doing as well as you can: If you want to run quick, you've got to be loose and bendy. You've got to flow. Even more importantly, being bendy helps stop injuries, meaning your practice becomes more regular--which means, in turn, that you can do better and run quicker. Which, after all, is the goal.\n\nAll my teachers and friends told us kids who liked to run to stretch. But the stretches we could do during a long run on a cold winter's night were very different from those the kids playing inside on mats in a warm room would do. We didn't realize how stiff we were until we joined the other kids at different training camps.\n\nThere was a man who helped me learn to stretch, our coach at school, a funny old man we called Coach Mack. He would gather us for chats and share his thoughts - not just about sports, but about other things too.\n\nAs young athletes, he wanted us to feel strong and full of energy all the time. He believed in training hard and playing hard - although he probably wouldn't agree with how much my friend and running buddy David would do it, in both ways. David was a different kind of kid.\n\n'You can have friends', Coach Mack would tell us in his funny accent, 'as long as it doesn't get in the way of your training. Having girlfriends--no problem! When I was an athlete, I had many friends who were all active!'\n\nIt didn't have much to do with how to run, but it was all about making us kids feel strong and unbreakable. And he himself was very healthy and happy from head to toe--from his voice and his standing up straight to his excitement. That's how he was--very inspiring.\n\nOur coach, Cameron, used to train the whole school sports team on the weekends. Everyone knew that jumpers, hurdlers, runners, and vaulters needed to do lots of stretching, but Cameron encouraged long-distance runners to do it often, too. But many of them didn't like it at all. They just wanted to put on their shoes and go out and get another long run done. They didn't care about the other stuff.\n\nBut sometimes we went to Cameron's training, and he showed us how to stretch. I found out that many athletes were much more sporty and flexible than I was. I also found out that when I went for a run after stretching for a little while, I felt a lot better--and ran a lot better, too. That made me believe that, yes, getting more flexible and stretching often, especially before and after a run, was important.\n\nBefore I say more, a warning: I'm not an expert on stretching. No one's ever called me Mr. Flexible or thought of me as a twisty-turny person. I'm not crazy about stretching or yoga. I'm just one runner writing for other runners, based on what worked for me over a long time.\n\nBut that might be okay. Sometimes, big words from smart people can make things more confusing. Imagine finding a book about bending and stretching, and it has 60 different ways to do it. Who has the time for that? The book might just end up on a shelf, never to be opened again.\n\nYou don't _need_ that many ways to stretch. You also don't have to do all the odd and special stretches you might see top players doing before a big event. But you _do_ need to stretch--often. Like many things, doing a little often is better!\n\nTo begin with, the worst thing for any runner is to get hurt. On the other hand, most runners would agree that progress usually comes not from any magic training but just from regular, injury-free practice.\n\nIn my learning, regular stretching is the key to not getting hurt. Being loose, besides letting you run faster and farther, lets you train hard without getting hurt.\n\nIn the end, it was not a trainer--not even Teacher Tom--but a group of friends who gave me the best advice about stretching. In 1975, I spent some weekends in BI city, the second biggest city, training with some of the university players. BI University has always been a place for sports, and back then it would get athletes to help compete with the special sports schools of LA and BR College, as it was known then.\n\nA few boys up there--Ryan, Mike, Adam, and Isaac to name but a few--trained regularly with the BR-city-based Scottish runner Isaac. \n\nIsaac was running well after some slow years during which first David and then Ben had been running faster than him. Even though he ran for SC country in the Games and World Race, Isaac was as much a BR-city boy as they come--BR-city through and through: He was serious, straightforward, and very competitive.\n\nHe had won the long race in ED-city--not letting his fellow runner Ian move ahead of him at the end by making him run across the track, finally reaching the end in lane 6!\n\nFrom a long time ago until the mid-20th century, Isaac was one of the top long-distance runners in the world. 'First is first, and second is nowhere' was his favorite saying. 'This country is full of really good losers; what this country needs is a few really good winners!'\n\nYou can be sure that Isaac did not like losing. He came in third in the long race in the 20th century Olympics, behind the great runner (and winner of four gold medals) from FI country--an exciting race in which the first four runners all ran very fast in the last bit. Isaac finished strongly, running faster in the last few metres to get the bronze medal from the AM country runner Steve.\n\nMany runners would have been happy. But not Isaac. He told a TV person that he didn't run well and might throw his medal in the river.\n\nWe knew Isaac was running well again in the cold time. He and the other athletes from the BE city had a big help: They could run on the only inside track in the country, at the nearby Air Force base, AF base.\n\nIn that cold time, back to his best, Isaac won a big indoor 3,000-metre race one weekend, and then won a big World Race over 12K in the MO country the next weekend. Quite an achievement!\n\nI'm sure I learned a lot going there and getting to run with him now and then. But it was Ryan who gave me the best advice on stretching. He had been on the Great Britain team for the big run at the Olympics in the late 20th century, and was the first finisher for England--twice--in the big World Race in the '70s.\n\n'Look', he told me once, 'I just read this book, _Six Easy Stretches That Help Stop Hurts_.' At least I think that was the name. From what I see on the internet, it seems to be not available anymore--not surprising, considering how many years it's been since then.\n\nAnyway, the stretches in the book were very easy to do. You can do these things almost anywhere--at home, while jogging, or even at work, and it only takes a little while. And I've been doing them, or something like them, for a long time.\n\nYou should do them, too. Because if you're bendy, you can jog with more bounce. You can stay more relaxed, which helps you breathe easier. You'll take longer, loose steps and be stronger when you touch the ground. Experts say that every step puts a lot of force on that leg. If your steps are always heavy, it's no surprise runners get hurt.\n\nBut jogging feels different when you're relaxed and bendy instead of when you're stiff, heavy, and stomping on your heels. You may still be stepping with a lot of force, but if your legs are bouncy and your back is loose enough to soak up some of the force, stepping feels much lighter and easier to keep up.\n\nMost fun runners don't know they can avoid these hard things by running relaxed and bendy, with a long, flowing stride. They do the exact opposite: They know each step will be hard, and to make the impact less, they run tightly, with barely any bounce in their stride. They don't move much faster than a quick shuffle. Instead of using their joints to soften the impact, they just rely on the thick heels of their shoes. This can lead to more problems, as explained in a special chapter.\n\nYou can move like this, but in my opinion, it's not really running. It's slower than running--maybe even slower than the fastest walkers! By not moving freely, these runners miss out on learning how to run well. The more they practice running like this, the more difficult they make it to learn how to run the right way.\n\nStretching is the first step to break this pattern. If you stretch more, you will take bigger steps over time and get stronger to handle the landings. Running on soft ground helps build this strength and reduces the hard landings. You should aim to have flexible but firm and strong joints, and muscles that are stretchy but not too stretched.\n\nBesides, a freer runner is a faster runner.\n\nI remember a time when I worked hard on being flexible, often stretching for a little while before I even left my house--doing stretches there that I could only do on a soft floor, for example. It made a big difference. I can remember how flexible I was. I could feel it in my running. I got hurt less often, too, and so I was able to train regularly for two years. During that time, I won a big running race, came fourth in a global running race, won a special prize in a big running event, and ran my fastest times in two different races. Doing both stretch and strength exercises is very important. I think everyone should do it.\n\nIf your back is stiff, you might not move evenly. This can make you get hurt more easily. When you get hurt, it can lead to more injuries.\n\nHaving a loose back makes you feel good. If your back is not stiff, you can move around more easily. When you walk or run, it feels light and comfortable.\n\nI'm talking about your whole back being loose, including the lower part. Some people who stretch often forget to stretch the lower part of their back. When they try to touch their toes with their hands, they only bend the top part of their back. But you should bring your chest down towards your knees. All the bones in your back should move a little, they should be flexible. The lower back is very important: If it's loose, you can walk and run more easily. If it's stiff, you will feel uncomfortable with every step, and you won't be able to run fast.\n\nMake sure to stretch evenly. Often, kids get hurt while playing because one side of their backs is tighter than the other. This can be because they use one hand more than the other. But it can also be because of how they sit, or because they do the same things a lot, like running around in a circle to the left.\n\nThis can make kids' feet touch the ground differently. And that can be like running on a slope. Soon, they might have a problem with their hip or their knee. They might land more on one side, and because of that, they might have problems with their legs or their heels. It's just one thing after another, a bunch of things happening because of something else. Your back is so important: Take care of it. Stretch it--and make it stronger--the same on both sides.\n\nWhen should you stretch? As often as you can. More than once a day, if you want to get better. It's very easy for kids to go to a fun exercise class, or something like that. And they're proud and think they're as flexible as a bendy toy, so they don't need to do anything else. There's nothing wrong with exercise classes. But most kids go just once or twice a week, and really that's not enough. Stretching, whether you're running that day or not, should be something you do every day.\n\nIf you stretch one time in a week, you might feel a bit loose during that time. But the next day, you will wake up all tight again. And if you do nothing, the next week, when it's time for your fun class, you'll be back to the start.\n\nTry to stretch two or three times a day. You might only do it for a short time each time. That's OK. Just do a few stretches in the places you feel tight. Stretch when you watch TV or when you go up the stairs. Stretch when you walk into the kitchen for a drink or water. Make staying loose a part of your day. That works much better than having to think: 'Oh, I'm playing now; therefore, I've got to stretch.'\n\nRather than having to stretch because you're running, I would almost think of it the other way round: Whether I'm playing or not, I'd stretch anyway, just to stay loose. You don't even need to change clothes. The worst thing is to be sitting for a long time in a car or at your table. You stiffen up! But your body is made to move, so get up and stretch as a normal thing and then fit in a run or some other game in between. And if you're running two times a day, it's easy to stretch four times a day--before and after each run.\n\nSure, everyone's time is short. Many friends tell me, 'Oh, I don't stretch before I run, but I do after.' Maybe they've read in a book that that's the best way to do it. Well, there's more to it: Stretching after you run helps you feel better. But stretching before your run is just as important, if not more so. I don't like to feel tight when I run, and I think it's risky.\n\nAnd don't just stretch your legs and lower back. You want your neck and shoulders to be loose and relaxed, too.\n\nRemember, the thing that stops you from running faster is almost always that you're out of breath. You see a lot of regular runners who look very stiff and tight in their shoulders. One shoulder is up near their ear, or their arms are so close to their chest they can't breathe properly. It all looks so uncomfortable. If you're tight in the chest and shoulders, you can't breathe as much as you should. The ability to breathe easily is very important in running, to say the least.\n\nAs you run, you want to feel tall, relaxed, and comfortable. The relaxation should flow in two directions--from your neck and shoulders down, and from your feet coming up. You want to feel light and not tense from head to toe. You want to land soft and easy on your feet.\n\nLook at great runners like Kevin who, with many gold medals and wins, is the best long runner in the world today. He and others at the top are running really fast, just moving fast around the track or almost going over the cross country course. And they don't look worried at all.\n\nBut go to your nearby race, and you'll see people going half as fast while looking two times as worried. Some of these people would run a lot faster if they could learn how to relax. They'd use less energy, that's for sure. And they would free up their run. It's about running tall, relaxed, and balanced. You need to allow yourself to be loose even when you're moving fast.\n\n##### HOW TO STRETCH\n\nBefore we talk about the best stretches to do, let's talk about the best way to do stretches in general.\n\nYour muscles have a way that stops your ability to get loose and become more soft. To put it simple, when you get close to stretching a joint too much, your body's first thought is to keep the joint safe rather than the muscle. It does this by making the muscle tight, a thing known as the stretch way. This way is started by parts in your body, which are located where muscles meet the thing that connects them to the bone. They stop a stretch from going too far and hurting the part where two bones meet.\n\nTo get more bendy, it helps to stop this stretch stopper, and there's a simple way to do this--basically to trick your body into letting the stretch happen. It's called a special stretch, and if you can't remember its name, don't worry. I had to remember it too. If you help a muscle by giving it something hard to work against, the muscle helper feels it doesn't need to do its work, and it eases its hold. Then you can gently stretch the muscle a bit more than before. (You can also make the muscle helpers relax by making the opposite muscle tense, depending on the stretch you're doing.)\n\nEven if it doesn't make sense at first, this special stretch involves pushing gently against the stretch. Here's how it works: Let's say you're trying to stretch the back of your leg by lying on your back and using your hands to pull your straight leg up toward your shoulder. You should be holding your leg below the knee, otherwise the knee will bend.\n\nTry gently pushing your leg against your hands--away from your shoulder--breathing out and relaxing as you push against the hard thing. Use your hands to keep your leg in place; don't let it actually move away from you, despite the push.\n\nAfter pressing on your hands for a bit, rest and use your hands to lift your leg even higher. Because you have helped your leg muscles as you pressed on your hands, the small parts inside your muscles have relaxed. They have thought that there's no harm to the hip and knee parts and have let go of their hold on the leg muscles, letting you stretch them further safely. Do this three to four times and you'll find you're able to stretch more each time.\n\nYou can do this by yourself or, better yet, with a friend, who can help you with the stretch. This is a very good way for increasing your flexibility and how much you can move.\n\nNow let's talk about the most important stretches to do often. They are probably best done in this order: back and leg muscles; muscles in your legs and hips; muscles inside your legs; muscles in your lower legs; and muscles and lines down the outside of your legs.\n\n1. BACK AND LEG MUSCLES\n\nAs I said before, your back is very important, and you should think of your leg muscles as being a part of your back. Here's an exercise that stretches both. I used to do it using a high thing to jump over but a three-foot-high wall, fence, dining room table, or even stair banisters may do just as well--just depending on how tall you are.\n\nHow To\n\nPut your whole leg in front of you on the edge of the table which should be almost as high as your waist. The other foot stays on the floor. Lean your body towards the leg that's on the table, breathe out slowly and try to touch your toes with your hands. Don't just try to get your head near your knee: That only stretches the upper back. Try to get your chest near your knee so that you feel a small and nice stretch in your lower back and leg.\n\nCoaching Point\n\nIt's better to have the whole leg on the table than just your heel on a fence or the stairs. When your whole leg is supported, there's no risk of hurting your knee--so your body can relax instead of getting tight to protect itself. You'll feel the stretch in your back and in the leg that's up. The muscles in the front of the standing leg will also get a good stretch, if you keep that leg straight--if the table or wall is the right height.\n\n2. LEG AND HIP MUSCLES\n\nKids can't avoid using their leg and hip muscles (the muscles in front of the hips and thighs which you use every time you lift your knees), and so it is important to keep these muscles stretched and loose.\n\nHow To\n\nFirst, stretch your legs like you're taking a big step (picture 1), let the heel of your back foot lift up and keep your body straight. Next, it's good to stretch your leg muscles all together. Start with your right leg by standing on your left foot (picture 2). Hold your right foot with your right hand and pull it straight back and up behind you. Here's the trick: Pull on your foot so your leg moves back behind you, too, and feels a good stretch. The muscle in the front of your hip will feel a stretch, as well--unless you let yourself lean forward. Don't. Stand tall, with your body straight, reaching towards the sky with your left hand.\n\nBe Careful!\n\nYou are _not_ trying to hurt your knee. Stretch the front of your hips and leg muscles.\n\nHelpful Hint\n\nOften you see people pulling on their foot while their knee points straight down, right next to their other one. That's not a full or good enough stretch; that's just holding onto your foot. Make sure to pull your leg back so your knee is pointing a little behind you and you feel the stretch along the front and top of your leg. You can get a better stretch by pushing your foot against your hand and slightly straightening your knee. Then, of course, swap legs.\n\nHaving strong and stretchy legs is very important when running down a slope. When people who have not run before think about a very long race, they often think of a big hill. This hill has a scary name and, yes, it does come after you've run a long way. But it's only a short distance. The hard part of this long race is not this small distance--it's that the race path is mostly _downhill_. The first part of the race is downhill, there's a steep downhill in the middle, and it's all downhill near the end. And those who finish often say that all that downhill running was hard on their legs.\n\nFor example, a runner named Lucas, who was the best runner in CT state in 2010, thought he could finish the race in a short time. But he ended up walking across the end line and finishing in a longer time.\n\n'My legs hurt a lot,' he told the local news. 'At a certain point, my legs just couldn't run anymore.' And he had practiced a lot of downhill running, trying to get ready.\n\n3. LEG MUSCLES\n\nRunners often don't stretch their leg muscles because they don't seem to work very hard when running. But don't ignore them! They are very important when you're running, and if you hurt them you will not be able to run. The easiest, and best, ways to stretch are to do a sideways move and a runner's stretch.\n\nHow To\n\nTo do the side step (like in a picture), keep one foot straight and flat on the ground, and bend the other leg slowly until you feel a small stretch on the inside of your leg. Keep your body straight--there's no need to lean forward.\n\nThe second stretch (like in another picture) not only stretches the inside leg muscles but the whole back leg, hip, tummy, and lower back areas too. It's a very good stretch often used by people who jump over things. To do this stretch, stand on one foot, side to a table. Rest the other knee and foot on the table, bent like a square at the knee and ankle. You're going to look a lot like a person who jumps over things just as he goes over the thing. Now bend forward at the waist, slowly reach down towards the floor, let your breath out, and relax. Don't jump!\n\nTips\n\nVery few runners do this, but I used to find it very helpful. Many runners get back leg nerve problems as a result of a tight, hurt or not straight hip joint. This is the joint in the tummy that supports the base of the spine and gives your tummy a needed bit of softness as you take your weight on each leg. This jumping over things stretch is a great one to loosen up the muscles and joints around your hips, tummy, and lower back.\n\n4. Little Leg Stretches\n\nThere are two important stretches for the little leg muscles. First, we'll talk about the bigger of the two.\n\nHow To\n\nTo stretch the big little leg muscle, lean against a wall, post, tree or something else. Put the foot of the leg you want to stretch on the ground behind you, toes pointed forward. The other leg will be closer to the wall (or tree), with the knee bent because you're leaning forward over it. Keeping the heel of your back foot on the ground and the knee straight, lean gently forward and feel the stretch in your little leg. Don't let your backside stick out. Keep your body in a straight line, from the back foot up through your neck and head.\n\nCoaching Point\n\nHold the stretch for a little bit, as long as it feels good. Remember to stretch evenly on both sides: When you switch, put the other foot back as far as the first one was, and hold the stretch for the same count. You can do two or three stretches on each leg, stretching a little more each time and slightly changing the angle of your foot. You can control the stretch by changing how much weight you put on the front foot.\n\n5. Little Legs (Deep Muscle)\n\nThere is another muscle in your little leg, which is deeper than the top one. To stretch this deep muscle, you need to do a different stretch.\n\nHow To\n\nTo stretch the deep muscle in the lower part of your little leg, bend the knee of the leg you're stretching while keeping your foot on the ground (see picture). Keep your back straight. The other leg is behind you for balance, also bent, not holding much weight. Bend the knee of your front leg more, bringing the knee forward and down toward your toes, while keeping the foot flat on the ground.\n\nBe Careful!\n\nIt may be hard to feel the stretch at first, but gently bend your knee even more, and you'll feel it. Remember, don't stick your backside out.\n\nHelpful Tip\n\nHold the stretch for a little bit, relax, and stretch again, little by little, several times. Do it the same on both sides.\n\nThis stretch is good to do before running, and also after running or a race. This is because during a hard run your little leg muscles will have worked hard and may get stiff afterwards if you don't stretch them. Not only this, if your little legs stay stiff you'll be more likely to get tightness in the back of your ankle, which can easily become a big ouchy. This is serious and it can take a lot of time to get better, maybe even needing a doctor's help. So don't let it happen! Remember, it is always better to stop something bad from happening than trying to fix it.\n\nOne job of your calf muscle is to lift your heel up and push off with your foot. The other job is to cushion your foot when you step, to soften the landing before your heel touches the ground and lifts off again. But if your calves lose their stretchiness, landing can become more painful, making you run more on your heels. This could lead to other hurts in the hips, knees, and back.\n\n6. BUM AND LEG MUSCLES\n\nLots of runners have problems with their bum muscles and leg muscles.\n\nThe bum muscle is a small muscle that goes from the bottom of your spine to the bone in your thigh, about where your bum creases. If the bum muscle is tight, your knees tend to point out a bit, making the outside of your foot and leg work too hard when you land. This can cause big hurts. First, you can strain the muscles on the inside of your thigh. And second, you can strain the outside of your thigh--the leg muscle.\n\nThe big leg band is like a strong ribbon that runs down the outside of your leg from the hip to just above the knee. It helps the knee, stopping too much side-to-side motion, and in runners it really gets used a lot. Sometimes it gets very tight, and swelling of the big leg band can lead to bad knee hurt.\n\nA tight leg muscle can also press on a big nerve, making your bottom feel like it's very hot and sending hurt down your leg. This is called the leg muscle problem. It's a big nerve problem that's not been caused by anything bad like back injury.\n\nAll these problems can mostly be stopped by making loose and stretching the leg muscle and the big leg band--and, of course, by watching how you run. Running in the right way is very important in running; I've talked about it in detail in part 3.\n\nHow To\n\nTo keep both your leg muscles and your big leg bands healthy and flexible, sit on the floor with your left leg straight in front of you. Put your right foot flat on the floor outside of your left knee, gently pull your right knee to your left shoulder, and hold it. You'll feel the stretch on the outside of your bottom and along the outside of your leg. Try it two or three times using the stretching technique described before (i.e., pushing your knee against your hands), slowly making the stretch bigger each time. Then change legs.\n\nTeaching Tip\n\nMost people who run only think of certain leg muscles and their ITBs after they get hurt. Often, that's the first they ever hear of these parts of their body. But people who run regularly can have problems with both, and you know what they say about stopping trouble before it starts. Keep these leg muscles and ITB relaxed and they'll be good to you.\n\nFinally, let me give you some extra stretches that weren't in that book Adam told me about so long ago. I talked earlier about your back and the importance of keeping it relaxed. Here's a good stretch that's also best done on the floor.\n\nTo keep your lower back relaxed, lie on your back and--keeping your left leg flat on the floor, toes up--pull your right knee up to your right shoulder. Hold it there for a good stretch. Now pull your right knee over to your left shoulder and again hold it and give it time to stretch. Then swing your right knee and foot across so they touch the carpet on the outside of your left knee.\n\nSometimes you may notice a few little sounds in your back as the back and lower region of the spine become relaxed. It's not painful, and the feeling can be immediate. Suddenly you feel relaxed and you can breathe easily again.\n\nYou can also relax your back by kneeling, reaching far forward onto the floor with your hands and, almost like a cat, making your spine--especially the upper back between your shoulder blades--flat.\n\nYou need to keep your neck and shoulders relaxed. They can become tight, not just from running, but from normal, everyday things. And running can make this worse.\n\nTo make your neck feel better once you've warmed up, nod your head slowly forward and back a few times, and move your head side to side, from one shoulder to the other. Don't roll it around in a circle like some runners do. That's a little dangerous!\n\nIn the same way, with your neck relaxed, move your shoulders three times with your arms straight out. Be careful not to lift your shoulders up near your ears. Then move them three times the other way.\n\nAnother good way to stretch and loosen your arms and shoulders--one I often tell the kids I'm helping--is by swimming. Do the front and back strokes, but not the frog stroke. These two strokes make your shoulders feel good. Your body floats in the water; everything's relaxed; your muscles are warmed up. And you're stretching and reaching forward under the water. If you're doing the front stroke, breathe to each side one at a time to keep things even. Running is such an even activity compared to other games: Stick ball, hit ball, net ball, and base ball are all one-sided games. Apart from running around left-hand turns on the track, everything in running should be the same on both sides, first one side and then the other. So do your exercises, your practice, and your swimming (and carrying your little bag) the same on both sides.\n\nAt the end, you want your whole body to be as bendy as possible. That's a big part of being a sports player. It's about not getting hurt and doing better. Moving a stiff, tight body takes a lot more effort than it should.\n\nBeing bendy and free will help you keep steady. It will make your steps and your breathing easier. You'll just feel better and more natural as you run. If you're loose and relaxed, you'll pass your friends who train as much as you but don't think stretching's important.\n\nMake making your body bendy a regular part of your routine--do just a little stretch or two in between things. Make it a habit. When you finish this chapter and put the book down, stretch your back or your legs before you go on to the next thing. Keeping bendy and having a good posture will make you feel better as you go through the day. You'll feel sharper at school. You'll move more easily. And you'll be able to pick toys up off the floor without making a face.\n\nBeing bendy is very important to running well. But it helps with a lot more than that. Feeling good is all about keeping your body loose and free.\n\n##### IMPORTANT THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND\n\n- Make stretching a part of your daily habits, not just something you do before or after running.\n\n- Stretch equally on both sides to avoid unevenness, which can cause pain.\n\n- Ideally, stretch before and after your playtime. You want to feel relaxed and easy during playtime.\n\n- You can stretch between playtimes as often as you like. You don't have to wear your play clothes. Just stretch!\n\n#### Chapter 1\n\n#### Breathe Deeply\n\nHere's something I think might surprise many kids: When I was at my best, running many quick laps, I wasn't out of breath. I was trying as hard as I could, believe me--running as fast as I could. But I was still able to keep my breathing calm and controlled: generally a nice, even rhythm of three steps for each breath in and three more for each breath out.\n\nWhen I did my best that night long time ago, I wasn't out of breath even in the last lap. To be honest, I can't remember exactly how I controlled my breathing on that final round--I was probably too busy with other things, like trying to figure out how I could run faster this time. But I can promise you that, even then, I wasn't breathing any more often than two steps in and two steps out. Henry and I had a race one day. He won that day with the best time ever in our country.\n\nIn my running days, I got to race with many great runners--runners who broke records, won at the big games, and became champions. I don't remember any of them running out of breath. I trained with my friends Dave and Steve--they also broke records. They never ran out of breath--and it wasn't just because they found it so easy to run with me!\n\nThis can't be said for most runners we see every day, though. Many of them breathe in two ways--inhale for two steps and exhale for two steps if they're running at a comfortable speed, and inhale for one step and exhale for one step if they're running fast or going up a hill. Some of them try to find a middle way, like inhaling for two steps and exhaling for one step. That's not balanced and not good at all.\n\nThere's a reason the great runners don't breathe in and out with every step, even when they're trying their best: It doesn't help. It would use up too much energy. It would keep them from running as fast as they can.\n\nAnd the same is true for you.\n\nBeing scared and breathing quickly can make you tense when you want to be relaxed, which means you can't use your lungs as well as you can. You're too tense; your chest is too tight; your breaths are too shallow. When you breathe fast, you take in less air. It's better to breathe slow, deep, and steady.\n\nNobody teaches you how to run or breathe. People think they are natural, not skills. But running fast and breathing steady are skills. They don't come naturally to everyone. My work as a coach has taught me this. The hardest part is controlling your breathing. But it's important. If you can't breathe easy and steady while you run fast, you'll have to stop.\n\nIt's the same for swimming. The first thing is to control your breathing. When you can do that, you can get better.\n\nLuckily, running is easier. Your head isn't underwater and you're not scared of drowning. But the idea is the same: Learn this skill, and you'll run faster. If you can breathe easy and feel okay running fast, running becomes easier and more fun.\n\nThe first step is to tell yourself that you can control your breathing more than you think. Try it and you'll see. You can breathe slow and deep in situations where you would have thought it tough.\n\nI know many people say they can't. If they've just run up a hill, for example, or played very fast, they have no choice but to breathe hard and fast. They feel scared when they're out of breath. They think that if they don't breathe fast, they might faint from lack of air. The fast breathing is a reflex; it's involuntary; it's just what the body does when it needs air. They're sure they can't control it.\n\nBut I think they can.\n\nI have a little game I use to show this to people, often with groups of kids, but it works with anyone. I let them all do some fast exercises to get them well out of breath, after which they gather in a group, breathing like a big volcano. Then I tell them they need to know their heart rates, so they all have to count their pulse for 10 seconds.\n\nSuddenly, quiet falls. The fast breathing stops as if by magic. They can't hold their breath for 10 seconds at that point; instead what you're left with is strong, quiet, controlled breathing while they focus on their counting--proof that people can control their breathing more than they think. Which is actually much more important than knowing what their heart rate was!\n\nNow that you know you can change bad breathing into good breathing, let's talk about how to get better at it while you're running fast.\n\nA lot of people have trouble when they start to run out of breath. They don't let out enough air, so there's not much space for new air to come into their lungs. This can make you feel like you can't breathe, get scared, or even have trouble breathing from exercising.\n\nWhen you're running, the secret to controlling your breath starts with letting the air out. Breathe out slowly and fully, and you'll make more room for new air filled with oxygen. Breathing in is something your body does without thinking about it; it's breathing out that you need to control. When you're running, unlike swimming where you only have time for a quick breath, you should take as long to breathe in as you do to breathe out. This needs you to control yourself. I think the best tip is to count your breathing with your steps, always keeping an even count of four steps in, four steps out, or three and three, or two and two, depending how hard you are running.\n\nThis way of breathing might be hard at first if you're not used to it. Changing a habit you've had for a long time can be hard. You might get a little scared and think you can't keep it up. Being calm while breathing out slowly can be tough. You might feel a strong need to breathe and then suddenly let out a big breath, almost like someone who's been upset and then takes a deep breath. This will make you feel much better and you can calm down and realize that things are not so bad.\n\nI don't really know why your body feels better when you do that, but I found it's a good thing to practice. Because after a big breath, I'd feel everything was fine. I was still moving quickly, I was still able to keep my steps long, and I was still breathing four steps in and four steps out, which is how I trained.\n\nI have mentioned that none of the top athletes I ran with had hard breaths as they ran. Maybe I should have said almost none. Zachary, the skilled (and often without shoes) runner and world record holder, was an exception.\n\nDespite her skills, Zachary is most known for having bumped into the runner Madison from the US, another world record holder, in the final race at the big games in the city of LA. Madison fell hard, the race continued, and the dream of gold she had for a long time was lost forever. At first, Madison blamed Zachary for the bump. Even though many years later Madison changed her mind, Zachary will always be remembered for that moment and will always feel the sadness of being disqualified in a big game final.\n\nEarlier that year, Benjamin came to the BR country to train. His home country was not allowed in the big games. He wanted to be part of the BR team to play in the games--and he did. He was just 17 years old then, and I trained with him several times.\n\nRunning with him, it always felt like he was running too hard. He was breathing very heavy. It was very clear, and you'd think 'He can't keep this going, he must slow down soon.' But he never did! He just kept going. But every little while, he would take one big breath, and then let it out like a big sigh. And then right away he'd be back to his heavy breathing. It was really odd. I don't think he even knew he was doing it. But it did seem to help him control his breathing and keep up such a fast speed.\n\nI've been talking so far about matching your breathing to your steps. And controlling your breathing is really important. But actually, it can be very useful to think of it the other way round: Try matching your steps to your breathing. Instead of using your steps to slow your breathing, use your breathing to make your steps faster. If you've read this far into the book, you'll know that fast feet are needed to run fast. If you don't let yourself take a breath until after you've taken four steps, it helps you move your feet faster. And you can try to take bigger steps while keeping your feet just as quick--which is how you run very fast. Use your breathing to help keep that fast, urgent step.\n\nI remember my usual lunchtime run around the Big Green Park in HA town--a huge L-shaped park that went along two sides of the town, probably more than four miles around. I always had little markers on my regular runs that let me know how I was doing. On this one, I'd warm up and stretch in the first half mile, and then there was a road to cross to get to the park. Normally, it would take four or five steps to cross it. But sometimes, without trying, I found myself doing it in just three. What a feeling--no effort, and just covering a lot of ground! So that was the first little marker on the run, a real sign that I was in the groove and moving well.\n\nI would usually do my lap around the park at a pretty steady pace, running mostly on the grass. And at the end, there was a quite a long, slightly uphill finish on the sidewalk, which had large, evenly spaced stones. Even though it was uphill, I would try to land only on every third stone--making myself take slightly bigger steps while still keeping a four steps in, four steps out breathing pattern. I was running fast uphill and it was very hard. It was like a game to keep running fast! And trying to breathe correctly was tough. It was hard to keep doing it for a long time.\n\nI was trying to act like I was running in a place where there isn't much air. Today, this is called hypoxic training. It's thought to help your muscles work better when there isn't much air, like at the end of a race. Coaches have swimmers do it--they tell the athletes to breathe once every six swims--or not at all for a whole swim. That's hard, too, and it's what I was trying to do on that run.\n\nIf you want to breathe well, it's important to have big lungs. Like your heart, your lungs get used to what you ask them to do. And just like a big heart doesn't need to beat as much as a small heart to move the same amount of blood, a big pair of lungs doesn't need to breathe as much as a small pair.\n\nLong steady runs will help your body's ability to use air. But your little lungs will only get really big if your runs are hard enough to stretch not only how well they work but also how big and strong they are.\n\nIf you feel tight when you run or if you don't stand up straight, your back, shoulders, and chest can become stiff. This can make it harder to breathe. You might only take small breaths and let the air out before your body gets all the oxygen it needs. This can make you feel tired and out of breath quickly.\n\nLong ago, in a famous movie, athletes would open their window first thing in the morning and take deep breaths. Sometimes, this was all the exercise they did for the day. They had a good idea, they just needed to do a little more exercise!\n\nSwimming can help make your upper body stronger and more flexible. Try the front crawl or back stroke. You can also try exercises like push-ups and lifting light weights. When you lift a weight, breathe out hard. When you let the weight back down, breathe in slowly.\n\nBesides lifting weights while lying on your back, there are two other exercises that can help. These exercises won't make you stronger, but they will stretch your chest and shoulder muscles. This can help you breathe easier. You only need very light weights for these exercises:\n\n- Lie on your back, just like you would for lifting weights. Hold a light weight in each hand and reach your arms up. Laying flat on the bed, slowly breathe in and move your arms to the sides of your head. Your arms should be straight out like a bird's wings, with your elbows a little bent so you don't hurt yourself. Breathe out hard as you bring your arms back to the start.\n\n- Laying the same way with your arms straight up and something heavy in each hand, move your arms out to your sides until they're straight out like a bird's wings (again, a little bend in the elbows), then slowly bring them back to the start. Remember: Breathing in a steady, calm way--breathing in as you spread out and out as you lift--is very important.\n\nRemember, being strong in your top half makes you run better in many ways, so you're doing more than just helping your breathing. Being bendy and strong helps you breathe the right way, but that's not all you need.\n\nJust like you can make your muscles grow, you can make your lung space grow by breathing in deep and stretching the chest muscles to let your lungs get really big. Your lungs have lots and lots of tiny air bags where the air you breathe in is swapped for the air you breathe out. It is here that air is soaked up into the blood. These tiny air bags have a lot of space--the size of a big game court if they were spread out. But if you don't breathe in deep--or if your chest muscles are not bendy enough to let your lungs get really big--many of the tiny air bags aren't used at all. Your body's way of taking in air isn't working at its best. \n\nMost people who don't move much only use a small part of their lungs. Some runners use a bit more. You want to use as much as you can.\n\nThis is important not only during a race, but also when you're practicing. Your lungs have little air sacs surrounded by tiny blood vessels. When you exercise, you get more of these tiny blood vessels in your lungs. But this only happens in the part of your lungs that you use often. It's not good to have more tiny blood vessels for just half of your air sacs. You want to work on all of them.\n\nIn these practices, how fast you run isn't important. What matters is that you don't rest for long, so your legs don't get too tired or hurt. A good start would be to run 100 metres four times, taking a break of 15 seconds after each run, and resting for two minutes after all four runs. This makes you breathe hard--and rest--20 times. But you've only run two kilometres, and soon your legs won't feel too tired.\n\nFrom this start, you can try two different things: You can try to skip the 15-second breaks until you end up running longer distances at almost the same speed and with the same two-minute breaks. You can try to run four times on a short path five times, with a small break of a little time. A middle step would be to run a short and a bit longer path alternately.\n\nA little time is not much for a break. After such a short break, you'll still be huffing and puffing, and thinking you're not ready to go again. But push yourself: Once you start running, you'll feel fine, and your breathing will become normal again. It's odd but true--you will feel more tired during these short breaks than when you're running quickly. And remember, in a race, you don't get to rest at all. So you should be sure that you can run quickly and keep it up. You'll know that you've run 20 times much faster than your race speed and that, if you try hard during a part of the race, you can recover very quickly. Keep your breathing calm and easy, maybe by taking a big breath at the top of the hill, and you'll be running again while the other runners are taking a long way to gather themselves back together.\n\nThere's another good thing about quiet, calm breathing: It scares the other runners. If the runner next to you is breathing hard and fast, you feel that he or she is having a harder time than you are. And you feel like you can speed up anytime you want. And that runner's view of you will be of a very fit person who's just moving easy!\n\nTo tell the truth, although that's right most of the time--I do remember a different time. One year in a big race in a place called MI country, a long race, I was not running really well at the time, but I was in the front group of three. After about a little while, one of the other boys was breathing hard, sounding like a loud machine. I heard him next to me, making loud noises, 'Uhhh-huhhh, uhhh-huhhh, uhhh-huhhh.' I thought, Wow, that boy is running too fast. He's never going to keep that speed.'\n\nAnd, what do you know, the silly boy ran the whole way like that and in the end moved away from me and won the race! I could not believe it. But I have to say that's very unusual, so don't copy it. It won't help. That boy won even though he wasted a lot of energy on his breathing, not because of it. In a strange way, he tricked me because he sounded so bad. I thought I had won, but I lost my pace, and he kept moving away.\n\nYou will help yourself by doing some specific breathing exercises in your practice. You could try these:\n\n- Talk without stopping during your runs, even when you're running uphill. Don't show if you're tired. Just ask your friend a hard question at the start of a hill and see how they answer!\n\n- Once in a while, try to breathe in for four steps and out for four steps while running fast.\n\nLearning to breathe right when you run helps a lot. It lets your lungs take in more air and helps you feel calm, saving your strength. It also doesn't let the other runners know you're tired.\n\nIt should feel like a car going from a high place to a low place without using brakes. It's a big change!\n\n##### THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND\n\n- Run standing tall and calm so your chest can fill with air.\n\n- Make your upper body strong and your chest and shoulders flexible by swimming and lifting things.\n\n- If you're running with friends, talk a lot.\n\n- Try to do your regular runs while breathing in for three steps and breathing out for three steps for as long as you can.\n\n- Sometimes, try to run while breathing in for four steps and out for four steps for a short time.\n\n- Make your lungs stronger by running short times with very short breaks.\n\n#### Chapter 7\n\n#### Fun Run\n\nOne day, when it was sunny, I was outside. The cold of winter was gone, the days were longer, and a big race in LO city was coming. I saw many people running and they were all running by themselves.\n\nThen I thought: I don't see runners in groups anymore. They are almost always alone. And they always have things in their ears to listen to music. It looks lonely and not fun.\n\nWhen I used to run, we would often run in groups. We would talk, laugh, and the time would pass quickly. It was a fun activity. Now running has become a little lonely, and I think that's sad.\n\nI joined a running group when I was a little older than most preschool kids, as soon as I had started running at school. There are many good things about joining a group--like learning and races but also making friends and running together. But there can be some not so good things too--for example, sometimes the running is not what you want or it's too easy. However, running alone is not always fun, and it's not the best way to get better.\n\nI started running at school, a school in the upper part of LO city, where my dad taught about animals and plants and coached the running team. Once upon a time, there was a man named Ryan who was a good runner. He won a race during his time in the national service. He knew how to train for running because he did it himself. He trained a lot of school teams and they did really well. We may not remember running up many hills, but we did run up some. We also ran around the school grounds and practiced running over fields and jumping over fences because those were part of our school running route.\n\nRyan also planned training camps in a place we'll call the 'SN mountains', which was a beautiful place with lots of mountains. We stayed there for a week, running early in the morning and then walking in the mountains all day. This was good for our training and it also helped us become a better team.\n\nOur school was friends with the local club, which we'll call the 'SH club'. It was a very old running club. I joined the club after my 13th birthday and soon I was running a lot of races for the club and the school.\n\nBut for the next three years, I only trained at school. And it became clear that being naturally good and my dad's training sessions weren't enough. I was getting better but I was still having trouble keeping up with the best runners. When I was 16, I could still only just run a mile in less than 5 minutes. Many boys I could run faster than in the forest, but they were faster than me on the running field. Yes, I was a bit slow!\n\nThen came Benjamin, one of our best team coaches, who was already helping David, and had a group of kids turning into a good team. He quickly had me running 40 miles each week, including running up a hill, running on a field, and a long run of 10 miles every week. Within three months, I was able to run a mile in just a short time--but still not quite good enough to make the big race that year.\n\nWhen the leaves began to fall, I increased my running to 70 miles each week. I often ran twice a day, and I increased my long run to 12, 13, and sometimes even 15 miles, and I did two fast runs each week. Suddenly, I was winning nearly every race I entered. The next summer, I made my mile time even shorter, did really well for 3,000 metres (8:14) and won the big 5,000 metres race.\n\nNot only was Benjamin's coaching great, the guys making the team's plans were also really smart. They didn't just let us drift along. They took care of us--making sure we were ready, that we were at the start on time, and that we got our clothes back at the end of the race.\n\nI remember getting ready early in the morning for my first big run in BE town, near the sea. It was quite cold and while I was warming up I could feel a little pain in my side--something that often happened to me, especially in cold weather.\n\nLooking for something to keep my tummy warm, my dad and Ben found a newspaper. They wanted me to put it inside my shirt. That's an old trick, where people put newspaper inside their shirts to stay warm.\n\nI was just a kid, and I didn't really like the idea. I didn't want to run with a newspaper in my shirt. But it worked great. I ran very well, coming fourth even though I tripped and had to get up from the last place.\n\nI know, we were just kids, so maybe you'd think the grown-ups would take care of us. But they made us feel excited and part of a team, and it felt important to them. They gave us a reason to run really hard. It was different from a fun run, where you just go to see if you can finish. It was a real race! There were lots of other teams! You could feel the excitement and anticipation. It was _fun!_\n\nLook, there's no doubt--more people running has been good for health. But something's been lost, too. Many people run races nowadays by themselves. The kids may shout, 'Go on, Mum!' But it really doesn't matter to anyone how any person finishes. Not even, maybe, to Mum herself. The goal just seems to be to finish.\n\nIt's a big change. And I think deep down it's a mind change--a feeling now that the goals we set are just about finishing rather than playing.\n\nThe 'Go on, Mum' fun run is not bad. It gets people moving and into the fresh air. But it's not the same as a real race where every moment counts, where people run for themselves _and_ their friends. Then, you're playing for someone. You're part of a team, and that's a big reason to try. If you try harder and pass just one more person, that can help your team's place at the end of the race. Your friends are counting on you to try your best, which is all anyone can ask. It's not just a game anymore. It matters. And then after you talk about what was good and what was bad, have a laugh or two, and either feel happy about doing well or promise to do better next time.\n\nGroups give you more than just fun games. They are a good place to find friends to play with. Playing with friends is better than playing alone. I suggest playing in small groups--maybe six children--rather than big, hard-to-manage groups. Having just one friend is even better. You should find a friend who is a little better than you for your hard games to encourage you. And you might want to find a friend who is not as good as you for your easy games, because it's important to include easy games in your playtime, and it helps to not always be pushed to play harder than you want. Even though you might feel very good that day, you don't want to turn your playtime into a hard game.\n\nGroups often have a regular plan of games, which can make your week organized. Instead of not knowing what to do, you'll know that on Sunday morning all your friends will be there for a long game, for example. Tuesday evening they'll be playing games that include hills or fast running, and Thursdays might be a quick or long-lasting game.\n\nYou'll also find yourself in the world of playing, knowing all kinds of information and fun stories you otherwise wouldn't know. You'll hear from your play friends--now that you have some--where the best play shops are (preferably run by those who love to play), what kind of gear seems to work the best, what they do about discomfort, what games have helped them, where the best games are, and more.\n\nSure, you can learn all this from the web or talking with runners, but it's really fun to talk with your friends while you run, and in the room where you change clothes after.\n\nEven though I said this, being part of a club might have problems that you need to watch out for--and fix, if you need to. Some clubs don't have anyone who really helps out and makes the practice times work well.\n\nA good club should have someone who not just knows what practices to do, but also knows how and when to do them--and how to change them for each person in the group and for different times of the year. Because people are all different, not all of them can do the same practice. Or the same practice might not be good for them because what they want to do is different. Maybe some want to run a really long race, while others may have just had a big race or are just getting better from getting hurt.\n\nBut many clubs don't have anyone like that. Instead of changing the practices, the person in charge just says, take it or leave it. Or no one helps out at all. And some clubs don't add a lot of plan to your week. Instead of a night for running fast and another for running up hills--hopefully made to help runners of different levels--the problem is that everyone just comes together in a big group and makes up reasons for not doing a hard practice that night.\n\n'Oh, I'm a little hurt', they say--or sick, or tired, or something else.\n\n'OK, friends', someone will say, 'let's just go for a slow run.'\n\nAnd after a while they start in a group of 30 or so, which is too big, and walk along on a medium-length, medium-speed run without any clear training goal in mind. That might be friendly, even fun, and it's surely better than not running at all. But that kind of run can easily become a little race, which can be fun, but not good for those who are trying hard to keep up, and not very helpful for the better runners either. No matter your level, you really need more clear and planned sessions to help you get better. Too many nice, friendly club runs like that can stop you from improving unless you take control of your own training.\n\nOf course, after doing those sessions, it's really good to join in the club's slow runs. The friendly side of running clubs is great, but in the right amount. It used to be--and at some clubs it still is--that people arrived in regular clothes, changed at the club, did a session, showered and changed afterward, then maybe had a drink or even went out for a snack.\n\nBut now it's more usual for people to arrive already changed into in their running clothes, then stand around for a long time before actually starting. It's good to start with a clear goal in mind. It's like when you know you have to finish a game fast. You might have to run around a lot, or you have to be back home before it gets dark. This can make you feel excited and maybe a little worried because the game might be hard. But that's okay. You, or maybe your friend who's leading the game, know what you have to do. You can talk while you're playing, but don't wait too long for your friends to start the game. You might lose your excitement.\n\nOnce the game is over, it's time to rest. But don't stand outside for too long in your sweaty clothes, talking and getting cold. That's not good for your body. You should change into dry clothes, and then have a cup of juice. At least put on some warm, dry clothes and do some stretching while you're talking.\n\nAnother problem with groups can be the pressure to compete every week. _Don't_ compete every week! You'll become tired and stuck in a routine.\n\nYou need to be fresh in your mind for competitions. Competing is, after all, a performance; It's something special and not just another run. Not only that, you also need to keep some weekends free so you can fit in some of your harder activities. Choose your competitions--and stick to your plan. Remember, you're competing for yourself, too, not just for your group. Your group's job should be to help you improve, not compete you to exhaustion.\n\nI liked competing. I used to compete a lot--too much for my own good, in many ways. I often ran 40 or 50 competitions a year, mainly by choice but sometimes because of group pressure. Obviously, some competitions are harder than others. And sometimes I ran two or even three competitions in an afternoon, either to help my group or the team or to help with my own practice. I found doing two different runs in the same afternoon with just a little rest particularly useful practice for a longer run. I regularly did it for SH team, for OU in the varsity match against CU, and for the IS in the IS Championships. Two times, when my team needed me, I ran long distances in a big race. Luckily, I could rest for a few hours in between.\n\nI liked these challenges--especially when we won--and I didn't mind doing extra. But, of course, I wouldn't be as happy if my team didn't try hard too or if my hard work didn't help us win.\n\nTeam leaders always want more, but it's not possible to do this much every week. So, sometimes, I had to say no. And when some team leaders wouldn't accept my no, things sometimes got hard. And some people thought that I didn't like being part of a team.\n\nThat's not fair! Well, you can't make everyone happy all the time!\n\nYou'll have even more trouble if you're sick or hurt and your team still wants you to race. The best thing to do is to say no, but that's easier said than done. When I was 20, I gave in to this pressure and had to run in a race even though I was clearly not feeling well.\n\n'Oh, you'll still do better than our backup runner', was what our team leader said.\n\nThat was right, but it wasn't the main thing. He should have been taking care of his young runner, not putting his health at risk.\n\nSure enough, I managed to finish the race but came in fourth place. But I ended up in bed for two weeks with a bad sickness, and I had to take a break for the rest of the season. Benjamin was really mad. I learned my lesson and tried not to make the same mistake again. And I tell you to avoid it, too. Don't run when you're sick. You'll just slow yourself down.\n\nYour friendship with your group should be good for both sides. Give all you can. But also, take from your group what's good for you. Stay away from the problems. Don't give up your own progress just for the group. You have to find a balance.\n\nI am sure I would not have become the runner I did if I had not joined SH team. It was through the team that I met Benjamin, whose teaching helped me a lot in the early stages of my running. It was the team and Benjamin's group--and David in particular--who inspired a whole bunch of kids, both in the team and outside, to run fast and happy, with joy.\n\nI was three years younger than David, and we were usual practice partners for a few years. What a great chance it was for a young runner to talk to, learn from, and practice with one of the best runners of the day. He was a daring leader who always tried to be the best. He made running fun and exciting again. I got to see how he trained. I even tried to keep up with him. And I was there when he was getting ready to set a new world record. What a time!\n\nBut, he wasn't always a good role model. Back then, he was like the naughtiest boy in school, always staying up late and waking up early. But no matter how late he stayed up, he would still be up early the next day to train. He made training fun.\n\nThe Running Club was a great place to be. Everyone aimed high and worked hard. Once, a magazine asked me what my goal was. I didn't say I wanted to win a gold medal. I said I wanted to set new records for the club's long races. To me, that was just as important, because our club's records were even better than the ones at the Big Games!\n\nRecords can really motivate you. In my first year at school, my goal was not only to win the big race, but also to beat the old record, set by a former champion named Bruce. In my time as a runner, I wanted to set records for running fast and far.\n\nI'm happy to say that I did it! I set records that are still here today. But I really hope they can inspire boys and girls in other cities and clubs. That's the fun of records - they're made to be broken!\n\nAs for my running club, I did set a record for running really fast. But, sadly, I didn't set a record for running really far. That's okay though, because I was still pretty fast! Our club is special because we have 2 people who are some of the fastest in the country. That's still true even 30 years later.\n\nI loved being part of these clubs. I had fun, laughed a lot, and enjoyed being with friends who helped me do my best. In the clubs, I found friends who understood why I loved to run and what it took to be good at it. Don't forget about your friends during long runs. They inspire you, and you respect each other. That's friendship!\n\nYou can have this too. Have you heard about being alone when you run for a long time? You can avoid that! Join a group!\n\n##### THINGS TO REMEMBER\n\n- Joining a group has many good things--like coaching, motivation, learning new things, and making friends. Being in a group will make your running better.\n\n- Running as part of a group, no matter how good you are, helps you want to run more and inspires you more than running alone. This helps you try your best and find out what you can do.\n\n- Run for your group's good, but also for yours: Don't run a race every week, even if you feel like you have to. And don't run a race if you're hurt or sick.\n\n- If your group is not good at planning different types of runs, choose what's best for you, or start planning some runs yourself. Go on the group's long runs on Sunday, for example. And use the group to find people to run with.\n[PART  \nII](contents.html#rpart02)\n\nMAKING THE KNIFE SHARP\n\nNow you've made a start you can build on--one that includes running the right way and running fast. You're doing different kinds of runs every week, each with a specific goal in mind. The job now is to put it all together and do better in a race than you've ever done before.\n\nThis will need the addition of some fast exercises. They will be more organized than playful runs. These will include time-based repeats, done in a step-by-step way over some time. It will include some hill runs and off-road running to help you get stronger and tougher, and some faster time-based exercises either run on streets, grass or even better, a running field. It will include different training at different times of the year. It will also include learning to slow down your training in a way that leaves you rested but not lazy on the race day.\n\nAnd a lot of it will need getting the most out of yourself in your mind. That's going to be different for every runner. But there are ways to train your brain, to find out that you can do more than you thought, to believe without doubt that you can perform much better than anything you've done in training. And that belief might be the most important part of all.\n\nSo cheers to that race you never thought you could run. Because I know it's inside you.\n\n#### Part 8\n\n#### The Highs and Lows of Running\n\nRunners are naturally very competitive. Whether they've reached town, national, or even world level, they all seem to know where they stand in the ranking order.\n\nWhen I was at my best, in the late 20th century, there were several guys like Charlie whom we respected as great folks and good runners but didn't think to be a big challenge. They weren't quite like us. And I think Cameron would agree--he wasn't getting the things he wanted, and he was not quick enough to bother the likes of Mike, Dave, Steve, Nick, Ben, or me. We won against him over and over again.\n\nCameron was a pharmacist's son from a coal mining place in the NE corner of FR country. As he talks about in his book, _From Last to First_ --a great book, for everyone and runners too--he was not a good student, had issues with his eyes, and wasn't usually near the best at anything he tried.\n\nEven though he found out almost by surprise that he was good at long running, he was still not really in the top group. In a time long ago, when his team-mate Ben won the big running race at PH place, Cameron came 39th. Four years later, when I won the big race on the same place, Cameron came 56th, five minutes after I finished. It's fair to say that he didn't like running in the mud--he liked the hard roads--but still, that's not even close.\n\nBut at the big sports event in LA city in the past, Cameron won against some of the quickest runners in the world, including the AU country Rob, the best runner, to win a medal in the long run.\n\nNo matter what we thought of him, Cameron was the one who won the big sports event. He deserved it because he did his best when he needed to. He didn't just get lucky. He had won a big race in LO city earlier that year and came second the next year. My good friend and race buddy, Samuel, came first that time. Samuel comes from a place called WA country. Cameron ran his best time ever in that race. Even now, many years later, Cameron still holds the record for the best time in his home country.\n\nCameron got better and better at running over time. This shows how determined he was and how much he believed in himself. He changed how he thought about things. He stopped thinking things that held him back and started thinking things that let him use all the skill he believed he had. His story can inspire others.\n\nBut there was something else that helped him a lot - running up and down hills.\n\n##### HILLS ARE YOUR FRIENDS\n\nA famous cyclist named Adam said this, and it's just as true for runners. When Cameron decided to try even harder to do well, despite not doing as well as he wanted for many years, he moved to BO city. There, he started running with a group of other runners. One of them was Gabriel, who won two big races in CH city and BO city. The group liked to run up and down hills. Since Cameron was part of the group, he started doing this too. A group often visited a spot called Pump House Hill. It was a quick run up, and they would run up it many times in a row, week after week.\n\nCharlie did not enjoy hills and like many runners, he chose not to run them. He admits, his running style was not the best. His steps were too big to get him up the hill quickly. But he learned to take smaller steps--like changing to a stronger gear--for more strength. Most importantly, he became stronger--both in body and mind. He got fitter and more confident.\n\nAfter the hot season of 1981 practicing and racing in the US, he went back to England, and later he joined the PA-to-VE road race in FR country. The race starts near a big tower and runs near the river on its way to VE, a grand castle built in the old times by a king.\n\nI had won that race the year before. The castle is lovely, but I can tell you from what I know, the race has one big hill to climb as it leaves PA. When Charlie reached that part of the race, he remembered all the hill runs he had done in the US. Mr. Hill, he knew, was now his friend. He pushed on hard--and won the race. A place named Pump House Hill made magic happen.\n\nWhat helped Adam can also help you do better, no matter where you start. Running up and down hills may not win you a big prize, but it can make you stronger and last longer. That's what Adam wanted for himself, and it works for anyone, no matter how fast or slow they run.\n\nDo you want to run faster, from 48 minutes to 46? Or even under 45 or your first time under 40? Include running up and down hills in your weekly plan for most of the year. You may run less than if you just did a steady run, but you will run faster.\n\n'Hills are like a hidden way to run faster', the runner Frank once said. Like Adam, he is known mainly for his long-distance running, having won a big prize once and a smaller one another time. But he did know a thing or two about running fast: He won the AM country short-distance race once, and the longer-distance race five times. I agree that hills help with running faster. In simple words, if you want to run fast for a long time, you need to be strong. Even when you're very tired, you need to keep your speed up.\n\nRunning up and down hills again and again will make you stronger. When you run up a hill, you have to push your body up and lift your own weight. This is just like lifting heavy things again and again. It makes your muscles stronger. You also get better at dealing with being very tired.\n\nRunning up hills also helps you in other ways. When you run up a hill, you have to lift your knees and push off your toes. This can make your legs stretch and help you run better. So running up hills can also make you better at running and more flexible.\n\nAnd running up hills can make your legs stronger and make you able to run for a longer time in three different ways.\n\nFirst, it can make you able to run hard without getting too tired. If you can run fast without getting tired, you'll be able to run for longer. Second, it will help you recover faster. When you're running, you need to be able to get your strength back fast after every hill while still running fast. Also, they help you get better at doing things even when your muscles start to feel tired. \n\nHills are good for running longer and faster because they make you work harder than you thought you could. This is a strange thing, but new or medium-level runners often do not push themselves as hard as they should on flat ground. It's a normal feeling--five minutes after finishing a race, for example--for runners to feel quite good and wonder why they hadn't been able to run faster in the race.\n\nIn a way, they are not strong enough to push themselves to the limit on flat ground. But make them run up a hill for a little more than a minute and they'll feel--and react--very differently. The hill helps them to discover how hard they can run once they start to feel tired, especially if the exercise makes them repeat the effort five or six times. They learn how much they can push themselves. It forces them to work harder than they thought possible. Because of that, they're getting better at running when they're out of breath and dealing with the tiredness in their muscles, and to recover, too. So the exercise effect is much better. Having discovered how hard they can work on the hills, they should have the confidence to run equally hard on the flat. But it's not so simple. On a flat path, without much pull from the ground, you have to run really fast before you're working your hardest. Other things like tummy strength, leg power, and how you run can often affect you before you reach this hard work.\n\nAnd as I said in chapter 1, when we talked about things that limit us, _speed_ is affected by all the other things. Because running up and down hills makes all of these better, it will make your speed better. In this way, Frank was completely correct.\n\nI know that many runners don't want to start running up and down hills. They think that kind of training is too hard or too boring. Maybe, after running up a hill, they don't want to turn around and run down again: They're trying to get somewhere and it seems strange to them to stop and do it all over and over again. Or maybe after getting to the top, they'd rather just keep going and enjoy the view.\n\n'Running at the same speed around a hilly track is enough hill training for me, thank you very much!' they say.\n\nBut helpful as that type of training is, it's not specific enough to really give all of the good things I've just talked about. You need more organized training with a set number of timed runs over set distances and with set rest times.\n\nThere's no doubt that hill training can be hard and make you tired. You don't want to do too much of it. Your legs can be tired after and your body might need time to feel better, so you shouldn't do a big hill exercise just before a run. You want to be smart about it.\n\nBut if hills are hard, they can also be fun. There's a feeling of doing something good when you do what you planned to do, when you find out you can do more than you thought, and when you can run a race stronger than before. Hills will make you feel brave and strong in your mind, helping you do better against the other things that can stop you-- _how you think_.\n\nSo I say they're very good. They help a lot.\n\nStart slowly, like you would with any new thing, like lifting weights or running on a track. Do it bit by bit; get to know it before you make it really hard. This is one time when something to check your heart-rate might be helpful. You can use it to make sure you're not running too hard when you're still getting started.\n\nIf you've never run hills in a planned way, the best way to start is to run many short ones, maybe 10 or 12 times for 30 seconds up a hill that's not too high, walking back down in between.\n\nAlso, get used to running on hilly paths: Run hard and fast up each hill and then run slow to the next one. A very good idea would be to try some cross country races. This type of running, maybe over bumpy ground or sticky mud, can help you get stronger and run for longer. This is great for when you want to run up and down big hills.\n\nI remember the mud and hills from running races, especially at a place we'll call \"PA park\", in a big city. Running on ground like this would make you stronger all over. Or at least you sure hoped it did, because of how tired you felt during the race and for a long time after. All parts of your legs would be sore--your upper leg muscles from pulling your feet out of the mud, as well as your lower legs and the muscles on the inside of your thighs. Even your arms would feel tired and heavy. And your tummy? Well, it felt like you'd been squished! This kind of running is terrific for your tummy muscles and core strength, the important parts that help you move your arms and legs. The ground's not even; you have to keep from falling; you might trip a little; you have to jump over ditches here and there, maybe one foot gets stuck in the mud more than the other, and you're working to stay upright and keep a steady pace.\n\nThat core strength will help you as a runner in general. It will help you when you run up and down hills over and over, where you really do have to lift your knees up--and use your tummy muscles and core to do it.\n\nTraining on this type of ground, whether with regular runs or varied pace runs, will get you used to running up and down hills while staying calm, and catching your breath off the tops of the hills without needing to stop for a rest--which, of course, is like what you'll experience in races.\n\nBut soon, you might want to do more organized hill exercises, like timed repeats. Timing them is very important. It encourages you and gives you feedback. You can see if your 10th repeat was as fast as your first--which is the goal--or if you didn't pace yourself well. You might be surprised: Even if you felt bad, you might have done the last repeat as fast as you wanted to. Then you think, 'Given how I felt, that was really great!'\n\nIt's also good to know if you were truly as slow as you felt. You can change your exercise next time, adjusting your speed so you can keep it up for the desired number of repeats.\n\nTiming the repeats also lets you see your progress. Keep a diary. If you look back and see that you're doing the same hill four seconds faster than before, that increases your confidence. It's a way of working on your mental strength, which can help you reach higher levels, as it did for Cameron.\n\nHere are some exercises to get you started, though there are countless possible variations. Hill repeats are often best on fast surfaces, like roads: You need a good surface to run really fast and maintain good form.\n\nAs you do your regular runs, keep an eye out for different hills, grounds, and slopes. Change your running game on hills to become better at what you do--to make your weak spots stronger, and to fit what you want to do and the time of the year. Simply saying, for lasting longer you want to mix long, slow runs and many more runs with short breaks. For strength, run faster on longer or steeper hills with different break times. And for power, do less but very fast--and sometimes steep--runs at your fastest speed. It depends on the time of the year, but sometimes, to change things up, you might want to focus specifically on strength by doing repeats of running up stairs, maybe in a stadium or on sandy hills.\n\n##### RUNNING ON HILLS FOR STRENGTH AND LASTING LONGER\n\nThese strength and lasting longer sessions are usually good for early to middle winter if you plan to do a lot of your races in the summer.\n\n- Short hills: lots of repeats over short spaces, with slow running back down. One way to do it: two sets of ten 30-second runs, going quite fast up the hill and running down quickly, as well.\n\n- Medium to long hills: fewer repeats with longer breaks. One way with medium hills: Six to eight 90-second runs up the hill with slow run back down. One way with long hills: Four to six three-minute runs, which get very hard toward the end. Again, slow run back down for nice long rests.\n\n- Repeatedly running over a small, bumpy path that includes going up and down two or three times, maybe doing four rounds of four-minute runs around the path, with three minutes rest in between.\n\n- Keep running up and down around a small path on the side of a very big hill. Each round might take only 20 to 30 seconds. The goal is to do as many rounds as possible in a set time--four minutes, for example, or even up to 10 minutes. How fast you run is not important in this game. The hill should be so big that your goal is simply to keep running and not start walking. This is also a good game to try on sandy hills.\n\nBeing strong and having lots of energy aren't the only things you will need to run your best. Luckily, hill running can help you with other parts of your running, as well.\n\n##### HILL GAMES FOR SPEED AND POWER\n\nIn spring, as the summer games season gets closer, you can use hill running to get faster and stronger.\n\n- Run up and down less short or medium hills, run faster than before. As you do these runs, make sure you move your arms, moving forward with your knees high, fully stretching your back leg, and standing tall on your toes. (Note that the long hills talked about earlier are less suitable for speed games, unless you change them, maybe by changing speed and running very fast the last 30 seconds--either before you reach the top or after you've gone past the top.)\n\n- A short hill exercise for speed and power: do four groups of four quick 30-second runs up a small hill. Take a rest by slowly running or walking back. Rest for three minutes between groups.\n\n- A medium hill exercise for speed and power: do two groups of three quick 90-second runs up a medium hill. Take a rest by slowly running back. Rest for three minutes between groups.\n\nRunning up hills can make you very tired. This is what helps you get stronger. You may see fast runners on the track using a belt and pulling heavy wheels behind them, or even fighting against another person's strength. On a hill, the hard part is going against gravity. And this lets you get fitter than you can with your normal friendly runs--no matter how many you do or how far you go.\n\n##### DIFFERENT TYPES OF EXERCISES\n\nBut this can also make it easy to do too much. Choose the steepness, length, and type of your hill carefully for the exercise you want to do. You'll probably want a rest day afterwards. That means an easy run, walk, or swim, not a day doing nothing. And remember that one of the goals of any exercise is to make sure you are fit and ready to exercise again. You want to work very hard but you don't want to get tired of it. So you've heard that the runner from NZ country named Peter ran two-minute reps up a hill with (supposedly) a steepness of one in three--which, believe me, is quite steep. Yes, he won three big races and set five records. But that doesn't mean you should do the same. Adam was a very strong runner. You need to make the games easy for _you_.\n\nYou can run some longer hill games, though, and they'll help you if you're trying to get ready for a long race, like a big race. The problem with longer games is that it takes so much time to walk back to the bottom that you get more rest than is best. But there's a way to fix that. Find a hill that's Adam's size or even bigger, and run it in parts.\n\nBenjamin, for all his adventures, was not a great hill runner. His records were all on flat land, of course--on the path--but he ran some big hills on his way to setting them. Everyone knows, he used the RV road, a long hill just west of SH city, to do long hill games.\n\nOne of his games was six times half a distance. His dad would follow him up this long hill in the car, because everything was timed and measured. Benjamin would run a distance fast and then, instead of walking back down, he'd have a timed rest right where he was, and then run another half distance up the hill, until he'd run the six half-distance efforts.\n\nHere's a simple way to do it: Don't think, 'I have a big hill, so I need to go from the bottom to the top all at once.' You can think more creatively and find a pattern that works for you.\n\nHere's a helpful way to practice on long hills: Find a hill that takes about two minutes to run up. Run hard to the top, jog back for only half a minute or so, then turn around and run fast back to the top, probably in about 20 seconds. That's one round. Then jog all the way back down to the bottom and do five more rounds of one long and one short hill. Over time, you might do just four rounds but each round made up of one long and two short hills.\n\nThis way of practice has a few advantages. You do a long hill but only give yourself a short rest before starting up again on your fast run. You feel the same way you feel in a race--you're tired, and you have to run fast. But the fast run is much shorter than the full effort, and you'll find that you had more energy left than you thought.\n\n'Wow', you think, 'that's not so tough.' You can still run fast--even when you're tired! The reason is that you're using a different energy system, and you can--especially if it's just for a short time.\n\nThis gets you excited, and then you get a long rest as you walk all the way down. When you get there and start the quick walk again, you'll probably feel the speed is slow. And so you start to believe that you can actually go a bit quicker and still feel it's an easy speed.\n\nThere are many different ways to walk on hills, so try them out. I think you need one planned hill walk each week, all the time. But don't do the same walk again and again. Make sure the walks are right for your goals at that time. And use them to learn as much as you can. In other words, don't just do the ones you find most easy. Remember a few things as you try different ways: Plan your walks to reach certain goals. And try as often as you can to copy situations you'll face in a game.\n\nThis lets you practice changing speed. You're going to have to change from the short step you've used to power up the hill to the long step you need to walk quicker.\n\nIt also lets you practice resting without stopping, since there's no stopping in a game. You have to beat that feeling of wanting to stop to catch your breath. You _will_ rest as the land gets flat, but not right away. It's a late reaction. Go with the flow, and you'll learn not to let the hill push you, and how to get back into your walk quickly. It comes down to how fast you walk and how you choose--in other words, your rhythm.\n\nIt's important that you choose hills that are easy for you, not just the tallest hills you can find, and that you learn to judge your effort, based on how fast you breathe rather than how fast your heart beats, so that you are walking up the hill at a steady rate. If your breathing starts to feel too much, you're going too fast, so slow down a bit, keeping the same rhythm, just as you would if riding up a hill. But don't be scared of breathing fast--as long as it feels okay and steady, there's nothing wrong, and you're not going to get hurt!\n\nWalking strongly after you reach the top of hills is a great way to move forward in field and road races. Often, there is little difference between the speeds at which different racers walk up hills. It takes a lot of extra work for someone to move even a little bit ahead.\n\nBut at the top, with practice and a bit of will, you can often turn a 10-step gap into a 50-step gap, or even more. Practicing walking strongly after you reach the top of the hill can help a lot in developing this skill for races.\n\nAnother good way to practice on hill walks is to change speed halfway up. You may run up a bit at a lot of effort, then run as fast as you can for the last part. This helps with knowing how fast to go. It also keeps your feet quick, even when you're running up a hill.\n\nRemember: Don't be slow! No matter how tall or steep the hill is. I always try to get people to run with quick feet, even if they're getting ready for a long run. The important thing is to keep your feet light and keep going. Your _arms_ , not your legs, are in charge. These runs will teach you to be okay with being tired and having heavy legs. And one way to be okay is by taking smaller steps. Having trouble getting up the hill with big steps? Don't try. You want to be fast all the way up and make sure you can run strong at the top. Move your arms quickly and your legs will do the same.\n\n##### RUNNING HILLS CAN BE FUN\n\nSometimes people don't like to run hills because they like to run with friends, and they think they can only run hills with people who run the same speed. That's not true. It might take a little planning, but running hills can be a good way for runners of different speeds to run together.\n\nHere's one way to play a hill game for kids of different speeds: Starting together, everyone runs up the hill until the quickest one reaches the top. At that point the quickest kid signals and everyone stops. They mark how far up the hill they got, and that point becomes their goal for the rest of the game. All kids regroup on the walk back down, and all kids start the next round together, so the times of the runs and the rest periods stay the same for the whole group.\n\nAnother way is to play the hill game as a fun race, where the quickest kid starts at the bottom of the hill, and slower kids start at various points up it. They all start at the same time and, hopefully, they all reach the top very close together. This game has big benefits for quicker and slower kids alike; the quicker kids have friends to chase the whole way up, while the slower kids enjoy the feeling of being in front for most if not all of the round. By the time they do get passed, they've got a good chance of matching the quicker kids' speed for the last few steps.\n\nIf you have a group of kids who aren't so quick, and one kid who's really fast, you might have everyone run to the top of the hill--but the fast kid has to run off the top another 50 or 100 steps.\n\nThere are lots of ways of making the quicker kids run more while still keeping a group of different speeds together. Everyone can learn and help each other while having fun. This is one of the best parts of exercising together, whether going up hills or on flat ground. Exercising alone can be harder, so it's good to find ways to make it fun with friends.\n\nEven though hills are tough, running up hills is not just about working hard. You should always try to run in a good way. This means standing tall, feeling relaxed and keeping your balance. You need to let your shoulders be loose, lift your knees high and push hard with your back foot. How strong and fast you run changes based on how steep and long the hill is. But if you feel like you can't keep good form, it means you're working too hard. You might be doing too many exercises, or the exercises are too long, or the hill is too steep, or you're not resting enough in between. Change your exercises if needed. You want to work hard, sometimes very hard, but you also want to keep a good form while doing so.\n\nRunning up hills can also make you more flexible. If you keep a good form while running fast, you'll be moving as much as you can and this can make you more flexible. And the opposite is also true: If you stretch often and work on being flexible, you'll find it easier to run faster while staying relaxed--even when running up a long hill.\n\nJust like in any game, you can get hurt while running up and down hills. But the bigger danger is when you are jogging down the hill. It's hard to relax and move down the hill smoothly. You might think it's easier to move down slowly. But don't do this. If you move down too slowly, you can hurt your knees, your hips, your back, and your legs. Try to move quickly and lightly, not so you go fast but so you don't hurt yourself with each step.\n\nRunning up hills again and again can be hard, and can also be dangerous if you're not used to it. The best way to start is slowly, giving your body time to get used to it.\n\nOne of the best ways to stay safe is to practice running hills often. It doesn't always have to be very hard. But you can do this almost all year round. By doing this, you'll get better at it, and it will be easier to do harder runs when the time comes.\n\nSo that's all there is to running hills, right? Well, some people would think so. I once believed something was true.\n\nBut as a growing sportsperson, I remember talking with one of my competitors, a boy named David. He was a strong, tough player with a small step and a quick pace, who later won two big competitions and two important medals. On one of our journeys, I asked him if he trained on hills.\n\n'No, not really on hills', he said. 'But I sometimes run down hills.'\n\nI thought that David was either hiding something or he was a bit silly. I thought, ' _Downhill_? How's that going to help you?' You have to run uphill to become stronger--and usually the bigger the hill the better.\n\nBut, thinking about it, David knew something I didn't. Running uphill is great for staying power, strength, and energy. But none of them really help make your legs move faster because you're always struggling against gravity.\n\nRunning downhill, though, makes you feel like you're falling, which makes you move your legs faster. It allows you to run quicker and, more importantly, with faster leg speed. It's a lot like when a cyclist rides behind a fast car. Instead of working on the push phase, as in running uphill, running downhill makes your legs strong enough to keep you from falling, even when you're running at faster speeds than usual.\n\nEven though it's easier to run downhill, it still makes you stronger. Think about hill runners. Some people who live in places with lots of hills and mountains do a special kind of running up and down them. This is very popular in hilly areas. Hill runners are very good at running downhill. In fact, that's usually where they win or lose their races. The best runners don't just run down--they jump off the hilltops. They're very strong, and this strength lets them run down hills without hurting themselves.\n\nIf you try to run fast down a hill, you'll see that you need a lot of strength in your legs. One of my friends, Jack, started hill running. After a couple of years, he became so good that his legs got a lot stronger. He even needed new pants because his old ones didn't fit anymore.\n\nIf you're not very strong or your legs are sore when you start running down a hill, it feels like you have to slow down with each step. But, maybe when you're almost at the bottom, as the hill gets less steep, you'll feel like you can stop slowing down and just let yourself run. Suddenly, you're running faster and it feels easier.\n\nThe stronger you get, the higher up the hill you can do this, and the steeper the hill you'll be able to run down. When you are very strong, you can let go and fly down the hill, fully relaxed, and let gravity help you for once. In my opinion, if you can run downhill like that, it shows you are very fit, strong, and ready to run fast.\n\nKnowing how to run downhill fast in races can give you a big advantage. We've already seen that people who push hard uphill are likely to gain only a little advantage. The downhills are just the opposite, as the hill runners show. Other people will be just walking carefully down the hills, running at a normal speed. But, having practiced it, you can relax and flow down the hill and quickly make big gaps. Practice doing this whenever you can on downhill parts of your normal runs and quick run games.\n\nThis is hard when you're tired or it's steep. But try not to stop--don't lean back, and don't land stiffly with straight legs--and relax your arms and shoulders, using your arms for balance rather than power.\n\n##### HILL DOWN SESSIONS\n\nFor hill down sessions, pick a small slope on a soft, forgiving ground: You want to be able to handle the extra speed without falling hard on your heels and hurting your legs, hips, and back. You want to feel that you're running fast and relaxed. It's almost a game--you _have_ to move your legs faster than usual to avoid falling on your face.\n\nIf you notice your feet landing with a thump or feel like you're leaning back, you can tell you're resisting gravity and stopping yourself. Try not to do this. Either change how you're doing it or find a less steep slope.\n\nWhen you're moving downhill on a little slope, you should be able to keep a strong style of running, moving your arms a lot and taking each step with a bent knee and a strong push off the tips of your back foot. You're pushing ahead, not holding back. Down steeper slopes, just let gravity help you--all you have to do is not stop yourself!\n\nTry to get used to moving quickly and comfortably downhill on your regular runs all through the year. I wouldn't usually suggest doing specific downhill activities, except for the following two _to be done on a very slight slope_.\n\n##### Harder Activity for the Pre-Race Time\n\nFor a week without a race, when you want a harder activity that still includes some downhill try 6 times of 40 seconds fast and relaxed downhill at almost full effort, followed by 20 seconds rest, then a run back up the hill to your start point at full effort, trying (but probably just failing) to match the 40-second time. Rest for a full 3 or 4 minutes between each time.\n\n##### Easier Activity\n\nFor an easier downhill activity that would be perfect three or four days before a race try 8 to 10 times 30 seconds fast and relaxed down a slight slope with a jog back recovery.\n\nRemember, practice times before a big race are not as important as how you feel. Only your race times matter. Your practice should help you perform well on race day. It's better to run a bit slower with good technique than to run fast and out of control.\n\nHills may seem scary. They need effort. Maybe I've told you a lot. But remember, most of these practices take less time than your usual runs but give you more benefits. And they can make you feel more refreshed (and less sleepy) than all your long runs. Really the only scary thing about hills is starting. As Frank said, 'The only thing we need to fear is fear itself!'\n\nSo remember these important things: less time, fewer miles, more strength, better technique, better fitness, more variety, and more challenges. Be better than those who only jog. You're going to be smarter and practice running fast. It all adds up to more fun! Start, and you'll learn, like Charlie did, that Mr. Hill can be your friend.\n\n##### IMPORTANT THINGS TO REMEMBER\n\n- Add some hill running to your playtime for most of the year. You might run less than with another steady run, but you'll run faster.\n\n- Hill running can make you faster, stronger, have more energy, and become better at running. It helps with feeling good too. Which means it can help you run better a lot.\n\n- If you've never run up and down hills, start by running on a path with lots of hills. Join some running games. This kind of running makes you strong and gives you the energy you need for some serious hill running.\n\n- Run long, steady runs uphill for energy; many more shorter but faster runs for strength; and fewer short but very steep runs at top speed for power.\n\n- Sometimes run down hills on a gentle slope to make your legs move faster.\n\n#### Chapter 9\n\n#### Strength in the Grass\n\nA long time ago. PH park.\n\nDavid had just won the Big Running Game when a whisper started among the crowd.\n\nI'd won the young kid's race earlier in the day, then stayed around to watch David run with the big kids. After his win--by a lot of time--a whisper started spreading fast: David's going to run the junior race, as well! He's going for two wins!\n\n'Show off', some people said, 'Serves him right if he fails.'\n\nIn fact, Benjamin was hoping for three wins for our coach, Adam, and the overall team win for our club, SH club.\n\nDavid was only 20, so he was still considered a young one. But he'd already run nine miles over the challenging, tough land of PH hill--the same place where I would win the EN race some years later. The young one's race would be another six miles. And there were only 20 minutes between the end of one race and the beginning of the next--barely time enough for him to get his new number and line up at the start.\n\nHe did it, though. And won it. In his life story, he said his victory in that second race was mostly due to his strong reputation and a bit of pretend--trickery, as we called it. If anyone really challenged him, he wrote, he might have given up. Instead, he said, even the best of the other runners stayed a good distance behind.\n\nWell, there's probably some truth to that. David did like to scare people. And he was good at trickery. I remember him arriving at races in other places, when all the runners would meet up at the hotel, mix and ask each other how they were doing and how their training was going.\n\nAnd David would say, 'Oh, I'm in great shape. I slowed down a bit last week and just did 140.' There was a boy named David who was very good at running long distances. He once told the other runners that the race was very long. This made the other runners feel scared even before the race started.\n\nDuring one of the races, the other runners were scared of David, for sure. But he faced some challenges too. He wasn't leading the race in the beginning, especially during the long hill climb which was very difficult. In fact, he wasn't even among the top 50 runners at first. The other boys were trying their best.\n\nBut David quickly found his pace, running smoothly while the others were finding it difficult to run through the mud and over the small ditches. By the time he finished the first half of the race, he was already leading and kept increasing his lead. In the end, David won the race by a very big margin.\n\nEveryone knew that David was very clever. But he had much more than that. He was simply the best runner during those times because he was able to keep running no matter how difficult the track was - over hills, through mud, jumping over obstacles, and more.\n\nDavid was very strong, both mentally and physically. This helped him in running races. But I think running races also helped him become stronger.\n\nWe all know little ones are not as strong today as they were a little while ago. There's not enough climbing trees, not enough jumping around outside, and most certainly not enough running in fields, especially at schools. This may be partly because people are worried about their safety--the course would probably involve going outside the school gates (what a scary thought!). And partly because schools almost spoil the kids by offering a lot of other usually far less hard games, which, human nature being what it is, sound far more fun. Not many little ones are going to choose a long field run over a game of catch, hitting a ball with a stick, throwing a ball over a net, or basket game--let alone boat play, shooting arrows or target practice, or even a spot of dance. Nothing against these great games and activities, but they aren't in themselves going to use up many treats or do much for the kids' energy. Wouldn't it be better to run for a little while as well, either before or after?\n\nBut how do you make this run fun? Too often the thinking is that field running is too hard or too boring--or worse still, a punishment.\n\nTo make field running fun, little ones need to be given good reasons for doing the sport, which involves fun, speed, overtaking, jumping over little streams and puddles, and _racing_! Little ones love to compete, but it does get boring if the races always have the same result, with the same people winning all the time. The answer is in making fun games with many small races, team races, and races where slower children are given a chance to try their best. Sometimes this can be done by giving them shortcuts or by putting them on teams with quicker runners. From here, the more skilled kids should be introduced to real races--but they need to know how to get ready, not just thrown into the challenge. They need to know what clothes and shoes to wear, how to warm up, how quick to start, how to keep their speed, and how to keep going when they're out of breath. They need to be sure they can work hard, get out of breath, and still keep racing.\n\nOften, I see children put into races at the last minute, not ready and wearing the wrong clothes. Of course, they're scared; they start off too fast, slow down after a minute or two, and have a really bad time that makes them not like running for good.\n\nWould the schools throw a child into the water and tell them to swim before they'd even taught them how? Of course not. It's the same with running.\n\nTeach these children the basic skills of the sport and they will find it a lot of fun. Not only that, but it will also help build the fitness and energy needed for almost any other sport they want to try and start to develop the mental strength and ability to keep going that will help them with the many challenges they will face in life.\n\nKids who aren't strong grow up to be grown-ups who aren't strong. You see this in sports: just look at the not so good games of many countries' top runners in the last few years. You also see this in normal life, like when the fitness needed to be a police officer or soldier is not as high as before.\n\nOne newspaper in BE country recently said that police trainers were seeing a lot of new people failing simple fitness tests.\n\nAnd it's not just in BE country. As a paper in the US country said, 'The bellies of AM city's kids are getting bigger, making fewer of them able to join the US country's army.' So guess what? The US country's Army has started a special program for bigger people who want to join, thinking they can get fit after they join.\n\nBetter late than never, right?\n\nAnd this is true for running in the field, too. It's definitely easier to run in the field as a kid, when you're younger and lighter. But that's no reason to avoid it when you're a grown-up, especially if you're trying to run better overall. I hope I've made you believe that a bit of running in the field will be good for you. And I hope, too, I've made you believe it will be fun.\n\nAnd not only training--there's no reason to avoid racing in the field, either. Racing outside is a lot more fun than racing on a track or on the streets. When you race on a track or street, everything is the same. The ground doesn't change, and you keep the same pace--it's like running in one place. And if someone gets ahead of you, it's really hard to catch up.\n\nBut when you race outside, it's different for everyone. You have to change how you run based on the ground and the weather. Sometimes you might slip, sometimes you might need to pull your legs out of thick, sticky mud, and sometimes you might need to jump over little streams or ditches. Some people handle the mud better than others, some like running uphill, some like running downhill. Yes, some places are a bit flat and dull, but in real outside races, the ground is always different, fun, and a bit hard. Often, you can choose your own way. You can go through the puddle or around it. You can jump over a ditch this way or that way. You can run through the mud in a straight line or try to find a way around it. Some people can get a better hold on the ground than others. Then there's all the beautiful things you can see, the sounds, the weather, and the feeling. It's just nice to be away from streets and cars, either in quiet places or with the sound of people cheering for you and telling you to keep going.\n\nSo find your happy child-like feelings and go play!\n\nThat was a special day, when Benjamin won twice. It made me want to try doing that--even if not as much--many times. If you were strong enough, doing two things could be a fun test. And it was a way for me to help my team, too.\n\nLater that year, in the southern sports contest for young people, I won the short race and the long race on the same weekend.\n\nAnd the next year I was still young, and this time both races were planned for the same afternoon. Could I still win them both with just a little time between them? I'm happy to say I did it again, but it would have been easier if there was only a short time between the races. Having a longer break meant getting ready a second time, and on the second time getting ready I can remember feeling not very good and not sure that it was a good idea!\n\nAs a student at OL school, I started doing a similar two races--the short race and the longer race--at the yearly school contest against CA school, and then often kept doing this when representing the AI team in the Inter Team Championships. With only a short time between, it was much easier, and I found this double was very good long race preparation. David had shown me that all you needed to do was get ready for the second race and the other team could be scared and would only run for second place.\n\nIn two big races--like soccer games for running--I ran two long races on the same day. No one else had tried that before, and I'm not sure if anyone has after. Both times, I won the first long race, but not the second one. It's hard to run fast in the second race after the first longer one. But I think I came third in the second race, which was good for the team.\n\nThese races were on a track. And that's the big thing: One way you get strong enough to run these races--and to run well on the track--is from running in the countryside.\n\nRunning in the countryside might mean running through mud and running a bit slower than you usually would. But it makes you very fit and tough which will help you a lot when you run on quicker ground.\n\nYou'll probably be doing these quick runs in the winter, when it's colder--not the best time for running fast. And the countryside is not the quickest place to run, by any means. So for your runs in spikes, it's best to focus not on faster runs but on longer ones--maybe six times 1K or four times a mile or maybe 16 times running for one minute.\n\nOf course you'll want to do these runs on ground that's good for spikes, because spikes grip better in muddy conditions. Playing fields, forest paths, and parks are great for running. If it's not too muddy and slippery, regular shoes work well.\n\nCross country running also means knowing how to choose the best path and make your way through many runners. There are little parts in a cross country race where you can move ahead of others, not by running harder but by jumping better, getting to a gate or corner first, avoiding a muddy spot by running a bit more, or by going straight through a puddle instead of around it. Often, you can catch up to someone without extra work, just because they got stuck in the mud or didn't jump well over a ditch--or even slipped! You can do better than others by being smart, planning ahead and stepping in just the right spots. This adds something extra you don't get when you run on roads.\n\nThat said, you want the course to be easy to run. You don't want it to be so tough that all you can do is walk. Running over frozen ground, where you're more likely to hurt your ankle than run fast, is even worse, and something to avoid. But in most races, there should be places along the course where you can run fast. If there's a big patch of muddy ground on the path--it's okay. Just keep moving!\n\nIf you want to run in some races in the fields, you will need some extra things, especially shoes. The best shoes for these races are special field running shoes, which usually have little grips and a little soft part at the back. But these shoes are not good if the path has parts of the street. In that case, you're better off in a pair of shoes with grips made for running in the hills.\n\nNo matter what, your normal shoes will be too big and won't help you grip the ground. So, warm up in them and then put on your race shoes for the race itself.\n\nOther things you'll need will depend on the weather. Usually, a tight, long-sleeved warm shirt will be helpful under your tank top. A pair of gloves and a hat can be helpful, too, especially to warm up in.\n\nAnd always have warm, dry clothes to change into after, and get a warm drink as soon as possible after you've finished the race.\n\nIt's not hard to find field races in the cold months, at least in BR country. There are many league races around the country, with maybe one race a month, usually about 8K. The best thing is to join your local running club so you can run the races as part of a team.\n\nRunning and playing together as a team is more fun than doing it alone. Being on a team encourages you to do your best. It's not like just running for fun or for a good cause. This is a real team game, sometimes there are even team prizes!\n\nAfter all races, you can talk to your friends about it: 'How did you do on the slippery part near the end?'\n\n'Wow, it was so hard! I had to crawl!'\n\nYou can laugh together, say well done, get changed into dry clothes, and feel happy knowing your friends had the same challenges as you. You might find out that some people had a harder time than you. That's better than thinking you were the only one who had to try hard because of the conditions.\n\nThere are lots of races you can join too. In EN country, the running season is planned around the County Games in early winter; the Area Games (the North, South, Middle, WE and SC games), which are usually at the end of winter; and the Big Games at the end of winter.\n\nMost of these races are about a long distance, although the South game is still run over its traditional and harder distance which is even longer.\n\nNone of these events is any more special than, say, the Big North Run or the Big City Marathon. Join, and you'll see all kinds of runners, from top runners to club runners, from beginners to experienced runners, from fast runners to slow runners.\n\nSo give it a try!\n\nOften on the roads you see runners who are not moving their arms much. They don't lift their knees high, either. They don't get strong that way. But sometimes, running in the countryside can be like running with a weight on your back. You really have to use your legs. They can feel like they're about to give out! Whereas on the road you can usually just keep going. Your legs might start to feel tired, but they don't give out.\n\nSometimes in countryside running, you have to jump or you're running up a hill, and you're not sure if you're going to trip. Or maybe your shoes have a lot of mud on them and they feel very heavy. Either way, you're getting really strong: The hills and mud make your lower legs, back legs, and big leg muscles strong. The bumpy ground makes your feet and ankles strong.\n\nKeeping your balance with all the twists and turns and dips is great for your body strength. The hard ground makes you lift your knees, and that works your belly muscles and makes your running better, or your _skill_ --another of the five S's. The hard work of going up and down hills can help you become stronger. This is good for your body. \n\nRunning on soft or sticky grounds is also good. It makes you work harder but is also easier on your body. This is why it's a good exercise. \n\nRunning off-road can make you breathe harder and your heart beat faster. That's a good thing. It helps your body use oxygen better and makes your heart and lungs stronger.\n\nIt can also make you mentally stronger.\n\nRunning up hills can be hard and can make you think a lot. Sometimes, you might think to yourself, 'I just want to get up this hill!' At this point, you might not even think about finishing the race. Maybe you'll think about that when you get to the top of the hill. For now, you're just trying to get up the hill without stopping. That can be really hard--you don't usually feel this way in a normal race!\n\nBut just like you get physically stronger with practice, you also get mentally stronger. When you _do_ reach the top of that very big hill, you will have made your toughness better. Every time you win, you'll feel more sure. When you feel scared and think about giving up, but you don't and you win instead, you'll feel really good about yourself. The challenge is against yourself and the situation, not just the other kids: It's good for making you stronger!\n\nI believe kids who've done cross country running have the strength needed to keep going when things get hard on the road or the track. Because running a long time is a lot about how you handle these feelings. Being strong in your mind is not about being more fit than the other kid; it's about staying with it and learning to keep going even when it's hard. When you get through these hard times, you get the confidence, the push, the fierceness, and the drive to really get the most out of all the physical training you've done.\n\nAnd I think that's amazing! The feeling of doing well and the happiness you get from having pushed your muscles and legs to their limit is great.\n\nIn all these ways and more, cross country helps you get better, no matter what you want to achieve. Sadly, there are people--some of them, I'm sorry to say, involved in BR athletics--who don't seem to see how much cross country is worth, and think it's not as important as 'real' athletics. The UK used to be famous for a fun running game: running through the mud is a typical BR country sport. But sadly, in the past many years, the people running the game and the coaches have lessened its importance. \n\nA lot of teaching was done by people who never played this running game themselves. And many people thought that this running game made slow runners, not fast runners. 'To be faster than the best runners and be fast on the track', they'd say, 'you shouldn't practice running on slippery, slow grounds.' \n\nAnd they'd point to people like David, David, Steve, Benjamin, and me and say we were all slow runners. Well, that's not nice. If we were slow, we were very fast slow runners!\n\nPart of the problem was the busy schedule of races, which delayed our preparations for the track running. The National Running Game Championship, then held early in March, was a very important race--one most runners couldn't afford to miss. It was the race used to pick the team for the World Running Game Championship a few weeks later. \n\nAnd going to the World Running Game Championship was a big deal. It was perhaps the hardest title of all to win. Because among the entrants you had all the short-distance runners, all the long-distance runners, all the longest-distance runners, all the obstacle runners, and all the running game specialists--all competing in that one race. In a big game, they take part in five different things. So the Big Run was really the biggest running game of all.\n\nBut, if you got to the Big Run, it maybe did distract you and delay getting ready for the track. It was like trying to be at your best twice, once in spring and then again in summer. And to fight your way onto the Team, which was very hard in those days, meant you had to be very fit by the end of spring, too. That left a short time to change.\n\nStill, the Big Run is usually on a smooth, quick path and the answer, truly, was to train for it like a track race.\n\nBut of course our country has a bit of a problem with its weather, and even if we hadn't been busy with running races, it would have been too cold here to do hard, fast running. Getting ready for a track-type race in spring is hard if you're in our country. Warm-weather training camps can be very good. I know they were for us. Otherwise, it can be hard to compete with the people from KE country and the other African countries. They're certainly training in warm weather, and they might be finding it easier to get that speed in their legs.\n\nBut it's not that running slows you down, it's just that our weather and our running courses tend to work against fast running--or so some people think! But I believe other information shows something different. Many winners of the long National Running Race were fast runners for short and long distances. The year I won the National on a very muddy course, I was the fastest short-distance runner there. Also, the team picked from that race had five really fast runners! That same year, I ran my fastest short distance ever. In a later year, I believe only one runner from our country ran that fast all summer.\n\nLooking at the excellent results from the runners from KE country, they can do very well in the World Running Race in spring. This doesn't stop them from setting records and winning big races in summer.\n\nAnd think about the runner from ET country, Kevin. He's the best athlete in the World Running Race with many wins in long and short distances. He's won a big race in both the short and the long run, and holds the record for both. Running on different grounds doesn't seem to slow him down. I believe it likely helps him.\n\nAnd what about those of us who were good at running on different grounds but supposedly slow runners? Well, Benjamin set a big running record, and Jack a record for a long run, and the rest of us were pretty quick, too. Look at the list of FR country's fast men for the long run. Ethan, David, Benjamin, Frank, Nathan, Tony, David, Bernie, Matthew, Richard, David, and me--we all won the Big Race. And Isaac, even though he never won the Big Race, did win the World Big Race. Almost all of this country's fast runners were very good at big races.\n\nIf you look at the times we ran a long time ago, they would be happy to have any of us on the FR team today. So not focusing on big races doesn't seem to have made people faster. And, while you can argue that big races took us away from our running preparations, you certainly can't argue that runners who've done less big races--running instead on shorter, flat paths--have run faster. They haven't.\n\nNo, big races didn't slow us down. And they won't slow you down, either. They will make you faster.\n\nAs the hot weather goes away and winter comes, you don't want to start over with your practice. On the contrary, winter is the best time to get stronger and run longer, and running some of those miles off the path will really help. Different places to play can be good for you. It's like taking a break when you try new things. You'll be doing something different than just running on roads. This new thing will make you less likely to get hurt.\n\nLots of people have fun in tough races and games. They run through cold water and crawl under pointy wire in cold mud. Compared to that, playing in the country is like a walk in the park. Enjoy it--get dirty, get stronger, and get mentally tough.\n\nAnd you'll get good things in the summer.\n\n##### IMPORTANT THINGS TO REMEMBER\n\n- Playing in the country can make you a better runner on any ground because it's very good at making you strong, skilled, lasting longer, and mentally tough.\n\n- If it's muddy, the best shoes are special country shoes. But if the ground has roads or stones, it's better to wear shoes with small spikes.\n\n- Get ready for playing in the country by training off-road. Do fun games. Do hill games off-road. And if you're going to play in spikes, remember to try them out a few times in your off-road fast games. In fact, whatever shoes you plan to play in, try them out in fast games first.\n\n#### Chapter 10\n\n#### Running in Circles\n\nTalk about running quickly to many children--maybe even most of them--and they don't seem excited. \n\n'It's too hard!' they say. 'It's no longer fun to run!' Or, 'I might get hurt!'\n\n'I can't run fast, anyway', some children tell me. 'That's why I run for a long time.'\n\n'I don't have time to run quickly. If I did, I wouldn't be able to run for a long time', many say. 'I run for a long time, so I don't need to run quickly.'\n\nEven children who know that running fast can be good have reasons why they don't do it often. 'Yes,' they tell me, 'I run quickly sometimes just before a race--after I've done all my long running.'\n\nBut the ability to run for a long time is exactly the point. For children who run for a long distance, running quickly is not like running a short race. Because it involves running fast--often faster than in a race-- many times with little rest, it is training to run for a long time. It helps you run quickly for a long time and run strongly for a long time. And it's not only useful just before a race, running quickly in one way or another is helpful most of the time.\n\nBut with running quickly, running for a long time will build strength, the ability to run quickly for a long time, the ability to handle tiredness, and your ability to feel better quickly while still running.\n\nI know that some people, especially those who haven't tried it, think running fast is tough because it's out of their usual fun zone. But I enjoyed it, and wouldn't have missed it for anything.\n\nFor one thing, it makes your play time fun, different, and focused. It helps you not to feel bored, and stops the what-shall-I-do-today feeling. Also, it's a fun thing to do with friends. You and your friends meet at the play area--like fields, woods, or parks--roll your eyes a bit thinking of the running to come, chat during the rest times, and maybe tease each other a bit as you cool down.\n\nIf the game is planned well, you can all stay together, even if some friends run faster or slower. Maybe the fast runners will run more, or the slow runners will rest every other time. But, by running together, you can learn from each other, cheer each other on, and try to match each other. I think it's more fun than many group games, which can become a race, leaving friends running at their own speed--and alone.\n\nI would have certainly found it boring to just run the same all the time. The whole pattern of play would have become boring, day after day, and month after month. I think changing activities is just as good as taking a break, both in your mind and body. It keeps your thinking fresh. And it keeps your feet moving: I've said it before, don't practice walking slowly.\n\nBeyond that, you simply can't get much better at running fast without practicing running fast regularly. Just running at the same speed all the time won't make you a lot better, even if you run longer distances.\n\nWhen you first stop being lazy and start running, of course you'll get better with regular runs. You'll probably lose some weight, which will help you run faster. You'll be able to run for longer as your heart and lungs get better, which will let you run the same distance faster.\n\nBut then you'll stop getting better slowly. The rule that you get less and less better the more you do something will start. Once you're fit, I think just running normally won't help you run without getting tired much. And that limit stops you from running fast, almost like a speed limit on a car. If you don't practice running fast, you won't be able to run much faster in a race.\n\nRunning fast makes your heart beat faster, so your heart gets bigger and stronger. Running fast makes you breathe hard, so your lungs get bigger. It makes your legs stronger over a greater range of movement, so you get stronger compared to your weight. Running fast helps you get stronger and recover quicker. You can train to run the same path quicker or a longer path at the same speed.\n\nDo you get these good things from running at a medium speed? Not really. You don't have a lot of time for medium speed runs if you want to do other kinds of training too.\n\nImagine you're running seven times a week and you're already strong. I suggest you do one hill run, one fast run, and one run where you change speeds. This leaves one day for a long run, one day for a slow run to rest--and just two days for medium speed runs.\n\nDoing lots of medium speed runs to run more each week might be good at certain times--like before Christmas, if you're preparing for a big race in the spring or summer. Running more can be fun, but you should still do some fast runs.\n\n'Long, slow runs make long, slow runners,' said a man named Samuel, quoted in a book, _A Famous Book about Running_.\n\nMaybe some of you have found that out already, which could be why you're reading this book.\n\nDuring my work, I often did not run more than 100 steps in a week, and I never went above 120. But thinking about how hard I worked, sometimes I felt as tired as if I'd run 160 steps. And I could have run 160 steps in a week, if I'd done them slower (and not had a different job!). But I don't think it would have been as good, and I wouldn't have had as much fun.\n\nRunning fast, in a simple way, is any running that's faster than your race speed. If your race time is long and you'd like to make it shorter, you need to do a lot of your training faster. Of course your speed will change depending on what you plan to do. But that means that, for you, running 10 times in a short time with two minutes rest between each would be running fast--and that's _not_ running as fast as you can.\n\nBut while that is a good plan, I think it's too similar to a speed you know you can keep for a long race without stopping at all. It's much better to do just six times, but at a faster speed. That's still not running as fast as you can, but it is a lot faster than race speed.\n\nAnd don't stop there in your quest for speed! Why not also try some plans that, while they're not as fast as you can go, are still quite fast--short repetitions for example?\n\nWhen you hear about running 200 steps quickly, some people might say, 'Wow, that seems too quick for me! You know, I'm a long-distance runner, I usually run 1000 steps.'\n\nMaybe. At some times, 1000-step runs on a hilly field are great. But on the running ring, I'm not as excited. A thousand steps is a lot: The risk is that you won't be able to run the steps much faster than your usual speed and that you'll end up slow and sad as your time for each step gets slower and slower.\n\nThat's the real worry many people have: They think they won't be able to go quick enough. But the truth is they _can_. And they'll find it fun, if only they give themselves a chance to find out.\n\nHow? Don't do the 1000-step runs. Instead, do five sets of 200 steps with short rests--and that's your 1000 steps, but in a way that lets you run much faster than your usual speed.\n\nLet's say your plan was to do four sets of 1000 steps. Doing 20 sets of 200 gives you the same distance, and you surely won't be dashing. The important thing is to let yourself only take short rests between the 200 steps: half a minute if you can. Take a longer break between each set of five runs. This means that after every five runs, you should rest for three minutes. This will help you run faster and take more breaks, even though most of them will be short.\n\nThis type of running has many good things. It helps you get used to running fast. You move better. Your running way is better. You're not running slow. Your balance is better, and your timing is better. After some time, you will be able to do the running you wanted to do--four times one kilometer--but, importantly, at a fast speed!\n\nAnd I think you will get hurt less. If you always run slow, with the same speed, the same stride, and the same landing, then you may get hurt from using the same thing too much. It will make you stronger if you run at different speeds, on different grounds, and on different slopes.\n\nBecause fast running doesn't have to be done on the track. It can be done on hills, sandy hills, parks, play fields, and forest trails. The only thing you need to do is run faster than your race speed sometimes, while at other times you walk or jog and make sure that you rest enough.\n\n##### GETTING USED TO SPEED\n\nWhen you start something new, you need to be smart and careful. If you've never run fast before, and you put on special shoes, go to a place where you can run and try to do lots of fast runs with little rest, it's not good. \n\nLike I said before, the best way to get used to running different speeds is to start with some fun runs, where you run steady with a few faster bits when you feel like it. Push yourself! Try different things! Pick a goal--a tree, a light, or a hill--and run faster until you get there. Then walk until you feel ready to run fast again.\n\nChange the lengths and the speeds of your runs. Change your rests, too, sometimes taking longer than you need, and sometimes starting your next run before you feel you're ready. Start to learn what you can do--and if you're in a group, see how your runs affect your friends. Maybe some of them are faster than you, but maybe they need more rest than you do.\n\nIf you're doing these runs with a group, take turns being the leader and deciding how much rest everyone gets. Fast runs might be unplanned, but they're great for practice: They help you run faster, judge pace, and feel more confident. It's like a fun game with a bit of a challenge!\n\nTo start, try doing eight to ten short runs, each between half a minute and 3 minutes, during a long run. It's best if you can do your fast runs on softer ground that won't hurt your legs too much while they're still getting strong.\n\nOnce you've done some fast running and gotten used to running faster, a good next step is to do race-like practice runs on the grass. Keep your practice runs short and your rests long--say 10 times a short distance with two-minutes break in between.\n\nThe distances are just guesses, of course, and that's okay. You're just trying to get used to running fast in your normal shoes. In the beginning, doing these practices on a soft surface like grass or paths covered with pine needles can be helpful, because the surface of the race track can take some getting used to. If you start on grass, you don't have to get used to the speed and the surface all at once.\n\nAs you do these short distance runs, remember--you're not meant to be racing! In this practice you're not trying to see how fast you can run a short distance just one time. You like to run fast and keep your speed the same from start to end.\n\nIf you want to do this 10 times, the first two or three runs should feel easy, even if you're a bit slower than your fastest speed. But by the sixth or seventh run, you'll see this is not just about being fast. You've made your rest times short, so the activity is going to be hard. And what will hold you back, even with runs as short as 200 steps, isn't mostly your speed. You'll be held back by your power, strength, and how long you can keep going--in other words, your ability to get ready and do the runs at the same speed again.\n\nEven though it's called fast running, this activity really won't do much to make your speed better. Instead, it will make your strength and how long you can keep going better--exactly what you need to run faster in a 10K run.\n\n##### NEXT STEPS: THE IDEA OF GETTING BETTER\n\nNow, having got used to running fast on the grass, you might want to run on a path, maybe even--one day--in spiked shoes.\n\nA good way to start doing fast running on a path is to just simply jog the bends and stride the straights. Try eight laps of the path. Use your normal running shoes or the shoes you run road races in. Don't _run_ very fast, as if you were trying to catch Ulysses. _Walk_ fast, with high knees, long steps, and a fast pace. You're just trying to go a little fast, to get used to the ground and to being out of breath. Then walk slowly to recover. You must catch your breath. The activity is like a gentle, structured play.\n\nAfter you've got used to walking slowly and walking fast, try to extend it a bit. Instead of walking fast for a short distance at time, try walking for a longer distance at the same speed, then walking slowly to recover. And do it for ten laps instead of eight. That will give you 10 times a longer distance with about two-minute recoveries.\n\nIt's a good way to improve. Each lap will be done in about the same time as before: You're just putting your two short fast walking bits together into one longer effort. And then you're giving yourself twice as long a walk to recover, as well.\n\nBut in the process you're teaching yourself to maintain your faster pace for twice as long. You'll be developing the art of sustained speed, which is what racing is all about. And you will have added a couple more laps to the activity, as well, for a little more work on endurance.\n\nYou can slowly start from the beginning. You may try your running times with special shoes. When I used to run, it was easy for us to wear these shoes: They were light and nice, and they helped us run fast and strong. Remember that running paths can be slippery when it rains, and your normal shoes may not be the best. To avoid hurting your legs and feet, you can get special shoes with soft, cushioned bottoms.\n\nWhether you choose to use these shoes depends on you and what you want to do. For a grown-up man who wants to run a long race and has never worn these shoes in his life, it might cause problems: especially hurting his legs. He would be much better running in the same shoes he's going to use in the race. If the path is wet, just be careful--or run on the road or a dirt path instead.\n\nOver time, you want to get better like I described when I talked about running longer than 100 steps to 200 steps. You don't want to do the exact same running time over and over. I know people who've read somewhere that to run a long race in a certain time they have to run ten 800-step runs, each in that many minutes. They want to run the long race in three and a half hours, so they go to the path and run ten 800s in 3:30--over and over and over. That's not moving forward. It's staying the same.\n\nYou can run at the same speed a bit longer, even if you rest more, so you're getting better at keeping your speed. Or you can run the same speed and distance but, maybe after three or four weeks, rest less time, teaching your body to rest faster--and acting like in a race, when you have to rest from a hill or a fast run without stopping at all.\n\nTo make your runs help each other this way, you need to time your runs and your rests. Timing your runs lets you know right away, not only how good you are running and how good you are resting between runs but also how good you are at guessing your speed. All of this is very helpful, not just when you're running, but also months and years later.\n\nWhen you get home, write your times in your running book. Don't just think you'll remember them. Writing these things will, after a while, show you that you're getting better, which will make you feel good. It's nice to know you're running faster, without having to run a whole race to show it. And it's also nice to know that all your hard work is helping. You need to believe in your training, knowing that it is working and showing clear results. There's nothing better than believing, both in your training and in a race.\n\nMaybe the old way of doing fast run exercises is to make all your runs in the same time--your last short run in the same time as your first. And that's how I did many of mine. But even though this is a fun and good way of training, I think it needs changing sometimes. David and I were very good at time-race-type running. We could keep a very fast speed for a long time. In David's case, that earned him a world record in the big run; in my case, almost but not quite.\n\nBut neither of us could change speed well, and for that reason neither of us was very good at winning the big races on the field. When he and I were training with our coach, Bob, we knew that was a problem, and Bob tried to help us with it. We often used to run long runs where we had to run the first part in 65 seconds, for example, and the last part in 30 seconds or less. So we had to change speed at the end of the run.\n\nThese exercises helped us, but they didn't help our basic lack of very fast speed, so we were never able to develop a powerful, race-winning change of speed. I found it quite hard to run much under 30 seconds for the last part of a race. I did run some final laps in 58 or 59 seconds--pretty good, considering that my fastest short run ever was only 54 seconds. But it was tough when I was running with people who were doing the last part of a long race really fast! Of course, if these runners stayed with me until the last part began, I was likely to have some problems. It was the same for David--and sadly, we never completely solved that problem.\n\nOn one side some people would tell me, 'Well, you're that kind of runner. You've got slow muscles--in fact, I'm surprised you're able to run as fast as you do!'\n\nBut on the other side, looking back, maybe we should have practiced differently. Maybe we ran too much. Maybe we didn't do enough strength exercises. And--just maybe--we did too many of those practices with all the parts paced exactly the same.\n\nFor his part, David didn't seem very interested in developing a big change of speed. He would argue that, if he could improve a little bit each part by running even more and getting even stronger, he would make his long race time shorter by a lot. But if he worked really hard on his end sprint, he might improve his last part by just a little bit. His feeling was that he'd rather have the big improvement. But that forgets how easy you make it for the other runners. If your strategy is predictable, and your opponents can just find a way to stay with you, their race in essence becomes one part shorter: If they're with you with one part to go, they've won. And above all, running first is tougher on the leader, so he or she might not do as well while helping his or her friends to do better. Paula is another typical example of a first runner with this kind of problem.\n\nFor those children who don't remember David's competitive days, think of the two men with big mustaches in the TV ads. Those men looked like him--too much like him, to be fair. David made a complaint saying his picture was being used without his say-so, and Ofcom, the BR communication checker, agreed. 'The ads', Ofcom said, 'make fun of David by showing a funny, bigger representation of him looking like he did in the late 20th century, sporting a hairstyle and facial hair like his at the time, and wearing running clothes almost the same as the running clothes that were uniquely worn by him at the time, including red socks, sky-blue shorts with gold braiding, and a shirt with two hoops.'\n\nDavid definitely was unique. There weren't many other top runners competing in red socks. And he was a great runner, one of the best in the world, there's no denying it. Amazing, considering the huge number of miles he ran, and the number of drinks he had.\n\nBut he could have easily won a lot more races--and some big medals, too--if he had figured out how to speed up suddenly in the middle of a race. Like the person from AU country named Adam, who did very well 17 times but never won the biggest race, all of David's best runs had him in front, not needing to think about any plans. The hard part for him wasn't being in front; it was getting there. That was pretty easy for him against people from his own country in a time long ago, but much harder in big races with people from all over the world.\n\nIn this long ago time, the best at running fast in the middle of the race was a runner from BR country named Benjamin. He would often run very fast for two minutes in the middle of a long race. He won many races this way.\n\nI also tried this way of running many times, usually leaving most runners behind--but not always every runner. I often ended up second, third, or fourth. Again, not quite the best!\n\nIf I could do it again, instead of running the same speed twelve times like David and I used to do, I would try running at different speeds. That's what I've done with runners I've taught since I stopped running, and it works well.\n\nDon't always run at the same speed. Run some faster than others in a pattern. Take turns running quite fast and very fast, or make a plan where you run faster and faster each time. This will help you to run fast and slow, even when you feel tired. This will give you more ways to run when you are near the end of a race. It's another way of learning new things.\n\nIf you are a very good runner, instead of running 12 times around a track in one minute, you might try just 10 times, sometimes running a little slower, sometimes a little faster.\n\nOr you could try running around the track 12 times in a different way: Run three times around the track in one minute each, then take a short rest; run the next two times a little faster, then take a longer rest; run the next time even faster. Take a longer rest between each set and a very long rest before doing the same thing again--but in reverse, run once very fast with a very long rest, run twice a little slower with a longer rest, and the last three times at the original speed with a short rest.\n\nOf course, you need to change the times to match how good you are at running, but anyone can follow the way this exercise is set up. If you start by running around the track in a minute and a half, that's okay. The idea is the same. Try different things; don't just practice running at one speed. Learn how to run faster even when you feel tired. This will help you in races no matter how good you are at running. Sometimes, it's good to run not as fast as you can. This way, you can feel strong and fast for a longer time. In other words, do activities where you're making yourself stronger and not just tired.\n\nTry to make each run faster than the last. But remember, getting stronger from running takes time. So you should only try to make a run tougher every few weeks. And remember to slow down before a big race.\n\nHere's some advice: Only make one change at a time. The goal of these activities, like all others, is to make yourself stronger, not tired. Be smart.\n\nThink about how you feel when you do these activities compared to a normal run with your friends. Do you get as out of breath on your long run? Does your heart beat as fast? Do your legs feel as heavy? Of course not. And that means that these types of runs are helping you get stronger and have more energy. They help you push past the things that a normal run doesn't.\n\n##### RUNNING FASTER FOR LONGER\n\nI mentioned before about speed that you can do again and again, doing a lot of short runs at close to your fastest speed. As a runner, you should also care about how long you can keep up your speed. Like, how well you can run long paths, like ones that are as long as four, six or eight big houses. Think of it like running shorter paths with tiny breaks until there are no breaks left.\n\nIn a run with longer paths, your breaks need to be much longer, too. As a rule, you should wait until your heart isn't beating fast before running again. After running really hard, or running short paths with only tiny breaks--for example, four times the length of a big house with 20-second breaks--it should take at least three minutes before you feel ready to run again, maybe even longer.\n\nBut that can show a problem: Many runners find it hard to run so hard that they _need_ that much rest. They can run what they think is their fastest for six big houses, get to the end, and be ready to go again just a minute later. They feel fully rested. Their heart isn't beating fast anymore.\n\nIn this run, they're not slowed down by being unable to rest quickly, nor are they unable to run the same path several times. Here, the thing that is holding them back is not just speed, it's how _strong_ they are. The work they put in, and the speed these runners can keep up for as long as six big houses, is not much faster than the speed they can keep up for a whole long race.\n\nSome fast people should make their long runs into smaller parts, with very tiny rests in between. I will tell you how to do this very soon. Doing this helps them run faster and get better at running fast for a long time.\n\nWhen it's cold outside, they should do more strength exercises--more running up hills, more lifting, and more running in open fields.\n\nFor new people learning about this kind of running, it's hard to know how fast to go when you run for a long time. The problem is that each time you run, you might get slower, until you're not running much faster than you would in a race. This won't help you get better at running and it can make you feel sad. We don't want this--we want you to feel happy when you run! That's very important!\n\nOne way to fix this problem is to change your running so you can keep your speed and form.\n\nLet's say you want to run six times for a long time with three minutes of rest in between. You run the first time at a speed you think you can do five more times. But even after three minutes of rest, and even though your heart is not beating very fast, you may find it hard to run as fast as you did the first time.\n\nDon't stop! And, unless you ran the first time very, very fast, don't be okay with running slower each time. Instead, play the game this way:\n\n- Run a long distance fast, and remember how long it took. This is now your goal time for the rest of the game.\n\n- Take a long rest.\n\n- Run a medium distance at the same speed, take a short rest, then run a short distance more. The time for your medium and short runs should add up to your long run goal time.\n\n- Take a long rest.\n\n- Run a short distance, rest a bit, run a short distance, rest a bit, then run one more short distance. Again, the times for your three short runs should add up to your long run goal time.\n\n- Take a long rest.\n\n- Do all those steps one more time.\n\nThere are a lot of rests in that game. And I think some children might not like to run fast because they don't want to be seen to stop, and that probably goes double for stopping to rest in the middle of their supposed long run.\n\nBut in this game, you're allowed to take rests. And you've made this game with a certain goal in mind. What you're doing, in short, is choosing not to run slower. You're teaching your body to run the six times long runs at the speed you want. If at first you have to take some tiny rests in the middle of your long runs, no problem. It's much better to keep going strong than to get slower as time goes on. Getting slower isn't good, not even when you're tired.\n\nWhen your body gets used to it and you become stronger, you can try to get rid of the little rests. You can do this by changing the exercise I talked about earlier.\n\nFor example, you can try to run the whole 600 steps without stopping every other time instead of every third time: First 600 steps--then 400 plus 200--then 600 again--then 300 plus 300--then 600 again, and finally 200 plus 200 plus 200, with the same three minutes of rest in between.\n\nAs you get even stronger, you might run two of the full 600-step runs in a row, then one of the broken-up 600 steps, then two of the full 600 steps again, then another broken-up run, and you'll have done your six.\n\nYou can change the exercise to fit you. But make sure to keep the little rest times--they're not meant to make you fully rested, just to give you the little rest you need to keep your original speed and form.\n\nOne day, you will be able to get rid of all the little rests. How much is a 20 seconds rest worth, anyway? Sometimes, you'll find it's easier not to stop for 20 seconds and then have to start again. It's better to just keep running! That way, you can go the whole 600 steps at your goal speed six times.\n\nThis kind of training will make you run faster for longer. Without it, you won't be as fast.\n\n##### MAKING FAST ENOUGH GAMES\n\nHow many of your games should be fast ones? And how fast should they be?\n\nI said before that a fast game is any game that is faster than your race speed. If your race is the 10K, anything faster than your 10K race speed is a fast game. I think that a lot of your games should be faster than your race speed.\n\nBut maybe you've read in a book that most, or all, of your games should be slower than race speed. I agree with that, too! Ideally, at least 80 percent of your games should be done at a nice, easy speed--but not just walking, though.\n\nBut if you're doing 10 games a week, fewer of your games will be faster than race speed than if you just do three games a week. If you play fewer games, the number of fast games will be higher: It just wouldn't work if you decided to do one fast game every three weeks to make sure your slower games are 80 percent of all your games.\n\nAlso, running fast in a race does not make you faster. I know some running groups that practice by running 1K, 10 times at the same speed as a 10K race. But, what's the reason for this? It's not helpful! This type of practice won't make them better. They know they can run 10K at that speed without stopping. They're just resting when they don't need to. It's not a very good practice, it's just tiring but not hard enough or specific enough to really help. They might call this a certain type of practice, but there are too many rests.\n\nReal practices of this type are different, and can make you much better. They are fast, long runs, at or just faster than race speed (but just slower than your highest speed), over distances shorter than the race distance. For example, if you're planning to race 5,000 metres, a 3,000-metre practice could be this type of run. If you are running 5- or 6-mile races outside, a fast 3- or 4-mile effort on the streets would also be this type of run.\n\nNow I'm going to make the meaning of good speed practice a bit harder. For one thing, the best speed depends on how long the runs are. Doing 200-metre runs just a bit faster than your 10K speed won't really help you, either.\n\nTo be good at running fast, even your slowest running should be quicker than your best speed for a shorter distance. If you're getting ready for a long race, run your long, quick runs at a speed quicker than you can keep up for a shorter race. A lot of your quick runs will be even quicker, depending on what you do each time, how long you run, and the rest times.\n\nWhen you plan your running each week, remember that you should be using quick runs to get better at running fast for a long time. Some times you need to do a lot of short runs with short rests, to get good at running fast again and again. Other times should be longer runs, but not as many, with good rest times, to get good at keeping up a quick speed. And there are lots of ways you can mix this up.\n\n##### Taking Care of Yourself\n\nEvery now and then, you might want to do quick runs where you're not trying to be as fast as possible. Sometimes it's really good, for your body and your mind, to do quick runs at a pace that's not as fast as you can go. You can use these slower quick runs to feel confident and excited as a big race gets closer. Many runners think that getting ready for a race is just running less quickly, less often, and not as far as usual. But running fast can be helpful and should not be forgotten. Also, you can do not-too-hard sessions to help you feel better after a tough race.\n\nI remember a time just a few days after my big race. It was meant to help me feel better, just to move the legs a bit and get them working again.\n\n'I want you to go and just run some short distances to feel fresh after the race, but I don't want you to run too fast', my coach, Harry, told me. 'I know you feel good and you're better, but I just want you to run easy for the most part, then run the last part quickly.'\n\nThat was a fun time. I did what Harry told me and I still couldn't go slower than a minute or a bit more for each run--even though it was a cold winter night. I was fast, and it felt good. In your mind, it's a nice feeling to be running so fast, yet still feeling you're not giving your all. Don't forget how good it feels--the happy feeling--of not running as fast as you can, of knowing you could go faster any time you felt like it. But it's still important to check the time; otherwise you'll never know how well you're doing. Remember, you can't always trust how you feel to tell you how fast you're going.\n\nLooking back, I think we should not _always_ try to do our best in our running games. It's fun to run fast, but it's good to play, too. Play with the speed, play with the rest, and play with changing speed without any rest. Sometimes you want to feel, Wow! I had a good game today! Hardly breathing! I was just playing--I've got plenty in reserve!'\n\nThat kind of game makes your legs feel good and makes you feel happy.\n\n##### REST--IT'S A IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR GAMES\n\nIt is important to remember that your games in general, and fast games in particular, will only work if you allow your body to rest. Of course, that means having yummy food and drink and the right amount of sleep. But it also means making sure you have easy days between fast games.\n\nTo know what is actually easy on these rest days is quite hard. Sometimes you play a fast game and you feel great and fully rested the next day. Other times it can take many days to rest. And it's not just about how fast you've been playing. Other things can affect you, too--traveling, staying up late, the parties, the kids, the stress at home, and a lot of other things.\n\nIn the same way, you can never guess how long it will take for the fun effect of a game to come through. You can never say _today's_ fun time will make you stronger _tomorrow_. There's no recipe that says it takes exactly 20 minutes to cook. It doesn't work like that. There's always some time later, but you never really know how much later that will be.\n\nIn any event, you're only going to be a better player when you've rested. No fun activity works in a day, but neither can you say it will take two weeks to feel the fun of a particular game. It might be much less. Some games and races make you stronger quickly. Others only have a tiny effect, and it's the whole block of games that makes you stronger. It's like getting over being tired: Sometimes you feel all better quite quickly; other times it seems to take a long time to feel better, and you just feel tired all the time.\n\nThis is when you really need to listen to your body and decide what you need to do. It's not as easy as following a set plan--it's a skill and an art. You need to be smart to give yourself every chance. It's a bad thing to run fast in your game on Wednesday, then feel weak in that weekend's race because you still haven't rested.\n\nOr even worse, you could hurt yourself. Before the big game in 1997 in AT city, the BR country runner Kevin was in the best shape of his life. After setting new records for running, Alice had gone on to win in the big games in MU city and the play day in OL city. She then won the fast race title at the championships, and victory in AT city was starting to look possible.\n\nThen, shortly before the big game--the race that meant more to her than any other that year--she finished a fast run by sprinting a long distance in a good time. But she got a small hurt on her foot. Soon afterwards, she did another very hard run, fast race repeats with a helper, each run in a short time--until her foot hurt got bad.\n\nThen at the big game in AT city, in the early run of the long race, her leg got bad. She'd hurt her foot and her leg muscle. Her game was over on the very first morning of the big game.\n\nWhat did she stand to gain by doing that sort of run so close to the big race? Maybe it would have made her feel stronger--but in her body, almost nothing. She was already faster than anyone else in the world. So why risk it?\n\nShe was taken to ZU city to see a doctor, ended up with her leg in a cast, and watched the final on TV.\n\nLuckily, at the big game in AT city in a year not long ago, she got it right and won the gold in both the fast and long race.\n\nListen to your body. Work hard but be safe. Make your play times so that you get better instead of getting tired. Like I've said before, the main goal of every play time should be to make you ready to play again tomorrow.\n\n##### WHEN THE SEASONS CHANGE\n\nI would tell you to forget the idea that fast running is just for getting better, something to be done only in the few weeks before a big race. But of course, after the racing season you will want to slow down and make your play times less hard.\n\nBenjamin, who won a big race medal in the long run in the late 20th century, used to give himself a long rest time when he would run very little and actually get a little heavy--either on purpose or because he liked a drink or two. His friends loved running with him when he started playing again, because they could win the great man in play times. Big Ben, as he came to be known, didn't mind: He knew what he was doing--he was letting his body rest--and he was very good at getting ready for the big day.\n\nWhile Benjamin was good at using this rest time to his advantage, a mistake a lot of runners make is to lose--almost give away--most of what they've got better over the summer. After a rest time, they go back to their steady play times in the winter, do some fast running in the spring, and run some races in the summer. Then they rest, and after that, they continue with the steady work. They think to themselves, \"I'll take it easy and just keep moving.\"\n\nBut you don't want to just get better for a year and then start again from the very beginning. You want to keep getting better every year. My advice is to still play games, still run up hills, and still repeat some actions even when you're just going along. Just change your focus from being fast to being strong and not getting tired, and think less about how urgent and intense your training is. Try to relax your mind instead of resting your body, and let the fitness come to you. But make sure that this year, you're doing better than you were last year.\n\nYes, what you focus on in your training will change with the seasons. In the winter, you'll want to focus more on repeating longer and hillier runs, doing them a bit slower, with shorter rests. This will make you stronger and able to run for longer. Then, before the running season, and during it, you'll want to focus on flat, fast runs with longer rests.\n\nBut you should include fast sessions in your training for at least 10 months of the year.\n\nOf course, don't do the same fast session every week. Over six weeks, you could do each of the following fast sessions:\n\n- First week: Short rest session (like, 4 groups of 4  short runs with 1 minute rests). Take a short break after each game.\n\n- Second week: Run up a small hill quickly (for example, run up a small hill quickly 12 times, then jog back slowly)\n\n- Third week: Run on the playground (for example, run 6 times around a big circle, just like we talked about before. And do it again.)\n\n- Fourth week: Run for a long time (run as fast as you can)\n\n- Fifth week: Run up a big hill quickly (for example, run up a big hill quickly 6 times, then jog back slowly)\n\n- Sixth week: Run for different times:\n\n- Run fast for _1 minute_, then jog slowly for 1 minute\n\n- Run fast for _2 minutes_, then jog slowly for 1 and a half minutes\n\n- Run fast for _3 minutes_, then jog slowly for 2 minutes\n\n- Run fast for _4 minutes_, then jog slowly for 3 minutes\n\n- And do it again in reverse order.\n\n- Or try this game, with three-minute rests between each game:\n\n- Run _4 short distances_ with 1 minute rest\n\n- Run _3 medium distances_ with 2 minutes rest\n\n- Run _2 long distances_ with 3 minutes rest\n\n- Run _1 longer distance_\n\n- And do it again in reverse order\n\nAfter doing all these, I'm sure you'll be happy to return to a slow jog the next week and repeat the games we played in the last six weeks, just like we talked about before.\n\n##### LEARNING WHAT'S INSIDE\n\nI know a lot of people say they run only to play with their friends, and they're not even interested in trying to win a game. But I believe that, secretly, many of them still wish to run faster. And I'm sure a lot of people who say they're not interested in racing actually do race a little bit--maybe as much while practicing as in real races.\n\nAnd most runners know the feeling that comes from reaching a hard part in a race--maybe up a hill--when you're getting tired, the race is getting hard, and you can't keep up. You know: 'I'm just behind. I'm just behind', and then, 'Aw, they got away.' And it's a feeling they'd rather not have.\n\nThe point is to understand what happens at this hard part that makes you can't keep up, and how to stop that from happening. Or on the other hand, they'd like to learn, when they're in front, how they can get away from the one chasing them. It might need a big effort rather than just hoping the other guy will get tired. It's hard, but it feels really good if you can do it.\n\nWell, you can learn those skills. Doing so needs practicing the race experience in training, especially the hard parts. Let's say you're the guy who just got left behind, and it was on a hill. You want to feel that hill again, and practice running it well instead of poorly.\n\nBut don't just do one hard run. It's not helpful going out for a 10-mile run and saying after eight miles, 'OK, this is the point where I had trouble. I'm going to practice going faster halfway up the hill.' Because in a run like that, if you just run up one hill at the eight-mile point, you only get one try. You want to feel that more than once. How? Warm up and run a three- or four-mile game of speed, so you're quite tired. Then do maybe half a dozen times up a hill--with, of course, enough breaks in between. Sometimes try so you run each time slightly differently. Learn how to pace yourself up the hill, what speed is best, and maybe practice going faster half way up or as you run over the top. Then run home at a nice pace, doing just two or three easy strides to cool down.\n\nThen the next time you get to that point in a race, you can say to yourself, 'OK, I've been here before. I've practiced this--and not just once, but many times. I know the feelings to expect, and I know I can deal with them: I will feel better.' And, as you get this fitness and mind strength, you learn to keep going.\n\nOr, even better, you're going to have the confidence to say, 'This boy thinks he can beat me but this time I'm going to be quicker.' _Zoom!_ Make your move first--put _him_ under pressure! See if he likes it and how he reacts! There's nothing like it. It's like playing a game or a friendly competition, and it's lots of fun.\n\nLook, I like to win. It's hard for me to understand people who don't want to win and instead say, 'Alright, I'll just do it my way. I'll see you at the top of the hill. Just wait for me there.' I think that by choosing to do it the easy way, these runners don't get to find out what they can really do. Sometimes you have to find out what you can do in practice before you try to do it in a real game.\n\nThey're basically saying, 'I don't want to play.' But that means they're only getting part of the fun. They're playing a game for pretend money instead of real money. 'It doesn't matter if I lose,' they say. 'You can win as many pretend money as you like!'\n\nOf course it doesn't matter if you lose. But maybe it does matter if you don't even try! Make the game more exciting and--just pretend--play for real money.\n\nIn the end, of course, it's not about the money or the pretend money. And it's not just about getting stronger and faster and feeling great. It's about you becoming better and doing your best. It's more than just fun, it's about growing and learning. It's about the trip, finding out how brave you are, and liking the feeling of doing a good job.\n\nLiking the game more doesn't begin with just showing up and telling yourself, 'Okay, now play.' You need to get ready first. Don't just jump in without knowing what to do.\n\nIt begins with joining in these practice sessions and finding out what they feel like. It's about learning to deal with things that are hard and liking the outcomes, which make your hard work so good. It's like anything in life--the more you give to something, the more you get from it.\n\nBut first, you need to be ready to give.\n\nYou'll also see that the more of your heart you give and the more you promise to do, the more feelings you will have. It's not unusual--just look at the medal winners or at Ryan, who often cries, not only when he loses big games but when he wins, too. Or look at the FR country biker Matthew. When he won the fifth part of the big FR country race--his first win in the race--he cried because he was so happy. Clearly, these guys aren't just playing for fun. But it's not about the money either. It's about the big bravery and promise that they have shown in their work.\n\nIf you don't do fast running, you're missing out on a lot--better health, the fun of learning to run quickly, and the joy of finding out how good you really are.\n\nYes, some people might think it's not nice. But they don't know, because they've never really tried it. Believe me--it feels _amazing_. It makes you feel full of energy and happy. After you finish, you walk around feeling thrilled--not just about what you have done with your running but also about what you can do in general if you just try very hard.\n\nAnd, for most people, it's a lot more than they think.\n\n##### IMPORTANT THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND\n\n- When you first start fast running, start on a soft place, like grass, and just get used to running quickly, maybe for a short distance, with lots of rest. After that, you can go to the running track if you want.\n\n- Don't do the same routine every week. Plan your fast running so there's change and improvement--the rest time between runs gets a little shorter, your speed gets a little quicker, or the run gets a little longer. (But only change one of these things at a time.)\n\n- Do fast running almost all the time, not just for getting ready in the spring.\n\n- Don't go back to just running and find yourself at the beginning again. Add some fast running to your week for most of the year. \n\n#### Part 11\n\n#### Ouch, That's Painful!\n\nIf you ask many people why they think runners get hurt, they might say that it's because they run too much. It seems clear: Runners get hurt most often because they use their legs too much--in other words, because they run too much.\n\nEven though it's true that running can make injuries happen or make them worse, I think it's not right to say all injuries from running are just from too much running. There are many other things involved. As we've read earlier in the book, running the right way so that each step is soft can keep you from getting hurt. So can being bendy, warming up the right way, running without tension, wearing the right shoes, and not running on hard and uneven ground.\n\nAlso, many injuries that runners get actually start from things that are not running that have already put strain on or unbalanced the body--like carrying a heavy bag, sitting at a computer or digging in the garden--rather than from running itself. Even the real injuries from running that do happen sometimes come more from running too little than from running too much or too fast. More often, it's not fast running that causes injuries: It's taking breaks.\n\nI can say that I used a lot of my practice time to become fit and strong enough to exercise well, without feeling sore and stiff.\n\nBut when I got to that goal and had the fitness needed to train at that level, I hardly ever got hurt. And it wasn't because I was practicing lightly. I would often be doing a lot of running each week, with lots of quick, hard sessions--and races, too. But, once fit, I would recover quickly, and I wouldn't get hurt unless I did something silly like falling down, wearing the wrong shoes, running on a slope, or not warming up and stretching right.\n\nThat's different from what most people think, which is that training too much causes injuries. But in my case, my injuries usually didn't come from doing too much running or speedwork but instead from coming back from a time of rest--especially after I had to take a week or so off because of being sick. I was careful not to come back too fast. But the problem was that, during the sickness, I would get stiff from sitting or lying down too much, and I found I would lose flexibility, muscle strength, balance, timing, and so on as a result. Running even at a steady pace after these problems often seemed to result in small aches and pains, which could easily lead to injuries.\n\nAnd that's true of many people who play sports. Maybe during a break, they didn't keep doing their normal stretch routine. Almost for sure, they've lost a bit of muscle. They're still in very good shape, though, and they come back and tell themselves, 'Wow, I'm fast! I'll try and catch up with the practice I've missed.' But somehow it doesn't work out: They are still strong enough to hurt themselves.\n\nPracticing, you see, is like being on a moving walkway: If you have to get off for any reason, it's hard to get back on.\n\nIt's been said that it's easy to care for yourself when you're healthy and practicing well, but what makes a true winner is how you care for yourself when you're hurt. I would say more, and say the real key to practicing regularly is how you care for yourself to stop getting hurt from the start.\n\nListen to what Matthew, a big winner of a tough race says about it: 'The most successful player will be the one that practices most regularly without getting hurt or sick.'\n\nYou're much better off if you practice regularly than if you practice really well for a bit, get hurt, and have to start over. You want to get used to your practice and get strong enough to practice harder. It's regular practice that leads to big jumps.\n\nLuckily, there are ways you can help yourself. If you're a regular runner, you've probably been hurt at some point. You may know why you got hurt. Maybe you didn't prepare well, or you came back to play too fast after a break. And you feel sad that you could have stopped the hurt.\n\n##### STAYING SAFE\n\nI think most hurts can be stopped. Unless you slip and twist a foot or a leg--and that does happen--most long runners' hurts, unlike those of fast runners, do not happen right away. They happen slowly and give us lots of warning. If you learn to see the early signs, and how to know what's causing the trouble, you'll get hurt a lot less.\n\nLike all of running, staying safe is a skill, even a kind of art. When you're feeling good, it's easy to just go on without ever thinking about staying safe. But learning to stay safe is part of becoming a good runner. A smart runner pays attention to their body, sees the first sign of trouble, and does something to stop it from becoming a big hurt.\n\nAlso, taking care of yourself when you're not hurt is important. Run right--tall, relaxed, and balanced. And run on soft places whenever you can.\n\nI've talked about running right in most of this book and talked a lot about it in chapter 3. Running well is important. It helps you save energy, stay fit, and not get hurt. Here are some tips to help you not get hurt.\n\nTry not to run on your heels. It can make your knees, hips, and back hurt. Your heel can't take a lot of shock. Instead, use your whole foot to take in shock, like when you run on the spot.\n\nAll your movements should be forward and backward, not side to side. Being balanced is very important. If you are not balanced, you can get hurt. Even if you have a small blister and it makes you limp, it can lead to a big injury.\n\nIt's easy to run in a not straight way without knowing it. I often see people run with their heads to one side or one shoulder or arm higher than the other. They feel balanced, but they are not. They need someone else to tell them what's wrong and how to fix it. If they always run on the left side of a track, they might lean to the left even when running straight. But this can also happen if you always sit at an angle in front of a computer or carry a bag on one shoulder. Not many people are equally strong and balanced on each side, and running can make these differences bigger so that they get hurt.\n\nI had problems with my hip when I was young, maybe because I used to cycle to school with a heavy bag on my left shoulder (it didn't feel good on the right), and maybe from running around left-hand turns on the track. And my coach, Ben, noticed that my left arm was low. He'd tell me to lift it or lower my right arm. But by then I'd lost my balance, my arms still wouldn't be the same, and my shoulders wouldn't be the same either.\n\nSo I would ask my friends to help me. 'I know I'm running not straight', I'd say, 'but I can't tell if I'm leaning to one side or one shoulder's higher than the other or my arms are the same. Can you watch me when I'm running and tell me what I need to do to be balanced?'\n\nAnd they'd say, 'Up a little, down a little.' And it wouldn't feel right to me but they'd say, 'No, that's right!' And I would feel that I was running better, but I still wouldn't _feel_ balanced. It took time and focus to get my balance back.\n\nAnother way to not get hurt is to try not to run on roads--especially if they are not flat--if you can. Run on paths in the woods, on dirt roads, and on play yards. This can be harder than running on flat ground, but you'll get stronger and healthier, too. \n\n##### SHOES FOR RUNNING\n\nPicking the right shoes to run in can be hard. There are many kinds, but not all of them will be good for you.\n\nWhen your foot touches the ground, it should soften the fall, and when it lifts off, it should push off like a spring. This needs good timing and strength, especially if you're doing it over and over for a long time. Some shoes can stop your feet from doing this right, and this can hurt you. \n\nYou need shoes that help your feet move right. They should soften the fall a bit, but too much can be a problem. When you get tired, it can be harder to keep your feet springy, so you'll need your shoes to help more. But if your shoes are too soft, you won't feel the ground well. If the shoes' heels are too thick, your feet will be too high off the ground, and this can make you trip. You could hurt your feet more easily.\n\nSome shoes have very soft heels. Unless you're climbing, it's hard not to land on your heel first. It may feel nice, but it stops your feet from doing their job and makes them less strong. If you run on your heels, you can't use your foot like a spring or a stick. This makes your steps shorter and makes your thighs work harder while your calves are resting, and your hips and bottom feel every step you take.\n\nThe same thing happens with stability--yes, you need some, but be careful not to have too much. You don't want your shoes to be very hard. They need to be soft enough to let you get on your toes when you're running fast or climbing.\n\nFor your feet to work right and push off the front of your feet, your feet need to roll in a bit. But if you roll in too much--if your foot and ankle fall inside when your weight goes over the foot--you shouldn't pick shoes that are so hard that they make you run on the outsides of your feet. Yes, this would control your rolling in, but it would probably move the problem to your knees, hips, or back. It's much better to focus on making your feet stronger (doing foot exercises and using a shaky board) and using shoes to softly support them, instead of holding them in place and making your weight go onto the outsides of your feet.\n\nSo how to pick the right shoes?\n\nIt can be hard. It's not just about how big the shoe is. You also need to think about how heavy the shoe is, how well it stays on your foot, if it's easy to run in, and how wide it is.\n\nDo you need shoes that are straight or curved? Do they feel good on your foot? Do they have soft parts under the front and back of the shoe? Do they have parts that help you move better?\n\nFirst, don't get shoes just because a friend likes them. Everyone is different. You might not like the same shoes as your friend. And don't get a certain shoe just because you liked another shoe from the same company. Shoe companies make many different shoes for many different people. That's a good thing, so try different shoes. But they also always want to be better than other shoe companies. So they often change their shoes a lot.\n\nIf a new pair of shoes changes how you walk, it might hurt your foot.\n\nThe best thing to do is to ask people who know a lot about shoes. They might be able to help you. Some stores might ask you to bring your old shoes. They want to see how you have used them up to understand how you step on your feet. Many stores also have ways to record and see how your feet move when you walk, which can help them suggest a certain shoe. Their help is often very important--but remember, you are the one who has to wear the shoes, and you have to feel good in them. Not just one shoe, but both. And that doesn't mean just walking around the store in them, it means jogging in them, or even better running on the store's machine in them. I have seen many runners who have bought wrong shoes that changed their running style and comfort and led to unnecessary hurts.\n\nAfter you find a pair of shoes that fit, don't keep using them after they've lost their softness and support. Get a new pair before your old pair has used up so you can switch and get used to the new ones slowly. It's always best to have several pairs at once. Changing shoes is as good as a rest, not only for your body, but for your feet too. It's always useful--and sometimes needed--to have different shoes for different grounds and weather.\n\nYou might also hear suggestions to change your shoes after a certain number of steps' worth of use. Again, this type of strict rule is not right. How your shoes show use depends on the type of shoe, the make and thickness of the bottom, the softness system (whether gel, air, wave, etc.Your shoes are important, but it's hard to say when to change them. You can use your fingers to feel the bottom of the shoe. If it's not bouncy or if it's worn out in one place, you need new ones. \n\n##### RUNNING CLOTHES\n\nKeeping warm is very important when you run. Sometimes I see runners in the cold wearing very little. They think they will get warm from running. But I don't think they get warm enough. Their body is warm, but their legs need more clothes. Look after your legs!\n\nI would say it's better to wear too much than too little--especially when it's cold outside. Being warm is good for your body and it helps to prevent getting hurt. I have seen runners wear lots of clothes to warm up, even when it's not very cold. That's because they don't want to get hurt.\n\nPeople who run far aren't like fast runners, and they don't get hurt suddenly. But warm and stretchy muscles work better than cold and stiff ones. I often wore a suit made for running. Sometimes, when it was hot, I only wore shorts and a top. But before running fast, I always wore the suit to get warm. And after, I wore it to cool down. If I were running today, I would wear special tight pants unless it was hot. These pants let you run fast and keep warm---that's good. Then, when you take them off for a race, you feel lighter and cooler. Many times, getting cold after a run can hurt your muscles, not the running itself. So, be sure to get warm and stretch before you run or go fast,and jog a little and stretch to cool down after.\n\nDon't be scared to stop and stretch during a run, too, if you need to. Some people think that once you start running, you can't stop--and you can't let others see you stop. But stopping when you train is not a bad thing! If you need to stop, go ahead--don't feel bad.\n\nStopping to stretch is a good reason: You want to run easily and freely.\n\nAnd after you cool down, put on some warm, dry clothes! Don't stand and talk while your body gets cold and stiff. See how people who take care of horses--and even dogs--care for them after a race. They wrap them in warm covers to keep them cozy and stop them from getting cold or hard. Sometimes we take better care of our animals than we do of ourselves!\n\n##### BE AWARE OF YOUR BODY\n\nWhen something is not right, if you're too tired, or not feeling well, or feel a little ache--STOP! Don't be silly. If you're unsure, do less than you planned. If unsure, skip a workout. If unsure, stop a workout in the middle.\n\nIf you keep going when you shouldn't, you're hurting yourself. You're not making yourself faster with your stubborn will. You're slowing yourself down.\n\nEven so, I think a lot of people are _too_ careful, or as my good friend and training buddy Patrick would say, 'too careful!' You don't have to say, 'Oh no, my heart is beating a bit fast today. That means I'm tired, so I'll skip today's workout.' You know there's nothing wrong with you. You're not hurt. Go out there and exercise!\n\nOf course, like with a lot of running, there's a skill to it. You should not be too brave, but also not too scared. You have to listen to your feelings. If you are not sure after getting ready, stop. Take a rest to practice again another day.\n\n##### CHANGE YOUR SPEED\n\nThree big mistakes made by many runners are: They don't run fast when they practice. All their practice is not easy, it's all medium. And they think running is only about their legs. All these mistakes can cause them to get hurt. And these are often real injuries from doing too much.\n\nI said before that most running problems are not because of doing too much. I still believe that. But, doing too much can cause injuries. And the best way to get them is to not change your speed.\n\nWant to not get hurt? Don't always run at the same speed on the same ground with the same movement and the same style. Running at different speeds is more helpful for practice. And it also helps to not get injuries. And when you try to run fast at the end of a race when you're tired, you don't want it to be something you've never really tried before. To prevent getting hurt, make sure to include some fast practices in your training.\n\nDon't get too excited about going harder and further each day, either, with each week a step up from the one before, just building and building and building. You need simple days, and you need simple weeks. To get better, you need to do a lot and rest a lot. If you don't rest, you'll just feel tired, sick, and hurt. Kids shouldn't see rest time as not doing anything, but as a part of the activities. It's only doing nothing if you have to rest because you're hurt.\n\nAnd what about your upper body power? You don't just run with your legs: Your back, shoulders, arms, and stomach are important for staying upright and steady, and for giving power to your legs. Activities like lifting things, running in the park, and running uphill should all be part of your fun times at certain times of the year. They help make you stronger to run fast. And they help make you tough enough to handle the fun times.\n\nI believe that daily life can be riskier than running. Often, the things you do when you're not playing, which is most of your life, can cause hurts that you only feel when you run.\n\nIf you always carry a bag on the same shoulder or in the same hand, that can make one side of your back tighter than the other. And what about driving, always using your left leg to change gears? A problem in your back can cause leg problems when you try to run.\n\nIt's the same for mums who always carry their babies on their left hips because they're right-handed, or for people who sit at a slant from the computer all day, or who spend a lot of time holding the phone to their ears with their shoulders, or stand on one leg and lean against the bar.\n\nThe list is very long. It even has some games. Tennis is a game that uses one arm, and it may not be good to play it and run at the same time. The same goes for cricket. People get sore backs from moving snow off the driveway or working in the garden, or painting the ceiling with one arm reaching high. And maybe the hardest thing of all is lifting kids in and out of back car seats. It's hard to stay away from, but be careful!\n\nPeople are often very tense without knowing it. If you asked everyone to stop what they were doing and relax, would their hands be relaxed? Their elbows? Their shoulders?\n\n'Oh, no', they'll say, 'I didn't know I was still tense there!'\n\nThat's just normal life. Just try to be aware of it, and every now and then take a big breath, sigh, and see if you can relax yourself.\n\nAnd small things when you're running can make you lose balance and lead to big problems. Even a small blister or a broken toenail can make you walk funny and step differently on that foot.\n\nSame with slopes: Don't always run on the same side of the road. Change sides now and then, at the very least. Even better: Try to run in the middle of the road, if it's a quiet country road with not much traffic. I used to run on the roads a lot in the evenings around the different places where I lived. It would be so dark I couldn't even see the side of the road. But if a car was coming, I could easily see its lights. So it was perfectly safe running in the middle of the road, where it was flat, not tilted. And I figured I was probably less likely to step in a hole, as well.\n\nThe thing about not being balanced is that it creates problems elsewhere, especially when you run. In my experience many leg hurts, like knee, calf, and heel problems, start elsewhere--either above or below the place of the actual hurt. Unless you've hit your leg or twisted it, the problems almost always come from the back, hips, and bottom down, or from the feet and ankles up, which in turn is often due to the way you step on each foot. And that's mostly controlled by the strength and flexibility of your back, the balance of your hips and middle part--and, of course, the shoes you're wearing.\n\nI'm not saying that runners are such well-prepared horses that they haven't got the strength to deal with the smallest thing that makes them unbalanced. But be aware of what you're doing. Change the bag from one shoulder to the other. Change the baby from one hip to the other. Keep good posture, whether standing, sitting, walking, or working. Don't always cross your legs the same way. And stop holding the toy phone to your ear with your shoulder. Knowing about balance in all of these everyday games can help you avoid getting hurt.\n\n##### WHEN HURTS DO HAPPEN\n\nDespite our best tries, we players do get hurt sometimes. Sometimes there are surprise falls. You can trip on a small wall or twist an ankle. I hurt myself falling a couple of times. Sammy famously tripped over a can of cola once and twisted an ankle. Steve never seemed to get hurt until he got tangled up with some fence--and from then on he was never quite the same again.\n\nOther hurts aren't due to falls so much as laziness or not paying attention. Maybe you think a tight leg muscle will just get better on its own, but instead it slowly leads to a red and swollen heel cord. Or you might try to wear your favorite pair of shoes that have lost their shape and softness, and end up with a leg or knee hurt.\n\nSurely playing is not risk free. You cannot always avoid bumps. Cross country, for all its good parts, can lead to twists and strains--not to mention sore heels--as I know very well! Your leg muscles may complain, especially the day after a race, if you were having to pull your feet out of the mud with every step.\n\nWhen a hurt does happen, the most important thing is to stay happy. Don't be sad. I know it's hard when you can't play anymore. You may want to just sit and watch some games on TV.\n\nBut if you start thinking that you can't play as well as before, that's not good. You're only thinking about things you can't change.\n\nInstead, think about what you _can_ do. That's the fun part. There's usually something you can do to feel better faster.\n\nTaking care of yourself when you're hurt is a big job. It's funny, it's like finding out that looking for a job is a big job. You might have to work harder when you're looking for a job than when you have one.\n\nAnd it's the same with playing. If you're healthy and training two times a day, you might be spending one or two hours playing every day. And everything's fine.\n\nBut when you're hurt, don't let someone else do everything. You need to spend time taking care of your injury, putting on cold packs, stretching a lot, doing special exercises, maybe going to the doctor, and maybe going to the pool or the gym so you can stay fit. Doing more things can take longer than your usual play time when you're feeling well. But, it could be what helps you become a good runner instead of just an okay one.\n\nA running hurt is not like a sniffles or a tummy ache, where you just sit and rest and wait for things to get better. Just because you think doing too much caused it, which may not be true, don't think doing less will fix it. Getting better takes effort.\n\nEven if you've just got a small pain and you're planning to keep running, still look after it. Cool it often, maybe even two or three times a day. Rub it to help the blood flow. And please, cover it up, and keep it warm--both when you're running and when you're not.\n\nIt can be hard to know whether or not to run when you're hurt. When you've played too much, maybe in a big field or a hard road race, you're bound to get some soreness. When that happens, a lot of people will tell you to just run it off. Well, sometimes that works and sometimes it doesn't. Often after a hard race, both of my legs would be sore. Nice slow runs would often make one leg feel better and the other worse. So what do you do? Like a lot of running, taking care of yourself and getting yourself better is about feeling and thinking and often comes down to knowing and understanding your own body.\n\nOne simple idea is this: Don't walk funny. Walking funny won't help you at all, and will only create more issues. But if your little ache feels better as you move and you're able to move without walking funny, that's good. Just go a little bit, and stop before you do too much. If it doesn't feel good, stop and walk back. There's no reason to push it; you'll just make it worse. Either way, keep caring for it with ice, rubbing it yourself, stretching, wrapping it tight, and by keeping it warm.\n\nA person who helps athletes with massage can find issues and fix them before you're aware of them and before they turn into bigger issues. And anyway massage makes you loose and helps you relax so you can move more easily.\n\nI found this was really helpful when I was competing. Usually before every big race, say four or five times a summer, I would get a massage on my back and legs. It was part of the getting ready; it had nothing to do with being hurt. It was to help me feel looser and move faster and stop issues. I found it most helpful to have a massage two or three days before the race. And I'd often have one a few days after the race as well, because I found that really helped me recover.\n\nI am now a person who helps athletes with massage myself, and almost always when people come to me for help, whatever their pain or issue, the reason comes from their back. A lot of people have tight feelings in their shoulders. Their backs feel heavy too, from lifting their legs when they run. But you can't stop this from happening when you run.\n\nStill, runners' backs are often weak and hard to move. This means their backs bend backwards, and their tummies might stick out a bit more. This makes it hard to lift and move their legs, which makes running right, like riding a bike, hard. Their feet hit the ground harder, causing them to shake and sometimes even get small cracks in their bones.\n\nThis is where a person who gives sports massages can help a lot. Because if you get rid of the tight feeling in your shoulders and the hard-to-move feeling in your back, that relaxed feeling can spread to your whole body. You'll feel better, you'll find it easier to breathe, and you'll feel more bounce in your steps when you run. Even standing still will feel nicer.\n\nIf it's good to see a person who gives sports massages when you're feeling okay, it's even more important to see one - or a body doctor - when you're hurt. As I've said, a lot of leg hurts come from other places, maybe a part of your body that doesn't feel hurt at all.\n\nI've helped many runners who have told me they have a problem with their heel--but nearly always they've had a problem with their calf first, and they think the calf has gotten better. But the calf isn't working well and may have lost some of its stretchiness, making the heel cord work harder. The problem with the calf might also change how the foot moves and stands, and running makes it worse and can start to hurt the heel cord. This makes the covering around the heel cord swell, which is how nature protects it. When the heel cord swells, it can be very painful, and it takes a long time to get better because it doesn't get a lot of blood, and it's tough to rest it. Standing, walking, and even driving can make it more painful.\n\nThe runners feel pain in their heel cord. But the first problem often comes from the calf, and that's the real problem that needs to be treated. And often that can be traced back to how the foot lands. And that goes back to the back, hips, and the pelvis being not straight, often making one leg seem longer than the other, and this causes a little limp, or a similar effect to running on a slope.\n\nOr let's say your knee hurts a lot and you don't know why. The cause might be tightness in the ITB--the band on the outside of your thigh--which is pulling the kneecap a little off-center, making it move wrong. If that's the problem, you can put ice on your knees forever, but unless you find the source of the problem, you won't get any real relief from just treating the pain. Sometimes problems need someone who knows a lot to fix them. It might be something you just can't fix by yourself.\n\nLet's look at the \"ITB\" again; it's something that often makes your knee hurt. Well, fixing it is easy, right? You just need to do some stretches. Yes, there are stretches for the \"ITBs\": You'll find a few good ones in chapter 5. But sometimes the problem is a small knot in the middle of the muscle. When you do your stretches, you'll often only stretch the parts that are already loose while the knot in the middle stays the same.\n\nYou need someone who knows a lot to find the knot and give it a good, firm kneading, maybe getting the thumbs in there a bit to break the knot down. You might soon find your knee feels much better.\n\nSome parts that get hurt have poor blood flow. As people who give massages, we try to increase the blood flow, to help healing where there might be knots, muscle spasms, or hurt muscle fibres.\n\nIn short, people who give massages try to relax the muscles, squeeze them, and loosen them. It's a bit like gently making a steak softer. The muscle tone, elasticity, and blood flow are much better when the muscle has been made softer.\n\nSkeletal imbalance is another example of a problem that can hurt other parts. The not feeling right might be because of how you stand, or it might be that the back and the hard part of the body is a little bit not straight. The hard parts can move a little, especially in the feet and--especially after a fall--in the lower body and back.\n\nIf the back is made straight again, the muscles can often become calm and loose. The tightness they've had from been held in the wrong way has been made calm. Suddenly you can hold yourself the right way and your body can work well again. So sport rub and bone doctor are very good together.\n\nAnd you can sometimes get the same kind of feelings--in terms of calming, making right, and maybe even making more energy--through a treatment with thin needles. I know kids tend to not believe it. And I didn't, too.\n\nThe first time I went to see a needle treatment doctor was almost by accident. He had learned to be a body doctor, and Adam, my regular body doctor, had told me I go to him, as I had been sent to LI city with the air team.\n\n'He's a great body doctor, but he's changed a bit', Adam told me. 'He does needle treatment now. Just don't let him put any needles in you!'\n\nWell, within two minutes of going through the door, I had needles in me! I can remember thinking, 'Oh, no, what have I done?' But it turned out to be a great help and didn't hurt at all, and I've been happy with regular helpings ever since.\n\nMany helpers give very good helpings with their hands, but hands can't always be as exact as a small stick.\n\nThat's one of the best things about this special helping--how exact it is. It's the way the small sticks are put that makes it work so well. You can have 10 or 15 small sticks in you and then the helper puts that last one in and you just know it's in just the right spot. You can feel the nice feeling. It's like the happy feeling of finally scratching an itch: 'Oh, yes, that's the spot!'\n\nAs with all these helpings, it's not just the helping, it's the helper that makes it work. Anyone can give you a rub. Anyone can move your body around. Anyone can put small sticks in you. What matters is how well they've been taught and whether they make the right check and give the right helping. You can learn about stick techniques for taking away hurt in two weeks, or you can learn for a full three years. There's a small difference.\n\nGet advice, whether from other runners or from other professionals. And if the people you're going to see are runners themselves, that's even better. They'll know just what runners need, and it's not the same as a doctor's common advice to rest and come back in a few weeks if it's not better.\n\n##### SURGERY--A LAST CHOICE\n\nThere's no doubt that surgery has helped many people, from Kevin, the double gold medal winner, to Penelope, the women's world record-holder in running, and many other athletes.\n\nI remember a great place just outside SE town, near LO city, called the FA park Health Centre. It was a place where you would go after a big injury--often involving an operation--and follow a full-time health programme. Absolutely great. The main man there, Dr. Jack, was a sports injuries expert and a pioneer of foot operations.\n\nIn a time long ago, I had hurt an ankle which had been put in a plaster cast for a few weeks. And I was lucky enough to go to FA park for my health. I couldn't run at all for three weeks after getting out of the cast. The ankle had become very stiff that at first it was hard even to walk. But the place had a great full-time programme that, over a period of several weeks, took you from beginner to advanced level as your health improved, finishing with very hard training. By the time you left, you were super-fit. Running was hard for some weeks, but I could do other things like foot exercises, pedal work, bike a puzzle and get twice daily treatments.\n\nIn the end, I could jump, play ball games, and run. It was a good lesson of how getting fully fit needs effort, not just rest and treatments. Six weeks after leaving FP park, I was on the EN team and running well again.\n\nI saw there that operations can help people who thought they could never play again. But it carries dangers and should not be done without thinking.\n\nAnother patient there at that time was a girl named Alice who won the school race in the late 20th century, the same year I won a longer race. We both competed in the school international in DB city, but I hadn't seen her since then. Although she'd run quite well, she had hurt her heel and just been to Doctor William for an operation. It had been a great success.\n\nShe was so happy with the result that she thought it would save her time to have the other one operated right away, instead of getting fit again, and then needing a second operation (which she thought would happen) in a few months. Even though there was no problem, Charlotte chose to have a second operation. She thought this could help her avoid future foot problems.\n\nIt's hard to understand why she thought this or why Doctor David agreed. But the second operation didn't go well. It got sick and caused many problems. And I don't think she was able to run properly again. What a loss of talent!\n\nSo, operations are only okay as a last choice. But _only_ if necessary. Try to avoid the operation if you can!\n\n##### FIND OTHER WAYS TO STAY HEALTHY\n\nWhen you can't run because of a hurt, still try to exercise. If you want to be a good runner, don't lose all your hard work. Stay healthy by doing other things. Almost always, you can still swim. Some runners have told me they don't like it, they can't swim, and so on. But it makes you breathe hard, it moves the blood around, and it's very helpful. You don't have to be _good_ at it. In fact, if you're not good, you'll breathe harder. And that should be one of your main goals--finding something that makes your heart beat fast and makes you breathe hard.\n\nI would avoid doing the breast stroke too much, because that can make your neck and shoulders very tense, and the kick can bother your groin and knees. But swimming on your belly or on your back is really good for you. And if you can't do them, learn! There are many swim classes out there.\n\nI think that swimming is much better than just doing water-running, where you're trying to run without your feet touching the ground. Water-running is OK, I guess, but it seems pretty sad to me. It's hard work, and you're not moving anywhere. But swimming can be fun; you can see improvement. It helps you stretch. And it will make you work just as hard as, if not harder than, water-running.\n\nOften if you have leg hurts, you can still do arm work in the gym to keep your strength up without hurting your injury more.\n\nAlso, you might still be able to ride a bike. I clearly couldn't swim while my foot was in a hard cover, so I tried a bit of biking in an effort to keep the heart and lung fitness that I had.\n\nI managed to borrow a bike from a friend. I'd wrap a plastic bag around the hard cover to keep it dry, and off I'd go. Not for long rides, just a few one- or two-minute tries, so that it was like the practices I might have been doing had I been able to run.\n\nAnd this was in the dark, up at CR place. Looking back, I must have been a bit silly--it was not a good idea. My foot didn't feel good when I had a hard cover on it! I could have fallen from the bike and hurt myself more. A bike that doesn't move in the gym would have been a better idea. But my goal was to keep my blood moving and to keep breathing hard so I wouldn't lose my strength, and that's what I did.\n\nYou don't have to do what I did, but no matter what, don't just sit and be sad. Do something to keep moving. Walk, swim, or go to the gym. Even playing table tennis can help you stay active.\n\nBe careful: After you get hurt, don't try to train too much too soon. Go back to running slowly to avoid more trouble.\n\nIn general, I would say you should run slowly for a week or 10 days before you start doing harder things. But if you are trying to get strong for a race, you might have to do this faster. It depends on how long you've stopped running and how much strength you've lost.\n\nIf you can avoid getting hurt as much as possible, and take good care of yourself when you do get hurt, you'll lose less time to injuries and be a better sportsman. Soon, you'll feel good again--that good feeling--that running without getting hurt can give you in a big way.\n\n##### IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW\n\n- To run well, train regularly. When you're feeling good, work on preventing hurts and taking care of small problems.\n\n- Run in shoes that help your feet feel stable and comfy. The shoes should be good for your running style.\n\n- Run right--stand tall, be relaxed, and balanced. Try to run on soft places when you can.\n\n- Wear comfy clothes. Keep your muscles and joints warm, before, during, and after your running.\n\n- Always warm up and always cool down. And stretch before and after your running.\n\n- Be smart. If you're not sure, do less than you planned. If you're not sure, skip a running day. If you're not sure, stop running halfway through.\n\n- Don't think running faster will cause more hurts. Change your running speed. Don't just jog; run fast sometimes. But remember to have easy days and easy weeks.\n\n- Notice what you do when you're not running. Regular things that make you use one side more than the other can make you unbalanced, and being unbalanced can cause hurts.\n\n- Take care of even your small hurts instead of just hoping they'll get better.\n\n- If a hurt really bothers you, don't ignore it. See a person who knows how to help, like a massage person, physiotherapist, osteopath, or acupuncturist.\n\n- When you can't run because of hurt, still try to move if you can. Swim, ride a bike, walk, or go to a place with lots of things to play--do anything to make your heart and lungs work. Keep yourself fit for when you can run again.\n\n#### Chapter 12\n\n#### All in Your Mind\n\nRunning is a lot like an art. You must listen to your body, pushing it hard but also paying attention to when it needs rest. You need to get good at moving and balancing, timing and rhythm. You must be able to try your hardest while staying fully relaxed.\n\nAnd yet in some ways it's easy to get your body ready to run your best. As we've talked about, there are lots of ways to get better at the five Ss--speed, strength, staying power, suppleness, and skill--even though not everyone will become a great runner like Adam, Gabriel, or Benjamin.\n\nBut now we come to the sixth thing--mind--a part perhaps more important than any of the others. Here the need for artistry is greater still: No one gets it right all the time. But the best players have the knack and skill of focusing, concentrating, and getting it right on the day that matters.\n\nTo some extent, strange as it may seem, I don't think your very best mind performance can be reached on purpose. The best we can do is to learn about ourselves as individuals and try to create the conditions that will let our want to do well, relaxation, focus, and determination to fully come out on the day it matters most.\n\nSure, our brains are amazing. When I won the Big Run, I was healthy and fast--that's clear. But to win so quickly, running faster than very good runners, something else had to help. Or was I just not trying hard enough before?\n\nThink about a great jump by an AM country named Bob at the Big Games in a city. For many years, the world record in the long jump had been broken little by little. On that special day, Bob broke it by a lot--much more than he thought he could and more than the rulers could measure.\n\nWe hear about things like this every day. In a month in 2009, a man in a place saw a girl trapped under a big car and lifted the car off her. The man told people that he tried lifting cars after that to see what would happen. Guess what--it didn't work. His brain wasn't ready for him to do that again.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that _all of us_ can do much more than we think if we use our brains well. It's hard to say why this happens. When I won the big race, I was a bit upset because I was not picked for a big sports event and happy that I could run again after hurting my foot. I don't know what was in the head of a man far away in KA city. And who knows what Adam was thinking.\n\nBut we can do a lot to make our minds stronger, to be ready and excited on the day of the race.\n\nEvery time you practice, you train your mind. If you miss a practice or don't finish, you start to think you can't reach your goals. This can be bad over time.\n\nOn the other hand, every time you finish a practice, every small thing you do well, makes you feel good and sure. This is really true when running outside is hard and you're not sure you can make it up a big hill without stopping--but you do it in the end. Each time you practice, you're getting ready to either stop or keep going. It's much better to keep going. If you said you're going to do it, then do it. If it's in your plan, finish it.\n\nIt's easy to feel bad about your family and work. You might think people see you as too serious or only thinking about yourself. But you must remember, even if you do other things, you still need to keep your promises to yourself. That's important.\n\nSometimes, your friends at school might ask you to play during your study time. Sometimes, you might look at the rainy weather and think about not going outside. But if you skip your study time, it can become a big problem. You don't want to get used to quitting or choosing the easy way.\n\nInstead, you want to think: '_I'm a smart kid_. I'm stronger than that. If it's raining, it's okay. If it's snowing, it's okay. I'm going to study.'\n\nOf course, if you're not feeling well or the weather is very bad, you don't have to study exactly what you planned. Change it. Your main goal is to do something good for you. But at least by studying, you're being strong and disciplined. You'll feel better about yourself. Go for it!\n\nWhen a big test is coming, you might start focusing more, especially on the morning of the test day. I remember, even from my earliest days at school, if I had a test on Monday, I'd start to feel excited, even a little nervous, on Sunday afternoon. A little bit of worry can be good.\n\nI don't mean being so worried you can't do anything. But being a bit worried means you care about the race, and that's part of the game. You _want_ it to matter a bit. If you have a funny feeling because your team needs you, or because you think you can do something really special--something better than you've ever done before--that's great.\n\nBut being worried and being upset are two different things. I think we've all had races where things didn't go right--maybe there were too many cars or the train was late. Maybe your car stopped working on the way to the race. Maybe you had trouble finding a parking spot, and when you got where you needed to be, you couldn't find the bathroom or figure out where to get your number.\n\nI know I've had some race days like that. And worrying about whether you'll be on time for the start takes something out of you. It uses up energy, takes away from your focus, and shakes your confidence.\n\nSometimes these things can't be avoided. But to do your best physically, you really need to be organised and relaxed mentally, but also ready for the race. Cool, calm, collected, and confident--that's the Sam combo. If you're not organised, you can end up feeling tense and shaky. It's sad to practice so much and not be able to do your best.\n\nThink about what you want to do. When you start to feel scared, remember to stay calm. Take a big breath and focus on being calm. Be ready to change your plan if you can't do your usual routine before the big race.\n\nBeing ready for a race is important. You have to try to be ready. But I don't know if thinking about winning the race like some people say is good. If you're getting ready to run a big race in \"LO city\", I don't think it helps to imagine yourself winning the race, like in a dream. I don't think that makes sense.\n\nBut I think you do need to think about what you're going to do before and during the race. Plan when, and what, you're going to eat. Imagine where you're going to get ready and when and where you're going to stretch and practice. And plan where you're going to leave your bag and clothes. This can help you stay calm and organized.\n\nFor the race, it is important to have a plan, and not just see how it goes. You can imagine what you're going to do in a game, or what you're going to do if someone else does something first. You can think about what you think others might do, and how to respond to them. It's good to think about what you want to do in important parts of the game, and to remember previous games where you did things right (do those again) or wrong (don't do those again). Get ready in your mind for the game by practicing how you expect to feel at certain important parts: Think of where you'll have to try to keep your focus and not let yourself get distracted.\n\nFocusing is a big part of being strong in your mind. I used to practice in my mind how I would react to what other people might do in a game--or how I would avoid doing the same wrong things again. I'd ask myself, 'Why did Kevin win last time?' I let him get a little ahead and thought it didn't matter because he was only a little bit ahead, and I thought I'd have time to catch up. But, as it often happens, I was just a little too slow. You have to get ready to react fast, not just when you feel like it.\n\nSo I would tell myself as I focused on the game ahead: It's very important to react fast! Don't wait! Don't doubt yourself! Go with your friend! Be quick. And _that's_ the part I tried to make clear in my mind. That's where you can win or lose. Not when you finish and wave to your friends!\n\nDon't think about the race too much, though. In many games, from throwing darts to jumping high, if you try too hard, you might not do well.\n\nSome people get too worried, and that stops them. For you to do well, things should be smooth. Look at Tom. When he was 13 years old, he won a big diving game in Britain. Soon after, he won gold in a big game in Europe. And later that summer, when he was 14, he did well in a big game in BE city.\n\nHe doesn't have time to think: He just has to do well. This is true for people who run, too.\n\nSo, you should get ready in your mind to be happy but calm. Everyone is different in what they need to do this. Some people talk a lot, some people joke, some don't talk at all. Some people want to be with many friends, others need to be alone. Some feel they need to walk while others like to lie down.\n\nThe trick is getting to know yourself--how you react to different things and what works for _you_. Some of the boys I raced with liked watching a movie about a strong man before a race to get excited. Really. Often, certain songs can help get you in the right mood. For me before the Big Race, it was the music from a band--especially and very fittingly, as it turned out, the song 'Skate Song'. And the English middle-distance runner Katherine used to pick a favorite song that would be her theme for a meet and listen to it over and over. For the Big Games, she chose 'If I Don't Have You', by a singer. It might not have worked for me, but she won first place in both the short and the long race--becoming only the third girl ever to do that--so it worked for her.\n\nAnd look at the actions of the amazing runner Benjamin. Before races, he's full of energy. He talks a lot and is a performer. Maybe some of that is meant to scare other runners. If I acted like that, I'd lose focus and wouldn't feel good at all. But look at his results: Three first place medals and a world record in the short race says it all.\n\nBut usually long-distance runners think very differently than short-distance runners. My habit was to be more focused on myself. Definitely, you should try to make sure you're in your own comfortable place, and not made to feel not good by the actions of others. When I was younger, I used to spend a lot of time with David and Bob. We would go to races together. This was good for me, but it wasn't what I really wanted. I learned that I needed to do things my own way. I needed to be by myself sometimes.\n\nThis is the same for many athletes. For example, a girl from RU city who is really good at jumping over a pole -- she's won two big prizes -- puts a towel over her head to think and get ready before she jumps.\n\nI didn't sit quietly with a towel over my head before a race. I was usually quiet, but I didn't just sit and do nothing. A long time ago, I used to see a doctor who was a bit strange. He said he could help very sick people get better just by thinking about it. He tried to teach me how to relax and use my brain in a special way. He said this could help me do better in my races. If an athlete can think in a certain way, they can feel relaxed but also ready to go. Maybe that's what we call being 'in the zone.'\n\nThe way to do this might be a bit tricky for me. But a doctor, let's call him David, told me to find a quiet place. I could lie down there and try to relax my body. When my body was relaxed, I could think about the race. I could think about how brave I needed to be, what my plan was, how I would deal with the other runners, and things like that.\n\nIt's hard to say if this helps or not. But when I did it, it seemed to make things better for me. The problem is that it's not easy to find a good place to do it. It's not good if the only place is in the rain, or on a hard wooden seat in the gym where everyone's walking around. Or in a big competition, in the room where the athletes are waiting, with lots of nervous people looking at each other.\n\nSo, no matter how you like to get ready, it's quite important not to be upset if you can't do it the way you usually do. I've known people who think, 'Oh no, I haven't had my favourite food! I can't run until I've had my breakfast cereal!' Sometimes you have to change your plans and keep things simple. It's not a big problem. Go with what's happening. Do the best you can with what you have.\n\nEveryone is different, so there are no fixed rules. You have to get to know yourself. Before the game, you want to feel calm, focused, and in control. You should be a little excited and looking forward to having fun.\n\nHow you act is important, both before and during a game. If you're tired during a game, try not to show it. If you look tired, it might make others happy, but if you look strong, it can make them feel less confident. Remember, they are probably feeling just as tired as you are. And if you show them that you're doing okay, they might start to slow down. When that happens, you'll start to feel much better.\n\nAlso, if you run like you're in trouble, it doesn't help. If your teeth are tight, your neck is stiff, your arms are tight, and you can't breathe well, you're making it more difficult for yourself. You'll do much better if you stay strong and keep going even when it's hard. The best players make it look so easy, right? Believe me, they are usually very good at hiding how they really feel.\n\nDavid won the Big Running Race five times in a row, from a long time ago to a bit later. And for at least one of those races, he was not feeling great. Yet that year he still beat Frank, a very good runner and future star. And Frank was feeling good at the time.\n\nI didn't go to that race, but I know David. Before the race, he was acting funny, like he was making a joke. And no matter what he felt during the race, he hid it. When you are as scary as David was and you don't look like you're hurting, that can make even a runner like Benjamin feel bad. \n\nDavid said after the race that he should not have won it. This shows that being physically strong isn't everything: How you act during a race is important too. Your mental strength, your pride--you can call it being too proud--shows in how you move and can help you beat runners who should be faster than you. And sometimes, remembering past races can help when you're not feeling strong. Like in a card game, the player with the best cards doesn't always win.\n\nIf you can hide your pain from others, you might be able to hide it from yourself too. Your outward confidence can creep into your inner thoughts and cheer you up. That way, you'll have a better chance of getting past the hard part until your running becomes smooth again. But always, when you're in pain, go back to the basics. You're not trying to put in more effort, but more skill. What you need is to get back your control, balance, and timing. Good technique will help you through a tough time.\n\nThe aim is to be healthy in body and mind: That's when you can do something amazing. So be brave, and cheer yourself on. Because you've shown in practice and in those hard field races that you are persistent and have grit, and you can do it. Believe that if it's hurting you it's not so bad, because it's hurting everyone else, too. Maybe they're hurting even more than you are.\n\nYou can feel good seeing other people struggling. Not in a mean way, but it's good to know other people find the race as tough--or maybe tougher--than you do. There might be times when someone passes you and you think, wow, he's doing really good. But keep going, because five minutes later, you may be passing him if he's tried too hard and stumbled. And that's a great feeling that can make you feel better and help you move faster.\n\nThe issue with quitting once is that it makes it easier to quit again. I've seen that happen often, with kids and adults. One year, they'll be awesome. Then the next year they'll leave a race--maybe for a real reason, like sickness, fever, or something. But having let themselves quit once, the risk is that they will do it again and again.\n\nI remember a boy named Gabriel, a really good young runner. He was the fastest one year. But he started to quit some races the next year, and then it became rare for him to finish a race.\n\n'How long will Gabriel stay in the race tonight?' his friends would ask before the race.\n\nAnd after not seeing his name in the race results, they'd say, 'I thought Gabriel was racing.'\n\n'He was', someone would answer, 'He must have quit again!'\n\nBecause for some time Gabriel kept quitting. He was so used to quitting, he felt really bad, and he expected to lose as soon as the race got hard.\n\nMaybe the first time, he was really sick, and he had to quit. But if that was the case, he shouldn't have been in the race at all. Racing became sad for him because everybody knew that, when it got hard, he'd quit.\n\nThat's why you shouldn't start a race thinking, 'Well, I'll try again and just see if it works out tonight.' You don't want quitting to be a choice. You want it to be something you can't even think of--you've never done it before, and you're not going to do it now. Just like when you practice, you're learning to either give up or keep going. You want to become strong by finishing your exercises, the same way you want to finish your races, to show yourself you can do it even when it's tough.\n\nMaybe if you need to quit a race, it's okay if it's a very long race. The best example of not giving up was my friend David's run in a big race in \"ST city\" years ago.\n\nHe was expected to win because he had won many times in \"CH city\" and \"LO city\". On a hot day, perhaps too sure of himself, he started very fast and, far into the race, he was way ahead of everyone else. But he had trouble with his water, got thirsty, and ended up--bravely but without success--in 20th place. Sometimes, especially in a very long race, it might be better to quit and try again another time.\n\nIt's strange: Sometimes the hardest thing isn't going fast, it's changing the pace you've been keeping. You feel like you should be able to go faster. But you feel like you're stuck. A slower pace can be hard to break.\n\nSometimes, something happens in the race to snap you out of your sleepiness. Otherwise, you need to figure out how to wake up--maybe by getting a bit upset, or maybe by just making yourself do it.\n\nThis can happen to anyone. I remember once in a big running race when I was racing against Samuel. It was a long race, and for the first half, I was having a tough time keeping up with him. In the end, I just couldn't: In the next part, he ran much faster than me. With a part of the race left, I was losing. He was far away from me, and I was almost ready to give up.\n\nBut then something happened. Suddenly I found my speed and timing and began to run smoothly. It was almost like finding the right speed. Running faster with less effort! What a great feeling! Samuel wasn't slowing down but I was getting closer. And I thought, This is getting fun! I might still catch him!' It turned out to be a very fun race. I caught him with a little bit of race left and--for once--managed to run faster than a friend at the end!\n\nThat wasn't a plan. Nobody falls that far behind on purpose. Having let myself fall that far behind, I couldn't control what would happen. So in that way, I didn't deserve to win the race. But it was a case of never giving up, and I managed to shake myself out of the trouble I'd found and get moving again.\n\nSometimes you might feel slow, even though you know you can go faster. When you finally go faster, it can feel easier.\n\nYou might see this in races when you don't expect it. People suddenly get more energy and start moving faster. I remember a guy named Tony. He wanted to be in the Olympics for a long race in the late 20th century.\n\nIn the race, he was probably in sixth or seventh place with a little bit to go. There was no way you could say that he was running a smart race. He was completely tired. But suddenly he woke up and ran really fast. And he won the race! It was amazing!\n\nAnd a runner from the UK named Paula let herself get passed by a runner from the ET country in the last part of the NE city Marathon in the late 20th century. The runner from ET country moved ahead and usually, if you get passed in the last part of a marathon, that's the end of it. But Paula seemed to suddenly wake up. She ran faster, passed the runner from ET country--and beat her.\n\nYou often feel this in long races, like a marathon: You're steady. You feel like you don't want to try. You think, 'I know I can go faster.' But it's hard to try harder, especially when you can't see the end.\n\nSometimes, going up or down a hill helps. Sometimes a different path wakes you up, or you turn a corner and suddenly you're able to start running. Sometimes you get mad, and that makes you try harder. Seeing the end also helps a lot. And when you start moving--and a lot of it is about moving and trying--you start running faster, and you find your legs are really moving again. It's like being in a boat that can't get the skis out of the water. Once it does, it can really start to go.\n\nAnd when you do this yourself, you'll think, 'What was that all about? It's not so hard--I can _do_ this.'\n\nThat's what we were trying to learn in those different-speed sessions with Henry. And that's why you should include some different-speed work in your training. Because it's not just about getting stronger, it's about getting braver, too. It's practicing what to do when your mind starts to tell you that you can't go faster, or you start to worry and you wait or pause, telling yourself you don't really have to try now; it can wait another round.\n\nSo when you practice, do the same thing again and again. This way, when you feel tired in a race, you will be strong enough to try to keep going and do what you know you can do.\n\nBe brave. Try to become tougher whether you are playing with your friends or trying hard to climb that very muddy hill in a race. It helps you do better, and it makes the game much more fun and enjoyable.\n\nMost children who play games want to challenge themselves and their friends. Of course, very few runners get the chance to play very toughly, unless they are in the front group. But, I think that you can learn to be this kind of brave in practice--especially when changing speed.\n\nI think I was quite a brave runner when I played, not scared to be the first to start and charge. Even if they won, my friends would know they'd been in a very exciting race. I liked a good challenge, using my mind and body against my friends. Of course I didn't win every race I played. But when I lost, that didn't mean I was very sad and wanted to stop playing and not try hard the next time. Instead, that was the fun of it--to be in a very exciting race!\n\nIf there's a friend you really want to win against in a game, and you don't succeed, it's okay! Take some time to think about how you played, practice more, and think about how to do better next time. And the next time you play, surprise them by playing really well and maybe even winning.\n\nIt's okay to really want to win. Wanting to win isn't a bad thing. And kids really like it. When I was a kid, I ran in some races where runners were always passing each other. To do this, all the kids had to be brave and keep trying to go faster. It was a fun competition--the only plan was to try to get to the front! And the best part was, they did it for the fun and excitement of it.\n\nPracticing in a group or being on a team can help you get better. You get more confident, more excited to try, and more willing to give it your all. Doing tough practice drills and timing yourself can help you, too, because they let you see how you're doing. It's all about finding out what you can do. You get braver if you believe in yourself, if you know that, even when you're tired, you'll get your energy back. And you know, too, from practicing, that you can do that--try really hard and then rest--more than once during a game.\n\nSure, being strong can mean just not giving up. But I think you need to be _extra_ strong to face the challenges. My idea was usually that it's best to act before something happens, especially as I didn't have that secret trick, a quick finish.\n\nThis doesn't mean, though, that you have to be the first in a race or start out really fast. Being strong and winning need skill, pace judgment, and tactics.\n\nYou want to have a clear plan for the race, and you want to think about it as you get ready for the race mentally. On the track this will mean maybe starting your final push with six rounds to go, or in a long run, you'll start your final push at the near end, or whatever it is. You want to make a move before someone else does or at least when nobody else is expecting it.\n\nThinking about your plan focuses you and gets you ready.\n\nBut it's good to remember that the race rarely goes according to plan. Other runners have their own ideas, and you have to think quickly, focus, and react. Things can end up quite different from the plans you made before the race started.\n\nFor example, before the big running event at the big hill, I definitely had a plan. I knew the track well. It was three rounds--a total of nine miles--and I was hoping to be in the running with a round to go. Then I thought to go really fast for the last part, maybe start the last round even quicker than I could keep up for the whole part so I could get ahead and leave the other boys behind. I didn't want the race to end in a quick run.\n\nBut, it didn't happen that way. I found myself in the front all alone from the start. No one tried to pass me. And I was very happy.\n\nBut it could have happened the other way. What if I was in the front group, like I thought, and someone started running very fast at the middle or near the end? Would I have followed my before-race plan and waited for the last part? Not if I could avoid it.\n\nUsually, in a long race, if you want to win, you need to be in the front group. If not, the second part of your plan doesn't matter much.\n\nAlmost always, there will be a point in the race where one runner starts to go faster. Then obviously, you have to speed up, too. Everyone tries to use their best skills, and everyone knows the other runners' weak points, so there's a lot of planning happening.\n\nWith my own difficulty in ending with a quick run, I had to run the race in a certain way, and speed up at some point in the middle of the race. And all the other kids knew that. But that still didn't mean I had to be first from the start.\n\nEven slow ones like me don't usually want to start too quickly. Because the last thing you want is to rush ahead and then think, 'I've moved too fast and they've all followed me. _Now_ what do I do?' That's a tricky spot to be in.\n\nI remember a big race where I learned that even in a slow, careful race, a slower runner can do quite well by being brave and not starting too fast.\n\nThe day before my race, George ran a long race for our team. There were only eight runners in the race, and George had the fastest time that season of all eight--probably one of the fastest times in the world that year. He was a good runner, and he'd go on to win a big race and finish second in another.\n\nFor that race, he was very sure of himself. He seemed to think he would win easily--just because he was the fastest on paper.\n\nAt the runners team meeting, our coach, who happened to be Henry, asked him how he planned to run the race.\n\n'I'll probably be first the whole way', George replied.\n\nHenry said that probably wasn't a smart idea, but George was not really interested in listening. After all, he was the fastest kid in the race.\n\nGabriel started the race, but he was worried and couldn't run faster than the others. They all followed him, round and round, and passed him at the end. It was like taking a toy from a baby. He had led them all, but didn't know how to leave them behind and win. He finished last and was very sad. He couldn't understand it.\n\nThe next day, who did our country have for the big race? It was me, the slow runner. The race was the same: eight runners. We were trying to win a spot in the big race, so all the sports reporters were there. They all thought it would be a slow race, and you needed a fast runner.\n\nSome reporters talked to the team leader: 'Gabriel's not the right person, they said. 'He's going to be last in the big race, because it will be slow, and he can't run fast', and so on. The team had David ready, because he had already run a race the day before. David could run fast, and if it was going to be a slow race--well, he probably would win.\n\nIt would have been easier for me to give in to the pressure and let David run instead of me. But I said, no, I've been picked for this race. And I have to do it. And run a very different race than usual.\n\nHenry and I had long chats about how to run it when everything was against me. Leading from the start wouldn't work. But I couldn't wait until the end, either. It felt like I couldn't win. Maybe everyone was right: I was facing a challenge and was very scared.\n\nI thought that the latest I could dare to leave it was when there were three laps left. If I could run for three minutes in the last three laps--that's very fast--that would be hard, not just for me, but for the others, too. I didn't think I would finish last if I could manage to do that.\n\nSo for the first nine laps, I wasn't going to lead no matter what. It didn't matter how slow it was. There were a few quick moments, but mostly it was slow. Very slow!\n\nThen, as planned, when there were three laps left, I led the race. Suddenly, I was a little ahead of the others, but some runners managed to catch up with me, and my best wasn't good enough to win that race. But I did run close to three minutes in the last three laps, and was very happy I had managed to stay calm and stick to my plan. I thought for a bit that I might come third, but I ended up in fourth place in the last steps.\n\nBut fourth was still good for our team. And for me, it was a big step. Even though it was the slowest I'd run since leaving school, Harry was happy and said it was the best race I'd run so far.\n\nOf course, I would have liked to win it. But I learned a lot from that race. I found out that with the right plan, a slow runner like me could still race against faster people. And there were different plans other than leading all the way. Instead of making it easy for everyone else by running fast and steady, if I could stay calm, I could slow down and other runners would have a harder time adjusting to the change of speed. And that was a very important lesson to learn.\n\nI think a lot of people are scared to make a move later in a race because they're afraid of getting hurt. They think it's going to hurt a lot. But I wouldn't say it's real _pain_. Real pain--sharp, stinging pain--would mean you'd have to stop running. But to do your best, you have to be ready to endure a little discomfort. And to beat others, you have to be ready to make a really bold move. Small steps don't always work.\n\nThat's how the best ones win games. In a big race, Kevin decided to lead from the beginning. He had won a long race before, and he was probably still tired. Winning two different races is very hard. No one had won two big races since a long time ago--two years before Kevin was born--when another boy, Matthew, did it.\n\nNext to Kevin stood some of the best runners. After a slow start, Kevin got serious. He led the group for a few fast laps, which is not running very fast but, let me tell you, it's a very good speed. With a short distance to go, Kevin ran even faster. That left behind most of the runners.\n\nOnly three men were still together at the end--Kevin and two boys: Ethan, who had won a big race before, and Edwin, who had run a very fast time for the race, much faster than the big race record.\n\nAs the last lap started, Kevin ran even faster and left. The speed went up very fast. Sam was behind right away. Kevin tried hard to stay close, but he was already far behind when they made the first turn. When there was only half a lap left, Benjamin was ahead by a lot and still moving farther away. At the last turn, he held up one finger--he was the best. At the end, the race wasn't even a little bit close.\n\nBenjamin finished the race fast, breaking the best record by a lot of time. He ran the last part of the race very quickly.\n\nHis win showed what you need to win races. You can be very good at running for a long time, you can run fast and be very fit. But if you can't run faster when you need to, you won't win a lot--or beat the other runners in your group.\n\nIt's the other part of changing speed, which I talked about in a past story. There, I talked about slowing down, going slower and keeping a good, fast pace to run up a hill, for example. Anyone can learn to do that. And everyone should.\n\nBut I won't tell you something that's not true. If running fast at the end of a race were easy, Benjamin's rivals would have stayed close to him on the last lap. And, I would have won more games than I did.\n\nIt wasn't just me. David, although he set a record of 27.30 for a long run, couldn't change speed very well either. Bob was a great coach, and still is. But he never told us the right way to change speed and, as a result, for both David and me it was like trying to run faster without trying. It doesn't work any better on foot than it does in a car. You have to try a bit slower to get the speed up, then try as hard as you can to run faster--quick steps, long steps. It takes practice, it takes strength--and, inborn talent and quick muscles.\n\nDavid was a great runner. When he was running, he was amazing--strong and tall, with high knees and good push off the back foot. He had great technique and he would just cover the ground in front of him with his long steady steps.\n\nBut the thing was, he had great technique in that one speed, not great technique for changing speeds. He was quite fast--you can't argue with a record--but when he was tired or feeling pressure, he couldn't do what he needed: a change of speed. And I fully understood, because that was always my problem, too.\n\nDavid did try hard to be faster. One way was to start very fast, right from the start. Since he had trouble getting ahead of the others at the end of the races, he often tried to get ahead at the start. However, on a very hot day on a track at PO town, running in a big race, he decided to be patient for once and let the race start slow. This patience lasted only one round. The speed was okay but not slow (especially in this weather) as they finished 400 metres in 71 seconds. But it was clearly not fast enough for David. His time for the second round was a very fast 59 seconds. He still had 23 rounds to run, and went on to be ahead of every other runner at least once on his way to a record of 27:47, a very fast time in that weather, and especially after such a fast start.\n\nIt was very surprising how fast he ran at the start of races. But David never won a big prize. He's known as one of the great runners of the late 20th century and often, before big races, he'd be considered the one most likely to win. But at a big race in MU city, he only managed to get the sixth place in a long race, and the 12th place in a shorter race. It was like Ron all over again, and it just showed that you can't win a big race without changing speed. Maybe he should have tried again on the second round!\n\nIt was Ben who thought of the idea to run faster in the middle of the race, because saving energy for the end wouldn't work, even for a runner as good as him. It turned out to be a great idea for him, and I knew I needed to try doing it too. Of course, it's not easy, and it takes a lot of practice.\n\nOne way I practiced was by repeating 1,200-step runs, making the middle 400 steps faster. For example, running the first 400 steps in a minute and five seconds, the middle 400 steps in a minute, and the last 400 steps again in a minute and five seconds. The hardest part is to rest after the quick run in the middle, so you don't get too tired.\n\nChanging speed quickly takes a lot of power, and you should think about special practice sessions to build up the strength you need. If two runners have the same amount of energy, the stronger one will win. Being a good runner is about having both energy and strength. You want to improve both your pace and your step length. It's a two-fold challenge.\n\nWhen the girl from ET country, Emma, ran ahead of the others to win the gold medals in BE city--in both the 5,000 and the 10,000, the same achievement William got on the boy's side--she didn't just move her legs fast. She started to run faster.\n\nGo to the internet and watch the end of Benjamin's gold-medal long run in BE city. You can't see the whole race, but there are some close-ups of Benjamin running that last fast part. You'll see: His legs are still moving at the same speed as before. But now he's also taking very big steps. He's running very hard like nobody's business.\n\nIt's very amazing, and it's very hard to do. You have to get stronger to do it. And if you can't run fast, then try to change your speed in the middle of the race. Yes, there will be a bit of hard work involved. But hopefully, it will be easier because you know the other guys are working even harder.\n\nThere's more to running than just going as fast as you can all the way. Be smart. Plan your strategy. I guess to be strong you have to be ready to work hard. But that is not a bad feeling. It's actually an exciting feeling--especially after, but even during a race, if you're able to follow your plan. You hope you're making the other guys work even harder. And you're competing. You're really enjoying the sport.\n\nSo even though you might have to work hard in races, it's not really pain. You should not mind if you're huffing and puffing and all sweaty when you know you're going fast. It's exciting! It's great! This is what you're good at! You like doing this! It feels nice!\n\nSo, keep doing more of it. You'll find that doing your best is really fun. Give it a try!\n\n##### THINGS TO REMEMBER\n\n- Make your goals hard but something you can do when you practice. Once you've made them, don't let yourself down. Just go out there and do it!\n\n- Be ready before the race and give yourself a lot of time to avoid last minute problems that take away from your focus.\n\n- Think about what you want to do. You should aim to be excited but calm. And be ready to change if for some reason you can't do your normal before-race routine.\n\n- If you're tired during the race, don't show it. Looking tired makes other runners happy--and if you show them you're feeling good, you might feel good, too.\n\n- Don't stop a race unless you really have to. It can become a habit. If you don't think you're well enough to race, don't start.\n\n- Don't let one rhythm make you sleepy in a race. Try to get out of your usual routine and run faster when needed. This kind of training is really good for you.\n\n- Be strong. Try to be brave whether you're practicing with your friends or trying hard to climb a muddy hill during a race. It makes the game much more fun and rewarding.\n\n- In terms of tactics, make your move at the right moment that suits your abilities. And when you make your move, be sure and fully committed.\n\n#### Chapter 1\n\n#### Doing Your Best\n\nDoing well on the day of the race can be a tricky process. Sometimes you feel great before a race--fit, thin, and strong--but on race day, you feel tired and can't really start. Other times you hurt your foot, reduce your practice--and win the big race, beating many strong runners.\n\nNo one can do perfectly every time. It's not possible: Some days are just better than others. But there are ways you can try to make the conditions just right on race day and give yourself the best possible chance of doing your best when it counts the most.\n\nThe goal, of course, is to use all the physical practice you've done and all the bravery you've built up. Doing that means resting before the race, which is an art itself because you want to feel rested but not tired. We'll talk more soon. But there's more to it, getting ready for a special event takes focus. It's not like any other day, it's extra special. It means you need a plan that lets you practice everything you need to do your best on that big day.\n\n#### PRACTICING\n\nGetting ready for a big day starts many months before. It involves practicing in different ways at different times, gradually getting ready for the big day.\n\nPracticing helps you do things you didn't think you could. To do this, you need to change how you practice as you get closer to the big day. If you practice in the same way, you'll do the same thing on the day. So, to get better, you need to plan and change your practice.\n\nAlso, doing the same thing all the time can be boring. You might not do poorly, but you won't do great either. You might feel stuck, not excited, and it won't be fun. If it's not fun, why do it?\n\nTo do your best, you need to be strong, do some hard practice, get ready for the big day, and then have a plan that lets you get ready for the day and rest after. This way, you won't get too tired. Just like you can't do all your weekly exercises in one day, you can't focus on everything you need for a race in one month.\n\nMaking a plan doesn't mean making big changes. For most of the time, your training will stay the same. You will still do your key activities every week: a long run, some kind of fast running, some repeats, whether on hills or on flat ground, and at least one slow recovery run. The next training should go well with the previous one.\n\nWhat we want in making a plan is to change what we focus on. At some times in the year, your long runs will be much longer than at other times. In some training times, your fast running will be harder than at other times. At other times in the year, you'll want to do more slow recovery runs between hard races.\n\nMaking a plan means dividing your training into six parts in the year, each lasting some weeks. Each part will have a different amount of work and a different way of thinking.\n\nStarting after your last big race of the season, table 1 shows what your plan might look like.\n\nThere is lots of room for change, depending on if you are sick, hurt, or how your training is going. You might change this simple plan to have both a cold and warm time race part. But it's really important to have a plan so you don't train the same way all year round.\n\nUsually, instead of making a plan from when you start, you want to make your plan starting from when your race is. Look at how many months you have and, if you need to, make the different parts fit the time you have.\n\nBut if you don't know when the race is, you still might know that you want to race from the middle of the year to the end of summer or start of fall, so you can plan your training for this race part.\n\nLet's look at each of these parts one by one.\n\nThe _active rest_ part is just what it sounds like. You might have raced a lot during the warm times. You're tired, in your body and mind. You need a break. But you don't want to just sit around. So stay moving in a calm and free way, without making yourself do too much. Just get up from your sit a little bit in any way you like.\n\nYou might swim, go on a beach vacation, or do some walking. A walk in the big hills would be good. Some riding could be good, too, if you like it. You'll probably still do a little running, but you won't go far and you won't run fast. And don't forget to take a break: There's no plan, no need to run X times a week. If you don't feel like running, don't run that day. But if it's a lovely day and you really want to, go ahead, do something easy. And don't watch the time, just have fun.\n\nAfter that time, you should feel good and ready--you've been active, kept your body moving, found your love for running again, and now you're ready to do something a little harder.\n\nSimple _exercise_ is about building your strength. Let's be honest, runners are strong in some ways, but in other ways they can get hurt easily. When they do something that's not running, like lifting or another activity, they can feel it.\n\nSimple exercise is a time to work on those weak spots. A great way to do this is to do some gym work and circuit training, where you do different exercises--like push-ups, curls, sit-ups, dips, jumps, knee bends, back lifts, and more. There are a lot of them. You might do each exercise for 30 seconds with a 30-second break, and do the circuit three times.\n\nYou'll also start to run a bit more during this phase, but without the hard work you'll do later.\n\nI must admit, I didn't do this kind of basic exercise often. I did some when I was with my friends, maybe, but the only time I really did it right was after hurting my foot and having my foot covered for three weeks. From not being able to walk, I started a strong fixing and strengthening program.\n\nI remember thinking, Wow, I've only had six weeks here and I haven't been able to run at all, but I feel really strong! We should do six weeks of this every year, even when we're not hurt!'\n\nA few weeks later I was back running well enough to be chosen for the team to play the big game. It was amazing after thinking the year was lost due to the injury just three months before. I remember promising to include this kind of training every winter, but moving around with my friends did not always allow it. But definitely it was a lesson learned.\n\nFocus on total strength and toughness in this time of your training--like strength in your tummy and upper body. You'll find that, after building up this strength and toughness, you'll be able to handle the training better--especially running, where you're slipping and sliding and stumbling a bit. And you feel less sore afterwards. So I'd really suggest it.\n\nHaving increased your walking and worked on your strength and toughness, you're now ready to build the stamina that will be important to playing well. Here, you'll be running a lot, even very far. That means different things to different people; we're talking about what far means to _you_ , based on what you've done before. But no matter how far, make sure you run at different speeds and, most importantly, avoid running slowly.\n\nThe important thing about these first three parts--resting, basic training, and building endurance--is this: Your aim should not be that you're eagerly looking for top fitness. Don't think, 'I have to do more, I have to do more'. Don't worry if your runs are a little slower than last week. Maybe it was windy; maybe you were tired.\n\nYou're just starting a routine. Sometimes you may be running fast. But there are very few really hard runs. You're not chasing fitness in a panic. Instead, to use a phrase my coach, Henry, used a lot, 'You're letting the fitness come to you.' You're just doing the runs. You're building.\n\nThat's the whole idea of building--training. And in these early parts, you're getting fit enough to train hard, which is half the challenge.\n\nThere's something else that needs to be said again at this point: Whatever part you're in, your main aim is to be fit enough to train tomorrow. So you shouldn't think of any of this as strict. It's not set. It's not good to get to the next step, which will be practice, very strong but hurt. That's not good at all. Even if you think you should be doing a lot of running, don't push if you feel a bit bad. No practice is worth making you feel bad.\n\nNow, made strong by the basic practice and that big bit of running, you're ready to go out, work very hard, and get fit.\n\nIn the _practice_ stage, your do-overs--your track work, your hill work, and your games--will be more hard than at any other point in your plan. You're going to work hard on your speed, your changes of speed, and your fast staying power: all the things you need to race your best.\n\nWhile the past steps will be good getting ready for any runner, here your practice gets more special depending on the race you're getting ready for. I've talked about the different kinds of speed practice in chapter 10. But mostly, runners getting ready for races such as the short race might do very fast do-overs, but not so many of them--and with long rests in between, so they can keep practicing that fast speed. Those getting ready for longer races, such as the long race, will do the do-overs a bit slower, but will run more of them, and without so much rest in between, so they make their fast staying power better.\n\nFor example, a fast runner might run a short distance 10 times, each one quickly, maybe with a little rest in between. But a runner trying to run a longer distance might run slower, but do it 15 times, maybe with only a short rest.\n\nThere would be a similar difference in how they would run a very short distance, too. The fast runner might run them very quickly. He might do it 10 times and, since he likes running very fast, he'd rest a lot in between.\n\nThe runner trying for a longer race might do more than 10. But he might be running them not as fast. And since he likes running fast even when he's tired, he might group them into smaller groups, with only a very short rest, taking longer rests only between groups.\n\nEach runner decides how to change these ideas to fit his or her goals, health, and way of life. The important thing is not how fast a top runner runs. It's that your runs, unless you're changing your speed on purpose, should all be done in about the same time. This will be tough, because this is the best part of learning. But if you try hard, you should be able to run the last part just as fast as the first one. Getting slower is not something you want to do.\n\nHaving tried that hard while still running a lot will have made you very fit. But, it has not made you ready to run a race: You can't run your best when you're tired from doing so much work.\n\nWhat you need is a four- to six-week _race getting ready_ time. You're still going to learn really hard--after all, you want to keep your feet fast and keep your skill to deal with being out of breath. But in this time, you may want to learn more on plans, speed guessing, and changes of speed. You'll want to focus on times that make you feel like you do at big parts of a race: You might go first in your learning group, when your skill to guess speed will be very important. You might run in a group and practice being able to run relaxed even when it's crowded. You'll also want to work on changing speed--which is not always something you'll do only at the end of a race--and on fast finishes. And practice these things not just once, like in a race, but many times in the same time.\n\nThese times should show you a good sign of your good and bad points, and therefore the best plans to use in a race. You don't want to just start a race without knowing what to do. You need to be ready and have a happy outlook.\n\nAnd during this race getting ready time, you'll want to slow down a little and maybe do just one or two very hard sessions each week. You want to let your body soak up all your practice and be fresh and ready for each of those hard sessions.\n\nThe _race time_ brings a problem, especially if you plan a long race time. The challenge is being in the best shape without making yourself too tired to race at your very best. Looking back, this is not something I always did just right. When your practice is going well, it's so tempting to just keep it going. You feel great. You're in a routine. You like it. And those big weekly race numbers give you confidence.\n\nBut even though you feel great, you may find in those last couple of rounds of a race--or the last part of your race--that you feel more tired than you should feel. Maybe you think, 'Well, that was just a bad run.' Even worse are those races where you already feel tired just warming up before!\n\nI sometimes look back at my practice book and think, 'Wow, what was I doing, trying to run fast on the track after another long week?' I know I couldn't slow down for a race every week, and it was all good getting ready for the main parts of the season, big races. But if I think about it now, it would have been smarter to have just gone a smaller distance each day during that part of the season.\n\nIf I could do it again, I'd probably do it differently. But it can be tough to slow down when you're doing well, and there are some good things about sticking to your routine. You really need a coach to tell you to slow down--and that is maybe the most important part of coaching, knowing when and how to do this.\n\nMy advice is to work hard and do some good work during the competition season. But don't go too far and make sure you slow down enough, and not just before your big races.\n\nSo planning is a very important part of your yearly training cycle. Following this kind of plan can get you to the competition time in the best possible shape.\n\n##### GETTING READY\n\nBut getting ready for a specific race, maybe the most important race of the year, on a specific day--this is not so simple. Of course it will involve slowing down, but it's not as easy as just doing less, or even nothing, for the last few days. It is a very personal thing, and to get it right, you really need to be aware of your body and mind.\n\nWhat works best will be different for different people--and even different for the same person on different days. Even when you've found what works for you, you can't do it exactly the same every time.\n\nA race is like a show, and you should get ready for it like you would for a school play or a test. You shouldn't do nothing before it, but you also shouldn't do too much.\n\nAs you do more races, you'll find what works best for you. It's good to write in a notebook about your race training so you can see what works best. Don't just remember it, write it down.\n\nAll runners are different, but there are some things that can help everyone. Let's talk about the physical part first.\n\nWhy is it hard to get the timing right? Some people think they should train hard until a few days before the race, then stop all training.\n\nI think that's wrong. You might feel slow and lazy. Training less can make you feel tired and eat too much. You train less, but feel worse. Sometimes people who do this have a bad race, then feel great the next day, after the race has cleared out the laziness.\n\nThere are some signs that you've been training too much and need to rest for a few days: If your pee is dark, it's a sign you're not drinking enough water. Feeling very thirsty or not sleeping well or feeling like you want to eat everything, including the tablecloth, can be signs that you've been running and playing too hard. Besides, of course, how you feel in general. If you go for an easy run and you feel like you're flying, that's the feeling you want. But if an easy run doesn't feel so easy, there's something wrong.\n\nIf there are 10 days left before the big game, you still have time to fix it. On the other hand, if you're feeling like this only a couple of days before the big game, there might be a problem.\n\nAnother reason to rest early is because you want to be fresh not just for the big game day, but _before_ the last four or five days countdown. Often, kids think these last few days are the time to do nothing. Instead, that's when you want to feel lively again, keeping sharp by doing some easy running with some fast, hard efforts.\n\nIf you need to rest, don't tell yourself, I know I'm not fresh so I'll just go for an easy run today. Because you might not feel fresh the next day, and decide to go for another easy run. And the same the next day, and the day after that. You can end up having a lot of days where you're just doing something easy--but still just tiring enough to stop you from feeling fresh the next day.\n\nWell, you get to the end of the week and you've only got two days before the big run. What will you do if you _still_ feel tired? Just rest the day before the big run and hope you're OK? Keep going no matter what? It's too late. You don't have any other choices. So if you find yourself that tired, don't try to keep running. Take a break. And make that choice early, so you have time to feel better as the big run gets closer.\n\nThis is why you should pretend the big run is a day before it really is, and plan for it from that day too. I would say that, if you feel good the day before a run, you're going to be _great_ for the day of the run. But if you're not feeling good the day before the run, you've still got an extra day to rest. It's just another little safety net.\n\n##### GETTING READY\n\nOnce you know you're feeling better and refreshed, you want to get back to your usual running routine, but with a few key changes. Most of your running should feel easy, and any fast running you do should be shorter, still quick--but with more rest and not so hard.\n\nYou might keep your normal runs easy by setting your heart beat limit to 145 and making sure not to go over that. But in your fast running sessions, don't be scared of going quite quick at times, as long as you don't run too quick too many times. This means, there won't be any chance of feeling too tired.\n\nRight now, you're practicing more for feelings than for being stronger: If the big race is less than a week away, you have to know you are not going to become stronger.\n\nIt's like a test--you can't learn things at the last minute. Any practice you do on Tuesday is not going to make you stronger or last longer by Saturday. Your goal in the last few days is to make yourself feel good--physically fast, active, flexible, and mentally happy and ready to go.\n\nYou want activities that make you happy and confident. Even though your week might be easier, you'll still find that doing two times a long run, nearly as fast as you can with a good five or six minutes rest in between, can be a great exercise three or four days before a big race. A long run player might try to create this happiness and confidence by running three times a shorter run fast, with five or six minutes rest between each one. And during this time, make sure to drink lots of water so you're not thirsty. Standing at the start without enough water just won't do.\n\nAs long as you've rested and are feeling better, it can still be okay to practice twice on the day before the race--especially if you've had a long trip. Do an easy run in the morning and a bit of stretching. Then have a fun day. Go outside again in the afternoon or evening for a short run, followed by a few quick steps--a few times the length of a football field, running swiftly and strongly, but not racing.\n\nThat would be just like your race-day practice--only you're also doing it the day before the race, just to stay loose and ready. Almost like a practice for the coming event.\n\nI remember the first race I had as a kid where I felt really ready. It was a big running event in a place called BL town, on the northwestern side of the EN country. David was there, too--still a young runner but participating in the grown-up event. Both of us were lucky at the time to have a coach named Bob.\n\nI'd won all my races so far that winter, so I knew I was doing well. And Bob prepared us really well: It was an easier week, right from the Sunday before. Then on a day we did a training that was probably really designed for David. He did three rounds of about the length of a football field on the street, quite fast, with five or six minutes rest in between. And I did two of them with him.\n\nI'd never done anything like that before. And I thought, 'Wow, that's a bit fast! But I'll do it anyway.' And I was zooming around. I felt happy after doing that. I was not tired anymore. We got a massage on a day at the local sports club. This helped our legs feel better and not stiff. I felt even better after this. The day before the running race, I ran a bit at school in my gym class. At night, my dad took us to a beautiful beach place, SP city. We got there when it was dark, around bedtime.\n\nAnd David said, 'No, we can't eat yet. We need to run a bit after the car ride.' So we ran for a bit, and I felt better. After that, we had a great dinner and, even though I was a bit scared, I slept very well.\n\nThe next day, I ran very well! I'd never run as fast before. Sadly, I fell down soon after we started. I was getting up when the other runners made me fall again, and then I was stepped on by the many running kids until they all went past. So basically I started from the end with all the 400 runners. But it didn't take long before I was running fast again, and soon I was racing fast, moving through the other runners and getting closer to the front. I did get up to the second spot, but had no energy left for a quick finish, finally ending up in 4th place. I didn't get a medal, but it still felt good. I was happy, and felt sure I would have won the race if I didn't fall.\n\nThat was my first time to do better in a race than I'd ever done in practice. I learned from the lead-up to that race that as a race gets closer, the way you _feel_ is the most important thing. We still followed a regular practice routine, but the different practices, the travel, and the feeling of excitement were added good things. Nervous? Yes. Too scared to move? Absolutely not!\n\nI learned, too, that it was okay to run really fast just a couple of days before the race. In fact, I would say that three days before the race is the best day for your last hard practice, and two days before is the best time to take it easy and make sure you get a good sleep. For some strange reason the night before the race is less important, and I have heard many stories of runners having fun, dancing, and not getting much sleep the night before the race, and then going out and running a great race. I'm not saying this is the best way to get ready!\n\nI also found out it was good to run two times the day before the race. Right away, I knew that if I hadn't run that evening, I wouldn't have felt so good for the race. That easy run didn't make me any stronger, but without it I would have felt heavier and more tired.\n\nThe way to make a plan like that work in the final week is to rest in the week before. It wouldn't work if you started this plan already tired and worn out. Then, in the last few days, train not to get more fit, but just to feel good--fast, confident, loose, excited, and ready.\n\nDon't run your fastest in practice on Wednesday only to not do well in Saturday's race. There are many stories of great athletes who ran really fast in the middle of the week and then weren't as good for the race. William was one of our country's top middle-distance runners in the late 20th century, and once held the record for the mile. But he was known for doing his best running on a Wednesday and then not being so good on race day at the weekend.\n\nThat's not what you want to do at all.\n\nSure, David and I ran those distances quite fast three days before the big race. But they weren't their best. We didn't leave that game on our hands and knees. We left feeling strong, not sad.\n\nIt's hard to know how quick you should run before a big race. I ran with Benjamin in a year long, long ago, the night before he set his record in a long run. It was a weekday, and he was running in a big race the next night. I was running in a shorter race the day after. There were whispers he might try for a record even though he was just better from a hurt. And I think Benjamin, being Benjamin, had told the news people something like that. That would make the crowd excited. The news people liked it. And it helped him because it made him feel a bit nervous, which he usually liked.\n\nBesides, he could say that. No one else in our country was going to race him much in those days. So if he missed the record but still won by a lot, it wouldn't be a big deal.\n\nIdeally on this weekday, two days before my race, and having done my final quick runs the day before I should have just been going for a short, easy run. Maybe David, since it was just one day before his race, should have done an easy run, too, along with a few short strides. \n\nBut instead, Ben said, 'Why don't you and David just go for a steady run?' He was the coach so we went out for a steady run. We kept up a strong pace, running through the woods, talking all the way. All that talking showed we were getting excited about our upcoming races. We were going fast yet hardly breathing, and it felt good. That run--a few miles at a good pace--had David excited. And the next day he did really well in his race, doing better than Tony by a lot.\n\nSome people might say that David had made a mistake that night before the race. But we're talking about feelings as well as facts. That run certainly did David a lot of good. At that time you need to run for feelings, not according to some strict plan. A few days before an important race, it can be very helpful to run quite fast, leaving yourself confident and excited. However, even though I liked the run, I think I made a mistake and should have gone for a shorter, slower run that evening.\n\n##### Be clean, don't cheat\n\nThis might be tough to hear, but I think many of us feel upset with our own games--and with others, too--because of all the bad stuff being taken to make people play better. Games are full of one surprise after another, and I believe most people now look at great play with a mix of doubt and surprise.\n\nPeter, a former running jumper and sports reporter, who is sadly not with us anymore, had a room full of news stories, rule breakers, and many other stories of strange and doubtful play. He wondered about almost every player and almost every amazing play. Even if he was only half correct, there are still a huge number of rule breakers in all games.\n\nI'm not silly. Breaking rules is nothing new. A long, long time ago, a fighter named Ethan paid three of his opponents to lose on purpose in the old Games. And even then, players took different stuff to play better.\n\nRight from the start of the big bike race, over 100 years ago, there was all sorts of rule breaking--people messing with bikes, cutting brake ropes, getting lifts, and doing other unfair things.\n\nDuring a time of big conflict, rule breaking was everywhere, especially among the people from EA country, whose bad programs even confused boys and girls. The runner from FI country, Liam, was widely thought to have used a trick: freezing blood, then putting it back into the body later to increase the red cell count and make breathing better. It wasn't bad before--it is now--but folks still thought it was not right, in a good way. Victor never said yes to using extra blood to get better. But he used to do almost nothing special for four years, after which he'd be the best runner in the world--winning both small and big races in two different big sports events. He said it was because of 'special milk.'\n\nBut the folks from the BR country? We were always the ones who played fair. And in my view, that is the way all sports should be. So, yes, if you like, I have to say it. I'm from BR country, and maybe I _am_ simple.\n\nI never thought anybody I was running with was cheating. We were told that some things were good for throwers and runners but not for those who run far. But it has been found out that there were indeed folks who cheated in my races, and that makes me sad.\n\nI came fifth in the big race in the AT city in the year 1982. Not bad--except that three of the four people who were better than me were not fair. The guy who won the race, an IT country runner named Adam, later said yes to using extra blood to get better--including, his coach said, in that race. The person who got the second prize, William, was from the GE country, and we know how their sports program was. The bronze winner, Matthew from FI country, was found using unfair means in the big games two years later and was not allowed to play anymore.\n\nOn one side, I feel happy for what I achieved and how I did it. I never did anything wrong. I would not like to have won any prize and always remember that I won it by not playing fair. The prize would have been a lie.\n\nBut I still feel wronged. I feel wronged not only by those players, but also by the system that let this happen and, even worse, allowed it and protected the wrongdoers. Even with all the important testing today, I think the wrongdoers are usually a step or two ahead of the testers. But even when the testers find them, they often get away on a small mistake, or at worst are only stopped for a short time and then allowed back into the game. What kind of warning is that? In my view, players found not playing fair should be stopped from all games for life.\n\nNo wonder I've become more and more disappointed with international and professional games and a bit unhappy and twisted in my old age.\n\nIt's not only the top guys who don't play fair, and that's the reason I'm talking about it here. Everyday players do it, too. I know a GE country mountain biker named Gabriel who lived in CA state for quite some time. Not a top player, just a good semi-pro. And he was very clear about saying he used to take something to help him grow. 'Good stuff', he said. 'It's normal over there in CA country. Helps keep you looking young, too. I'd still take it today if I could buy it'.\n\nSport is supposed to be pure: honest competition and fair play. But sometimes it seems that who wins is decided not by who's the better player but by who's got more money or who's got the better helper. It's not just person against person. I guess people have always liked to cheat, and that's a little sad in itself. To my mind the heart of sport is a healthy mind in a healthy body. It's not win no matter what.\n\nBut the thing that really makes me sad is this: Far from being worried about the chance of doing something super, I am the _first_ to believe in the chance of sudden wins. I know for sure that you can have a one-time, wow performance where everything goes just right.\n\nThat's what we're all training for. That's what the advice in this book is all about--there's more to doing well than just knowing stuff. The mind bit, the doing your best, the wanting, and the being fierce can all mix to create great performances. My performance at the National was probably one of them. David's world record in the race was another--a great time but faster than any he ran before or after.\n\nI want you to make big changes, like in the story I'm telling in this book. We are all looking for a special thing. But it makes me sad when I hear that a fast runner has run even faster than before and I don't know if I can believe it. Sometimes people cheat in sports and it makes me not trust them.\n\n##### RUNNING RACES, BUT NOT TOO MANY, MAKES YOU BETTER\n\nSome running groups today want members to race every week. Over time, each race feels the same and you don't feel excited: Your chance to do really well in the race you care about most is less.\n\nI felt that way too. People wanted me to race and I liked racing. But I raced too often and it wasn't good for me.\n\nThink about the Big Race in 1981. I was racing every week before that race. I ran a race in the middle of the week, and then a quick five-mile race on the weekend. The next week, I ran another race and hurt my heel really bad. A week after that, I won the Big Country Race. Next week, I won a hard long run race for my team. Then the following week, I won another long run race.\n\nThen, the week after was a very big run race. It was my seventh race in just over six weeks. It was too much.\n\nLooking back, I didn't really think about the big run race as much as I should have. I was thinking about a different race, because if I didn't do well in that, I wouldn't be able to go to the big run race.\n\nAnd when I think about it, my coach, Harry, didn't help me think about it the right way. Maybe, after the other race, he could have talked to me and said, 'You did really well. You're doing great. You can win this big run race. You've got three weeks to get ready. No one can beat you right now. No more races until then.'\n\nIf he had, I might have thought about it more. But being the best sometimes needs luck, and who can say I might have done better? That's just how things happen. You only get one try. You can't look back and blame anyone. Of course I knew I was doing good. I know this may sound silly, but at that time I thought my Big Race was just a good run. I didn't really understand how good it was. Maybe I was just too cheerful. But if you try too hard, sometimes you don't do as well.\n\nAnyway, maybe because I had to return to work, or maybe because of those two races in between, I reached in the MA city for the Big Race without the concentration I would have liked.\n\nIn the end, it was a strange race. The path, as far as I can remember, was four rounds, each a bit more than a mile. And in the middle of the race, a group of runners took off very fast, making a big gap between them and us. I thought, 'Either I'm not running well or those guys are really good.' I was running with the AU country Adam, who would do the best in the long race later that year. And I remember saying to him, 'Either those guys are much better than us, or they've lost track of the rounds!'\n\nWell, I was right. They had. Surprisingly, they started too early. And with a round still to go, they were trying to move to the finish line, and actually stopped when they were at the finish line.\n\nSuddenly, the rest of us were back in the race. And then, I was not feeling well. If I was not feeling bad, I might have won the race. But I finished fourth, a little bit behind the winner, the AM country runner Adam.\n\nBut that's how races are. You can think about what would have happened if I was not feeling bad at the end. But you can also think that, if the boys from ET country didn't get confused, more of them would have been in front of me. (One of them, Matthew, didn't get confused and finished second.)\n\nBut I do wish I had thought more about that race before it happened and didn't do at least one of the two races I did in the days before it. With more rest, less travelling, and better thinking, and if I was not feeling bad, I might have won that race--which was, back then, the best race in the world.\n\nThe best thing you can do is not to do what I did. Don't race too much. Focus on the important races, even if you have to not do others if they make you less ready for the big one.\n\n##### THINK GOOD THINGS WILL HAPPEN\n\nWhen you start a race, do you just _hope_ to do well? Would you be happy just to run as well as you usually do when you practice? Or do you really _expect_ to do well. Are you looking for something more, something different than what you usually do?\n\nThe answers might depend on how important the race is and who you're racing against. But they also show how you think about racing and if you can get really focused and ready when it's time to race.\n\nLet's say it differently. How ready would you be to go faster than you ever have before? Would you think going so fast is reckless, like not being careful? Or could you let go of your fears and think that because you're so focused, you can keep up this faster speed?\n\nSome players think practice is a test. They think you have to do something in practice before you can do it in a race. But others think practice is just getting ready, and that there are other things besides just being fit that can help people do much better than they usually do or than how fit they are.\n\nThe difference between these two ways of thinking is about being confident and believing in yourself, and about letting your mind be strong in some situations. One way limits you; the other gives you new possibilities.\n\nI remember a time in the late 20th century that showed me not only how important it is to listen to your body, instead of just following a set plan, but also how strong the mind can be.\n\nI had a great time in a year long ago. I did very well in the big race, and I was the fastest I had ever been in two big runs. So, I was hoping for more great things the next year.\n\nBut the next year was going to be tough. I had to do a very long run almost every month from spring to autumn--a big run once a month for half a year.\n\nI won the first big run, a big race in the UK, by a lot. The next run was a big race in OS city, in the summer. The best runners were going to be there, including a fast runner from KE country named Henry, who was the fastest ever, so I had to be very ready.\n\nBut this was not the most important run. I was really trying to do well in the big race in EU country in early autumn, and another big race in October. But to be in these, I of course had to do another big race in the summer. So I kept practicing very hard. I knew I had a long time, and it was not time to be the fastest yet.\n\nBut all that hard work, as well as too many races and the usual problems at work, were making me tired.\n\nAnd one early morning, just a week before the big race in OS city, things went wrong. I was very tired. I felt so bad I stopped my run--something I never do--after a little while. 'I've done too much', I thought. I can't keep going. I need to rest. And it's too late to fix things before next week: I've already messed up the race in OS city.\n\n\"I will always listen to my teachers,\" the champion from ET country, Henry, told a big newspaper in a year long ago. \"But first I listen to my body. If what they tell me feels good to my body, great. If my body doesn't feel good with what they say, then always my body is more important.\"\n\nI don't think I had much choice. My body really knew what it needed.\n\nSome friends from LO city were visiting us in HA town that weekend. Having stopped my run, I went with them to a cafe. And ate. Then we went for a walk and ended up in a nice place to eat. And ate some more. After that, we walked a little more, then went into a place that served a very good tea. We ate again--not just tea and cake, but food like ham, potatoes, bread, then jam, cakes, and then apple pie, and who knows what else. I was very hungry. And it felt _nice_ to stop my hard practice routine and just live a bit more like usual.\n\nThe next day, I felt very heavy and not good at all. There were only six days left before the race. If I hadn't messed it up by practicing too much, surely I had messed it up now by eating too much. Still, I did a bit of practice early that week and started to get back somewhat to my usual preparation for a big race--doing some quick sessions, trying to feel light on my feet and able to cope with being out of breath, something you need in a race.\n\nWe were leaving for the OS country on the last day of the week. The evening before the last day of the week, I did another session, probably two times a mile, hard. I felt better than I had at the weekend, but that's not saying much. I still felt heavy and out of breath--not very good at all. I was expecting a not so good time in the OS country. 'No way', I thought, would I be quick enough.\n\nBut the atmosphere in OS country was wonderful. I had a run around the lake with David and Steve and some of the other guys, nice and easy--probably easier than if I'd gone out on my own, so that was good. (Luckily, Benjamin wasn't there!) And then we did five or six times 100 meters, but instead of taking the usual 15 or 20 seconds rest, we just had nice, slow walks back to the start. It was wonderful: I felt good and free.\n\nThen, we went to the host's house for the usual pre-big event fruit party, and all the other sports people were there--jumpers, runners, and fast runners: very good in all games. The mood was getting better for the race. It was going to be a fun time, a chance to be on stage and show what you could do.\n\nThat's what made me think a lot about how, the closer you get to the race, the more your getting ready should be about feelings. You're not looking for more fitness. You want a mix of excitement and maybe just a little nervous worry.\n\nThe next day, I stood ready against the best runners in the world, including Ryan; the AM country Adam, who's now helping the BR country runner Matthew with such good results; and Cameron of another place, a future big game gold winner in the long run. Ryan, as I've said, was the current world record holder in the long run. Adam was in the middle of a run of three straight victories in the NE city long run, and Cameron would go on to break the world long run record.\n\nThere was a leader, and round we went at world record speed. There was a big crowd and it took us along, clapping and stamping in time with our rhythm. I was just running around, feeling good and light. It felt like sliding: I was just telling myself, don't fall. I had no time to think about how fast I was going. All I had to do was stay in the line and keep up.\n\nSadly, I lost focus and had a few bad runs near the end, and I was not going to win the race. But it was very fast. Liam won in a very short time, just missing the best record. Samuel was second, with his best time ever. Next was the man from BE country, Adam, also with his best time ever and a BE country record, followed by Ryan.\n\nAnd fifth was me, with a time that would turn out to be my best ever, too--but sadly a little slower than the UK record held by Benjamin, and the SH club's record and old best record, held by David.\n\nLooking at it in different ways, it had been a good race for me, despite the problems of the last weekend. Even though I was too tired, I'd had time to get a bit better. I'd listened to my body--just in time! I'd trained for feelings not for being fit. And, perhaps most important, by the time of the race, I was excited, ready, and I thought something great would happen.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe if I hadn't tried too hard and eaten too much, and had I got ready right that day, I was strong enough to have set a new world record myself.\n\nEither way, here's what's important. Believe you can do great things. Whether you call it getting yourself excited, thinking positively or just getting ready in your mind, this step is a very important part of doing your best. It's where the art comes in, rather than the learning. This thinking is a big part of getting ready and doing well for top sports boys and girls.\n\nIt could be that not many everyday runners know how powerful the mind is to include it in their getting ready. But I tell you to think about it. Believe in miracles. If you do, they might happen.\n\nAnd on a special day when everything is just right and you believe you can do it, you'll do something much, much better than you've ever done in practice--maybe even better than in any race before. You'll have tried your hardest, found out that you were able to do much more than you thought, and run to your true abilities.\n\nAnd that feeling is the best thing ever, the goal we all try to reach--and the best feeling ever.\n\n##### THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND\n\n- Get ready for a big race months ahead and use other races to help you get ready for the big one. Don't race too much.\n\n- Make a long-term plan to work on different kinds of exercises, so you can be at your best for the most important race.\n\n- When you think about getting ready for the big race, rest early. Pretend the race is one day earlier than it really is.\n\n- Keep to what you usually do: Do less intense exercises but don't reduce the number of times you do them. And drink lots of water.\n\n- In the days before a race, exercise for how it makes you feel, not to get fitter.\n\n- Believing in yourself can help you do better than you've ever done in practice. So believe in yourself, and expect great things.\n\n## Extra Information\n\nThis part has sample exercise plans for beginners, people who've been doing it for a while, good club members, advanced club
