{"text": "A mom and two kids lived in a town. The mom worked as a helper for people who sold houses. One day, the mom needed to go home early to her kids. But her boss said, \"If your home is messy like last time, you will lose your job!\" The boss cared about keeping things clean and neat. The story was set in a regular town with stores for buying things like clothes, boats, and berry drinks. The mom's job was important to her family. An adult and a child were living in a normal home. The adult made a list for the day. Some of the things on the list were: make a list, color pictures, look at schools, do something new, make good memories, and change a paper. \n\nThe child wanted to do something fun. The adult did not want the child to do anything dangerous. The child tried to slide down the stairs on a sled. This made a mess in the home. The child's mother came home and saw the mess. The child tried to blame the sister, but could not explain how it was her fault. \"Sorry, Mr. Cat.\" \"Would you like some milk?\" \"Milk?\" \"No!\" \"I cannot drink it.\" \"It makes me sick.\" \"You'll thank me later.\" \n\nA strange person came in. \"Hello!\" \"That's fun!\" \"Yeah!\" \"Who is this?\" \"Ohh!\" \"That's my mom.\" \"Yes, this place will do well.\" \"But those curtains are not good.\"\n\nThe person was sleeping on the couch. \"Who is this uncomfortable woman?\" \"Get off her.\" \"That's our babysitter.\" \"What? Babysitter? You don't need one.\" \"Let me understand. You pay this woman to sit on babies? That's bad! I would do it for free!\"\n\n\"Now, let's see how fun you are.\" \"How fun?\" \"Yes. It measures how fun you are.\" The strange person did something. \"You are very strict.\" Then the person did something else. \"Wow! You break rules.\"\n\n\"You are both not good. You are too strict, and you break rules too much. That will be money.\" \"What do we do?\" \"There are two ways to fix it. One is painful shots. The other involves singing and dancing!\"\n\nThe person started singing and dancing. \"How many shots?\" The person said, \"Aren't you sweet?\" Adam and Benjamin were playing. \"It is wet outside,\" said Adam. \"And the sun is not shining,\" said Benjamin. \"But we can have lots of good fun that is funny.\"\n\n\"It's fun to have fun. But you have to know how,\" said Adam. Benjamin made a funny noise.\n\n\"Hey, stop that right now!\" said a voice. \"Who said that?\" asked Adam. \"Me!\" said the fish. \"Remember? The fish you brought home and loved for two weeks, and then forgot about.\"\n\n\"The fish is talking!\" said Benjamin. \"Well, sure, he can talk,\" said Adam. \"But is he saying anything important? No, not really.\"\n\n\"Hey, be quiet!\" said the fish. \"This cat should not be here when your mother is out.\"\n\n\"Are you going to listen to him?\" said the cat. \"He drinks where he pees!\"\n\nThe cat sang, \"There was this cat I knew where he was born. He never listened to his mother. He never used the litter box. He made a mess everywhere. That's why they took him to get fixed.\"\n\n\"That wasn't fun!\" said Benjamin.\n\n\"He never learns,\" said the cat. \"You can have fun, but don't go too far. They may send you away if you don't behave.\"\n\n\"We can't spell 'fun' without 'u' in the middle,\" sang the cat.\n\nThe fish said, \"This cat is breaking many of your mother's rules!\"\n\nThe cat kept singing about having fun and being happy. The fish got dizzy from all the movement. Adam and Benjamin were having fun. \"That was very cool!\" said Adam. \"Do it again!\"\n\"I would like to, but we should not,\" replied Benjamin. \"I really need to go now.\"\n\"No, don't go!\" shouted Adam. \"I should let you and the animal friends play more games, clean your room, and do homework.\"\n\"No, you must stay!\" said Adam. \"Okay, I'll stay,\" agreed Benjamin.\n\"But if I stay, there is something I want to show you. It is a paper with rules,\" said Benjamin. \"Do we need to put our names on this?\" asked Adam.\n\"Yes, this lets you have all the fun you want, and nothing bad will happen,\" Benjamin explained.\n\"All the fun we want?\" asked Adam. \"Nothing bad?\" asked Benjamin. \"Yes!\" said Benjamin.\nAdam's sibling said, \"I do not think this is a good idea, but okay.\"\nThey all put their names on the paper. \"Let's start the fun!\" shouted Adam.\nThey ran to another room. Adam's sibling said, \"We are not allowed in this room, or else something bad may happen.\"\n\"You are right, something bad may happen if we play in here,\" agreed the sibling. Hi! I'm a cat. One day, I made a mess at home. The child and parent told me to clean up. \"You need to clean this mess up quickly,\" they said. \"We have an agreement.\"\n\nI said, \"Okay, I will try.\" But they said, \"You don't try. You do it.\" \"Yes,\" I said. \"I will do it right away.\"\n\nI coughed and said I would be back soon. Then I fell down with a crash! The child and parent laughed. \n\nThe child said, \"Look, I'm a girl!\" and giggled. The parent told the child to stop because the child ruined the parent's dress for tonight.\n\nThe parent said, \"This dirty thing? It was already ruined when I bought it.\" The child agreed.\n\nA fish said, \"I told you this would happen! But no one listens to a fish! A dog barks and everyone knows a child is trapped. But when a fish speaks plain words, no one listens.\"\n\nThe parent said, \"Let's all take a deep breath and calm down.\" We all breathed in and out. The parent said, \"I know who will solve it. I will take care of everything. I know just the right ones to do it.\"\n\nThe parent showed us two funny creatures called Thing One and Thing Two. The parent introduced us all to each other. Thing Two said we could call it by other fun names too, like Ben. \"Goodbye.\" \"Goodbye.\" Some sounds.\n\"Okay, soldier.\" \"Our target is near.\" \"Start looking for it.\" \"What?\" \"Look for and save it.\" \"I meant look for and save it.\" \"Come on!\"\n\"I was not invited to that party.\" \"Hey!\" \"You are alone.\" A whisper said, \"Live alone, die alone.\"\n\"Yes.\" \"Can we please get the animal?\" A mocking voice said, \"Can we please get the animal?\" \"Can we please get the animal?\" \n\"Boo!\"\n\"Oh, no! Oh, man! Hello, Nathan.\" Goodbye, Cameron.\" \"You are not tough now, are you?\" A bark.\nA sinister laugh.\nA laugh.\n\"We will die. We will never close that box. And I will go to a school for bad boys!\"\n\"Why don't we take my car?\"\n\"You have a car?\"\n\"Yes, sure.\" A car alarm sound.\nAn engine started, tires screeched. \n\"Wow. That is so cool.\"\n\"That is just the cover. Here it is, the Very Big Machine.\" \n\"Very Big Machine?\"\n\"Yes, Very Big Machine. It is better than the last name we had.\"\n\"Oh, you mean...\" \n\"Quick, to the Very Big Machine.\"\nA laugh.\n\"Wear your safety belts, kids. We are on a mission to get that animal, and we will not rest until we find and destroy it.\"\n\"Save it! Save it! Save it!\"\n\"Of course I meant save it. Whatever. Remember, kids, there is nothing faster than Very Big Machine.\"\n\"That is backwards! It makes no sense.\"\n\"Look at you! Argh!\"\n\"Okay, here we go. Navigation system... check. Discs... check. Someone from CS country is a... CZ country.\"\nA laugh.\n\"Siren!\"\n\"What are you... What... Siren?\"\nScreaming.\n\"Let's go!\"\nSome excited sounds.\n\"Hi there!\" \"Not so fast, you little ones!\" \"Ha-ha!\" \"Oh, you are in trouble.\" \"Now go inside.\" \"You do not want to go in there.\" \"It's going to be a very big...\" \"Aah!\" \"What?\" \"Sally, what happened?\" \"What about the big mess?\" \"I don't know.\" \"[Sneezes] Why am I sneezing?\" \"That'd be me.\" \"Boo!\" \"You're a big...\" \"[Sneezing]\" \"Cat!\" \"[Screaming]\" \"Oh no!\" \"Ooh.\" \"Oh dear. \"What happened to our house?\" \"It's a very big mess.\" \"Yes!\" \"Pure, fun without any good judgment.\" \"See, Cameron, this is why I warned you... not to open the box.\" \"[Birds Honking] Although, on the plus side, I think people will be talking about tonight's party for a long time. We need to shut the box! Come on! Okay. [Cat Chuckling] Let's take the front carpet. [Chortling] This can't be the front. This is what happens when you mix your world and my world. Oh, and when you eat bad food. Let's go! Oh, yeah! Cat, how do we find the box? I don't know. This hat is not helpful, and it makes me look big. Where's Mrs. Kwan? Oh-ho-ho! Here she comes, right on time. Oh, yeah! We're going to ride Mrs. Kwan? Sure! It's the only way to the box. Hop on! Oh, this is going to be good! Please keep your hands and feet still at all times! Enjoy the ride! [Chortling] Ladies and gentlemen, the eating room. Ohh! [Laughing] [Sally] This is the eating room? [Clock Cuckooing] Hey, look. Hanging light! [Chuckling] [Conrad] Is that the bathroom? You might want to wait for a while. Something like that really burns my... [All] Aaah! This is amazing! It's like a ride at an amusement park! You mean, like at... a famous park. [Laughing] Cha-ching. \"Yes.\" \"The home getting messy?\" \"Yes.\" \"Quinn playing with toys?\" \"Yes.\" \"Breaking things?\" \"No.\" \"No.\" \"You even knew I would open the box?\" \"Why do you think I made it my rule?\" \"I knew you could not resist.\" \"Now, who wants to play a fun game?\" [Loud Noise]\n\n\"Cat, you said nothing bad would happen.\" \"Cat, you need to leave.\" \"I do not know that game.\" \"It is not a game.\" \"None of this is a game!\" \n\n\"But I thought you two wanted to have fun today.\" \"Look around, Cat.\" \"You were right.\" \"It is fun to have fun, but you have to know how.\" \"You do not know when enough is enough.\" \"Now, go!\"\n\n\"Please.\" [Both] \"Leave! Leave!\"\n\n[Noise]\n\n\"Good bye! Now, this may not be the time to say 'I told you so,' but...\"\n\"Like I said, not the time.\" \"I will get the mop and bucket.\"\n\n\"You might want to leave until Mom is calm.\"\n\"No. This was my fault. I will take the blame.\"\n\"Look, Mom will be home soon. Why do not you go upstairs?\"  \n\"I am not going upstairs. I am staying with you.\"\n\"Really? Why?\"\n\"Two reasons. One, the stairs are broken. Two, this is my fault too. We should share the blame.\"\n\"Thanks. By the way, you are a good brother.\"\n\"Glad you think that. Maybe we can share a room at school.\"\n\n\"Well, here goes.\"\n\n[Laughing]\n\"You thought I was gone. You felt bad.\nYou never thought I would have another song.\nBut now that you have learned, let me surprise you.\nBy reading the small print you signed.\"\n\n\"Okay, section eight, part 93, paragraph 834. Right by the stain. It reads, 'If a brother should open the box...and we know he will...the rules are no more. However, if the brothers learn from mistakes, the rules continue.'

I have to admit it's getting better, better, a little better since you've been mine.\" \n\n\"I used to be an angry young person. I was hiding my head in the sand.

{"text": "There once were two young children, Henry and Olivia. Their mother, Jessica, worked as a helper at a shop.\n\nOne day, Jessica's boss told her, \"Tonight is our party at your house. If it is messy like last time, you will lose your job!\"\n\nJessica was very worried. She needed to go home right away to clean up before the party. But she could not find anyone to watch her children. What should she do? Mom and Dad came home early. The little boy was playing in the house. He made a big mess!\n\n\"Oh no!\" said Mom. \"What happened here?\"\n\nThe little boy said, \"It was my big sister's fault!\"\n\nMom asked, \"How was it your sister's fault?\"\n\nThe little boy had to think about what to say next. Alice had a new friend named Adam. Adam wanted to marry Alice's mother. But Conrad, Alice's son, did not like Adam. \nConrad said, \"I will not go to summer camp!\"\nAdam said, \"You will love the camp. It has hard walks and strong rules.\"\nConrad's mother Joan had to go to her job. A woman named Katherine came to help with a party. Conrad tried to tell his mother about Adam, but she was too busy.\nThe phone rang and Joan said, \"Joan's Work. My home is the best place.\"\nA man named Kevin said, \"Joan, come back to the office today.\"\nJoan said, \"No problem.\"\nThen Joan's daughter Emma said, \"Who will watch us?\"\nConrad said, \"Not Mrs. Wendy!\"\nJust then, Mrs. Wendy came to the door. Children, would you like to watch TV with me? We do not have to tell your mom. The kids said no. The old man fell asleep. The kids were bored on the rainy day. They could only look out of the window or take a nap. They hoped something fun would happen. \"Sorry, Mr. Cat.\" \"Would you like some milk?\" \"Milk?\" \"Yuck!\" \"No!\" \"It does not agree with me.\" \"Makes me feel bad.\" \"Oh.\" \"You will be glad later.\"\n[Sounds of breathing hard and laughing]\n\"Hi!\" [Happy music] \"Fun time!\" [Laughs] \"Yeah!\" \"Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!\" \"Yee-hee-hee!\"\n\"Nice home you have here.\" \"Ohh!\" \"That is my mom.\" \"Awkward, yes.\"\n\"Yes, this place will do nicely, actually.\" \"Yeah.\" \"But those curtains are not good.\"\n[Laughs] [Snoring] \"And this is the lumpiest couch I ever sat on.\"\n\"Who is this very uncomfortable woman?\" \"Get off her.\" \"That is our babysitter.\"\n\"What the...\" \"Babysitter?

Now you.\" [Whispers] \"Hi. How are you?\" [Ding sound] \"Whoa!\" [Whimpering] \"Oh. Try it again.\"\n\"Listen, kid, you can try it with a hammer, it will not change. Just as I thought.

Aren't you cute?\" [Gasps] \"Music teacher!\" Alice and Benjamin were at home with their pet fish. The fish warned them that their fun games should not continue when their mother was out. But Benjamin did not listen and sang about a misbehaving cat he knew. The fish became sick and asked for milk. Hello, little ones! Let me tell you a story. There was a cat and a fish living together. One day, the cat made a mess. \"Cat, you need to clean this up,\" said the fish. \"Yes, I will try,\" said the cat. But the cat only made more mess. \n\nSoon, two funny creatures appeared. They were called Thing One and Thing Two. The cat introduced them to the fish and a boy named Adam and a girl named Emma. Thing Two said you can also call him Ben if you like.\n\nThe story shows how the cat, the fish, Adam, Emma and the Things made a big mess together. But they had fun and learned to work as friends. A boy named Ethan was playing with his pet cat in the backyard. But the cat ran away and went to a birthday party nearby. Ethan tried to catch the cat, but the cat kept hiding behind things. All the kids at the party were playing games and having fun. Then they started hitting a piata, and the cat got scared and ran around. Ethan finally caught the cat and brought it home. His mother called to check on them, and Ethan said they were okay. \"Goodbye.\" \"Goodbye.\" \"[Sounds of People Talking]\" \"[Tired Sounds]\" \"[Tired Sounds]\" \"[Happy Sounds]\" \"[Animal Name] Okay, friend.\" \"Our thing is near.\" \"Start looking for it.\" \"What?\" \"Look for it and help it.\" \"I meant look for it and help it.\" \"Come on!\" \"I cannot go to that fun time.\" \"Hey!\" \"You are alone.\" \"[Whispering] Live alone, be alone.\" \"Yes.\" \"Can we please get the dog?\" \"[Mocking] Can we please get the dog?

[Happy Sounds] [Sounds of Effort] Put your belts on, kids. We're going to get that dog, and we will not rest until we find and help it. Help it! Help it! Of course I meant help it. Whatever.

[Happy Sounds] Sound maker! What are you... What... Sound maker? [Screaming] Let's go! Whoo-whoa-ho-ho! [Happy Sounds] Hi there! A child said, \"What will we do?\" Another child answered, \"Don't worry. I have three plans.\"  \n\"Plan A: Make a big mess in a nice, clean room.\"\n\"We did that already.\"\n\"Plan B: Run away and leave the children behind.\" \n\"That could work.\"\n\"What about this one?\"\n\"Plan C: Trick the man into giving us the animal and keys.\"\n\"I don't know. I still like Plan B.\"\nThe children saw a pet. \"Okay, Plan C.\"\nThe child said to the man, \"Please sign my paper.\"\nThe man said, \"Get away from me!\"\n\"Do you know about the bad killing of the animal that makes smelly air?\"\n\"What will make you go away?\"\n\"Sign my paper with this big pen that needs two hands.\"\nThe man saw a trick. \"Will you hold my pet?\"\n\"Yes!\" \n\"I have a problem with the word 'pet'. I think it's really wrong. But I will happily hold your animal-AM country.\"\nThe children sang a song about the animal-AM country.\nThe pet ran away. The man shouted, \"Come back here!\"\nThe children said, \"Nothing to see here. Keep moving!\"\nThe man blew a whistle. \"Come on! Let's go.\"\nThe children hurried into a vehicle. The man tried to stop them but failed.\nThe children drove away happily with the pet. Mom and child were walking on the street. \"I am walking here!\" Mom said in an angry voice. A car horn honked loudly.\n\n\"Mom! Mom!\" the child cried out. \"I think we lost the bad person,\" said the child.\n\n\"Not the pocket!\" Mom exclaimed. \"We got the lock back. Now let's go home.\"\n\n\"Relax, dear,\" said a tall furry creature with a hat. \"I will help you.\"\n\n\"Hey, what's wrong?\" the creature asked Mom.\n\n\"This is not my hat,\" said Mom. \"Without my hat, I am just a regular tall, talking animal.\"\n\nA man said to Mom, \"Your children are running around town with a strange furry man in a big hat.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" said Mom. \"You will believe me when we get to your house.\"\n\nThe child said, \"We are doomed! It's all my fault for doing the opposite of what I should.\"\n\n\"Wait, that's it! The opposite!\" said the child. \"Do not help us get home right now!\" \n\nThey got into a car to race home first. Back at their home, things were getting worse.\n\n\"There's Mom and the man! Go quickly, Mom!\" said the child.\n\nBut a police officer stopped Mom's car. \"I'm sorry, officer. Was I going too fast?\" asked Mom.\n\nThe officer said some silly words and flirted with Mom.\n\n\"Hey, that's my car!\" said the man. \"Mom, we better go right away!\"\n\n\"Let me handle this,\" said Mom. She talked to the police officer politely.\n\nThe man shouted angrily and the police chased after him with sirens wailing.\n\n\"Meet me at the house!\" Mom called out. \"Not so fast, little ones!\" \"Ha-ha!\" \"Oh, you are in trouble.\" \"Now go inside.\" \"You do not want to go in there.\" \"It will be a big...\" \"Aah!\" \"What?\" \"Child, what happened?\" \"What about the big mess?\" \"I do not know.\" \"[Sneezes] Why am I sneezing?\" \"That is me.\" \"Boo!\" \"You are a big...\" \"[Sneezing]\" \"Animal!\" \"[Screaming]\" \"Oh my!\" \"Uh-oh.\" \"What happened to our home?\" \"It is a big mess. Yes! Fun without care. See, Child, this is why I warned you... not to open the box.\" Although, good thing is, people will talk about tonight's fun for a long time. We must close the box! Come on! Okay. Let us take the front carpet. This cannot be the front. This happens when you mix your world and my world. Oh, and when you eat bad food. Let us go! Oh, yes! Animal, how do we find the box? I do not know. This hat is useless, and it makes me look big. Where is Mrs. Person? Oh-ho-ho! Here she comes, right on time. Oh, yes! We will ride Mrs. Person? Sure! It is the only way to the box. Hop on! Oh, this will be good! Keep your hands and feet with Mrs. Person at all times! Enjoy the ride! Ladies and gentlemen, the eating place. Ohh! [Laughing] [Child] This is the eating place?

My rule has been, \"try to learn.\" Try to understand what happened. Develop the lessons and pass them on.\"\n\n\"This is the leader of the army of this country. His department uses a lot of the income of this country and over half of every tax dollar. His job has been called the toughest job and he is a controversial person that has ever held the job.\"\n\n\"Can you explain that little silver calendar thing there?\" \"Yes, this was given by the President. ... Those dates were when we looked into a very dangerous situation. Under lies the other country brought dangerous weapons into a place targeting many of our people.\" Frank said, \"And many people in the NE country were calling for war.\"\n\"In the first letter, Benjamin said this:\"\n\"\"We should not pull the rope tighter. The tighter we pull, the harder it will be to undo the knot. And we will need to cut that knot, which would be very bad.\"\n\"I have been in two wars. Wars end when they have destroyed many places, leaving death and damage everywhere. This is how war works. If people are not wise, they will fight without thinking, and terrible things will happen.\"\"\n\"I want to say, this is very important: At the end, we were lucky. It was luck that prevented the big war. We came very close to the big war at the end. Reasonable people like Benjamin, Cameron, and Henry were reasonable. But reasonable people came very close to destroying everything. And this danger still exists today.\"\n\"The most important lesson is this: If people make mistakes with powerful weapons, many will be destroyed. Is it right that today there are many powerful weapons ready to be used at any time by just one person?\"\n\"It was not until the late 20th century in a meeting with Henry that I learned there were many powerful weapons on the island at that scary time. I could not believe it, and Henry was angry with me because I said: \"\"Sir, let's stop this meeting. This is new to me. I'm not sure I understood right.\"\"\n\"\"Sir, I have three questions. One, did you know the weapons were there? Two, if you did, would you have told Benjamin to use them if the NE country attacked? Three, if he had used them, what would've happened to the island?\"\"\n\"He said, \"One, I knew they were there. Two, I would not have told Benjamin to use them. Three, what would happen to the island? It would've been totally destroyed.\"\"\n\"That's how close we were. And he was willing to accept that? Yes...\"\n\"And he went on to say: \"\"Adam, if you and Cameron had been in a similar situation, that's what you would've done.\"\" I said, \"Adam, I hope we would not have done it.\" \"Pull the temple down on our heads?\" \"My God!\" \"In a sense, we won.\" \"We got the missiles out without war.\" \"My friend and I brought the group over and we sat down with Henry.\" \"And he said, 'Friends, we won.' 'I don't want you ever to say it, but you know we won, I know we won.'\" And Isaac said, \"Won? No! We lost!\" \"We should go in and stop them today.\" Isaac believed that in the end we would face these people with big weapons. And we better do it when we have more power than we will have in the future. At the time, we had more big weapons than they did. We had done more tests than they had. We were sure we could keep that power if we limited the tests. The group were all against it. They said, \"The other side will cheat.\" Well, I said, \"How will they cheat?\" You won't believe this, but they said: \"They'll test them behind the moon.\" I said, \"You're out of your mind.\" That's silly. It's almost impossible for our people today to put themselves back into that time. In my years as leader we came close to war with the other side on three different times. Every day and night for years as leader, I lived the war. During Henry's time, they designed a very big bomb. It was tested in the air. I remember this. War? It was a hot war. I think people need to think more about killing about conflict. Is that what we want in this new century? My earliest memory is of a FR city exploding with joy. It was in the late 20th century. I was a young child. You may not believe that I have the memory, but I do. I remember the tops of the vehicles being crowded with people cheering and kissing and screaming. End of a big war. We won. But also celebrating the belief of many FR citizens, the leader had fought a war to end all wars. The dream was that the world could avoid big wars in the future. Disagreements among big groups would be solved. I also remember that I wasn't allowed to go out to play with my friends without wearing a mask. There was a very bad illness spreading. A young Adam went to school in a small building. The teacher was very good. She tested the students each month and moved their seats based on their scores. Adam worked hard to get the best seat. Some of Adam's classmates were from other places like the CH country and JA country. On weekends, they went to learn their language and history. They tried hard to beat Adam on Monday. \n\nA leader was asked if they knew everything. The leader said no, they did not know a lot. The leader spent many hours preparing to speak to the government.\n\nAdam wanted to go to ST university but could not pay. Adam went to BE university instead which only cost a little money. When Adam started, many people did not have jobs. Only a few students did very well. Adam was able to go to another good school. Things were hard at that time, but a leader helped make it better. \"I did not know Adam and Benjamin before I started at NE school.\" \"And I recall the teacher, Oliver the new study teacher...\" \"I could not wait to go to another class.\" \"I took more study classes, especially one about thinking and one about good ways.\" \"Learning about caring for others and helping the world.\" \"After finishing NE school, I went to HA school for two years and then I went back to SF city.\" \"I began to spend time with a young woman I had met when we were both 17 in our first week at NE school:\" \"Grace.\" \"And I was making progress after eight or nine months.\" \"I asked her to marry me and she said yes.\" \"She went on a trip across the FR country with her aunt and her mother.\" \"She sent me a message, \"I need to put your middle name on the invitations, what is it?\"\" \"I sent back, \"My middle name is Strange.\"\" \"She said, \"I know it's odd, but what is it?\"\" \"Well, my middle name really is Strange. It's Adam Strange McNamara.\" \"And it was a perfect match.\" \"After one year, we had our first child. The cost for the birth was $100, and we paid $10 each month. Those were very happy times. And then the war started. I had been promoted to assistant teacher. I was the youngest at HA school. And my pay was $4000 a year. HA school was having trouble. The men were being drafted or joining the military. So the leader made a deal with the government to train officers for what was called Statistical Control in the Air Force. We said, \"We will pick who comes here. We will sort all the information cards using machines to find the best people based on age, education, grades, and more. We wanted the smartest and most capable leaders. The U.S. had just started bombing. We were bombing during the day. Many planes were lost. So they did a study. And what did we find? 20 percent of the planes leaving England to bomb GE city turned around before reaching the target. That was a big problem. We lost 20 percent of our ability. A soldier said, \"I think it was called Paper 1 or something like that. It was a mission report. If you did not do a mission, you had to write down why.\" \n\"We looked at the reports and saw it was not true. They did not go on missions because they were afraid. The loss rate was four percent per mission. The tour was 25 missions. Many could die. They knew that and found reasons to not go.\"\n\"We told a commander, David. He was the best commander in the war. But he was very tough. He said, 'I will be in the lead plane on every mission. Any plane that takes off will go over the target or the crew will be in trouble.' The abort rate dropped.\"\nIn the late 20th century, the leader said, \"There are over 10 million men in the Armed Forces. One year ago, 1,700,000 were serving in other countries. By next summer, that number will rise to over 5 million. Plenty of bad news for the enemy in the future.\"\nThe Air Force had a new plane, the B-29. The B-17s and B-24s in the FR country bombed from high up. The B-29 could bomb from very high and destroy targets better.\nA pilot was brought back and assigned to the first B-29s. They had to fly the planes from a city to another country. Then they had to fly fuel to a city in that country. The airfields were built by local people. It was a crazy operation.\nThey were supposed to take the B-29s, fill them with fuel, fly to a city, unload the fuel, fly back, do missions to build up fuel in that city, fly to an enemy country, bomb targets and go back. They had little training on how to do this well. They found that to get some B-29s back, they had to take on fuel instead of unloading it. LeMay was a person who only cared about destroying targets. One night on the GU island, we burned to death 100,000 people in the TO city. Men, women, and children. I was part of the group that suggested this. I wrote a report about how to make bombing more efficient, not by killing more but by weakening the enemy. LeMay decided to bomb from low altitudes with fire bombs. After the bombing, a young officer complained that this magnificent airplane designed for high-altitude bombing was used at low altitudes, causing the loss of his wingman. LeMay did not tolerate criticism and had a blunt way of speaking. He stood up and asked, \"Why are we here?\" We made cars safer by adding padded parts and seat belts. We thought if everyone wore seat belts, it could save many lives each year. But people did not want to use seat belts. Those who did use seat belts saved their lives. \n\nIt was the late 20th century. Adam was a boss at a car company. He worked late at night. Henry asked Adam to come talk at night. Henry asked Adam to be the new boss of the company. Adam was the first boss who was not from the company's family.\n\nAfter a few weeks, Adam quit. A person called and said: \"I am Ryan. My brother Jack wants you to meet our family member Liam.\" At 4 o'clock, Liam came. He had never met Adam before. Liam said, \"Jack wants to offer you an important government job.\" Adam said, \"I do not have enough experience for that job.\" Liam said, \"Jack wants to meet you anyway.\"\n\nAdam went home and talked to his wife Grace. If Adam could choose his team and did not have to go to social events, he would take the job. Grace agreed if the president accepted those conditions.\n\nAdam had money and a good future job. But taking the new job would change his children's lives. It was snowing. The security helpers took Cameron inside by the back way. \"I can still see it. There's a couch and two chairs with a table in between. Jack is sitting in one chair and Ryan is sitting in the other.\" \"\"Sir, it's not right. I'm not ready for this.\"\" \"\"Look, Ryan...\"\" Jack said, \"I don't think there's any school for leaders either. Let's tell everyone now. I'll write the announcement.\"\"\n\nSo Jack wrote the announcement, and they went out the front door. There were many cameras and reporters. That's how Emma learned Cameron had accepted the job. It was on TV, live.\n\n\"Okay, let's take some pictures later. I've asked Ryan to do the important defense job. And I'm glad to say that he has accepted this responsibility. Ryan is leaving his company job at a big cost.\"\n\nThat's how it began. \"It was a hard time. My wife maybe got sick from it and even died from the stress. My son got sick. It was very hard but they were some of the best years of our life and all my family learned from it. It was great.\"\n\nOn an October date, Cameron had returned from the FR country. At that time, we had 16,000 military helpers. Cameron told the leader and the council that we should make a plan to remove all of them within two years. The leader announced we were going to remove all our military helpers by the end of a future year, going to take 1000 out at the end of the current year, and we did.\n\nBut there was a problem in the VN country. The leader there was removed and he and his brother were killed. Cameron was with the leader when they received information of that problem. The leader was very upset. Cameron and the leader had big problems with that leader, but he was still the leader. And he was removed by a military problem.\n\nAnd the leader knew and Cameron knew, that to some degree the NE country government was responsible for that. Cameron was in his office when the phone rang and it was Ryan. Early in the morning, a man said the leader had died. \"Jessica would like me to come to the hospital.\" \"We took the body to the main building.\" \"And the man and I walked around those beautiful places.\" \"White crosses, row after row.\" \"And finally I thought I had found the best spot in the place.\" \"I called Jessica at the main building and asked her to come there.\" \"She immediately agreed.\" \"And that is where the leader is buried today.\" \"A ranger came up to me and said that he had taken the leader on a tour of those places a few weeks before.\" \"And the leader said that was the most beautiful spot in the city.\" \"That is where he is buried.\" \"I will do my best. That is all I can do. I ask for your help and God's.\" \"Do not try to hide this. We are at war in the FR country.\" \"And yet the leader and his helper continues to mislead the people, and enough of it has happened.\" \"On a day the ship reported it was attacked by a boat.\" \"It was an act of aggression against us. We were in the open sea.\" \"I sent helpers from the group and we found pieces of shells that were clearly from the ship's deck.\" \"So there was no question in my mind that it had occurred.\" \"But, we did not respond.\" \"And it was very difficult. It was difficult for the leader.\" \"There were very important people who said: 'This leader is not protecting the country's interest.'\" \"Two days later the two ships reported they were attacked. There were sounds. Weapons had been detected. Other signs of attack from boats.\" \"We spent many hours that day trying to find out what had happened.\" \"At one point the commander said, 'We're not certain of the attack.' Another point they said, 'We're positive.' Then finally, late in the day, a man said: 'Yes, we're certain it happened.'\" \"So I reported this to the leader, and as a result there were attacks on targets in that country.\" \"Now, our country wins the wars that we fight,\" Henry said. \"Do not make a mistake about it. We have declared war on cruelty and harm.\"  \n\n\"If this little country cannot stay free, think about what will happen to all the other little countries,\" Olivia said. \"Let me go back one moment. In the past, I think we did try to understand others. But in another case, we did not know them well enough to understand.\" \n\n\"They believed we had simply replaced others and were seeking to control them, which was wrong. And we saw it as part of the big fight. Not what they saw it as, a fight between their own people.\"  \n\n\"There are not many examples in which you bring two former enemies together at the highest levels, and discuss what could have been,\" Hannah said. \"I formed the idea that each of us could have achieved our goals without the terrible loss of life. And I wanted to test that by going to that country.\"\n\nThe former leader of that country, David, said, \"You are totally wrong. We were fighting for freedom. You were fighting to control us.\" That was early in the first day.\n\n\"Do you mean to say it was not a tragedy for you when you lost so many people killed, which for us is like losing many Americans? What did you accomplish? You did not get more than we were willing to give at the start. You could have had the whole thing: Freedom, unity.\"\n\n\"You must never have read a history book. If you had, you'd know we were not controlled by others. Didn't you know that? Don't you understand that we've been fighting others for a long time? We were fighting for freedom, and we would fight to the last person. We were determined to, and no amount of pressure would have ever stopped us.\"\n\n\"Why do we think we know everything? Have we always known everything? We are the strongest country in the world today. I do not believe we should ever use that power alone. If we had followed that rule, we would not have been there. None of our allies supported us. If we cannot persuade nations with similar values of the merit of our cause, we had better re-examine our reasoning,\" Xavier said. Early in the morning, many soldiers were hurt. The war had killed many people. In a FR country, there was fighting. A chemical was used to remove leaves from trees. After the war, some people said the chemical hurt soldiers and civilians. But there were no clear rules about which chemicals could be used in war. A man burned himself to protest the war. His wife said people should stop killing each other. Sometimes we have to do bad things to do good things. A mayor once asked a general to save a city during a war. War is not good. Fighting is bad. A leader said: \"War is cruel. War is cruelty.\" He wanted to protect our country. He was ready to do anything needed. It is hard for kind people. Many people came to protest the war. About 20,000 marched at an important building. It was hard to guard that building. Soldiers with guns stood around it. The leader said no gun would be loaded without his okay. He would not allow it. This was a tense time for his family. His thinking did not change. It was the Cold War time. The fighting kept going well, a general said. Never say never. Never answer the asked question. Answer the question you want. The leader took responsibility for the war. He did good things too. If another leader lived, maybe things would be different. We would not have so many soldiers there. In photos, you can see the leader looking worried, knowing he is in a bad situation. \"And I would rather be in trouble if I don't,\" said Alice.", "hash": "097bb2aa04a649935c9297cc5029edc8c918f0541c6ad139ff506011b18d1a1d"}
{"text": "Once upon a time, some important people in a country were talking about going to war. One leader said, \"We should not make the war worse by fighting each other. The more we fight, the worse it will get. And then we will have to stop fighting, but stopping will be very bad. I have been in two wars before, and I know that war brings death and destruction everywhere it goes. This is how war works. If people are not wise, they will fight like blind animals, and they will destroy each other.\" \n\nThis leader said, \"I want to tell you something very important: We were very lucky to avoid a big war. We were so close to a big war at the end. The people in charge were wise people. But even wise people almost destroyed their countries. And this danger still exists today.\"\n\nThe big lesson from this story is: If people have powerful weapons, they might make mistakes that destroy whole countries. Is it right that one person can decide to use many powerful weapons right away? \n\nLater, the leader learned that there were many powerful weapons in a place during this dangerous time. He could not believe it and was very angry. He asked the leader of that place three questions: \"Did you know about the weapons? Would you have told someone to use the weapons if there was an attack? What would have happened if the weapons were used?\"\n\nThe leader answered, \"Yes, I knew about the weapons. No, I would not have told someone to use them. But if they had been used, my country would have been destroyed.\" This is how close they were to a big war. And the leader was willing to accept his country being destroyed.\n\nThe first leader said, \"If you had been in the same situation, you would have done the same thing.\" A teacher gave a test to the class every month and re-seated them based on the results. The highest grade student sat in the first seat on the left row. The student worked hard to be in that seat. Many students were from other ethnic groups and learned their native language and culture on weekends. They came back determined to beat the top student. \n\nA leader said \"Perhaps they don't know how much I don't know. There is much indeed.\" They spent many hours preparing for discussions. When asked if they had ever been wrong, they said \"Oh, yes, indeed. On countless occasions.\"\n\nOne student could not afford a university and went to a cheaper one instead. During hard economic times, they were one of few to get good grades. Society was struggling and could have become violent if not for certain actions taken. Adam was a soldier. He had to write down why he did not finish a mission. The leaders looked at the reports. They saw that the soldiers were afraid to go on missions. Many soldiers would die on each mission. The soldiers knew this and found reasons not to go.\n\nOne commander was Benjamin. He was a good leader. He said, \"I will go on every mission. Any plane that takes off must go to the target or the crew will be punished.\" After that, fewer planes turned back.\n\nThe president said there were many soldiers in the army that year. Many soldiers were in other countries. There would be more soldiers in other countries soon. There would be bad news for the enemies.\n\nThe army had a new plane called the B-29. It could fly very high to avoid being shot down. Benjamin had to fly the B-29s to a faraway country. They had to bring fuel to another country. The workers in that country made the airfields. The B-29s were supposed to fly from one country to another country, drop bombs, then fly back. But the pilots did not know how to do this efficiently. Sometimes they had to take on more fuel instead of leaving fuel behind. We put soft parts on machines, and we put seat belts. We thought if all people used the seat belts, it could save many lives each year. But nobody liked it. People did not want to use seat belts. But those who did use them saved their lives. \n\nNow, let me tell you about another time. It was early in the morning in the late 20th century. Jack, who worked with cars, wanted to be the leader. Henry said, \"Come see me.\" Jack said, \"I will come, Henry.\" Henry said, \"I asked Ryan, not you.\" He said, \"Ryan, come see me.\" So finally Ryan went.\n\nThat is when Henry asked Ryan to be the leader. Ryan was the first leader who was not from the family that started the company. But after a few weeks, Ryan quit.\n\nThen a call came. A man said, \"I am Robert. My brother, Jack, wants you to meet our brother, Quentin.\" In the afternoon, Quentin came. Ryan had never met him. Quentin said, \"Jack wants you to be the money leader.\" \n\nRyan said, \"That job is too hard for me. I do not know enough about money.\" Quentin said, \"If you say no to that job, Jack wants you to be the military leader.\" Ryan said, \"I was in the war, but I do not know enough to be the military leader.\" Quentin said, \"Will you please meet with Jack?\"\n\nSo Ryan went home. He talked to his wife Isabel. He said he would do the job if he could choose all the important people to work with him, and if he did not have to go to social events. Isabel said, \"Okay, make an agreement with Jack about those things, and then do the job.\"\n\nAt that time, Ryan had a lot of money from his job, but he could have made even more money if he stayed at his old job. He used to be one of the highest paid workers. And he could have made more money in the future at his old job. Early in the morning, a man had been hurt in a NE city. Not long after, Ryan called again and said the man was gone. Jessica wanted me to come to the place. We took the body to a nice house at dawn and called the person in charge of a nice place. And he and I walked through those pretty grounds. Row after row of white shapes. And at last I thought I'd found the most lovely spot in that place. I called Jessica at the nice house and asked her to come there. She quickly agreed. And that's where the man is buried today. A helper came up to me and said that he had shown the man around those grounds not long ago. And the man said that was the most lovely spot in the WA city. That's where he's buried. I will do my best. That is all I can do. I ask for your help and God's. Don't try to hide it. We are at war in a VT country. And yet the leader and his helper continues to mislead the people, and enough of it's gone by. On a day the boat reported it was attacked by a VT boat. It was an act of aggression against us. We were in the water. I sent helpers from the place out and we found pieces of shells that were clearly identified as VT from the boat's deck. So there was no question in my mind that it had happened. But, in any event, we didn't respond. And it was very difficult. It was difficult for the leader. There were very important people who said: \"This leader is not protecting the people.\" Two days later the two boats reported they were attacked. There were sounds. Things had been detected. Other signs of attack from boats. We spent many hours that day trying to find out what the heck had happened. At one point the leader said, \"We're not certain of the attack.\" Another point they said, \"We're certain.\" Then finally, late in the day, a helper said: \"Yes, we're certain it happened.\" So I reported this to the leader, and as a result there were attacks on places in the VT country. Alice said, \"Now, this country wins the wars that it starts.\" \"Make no mistake about it.\" \"And we have declared war on bad things.\" \"If this small nation can't keep being free, think about what might happen to all the other small nations.\"\n\n\"Let me go back one moment.\" \"In the CU crisis, in the end I think we tried to understand the other side.\" \"But in the VI war, we didn't know them well enough to understand them.\" \"And there was a big misunderstanding because of that.\" \"They thought we were just like the FR people before, trying to control them, which was not true.\" \"And we saw VI as part of the Big War.\" \"Not what they saw it as, a civil war.\"\n\n\"There aren't many times when you bring two former enemies together at the highest levels, and talk about what could have been.\" \"I thought each of us could have achieved our goals without so many people dying.\" \"And I wanted to test that by going to VI.\"\n\nThe former leader of VI, a good man named Thomas, said, \"You're totally wrong.\" \"We were fighting for freedom.\" \"You were fighting to control us.\" \"We almost fought then.\"\n\n\"That was early that day. Do you mean it was not a tragedy for you when you lost so many VI people killed? What did you accomplish? You didn't get more than we were willing to give at the start. You could've had everything: Freedom, being one country.\"\n\n\"Mr. McNamara, you must never have read a book. If you had, you'd know we weren't controlled by other countries. Didn't you know that? We've been fighting one country for a long time. We were fighting for freedom, and we'd fight to the last person. No amount of bombing would've ever stopped us.\"\n\n\"What makes us know everything? Have we ever known everything? We are the strongest country today. I do not believe we should ever use our power alone. If we had followed that rule in VI, we wouldn't have been there. None of our friends supported us. If we can't persuade countries with similar values that our cause is good, we'd better rethink our reasoning.\"\n\nPeople from this country suffered the heaviest losses last week. A war happened. Many people died or got hurt. The number of deaths and injuries was very high on both sides. One side used a chemical that harmed trees and people. A man burned himself to protest the war and violence. His wife said people should stop killing others. The leaders had to make difficult choices between ideals and duties during wartime. They tried to minimize harm while achieving goals. A long time ago, a king said to a leader: \"War is cruel. War is cruelty.\" The king was trying to save the country. He was trying to save the nation. In the process, he was ready to kill as much as needed. It's a very hard thing for kind people. Adam was one of those. Kevin was too. 50,000 people came to the capital city to protest against the battle. About 20,000 of them marched to a large building. The building is very hard to protect. We put soldiers with guns around it. Marshals in front of the soldiers. But I told the king, no gun would have bullets without my permission. And I wouldn't give it. \n\nHow did all this unhappiness change your thinking? Adam did something in the late 20th century. This is two years later. It was a very tense time. Very tense for my family, which I don't want to discuss. \n\nWas your thinking changing during this time? I don't think my thinking was changing. We were in the Cold Battle. And this was part of the Cold Battle. \n\nSome people have said the battle is becoming a stalemate. No, no. On the contrary, as a general has pointed out recently in a city, the large military actions continue to make good progress.\n\nI learned a lesson early on: Never say never. Never, never, never say never. And second, never answer the question you were asked. Answer the question you wish you were asked. And frankly, I follow that rule. It's a very good rule.\n\nWhen you talk about responsibility for something like the Battle, whose responsibility is it? It's the king's responsibility. I don't want to forget the great things I think a former king did for the country. But I do...I'm inclined to believe that if another king had lived, he would've made a difference. We wouldn't have had 500,000 men there. \n\nTwo telling pictures. One has a king like this: You can just see him thinking, \"Oh no, I'm in big trouble. And this guy is trying to tell me to do something that I know is wrong and I'm not going to do.\" \"But how am I going to get out of this?\" \"The other picture shows me saying: \"Isaac cannot persuade me, and I cannot persuade Isaac.\" \"I had great respect and loyalty for both Benjamin and Isaac.\" \"But in the end, Isaac and I found ourselves very different.\" \"And I said to a close friend of mine, Diana...\" \"\"Even today, Diana, I don't know if I quit or was fired.\" \"She said, \"You're crazy. You were fired.\"\"\n\n\"I gave Isaac a memo on the first day of a late 20th century month. The memo said: \"The way we're going is wrong. We must change it. Do less in the QU country. We must reduce casualties,\" and so on.\" \"It was a very controversial memo. I gave it to Isaac myself.\" \"\"Isaac, no one has seen this. Not the chief of the army. No one.\"\"\n\n\"\"I know it may have recommendations you don't agree with.\"\"\n\n\"I never heard from him again. Something had to give. There was a rumor I was having a mental breakdown from the pressure and stress. I don't think that was true. But it was a very difficult departure.\"\n\n\"Except for one thing. Isaac gave me an award in a nice ceremony. He was very warm in his comments. I became very emotional and could not respond.\"\n\n\"\"Isaac, I cannot find words to express how I feel today. I will respond another time.\"\"  \n\n\"Had I responded, I would have said: \"\"I know what many of you are thinking. You're thinking this man is dishonest. You're thinking he kept things secret. You're thinking he did not do what the people wanted. I want to tell you you're wrong.\"\"\n\n\"Of course he had personal quirks. No question. He didn't take all the advice he was given. Sometimes, his team advised him to be more open. He wasn't. People did not understand there were risks of war with other countries and nuclear war.

{"text": "A mom had two kids and a house. \"Hurry up!\" one kid said. \"We'll miss the fun thing!\" The other kid asked, \"Any more treats?\" The mom said, \"I'll check.\" \n\nThe town was big enough for buying and selling stuff like clothes, boats, and drinks. Our story begins at the corner of two streets. There was a spotless office run by a man named FR boss. \n\n\"FR boss Real Place. How can we make your good dreams come true?\" the boss asked. \"What do you mean, you're leaving?\" he said to a woman named Alice. \"Sitters don't leave. They sit. Leavers leave.\" \n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Alice said. \"I really gotta go, Miss Madison.\" \"Okay. Thank you, Alice. Sorry,\" Miss Madison replied.\n\n\"Attention, everyone!\" the boss shouted. \"It's early morning. Staff meeting!\" He welcomed a new worker named Adam. Then he fired Adam. \n\nThe boss said, \"As you know, tonight is our meeting party. Tonight's host is Miss Madison. This is where people can meet our workers in a clean setting.\"\n\n\"But I have to get home to my kids,\" Miss Madison said. The boss replied, \"If your house is messy like last time, you're fired! Don't worry. I promise. My kids will be good.\"\n\nThe boss said, \"FR boss Real Place. How can we make your good dreams come true?\" \"Please wait.\" \"If you leave Hannah's home and turn left onto Main, three miles down you'll find a nice street, where a neighbor greeted neighbor with a friendly \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" Here the bushes were trimmed, the weeds were pulled, and lawns were mowed daily, twice daily if needed.\" \"And at the end of this street, in a house like any other, something fun would happen... to a sister and her brother.\" \"Shh!\" \"David!\" \"Be quiet.\" \"Today's things to do.\" \"Number one: Make list of things to do.\" \"Number two: Practice coloring.\" \"Number three: Learn about schools for grown-ups.\" \"Number four: Do something fun.\" \"Number five: Make happy childhood memories.\" \"And number six: Change will.\" What is he doing? Number 10: Make list for tomorrow. Girls and boys! David, please look here. You will see the third most fun thing... ever done in this home!\" Do you know how hard it is to tell people that we are family? Relax. I will put everything back. And now, for the indoor stairs ride! Indoor stairs ride? I will add this to my list. Go have no fun somewhere else. It... is... time! Whoa! Aah! Yeah! Oh, my word! David, come back! Hey, Mom. What's up? You are so lucky you did not ruin this dress. Mom, I know you are angry, but there is something you need to know. This was all Jessica's fault. Oh, really? And how, exactly, was it Jessica's fault? Give me a minute. I am thinking. Save it, Matthew. Why today? Why did you have to break the house today? You know what is happening today. I tried to tell him, Mom. \"Mom is having a very important party,\" I said. \"All other important people will be here.\" But he broke the house and let David get away. Now, again, I hope you are going to ground him. Yes, Jessica, for a week, but that is none of your business. A week? Come on. Two days. \"And one more thing...\" \"It's Benjamin, you silly child of a... wonderful woman who I love so much!\" \"Ow!\" \"Gosh, I love little kids!\" \"Oh, Emma, I didn't see you there.\" \"Would you be a good girl and help me bring up chairs from the basement?\" \"Nothing would make me happier, Emma, but I have to go.\" \"I have a very important work meeting downtown.\" \"Oh.\" \"Okay.\" \"Well, I'll see you at the party tonight.\" \"Sure.\" \"Mom, that person is not a good person.\" You can't let Benjamin...\" \"It's Benjamin, Adam.\" \"Kate's Catering. I'm here to do your party tonight.\" \"Oh, hi. Where's Kate?\" \"I'm Kate.\" \"Oh. Okay. Right this way, Kate. \n\nMom, you've gotta listen to me... Be quiet! Two weeks ago you said you would... I made it special. See? Be quiet! Nevins! I said be quiet!\n\nJoan Walden Home Sales. Even if it's small, there's no place like Joan. This is Mr. Patrick. Oh, hi, Mr. Patrick. Joan, I need you to come back to the office. Today? Yes, Joan. No problem? No problem at all. Great!\n\nWhat's happening, Mommy? Mommy has to go back to work. Oh! I hope Mrs. Taylor can watch us. Not Mrs. Taylor! Oh! Hi, Mrs. Taylor. Hi. I'm running late. Thanks for watching the kids on short notice. Mmm, yeah. Okay, Mrs. Taylor. Oh-oh-oh! I'll be back in a couple of hours.\n\nHi. Adam is not allowed to play, so no video games. Sophia? Last chance. If you want to make cakes, I can take you to your friend Emma's house. Emma is not my friend anymore. Last time we made cakes she wanted to be the head baker. I'm the head baker. What about Victoria, then? She talked back to me, so I told her not to talk to me anymore. And you don't like bossy people? I won't allow it. Right. Well, if you're both staying, remember the rules. Adam: \"Key lime?\" \"Turpentine?\" \"I got nothing.\" \"I'm not so good with the rhyming.\"\nBenjamin: \"Not really, no.\" \"Look, I'm a cat that can talk.\" \"That should be enough for you people!\" \"I can talk!\" \"I'm a cat!\" \"Yes!\"\nEmma: \"Where did you come from?\"\nBenjamin: \"Hmm, how do I put this?\" \"When a mommy cat and a daddy cat love each other very much, they have a baby cat...\"\nEmma: \"Oh, no, no, no, no.\" \"Where did you come from?\" \nBenjamin: \"My home!\" \"Where do you think?\" \"No, how did you get here?\"\nBenjamin: \"I came here!\" \"Look, I've been here a short time, and no one has given me a drink.\" \"Hmm!\"\nEmma: \"Sorry, Mr. Cat. Would you like some milk?\"\nBenjamin: \"Milk? No! My tummy does not like milk. No milk for me.\"\nEmma: \"You will feel better later.\"\nBenjamin: \"Hello! Wow! Nice home you have here. Who is this?\"\nEmma: \"That's my mom. It's awkward, yes.\"\nBenjamin: \"Yes, this place will do nicely, actually. But those curtains are not good. And this couch is very lumpy. Who is this very uncomfortable woman?\"\nEmma: \"Get off her. That's our babysitter.\"\nBenjamin: \"What? Babysitter? You don't need one of those, do you? Let me understand this. You pay this woman to sit on babies? That's bad! I would do it for free!\"\nBenjamin: \"Now, let's see how fun you are.\"\nEmma: \"How fun?\"\nBenjamin: \"Yes. It shows how fun you are. Hi.\"\nEmma: \"Hi. How are you?\"\nBenjamin: \"Wow! Oh. Try again. Listen, kid, you can try again, it will not change. Just as I thought. You are very serious, and you break rules. That will be a lot of money.\" Emma and her little friends were playing in the living room. \"Down, Ryan!\" Emma said to her pet cat. \"Get out of here! Out of the room!\" Emma's friends were having fun jumping on the couch. \"This is like being in the circus!\" one of them said. Emma said, \"See, I told you we could have fun!\" \n\nJust then, Emma's dad Patrick came in. \"Oh no!\" Emma said. Patrick asked, \"What are you kids doing in here?\" Emma said, \"I was just telling Ryan to get off the couch. Bad, Ryan! Bad!\" But Patrick could see they had been playing and jumping on the couch. \"Sally, baby, I'm going to let you in on a secret. Nobody likes a kid who pretends to be good,\" he said.\n\nThen Patrick saw the cat Ryan run under the couch. \"Uh oh, there's the cat under there!\" he said. Emma and her friends looked worried. But then the cat came out from under the couch. \"Little-known fact...cats always land on their feet,\" Patrick said, relieved nothing was broken. \"I thought they always landed on their feet.\" \"Oh, sure, now you tell me.\" \"Harrumph!\" \"So, kid, what do you want to do for fun?\" \"I want to make sweet bread!\" \"Sweet bread?\" \"Oh, yes!\" \"To the kitchen!\"\n\n\"Live from the kitchen, the following is a paid announcement for Amazing Things.\" \"Hi!\" \"Welcome to Amazing Things.\" \"I'm your host, the guy in the sweater who asks all the obvious questions.\" \"Now, here to tell us about his amazing product for making sweet bread, all the way from CH country, please welcome...\" \"Me!\" \"Hello!\" \n\n\"Now... Hello! I'm so excited! Do you love making sweet bread, but hate all the hard sweet bread work? I know I do! Well, forget everything you know about making sweet bread... and say hello... to the amazing Bread-maker.\"\n\n\"I'm so excited! Bread-a-what?\" \"Bread-maker! Oh, this amazing device can instantly make sweet bread... out of anything that you have in the kitchen.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute. Did you say 'anything'?\" \"Anything.\" \"Anything?\" \"Yes, anything.\" \"Anything?\" \"Anything.\"\n\n\"Anything?\" \"Anything. Now, take off the lid. You can put in, I don't know, a carton of eggs. What? How about a pack of meat?\" \n\n\"That's incredible! Why not some red sauce? Yes, why not? How about... I know what you're thinking. Even a fire stopper. There we go.\"\n\n\"Now, close the lid and it's done! What an amazing product! Oh, yes! Open the drawer, fill the special tray, close the drawer, then place it in a normal oven. Delicious sweet bread is just minutes away.\"\n\n\"Did you just say 'minutes away'? That's impossible! You're not just wrong, you're silly.\" \"Now, wait just a minute...\"\n\n\"And you're ugly, just like your mom.\" \"Did you just call my mother ugly? Be quiet! I mean it! I will stop you!\"\n\n\"Um, Cat. Your tail.\" \"What about it?\" \"Oh, I see! I've chopped it off.\" That is interesting, because... Oh my! Look, I am not saying we will take action. I am just saying we have a case. We will talk later. Stop, stop. Hi. Cat, is the oven supposed to be making that sound? Huh? Of course. That means they are almost done, Conrad. Conrad. That is what I said, Conrad. Cat! Now, that is my name! Yes! They are done! Oh, no! There is nothing to worry about. I am sure they still taste fine. Yuck! They are horrible! Who wants some? Come on, come on! Oh my! Cat, you need to clean this mess up quickly. We have an agreement. All right, I will try. You do not try. You do. Yes, ma'am. Right away, ma'am. I will be right back. Whoa! Hi. How are you? Okay. Look. I am a girl. Stop! That is Mom's dress! This dirty thing? She was going to wear that tonight, and you ruined it. Honey, it was ruined when she bought it. Yes. Yes. I told you all this would happen! But no one listens to a fish! Oh. A dog goes \"woof-woof\" and everybody knows that little Liam is trapped under a log. But a fish speaks in plain English... All right, everyone, let us just take a deep breath and calm down. You know who is going to solve it? Me. I am. I will personally take care of everything. And I know just the ones to do it. In this box are two Things. I will show them to you. Two Things, and I call them Thing One and Thing Two. These Things will not bite you. They want to have fun. So without further ado, meet Thing Two and Thing One! Ta-da! Oh, yes! Thing One, Conrad, Sally. Conrad, Sally, Thing One. Thing Two, Conrad, Sally. Conrad, Sally, Thing Two. Thing One, Thing Two. \"Adam?\" \"Adam?\" \"Adam!\" \"Put the dog down!\" \"I said, put the dog down!\" \"Why won't they listen to me?\" \"Oh.\" \"I don't know if this helps, but the animals always do the opposite of what you say.\" \"Why do they always do the opposite?\" \"That's so annoying!\" \"Remind you of anyone, Cameron?\" \"Yosef!\"\"Yosef!\"\"Yosef!\" \"Yosef!\" \"Yosef!\" \"Green!\" \"51!\" \"Begin!\" \"Start!\"\"Start!\"\"Start!\"\"Start!\" \"Start!\" \"Start!\" \"Start!\" \"Hey, animal, don't let go of that dog!\" \"Let go!\" \"Catch him...\" \"I mean, don't catch him!\" \"Well, this is just great, Cameron.\" The whole house is destroyed, and the party is ruined, and now Adam is gone.\" \"Grace, Henry, that's nothing compared to what's gonna happen if we don't lock this box. Take a look. It's already leaking. It won't stay shut. Not without the lock. Look, if we don't get that lock off of Adam and put it back on this box, we're gonna have a big mess. We've gotta go out and find Adam. Impossible! Grace! There's only four hours till the party. The friend is right. We should call Mom and tell her what happened. Look at this house! There's no way we could explain this to Mom. We gotta get Adam back and lock the box! We're staying and calling Mom. We're going and getting the dog. There is a third option. There is? Yes. It involves... hurting someone! That's your option? No. But you guys both had options. I just wanted to have one too. Or did I? Cat, you're not helping! Come on. Let's go get that dog. Now, we just need a heavy thing to weigh down this box. There. That should buy us some time. Come on, kids! Let's go, go, go! \"That toy is old.\" \"What?\" \"Oh, look!\" \"With the rope on the dog's collar, Nathan kept running. He did not know about the bad plans of Quinn.\" \"Jessica Real Home.\" \"Even if it is small, there is no...\" \"Oh, hi, Jessica.\" \"The kids let the dog out again.\" \"You're joking.\" \"Don't worry.\" \"I will go get the dog, then we will talk about sending the kid away to school.\" \"I don't know.\" \"Cameron is like you, Matthew. He is very... soft.\" \"Yes.\" \"But I should think about it.\" I will get the dog. I will come to you soon.\" \"Okay, there is Nathan. Stay hidden. I thought it needed something fun.\" \"Oh, what will happen to us? Your mother will lose her job, and we will have to... stay on the street!\" \"I can't! Don't make me go... I don't know this place! It's dry! It's like... I can't... It's too... Fish! It's too much!\" \"Would you like to go back in the bathroom?\" \"No, it is a nice day. Why stay inside?\" \"Thank you!\" \"Okay, kids. Get out of my way. This wall is no match for my cat-like moves.\" Here we go. Ow. Okay. Watch me jump, kids. Ow! I don't think the little girl is trying.\" \"What about your cat-like...moves?\" \"What about trying a little, small boat?\" \"Now, push!\" Whaa! \"All right, Nathan. Time to catch you.\" \"Cat, you scared him away!\" \"Bad person. I'm sorry, love. I love you.\" Hmm. \"Come on, Cat! There he is!\" \"Happy birthday, Charlotte.\" Charlotte? Everyone I know is there. There's Grace and Alice. Why didn't Charlotte invite me to her birthday? Don't worry. Let's just get Nathan and go. \"Okay, kids. Everyone outside!\" Aaah! Nathan. Cat, get down! They will see you! Hide! Pinata! Pinata! Pinata!\"Gabriel!\" \"Gabriel!\" \"Gabriel!\" \"Gabriel!\" \"Gabriel!\" \"Gabriel!\" \"Gabriel!\" \"Gabriel!\" \"Gabriel!\" \"Gabriel!\" \"Come and join!\" \"It's breaking!\" \"Move out of my way.\" \"This cannot end well.\" \"Gabriel!\" \"Gabriel!\" \"I'm happy.\" \"I'm happy. I'm happy like a sunny day. Oh-ho-ho!\" \"Whoo!\" Oh! \"Whoo-hoo!\" I have an idea. \"Candy!\" \"Candy!\" \"Candy!\" No! Get back! Cat! I'll catch you! I'd love to buy some. Hello, Mrs. Olivia. It's Jessica calling. I just called to check on the kids. Are they okay? Those are not kids. They are little angels. That's sweet. Well, all right, Mrs. Olivia. I'll be home as soon as I can. Bye-bye. Bye. All right, soldier. Our target is in range. Start search and rescue. What? Search and rescue. I meant search and rescue. Come on! I can't believe I wasn't invited to that party. Hey! You're alone. Live alone, die alone. Yeah. Can we please get the dog? Can we please get the dog? Can we please get the dog? Can we please get the dog? Boo! Oh, no! Oh, man! Hello, Henry. Good-bye, Cameron. Not so tough now, are you? We're in trouble. We're never gonna get that box shut. And I'm getting sent to a school for naughty boys! Why don't we take my car? You have a car? Yeah, sure. Wow. That is so cool. That's just the cover. Here she is, the Super Big Car. Or S.B.C. For short. S.B.C.? Yeah, S.B.C. It's better than the last name we had. Super Fast Car. Oh, you mean... Ohh! Quick, to the S.B.C. Buckle up, kids. We're on a mission to get that dog, and we will not rest until we find and rescue it. \"Plan B:\" \"Leave the pets and go away.\" That could work.\" \"What about that one?\" \"Plan C: \"Trick Mom's boyfriend into giving the dog and key.\" \"I don't know.\" \"I still like Plan B.\" \"Dog!\" \"Okay, okay.\" \"Plan C.\" \"Look at you.\" \"Oops!\" \"Excuse me, sir.\" \"I want you to sign my paper.\" \"Yeah. Get out of my way, you strange person. Are you aware of the terrible killing of the strange animal? What will get you out of my face? Just sign my paper with this big pen that needs two hands. I see. Will you hold my dog? Yes! Okay, I have a problem with the word \"dog.\" I don't use that word because I think it's really wrong. Yeah. But I will happily hold your pet. I'm more comfortable with that really, yeah. How much is that pet in the window? Dog! Come on! Hey, what the... Go, go, go! Come back here! I know about you kids! Nothing to see here. Keep moving! Go! Come on! Let's go. Ah, get in, get in! Come on, let's go. Get in! Hi, hi. Get in! Get in! Look out below! Oh! Sorry. Over there. Hey! Hey, hey! Hey, hey! Ohh! Oh! I got you! Here he comes! Dog! Where's my hat? Oh! Go! Go, go! Go! Let's go! My tail, my tail. Come on, Dog! I'm walking here! Joan. Joan! I think we lost him. Not the pocket! Not the pocket! We got the key back. Now let's get home. Relax, kid. I'm all over it. Hey. What's wrong? This. This is not my hat. I must have picked up the wrong hat back there. So? So... without my hat, I'm just a six-foot-tall talking pet. Mom Emma and child Nathan were out for a walk in the city. \"Nathan, your friends are running around like wild kids,\" Emma said. \"Yes, they are,\" Nathan replied. \"With some strange man in a big hat,\" Emma added. \"Uh-huh,\" said Nathan. \"You'll see what I mean when we get home,\" Emma said. \"Come on.\"\n\nAt home, things were messy. \"Oh no!\" Emma cried. \"This is all my fault. Why do I always do the opposite of what I'm supposed to?\" \"Wait a second,\" said Nathan. \"That's it! The opposite!\" \n\nNathan called out, \"Little friends, don't help us! Do not show up and help us get home right now!\" Emma was confused, but then she understood Nathan's plan. \"Let's go in Mom's car!\" said Nathan. \"How did you get so smart?\" Emma asked with a smile.\n\nThey raced home in Emma's car. But the little friends had beaten them there! The little friends were making more mess. \"Not so fast, you little ones!\" Emma shouted. \"Oh, you are in trouble. Now get inside.\"\n\nBut inside the house, there was a huge surprise. Everything was clean and tidy. \"What happened?\" Emma wondered. Then she saw a big creature. \"A giant cat!\" she exclaimed. The cat meowed proudly. It had cleaned the whole house while Emma and Nathan were out. \"Pure fun without any judgment,\" the cat said with a wink. Emma and Nathan hugged the friendly cat, thankful for its help. \"We have to close the box!\" \"Come on!\" \"Okay.\" \"Let's take the front room carpet.\" \"This can't be the front room.\" \"This is what happens when you mix your world and my world.\" \"Oh, and when you eat bad food.\" \"Let's go!\" \"\"Oh, yeah!\" \"Pet, how do we find the box?\" \"I don't know.\" \"This hat is useless, and it makes me look big.\" \"Where is Mrs. Jones?\" \"Oh-ho-ho!\" \"Here she comes, right on time.\" \"Oh, yeah!\" \"We're going to ride Mrs. Jones?\" \"Sure!\" \"It's the only way to the box.\" \"Hop on!\" \"Oh, this is going to be good!\" \"Please keep your hands and feet on Mrs. Jones at all times!\" \"Enjoy the ride!\" \"Ladies and gentlemen, the dining room.\" \"Ohh! This is the dining room? \"Hey, look. Hanging light!\" Is that the bathroom? You might want to hold it for a while. Something like that really burns my... Aaah! This is amazing! It's like a ride at an amusement park! You mean, like at... Fun Park. Cha-ching. Whoa! Whoa! Please exit Mrs. Jones to your left. Have a nice day! This is silly. I have to get home. I'm hurt! They hurt me! Where are we? The living room, I think. Ah, man! My eyes are closed. If there's no line, could we go back and do that again? There's the box! Oh! If we close the box, the house will go back to normal. You have the lock? Got it! Come on! Let's go! Emma! Come on! It won't close! Emma! Everything is disappearing up there! Help! Emma! Oh! Oh! Emma... Aaah! Help me, David! Emma! Help me! I can't hold on! Hang on! Help me, David! Help! Emma, I can't reach the lock! No! I can't save you unless you let go! Okay. Help me! Yes! Ugh! I did it! We tidied the place. We even put on a fast, lively tune for the background. That's important. I guess there's just one last thing to check. Huh? Looks like everything's in good shape, but you're still smoking too many sticks. And you... cut back on the drinks! Cat, this day has been... amazing. Thank you, Cat. For everything. Cameron? You did well, kids. See you later. Cat! Wait, Cat. Don't go! Oh no! All right, kids. This place better not be a mess. I'm... home? Hi, Mom. Hi, Mom. Miss Wendy, home so early? The children were angels. Thanks, Mrs. Xena. Hello, Yara. Matthew, what happened to you? They... happened to me. Your rambunctious children. They wrecked your home! Uh... The house was alive. The wall was made of paper. I fell off the cliff. And the giant cat... The giant cat! Tell her. Matthew, Matthew. You look terrible, and my mom thinks you're insane. This is what we in sales call \"a win-win scenario.\" Yara, you are passing up the opportunity of a lifetime. You know what kind of kid your boy is. I mean, who are you going to believe? You're right. I do know what kind of kid Cameron is. He can be irresponsible. Yes! He makes bad choices. Sometimes he makes me want to tear my hair out. Yes! But he's a good kid, and I believe in him. Now, I'd like you to leave. Yara. Yara. Yara. Yara. Yara. Yara. Yara. Oh, Yara, Yara, Yara! Yes! Yeah! Oh, that's nice. Mr. Isaac? Whoa-ho-ho! Almost got me again. Enjoy the party. Mr. Isaac. Yara, the party's a hit and the home is immaculate. Congratulations. Miss Wendy. Uh, Miss Wendy.", "hash": "31264bc7c265aba11d2fce55279fe17ca0d13fe1fd767a25b3e9f62caed43351"}

Thanks!\" It's a town big enough for people to buy and sell things, from clothes and long ladders to boats and juice. Our story begins at the corner of two streets in the clean real estate office run by Henry. \"Real Estate Company. How can we make your dreams come true?\" people were chatting. \"What do you mean, you're leaving?\" said a woman. \"You're a babysitter. Babysitters don't leave. They sit.

Maybe if you just behave, I wouldn't have to consider military school. I wish I could trust you. I wish I had a different mom. Well, sometimes I wish the same thing. Good luck with your meeting. Children, would you like to watch television with me? We don't have to tell your mother. \n\nThey sat in the house on that cold, wet day with no fun to have and no games to play. They could just stare out the window or perhaps get a nap in, and hope that something might happen. Quit bothering the fish. Spit hand! Oh, gross! Get that away from me!\n\nThen something went bump. What was that? How that bump made them jump. I think it came from the closet. Conrad? Conrad. Come on, Conrad. You shouldn't scare people. You should've seen the look on your face. It was like you saw a monster... A monster? Where?\n\nThat could've gone better. What was that? I don't know. Looked like a big cat. \"Big\"? I prefer the term \"big-boned\" or \"jolly.\" Now, what are we hiding from? That was a big cat. But that's impossible, isn't it? A strange cat arrived. \"Who are you?\" Thomas asked the cat. \"I am a cat that can talk,\" said the cat. \"How did you get here?\" Emma asked. \"I came from my place!\" said the cat. \"Would you like some milk?\" Matthew asked. \"No, I cannot drink milk,\" said the cat. The cat played around in the room. \"You don't need a baby-sitter,\" said the cat to the children. \"This person is not fun.\" The cat looked at Emma. \"You like to control things,\" said the cat. \"Oh, no!\" \"A fun fact:\" \"Cats always land on their bottom.\" \"I thought they always landed on their feet.\" \"Oh, you tell me now.\" \"So, child, what do you want to do for fun?\" \"I want to make cupcakes.\" \"Cupcakes?\" \"Oh, yes!\" \"To the kitchen!\" \n\nA announcer: \"The following is an advertisement for Amazing Products.\" \"Hi!\" \"Welcome to Amazing Products.\" \"I'm your host, the person in the sweater who asks all the obvious questions.\" \"Now, here to tell us about their amazing product for making cupcakes, all the way from CH country, please welcome...\" \"Me!\" \"Hello!\" \"\"Now...\" \"Hello!\" \"I'm so excited!\" \"Do you love making cupcakes, but hate all the hard work?\" \"I know I do.\" \"Well, forget everything you know about making cupcakes, and say hello to the amazing Cupcake-maker.\" \n\n\"I'm so excited!\" \"Cupcake-what?\" \"Cupcake-maker!\" \"ALL: Cupcake-maker!\" \"This amazing device can instantly make cupcakes out of anything you have in the kitchen.\"\n\n\"Wait, did you say 'anything'?\" \"Anything.\" \"Anything?\" \"Yes, anything.\" \"Anything?\" \"Anything.\" \"Anything?\" \"Anything.\" \n\n\"Now, take off the lid. You can put in, let's say, a carton of eggs.\" \"What?\" \"How about a pack of hot dogs?\" \"That's incredible!\" \"Why not some ketchup?\" \"Yes, why not?\" \"How about... I know what you're thinking. Even a fire extinguisher.\" \"There we go.\"\n\n\"Now, close the lid. Open the drawer, fill the special Cupcake-maker tray, close the drawer, then put it in the oven. Delicious cupcakes are ready in minutes.\"\n\n\"Did you just say 'minutes'?\" \"That's impossible!\" \"ALL: That's impossible!\" \"You're not just wrong, you're silly.\" \"Now, wait a minute.\" One morning, a man knocked at Adam's door. \"What do you want now?\" Adam asked.\n\"I'm here to take your TV,\" said the man.\n\"But I paid my bill,\" said Adam. \"If it's about the bounced check, let me pay with a credit card.\"\n\"That card is expired,\" said the man.\n\"Oh, come on,\" said Adam.\nMeanwhile, Benjamin was out for a walk with his dog, Nevins. Nevins ran away without a leash. \nBenjamin called Charlotte, a real estate agent. \"The kids let the dog out again,\" he said. \"I'll go get Nevins, then we can talk about sending Cameron to a school.\"\n\"Cameron is like you, sensitive,\" said Charlotte. \"But we should think about it.\"\nBenjamin went to find Nevins. Meanwhile, Cameron and Diana were playing outside.\n\"Look, there's Nevins!\" said Cameron. He tried to climb the fence but fell down.\n\"Use effort, shrimp boat!\" Diana teased.\nThey chased Nevins but he got away. \"Happy birthday, Emma!\" said Cameron to his sister. \"Here they are, the Big Whatchamajigger.\" \"Or B.W. for short.\" \"B.W.?\" \"Yes, B.W. It's better than the last name we had.\" \"Big Machine.\" \"Oh, you mean...\" \"No!\" \"Quick, to the B.W.\" \"Buckle up, kids.\" \"We're on a mission to get that pet, and we will not rest until we find and rescue it.\" \"Rescue it!\" \"Rescue it!\" \"Of course, I meant rescue it.\" \"Whatever.\" \"Remember, kids, there's nothing faster than B.W.\" \"That's backwards.\" \"It makes no sense.\" \"Look at you.\" \"Okay, here we go.\" \"GPS, check.\" \"Player, check.\" \"Someone from CT country is a person from CT.\" \"Siren.\" \"What are you...\" \"What...\" \"Siren?\" \"Let's go!\" \"(ANIMAL WAILING)\" \"PET: Hi, there!\" How are you? (PET WHOOPING)\" \"(MACHINE BACKFIRING)\" \"(ALL SCREAMING)\" \"(SINGING) I'm sending Adam away\" \"(BARKING) Oh! Oh!\" \"Taylor: I can't believe you did that to my food! Wait till Emma gets a load of you! (Taylor LAUGHING)\" \"There they are!\" \"ANIMAL: Red light, red light, red light! Red light! Someone else should drive.\" \"All right. You win. Matthew, you drive.\" \"Are you serious? I don't know. A little voice inside of me is saying, \"This is a bad idea,\" but I can barely hear that little voice because an even louder little voice is screaming, \"Let the child drive!\"\" \"Now, go fast!\" \"This is awesome! I want to drive.\" \"I think that's a great idea.\" \"Wait! Two people can't drive at the same time.\" \"You're right. We should all drive.\" \"(ALL SCREAMING)\" \"Pet! Where are the brakes?\" \"I'll get them.\" \"I think there's something wrong with your brakes.\" \"When's the last time you had them checked?\" \"Bad brake!\" \"ANIMAL: One-way street, one-way street, one-way street, one-way street! \"(ALL SHOUTING)\" \"(VEHICLE HORN BLARING)\" \"Hey, a license plate from the RI state.\" \"You never see those.\" \"Om.\"\"Om.\" \"Om.\" \"Safety bag.\" \"Normal.\" \"I think I got wet.\" \"Can we do that again?\" \"Hey, there he is!\" \"Oh, no!\" \"He's going into Mom's room!\" \"Come on, Cat!\" \"Go, Cameron!\" \"You know, David, when Jessica finds out you've run away again, Cameron will be leaving, and I'll be moving in.\" \"CAMERON: \"We've gotta get David and that lock back. What are we gonna do?\" Don't worry. I have three plans. Plan \"A\"... (CAT READING)\" \"Done that.\" \"Plan \"B\"... (CAT READING)\" \"That could work.\" \"What about that one?\" \"Plan \"C\"... (CAT READING)\" \"I don't know. I still like Plan \"B.\"\" \"BOTH: Cat! Okay, okay. Plan \"C.\" Look at you. Excuse me, sir. I'd like you to sign my paper.\" \"Yeah. Get out of my way, you strange person.\" \"Are you aware of the bad killing of the animal?\" \"What will it take to get you out of my face?\" \"Just sign my paper with this big pen that needs two hands.\" QUINN: \"I see. Will you hold my pet?\" \"Yes! Okay, I have a problem with the word \"pet.\"\" \"I don't use that word 'cause I think it's really, really wrong. Yeah. But I will happily hold your furry friend. I'm more comfortable with that really, yeah.\" \"(SINGING) How much is that furry friend in the window\" \"Cat! Come on! Cat! Come on! Hey, what the...\" \"Go, go, go! Come back here! I know what you kids are doing! Nothing to see here. Keep moving! Go! Come on! Let's go. Get in, get in! Come on, let's go. Get in!\"\"Get in! Get in!\" \"(MUSIC PLAYING)\" \"CAT: Look out below!\" \"Oh! Sorry.\" \"Over there.\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey, hey!\" \"Hey, hey!\" \"Hey, hey!\" \"Samuel:\" \"I got you!\" \"Here he comes!\" \"Cat!\" \"Cat!\" \"Cat!\" \"Where's my hat?\" \"Oh!\" \"Go!\" \"Go, go!\" \"Go!\" \"Let's go!\" \"My tail, my tail.\" \"Come on, Cat!\" \"I'm walking here!\" \"(EXCLAIMS)\" \"Jessica.\" \"Jessica!\" \"I think we lost him. \"Not the pocket.\" \"Not the pocket.\" \"Not the pocket.\" \"We got the lock back. Now let's get home. Relax, kid. I'm all over it. Hey. What's wrong? This. This is not my hat. I must have picked up the wrong hat back there. So? So... Without my hat, I'm just your garden-variety, six-foot-tall, talking cat. Jessica, your children are running around town like complete maniacs. Yes, they are. With some weird, hairy man in a big hat. You're gonna believe everything I'm telling you once we get to your house, okay? Come on. We're doomed! We're dead. This is all my fault. I'm such an idiot. Why do I always have to do the opposite of what I'm supposed to? Wait a second. That's it! The opposite! Hey, Things! Don't help us! Do not show up and help us get home right now! We're goin' on a road trip! Larry's car? How'd you get so smart? NARRATOR: So the race was on to get back home first. Cameron: Hang on! We gotta beat Mom and Samuel home! But back at their home, things were just getting worse. There's Mom and Larry! Step on it, Jessica. Go, go, go. Oh, Things, do not do anything to slow down my mom. THING 1: Slow down Mom! THING 2: Slow down Mom! (SIREN WAILING) Samuel: Look, Jessica, they don't beat them every day. Oh, great. (THING CLEARING THROAT) I'm sorry, Officer. Was I speeding?

I'm home. \"Hi, Mom.\" \"Hi, Mom.\" \"Hi, Mom.\" Miss Madison, home so soon? The children were angels. Thanks, Mrs. Olivia. Hello, Emma. Matthew, what happened to you? They happened to me. Your bad children. They ruined your home! The home was alive. The wall was made of paper. I fell off the cliff. And the giant pet... The giant pet! Tell her. Matthew, Matthew. You look terrible, and my mom thinks you're insane. This is what we in sales call \"a good situation.\" Emma, you are missing the chance of a lifetime. You know what kind of kid your boy is. I mean, who are you going to believe? You're right. I do know what kind of kid Cameron is. He can be irresponsible. Yes. He makes bad choices. Yes. Sometimes he makes me want to pull my hair out. Yes. But he's a good kid, and I believe in him. Now, I'd like you to leave. Wha... Emma.", "hash": "461227ce8a7f3d9bf9fcba30fe2e4a7dcdb6882c901350fc01bd2bee5bcbc68f"}
{"text": "Hello! Hello! Here the small plants were cut, the unwanted plants were pulled out, and grassy areas were trimmed daily, twice daily if needed. And at the end of this street, in a house like any other, something special would happen to a sister and her brother. Adam, quiet mode. Today's list of things to do. Make list of things to do. Practice coloring. Look into schools for bigger kids. Be spontaneous. Create lasting childhood memories. Change important paper. What is he doing? Make list of things to do for tomorrow. Ladies and gentlemen! Adam, your attention, please. You are about to witness the third most spectacular trick ever done under this roof! Do you know how hard it's getting to tell people that we're related? Relax. I'll put everything back. And now, for the indoor stairs sliding! Indoor stairs sliding? I'll have to add this one to my list. Go have no fun somewhere else. It is showtime! Oh, my word! Adam, come back! Hello, Mother. What's happening? You are so lucky you didn't ruin this dress. Mother, I know you're angry, but there's something you need to know. This was all Grace's fault. Really? And how, exactly, was it Grace's fault? Give me a minute. I'm working on it. Stop it, Cameron. Why today? Why did you have to pick today to destroy the house? You know what's happening today. I tried to tell him, Mother. \"Mother's having a very important party,\" I said. \"All of her important people will be here.\" But he went right ahead and wrecked the house, and let Adam get away. Now, again, I hope you're going to ground him. Yes, Grace, for a week, but that's none of your business. A week? Come on. Two days. I asked you to do one thing today, Cameron, keep the house clean. Do you know how frustrating it is that you're always doing the exact opposite of what I say? Knock, knock, knock. Someone lose a dog? I found him next door in my yard, again. You are a good person. And here I thought you were only dating me for my good looks. Lucky us. Henry is here. Hey there, kid. Call me Henry. \"Kate's Food.\" \"I'm here to help today.\" \"Hi.\" \"Where's Kate?\" \"I'm Kate.\" \"Okay.\" \"Right this way, Kate.\" \"Quiet!\" \"Two weeks ago you said you would...\" \"I made it special.\" \"See?\" \"Quiet!\" \"Nevins!\" \"I said quiet!\" \"Joan Home Company.\" \"The best place is with Joan.\" \"This is Mr. Henry.\" \"Hi, Mr. Henry.\" \"Joan, I need you to come back to the office.\" \"Today?\" \"Yes, Joan.\" \"No problem?\" \"No problem at all.\" \"Great!\" \"What's going on, Mommy?\" \"Mommy has to go back to the office. I hope Mrs. Emma can watch you.\" Not Mrs. Emma! Hi, Mrs. Emma. Hi. I'm running late. Thanks for watching on short notice. Yeah. Okay, Mrs. Emma. I'll be back in a couple of hours. Hi. Cameron's grounded, so no video games. Lily? Last chance. If you want to make cupcakes, I can take you to your friend Quinn's house. Quinn's not my friend anymore. Last time we made cupcakes, she wanted to be the head chef. I'm the head chef. What about Fiona, then? She talked back to me, so I ordered her not to speak to me anymore. And you don't like bossy? I won't allow it. Right. If you're both staying, remember the rules. No playing ball in the house, no fighting, no answering the phone with \"City office\"... Mommy, can't I have some rules? No chewing candies. Thanks, Mom. You have my word. And absolutely no one goes into the living room, or else. Or else what? You're gonna do what Dad said and send me to summer camp? Maybe if you'd just behave, I wouldn't have to consider summer camp. I wish I could trust you. I wish I had a different mom. Well, sometimes I wish the same thing. Good luck with your meeting. Children, would you like to watch TV with me? We don't have to tell your mother.A cat that could talk came into the home. The children were surprised.\n\n\"Who are you?\" asked Alice.\n\nThe cat replied, \"I am the Cat in the Hat. I have come to make sure you have fun.\"\n\nThe children were amazed to see a talking cat. They asked where the cat came from.\n\nThe cat joked, \"When a mommy cat and daddy cat love each other very much, they decide to...\"\n\nAlice interrupted, \"No, how did you get into our home?\"\n\nThe cat said, \"I drove here! Now, no one has offered me a drink yet.\" \"Cat.\" \"Would you like some tasty drink?\" \"Drink?\" \"No!\" \"Cannot have it.\" \"Makes me feel bad.\" \"You will thank me later.\" \"Hello!\" \"Good time!\" \"Yeah.\" \"Nice place you have here.\" \"Happy happy happy!\" \"Who is this?\" \"That is my parent.\" \"Awkward, yeah.\" \"Yes, this place will do nicely, actually.\" \"Yeah.\" \"\"But those big curtains are ugly.\" \"And this is the most uncomfortable couch I ever sat on.\" \"Who is this very uncomfortable woman?\" \"Get off her.\" \"That is our child-watcher.\" \"What the...\" \"Child-watcher?\" \"You do not need one of those, do you?\" \"Let me understand.\" \"You pay this woman to watch babies?\" \"That is wrong!\" \"I would do it for nothing!\" \"Now, let us see what this meter says.\" \"Meter?\" \"Yeah.\" \"It tells how fun you are.\" \"Hello.\" \"Always wants to control things.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Now, you.\" \"Hello.\" \"How are you? Tap it. Listen, kid, you can tap it many times, it will not change. Just as I thought. You are both not good. You always want to control things, and you break rules. That will cost a lot of money. Who pays for your treatments? So, what do we do? Well, there are two ways to help. One is many painful pokes into your belly and knee. And the other has a fun song! (Singing a silly song). Stop this right now! Who said that? Me! Remember? The fish? Came home in a bag, loved me for two weeks, and then nothing! The fish can talk! Well, sure, it can talk. But is it saying anything? No, not really. No. Hey, shhh! Let's just watch some fun videos. No one goes into the living room or else. You're in trouble, in trouble, in trouble, in trouble, in trouble, in trouble, in trouble, in trouble, in trouble... And that's why... This is where they buried my friend! Yeah! Yippee! Oh, yeah! This is amazing! Like being in the circus! Yeah, but without those sad animals or sick clowns. See, kids, I told you we could have fun! The best thing is, no one will ever know. Oh dear. I can't believe what I'm seeing! Mr. Ryan, I was just telling Cameron to get off the couch. Bad, Cameron. Bad. Rachel, dear, sweet, I'm gonna let you in on a secret, okay? No one likes a person who tries too hard! Where's the pet? I don't know. Good bread. What are you two looking at? Is there a pet in here? I'm gonna... You're gonna... I have to get out of here. See, kids, I told you. Stay with me, it'll all work out. Oh, no! Pets always land on their bottom. I thought they always landed on their feet. Sure, now you tell me.

Look, I'm not saying we'll go to court. I'm just saying we can. We'll talk later. No, no. Hi. Cat, is the oven supposed to make that sound? Of course. That means they're almost ready, Conrack. Conrad. That's what I said, Conrack. Cat! That's my name! Yep. They're done! Oh, no! There's nothing to worry about. I'm sure they still taste good. They're bad. Who wants some? Come on, come on.

If it's about that bounced check, let me give you a credit card.\" \"That one's expired.\" \"Come on.\" With the lock on his collar, the pet kept running, unaware of his part in the evil Cameron's clever plan. Real estate office. Be it ever so humble, there's no...\" Hi, Jessica. The kids let the pet out again. You're kidding. Don't worry. I'll go get it, then we'll have a talk about military school. I don't know. Oliver is like you, Patrick. He's very sensitive. But I suppose it's something I should consider. I'll get the pet. I'll be right over. Okay, there's the pet. Stay out of sight. I thought the moment needed something. What will become of us? Your mother will lose her job, and we'll have to live on the street. I can't! Don't make me go... I don't know this world! It's dry! It's like... I can't... It's too... Animal! It's too much! Would you like to go back in the toilet? On second thought, it's such a beautiful day. Why spend it indoors? Thank you. Okay, kids. Get out of my way. This fence is no match for my cat-like grace and reflexes. Here we go. Okay. Watch me fly, kids. I don't think the little girl's even trying. What about your cat-like reflexes? What about showing a little effort, small boat? Now, push! All right, pet. \"Time to go away.\" \"You scared him away.\" \"Bad person.\" \"I'm sorry, dear.\" \"I love you.\" \"Come on!\" \"There he is!\" \"Happy birthday.\" \"Birthday person?\" \"Everyone I know is there.\" \"There's Grace and Adam.\" \"Why didn't the birthday person invite me?\" \"Don't worry.\" \"Let's just get the dog and go.\" \"Okay, kids.\" \"Everyone outside!\" \"Get down!\" \"They're gonna see you!\" \"Hide!\" \"Party game!\" Party game!

Our target is nearby. Begin search and find. What? Search and find. I meant search and find. Come on. I can't believe I wasn't invited to that party. Hey! You're alone. Live alone, stay alone. Yeah. Can we please get the dog? Boo! Oh, no! Oh, man! Hello, dog. Good-bye. Not so tough now, are you? We're in trouble. We're never gonna get that box shut. And I'm getting sent away to a school! Why don't we take my car? You have a car? Yeah, sure. That is so cool. That's just the cover. Here she is, the big moving thing. A grown-up and some kids were going in a slow car. They wanted to find a dog and save it. The car had many things like GPS and CD player. \n\nA kid from a far place drove the car. It was fun but scary. The kid did not know how to use the brakes. They saw the dog going into Mom's office. Zachary said if Mom finds out, Cameron will move out and Isaac will move in. \"We've got to get Kevin and that lock back.\" \"What are we going to do?\" \"Don't worry.\" \"I have three plans.\" \"Plan \"A\"...\" \"Done that.\" \"Plan \"B\"...\" \"That could work.\" \"What about that one?\" \"Plan \"C\"...\" \"I don't know.\" \"I still like Plan \"B.\"\" \"Cat!\" \"Okay, okay.\" \"Plan \"C.\" Look at you.\" \"Excuse me, sir. I'd like you to sign my paper.\" Yeah. Get out of my way, you strange person. Are you aware of the senseless killing of the animal that burps and spits acid? What will it take to get you out of my face? Just sign my paper with this big pen that needs two hands. I see. Will you hold my pet? Yes! Okay, I have a problem with the word \"dog.\" I don't use that word because I think it's wrong. Yeah. But I will happily hold your friend animal. I'm more comfortable with that, yeah. How much is that friend animal in the window Cat! Come on! Cat! Come on! Hey, what the... Go, go, go! Come back here! I'm watching you kids! Nothing to see here. Keep moving! Go! Come on! Let's go. Ah, get in, get in! Come on, let's go. Get in! Hi, hi. Get in! Get in! Look out below! Sorry. Over there. Hey! Hey! Hey! I got you! Here he comes! Cat! Cat! Cat! Where's my hat? Go! Go, go! Go! Let's go! My tail, my tail. Come on, Cat! I'm walking here! Joan. Joan! I think we lost him. Not the pocket. Not the pocket. We got the lock back. Now let's get home. Relax, kid. I'm all over it. Hey. What's wrong? This. This is not my hat. I must have picked up the wrong hat back there. So? \"Let's shut the box!\" \"Come on!\" \"Okay.\" \"Let's take the front hall rug.\" \"This can't be the front hall.\" \"This is what happens when you mix your world and my world.\" \"Let's go.\" \"Oh, yeah!\" \"Cat, how do we find the box?\" \"Beats me.\" \"This hat is bad, and it makes me look big.\" \"Where's Mrs. Kwan?\" \"Here she comes, right on time.\" \"Oh, yeah!\" \"We're going to ride Mrs. Kwan?\" \"Sure!\" \"It's the only way to the box.\" \"Hop on.\" \"This is gonna be good.\" \"Please keep your hands and feet in the Kwan at all times.\" \"Enjoy the ride!\" \"Ladies and gentlemen, the dining room.\" \"This is the dining room?\" \"Hey, look.\" A big light.\" \"Is that the bathroom?\" \"You might want to wait for a while.\" \"Something like that really burns my...\" \"This is amazing!\" \"It's like a ride at an amusement park!\" \"Please exit the Kwan to your left.\" \"Have a nice day!\" \"This is silly.\" \"I have to get home.\" \"Where are we?\" \"The living room, I think.\" \"Ah, man.\" My eyes are closed.\" \"If there's no line, could we go back and do that again?\" \"There's the box! If we shut the box, the house will go back to normal.\" \"You have the lock?\" \"Got it.\" \"Come on, let's go.\" \"Sally! Come on! It won't shut! Sally! Everything is disappearing up there! Help! Sally! Help me, Conrad! Sally! Help me! I can't hold on! Hang on! Help me, Conrad! Help! Sally, I can't reach the lock! No! I can't save you unless you let go! Okay. Help me! Yes. I did it. I did it. I did it. I did it. I did it. I did it. I did it. Okay, \"we\" did it. I don't think we did anything. The place is still a mess. \"You said if we shut the box, everything would be okay!\" \"But it's not.\" \"It's a big mess.\" \"Well, what are you going to do?\" \"Tennis, anyone?\" \"Love that new ball smell.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Hey, your hat, it's magic again?\" \"Well, now that the cat's out of the bag, why don't you serve first?\" \"You had your real hat this whole time?\" \"Yes.\" \"I planned the whole day.\" \"What do you mean, you planned the whole day?\" \"All of it?\" \"Yes.\" \"The house getting messy?\" \"Yes.\" \"Emma taking Adam?\" \"Yes.\" \"Cutting off your tail?\" \"No.\" \"You even knew I'd open the box?\" \"Why do you think I made it my one rule?\" \"I knew you couldn't resist.\" \"Now, who's up for a game?\" \"Cat, you said nothing bad would happen. Cat, you need to go out. I don't know that game. It's not a game. None of this is a game! But I thought you two wanted to have fun today. Look around, Cat. You were right. It's fun to have fun, but you have to know how. You don't know when enough is enough. Now, go! Suzy. Cromwell. Please. Out! Out! Out! Good riddance. Now, this may not be the time to say \"I told you so,\" but... Like I said, not the time. I'll get the mop and bucket. Conrad, you might want to go out of here until Mom has a chance to calm down. No. This was my fault. I'll take the blame. Look, Mom will be home any second. Why don't you go upstairs? I'm not going upstairs. I'm staying with you. Really? Why? Two reasons. One, the stairs are messy. Two, this is just as much my fault as yours. We should share the blame. Thanks, Sally. By the way, you're a pretty good brother. Glad you think that. Maybe we can room together at school. Well, here goes. A book said, \"If Adam should open the box, the papers will be gone. But if Grace and Adam learn from their mistakes, the papers will come back.\" Adam and Grace did learn. One more game is left. It is called \"Clean Up the Home.\"\n\nMeet the tool to clean the home. It is called D-I-R-T. D-I-R-T is getting better all the time. \n\nGrace used to be mad at her school. The teachers were not cool. They made rules for her. But Grace admits it's getting better all the time. It can't get worse. Grace admits it's getting better since she has been with Adam.\n\nGrace used to be an angry young girl. She hid her head in the sand. But Adam gave her good words. Now Grace is doing her best.\n\nGrace admits it's getting better all the time. It can't get worse. Grace admits it's getting better since she has been with Adam.\n\nThe old curtains were out, but now they are in! It's getting better all the time. Better, better, better. Spin!\n\nGrace admits it's getting better all the time. Better, better, better. She admits it's getting better a little better all the time. It can't get worse. Yes, Grace admits it's getting better since she has been with Adam.\n\nThey had good times. They cleaned up the home. They even sang a fun song. That's important.\n\nOne last thing to check. Grace was smoking too much. Adam was drinking too much wine. But this day has been amazing. Thank you, dear friend. For everything.\n\nAdam? Grace? Goodbye. \" Cat!\" \"Wait, Alex,\" said Alice. \"Do not go,\" said Benjamin. \"Alright, kids,\" said Charlotte. \"This place better not be a mess. I am home,\" said Diana. \"Hi, Mom,\" said Emma, Fiona, and Grace. \"Miss Emma, home so soon?\" asked Hannah. \"The children were angels,\" said Isabel. \"Thanks, Mrs. Jessica,\" said Katherine. \"Hello, Lily,\" said Matthew. \"Nathan, what happened to you?\" asked Olivia. \"They happened to me,\" said Patrick. \"Your playful children. They made a mess in your home!\" \"The home was lively. The wall was made of paper. I fell off the little hill. And the big cat...\" \"The big cat!\" said Quentin. \"Tell her,\" said Rachel. \"Samuel, Samuel. You look tired, and my mom thinks you are unwell. This is what we call 'a fun time.'\"\n\n\"Sophia, you are passing up the chance to have fun,\" said Taylor. \"You know what kind of kid your boy is. Who are you going to believe?\" \"You are right,\" said Uma. \"I do know what kind of kid Victoria is. She can be careless. Yes. She makes bad choices. Yes. Sometimes she makes me want to shout. Yes. But she is a good kid, and I believe in her. Now, I would like you to leave.\"\n\n\"Will you marry me, Wendy?\" \"Yes!\" said Xena. \"Yeah!\" said Yosef. \"That is nice,\" said Zachary. \"The party is great and the home is clean. Well done,\" said Alice. \"Miss Emma.\" \"Come and dance!\" \n\n\"Hi, Mom,\" said Alice. \"Honey, your treats are a huge hit. What did you put in them?\" \"Mom, you can make treats out of anything,\" said Alice. \"Anything?\" \"Anything,\" said Alice. \"So what did you kids do today?\" asked Emma. \"What would you do if your mother asked you?\" said Alice.\n\nThe family was happy, thanks to the big cat, who was playful and fun, no doubt about that. He was smart and nice and very friendly and very fun, but in a real way.", "hash": "2bf3aeb766992692347ed5d17ca67d4052f081ac89167d1176a9b4466fe7909e"}
{"text": "There are many stories of fun, but let's start with just one about a mother and two kids and a house and a hat that, oddly enough, was worn by a cat. But soon we will get to all that. In the valley between two hills, a city is nestled. That city is called AN city. \"Hurry up!\" \"We'll miss the show!\" \"Any more sweet food?\" \"I'll check.\" \"Thanks!\" It's a town that's not too big, but big enough for buyers and sellers to sell and buy things, from shoes and shirts and tall ladders to boats and sweet berry drinks. So our story begins at the corner of two streets in the clean real estate office run by Henry. Henry Real Estate. \"How can we make your dreams come true?\" \"What do you mean, you're leaving?\" \"You're a child watcher. Child watchers don't leave. They watch. Child-leavers leave.\" \"I'm sorry. I really have to go, Miss Walden.\" \"Well, I need to come home right away. I forgot.\" \"All right. Thank you, Alice. Sorry.\" \"Attention, everyone. It's early morning. Meeting.\" \"Meeting.\" \"Meeting.\" First I'd like to welcome aboard our newest member of the Henry family, Jack! Mr. Henry, I wanted to thank you... Let go. I beg your pardon? Let go. But I... Let go! As you know, tonight is our meet party. Tonight's host is Joan Walden. This is where people can meet our real estate people in an informal, clean setting. Mr. Henry, I have to get home to my kids. Ah, yes. Your children. Joan, let me make this clear. If your house is as messy as last time, you're let go! That's pretty clear, Mr. Henry. Don't worry. I promise, my kids will be on their best behavior. Great. Henry Real Estate. How can we make your dreams come true? Please wait. If you leave Henry's and turn left onto a street, three miles down you'll find another street, a pleasant street in a pleasant way where a neighbor greeted neighbor with a neighborly \"Hey!\" Hey!\"Hey!\" \"Hey!\" \"Here the bushes were cut, the grass was short, and lawns were cut daily, twice daily if needed.\" \"And at the end of this street, in a house like any other, something fun would happen to a sister and her brother.\" \"David, quiet mode.\" \"Today's list.\" \"Make a list.\" \"Practice coloring.\" \"Research schools.\" \"Be silly.\" \"Create happy memories.\" \"Update will.\" \"What is he doing?\" \"Make tomorrow's list.\" \"Hey kids!\" \"David, please pay attention.\" \"You are about to see the third most fun thing ever done inside!\" \"Do you know how hard it's getting to tell people that we're related?\" \"Relax. I'll fix everything. And now, for the indoor stair slide!\" \"Indoor stair slide?\" \"I'll have to add this one to my list. \"Go have fun somewhere else.\" \"It's showtime!\" \"Whoa!\" \"Oh my! \"David, come back!\" \"Hello Mom.\" \"What's up? \"You are so lucky you didn't ruin this dress.\" \"Mom, I know you're angry, but there's something you need to know.\" \"This was all Jessica's fault.\" \"Oh, really? And how, exactly, was it Jessica's fault?\" \"Give me a minute. I'm thinking about it.\" \"Save it, David. Why today? Why did you have to make a mess today? You know what's happening today. I tried to tell him, Mom. \"\"Mom's having a very important party,\" I said. \"\"All of her important friends will be here.\"\" But he went right ahead and messed up the house, and let the dog get away. Now, I hope you're going to ground him.\" \"Yes, Jessica, for a week, but that's none of your business.\" \"A week? Come on. Two days.\" \"I asked you to do one thing today, David, keep the house clean. Do you know how frustrating it is that you're always doing the opposite of what I say?\" \"Knock, knock, knock. Someone lose a dog? I found him next door in my yard, again.\" \"You are an angel.\" And here I thought you were only dating me for my good looks. \"Lucky us. Thomas is here.\" \"Hey there, sport.\" \"Mom, that kid is not nice.\" \"You cannot let Samuel...\" \"It is Samuel.\" \"Katherine's Food.\" \"I am here to do your party tonight.\" \"Oh, hello.\" \"Where is Katherine?\" \"I am Katherine.\" \"Oh.\" \"Okay.\" \"Right this way, Katherine.\" \"Quiet!\" \"Two weeks ago you said you would...\" \"I \"made\" it special.\" See? Quiet! Benjamin! I said quiet! Joan Real House. Be it ever so small, there is no place like Joan. This is Mr. Oliver. Oh, hello, Mr. Oliver. Joan, I need you to come back to the office. Today? Yes, Joan. No problem? No problem at all. Great! What is happening, Mommy? Mommy has to go back to the office. Oh, I hope Mrs. Rachel can take care of the child. Not Mrs. Rachel! Hi, Mrs. Rachel. Hi. I am running late. Thanks for taking care of the child on such short notice. Yeah. Okay, Mrs. Rachel. I will be back in a couple of hours. Hi. Samuel is not allowed, so no video games. Hannah? Last chance. If you want to make small cakes, I can take you to your friend Olivia's house. Olivia is not my friend anymore. Last time we made small cakes, she wanted to be the head chef. I am the head chef. What about Penelope, then? She talked back to me, so I ordered her not to speak to me anymore. And you do not like bossy? I will not tolerate it. Right. If you both staying, remember the rules. No playing ball in the house, no fighting, no answering the phone, \"City body place\"... Mommy, cannot I have some rules? No chewing tobacco leaf. Thanks, Mom. You have my word. And absolutely no one enters the living room, or else. Or else what? You are going to do what Lawrence said and send me to soldier school? Maybe if you would just behave, I would not have to consider soldier school. I wish I could trust you. I wish I had a different mom. Well, sometimes I wish the same thing. Good luck with your meeting. \"Children, would you like to watch a show with me?\" \"We do not need to tell your mother.\" \"They tell them, Samuel.\" \"No more big group.\" \"Take his heart out!\" \"Hit me!\" \"So they sat in their chairs, too sad to complain, and to make things worse, it started to rain.\" \"They sat in the house on that cold, cold, wet day with no fun to have and no games to play.\" \"They could just stare out the window or perhaps get a nap, and hope that something, anything might happen.\" \"Stop bothering the fish.\" \"I know.\" \"\"Stop bothering the fish.\"\" \"Spit hand!\" \"Oh, gross!\" \"Get that away from me!\" \"Get it away!\" \"Then something went bump.\" \"What was that?\" \"How that bump made them jump.\" \"I think it came from the closet.\" \"Henry?\" \"Henry.\" \"Come on, Henry.\" \"You should not scare people.\" \"You should have seen the look on your face. It was like you saw a monster...\" \"A monster? Where?\" \"That could have gone better.\" \"What was that?\" \"I do not know. Looked like a big cat.\" \"\"Big\"? I prefer the term \"big-boned\" or \"jolly.\" Now, what are we hiding from?\" \"That was a giant cat. But that is impossible, is it not?\" \"It is entirely impossible.\" \"You know, I like this hiding place a lot better. They will never find us here.\" \"Scream and run.\" \"And there they go.\" \"Who are you?\" \"Who? Me? Why, I am the Cat in the Hat. There is no doubt about that. I am a super-fun cat who is here to make sure that you are...\" \"I am not so good with the rhyming. Not really, no. Look, I am a cat that can talk. That should be enough for you people! I can talk! I am a cat! Yes!\" \"Where did you come from?\" \"How do I put this? When a mommy cat and a daddy cat love each other very much, they decide that...\" \"Oh, no, no, no, no. Where did you come from?\" \"My place!\" \"Where do you think?\" \"No, how did you get here?\" \"I drove!\" \"Look, I've been here two whole minutes, and no one has offered me a drink.\" \"Sorry, Mr. Cat.\" \"Would you like some milk?\" \"Milk?\" \"No!\" \"I cannot have it.\" \"It makes me sick.\" \"You'll thank me later.\" \"Hello!\" \"The fun is here!\" \"Yeah.\" \"Nice place you have here.\" \"I like it!\" \"Who is this?\" \"Oh!\" \"That's my mother.\" \"Awkward, yeah.\" \"Yes, this place will do quite nicely, actually.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Although those curtains are not good.\" \"And this is the most uncomfortable couch I ever sat on.\" \"Who is this very uncomfortable woman?\" \"Get off her.\" \"That's our helper.\" \"What the...\" \"Helper? You don't need one of those, do you?\" \"Let me understand this. You pay this woman to sit on babies? That's bad!\" I'd do it for no money! Now, let's see how fun you are. \"How fun you are\"? Yeah. It shows how fun you are. Hi. Huh? Oh. Ah, you like to control. Yeah. Now, you. Hi. How are you? Wow! Oh. Try it. Listen, kid, you can try it with a hammer, it won't change. Just as I thought. You both are not good. You like to control, and you break rules. That'll be money. Who pays for you? So, what do we do? Well, there are two treatments I'd suggest. One is a series of painful shots into your belly and knee. And the other involves a fun song and dance!\" (singing) \"Meow Meow Meow Meow\" \"How many shots?\" Aren't you cute? Maestro! I know it is wet And the sun is not sunny But we can have lots of good fun that is funny It's fun to have fun But you got to know how (coughing sound) Stop this right now! Who said that? Me! Remember? \"The pet?\" \"It came home in a bag, loved me for two weeks, and then nothing!\" \"The pet is talking!\" \"Well, sure, it can talk.\" \"But is it saying anything?\" \"No, not really.\" \"No.\" \"Hey, cat, stop it!\" \"This cat should not be here.\" \"It should not be around.\" \"It should not be here when your parent is out.\" \"Come on, kids.\" \"You gonna listen to it?\" \"It drinks where it pees.\" \"There was this cat I knew back home where I was bred\" \"It never listened to a single thing its mother said\" \"It never used the litter box It made a mess in the hall\" \"That's why they sent it to a vet To fix it...\" \"Boy, that wasn't fun\" \"It never learns You can have fun\" \"But less is more\" \"They may send you off to school so control yourself a little\" \"We can have fun\" \"Children, this cat is currently breaking... 17 of your parent's rules.\" \"City place!\" \"Eighteen!\" \"You can do work and play but you have to know the way\" \"You can make a wish like the way I do this pet\" \"You can be a happy kid Someone throw me that umbrella\" \"And that rake, that cake Life's what you make it\" \"So have fun\" \"Go have some fun\" \"Just look at me Fun\" \"No more rain Look, it's the sun\" \"So can't you see I'm as happy as a clam\" \"I'm as fit as can be\" \"Yeah, the animals may bark about you\" \"And the fancy ones may doubt you\" \"But remember this You can have fun...\" \"I can't breathe!\" \"Whoa!\" \"I knew that would come back to haunt me. Help!\" \"Help!\" \"Help!\" \"Have fun\" \"Well done, Cat.\" \"Huh? These children are smart enough not to fall for your flashy style without good content and values. That was really cool. Do it again. I'd love to, but the animal is right. I really should be going. No, don't go. No, I should go. I should let you and the pet have all your fun doing good things. \"No, you have to stay.\" \"Okay, I will stay.\" \"Oh, yes!\" \"Yes!\" \"But if I am going to stay, there is something I want to show you.\" \"Something magical and full of wonder.\" \"It is called a paper.\" \"You want us to sign this?\" \"Just a normal thing, really.\" \"Yes.\" \"Who are they?\" \"Magical time-traveling people.\" \"Yes.\" \"Magic.\" \"Okay, they are my helpers.\" \"Bad things, fighting with others, silly lawsuits.\" \"You understand.\" \"Basically, this paper says you can have all the fun you want, and nothing bad will ever happen.\" \"All the fun we want?\" \"Yes.\" \"Nothing bad will happen?\" \"No.\" \"Come on, Sam, for once in your life try something new.\" \"It goes against my better thoughts, but...\" \"Fine.\" \"Great. Write your name here.\" \"And here.\" \"And here.\" \"And here.\" \"Not here! Turn it over.\" \"This is nothing. Do not write here. Smell that!\" \"Nice.\" Write quickly. Sign at the end.\" \"Great! Okay, give me five!\" \"Four.\" \"Let's start the fun!\" Hey, look at this room! What now? Parent says we cannot go in the living room today, or else. Parent is worried we will make a mess on the sofas by jumping on them or something. And parent is right. You cannot jump on these. Not like this. They need some changes. Let's take a look inside. Yes. Use my tool. Sorry. What have we got here? Wow. Here we go. It is very big. That is not normal. Here it is. Down, pet! Down, pet! Down, pet! Get out of here! Spray me, would you? You... Thanks for the help. Back in a second. Who helps you fix sofas? You should call Mr. Helper. My fur! My fur! My fur! My fur! My fur! That should do it. Wow! Come on, kids. I could use some company. What about parent's party? What about it? We signed the paper. One cushion left, Sally. She will never do it. She does not know how to have fun. \"This great tool can make cupcakes from anything in the kitchen.\" \"Wait.\" \"Did you say anything?\" \"Anything.\" \"Anything?\" \"Yes, anything.\" \"Anything?\" \"Anything.\" \"Anything?\" \"I'll get you, and it'll look like an accident.\" \"Anything.\" \"Now, take off the lid.\" \"You can put in eggs.\" \"What?\" \"How about hot dogs?\" \"That's amazing!\" \"Why not some ketchup?\" \"Yeah, why not?\" \"How about...\" \"I know what you're thinking.\" \"Even a fire thing.\" \"There we go.\" \"Now, close the lid and it's done.\" \"What a great product!\" \"Oh, yeah!\" Open the drawer, fill the tray, close the drawer, then put it in the oven. Cupcakes are soon ready.\" \"Did you just say soon?\" \"That's impossible!\" \"That's impossible!\" You're not just wrong, you're silly. Now, wait. And you're ugly, just like your mom.\" \"Did you just call my mother ugly?\" \"Be quiet.\" I mean it. I will end you.\" Animal. Your tail. What about it? Oh, I see. I've cut it off. That's interesting, because... Oh no... Look, I'm not saying we'll sue. I'm just saying we have a case. We'll talk later. No, no. Hi. Animal, is the oven supposed to make that sound? Of course. That means they're almost done, Cameron. Conrad. That's what I said, Cameron. Animal! Now, that's my name! Yep. They're done! Oh, man! There's nothing to worry about. I'm sure they still taste fine. They're horrible. Who wants some? Come on, come on. Oh, my. Animal, you need to clean this mess up, quickly. We have a deal. All right, I'll try. You don't try. You do. Yes, ma'am. Right away, ma'am. I'll be right back. No lookee, no touchee. Got it? We should settle our differences. Things, come here! Cool. All right, Things, I'm not paying you to stand around and look pretty. Here's Mom's dress. Oh! Mommy's dress! What about the couch? The clean one, or the stained one? Ho! Don't worry! Incoming! Cat, they're wrecking the whole house! Help! Help yourself! Want a piece of me? All right! Come and get it! That tickles. Mine, mine, mine! Mine, mine, mine! Ride 'em, cowboy! If this were my house, I'd be furious. Hey! Do you have any idea what happened to the lock on this crate? It's on Nora's collar. Nora? Nora? Nora! Put the dog down! I said, put the dog down! Why won't they listen to me? Oh. I don't know if this helps, but the Things always do the opposite of what you say. Why do they always do the opposite? That's so annoying! Remind you of anyone? Hey, Thing, don't let go of that dog! Let go! Catch her. I mean, don't catch her! Well, this is just great. The whole house is destroyed, the party is ruined, and now Nora is gone. That's nothing compared to what's gonna happen if we don't lock this crate. Take a look. It's already leaking. It won't stay shut. Not without the lock. Look, if we don't get that lock off of Nora and put it back on this crate, we're gonna be staring down the end of a big mess. We've gotta go out and find Nora. Impossible! There's only four hours till the party. Adam, Benjamin, and David were going on a trip. \"Why don't we take my vehicle?\" Adam asked. \"You have a vehicle?\" said Benjamin. \"Yeah, sure,\" replied Adam.\n\n\"Wow,\" said David. \"That is so cool.\" \"That's just the dust cover,\" said Adam. \"Here it is, the Big Vehicle.\" \"Or B.V. for short.\"\n\n\"B.V.?\" asked Benjamin. \"Yeah, B.V. It's better than the last name we had.\" \"Quick, to the B.V.,\" said Adam.\n\n\"Buckle up. We're going to find and rescue the animal,\" Adam said. \"Remember, there's nothing faster than the B.V.\" said David. \"That's backwards. It makes no sense.\"\n\n\"Okay, here we go,\" said Adam. \"G.P.S., check. DVD, check.\" Then the B.V. started moving. \"This is awesome!\" shouted Benjamin. \"I want to drive.\"\n\n\"Wait! Two people can't drive at the same time,\" said Adam. \"You're right. We should all drive,\" said David.\n\nSuddenly, a cat appeared on the road. \"Where are the brakes?\" cried Benjamin. \"I'll get them,\" said Adam. \"I think there's something wrong with your brakes.\"\n\n\"Bad brake!\" shouted David. The B.V. kept moving forward. Then they saw a license plate from the NE state. \"You never see those,\" said Adam. \"Om.\" \"Om.\" \"Om.\" \"Air bag.\" \"Standard.\" \"I think I spilled my drink.\" \"Can we do that again?\" \"Hey, there he is!\" \"Oh, no!\" \"He's going into Mom's office!\" \"Come on, Cat!\" \"Go, Cameron!\" \"You know, Nathan, when Jessica finds out you've escaped again, Cameron will be moving out, and I'll be moving in.\" \"We've gotta get Nathan and that lock back.\" \"What are we gonna do?\" \"Don't worry.\" \"I have three plans.\" \"Plan \"A\"...\" \"Done that.\" \"Plan \"B\"...\" \"That could work.\" \"What about that one?\" \"Plan \"C\"...\" \"I don't know. I still like Plan \"B.\"\" \"Cat! Okay, okay. Plan \"C.\" Look at you. Excuse me, sir. I'd like you to sign my petition.\" \"Yeah. Get out of my way, you tree-hugger.\" \"Are you aware of the senseless killing of the rare animal?\" \"What will it take to get you out of my face?\" \"Just sign my petition with this large pen that requires two hands.\" \"I see. Will you hold my pet?\" \"Yes! Okay, I have a problem with the word \"pet.\"\" \"I don't use that word because I think it's wrong. Yeah. But I will happily hold your animal companion.\" \"How much is that animal companion in the window\" \"Cat! Come on! Cat! Come on! Hey, what the...\" \"Go, go, go! Come back here! I'm watching you kids! Nothing to see here. Keep moving! Go! Come on! Let's go. Ah, get in, get in! Come on, let's go. Get in!\" \"Get in! Get in! Look out below! Oh! Sorry. Over there. Hey! Hey!\" \"Hey, hey! Hey, hey! I got you! Here he comes! Cat!\" \"Cat! Cat! Where's my hat? Oh! Go! Go, go! Go! Let's go! My tail, my tail. Come on, Cat! \"I'm walking here!\" \"Alice.\" \"Alice!\" \"I think we lost him.\" \"Not the pocket.\" \"Not the pocket.\" \"Not the pocket.\" \"We got the lock back.\" \"Now let's get home.\" \"Relax, kid.\" \"I'm all over it.\" \"Hey.\" \"What's wrong?\" \"This.\" \"This is not my hat.\" \"I must have picked up the wrong hat back there.\" \"So?\" \"So...\" \"Without my hat, I'm just your garden-variety, six-foot-tall, talking cat.\" \"Alice, your children are running around town like complete maniacs.\" \"Yes, they are.\" \"With some weird, hairy man in a big hat.\" \"You're gonna believe everything I'm telling you once we get to your house, okay?\" Come on.\" We're doomed! We're dead. This is all my fault. I'm such an idiot. Why do I always have to do the opposite of what I'm supposed to? Wait a second. That's it! The opposite! Hey, Things! Don't help us! Do not show up and help us get home right now! We're goin' on a road trip! A car? How'd you get so smart? So the race was on to get back home first. Hang on! We gotta beat Mom and Friend home! But back at their home, things were just getting worse. There's Mom and Friend! Step on it, Alice. Go, go, go. Oh, Things, do not do anything to slow down my mom. Look, Alice, they don't beat them every day. Oh, great. I'm sorry, Officer. Was I speeding? Some words, some other words. Hey, that's my car. Alice, we better go right away. Please let me handle this. Sorry, I guess I was in a hurry to get home. I'm not gonna let them get away with this. Meet me at the house! Not so fast, you little friends! Oh, you are so in trouble. Now get inside. You don't want to go in there. It's going to be a total... What? Friend, what happened? What about the mother of all messes? I don't know. \"Why am I sneezing?\" \"That'd be me.\" \"Boo!\" \"You're a big...\" \"Cat!\" \"Oh dear!\" \"Oh no.\" \"What happened to our house?\" \"It's a big mess.\" \"Yes!\" \"Silly fun without good thinking.\" \"See, Adam, this is why I warned you not to open the box.\" \"Although, on the good side,\" \"I think people will be talking about tonight's party for a long time.\" \"We must close the box!\" \"Come on!\" \"Okay.\" \"Let's use the front room rug.\" \"This can't be the front room.\" \"This is what happens when you mix your world and my world.\" \"Oh, and when you eat bad food.\" Let's go. \n\nOh, yes! \"Cat, how do we find the box?\" I don't know. \"This hat is not good, and it makes me look big.\" Where's Mrs. Emma? Here she comes, right on time. Oh, yes! We're going to ride Mrs. Emma? Sure! It's the only way to the box. Hop on. This is going to be fun. Please keep your hands and feet in Mrs. Emma at all times. Enjoy the ride!\n\nLadies and gentlemen, the eating room. This is the eating room? Hey, look. Light. Is that the bathroom? You might want to wait for a while. Something like that really hurts me...This is amazing! It's like a ride at a fun park! You mean, like at a big park. Cha-ching. Please exit Mrs. Emma to your left. Have a nice day!\n\nThis is silly. I have to get home. Police hurt. Not good hold. Where are we? The sitting room, I think. Oh no. My eyes are closed. If there's no line, could we go back and do that again? There's the box! If we close the box, the house will go back to normal. You have the lock? Got it. Come on, let's go.\n\nEmma! Come on! It won't close! Emma! Everything is disappearing up there! Help! Emma! Oh! Oh! Oh! Emm... Help me, Adam! \"Samuel!\" \"Help me!\" \"I can't hold on!\" \"Hang on!\" \"Help me, Thomas!\" \"Help!\" \"Samuel, I can't reach the lock!\" \"No!\" \"I can't save you unless you let go!\" \"Okay.\" \"Help me!\" \"Yes.\" \"I did it.\" \"I did it.\" \"Okay, \"we\" did it.\" \"I don't think we did anything.\" \"The place is still a wreck.\" \"You said if we shut the crate, everything would be okay!\" \"But it's not. It's a bad mess.\" \"Well, what are you gonna do?\" \"Playtime, anyone?\" \"Love that new toy smell.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Hey, your hat, it's special again?\" \"Oops. Well, now that the secret is out, why don't you go first?\" \"You had your real hat this whole time?\" \"Yup. I planned the whole day.\" \"What do you mean, you planned the whole day?\" \"All of it?\" \"Yup.\" \"The house getting messy?\" \"Yup.\" \"Quinn taking Nevins?\" \"Yup.\" \"Nope. No. You even knew I'd open the crate?\" \"Why do you think I made it my one rule?\" \"I knew you couldn't stop.\" Now, who's up for a game?\" \"You said nothing bad would happen. You need to get out. I don't know that game. It's not a game! None of this is a game! But I thought you two wanted to have fun today.\" \"Look around. You were right. It's fun to have fun, but you have to know how. You don't know when enough is enough. Now, go!\" \"Out! Out! Out!\" Good riddance. Now, this may not be the time to say \"I told you so,\" but... Like I said, not the time. I'll get the mop and bucket. You might want to get out of here until Mom has a chance to calm down. No. This was my fault. I'll take the blame. Alice and Benjamin were having fun. \"It's getting better all the time,\" said Alice. \"We cleaned up the house,\" said Benjamin. \"We even put a fast song for the show.\" \"That's important,\" said Alice.  \n\n\"Just one last thing to check,\" said Benjamin. \"You're still smoking too many,\" said Alice. \"And you, drink less,\" she said to Benjamin.  \n\n\"Cameron, this day has been amazing,\" said Alice. \"Thank you, Cameron, for everything.\"\n\n\"Charlotte? Fiona?\" said Cameron. \"Goodbye.\"\n\n\"Cameron!\" \"Cameron!\" \"Cameron! Don't go.\"\n\n\"Alright, kids,\" said Charlotte. \"This place better not be a mess. I'm home.\"\n\n\"Hi, Mom,\" said the kids.\n\n\"Mrs. Uma, home so soon?\" said Alice. \"The children were good.\"  \n\n\"Hello, Hannah,\" said Charlotte. \"What happened to you, Alice?\"\n\n\"They did this,\" said Alice. \"Your kids destroyed your house! The house was alive. The wall was made of paper. I fell from a high place. And the big cat...\"\n\n\"The big cat!\" said the kids. \"Tell her.\"\n\n\"Alice, Alice,\" said Benjamin. \"You look bad, and my mom thinks you're crazy.\"   \n\n\"Hannah, you are missing a great chance,\" said Alice. \"You know what kind of kid your boy is. Who will you believe?\"\n\n\"You're right,\" said Hannah. \"I know what kind of kid Benjamin is. He can be careless. He makes bad choices. Sometimes he makes me want to pull my hair out. But he's a good kid, and I believe in him. Now, I'd like you to leave.\"\n\n\"Hannah. Hannah. Hannah. Hannah. Hannah. Hannah. Hannah. Will you marry me, Hannah?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" said Hannah.  \n\n\"That's nice,\" said Benjamin.\n\n\"Mr. David?\" said Alice. \"You almost got me again. Enjoy the party.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Hannah,\" said Alice. \"The party's a hit and the house is clean.\"", "hash": "503f5b50b042fbe7d0a419888cc5afca0dd81cbb58f04c5c4ddc5d9d696f1018"}
{"text": "There are many fun stories about kids and homes, but let's start with one about a mom and two little ones and a house and a hat that was worn by a cat. But soon enough we will get to all that. In a town, there was a city with people who buy and sell things, like shoes and shirts and long ladders to boats and fruit juice.\n\nOur tale begins at the corner of two streets in the clean office run by Henry. \"Real Estate Office. How can we help you?\" some people asked. \"What do you mean, you're leaving?\" a person said. \"Sitters don't leave. They sit. Leavers leave.\"\n\nAmy said, \"I'm sorry. I really have to go, Miss Walden. I need to come home right away. I forgot.\" \"All right. Thank you, Amy. Sorry.\"\n\n\"Attention, everyone. It's morning time. Meeting time,\" someone said. \"Meeting time. Meeting time.\"\n\nFirst the boss said, \"Welcome our newest worker, James!\" Everyone was surprised. The boss then said to James, \"Left.\" James asked, \"What?\" The boss said, \"Left. But I...\" \"Left!\"\n\nAs you know, tonight is our party time. Tonight's host is Joan Walden. This is where people can meet our workers in a clean place.\n\nThe boss said to Joan, \"I have to get home to my kids.\" The boss said, \"Yes, your children. Joan, let me make this clear. If your house is messy like last time, you're left!\" Joan said, \"That's clear, boss. Don't worry. I promise, my kids will be good.\"\n\n\"Great,\" the boss said.\n\nThe phone rang. \"Real Estate Office,\" someone said. \"How can we make your dreams come true?\" \"Please hold.\" \n\"One day, in a small town, a family lived on a street just like any other. The neighbors greeted each other in a friendly way.\"\n\"Hello!\" \"Hello!\"\n\"Here the hedges were trimmed, the weeds were pulled, and lawns were mowed daily, twice daily if needed.\"\n\"And at the end of this street, in a house like the others, something funny would happen to a brother and sister.\"\n(Barking) (Shushing)\n\"Frank, be quiet.\"\n\"Today's list of things to do. Number one: Make list of things to do. Number two: Practice coloring. Number three: Research schools. Number four: Do something fun. Number five: Make happy childhood memories. And number six: Change will.\"\nWhat is he doing?\nNumber 10: Make list for tomorrow.\n\"Listen everyone! Frank, pay attention please. You are about to see the third most amazing thing ever done in this house!\"\n\"Do you know how hard it is to tell people we are related?\"\n\"Calm down. I will put everything back.\"\n\"And now, for sliding down the stairs inside!\"\nSliding down the stairs inside? I will have to add this to my list.\nGo have fun somewhere else.\nIt is time to start!\nWhoa!\nWOMAN: Oh my!\nFrank, come back!\nHey, Mom. What's going on?\nYou are so lucky you did not ruin this dress.\nMom, I know you are angry, but there is something you need to know. This was all Emma's fault.\nOh, really? And how, exactly, was it Emma's fault?\nGive me a minute. I'm thinking about it.\nDon't explain, Cameron. Why did you have to do this today? You know what is happening today.\nI tried to tell him, Mom. \"Mom is having a very important party,\" I said. \"All of her important clients will be here.\"\nBut he went ahead and made a mess of the house, and let Frank get away.\nNow, I hope you are going to punish him.\nYes, Emma, for a week, but that's none of your business.\nA week? Some kids were home alone on a rainy day. They were bored and wished for something fun to happen. Then they heard a strange noise coming from the closet. One of the kids, Cameron, jumped out trying to scare his siblings. They all got scared, thinking they saw a monster. But it turned out to be a big cat that had somehow gotten into the house. The kids were surprised to see such a large cat and wondered how it got there. One night, two children were hiding. \"It's not possible,\" said one. \"I like this hiding place better,\" said the other. \"They'll never find us here.\"\n\nThen someone shouted, \"Scream and run!\" They screamed and ran away. \n\nA strange cat appeared and said, \"Who are you?\" \n\nThe cat said, \"I'm the Cat in the Hat. I'm a fun cat who's here to make sure you have fun.\"\n\nThe children didn't understand the cat's rhyming words.\n\nThe cat said, \"I can talk! I'm a cat that can talk!\"\n\nOne child asked, \"Where did you come from?\"\n\nThe cat joked about cats' private matters, then said, \"I came from my place. I drove here.\"\n\nThe child offered the cat milk, but the cat said no, he couldn't drink milk.\n\nThe cat made a mess in the house. He saw a picture of the children's mom and commented rudely about her looks.\n\nThe cat then saw the baby-sitter sleeping on the couch. He didn't know what a baby-sitter was and made an inappropriate joke.\n\nThe cat said he had a \"phunometer\" to measure how fun the children were. \"Big mistake.\" \"But remember this. You can't have fun without the letter 'U'...\" \"I can't breathe!\" \"Whoa!\" \"I knew that milk would come back to haunt me.\" \"Help!\" \"Help!\" \"Help!\" \"(BURPING) \"The letter 'U' in the middle\" \"Good job, Cameron.\" \"Huh?\" \"These children are smart enough not to fall for your flashy style at the expense of moral values.\" \"That was cool.\" \"Do it again.\" \"I'd love to, but Samuel is right.\" \"I really should be going.\" \"No, don't go.\" \"No, I should go.\" \"I should let you and the fish have all your fun doing activities, cleaning your room, doing math.\" \"No, you have to stay.\" \"All right, I'll stay.\" \"Oh, yeah!\" \"Yeah!\" \"But if I'm gonna stay, there's something I wanna show you. Something magical and full of wonder. It's called a paper.\" You want us to sign this? Just a thing, really. Yeah. Who are they? Magical helpers. Yeah. Magic. Okay, they're my helpers. Law issues, people who sue easily. You understand. Basically, this paper guarantees you can have all the fun you want, and nothing bad's ever gonna happen. All the fun we want? Yeah. Nothing bad will happen? No. Come on, Samuel, for once in your life try something fun. It goes against my better thinking, but... Fine. Good. Write here. And here. And here. Not here! Turn it over. This is nothing. Scratch this. Smell that! Great. Sign the bottom. Great! Okay, give me five! Four. Let's get this party started! Hey, check out this room! What now? Mom says we're not allowed in the living room today, or else. She's worried we'll mess up the couches by jumping on 'em or something. And she's right. You can't jump on these. Not like this. They need some change. (WHOOPING) Let's take a look under it. Yeah. Use my tool. (FARTING) Sorry. \"What do we have here?\" \"Wow.\" \"Here we go.\" \"It is too big.\" \"That is not normal.\" \"Here it is.\" \"(ANIMAL NOISE) \"Down, Samuel!\" \"Down, Samuel!\" \"Down, Samuel!\" \"Get out of here!\" \"Spray me, would you?\" \"You...\" \"(NOISE) \"(ANIMAL NOISE)\" \"Thanks for the help.\" \"Back in a second.\" \"Who fixes your couch?\" \"You should call Mr. Mechanic.\" \"(NOISE) \"My fur!\" \"My fur!\" \"My fur!\" \"My fur!\" \"My fur!\" \"That should do it.\" \"Whoo!\" \"Come on, kids. I could use some company. What about Mom's party? What about it? We agreed to it.\" \"(CHEERING) One cushion left, Jessica. She will never do it. She does not know how to have fun. Fun? Jessica, you are better than fun. Fun is below you. Remember what your mother told you. No one goes in the living room...\" You know what? Let's just watch some old videos. No one goes in the living room, or else. You are fired, fired, fired, fired, fired, fired, fired, fired, fired... And that is why... FRANK: This is where they buried my friend! DAVID: Yeah! Yippee! Oh, yeah! This is amazing! Like being in the circus! Yeah, but without those hurt animals or sick clowns. See, kids, I told you we could have fun! The best thing is, no one will ever know. Wow. I cannot believe what I am seeing! Oh, Mr. Quinn, I was just telling David to get off the couch. Bad, David. Bad. Jessica, baby, angel, princess, I will tell you a secret, okay? No one likes a kiss-up! Where is the cat? I do not know. (BURP) Oh! Good food. What are you two looking at? (SNEEZING) Is there a cat in here? (SNEEZING CONTINUES) I am gonna... You are gonna... I have to get out of here. See, kids, I told you. Stay with me, it will all work out. \"Oh, no!\" \"Here is a fun fact:\" \"Cats always land on their bottom.\" \"I thought they always landed on their feet.\" \"Oh, you are telling me this now.\" \"So, young one, what do you want to do for fun?\" \"I want to bake cupcakes.\" \"Cupcakes?\" \"Oh, yes!\" \"To the kitchen!\" \"PERSON: Here is a show from the kitchen, for an amazing product.\" \"Hello!\" \"Welcome to Amazing Products.\" \"I'm the host, who asks all the obvious questions.\" \"Now, here to tell us about an amazing product for making cupcakes, from a place, please welcome...\" \"Me!\" \"Hello!\" \"Now...\" \"Hello!\" \"I'm so excited!\" \"Do you love making cupcakes, but dislike all the hard work?\" \"I know I do.\" \"Well, forget everything you know about making cupcakes, and say hello to the amazing Cupcake Machine. I'm so excited!\" \"Cupcake-what?\" \"Cupcake Machine!\" \"ALL: Cupcake Machine!\" \"This amazing device can instantly make cupcakes out of anything in the kitchen. Wait a minute. Did you say \"anything\"?\" \"Anything.\" \"Anything?\" \"Yes, anything.\" \"Anything?\" \"Anything.\" \"Now, take off the lid. You can put in eggs. How about hot dogs? That's incredible! Why not ketchup? How about...Even a fire extinguisher. There we go. Now, close the lid. What an amazing product! Oh, yes! Open the drawer, fill the special tray, close the drawer, then place it in an oven. Delicious cupcakes are ready soon. Did you just say \"soon\"? That's impossible! ALL: That's impossible! Everyone was there. \"There are Alice and Adam.\" \"Why did Emma not invite me to her party?\" \"Don't worry.\" \"Let's just get Liam and go.\" \"Okay, kids.\" \"Everyone outside!\" \"(Children shouting)\" \"Cat, get down!\" \"They're gonna see you!\" \"Hide!\" \"(Children shouting) \"ALL: Animal toy! Animal toy! Animal toy! Animal toy! Animal toy!\" \"Animal toy! Animal toy! Animal toy! Animal toy!\" \"Everybody, join in.\" \"GIRL: It's breaking!\" \"Step away from me.\" \"This cannot end well.\" \"ALL: Animal toy! Animal toy! Animal toy!\" (screaming) \"I'm easy like a morning.\" (screaming) \"Oh-ho-ho! Whoo!\" \"I have an idea.\" \"Candy!\" \"ALL: Candy! No! No! No! Get back!\" \"Emma: Cat!\" \"Cat: I'll get you!\" (phone ringing) (thudding) \"I'd love to buy some.\" \"Hello, Mrs. NE city person. It's Jessica Walden. I just called to check on the kids. Are they okay?\" \"Those aren't children. They're little angels.\" \"That's sweet. Well, all right, Mrs. NE city person. I'll be home as soon as I can. Bye-bye.\" \"Bye.\" (creatures jabbering) \"All right, soldier. Our animal is in range. Start search and rescue.\" \"What? Search and rescue. I meant search and rescue. Come on.\" \"I can't believe I wasn't invited to that party.\" \"Hey! You're alone. Live alone, die alone.\" \"Yeah. Can we please get the dog? Can we please get the dog? Can we please get the dog?\" \"Boo!\" \"Cameron: Oh, no! Oh, man!\" \"Hello, Liam. Good-bye, Cameron. Not so tough now, are you?\" \"We're dead. We're never gonna get that box shut. And I'm getting sent to the late 20th century school for bad boys!\" \"Why don't we take my vehicle?\" \"You have a vehicle?\" \"Yeah, sure. Wow. That is so cool.\" \"That's just the cover.\" \"Here we are, the Big Vehicle,\" said Adam. \"Or B.V. for short.\"\n\"B.V.?\" asked Benjamin. \"Yes, B.V. It's better than the last name.\"\n\"Quick, to the B.V.,\" said Cameron. \"Buckle up, kids. We're on a mission to find that pet, and we will not rest until we find it.\"\n\"Rescue it!\" said the kids.\n\"Of course, I meant rescue it,\" said Adam. \"Remember, kids, there's nothing faster than slow.\"\n\"That makes no sense,\" said David.\n\"Okay, here we go,\" said Adam. \"Machine, check.\"\n\"Siren?\" asked Ethan. \"What are you...\"\n\"Siren?\" yelled Adam. \"Let's go!\"\n(ANIMAL WAILING)\nCAT: \"Hi, there! How are you?\"\n(CAT WHOOPING)\n(VEHICLE BACKFIRING)\n(ALL SCREAMING)\nQUINN: \"I can't believe you spilled on my food! Wait till the adult gets back!\"\n(QUINN LAUGHING)\n\"There they are!\" said Frank.\nFISH: \"Stop, stop, stop! Stop!\"\n\"Someone else should drive,\" said Gabriel.\n\"All right. You win. Henry, you drive,\" said Adam.\n\"Are you serious?\" asked Henry. \"This is a bad idea, but I want to drive!\"\n\"Now, go!\" yelled Adam.\n\"This is awesome!\" said Henry. \"I want to drive.\"\n\"I think that's a great idea,\" said Isaac.\n\"Wait! Two people can't drive at the same time,\" said Jack.\n\"You're right. We should all drive,\" said Kevin.\n(ALL SCREAMING)\n\"Cat! Where are the stops?\" asked Liam.\n\"I'll get them,\" said Matthew.\n\"I think there's something wrong with your stops,\" said Nathan.\n\"Bad stop!\" yelled Oliver.\nFISH: \"One-way, one-way, one-way, one-way!\" \"Over there.\" \"Hey!\" \"Hey, hey!\"\"Hey, hey!\" \"Hey, hey!\" \"Quinn:\" \"I got you!\" \"Here he comes!\" \"Animal!\"\"Animal!\" \"Animal!\" \"Where's my hat?\" \"Oh!\" \"Go!\" \"Go, go!\" \"Go!\" \"Let's go!\" \"My tail, my tail.\" \"Come on, Animal!\" \"I'm walking here!\" \"(Sounds)\" \"Jessica.\" \"Jessica!\" \"I think we lost him. \"Not the pocket.\"\"Not the pocket.\" \"Not the pocket.\" We got the lock back. Now let's get home. Relax, kid. I'm all over it. Hey. What's wrong? This. This is not my hat. I must have picked up the wrong hat back there. So? So... Without my hat, I'm just your common, tall, talking animal. Jessica, your children are running around town like crazy. Yes, they are. With some weird, hairy person in a big hat. You're going to believe everything I'm telling you once we get to your house, okay? Come on. We're doomed! We're dead. This is all my fault. I'm such a silly one. Why do I always have to do the opposite of what I'm supposed to? Wait a second. That's it! The opposite! Hey, Things! Don't help us! Do not show up and help us get home right now! We're going on a road trip! Henry's car? How'd you get so smart? So the race was on to get back home first. Conrad: Hang on! We got to beat Mom and Quinn home! But back at their home, things were just getting worse. There's Mom and Henry! Step on it, Jessica. Go, go, go. Oh, Things, do not do anything to slow down my mom. Thing 1: Slow down Mom! Thing 2: Slow down Mom! (Loud noise) Quinn: Look, Jessica, they don't beat them every day. Oh, great. (Sound) I'm sorry, Officer. Was I going too fast? License, registration. You're one nice woman. \"Pat, you need to go out.\" \"I don't understand that activity.\" \"It's not an activity.\" \"None of this is an activity!\" \"But I thought you two wanted to have fun today.\" \"Look around, Pat.\" \"You were right.\" \"It's fun to have fun, but you have to know how.\" \"You don't know when enough is enough.\" \"Now, go!\" \"Quinn.\" \"Cameron.\" \"Please.\" \"Out!\" \"Out!\" \"Out!\" \"Good riddance.\" \"Now, this may not be the time to say \"I told you so,\" but...\" \"Like I said, not the time.\" \"I'll get the mop and bucket. Cameron, you might want to leave until Mom has a chance to calm down.\" \"No. This was my fault. I'll take the blame.\" \"Look, Mom will be home early in the morning. Why don't you go upstairs?\" \"I'm not going upstairs. I'm staying with you.\" \"Really? Why?\" \"Two reasons. One, the stairs are broken. Two, this is just as much my fault as yours. We should share the blame.\" \"Thanks, Taylor. By the way, you're a good sibling.\" \"Glad you think that. Maybe we can room together at a school.\" \"Well, here goes.\" Getting much better. These covers are out, they are in! All the time. It is getting better all the time. Better, better, better. Spin! Spin! Spin! It is getting better all the time. Better, better, better. I have to say it is getting better. A little better all the time. It cannot get worse. Yes, I say it is getting better. It is getting better. Bye. Since you have been mine. Getting much better all the time. Okay, we had some good times. We cleaned up the home. We even made an up-tempo tune for the sound. That is important. I guess there is just one last thing to check. It looks like everything is in balance, but you are still smoking too many smokes. And you, stop the drinks. Cat, this day has been amazing. Thank you, Cat. For everything. Cameron? Taylor? Goodbye. Taylor: Cat! Cameron: Cat! Wait, Cat. Do not go. Jessica: All right, kids. This place better not be a mess. I am home. Hi, Mom. Hi, Mom. Miss Madison, home so soon? The children were angels. Thanks, Mrs. Nora. Hello, Jessica. Matthew, what happened to you? They happened to me. Your kids. They broke your home! The home was alive. The wall was made of paper. I fell off the cliff. And the giant cat... The giant cat! Tell her. Matthew, Matthew. You look bad, and my mom thinks you are insane. This is what we in sales call a win-win time. Jessica, you are missing the chance of a lifetime. You know what kind of kid your boy is. I mean, who are you going to believe? You are right. I do know what kind of kid Cameron is. He can be irresponsible. Yes. He makes bad choices. Yes. Sometimes he makes me want to pull my hair out. Yes. But he is a good kid, and I believe in him. Now, I would like you to leave. Wha... Jessica.", "hash": "2246ba1a108bd324536a4bffbde253cdba224760f52d09a05ad7f80e8cb96ac7"}
