{"text": "Lesson: Let's Learn About Thinking\n\n## Part 1: What is Thinking?\nThinking is about asking big questions about everything around us, like what is real, what is good, and how we know things. It's about using good thinking to understand the world and people. We have been thinking for a long time, and it has helped us learn about things like science, helping each other, and making art.\n\n## Part 2: The Life of a Thinker\nOne famous thinker was named Peter Frederick Strawson. But let's call him Patrick. Patrick was born a long time ago and is not here anymore. Patrick spent most of his life at a school called Oxford, where he was very important.\n\nPatrick thought a lot about language, what's real, how we know things, and the history of thinking. People liked how well he could think and he helped other people think better too. Patrick's thinking made the school focus on more big questions, not just small ones that J.L. Austin liked.\n\n## Part 3: Why is Thinking Important?\nThinking is important because it helps us to understand the world around us and our place in it. By asking big questions about everything, we can understand ourselves and the world better. Thinking also helps us to think better, which is good for many things in life, like science, helping each other, and making art.\n\n## Part 4: The End\nThinking is an interesting and tough thing to learn. It has helped us understand the world and people for a long time. By learning about thinking, we can learn to think better and understand more about the world around us. Whether you want to be a thinker when you grow up or just want to learn more about it, there is something for everyone in learning about thinking.\n\n## Words to Remember\n- Thinking: Asking big questions about everything around us.\n- What's real: The part of thinking about what is real.\n- How we know things: The part of thinking about how we know things.\n- Good thinking: The way of thinking and checking information to make a good decision.\n\n## The End Thoughts\nThinking can be hard but also very fun. By learning about thinking, we can learn to think better and understand more about the world around us. Whether you want to be a thinker when you grow up or just want to learn more about it, there is something for everyone in learning about thinking.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 1003, "idx": 270463, "original text": "Peter Frederick Strawson 1919\u20132006.

Writing primarily about the philosophy of language, metaphysics, epistemology, and the history of philosophy, he succeeded in redirecting Oxford philosophy away from the limitations that had to some extent been accepted under the influence of J. L. Austin, towards a re-engagement with some traditional and also some new abstract philosophical issues. Strawson established from the early 1950s onwards a pre-eminence within Oxford philosophy, both through his publications but also by his quite exceptional, although never brutal, critical abilities. Simultaneously, he established himself as one of the leading philosophers in the world..

They often use different things like cloth, thread, and yarn to make pieces that look nice and make us feel happy. In this lesson, we will learn about the story, ways, and kinds of colorful blankets, as well as about some famous artists who make them.\n\nPart 1: Story of Colorful Blankets\n\nColorful blankets have been here for a very long time, with old ones going back to a time long, long ago. But it was not until the late 20th century that colorful blankets started to be seen as real art. This change happened because of some things, like the rise of girl power and the growing love for crafts and folk art.\n\nIn the time of our grandparents, a group of ladies called the \"New Blanket Friends\" started playing with normal blanket patterns and things, adding parts of new art into their work. This led to a new kind of blanket called \"modern blankets,\" which mixed usual ways with new designs and bright colors.\n\nToday, colorful blankets are seen as a special kind of visual art, with museums and galleries showing these works. They are made by both hobby and pro artists and are often shown in exhibits with other kinds of modern art.\n\nPart 2: Ways and Kinds in Colorful Blankets\n\nThere are many ways and kinds used in colorful blankets, including:\n\n1. Painting on Cloth: This way involves putting paint or dye right onto cloth, which is then sewn into the blanket. This method lets for big control over color and design, making complex and detailed patterns.\n\n2. Applique: Applique is the act of sewing smaller pieces of cloth onto a bigger background cloth to make a design. This way is often used to add decorations or to make complex patterns.\n\n3. Piecing: Piecing involves sewing together small pieces of cloth to make a bigger design. This way is usually used to make geometric patterns or to make pictures or paintings in cloth form.\n\n4. Mixed Things: Many colorful blankets add extra materials such as buttons, beads, or found objects into their designs. These things can add texture, depth, and interest to the piece.\n\n5. Free Quilting: This kind of quilting focuses on just going with the flow and trying things out, with little to no planning or drawing before starting. The results can be surprising and lively, with a big focus on the process of making.\n\nPart 3: Famous Artists and Examples\n\nThere are many good artists making colorful blankets today. Some famous names include:\n\n1. Faith, an artist who is known for her story blankets, which often show scenes from her life and experiences. Her best painting, \"The Big City Pictures,\" shows bright colors and big shapes that make you think of a busy city.\n\n2. Yara Samuels: Yara is an artist from a country far away who uses cloth to make her art. She likes to use shapes from nature in her work. Her cloth pictures are pretty and show she pays attention to small things.\n\n3. Sophia Roberts: Sophia is an artist from our country who uses fabric and different types of materials in her cloth pictures. She likes to think about who people are and where they come from in her work, with a focus on people's lives.\n\n4. Kevin Franklin: Kevin is an artist and designer from another country known for his bright, colorful cloth and quilts. He likes to use complicated shapes and designs in his work, inspired by his travels to many places.\n\nIn the end, art quilts are a special and fun type of picture that uses traditional quilt-making skills with new design and expression.

An atoll is an island made of coral which has a lagoon. A lagoon is a shallow pool of brackish or salt water, separated from deeper waters by said coral reefs or sandbars, making the two geographical entities symbiotic. Cook named the small island Christmas Island. It is part of the Line Islands or Equatorial Islands \u2013 a group of 11 coral reefs located south of the Hawaiian Islands, 4,200 miles from Sydney and 3,330 miles from San Francisco.\n\nChristmas Island is about 0.125 square miles with the lagoon area approximately the same size. This means there are about 80 acres of land making it the largest land area of any atoll in the world. It is an irregularly shaped island with 93 miles of coastline with another 30 miles of shoreline associated with the lagoon. The island came under US jurisdiction in 1856 with the Guano Islands Act. The Treaty of Tarawa, ratified in 1982, formally ceded the islands to Kiribati.\n\nDuring the late 1950s, the atolls of the Pacific Ocean were used for nuclear tests. Now called Kiritimati \u2013 the name may sound Polynesian, but is an actual translation of Christmas Island to Gilbertese and of Australian lineage. The British used the island as a base. Their first attempt to detonate a hydrogen bomb at Malden Island was a failure. On November 8, 1957 they successfully completed a test on the southeast tip of Kiritimati. There were also 22 nuclear detonations by the US either on or above the island.\n\nThe military left the area by 1969, leaving behind military bases \u2013 partly dismantled and partly renovated for civilian use. In 1989 there were about 2,000 people living on the island. By 2005 the census had increased to 5,115 with the population divided between four villages. Tabawakea is the largest with 1,881 people there. London, Banana, and Poland complete the list with Paris lying in ruins. Kiritimati lies close to the International Date Line and shares the time with the Hawaiian Islands. The date, however, is different. New Year\u2019s comes first to this tiny island each year.\n\n\u201cThe world has achieved brilliance without wisdom, power without conscience. Ours is a world of nuclear giants and ethical infants. We know more about war that we know about peace, more about killing that we know about living.\u201d \u2013 Omar Bradley\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s hard to get more real world than military testing. When you\u2019re life is on the line, every move counts.\u201d \u2013 Brad Fain\n\n\u201cWe are opposed to any further military testing on our lands.\u201d \u2013 Raymond Yowell\n\nThis article first appeared at examiner.com in 2009. Editor\u2019s update: James Cook was born in November 1728 and was a British explorer, navigator, mapmaker, and Captain in the Royal Navy. He began with exploration of Newfoundland and then made three separate voyages to the Pacific Ocean. During his travels there, he contacted the eastern coastline of Australia and visited the Hawaiian Islands. He was also the discoverer of this small bit of land as well as being the first to record the circumnavigation of New Zealand. At the time of his travels, the area was mostly uncharted so his information and ability to create maps was as important as his actual discoveries. During his third trip, he was killed in Hawaii during a confrontation with the natives. He was 50 years old at the time. His legacy was to influence succeeding naval discovery for over a hundred years.", "hash": "c4ad05a84d267d7561a7b7c38c0ef12281e2627a0a40bc0e23211626b1cd9a51"}

{"text": "Story: About Red Tiny Things in Our Body\n\nLet's start:\nSometimes, adults have a special type of tiny red things in their body called F-type. Usually, there's not many of them, but in some people, there can be a lot. People have studied these F-types when they're trying to learn about a sickness called P.R.V. Now, we're going to talk about where F-types come from.\n\nChapter 1: What is the Tiny Red Thing?\nThese tiny red things are actually a part of something in our body called H-type. H-type is found in our red cells and helps to carry air from our lungs to other parts of our body. There are different kinds of H-types like A-type (for adults), S-type (for sick cells), and F-type (for little ones). F-type is usually not a lot in adults, but sometimes, there can be many.\n\nChapter 2: When Things Go Wrong\nWith a sickness like P.R.V., the place where red cells are made in our body produces wrong cells. These wrong cells can cause problems. In P.R.V., too many red cells are made which can cause many problems.\n\nChapter 3: F-types in Normal People\nPeople have studied the F-types in those with P.R.V. and in normal people. They found that the number of F-types was different in people with P.R.V. compared to normal people. This means that F-types probably come from the same source as other adult cells, and not from a separate source.\n\nChapter 4: The Sugar Energy Problem\nTwo more people with P.R.V. were found to have an energy problem. This problem is about a gene called G6PD. This gene helps red cells to use sugar for energy. But these people had a wrong copy of this gene. This showed the nature of P.R.V. in a direct way, as they had more F-types than other people with P.R.V.\n\nChapter 5: The End\nFinding F-types in normal people means that these cells probably come from the same source as other adult cells. This is different from what we thought before that F-types came from a separate source. Understanding where F-types come from may help us learn more about the role of F-types in our body and find new ways to help people with problems related to F-types.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 784, "idx": 14620, "original text": "Cellular origins of the fetal-haemoglobin-containing cells of normal adults.\nThe origin of the small population of adult red cells which contain Hb F (F-cells) has been studied in a clonal disorder of haemopoiesis, polycythaemia rubra vera (P.R.V.). In eleven patients who had not received cytotoxic therapy F-cells comprised less than 0.1% to 11.9% of the circulating red cells, compared with 0.34% to 4.6% in 21 haematologically normal controls. Two additional patients were glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase heterozygotes in whom the clonal nature of the P.R.V. could be demonstrated directly; they had F-cell values of 2.1% and 8.3%. These observations indicate that F-cells arise from the same population of stem cells as other adult cells and not from a separate stem-cell pool.", "hash": "a29e045a6268f50673439378034a1e4dadd7ef592405b9c42a63584a35917486"}
{"text": "Lesson: How to Look at and Understand a Diary Page\n\n**Start:**\nA diary page is where someone writes about their thoughts, feelings, and what they did. Looking at and understanding a diary page can help us learn about someone's life and see how they think. In this lesson, we will learn how to look at and understand a diary page.\n\n**Part 1: Understanding How a Diary Page is Made**\nA diary page has a few parts, like the day, a short story about what happened that day, and the writer's thoughts and feelings about what happened. Here is an example of a diary page:\n\n```\nEarly in the Summer\n\nLast night, I sewed two more rows, took a picture, and then forgot to add it to my blog. On this project, I have used golden thread on the first row, large red thread on the second, black thread on the second and fourth rows, and wine-colored thread on the last and fifth row.\n\nThis morning, I added a sixth row using some red thread (not in the picture). I should be able to finish it today, except for the shiny stones which I don't have and will see if I can find some golden beads all the same size.\n\nI think I might have some but have not yet looked for them. I have been looking at the finished picture and been wondering how exactly it was done. There seems to be some golden thread used somehow. It looks very good, just not sure how it was done as I can't see enough of it :-(.\n\nPatricia.\n```\n\nIn this page, the writer writes the day, talks about their sewing project, talks about adding a new row, and says they are confused about how the finished picture was done. They also say that they need to find some golden beads to finish the project.\n\n**Part 2: Looking at the Writer's Thoughts and Feelings**\nAs we read the diary page, we can start to understand the writer's thoughts and feelings. For example, the writer seems to be happy with their sewing project, but also unhappy because they can't finish it because they don't have all the things they need. They seem confused and curious about the finished picture, showing that they want to learn more about how it was done.\n\n**Part 3: Using Good Thinking Skills**\nAs we read and look at diary pages, we can use good thinking skills to better understand what the writer is thinking. For example, we might ask ourselves why the writer is so interested in how the finished picture was done, or what feelings the writer has as they try to finish their project. By asking these kinds of questions, we can understand the writer's thoughts and feelings better.\n\n**Ending:**\nReading and looking at a page from someone's book is fun! We can learn about what they think and feel. When we think hard, we can learn even more.\n\n**Word List:**\n- Book: This is where someone writes about what they think, feel, and do.\n- Page: This is what someone writes in their book.\n- How it looks: This is about how the book is set up and how the pages go together.\n- Thinking hard: This is when we look at something very carefully and think about it so we can learn more.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 958, "idx": 100375, "original text": "Tuesday, June 03, 2008.

What role do computers play in this type of dance?\n\n**Words to Remember:**\n- City dance: A type of dance that comes from cities and often goes along with fun music.\n- Sound from computers: Sounds from a computer that go along with the moves of the dancers.\n- Mixing: The process of putting two or more things together to make something new and unique.\n\n**Wrap-up:**\n\nCity dance is a lively and changing type of dance that combines moves with sound from computers to make a real experience for the audience. By learning about this type of dance, children can learn about the power of being creative, the importance of music and movement, and how computers can change the way we experience the world around us.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 659, "idx": 300359, "original text": "I Infinite.

What does the special jelly do to the cell's power to make magic potions?\n4. How do the special jelly and the magic potion start making new cells?\n\nPart 1: What is the special jelly?\nThe special jelly (we can call it J) is a tiny thing in cells that helps cells do many things like growing and changing. It comes from another tiny thing in cells.\n\nPart 2: How does the special jelly stop the making of new cells in cow cells?\nThe people who studied this found that the special jelly stops cow cells from making new cells. This is different from what happens when cells don't have enough food.\n\nPart 3: What does the special jelly do to the cell's power to make magic potions?\nThe study showed that the special jelly helps cow cells make more magic potions. But, the special jelly also stops new cells from being made, even when there is a magic potion that usually makes cells grow. This makes the cells big with more power to make magic potions, but they don't make new cells.\n\nPart 4: How do the special jelly and the magic potion start making new cells?\nWhen the special jelly is gone, cells start making new cells right away. But, cells that have been given the magic potion only start making new cells after waiting a while. The study suggests that the special jelly and the magic potion start making new cells in different ways. The special jelly stops new cells from being made, but the magic potion can make cells grow even when there is special jelly.\n\nConclusion:\nIn this story, we learned about how a magic potion changes things in animal cells. We talked about the effects of the magic potion on how cells copy themselves and their ability to make special juices. We also mentioned how the magic potion and growth helpers affect the start of the copying process. We also defined the magic potion and explained its role as a special message carrier.\n\nGlossary:\n- Magic potion: A special juice\n- Growing time: The first part of the cell life, during which cells grow and get ready to copy themselves\n- Copying time: The time of the cell life during which cells copy themselves\n- Juice making ability: The ability of cells to produce special juices\n- Magic ingredient: A magic ingredient used in the making of different special juices\n- Shiny juices: Juices that shine when shown under a specific light, allowing for their seeing and measuring\n- Big grow: Odd growth or getting bigger of a part or a body piece\n- Deciding point: The point at which cells decide whether to start the copying process or to stop the cell life\n- Message carriers: Signaling helpers that carry information from cell surface to inside cell targets, such as helpers or other parts.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1133, "idx": 262008, "original text": "Kinetics of cAMP inhibition of DNA synthesis in bovine adrenocortical cells.\ncAMP-treated bovine adrenocortical cells are arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Removal of serum also arrests bovine adrenocortical cells in G1. In the presence of cAMP, serum and fibroblast growth factor stimulate increases in medium cell volume, but DNA synthesis is not initiated. Under these conditions cAMP increases steroidogenic capacity 7- to 10-fold as assessed by metabolism of pregnenolone to fluorogenic steroids. When the kinetics of entry of cells into S phase are quantitated, serum- and FGF-treated cells initiate DNA synthesis at an exponential rate after a 12-h lag. In contrast when cAMP is removed, cells immediately initiate DNA synthesis without a lag at a similar exponential rate (6.3 and 5.3% of the cells entering S/h). In the presence of growth factors, cAMP-treated bovine adrenocortical cells are thus hypertrophied with increased steroidogenic capacity, but are reversibly arrested at the G1/S boundary.

{"text": "# Lesson: Being Fair with Friends\n## Introduction\nIn this lesson, we will talk about how sometimes, friends can have more control than others. We will see how this can change things for young boys and girls, and talk about why it's important to look at how friends treat each other.\n## Section 1: Understanding Being Fair with Friends\n### Topic 1: What does it mean to be fair?\nBeing fair means that all friends should have the same amount of control. Sometimes, one friend may have more control than the other because of things like having more toys, being older, or being stronger.\n### Topic 2: How does it change things for young boys and girls when one friend has more control?\nStudies have shown that when one friend has more control, it changes things more for young girls than young boys. This is because girls are often told to be more quiet and less in control than boys. So, they might have more problems when they are friends with someone who has more control.\n### Topic 3: Why does being fair matter?\nBeing fair is important because it can help friends get along better. When one friend has more control, they might use it to tell the other friend what to do. This can make the other friend sad and hurt, and it can make the friendship less fun.\n## Section 2: Looking at How Friends Can Be More or Less Fair\n### Topic 1: What makes one friend have more control?\nMany things can make one friend have more control. These include things like what people believe, what is normal in their home or country, and their own past experiences. For example, if a girl is told that boys should be in control, she might think it's okay if her friend has more control.\n### Topic 2: How can we help friends be more fair?\nTo help friends be more fair, we need to help them see and change what people believe and what is normal that makes one friend have more control. We can do this by showing everyone that boys and girls should be equal and that good friendships are about being kind and helpful to each other.\n### Topic 3: How do what boys and girls should do play a part in one friend having more control?\nWhat boys and girls should do can make one friend have more control. This is because it can make people think that boys should be in control and girls should not. This can lead to friendships where one friend has more control. To help friends be more fair, we need to help change what people think boys and girls should do and show that all friends should have the same amount of control.\n## Section 3: Using What We've Learned to Help Our Friendships\n### Topic 1: How can we use what we've learned to make our friendships better?\nBy understanding how control can change things for young boys and girls, we can work to make our friendships better. This means helping change what people think boys and girls should do and showing that all friends should be kind and helpful to each other.\n### Topic 2: How can we help others have more fair friendships?\nWe can help our friends when they don't feel good in their relationships by being there for them. We can tell them about groups that can help or give them ideas on how to talk to their friend. \n\n## The End\nIn the end, knowing when friends don't feel good in their relationships is important for helping them. By looking at how these feelings happen and asking questions about how boys and girls should act, we can make sure everyone is treated equally and kindly.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 3296, "idx": 436148, "original text": "BUFFALO, N.Y. - Power imbalances in heterosexual relationships are common, but having less power takes a greater toll on young women than young men, according to a recently published University at Buffalo study.\n\nThe results, appearing in The Journal of Sex Research, suggest \"a healthy skepticism when it comes to what looks like gender equality,\" says Laina Bay-Cheng, an associate professor in the UB School of Social Work and an expert in young women's sexuality. \"This research refutes the claim that gender equality has been reached and we don't have to worry about misogyny anymore.\"\n\nBay-Cheng says the dynamics underneath relationships require scrutiny and the often-heard claim that girls and women have reached and in some ways surpassed equality with men unravels quickly when examined in detail.\n\n\"We have to look closely at relationships and experiences and stop taking surface indicators as proof of gender equality,\" says Bay-Cheng. \"When men are subordinate in a relationship, it doesn't bother them very much. They don't see those relationships as less intimate or stable than relationships in which they are dominant. But for young women, having less power in a relationship is associated with diminished intimacy and stability and comes with greater risk of abuse.\n\n\"Inequality within a relationship doesn't cost men as much because they are still cushioned by a broader system of male privilege.\"\n\nRelationships that develop during emerging adulthood are foundational events. It's from these early experiences that people learn how to be in a relationship and depending on the nature and quality of the experiences, the effects - both positive and negative - can echo throughout life.\n\n\"It's so important that we understand that it's not that sex and relationships are at the root of risk or vulnerability. Instead, some young women, because of intersecting forms of oppression - especially misogyny, racism and economic injustice - enter relationships and are already at a disadvantage,\" says Bay-Cheng. \"For young women, relationships are where all different forms of vulnerability and injustice converge.\"\n\nBay-Cheng developed a novel research method for this study that considered both the objectives of researchers and participants' experience, which, she says, is as important as the findings.\n\nFor this study, Bay-Cheng used a digital, online calendar that participants fill out using all of their sexual experiences from their adolescence and early adulthood. The open-ended digital calendar can be filled out over a month and participants can enter anything they want, not just text, but audio files, images or even emoji.\n\nThe result is a more meaningful measure for researchers and participants.\n\n\"On the research side we get varied and diverse data,\" says Bay-Cheng. \"For participants, rather than circling a number on a scale on some survey, they get to express themselves how they want, at their own pace, and then look at their calendars and get different perspective on their sexual histories and how these relate to other parts of their lives. Participants have told us how meaningful that chance to reflect can be. It's important for researchers to care as much about the quality of participants' experiences in our studies as the quality of our data.\"\n\n###", "hash": "f4b9170a2bb5660d38aa180684d534520fdfa407d5cf88cf01cb558dd0bd5356"}

Diagnosis is suspected when early signs of retroperitoneal haemorrhage appear, but may often be delayed for weeks or years due to formation of a pseudoaneurysm or an arteriovenous fistula which may be of gradual onset and produce initially only a few symptoms. Prompt diagnosis and aggressive treatment can improve the current mortality rate of more than 50%. Two cases are described that illustrate the full spectrum of acute and chronic manifestations of such injuries. One case of acute haemorrhage due to arterial trauma was immediately detected and the other case with arteriovenous fistula was recognized several years post-operatively.", "hash": "04d9b4a8b5355600c1a98c3c929aa2f3b9946aa5903a38ffe4d9523b63a9c87d"}
{"text": "Lesson: Looking for Fun Game Tools\n\nIntroduction:\nIn this lesson, we will learn about looking for fun game tools. We will find out about different types of game tools, compare similar items, and find the best ones. By the end of this lesson, you will be able to make smart choices when buying game tools.\n\nSection 1: Understanding Game Tools\n- Game tools are the things used by kids during a fun game. This includes toy guns, safety tools, and extras.\n- There are many types of game tools, including ones for fun play, competition, and professional games. Fun play tools are for everyday fun, while competition and professional tools are for serious games.\n\nSection 2: Comparing Game Tools\n- When looking at game tools, think about the cost, how it works, if it will last a long time, and if it's easy to use.\n- Cost is an important thing to think about because it can change how good the tool is. But, it is not the only thing to think about.\n- How it works is another important thing. This means how fast and accurate the toy gun is. Good toy guns may cost more but are faster and more accurate.\n- If it will last a long time is also important. Game tools made from good materials will last longer and can be used in many games.\n- If it's easy to use is another thing to think about. Some game tools are easier to use than others, and this can make the game more fun.\n\nSection 3: Finding the Best Game Tools\n- To find the best game tools, it's good to look around and compare prices at different stores.\n- Online stores often have the best game tools because they don't have as many costs and can give discounts and special offers.\n- It's also good to read what other people say about the tools before buying them. This can help you find out if there are any problems and make sure you are getting a good tool.\n- Lastly, think about buying used or fixed up tools as a less costly option. Many stores offer fixed up tools that have been checked and tested for quality.\n\nWords to Know:\n- Game tools: Things used by kids during a fun game.\n- Toy gun: A pretend gun.\n- Safety tools: Things worn by kids to stay safe from getting hurt.\n- Extras: More things used by kids, like pretend vests and pretend bombs.\n\nConclusion:\nLooking for game tools is an important skill for any kid. By understanding the different types of tools, comparing them, and finding the best ones, you can make sure you are getting the best tools for the best price. To be good at shopping for play items, you can use the tricks in this lesson.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 589, "idx": 220765, "original text": "tippmann a5 vs 98.

{"text": "Lesson: How to Find Things on the Internet\n\nBeginning:\nIn this time, there is a lot of stuff you can find on the internet. But, finding the right stuff can be hard. In this lesson, we will learn how to find the things we need on the internet.\n\nPart 1: How to Find Things on the Internet\n\nAbout 1: Searching on the Internet\nSearching on the internet is a good way to find things. But, not all search places are the same. Some well-known search places include GO website, BI website, and YA website. When looking for things, it is important to use the right words to get the best results.\n\nQuestion: What are some tricks for using search places well?\nAnswer: Some tricks for using search places well include using exact words, using \"\" to find exact sentences, using options to make results smaller, and using more search options.\n\nAbout 2: Website Lists\nWebsite lists are collections of websites that are sorted by type. Some well-known website lists include YA List, DM List, and BU List. Website lists can be a helpful way to find stuff on certain topics.\n\nQuestion: How are website lists different from search places?\nAnswer: Website lists are different from search places because they are sorted by type, while search places use ways to order results based on how they fit.\n\nPart 2: Checking Internet Stuff\n\nAbout 1: Trust\nWhen checking internet stuff, it is important to think about the trust of the source. Trustworthy sources are usually written by experts and are shared by good groups.\n\nQuestion: How can you tell if a source is trustworthy?\nAnswer: You can tell if a source is trustworthy by looking at the writer's skills, the group's good name, and if the stuff presented is right.\n\nAbout 2: Rightness\nRightness is another important thing to think about when checking internet stuff. It is important to check the stuff presented with many sources to make sure it's right.\n\nQuestion: How can you tell if stuff is right?\nAnswer: You can tell if stuff is right by checking it with many sources, looking for places where it is quoted or referred, and checking the date it was shared.\n\nPart 3: Using Internet Stuff for Learning\n\nAbout 1: Quoting Sources\nWhen using internet stuff for learning, it is important to quote them correctly. Quote styles change depending on the field, but generally, you should include the writer's name, title of the work, date it was shared, and the website.\n\nQuestion: How do you quote an internet source in ML style?\nAnswer: To quote an internet source in ML style, you should include the writer's name, title of the work, date it was shared, and the website. For example: Adam, \"How Websites Affect Our Thinking.\" 2020. www.example.com.\n\nTopic 2: Copying\nCopying is a very bad thing in school and can get you in trouble. It's important to say thank you when someone helps us and avoid saying or writing something that someone else has already said or written without saying thank you.\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between copying and saying thank you?\nAnswer: The difference between copying and saying thank you is that copying means using something that someone else has made without saying thank you, while saying thank you means giving a thank you to the person who made it.\n\nIn the end, using websites and books properly needs knowing how to use search boxes, book lists, and how to pick the best ones. By looking at who made them and if they are right, and saying thank you right, we can use websites and books to make our learning better.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 730, "idx": 248571, "original text": "Need Help?.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Movies\n\nIn this lesson, we will learn about movies and how people can tell if a movie is successful or not. We will talk about these sections:\n\nI. Learning About Movies\nII. Looking at Movie Results\nIII. Using What We Learned\nIV. New Words\nV. End of Lesson\n\nI. Learning About Movies\n\nWe often hear the word \"box office\" when talking about movies. This term is used to describe where tickets are bought for movies. It also helps us understand how much money a movie makes when it's being shown in the theater.\n\nII. Looking at Movie Results\n\nTo see if a movie is successful, we need to look at a few things like how much money it made in the first three days, how much money was spent to make the movie, how much money was used to tell people about the movie, and who the movie was made for. We will use the example of \"Nathan\" and \"Samuel\" to explain these things.\n\nA. The First Three Days\n\nHow much money a movie makes in the first three days can tell us a lot about how successful it might be. For \"Nathan,\" it made $10 million on its first day, while \"Samuel\" earned $9.4 million.\n\nB. Money Spent\n\nThe money that is spent to make a movie is important to know. \"Nathan\" cost $50 million to make, while \"Samuel\" was made with a lot less money, only $12 million.\n\nC. Telling People About the Movie\n\nWhen a new movie is coming out, a lot of money is used to tell people about it. This is done to make people excited to see the movie.\n\nD. Who Was the Movie Made For?\n\nEvery movie is made with a certain group of people in mind. For \"Nathan,\" it was made for grown-ups who like action movies, while \"Samuel\" was made for Christian families who want a nice movie to watch together.\n\nIII. Using What We Learned\n\nNow that we know a bit about movies, let's think about a new problem. Let's say you are a person who makes movies and you want to know if it's a good idea to invest in a small movie that a lot of people liked.\n\n1. Look at the first three days: See how well the movie did on its first three days compared to other similar movies. If it did well, there is a big chance it will keep doing well in the following weeks.\n\n2. Find the breakeven point: Figure out when the movie starts making money. You can do this by taking the cost of the movie and dividing it by how much of the ticket price the theater gets.\n\n3. Look at how much people like the movie: You can see if people like the movie by what they say on social media, how many people watch the movie's online videos, and other ways. If lots of people are interested in the movie, then the movie might do really well when it comes out.\n\nIV. Word List\n\nHere are some words you might see when we talk about movies:\n\n- Box Office: This is where people buy tickets to watch a movie.\n- First Weekend Money: This is the money a movie makes in its first three days.\n- Budget: This is the money used to make the movie.\n- Sharing Costs: These are the costs to let more people know about the movie.\n- Who the Movie is For: This is the group of people the movie is made for.\n\nV. Ending\n\nIn this story, we learned about how to see if a movie is doing well when it comes out. We talked about the things that can make a movie do well, like how much money it makes on the first weekend, the budget, the costs to share it with others, and who the movie is for. Lastly, we used what we learned to think about a made-up movie with a small budget.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 3128, "idx": 633655, "original text": "Box Office: 'Non-Stop' Flies Past 'Son of God' With $10 Million Friday\n\nUPDATED: Mark Burnett and Roma Downey's Christian film \"Son of God\" earns a strong $9.4 million and could still engineer an upset; \"The Lego Movie\" falls to No. 3 as it prepares to cross the $200 million mark sometime over the weekend.\n\nLiam Neeson's latest action thriller Non-Stop flew past Christian movie Son of God to narrowly top the North American box office with $10 million for a projected $30 million weekend.\n\nMark Burnett and Roma Downey's Son of God, chronicling the life of Jesus Christ and adapted from their hit television miniseries The Bible, took the No. 2 spot with a strong $9.4 million. That puts the faith-based film on course to gross $25 million, although it could overperform to pull ahead for the weekend.\n\nBoth films earned an A- CinemaScore. Of any film, Son of God is considered the most immune to Sunday's Academy Awards ceremony, which can often result in a dip in moviegoing.\n\nNon-Stop marks another victory for Neeson's career as an elder action star, and is on course to score the best opening of any of the actor's recent action thrillers outside of Taken 2 ($49.5 million). The movie is the first film distributed by Universal per its new deal with Joel Silver's Silver Pictures.\n\nSTORY: Rough Seas on 'Noah': Darren Aronofsky Opens Up on the Biblical Battle to Woo Christians\n\nIn the film, Neeson stars as a U.S. federal air marshal who runs into trouble on a flight from New York to London. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, Non-Stop also stars Julianne Moore, Downton Abbey's Michelle Dockery, Oscar nominee Lupita Nyong'o and House of Card's Corey Stoll.\n\nReleased by 20th Century Fox, Son of God is an unusual offering in that it largely uses footage from a television show, although deleted scenes from the miniseries are also featured.\n\nThe movie amassed more than $4 million in advance ticket sales, helping to account for Friday's particularly strong number and thanks to heavy interest from churches and religious organizations that organized group outings and theater takeovers.\n\nThe film opens exactly a decade after Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ became an instant hit, opening to a massive $83.8 million on its way to earning $612 million worldwide. Son of God, lacking the controversy that Passion of the Christ sparked, wasn't expected to match those numbers.\n\nSon of God is the first in a slew of biblical and faith-based films set for 2014. On March 28, Paramount debuts Darren Aronofsky's tentpole Noah. The studio will play a trailer of Noah before Son of God.\n\nWarner Bros. and Village Roadshow Pictures' The Lego Movie fell to No. 3 after ruling the domestic box office for three consecutive weekends, grossing $4.4 million for a domestic total of $192.7 million. The 3D animated blockbuster will soar past the $200 million mark sometime over the weekend.\n\nAlso this weekend, Paramount is rereleasing an R-rated, extended version of Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues in more than 1,000 theaters nationwide. The film is expected to earn roughly $1.4 million for the weekend to come in No. 14.", "hash": "66292fd0f0dfaeeec520979fb7925548308ad837ac88a4ee4e8fbb656c126913"}
{"text": "Lesson Title: Learning About Food Labels and Changing Recipes\n\nIntroduction:\nFood labels are important for knowing what's in the food we eat. They tell us how much energy, fat, sugar, and other things are in a bit of food. Knowing about food labels can help us choose better food when we shop or eat out. In this lesson, we will learn how to read food labels and change recipes to make them less fatty and full of energy.\n\nSection 1: Reading Food Labels\n\nTopic 1: Understanding Food Labels\n- A food label tells us what's in the food we eat.\n- The label tells us how much food is in one bit, how many bits are in a packet, how much energy, fat, sugar, and other things are in it.\n- The label also tells us how much of each thing we need every day.\n\nTopic 2: Making Sense of Food Labels\n- The bit size is how much food is in one bit. It's important to know this so we can know what's in our food.\n- The energy in one bit tells us how much energy is in the food.\n- To know the total fat, we times the fat by 0.45 to find the energy from fat.\n- To find how much of each thing we need every day, we divide the amount on the label by what we need every day.\n\nSection 2: Changing Recipes to Have Less Energy and Fat\n\nTopic 1: Less Energy\n- One way to make a recipe have less energy is to use ingredients that have less energy.\n- For example, instead of full cream milk, we can use skim milk or low-fat milk.\n- Another way to have less energy is to use less oil or butter when we cook.\n- Using a spray oil or less oil can make food have a lot less energy.\n\nTopic 2: Less Fat\n- To make a recipe have less fat, we can use meat with less fat or chicken without skin.\n- Instead of normal cheese, we can use low-fat cheese or cheese without fat.\n- To use less butter or oil when we bake, we can use apple sauce or yogurt instead.\n- Adding more veggies to a recipe can also make it have less fat.\n\nSection 3: Practice Questions\n\n1. How much energy is in one bit of the Chicken Soup from the story?\n2. How much of the fat we need every day is in the Chicken Soup?\n3. How can we make a recipe have less energy?\n4. What is a low-fat type of normal cheese?\n\nConclusion:\nIn this lesson, we learned how to read food labels and change recipes to make them less fatty and full of energy. By knowing what's in our food and changing our recipes a little bit, we can make healthier meals that are still yummy.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 890, "idx": 29096, "original text": "A few weeks ago I was watching Barefoot Contessa.

{"text": "Story: Taking Pictures with Your Camera\n\n**Beginning:** Taking pictures is a fun thing we all enjoy. We can capture memories and make art. Taking pictures is now easier with digital cameras. We can also share our pictures with others. In this story, we will learn about different types of cameras, how to take nice pictures, and how to make your pictures look better.\n\n**Chapter 1: Different Kinds of Cameras**\n\nThere are many kinds of digital cameras we can use:\n\n1. Simple Cameras: These are very common and easy to use. They have settings that can help you take nice pictures without having to change anything.\n\n2. Big Cameras: These cameras are a bit complicated but let you change the settings. They also let you change the lens so you can take different kinds of pictures.\n\n3. Small Cameras: These cameras are like big cameras but they are smaller and lighter. This makes them easy to carry around.\n\n4. Smaller System Cameras: These cameras are like small cameras but they let you change the lens. They are also smaller and lighter than big cameras but give you more control over the settings.\n\n**Chapter 2: How to Take Nice Pictures**\n\nTo take nice pictures, you need to understand a few things, like how to arrange things in the picture, how to use light, and how to focus. Here are some tips:\n\n1. Arranging: This is how you set up things in your picture. A good tip is to divide your picture into nine equal parts and place your subject a bit to the side.\n\n2. Lighting: Good light is very important. Try to take pictures early in the morning or late in the afternoon when the light is soft and warm. Do not take pictures in very bright sunlight or under strong indoor light.\n\n3. Focus: Make sure what you are taking a picture of is in focus. If you are taking a picture of a person, make sure their eyes are clear. If you are taking a picture of a place, make sure everything is in focus.\n\n**Chapter 3: Making Your Pictures Look Better**\n\nAfter you have taken your pictures, you can make them look even better. You can use a computer program to do this. Here are some ways to edit your pictures:\n\n1. Cutting: This is when you remove parts of the picture that you don't want. Use the cutting tool to choose the part you want to keep and cut the rest away.\n\n2. Brightness: This is how bright your picture is. You can change the brightness by using the sliders in the picture editing program.\n\n3. Light and Dark: This means the difference between the bright and not-so-bright parts of the picture. You can change how bright or not-so-bright parts are with your photo editor.\n\n**End Thought:** Taking digital pictures is a fun activity that lets you capture memories and make beautiful images. By knowing the basics of taking digital pictures, you can make even better pictures and make them look just right. Don't forget to try out different cameras and ways to see what you like the best.\n\n**Word List:**\n\n- Big Camera: A type of camera that uses a mirror to show the picture in the viewer\n- Mirrorless: A type of camera that doesn't use a mirror to show the picture in the viewer\n- Small Camera: A type of camera that is small and easy to carry\n- Rule of Thirds: A way to make your picture look better by dividing it into nine equal parts and not putting the subject right in the middle\n- Golden Hour: The time just after the sun rises or just before it sets when the light is soft and warm\n- Brightness: How bright the picture is\n- Light and Dark: The difference between the bright and not-so-bright parts of the picture", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 312, "idx": 335139, "original text": "Last year was a big year for me in terms of professional development (PD) and I am fortunate to be in a role that invariably includes learning (\u2026Read more.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Special Papers\n\n## Chapter 1: What is a Special Paper?\n\n**Start:** A special paper is a paper that gives its owner the only right to make, use, sell or bring in a new idea for a certain amount of time, usually 20 years. This means that no one else can use, sell or bring in the same new idea without asking the owner first.\n\n**Main Idea:** In this lesson, we will learn about what a special paper is, why it is important, and how to get one.\n\n**Part 1: What is a Special Paper?**Part 1: What is a Special Paper?**\n\nA special paper is a set of rights given by a government to a person who comes up with a new idea or their helper for a limited amount of time, usually 20 years. It covers making, using, selling, or bringing in the new idea.\n\n**Part 2: Why is a Special Paper Important?**Part 2: Why is a Special Paper Important?**\n\nA special paper is important because it gives the owner the only right to their new idea, which means that no one else can use, sell, or bring in the same new idea without asking the owner first. This lets the person who came up with the new idea make money from it by selling it, letting others use it, or making it themselves.\n\n**Part 3: How do you get a Special Paper?**Part 3: How do you get a Special Paper?**\n\nTo get a special paper, a person who comes up with a new idea must fill out a special paper form with their country's special paper office. The form must include a detailed description of the new idea, how it works, and why it's good. It must also include pictures and claims defining what makes the new idea new. The special paper office will then look at the form to see if the new idea is new, useful, and not obvious. If the form is approved, the person who came up with the new idea will be given a special paper.\n\n**End Thought:** In this lesson, we learned about what a special paper is, why it is important, and how to get one. We also learned about the process of filling out a special paper form and what you need to get a special paper.\n\n**Little Words:**\n- Thing-Right: A special paper that lets a person who made a new thing keep it, use it, sell it, or bring it to another place for a certain time.\n- New Thing: A new and helpful way, machine, made thing, or mix of things, or any new and helpful better way of these.\n- Thing-Right Place: A place run by leaders that gives thing-rights.\n- Sayings: A sentence that tells what the new thing is.\n\n**Talk Together:** Why are thing-rights important for us?", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 3598, "idx": 139028, "original text": "Blog\n\nLast week in Brussels I presented the EPO\u2019s annual results for 2014 at a well-attended conference with many journalists. For the fifth year in a row our growth continued for patent filings (+3.1% and almost 275 000 filings in 2014), representing a new record and confirming a positive trend (+10 000 patent filings each year on average). The share from the EPO member states remained stable (35% of the total), with some noticeable increases from the Netherlands, the UK and France. Among Europeans, German companies are still the main source of filings to the EPO (11% of the total) with a stable volume. Some countries with lower filing levels experienced some remarkable growth: Poland (+21.5%), Greece (+20.8%), Slovenia (+12.6%), Portugal (+7.6%) and Turkey (+6.2%). The remaining 65% of filings coming from outside Europe had four main origins: the US accounted for the largest share with 26%, followed by Japan (18%), China (9%) and Korea (6%). Two of them have significantly increased their volume: US up 6.8% over the previous year, and China up 18.2%. Another interesting indicator is the ratio of European patent applications per million inhabitants. The top 3 is composed of Switzerland with 848 applications per million inhabitants, Finland (416) and the Netherlands (406).\n\nSamsung topped the company ranking for the third year in a row, followed by Philips, Siemens, LG, Huawei, BASF, Qualcomm, Robert Bosch, Ericsson and Intel. But the EPO is not a service provider just for global companies: in 2014 30% of applications came from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and 6% from universities or research institutes. Regarding the different technological fields the volume of applications grew most strongly in 2014 in the fields of biotechnology (+12.1%), electrical machinery (+8%), computer technology (7.8%), digital communication and measurement (+6.6% each).\n\nA total of 64 600 patents were granted by the EPO in 2014, ca 3% fewer than in 2013. This is explained by a higher rate of withdrawal by applicants at a late stage of processing and the stronger focus of resources on the search phase, in particular with the start of the new Early Certainty from Search scheme since July 2014. In response to growing demand the EPO is further modernising its structure and improving its processes and services, The implementation of our Efficiency and Quality strategy is improving productivity and quality, placing emphasis on core activities with the recruitment of 191 examiners in 2014 (total: 4225). Indeed the Office is seen as a very attractive employer, receiving the highest number of applications (almost 20 000) last year. Several business-oriented initiatives taken in 2014 (e.g. PCT Direct, PCT top-up search, freeze of the fees) have been very popular, as seen by the positive trend in demand for our PCT services (the EPO delivers 38.3% of all international search reports and 55.7% of all international preliminary examination reports).\n\nIn the coming months, the final decisions regarding the unitary patent package should be taken, notably with regard to the level of the fees. The Global Dossier, launched in June 2014 with SIPO, should be completed with data from the other IP5 partners, making it a truly single entry point for easy access to information on parallel files. The preliminary work concerning the procedural harmonisation is really promising and should bear some fruits soon. To conclude, 2015 will bear witness to significant progress in helping the patent system to better respond to business needs and to improving quality globally.", "hash": "d714f17fcd14aa8ed262505c4f40ef3efd2671df38ac4a861602eadaf0b90412"}

In this story, we will learn about the right to be safe and why it matters so much.\n\nChapter 1: The Right to Be Safe\nThe right to be safe is a rule that says everyone should have what they need to be healthy and happy. This means having food, clothes, a house, and care when we are sick.

If we don't have food, a house, or care when we're sick, we can't be healthy or do our best. The right to be safe should be respected by all countries and people.\n\nChapter 3: Times When the Right to Be Safe is Broken\nEven though the right to be safe is very important, sometimes it is not respected. For example, in some places, many people don't have clean water, bathrooms, or healthcare. In some cases, people have to live in places that are not clean, which can make them sick. Also, there are many people who don't have a house or enough food.\n\nChapter 4: Helping People Be Safe\nThere are many ways to help people be safe. One way is to help provide food, water, and care to places that need it. Another way is to make sure there are jobs for people, which can help them have what they need.

They are family with stingrays.\n\n## Part 2: Fun Examples\nBig fish can sometimes hurt people, but it doesn't happen often. In a famous game, players can poke big fish with swords or big needles. Players do this by going close to a big fish and hitting the action button when told. The player then has to avoid the big fish's moves while trying to poke it. If the player can poke the big fish, they get things they can use to make stuff and weapons.\n\n## Part 3: Stories from the Real World\nBig fish are very important for the health of the sea. They are the kings of the sea and help control the number of other sea creatures and stop them from eating too much food. Sadly, too much fishing and destroying their homes have made fewer big fish in the seas. Many types of big fish are now in danger, which can be really bad for the sea.\n\n## Words to Remember\n- Soft bone body: a body made of soft bones, not hard ones\n- Family: a group of creatures that have the same grandpa and grandma\n- Breathing holes: holes in the body used for breathing\n- Arm-like fins: fins that look like arms, near the head\n- Big fish family: a family that includes big fish and stingrays\n\n## The End\nIn this story, we learned about big fish, what they look like, and why they are important for the sea. We also learned how players can poke big fish in a famous game and how this connects to the game's making system. By knowing about the real problems of big fish hunting, we can see why we need to work hard to keep these important creatures safe.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1134, "idx": 338082, "original text": "Watch a shark get stabbed in the face in Assassin's Creed 4\n\nYou probably already knew that sticking sharp things in endangered species was going to be a thing in Assassin's Creed 4 (though you can forgive Kenway a little, as back in his day they weren't quite so rare) so now here's a chance to see something a little more deserving of a forceful prod.

{"text": "Story: Why Good Friends are Important at Work\n\nBeginning:\nHaving good friends at work is very important for doing well. Good friends are people who help each other to reach a shared dream, have the same good ideas, and support each other. In this story, we will learn why having good friends at work is important and what makes a good friend.\n\nPart 1: Why Good Friends are Important\n\nThing 1: Working to Reach a Shared Dream\nGood friends are important because they help work places do their best. When all friends at work want the same thing, they can help each other, share ideas, and use what they have to reach their dream. This leads to better things and a smarter use of what they have.\n\nTopic 2: Sharing Good Things\nA good group is important because it shares the same good things and dreams like the big group. When all in the group believe in the big group's mission and good things, they are more likely to work for it. This makes everyone feel like they belong and have a goal, which makes them want to work harder and smarter.\n\nTopic 3: Helping Each Other\nA good group is also important because it helps each other. When people in the group feel helped, they are more likely to try new things, share their thoughts, and work towards the common goal. This makes a happy place where everyone feels important and nice.\n\nChapter 2: Things a Good Group Member Has\n\nTopic 1: Talking Well\nA good group member is someone who talks well. This means hearing others, saying thoughts clearly and calmly, and being open to advice. Talking well is important for making trust and working together in the group.\n\nTopic 2: Responsibility\nA good group member is someone who takes care of their actions. This means admitting to mistakes, saying sorry when needed, and taking steps to fix them. Responsibility makes a culture of truth and goodness within the group.\n\nTopic 3: Working Together\nA good group member is someone who works well with others. This means sharing thoughts, helping when needed, and being willing to agree when needed. Working together makes a happy place where everyone feels important and nice.\n\nChapter 3: Examples of Good Groups\n\nExample 1: The Moon Landing Group\nThe group that sent people to the moon in the late 20th century is a great example of a good group. They worked together towards a common goal, shared the same good things and dreams, and helped each other throughout the mission. Their working together and care for safety resulted in one of the biggest things humans ever did.\n\nExample 2: The Swim Group\nThe Swim Group that won lots of awards at the late 20th century competition is another great example of a good group. They worked together towards a common goal, shared the same good things and dreams, and helped each other throughout their training and the competition. Their working together and care for being the best resulted in many awards and world records.\n\nEnding Words:\nIn the end, having a good group is very important for the big group to win. A good group works towards a common goal, shares the same good things and dreams, and helps each other. People who are good at talking, taking responsibility, and working together are great group members. Examples of good groups include the Moon Landing Group and the Swim Group. By using the lessons learned here, people can help build winning groups in their own big groups.\n\nWord Meanings:\n- Group: A set of people who work together towards a common goal.\n- Working Together: The process of working together to reach a common goal.\n- Responsibility: Being responsible for what one does and mistakes.\n- Talking Skills: The skill to talk clearly and listen well to others.\n- Beliefs: Ideas that help guide how a person acts and makes choices.\n- Dream: A big wish or hope for the future.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 673, "idx": 330289, "original text": "Our People are the spirit of our airline..

During years one and two of the modernized MBBCh program, students complete 17 cases as part of the newly developed C21 curriculum that emphasizes a patient-oriented and student-centered approach to learning. The mental health case, which is presented in year 2, incorporates a number of novel teaching resources that aim to enhance the students' learning experience and to further reinforce the patient-oriented and community-based philosophy of C21. These include the use of fictionalized video diaries, virtual patient cases, e-learning workbooks, an interactive practical session, and community placements. Novel teaching methods and resources were evaluated by students in terms of effectiveness and value as learning resources through the administration of a structured mixed questionnaire. The results revealed that students valued the inclusion of these resources, which they evaluated as having contributed to their understanding of the subject area. Furthermore, the case was found to have had an impact on student interest in psychiatry as a specialty as well as a career choice.

Knowing how horses have babies and why it's important is very important for anyone who likes horses.\n\nWords to Know:\n- Boy Horse: A boy horse used for making babies\n- Girl Horse: A girl horse used for making babies\n- Baby Horse: A new baby horse\n- Becoming Friends: How horses start to make a baby\n- Nice: How a horse acts", "source": "minipile", "s": 8, "len": 5362, "idx": 385062, "original text": "Well Jeff this one is a multiple stakes winner producer(and second dam of stakes horse too) and 3/4 and/or 1/2 to stakes winners and producers so I have been thinking about this,if I had any cash....or decent partners.But I am old and f..k the cancer who is draining my funds and energy.

I had a son of Dash to Fame for sale,so I advertised:\"colt by Dash to Fame...\"I got letters asking who his sire was,I answered politely \"Dash to Fame\" next question was \"yes but what son of Dash to Fame is the sire\"???\nSo for those reasons I figured that just saying she was a daughter of Dash for Cash might not be precise enough\n\n_________________The sport and industry survive not only because of the champions that are remembered forever but also because of the losers that are so easy to forget...\n\nNo it does not mean or add anything,it should not be there...I put that for idiots or people that cannot read...I sold hundred of horses and got stupid questions by the dozens,never thought of being a smart ass with clients.They don't know any better,it is okay as long as I make the sale and the horse gets out allright..Why start an argument???\n\na joke: may be she was adopted???\n\n_________________The sport and industry survive not only because of the champions that are remembered forever but also because of the losers that are so easy to forget...\n\nRegistered Name- CATCH ME IF U CAN\nThis beautiful Mare is an off spring from DASH FOR CASH\nShe has accomplished 120 days training spread over the course of 7 months, and is still in training.

She has a lot of forward and has an inclination to be competitive (would be highly suited to barrels!), also she is very intelligent, and that she can be very confident with a suited rider. She is fantastic on trail rides on a loose rein in a plain rope hackamore and is very adaptable to whatever you ask of her. Highly recommend an experienced rider who has patience and time for a younger horse.\n\n_________________The sport and industry survive not only because of the champions that are remembered forever but also because of the losers that are so easy to forget...\n\nPersonally I find the Quarter Horse breeding jargon just hilarious. For example, they would say that Silvie's mare is \"outta Dash for Cash\" when, for heaven's sake, a horse can only be out of its dam. Sylvie's mare is an \"own daughter of Dash for Cash\" - as opposed a \"daughter of Dash for Cash\" with the horse somewhere in the four generations on her papers? It seems like the terminology is just so much snake oil.\n\nThe closest I have seen in TB's in similar advertising is \"granddaughter of Secretariat\" or \"grandson of Northern Dancer\" which is actually true about those horses, no matter how meaningless it might be in relation to the horse's actual pedigree.\n\nI have seen,and you can too just look at the internet ads: Dash for Cash horse for sale(he must be somewhere WAY back) or 1/2 brother (when by same sire) or family of SO and SO when it is a distant parent...(that from TB people).I tried once to explain that to a \"breeder\",anything further than second generation for me is of no consequences...If both \"parents\" and grandparents\" were useless chances are...\nYou see my real father was a jewish mine prospector...I am claustrophobic,my adoptiveefather was an accountant...look at my bank account you will see right away what I mean... so when you talk about distant relatives...like a racehorse 4 generations away,I don't think it is a good bet....but as I always say: all told>your gold....\n\n_________________The sport and industry survive not only because of the champions that are remembered forever but also because of the losers that are so easy to forget...\n\nI understand exactly what you mean by own daughter, it means its a daughter and not a grandaughter or great grandaughter, it's a quite common usage of the word. It's hard.to fatham that a moderator on this forum would coin it 'snake oil'.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Fun Music\n\nIntroduction:\nFun music is a type of music that came from African AM country people in NO city, US country, a long, long time ago. It has its own special way of being played, with lots of different sounds coming from things like saxophones, trumpets, pianos, and big string instruments. In this lesson, we will learn about the history of fun music, what makes it special, and how to enjoy listening to it.\n\nSection 1: History of Fun Music\n\n**Learning:** Fun music started with African AM country people in NO city a long, long time ago. It was inspired by African sounds, blues music, ragtime, and band music. Fun music became well-liked in the old days and has been loved in many places around the world.\n\n**Doing:** Listen to the song \"What Is This?\" by Louis. This song was recorded a long time ago and is an example of old fun music. Try to hear the tune, the beat, and the different sounds.\n\nSection 2: What Makes Fun Music Special\n\n**Learning:** Fun music is special because of a few things. These include making up music on the spot, having a fun beat, blue sounds, and using different sounds. Making up music on the spot is when musicians make music right in the moment. A fun beat makes the music sound happy and makes you want to dance. Blue sounds are sounds that are played a bit lower, which makes the music sound bluesy. Fun music also uses different sounds like saxophones, trumpets, pianos, and big string instruments.\n\n**Doing:** Listen to the song \"So What\" by Matthew. This song is an example of new fun music. Try to hear how the music is made up on the spot, the fun beat, and the blue sounds.\n\nSection 3: Enjoying Fun Music\n\n**Learning:** To enjoy fun music, you need to understand its pattern and shape. Fun music songs usually follow a pattern called the AABA pattern. The A part is the tune, while the B part is the bridge. The song usually plays the A part again before it ends. Fun music also uses different ways of making sounds and beats to make interesting and tricky rhythms.\n\n**Doing:** Listen to the song \"My Favorite Things\" by Jack. This song is an example of fun music with complicated tunes and melodies. Try to hear the pattern, shape, and the way the sounds and beats are used in the song.\n\nGlossary:\n- Making up music on the spot: When musicians make music right in the moment.\n- Fun beat: A beat that makes the music sound happy and makes you want to dance.\n- Blue sounds: Sounds that are played a bit lower, which makes the music sound bluesy.\n- Song pattern: Jazz songs have a special form where the tune repeats and then changes.\n\nIn this lesson, we learned about jazz music. We listened to different types of jazz music and talked about its parts.

{"text": "Making stuff stick together: When we want things to stick together, we sometimes use a special kind of sticky stuff. We need to be careful with the temperature when we use it, so it doesn't get too hot. We can use things like lamps or hairdryers to help it get just right, but we need to make sure it doesn't get too hot and hurt something.\n\nThere are other ways to make the sticky stuff work faster. We can add certain things to it, like when we mix different things in our playdough to make it softer or harder. We can also make it less thick, which makes it easier to spread and stick things together.\n\nAll in all, making things stick together needs us to think about a few things: what we're using to stick things, the temperature, and what we add to our sticky stuff. When we know these things, we can make stuff stick together better and faster.\n\nGlossary:\n- Sticky stuff: Something we use to make things stick together.\n- Making it work: The process of making the sticky stuff do its job.\n- Heat: The warmth we can feel.\n- Mixing: When we add different things together.\n- Less thick: Not as heavy or hard to move.\n\nConclusion:\nLearning about the things that make a play dough mixture dry quickly is very important for making the process better and getting quicker, better results.

There is no simple, generally applicable answer, however a number of simple guidelines are available that can substantially help realize the desired objective of increasing productivity by optimizing greater cure speed. First of all, we must be cognizant of the fact that cure speed depends upon quite a number of interrelated variables. These include specifics of the polymer composition\u2019s ingredients, the amount of the compound employed, substrate identification and characterization, application and cure temperatures, time factors, as well as exposure to environmental conditions ranging from aggressive chemicals to mechanical shock and vibration. The following comments should help one arrive at practical, useful solutions.\nFirst of all, it must be kept in mind that the process of curing one or two component polymeric bonding, sealing or encapsulation compounds involves an exothermic, heat emitting reaction. This applies to epoxies, polysulfides, phenolics, polyimides and most urethanes, as well as many other high molecular weight species. The greater the physical amount of the reactants employed, the larger the amount of heat evolved during the curing process. The reverse is true as well: the smaller the quantity of reactants, the lesser amount of heat is evolved. Obviously, the greater the amount of heat evolved, the faster the curing reaction and vice versa. Care must be taken to limit the quantities of reactants in order to avoid building up a reaction temperature which could deleteriously affect other heat sensitive components of the assembly. Cure speed is inversely proportional to reaction time and directly proportional to temperature. For every 20\u00b0F (~10\u00b0C), the rate of cure is typically enhanced by as much as 20-25%.\nTo illustrate these phenomena, a typical epoxy adhesive with a 50 mil thick bonding layer will cure much faster than a 3 or 5 mil thick bond. A 3 mil layer may require 40-72 hours at 75\u00b0F to obtain a suitable cure state versus 8-12 hours for the thicker layer of epoxy adhesive. Cure of a 1 inch thick shape could well be achieved within 3-4 hours. Increasing the temperature will have the same effect as increasing the amount to be cured. This temperature increase is a simple yet powerful accelerant of the rate of cure. It must be emphasized that quantities of less than 1-2 grams are quite difficult to cure fully even at elevated temperatures. Special technologies are required to obtain adequate cures of such small quantities.\nIt is generally not recommended to increase the amount of curing agent for the purpose of enhancing the cure rate. Instructions from the manufacturer as listed on the appropriate technical data sheets should be followed carefully. Given a choice, a moderate increase in the curing temperature by only 20-30\u00b0F is projected to reduce the cure time by as much as 20-30%. It can be a preferred choice for increasing cure speed in many applications. Technical contact with the manufacturer is recommended to resolve any questions. Master Bond Inc. has experienced technical personnel who would be glad to help if enhanced cure rates are desirable for more cost effective production.", "hash": "d28ff74c6a806f7f39f300d4b9eced42a36811e3c5b14e29d4c27cdde3204736"}
{"text": "Lesson: Understanding Averages in Friendly Groups\n\n### Introduction\n\nIn this lesson, we will learn about averages in friendly groups. We will talk about different kinds of averages and how they can be the same or different. We will also share a story where they don't end up the same.\n\n### What are these words?\n\nLet's think of a friendly group as a big family. Now, every family member can have something they like or dislike. We can think of this as a game. For example, everyone can have their favorite ice cream flavor. We call these flavors as \"functions\". Now, we want to find the most liked flavor or the \"average\" flavor. We can find this average in different ways. We can find it by asking everyone in the family (this is like $L$), or we can find it by asking the younger ones or the older ones (this is like $R$ and $I$).\n\n### What are we going to learn?\n\n1. Different Kinds of Averages\n\nWe will start by understanding what an average is. Imagine we have a big family, and we ask everyone their favorite ice cream flavor. Then we see which flavor is liked the most. This is what we call an average. But remember, we can also ask only the older ones or the younger ones. This can also give us an average.\n\n2. How are these averages related?\n\nSometimes, the most liked flavor by everyone in the family, by the older ones, and by the younger ones can all be the same. But this may not always be the case. We will learn more about this.\n\n3. A Special Story\n\nWhile these averages can be the same for most families, they can also be different in some families. We will share one such family story where this happens. Let's think about a group of numbers. All the numbers in this group are the same. But if we try to find the average of these numbers, we will not get the same answer every time. This shows that sometimes things are not always the same.\n\n### Ending\n\nIn this lesson, we learned about averages. We talked about how sometimes averages can be different. We also gave an example to show this. Understanding averages can help us with many different problems.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 701, "idx": 318079, "original text": "Q:\n\nLeft mean values vs right mean values\n\nLet $G$ be a countable amenable group and $f\\in\\ell^\\infty(G)$.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Cars\n\n### Part 1: What is a Car?\n\nA car is a thing that can move by itself. It can take people or things from one place to another. Cars are very important in our world. They have changed the way we travel and talk to each other. In this lesson, we will learn about the history of cars, their parts, and how they work.\n\n### Part 2: The Story of Cars\n\nThe first cars were made a long time ago. They used steam to move and were very expensive and hard to use. But later, the first car that used gas was made. This made cars cheaper and easier for everyone to use. Since then, cars have kept getting better, with new technology making them safer, faster, and better for the environment.\n\n### Part 3: Parts of a Car\n\nA car has many different parts. Each part has a special job. Some of the most important parts of a car include:\n\n- Engine: This is the part of the car that makes it move. It changes fuel into motion, which makes the car go.\n- Transmission: This is the part that takes power from the engine to the wheels. It lets the car change speeds.\n- Brakes: These are the parts that let the car slow down and stop. They change moving energy into heat, which then goes away.\n- Suspension: This is the part that lets the car handle bumps and shocks while driving. It keeps the car steady and comfy.\n- Wheels and tires: These are the parts that connect the car to the road. The wheels go round and round on a stick, which helps the car to turn. The tires help the car to stick to the road and make the ride smoother.\n\n### Part 4: How Cars Work\n\nCars work by changing fuel into movement. It starts with the engine, where fuel is mixed with air and squeezed. This mix is then set on fire, causing a small boom that makes force. This force is moved to the gear changer, which then powers the wheels and makes the car move.\n\n### Part 5: Real Life\n\nLet's think of a real life thing. Imagine you need to go from your house to your work, which is 10 miles away. You start the car and push on the gas pedal, which tells the engine to use more fuel. The engine does this by mixing air and fuel in the right amount and squeezing it. The spark makers then set the mix on fire, creating a small boom that moves the pistons, which in turn spins the spinny stick. The spinny stick's spinning is moved to the gear changer, which then powers the wheels, making the car move forward. As you drive, the brakes help you to slow down and stop at red lights, while the bouncy bits take any bumps in the road.\n\n### Word List\n\n- Engine: The part of the car that makes it move, changing fuel into movement.\n- Gear Changer: The part that moves power from the engine to the wheels, helping the car to change speeds.\n- Brakes: The parts that help the car to slow down and stop, changing moving energy into heat.\n- Bouncy Bits: The parts that help the car to take bumps in the road, keeping the car still and comfy.\n- Wheels and Tires: The parts that connect the car to the road, helping it to turn and stick to the road.\n\n### The End\n\nIn this lesson, we have learned the simple bits of cars, from their story to their different parts and how they work.

{"text": "Story: Getting to Know a Strange Illness\n\nStart:\nThere is a strange illness that makes people get clots in their blood easily. This can cause big problems like a block in a blood vessel because of a clot, or problems in pregnancy. In this story, we will learn about this strange illness.\n\nPart 1: Learning About the Illness\n\nThis strange illness is caused by things called proteins that the body makes by mistake. These proteins attack fats that are found in the outside layer of cells and other parts of the body. There are three kinds of these proteins. Sometimes, our body makes things that can stick to other things in our body and cause problems. \n\nPart 2: Finding out about these sticky things\n\nTo find out if someone has these sticky things, doctors look for them in the blood. They use a special test to see if they are there. But, there isn't just one test that can say for sure if someone has them, because sometimes they might be there one day and not the next. So, doctors have to look at other things too, like how the person is feeling and what other tests say.\n\nPart 3: How to help people with these sticky things\n\nThere isn't a way to make the sticky things go away completely, but there are ways to help stop problems from happening. These ways include:\n\n1. Special medicine: These can help stop the sticky things from making problems. Some examples are medicines called 'heparin' and 'warfarin'.\n2. Tiny aspirin: Some doctors say that a small aspirin can help stop problems from happening.\n3. Looking after women who want to have a baby: Women who have the sticky things and want to have a baby might need to see a special doctor who looks after women having babies, to make sure they and their babies are okay.\n\nTo finish:\nIn this lesson, we learned about the sticky things, why they happen, how we find out about them, and what we can do to help.

A leader must own up to what they do, say sorry for mistakes, and learn from them. In this lesson, we will learn about owning up and why it matters in leading. We will also talk about how leaders can grow this quality and use it in their work.\n\nPart 1: What is Owning Up?\n\nOwning up means we understand that what we do, think, and feel is up to us. It means we accept what happens when we choose, and fix any mistakes we make. A leader who owns up is ready to say when they're wrong, say sorry if needed, and make things right when they make a mistake.\n\nPart 2: Why is Owning Up Important in Leading?\n\nOwning up is key in leading because it helps leaders earn trust from their friends. When a leader owns up to their mistakes, it shows that they are honest and ready to learn from their slip-ups. This earns trust and respect from friends, making it easier for the leader to guide well.\n\nPart 3: How Can Leaders Grow Owning Up?\n\nLeaders can grow owning up by doing these things:\n\n1. Think about what they do: Leaders should think about what they do and choose often to understand what they could have done differently.\n\n2. Say sorry when needed: Leaders should say sorry truly when they make slip-ups or hurt others.\n\n3. Fix mistakes: Leaders should fix any mistakes they make and stop the same slip-ups from happening later.\n\n4. Ask for thoughts: Leaders should ask their friends for their thoughts to understand how what they do might affect others.\n\nPart 4: Using Owning Up in Leading\n\nLeaders can use owning up in their work by:\n\n1. Owning up to tasks: Leaders should take charge of their tasks and make sure they are done the best they can.\n\n2. Say when they make mistakes: Leaders should be honest about their slip-ups and fix them.\n\n3. Learn from slip-ups: Leaders should learn from their slip-ups and use what they learn to get better at leading.\n\n4. Earn trust from friends: Leaders should earn trust from their friends by owning up to their mistakes, saying sorry when needed, and fixing mistakes.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBeing responsible for what you do is very important if you want to be a good leader. When leaders take care of what they do, they can make friends and lead well. Leaders can become more responsible by doing things like thinking about what they do, saying sorry when they need to, and fixing mistakes. By being responsible in their work, leaders can get better at leading and do really well.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1448, "idx": 268517, "original text": "Hillary Clinton is blaming everyone else but herself for her election loss to President Trump, but former Clinton pollster Doug Schoen says this is her way of gearing up for another run.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEven if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in only in her own mind\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 she is running,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Schoen told the FOX Business Network\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Stuart Varney.\n\nThe longtime Democrat who worked for President Bill Clinton between 1994 and 2000 said Hillary \u00e2\u0080\u009cmade it very clear\u00e2\u0080\u0099 at an event last week that \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back in the game,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but pointed out how her lack of self-responsibility for campaign mistakes is alarming.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis speech at Wellesley where she said she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s joining up with the resistance\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blaming everybody\u00e2\u0080\u0094it startles me she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t blame herself.

{"text": "Lesson: Let's Learn About Music!\n\n## Part 1: Easy Music Stuff\n\nIn this part, we are going to learn about easy music stuff like notes, scales, and beats. We will also learn about some music signs and what they mean.\n\n### First Thing: Notes and Scales\n\n**Notes** are the small parts that make up music. They show the sound of a song and are shown by letters A, B, C, D, E, and F. Each note has a number that tells us where it is on the staff (five lines). For example, the note C is shown by the letter C and has a number of 0, while the note G is shown by the letter G and has a number of 5.\n\n**Scales** are groups of notes that are played in a certain order. There are many types of scales, but the most common ones are happy and sad. Happy scales are usually happy or fun, while sad scales are usually sad or not happy.\n\n### Second Thing: Beats\n\n**Beats** talk about the pattern of beats in a song. Each beat is shown by a sign called a **note value**, which can be a whole note, half note, quarter note, or eighth note, among others. These note values tell us how long each beat is, which tells us how fast or slow the song is.\n\n### Third Thing: Music Signs\n\n**Music signs** are used to show different parts of music, like how fast or slow the song is, how loud or soft the song is, and how the notes are played. Some common signs include:\n\n- **Speed**: Shown by the word \"speed\" followed by a number. For example, \"fast\" means fast, while \"slow\" means slow.\n- **Loud or Soft**: Shown by words like \"soft\" or \"loud\", or by signs that show getting louder or getting softer.\n- **How to Play Notes**: Shown by signs that tell us to play a note longer, to play a note louder, or to play a note shorter.\n\n## Part 2: More Music Stuff\n\nIn this part, we are going to learn more about music, including more about scales.\n\n### Topic 4: Sounds Together\n\n**Sounds Together** means when we sing or play three or more sounds at the same time. There are many types of sounds together, but the ones we hear a lot are happy sounds, sad sounds, and soft sounds. Happy sounds make us feel good, while sad sounds can make us feel a bit down.\n\n### Topic 5: Sound Distance\n\n**Sound Distance** is about how far apart two sounds are. We can measure this by counting the little steps between the two sounds. The most common sound distances are when we have two sounds played or sung at the same time, when we have eight sounds played or sung at the same time, and when we have two sounds played or sung at the same time that are four little steps apart.\n\n### Topic 6: Sound Steps\n\nWe already talked about Sound Steps before, but now we will learn more about how they are built and used in songs. Sound Steps can be happy, sad, or a mix of both. Happy Sound Steps have a bright sound, while sad Sound Steps have a soft sound. Sound Steps help to create tunes and sounds together in songs.\n\n## Section 3: More About Songs\n\nIn this part, we will learn more about songs, including special Sound Steps, tunes together, and making songs.\n\n### Topic 7: Special Sound Steps\n\n**Special Sound Steps** are like normal Sound Steps, but they start on a different sound. There are seven Special Sound Steps in the songs we often hear: Big Happy, Little Happy, Quiet, Very Bright, Bright Happy, Soft Happy, and Very Quiet. Each Special Sound Step has a special sound and is used in different kinds of songs.\n\n### Topic 8: Tunes Together\n\n**Tunes Together** means when we put two or more tunes together at the same time. It can be hard to do, but it makes the song very beautiful. We often hear Tunes Together in old songs and it's something every song maker should know how to do.\n\n### Topic 9: Making Songs\n\n**Making Songs** is when we make our own song. We choose the right sounds, sounds together, and Sound Steps, and put them together in a nice and fun way. Making Songs can be hard, but also very fun. It needs good ideas, knowing how to use sounds, and understanding songs.\n\nWord List:\n- **Beat Length**: A sign that shows how long each beat in a song is.\n- **Speed**: How fast a song is, shown by words like \"fast\" or \"slow,\" or by a number that tells us how many beats in a minute.\n- **Loud and Quiet**: How loud or soft a sound is, shown by words like \"soft\" or \"loud,\" or by signs that show getting louder or getting softer.\n- **How to Play or Sing**: The way we play or sing a sound, shown by signs that mean hold, emphasis, or short.\n- **Gap**: The space between two sounds, measured by how many small steps are between them.\n- **Happy tune**: A tune that begins with the sound C and makes you feel happy.\n- **Sad tune**: A tune that begins with the sound A and makes you feel sad.\n- **Type of tune**: A kind of tune that starts with a different sound than the happy or sad tunes.\n- **Mixing sounds**: The skill of putting two or more tunes together at the same time.\n- **Making a song**: The fun of making a piece of music by picking the right sounds, groups of sounds, and tunes, and putting them together in a fun and nice-sounding way.\n\nIn the end:\nIn this fun lesson, we learned about the basics of making music, including sounds, tunes, and rhythms. We also looked at some bigger ideas like groups of sounds, gaps, and tunes, as well as some big kid ideas like types of tunes, mixing sounds, and making a song. By knowing these ideas, we can make our own music and better understand the music around us.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 374, "idx": 259878, "original text": "For Bar 7 & 8, can you just do a variation of bar 3 & variation of bar 4?

We will see the good and bad of each trip, the things you can see, and which trip is best for you.\n\nSection 1: Learning about the Trips\n\n**Big Car Trip:** A big car trip is a guided trip that takes place in a big car. These trips are usually led by a smart guide who shares facts about the past, place, and animals of the island. Big car trips often go off the path, letting visitors see the rough land of CI island.\n\n**Big Truck Trip:** A big truck trip is like a big car trip, but it happens in a big truck. These trips also have smart guides who share facts about the island. However, big truck trips tend to be more fancy, with comfy seats and cool air.\n\nSection 2: Good and Bad of Each Trip\n\n**Big Car Trip:**\n- Good: Gives a more rough and fun experience\n- Bad: Can be bumpy and loud\n- Sights: More wild areas of the island, including animals and natural landmarks\n\n**Big Truck Trip:**\n- Good: Comfy and cool vehicles, smoother ride\n- Bad: Not many off-road paths\n- Sights: Like big car trips, but may not include as many wild areas\n\nSection 3: Which Trip is Right for You?\n\n- If you like a smoother ride and are not interested in off-road fun, a big truck trip may be right for you.\n- If you like a more rough experience and want to see wild areas of the island, a big car trip may be a better fit.\n- Think about what you like and what makes you comfy when picking between the two trips.\n\nIn the end:\nBoth car trips give fun times on Cat Island. By knowing what's different between the two trips, you can pick the best trip for you. Don't forget to think about things like being comfy, seeing cool things, and going off-road.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning about Building with Layers\n\n## Section 1: What is Building with Layers?\nIn this lesson, we will learn about building with layers, also known as stacking things up. Building with layers is when you make something by adding one piece on top of another until your thing is finished. \n\n## Section 2: How does Building with Layers Work?\nBuilding with layers works by using a machine that heats up a special string that melts into a soft layer. The machine puts down layers of this soft material, which gets hard as it cools down. Each layer is a little bit bigger than the one before it, making the thing you are building bigger and bigger. \n\n## Section 3: Different Types of Layer Building Machines\nThere are different types of machines that can build with layers, including some that use a heated string, some that use a light to harden a liquid, and some that use a laser to harden a powder. Different types of special printers make 3D things. They use different stuff and ways to make 3D things.\n\n## Part 4: Making 3D Models\nTo make a 3D model, you can use a computer tool or a 3D picture-taker. Once you have your model, you can put it into a layer-maker program. This program changes your model into many layers that the printer can understand.\n\n## Part 5: Fixing Common Problems\nIf your 3D printed thing comes out wrong, there may be some reasons why.

{"text": "Story: Learning about New People Coming to a Country\n\n**Let's Start**\n\nIn this story, we will learn about how new people come to a country. We will talk about a big rule from 2014, which says house owners have to check if the new people living in their house are allowed to be in the country. We will also talk about the important papers needed and what happens if they are not given.\n\n**Part 1: Learning about New People Coming to a Country**\n\nNew people coming to a country has to do with rules about people moving from one country to another. In the UK, the government decides these rules and the Home Office carries them out. The big rule from 2014 was made to talk about new people coming to the country and how it affects the country's money and people.\n\n**Part 2: The Big Rule from 2014**\n\nThe big rule from 2014 was made in December 2014. It has many parts that aim to limit new people coming to the country and make it harder for people to live and work in the UK without the right approval. One of the main parts of the rule is that house owners have to check if the new people living in their house are allowed to be in the country.\n\n**Part 3: Checking if New People are Allowed in the Country**\n\nIn a rule from long ago, the people who have houses must check if the people they are giving their house to are allowed to stay in the NE city. This means that before giving someone their house, they must see real things that show the person is allowed to stay in the NE city. These things include papers with pictures, cards with names, and special papers. The people with houses cannot take copies of these things or have someone else give them these things.\n\n**Part 4: What Happens if You Don't Give the Things**\n\nIf a person does not give proof that they are allowed to stay in the NE city, the person with the house may not be able to give them the house. This could mean the person has no house or even has to deal with the rules.\n\n**Part 5: Words to Know**\n\n- **Moving rule:** The rules about people moving from one place to another.\n- **Rule from long ago:** A rule made in the NE city long ago to talk about people moving and what it does to the city.\n- **Allowed-to-Stay:** A thing under the Rule from long ago for people with houses to check if the people they are giving their house to are allowed to stay in the NE city.\n- **Paper with picture:** A thing given by the city to show a person's name and where they are from.\n- **Card with name:** A thing given by the city to show a person's name and where they are from.\n- **Special paper:** A thing given by the city to let a person come and stay in the city for a specific thing and time.\n\n**The End**\n\nIn this story, we learned about the basic moving rule in the NE city and the Rule from long ago. We learned about the things needed to check if a person is allowed to stay and what happens if they don't give the necessary things. By knowing these things, we can better understand the hard world of moving rules and make sure we follow the rules.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 8, "len": 571, "idx": 242896, "original text": "The Immigration Act 2014 was introduced in December 2014.

{"text": "Story: Learning about Flying Toys\n\n## Part 1: Idea\nFlying toys, also called toys that fly by themselves, are toys that can fly alone or be controlled from far away. They have become more popular because they can do things that are hard or scary for us to do. In this story, we will learn about flying toys, what they are made of, and how they are used in different jobs like farming, looking at the world, and helping when bad things happen.\n\n## Chapter 2: Learning Time\n1. What is a flying toy?\nA flying toy is a little machine that can fly by itself or be moved around from far away.\n\n2. What makes up a flying toy?\nThe parts of a flying toy include the main body, spinning parts, little energy boxes, a guiding system, and feeling parts.\n\n3. What can flying toys do?\nFlying toys can be used for helping grow plants, watching the outdoors, helping when bad things happen, taking pictures, and bringing things from one place to another.\n\n4. How does a flying toy work?\nA flying toy works by using its feeling parts to know where it is and how high it is, and then changing the spinning parts to stay balanced and move. It can also be moved around from far away by a person using a remote.\n\n5. What is good about using flying toys?\nSome good things about using flying toys are that they can go places that are hard for people to get to, pick up information and pictures, and do things that are hard or take a long time for people to do.\n\n## Chapter 3: Real Stories\nLet's think about how flying toys can be used to watch the outdoors. People who study the world can use flying toys to see what is happening to ice mountains in the far north because of weather changes. By moving flying toys over the ice mountains, they can get information about the heat of the sea water and the ice, and take pictures to understand and guess changes in the outdoors. This information can help people who study the world make smart choices on how to slow down the effects of weather changes.\n\n## Picture Book\n- Flying toy: A little machine that can fly by itself or be moved around from far away.\n- Unmanned flying toy: The same as a flying toy.\n- Feeling parts: Things that can feel changes in the outdoors and tell other electronic parts.\n- Height: How high something is above the sea or the ground.\n- Guiding system: A part that guides the movement of a flying toy.\n- Picture-taking: The job or fun of taking and making pictures.\n- Help for bad times: Help given to people who have had a bad thing happen, like a big storm or earth shake.\n\n## Wrapping Up\nIn this lesson, we learned about the simple ideas of flying toys, their parts, and what they can do in different areas. We also thought about an example of how flying toys can be used to watch the outdoors to see what weather changes are doing to ice mountains in the far north. By knowing how flying toys work and their real uses, we can use these skills for new problems and fun things in the future.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 746, "idx": 30810, "original text": "Italian Research Council drones to study Arctic glaciers.

In this lesson, we will learn the parts of a book story and how to look at them well.\n\nPart 1: Knowing the Structure of a Book Story\n\nA book story usually has some main parts that help you know if the book is good to read. These parts are:\n\n- Name: The name of the story usually tells you the place where the story was shared. This can help if you want to find more stories about the same book.\n- Person: The person of the story is usually a helper or a storyteller who has read the book and is sharing their thoughts on it.\n- Place: The place of the story is the place that shared the story. This can help if you want to find more stories about the same book.\n- Time: The time of the story tells you when the story was shared. This can help if you want to find stories about the same book shared at different times.\n- Name of the Book: The name of the book being talked about is usually said at the start of the story. This is important because it tells you what the story is about.\n- Short Story: A short story is a quick talk about the book's story or idea. It can help you choose if the book is something you would like to read.\n\nPart 2: Looking at the Content of a Book Story\n\nOnce you know the structure of a book story, you can start looking at the content. Here are some things to look for:\n\n- Start: The start of the story should give you an idea of what the storyteller thought of the book. Did they like it? Did they not like it? Did they not care?\n- Short Talk: The short talk should give you a quick look at the book's story or idea. This can help if you want to know more about the book before you decide to read it.\n- Talk: The talk is where the storyteller shares their thoughts on the book. They may talk about the way of writing, the characters, the story, or any other part of the book. This is where you can really know if the book is good to read.\n- End: The end is where the storyteller finishes their thoughts on the book.

It can cause changes in how parts of a cell act, even though it doesn't change the cell's instructions. In this story, we will learn how E can help A grow back in the brain.\n\nChapter 1: What is A Growing Back?\nA growing back is when the parts of a nerve that were hurt or cut off grow back and connect with the cells they are supposed to talk to. This is very important for getting better after a hurt brain.\n\nChapter 2: Why is A Growing Back Important?\nA growing back is super important for getting better from a hurt brain because it lets the brain cells talk to each other again. Without this, the harm from a hurt brain could last forever, and could make someone very sick or even die.\n\nChapter 3: How does E help A Grow Back?\nE plays a big role in helping A grow back by controlling how cells act. \n\nChapter 4: What is the ER signal in A Growing Back?\nThe ER signal is a message that is very important for how cells act when A is growing back. \n\nChapter 5: How does E help A Grow Back?\nE helps A grow back by controlling how important parts of a cell act. \n\nChapter 6: Why is this story important?\nThis story is important because it helps us understand how A grows back in the brain. By finding out that E is very important for this, scientists can now look for new ways to help A grow back in people with hurt brains.\n\nThe End:\nIn short, changes caused by E, especially changes that involve E, play a very important role in helping A grow back in the brain. Understanding how this works can help scientists find new ways to treat hurt brains and make patients better.\n\nWords to Know:\n- E: something that scientists study. It can cause changes in how parts of a cell act, even though it doesn't change the cell's instructions.\n- Magic painter: a worker who adds a bright star to a picture, which can make the picture look different.\n- Backward message: a pathway that travels from the end of long strings back to the center, where it makes the picture look different.\n- Big star: magic painter's big star.\n- Making pictures: the way by which a drawing from a sketchbook is used to make a real picture.\n- Growing again: the way by which broken or cut strings grow back and connect with their end points again.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1250, "idx": 221156, "original text": "PCAF-dependent epigenetic changes promote axonal regeneration in the central nervous system.\nAxonal regenerative failure is a major cause of neurological impairment following central nervous system (CNS) but not peripheral nervous system (PNS) injury. Notably, PNS injury triggers a coordinated regenerative gene expression programme. However, the molecular link between retrograde signalling and the regulation of this gene expression programme that leads to the differential regenerative capacity remains elusive. Here we show through systematic epigenetic studies that the histone acetyltransferase p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) promotes acetylation of histone 3 Lys 9 at the promoters of established key regeneration-associated genes following a peripheral but not a central axonal injury. Furthermore, we find that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-mediated retrograde signalling is required for PCAF-dependent regenerative gene reprogramming. Finally, PCAF is necessary for conditioning-dependent axonal regeneration and also singularly promotes regeneration after spinal cord injury. Thus, we find a specific epigenetic mechanism that regulates axonal regeneration of CNS axons, suggesting novel targets for clinical application.", "hash": "11b3aacb158a3578a9b3c7c7bd63549f6137b00cc3f4b601a39a50177936421a"}

We will learn about these different things and how they make the fruit fly live longer or shorter.\n\nSection 1: What are These Things?\nThere are special things that can help reduce swelling in our bodies. They can help us when we have sicknesses like aching joints, hard time breathing, and other illnesses that cause swelling. There are different kinds of these things.\n\nSection 2: How These Things Affect the Life of Flies\nA study on fruit flies found that a certain thing made them live almost 11% longer when it was given to them for their whole adult life. All other things made the flies live either shorter or the same length of time. One particular thing caused the flies to live about 33% shorter when they were raised on it, and about 12% shorter when it was given to them only in their adult life. At small amounts, all of the things were not harmful to the flies.\n\nSection 3: Why Did Some Things Make the Flies Live Shorter?\nWe are not sure why some things made the fruit flies live shorter. It's possible that these things might have been harmful to the flies if given in large amounts or at certain times in their lives. It's also possible that the flies were not doing well with the specific kind of thing used in the study.\n\nConclusion:\nTo sum up, this lesson taught us about how different things can change the life of fruit flies. We learned that one thing made the flies live longer, while other things made them live either shorter or the same length of time. We also talked about why these changes might happen and why it's important to understand how these things can affect different creatures.\n\nGlossary:\n- Fruit fly: A tiny bug often used for studying.\n- Special things: Stuff that can reduce swelling in the body.\n- Happy Pills: They take away pain.\n- Super Power Pills: They help to make you strong.\n- Magic Drinks: They are made from things that are alive and they help to take away pain.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 911, "idx": 297133, "original text": "Influence of anti-inflammatory agents on the survival of Drosophila.\nVarious anti-inflammatory compounds were tested for their influence on the life span of the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster). 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid increased the median life span by 10.9% when fed to adults at a concentration of 1 X 10(-5)M for the entire adult life span.

{"text": "**Story: Truck Adventure**\n\n**Start**\n\nTruck adventure is about taking care of trucks and drivers to make sure things get to where they need to be. This means choosing the best roads, deciding when to send things, looking after trucks, and keeping an eye on where things are. In this story, we will learn why truck adventure is important, the tricky things about moving stuff, and how making things better can help.\n\n**Main Part**\n\n1. Why Truck Adventure is Important\n\nTruck adventure is very important for anyone who needs trucks to send things. It involves taking care of a truck from when it's new until it's old, including keeping it clean, making sure it has gas, and making sure the driver is okay. Good truck adventure can help save money, make customers happy, and help beat other businesses.\n\n2. Tricky Things About Moving Stuff\n\nMoving stuff can be hard and there are a few tricky things, like:\n\n- Choosing the best road: Making sure trucks go the shortest way to save time and gas.\n- Looking after trucks: Making sure trucks are clean and don't break down to avoid stopping.\n- Looking after drivers: Making sure drivers know how to drive safely and well.\n- Saving gas: Watching how much gas is used and trying to use less without making it unsafe or slow.\n- Keeping things safe: Making sure things don't fall off and that trucks are watched to stop people from stealing or breaking things.\n\n3. How Making Things Better Can Help\n\nMaking things better, like Lean Six Sigma, can help make moving stuff easier and improve truck adventure. Some good things about making things better include:\n\n- Saving money: By finding and stopping wasteful things in truck adventure, businesses can save money and make more money.\n- Making customers happy: By choosing the best roads and getting things there faster, businesses can make customers happy and keep them coming back.\n- Beating other businesses: By making truck adventure better, businesses can be better than others and get more customers.\n\n**Real Life Stories**\n\nLet's think about a business that sends things all over the place. They have trucks that they use to send things to people. To make their truck adventure better, they use a software that helps them choose the best roads for their trucks. This makes travel faster and uses less gas, which saves money and makes customers happy.\n\nThey also start a program to look after their trucks, making sure they are clean and don't break down on the road. This stops delays and makes sure things get there on time.\n\nAt last, they start a driver learning plan that makes sure their drivers know how to use cars safely and well. This makes less chance of accidents and makes the roads safer.\n\n**Ending**\n\nGood control of car groups is very important for any company that needs to move things. By using better ways of doing things, companies that move things and people can do better with their car groups and do well overall. By using real examples, like finding the best way to go and car fixing plans, companies can save money, make customers happy, and do better than others.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 827, "idx": 442576, "original text": "Ripples-FMS offers Scania integrated Fleet operations Management module as part of a logistics software solution to effectively handle end to end fleet operations management functions.

It is where plans get made, information is shared, history is preserved and art is created. Americans have long lamented that each generation takes less and less care of the mother tongue. That concern is valid. Limited language skills means a limited life.\n\nBut the concern about the quality of language should go beyond English. A culture's language is a storehouse of identity. Teachers claim that is why so many American Indians struggle in school. The words they are made to speak are not their own.\n\nThat's why the Utah State Board of Education is asking for $275,000 to preserve and revitalize Utah's indigenous languages. Studies have shown that using American Indian languages to instruct American Indians enhances learning. The money will be used to work with the San Juan and Uintah School District Utes in the early going. Other tribes would be added to the program later.\n\nEven without the practical and educational value of preserving Indian languages, just the fact they have been a vital component of a segment of humanity merits the money. We help preserve petroglyphs created by the ancients. We help preserve and protect crafts and villages. Preserving their languages is the obvious next step.\n\nWhat's more, American Indian culture isn't important only for American Indians. By preserving native tongues, all Americans benefit. Each culture \u0097 each language \u0097 adds a hue to the portrait of what it means to be human.\n\nIn San Juan County, for instance, the early White Mesa Utes were called Fancy Talkers by the Paiutes. The Southern Ute name for the San Juan River was \"River flowing from the sunrise.\" Spring was \"Green grass appearing\" and fall was called \"When doves sound soft.\" Their imaginative words were breathtakingly beautiful. An early tale tells of Jesus himself dropping down into the path of some homeward bound Utes. The name they gave him was: \"He who leaves footprints of light.\"\n\nSuch poetry should not be lost. And if young Ute students can find a degree of identity, confidence and connection from turning to their native tongues, all the better.", "hash": "b76399078aba181b69ebfe6d58b1a1af7ea4495bf07f5d3d25a4f1840385bb56"}
{"text": "Story: All About Helping Groups\n\n**Story Start**\n\nHelping groups are teams that help for a special reason without getting things in return. They use gifts, fun events, and special help to keep helping. In our story today, we will learn about the different types of helping groups, their plans, and how they work.\n\n**Chapter 1: Types of Helping Groups**\n\nThere are many different types of helping groups, each with its own special plan and goals. Some common types include:\n\n1. Helpers: These teams give help to people in need, like food, a place to stay, or health care.\n2. Givers: These teams usually focus on giving to other teams or plans that match with their plan.\n3. Learning groups: These teams give learning programs or things to help people learn and grow.\n4. Earth care teams: These teams work to keep the earth safe and keep everything in balance.\n5. Animal friends: These teams work to keep animals safe and make their lives better.\n\n**Chapter 2: Plans of Helping Groups**\n\nEach helping group has its own special plan that talks about its goals and purpose. Plans change a lot depending on the group's focus. For example, a helper might have a plan to give food and a place to stay to people without homes, while an earth care team might have a plan to lessen smoke in the air and talk about using clean energy.\n\n**Chapter 3: How Helping Groups Work**\n\nHelping groups work differently than businesses that want to get things in return. They do not want to get things in return, but rather to fulfill their plan. This means that they often use gifts, special help, and fun events to fund their work. They also have different leaders, with a team of guides who watch over the group's work and make sure that it stays true to its plan.\n\n**Chapter 4: Real Stories**\n\nLet's look at some real stories of helping groups and their plans:\n\n1. The Big Helpers: This team's plan is to give fast help to those who are hurt by big problems, like big storms or fires.\n2. The Health Helpers: This team gives health help to those hurt by fights and big problems in lands all over the earth.\n3. The Earth Friends: This team works to keep important earth parts and water all over the world safe.\n4. The Animal Friends: This team works to talk about being nice to animals and stopping people from being mean to animals.\n\n**Story End**\n\nIn the end, helping groups play an important part in our world by working for many different reasons and plans. By understanding how these groups work and what they do, we can better know their help and think about ways to help their work.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 800, "idx": 338723, "original text": "About ABRN.

This helps many people, like builders, engineers, and makers.\n\n### Section 2: Fun Example\nA fun example is making a wooden boat using a special tool. First, you design the boat on the computer. Then, the computer tells the tool how to make the boat. [PARAGRAPH]Finally, the router cuts the wood according to the G-code, resulting in a perfectly shaped boat.\n\nAnother example is using a 3D printer to create a prototype of a new product. The design is created in a 3D modeling software, such as SolidWorks or Fusion 360. The design is then exported as an STL file, which is loaded into the 3D printer software. The printer then lays down layers of material, such as plastic or metal, until the final prototype is created.\n\n### Section 3: Real-World Scenarios\nDigital modeling and fabrication are used in many industries, including automotive, aerospace, and construction. For example, a car manufacturer may use digital modeling to design a new car and then use a 3D printer to create prototypes of individual parts. These prototypes can be tested and refined before the final design is approved. In construction, digital modeling can be used to create accurate blueprints for buildings, reducing the risk of errors during construction.\n\n### Glossary\n- CNC: Computer Numeric Control\n- G-code: A set of instructions that control how a CNC machine moves\n- STL: Stereolithography, a 3D printing file format\n\n### Conclusion\nDigital modeling and fabrication are powerful tools that have transformed many industries.

{"text": "Lesson: Juice Making\n\n### Section 1: Basic Ideas\nJuice is a drink made from squished fruits. People have made juice for a very long time and many enjoy it everywhere. In this lesson, we will learn how juice is made, the different kinds of juice, and what makes some juice taste better than others.\n\n### Section 2: Simple Examples\nTo understand how juice is made, think about a juice maker who wants to make red juice from mixed berries. First, the berries are picked when they are just right. Next, the berries are squished to get the juice out. The juice is then put in a big container to turn the sugar into something that makes the juice taste different. After that, the juice sits in a special container to get more flavors. Last, the juice is put into bottles and gets even better before people drink it.\n\n### Section 3: Everyday Stories\nNow, think about a juice maker who wants to make white grape juice in a sunny place. The juice maker might use special containers that keep the juice fresh and tasty. To make the juice even better, it might sit in special containers for a little while. The juice maker might also mix a little bit of different juice to make the flavor better.\n\n### Little Word List\n- Picking: Getting the fruits ready.\n- Squishing: Making the fruits into juice.\n- Sitting: Letting the juice get better in containers.\n- Mixing: Putting different juices together.\n\n### Ending\nIn this lesson, we learned how juice is made, the different kinds of juice, and what makes some juice taste better. We also saw examples and everyday stories to show how juice makers decide what to do when making juice.

It's important because it lets everyone share what they like or don't like.\n\n**Part 2: Asking Questions**\n\nTo find out what people think, we ask many people the same questions. This helps us know what everyone might think. We can ask questions in different ways like on the phone, on the computer, or face-to-face.\n\n**Part 3: Looking at Answers**\n\nAfter asking questions, we see what the answers tell us. This helps us understand how many people like or don't like something. We also make sure our answers are right by checking if they could be a little bit different by mistake.\n\n**Part 4: People's Thoughts and Choices**\n\nWhat people think can really help leaders make choices. If most people like an idea, leaders might decide to do it.

{"text": "Lesson: Introduction to Supply and Demand\n\n### Section 1: Theoretical Concepts\n\nToday, we will talk about sharing and wanting. When people make things to share with others, like toys or cookies, we call this \"sharing.\" When people want to get something like a toy or a cookie, we call this \"wanting.\"\n\nHow sharing and wanting work together helps decide how many toys or cookies are there and how much they cost. If there are many toys to share, they might cost less. But if more kids want the same toy, it might cost more because it becomes special.\n\n### Section 2: Questions and Answers\n\n1. What is the difference between sharing and wanting?\nAnswer: Sharing is when people make things to give to others. Wanting is when people hope to get something they like.\n\n2. How do sharing and wanting decide how much toys or cookies cost?\nAnswer: When people share more toys or cookies, they might cost less. But if more kids want them, the price might go up because they are more special.\n\n3. What happens to the price of toys or cookies when there are more to share?\nAnswer: When there are more toys or cookies to share, they might cost less.\n\n4. What happens to the price of toys or cookies when more kids want them?\nAnswer: When more kids want the same toys or cookies, they might cost more because they are more special.\n\n### Section 3: Definitions and Examples\n\nSharing and wanting are ways to understand why there are certain amounts of things like toys and cookies and how much they cost. When people share more toys or cookies, the price may go down. But if more kids want them, the price may go up because they become more special.\n\nIn our story, imagine if there were many cookies to share, they might not cost much. But if all kids in class want those cookies, they might start to cost more because everyone thinks they are yummy.\n\n### Glossary\n- Sharing: Making things to give to others.\n- Wanting: Hoping to get something you like.\n- Special Price: The cost of something when it's wanted by many.\n\n### Understanding Supply and Demand\n\nKnowing about supply and demand helps us make good choices when we buy or sell things.

Conventionally, that condition has been treated by cutting out a portion of the affected organ wall. This procedure, however, may cause extensive discomfort to patients, and posed health risks. Recently, physicians have adopted a minimally invasive technique called endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), which removes the cancerous or abnormal tissues (polyps) or normal tissues, keeping the walls intact.\nEMR is generally performed with an endoscope, which is a long, narrow tube equipped with a light, video camera, and channels to receive other instruments. During EMR, the endoscope is passed down the throat or guided through the rectum to reach a tissue in the affected organ or otherwise targeted tissue. The distal end of the endoscope, further equipped with a cap that has a small wire loop, is guided towards the abnormality. Once there, a suction pump attached to the tube is started to draw the abnormality towards the endoscope cap. When the tissue is sufficiently drawn into the cap, the wire loop closes around the tissue, resecting it from the organ wall. Subsequently, excised tissue may be extracted by, e.g., the vacuum, for examination or disposal.\nCertain polyps, such as pedunculated polyps, may be characterized by a stalk attached to the mucosal layer. Drawing such polyps into the cap without drawing in any other tissue is readily accomplished. Certain other polyps, such as sessile polyps; however, may exhibit a broad base and they lay flat on the mucosal surface, devoid of a stalk. It is often difficult to grasp these polyps without drawing in a part of the muscularis layer.\nTo overcome this problem, saline solution is typically injected beneath the target tissue to raise the mucosal tissue and create a buffer layer. The raised tissue can then readily be severed with a resection loop, often in several segments (segmental resection) depending on the size and location of the tissue.\nIn addition, the depth of the cut made by the wire loop cautery is critical. As discussed above, if the cut is too deep, the muscularis layer may be injured, which may further cause a perforation. Conversely, a cut too shallow may not remove enough of the affected tissue and therefore may require additional procedures or worse, contribute to the development of metastatic cancer. Typically, more than 2 mm of cancerous tissue clearance is required to assure complete removal, EMR, as performed with conventional devices and methods, may result in complications such as perforation, bleeding, and/or strictures.\nTherefore, there exists a need for an improved endoscopic mucosal resection loop that effectively resects pedunculated and sessile polyps or other tissues without damaging the surrounding tissue or muscle layers of the organ.", "hash": "81fe3b848fc822faf821cc3a6a784bf4404b5d26f9c550e44d152fc2cb4859c9"}
{"text": "Title: Sending Messages with Pictures using Computer Commands\n\n## Chapter 1: Introduction\n\nSending messages with pictures using computer commands is a fun way to share photos using a computer. This guide will show you how to make and send these messages. We will learn about message types, how to add a picture, find out what type the file is, and make the picture ready for sending. By the end, you will know how to do this by yourself.\n\n## Chapter 2: Adding a Picture\n\nThe first thing to do when making a message is to choose the picture you want to send. You can pick any photo from your computer. For example, if you have a picture named \"photo.jpg\", you can prepare to send it with this simple step:\n\n```\nSay \"Here is my picture.\" and choose photo.jpg\n```\n\n## Chapter 3: Finding Out File Type\n\nNext, we need to find out the type of our picture file. We can use a simple command that tells us about the file. For instance, if your picture is \"photo.jpg\", you can check like this:\n\n```\nCheck type for photo.jpg\n```\n\nThis command will tell you what kind of file your photo is.\n\n## Chapter 4: Making the Picture Ready\n\nTo send the picture, we need to prepare it in a special way. We use a command that changes the picture so it can be sent in a message. If your picture is \"photo.jpg\", you can prepare it by using this command:\n\n```\nMake ready photo.jpg\n```\n\nThis changes your photo so it can be sent in the message.\n\n## Chapter 5: Conclusion\n\nIn this lesson, we talked about how to make messages with extra parts using a computer program. We learned how to add these extra parts, find out their types, and make sure they fit right.

While creating a simple text email using MIME is simple, adding attachments requires a bit of work and can be tricky.

We can use uuencode command to do that. After the encoding, we would need to remove first and last lines, which specify start and end of encoding.\nsed stream editor will help us easily remove those lines.\n\nStep 4 - Create email boundary\n\nA multi-part MIME message require boundaries between different parts of the message, and at the start and end of the message body.

{"text": "Lesson: Working Together to Help\n\nIntroduction:\nToday, we will learn how working together can help everyone. We will see how people and groups can join hands to make good things happen and help others.\n\nSection 1: What is Working Together?\n\n**Simple Idea:** Working together means people help each other to reach a big goal. They share their ideas and things to make something special that one person alone can't do.\n\n**Example:** A group in a place decides to build a park. They all use their special skills like gathering money, planting, and building.

{"text": "Lesson: Introduction to Programming\n\n## Chapter 1: What is Programming?\nProgramming is the process of designing and creating instructions that can be followed by a computer to perform specific tasks. It involves writing code, which is a set of instructions that the computer can understand and execute.\n\n## Section 1: What is Code?\nCode is a set of instructions written in a programming language that can be understood and executed by a computer. It consists of a series of logical statements that tell the computer what to do, when to do it, and how to do it.\n\n## Section 2: Why Learn Programming?\nLearning programming is important because it helps us to become more technologically literate. It also opens up a world of possibilities in terms of career opportunities, as there is a high demand for programmers in today's job market. Additionally, programming can help us automate repetitive tasks, solve complex problems, and create new technologies that can improve our lives.\n\n## Section 3: How does Programming Work?\nProgramming works by breaking down a problem into smaller, more manageable pieces. These pieces are then organized into a logical sequence that the computer can follow to solve the problem. The programmer writes code that specifies what the computer should do at each step, and the computer follows these instructions to complete the task.\n\n## Glossary:\n- **Programming Language**: A set of rules and syntax that programmers use to write code. Examples of programming languages include Python, Java, and C++.\n- **Code**: A set of instructions written in a programming language that can be executed by a computer.\n- **Instructions**: A set of steps that tell the computer what to do, when to do it, and how to do it.\n- **Syntax**: The set of rules that define the proper structure and usage of a programming language.\n- **Logical Statements**: Statements that express relationships between variables, expressions, and other statements.\n- **Automation**: The process of creating technology that can perform tasks without human intervention.\n\nConclusion:\nIn this lesson, we learned about what programming is, why it is important, and how it works. We also learned some key terms related to programming, such as code, instructions, and syntax. By understanding these concepts, we can begin to explore the world of programming and its many applications.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1146, "idx": 250741, "original text": "<?php\n\n/*\n +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\n | plugins/markasjunk/localization/<lang>.inc                            |\n |                                                                       |\n | Localization file of the Roundcube Webmail Mark-As-Junk plugin        |\n | Copyright (C) 2012-2013, The Roundcube Dev Team                       |\n |                                                                       |\n | Licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3 or            |\n | any later version with exceptions for skins & plugins.                |\n | See the README file for a full license statement.                     |\n |                                                                       |\n +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n For translation see https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/roundcube-webmail/resource/plugin-markasjunk/\n*/\n$labels['buttontext'] = '\u0628\u0646\u062c\u0644';\n$labels['buttontitle'] = '\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0645\u062a \u06af\u0630\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u0628\u0647 \u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0646\u062c\u0644';\n$labels['reportedasjunk'] = '\u0628\u0627 \u0645\u0648\u0641\u0642\u06cc\u062a \u0628\u0647 \u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0646\u062c\u0644 \u06af\u0632\u0627\u0631\u0634 \u0634\u062f';\n?>", "hash": "8314ba4c44238d4999c21ba30f80f79db41f7deeb2ae5bc585b83e58ffdb6245"}

For aviation scenarios, some reasons include a flight being delayed, a flight needing to be re-routed, discovery of an maintenance issue, or general status check-ins. Traditionally, to reach particular personnel, the operations center would dial a phone number of a phone that is fixed at a particular location. For example, an aircraft may have a fixed number for a phone located at a cockpit, a flight attendant station near the nose of the plane, and/or a flight attendant station near the tail of the plane. Similarly, a port, such as an airport gate, may also be associated with a fixed number.\nIncreasingly, transport personnel are permitted to utilize their own, or company-subsidized, personal electronic devices on the job as part of the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) movement. However, unlike the fixed phones transport operation centers traditionally have dialed, the phone numbers associated with personal electronic devices are not tied to a known location. Thus, as transport personnel board different vehicles that depart from different ports, the transport operations center may not know the location of particular personnel and, relatedly, the appropriate number to dial in order to reach personnel at a particular location. Accordingly, there is a need to enable transport operations to originate calls to the personal electronic devices of personnel as the personnel traverse the transport network.", "hash": "46a396d41ed1ac323f57cfd23db5756d9f22214da7e85ab5aa4c3e8144a3b0c7"}

Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to energy conservation and allocation methods. More particularly, the invention relates to computer program and method for distributing a limited resource to a plurality of users so as to aggregate the users and organize the distribution of the resource to meet the limited availability of the resource according to need.\n2. Description of the Prior Art\nThe impending deregulation of various energy resources such as electricity and natural gas has created an opportunity to combine consumers' resource requirements in order to approach the marketplace and acquire the best price. Consumers experience not only a per time unit requirement of a resource (such as a kilowatt-hour requirement for electricity) but also a peak availability, or demand, for the resource (such as a kilowatt demand).\nSuppliers of the limited resource must be prepared to supply these two facets of use by maintaining appropriate capacity. If no control is placed over the use of the limited resource, the use of the resource will typically peak at certain times of the year, for example in the summer for electricity. Electric utility companies must design generation capacity to meet the highest demand on the highest usage day of the year. The alternative is to subject customers to possible brown outs or black outs.\nDistribution systems for limited resources are traditionally limited to providing the limited resource to consumers physically attached to the distribution company's facilities. Thus, consumers must purchase the limited resource only from the attached distribution company and cannot aggregate with other consumers attached to other distribution systems and bargain for better rates.\nPrior art energy control systems have been developed that allow utility companies to control specific appliances at consumers' homes or businesses by turning the appliance on or off based on the needs of the utility company to reduce the demand for the resource. These prior art systems do not consider the resource needs of consumers and thus may result in an appliance being turned off at a very inopportune time.\nOther prior art methods use power consumption reduction based on a \u201ccomfort fairness\u201d procedure. The \u201ccomfort fairness\u201d method sheds loads with the lowest priority first. The \u201ccomfort fairness\u201d method focuses on the systems in one building but does not take into account need over an aggregated system of users.\nAccordingly, a need exists for an improved method of providing a limited resource to a plurality of users that overcomes the limitations of the prior art.", "hash": "b7c171296b3dd56766121fcb0f4072551c0ffb076a677e0446131c6e1d8c8246"}

We will talk about how to arrange things in your photo, use light, and how to make everyone look their best. We will also talk about different cameras and things that help make your photos beautiful.\nSection 1: Arranging Things\nWhen you take a photo, how you arrange things is important. Here are some easy rules:\n- Rule of Thirds: Imagine your photo is divided into nine equal parts by two lines down and two lines across. Try to put the important parts of your photo where those lines meet or along the lines.\n- Leading Lines: Use lines like paths or edges of buildings to make your photo nice to look at. These lines help lead the eyes of someone looking at your photo.\n- Frame Within a Frame: Look for things like doors or windows that can act like a picture frame in your photo. This makes your photo look deeper and more interesting.\nSection 2: Using Light\nLight helps make your family photos look great. Here are some tips:\n- Natural Light: Use light from the sun that is not too bright. Early in the morning or late in the day is a good time because the light is softer.\n- Flash: If your camera has a flash, point it at the ceiling or a wall to make the light softer. You can also use special camera lights to add more light.\n- Reflectors: Use something shiny like a white or silver board to make dark places look brighter.\nSection 3: Making Everyone Look Good\nHow you make people stand or sit in a photo is important. Here are some ideas:\n- Group Posing: Make everyone stand in a circle or half-circle. It looks nice if adults stand behind kids.\n- Pose Families with Young Children: Let a parent sit and have the child stand in front of them. This looks nice and relaxed.\n- Pose Siblings: Have brothers and sisters stand together or hold hands.\nConclusion:\nRemember, taking great family photos is about arranging things nicely, using light well, and making everyone look good. Try different things and have fun taking photos. With some practice, you will take photos that your family will love for a long time.\nGlossary:\n- Arranging Things: How you put people and things in your photo.\n- Rule of Thirds: A way to make pictures by drawing two lines up and down and two lines across to make nine same-size parts.\n- Leading Lines: Lines in a picture that make your eyes look around.\n- Frame Within a Frame: A special edge in a picture that makes it look deeper and more interesting.\n- Natural Light: Gentle light that comes from the sun through things like windows.\n- Flash: A tool that makes a bright light to help see what you are taking a picture of.\n- Reflector: A tool that bounces light back to make the dark spots brighter.\n- Posing: Setting up people or things in a picture to make it look nice.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 621, "idx": 640434, "original text": "season!.

These toys are fun to play with because they can change shape. We use these toys to squeeze, stretch, and have fun.\n\n**Section 2: How Stretchy and Squishy Materials Work**\n\nWhen we pull on a stretchy toy, it gets longer. When we let go, it goes back to its original shape. When we press a squishy toy, it changes shape and feels soft. These changes make playing fun.\n\n**Section 3: Playing with Stretchy and Squishy Toys**\nWe can use stretchy and squishy toys in different games. We can stretch them, squish them, and watch them return to their shapes. These toys help us learn about shapes and how materials can change.\n\nSpecial materials can do amazing things when they are pushed, pulled, or squeezed. They can make a tiny electric spark. This is very helpful for making things that can feel pressure or move by themselves.\n\nHere are some ways these special materials can be used:\n\n1. Feeling things: These materials can feel changes in pressure and help us know how much something is being pushed or squeezed.\n2. Moving things: These materials can help make things move. When we give them a little electric push, they change shape and can move other things.\n3. Making energy: These materials can also turn movement into electricity. This can help get energy from moving things like shaking or pressing.\n\nWe also learned about a kind of these special materials that is safe for the Earth.

Simple descriptions tell us what something is like, what it does, and why it's nice to have. Knowing this helps us choose better when we pick things.\n\n## Section 2: Simple Ideas\nSimple descriptions often tell us:\n- Who made it: This is the name of the person or company who made the thing.\n- What it is: This is what we call the thing.\n- Special things about it: What makes this thing different from others.\n- Good things about it: Why this thing is nice to have or use.\n- What we do with it: How we use the thing.\n- What it's made of: What goes into making the thing.\n- How to use it: Steps to use the thing properly.\n\nLet's talk about a hair care product.

It keeps our hair and skin happy and doesn't make them angry or itchy. This plant stuff also helps our skin not get swollen and protects it. \n\nIn a small book at the end, we learn that \"plant stuff\" means things from nature that go into the cream. There are types like shea cream, mango cream, and others, which all come from trees and fruits. \n\nBy knowing what's in the hair care products, we can make good choices when we buy them.

{"text": "Lesson: Making Up Stories\nIntroduction: Making up stories is a fun way to share your thoughts and play with ideas. We will learn some fun ways to tell stories.\nSection 1: What Are Stories?\nTopic 1: What is making up stories?\nMaking up stories means using your imagination to create new and exciting tales. You use your creativity to make up stories about people, places, and events.\nTopic 2: Kinds of Stories\nThere are many kinds of stories, such as:\n- Stories with made-up people and places.\n- Poems: These are short pieces that might rhyme and show feelings or ideas.\n- True stories: These are about real people and things that happened.\n- Plays: These are stories that actors perform on a stage or in movies.\nSection 2: Ways to Make Up Stories\nTopic 1: Use Your Senses\nWhen you tell a story, use your senses to make it feel real. Talk about how things look, sound, feel, taste, and smell.\nExample: \"The sun was going down, making everything look orange. The air smelled like grass, and you could hear crickets.\"\nTopic 2: Make Interesting People\nPeople make stories fun. Create people who are different and fun. They can have things they are good at and things they are not good at.\nExample: \"Emma was a quiet girl who liked to draw. Drawing helped her feel brave and happy.\"\nTopic 3: Make People Talk\nWhen people in your story talk, it helps us know them better. Make sure their words sound real and help us understand the story.\nExample: \"Emma: 'I want to paint.' Jake: 'Will you miss us?' Emma: 'I need to do this.'\"\nTopic 4: Show, Don't Just Tell\nInstead of just saying how someone feels, show it in what they do.\nExample: \"Emma shook a little as she picked up her brush. She was excited to start painting.\"\nSection 3: Try These Fun Activities\nActivity 1: Write a little story using your senses.\nActivity 2: Make up a person and tell us about them.\nActivity 3: Write a talk between two people in your story.\nConclusion: Making up stories is great fun and a cool way to share your ideas. We will learn about little pieces called fractions. We look at these pieces in things we do every day.\n\nWhat are Fractions?\nFractions are parts of something bigger. Imagine you have a pizza cut into 8 even pieces. If you eat 2 pieces, you've had a part of the pizza, which is 1/4 of it.\n\nParts of a Fraction:\nA fraction has two parts - the top number and the bottom number. The top number tells us how many parts we are thinking about, and the bottom number tells us how many parts there are in total.\n\nUsing Fractions Every Day:\nWe use fractions when we cook, build things, or figure out money. Here are some ways we use them:\n\n1. Cooking: If a recipe says you need 2/3 cup of sugar, you measure out that much.\n2. Building: If you need to buy fabric that is 3/4 of a yard, you get enough to cover that much space.\n3. Money: If you earn $1500 a month and spend $400 on your house, you have $1100 left for other things.\n\nHow to Work with Fractions:\nTo use fractions, you need to know the top and bottom numbers. You can put them together, take them apart, make them bigger, or split them up by doing these steps:\n\n1. Adding: To add fractions that have the same bottom number, just add the top numbers. If the bottom numbers are not the same, make them the same first.\n2. Taking Away: To take one fraction from another with the same bottom number, just take away the top numbers. If the bottom numbers are different, make them the same first.\n3. Making Bigger: To make fractions bigger, multiply the top numbers and the bottom numbers.\n4. Splitting Up: To split one fraction into another, flip the second one upside down and multiply.\n\nFun Practice:\n1. Change 1/4 to a new fraction that has 6 as the bottom number.\n2. If you have half a pizza left, how much pizza is that?\n[PARAGRAPH]3. If you earn $1200 per month and spend $300 on rent, how much money do you have left to spend?\n\nConclusion:\nFractions are an essential part of mathematics and are used in many real-world scenarios. By understanding the components of a fraction and how to perform fractional calculations, we can apply our knowledge to solve problems and make informed decisions.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 753, "idx": 354950, "original text": "From My Sketchbook - Rhymes and Doodles. #FlashFictionFriday: If Life were a \u201965 Impala.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning to Think\n\nThinking well means we look at info carefully to make good choices. It's like being a detective with questions and clues. In this lesson, we'll learn simple ways to think well and use it in daily life.\n\n**Section 1: What is Thinking Well?**\n\nThinking well helps us know and judge info. It uses thinking and reason to make choices, solve problems, and talk clearly. Thinking well is great because it helps us choose wisely and not be fooled by wrong info.\n\n**Section 2: How can I get better at thinking well?**\n\nGetting better at thinking well needs time and trying. Here are some easy ways to practice:\n\n1. Read a lot: Reading different books or stories helps you see many ideas.\n\n2. Ask questions: Always ask \"why\" and \"how\" about things you hear or see. This helps you understand more.\n\n3. Check facts: Look for facts that support or deny what you know. Think about if the facts are true and if you can trust them.\n\n4. Think about other ideas: Don't just believe the first thing you hear. Think about other ways and check them too.\n\n5. Try deciding: Make choices based on what you know and see how it goes. This practice makes your choosing better.\n\n**Section 3: Using Good Thinking**\n\nNow that we know what good thinking is and how to get better, let's see how to use it in different situations.\n\n**Example 1: Checking news**\n\nImagine you see a story online saying a new rule lets people be watched without knowing. You want to know if this is true.\n\n1. Read the story well and look for any proof.\n\n2. Look up other news to see if they say the same.\n\n3. Check if any leaders or smart people say it's not true.\n\n4. Think about if the story's source is trustworthy.\n\n5. Decide if the story is true based on what you find.\n\n**Example 2: Solving a Problem**\n\nImagine you want to keep more money each month. You can use good thinking to look at choices and make a plan.\n\n1. Know your aim: The aim is to keep more money each month.\n\n2. Collect info: Look up different ways to keep money, like spending less or doing extra work.\n\n3. Think about choices: Look at the different choices and think about which is best for you.\n\nDecide: Pick the choice that is best for your money needs.\n\nStart the plan: Begin your plan and check how it's going.\n\n**Small Words:**\n- Thinking hard: the act of carefully looking at information to make a smart choice\n- Proof: things that show something is true or not\n- Trustworthy: can be believed\n- Other ideas: different ways to explain something\n- Dependable: can be relied on\n\n**Ending Thought:**\nThinking hard helps us make good choices and avoid wrong information.

Two officials said they believed his remains were delivered to the sea from an aircraft.\n\nU.S. Army General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a Pentagon news briefing on Monday that the U.S. military disposed of Baghdadi\u2019s remains \u201cappropriately, in accordance with our (standard operating procedures) and in accordance with the law of armed conflict.\u201d\n\nGiven the gruesome nature of Baghdadi\u2019s death, it was unlikely the U.S. military followed as complete a process as it did after Navy SEALs killed al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden in a 2011 raid into Pakistan.\n\nIn the case of bin Laden, his body was transported to the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson.

{"text": "Lesson: Sun Power and How We Use It\n\nStarting Out\n\nSun power is energy from the sun. It is a kind of energy that we can always get more of and it helps us in many ways. In this lesson, we will learn about sun power, how we use it, and why it is good.\n\nWhat is Sun Power?\n\nSun power is energy from the sun. It is a kind of energy that never runs out. The sun sends out energy that we can turn into electricity with special panels.\n\nHow does Sun Power Work?\n\nSun panels have special parts called cells. These cells catch energy from the sun and change it into electricity. When the sun shines on the cells, it makes tiny parts called electrons move and this creates electricity. We can use this electricity in homes, places where we work, and more.\n\nUsing Sun Power\n\nWe can use sun power for many things, like:\n\n1. Making electricity: Sun power can make electricity for houses, places where we work, and other spots.\n\n2. Keeping warm or cool: Sun power can help keep buildings warm or cool using special sun heat systems.\n\n3. Cleaning water: Sun power can help clean water with sun-powered cleaning systems.\n\n4. Moving around: Sun power can help cars and boats that run on electricity move.\n\nWhy Sun Power is Good\n\nUsing sun power is great because:\n\n1. It is always there and does not run out: Sun power is always available and does not get used up.\n\n2. It does not make air dirty: Sun power does not create bad air, so it is good for our Earth.\n\n3. Saves money: Sun power can help save money on energy costs in the future.\n\n4. Easy to take care of: Sun power systems do not need a lot of work to keep them running.\n\nIn conclusion, sun power is a kind of energy that can be used again and again. It comes from the sun and helps us use less of the earth's energy that can run out. Using sun power is good for our planet.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1294, "idx": 8609, "original text": "Additional Information\n\nWorld's Brightest Double Solar Spotlights\n\nBrilliant, solar-powered spotlight is bright enough to use as a floodlight\n\nMost durable, seamless, weatherproof solar spotlight on the market\n\nLights from dusk to dawn on a full day's charge\n\nEasy to install; no wiring or extension cords needed\n\nOur Ultra-Bright Double Solar Spotlights are not only brighter than any other solar lights on the market, they also outshine many low-voltage lights.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Special Senses\n\n**Introduction:** \nSpecial senses are ways some people think they can know things without using their eyes, ears, nose, tongue, or skin. These special senses include knowing what others are thinking, seeing things far away or not there, and knowing things before they happen. Even though scientists havent found proof that these special senses are real, many stories and myths talk about them. Today, we will learn about these special senses.\n\n**Section 1: What are Special Senses?**\n\nSpecial senses are ways to know things that we usually can't with our regular senses. These include knowing others' thoughts, seeing things that aren't in front of us, and guessing what will happen next. These special senses are often in stories and myths but haven't been proven by scientists.\n\n**Section 2: How Have People Tried to Learn About Special Senses?**\n\nPeople have tried different ways to see if special senses are real. In some tests, people try to guess hidden things, like the color of a card they cant see. Scientists check if they guess right more often than by just chance. Also, surveys ask people if they ever knew something they shouldnt have or felt something strange.\n\n**Section 3: Why Might People Believe in Special Senses?**\n\nPeople might believe in special senses because our brains are good at guessing and noticing little things. For example, even if we can't see someones face from far away, our brain might guess who it is by how they walk or their shape. This guessing can feel like knowing the future. Also, our brains are quick to notice small things, like a quick smile or a little nod, which might feel like reading minds.\n\n**Section 4: Conclusion**\n\nIn the end, even though no proof shows that these special senses are real, they are still fun to think about in stories and myths. Scientists keep looking into it, but nothing certain has been found yet. People might believe in special mind powers because our brains are good at guessing and noticing small signs around us. Even though it is fun to think about, these special powers are not real according to science.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 700, "idx": 123560, "original text": "Album \"Depths of Perception\" already on Pandora!.

{"text": "Golf Lesson\n\n### Overview\nWe will learn about golf. We will see how golf started, how golfers play, and why playing together as a team is good.\n\n### Section 1: Introduction to Golf\nGolf started a long time ago in a place called Scotland. In golf, you try to hit a small ball into holes on a big grassy area. You can play on courses with either nine or eighteen holes. You use different clubs to hit the ball. The person who uses the fewest hits to get the ball into the holes wins.\n\n### Section 2: The Life of a Professional Golfer\nProfessional golfers play golf as their job. They go to different places to play in big games. They can win money and get gifts from people who like how they play. Some famous golfers are William, Jack, and Arnold.\n\n### Section 3: The Rules of Golf\nThe rules in golf help everyone play fair and make the game fun for everyone. Here are some rules:\n1. You can't touch the ball or the ground with your club when you swing.\n2. You should try to take the long way to the hole unless it's too hard.\n3. If your ball stops in a sandy area or water, you can move it out but you get an extra point as a penalty.\n\n### Section 4: Teamwork in Golf\nSometimes, golf is played in teams. This is fun because you can help and cheer for each other. Playing in a team helps everyone do their best.\n\n### Conclusion\nGolf is fun and needs careful thinking, good planning, and working with friends.

Among these data, an image, especially, a multi-valued image contains a very large volume of information, and upon storing and transmitting such image, the image data size becomes huge. For this reason, storage and transmission of an image use high-efficiency coding that reduces the data size by removing redundancy of an image or changing the contents of an image to a degree at which deterioration of image quality is not visually recognizable.\nAs an example of the high-efficiency coding, JPEG recommended by ISO and ITU-T as an international standard coding scheme of still image is prevalently used. JPEG specifies several coding schemes in correspondence with use purposes of encoded data of images to be encoded, and roughly has two modes, i.e., a DCT use mode that uses discrete cosine transformation and aims at irreversible coding, and a spatial mode that aims at reversible coding on the basis of two-dimensional DPCM.\nA detailed description of these modes will be omitted since these modes are described in ITU-T Recommendation T.81 | ISO/IEC 10918-1 and the like. The DCT mode controls the bit rate by changing the quantization step in quantization, and must give a large quantization step to set a low target bit rate. As a result, especially under a low-bit rate condition, the reproduced image is distorted beyond an allowable level due to quantization.\nAlso, JPEG specifies hierarchical coding. In hierarchical coding, a plurality of images having different resolutions are generated by reducing an input image in a plurality of scales like \u00bd, \u00bc, . . . in both the horizontal and vertical directions, and an image having the lowest resolution is encoded and transmitted like a normal image.\nIn this hierarchical coding, the DCT and spatial modes can be used. If hierarchical coding is implemented as reversible coding, since the spatial mode is used for all the scales or only the last scale, and the DCT mode is used for all other scales, an apparatus must comprise a circuit or program that can implement both the two modes, resulting in a complicated apparatus.\nAs a scheme that can combat these problems, a coding scheme using discrete wavelet transformation has been proposed. Such coding scheme using discrete wavelet transformation is advantageous since it assures higher compression performance than the DCT mode, can implement hierarchical coding in JPEG in a single system, and so forth.\nOn the other hand, requirements for image compression coding are becoming increasingly stricter, and even for a binary image such as a text image which is conventionally encoded by another scheme, a decoded image is required to have higher image quality. However, with the conventional scheme, both natural and binary images or an image including these images cannot be restored, while assuring sufficiently high image quality of the decoded image.", "hash": "91be48b90b55c21d40861f33caf0d781b4df08e9756127fa08aee6ddd271b021"}

Fair play rules help stop that.\n\nSection 3: How do we make sure everyone follows the Fair Play Rules?\nPeople who make sure the rules are followed watch over the shops and businesses. If they see someone not playing fair, they can ask them to stop and play nice. Sometimes, they might even need to tell them off if they have been very unfair.\n\nSection 4: Important Points About Fair Play Today\nRight now, it's important to think about how big companies that let us talk to friends and buy things online play fair too. Some people are worried they might be too bossy. It's also important to think about how these rules can help everyone be treated nicely and fairly.\n\nSection 5: Conclusion\nFair play rules are very important to make sure everyone has fun and gets a fair chance when they are shopping or selling. There are many things to think about with these rules today, but knowing about them helps us understand why they are so important.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 515, "idx": 246092, "original text": "10 key themes.

{"text": "Lesson: The Time of Big Ideas and Adventures\n\nIntroduction:\nThe Time of Big Ideas was a time long ago when people started thinking in new ways and asking lots of questions. This happened in Europe a long, long time ago. People thought a lot about being kind, using their minds, and caring about others. This helped everyone learn a lot about the world. Once upon a time, people really liked to explore new places, learn about different people, and see new things.\n\nIn our story today, we talk about a time long ago when explorers were very busy. They wanted to find new lands and learn all about them.\n\nFirst, why did these explorators go on big adventures? They were curious about the world, wanted to get rich, and felt proud of their countries. They traveled far to learn, trade, and show that their country was strong.\n\nLet's imagine what they needed for their big trips. They built big, strong ships that could travel across the ocean. They learned how to use maps and special tools to find their way. They also learned how to stay healthy on long trips by eating right and keeping clean.\n\nThese explorers from places like SP country, FR country, and UK country went on many journeys and helped us learn a lot about our world.\n\nNow, let's draw a picture of a big ship and imagine where we would go if we were explorers too!\n\nQuestion: What did people learn from big trips long ago?\n\nAnswer: Long ago, big trips helped people learn about plants, animals, and places.\n\nExplanation: People who went on these trips collected many plants, animals, and rocks. They brought them back to study and learn from. This helped everyone know more about the world.\n\nThese travelers also made art and wrote about what they saw. This helps us know about the people and places they visited.\n\nFinally, these trips made some countries very powerful because they found new lands and new things.\n\nActivity: Make a chart showing what people learned from big trips.\n\n| What They Learned | How They Learned It |\n| --- | --- |\n| About Nature | By collecting plants, animals, and rocks |\n| About People and Places | Through art and writing |\n| About Power | By finding new lands |\n\nConclusion:\nLong ago, big trips taught us a lot about the world and other people.

{"text": "Lesson Title: Keeping Teeth Clean\n\nIntroduction:\nGum disease is when our gums get sore and sick because too much yucky stuff builds up on our teeth. This lesson is about how cleaning the roots of our teeth can stop our gums from getting too sick and might stop us from needing a doctor to fix it.\n\nCore Value:\nCleaning the roots of our teeth is a big part of keeping gum disease away. It means taking away the sick parts from the tooth roots. This stops the gums from getting more swollen and keeps them healthy.\n\nSection 1: Learning About Gum Disease\n\nTopic 1: What is gum disease?\nGum disease happens when our gums get swollen and sore. It's because the teeth get covered with yucky stuff called plaque, which makes the gums sick.\n\nTopic 2: How does the yucky stuff make gum disease?\nPlaque is a sticky layer of germs on our teeth. If we don't brush it away, it gets hard and turns into tartar, which is really tough to clean. The germs make our gums red, puffy, and hurt. If we don't take care of it, our teeth might get loose because the gums pull away and make spaces that get infected.\n\nSection 2: Why Cleaning Tooth Roots Helps\n\nTopic 3: What is cleaning tooth roots?\nCleaning tooth roots means taking away the sick parts from the tooth roots. This helps our gums feel better and keeps them from getting worse.\n\nTopic 4: Why is cleaning tooth roots important?\nCleaning the roots helps get rid of the sickness and helps our gums heal. It makes the gums strong again and stick to our teeth better, so we might not need surgery.\n\nSection 3: Examples of Cleaning Teeth\n\nTopic 5: How do we clean tooth roots?\nA dentist helps us clean our tooth roots. They make sure it doesn't hurt by giving a little medicine. Then they use special tools to clean away the sick parts without hurting the good parts.\n\nTopic: What happens after a special teeth cleaning?\n\nAfter this cleaning, some kids might feel a bit sore in their gums, and they may look a little puffy. This is okay and usually gets better in a few days. The dentist might give medicine to stop any more germ problems and help the gums heal faster. Kids will need to keep their teeth really clean by brushing and not letting germs build up again.\n\nIn the end, this special teeth cleaning is very important for keeping gums healthy. It stops swelling and stops the gums from getting worse, which means no need for big dentist visits. By knowing why this cleaning is important and keeping teeth clean, kids can keep their gums healthy and have a bright smile.\n\nWords to know:\n- Germs: Tiny bugs that can make us sick\n- Cleaning: Making something clean\n- Gums: The soft part around your teeth\n- Medicine: Something you take to feel better or stop germs", "source": "minipile", "s": 8, "len": 2427, "idx": 28607, "original text": "Our previous application set up the hypothesis that certain forms of periodontitis were specific infections due to proportional overgrowth of anaerobic species, such as spirochetes and B. gingivalis. We have conducted double blind studies using metronidazole, which showed that patients who received tooth surface debridement and one week of systemic metronidazole required significantly less periodontal surgery than the control patients. In the current proposal we seek to determine whether periodontal surgery can be reduced and/or eliminated by root surface debridement plus the usage of drugs directed against periodontopathic organisms and/or the host's inflammatory response. The drugs to be evaluated will be metronidazole and tetracycline, each taken systemically for a two-week period after the scaling and root planing is completed. Teeth that are refractory to this regimen and still require some form of periodontal surgery will have ethylcellulose films containing either metronidazole or chlorhexidine placed within their pockets for one week or more. These films are fabricated so that the drug is slowly released over a 3- to 10-day period. The reduction in surgical needs will be judged by clinical criteria and will be verified by standardize radiographs and bacteriological parameters. Patients seen at the annual recall visit will receive either metronidazole or tetracycline in a double blind design to determine the prophylactic value of periodic antimicrobial treatment during the maintenance phase. Bacteriological parameters will be obtained throughout the study period. In a related investigation, patients who have an anaerobic periodontal infection will receive metronidazole or placebo under supervision. The serum and saliva levels of metronidazole will be compared with the changes in levels and proportions of spirochetes in the plaque and with the ability of the plaque to hydrolyze the trypsin substrate BANA. In this way we hope to determine whether patient compliance in the systemic usage of metronidazole can be measured by changes in the plaque levels and/or proportions of spirochetes or in the ability of the plaque to hydrolyze BANA. Finally, we will develop and deploy slow release ethylcellulose film systems for the delivery of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, such as indomethacin to the periodontal pocket either alone or in combination with metronidazole or chlorhexidine.", "hash": "e2c114da46bf073a4780f4920185fefdbd79a85785caadc40fb126dacbbbed6d"}
{"text": "Lesson Title: All About Electric Cars\n\n## Chapter 1: What is an Electric Car?\n\nAn electric car is a car that uses electricity to go instead of gas. It has an electric motor and a battery that needs to be charged. You can charge the battery by plugging the car into a special spot for charging. Electric cars are good for the Earth because they don't make dirty air.\n\n## Chapter 2: How do Electric Cars Go?\n\nElectric cars use the power from their batteries to make the wheels turn. There's a motor in the car that uses magnets to move the wheels. When you push the go pedal, the car tells the motor to work faster or slower. Pushing the pedal more makes the car go faster.\n\n## Chapter 3: Why do People Like Electric Cars?\n\nPeople like electric cars because they help keep the air clean, they dont use expensive gas, and they don't need much fixing. This means they are good for both our planet and our wallets.\n\n## Chapter 4: Some Electric Cars\n\nElectric cars are special cars that don't need gasoline. They use electricity, like the electricity that turns on your lights at home. There are different kinds of electric cars. Some are small, and some are big. They can go far without needing to stop for more power. Some can go really far, like as far as if you drove from your house to a place far away where you can have a picnic.\n\n## Chapter 5: How to Give Power to Your Electric Car\n\nGiving power to your electric car is easy! You can do it at home. You just use a special wire and plug it into the wall, like when you charge your toy. There are also special places in towns where you can go to charge your car faster.\n\n## Chapter 6: Taking Care of Electric Cars\n\nElectric cars are easy to take care of. They don't have many parts that move, so they don't break down as much. You don't have to change their oil like other cars. But you still need to check their tires and brakes sometimes to make sure everything is working well.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nToday, we learned about electric cars. They are good because they don't use gasoline and don't pollute the air. We talked about how they work and why many people like them. We also learned how to charge them and take care of them. Now you know how electric cars are different from cars that use gasoline.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 939, "idx": 218300, "original text": "The German tuner has unveiled its Smart Fortwo Electric Drive equipped with a few sporty features \u2014 the coolest of which is an exhaust-note generator..

This can make too much cholesterol stay in our blood, which is not good.\n\nTopic 2: How does eating fat change our body fats?\nEating a lot of certain fats, like hard fats or processed fats, can make the fat carriers carry more bad fats, which can hurt our hearts.\n\nSection 3: Eating and Body Fats in Men\n\nTopic 1: How do foods affect body fats in men?\nIn some men, eating too much cholesterol and bad fats can make too much bad fat stay in the blood. This can make them more likely to get heart diseases.\n\nTopic 2: Does the type of fat matter?\nYes, the type of fat matters. Eating good fats, like those from fish and nuts, can help keep the fat levels better than eating bad fats like in some snacks and fast foods.\n\nConclusion:\nIts important to know how eating different fats affects our body's cholesterol. Eating well with different kinds of good food and not too much bad fat can help us stay healthy and keep our hearts happy.\n\nGlossary:\n- Fat: A kind of soft material in the body that helps make important body parts work well.\n- Little fat carriers: Tiny bubbles that carry fat from food all around the body.\n- Good fat: A type of fat that stays liquid and is found in yummy things like nuts, seeds, and fish.\n- Hard fat: A type of fat that stays hard and is in foods like butter, cheese, and meat.\n- Not-so-good fat: A type of fat that isnt very healthy and is in some snacks like cookies.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1626, "idx": 355981, "original text": "Effect of dietary cholesterol and fat on cell cholesterol transfer to postprandial plasma in hyperlipidemic men.\nPostprandial chylomicrons are potent ultimate acceptors of cell membrane cholesterol and are believed to accelerate reverse cholesterol transport (RCT).

In HTG-H men, cell cholesterol accumulation in 6-h postprandial plasma was significantly (P = 0.02) less after the PUFA-HC meal compared with the other meals. The significant (P < 0.001) increase in cell plus endogenous cholesterol accumulation in the triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) fraction of 4 h postprandial plasma incubated with RBC was significantly (P = 0.007) higher after the PUFA-HC meal compared with DF meal in HTG-H men. In NTG-H men, cholesterol accumulation in plasma and plasma lipoproteins in the presence and absence of RBC was not significantly affected by the type of meal ingested. These data suggest that addition of large amounts of cholesterol to a PUFA meal may impair diffusion-mediated transport of cell membrane cholesterol to postprandial plasma and that replacing DF with PUFA in a meal increases postprandial lipemia and may potentially increase cholesterol accumulation in atherogenic postprandial TRL in HTG-H men.", "hash": "91a1b4a7ac55b2d0acf09c48b45b3843b9d6db98c69f51f00283af9440e5cf9b"}
{"text": "Lesson: How Seeds Start Growing\n\n**Goal:** Learn how seeds begin to grow into plants.\n\n**Start:** When a seed starts to grow, its called seed germination. This helps plants make more plants. Today, we will see how seeds start growing and what they need to grow well.\n\n**Part 1: How Seeds Start Growing**\n\nSeeds start growing in four parts:\n\n1. **Drinking Water:** First, the seed drinks water. It gets big and starts to wake up inside.\n\n2. **Tiny Root Comes Out:** Next, a small root comes out of the seed. It pushes the seeds coat away and lets a tiny shoot come out too.\n\n3. **Growing Towards Light:** The tiny shoot grows up towards the light. This helps the plant get sunlight to make food.\n\n4. **Growing Bigger:** After that, the root and shoot keep growing. The plant gets bigger and later makes flowers and new seeds.\n\n**Part 2: What Seeds Need to Start Growing**\n\nSeeds need a few things to start growing well:\n\n1. **Warmth:** Seeds like to be warm to start growing. But, some like it a bit cool.\n\n2. **Water:** Seeds need water to grow. But not too much, or they might rot.\n\nLittle plants start from seeds. To grow, a seed needs air to breathe. It breathes through tiny holes. Seeds also have food inside them. When a seed starts to grow, it uses this food. Then, it needs food from the dirt to keep growing.\n\nGrowing from a seed is the start of a plant's life. A little seed can become a big plant. This big plant can make more seeds. This helps more plants grow.\n\n**Words to Know:**\n- Baby plant: The little plant inside the seed.\n- First root: The part of the baby plant that grows down into the dirt.\n- First shoot: The part of the baby plant that grows up towards the sky.\n- Light growing: Plants grow towards the light.\n\n**What We Learned:**\nGrowing from a seed is a special way plants make new plants. We can learn a lot by looking at how seeds grow.\n\n**Think About It:**\nPretend you are a seed in the dirt. What would be hard for you? How would you grow?", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 702, "idx": 389075, "original text": "Flower Garden - Snapdragon.

{"text": "Lesson: Talking About How Things Send Messages and How Towers Help\n\n### Section 1: Simple Ideas\n\nWe can send messages without wires using special air waves. It's like how you see birds flying from one place to another without touching anything. These air waves are special because there is only a little room for all the waves we want to send. Places where people make rules help make sure the waves don't bump into each other, so everyone's messages go through nicely. Towers and special wires help carry these messages from one phone to another.\n\n### Section 2: Easy Examples\n\nThink about sending a picture to your friend using your toy phone. You press send, and the picture turns into an invisible message that flies through the air to a tower near you. The tower catches the message and sends it to another tower near your friend. Then, your friend's toy phone gets the message. All this happens super fast!\n\n### Section 3: Stories We Can Imagine\n\nImagine you have a big toy company that lets lots of kids talk and send pictures to each other. To make sure all these messages go through without problems, you need to keep the air waves clean and put more towers in places where lots of kids want to send messages. You also need to make sure your towers can use new types of messages, like super-fast ones.\n\n### Words to Know\n\nAir Waves: Invisible paths that help send messages from one toy to another without wires.\n\nTowers and Wires: Parts that help carry messages across long distances, from one toy to another.\n\n### The End\n\nKnowing about air waves and towers helps you understand how your toy phone sends pictures and messages so quickly.

Business Insider Intelligence\n\nThe companies had agreed to combine into one entity, to be known as New T-Mobile, to better compete with AT&T and Verizon in the US market. That merger has been delayed due to regulatory scrutiny from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the US Department of Justice (DOJ), and is still on hold due to an ongoing antitrust lawsuit from a group of state attorneys general.\n\nThere are two key takeaways from reports that T-Mobile is looking to reduce how much it will pay to merge with Sprint.\n\nAs the timeline of the merger keeps moving out, the deal is becoming less valuable to T-Mobile. One of the core aims of the merger for T-Mobile is to amass the assets \u2014 namely wireless spectrum, network infrastructure, and cellular towers \u2014 needed to compete with AT&T and Verizon. But as the date to combine moves out, it's becoming clear that T-Mobile might be able to offer a competitive network with the assets it already has. And with the FCC moving to auction off mid-band spectrum next year, Sprint's holdings in the sub-6 GHz bands will be less valuable, giving T-Mobile a credible alternative.\n\nT-Mobile is already facing challenges from the delays, and could be looking to account for losses. For instance, the carrier lost its contract with MVNO Ting Mobile to Verizon, with the regional virtual carrier specifically citing the delays stemming from the merger and the inability of T-Mobile to offer lower rates based on combined infrastructure. T-Mobile has also reportedly notified some of its wireless contractors that it would delay purchase orders for new infrastructure and 5G upgrades until 2020, and is holding off on new sites for macrocells as it awaits approval for the merger.\n\nThe uncertainty pervading the wireless market could give AT&T and Verizon a chance to bolster their 5G networks while competing on price with what Sprint and T-Mobile presently offer (and New T-Mobile would be able to). For example, AT&T could potentially drop prices and lower its average revenue per user (ARPU) to compete with any prices New T-Mobile could offer.\n\nVerizon will still be able to lean on a larger wireless customer base, especially once T-Mobile and Sprint spin off their prepaid brands as a concession to regulators. New T-Mobile had hoped to take advantage of its competitors' slow transition to 5G, but due to the range of hurdles that have slowed the merger, its arrival might not have the intended disruptive effect.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?

These places are homes for birds to live, move from one place to another, and stay during cold times. Lately, more windmills are being built, and this can be bad for these special bird places. This lesson will talk about why these places are important, how windmills can be a problem, and what can be done to keep these places safe.\n\nSection 1: Why are Special Bird Places Important?\n\nTopic 1: What are Special Bird Places?\n\nSpecial Bird Places are areas that are really good for birds that need help. These places have birds that are not found many places, birds that need special homes, and birds that might go away forever if we dont help them. You can find these places in woods, big open lands, wet lands, and near the sea.\n\nTopic 2: Why are these places important for birds?\n\nThese places are very important because they give birds homes. Birds need these places to build nests, move from one place to another, and stay warm in cold times. Many birds need these places to live, and if we lose these places, we might lose these birds forever. These places also help keep nature healthy and help people by keeping bugs away and helping plants grow.\n\nSection 2: How Windmills Can Be Bad for Special Bird Places\n\nTopic 1: How do windmills affect these places?\n\nBuilding windmills to make energy is good for keeping the air clean, but it can be bad for bird homes. Windmills can hurt birds, mess up their homes, and make it hard for them to move from place to place.\n\nTopic 2: What can we do to help?\n\nTo help keep these bird homes safe when building windmills, we can check the land carefully before building, stay away from very important bird homes, use technology to keep birds safe, and try to fix any problems that might hurt the birds.\n\nSection 3: Keeping Special Bird Places Safe from Windmills\n\nTopic 1: How can we keep these places safe?\n\nTo keep these places safe, we need to find them and make sure they are protected by laws. Once we know where they are, we can make plans to keep them safe. We can also tell people about these places so more people want to help protect them.\n\nTopic 2: What can governments do to help?\n\nGovernments have a big job in keeping these places safe. They can make laws that protect bird homes, give money for studying birds, and work with people to come up with good plans to keep bird homes safe.\n\nConclusion\n\n[PARAGRAPH]In conclusion, understanding the importance of IBAs and the impact of wind energy development on these areas is essential for promoting bird conservation. By taking steps to protect IBA's, we can ensure the long-term survival of bird populations and the ecosystems they support.\n\nGlossary\n\n- Important Bird Areas (IBAs): Locations that are crucial for the conservation of bird populations\n- Bird mortality: The death of birds caused by wind turbines\n- Habitats: The natural environment in which a particular species lives, grows, and reproduces\n- Migration: The physical movement of animals from one place to another\n- Pollination: The transfer of pollen from the male reproductive organs of a flower to the female reproductive organs\n- Pest control: The regulation or management of a species considered to be a pest, typically by killing it or keeping its population down\n\n[1] Nature CA city.

Also participating were Cheryl Anderson from the Prince Edward County Field Naturalists and Rosemary Kent from the Prince Edward Point Bird Observatory.\n\n\u201cWe believe in good things in good places,\u201d said Ted Cheskey, Nature Canada\u2019s manager of bird conservation programs. \u201cTo achieve wind energy\u2019s greatest promise \u2013 a clean alternative to fossil fuels that helps, not harms wildlife \u2013 wind turbines should not be located in Important Bird Areas.\u201d\n\nWind energy is a clean, abundant, renewable source of energy that can contribute to combating the harmful environmental changes brought about by global warming. When compared to other forms of energy production, particularly fossil-fuel based sources, wind power has a relatively small impact on the environment \u2013 as long as they are appropriately situated.\n\nIn some cases, when wind projects are poorly located, the benefits of renewable energy are offset by a terrible cost to wildlife. TransAlta\u2019s Wolfe Island Wind Energy plant, near Kingston Ontario, for example, is one of the most destructive for birds and bats in North America. The casualty rate for birds at this site is seven times the industry average.\n\nWolfe Island, and other areas in the Eastern Lake Ontario basin, are found within what are known as Important Bird Areas, or IBAs. IBAs are literally the most significant sites on earth for birds, places where they breed, feed, and rest in great numbers. IBAs are recognized according to strict international scientific criteria. These are places birds depend on for survival.\n\n\u201cThe coasts of the Great Lakes are like super highways for migrating birds,\u201d said Cheskey. \u201cThings like wind turbines, transmission towers, and tall buildings can exact a terrible toll on birds.\u201d\n\nNature Canada supports the development of wind energy in Canada, coupled with conservation measures to reduce all forms of fossil fuel consumption.\n\nHowever, to ensure that wind energy projects do indeed help, and not harm, wildlife:\n\n\u2022 Wind turbines and wind farms should not be located in places \u2013 such as Important Bird Areas \u2013 where birds congregate, migrate and breed.\n\n\u2022 All wind farm proposals should be subject to an environmental assessment prior to development in order to evaluate their impact on all wildlife, including birds and bats.\n\n\u2022 Regulators such as the provincial and territorial governments should adopt policies and guidelines that exclude wind energy projects from Important Bird Areas and other areas that are known to be of importance to birds and bats.\n\n\u2022 Any wind farms that already exist within migratory corridors or bottlenecks should be subject to the best practices for mitigating their impacts on birds, especially during migration season.\n\n\u201cWe have an opportunity to get this right, now,\u201d said Cheskey. \u201cClear standards are needed to ensure that projects are more carefully sited to exclude wind energy plants from Important Bird Areas, and that\u2019s why we support Senator Bob Runciman\u2019s motion announced today.\u201d\n\nAbout Nature Canada\nNature Canada is a member-based non-profit nature conservation organization dedicated to conserving and protecting wildlife and habitats in Canada by engaging people and advocating on behalf of nature.

{"text": "Lesson: Tiny Parts of Everything\n\n## Start Here\n\nEverything is made of tiny parts called atoms. These tiny parts are in the air, water, and even our snacks. We will learn about atoms and elements.\n\n## First Part: Atoms\n\n### Little Bit 1: What is an Atom?\n\nAn atom is super tiny and makes up everything. It has three little parts: protons, neutrons, and electrons.\n\n### Little Bit 2: Inside an Atom\n\nInside an atom, there is a middle part called the nucleus. It has protons and neutrons. Electrons move around the nucleus. The atom is what it is because of how many protons it has.\n\n### Little Bit 3: Atom Numbers\n\nAtoms have a special number that tells us how many protons they have. This is the atom's number. They also have a mass number, which is the total of protons and neutrons.\n\n### Little Bit 4: Different Kinds\n\nSometimes atoms of the same type have different numbers of neutrons. They are the same but a little different in weight.\n\n## Second Part: Elements\n\n### Little Bit 1: What is an Element?\n\nAn element is something made of only one type of atom. There are 118 kinds we know about.\n\n### Little Bit 2: A Big Chart\n\nThe big chart, called the periodic table, shows all the elements. It helps us see how elements are different or similar.\n\n### Little Bit 3: Mixing Up\n\nWhen elements come together in special ways, they make new things called compounds. If they just mix but don't join, that's a mixture.\n\n## Third Part: Playing Together\n\n### Topic 3.1: Sticky and Sharing\n\nSticky happens when little bits decide to give and take tiny parts. Sharing happens when they decide to use the same tiny parts together. Both these ways help bits stick together.\n\n### Topic 3.2: Mixing Up\n\nMixing up happens when different things come together and change. They can make new things by mixing.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nToday, we learned about tiny bits and how they work together. We talked about how they can stick together or mix up and make new things. This helps us understand new things we find out about.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 910, "idx": 457502, "original text": "This preview shows. page 1. Sign up. to. view the full content..

Field of the Invention\nThe present invention is directed to vehicle occupant restraint systems, and specifically to a pivoting arm that operates as a seat belt upper anchor point.\n2. Background of the Invention\nAn occupant restraint system in a vehicle such as an automobile, truck, van, helicopter, airplane or any other self-propelled vehicle is an expensive component, yet critical for safety. A popular restraint system is the three-point system including a lap belt secured at a first and second point and a torso belt secured at the second and a third point. The first point, in many designs, comprises a lap belt inertial retractor that removes slack from the lap belt and locks-up upon a sudden stop.\nThe second point typically is a tongue and buckle arrangement wherein the buckle is secured to the side of a seat opposite the inertial lap belt retractor and the tongue can be secured to and released from the buckle. Respective ends of the lap belt and torso belt are either secured to the tongue in a fixed tongue arrangement or, in a sliding tongue arrangement, the lap belt and torso belt comprise a continuous belt that can slide through an opening in the tongue. The third point in a three-point system typically includes an inertial retractor located in the lower portion of a B-pillar (in the case of an automobile, for example) and the torso belt passes through a D-ring typically attached to an upper part of the B-pillar. In some more recent designs, the torso belt retractor and D-ring are attached to the seat frame.\nMany recent restraining system designs provide for a vertically slideable D-ring (height adjuster) to accommodate passengers of varying size in addition to the one or both inertial retractors used to supply or take-up the appropriate amount of torso belt length to accommodate a specific individual. In any event, the constant sliding motion of the torso belt through this D-ring leads to undesirable wear on the torso belt itself, thereby decreasing the torso belt's ultimate strength and presenting undesirable appearance. Furthermore, in a fixed tongue arrangement, it is expensive to have two inertial retractors. Further still, a manual or motor driven D-ring height adjuster is expensive.", "hash": "66293dcd65f109228a129cc67ff0e963593ec7296b78c060a54a0ee2a7946b12"}

{"text": "Lesson: How to Understand Insurance Papers\n\nIntroduction:\nInsurance papers can be hard to read, but they are important to help us know about our insurance. Today, we will look at a paper about car bumps in big cities in AM city.\n\nSection 1: Knowing Insurance Words\n\nTopic 1: Important Words\n- Insurance Paper: A paper that tells about insurance problems in a place.\n- Bump: When cars hit each other.\n- How Often: How many times something happens.\n- Years Between Bumps: How many years usually go by before a bump happens in a city.\n- Chances: How likely something is to happen.\n\nNow, let's look at the insurance paper.\n\nTopic 2: Looking at the Paper\nThe insurance paper lists big cities in AM city and tells us how often car bumps happen there. In 2013, a city got a little worse at keeping cars from bumping. This means that the AN city had more car accidents compared to other places in the report.\n\nTo understand this, we see that the average time between accidents for AN city drivers is about 9 years, while the usual time is 10 years. This means that AN city drivers have accidents more often than drivers in other places.\n\nAlso, the report says that AN city drivers are more likely to have an accident than drivers from other places.\n\nLet's think about this in real life. Imagine you live in AN city and you want to buy car insurance. You read a report that says there are more car accidents in AN city than other places. This means you might have an accident if you have a car in AN city. So, it's smart to get car insurance to help you if you have an accident.\n\nWe learned how to read and understand insurance reports by looking at a report about car accidents in cities. By knowing what the words mean and using this information in real life, we can make good choices about our car insurance.\n\nWords to Know:\n- Insurance Report: A paper that tells about insurance problems in a certain place.\n- Accident: When two or more cars crash.\n- Often: How many times something happens in a time period.\n- Usual Time Between Accidents: The normal number of years between car accidents in a place.\n- Likely: How possible something is to happen.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 679, "idx": 352127, "original text": "Every year Allstate insurance company ranks the top 200 American cities based on the frequency of car collisions.

{"text": "Lesson: How to Buy a Tool for Cutting\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn this lesson, we will learn about the steps involved in buying a tool for cutting. This tool can be used to cut wood and trim branches. But, before you get one, there are several things to think about. We will talk about:\n\n1. Types of Cutting Tools\n2. Things to Think About When Buying a Cutting Tool\n3. How to Pick the Right Cutting Tool\n4. Safe Ways to Use a Cutting Tool\n5. Conclusion\n\n## Section 1: Types of Cutting Tools\n\nThere are two main types: one that uses fuel and one that uses electricity. The one that uses fuel is strong and can be used for a long time. It costs more than the one that uses electricity. The electric one is not as strong, but it is cheaper and simpler to use.\n\n## Section 2: Things to Think About When Buying a Cutting Tool\n\nWhen buying a cutting tool, you need to think about:\n\n1. Power: How strong the cutting tool is.\n2. Weight: How heavy the cutting tool is. Lighter ones are easier to handle.\n3. Size of the blade: This decides how deep you can cut. Bigger blades can cut bigger wood.\n4. Type of power: Does it need fuel or electricity?\n5. Price: The cost can be low or high.\n\n## Section 3: How to Pick the Right Cutting Tool\n\nPicking the right cutting tool depends on what you need. Here are some tips:\n\n1. Think about how big the wood you will cut is. This helps you pick the right size and power.\n2. Think about how heavy the tool is. If you will use it a lot, maybe get a lighter one.\n3. Decide if you want a fuel-based or electric tool. The fuel-based one is stronger but costs more and is harder to start. The electric one is weaker but cheaper and easier to use.\n4. Look at different kinds and brands to find the best one for you.\n\n## Section 4: Safe Ways to Use a Cutting Tool\n\nUsing a cutting tool safely means you need to follow safety rules. Here are some easy ways to use a tool safely:\n\n1. Wear clothes that keep you safe like gloves, special glasses, and ear covers.\n2. Make sure there is nothing and no one around the tree.\n3. Hold the tool tightly with both hands.\n4. Cut slowly and carefully.\n5. Do not cut tree parts that might fall on you or others.\n6. Always do what the tool's guide says.\n\n## Ending\n\nWhen you pick a tool, think about how strong it is, how heavy, how long the blade is, what kind of fuel it uses, and how much it costs.

Also, some places might not want to be known only by a code.\n\n**End Thought:** People have different ideas about using these special codes. It's important to think about the good and not so good points before deciding.\n\n## Words to Know\nSpecial Code: A number that helps us know a place.\nTalking and Thinking: Having discussions where we learn to think deeply about ideas.\nBig Ideas: Important thoughts that help us understand how to do things better.\nGood Choices: Decisions that help us and others.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 708, "idx": 118827, "original text": "National EMS Information System, Technical Assistance Center - Salt Lake City, UT.

{"text": "Lesson: How to Make a Yummy Drink\n\n## Chapter 1: What Goes Into Our Drink\n\nOur yummy drink is loved by many. It's made from water, grains, flowers, and tiny helpers. Making this drink is an old skill. We'll learn how to mix these things together and what tools we need.\n\n## Chapter 2: What We Need to Mix\n\nWe need four things to make our drink: water, grains, flowers, and tiny helpers. Water is very important because it's most of what's in our drink. Grains help make the sweet taste. Flowers make it taste a bit bitter but also tasty. Tiny helpers are very small, and they change the sweet part into bubbles and a special taste.\n\n## Chapter 3: Tools We Use\n\nTo make our drink, we need a few tools:\n1. A big pot for boiling water\n2. A big bowl for mixing grains and water\n3. Another bowl for taking grains out of the mix\n4. Another big pot for boiling the mix\n5. Something to make the mix cool\n6. A special jar for keeping the mix and tiny helpers\n7. A tool for checking how sweet the mix is\n8. A tool to check how hot the mix is\n9. A tool to check if the mix is sour\n10. Containers for keeping the drink when it's ready\n\n## Chapter 4: How We Make Our Drink\n\nMaking our drink has many steps and takes time. Here's what we do:\n\n1. Grinding: We make the grains into a powder called \"malt.\"\n2. Mixing: We mix malt with hot water to make something like oatmeal.\n3. Taking Out: We wash the oatmeal to get a sweet liquid.\n4. Boiling: We boil the liquid to make it safe and tasty.\n5. Adding Flowers: We put flowers in the boiling liquid for taste.\n6. Making Cool: We make the liquid cold for the next step.\n7. Adding Air: We mix air into the liquid to help tiny helpers.\n8. Changing: Tiny helpers work on the liquid for a few days.\n9. Waiting: We let the drink sit to get its taste for a while.\nLesson: Making Yummy Drinks\n\nIntroduction:\nToday, we'll learn about making yummy drinks. We'll talk about mixing ingredients and how to make sure your drink tastes good.\n\n## Chapter 5: The Steps to Make a Yummy Drink\n\nMaking a yummy drink is fun! Here are simple steps:\n\n1. Mixing: We mix things like juice and water.\n2. Sweetening: Sometimes, we add a little sugar to make it sweet.\n3. Tasting: We taste it to see if it's yummy.\n4. Sharing: We can share the drink with friends.\n\n## Chapter 6: Fun Examples\n\nLet's pretend to make a fruity drink using water, juice, and a little sugar.\n\n## Chapter 7: Fun Questions\n\n1. What can make your drink taste different?\n2. How does adding more juice change the taste?\n3. What happens if we don't add sugar?\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMaking drinks is fun!

In this lesson, we will learn how new people help cities grow and the problems they might have when they move to a new place.\n\nSection 1: New People and City Growth\n\nTopic 1: Why do cities need new people?\n- New people bring fresh ideas, different ways of living, and skills that make neighborhoods better and bring in new shops.\n- They also help more people live in the city, which helps the city earn more money and create jobs.\n- New people often work very hard and are brave in starting new businesses.\n\nTopic 2: Problems new people might face in cities\n- Sometimes, new people find it hard to understand and speak the language, which makes it tough for them to find jobs or get help.\n- Some new people might not have the needed school papers or job skills, so it's hard for them to work.\n- They might also be treated unfairly because of where they come from or how they look.\n\nSection 2: The Little Saigon Project\n\nTopic 1: The Little Saigon project was a special effort where new people worked together to build a community.\n- This project brought together people from VI city who shared the same culture and language.\n- They started a busy area with lots of shops that many people visited.\n- But, the project didn't last because it didnt get enough support from the city and nearby areas.\n\nTopic 2: Why didn't the Little Saigon project succeed?\n- One reason was that the people running it and the new community didn't talk well enough with each other.\n- The city didn't give enough help or things needed, which made it hard for the new people to do well.\n- Also, some people living nearby didn't like the changes and didn't want the area to become more mixed with different people.\n\nSection 3: Working Together for Success\n\nTopic 1: How can we make sure new people feel welcome in our cities?\n- Cities need to make rules and programs that make everyone feel included and welcome.\n- This means having classes to learn the language, training for jobs, and other help so new people can become part of the community.\n- Cities also need to stop any unfair treatment new people might face.\n\nTopic 2: What can we learn from the Little Saigon project?\n- When new people come together to make a lively community, it needs effort and support from everyone to work well.\n- We must all help to make a place where new people feel welcomed and supported.\n- By doing this, we can help our cities stay lively and grow.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, new people are very important for making cities lively with new ideas, ways of living, and skills.

People like to be around things that are true and clear. Being real makes people trust and stick with us.\n\n**Topic 3: Being Right for People**\n\nWe need to be just right for the people we want to meet.

After all, every city, airport and museum already has a brand. For better or worse, anyone who knows anything about your place has it pegged as \u2018something\u2019. The \u2018something\u2019 may create brand champions, disinterest or in some cases a perception that it should be avoided at all costs.\n\nUrban decay, either now or expected, is an obvious motivation. A better question is how do you avoid decay and what are the signs your city or place is vulnerable? A few simple questions will provide a strong directional answer.\n\nWarning Signs That Your Place May Need Help\n\nIs your population growing?\n\nDo graduates stay in the area, or leave for better opportunities?\n\nIs there high participation in public service (elections, city board meetings)?\n\nIf museums, parks, or live theatre are part of your community, is attendance growing?\n\nMuseums and Branding\n\nWhen Mark Albin, Newark Museum deputy director of marketing and public relations, started his new job, he faced low numbers all around \u2013 in awareness, attendance and funding. He walked into what seemed like an overwhelming challenge. But Mark knew, as Saba Salman, writing for The Guardian, knew: \u201cSuccessful branding (or rebranding) can turn a city or other location into a place where people want to live, work or visit. We\u2019ll visit the results of the Museum\u2019s efforts later in this article.\n\nSize Doesn\u2019t Matter\n\nDon\u2019t think that the size of your community somehow immunizes you against economic change. Global competition is not limited to big cities but directly affects all cities. The speed of globalization has to lead to a situation where the main competition for your city, museum or hotel is no longer twenty miles down the Interstate, but anywhere around the world. \u201cSuccessful branding\u201d, says Robert Jones, consultant director at international brand consultancy Wolff Olins, \u201ccan turn a city into a place where people want to live, work and visit. A strong identity is vital if you are vying for other places for attention in tourism and business or relaunching an area after a regeneration initiative.\u201d\n\nFive Benefits from Branding\n\nWe have found that the most often documented benefits places like yours have experienced are a result of their branding efforts. These are strong selling points to use when seeking support from those skeptical about the ROI of branding.\n\nAttract investors and visitors: An example is the The Newark Museum story. Three years into their branding program, they enjoyed a third straight year of double-digit percentage increases in attendance. Some shows generated even bigger gains. During the second year the spring exhibit generated 112% higher attendance than the previous year. Large increases in giving are expected now and in the future.\n\nEngender civic pride: There are two sides to this \u2013 first, when cities begin to lose their appeal the people who live there don\u2019t feel good about where they live. The other side of the card is a community that has enjoyed so much success that they have begun to lose their identity. The nice little town that everyone loved is now a place that undirected growth has changed. Branding provides a guide to maintaining identity.\n\nDisassociates your town from past failures, social or other problems:Look at Birmingham or Pittsburg. Chattanooga, now the knowledge-worker community, was known twenty years ago as the dirtiest city in America.\n\nEquips cities to compete for talent and jobs.Without a story relevant to today\u2019s economic needs your community will be ignored. Focusing on your strengths, your vision and crafting communications to the economic development ecosystem will provide you a seat at the table.\n\nProtects the city from future losses in jobs, talent, population and tax revenues. The outcome desired is similar in most places: Attract a talented workforce; create jobs; increase visitors; maintain those things we value about our community. (This article provides some examples of successful community rebranding.\n\nIf you are responsible for helping drive the economic success of a city, airport, museum or hotel you\u2019ve probably experienced challenges with funding. Specifically, problems getting the resources to support sufficient staff and budgets to retain a quality place-making consultant and branding organization. Hopefully, the examples given above will be useful when making the case for support. BBG is experienced at making the case for branding to boards, directors and committees.

{"text": "Lesson: Building Shapes and Sizes\n\n## Introduction\nIn building things like houses and schools, how big and what shape they are can make them cost less and be better for the earth.\n\n## Section 1: Simple Ideas\nWhen we build something, we look at how much outside area it has and how much space is inside. If a building does not need a lot of outside area but has a lot of space inside, it uses less stuff to make, which means it costs less and is good for our planet.\n\n## Section 2: Examples You Can See\nThink about a box. If we make the box taller but keep its other sides the same, the outside doesn't get much bigger, but the inside doesn't change. This helps save on what we need to build it, making it cheaper and better for the earth.\n\n## Section 3: Using What We Learn\nFor example, when making a place for sports, using a round top like a dome can help use less material. This round shape also makes it easier to hear inside and lets in more light, which is perfect for sports.\n\n## Words to Know\nOutside Area: The outside layer of a building.\nInside Space: The room inside a building.\nOutside/Inside Ratio: How the outside area compares to the inside space.\n\n## Ending Thoughts\nKnowing about how the shape and size of buildings affect what we need to build them helps us make them cost less and be nicer to look at and use.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 448, "idx": 233004, "original text": "On one hand, spherical domes have an economic and ecological surface-area-to-volume ratio.

People who know a lot about the topic make these collections to help us learn more about it. Today, we will learn what collections are, why they are important, and how they help us understand things better.\n\nCore Value:\nThe main idea is to learn why collections are important for understanding things and how they help us make good choices.\n\nSection 1: What are Collections?\nCollections are groups of things or information about a special topic. They can have writings, pictures, and facts about the topic. People who know a lot about the topic make these collections to help us learn more about it.\n\nSection 2: Why are Collections Important?\nCollections are important because they give us a big picture of a topic. By looking at collections, we can understand the topic better and make good choices with what we learn. Collections also help us see what is happening over time, which is helpful for people who make big decisions.\n\nSection 3: How to Use Collections\nTo use collections well, first, we need to pick a topic we want to learn more about. Then, we look for collections about that topic in places like libraries or on the internet. After finding them, we look at the information to understand the topic better.\n\nSection 4: An Example\nA good way to use collections is to look at information about things like how many people have jobs or what things cost.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Loans\n\n### Overview\nToday, we'll talk about a special kind of loan called a bond. Bonds are loans that places like towns or big groups use to get money for big jobs, like building roads or schools.\n\n### Section 1: What is a Bond?\nA bond is a big loan taken by a town or group to start a big job. They promise to give back the money after some time with a little extra as a \"thank you\" for the loan. Bonds help build things like roads, schools, and hospitals.\n\n### Section 2: Types of Bonds\nThere are a few kinds of bonds:\n\n1. General Obligation Bonds: These are common bonds. The town promises to pay back this bond no matter what.\n\n2. Revenue Bonds: These bonds get paid back from the money made by the project they help start, like money from a road that charges cars to use it.\n\n3. Grant Anticipation Notes (GANs): These bonds are taken out when a town thinks it will get some money from the government soon. They use the bond money first and then pay it back when the government money comes.\n\n4. Certificates of Participation (COPs): This is like renting out town property, and the rent money helps pay back the bond.\n\n### Section 3: Good and Bad Things About Bonds\nBonds can be great for getting money needed for big jobs that help everyone. But, there are some tricky parts too.\n\nPros:\n- Bonds give a lot of money at once, which helps start big jobs quickly.\n- They are good for long-lasting projects that make life better for a lot of people.\n\nCons:\n- Bonds mean the town owes money, which can be risky if things get expensive or the money situation gets bad.\n- Paying back a bond can cost a lot, especially if it's a lot of extra money (interest).\n\n### Section 4: Conclusion\nIn conclusion, bonds help places like towns and countries get money for big projects. They use this money to build things like roads, schools, and hospitals that help everyone. But, getting bonds can also be risky, so it's important to think about the good and bad things before deciding.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 4274, "idx": 240450, "original text": "AUSTIN \u2014 Billions of dollars for highways, student loans, lockups, parks and a slew of other projects will be on the line as Texas voters decide whether to add to the state's debt with four bond proposals.\n\nVoter approval is required because the Texas Constitution forbids most state debt. That means it must be amended for officials to issue general-obligation bonds backed by the state's full faith and credit.\n\nOn Nov. 6, voters will be asked to approve $9.7 billion in debt, including $6.75 billion in the four bond proposals. The other $3 billion in a separate proposal would fund a new foray into cancer research.\n\nBond advocates say the proposals serve the greater good and it makes sense to use bonds, with many going to infrastructure improvements that are traditionally funded by borrowing.\n\nBut some fiscal conservative groups are wary or outright opposed, including Americans For Prosperity-Texas, which is fighting every bond proposal on the ballot.\n\n\"Every government bond is a delayed tax increase. Every dollar spent by government and every bond issued by government equates to a job lost or a paycheck cut in the private sector,\" said Peggy Venable, director of the group.\n\nHighway funds\n\nThe biggest chunk of proposed new debt is in Proposition 12, which would authorize up to $5 billion for highway improvements and allow state road debt for the first time to be repaid with general revenue.\n\nTexas in the past has paid for roads with general revenue, and it already can issue road bonds repaid in other ways. This would combine the two.\n\nLawmakers haven't yet specified how the program would work and their next regular session isn't until 2009, so there could be a long lag before the bonds are issued. But backers say it's crucial that it be authorized, since gas tax revenue falls far short of meeting road needs and there's a battle over how much toll roads should be used to bridge the gap.\n\nBut Sal Costello, a critic of the Texas Department of Transportation who founded TexasTollParty.com, said he and likeminded Texans will fight the proposal because they believe TxDOT has an unhealthy interest in promoting toll roads.\n\n\"They will use every dollar they get to become a taxing authority and shift our public highways to tollways,\" he said.\n\n\"The passage of these bonds will mean we will be less dependent upon toll roads,\" Carona said.\n\nA catchall bond?\n\nIn contrast to one-issue propositions, there's something for almost everyone in Proposition 4, which would authorize up to $1 billion in bonds for construction and repairs for state facilities including a new Texas Youth Commission unit, repairs for state parks and the Battleship Texas, courthouse renovations and a new driver training facility for state troopers.\n\nVenable, however, gave a thumbs down: \"Though many of these projects appear deserving of some funding, with a state budget surplus, we should not be obligating bonds/future taxpayers to fund them.\"\n\nAddressing college costs\n\nProposition 2 would allow up to $500 million in bonds for student loans in a program that relies largely on loan repayment to support itself and won't tap into general revenue.\n\n\"Because the rising costs of attending college and the increasing number of college-bound students are quickly diminishing the program's financial reserves, this is critical,\" said Sen. Judith Zaffirini, D-Laredo, Senate Finance committee vice-chair.\n\nVenable said student loans are offered by others, adding, \"Taxpayers want college to be more affordable, and simply funding more student loans while allowing tuition to climb and requiring little fiscal accountability on how higher education dollars are spent is not in taxpayers' best interest.\"\n\nEvaluating each proposal\n\nProposition 16 would authorize an additional $250 million to build water and wastewater infrastructure for some poor areas.\n\nMichael Quinn Sullivan of Texans for Fiscal Responsibility said voters should carefully consider whether borrowing is appropriate when they look at each of the bond proposals.\n\n\"Bonds are tax increases on our children,\" he said. \" ... The question we have to ask ourselves is this: Is what I'm getting for this bond purchase ... going to have a sustained value and a public good that is greater than the final cost?\"", "hash": "459bfcf3a5ce0d4393cfeb7ece6086cdbcdbdf5c1e842803800c0984cbf0db2b"}

In this lesson, we will talk about how things work together to make something happen.\n\nSection 1: What is it About?\nWe will learn how certain things mix together and change. This helps people make better medicines.\n\nSection 2: Why is it Important?\nIt is important because it helps people understand how to make medicines work better and safer.\n\nSection 3: Examples\nFor example, some medicines help your heart beat nicely and keep you healthy. Scientists change a little part of the medicine to make it just right for your heart.\n\nAnother example is medicine for feeling happy when someone feels very sad. By changing a tiny bit of the medicine, it works better and makes people feel happier.\n\nSection 4: Conclusion\nKnowing how things mix and change helps scientists make good medicines.

We investigated the determinants of efficacy, affinity, and bias for three privileged structures for the D2R, exploring changes to linker length and incorporation of a heterocyclic unit. Profiling the compounds in two signaling assays (cAMP and pERK1/2) allowed us to identify and quantify determinants of biased agonism at the D2R. Substitution on the phenylpiperazine privileged structures (2-methoxy vs 2,3-dichloro) influenced bias when the thienopyridine heterocycle was absent. Upon inclusion of the thienopyridine unit, the substitution pattern (4,6-dimethyl vs 5-chloro-6-methoxy-4-methyl) had a significant effect on bias that overruled the effect of the phenylpiperazine substitution pattern. This latter observation could be reconciled with an extended binding mode for these compounds, whereby the interaction of the heterocycle with a secondary binding pocket may engender bias.", "hash": "f7e30298802c83cf35962727cb884b05687f771f3905407a4b4e63483ac41d60"}

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Important Ideas\n\nIntroduction:\nIn this lesson, we will talk about how to find important ideas in a story. Important ideas are the main thoughts and rules that help us choose what to do and think. By finding and understanding these ideas, we can better know what the story is trying to tell us and make good choices.\n\nSection 1: Finding Important Ideas\n\nThe first step in finding important ideas in a story is to see what the writer thinks is important. We can do this by looking for special words or lines that show what the writer believes. For example, in a story, the writer talks about a person who makes tiny, beautiful art from big books.\n\nQuestions:\n- What do you think the writer believes about the person who makes art from books?\n- How does the writer feel about the person's art-making?\n\nSection 2: Knowing What the Story Tells Us\n\nAfter finding the important ideas, we can start to understand the story's message. Here, the writer seems to really like the person's art-making. The writer also thinks that the usual way of making art might not be enough today.\n\nQuestions:\n- What message do you think the writer is sharing with their words?\n- How does talking about the person who makes art from books help share this message?\n\nSection 3: Using Important Ideas in New Ways\n\nAfter we know and understand the important ideas, we can use them in new ways. For example, if you were writing a story about someone who is good at making new things, you could use the ideas from this story to help you.\n\nQuestions:\n- How could you use the ideas of making new things in your own stories or art?\n- Can you think of other times when these ideas might be helpful?\n\nConclusion:\nTo finish, by finding and understanding the important ideas in a story, we can better know its message and use these ideas in new situations. By practicing this, we can become better at reading and thinking.\n\nGlossary:\n- Important ideas: Main thoughts and rules that help us decide what to do.\n- Viewpoint: The way someone thinks about something.\n- Making new things: Creating something different or new.\n\n**Glossary:**\n- Fun guessing games: These are games where we use guessing to find answers.\n- Jumping games: These are special guessing games that help us learn about mixing things like water and colors.\n- Talking areas: Places where things can talk to each other.\n- Playful pattern games: These are games that help us see how things change and move.\n\n**Self-Debate Discussion:** Can there be problems when we play guessing games to learn about many things?

{"text": "Lesson: The Mystery Space Engine\n\nIntroduction:\nThe Mystery Space Engine is a space idea that has made many scientists talk a lot. It tries to push space ships with special waves. We will learn about what it is, what it might do, and why people talk about it so much.\n\nCore Value:\nLearning about a special space engine helps us understand why some people are not sure it works.\n\nSection 1: How the Space Engine Works\n\nA long time ago, a smart person named Roger thought of a new kind of space engine. This engine works by moving light waves inside a big cone. When the waves move, they push the cone and make it go forward.\n\nThis space engine is special because it doesn't need fuel like most engines that go to space. Instead, it just uses light waves. Some smart people don't believe this can work because it's very different from what they know.\n\nSection 2: What We Could Do with the Space Engine\n\nIf this new engine works, it could change how we travel in space. We could go very far without needing a lot of fuel. This means we could explore more of space and it wouldn't cost as much.\n\nThis engine could also help satellites around Earth move better without extra fuel. This is good for when we need satellites to be in the perfect spot.\n\nSection 3: Why Some People Doubt the Space Engine\n\nEven though this engine could do great things, not everyone believes it can work. They think it doesn't follow the rules of how things usually work in space. Some also say we need more tests to really know if the engine can do what it promises.\n\nMany tests have been done, but they don't all agree. This makes some people think we shouldn't spend more time on this engine.\n\nWords to Know:\n- Light waves: Light that moves and can sometimes be used to push things.\n- Engine: A machine that makes things move.\n- Satellite: A machine that flies around Earth to watch or send signals.\n\nConclusion:\nThe space engine is an interesting idea that could change how we travel to far places in space.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Tiny Bugs\n\n## Section 1: Simple Ideas\nIn this part, we talk about tiny bugs called bed bugs. We learn about:\n\n1. What are bed bugs?\n2. Why are bed bugs not good?\n3. How do bed bugs move around?\n4. How can you tell if you have bed bugs?\n\n**What are bed bugs?**\nBed bugs are tiny bugs that drink blood. They are as small as apple seeds and can be brown or red. You can find them everywhere in the world, and they often show up where people travel a lot.\n\n**Why are bed bugs not good?**\nBed bugs make you itchy and can give you red spots on your skin. They can make you feel scared or worried because they are hard to see and can be many.\n\n**How do bed more around?**\nBed bugs can move from one person to another, but they usually travel on things like furniture, clothes, and bags. They can also hide and move through small cracks.\n\n**How can you tell if you have bed bugs?**\nIf you are itchy or see little red spots on your bed sheets, you might have bed bugs. They can also make a room smell sweet and funny.\n\n## Section 2: Stories and Examples\nHere, we tell stories about finding and stopping bed bugs. We learn:\n\n1. How can you find bed bugs?\n2. How can you stop bed bugs?\n3. What should you not do if you have bed bugs?\n\n**How can you find bed bugs?**\nYou can look for bed bugs by checking your bed with a light. Some people use special dogs that can smell the bugs, or special lights that make the bugs easier to see.\n\n**How can you stop bed bugs?**\nTo stop bed bugs, people use sprays, warm air, or cold treatments. It is good to use many ways at the same time to make sure all the bugs go away.\n\n**What should you not do if you have bed bugs?**\nWhen trying to get rid of bed bugs, don't just clean one spot. Make sure to check everywhere they might hide. Always use enough spray and do more than one cleaning to be sure.\n\n## Section 3: Thinking Together\nIn this part, we think together to learn how to solve problems. Today we are learning about tiny bugs called bed bugs and how to stop them from spreading.\n\n**When should we use bug sprays for bed bugs?**\nBug sprays should only be used with other ways to control bed bugs. They should not be the only way we try to stop them because some bed bugs might not get hurt by the spray.\n\n**Should house owners clean up bed bugs in their buildings?**\nHouse owners should clean up bed bugs in their buildings, especially if there are many bugs or if many people are bothered by them. But, they might not need to clean up if there is just one little bug problem.\n\n**How can we keep bed bugs from spreading in places we all go to?**\nHere are some tips to keep bed bugs away when we are in places like hotels:\n- Look for bed bugs in the room.\n- Put bags on a stand, not on the floor or bed.\n- Don't put bags on beds or sofas.\n- Keep things off the floor.\n- Check used furniture before we bring it home.\n- Put covers on mattresses and pillows.\n- Clean often and check the cleaner bag for bed bugs.\n- Close any small holes in walls and floors.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWe learned how to find bed bugs and how to keep them away.

{"text": "Lesson: How to Make Simple Films\n\nIntroduction:\nSimple films are thin sheets used to hold special ingredients for health. These sheets melt in your mouth and are easy to use. Today, we will learn how to make these thin films.\n\nMaterials and Steps:\nTo make these films, you need a few materials like plastic types. The steps include picking the right materials, making the film, and sealing it.\n\n1. Choosing materials: The usual materials are different kinds of safe plastics. [PARAGRAPH]These materials are chosen because they are biocompatible, non-toxic, and have good mechanical properties.\n\n2. Fabrication of the film: The film is typically fabricated using a solvent casting and drying process. In this process, the polymer is dissolved in a suitable solvent, and the solution is cast onto a flat surface. The solvent is then evaporated, leaving behind a thin film of the polymer.\n\n3. Sealing of the film: After the film has been fabricated, it is sealed using a heat sealing process. This involves heating the edges of the film to a high temperature, causing the polymer to melt and fuse together. This creates a strong and durable seal that holds the film together.\n\nBenefits of Disintegratable Films:\nThere are several benefits to using disintegratable films for drug delivery, including:\n\n1. Convenience: Disintegratable films are easy to use and can be administered without the need for water or other liquids. This makes them ideal for use in situations where water may not be available.\n\n2. Accuracy: The films are designed to release the active ingredient at a controlled rate, ensuring that the correct dose is delivered to the patient.\n\n3. Comfort: The films are designed to disintegrate quickly and release the active ingredient in a way that minimizes discomfort to the mucosal surfaces.\n\nConclusion:\nIn this lesson, we have learned about the materials and manufacturing process involved in making disintegratable films for drug delivery. We have also discussed the benefits of using these films, including their convenience, accuracy, and comfort. By understanding the process of making disintegratable films, we can appreciate the importance of these films in modern drug delivery systems.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 3387, "idx": 154935, "original text": "Disintegratable films can provide a convenient and effective delivery vehicle for delivering active ingredients, such as pharmaceutical compounds and breath freshening or other cosmetic agents, to the mucosa of humans and animals. Upon placement onto the mucosa of, for example, the oral cavity, the film disintegrates and releases the active ingredient. However, the film should have adequate strength for processing and use as a unit dosage form, and also ensure appropriate release of the active ingredient while eliminating or minimizing any undue discomfort to mucosal surfaces.\nU.S. Pat. Nos. 4,029,757; 4,029,758; and 4,031,200 refer to pharmaceutical dosage units formed from a multiplicity of edible webs that are sealed. One layer is fabricated by \u201cfan folding\u201d and compressing a continuous web structure, and subsequently sealing the composite into a geometric shape. The films rely on a complex process of fan folding and sealing to maintain the pharmaceutical compound internally within the multilayered dosage form.\nU.S. Re Pat. No. 33,093 refers to controlled-release medicament-containing single or multi-layer thin films for intra-oral drug delivery. The thin film includes a polymeric matrix layer of 20-93% by weight of a hydroxypropyl cellulose having a molecular weight above 100,000; 5-60% of a homopolymer of ethylene oxide having a molecular weight from 3,000,000-5,000,000; 0-10% of a water insoluble polymer selected from the group consisting of ethyl cellulose, propyl cellulose, polyethylene and polypropylene; 2-10% of a plasticizer; and a pharmaceutically effective amount of medicament. The controlled-release films of U.S. Re. Pat. No. 33,093 are relatively slow to dissolve/disintegrate in the mouth.\nU.S. Pat. Nos. 5,984,430 (Reexamination Certificate issued Mar. 4, 2003); 6,177,096; and 6,284,264 refer to oral films for the delivery of pharmaceutical and cosmetic compounds. The compositions referred to in these patents contain a water-soluble polymer, a polyalcohol, a surfactant, and a pharmaceutically or cosmetically active ingredient. According to these patents, inclusion of the surfactant component imparts \u201cinstant wettability\u201d followed by rapid disintegration of the film when placed into an aqueous environment such as the oral cavity.\nU.S. Pat. No. 4,136,145 refers to a pharmaceutical unit dosage composition in which the pharmaceutically active medicament is uniformly dissolved or suspended in a flexible, water-soluble film carrier. The compositions include various drug compounds, water-soluble polymers, surfactants, release agents, parting compounds, and fillers.\nEach film delivery system can be characterized by its film strength and its disintegration profile (the speed at which the film will disintegrate in an aqueous media such as saliva). Surfactants have been used to affect the disintegration speed and decrease the time required for complete film disintegration and thus release of the active ingredient. The present invention provides disintegratable film compositions that rapidly disintegrate upon application to mucosal surfaces and which, at the same time, have sufficient film strength without requiring the use of any surfactant. While a surfactant is optional in certain embodiments of the present invention, as described below, other embodiments are surfactant-free or substantially free of surfactants.", "hash": "41a8ddab4b1bc88f4d545ddf699263d8bdcb625e8e32bee26e45e65a038da001"}

I\u2019m planning to build something else, and then I find a completely different kit in front of me, partially assembled. It\u2019s a weird experience. Well, weird in a \u201chey, that\u2019s different\u201d sort of way. Not weird like \u201chey, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re not supposed to have a thumb there\u201d kind of way. (Just to clarify.)\n\nI\u2019d gone into my closet o\u2019 too many kits, intending to get the Airfix 1/48 Boulton Paul Defiant off the shelf. While I had no intention of starting it immediately, I did want to take a look at it again to familiarize myself with the parts, the build sequence, and generally start formulating a plan for a soon planned build of it. I\u2019d previously built the kit, so I had a few ideas of ways I might improve the process.\n\nAs I stared at the stacks of kits, I noticed the Hobbyboss 1/48 F8F-2 Bearcat. I\u2019d forgotten I even had it. This too was another kit I\u2019d built previously. I recalled how much I really enjoyed the build. So I grabbed the kit, set it on the model desk, and opened it up to \u201clook at the parts\u201d.\n\nAbout an hour later, all of the major subassemblies were built and ready for paint. I\u2019m not sure what happened in that hour. I don\u2019t really recall it\u2026 bright lights were overhead, an optivisor was involved, some cutting instruments, and various glues. I think coffee was present. I\u2019m not saying there was some form of alien involvement, because it all happened so quickly. All I can say for sure was it was all a haze.\n\nBut there was the evidence.\n\nOh well\u2026 sometimes you have to go with it.\n\nThe interior parts were given a coat of my homemade US Interior Green, which was mixed from Tamiya\u2019s XF-4 Yellow Green (or Green Yellow, depending on your hemisphere and local regulations), and some XF-69 NATO Black. With that on, some sponge chipping was added using some form of lighter green that I can\u2019t recall as I write this, and then some Ammo of Mig Chipping color paint. Various bits were painted black, and then some white dots added.\n\nThe instrument panel has a clear insert for the instrument dials, and the idea that Hobbyboss had in mind was to place the provided instrument decal behind the clear piece, and paint the face of the part black. I took the shortcut- glued it all together, painted it black, added the decal to the surface, and called it \u201cgood enough\u201d.\n\nAs the kit does not come with any belts, I added some prepainted photoetch parts from Eduard that were actually designed for the Kittyhawk F2H Banshee. But they\u2019re both Navy, both blue, so\u2026 I declared it workable.\n\nTest fitting it all reminded me why I originally liked this kit- it just fits. The photo below of the dry assembly uses only a few pieces of tape to hold things together. Everything else is a dry fit of the major subassemblies. There will be a bit of sanding to remove the various seam lines, but the gaps are just about non-existent. I did have to sand down a few ejection imperfections here and there, but nothing too egregious. (Word points! Yeah!)\n\nI decided to build the model with only the centerline fuel tank and the wing pylons, minus armament. So many reference photos show the Bearcat with only the bomb pylons and rocket stubs on the wings, void of any things that go boom. Building it this way accomplished several things. First, it filled in the pre-drilled holes for all of those parts. Second, it avoided the need to assemble and paint the bombs and rockets. And tertiarily, it was simpler. For the rocket \u201cstubs\u201d, I simply cut away the parts molded into the kit\u2019s rockets. (If you use this method- take note: the forward and aft stubs are different heights.)\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to like about this kit. The parts count is fairly low, so there\u2019s not much fiddliness involved. It fits very nicely together, and has enough detail to please most modelers. Being Hobbyboss, it does have its shape issues, mostly with regards to the cowling. (According to the experts, of course. It looks fine tome.) In my previous build of the kit, I\u2019d surveyed ten modelers with reasonably low IPMS membership numbers, and 9 out of 10 recognized it as a Bearcat when compared to a can of Chef Boyardee Ravioli, a pair of scissors, and a bag of frozen peas. (The 10th guy got hung up on how the ravioli was not authentic, and the can was not shaped properly for optimum flavor preservation\u2026 sigh.) So if you do choose to build this kit, you should be able to recognize it for what it is. (A plastic toy\u2026. \ud83d\ude00 )\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a simple, low drama build, or perhaps you would like to dip your toe into the world of aircraft modeling, I can highly recommend this kit.\n\nWith a long holiday weekend ahead, I hope to have it finished up next week!\n\nI love simple. I don\u2019t want to have to futz around with a ton of filling, filing, and sanding. So boring. And when it comes to accuracy; if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck\u2026well there you have it.\nI also have a ton of aftermarket crap that I never use, and if I use anything it\u2019s just the belts. I don\u2019t know why I bother. I will get a new set of decals, but besides decals and belts, it\u2019s OOB for me.\n\nOne last thing. I love the way you write too. Not too serious, instructive, always with a sense of humor, and from the point of view of someone that just wants to build models. That\u2019s me!\nModeling takes patience, but not 12-year-old scotch patience.", "hash": "444acde85f68ae663f60ac89125f7c2d7db63f52d59fc349ea7453ab6ea06ea3"}

Doctors teach kids and parents how to look for signs of a bad boo-boo.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n1. A kid goes home after getting their belly fixed. The doctors teach them to look for redness, a puffy spot, or yucky stuff coming out from where the cut is. They also learn how to tell doctors about any changes using a special form they get in the mail.\n\n2. This kid fills out the form every week to tell if their boo-boo is okay or if something new or bad happens. If something is wrong, the nurse calls to help.\n\n3. Another kid went home after fixing their chest. They learned what to watch for but didn't notice the signs that their boo-boo was not okay. They didnt tell the doctors in time, and the germ-fighting team learned too late. The kid needed more help because the boo-boo got really bad.\n\n4. Yet another kid went home after getting a new hip. They did everything right - filled out their weekly form and told the doctors about any changes in their boo-boo.\n\n3. Being mean with words: This means when someone uses words to be very unkind, like saying mean things or making someone feel scared.\n\n4. Feeling hurt inside: This is when someone makes another person feel bad inside, like when they are teased or picked on.\n\n5. Being unkind online: This happens when someone is mean to others on the internet or on phones.\n\n### Section 3: Why People Are Mean\nSometimes, people are mean for reasons like:\n\n1. Not having enough money\n2. When not everyone is treated the same\n3. Feeling very sad or using bad things like drugs\n4. Not learning enough at school\n5. Sad things that happened to their families a long time ago\n\n## Chapter 2: Staying Safe\n\n### Section 1: Ways to Stay Safe\nHere are some ways to help you stay safe:\n\n1. Look around: Always know what's happening around you and stay away from places that are not safe.\n\n2. Listen to your feelings: If a place or person makes you feel scared, trust yourself and leave.\n\n3. Tell someone where you go: Always let someone you trust know where you are and when you will be back.\n\n4. Carry a whistle: A whistle can help you make noise and get help if you are in trouble.\n\n5. Learn how to stay safe: Knowing simple ways to keep yourself safe can help if someone tries to hurt you.\n\n### Section 2: Helping Each Other\nWe can all help keep each other safe by:\n\n1. Being a good friend: Helping and being a good example can help others feel happy and safe.\n\n2. Joining fun activities after school: Being in a safe place after school can keep you and your friends safe.\n\n3. Learning new things for jobs: Learning skills for work can help you and your friends have a good future.\n\n4. Working together with helpers: Getting to know people who help keep us safe, like police, can make everyone feel safer.\n\n### Section 3: Making Rules to Stay Safe\nMaking new rules can help everyone be safer:\n\n1. Rules about guns: Having strong rules about guns can keep them away from places they shouldn't be.\n\n2. Helping everyone feel better: Making sure everyone can get help if they feel sad or mad can keep us all safer.\n\n3. Making school better: Helping everyone learn and do well at school can make life better for everyone. Making rules better in helping people not do bad things again can make places safer.\n\n## Chapter 3: Ending\nBeing safe is tricky. We need many ways to keep everyone safe. By knowing about bad actions, finding out why they happen, and using good ways to stop them, we can make all places safer and nicer for all.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1770, "idx": 153818, "original text": "Post-discharge surgical site surveillance: does patient education improve reliability of diagnosis?\nPost-discharge surgical infection surveillance by patients remains an integral part of many infection control programmes despite proven unreliability. We attempted to improve the validity of patient recognition of signs and symptoms of wound infection and post-discharge postal questionnaire responses through specific education prior to discharge. In total, 588 patients were studied after random assignment into two intervention groups, one of which received relevant education. Both groups were followed for four weeks post-operatively, with features of infection assessed weekly by experienced infection control nurses (ICNs) and by patient responses to routine postal questionnaires. Those patients who received education demonstrated a significantly poorer correlation with ICN diagnosis compared to the non-educated group (Kappa 0.69 and 0.81 respectively, P=0.05). Both patient groups achieved the same sensitivity for recall (83.3%), with high specificity demonstrated by both groups [educated (93.7%); non-educated (98.1%)]. The positive predictive value was 65.2% for the educated group and 83.3% for the non-educated patient group. When infected wounds identified by patients were examined for the proportion that were overdiagnosed, the excess of SSI identified by the educated patient group was 44.4% and by the non-educated group 16.7%. These results suggest that pre-discharge education causes patients to overdiagnose clinical features of wound infection and fails to improve the validity of diagnosis. This outcome further questions the value of post-discharge infection rates obtained by patient self-assessment as a measure of quality of performance.", "hash": "3119e68567a6a9ca00e549963698d34685ca08a692e9cead1bd56dac56054a89"}

{"text": "Lesson: Let's Learn About Computers\n\n## Section 1: Fun Ideas About Computers\n\n**Topic 1: What is Computer Learning?**\nComputer learning is when we make, check, and fix programs that work on computers or tablets. We write special steps, solve problems, make things work better, and add fun new things to programs.\n\n**Topic 2: Kinds of Computer Programs**\nWe can make different kinds of programs:\n\n1. Programs for Computers: We make programs that you can use on computers.\n2. Programs for Phones: We make programs for phones and tablets.\n3. Internet Programs: We make programs that you can use on the internet.\n4. Games: We make fun games you can play on computers, game machines, or phones.\n\n## Section 2: Easy Projects\n\n**Topic 1: Making a Simple Game**\nLet's make a simple game where we add two numbers. We will use a computer to help us put the numbers together.\n[PARAGRAPH]print(\"The sum of\", num1, \"and\", num2, \"is\", total)\n```\n\nIn this example, we first import the `int` function to convert the input values to integers. Then we prompt the user to enter two numbers and use the `+` operator to add them together. Finally, we print out the result using the `print` function.\n\n**Topic 2: Debugging**\nDebugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software code. When a bug is found, developers use various tools and techniques to identify the root cause of the problem and implement a fix.\n\nFor example, let's say we have a program that is supposed to multiply two numbers entered by the user, but it doesn't work correctly. We can use a debugger to step through the code line by line and see where the error occurs. Once we find the error, we can fix it and retest the program to ensure it works correctly.\n\n## Section 3: Real-World Scenarios\n\n**Topic 1: Software Development in Business**\nSoftware development plays a crucial role in businesses of all sizes. Companies use custom software to automate processes, manage data, and improve efficiency. For example, a small business might develop a program to track inventory, while a large corporation might develop a software platform to manage its global operations.\n\n**Topic 2: Open Source Software**\nOpen source software is software whose source code is available for anyone to view and modify. This allows developers to collaborate and improve the software over time. Examples of open source software include Linux, which is a free operating system, and Mozilla Firefox, which is a free web browser.\n\n## Glossary\n\n**Term 1: Source Code**\nSource code is the human-readable form of a computer program that is written in a programming language.

{"text": "Lesson: About Making Things Work\n\n### Section 1: Simple Ideas\n\nA power helper is a thing that changes one kind of energy into another so toys and tools can work. It makes sure the energy is steady because toys and tools need steady energy to run right.\n\n### Section 2: Easy Examples\n\nLet's think about a power helper that changes energy from the wall into a kind that toys can use. First, it makes the big energy smaller. Then, it changes the energy to a kind that's right for toys. Lastly, it makes sure the energy stays the same, even if it starts to change.\n\nTo see if the power helper is doing its job, you can use a special tool to check the energy. If the energy is just right, the power helper is working well.\n\n### Section 3: Fun Questions\n\nWhy do we use a power helper instead of plugging toys directly into the wall?\n\nAnswer: A power helper is good because it stops the big energy from the wall from breaking the toys. It makes sure the toys get the right kind of energy they need to work well.

The power supply is used as a gauge to make sure the piece of work the person has completed is able to withstand certain amounts of voltage and current load. Tests are generally conducted by applying different amounts of voltage to the piece of completed work a little at a time to ensure the stability of the circuit the individual has created. These types of power supplies also are used by hobbyists to power small electronics requiring variable voltage and by tattoo artists to power tattooing guns.\n\nAim of power supply .\n\nA power supply is an electronic device that supplies electric energy to an electrical load . The power supply converts the ac voltage to dc voltage by many steps . There is a lot of power supply type for many value but the mostly used in the laboratories is the variable power supply because We can eliminate many devices in a single device whose value depends on the value required for use .\n\nFor our project we will use the next Components.\n\n( 6 pieces of diodes ) type 1N4001\n\n2200 micro farad Capacitor .\n\n2.2 micro farad Capacitor\n\n47 micro farad Capacitor .\n\n220 \u03a9 Resistor .\n\n5 k \u03a9 Variable Resistor .\n\nRegulator type ( LM317 )\n\nTransformer which transfer from ( 220 to 24 V ) .\n\nDigital Voltmeter\n\nIn here we have the power supply picture that we made like it .\n\nAt first we draw the circuit in ( Proteus 8 Demonstration ) program .\n\nFrom this drawing we checked the circuit if its working or not .\n\nTheoretical information about variable power supply :\n\n1-STEP in the photo we have alternating voltage source has value 310 Vmax (in digital oscilloscope) equal 220 Vrms (in ac voltmeter point B)and this voltage value mostly used in turkey . after transform we will get another value this value dependent on transformer her the transformer has ratio 1/9=0.11 .\n\nso Vs=Vp*1/9=220Vrms*0.11=24.2Vrm (as we can see in ac voltmeter point A and Vsmax = Vpmax*0.11=310*0.11=34.1Vmax (as we can see in digital oscilloscope channel A).\n\nTHE FULL-WAVE RECTIFIERS:\n\nWe have two ways to type of rectifier 1-half wave rectifier 2- full wave rectifier here we used the full wave rectifier because in this way we will not lose any current and we will use the positive and negative current as we will see.\n\nDuring the period T0 to T/2 the polarity of the input is as shown The resulting polarities across the ideal diodes are also shown to reveal that D2 and are conducting while D1 and D4 are in the \u201coff\u201d state.\n\nAnd the output will be as shown\n\nDuring the period T/2 to T the polarity of the input is as shown The resulting polarities across the ideal diodes are also shown to reveal that D1 and D4 are conducting while D2 and D3are in the \u201coff\u201d state.\n\nAnd the output will be as shown\n\nwe will get to alternative voltage Only positive polarity as shown.\n\nFILTERING : to get DC voltage, we must work to make no difference between Vmax and Vmin so here we will use capacitor because the capacitor has a certain voltage so that when the voltage exceeds the specified amount the capacitor starts charging and when the voltage drops below a certain amount the capacitor works as a battery so we will get voltage as shown.\n\nVoltage Regulators: Three-terminal regulators designed for fixed output voltages require only external capacitors to complete the regulation portion of the power supply. Filtering is accomplished by a large-value capacitor between the input voltage and ground. The LM317 Voltage regulators are also available in circuit configurations that allow the user to set the output voltage to a desired regulated value. The LM317, for example, can be operated with the output voltage regulated at any setting over the range of voltage from 1.2 to 37 V. The regulator will make the Oscillator voltage and it is dependent on the variable resistor in the circuit so that V0=1.25*((R1+Rv)/R1). If we assume Rv (variable resistor) is zero so we will get V0=1.25*((R1+R2)/R1=1.25*((220+0)/220)=125V. This is the minimum value we can get\n\nAnd If we assume Rv (variable resistor) 2500 so we will get V0=1.25*((R1+R2)/R1=1.25*((220+2500)/220)=15.45V.\n\nAnd If we assume Rv (variable resistor) 5000 (the maximum value of our resistor) so V0=1.25*((R1+R2)/R1=1.25*((220+5000)/220)=29.6V.\n\nAfter know how circuit works and drawing it on Proteus we will connect all components on breadboard .\n\nAs we can show in the last figure we put all components on breadboard and the circuit works well . Now we will make printed circuit .\n\nprint out of our PCB layout using A4 photo paper/glossy paper\n\n.\n\nIron It\n\nAfter ironing, place printed plate in Luke warm water for around 10 minutes.", "hash": "4f318e90890af038638424e67c1c45b9adefe8015543cd3fa0ac41b66434d61b"}

This makes it easy to do the jobs well and keep things tidy.\n\n## Section 1: Why do we use Task Helpers?\n\nTask Helpers are great because:\n\n1. They make jobs easy: Task Helpers help us see what we need to do clearly, so our work is neat and easy to understand.\n\n2. They help us keep track: When we have helpers, its easy to fix problems without messing up everything else.\n\n3. They can be used again: Once we have a Task Helper, we can use it many times. This saves us time.\n\n4. They help us organize: Task Helpers let us split big jobs into little parts that we can work on one at a time.\n\n## Section 2: How do Task Helpers work?\n\nTask Helpers work by taking little bits of information and using them to finish a job. They start and end with a curly hug {}.\n\nFor example, we can have a helper to add numbers:\n\n```\nint add(int first, int second) {\n    return first + second;\n}\n```\n\nHere, the `add` helper takes two numbers (`first` and `second`) and tells us their total.\n\n## Section 3: Fun example with Task Helpers\n\nImagine we want to find out how big a space is. We can make a helper called `findSpace` that uses the length and width to tell us the size.\n\n```\nfloat findSpace(float length, float width) {\n    return length * width;\n}\n```\n\nThen we use `findSpace` to find the size of a space.\n\n```\nfloat space = findSpace(5, 10);\n```\n\nHere, we use the `findSpace` helper with numbers `5` and `10`, and it tells us how big the space is.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTask Helpers are very important for people who make things.

{"text": "**Lesson:** How to Understand Stories\n\n**Introduction:** People hear many stories every day. Some stories are true, and some are not. It's good to learn how to tell if a story is fair and true.\n\n**Section 1: What is Fairness?**\n\nFairness means liking or not liking something or someone. When someone tells a story, they might like one thing more than another. This can make the story not so fair.\n\n**Question:** What are ways stories can be unfair?\n**Answer:** Stories can be unfair when they only talk about the most exciting parts, only tell some of the truths, or try to make you like one side more.\n\n**Section 2: Looking at Stories**\n\nTo understand if a story is fair, think about who is telling the story, the words they use, and what they tell you.\n\n**Question:** What is a fact? What is an opinion?\n**Answer:** A fact is something true that you can check. An opinion is what someone thinks or feels. Stories have both, and knowing which is which helps you understand the story better.\n\n**Question:** How can you know if a story is fair?\n**Answer:** You can tell if a story is fair by listening to the words used. If the words make one side look very good or very bad, the story might not be fair. Also, if the story leaves out important parts, it might not be fair.\n\n**Section 3: Using What You Learn**\n\nNow that you know how to look at stories, try it out! When you hear a story, think about these things:\n\n1. Who is telling the story? Is it someone you trust?\n2. The words used: Do the words make one side look much better or much worse?\n3. What is being told: Are all the important parts of the story included?\n4.

{"text": "Lesson: Getting Metals from Rocks\n\nIntroduction:\nSome rocks have metals inside them that we can take out and use for making things. Today, we will learn about how to get these metals from the rocks.\n\nSection 1: How We Get Metals from Rocks\n\nTo get metals from rocks, we need to do a few steps like digging, cleaning, and making the metal pure. Let's talk about these steps.\n\nDigging:\nDigging is when we take the rocks out of the ground. We can dig on the ground's surface or deep down under it.\n\nCleaning:\nAfter we get the rocks, we need to clean them to get the metals out. We smash the rocks and wash them to find the metals.\n\nMaking Metal Pure:\nOnce we have the metal pieces, we make them pure. We heat the metals until they melt, then we clean them to take out anything that's not metal.\n\nSection 2: A Special Way to Get Metals\n\nThere's a special way to get metals without digging big holes. This section talks about the good things and the hard things about this way.\n\nGood Things:\n- It's nicer to nature.\n- It costs less money.\n- It works in places where digging big holes is hard.\n\nHard Things:\n- We need special tools and knowledge.\n- It's hard to tell how much metal we will get.\n\nWays to Do It:\n1. Heap Leaching: We put the rocks in big piles and pour a special liquid over them. This liquid takes the metal out, and then we collect it.\n2. In-Situ Smelting: We heat the rocks right where they are to get the metal. We then collect the metal gas and clean it to get the metal.\n3. In-Situ Electrolysis: We use electricity to pull the metal out of the rocks.\n\nSection 3: Using These Metals\n\nNow, let's see how we use these methods to get metals from rocks for real things.\n\nExample: Getting Uranium\nUranium is a metal used for energy and some powerful tools. We can get it from rocks using the heap leaching method.\n\nIn a place in WY state, they get a metal from rocks without digging.\n\nConclusion:\nIn this lesson, we learned how people get valuable metals from rocks and clean them to use. We saw how they get these metals without digging and the good and tricky parts of this method. Knowing about these ways helps us think of new ideas to get metals from the ground.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 2916, "idx": 337352, "original text": "This invention relates to the recovery of valuable metals and mineral salts from mineral bearing host rocks and to the purification of mineral salts formed by evaporation of natural brines.\nValuable metals are found in nature in mineral-bearing host rocks. Ores must be processed physically and chemically to produce commercial products. Normally the ores are mined underground, and then refined in factories on the surface. In order to economize on the mining cost and to minimize the environmental impacts, in-situ mining methods have been devised.\nIn recovery by in-situ mining of valuable metals such as the Carlin (Nevada) type of organic-rich metalliferous rocks containing appreciable amounts of disseminated gold and associated metals such as mercury, arsenic, antimony etc., or metalliferous black-shale deposits, containing uranium, gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, and nickel etc., the problem is two-fold: the host rock has to be oxidized and it has to be made permeable for leaching solution.\nProcesses are known for recovery of disseminated metals in organic-rich shale, such as gold in deposits of the Carlin type, where ores are mined and milled before they are subjected to oxidation at high temperature are known. These process are commonly referred to as \"shale-burning\". Co-pending patent application Ser. No. 08/403,364 discloses a method to oxidize organic-rich shale by currently available methods of shale burning, before injecting leaching fluid into the burnt rock.\nThe currently available methods of in-situ shale burning have, however, two disadvantages:\n(1) Porosity and permeability for shale to be burnt originate from the collapse of a roof above an excavated cavity. The cost of such excavation renders the process uneconomical.\n(2) The fracturing of rubblized and burnt rock causes the leaching fluid to flow through fractures rather than pervasively through the whole rock. Such a flow pattern does not permit the leaching of metals from the largely intact sections of host rock which are not pulverized or not very minutely fractured.\nThe currently available methods of in-situ leaching metals from host rock have a disadvantage:\n(1) The leaching solution must flow laterally through a porous and permeable host rock, and economic values cannot be leached out from a relatively impermeable host rock by such lateral flow of leaching solution.\nIt is an object of the present invention to improve control of chemical reactions in leaching metals and to recover valuable constituents at greater depths than now possible.\nHumid regions with high groundwater table or arid regions with low groundwater table can be dealt with, because the hydrologic cell is designed to minimize lateral losses to natural groundwaters. Vertical flow through relatively impermeable bed is induced to flow from a lower aquifer upward to an upper aquifer or other collecting devices for reacted solution.", "hash": "2542f49affb49dd642bed1a4164ec78956932fb7c183972dae8a326ac5c9d3ec"}

I think it's important that all the dresses, everything we're offering, can come in any size.

As NO has a critical role in hemodynamics, NO may be associated with other hemodynamics-related factors including atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and whole blood viscosity (WBV). It has been reported that serum NO level increased in patients undergoing hemodialysis. However, there are few reports about the relationship between NO and hemodynamic parameters in hemodialysis patients. We investigated the associations between serum levels of NO and other hemodynamics-related factors such as ANP, BNP and WBV in patients with hemodialysis. NO, ANP, and BNP levels before hemodialysis were measured using ELISA method. We measured WBV in pre- and post-dialysis. Mean serum levels of NO, ANP, and BNP were 13.97 \u00b1 10.34 \u03bcg/mL, 198.85 \u00b1 61.56 pg/mL, and 1233.32 \u00b1 280.81 pg/mL, respectively in patients with hemodialysis.

Serum NO level was positively correlated with WBV at shear rates of 1, 5, and 300 s-1 at pre- and post-hemodialysis. There is a correlation between serum nitrite levels and the change of SBV during hemodialysis. Serum nitrite levels correlated with the serum BNP levels. ANP levels have a negative correlation with pre-dialytic WBV. However, BNP levels did not correlate with WBV during hemodialysis. WBV is linked to an imbalance in serum vasoactive substances in hemodialysis patients and can cause significant hemodynamic disturbance.", "hash": "aeb65c2f44ddb9b8d7c2061009b1b4bf921261d8ff10352798119ad78424d126"}

Packaging helps keep things safe, fresh, and easy to carry from one place to another. It also helps make things look nice so more people want to buy them.\n\n**Key Words:**\n- Packaging: Keeping things safe and fresh.\n- Goods: Things that we can buy or sell.\n- Item: Anything that is bought or sold.\n\n### Part 2: Examples of Packaging\n\nLets think about a shop that sells fruits and veggies. The shop needs to wrap the fruits and veggies so they stay fresh and look good. They might use clear boxes with little holes that let air in but keep the fruits and veggies fresh. Or, they might use bags that go back to the earth when thrown away.\n\n**Questions:**\n- How can packaging make more people want to buy things?\n- What are some ways to wrap goods?\n- Why is it good to pick the right wrap for each item?\n\n### Part 3: Packaging in Everyday Life\n\nNow, let's see how real shops use packaging. Big shops spend a lot of money making their packaging look special because it helps sell more things. For example, a famous drink company has a special design that everyone knows. They put this design on their drink bottles to make people notice them in stores.\n\n**Questions:**\n- How does the look of packaging help sell more?\n- What is the job of special designs on packaging?\n- Can we reuse packaging materials?\n\n## Small Words to Remember\n\n- Packaging: Keeping things safe and fresh.\n- Goods: Things that we can buy or sell.\n- Item: Anything that is bought or sold.\n- Clear boxes: See-through boxes.\n- Earth-friendly bags: Bags that don't hurt the earth.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this lesson, we learned why packaging is important in shops.

{"text": "Lesson: Introduction to Simple Money Concepts\n\n**Objective:** To teach children about simple money ideas.\n\n**Introduction:** Today we are going to learn about how a company figures out the cost of their money. This is like knowing how much it costs to borrow toys from a friend. We will see why it is important and how it is done simply.\n\n**Main Topics:**\n\n1. What is the cost of company's money?\n2. Why knowing this cost is important?\n3. How do companies calculate this cost?\n4. Simple ideas behind calculating this cost\n5. Using this knowledge in real life\n6. A story about a mistake when people did not agree on the rules\n\n**Section 1: What is the cost of company's money?**\n\nThe cost of a company's money is a mix of costs from borrowing money and getting money from selling little pieces of the company (like shares). Companies try to find out how much they need to pay on average for these different kinds of money.\n\n**Section 2: Why knowing this cost is important?**\n\nKnowing this cost helps people who give money to companies understand how much they should get back. If this cost is high, the company needs to earn more to make it worthwhile. If it's low, the company can do things that are a bit risky but could be really good.\n\n**Section 3: How do companies calculate this cost?**\n\nCompanies use a simple math formula to figure out this cost. They look at how much money they get from shares and from borrowing, then they mix these numbers to get an average.\n\n**Section 4: Simple ideas behind calculating this cost**\n\nThe ideas behind this are easy:\n1. It costs less to borrow money than to sell shares.\n2. The company is doing well and not in trouble.\n3. The company is treated just like any other with no special breaks.\n4. The company doesn't give special deals to its bosses.\n\n**Section 5: Using this knowledge in real life**\n\nKnowing about these costs can help in:\n1. Deciding if a new project is a good idea.\n2. Figuring out how much a company is really worth.\n3. Managing a mix of investments to balance risk and return.\n4. Thinking about joining with another company or buying it.\n\n**Section 6: Case Study: Wrong Answers Because of Mixed-Up Ideas**\n\nThis case study shows why it is important to think the same way when we work on special math problems. The paper explains that sometimes, people make mistakes because they mix two different ideas: (i) using a number of zero for one part of the math problem when they change numbers, and (ii) using a bigger number than the very safe number when they do another part of the math problem. The paper talks about what happens when people mix these ideas and how to fix it.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn the end, doing these special math problems right is very important for people who need to know how much money they might get from putting money into something. It helps them understand what they can earn. But it is very important to always think in the same way when doing these math problems to avoid mistakes. By learning about this special math and how to use it, kids can know a lot about money and make good choices.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 865, "idx": 428960, "original text": "WACC Calculations in Practice: Incorrect Results due to Inconsistent Assumptions - Status Quo and Improvements. Abstract. This paper argues that in practical applications the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is often incorrectly estimated due to the simultaneous use of two inconsistent input parameters: (i) a beta of debt equal to zero when transforming asset betas into equity betas (beta levering) and (ii) a cost of debt above the risk-free interest rate when calculating the WACC. The paper discusses and quantifies the consequences of this inconsistency and offers viable solutions. By replacing the cost of debt with the risk-free rate, a more accurate WACC is calculated and the estimation of the cost of debt becomes obsolete. Furthermore, the paper presents a solution to obtain the correct WACC without increasing the calculation\u2019s complexity..", "hash": "35df0e5c732ca61fca6210736aa8d9b8cebf8e44400bc2b61d0993545adafb15"}

They come in different shapes and sizes and need to fit together just right.\n\n## Section 2: Why do we need to know how blocks fit?\n\nIt's important to know how blocks fit so that we can make sure our house or tower is strong and wont fall down. Each piece might be different, and knowing about these differences helps us build better.\n\n## Section 3: How to check if blocks fit right?\n\nTo check if blocks fit right, we can try putting them together like a puzzle. If they snap into place without forcing them, they fit!\n\n## Section 4: What if blocks do not fit?\n\nIf blocks do not fit, it might make our building shake or even collapse! We need to make sure all pieces match well.\n\n## Section 5: How to make sure all blocks fit?\n\nTo make sure all blocks fit, we can use a guidebook that shows which pieces go together best. This helps us build safely and have fun at the same time.\n\nConclusion\n\nToday, we learned about how different building blocks fit together and why it's important.

I know the reason, and it is because one library that is needed to create the final library comes from a third-party library, which is binary and no source codes are provided. So my question is: in this situation can I safely release the library? Or should I obtain the source codes of the third parties and build all the codes with one single GCC compiler?  Thanks. \n\nA:\n\nIf you have successfully made use of the library binary in compiling your code, there is no technical reason that you need the source to build it again. If the library isn't compatible with your current build environment, your code relying on the binary would not compile. (or should not compile without warning if proper soname/version checks are included)\nThat said, there is probably a reason that the library is a binary and not distributed with the source. This is where you need to check if there is a legal requirement associated with the use of the library binary that you need to comply with before you release your library. Note this is a legal issue, not a technical issue. Look for a Readme or License file that accompanies the binary and determine what if any license is associated with it. It may provide a link to it's specific end user license agreement (EULA) or it may direct you to a standard software licensing agreement (i.e. Creative-Commons, GPLv3, etc...)\nIf your project is a commercial project, it is worth getting compliance right before you release your library.

{"text": "Lesson: Learning About Medicine for Lung Sickness\n\n### Overview\nIn this lesson, we will learn about special medicines used to help people with lung sickness. We will see how using two medicines together can be helpful but also tricky.\n\n### Section 1: Introduction to Medicine for Lung Sickness\nLung sickness is when someone's lungs are not healthy. There are two main kinds of lung sickness. One kind spreads very fast and the other kind does not spread as fast. The kind that does not spread fast can have different forms.\n\nMedicine for lung sickness uses special drugs to stop the sickness cells from growing. These drugs go after cells that grow very fast, like sickness cells, but they can also make healthy cells feel bad, which causes side effects.\n\n### Section 2: Two Special Medicines for Lung Sickness\nThere are two special drugs that doctors use to help people with the slower spreading lung sickness. One drug stops the sickness cells from splitting into more cells. The other drug stops the sickness cells from making more of themselves.\n\nUsing both drugs together can work better than using just one. This is because each drug fights the sickness in a different way. This can make it harder for the sickness to keep growing.\n\n### Section 3: How to Use the Medicines Together\nDoctors can give these two drugs one after the other or at the same time. The way doctors choose to use the drugs depends on how bad the sickness is, how healthy the person is, and what kind of side effects the drugs might cause.\n\nSometimes, using the drugs together might not work well because they can interfere with each other. This can happen because of how the drugs work inside the body or when they are given. Knowing this helps doctors plan the best way to use the drugs to help the person feel better and have fewer side effects.\n\n### Section 4: Learning More About How These Medicines Work\nTo understand why sometimes the medicines do not work well together, scientists look at what happens inside the cells. Cells grow and split in a special order. Sometimes, one of the drugs can stop the cells from doing what they need to do to die when they are supposed to, which can make the other drug work less well.\n\nIn studies, one drug was shown to stop the effect of the other drug in making the sickness cells die as planned. This shows that how these drugs are used together is very important. We need to learn more about how some medicines work together and how they might help or not help when treating sickness.", "source": "minipile", "s": 8, "len": 1002, "idx": 406105, "original text": "Combined effect of docetaxel and cisplatin for non-small cell lung cancer cell lines in vitro.\nDocetaxel (DOC) plus cisplatin (CDDP) is a novel combination chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We investigated the combined effect of DOC with CDDP in sequence and the reverse schedule for NSCLC cell lines EBC-1 (squamous cell carcinoma) and RERF-LC-MS (adenocarcinoma) using an MTT assay and an improved isobologram method. The results showed that the combination of DOC and CDDP in human lung cancer cell lines was antagonistic. To investigate the possible mechanism of the antagonistic effect, we focused on the cell cycle perturbation and the inhibition of apoptosis fractions induced by chemotherapeutic agents. Pretreatment of CDDP significantly blocked the following DOC-induced apoptosis fraction. Therefore we consider that the suppression of apoptosis could be one of the mechanisms for antagonistic effects of combination chemotherapy of DOC and CDDP.", "hash": "3874875617c0dcfc74df1cd5bfbe6dd68e62371f5ec0880345923642015537a9"}

In this lesson, we will learn why fun projects are good and how they can help us reach our dreams.\n\nSection 1: What are Fun Projects?\n\nFun projects are things we do because we enjoy them. They might not be part of our school work, but they help us grow. Fun projects can be many things like playing, helping others, or making something by ourselves.\n\nSection 2: Why are Fun Projects Good?\n\nFun projects are good because they let us try what we like and learn new things. When we really like a project, we work hard on it and feel happy when we finish. This happy feeling is special and can be hard to find in other parts of our lives.\n\nSection 3: Examples of Fun Projects\n\nSome fun projects can be painting, writing stories, learning new words, or starting a small shop. These projects need us to think, be creative, and work hard, but they are very rewarding.\n\nSection 4: How to Start a Fun Project\n\nTo start a fun project, we first think about what we like. We then make time to do our project, even if it's just a little each day. We can also find friends or grown-ups who can teach us more about our project.\n\nSection 5: Conclusion\n\nIn the end, fun projects are really important because they let us try new things, learn, and make something special. By starting a fun project, we can feel proud and happy, which can be hard to find in other parts of our lives.\n\nGlossary:\n- Fun project: A thing we do because we enjoy it.\n- Interest: Something we like to learn about.\n- Skill: Something we get better at by practicing.\n\nDiscussion:\nIs it good to spend time on a fun project even if it's not about school or work?\n\nAnswer:\nIt depends on the person and what they want.

They are very important for our tummy to work right and keep us healthy.\n\nSection 1: What are Tummy Helpers?\nTummy helpers are proteins that make our food into tiny bits that our body can use. They are made in our tummy and other parts inside us. There are three kinds of tummy helpers: one for sugar, one for protein, and one for fat.\n\nSection 2: Why do we need Tummy Helpers?\nWe need tummy helpers to turn our food into smaller parts so our body can soak it up. Without them, we can't get all the good stuff from our food, and that can make us feel not so good.\n\nSection 3: Where can we find Tummy Helpers?\nOur body makes tummy helpers, mainly in our tummy and tiny tummy (small intestine). We can also find them in some foods and drinks that help our tummy.\n\nSection 4: How do we use Tummy Helpers?\nWe can drink a special juice to get more tummy helpers. To make this juice, mix a little of the special juice into a glass of cold water. Drink it when your tummy is empty, maybe one to three times a day.\n\nSection 5: Conclusion\nTummy helpers are very important for us to digest our food and get all the nutrients.

Let's learn about how this blue pill began.\n\n## Section 1: Finding the Blue Pill\nA long time ago, in a big company in GB country, some scientists were trying to make a new medicine. They wanted to help people who had heart pain and whose hearts had to work too hard.\n\nThey made a new medicine and gave it to many people to see if it would help with their heart problems. The medicine did not help much with heart pain, but it did something unexpected. Some people felt more awake and energetic.\n\n## Section 2: A Surprising Discovery\nThe scientists noticed this unexpected change and started to study it more. They found out that the medicine could help with a problem some men have, making them happy.\n\nThe company tested the medicine with many men and found very good results. So, in the late 20th century, the medicine was allowed to be used for this new purpose.\n\n## Section 3: Sharing the Blue Pill\nThe company was very clever in telling people about the blue pill. They didn't talk about the heart problems anymore. Instead, they said the blue pill could help men feel better and stronger.\n\nThey showed the blue pill on TV and in magazines everywhere. Men of all ages said that this blue pill made them feel happier.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe blue pill started as a heart medicine but became famous for helping men in a different way. This story shows us that sometimes, unexpected things can lead to great ideas.\n\nWords to Know:\n- Heart pain: When your heart hurts because it's not getting enough blood.\n- Feeling energetic: Feeling full of energy and ready to go.\n- GB country: A place where the company is.\n- Blue pill: A small blue medicine that helps men feel better.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 552, "idx": 479506, "original text": "By Jo Ann LeQuang.

Little data is available addressing the pathology of As2O3 treated APL and whether the antileukemic mechanism of As2O3 is primarily cytolysis or through stimulation of cell differentiation. In this report, we made a morphologic, cytogenetic, and molecular evaluation of five ATRA-refractory APL patients who were treated with As2O3. Four of the five patients had morphologic responses after one or two cycles of As2O3 treatment. Of the four responders based on bone marrow morphology, two achieved molecular remission (negative RT-PCR for PML- RAR alpha fusion transcripts) by the end of the second and third cycles of As2O3 therapy. Two patients exhibited marked leukocytosis during the first cycle of As2O3, and at that time point the APL cells were largely replaced by the cells showing partial differentiation towards myelocytes with co-expression of CD11b and CD33. Nevertheless, these \"myelocyte-like\" cells that showed the t(15;17) translocation eventually disappeared with continuous As2O3 therapy. As2O3 treatment appears to be effective therapy for the patients with relapsed APL after the failure of conventional chemotherapy and ATRA therapy. The pathologic findings in these five cases suggest that at low doses As2O3 primarily induces differentiation of the APL cells, generating abnormal myelocytes resembling APL cells treated with ATRA, whereas at higher doses AS2O3 induces marrow necrosis.", "hash": "943a24b4e3d173eec9471fc9f7550489840e62ba9d61ed4a6841f5edf6d0a683"}

This study investigates the ability of psychopathic individuals to process facial emotional expressions. Psychopathic and comparison individuals, as defined by the Hare Psychopathy Checklist Revised (PCL-R), were presented with a standardized set of facial expressions depicting six emotions: happy, surprised, disgusted, angry, sad and fearful. Participants observed as these facial expressions slowly evolved through 20 successive frames of increasing intensity. The dependent variables were latency in responding as measured by frame and number of errors. The psychopathic individuals showed selective impairment for the recognition of fearful expressions.

{"text": "Lesson Title: Learning About Hospital Tools\n\n#### Section 1: What is Picture Taking Inside the Body?\nPicture taking inside the body is making pictures of the inside parts of the body using special tools. These pictures help doctors find and fix sicknesses and hurts. There are many tools for this, like X-ray machines, sound wave machines, and special camera machines.\n\n#### Section 2: How does a Company Help with Picture Taking Inside the Body?\nA company makes new tools for doctors to see inside the body better. They make special tools to help see sicknesses in a good way and tools that are safe and don't need a lot of power to see the heart.\n\n#### Section 3: How does the Company Make it Cheaper?\nThe company tries to make these tools cheaper. They use smart ways to make tools work better but cost less. This lets doctors use good tools without spending a lot of money, so more people can get checked.\n\n#### Section 4: What is the difference between Old and Safe Camera Machines?\nOld camera machines use a lot of power to make pictures and can be not safe if used a lot. Safe camera machines use less power to make pictures. This is better, especially for people who need many checks and must stay safe from too much power.\n\n#### Section 5: Why is Good Picture Taking Important?\nGood picture taking is important because it helps doctors see sicknesses and hurts better. If the pictures are not clear, doctors might not see everything they need to help a person get better. The company's new tools help make clearer pictures, even when the body moves. This helps doctors treat people in the best way.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nIn conclusion, the company is helping by making new tools for doctors to see inside the body better and cheaper.

We will look at important things like how it fits, looks, and what it's made of. You will know how to choose the best jacket for you by the end of our time together.\n\nKey Things to Think About When Choosing a Jacket\n\n1. Fit: The first thing to think about is how the jacket fits. It should be snug but not too tight. It should sit right at your waist and not be open at the back. To find your size, try on different jackets until one feels just right.\n\n2. Style: Next, think about the style of the jacket. There are many types, like tight, loose, and big. Pick a style that makes you feel good and fits your body. If you are small, a tight jacket with straight lines might look best.\n\n3. Fabric: The material of the jacket is important too. Choose a jacket made from something light and airy like cotton or linen. Stay away from heavy materials that make you feel bigger.\n\nExamples of Finding a Jacket\n\nImagine you are buying a jacket online. You see one you like but are not sure if it will fit. You can use a tape to measure your body and check these sizes with the online size chart. If they match, the jacket should fit well.\n\nReal-life example: You are at a store trying on jackets, but none fit right. You can ask a worker for help. They might suggest a different size or style that fits better.\n\nThinking About Your Choices\n\nQuestion: What if you're not sure which style of jacket you like?\nAnswer: Think about what you usually like to wear and what looks good on you. Decide if you want a tight or loose jacket, and if you like extra details like different cuffs. Knowing what you want makes shopping easier.\n\nConclusion:\nIn this lesson, we learned about how to pick the right jacket. We talked about the size, look, and material of jackets. We used simple examples to show these ideas. We also talked together about how to think well.

They do many things like watching for diseases, checking out sickness outbreaks, and looking at places to make sure they are clean and safe. When it comes to keeping our food safe, local health groups are very important because they check food places, watch how food is made, and teach everyone how to handle food safely.\n\n## Section 3: The Role of Local Health Groups in Keeping Food Safe\n\nLocal health groups are very important for making sure our food is safe by:\n\n1. Checking food places often to make sure they follow the rules for food safety.\n2. Looking into when a lot of people get sick from food to find out why and stop it from happening again.\n3. Teaching people how to cook and store food safely, like keeping cooking areas clean and washing hands.\n4. Working with other teams to make and start good plans for food safety.\n\n## Section 4: Why are Local Health Groups Important in Food Safety?\n\nLocal health groups are very important for keeping our food safe because they do the work in our area. They work with food places and people to stop sickness from food and keep everyone healthy. By checking places and looking into sicknesses, local health groups can find and fix food problems quickly.\n\n## Section 5: Real-World Examples\n\nOne example of how local health groups help keep food safe is when they look into why people got sick from eating at a restaurant. They would visit the restaurant to find out what went wrong and which foods made people sick. Then, they help the restaurant fix the problems and stop more people from getting sick. Also, the local health group might tell people about the problem so they can be careful.\n\n## Section 6: Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, local health groups are very important for making sure our food is safe.

I've learned that some of the hotels are donating several floors as well as the Government picking up some other tabs.\"\n\nGivens plans to stop in San Antonio next. \"I've spent a lot of time just sitting and talking with a lot of people here. What I hear most is that we're not getting the half of it from the news.\"\n\nGivens writes in several stories told first hand from some of the victims. \" Seems that on the second day, the city turned off the water trying to get everyone out of the downtown area hotels.

They just wanted everyone outside.\"\n\nShe continues, \"One of the remaining police officers explained to them that the water had been shut off on purpose but that it was not safe to go out. That same officer looted some stores to bring those people water, food and other much needed items. He and another officer stayed to protect them. She was there for 6 days before being escorted to a bus waiting to bring them to Houston.\"\n\nGivens also reports that the danger and deaths reported on the news is only half of it according to survivors. \"Everyone I've talked to just arriving are telling me that only a fraction of the reported relief troops are actually there and that there is still vast lawlessness in the area.\" Givens has been making trips to local grocery stores purchasing needs for infants as well as hygiene products for the adults.\n\n\"I wish I could do more and had the money to help each and every person,\" says Givens. \"I do feel better about helping with needs heard from the victims themselves instead of donating to charities where I'm not sure where those donations will end up.

This lesson will show you how this place started and grew over time into a famous spot for making tasty drinks.\n\n## Section 2: How It Started and Grew\n\nA long time ago, in 1999, a man named Patrick started a place to make beer in LE city. Before this, Patrick was a doctor for animals in a far-away land called IR country. But, he loved making drinks so much that he decided to start his own place for making beer and other drinks.\n\nPatrick brought back to life the old ways of making drinks in LE city, which started way back in 1794. He used his knowledge about science and old drink-making ways to create something special. Now, his place is known for making very good beers and other drinks like Kentucky Ale.\n\n## Section 3: A Fun Tour\n\nPatrick's drink-making place is one of the few places in the world where they make both beer and other kinds of drinks together. It's also part of a fun tour called the Kentucky Drinks Tour. On this tour, people learn how drinks like bourbon are made in KY state.\n\nWhen people visit Patrick's place, they can see how drinks are made and try some of the best drinks from KY state. They also learn how beer is made. This makes Patrick's place a fun stop on the Kentucky Drinks Tour.\n\n## Section 4: Conclusion\n\nIn the end, Patrick's place has a long story that goes back to 1794. Patrick brought back the old ways of making drinks and mixed them with new science to make something unique.

{"text": "Lesson: Light and Molecules\n\nIntroduction:\nToday, we'll learn about what happens when light hits molecules, like in sunlight. This is called breaking up molecules with light.\n\nCore Value:\nThe main thing to learn is how light can break up a molecule with a special part attached to it, and how it is different from breaking up other simple molecules.\n\nLet's Learn About Light and Little Parts\n\nTopic 1: What Happens When Light Hits Something?\nWhen light hits something, it can break it into smaller parts. This is like when sunlight breaks a cookie into crumbs when you drop it.\n\nTopic 2: What Changes How Light Breaks Things?\nThe color of the light and the shape of the thing it hits can change how it breaks. If there are other things around, they can change it too.\n\nTopic 3: Breaking Apart a Special Molecule\nThere is a special tiny thing that breaks into even tinier parts when light hits it. It breaks into two little pieces.\n\nSection 2: Comparing Two Special Molecules\n\nTopic 1: Breaking Another Molecule\nThere is another tiny thing that also breaks into two parts when light hits it.\n\nTopic 2: How are the Two Breakings Different?\nBoth tiny things break when light hits them, but they break into different tiny parts.\n\nSection 3: How We See What Happens\n\nTopic 1: Looking at Energy\nWe can make a picture that shows how energy changes when tiny things break. This helps us understand how they behave.\n\nTopic 2: Using Computers to Understand\nWe use computers to guess how tiny things will behave when they break. This helps us make the energy pictures.\n\nTopic 3: A Special Kind of Breaking\nSometimes, four parts of the tiny thing are involved in the break. This is a special way that it can break.\n\nConclusion:\nWe learned about how light can break tiny things into even tinier parts. We saw how different tiny things break differently and used pictures to understand them better. Computers help us guess how these tiny things behave. By knowing these, we can learn more about how the world works at a very tiny level.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 852, "idx": 23385, "original text": "Photodissociation dynamics of fluorobenzene.\nPhotodissociation of both fluorobenzene and d(5)-fluorobenzene at 193 nm under collision-free conditions has been studied in separate experiments using multimass ion imaging techniques.

{"text": "Lesson: Making Pictures Look Right on Screens\n\nIntroduction:\n\nMaking sure pictures look right on screens is important. If not done well, pictures can look funny or hard to see. Today, we'll learn how to make pictures look their best on different screens.\n\nSection 1: Why Making Pictures Look Right is Important\n\nWhen pictures look right, everything on your screen looks nice and clear. If not, pictures might look blurry or weird, and that's not good for enjoying what you're watching or looking at.\n\nSection 2: Old Ways to Make Pictures Look Right\n\nA long time ago, people used special projectors and tools to make sure pictures looked right. They used things like laser tools and clear plastic sheets to help with this. But sometimes, these old ways didn't work perfectly because each screen was a little different.\n\nSection 3: New Ways to Make Pictures Look Right\n\nNow, we use computers to help make pictures look perfect. Computers can check the picture and fix it so it fits just right on your screen. They use special steps to make sure everything in the picture is where it should be. [PARAGRAPH]These algorithms take into account factors such as the distance between the image source and the display device, the angle at which the image is projected, and the curvature of the display screen.\n\nConclusion:\n\nImage alignment is an essential process in displaying visual images correctly on a display device. Traditional methods of image alignment had limitations due to installation and manufacturing tolerance problems. However, modern methods of image alignment using digital technology provide accurate and precise alignment, making it easier to display images correctly on display devices. By understanding the principles of image alignment, we can apply these skills to new problems and improve the quality of visual images.", "source": "minipile", "s": 8, "len": 2909, "idx": 611592, "original text": "In order to ensure that visual images are properly displayed, systems have been developed to determine that the image and the visual display device onto which the image is projected are properly aligned. Proper alignment requires the comparison of reference points located or projected onto the viewing surface of the display device with similar points in an appropriate test pattern.\nPreviously known systems use modified slide projectors or slide projectors incorporating custom lenses and specially designed optical reticles. Alignment is achieved using either a laser theodolite or a removable clear plastic overlay template. Such a template may be installed on the face of a CRT, for example. The laser theodolite and the template may be used in conjunction to achieve the desired alignment of image and visual display device.\nThese previously known systems suffer from both installation and manufacturing tolerance problems. For example, back projections screens are free form blow molded. The curvature of screens produced by this process may vary from screen to screen. As a result of this variation in curvature resulting from the fabrication process, optical reticles may yield variations in tolerances from screen to screen during the alignment process.\nRepeated attachments of the above-mentioned templates may lead to installation tolerance problems where the actual orientation of the template relative to the display device may vary slightly from one application to the next. As a result, attempts to evaluate alignment of image and the display device may lead to variations in tolerance when evaluations are repeated over a period of time.\nThe use of laser theodolites may prove expensive and very time-consuming to use in aligning images with visual display devices. Using a laser theodolite, which resembles the device used by surveyors to measure angles, the reference points are mapped on the viewing surface of the display device. The locations of the various reference points are given as coordinates, usually azimuth and elevation. However, when using a laser theodolite, each reference point must be mapped individually. Therefore, deviations from proper alignment are determined only when the map of reference points is completely constructed and the resulting map of reference points is compared with the test pattern.\nAccordingly, corrections to the alignment of the display device and the test pattern due to orientation problems or distortion of the image can be made only after reconstruction of the entire array of reference points. Therefore, the use of laser theodolites is very time-consuming and expensive when determining whether an image is properly aligned with the visual display device.\nThe present invention addresses the above-mentioned problems in the previously known systems to provide a method and apparatus for efficiently aligning an image and a display device.", "hash": "b2aa24602517ffb0da15a5b9a87d01a804df127f72f99b91401b0d6667f82f83"}

We make these ponds for growing food or for fun activities like fishing and boating. Today, we will learn about different kinds of ponds, how they were made, and why they are important now.\n\nSection 1: Kinds of Ponds\n\n**Theory:** There are three main types of ponds - Cranberry Pool, Goose Bay Pool, and Big Marsh Slough. Each one is a little different and useful in its own way.\n\n**Practice:** Let's see examples of each pond type.\n\n1. Cranberry Pool: This pond is big and has walls around it to keep the water level just right and stop floods. It was made in 1968 and cost a lot of money.\n\n2. Goose Bay Pool: This pond is smaller than Cranberry Pool and also has walls. People use it for fun like fishing and boating. It was made in 1959.\n\n3. Big Marsh Slough: This is the biggest pond of the three and is used for growing food and for fun too. It was made in 1956 and has a very long wall.\n\nSection 2: History of Ponds\n\n**Theory:** Long ago, ponds were not made for fun or food. They were made to stop floods and to store water for watering plants.\n\n**Practice:** Let's learn more about the history of ponds.\n\n1. Ancient EG city: The first ponds were made in EG city around 2000 BCE. People built walls and channels to manage the water of the Nile River and store it for watering plants.\n\n2. CH city: In the 5th century, the CH country made a pond by building a wall around a lake to water their crops.\n\n3. Europe: In the Middle Ages, farmers in Europe made small ponds to get water for their plants. These were simple ponds dug by hand.\n\nSection 3: Why Ponds are Important\n\n**Theory:** Today, ponds are very important for growing food and for nature. They make sure that plants have enough water and they are homes for birds and other animals.\n\nLet's learn about special water areas made by people!\n\n1. Growing Food: These water areas help give water to plants when it's very dry. This is very helpful where there isn't much water.\n\n2. Helping Animals: These areas also help birds that fly from place to place and other animals by giving them water. This helps many plants and animals live there.\n\n3. Having Fun: Many of these water areas are places where people can fish, boat, and swim. They make it fun and safe for people to play outside.\n\nConclusion:\nToday, we learned about water areas made by people and how they are used for growing food, helping animals, and having fun.

I spent summers in high school in my family room watching Petrilude and Pixiwoo videos and trying to recreate makeup looks. That led to a lot of makeup wipes, baby wipes, and cotton rounds being tossed in the trash when I finished creating my masterpiece.\n\nAs I\u2019ve gotten older, I have stepped away from using as much makeup as I once did. I have spent thousands on Mary Kay, building a makeup kit and direct sales business before stepping away a few years ago. While I still have the core of my kit, I rarely wear makeup anymore, opting instead for boosting my skincare and rocking my natural skin. When I do wear makeup, it can be a pain to take it off and I hate spending $15-20 on a \u201cgood\u201d makeup remover.\n\nThis has led me to making my own remover solution and reusable makeup wipes.\n\nI used an 8oz mason jar to store everything in. For this recipe, I used a cup of water, a few drops of castile soap, and 15-20 drops of witch hazel. I\u2019ve used Witch Hazel on and off as a toner/astringent and love it. It is so cooling on the skin and does a great job of shrinking pores, tightening skin, and helping with oil production and breakouts. I\u2019m having a bit of a love affair with castile soap at the moment. It is so versatile! I have been using it the last month as a hair, face, and body wash, as well as with cleaning. This big ole bottle is lasting forever and is a cheap, eco-and-body-friendly product.\n\nOnce all the ingredients are in the jar, I stirred it up with my finger and added half of my bamboo cotton rounds.\n\nThe bamboo cotton rounds are made with one layer of super heavy organic bamboo fleece and a layer of cotton, serged together. I have had these listed on The Wittle Whale, and am currently working on restocking after a successful launch. I add half at a time because the bamboo is very absorbent and I like to give it a chance to soak up the liquid. Once they have absorbed the liquid, I add the rest of the wipes and top of with water and a few more drops of each ingredient. I screw on the top and shake it up.\n\nThese wipes last about a week in the container. When I\u2019m finished using them, I put them in a wet bag and save them for laundry days to wash them in a lingerie bag with cloth pads, towels, etc.\n\nI hope you enjoy this little DIY recipe! Let me know if you give it a try.\n\nAbout\n\nWelcome to Handstitched Life!\nI'm Jenn, a twenty-something cat lady with an affinity for starting projects I'll never finish and hoarding craft supplies I'll never use.\nThis blog is my attempt at correcting those last two points.", "hash": "9f896f992c9bdca13acbaffeaeff95dba8f2bc041243a2b6c2ab445d2188f91c"}

{"text": "Lesson: Understanding Helping New Companies Grow\n\n## Section 1: What is Helping New Companies Grow?\n\nHelping new companies grow is when some people give money to new small businesses that they think will become very important and big in the future. They give this money and in return, they get a part of the business. This means they own a little piece of the business and if the business does well, they get some money back.\n\n## Section 2: How Does Helping New Companies Grow Work?\n\nPeople who help new companies grow collect money from others, like big money savers, insurance helpers, and rich people, to make a big pot of money. They use this pot of money to give money to many new businesses. They hope that these businesses will do well so they can get more money back than they gave.\n\nThese helpers give money to new businesses at different times. Some helpers give money when the business is just starting, and others give money when the business is already making money. The amount they give can be a little or a lot.\n\n## Section 3: Why Do Businesses Need Help to Grow?\n\nNew businesses often need extra money to get bigger. This can mean hiring more people, making new things, or selling their things in more places. The money and the helpers can also introduce them to more people who can help the business do well.\n\nBut in return for the money, the helpers want to make a lot of money back. They sometimes help manage the business too, giving ideas and advice to make the business better.\n\n## Section 4: Example of a Helper for New Companies\n\nA helper for new companies is a group called BC Group. They give early money to help new businesses that use technology and services for other businesses. They manage a lot of money and have helped businesses like LN Group, SM Survey, and Gainsight.\n\n## Glossary\n\n- Helping New Companies Grow: Giving money to new small businesses that could grow big.\n- Owning a Part of a Business: When you give money and in return, you get a share of the business.\n- Big Pot of Money: Money collected from many people to invest in businesses.\n- Making Money Back: Getting more money back than what you gave.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nHelping new companies grow is a good way to support new businesses that might become very important in the future. By understanding how it works, we can see how important these helpers are to the business world.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 1010, "idx": 460883, "original text": "Venture capital firm Bain Capital Ventures closed its latest fund..

This story is about a way to show ads on phones and tablets. We see ads when we look up things on our devices. These ads help businesses by showing their products to more people. \n\n**Section 1: What Are Phone Ads?**\n\nPhone ads are a kind of online ad. They show up on phones or tablets. They appear when someone looks for something on their device. These ads have to fit well on small screens and work with slow internet too.\n\n**Section 2: How Do Phone Ads Work?**\n\nPhone ads work like internet ads. When you search for something, you see a list of results and some ads. These ads are chosen based on what you're looking for, where you are, and what you like. Businesses pick words that match their ads, and they pay a little every time someone clicks on their ad.\n\n**Section 3: Good Things About Phone Ads**\n\nPhone ads can reach lots of people because many use their mobile devices to look things up. They let businesses show ads to certain groups of people. This helps businesses use their ad money well. These ads can bring more people to their websites or stores, which can mean more sales.\n\n**Section 4: Hard Things About Phone Ads**\n\nSometimes, it's tough to make ads that look good on phones and load fast. If ads don't work well on mobile, people might not click on them. Also, many businesses want to use the same popular words for their ads, so they might have to pay more. Each person uses their phone differently, so it's hard to make one ad that everyone will like.\n\n**Glossary:**\n- Ad: A way to tell people about a product or service on the internet.\n- CPC: The money that someone gives when a person clicks on their advertisement.\n- Keyword: A word or phrase that makes an advertisement show up.\n- PPC: Pay-per-click, a way of online advertising where advertisers pay only if someone clicks on their advertisement.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, using ads on mobile phones is a good way for businesses to meet more customers.

{"text": "Lesson: The Big Job of Small-Time Pastors\n\nIntroduction:\nIn this lesson, we will talk about small-time pastors who have two jobs, one at the church and another one. We will learn why this is good for both the pastor and the church, and look at how pastors long ago did the same thing.\n\nSection 1: What It Means to Be a Small-Time Pastor\n\nDefinition: Sometimes, a pastor works another job besides being a pastor. This helps because some churches don't have enough money to pay for a full-time pastor.\n\nImportance: This kind of work is good for the pastor and the church. The pastor can earn money and still help the church. It helps the church because they get a pastor who knows what daily life is like.\n\nChallenges: It can be hard for the pastor to manage time between the two jobs. The pastor needs to take care of both jobs well. Also, some people might not like it if the pastor has another job.\n\nOpportunities: Working another job gives the pastor new ideas and ways to understand people better. The pastor can meet more people and share church stories because of their other job.\n\nSection 2: The History of Pastors Working Two Jobs\n\nA long time ago, many pastors had other jobs too, like farming or making things. They would work during the day and help their church later.\n\nDuring a big change in the church many years ago, some pastors were also teachers. For example, a famous teacher helped his church while teaching at a university.\n\nNowadays, more pastors are working two jobs because churches need help with money.\n\nSection 3: Practical Examples\n\nSome pastors might teach during the week and then help their church on weekends. Others might be nurses during the week and pastors at their church. These jobs help them understand people better and share important church lessons.\n\nConclusion:\nIt's good for pastors to have two jobs because they can earn money and understand people better. This helps them be better pastors. As more churches find it hard to pay for a full-time pastor, having another job will keep being an important choice for many pastors and churches.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 442, "idx": 414941, "original text": "?.

How Much It Costs to Keep the House Running in One Year\nThe house has things like a fireplace and a hot tub. Let's say it costs $10,000 a year for things the house needs and the people who take care of the house get 20% of the money from the guests.\n\nCosts for one year = Money for taking care of the house + Money for things the house needs\n= 20% of $292,000 + $10,000\n= $58,400 + $10,000\n= $68,400\n\n1.3. How Much Money is Left After Paying Costs\nTo find out how much money is left after all costs, subtract the costs from the money made from guests.\n\nMoney left after costs = Money from guests - Costs\n= $292,000 - $68,400\n= $223,600\n\nConclusion:\nBy looking at how much money the house makes and the costs, we learn that the house can make $223,600 in one year. This helps us understand if the house is a good choice to buy.\n\nSection 2: Looking at the House and Other Houses Nearby\n\n2.1. Where the House Is\nThe house is in FR country. Find out if many people like to visit there and if other houses are also good for guests.\n\n2.2. Checking Other Houses\nLook at other houses nearby to see if they have the same things like size and fun things to do. This helps us know if the house's price is good.\n\nConclusion:\nBy studying the house and other houses, we learn if our house has a good price and if it is in a good place for guests. This helps us make good choices when buying houses.\n\n[PARAGRAPH]Section 3: Risk Analysis\n\n3.1. Assess the Risk of Vacancy\nConsider the likelihood of the property being vacant during certain times of the year due to seasonality or other factors. Determine if the rental income is sufficient to cover the expenses during these periods.\n\n3.2. Evaluate the Risk of Maintenance and Repairs\nAssess the potential costs associated with maintenance and repairs for the property. Determine if the rental income is sufficient to cover these costs.\n\n3.3. Analyze the Risk of Market Fluctuations\nResearch the local real estate market to determine if there are any potential fluctuations that could affect the property's value. Consider factors such as changes in population density, tourism, and economic conditions.\n\nConclusion:\nBy conducting a risk analysis, we can identify potential risks associated with the rental property and determine if the rental income is sufficient to cover these costs. This information can be used to make informed decisions about future investments.\n\nGlossary:\n- Market Fluctuations: Changes in the market conditions that can affect the value of an asset.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, by conducting a financial analysis, market analysis, and risk analysis, we can determine the profitability and risk associated with the rental property.

{"text": "Lesson: Let's Learn About Taking Pictures\n\n## Section 1: What is Photography?\n\nTaking pictures is a fun way to remember what you see! It uses a camera to catch the light and show us an image. Today, we'll learn about making good pictures with things like where to stand and when to click the button.\n\n## Section 2: Seeing Examples\n\nLet's look at a picture of a park. When a person takes a picture, they can decide to make something like a tree or a mountain the main thing you see. This is called putting things in a nice way in the picture.\n\nNext, the person taking the picture needs to pick the right light settings for their camera. This means they decide how much light the camera lets in. They can change this by hand or let the camera do it by itself to get the look they want.\n\nThen, they make sure the picture is clear. Clearness means how sharp the picture looks, and it depends on how far the camera is from what it is taking a picture of. They can fix this by hand or use the camera's help to make everything look sharp.\n\n## Section 3: Real-World Scenarios\n\nNow, let's think about when someone takes a picture of a person. First, the picture-taker needs to talk to the person and tell them how they want the picture to look. They might use sunlight or lights from lamps, and things like toys or cloths to make the picture nicer.\n\nOnce they start taking pictures, they keep checking to make sure the main thing, light, and clearness are all good so the final picture is just what they hoped for. They might need to change the camera or where the person stands to get it right.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, taking pictures is a big job that needs knowing about putting things in a nice way, light, and clearness. By understanding these and using them when taking pictures, people can make beautiful pictures that share stories and feelings.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 1763, "idx": 435670, "original text": "Menu\n\nFinal Shoot Plan\n\nI have really taken to such a setting and I have aimed to use this as my final shoot idea!

{"text": "Lesson: Introduction to Soft and Safe Materials\n\n### Section 1: Learning About Soft Materials\nSoft materials like silicone are used a lot in making things for doctors because they are safe and comfy. Silicone is soft and can bend well, which is why it's used for things like tubes and soft covers in hospitals.\n\n### Section 2: Seeing Examples\nOne of the best things about silicone is that it's safe to touch and use. It doesn't hurt our body. Silicone can also handle being very cold or very hot, which is great for things used in different places. It's also strong enough to be used every day without breaking.\n\n[PARAGRAPH]Another advantage of silicone is its non-wetting surface. This means that it does not absorb water or other fluids, which can lead to infections and other complications. Silicone's non-stick surface also makes it easy to remove catheters and other devices after extended use.\n\n### Section 3: Real-World Scenarios\nSilicone is commonly used in the manufacturing of catheters, as it reduces the risk of infection and makes it easier to remove the device. It is also used in implants, such as breast implants and heart valves, as it is biocompatible and durable. Silicone is also used in prosthetics, as it provides a comfortable and durable solution for individuals who have lost limbs or other body parts.\n\n### Glossary\n- Elastomer: A material that combines the properties of elasticity and strength\n- Polymer: A large molecule made up of repeating units called monomers\n- Siloxane: A chemical compound that contains the elements silicon, oxygen, and hydrogen\n- Biocompatibility: The ability of a material to interact with living tissue without causing any adverse reactions\n- Non-wetting surface: A surface that does not absorb water or other fluids\n- Encrustations: The formation of a hard, solid layer on a surface\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, silicone is a unique material that has many advantages over other materials when used in medical devices. Its biocompatibility, resistance to temperature changes, mechanical and electrical properties, and non-wetting surface make it an ideal choice for catheters, implants, and prosthetics. By understanding the properties of silicone and how they can be applied in medical devices, we can create safer and more effective solutions for patients.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 585, "idx": 617247, "original text": "Strengthening your medical devices.

Since then, people have made better and different secret codes.\n\nSection 2: Kinds of Secret Codes\n\nThere are a few types of secret codes:\n\n1. Simple Secret Code: This uses one secret word to lock and unlock the box. It's easy but we have to keep the secret word a secret.\n\n2. Two-Key Secret Code: This type uses two secret words. One word locks the box and another word unlocks it. One word is a secret and the other word everyone can know. This makes it very hard for others to peek inside.\n\n3. Puzzle Code: This type changes a message into a puzzle. Only people who know how to solve the puzzle can read the message.\n\nSection 3: Using Secret Codes\n\nWe use secret codes for many things like:\n\n1. Talking safely: Secret codes help keep our talks safe when we send messages on computers, like when we shop online or talk to friends far away.\n\n2. Making sure messages are real: Secret codes can show that a message really came from our friend and not someone pretending to be them.\n\n3.

When they kick, the other team tries to catch it and then it's their turn to try to score.\n\n#### Part 3: Games We Play\nNow, picture this: Team A is playing and is losing by a little bit with not much time left. They need to score quickly. They try really hard, passing the ball and running fast.

So, its good to read all of the news to really understand.\n\nPart 2: Reading the News\n\nTopic 1: What is the News About?\nThe first part of the news tells us who, what, when, and where of the story. It helps us know the main things about the story.\n\nTopic 2: Checking the Facts\nThe news should have facts to show that the story is true. This could be words from people who know a lot about the topic, numbers, or pictures.\n\nTopic 3: Thinking About the Story\nAfter we know the main parts and check the facts, we think about the story. We can ask:\n\n- Is the story told right?\n- Is something not matching up?\n- Who is telling the story and why?\n\nPart 3: Ending\nLearning about news takes time, but we can get better at it. Always ask questions and think about the story. By doing this, we can understand news stories better.\n\nConclusion:\nKnowing how to read news stories is important.

{"text": "Title: Fun with Water and Finding Gold!\n\n### Lesson:\n## Section 1: Introduction\nToday, we are going to learn about how water can help us find gold! We will see how water cleans the dirt and rocks to show the gold hidden underneath.\n\n### Section 2: What are Water Races?\nWater races are like little rivers made by people. They move water from a big river or stream to a place where people are looking for gold.\n\n### Section 3: How do Water Races Work?\nTo make a water race, people dig a path along a river or stream and line it with rocks. This stops the water from washing the path away. The water goes into this path and travels to a place where people are looking for gold. There, the water helps clean the dirt and rocks so we can see if theres any gold.\n\n### Section 4: Finding Gold\nFinding gold is done in steps. First, people look around to see where they might find gold. Then, they check the rocks and dirt to see if gold is really there. If they find gold, they use tools to get the gold out of the dirt and rocks. Lastly, they clean the gold and make it shiny and ready to use.\n\n### Section 5: Conclusion\nWater races are very helpful for finding gold. They bring water to places where people can wash the dirt and rocks to find gold. By looking carefully and cleaning the gold, it can be made ready to use.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 720, "idx": 14899, "original text": "Water Races and Gold! - 21 Oct 19.

Many in the room admitted that discussions regarding the soci-cultural factors impacting the mental wellness of college students do not take forefront in their day to day services. As such, the forum today provided them the relatively unique opportunity to consider the experiences in a way that diagnostic labels, university policies, and administrative paperwork do not. Stronger collaborations between student affairs and academic affairs were a reoccurring theme during our discussions as was the need for faculty training. I most enjoyed the passion apparent in the like-minded, student-centered professionals that attended the workshop.

{"text": "Title: How Cars Tell Us Problems\n\n### Section 1: Introduction\n\nToday, we will learn about how cars tell us they have problems and how we can help fix them. We will talk about the warning lights on the car and what happens when the car gets too hot. By the end of this, you will know how to spot and fix simple car troubles.\n\n### Section 2: Checking Warning Lights\n\nThe warning light on the dashboard tells us if there is a problem with the car. This light might turn on for small reasons like the gas cap being loose or for bigger reasons like a problem with the engine. To find out whats wrong, we use a special tool that helps read the cars computer. This tool tells us what part of the car needs our attention.\n\nHere are some ways to fix problems:\n\n1. Check the gas cap - Make sure it is on tight so the warning light doesnt turn on.\n2. Check the spark plugs - These help the car start and need to be clean.\n3. Check the air sensor - This helps the car use the right amount of air to run smoothly.\n4. Check the air flow sensor - This also helps the car run smoothly by measuring the air that goes to the engine.\n5. Check the exhaust cleaner - This part helps reduce pollution from the car. Make sure its not blocked.\n\n### Section 3: When the Car Gets Too Hot\n\nThe temperature gauge helps us see if the car is too hot. If the gauge shows higher than usual, it means there might be a problem like a leak or a part not working right.\n\nHeres what to do if the car is too hot:\n\n1. Check the coolant - This liquid helps keep the car cool. Make sure theres enough.\n2. Look for leaks - Check under the car for dripping coolant and fix any leaks.\n3. Check the thermostat - This part controls the temperature. Replace it if its not working.\n4. Check the water pump - This part helps circulate coolant. It might need to be replaced if its broken.\n5. Check the radiator - This part also helps keep the car cool. Make sure its not clogged or broken.\n\n### Section 4: Conclusion\n\nWe learned about two ways cars tell us theres a problem: the warning light and the temperature gauge. We talked about how to use tools and simple steps to fix these problems. By learning about different number patterns, you can help keep things working well and not have to fix big problems later.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 496, "idx": 263250, "original text": "0 Members and 1 Guest are viewing this topic..

{"text": "Lesson: All About Number Patterns\n\n### Section 1: Fun Number Patterns\n\nNumber patterns are groups of numbers that follow a simple rule. We use a special sign to show the total of a number pattern. There are different kinds of number patterns. Some add the same number every time, some multiply by a number, and some have special rules.\n\n### Section 2: Playing with Number Patterns\n\nImagine you have a number pattern starting with 3. You add 2 each time. There are 5 numbers in this pattern. To find the total, we do a simple math trick:\n\nTotal = (number of numbers / 2) * (first number + last number)\n\nHere, there are 5 numbers. The first number is 5, and the last number is 10. So the total is:\n\nTotal = (5/2) * (5 + 10) = 25\n\n### Section 3: Everyday Examples\n\nPretend you have a box with 10 candies, and you give away 2 candies every day for 5 days. How many candies are left?\n\nUsing our number pattern trick, we find out:\n\nTotal given away = (candies each day) * (days)\nTotal given away = 2 * 5 = 10\n\nThat means no candies are left in the box after 5 days.\n\n### Glossary\n- Number pattern: A group of numbers where each number follows a rule based on the one before it.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn this lesson, we learned about different kinds of number patterns and how to find their totals. We also saw how this helps us in everyday situations. By understanding number patterns, we can solve problems about groups of numbers and make smart choices.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 8, "len": 585, "idx": 478111, "original text": "The Honorable Scoundrels Trilogy. 4.1 \u2022 89 Ratings. - $3.99. - $3.99.

The idea of blending tuna and mayo into a sauce to be served over cold chicken (or veal breast, in the classic preparation, or tomatoes, in Melissa's version) seemed really weird, but one taste and I was hooked. I always make extra, and what I don't eat directly from the jar with a spoon (or, to be honest, my fingers) gets scooped onto crudit\u00e9s or slathered onto crusty bread. There's little it doesn't go with. When I read about this contest, the first thing that popped into my mind was tonnato; something magical happens when you combine great tuna with creamy avocados, and happily, this version exceeded my expectations. I have a feeling we'll turn to it again and again through this long, hot summer, and I hope you'll enjoy it, too. \u2014lastnightsdinner. See what other Food52ers are saying.. See Reviews.

{"text": "Lesson: Exploring and Making Oil and Gas\n\n### Section 1: Basic Ideas\n\nExploring and making oil and gas means looking for and getting oil and gas from the ground. This needs us to understand rocks and use special tools. We will learn simple ideas about how we find and get oil and gas.\n\n**Question:** What is exploring for oil and gas?\n**Answer:** Exploring for oil and gas is looking for new places under the ground where oil and gas might be hidden. People who study rocks and use special tools help find these spots.\n\n**Question:** What is making oil and gas?\n**Answer:** Making oil and gas is getting these hidden treasures from the ground. This means making holes in the ground, putting in tools, and pulling up the oil and gas.\n\n**Question:** How do we explore for oil and gas?\n**Answer:** We look at rocks, use tools to see under the ground, and make small test holes. Studying rocks tells us where oil or gas might be. Tools that listen to echoes help make a picture of the deep ground. If a place looks good, a test hole is made to see if there really is oil or gas.\n\n**Question:** What are some ways we explore for oil and gas?\n**Answer:** We can listen to echoes from the ground, keep track of the rock layers we go through, and look at tiny rock pieces from these layers. Listening to echoes helps make a picture of what is under the ground. Keeping track of rock layers gives us clues about the ground. Tiny rock pieces are looked at to learn more about them.\n\n### Section 2: Real-Life Stories\n\nNow that we know a bit about exploring and making oil and gas, let's see some real-life stories.\n\n**Example 1:** A person studying rocks might look at the layers and check for signs like oil marks or gas bubbles. They also see if the rocks can hold oil or gas well.\n\n**Example 2:** A person using tools to listen to the ground might look at their data to find good spots for oil or gas. These spots might have special rock shapes that show where oil or gas could be.\n\n**Example 3:** After making a test hole, people might look at the rock records and tiny rock pieces to learn about the types and quality of rocks they found.

Many players picked in this event become very famous.\n\nSection 2: How the Baseball Event Works\n\n**Topic 1: How does this Event Work?**\nThe baseball picking event has three parts and lasts three days. Teams take turns picking players based on how they did last year.\n\nIn the second part, teams can pick players who were not chosen on the first day. The last part lets teams pick players from other teams who are not protected.\n\n**Topic 2: Who can be Picked in this Event?**\nPlayers who can be picked are those who finished school or have played enough in college but havent signed with any team yet.\n\nSection 3: A Look at a Recent Baseball Event\n\n**Topic 1: Top Picks from a Recent Year**\nIn a recent year, one team picked a player from a big school on the sixth turn. Another team picked a player from another big school on the fifth turn.\n\n**Topic 2: What Can These Players Do?**  \nEthan has a chance to be a great pitcher. He can throw a ball really fast, and he knows how to throw different kinds of pitches. Benjamin can play in many spots on the field. He throws well and can hit the ball far.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe big baseball pick event helps teams find new, young players. It's a time when players talk to teams about playing for them.

{"text": "**Lesson: Making a Great Character**  \nIntroduction:\nIn games where you pretend to be someone else, characters are very important. They make the story fun and let players feel like they are part of it. Making a great character is like making art. You need to think of many things to make your character interesting. In this lesson, we will talk about how to think of a great character and share some tips to help you.\n\nSection 1: Thinking of Your Character\nFirst, think about who your character is. Think about where they came from and what has happened in their life. Think about what they are like and what they can do. Here are some things to think about:\n- Where did they grow up? What happened that was important in their life?\n- Are they friendly and fun or quiet and thoughtful?\n- What can they do? Are they strong and quick, or clever and wise?\n- Why do they do what they do? Is it because they love someone, want to make things right, or something else?\nAfter you have a good idea of your character, you can add more details.\n\nSection 2: Making Your Character\nNext, make your character using the game rules. This means picking things like their strength, skills, and what they can do. Here are some ideas:\n- Pick strengths and weaknesses that fit your character. For example, a strong and quick character might be very strong and fast, while a clever character might be very smart.\n- Choose skills that match your character's story and what they can do. For example, a sneak might be good at stealing and unlocking things, while a magic-user might know a lot about magic and spells.\n- Think about what your character can do in the game. For example, someone who is very charming might be able to get others to help them, and someone who is very quick might be good at jumping out of the way in games.\n\nSection 3: Making Your Character Real\n\nThe last part of making a super game character is to make them seem real when you play. Here are some ways to do this:\n- Use what your character is good at and not so good at to make them special.\n- Make friends with other characters in the game. Talk and play with them to make the game fun.\n- Always act like your character would, based on their story and what they are like.\n\nEnding:\nMaking a great character is very important in games where you pretend to be someone else. By thinking up your character, building them with game rules, and making them seem real in play, you can make a character everyone will remember and enjoy. Be creative and stay true to your character's story and what they are like.

Many people must agree before the suggestion goes to the next group. If both groups agree, they ask the states if they agree too.\n\nSection 2: Making the Change Official\n\nTo make the change official, lots of states must agree. They can talk and decide in two different ways. If enough states say yes, the change is made.\n\nSection 3: Ways to Change the Rules\n\nThere are two ways to suggest a change: the way we talked about before, or a big meeting where states send people to think of changes. The big meeting way has never been used.\n\nSection 4: Many People Must Agree\n\nLots of people in both special groups must say yes to suggest a change.

Cytotoxicity was measured by MTT assay, the percentage of mitoses and apoptotic cells was determined morphologically, apoptosis and S-phase was measured by flow cytometry, and estrogen-receptor activity was determined by semiquantitative measurement of the estrogen-responsive pS2 gene mRNA production. Tamoxifen (1 nM) alone had no effect on the percentage of the apoptotic cell fraction and significantly reduced the percentage of the S-phase, compared to untreated cells. Avemar (625 microg/mL) significantly increased apoptosis after 48 hours of treatment. Tamoxifen together with Avemar significantly increased apoptosis already 24 hours after starting treatment but had only a slight (not significant) effect on mitosis and S-phase. Estrogen-receptor activity of MCF-7 cells was enhanced by Avemar, decreased by tamoxifen, and was further decreased by combined tamoxifen and Avemar treatment. As apoptosis increased when Avemar was added to tamoxifen treatment, the use of supplementary therapy with Avemar in the case of ER+ breast tumors may enhance the therapeutic effects of tamoxifen.", "hash": "8f40e36ccc745e6817be04c90914b367cc2284ac99b77e99d6757a315c022aec"}

{"text": "Lesson: Introduction to Plant Growing\n\n**Objective:** To learn about different kinds of plant businesses and how they work.\n\n**Content:**\n\n1. What are plant businesses?\n\nPlant businesses are companies that grow plants and sell them to people. These companies take care of plants, make sure they grow well, and then sell them.\n\n2. How are plant businesses doing?\n\nSometimes, plant businesses do not sell as many plants. This can happen if not many people want to buy plants or if there are many other companies selling plants too.\n\n3. Good things about plant businesses\n\nEven when not many plants are sold, some companies that know a lot about growing plants can still do well. They know how to take care of plants and find new ways to sell them.\n\n4. Conclusion\n\nWhen plant businesses do not sell many plants, it might be a good chance to learn more about plants and think about good ways to grow and sell them. By learning about how these companies work, people can think of new ideas to help plants grow better and find new homes.\n\n**Glossary:**\n\n- Plant: A living thing that grows in the earth and has leaves, stems, and roots.\n- Business: A company that sells things or services to people.\n- Grow: To increase in size or amount.\n- Sell: To give something to someone in exchange for money.\n- Benefit: To get good things from something.\n- Positioned: To be in a good place.\n- Opening: The start of something.\n- Network: A group of people or things that are connected.\n- Quality: How good something or someone is.\n- Production: Making something.\n- Facility: A building for a special use.\n- Distribution network: Ways a product moves until it gets to the buyer.\n- Trend: The way something is changing or moving.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 5629, "idx": 437845, "original text": "Hemp.im \u00bb Finance \u00bb These cannabis stocks are expected to recover after July slump\n\nThese cannabis stocks are expected to recover after July slump\n\nJuly hasn\u2019t been kind to cannabis stocks as they fell in the double-digit percentage range. However, this has created a good opportunity to get bargains. Three names that are interesting to buy now are: Innovative Industrial Properties, HEXO, and OrganiGram Holdings. This October, the Canadian market for cannabis derivatives will open, and these companies are well-positioned to benefit from it.\n\nMost cannabis stocks have gone down in July. One does not have enough fingers to count all the companies which fell in the double-digit percentage range last month.\n\nOf course, that also creates good opportunities to get some bargains in your portfolio. Three names that might be especially suitable now are:\n\nInnovative Industrial Properties\n\nThe shares of Innovative Industrial Properties (IIP) are around 20 percent below the highs of the beginning of the year. The company issued nearly 1.5 million new shares in July. This thereby generated gross proceeds of more than $188 million. As it happens, investors do not like diluting the value of their shares.\n\nBut that does not change the stock of IIP itself. The additional cash the company has brought in makes this stock an even better buy. Why? Well, IIP has even more money to generate profits for its shareholders. The strategy is: IIP invests in more real estate then leases it to tenants in the cannabis industry.\n\nThe company recently announced that it has acquired a property in Massachusetts from Trulieve Cannabis. IIP then signed a contract to lease the property back to a Trulieve subsidiary for a 10-year period. The more leases IIP signs, the higher will be the recurring revenues. It is very possible that this stock is about to recover.\n\nHEXO\n\nHEXO has slipped a whopping 40 percent since peaking in early 2019. The cannabis producer recently became the target of a short seller. The person claimed that HEXO is violating Canadian cannabis marketing regulations when advertising its products on social media.\n\nQuebec province\u2019s decision to ban the sale of cannabis sweets could also have had a negative impact on HEXO\u2019s growth prospects. HEXO has a 30 percent market share in the province, thanks to a large multi-year supply contract signed last year.\n\nNevertheless, the big long-term opportunity for HEXO lies outside of Canada. Securing a medical cannabis license in Europe was a good step for the company. CEO Sebastien St-Louis said in June that HEXO is discussing a possible partnership with over 60 Fortune 500 companies. Analysts expect HEXO shares to rise again if the company acquires another major partner besides Molson Coors.\n\nOntario is expected to triple the number of retail stores opened by October. (Source)\n\nOrganiGram\n\nOrganiGram is another Canadian cannabis stock that recently slipped. The stock is around 30 percent below its previous highs this year. As with Innovative Industrial Properties and HEXO, however, the long-term prospects for OrganiGram is positive.\n\nOther Canadian cannabis producers are getting a lot more hype at the moment, but OrganiGram could develop very well and attract a lot of attention in the near future. The company posted a solid Q3 result in July, although it fluctuated due to market value changes. That being said, its management team is very disciplined in terms of costs. It is very rare in this industry.\n\nOrganiGram is expected to recover significantly in the next few months. The company should achieve record crops. Ontario aims to triple the number of retail stores opened by October. Quebec and Alberta will also significantly increase their retail locations.\n\nFirst published in Borse-Express, a third-party contributor translated and adapted the article from the original.

{"text": "Lesson Title: A Special Way to Help Babies Start\n\nIntroduction:\nIn this lesson, we will learn about a special way doctors help some babies start growing in the right place.\n\nSection 1: What is This Special Way?\nThis special way is when doctors take tiny baby seeds from a mommy and mix them with a daddy's seeds in a special room. Then, when the baby seeds start to grow a little, doctors put them back in the mommy, but not where you might think. They put them in a special tube where babies can start to grow.\n\nSection 2: How Does It Work?\nDoctors use a tiny tube to help put the baby seeds in the right place. They make a little cut and use a small camera to see where to go. This helps the baby seeds start growing in the right place.\n\nSection 3: Why Do Doctors Do This?\nSometimes, mommies need a little help so the baby seeds start growing in the right place. This special way helps when the usual place for baby seeds to grow isn't right because of a block or other reasons.\n\nPractical Example:\nImagine a mommy named Sarah and a daddy named Jack. They wanted to help their baby seeds start growing in the right place, so they went to the doctor. The doctor used this special way to help them.\n\nReal-world scenario:\nThis special way could also help a mommy who had to have a part of her body removed because it was sick, but she still wants to grow baby seeds in the right place.

Disadvantages of EIFT include the risk of infection and damage to the fallopian tubes during the procedure.\n\n**Topic 7: Critical thinking question**\nIf a woman has blocked fallopian tubes, what are the options for her to become pregnant?\n\nGlossary:\n- Embryo: A developing organism in the early stages of its life\n- Cleavage: The process by which a fertilized egg divides into two or more cells\n- Fallopian tube: A tube in the female reproductive system that connects the ovary to the uterus\n- Assisted reproductive technology (ART): A group of medical techniques used to help people with fertility problems have children\n- GIFT: A type of ART that involves inserting sperm directly into the fallopian tubes\n- IVF: A type of ART that involves fertilizing eggs with sperm in a laboratory dish\n\nConclusion:\nIn this lesson, we learned about EIFT, a technique used to transfer embryos from the laboratory to the fallopian tubes.

This is a narrow chute in which one or both sides can be moved towards the opposite side to squeeze an animal confined therein. Such chutes typically also include a head gate which closes around the neck of the animal to further restrain the animal.\nSuch conventional chutes require more than one person to operate them efficiently. Also, such chutes are relatively expensive and do require periodic maintenance and repair to keep them in good working order. Further, in order to release an animal from the chute, it is necessary to release the animal from the head gate, move the side panels away from each other, and open the front end of the chute enough to allow the animal to walk out the front of the chute. These steps normally require more than one person.\nThus, conventional chutes are inefficient and cumbersome for one person to work an animal.

{"text": "Lesson: A Story from a Faraway Land\n\nIntroduction:\nToday, we will learn about a story from a faraway land. Long ago, some people believed in a hero named Rama.

They thought this would make their place better.\n\nSection 1: The Story of Rama\n\nQuestion: Why did some people talk a lot about Rama?\nAnswer: These people liked Rama very much. They used pictures and stories of Rama to share their ideas.

New anticonvulsant choices, such as levetiracetam and lacosamide have been explored as alternative emergent therapies. Anecdotal reports on the use of other generation anticonvulsants and nonpharmacologic therapies for the treatment of refractory and super-refractory status epilepticus have been described.Finally, recent evidence has examined etiology-guided management of status epilepticus in certain patient populations, such as immune-mediated, paraneoplastic or infectious encephalitis and anoxic brain injury.

This might happen when leaders decide things that many people don't like or if they dont know what regular people need.\n\nTopic 3: How do leaders say they speak for people?\nExample: When a leader said, \"Today, we all support our friend from another place,\" he was trying to speak for everyone. But this doesnt mean everyone agreed with him.\n\nSection 2: Talking About Ideas and Choosing Wisely\n\nTopic 1: Why should we talk about ideas?\nDiscussion: Talking about different ideas is good because it lets everyone share what they think. It helps us understand more and make better choices.\n\nTopic 2: How does talking about ideas help us choose better?\nExample: Talking about whether it's a good idea to disagree with another country can help us understand what could happen. This makes us think more about whether it's a good idea or not.\n\nSection 3: Real Stories\n\nTopic 1: How do these ideas about leaders and people happen in real life?\nExample: During an election, a leader said, \"We are ready for change and we are the change.\" But not everyone agreed with his ideas.\n\n[PARAGRAPH]Topic 2: How can we apply the lessons learned from this topic to new problems? Discussion: By understanding the complexities of political elites and their relationship with the AM country people, we can better evaluate the claims of politicians and hold them accountable for their actions. We can also use this knowledge to inform our own decision-making processes and work towards creating a more democratic society.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, understanding the relationship between political elites and the AM country people is an important aspect of being an informed citizen. By debating issues and holding politicians accountable for their actions, we can work towards creating a more just and democratic society.", "source": "refinedweb", "s": 5, "len": 887, "idx": 326251, "original text": "But what these political elites do not necessarily have is the support of the American people.

Abstract. In this paper, we evaluate the economic cost of the Islamic State on the Syrian and Iraqi economies from 2010 to 2016. To do so, we use the Post-Terrorism Final Economic Damage Simulator\u2014PTFED-Simulator. The PTFED-Simulator assesses the economic damage of terrorism based on ten different indicators: (1) total regional terrorism tension (\u2206Tt); (2) harmonized anti-terrorist strategy (AT+); (3) war losses from terrorism (\u2212\u03c0t); (4) total economic leakage from terrorism (\u2212\u03a8t); (5) economic desgrowth from terrorism (\u2212\u03b4t); (6) military dimension of terrorism (MDt); (7) post-terrorism economic damage (\u2212\u03a0t); (8) post terrorism economic damage evaluation; (9) post-terrorism reconstruction plan (PTRt); and (10) terrorism effect on mega-disk networks mapping.

{"text": "Lesson: Understanding Houses\n\nIntroduction:\nWhen we look at houses to see if they are good to buy, we think about how much money they can make. This lesson talks about the simple ways to see if a house is good to buy, like how much money is left after paying for things the house needs.\n\nSection 1: Learning About House Buying\n\nTopic 1: Money Left Over\nMoney left over is the money you still have after you pay for everything the house needs. It's important because it shows if the house can make more money than it costs to keep.\n\nTopic 2: House Return Rate\nThis is how we see if a house is a good buy based on how much money it makes compared to its price. A bigger number means a better buy.\n\nTopic 3: Yearly Return Rate\nThis is how much money you can get back each year from your house, thinking about how long you keep the house. A bigger number means it's a better house to buy.\n\nSection 2: Figuring Out If a House is Good to Buy\n\nTopic 1: Figuring Out Money Left Over\nTo find out the money left over, take away all the costs of the house from the money it makes. This includes the money you pay to the bank, taxes, insurance, and fixing things in the house.\n\nTopic 2: Figuring Out House Return Rate\nTo find this, first find out how much money the house makes after costs and how much it costs to buy the house. Then, divide the money made by the house price.\n\nTopic 3: Figuring Out Yearly Return Rate\nTo find this, you need to know how much money you get back from the house and how long it takes to get back the money you spent at the start. A bigger number means it's a better house to buy.\n\nSection 3: Using What We Learned to Pick Houses\n\nTopic 1: Comparing Houses\nUsing the money left over, house return rate, and yearly return rate, you can see which house might give you more money back. A house that costs less but has a higher return rate might be better than one that costs more but has a lower return rate.\n\nTopic 2: Looking at Risk\nBuying a house is like picking a toy. You think about where it is, what it looks like, and if it is a good one. When picking a house to buy, you should think about these things to know if it will be a good deal.\n\nIn the end:\nBuying a house is a big job. By learning how to pick a good one, people can make smart choices about which houses to buy and get the most fun and use from them.", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 797, "idx": 300561, "original text": "Description\n\nAmazing building - like new construction - renovated ground up in 2010.

{"text": "Lesson Title: Learning About Growing Plants\n\nIntroduction:\nGrowing plants is about making new plants that are strong and healthy. One way to do this is by mixing two different plants to make a new plant. This new plant can be very strong and grow well.\n\nMain Idea:\nThis lesson helps you learn how to mix plants to make them better.\n\nSection 1: What is Plant Growing?\n\nTopic 1: What is Plant Growing?\n- Growing plants means making new plants that are strong and can fight sickness, grow a lot, and handle different weather.\n\nTopic 2: Why Grow Plants?\n- Growing plants helps us make better plants that give more food, fight sickness better, and can grow in different places.\n\nSection 2: Mixing Plants\n\nTopic 1: What is Mixing Plants?\n- Mixing plants means taking two different plants and making a new one that takes good things from both.\n\nTopic 2: How to Mix Plants?\n- To mix plants, we put pollen from one plant on another plant.\n- This makes seeds that are a mix of both plants.\n\nSection 3: Trying Out Mixing Plants\n\nTopic 1: Why Mix Plants?\n- We mix plants to make new ones that are strong, healthy, and give lots of food.\n\nTopic 2: An Example of Mixing Plants\n- For example, when we mix two different types of plants, we get F1 seeds. These seeds are special because they are strong and give lots of food.\n\nSection 4: Ending Thoughts\n\nIn the end, mixing plants is a great way to make new plants that are strong and healthy. By understanding how to mix plants, we can make better plants and grow more food.\n\nGlossary:\n- Pollen: Tiny parts from plants that help make seeds.\n- Stigma: A part of a flower that catches pollen.\n- Style: A tube in a flower that connects the stigma to a part where seeds start.\n- Ovary: A part of the flower where seeds begin.\n- Fertilization: When parts from two plants join to start making seeds.\n\nSelf-Debate Discussion:\n- What are good and not-so-good things about mixing different kinds of plants?\n- How can mixing plants help make better plants in different places?\n- What could go wrong when making new kinds of plants by mixing them?", "source": "minipile", "s": 5, "len": 922, "idx": 434294, "original text": "Production of interspecific hybrids between commercial cultivars of the eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) and its wild relative S. torvum.\nInterspecific hybrids between cultivars of eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) and its wild relative S. torvum, which has disease resistance and desirable traits for crop improvement, were obtained by cross-hybridization and embryo rescue.
