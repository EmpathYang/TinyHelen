He was the 84th big leader of law from February 9, 2017 to November 7, 2018.\nBefore being the big leader of law, he was a helper in the group of leaders from AL state. He is part of the Elephant Party. At the time he was a helper, he ranked 15th in how long he had been a leader in the group of leaders. He was the most senior helper when Barbara left in January 2017 to February 2017.\nIn November 2019, Jack said that he would try to get his old helper seat back in 2020. But he lost the Elephant Party's choice to Tommy.\nJack was born in SE town, AL state on a winter day in December 1946. His dad was Jack, Jr., and his mom was Abbie. He grew up in CA town, AL state. Samuel got two big prizes from his school and from the university in AL country. From 1981 to 1993, he worked as an important person in the legal system in the southern part of AL country. Samuel was chosen as the main legal person of AL country in 1994.\nSamuel was chosen to be in an important group called the Senate in 1996 and then again in 2002, 2008, and 2014. Samuel was one of the members of the Senate who liked to keep things the old way.\nAs a senator, he is known for not liking people who come into the country without permission and for wanting less people to come to the country. He supported the big changes made by George, the leader of the country at that time, including the packages of tax cuts in 2001 and 2003, the big war, and a plan to not allow same-gender marriage.\nHe did not like the plan to help banks that were in trouble, the bill to help the economy in 2009, the act to protect patients and make health care more affordable, and the act to allow people to not have to tell their sexual preference in the military. As a leading member of a group in the Senate, he did not like any of the three people that Barack, the leader of the country, suggested for the highest court.\nSamuel was one of the first people to support Donald's campaign to be the leader of the country in 2016. Samuel was thought of as a possible person to be the second most important person in the country, but Donald chose Mike, the governor of IN country.\nSamuel left the Senate to become the main legal person in the country on February 8, 2017.\nOn November 18, 2016, it was announced that Donald, who was going to be the next leader of the country, planned to suggest Samuel for the position of main legal person in the country.\nOn a winter day in 2017, some important people started talking about whether Sam should get a new job. The group said yes on the first day of February, with 11 saying yes and 9 saying no. A few days later, Sam got the job. He was given the job by a man named Victor on the second day after. On a spring day in 2018 he made a new rule that was not very nice. It made children and their moms live apart at the border.\nAs a big boss, Sam changed a note given by Ethan to make less people go to jail for a long time, and made it so that people could go to jail for a longer time. Sam let the police take things from people who they thought did bad things but were not in trouble yet. Sam did not like it when people came to the country without asking first. He was very tough on places that did not follow the rules about who can come to the country. He said that these places would not get money from the country, but this did not work. As a big boss, Sam said it was okay for the people at his job to make it hard for people who gave special medicine.\nOn a fall day in 2018, a man named Thomas said that Sam could not be a big boss anymore.\nIn the fall of 2019, Sam started thinking about going back to his old job. He said he wanted his old job back on a fall day in 2019.\nSam did not get his old job back when he tried in the summer of 2020. A big newspaper said, \"Sam does not get his old job back in AL state as Thomas helps end the work of a person he used to like but does not like anymore.\"\nSamuel and his wife Mary have three children and six grandchildren.

SR Air operates over 560 flights every week.\nSR Air goes to 113 places in 51 countries (including places it goes with other companies) from its main hub located at BA Airport near CO city. SR Air joined the big group of airplane companies on a spring day in May, 2014.\nAir Lanka was started when the SL government closed down another company. Air Lanka had two planes borrowed from other companies. On April 24, 1980, they got a new plane. On November 1, 1980, Air Lanka started using a big plane.\n\nOn April 15, 1982, Air Lanka got their own plane. They stopped using the older planes and sold them. They got two more planes from other companies. On May 1, 1982, a company took over the care of two of Air Lanka's planes.\n\nOn March 28, 1980, Air Lanka signed a paper to buy two new planes. These were the best big planes in the world at that time. The first plane was picked up on August 26, 1982. It flew to NE city. On August 28, the plane flew from NE city to CO city. It reached CO city on August 29. The second plane was named \"City Of Jayawardanapura\". On June 8, 1984, the airline got a plane named \"King Vijaya\" and another one later. The big machines that can fly were used for trips to AS country and a few trips to southeast places.\nAir Adam, which was owned by the people in power, was partly sold in 1998, with money from people in EM country. During this time, EM country and the people in power in AS country made a 10-year plan. This plan gave EM country the right to be the only ones to take care of all the big machines that can fly and make food for people on the planes at CO airport for ten years. EM country bought part of Air Adam and wanted to make it look better and get new machines that can fly. The people in power kept most of Air Adam but let EM country make the big decisions. In 1998, the name of Air Adam was changed to SriLankan Airlines.\nSriLankan got 6 more big machines to go with its others. The A330-200 machines joined the airline between a month in fall 1999 and a month in summer 2000. The company's fourth A340-300 arrived at CO airport painted in the airline's new colors. SriLankan made its existing A340 better by adding a place for business people and a place for other people and changing the inside to show the new look.\nThe airline started going to more places with more added for places close to home, like IN country and CH country. While adding more places in the region, SriLankan started flying to RI city, its third place in SA country, after two other cities. This made the number of places it goes to in the Middle East nine. The plane company made a new stop at a new place, making it the 51st place it flew to.\nIn a year a while back, a big company called EM told the SL government that it didn't want to manage the plane company anymore. The big company said that the SL government wanted to have more control. EM sold almost half of what it owned of the plane company to the government. This happened in a year a bit later, and then the two companies didn't have anything to do with each other anymore.\nWhen the big company left, the plane company had made a lot of money that year. But from that year until seven years later, when the government was in charge, the plane company lost a lot of money.\nAfter the government took over, they made a decision to make the CO city a place for planes to stop when going to Asia. The first place they added to their plan was the SH city, and they started flying there on a summer day. Then, they started flying to the PA city in the first month of a year a bit later.\nThe plane company joined a team of other plane companies in the fifth month of another year. During that year, it started to buy new and more planes, all from a company called AI. Right now, the plane company only uses planes from AI, except for the small planes they don't use anymore. They stopped using the last small plane with a flight from the CO city to the MA city.\nThe plane company stopped flying to three places in Europe - the FR city, the PA city, and the RO city - by the end of a year a bit later.\nThe big flying company took in the work of its sister flying company in a fall month to make a stronger flying company for SR country. So, the big flying company got two of the sister company's flying machines and took over all of its flying paths. This added ten new places to the big flying company's map.\nIn another fall month, the big flying company started flying straight to AU country every day without stopping, its first big new far away flying path in over five years and the biggest new thing it's done so far. The flights started a regular flying path between AU country and SR country again after a long time of 16 years.", "hash": "96079add69101b47fed12c1802bb43354605c5dee70b8c9a8a7e0913f2b62968"}

This is different from pictures that make people feel funny feelings.\nFor many picture takers, taking pictures of people with no clothes is a way to learn about the human body, much like some paintings did.\nTaking a picture of a named person is called portrait taking. Taking pictures of people with no clothes focuses on showing the human body, and often you can't see the face.\nUsually, picture taking of people with no clothes is a \"planned picture\", not a quick snap. Picture taking of people with no clothes wants to show a special picture of the human body. Picture takers sometimes use lots of light and dark, shiny skin, and shadows falling across the body to show how the body looks.\nEarly picture takers often showed women with no clothes like the one we see here by Frank. Many, like Ethan, Jerry, Adam, Rachel and Jack, liked to show the lines of a body as a piece of art. They used the words \"art nude\" and \"figurenude\" from painting to avoid suggestions that their works were meant to make people feel funny feelings.", "hash": "31fc48aa6936594b0604247246a9d460aabd6d2b9fb2c97406a243b5a90582d6"}

He was the first leader of OR state from a time close to 1860 until a few years later.\\nBorn in DI county, Jack's parents were farmers. He didn't go to school much, so he learned most things by himself. He did many different jobs like making things out of wood, and he said he would fight in a war but didn't have to. In 1849, he went to look for gold and earned enough to move his family to a farm in LA county, OR state. In OR, he helped the Democratic Party, and was chosen to be a Judge for LA county (a time close to 1856), then he worked in the Territorial Legislature (a time close to 1857).\\nOR was getting ready to become a state in 1857, as people had just said yes to a state constitution. Jack was chosen by some people in the Democratic Party to run for the first state leader election, which happened in June 1858. Jack won by a lot, and was officially made leader on July 8, 1858. He didn't start his job until they got the news that Congress had said yes to OR's statehood bill on February 14, 1859. Technically, OR had two leaders during this time, as Territorial Leader George was legally in charge until the state government-in-waiting could start their work.\\nOnce he started his job, the new leader worked to sort out the many land claims and counter claims on public lands. He also liked ideas that made people in OR country able to make things by themselves. Even though people called him \"Honest Jack\", he still had strong ideas that not everyone liked. Jack thought it was okay for people to have slaves, which made people who didn't like slavery very angry. Some people even called him a bad man when the US was about to have a big war.\\nJack wasn't chosen again by his group in the 1862 election, so he left his job. But he stayed involved in local politics, winning three times as a state helper (1866-1870), and being chosen for the State Helpers Group in 1870.\\nJack was chosen for the Big Helpers Group in 1878, as OR country's big helper. His group was weak in the House, and needed one more vote to win. They needed the vote by a day in March, 1879. Jack, who was already going to WA city, heard about this while on a boat between PO city and SA city. When he arrived in SA city on March 12th, a train helper met him and rushed him to a special train. The regular long journey train had left 25 hours earlier, but Jack's train managed to catch up with it. He arrived in WA city in the morning of that day in March, just in time to be seated by the Big Helpers Group and give his vote.\\nThe trip cost a lot of money at the time, and people who didn't like the Democrats and people who write news talked a lot about it. William's journey\\nWilliam worked in a big house where leaders meet until 1881, then he went to live on his farm near EU city.\\nWilliam was asked to help with politics again in 1885 when the president of US country, Cameron, gave him a job in OR state to collect money at the PO city big house. After 1890, he moved back to EU city, buying a lot of land in the middle of the city. Now, people in EU city call this place \"William's Addition\". He lived in EU city until he passed away in the early 20th century.\\nAdam\\nAdam was a man who helped to lead US country. He was the leader of OR state from the time between 1862 and 1866.\\nAdam was born on a summer day in July in CA county, NE city. He went to school and then became a teacher. Later, he became a lawyer and moved to CA state in 1849.\\nIn 1850, Adam moved to OR region. There he moved to the town of GA on a big river where he became a member of the big house of leaders in 1852. He also got a job in GA, which was at the mouth of the big river.\\nThen in 1860 Adam moved to PO city, OR state, where he was elected to the state house. Next, in 1862 he was elected as the leader of OR state, being the leader during a big war in US country. During the war in 1864, he made a group of soldiers, even though some people in OR state didn't want him to.", "hash": "8fd89f7a00b4ee23aab3cdd4607e179c7a6d4209569e4ae2b5e6af89a4be8648"}

{"idx": 83883, "text": "Emma\nEmma was a lady who liked to write poems and stories. She was liked a lot in the 1920s and 1930s. People also liked her because she was pretty and nice. She was called the best poem writer in the 1920s.\nEmma was born in a city in NE country on a day in September. She came from a well-known family. Her dad's name was Henry and her mom's name was Anne. Emma was the oldest of five kids.\nWhen Emma was twelve, they moved to WA city. This was when her dad got a new job. Emma went to a school near PA town. Then she went to two other schools in WA city. She finished school in 1904. At an art place, she learned to draw. As a girl, she liked reading books.\nJust over a year after she finished school, she married a man named Patrick. Together they had a son. But she left Patrick and their son in 1910. She went to EN country with a man named Horace. He was a lawyer in WA city, was married and was older than Emma. A lot of people talked about this.\nHannah's husband finally said yes to not being married anymore, and a man named Henry was very sad and decided to not live anymore. In 1916, Emma and William came back to AM country and got married. In 1919, they moved to WA city. There she met with famous writers. They said she should share her poems.\nFirst she sent poems to a famous poetry book. The book said yes to her poems. In 1921, she made a book of poems called \"nets to catch the wind.\" Both people who know a lot about books and normal people liked it a lot. Now, Emma became famous. People liked her poems, her nice personality, and her beauty.\nEmma left her second husband and moved to live in NE city. In 1923, she stopped being married to William and married a man named William who liked books and wrote poems. Even though they stayed married, she lived away from him, too. But she would visit him after they lived separately.\nIn 1928, Emma became very sick. On a winter day in December 1928, she suddenly became very sick and died in NE city.\nAccording to a woman named Evelyn, Emma \"believed fully that a poet's job, as a man named Wallace says, is to make sense of what happens in life.\"\nShe liked old poems. These included the Metaphysical poems and the Romantic poems. Her favorite poet was a man named Patrick. He influenced Emma's style a lot. Emma's Poems\\nEmma liked to write poems that followed rules. For example, many of her poems were short and rhymed. She also liked to describe things in her poems.\\nAll of Emma's long made-up stories were like teaching stories. They talked about magical or weird things. She called these make-believe stories \"fairy tales\".\\nEmma was mostly a poet, but she also wrote four well-liked long made-up stories, or fairy tales, as well as short stories and little essays.", "hash": "a91dec62c34d463efae839510232600be5f47e8f98a443cfcb0765e4a3fa9673"}
{"idx": 3326, "text": "Super Mario Game\\nSuper Mario Game is a game made by NI company for their game machine in 1996. It was the first game in the \"Mario\" set that used shapes that looked like real life. Many people who play games and people who write about games think it is one of the best games ever.\\nPrincess Penelope makes a special cake and asks Mario to her castle in MU land. When Mario gets there, he finds out that Bowser has taken over the castle and took Penelope. To beat Bowser and save Penelope, Mario goes into each world on painted walls. The main place in the game is Penelope's castle. The player can open doors by collecting stars. There are 120 of them hidden in 15 maps and some hidden maps. The player can get each of the stars by doing each of the tasks per level. One world needs two stars, for example. Each locked door leads to more levels and tasks. Mario can also leave the castle and look around the small yard.\\n\"Super Mario Game\" was made in less than two years, but it was said that Samuel had thought about a 3D \"Mario\" game, called \"Super Mario Fun\", five years before, while working on \"Star Journey\". Matthew had many ideas when making a fun game during the time of the super game machine (SGM). He thought about using a special chip to make it a SGM game, but decided to make it for the big game machine because the SGM wasn't strong enough. On his talk page, David said that there was never a \"Super Man FX\" game made, and \"Super Man FX\" was just the secret name of the special chip.\nThey started making the game with making the characters and how the camera sees them. Matthew and the other makers weren't sure what the game should be like; they spent a lot of time picking how the camera should see the game. The first idea was to have the game follow a fixed path, kind of like a board game, before they chose to make it a free-moving 3D game. Even though most of \"Super Man 64\" ended up being a 3D game where you can move around, some parts of the game still followed a fixed path, especially in the three boss fights. One of the makers of \"Super Man 64\", Gabriel, said that these parts were kept to make players go to the boss's house instead of just wandering around. The team spent a lot of time and worked hard to make Man's movements look right. Before they made the levels, they were testing and making Man's moves perfect on a simple grid. The first test game they used to try out controls and how things move had Man and a golden bunny named \"Mr. Bunny\" by the makers (named after the type of brain used by the big game machine), and the bunny was put in the final game as a way to find two of the power stars. At the start, the people who made the game wanted to have two players using both Mario and Luigi. They wanted the two characters to start at different parts of the big house and play through the game together. But, they couldn't make it work like that.\nSamuel, who was leading the making of \"a famous game\", wanted to \"put in more little things\" than other games before it. Some of these little things came from real life. For example, the Boos are like assistant director Thomas's wife, who, as Samuel said, \"is very quiet most of the time, but one day she got really mad because Thomas was at work too much. In the game, there is now a character that gets small when Mario looks at it, but when Mario looks away, it gets big and scary.\" \"A famous game\" also has more puzzles than earlier games with Mario. It was made at the same time as \"a famous drama\", but because \"a famous drama\" came out more than two years later, some puzzles were taken from that game for \"a famous game\".\nPeople first heard about \"a famous game\" in a month near the end of the year, and a version of the game that you could play was shown just days later at the big reveal for the NE64 (then known as NE's \"Ultra 64\") at NE Space World. The basic ways of playing had at this point been decided, and the game was about half finished, although most of the game's levels were still being made. Thirty-two levels were made for the game. Matthew had a plan to make lots of fun games, maybe even 40! But in the end, he could only make 15.\nIn a fun game made for a special playing machine, there's a special stage where you can play on the roof of Princess Taylor's castle.\nIn another fun game, Taylor's stage is a big birthday cake that you can travel through.\nIn 1999, they wanted to make a second part of the game for a special playing machine, but they had to stop because the machine didn't sell well. In this game, Liam was supposed to be playable and there would be a game where more than one person can play. A new version of the game was made in 2004 for a special playing machine. In this game, Mario, Liam, and William all get a letter saying Taylor baked a cake for them. A bad guy has taken Taylor, Mario, Liam, and William and trapped them in Taylor's castle, by some other bad guys. Yoshi is told that he must save them. Yoshi finds a rabbit and opens the door to the castle. When the player finds keys, they save a character, and can play as them. This game also has a special game where up to four people can play and small games which are unlocked by getting keys from rabbits. Here, there are 150 shiny things in the sky, 30 more than in the first game.", "hash": "9de0bc603832af41ed2d34dc565da137d270675be03460f5aaf7da9b7ee4e609"}

Its name means \"horned male goat\" or \"goat horn\", and it is often shown as a pretend animal that is half goat, half fish. Its symbol is (a picture).\nCA region is one of the many star patterns we see in the sky, and was also one of the 48 star patterns listed by a man who looked at the stars a long time ago.

Its brightest stars make a triangle with corners at CH star, CA star, and CA star.\nCharlie's Triangle has several tiny star groups and spiral patterns. M30 is a group of stars that is very close to the tiny star group NGC 7103. The picture also has the big spiral pattern NGC 6907.\nEven though it is hard to see, Charlie's Triangle has a long story. It has always been shown as a goat-fish since a very long time ago. The oldest picture of Charlie's Triangle is from a long time ago. From that time, it became a popular picture on stones that mark boundaries. It was written down in old star books as \"The Goat-Fish\" before a very long time ago. The picture was a symbol of a powerful man and in the old times it marked the shortest day of the year.\nBecause of the shift of the seasons, the shortest day of the year is no longer when the sun is in Charlie's Triangle. The star sign called Charlie now begins with the shortest day of the year. The sun's lowest point is now called the Tropic of Charlie. This also means the line on our world where the sun is right above us at noon on the longest day.\nThe planet NE was found in this star group by a man from GE country named Gabriel, near a star called DE on a fall day in the mid 19th century, which makes sense because you can see this star group best early in the morning in September.\nIn CH country's star study, this star group is in \"The Black Turtle of the North\".\nCapricorn the sea goat was a goat that wanted to rule the world. The gods of a far away land didn't like that and they used their power to stop him with a lightning bolt from the god named Zachary.

{"idx": 5232, "text": "Apple Farm\nApple Farm is a short story by George Orwell. It was written during a big war and published in the late 20th century. It is about a group of farm animals who don't like their farmer. They want to make a place where all animals can be the same, free, and happy. But in the end, things go wrong and the farm is as bad as it was before.\nThe story is a special kind of story, which means that the writer wanted it to show real things that happened. It is one of the most famous stories about important events. It is based on a man's bad actions after an important change in RU country.\nEven though some people did not want to print it, when it was printed it became very popular. \"Apple Farm\" is one of the two most famous books by the writer (the other is \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\") and many people think it is a very good book. A famous magazine chose the book as one of the 100 best stories in the English language (from the early to mid 20th century). it also was number 31 on the Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels. It won a special prize in 1996, and is included in the Great Books of the Western World selection.\nThe farm is owned by Mr. Jack, a mean and always drunk farmer. One day, all the animals come to a meeting to listen to Old Major, a wise old pig. Old Major talks to the animals, telling them to fight back against their farmers. The animals are very happy about the plan. Oliver the pig passes away a few days later. The pigs, who are the smartest animals, start planning a big change. They are led by Sam and Nathan.\nAbout three months later, the animals stand up against Mr Jack and take over the farm. They change its name to \"Animal Place\". They decide the farm will now be run only by animals, calling the system \"animalism\". They write seven big rules, with the most important being \"All animals are friends\". Four legs good, two legs bad becomes a fun chant for the sheep. Mr Jack and his friends try to take the farm back, but in the \"Big Cow Fight\" the animals make them leave. Mr Jack runs away and never comes back.\nSam and Nathan start to disagree with each other, as they have different ideas for how Animal Place should be run. Sam makes plans to build a windmill, but Nathan doesn't agree. Nathan trains nine puppies, who grow into big, mean dogs who will work for him. When the dogs are fully grown, he uses them to chase Sam off the farm. He takes over and runs the farm by himself (as a boss). Nathan uses the dogs to scare any animal that does not agree with him, while a pig named Sophie keeps telling the animals that everything is ok and they should support Nathan.\nNathan changes his mind and decides to build a windmill, pretending that it was his plan all along. The first big fan they build falls down. Nathan blames this (and other problems) on Samuel. He says that Samuel is sneaking around AN Farm ruining everything. Many animals are gone because they \"talked to Samuel\". Nathan starts working with human beings outside, even though this used to be a no-no. One of them is their friend next door, a farmer called Mr. Frank. He brings in a group of men who come into the farm and destroy the second big fan. The animals fight them off in the \"Big Fan Fight\", but it was hard.\nAs the animals build a third big fan, Benjamin, their strongest horse, gets tired because he is old and falls down. Nathan sends him away, even though Benjamin was his friend. The pigs continue to work with humans and start to act like them, such as living in the big house and walking on two legs. They teach the sheep a new song: Four legs good, two legs better. The big rules are changed by the words \"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.\" In the end, other animals watch the pigs talking with a group of humans and decide they cannot tell which is which.\nGabriel who did not like when one person ruled everything. In particular, he did not like the big rulers of JO country. In a time of war, Gabriel fought. He saw as good rebels were pushed out by bad rebels. In a special book introduction, Oliver shared that he wrote the book because he wanted to show that a story that people believed was not true.\nOliver shared that he thought of the story when he saw a young boy being mean to a big horse. He thought, \"What if the horse knew how strong it was? The boy wouldn't be able to control it, and it's the same when people are not nice to others who don't have much money\".\nThere are many characters in the book who are like real people. They are grouped into pigs, horses, humans and other animals.\nIt also has a character named Bobbin the 3-legged spider who shows up before a big change happens.\nAnimal-ism is what the farm animals of MA farm believe in. The idea is to make sure the farm animals act like real animals and not like humans. So, any human-like behavior is not part of Animalism.\n\"Song of the Animals\" is a song that is in the story. The song is said to be \"a mix between a popular kids' song and a famous old song\". Old Matthew teaches the song to the animals in an early part of the story, and it becomes very popular. It becomes the first special song of Animal Farm. Later, Napoleon orders a new song to be written, with words that say good things about him.\nThese are the first rules made by the pigs.\nFor the sheep, who are sometimes not very smart, they learn the words \"Four legs good, two legs bad.\" Nathan sometimes has the sheep say these words when he wants the animals to stop talking.\nAs the story goes on, the pigs start to change the rules. For example, \"No animal shall drink juice\" becomes \"No animal shall drink juice \"too much\"\". By the end of the story, all the rules have been wiped away except for \"All animals are friends\", which has been changed to \"All Animals are friends but some animals are better friends than others.\" Meanwhile, the words the sheep say have been changed to \"Four legs good, two legs \"better\".\"", "hash": "b8f0fdd6db02b7513a30c749860fa7dd0dda39f0ac40217870e951acebfec6fa"}

People say that from the top of SN hill, you can see all around to far away places.\nThe island has nice weather. Summers are not too hot and winters are not too cold, but it does rain a lot. It rains just like in the other BR islands. The tall parts of the island get more rain, especially SN hill. The top and bottom parts of the island don't get as much rain as the rest.\nThe island is usually not too hot or too cold. The hottest it has ever been is a little less than 30 degrees, in RO place. The island does not get a lot of sun, but it's also not too cloudy because the wind blows the clouds away.\nLong, long ago, the island had a big ocean that's no longer there. You can't see it, but it's still there in the rocks.\nThe island became its own place away from IR country and the BR islands a very long time ago.

It was used a lot from the old days to the early part of the last century, and very, very rarely, it's still used today. In OWS, wires were held to the wood by round hard things, and were protected by tube hard things when they went through a piece of wood. Wires were tied to the round hard things by another piece of wire that didn't carry electricity. Something called loom protected the wire when it entered a box, which usually had a plug, switch, or light in it. The wires were stuck together and wrapped in cloth tape. The protection on OWS was usually cloth soaked in a sticky black stuff. To keep electricity from jumping from one wire to another, the wires were kept far apart. This is not needed with the way we set up electricity today because the protection on the wires today is enough to stop electricity from jumping. OWS didn't have a special wire and therefore didn't have plugs with three holes. Some rules about electricity let people use a special plug to change OWS plugs to three-hole ones without putting in any new wire.\\nOWS used cloth for protection. Over time this protection can wear out, become hard, and fall off, leaving bare wire. The round and tube hard things provide some protection because even if the protection does fall off, the bare wire can not touch the wood. The protection is also somewhat able to catch fire. Some old wires for buildings had a dangerous thing inside them that could make people very sick. This thing could stop fires but it was not good for people. The wires were not kept safe like they are now. If the wires broke, it could make a spark and start a fire. The boxes with the switches could cause problems if you put the wrong switch in. The wrong switch could make the wires too hot and could start a fire. People sometimes did silly things like put coins or small balls of metal in place of a broken switch, which is very dangerous. These problems can be fixed a bit by putting in a new box with safer switches. There was also no safety wire. The old wires can be made safer with a special safety switch. Most of the time, there's no need to replace the old wires if they are in a good shape.\n\nUnlike new wires, the old wires were sometimes not kept together. In some old buildings, many different circuits could share the same wire, which could be dangerous. To stop this from causing problems, there were safety switches for these wires. If a safety switch was taken out, it could make a situation where it seemed like the power was off, but it was actually still on. Some switches could be wired in a way that the outside of a lamp, which is usually safe, could be connected to the power, which could give you a shock.", "hash": "0bb56f2a2f13b732fedc23c70e211b4768fb30931a8376a2e7c184dbcc1c0b9a"}

It tells about the life of a prince named Matthew, who later helped many people. The movie was made by Bella, Samuel, and Steve. It had songs written by Samuel. The music was made by Henry. The movie had voices of very famous people. Some singers sang the songs in the movie instead of the actors. But some actors like Madison, Ryan, Olivia (who sang her song in many, many languages), Samuel, and Matthew sang their songs themselves.\\nThe movie was liked by many people. Because it was so good, they made another movie before this one and a play. It won a prize for a song called \"When You Believe\" at a big movie award in the late 20th century. The song was sung at the award show by Whitney and Mariah. The song was written by Samuel and Henry. It was also helped made better by a person named Benjamin. The song was liked at another award show too.\\nThe movie was shown to people on a winter day in the late 20th century. It was put out for people to watch at home one day in the fall of 1999. The movie made a lot of money all over the world. It was the second cartoon movie not made by WD company to make more than $100 million in the US. This was after, PM/NC's \"The Rugrats Movie\". \"The Prince of EG city\" was the cartoon movie that made the most money until the year 2000. Then, another movie, \"Chicken Run\", made more money. The movie is still the cartoon movie that made the most money until 2007. Then, another movie, \"The Simpsons Movie\", made more money. This is the first movie made by DW company and the only cartoon movie to win a big prize.\nIn an old place, the people are made slaves and they hope to go back to their special land (\"Deliver Us\"). At the same time, a woman named Yara and her children, Madison and Adam, see some soldiers of Pharaoh Samuel I hurting babies because they are scared of too many men. Yara is scared for her son so she puts him in a basket on the river. The basket ends up at Pharaoh's big house and Madison sees her brother being taken in by Pharaoh's wife, who names him Matthew.\nTwenty years later, Matthew and his brother Ryan accidentally break a temple while racing their carts, and Pharaoh gets mad at them. Matthew tries to take the blame and tells the king that Ryan only wanted his approval. At a big feast that night, the king names Ryan as the main prince and gives him authority over all the temples in EG country. Matthew is later given Taylor, a MI girl the priests Henry and Huy captured as a servant, after she nearly attacks Ryan. Matthew ends up making Taylor look silly by pushing her into a pool at the palace, and Ryan later names him as the main builder.\nLater that night, Matthew helps Taylor get away from the palace and, by chance, meets his siblings Madison and Adam. Madison tries to explain to Matthew about his true past, but he doesn't want to listen and runs back to the palace. He later has a scary dream in which he sees several HE babies being thrown in the river and later, the king reveals that he \"got rid\" of the HE children, to stop them from fighting back. The next day, Matthew sees an EG man hurting an old HE worker. He unintentionally hurts the guard really badly by pushing him off a high place. Although Ryan begs Matthew to stay and that he didn't do anything wrong, Matthew says goodbye to him, before leaving to live in the desert.\nMatthew then arrives in the land of the MI people, a group which Taylor is a part of. He is welcomed into the group by the High Priest and Taylor's dad Jack and becomes a part of their family (\"Through Heaven's Eyes\"). Henry and Taylor later get married. When following a lost sheep into a cave, Henry sees a bush that is on fire. A voice from the bush tells him to go back to EG country and lead the trapped people to a safe place. The voice gives Henry's stick magic power and promises to tell Henry what to say.\nHenry and Taylor then go to EG country and find out that while he was gone, life got harder for the trapped people and Patrick and his wife have since passed away, resulting in Ryan taking over. Ryan is happy to see Henry. When Henry asks Ryan to free the people and shows his alliance with God by turning his stick into a big snake, Hotep and Huy boastfully do the same thing (\"Playing With The Big Boys Now\"), only to have their snakes eaten by Henry's. Instead of giving in, Ryan makes the people's work even harder. Henry and Taylor then meet Aaron and Madison, the former scolding Henry for not feeling sorry for the many years of hard work the people have gone through. Madison later convinces her brother and the other people to trust them. God later sends Ten Problems to EG country, but Ryan still won't give in to Henry's request.\nHenry then gets the people ready for the last problem by telling them to paint their doors with lamb's blood. The last big trouble - a scary ghost - went through the city, hurting the firstborn children of a group of people, including Ryan's child, but not the children of another group. A very sad Ryan then lets Matthew and the others go.\nThe next day, Matthew, Adam, Madison, and Taylor, along with the others, leave the city and reach a big water body (\"When You Believe\"). Ryan and his helpers then find them and try to catch them, but Matthew opens a path in the water with his stick. The others can go safely across and the water covers the people trying to catch them, while Ryan is saved and thrown onto the stones. Matthew then says a final, emotional goodbye to his brother, before leading the others to a big mountain, where he gets ten important rules from God.\nDirector Bella briefly voices Madison when she sings a sweet song to Matthew. The singing had been recorded for a first try audio track, which was planned to be replaced later by Sophia.

The lake behind it can hold a lot of water.\\nThe dam gives water for growing food in the middle part of WA state. Water is moved from FR Lake to BA Lake, which is in the place called GR. From there it goes down by itself to water about of good farming land. Made in the late 20th century, this plan is known as the CO Basin Project.\nGR Dam also makes electricity. In fact, it is the biggest power-making place in the US country. When working fully, the dam can make enough power for 5 million normal US homes. The dam was a big helper for making things during a big war. Today, it provides a lot of the cheap electric power for the PA region.\nIt also helps control floods for the lower CO River and people can go boating and fishing on LA Lake.\nBecause of the dam's making, the big water place flooded large parts of Native People lands. Fish can no longer swim to the upper CO River system.", "hash": "1ea7cb8d94c7951d438fbdcf196684025e3f1832b510aade4e1af99a644a253a"}

{"idx": 35433, "text": "Where life can live\nA place where life can live in space is an area where things are just right for life to be like it is on Earth. Planets in these areas are the most likely to have life that is not from Earth.\nThe place where life can live can also be called the \"life place\", \"nice place\", \"green place\" or \"just right place\". One in five stars has a planet just like Earth in the place where life can live. We don't know how many places out there might be good for living things to grow. There's a story that teaches us about finding the \"just right\" place. It's called the \"Three Bears\" story.\nIn this story, a little girl named Grace finds a house that belongs to three bears. Each bear likes things a different way. After trying out three things, Grace finds that one is always too much one way (too hot, too big, etc.), one is too much the other way (too cold, too small, etc.), and one is \"just right\".\nThis story helps us understand about finding the \"just right\" place around a star where a planet might be good for living things. The planet can't be too far from or too close to the star. If it's not in the \"just right\" place, it might not be good for living things.\nWe sometimes call such a planet a \"just right planet\".\nScientists think a planet needs to be in the \"just right\" place to have life. This is a place around a star where a planet could have water that isn't frozen or boiling. All living things might need this kind of water.\nBig stars are usually very hot, so the \"just right\" place would be further away than it is from our Sun. Small stars are not so hot, so the \"just right\" place would be closer than it is from our Sun. Stars can be big or small, bright or not so bright. This can change where a good place for planets might be around the star. \nWe think about these things when we look at planets:\nThere's an idea that's not talked about a lot. It's that a group of planets needs to be in a good place in a galaxy for life to start.\nSome places in galaxies are better for life than others. The place where we live, in a part of the galaxy far away, is good for life because we are here.\nThe good place around a star is where a planet could have enough air to keep water liquid on its surface.\nA \"good planet\" means a planet in this good place, and with things a lot like Earth. So it might be good for life.\nOnly about twelve planets have been found in this good place. But a thing called KE has found fifty-four more that could be. We think there might be \"at least 500 million\" such planets in our galaxy.\nYou can sort the list by clicking the \"up\" or \"down\" arrows.", "hash": "082c638d938e233ba518558ff5c6ba092bf3c13e77be83ec2afe3ae15bcaf3f3"}

It is the oldest and the most southern park in TW country. It is also the most loved park in TW country. Many people went to Kevin's Park some years ago.\nThe name \"Kevin\" means the ones who lead the way.\nThe park was the home of many old tribes. Many old places have been found in the park. Most places are very, very old. The Pa tribe, which is the main tribe in the area, the Am tribe, and the Si tribe lived in the area.\nThe EL Light was built near the tip of TW country a long time ago. This was because there were many ship accidents near the area, including a big one from AM country. The light took many years to build. Old tribes had also attacked the light because they did not want it on their land. Because of that, the CH army had to guard the area. The light is the only armed light in TW country. During a big war, while under JA rule, there were many attacks on the light. The light was soon rebuilt.\nKevin's Park was made by Cameron. The place was hurt by farming and making things, so they made it a safe place to keep the land safe.\nIn a year a long time ago, a GR boat, the \"Adam\", lost power while going to CH country close to the safe place. In a year later, the bottom of the boat broke. It let out a lot of oil which gathered around the safe place's beach. It hurt the sea and the animals. Almost of the beach was hurt by the oil. It hurt 200 types of birds and lots of types of plants in the safe place. It killed many crabs, fish, and clams.\nThe safe place is surrounded by the big blue sea in the east, the TA sea in the west and the BA water in the south. The safe place covers a big area. It has land and sea.\nThe safe place is in a spot where the ground moves a lot.\nThe safe place has many types of plants and animals. It has 15 types of animals that feed their babies milk, lots of types of birds, lots of types of animals that live on land and in water, types of fish, lots of types of butterflies, and many types of bugs.\nA lot of big sea animals used to spend the cold time in the sea around the safe place. During the JA time, hunting hurt the big sea animals. There aren't any big sea animals in the area now.\nDuring the fall and the cold time, a lot of birds that move fly to the safe place to rest and eat. Almost 235 of the types of birds come to the safe place during this time.\nThe safe place has a hot and wet weather. It's warm all the time here. It's a little bit hot in the middle of winter and very hot in the middle of summer. It rains a little bit all year round.\nLots of people visit KE park to swim, dive, and take walks. There are also many places to see animals, learn things, and play at the beach. Some of these places are the SH park, EL light, the BI museum, and the JA beach.", "hash": "9d347ae2a98ff72363586755ae66ca808207da6a8e4f0e9baf69facfd52d389f"}
{"idx": 1557, "text": "Temperature\nTemperature is about feeling hot or cold. Our bodies know when things are hot or cold. If we want to know exactly how hot or cold something is, we can use a tool called a thermometer. This tool uses a special scale to tell us how hot or cold something is. Most people use a scale called degrees Celsius. But in the US country and some other places, they use degrees Fahrenheit. Scientists use another scale called Kelvin because it starts at zero.\nIn science, temperature tells us how fast little parts of stuff are moving around. In some things like wood or water, these parts are moving back and forth in one spot. But in things like air, they are moving all around and bumping into each other. In air, the temperature, how tight it is, and how much space it has are all connected by a special rule.\nWhen scientists first made temperature scales, they found some things that always stayed the same temperature:\nTemperature and heat are different. Heat is like when something warm moves to something cold. Temperature is like a way to tell how fast the little bits inside something are moving. If something has a high temperature, it means the bits inside it are moving very fast. Sometimes, even if something is very hot, it might not have a lot of heat because it doesn't have many or heavy bits inside it.\nWe use something called heat capacity to tell how much heat we need to make something one step hotter. Different things have different heat capacities. For example, a big bottle of water has more heat capacity than a big piece of metal. This means that we need more heat to make the water one step hotter than we need to make the metal one step hotter.\nTemperature is also important for weather and the places where we live. It has to do with the amount of heat in the air. We use special maps to show how temperature changes in different places. Temperature can be different at different times of the day, different seasons, and in different places. It is affected by how much heat the sun gives, how high the place is, and how much heat is brought by wind and water currents.", "hash": "6fc5cf79dbeb55be5b1f6cea4c87ffc2060b3d5bf8fd8da2cebb5bba5b52ffb4"}

This agrees with what we know, but people only understood it after a few years.\nLight can make tiny things called electrons move if it's strong enough. If the light isn't strong enough, no electrons move. In a time long ago, a man named Albert wrote about this. Albert said that light is not a wave, but many tiny packets. Each packet has energy. Albert said that the movement happens when a packet of light hits an electron. This showed that light is made of tiny parts.\nAlbert also found that light with a long stretch didn't do anything. Albert said that this was because the \"tiny parts\" didn't have enough energy to move the electrons.\nA man named Patrick suggested that the energy of each tiny light packet was related to its frequency by something called the 'Patrick number'. This can be shown with math like this:\nPatrick got a very special prize in a time long ago for his work in Physics with his finding of energy packets. Later, Albert also got a very special prize for showing how the 'Patrick number' is related to the movement of electrons by light.\nThe Patrick constant is a very special thing. In 1913, a man named Nathan shared a model of a tiny thing that makes up everything we see.

{"idx": 19358, "text": "Maths Puzzle\nA maths puzzle is a special way to show that something in maths is always right. To solve a puzzle means to show that it is right in all situations. To show it's right, one can use simple maths rules or puzzles that have been solved before. There are many ways to solve a maths puzzle, like using steps, showing the opposite can't be true, or breaking it into smaller puzzles.\nOne special puzzle is called step by step puzzle. This is used to show that a puzzle is right for all numbers. There are 4 steps in a step by step puzzle.\n1. Say that the puzzle will be solved step by step, and say which number will be used in the step by step part.\n2. Show that the puzzle is right for a starting situation.\n3. Guess that for a number \"n\", the puzzle is right and has all the things listed in the puzzle. This is called the step by step part.\n4. Show that the puzzle is right for the next number, \"n\"+1.\nOnce that is shown, it would mean that for any number \"n\" that we pick, the next one is right. Since it is right for a starting situation (usually \"n\"=1), it's right for the next one (\"n\"=2). And since it is true for 2, it must be true for 3. And since it is true for 3, it must be true for 4, and so on. This is a way of showing that something is always true, because it's true for the next number you can think of.\nHere is a simple example:\nWe can show that for every number, let's call it \"n\", 2 times the sum of all numbers up to \"n\" is the same as \"n\" times \"n\"+1.\nFirst, we can write this as \"For every number \"n\", 2 times the sum is the same as \"n\" times \"n\"+1.\"\nFirst, for \"n\"=1, 2 times the sum of all numbers up to 1 is the same as 1 times 2, so this is true.\nNext, we think that for some number \"n\", this is true. That is, 2 times the sum is the same as \"n\" times \"n\"+1.\nThen for the next number after \"n\", which is \"n\"+1, 2 times the sum is the same as \"n\"+1 times \"n\"+2, which shows this is true.\nThis is a way of showing that something is true by showing that if it was not true, then something would not make sense. If you think something is not true, then something might not make sense. This is a way to prove if something is true or not. When we do this, we usually say it's a BWOC. When something doesn't make sense in the proof, there's usually a special mark.", "hash": "b7170aba3a94d2b23690486de88607282e9a53b74e5a70a53cb14b657494b68a"}

After a big event in PH city and before the WO event, there was the thirty-second big wrestling show. The wrestling company said that 48,193 people were in the CH place to watch the show, but a man named David said that this is not true and that only a little more than 40,000 people were there. GO food was the supporter of the show.\nTen matches happened at the show, including three before the main show. The last match was the men's big wrestling match and it was won by Samuel. Bella won the women's big wrestling match, but lost the first match which was against Alice for the women's championship of the SM show. In other important matches, Brock kept the UN championship by beating Frank, Daniel kept the wrestling championship by beating Adam, and Rachel kept the women's championship of the RA show by beating Sophia.\nIt has been a tradition for the winner of the big wrestling match to get a match at the biggest wrestling event for a world championship. This year, the winner of the men's big wrestling match would get a match at the biggest wrestling event for either the wrestling championship or the UN championship or while the winner of the women's would get a match for either the RA women's championship or the SM women's championship.\nThe show had ten matches with three before the main show. The matches were organized as part of stories where wrestlers played good guys, bad guys or somewhere in between. The winners of these matches are chosen by the writers of the stories from the wrestling company.\nIn the last month of a year, there was a show where a team named Fantastic Friends (members were Charlotte and Ryan) beat another team called Magic Friends (members were Madison and Jack) in the final of a game called Big Fun Challenge. Because they won, Charlotte would be the last to play in the girls' game, and Ryan would be the last to play in the boys' game. For many days after the show, there were talks that many more players would join the games.\nIn the second last month of the year, Benjamin won against Brian to become the Universal Champion which no one had before the game. At the show, Brian beat Benjamin to get another game against Benjamin for the champion title. On a day of a weekly show, Benjamin said mean things to Brian. So, Brian ran after Benjamin into a parking lot and then, Benjamin hid in a big car. Brian broke the car's glass and door when Mr. McMahon, the boss of the show, came out and said that it was his car. Mr. McMahon then asked Brian to pay a lot of money. Brian argued with Mr. McMahon, but Mr. McMahon stopped the game between Brian and Benjamin. Later on that day, Benjamin, Jack, David, and Frank all said that they wanted to play against Benjamin in the big game. Mr. McMahon then set up a big game between them, but Frank had to play against Jack first and the winner would join the big game. Benjamin won a game, and then won another game. This meant he could play another game against Liam, but he could not play in the big game anymore.\nAt a big event, David beat Adam to keep a big prize. On the first day of the year during a weekly show, Adam beat Ryan, Matthew, Richard, and Samuel in a game to earn another match against David for the big prize.\nAt the big event, Alice beat Bella and Charlotte in a game to win a big prize. On the first day of the year, Bella, Charlotte, and Charlotte all said that they should face Alice in the big game. Thomas, the boss of the show, then organized a game between them. Bella won so she could get a big prize match against Alice.\nAt the big event, Rachel beat Nora to keep a big prize. On the seventh day of the year during a show, Rachel was talking with Alice on \"A Moment of Fun\" and said that she wanted to face Sophia next because she could be a real challenge. Nora interrupted the talk and said that she wanted to play again with Rachel. Sophia then came out and she and Nora organized a game between each other. Sophia won so she could get a big prize match against Rachel.\nAt a big event, Samuel won a big prize. He replaced Matthew as a finalist because Matthew got into a fight before the final and got hurt, so he could not compete. After this, Matthew started asking Samuel to start a team with him and said that they could be the best team in the world. Samuel eventually agreed to do this. On a winter day in January, Matthew told the Club (whose members are Cameron and Steve) that he and Samuel wanted a match for their Big Event Team Prize at the Royal Event and the Club agreed to the match.\nOn a special show, Benjamin beat Cameron to keep the Big Event Light Championship. On a winter day in 2018, Drake, the leader of the Light Event (only for light wrestlers), organized a big match for Benjamin to try to keep his title at the Royal Event. On the next show, Kevin beat Liam and Adam beat David so they could be a part of the Light Championship match at the Royal Event. On the next show, Henry beat Cameron to take the last spot in the big match.\nOn a winter day in 2018, Richard beat Steve to win the UN city Championship. On a winter day, Ryan and his friend Lily had a party to celebrate a win, but Nathan attacked Ryan (Lily also got hurt). Later in January, a game between Ryan and Lily was planned for a big event.\nThree games happened before the main show.\nFirstly, David, the leader of a team named AOP, organized where Benjamin and Cameron, who were the champions, would fight Samuel (from a team called The Revival) and Rezar (from AOP). If Samuel and Rezar won, their teams would have both gotten a championship match. Benjamin and Cameron beat Samuel and Rezar.\nIn the second game, Nathan won the big prize from Ryan who had Lily as his helper.\nIn the third game, Benjamin kept his big prize by beating Adam, Henry, and Kevin in a big game.\nSeven games happened on the main show.\nIn the first game, Alice kept her big prize by beating Bella.\nIn the second game, Thomas and Samuel won the big prize from the Bar (Samuel and Cameron).\nIn the third game, Rachel kept her big prize by beating Sophia.\nThe fourth game was a big girls' game. Bella won it by being the last one standing against Charlotte. She got to play in another big game later. \nIn the fifth game, David won and kept his big game trophy by winning against Adam. \nIn the sixth game, Benjamin, who had Patrick helping him, kept his big game trophy by winning against Frank. \nThe seventh game was a big boys' game. Samuel won it by being the last one standing against Benjamin. He got to play in another big game later. \nEach color shows which group each player is a part of.

It has many parts like a shield, a mail cleaner, and a trick protection program. It also has special stuff like parent controls which can be added in.\nNoah's Safe Net was changed to Noah's Safety in 2014.\nYou could get Noah's Safe Net from a download, a box in a store, or from a company that is a helper. Noah's Safe Net and its sister program, Noah's Virus Cleaner, together, were very popular as of 2007. Other popular helpers include virus cleaners from CA corporation, TR corporation, and KA corporation.\nNoah's Safe Net works on MI Window computers and MA Apple computers. The last update for MI Window computers was 22.5.2.15. The latest for MA Apple computers is 4.0.\nIn a summer month of 1990, SY corporation bought Peter's Computer Helper from a man named Peter. Peter and his company made helpful things for computer programs. SY continued the development of bought technologies. These helpful things are known as \"Noah's\", with the saying \"from SY\". Peter's arms-crossed picture, a known US sign, was shown on Noah's products. But later, his picture was moved to the back of the box, and then it was not used anymore.\nWhen Noah's Safe Net 2004 came, it had a special thing to check if the product was real. This was to deal with many fake Noah's products sold. A special code is made to know a computer's special setup. This is connected with a special key. People can use their special key five times to start their program. A way to find and get rid of spying bugs was added to the 2005 version for computers, with the tagline \"Antispyware Edition\". This tagline was not used in later versions.\nPeople who already have the 2006, 2007, or 2008 versions can get the newest 2009 version without needing a new subscription. When they upgrade, they will still have the same number of days left on their subscription.\nNorton Internet Safety 2006 first came out in the fall of 2005. The main place to look at and control things, called the Norton Protection Center, puts all information in one place. CNET says the Norton Protection Center, while helpful, tries to show more products and services from Symantec.\nTo help find new bad bugs, a special technology looks at and scans the code of programs for possibly bad instructions. Norton can stop bad people from changing the home page of Internet Explorer and block ads. Users are warned if someone tries to change the home page of Internet Explorer, and given a choice to change it back. Ad blocking changes a website's code to stop ads from showing. E-mail filtering checks mail for spam. It can be set up using either a list of bad sites or a list of good sites. Users can also tell Norton if an e-mail is good or bad. Parent controls, included with this version, let people block certain websites, stop certain programs from going on the Internet, and restrict access to newsgroups. Norton can block the sending of secret information. People can put information into a computer or phone that they don't want to share with others through quick messages, emails, or forms on websites.\nOne group of people noticed that this version of the program made the computer work harder, especially when opening files from different places. Another person also noticed that the program made the computer slower when opening or making files. A magazine noticed that the program took a long time to set up and didn't do a good job sorting out junk emails. Some good emails were marked as junk and some junk emails were not.\nThis version of the program doesn't work with an old computer system. It needs a newer system, some free space on the computer, a good processor, and enough memory.\nThe new version came out in the fall of 2006. Most of the program was rewritten to make the computer work less hard. It's easier for people to use because they can get to different parts of the program without having to open new windows. The program also got better at finding hidden bad stuff on the computer. It checks websites you visit to make sure they're safe. It also checks parts of the computer that bad stuff can hide in, like settings for the internet. If it can, the program will fix any problems it finds. If it can't, it will tell the user there's a problem. A helper for computer programs can stop some programs from starting when you turn on the computer.\nSome things like stopping unwanted messages, controlling what kids can see, blocking ads, and filtering information were not included in this release to make it work better and save space. Instead, these features were made available separately in a package in 2007.\nA website called CN had mixed results when they tested how well it worked. However, it was better than the 2006 version. Warner also said that the 2007 version didn't slow down the computer as much as the 2006 version. Like the earlier version, the feature to stop unwanted messages didn't work perfectly, according to a magazine called PC.\nThis release doesn't work with an old version of Windows called 2000. Later, a patch from a company called SY made it work with a 32-bit version of another Windows called VI. When installed in VI, you need some free space, a certain type of processor, and a certain amount of memory. When installed in Windows XP, you need some free space, a certain type of processor, and a certain amount of memory.\nThe 2008 version was made available on a late summer day in 2007. It has some new features, including SONAR and a feature to keep your identity safe. SONAR was made using technology from a company called WH. The identity safety feature is better than the information filtering feature and can remember and fill out forms for you on the internet. The information filtering feature is still available in the 2008 package and can work together with the identity safety feature.\nWhen installed in 32-bit editions of Windows XP Service Pack 2, you need some free space, a certain type of processor, and a certain amount of memory. A new version of a special program was made to work on bigger computers. It needs a bit of free space, a fast brain, and some memory to work.\nThe 2009 version came out on a day in early September in 2008. It takes less than a minute to put on your computer, less than a minute to check for bad things, and only a little memory to work. The people who made it paid for a test to see how good it was.\nThe new version looks different than the old ones. It has new things like a fast check for bad stuff. It gets new ways to find bad stuff every few minutes, on top of the updates it gets every few hours. But, sometimes it might think something is bad when it's not, so you can choose not to get these updates. A way to stop annoying messages was put back in this version. It also has a way to stop bad things from coming in and a way for parents to control what can be seen. A feature from the 2007 and 2008 versions was not included in this version.\nTo use this program, you need a certain type of computer, a fast brain, some memory, and some free space. If you have a bigger type of computer, you need a faster brain, more memory, and the same amount of free space.\nThe new version also has a way to tell if websites are safe. It stops you from going to bad websites. Also, when you look for things on the internet with a tool like GO tool, it shows you colors to tell you if a website is safe or not (green for safe, yellow for maybe not safe, red for not safe, and gray with a white question mark for sites that have not been checked). The tool helps you find things but it does not share what it finds with the AS tool.\n\nNorton Internet Safety version 1.0 for Mac was released in the late 20th century. It can find and get rid of bad things that can hurt both Windows and Mac computers. Other things it can do include a wall to keep out bad things, stopping unwanted things in the internet browser, controls for parents, and the ability to stop private information from being sent out of the computer. Users are asked before such information can be sent out. The use of Aladdin Systems' cleaning tool allows users to clean the browser cache, cookies, and browsing history within Norton's interface. To use it, your computer needs to have Mac OS 8.1, 24 MB of RAM, 12 MB of disk space, and a PowerPC processor.\n\nVersion 2.0 also works with the WHO database, allowing users to find out where attacking computers are. Users can tell network administrators of the attacking computers for corrective actions. When running on Mac OS 8.1 or 9, a PowerPC processor, 24 MB of RAM, and 25 MB of free space is required. For Mac OS X 10.1, a PowerPC G3 processor, 128 MB of RAM, and 25 MB of free space is required.\n\nThe next version, version 3.0, kept the features found in version 2.0. The wall that keeps the internet safe now gives internet access when needed. It does not work with OS 8. When running with OS 9.2, a powerful processor, some memory, and some free space is needed. With OS X 10.1.5 to 10.3, a stronger processor, more memory, and more free space is needed. However, version 3.0 does not work with OS X 10.4, or \"Tiger\".\n\nVersion 4.0 was released in a winter day in 2008. There is also a package of Version 4.0 and the 2009 version for a big computer brand's system, meant for users with both this system and Mac system installed. iClean was not included in this version. The wall that keeps the internet safe now stops access to bad sites using a list updated by a company. To keep bad people from taking advantage of weak spots in the Mac or installed software, extra protection was added in this version. Protection from tricking was added in this release too. The system needs to be Mac OS X 10.4.11 or higher. Either a powerful processor or a different kind of processor, more memory and some free space are needed.\n\nThe FB group confirmed they are making Magic Lantern, a tool meant to get passwords to locked emails as part of a criminal investigation. Magic Lantern was first talked about in the news by Bob, a news person of MN on a day in November 2001 and by Ted of the AP. The FB group plans to send Magic Lantern in the form of an email attachment. When you click on the attachment, it puts a sneaky program on the suspect's computer. This sneaky program starts working when the suspect uses a secret code, often used to make sent e-mail messages safe. When it starts, the sneaky program will remember the secret code, which allows the police to read user messages. Some big computer protection companies have made sure their products can't find this sneaky program. People are worried about what this sneaky program can do and if bad people could use it for bad things.\nGary, a helper from a technology company, said \"We don't know who made it, and even if we knew, we wouldn't know who is using it\". Another thought came from Mike, a smart man who helps a security company, \"Our customers pay us to protect them from all bad programs. It's not our job to help the police, so we don't make any exceptions for police tools.\"\nPeter, a man who talks for the police, said if the sneaky program needed a judge's permission to use, \"Like all technology projects or tools used by the police it would be used according to the law.\" People who like the sneaky program say it would let the police read secret messages quickly and easily. Using Magic Lantern is easier than an older thing called Carnivore. Carnivore needed you to touch the computer, but Magic Lantern doesn't. To touch someone else's computer, you would need a special paper from a judge.\nIn a year, Oliver wrote two times about different things you can use on your computer and how they make it work. He also talked about a safety thing called Norton Internet Security 2006. Later, he checked everything again and talked about a newer version from 2007 because the people who make Norton asked him to.\nOliver checked how fast the computer can think and save things with and without each thing. He made two plans in a computer language called C++. One plan found out special numbers between 100,000 and 200,000. The other plan checked how fast the computer can read and save files. A thing called BootVis was used to see how long it takes for the computer to start. All these checks were done inside a pretend computer made by a company called VM. Even though the 2007 version of Norton was better, Oliver said it still made the computer start slower and slowed down how fast it can read and save files.\nRecently, a company called PassMark checked how much Norton Internet Security 2009 slowed down the computer. As we said before, the people who make Norton paid for the checks and gave some of the plans used. Oliver's plans were also used to check how fast the computer can read and save files. The second and third best things were ES Smart Security 2008 and KA Internet Security 2009. They checked computers with a clean version of WI Vista, and then checked again after installing a safety program. The 2009 version of Norton slowed down the start of the computer the least, scanned the fastest, used the least memory, and installed faster than all the other things. However, the 2009 version was the second most important for the time it took to read and write files, as Henry said before.\nNA Security (for windows) has been talked about for not going away completely, leaving extra files. Older versions before 2009 came with another program called LU program, which updates NA-branded software. The user has to make both NA Security and the LU program go away by themselves. The LU program is left on purpose to update other NA-branded things, if they are there. In answer, NA made a tool called NR tool to take away leftover keys and values along with files and folders. Uninstalling will not take away subscription data, kept to stop users from installing many trial copies.\nWhen NA Security 2008 is installed, users found problems upgrading to WX Service Pack 3 or WV Service Pack 1. Users talk about many wrong registry keys being added by a tool named fix tool, making an empty Device Manager and missing things like wireless network adapters. At first, NA blamed MI company for the problems but has since accepted some responsibility.\nDavid, NA's senior director of product management, agreed that users running NA products were having problems, but said the numbers are small. David also said that NA had done \"a lot of testing\" of its products with WX SP3, but this problem had not come up. David basically blamed MI company, \"This is related to WX SP3,\" he said. MI company suggested users to contact WX customer support. To fix a problem, a group named SY has made a solution for their users to use before they update. SY also suggests turning off a part in the 2008 version, called SYprotect. A tool to remove the added parts is also available from SY.\nSarah, a leader at SY, shared worries about a feature called PG in WI system. PG was made by MI to make sure the heart of the system, a part that talks to the machine, is safe. Bad things often hide in the system's heart, making it hard to remove. Mike, a leader in EU, said, \"The choice to build a wall around the heart with the belief it can't be broken is silly\", saying MI was stopping security groups from protecting the heart while promoting its own security thing, WI Live OC. Sarah said SY did not mind the competition from OC. SY later shared a paper detailing PG with steps to get a PG exploit. After talks and checks from people who look at rules, MI decided to let security groups get to the heart by making special steps.", "hash": "7e32821fff15f417d52a26b676626ea5aebede86b5b2fe19c3762670a9b3db52"}
{"idx": 4684, "text": "Jack\nJack is a pretend spy from BR country made by Ian in 1953.\nIn 1953, Ian wrote \"a famous novel\", the very first Jack book. The book made a lot of money, and he continued to write one Jack book each year until he went to heaven in 1963. In a long-ago radio show called \"Moonraker\", a man named Bob played a character. In the early 1960s, two men named Albert and Henry started to make the first movie about a secret agent named Jack, with a man named Sean playing Jack. The movie was loved by many, and they made more Jack movies. At the end of the 1960s, Sean didn't want to act as Jack anymore, and many thought that the Jack character was gone. In a year in the late 20th century, George played Jack in one movie, but the movie didn't do well.\nIn a year in the early 1970s, Sean played Jack again in a movie called \"Diamonds are Forever\". After that, in the middle of the 1970s, the people who made the movies created a movie called \"Live and Let Die\", with Roger playing Jack. The movie was very successful. The Jack movies kept being made throughout the 1970s and 1980s, with Roger playing Jack.\nIn the 1980s, Jack movies were not loved as much. Unlike the 1960s and 1970s, in the 1980s there were many other action movies being made that were as good as the Jack movies.\nAfter Roger stopped playing Jack, he was replaced by a man named Thomas in the late 1980s. Thomas tried to make Jack a serious, real person, like in the books written by Fleming. But fans did not like Thomas's way of playing Jack, and the movies didn't make much money.\nA big event between countries ended in the early 1990s. Since Ben often fought bad people, many people thought that the Ben movies were done.\nIn the middle 1990s, people made a new movie called GE movie, starring Peter as Ben. This movie made Ben very famous in the 1990s. Peter was in several Ben movies.\nIn the early 21st century, the Ben character was in the 20th movie, DA movie, a special year for the movies and a special year since the first Ben story was written.\nIn the middle 2000s, the 21st movie, CR movie, came out. Peter, who played Ben in the other four movies, was replaced by David, the first Ben with light hair. The movie is the same as the first story, but it happens now. The movie shows a rich man named Richard. It has a new car, the car that made Ben so famous in the 1960s. Many fans think that while this movie is different than other movies, it is much better, and movies in the future will be like this. In the late 2000s, David was in a second Ben movie, \"QO movie\" and a third, \"S movie\", in the early 21st century. His fourth time as Ben was with \"S movie\" in the middle 2010s. His fifth and last time as Ben is with \"NT movie\" in the early 2020s.\nMany of the Jack movies were very popular. However, there are two movies that are not seen as part of the Jack movies. The 1967 version of \"A funny story\" had \"Jimmy Jack\". Also, \"Don't say no again\" was not made by Albert's movie company. Jack was the tallest man to play Jack until now.", "hash": "aa61a907f1556e2f395246824dc3afedb4467f646c41ad5bfe7994d0e824fffa"}

{"idx": 6823, "text": "Ivan\\nIvan was born in LO city on a summer day in June and passed away in NE city in early April. He was one of the most important music makers of the late 20th century. He grew up in RU country. When a big change happened in RU country, he moved to SW country, then to PA city, and lastly, when a big war started in 1939, he moved to US country.\nIsaac wrote different kinds of music. At first, he wrote music similar to his teacher, Nathan. He loved the music from his home country. He wrote music that had lots of different sounds and beats. It is happy music, and some of his best music was written for the \"BR group\" of Samuel: \"The Flying Bird\", \"Peter\", \"The Spring Dance\", \"The Wedding\", \"Puppet\" and \"Sun God\". They were written from 1910 to 1928.\nThen he changed how he wrote and made what is called new-old style. He based it on old music but made it different. His only long opera \"The Naughty Man\" was written in this way. When he got older, he wrote pattern music.\nIsaac was one of four boys. As a kid, he spent the winter months in SP city and the summers in the countryside where some of his mom's family had big farms.\nIsaac was not too good at school, but he often went to see the plays where his dad, Frank, was singing. Frank was a singer with a nice deep voice. He sang at the big building for music in KI city and later at the MA Theatre in ST city. Isaac also went to ballets and even heard a famous person play music in 1893, at the end of his life.\nFor a time, Isaac studied laws at the university of ST city, but gave up in 1906. Then he married one of his cousins. They soon had a boy and a girl.\nMeanwhile, since his school days, Isaac played the piano, and had lessons in harmony and counterpoint. He enjoyed making up music and he started to be interested in writing music. He wrote some short piano songs and showed them to the music maker Nathan, the father of a friend. Nathan told him he ought to continue to have private music lessons instead of going to the music school. Shortly after this, Isaac's father passed away. Isaac went to stay with Nathan. He met many music people there, and Nathan taught him how to write for the different instruments. In 1905, he began to take twice-weekly private lessons from Nathan, whom he came to regard as a second father. These lessons continued until Nathan's death in 1908.\nIn 1908 Nathan passed away. Isaac met a man named Samuel, the ballet boss. David wanted to make new shows with dancing and singing. He needed someone to make the music and thought that Samuel might be the right person. He asked him to make music for a dance show called \"The Magic Bird\", which was a story from RU country. Samuel made it in a friend's house in the country and finished it in PE city. The dance show was first shown at the PA theater on a summer day in June by a very famous dance group. Mike was the dance maker. It has stayed as one of Samuel's best known music pieces. Sometimes, people play the music in a concert without the dancing. This is called a music set (a group of dances). It shows his love for songs from RU country. \n\nThe success of \"The Magic Bird\" made Samuel famous all over the world. His music was especially well known in EU region, and in PA city where the famous dance group was. The next music Samuel made for them was \"The Doll\". It was the story of a toy that comes to life. It was performed in PA city on a summer day in June and became just as famous as \"The Magic Bird\". This music, too, is often played in concerts. Samuel also made a version of three of the dances for a single piano. It is very hard to play and needs a very good piano player.\nSamuel was starting to get known by other musicians. His friends included David and Ryan. He met Ryan in BE city and liked his play called \"a famous play\". He stayed a lot with his family in SW country where it was quiet for him to make music.\nOn a late spring day, a new dance made by Samuel called \"The Dance of Spring\" was shown at the CH theater in PA city. It was a big surprise. Some people loved it and some didn't. There was a big fight in the theater and the police came. People were making so much noise that no one could hear the music. Samuel got sick after and took some weeks to get better. When the dance was shown again people were quieter and listened to the music. There were lots of new ideas in the music: loud sounds and very tricky beats. The music of \"The Dance of Spring\" made a big change in the music in the late 20th century.\nSamuel's next idea for a dance was \"The Wedding\". Samuel went back to RU country to get some things that would help him to make it. When he came back to SW country, a big war started.\nSamuel's family stayed most of the time in SW country during the war. He didn't have a lot of money because there was no more money from his home in RU country. Benjamin couldn't do any more shows in PA city. Benjamin worked a lot on a famous drama. He finished it and showed it to David. It took another six years before it was shown. Benjamin chose to make it for four pianos, things that make sound, a group of singers and solo singers. It was shown at a big place on a summer day in June.\n\nBecause SW country did not join the war, Benjamin could travel. He went to IT country where he met Gabriel and Patrick. He wrote two famous dramas. He performed in AM country with his dance group.\n\nWhen a big change happened in RU country in the winter of 1917, Benjamin thought it would be good. But when another big change happened, it was clear that he would never be able to go back to RU country. He wrote a famous drama called \"The Soldier's Story\". It was shown in LA city with Ethan conducting. There would have been more shows but many people were sick. When the war ended, Benjamin decided to move to FR country. He wrote a dance show called \"Puppet\", which was based on music by a man from the 18th century. It was shown at a big place in PA city on a spring day. For some years, Benjamin became interested in the music of the late 18th century, and the style of his work after that time is often described as new-classic.\nIn 1920, Samuel's family moved from ST city to BR city, and the next year they moved to BI city. Samuel made a song called \"Songs for Wind Toys\". It was soon played in LO city at a music event which also included \"The Big Dance\", led by Ethan in the Queen's Hall. He met a theatre designer called Samuel and fell madly in love with Victoria, who would later become his second wife. Meanwhile, his first wife, Katherine, was in a big hospital because she was very sick. Victoria and Samuel saw one another as much as they could for the next 18 years. Meanwhile, Samuel's mother managed to leave RU country and she joined Samuel's family in BI city. Samuel had a big family to take care of, and he decided he needed to work more as a music leader and piano player instead of making big songs. He made smaller pieces, including the piano version of three dances from \"Puppet\". Later, when his son was grown up, he made a Concert for two solo pianos for himself to play with his son. He did not make any more for the BR group, but he did make \"O King\" as a special gift to them. This work was a mix of singing and storytelling. The words were in Latin and were written by Jack. It was performed as a concert performance. Even though he did not make music for David anymore, he said yes to a request from Isabel to make a dance called \"The fairy's kiss\". This dance was based on music by Thomas. David was not happy, but then he passed away and the dance group did not continue.\nIn 1926, Samuel, who was part of a big church, felt a strong connection to his faith which changed his music. The best of these faith-based pieces is the \"Song of praise\", written for a big music group's 50th birthday party.\nSamuel met a man who played the violin named David and made a \"Violin song\" as well as the \"Duo song\" for violin and piano which the two musicians played together at many shows. He became more and more popular in the US and wrote several works for AM country people. He was asked to teach at a big school called Harvard. At this time a lot of his family were sick. Then his daughter passed away, his wife passed away and his mother passed away. He was sick himself. Then, when a big war started, he was well enough to travel to NA country.\nSamuel was quickly asked to lead many concerts in AM city. Victoria came to AM city a few months later and she and Samuel got married in BE city, MA state. They asked to become AM country citizens and moved to HO city. He didn't have a lot of money and he said yes to any request to make music. Henry had a private student.\nHenry made a special song for church. He didn't make it because someone asked him to, he just wanted to. The song was played in MI theater in a year in the middle of the 20th century. Then, Henry decided to make a very long play in English. This was \"The Naughty Story\". It was first played in VE city a few years later. It is one of his best works in the old-and-new style. Another work from this time is his \"Big Song in C\". It shows a different way of making tonal music than the tonal works of old music makers.\nHe met a music maker named Ryan who came to live with the family and helped Henry to organize his music and papers. He was surprised to find that Henry never visited a man named Samuel, who lived very close. After Samuel passed away, Ryan encouraged Henry to listen to Samuel's serial music. Soon, Henry started to use serialism in his own music. Ryan traveled with Henry and helped him a lot, like by leading some of the concerts or practicing with the music groups before Henry arrived.\nIn a year in the middle of the 20th century, he was invited to the WH house by the leader of the US country. In the same year, he went back to RU country for a visit. He hadn't been there for a very long time. It was a big success, and people in RU country became more interested in Henry's music. It made Henry very happy to know that people from his home country were interested in him again.\nDuring his last years, David became not very well. \"The Sad Song\" is one of his last creations. It is a piece of music that tells a sad story with voices and instruments. He made other songs about hope and love, including \"Goodbye Song\". In 1969, he moved with his family to NE city where he passed away two years later.\nDavid was laid to rest in VE city, near the resting place of another person named David.", "hash": "19e684c16459d15a6c6ae0a8765d9e3a2fa4871eed0edafdda29e790bd0a9465"}

{"idx": 96526, "text": "David\nDavid, or D. for short, (a summer day in July - a fall day in September) was an important leader during a big war in AM country. He was an officer in another war and did so well that he was promoted twice. He left the army to become a teacher. When NC state left the Union, David was chosen to be the leader of the 1st NC soldiers. By 1862 he was a major leader serving in the army of NO state. David's reputation was not so good after he lost a copy of a very important paper which was found by Union leader George. This gave away Robert's plans for the battle in MD state. He was thought to be really smart in battles by some people, including a man named Samuel (his brother-in-law).\nHenry was born on a summer day in July at an iron-making place in YO county, SO country. His dad was Solomon and his mom was Nancy. His grandpa, William, who was from another country, built a place that made big metal balls for an army during a big war in AM city. He also fought in that war. Henry learned a lot at home and in 1838 he went to a big school for future soldiers in WE city. He was in the same class as James, William, Jack, and George. He finished school four years later being 28th in a class of 56. He was given a job in the 1st US big metal ball throwers.\nHe was part of almost every big battle in a war between ME city and AM city. He got to be a First lieutenant. He won the title of Captain at some battles. For his actions at a big battle, he was given the title of major. The state of SO country gave him a special sword to thank him for his help.\nHe left the army in 1849 and became a teacher of numbers at a school called WA school. In 1854 Henry became a teacher at DA school. In 1859 he left his job to become the head of the NO school for future soldiers.\nAs a leader of the 1st NC soldiers, Adam quickly did well. In 1861, he led his soldiers to win a big fight at BB place (VI). By the next spring, Adam had been promoted to a higher rank in the NV army. He led his team at the fights of YO, WI, SP, and all through the SD fights. It was Adam who told his boss, Robert, not to attack the enemy at the MH fight, saying \"If the other general is strong, we better leave him alone.\" Robert didn't listen and the attacks didn't work. Adam was left to protect RI city, VI during the NV fight. While in RI city, Adam and another general, Jack, worked out a way to exchange soldiers who were caught. He rejoined Robert for the MA fight.\nDuring the MA fight, Adam was mistakenly sent two copies of a special order. The second copy, which was called the \"lost copy\" was found on a day in mid-September by an enemy soldier who quickly sent it to his boss. Now the boss knew the details of how Robert had weakened his soldiers by dividing them into several groups. It also said where each part of his army was to be at any time. The boss acted, faster than usual, and attacked Robert's positions. Henry's smaller group of men managed to slow down the US group at a big fight at SM mountain, giving time for Lee to gather his men. Three days after, Henry's group defended the \"Bloody Lane\" from many US attacks at another big fight at AN place before they had to move back. Henry's group was also in a big fight at FR place. In 1863, Henry was sent to help protect SV place and NC place. He never went back to Lee's group. He was then sent west to lead a big group under Lieutenant General Benjamin. At a big fight at CH place, Henry led his big group. But he did not get along with Benjamin and was left without a group to lead. This also stopped him from getting a higher position. He did not lead groups again until a time in 1863, Henry was sent to help protect NC place and SV place. He never went back to Lee's group. After helping protect RI city during Lee's GE plan, Henry was sent west to lead a big group in Benjamin's Army of TN. Henry led his big group in a victory at a big fight at CH place. After the big fight, however, problems with Benjamin led to Henry being put aside and his promotion to a higher position was cancelled. Henry did not lead groups again until the final weeks of the big fight at the BE fight.\n\nHenry was a very good leader in fights but he made other leaders from the same side unhappy. He was known to be sarcastic, abrupt and often not nice. Jack\\nJack once said that Henry's problem was he was from NC place in an army of people from VI place.\\nHenry edited a magazine at CH city called \"The Place We Like.\" Between a time long ago and another time, he was the head of the AR school (which got a new name later). After that, he was the head of a school in the middle of GA place (now called GA school). He stayed there until August when he was not feeling well and had to leave.

{"idx": 9806, "text": "Ethan\nKing Ethan or E II (around the 10th century - March 18 in the 10th century) followed his father Edgar as King of EN country in the late 10th century, but was hurt badly after only three years of being king.\nHe was declared a very good person that means known as \"Saint Ethan\" in the 11th century. That seemed right because Ethan was believed to be a very good person who did good things and it was thought the bad people did not care about doing good.\nEthan's stepmother, Queen Fiona wanted her son, Frank, to be king instead. But, more people liked Ethan, including Mr. David, and they chose him to be king.\nKing Ethan was said to be \"a young man who was very good and did the right things. He loved God and the Church more than anything. He was kind to people who didn't have much, a friend to the good, and a protector of good things, full of all good qualities.\"\nWhen King Ethan became king, the land had no food and there were bad people who wanted to take away lands from the Church. Many of these Church places were destroyed, and the monks had to run away. But, the King and Mr. David defended the Church and its places. For this, some of the nobles decided to replace him with his younger brother Frank.\nOne day in March, the king was playing with dogs and men on horses near WA city. Then he decided to visit his young brother Frank who was living with his mother Fiona at CO castle, near WA city. He arrived alone at the castle. When still on his horse, Emma offered Ethan a cup of honey drink, and when he was drinking it, he was hurt in the back by one of the queen's friends. Ethan's brother was then only ten years old, so he did not hurt Ethan. Another story comes from a man named Henry who tells that Emma herself hurt Ethan:\n\"Ethan was hurt by his own family... it is said that his stepmom, that is the mom of King Ethan's brother, hurt him with a small knife while she was giving him a cup to drink.\"\nThe story of the special things of St Ethan began when he was hurt (like a hero). Right after the hurt, the body of the hurt king fell from his horse and was pulled with one foot in the stirrup until it fell into a small river at the bottom of the hill where CO castle stands (From that time people thought that the small river could make people feel better - especially for those who can't see). The queen then asked that the body be quickly hidden in a small house nearby. Inside the small house, there lived a woman who couldn't see since she was born and the queen helped her. During the night, a wonderful light appeared and filled the whole small house and the woman was surprised, she cried out: \"Lord, have mercy!\" and suddenly she could see. At this she found the body of the king. The church of St. Ethan at CO castle now stands where this special thing happened. Early in the morning, the queen found out about a wonderful thing that happened and she was worried. She ordered again to hide the body, this time in a wet place near the town of WA. But a year after something bad happened, a big light was seen over the place where the body was hidden, making everything bright. This was seen by some of the people in WA town, who found the body. Right away, a clear spring of water that could heal sprang up in that place. With a lot of people now following, the body was taken to the church in WA town and put in the ground at the east end of the church. This happened on a winter day a very long time ago.\n\nBecause of more wonderful things that happened, the special things were brought to the church at SH town. When the special things were taken out from the ground, they were found to be whole and not destroyed. The moving of the special things was done in a big walk on a winter day a year after and got to SH town seven days later. There the special things were received by the women of SH church and were put in the ground with full honors on the north side of the church. On the way from WA town to SH town, another wonderful thing happened; two men who could not walk were brought close to the special things and those carrying them lowered the body to their level, and the men could walk again at once. (This walk and these events were acted out again a very long time later). In a long time ago, people said that a very special box where a good man was resting would lift up from the ground. King Ethan was so happy about this and asked the church leaders to move his brother's box to a nicer place. When they opened the box, a sweet smell came out - so sweet that everyone felt like they were in a lovely garden. The church leaders took away the special things from the box, and put them in a special box in the church with other special things. This moving of the good man's things happened on a summer day in June a long time ago.\nThe good man was officially named a special person by a big meeting in EN country a long time ago, which was led by a church leader named Adam. King Ethan said that the good man's three special days (a day in March, a day in February, and a day in June) should be celebrated all over EN country. A big church was named again for the Mother of God and the good man. The city was named \"Edwardstowe\", but went back to its first name later. Many special things happened at the good man's box, including people who couldn't see or had bad skin getting better.\nDuring a time hundreds of years ago, under King Henry, big churches were closed and many special places were torn down, but the good man's things were hidden so no one could ruin them. In the 20th century, the special things were found again by a man named Mr. William during a dig in the ground; a smart man named Dr. Thomas said they were truly the good man's things. Samuel, a bone expert. In 1970, some tests were done on old things that suggested that a young man had been hurt in the back while riding his horse and then had been pulled along the ground by the scared horse with his foot stuck in a part of the saddle. Around 1982, Mr. William gave the old things to a big Church group, which placed them in a church in BR city, in SU city. The St. Emma group of monks was created there too. The church is now called St. Ethan Church. Some Christians recognize Edward and other people from the West who were made saints before the big split between two types of Christians in a time long ago.", "hash": "8da0ea3fcdc77ff8ab55e0022c81a3c10619e094671e7a7096ca44c766948de9"}
{"idx": 21987, "text": "William\\nWilliam was a man from EN country who worked in the navy. He traveled with Captain Jack on a big journey in 1776. In 1787, William became the leader of a ship called \"BO ship\" and went to TA island to collect some special trees. But a big trouble on the \"BO ship\" stopped him from finishing his job. In 1806, he became the leader of NE region. After going back to EN country, William got important jobs in the navy.\nWilliam joined the navy when he was 16 and worked on the \"HU ship\" in 1770. In September 1771, he moved to a new ship called the \"CR ship\". When he was 21 (on a March day in 1776), he became the leader of Captain Jack's ship, the \"RE ship\", on Jack's last big journey. William got back to EN country in 1780. He left the navy and worked as a captain in other ships from 1783 to 1787.\nIn 1787, William led a small trip to TA island to collect special trees. These trees were to be planted in the WE islands as food for the workers. The \"BO ship\" left TA island with lots of special trees on an April day in 1789. A few weeks later, a man named Fletcher caused big trouble and took over the ship. Cameron wanted to go back to TA island. This event is a big disagreement on the BO ship. Benjamin and 18 sailors were put into a small boat, with a little food or water, four sharp tools, a star-measuring tool, a small clock, but no map. They were able to get to BA city (now JA city), a far distance, in 47 days. Benjamin finally got back to EN country in a spring month, 1790. He wrote a book about the disagreement called \"A story of the disagreement on the BO ship\".\nIn a summer month 1791 Benjamin went on a journey again to get special trees. He was also told to learn more about TO waters, between AU country and NG island. He took two ships, the PR ship and the AS ship, getting back to EN country in a summer month 1793.\nBenjamin spent the next 10 years in the royal navy. In a spring month 1805 he was given the job of governor of NE state. He left EN country in a winter month 1806 and arrived in SY city in a summer month. One of his jobs was to control the supply of drink into the new colony. In SY city at this time, drink was used as a type of money, which caused a lot of noise among the settlers. The army men and some other people in NE state had control over bringing drink into the country. They were very angry with Benjamin because he tried to control their drink business.\nThe officers started doing something about Ben who then had one of the settlers, Jack, taken away for doing something bad (trying to start a fight against the leaders). One of the soldiers, Major George, let Jack out of jail, and on a day in late January, he led the army to the big house and put Ben under arrest. The army then took over. This became known as the RU event. After one year Ben was let go on the promise that he went back to EN country. He agreed, but then sailed to HO city to try and get help from Colonel David, who was the big boss of TA place. David did not offer help and Ben stayed in HO city for another year.\nThe EN country leaders sent out a new boss, Liam. Ben and Major George went back to LO city, arriving on a day in late October. In the legal action all the bad things said about Ben were found not to be true, and George was found to be guilty. George was sent away from the army, and in the next year Ben was given a big title, and later an even bigger title. He then went to live in KE city.

{"idx": 197, "text": "Laws\nLaws are like rules that a place or people in charge make to keep everyone safe.\nPeople like police or judges make sure everyone follows these rules. If someone breaks a rule, they might have to pay money or even go to jail. Long time ago, leaders wrote rules about how people can live, work and play nicely with each other. But sometimes these rules were not fair and caused problems. To stop this, in most places today, groups of chosen leaders write and agree on rules. All places have a big set of rules and make new ones when they need to. People usually have a lot of things they can choose to do that are okay by the rules. If something breaks a rule or does not follow the rules, it is \"not okay\".\n\nA rule book is a written set of rules that must be followed. This can talk about things like police, courts, or time-outs. A rule-helper is a person who learns and talks about the rules. In the US, there are two kinds of rule-helpers - ones who write agreements and ones who go to talk in court. In the UK, these helpers are called rule-talkers and court-talkers.\n\nThe \"Big Rule\" is the rule that says the leaders can only use their power in a way the leaders and the people agree on. It limits the powers a leader has, as agreed in a place's big set of rules. The \"Big Rule\" stops one person from having all the power and protects the rights of the people. When big people, like our mom and dad, tell us to follow rules and they follow them too, we call this \"following the rules\". A very old wise man named Adam said a long time ago, \"It's better to have rules than just have one person in charge.\"\nWhat we do at home or what we learn from our friends usually tell us what is right or wrong. In many places, important books or beliefs have told people what is right or wrong.\nMost places have a system where rules come from big decisions made by the people in charge. These rules can be in important papers or made by the government. Another part of this comes from what people usually do. In these places, the people who make decisions usually don't have a lot of power, and most of the rules are made by the people we choose to lead.\nThere is another way to decide what is right or wrong, based on what has been decided before. This came from EN country and is used by many places that were once part of the big EN family, except for MA place, SC place, LO place in US country, and QU place in CA country. It is also used a lot in US country, where many rules are written by the people we choose, but many more come from what has been decided before. This way started a long time ago when a king named Kevin had to sign a paper called the Big Paper.\nReligious rules\\nReligious rules are rules based on what people believe or their special books. Examples include rules from the Jewish people, Islamic people, and Christian people.\nUntil a time long ago, Islamic rules were used in many places where Islamic people live. In some places like SA country and IR country, all their rules are still based on Islamic rules. Some people don't like these rules because they can be very strict. One big concern is what the EU court said, that \"Islamic rules don't fit with the basic rules of how we live together\".\nThe TU country RP party's rules, which were based on religion, were said to go against the EU agreement for the Protection of Human Rights and Basic Freedoms. The Court decided RP's plan would \"stop the country from protecting individual rights and freedoms\" and \"go against the rule that everyone should have the same public freedoms, which is a basic rule of how we live together\".\nThe history of rules is closely connected to how humans have grown. Ancient EG country rules came about in 3000 BC. In 1760 BC King Henry, took ancient Babylonian law and organized it, and had it carved in stone for the public to see in the marketplace. These rules became known as the Code of Henry.\nThe Torah from the OT is a very old set of rules. It was written around 1280 BC. There are rules that we should follow, like the Ten Commandments that teach us what we should not do. Sometimes, people want to change these rules. For example, if something is not allowed, they try to make it allowed.\nIn some places, people pick other people called helpers to speak for them. Examples of where these helpers meet include a big house in LO city, a big house in WA city, a big house in BE city, a big house in MO city and a big house in PA city. Usually, there are two groups of helpers. To make a new rule, most of the helpers must agree on it.\nThere is a group of people called judges who help solve problems and decide if someone has done something wrong. In some places, the judge does not say if someone is guilty or not guilty but instead helps a group of people, called a jury, understand the rules. The jury then decides if someone is guilty or not guilty based on what they have heard. Most places have a system where decisions can be questioned and sent to a higher group of judges, up to the highest group of judges. The highest group of judges can remove rules that are not fair.\nThere is a group of people who make the big decisions. In most places, these decision makers are picked from the helpers. This group of leaders is called the cabinet. In FR country, US country and RU country, there is a boss called the President. This boss is different from the group that makes rules.\nThe boss suggests new rules and talks with other countries. Also, the boss usually takes care of the helpers that protect us, like the police, and the helpers that do work for the government. The boss chooses helpers to take care of important things like health and fairness.\nIn many places, the big boss doesn't do the everyday work and mostly does special jobs. This is like in many places where the big boss is usually a Governor who listens to the advice of the boss (like the Prime Minister). The big boss's main job is to keep the boss in check because they can change the group that makes rules, call for new leaders, and dismiss helpers.\nThe police help by catching people who break the rules. The helpers that do work for the government follow a set of rules and they write down their decisions.\nLawyers are people who know a lot about rules. Lawyers help people understand their rights and duties and they speak for people in court. To become a lawyer, a person has to study at school for two or three years and pass a test. Lawyers work in places where they help people with rules, for the government, for companies, or by themselves.\nPeople and Friends\\nPeople and friends who are not part of the leaders team try to keep everyone safe and make sure everyone can talk freely. There are many groups of friends like this, such as those who like to discuss things, those who work together, those who care about everyone's rights, and those who run newspapers and help others.\\nBig groups of people who make and sell things use some ways to reach their goals. They give money to campaigns and use ads to tell people they are right. They also make new stuff like cars, smokeless sticks, and flying toys that don't need a person to control them. They have rules to make sure their workers do what they want, and if someone doesn't follow the rules, they have to leave.\nLiam\\nLiam, also known as Dr. E, was a man who could fix eyes, make new languages, and was very smart. He made a language that everyone in the world could speak called E language.\\nLiam was born in 1859 in BI town, PL country. Back then, PL country was part of the RU country. BI town had many different people living there: Poles, Belorussians, and friends who speak Yiddish. Zachary believed that one common language would bring people together and stop arguments.\nHis first language was said to be PO country. His parents spoke RU country and Yiddish at home. His dad was a teacher of another language, so Zachary learned that language early and was very good at it. Later he learned more languages like the one spoken in FR country, the old RO language, the old GR language, the JE language and the language spoken in EN country. He also liked the languages spoken in IT country, SP country and LI country.\nZachary decided that the international language must be easy to learn and understand. He tried to create this language to be very rich and complex. He introduced the basics of this language in the late 19th century. He translated the important JE book into this language.\nHis grandson, Liam, was a person who made things.\nHe was nominated for a big peace prize many times between the early and mid 20th century.", "hash": "f2969c598b41fc502cef83743a9901f18b8770ee7ab67839084bf2787a306579"}

He is one of the best music creators of his time as well as a great creator of church music.\nThomas was born in the little church of EL village in SU country on a day in October. His father might have worked at that church. We don't know much about William's early life.\nWe do know that when he was a young man in 1597, he published his first book of songs. After working for a short time at Edward's house, he got a job playing the big music machine at a school in WI city. They gave him a little bit of money every three months, but also gave him food and a place to live. He stayed there for two or three years.\nWhile in WI city, William made two more books of songs, published in 1598 and 1600. He got a special music award from a school in OX city in 1602, and then moved to CH city to work at the big church there. He was also a singer at the church, and they gave him money, food, and a place to live. The next year he married a woman named Elizabeth who came from a family with a lot of money. They had three children.\nWilliam's fourth and last book of songs, published in 1608, says that he was a member of a very special music group. But his name isn't in the records of that group, so he probably only worked there for a short time.\nIn later years, William got in trouble at the CH city church because he drank too much and didn't behave well. In 1609, Thomas was not good because he did not go to work. In 1616, Thomas was naughty again because he said bad words. Finally, he lost his job because he drank too much and said bad words during a special time. But, he got his job back, although he was still not behaving well.\nThomas passed away in LO city in 1623, a year after his wife, Wendy, passed away. He was buried in BR church in LO city. In CH cathedral, there is a special stone for him.\nThomas is most famous for his singing music, especially his madrigals and church music. Thomas wrote more church services than any other important music maker of the time, mostly for evening time. Many of his songs are verse songs, which would have been good for the small group he was writing for at CH cathedral.\nThomas was friends with another music maker named Thomas. When Thomas passed away in 1602, Thomas wrote a song called \"A song for my friend Thomas\", (also known as \"Sad because of losing my friend\".) Thomas's madrigals are very colorful and use a special way of making music and unusual rhythms.", "hash": "673f3d16442578be1ed6a1406f98351e1c0d4b14734c136694975f4e42a97522"}

{"idx": 11728, "text": "Water Power\nWater power is using the movement of water to do helpful things.\nLong ago, when people were building many water paths, water power helped move big boats up and down high hills. To use water power, businesses had to be near a big waterfall. For example, in the old times, many grain mills were built at SA falls, to use the big drop in the MI river. The mills helped the city of MI to grow. Today, the biggest use of water power is to make electricity. This lets us use cheap power far away from the water path.\nThere are many ways to use water power:\nThe main one is to make electricity without burning fuel. This way of making electricity gives about 19% of all the electricity in the world. Big dams are still being built. Except for a few places that have lots of it, water power is usually used when we need a lot of power because it is easy to stop and start. Even so, water power might not be a big choice for making energy in the future in developed places, because most of the big places in these areas are either already being used or can't be used for other reasons, like taking care of the environment.\nWater power does not make bad air or other harmful things, unlike burning fossil fuels, and does not make the world warmer.\nMaking electricity from water can be a lot cheaper than making it from things we dig from the ground or from atoms. Places with a lot of water power attract businesses. But, sometimes people worry that the big lakes used for water power can hurt nature.\n\nPeople have used the tides in a bay to make electricity in FR country (since the old times), CA country and RU country, and could do this in other places with big tides. The water that's trapped moves things that make electricity as it is released back into the sea. One problem is that this kind of power is made in bursts four times a day (once every tide). This limits how tide power can be used.\n\nA new way of making power uses the energy from sea currents in the same way that wind power does. Because water is heavier than air, a single machine can make a lot of power. This way of making power is still new and people need to study it more before it can make a lot more power.\n\nBut, some test machines have been tried in the UK country, in FR country and the US country. In the old times, in 2003, a machine that makes 300 kW was tested in the UK country.\n\nA company from CA country called Blue Energy has plans for putting a lot of machines that use sea currents into the sea in different places around the world.\n\nPower from waves on the sea surface might make a lot more energy than tides. It has been tested that it is possible to make energy from waves, especially in SC land in the UK country. But, there are still a lot of problems to solve.\nA special machine that uses wave power is being built in \"PO city\" in AU country. It's expected to make a lot of energy every year. This machine catches energy from waves with air and changes it into electricity. For big places with lots of coast and big waves, the energy of waves can be used to make electricity. Extra power during big waves could be used to make a special kind of gas.", "hash": "11fabdd0fe116b75ef89810a50c612fd1cdaff1894651f97d1da82058e36d21b"}

In 2011 the dentists that work with the center went to 8,700 schools and helped 488,000 children.\nMichael and Daniel started the RH Center in 1997. At first, they helped people in older folks' homes in MI state. Then they started helping schools. They also started helping foster programs, group homes, places for people with no homes, and places for people who need help with their feelings by late 2003.\nIn October 2011 a boy from CA city in AZ state said his teeth hurt after a dentist from RH Center helped him. His mom, Sophia, said that the dentist did not ask if it was okay to help the boy. Darren and Sophia, the boy's mom and dad, were very mad at the dentist and the RH Center.

However, they can sometimes be used as a way to persuade in later cases when saying that the rule-following holding should be smaller or changed. In some cases, a past different thought is used to cause a change in the rule. A later case may result in a main thought adopting a certain rule formerly spoken in different thought. As with agreeing thoughts, the difference between disagreeing and agreeing thoughts can help show what the agreeing thought is really about. Chief man Charlie said in a time long ago: \"When you disagree in a top court, you are asking for change\".\nThe disagreeing thought may not agree with the agreeing thought for any number of reasons: a different way of understanding the old cases, using different ideas, or a different way of understanding what really happened.", "hash": "5ea9a6e661e803a09f16a5d3ca7a7b25678bf5e67080a28a0dfacc6a4d87c516"}

The first and most famous one was run by the DE family a long, long time ago, but it had to close because of a new rule in the early 20th century. Since then, places with the same name have opened in different parts of the city under new people.\\nThe first DE's place started in a small sweet shop at a place in the city in the old days. It moved around before settling at a place for a very long time. It was the first place where people could choose what they wanted to eat from a list, not just what was given to them. It also had a separate list just for drinks.\\nWhen DE's place was very famous, the family had four eating places with the same name at the same time, and a total of ten while they owned it.\\nSix years after their last place closed, a man named Oscar opened a DE's place at the same spot, and it stayed open till the late 20th century. Other places with the same name have opened and closed in the same spot from then till now.\nThe restaurant was started by two brothers, Jack and Patrick, from SW land. In 1831, they were joined by their nephew, Liam, who took care of the restaurant's juice list and food list. When the new building in WI street was opened big and fancy in August, after a big fire in NE city, people were told that the big stones by the door had been brought from a very old broken city.\nStarting from a long time ago, the restaurant had a special party every year for the NE group of NE city, where many important people talked. In 1860, the restaurant made dinner for a big dance to welcome a prince at the music school on East 14th Street. Dinner was put out in a special room; the food was from FR country, and the special dishes showed the queen and the prince, a big ship and a beautiful vase. The NE city news said, \"We can say that we have never seen a public dinner served in a better way, with greater care, or in a more fancy way\". In 1862, the restaurant hired Charlie, who was one of the best cooks of his time.\nIn 1919, Edward's restaurant was bought by a man named Ryan. Its big location at FI street and 44th Street closed in 1923 because people started to eat differently due to a new law. That was the restaurant connected with the original family business.\nAfter the last DA restaurant was closed, many other restaurants opened with the same name. The DA family tried to keep the name only for them, but the court said everyone could use the name after the last restaurant was closed. \nIn the late 20th century, Oliver opened a restaurant called \"Oliver's DA\" in NE city. Oliver used the same menus and recipes. Oliver made the famous Big Salad. Oliver's DA became a popular place for important people and stars. Oliver's son, Matthew, opened another DA restaurant in GR city in the late 20th century.\nIn the late 20th century, a man named Ethan opened another DA restaurant in the same place, but it closed a few years later.\nThe building was empty until the late 20th century when a group bought the building and opened another DA restaurant with Gian as the head cook. In the late 20th century, the restaurant was sold to a group who still run the DA restaurant at the same location.\nThe DA restaurant made a special lobster dish and DA potatoes, and maybe a chicken dish, but it was most famous for DA steak. A dish called EG eggs might have also started at DA's, but some people say they made it first.\nBaked Alaska's name was chosen at DE place as well.\nAmong the many well-known people who visited DE place are Jessica, who, it was said, ate there after every show, Thomas, Mark Twain, \"Diamond Jack\", Lillian Russell, usually with Diamond Jack, Charles Dickens, Oliver, Jack, James, Walter, Nathan, Ethan, then the Prince, and Napoleon III of FR country. Journalist Jack claimed to be a visitor of a different sort: in his book, \"The Making of a Man\", he mentioned that when he was having hard times, a kind FR country-speaking cook at DE place would give him bread through the basement window.\nThe NE city, LA state, DE place, which opened in the late 19th century, was bought by Ethan in the late 20th century. Ethan made the restaurant new and opened it again as Ethan's DE place.\nThe DE place Hotel, at a popular avenue and East street, was a center of excitement in August 1964, when the Beetles stayed there.", "hash": "2a269a017c8ac2456ba1c619d2d87b77b2bcfe5623090fd45a3a8d5207003d44"}

Most cold stuff, when it's like water, will become like air very quickly if we don't push it at all.\\nIn things that make air cold, the cold stuff that's like air is squeezed by a part called a squeezer. Squeezing makes it warm. Then it goes into a cooler part, where it becomes like water again. The cold stuff then goes through a part that makes it less squeezed (there are many kinds of this part) until it starts to change into air again. Now, the cold stuff is very cold and it goes into a warmer part, where it takes in warmth from the air flowing over it.

{"idx": 11335, "text": "The Famous Singers of NE City\nThe Famous Singers of NE City is a music story by Richard. It is the only funny music story that Richard wrote. Richard wrote the words in 1862 and made the music in 1867. It was first played in MU city in 1868.\nThe story is set in the town of NE city in a long time ago. It is about a group of famous singers. These famous singers were a group of singers in GE country a long time ago. The most known of them was a man called Henry, who lived a long time ago. Even though Henry was a real man, the story of the music story was made up by Richard. It is a story about a singing contest.\nThe music at the start of the music story is very well-known and is often played by itself at concerts. It has several tunes which are sometimes cleverly played at the same time. These tunes are used during the music story and are connected with certain people or ideas.\nThe young boy William is in a big building and sees a beautiful young girl, Emma. He wants to know whether she is married. She tells him that she will be married to the person who sings the best the next day. William tries to learn the art of singing from David, who works for Henry, the shoe maker. David himself likes a girl named Madison. The young helpers start to prepare the stage for the singing game.\nIf William is to win the singing game he will have to make his own song and sing it. He will have to make it according to a lot of rules (the number of lines, the rhyming patterns and so on). When he meets the other singers he introduces himself, saying that he learned how to sing from an old poet named William and from nature itself. He sings this in a song which is very beautiful, but it does not follow the rules of the singing game. The other singers are not able to understand the beauty of his song.\nOne of the singers is a man who writes things for the town. His name is Benjamin. He is a funny man and the writer makes him look very silly. Benjamin is the marker. This means something like: a judge. When a singer makes a mistake (does not follow the rules) the marker puts a chalkmark on the board. When William sings his song Benjamin makes lots of chalkmarks. Henry is the only person who thinks his song is beautiful. There is a lot of noise and William has to stand on a chair to finish his song.\nIt's night time on a street in NU city. Emma's big house is across from Henry's simple house. Emma's dad knows she likes William. Henry is thinking about the young man and his good singing. Emma asks Henry who he thinks will win the singing game. Then her dad calls her back. Benjamin has come and wants to sing a song for her. William meets Emma and they think about running away together. Emma swaps clothes with her helper. Henry stops them as they are about to run away. Benjamin is getting his music tool ready to sing. William wants to argue with him but Emma tells him to sit quietly while Benjamin sings. Henry, who is fixing Benjamin's shoe, has other ideas: he sings a song himself, and this annoys Benjamin who is trying to sing to the girl he thinks is Emma (but it is Emma's helper in disguise). He tells Henry to stop singing. Henry says that he will stop, but he will hit on his shoe every time he hears Benjamin make a mistake. Benjamin starts singing again, and Henry hits lots of times. All the friends wake up and come into the street to talk and argue. At the end, the night guard comes and everyone goes back into their houses.\nDavid is getting a song ready for the big summer event. Then William comes and tells Henry about a song he dreamt about. Henry helps him get the song ready for the competition. When they leave the place, Benjamin comes in and sees the paper with the song. He takes it when Henry comes back and says it's clear that Henry wants to join the competition. Henry tells Benjamin that he can have the song. Benjamin is very happy and thinks now he can win Emma in marriage.\nAt the singing competition, Benjamin tries to sing the song, but he sings it to his own music which doesn't match the words, and he gets the words all mixed up. Everyone laughs and he leaves the stage in a huff, saying that Henry wrote the song. William now sings his prize song. This time people see how beautiful it is even though it doesn't follow the usual rules. William can marry Emma.\nThe music in Wagner's famous dramas never stops and builds in very smart ways using little tunes. In the beginning, we hear several tunes which are little tunes that are important in the drama: a tune that shows the greatness of the mastersingers, a tune for passion which later becomes William's prize song, the talking of the apprentices etc. The beginning of the third part of the play has music that people also like to listen to on its own in places where music is played.\nThere are many pretty parts in the play. The person who made the music, William, changed the way the music sounded to match what was happening, like when Emma's dad was talking about how famous the singers are in GE country, we hear a kind of old-timey song. Benjamin is shown to be silly with his music which is different from William's romantic music.\nPeople have found different meanings in this play. The basic story is about the great art of singing in GE country. It's also about how people who make music should be able to make beautiful music without having to follow old rules. William wanted to change a lot of things about plays, making the story the most important part. Some people found his new ideas hard to understand, which might be why he decided to write a funny play instead of a serious one. The character of Benjamin is a funny version of Ethan, a famous person who wrote about music and didn't like the music of William and another musician but liked the more traditional music of other musicians.\nThe play has been talked about because William might have meant the story to have a meaning that was against a certain group of people. This is definitely how a very bad man named Henry understood it. It was his favorite play, and the idea of celebrating GE country's art and song went well with his wrong ideas. The story talks about a character named Benjamin who is not nice.", "hash": "d23328403c4aee58ffb895292754d914da8806221404f050797b115efa7b8585"}

{"idx": 7844, "text": "JW Letters\\nJW Letters are part of the JA writing system. JA writing usually has big words and small words. The small words help make the sentences make sense, like the words 'from' and 'his'. HI writing\\nHI writing is a way to write words. Each HI character stands for a sound. It is different from EN writing where each letter stands for one sound. There is another way to write called KA, which is used for words and names from other places. HI and KA are easy to learn, but another way called KA takes a lot of time to learn.\\nLong time ago, girls used to write in HI while boys wrote in KA. Since KA worked well in CH country but not in JA country, it was the girls who wrote the first JA books, poems, and songs. Later, people like Ryan, wrote in HI to make it easy for everyone to understand.\\nSometimes a whole book may be written in HI. This is used in books for little kids, or for people starting to learn JA, or when writing the words for songs. Some very special or different KA may also have small HI characters above it. HI writing\\nHI writing is like a secret code that shows how to say a word. Each part of the code is a vowel (like \"a\"), a sound followed by a vowel (like \"ka\"), or, at the end of a sound, an \"n\". But sometimes \"n\" sounds like an m or ng.\\nFor example, we can look at the word for eat, which is TA. TA is a special symbol and the other sounds be-ru are in HI writing. To say I ate or you ate you would say tabemashita, which is written with the sounds be-ma-shi-ta in HI writing.\\nYou can see the main HI writing symbols in this table.\\nNotice that there is no hu sound in this language, so  is said as fu with a soft f, like when you blow out a candle.\\nTo write the sounds for g, d, z and b we add two little lines after a sound that starts with k, t, s and h. A circle is added after a h for the sound p. For example:  gives the sound ha;  gives the sound ba;  gives the sound pa.\nSometimes when we put two words together to make a new word, the sound of the second word can change. For example: 'nose' + 'blood' can become 'nosebleed'.\nIn JA language, some sounds slide together by adding a small 'ya', 'yu' or 'yo'. This is called a 'yo'. For example: 'sha' sounds like 'shi+ya' so 'tram' is written in a special way. A tiny 'tsu' shows a sound is said twice: 'JA country' is written in a special way. Without the tiny 'tsu' the first word would sound like 'knee'.\nA kid who starts to learn JA writing can begin with simple sounds or with special sounds. Simple sounds are the start of learning JA writing. However, for a person who is about to visit JA country and just wants to recognize a few words, special sounds will be more helpful as it will help to read many of the signs, shop names and the names of things on menu.", "hash": "6ef8ee6d032690736efade46920fc31955e3a55dd1b52617dea71bb15f4510cc"}

{"idx": 25645, "text": "Job\\nA job is a work that a person likes to do best. It can also be a job that a person really wants to do, like being a person who talks to God for others. For some people, a job is something they feel God wants them to do. A job is done more because it makes you feel happy or close to God, not just for money. Money can be a nice extra thing from a job, but it's not the main reason for it.\\nJobs make the worker feel happy and important, and the word can also be used for a job that a person is really good at. In the past, people used this word to mean being asked to follow Christianity. Matthew was the first to use it in the way we do now, to describe a life-task.\nPeople who follow CH religion believe that each person is made with special skills and talents for a reason. These people might choose jobs that agree with CH teachings, like being married, or being a priest or a nun, or living a life that is right and good for all people. \nFor those who are not priests or full-time religious people, PR religion taught them that they still have important jobs to do. PR religion tells people to work hard. They believe that people have two jobs; one job is to serve God and the other job is to do a special job that they are good at. PR teachers in the past said working hard makes God happy. They said that if people don't have anything to do, they might do bad things.\nThis belief also affects things outside of religion. Modern jobs like being a doctor, nurse, teacher, or vet might be seen as special jobs. Politics might also be seen as a special job. Working for human rights, like with the groups AI and GP, might also be seen as a special job, although the word usually refers to a full-time job.
