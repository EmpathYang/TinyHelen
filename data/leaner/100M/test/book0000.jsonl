Being scared is not good. Being scared can make everything seem bad. I will be brave. I will let it go away. And when it is gone I will be calm. When being scared is gone, there will be nothing bad. Only I will be here._\n\n--FRED, _A DESERT STORY_\n\nTHE UP PLACE--WINTER--A LONG TIME AGO\n_In the Small Village_\n\nFifteen-year-old Sam stood alone in the middle of the group of villagers. He was messy with red paint. He still held the toy knife in his hand. The village's bully lay on the ground at his feet, paint from a paint fight all over him. Sam quietly looked at the villagers as he put the paint-covered toy into the rope belt at his waist.\n\nThe people in the village knew the toy knife in Sam's hand. The bullies used the toy to play with and tease others. But today the villagers had seen a fifteen-year-old boy use the toy with a determination and bravery that surprised them.\n\nSlowly, more quiet villagers came out from their houses and the group around the boy got bigger. The people of the village had never completely understood the one they called Sam. They had found him when he was two years old in the leftover ruins of a neighboring village thirteen years ago. The bullies had made everyone else run away from the village. The wary villagers didn't know if the only one left was a good luck charm or a joke, but they couldn't leave him there all alone. They took the baby to a place called \"VI town\". Here he lived with them but never really felt like one of them. Even his name was different. He was called Samuel, a word meaning _orphan._ They could have called him Oliver, a more common word for _orphan_, but they decided to make him feel different. When Samuel was old enough to understand, he knew he was not wanted. He wasn't avoided but also wasn't invited. The other kids were scared of him after they saw him win a fight over food against a bigger boy. Samuel was never loved and he didn't know how to love either. When he was big enough, he built his own little house away from everyone else. He did his part of the work but didn't share anything else. Everyone knew that Samuel would leave \"VI town\" one day. It wasn't his home. It was just a place where he stayed alive.\n\nNow that he had helped the villagers by defeating a dangerous enemy, Samuel felt he had done enough for them and it was time for him to leave. He had stayed long enough in a place where he didn't fit in.\n\nRabbi Kevin, holding his scared twelve-year-old daughter's hand, came into the circle of villagers. Samuel looked at the girl, who looked back at him with big, brown eyes. They gave each other little smiles.\n\nSamuel nodded to the villagers to say thank you for saving his life a long time ago. Some of the people nodded back. Most did not. Still wet with red liquid, Samuel wrapped himself in a big animal skin and walked alone toward the road that led to the cold wilderness. As he got closer to the forest he heard a girl crying. She shouted, \"Don't go, Samuel. Please don't go. Who will protect us now?\" No one answered.\n\nIn the last month of the final year of a time long ago, after many weeks of a hard journey across the land, Samuel left from a big place where ships come and go as a passenger on a ship going to BE city. He wore clothes that belonged to a man who was no longer alive.\n\nIn a time long after, bad things happened, started by a big person named Alexander. This made the little towns into places known as Cities of Hurt. People were either made to join the army, hurt very badly, or forced to run for their lives.\n\nTHE CITY OF HURT \n MA town --Winter-- A time long ago\n\nFrank, an old man who worked as a butcher, found Samuel's almost gone body lying face down in the snow behind his little shop. Ethan quickly took the little boy into his cozy shop and soon into his kind heart.\n\nEthan moved to AM country from RU country long time ago. The trip that almost took his life also hurt his feelings deeply. He didn't trust anyone. He didn't love anyone. He chose to be alone for many years. After some time, Ethan's heart changed, but when he was ready to be with other people, it was too late for him to have his own family. So he lived alone, without love, in a small area with other people who also moved from other places, until the day this boy suddenly came into his life.\n\nEthan never asked the quiet boy from RU country about the crumpled, messy papers that said his name was Hans from DE country. Ethan just understood that one lost person from RU country had made it to the new place, while one sad person from DE country had been left behind.\n\nWhen the boy and the old man had been living together for a couple of years, they began to trust each other. This trust slowly turned into the loving bond like father and son. Ethan taught Hans the mixed language of the small area--a mix of RU language, YI language, and some English, but the quiet young man hardly talked to anyone. He stayed by himself, even after he had been living there for two years, and no one in the small area could say they knew him well. Then one day, Hans decided to stop being quiet.\n\n\"Samuel,\" she finally said to Henry, \"I knew it would be you.\"\n\n\"He is no orphan,\" Ethan challenged the young woman. \"He is my son.\"\n\nShe looked at Ethan kindly. \"He is your son now. But once he was Samuel.\"\n\n\"How did you know?\" Henry asked softly.\n\n\"I'm from VI town,\" she said. \"I'm Mr. K's daughter, Grace.\"\n\n\"You were a little girl when I last saw you,\" Henry said. \"Is Mr. K well?\"\n\n\"He's not alive anymore.\" She sighed. \"They're all not here anymore. There is only you and me.\"\n\nHenry P married Grace K a year later and they settled in the DO place near Ethan. Grace gave birth to two babies before she brought a healthy son into the world a long time ago. They named their son Harry in memory of her father, Mr. H. They gave Harry an _S_ as a middle initial but no full name or explanation was ever provided. Harry S. P, the son of Henry and Grace P of the PA place, would grow up, never really knowing or caring about the hard times from which his parents came.\n\nA long time ago Harry married Rachel K, the daughter of a person who makes clothes. For a long time, they couldn't have a baby. At last, in the late 20th century, Ethan was born. He was their only child. They named him after Ethan's grandpa, who had passed away peacefully in his sleep a few years before Ethan was born.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Henry moved his family from their old town to a quiet neighborhood in BE town, a nice place far from the city. Gabriel and Grace wanted to stay in their old town even though many people were leaving because of the new people coming to their neighborhood.\n\nEthan was different from other boys his age. He could be nice and funny, but sometimes he would act in scary ways. With just a small reason, Ethan could get very mad and act out. Before he was ten years old, he became a strong boy who wasn't scared of anything. Ethan's parents were worried and didn't understand why. They didn't know of any angry people in their family. Ethan's grandma and grandpa, who had kept an old family story from their son and his family, knew that the same strong spirit from their ancestor was now in Ethan.\n\nMany years later, an old Gabriel watched a boxing game with his son, Henry. They were watching fifteen-year-old Ethan in a boxing game, fighting a much bigger boy. Ethan was his grandpa's favorite boxer. Henry compared his grandson's strong will to a very good boxer. However, Henry's other son, Harry, didn't like how Ethan boxed. Harry thought Ethan was too wild in the ring and didn't show enough respect for his opponent or for the rules of boxing.\n\nEthan was not doing well in the boxing match that night. He was not as good as his opponent. He had fallen down three times in three rounds. After the third time Ethan fell down in the last round, Samuel thought he saw his grandson get up and pretend to fight his opponent like he was a big brown bear. In Samuel's confused mind, the other boxer had turned into a scary brown bear and his grandson was pretending to fight the bear with a sword. The bear was falling down.\n\nSuddenly, there was a loud noise and a bell started ringing which made Samuel jump. A large group of people cheering came back around him. Samuel felt dizzy and mixed up. He felt a sharp pain in his chest and put his right hand over his heart as if to stop it from hurting more. But the hurt was already there, and the old man slowly fell to the ground like a tired blade of grass.\n\nSamuel looked up from the floor at the faces spinning above him. His son, Harry, was kneeling next to him, holding his hand. His grandson's face showed up. There were tears of sadness in the boy's eyes, and his face was hurt. The old man asked Ethan to come closer. Henry saw his father whisper into his son's ear. He saw Ethan's lips move but couldn't hear the words. He saw his father wink at Ethan and saw Ethan wink back. Then the old man felt pain and held his chest. It was time to leave.\n\nIn the soft time between life and not-life, there was no more hurt. Sam moved toward a bright light far away that was slowly getting dimmer. A big bear and a blond boy joined him at the end of the world. Then the light went away and there was only darkness.\n\n## CHAPTER 1\n\nETHAN SAM--SAM'S GRANDSON\n\nThe _S_ in Ethan S. was never explained to me. I had no middle name and neither did my father, Henry S. In a time when I was seven years old I asked my father about the unattached _S_. He told me that we were so poor we couldn't afford a whole middle name. His explanation made me happy until I shared it with a kid at school two days later. \"Middle names don't cost, silly.\" He laughed at me, so I hit him in the nose and made him cry. He went home and told his dad. His dad told my dad. My dad was unhappy.\n\n\"Why did you hit that kid?\" my dad asked.\n\n\"He was teasing about my middle name,\" I said.\n\n\"You don't have a middle name.\"\n\n\"I told him we didn't have money for one.\"\n\n\"Oh, Ethan, I was just joking.\"\n\n\"I'm only seven. How should I know you were joking?\"\n\n\"Well, you're always joking,\" my dad said.\n\n\"I never joked about my middle name.\"\n\n\"Well, your grandma and grandpa didn't tell me about the _S_ when I asked, so I really don't know.\"\n\n\"They didn't tell you they didn't have money for all the letters?\" I asked.\n\n\"Stop it,\" my dad warned.\n\n\"Do you think Grandma and Grandpa would tell me about the _S_?\"\n\n\"Why would they tell you if they didn't tell me?\"\n\n\"Maybe they love me more.\"\n\n\"Your grandpa does. You're just like him,\" my dad said.\n\n\"Is that not good?\" I asked.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" my dad decided.\n\n\"Can I ask Grandpa about the _S_?\"\n\n\"You can. But first, say sorry to the kid you hit.\"\n\n\"Why don't you say sorry? \"You started this.\"\n\nI said sorry the next morning, and in the afternoon, I asked my grandparents about the mysterious letter S. They both laughed and gave me a chocolate cookie instead of an answer. I was only seven. I took the cookie.\n\nIn the late 20th century, I already knew I wanted to be a policeman. A lot of little boys dreamed of becoming a policeman, a fireman, or a cowboy when they grew up. We even had a boy in our neighborhood who wanted to be a superhero and didn't want to wait until he was older. On his eighth birthday, he jumped off the railing of his front porch, which was ten feet above the ground. He was wearing a bedsheet as a cape. I remember the letter S on his shirt was written backward. He fell straight down and landed on his face on the hard ground below. He hurt his nose, both arms, and left leg. After that, I didn't even want to think about flying. I just wanted to be a policeman who stays on the ground.\n\nBoys, I found out later, were not always supposed to grow up to be policemen. Usually, young kids were told by their \"first-generation AM country parents\" who only saw policemen and robbers in their bad dreams. These parents dreamed of their children growing up to become doctors, lawyers, dentists, and occasionally, a person who does a lot of counting, but never a policeman.\n\nMy parents, who never practiced a specific religion, never told me not to follow my dream of becoming a policeman. They didn't want me to become anything different. This made me different from the other kids in my place. I just didn't fit in. I was small and thin with light brown hair, a small nose, a tough attitude, and I didn't like our traditions. I wasn't impressed with the other kids' beliefs, either.\n\nThe kids had a lot of stories about their beliefs that I thought were strange. For example, one group said their hero could split water. The other group said their hero could walk on water. No winner!\n\nOne group said they had a person who was swallowed by a big fish but lived to tell the tale. The other group had their own big fish story. No winner!\n\nOne group had music for funny dancing like a happy song, but the other group had songs you could sing like a beautiful song and a peaceful song. I liked the peaceful song. Point, other group.\n\nOne group's old story said that baby Matthew could have died but was saved in a miracle and lived for a very long time. Then, the old story said Matthew talked to a burning bush and got Ten Rules directly from above. That story is difficult to beat. The other group, however, did just that. In their new story, they said that baby Jack was born to a mother, died, came back to life, went to heaven, and was coming back when he wanted. BE CAREFUL, BOYS!\n\nNothing about big groups of people believing the same thing made any sense to me but it always seemed to be near me even when I tried to avoid it. When I was a kid the 'Js' secretly made fun of the 'Cs' because they were afraid of them. On the other hand, the 'Cs' openly made fun of 'Js' because they weren't afraid of them. A typical 'J' versus 'C' meeting in those days went something like this:\n\n\"You 'Js' did something bad to our hero,\" a 'C' boy would say.\n\n\"Did you know that the bad word you used was actually made up by 'Js' from one country to talk about 'Js' from another country?\" a young 'J' boy might answer.\n\n\"Who cares? You're a 'J' and you did something bad to our hero.\"\n\n\"Who told you I was a 'J' and who told you I did something bad to your hero?\"\n\n\"My mom and dad,\" the 'C' boy would say.\n\n\"Your mom and dad are wrong. I don't mean to be rude,\" a 'J' peacemaker would try.\n\n\"Says who?\" the 'C' boy would ask.\n\n\"My mom and dad, if I may say so,\" the 'J' speaker might answer.\n\n\"Oh really,\" the offended 'C' boy would say with a raised fist.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" the scared 'J' boy would say with worry.\n\nMostly the 'Js' won the talks but lost the arguments. In my case things were different. I never talked and I never lost an argument. When I heard the accusation, \"You 'Js' did something bad to our hero,\" my immediate response was a push, making the other boy surprised.\n\n\"Oh no! You hurt my nose!\"\n\n\"Ethan hurt your nose,\" I explained. \"This had nothing to do with me.\"\n\nA second hit drew more complaints and usually the question: \"What happened to the friends who always want to talk?\"\n\n\"They're not here today.\"\n\nI never planned any of these fights. It just happened. Whenever I felt scared, bright red spots would appear in front of my eyes, and everything that followed was purely by instinct. My lack of fear, the red spots only I could see, my ability to defend myself and my funny sense of humor were as unknown to me as my middle name. The fact that my private part could talk in a voice only I could hear surprised me most of all.\n\n\"Hey, look at me. I can stand up,\" I heard one night in bed when I was about eleven years old.\n\n\"Who is that?\"\n\n\"Look. Down here under the covers.\"\n\nI looked. \"You can talk?\" I couldn't believe it.\n\n\"Of course I can talk but only you can hear me.\"\n\n\"How come you never talked to me before?\"\n\n\"You were too young. You wouldn't understand.\"\n\n\"Do you have a name?\"\n\n\"I have a lot of names. You can call me Patrick, Charles, David, Sam, Peter, Sam, Mr. Happy, Sausage, Sam, Tom, Thomas, Oliver, William, William, William, Peter, Patrick, Ryan, Banana, Ben, Big Ben, Benjamin, Bishop, David, David, David, David, David, Gabe, Hog, Sam, Jack, Mr. Jack, Jack, Kevin, Longfellow, Peter, Peter, Ryan, Sam, Sam, Samuel, --\n\n_Enough already. What do you want me to call you?_\n\n_I like Mr. Jack. It has class._\n\n_Okay, fine. Look, I 'm tired, Mr. Jack. Good night_.\n\n_Don 't go to sleep yet_. Mr. Jack sounded like he was worried.\n\n_Why not?_\n\n_I was wondering if you could help me so we can both get some sleep._\n\nIt was the start of a very long friendship with lots of happy and sad times.\n\nMany years ago, the same time I first met Mr. Jack, my dad let me join a boxing class hoping to help me use my energy for something nice. Sadly, the boxing rules were no match for me. I hit and pushed my way to the top of the class without using much of the \"nice game\" I was being taught. My upset boxing teacher told my dad that he should take me either to the \"FR Zoo\" or to the \"WE Club\" with the other wild animals to find more suitable opponents. So, when I was a kid, my dad signed me up for the \"WE Club\" Boxing program.\n\nThe \"WE Club\", opened a long time ago, was made to help the poor children of a tough, mostly IT country place in Boston. The boxing program, the hardest in the town, was watched over by the \"P.A. Club\" of Boston. My first day at the gym the police were not very happy with a small Jewish kid from the nice suburb of \"BR town\". They didn't notice me until I won my first three matches by stops. A stop was what they called it when the referee would stop a match before someone got hit too hard or badly hurt. I was stopping everyone. Suddenly, the police liked me and I liked them back. I liked their clothes, their friendship, and their commitment. My only dream was to become a super policeman like them and do good things for good people and bad things to bad people.\n\nI knew what I could do even when I was young. I was smart in the real world but I was never going to be a famous doctor or lawyer and definitely not a big scholar. But I wanted to do something good in my little part of the world and I thought I could do that best as a police officer.\n\nI did boxing at the WE building in the Silver Gloves program for three years until the area was changed a lot by people in charge. They used special words like _troubled area_ and used the money from the government to fix troubled areas, people in charge of Boston tore the WE area down. The close neighborhood was replaced with big, fancy apartments and a bigger hospital. By a time long ago, a whole neighborhood of seven thousand people was gone. The year the WE building was torn down I won both the state and NE Golden Gloves championships at a weight of 126 pounds. Without the \"Spirit of the House\" supporting me though, my victories felt empty and meaningless.\n\nMy excitement for boxing was gone like the WE area itself, until a big challenge brought back my excitement. The planned Golden Gloves middleweight title fight was being stopped because of an injury to the challenger. I was offered the fight, if I could gain enough weight to make the minimum of 135 pounds. My opponent would be the current Golden Gloves middleweight state champion, Gabriel \"The Destroyer\" Montoya, a twenty-year-old boxer who has never lost, and very talented. I was a small, sixteen-year-old, unbeaten lightweight fighter with skills that people questioned. My dad didn't want me to fight. \"That kid is too big and talented for you,\" he warned me.\n\n\"I'm not scared of him,\" I said truthfully.\n\n\"I know. You're not scared of anything. But maybe you should be,\" my dad suggested. \"Montoya can really fight. You still fight like you're not good.\"\n\n\"Not good? I'm unbeaten in twenty-one matches, Dad.\"\n\n\"That's because you've been fighting others who are not good. This guy's not one of them. He could hurt you.\"\n\n\"I'll take my risks.\"\n\nWhile I was practicing for Montoya, my grandpa often visited my practice sessions. \"You're doing well,\" he told me in his heavy accent one day while I was hitting the big bag.\n\n\"Thanks, Grandpa, but Dad thinks I'm not good at fighting.\"\n\n\"Don't let him bring you down. You're a good player. In fact, you remind me of that old strong guy Barney Ross.\"\n\n\"What's a strong guy?\"\n\n\"A tough person from the streets.\"\n\n\"Who's Barney Ross?\"\n\n\"A tough street boxer they called the Pride of the Street. His real name was Beryl Rosofsky.\"\n\nMy grandpa's memory had been getting worse for the past couple of years, so I couldn't help but question if his memory of the old-time player was correct.\n\n\"Did he fight like he's not good?\" I asked.\n\n\"No, Ethan. He fought like the champion he was. He had a lot of fights and he won most of them.\"\n\n\"And I remind you of him?\" I asked, happy with my grandfather's memory of the moment.\n\n\"Yes, you do. Benjamin wasn't afraid of anything.\"\n\n\"I'm not afraid of anything, either, Grandpa,\" I said honestly.\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" the old man agreed. \"You're like me when I was your age. I wanted you to know that you're my Benjamin and my favorite fighter.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Grandpa.\"\n\nWe hugged. He felt weak.\n\n\"Are you okay, Grandpa?\" I asked when the hug ended.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" he said, tapping his head with his finger. He knew what was happening to him. \"Listen, Ethan, your dad has his own ideas about boxing, so let's just keep Benjamin our little secret.\"\n\nHe winked at me, and I winked back.\n\n\"As long as we're sharing secrets, Grandpa, what about the toy?\"\n\nHe wagged his finger at me like he had caught me being a naughty boy. We both laughed. Then I tried to ask about a different secret.\n\n\"Okay, Grandpa, forget the toy,\" I accepted. \"There's something else I want to ask you.\"\n\n\"Ask.\"\n\n\"Did you have anything to do with the trouble of those two guys who hurt Grandma?\" When I was a little kid, two men, still quite young, had been found in trouble at the Big Zoo. The trouble happened shortly after my grandparents had been bothered by them on a bright summer afternoon in their own neighborhood. My grandmother had fallen down during the event, and the back of her head hit the floor. Afterward, she could not remember the bother, and shortly after she began to feel confused all the time. My grandfather had been made to sleep during the event but he remembered the faces of the bad guys. He went to the grown-ups in blue. There were plenty of people who saw the event, but no one came forward. No one seemed to care or have the bravery to risk their own safety by speaking up against the bad guys. No action was ever taken. A few weeks later, the two bad guys were found in trouble near the bear home at the Big Zoo. One had a big boo-boo on his chest, and the other had a big cut on his neck. The trouble, like the bother, was never solved.\n\n\"It doesn't matter who troubled those boys,\" my grandfather said. \"What matters is that they won't be bothering anyone else anymore.\"\n\n\"I'm glad they're gone,\" I said to my grandfather.\n\n\"So am I,\" Adam told me.\n\n\"So, did you do it?\n\n\"How could a little old man like me overpower two big boys like them?\" He laughed.\n\n\"You were younger then.\"\n\n\"I was still a little old man.\"\n\n\"Were you too old to handle those boys?\" I asked.\n\n\"It would be almost impossible,\" he said.\n\n\"But not totally impossible.\"\n\n\"No, not totally impossible,\" he agreed.\n\n\"But how could the smaller boy win?\" I continued.\n\n\"Surprise and confidence,\" my grandpa said. \"The smaller boy has to surprise the bigger one and the bigger one has to be sure enough to think he can't lose.\"\n\n\"So, it could happen?\"\n\n\"Yes. It could happen,\" my grandpa said, and he gently poked my arm.\n\nI softly patted his shoulder in return.\n\nWe understood each other very well.\n\nThe fight felt strange from the beginning. When we met in the middle of the place for the guide's instructions, it was the first time I had been close to the other boy. He was bigger than I thought and even though I was as big as I needed to be, he made me look small. He was furry as a bear, with no front teeth and breath that smelled bad. I held my breath until we touched hands and moved apart. It was then that I noticed that Mr. Teddy Bear was hiding somewhere in my tummy. He had never done that before.\n\n_What's wrong?_ I asked Mr. Jack while going back to my spot.\n\n_What's wrong with me? What's wrong with you? Did you see how big that boy is? One wrong move, and me and the twins are gone. I'm staying right here until this is over._\n\n_Where are the twins?_\n\n_They're by themselves._\n\n_So, I'm alone tonight._\n\n_We'll see what happens._\n\nWhen the bell rang to start the beginning I was still thinking about Gino's bad breath and Mr. Jack's fear. When the bell rang to start the end, I had fallen down twice, once at the start and once in the middle, and his breath wasn't the problem. My face was swollen and I had a headache from Montoya's constant pokes between my eyes. Mr. Jack was still hiding.\n\n_I told you,_ he whispered to me after the first fall, but he had been quiet since then. Everyone was shouting for the game to be stopped, but I kept moving enough to show the referee that I wasn't really hurt and could still protect myself. I moved a lot and actually touched Montoya on the back with a left swing at the end of the middle when he turned to go to his corner. He turned around and looked at me like I was silly.\n\nWhen we met in the middle of the circle to start the third game, he smiled at me.\n\n\"Hey, little friend,\" he said through his mouthguard. \"Be careful. I'm feeling sore.\"\n\n\"Wait until I make you feel more sore,\" I told him as we touched gloves like good friends.\n\nSoon after, I was on the ground again. I wasn't hurt. I was annoyed. I couldn't get close to him. He kept pushing me away with his longer arms. Even though he wasn't hurting me, he was doing a good job of making me feel bad and winning the game. I got up from the third fall quickly and started to chase him again, but the game leader stood in my way.\n\n\"I think you've had enough, Ethan,\" he told me.\n\nI moved him aside. \"I'm just beginning,\" I grumbled through my messy mouthguard.\n\nThe game leader knew me well enough to let the game continue. Gabriel was standing across the circle with his arms raised in celebration. He was smiling and bouncing on his feet proudly! That mean boy. With his mouthguard covering his missing teeth and from a distance where I couldn't smell his breath, even I had to admit he looked like a winner. I looked like I had done something silly. When Benjamin saw me standing in front of him again, he shook his head like he couldn't believe I was back. He started walking toward me, smiling--so sure of himself! The meanie! He was standing right in front of me, and I was suddenly very aware of everything. I looked at the big man like I was looking at him through a looking glass. Just below his heart I saw the tiny _thump, thump, thump_ of the thing that was making him strong. If I was going to win this game, I had to stop that thump and I had to stop it now. I got ready to play again, but as he got closer I squatted low. My hands almost touched the ground when Benjamin swung a slow, sure, big swing at my head. His hand passed safely over my shoulder, just as I saw red in my mind. _Got you! You meanie!_ I thought as I moved forward and pushed my hand into his chest, trying to make him fall. I heard him make a noise like I had hurt him. I kept moving forward with my hands and kept pushing him until he fell over the top rope. When I couldn't touch him on the front anymore, I tried poking him on the back and sides. Suddenly, the person in charge was pulling me away. \"Ethan, enough, enough,\" he was yelling in my face through the red spots. \"Stop it.\"\n\nI tried to get free, but I couldn't escape. The red spots started to fade and I finally stopped fighting.\n\n\"You okay now?\" the person in charge asked me. \"Can I let you go?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I'm okay,\" I told him.\n\nThe person in charge raised my hand in victory. The crowd clapped. The bright lights came on, and the sound of a bell was heard again and again.\n\n_Hey, I knew we could do it_, Mr. Jack said as he came out of hiding. I ran to the ropes trying to locate my dad and grandpa. I saw people standing in their section, but none of them were looking at the ring. They were all looking down at the floor. I did not see my dad or grandpa standing among them, so I ran into the crowd. I saw Grandpa Henry lying on his back, holding my dad's hand. They both turned to me when I arrived. I took off my hat and knelt beside them. Grandpa Henry touched my face with a cold hand. His face was very pale, and I realized he was not feeling well right then and there. Tears came to my eyes. My grandpa, Gabriel, asked me to come closer. When my ear was near to his mouth he whispered, \"You defeated a big animal, just like me, Ethan.\"\n\nAs far as I knew, my grandpa had never defeated a big animal and I didn't want to upset him by telling him there were no big animals in the big city arena--except maybe in his imagination. So, I told him a white lie.\n\n\"Yeah, Grandpa,\" I said. \"I defeated a big animal. Just like you.\"\n\n\"Did you see red spots, Ethan?\"\n\n\"How did you know about the red spots?\" His question surprised me.\n\nGrandpa Gabriel didn't answer. Instead, he winked at me, and his meaning was clear. A part of Grandpa Gabriel was a part of Ethan. I winked back at him to show that I understood. He clutched his chest as if it hurt and his eyes closed tightly. I knew he was going away.\n\n\"Grandpa,\" I called to him. \"Does this have something to do with the mystery?\"\n\nHe was gone.\n\nAt my grandpa's goodbye ceremony I couldn't help but think about the big animal. I wish there had been time to ask him. But Grandpa Gabriel had gone to his beloved Grandma Grace. I was a sixteen-year-old kid who still didn't have all the answers and without Grandma and Grandpa there, I didn't even get a cookie.\n\nI hurt my hands very badly during that last round, and I found out much later that I also made Gabriel sad.\n\nAFTER THE MATCH--WHAT HAPPENED NEXT\n\nThree decades after that match, I saw Gabriel's name in a newspaper. I hadn't seen him once in those years, even though we both stayed nearby. Gabriel had passed away suddenly, the newspaper said, when he was fifty years old because of a big heart issue. I went to Gabriel's remembrance event at a Funeral Home in an east city that same day. I didn't tell his family who I was when I shared my sadness and found it very hard to look at his young daughter and son. I heard a talk while I was waiting to see him. I learned that Gabriel's heart problem was caused by a thing called an aneurysm that had burst without any warning in his heart. This kind of aneurysm, I heard, was usually because of a past chest hurt that wasn't noticed until it was too late. I felt cold as I stood by Gabriel's casket and looked at him. He looked like he had a good life.\n\nThere were big pictures of Gabriel around his coffin. There was a picture of him at his special church day and one of him on his wedding day. He was happy in the second picture, and I saw he had many teeth. Then I saw the picture of him in his shorts for boxing. He had a winner's belt around his middle. He looked so full of life that it was hard to think of him as the still body in the box. His eyes looked proud at the camera. I put my right hand on my heart and tapped it a few times. I told David I was sorry and said bye-bye.\n\n## CHAPTER 2\n\nME AND PENELOPE\n\nFrom a long time ago, I moved through a big school without knowing where to go. The only person I felt close to was a girl with blond hair and blue eyes named Penelope. I fell in love with her the first time I saw her on the front steps of the big school when I was new. She wasn't perfect but she was perfect for me. Penelope had a small bump on her back behind her right shoulder, because she was sick when she was small. The first time we really met was when I beat up a bigger school football player who was laughing at her back.\n\n\"Thank you for helping me,\" she said after I had beaten the mean boy.\n\n\"No one laughs at my friend,\" I told her.\n\nShe laughed. I had her attention, and she had Mr. Thomas's attention. In fact, Mr. Thomas and I thought about Penelope every night. I knew I would marry Penelope someday, just like I knew I would be a police officer.\n\nThe students at Big School mostly had grandparents from a far away country, with second most having grandparents from a different country. There were a few kids from two more different countries, and one kid named Henry. There were twin girls in our grade; their last name was C. Everyone called them the Twins C. They seemed nice, but we never talked. They were very smart, and I must have looked scary with all the marks on my face after weekend games.\n\nThere were three groups in every grade in almost every public school, and Big School was the same. In the top group were the students who studied a lot, who would grow up to be doctors, scientists, and lawyers. At Big School, most of the top group kids had grandparents from the far away country, except for the Twins C, Henry, and some other smart kids. I was a middle-group kid. Kids in the middle group were average in just about everything. We didn't think too much about the future. We just tried to do our best and not to fall into the bottom group.\n\nI didn't want to be part of the bottom group. They were in school only because they had to be there. The boys who didn't do so well were likely to do a lot of hard work when they grew up. The girls who also didn't do well were likely to marry these boys and their children might also not do so well. This seemed like it was already decided. Some kids who didn't do well became very good, and some who were very good didn't do so well in the end. But mostly, children didn't change much when they grew up. I did my best to stay right in the middle where I felt I belonged. I didn't have many fights at school because the ones I had at the beginning made others not want to fight me anymore. That was good for me.\n\nI finished school when I was seventeen years old. My parents never talked about me going to further school, and I didn't think about it either, which was strange for a family like ours. I did different jobs for a few years after school, mostly in the business where my father worked. While the children who did really well in school went to learn more, and those who didn't do well went to do hard work, I helped unload trucks and carried big pieces of meat in a very old market. The work was hard, the hours were long, and the money was little, but I didn't mind. I was just waiting until I was old enough to go to the police school. I kept myself strong by learning judo and karate, and became very good at both.\n\nIn a time long ago, I joined the police school. I asked Penelope if she would be my wife when I finished school. She said yes. I was very good at everything at school and finished as one of the best students. I was surprised. My parents were surprised. Penelope was surprised. For the first time in my life I realized, if I was motivated, I could do really well. When I got my police badge, I felt like I had everything. I had a girl I loved and the job I wanted. I was young and healthy, and everything seemed possible.\n\n## PART 3\n\nBRIGHT LIGHT AFTER THE DARK\n\nMy first job in the police was at Police Station One, at the south entrance of a big tunnel in the city. It was right opposite the big market where I had carried heavy meat the year before. I loved the city. I rented a one-bedroom home in a building on a street for fifty-five coins a month. There were homes available for twenty-five coins a month, but I wanted warmth and my own bathroom. Penelope and I got married one year after I joined the police, and she moved into my home. We never moved again.\n\nOn my first day of work, I met a small, thin man in front of a building on PR street, where a sign said it was HU Realty. He gave me a funny smile and shook my hand. He told me his name was Nathan.\n\n\"I wish you good luck, Officer Patrick,\" he said nicely. \"But this neighborhood doesn't need guys like you.\"\n\n\"Why is that, Mr. Nathan?\"\n\n\"Because they have guys like me.\"\n\nHe was the boss of the neighborhood. He only answered to Ryan, from RI town, the biggest boss. The NE part was safe because of tough men like Nathan, just like he said. Many bad guys lived in the NE part, but they did their bad things somewhere else. It was a strange way of living, but it worked.\n\nThe NE part used to be called the Island of NB. It was the first place in AM city to have a school, a playground, and a windmill. The NE part was a home for IR country people, then Jewish people, and then IT country people. The IR country people left for the SE part in the old days. Between a long time ago and another long time ago, the Jewish people filled SA street with their carts and old ways. By the time I started my job, the NE part was the Little IT city of BO city. This was a place where parades used to happen. This place was where families and a big group of people lived together but were careful with each other. The big group had been there since a long time ago when a man named Gaspare brought them from a faraway place. This small place with tight streets and churches was home to a lot of good people and a lot of strong men.\n\nI became a police officer just after a man named Albert was sent to jail for his whole life, but there were still many crimes and bad people to keep me busy. My city had everything. Bad people like Daddy, Wimpy, and Chico became victims themselves. A group called The Wayos--led by Walter, Red, and Steve--scared South city for years and fought in the wars of a long time ago. Only Red seemed to have survived.\n\nIn the early 80s, a man named Nunzio was caught, judged, and sent away forever. He had been found because of a hidden device in his office and his own loud voice. The place changed after that. It became a more dangerous place. Red and Steve tried to take over where Nunzio left off. Cameron's older brother, Victor \"The Big\" Cameron, helped his brother.\n\nI met many unique friends over time and learned the value of the decisions we make. There was a nice-looking boy named Jack \"Handsome\" Matthew, who was a local school football star. Matthew was a clever boy and had many offers to play college football. Instead, he chose to learn from the streets of BO city. In the end, Matthew admitted to doing twenty very bad things in less than twenty years. Bad decision.\n\nAdam was a small-time bad guy from the area who I never met but wish I did. Adam wasn't really suited for a life of wrongdoing and left the BO city for CA state in a time long ago. In Hollywood, Adam lost a lot of weight and got a role in a famous drama from the early 20th century. I saw the drama and thought Adam was quite good. Usually, there was only one way to leave the bad group, but the bad guys liked the famous drama so much they didn't bother Adam the Actor. Good decision.\n\nSomeone was always doing bad things to someone else in the city, and the Police Station One was always busy.\n\nIn those times, if you were a child growing up in the North part of the city, it was difficult not to want to be like the bad guys. They had fancy cars, nice clothes, pretty girls, and lots of money. Some of them were not nice, but they looked cool to us who didn't have what they had. Lots of kids in our area talked, dressed, and walked like these cool people, but it was usually just for fun. Sometimes a good kid would become bad, and the only way he would come back was not alive.\n\nThere were a few kids in our area that didn't want to be like these people. They didn't act like the cool people and didn't want to be like them. Most of these kids spent time at the Our Place (OP) located at the Big School. A person from our area named Frank was different from the cool people and helped start the OP to keep the kids out of trouble. During my first year as a policeman, Frank convinced me to teach boxing to the boys at the OP. I met some great kids during my time as a boxing teacher.\n\nMy favorite kid at the OP was a tall, seventeen-year-old boy named Tom. His name was Tom, but everyone called him Tom because of his love for basketball, the IT country, two-time all-star player from a famous college who was also a member of the Big City basketball team of the late 20th century. His mother, Alice, called him Adam. His father, Gabriel, and his brother, Ryan, called him Adam. To everyone else he was Thomas. I called him \"little one\" sometimes even though he was only four years younger than me. I tried to teach Thomas how to play a fighting game, but he didn't care. He was strictly a basketball player; he once said sorry to me for his lack of interest in the fighting game. Thomas was such a nice boy that even the grown-ups liked him. He knew who they were, and they knew who he was, but they never bothered each other. Right after school, Thomas got a job with the city. \"I got no time for extra school, Ethan,\" he told me. \"I need to make money to help my family.\" I agreed with him. I hadn't gone to extra school, either. While I was chasing bad and not-so-bad people, Thomas was working his way up the job ladder. He was a guest at the small wedding Penelope and I had at city hall in front of a city official. Neither Penelope's parents nor my parents attended the ceremony because of the different beliefs.\n\nThe grown-ups joked with Thomas and me in the streets of the NE city, and I normally joked back. It was my nature. Thomas was more careful with the grown-ups, because he knew them better than I did.\n\n\"Hey, Thomas, I got a ticket. Can you help?\"\n\n\"Sorry, I can't.\"\n\n\"Hey, Patrick, you know the ticket people. Help me.\"\n\n\"I haven't gotten you in trouble in three weeks,\" I would joke.\n\nI laughed with the funny guys. I thought it helped us get along, but I was never sure. We were okay with each other, even though we didn't trust each other.\n\nAround the time that Ryan and Cameron had a fight with David of the M group and took their place, I had become a detective. I was always in the middle of things, maybe taking risks I shouldn't have. I had some fights, and some people fought me. I got hurt twice. I got four awards for being brave, some other awards, promotions, and people knew who I was. I was one of the most awarded policemen in B city from a long time ago to not so long ago. The local newspaper people said I was brave, and I guess I was. I don't know why but I never worried about myself. The first time I got hurt, I remember lying on the ground worrying about what would happen to Penelope if something happened to me.\n\nI was a B city policeman for a lot of years until I had to stop working because I was not well. I was still strong and healthy, but my hands and knees were hurting a lot. I had hurt my hands because of many boxing games, and age had caused the rest of the pain. My sore knees happened when a bad man hit me with a big stick in 1986. I had caught him doing wrong things in a snowy parking lot of a restaurant. He took the stick out of his car when he saw that I was a policeman.\n\n\"Why do you have a stick, silly?\" I asked him. \"Do you think you're Big Baseball Benjamin?\"\n\n\"Who is Big Baseball Benjamin?\"\n\n_Who is Big Baseball Benjamin?_ How could anyone not know him? Then I remembered that Benjamin had been in jail for a long time since the late 20th century for doing very bad things in the late 1960s. This bad man with the stick was probably very young at that time. Benjamin was one of the dangerous people in those days, and he was known for hurting people with a baseball bat. He was called \"Big Baseball\" because he was very good at baseball. Benjamin had a chance to play in the big games at one point. When he didn't make it, he stopped playing but always kept his bat. Benjamin was very tall with a lot of dark hair. He was a nice, quiet, friendly boy with a strong body. Some said he did bad things. I was glad I helped stop him, but I was always confused about the different parts of Big League Lowenstein's personality.\n\n\"Please put the stick down, silly,\" I said to the confused boy.\n\n\"No way.\"\n\nBang! I saw red dots everywhere. This silly, confused, good-for-nothing boy! GO! The silly boy slipped on the snow trying to run away from me and fell on one knee. I didn't see that coming. I saw the boy swing the stick at my legs from his kneeling position. Swing, swing, swing! He got up as I fell down. He lifted the stick over his head ready to hit me. Without thinking, I defended myself. I tried to hit him and made him yell in pain before he fell down to his knees in front of me. We knelt there in the snow, looking at each other in pain. Finally, I had enough strength to push him onto his back and crawled onto his chest.\n\n\"You silly boy,\" I said, barely able to see through the red dots.\n\nIn the process of making this confused boy understand, I hurt two fingers in each hand again. I got a prize for catching a bad person. My knees and hands were hurt and later had a painful sickness.\n\nThe Cats won their big game that same year, winning many games at the home court and losing only one. A little while before my knee got hurt, I watched one of those wins with a ticket that Tim gave me. I don't remember a lot about the game, but I do remember an old man sitting sadly next to me in a big room. He was friendly at first, but by the second part of the game, he was not so nice even though the Cats were winning a lot.\n\n\"Things are different now,\" he said a few times before making a smelly noise. He was bothering everyone, and I tried to not pay attention to him. Before the middle of the game, he went to get drinks for the third time. When he came back with a drink in each hand, he said loudly and proudly, \"Look!!! The Cats are the only team that can still have five people who look like me at the same time and win.\" He made another smelly noise. I held my breath and looked to see if he was right. Sure enough, Larry, Kevin, Bill, Jerry, and Scott were all like him and all playing for the Cats. \"Take a good look, my friend.\" The silly man pointed at the playground as he poked me with his arm. \" 'Cause you're never going to see something like this again.\" He tried to sound wise, but another funny noise from his tummy made him look silly, and then he had an accident.\n\nAs time passed, the details of that playtime faded. But I'll always remember that sad little man who was so worried about things changing that he had an accident and didn't even realize it.\n\nMy health and the health of the BR team got worse after that winning season. We slowly started doing worse and it couldn't be stopped. With no more winning years coming, Larry, now named Liam, and the other stars who were not as good as before decided to stop playing. I stopped playing too but nobody really noticed.\n\nI had become a slow person to the BP department by the time I stopped working in a year long ago on an annual gift of lots of money. I was an old man with no job and the future was as bright as a moth around a bright light.\n\nMy wife, Patty, now named Penelope, had a brain problem when we were both middle-aged. She woke up in the middle of the night with a headache. She turned on the lamp, got out of bed, held her head with both hands, and with a look of surprise said, \"Oh, Ethan.\" The doctors said she was gone before she fell on the floor. One moment, Penelope was my best friend. Then, her light went out. I was very sad. The best days of my life were when I was with Penelope. We couldn't have kids, but having each other was enough. We just didn't have enough time together.\n\nMy parents didn't like Penelope because she was from a different belief. Her parents didn't like me because I was from a different belief too. Her parents didn't get along with my parents, and my parents didn't get along with her parents. Neither family practiced their belief properly. They didn't like each other's beliefs instead. They spent a lot of time not liking each other until they had no more time.\n\nI was sad for two years after Penelope left and didn't see much of Mr. Jack. One morning, he came by unexpectedly.\n\n_We both liked her too, but we must keep going_, he said.\n\n_Penelope was the only lady we ever knew._\n\n_It's time we moved on, friend,_ he told me. _But I can't do it without you._\n\n_We're not always together,_ I said.\n\n_We often are,_ he said.\n\n_Okay, I'll try, but I don't feel like it._\n\n_We don't need you to feel like it. Just come along and we'll be okay,_ he promised. I started making friends with other girls. Patricia and I had a good time together, but it was seldom surprising or different. I never thought anything was missing until I began meeting other girls after she left. Being with Patricia had been warm and comforting. Being with someone else was different. It was fun and exciting, and my friend Jack went crazy. For the first time in my life, I realized I could like someone besides Patricia and something besides being a policeman. I liked having fun, and I liked girls. I liked daring girls. I liked quiet girls. I liked all kinds of girls. I liked the way girls looked, and I liked the way they smelled. I liked the happy feelings I felt when I was attracted to someone new. I even liked the playing and the chase. I was not tall, dark, and handsome, but there were many girls who seemed to find me nice. I was small, but I was fit, and I knew I wasn't bad looking. I was known because of the way I did my job, and I think the excitement of my job was attractive to some girls. I also had my friend Jack, who was a big guy to be with a small guy like me, and he was always ready to stand up for me.\n\nI had many girls in my life after Patricia left, but I never had one special girl. My things usually ended nicely when it was clear that the friendship was over. I didn't \"like 'em and leave 'em\" like some boys. I liked 'em and let them leave me.\n\n\"Ethan, I'm grown-up, and I need to think about my future.\"\n\n\"Ethan, I'm older, and I need to be serious. Everything is fun with you.\"\n\n\"Ethan, I'm very old. I need to stay for a long time.\"\n\nSometimes it was sad for me to let a girl leave, but I knew it would be sadder to ask her to stay. After Penelope's head hurt badly in the middle of the night, I could no longer think far ahead. When I was younger, I thought a lot. But when Penelope left me, I remembered one of my Grandma Grace's favorite sayings. \"People think and God laughs.\" Well, God would have to laugh at someone else for a change.\n\nDuring happy and sad times, Thomas was always there for me. He was there when I started as a young policeman. He was there when I married Penelope and he was there when I said goodbye to her many years later. He was with me when I stopped working early. When I stopped, Thomas was the helper at the Marblehead Place. He was sad with my choice to stop early.\n\n\"Why didn't you take the job they offered you?\"\n\n\"I can't sit all day. You know that.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know, strong man,\" he said, moving his head. \"You're not happy unless you're stopping a bad person in the street or getting hurt.\"\n\n\"I've never been hurt,\" I said in my defense.\n\n\"That's because you never ran from anything.\" Thomas made a sad face. \"So what are you going to do now?\"\n\n\"Honestly, I don't know. I have nothing and no one.\"\n\n\"What about all your friends?\"\n\n\"Like I said, I have nothing and no one.\"\n\n\"You have me,\" he said, looking at me and touching my hand.\n\nAnd that's when I became the \"official\" boxing teacher of the NE club. I had my policeman's money and a job I liked. It wasn't a bad life, but I can't say I was happy. I had lost too much.\n\n## CHAPTER 4\n\nCOLD ROCKS\n\nWinters were tough for me. One early morning in a year in the early 21st century, I was in so much pain walking to the North B Place to give boxing lessons that I almost fell on H Street. I walked into the school's small, hot gym, known as the \"warm room,\" and went to the heater in the corner. I sat on a wooden chair and got as close to the old heater as I could. Thomas came and saw me by the heater. I looked up and saw him coming toward me. He had a warm coat. Neat.\n\n\"Edwin. You don't look good.\"\n\n\"My hands and knees hurt. I don't like this cold weather.\"\n\nThomas nodded as he sat down next to me, like he was going to tell me something. There was a loud noise before he could talk. The gym door opened, and two of Thomas's friends came in--Patrick was Thomas's best friend. He had dark skin, brown eyes, was not very tall and had short, black hair. Patrick was followed by a kid they called Strong, who was very tall, very good-looking, and very big. Ben was a big guy and the best at sports in the neighborhood. But Ben wasn't very smart, although he wasn't really dumb, either. They waved to us from the other side of the gym.\n\n\"We have a meeting,\" Thomas told me.\n\n\"Muscles is on the sign?\"\n\nThomas giggled, \"Why not?\"\n\nThe sign friends said hello to us and \"HOW are you? How ARE you? How are YOU?\" rang out in the big room. The door opened again, and two more sign friends came in. Tall Tim \"Rats\" was followed by a small, strong-looking Ryan \"The Doctor\". Ryan was called \"The Doctor\" because when he was a kid he once said he wanted to be a doctor. He never said it again but he kept the name forever.\n\n_How ARE you?_s filled the big room again. Hugs, pats on the back, and noogies (those annoying little hits to the shoulder or head) were exchanged. I watched them with wishfulness. These guys were part of a special group I could never join.\n\nThey had grown up near the Old Big Church and Peter's house. Their parents from other lands had learned to speak English together at the NE Union, and they had learned a job at the NE Job School, the oldest job school in the country. The boys were raised in homes that had no warm water or tubs. In the old days and early years they had gone once a week with their dads to the NE Bath House, where they could get a soap, a towel, and a warm shower for a penny. Their dads had played cards together in places like CT club, where the favorite game was Boss and Underboss even though the players weren't necessarily part of a group of bad guys.\n\nThe boys had played a ball game together at the SP park during the summer, spring, and fall. They played football in the GC League, named after a famous player from the BP team. Then they played baseball in the SF League, followed by LL, and finally the YC League (named after the NY team's center fielder, Jack). NE was a place full of RS fans but Jack was the best player in the game and he was IT country. Family was more important than local team loyalty for these guys. They played their games at the NE Park on CS by the CR and they met often at the CC Youth Center.\n\nStreets, districts, and areas determined their neighborhood team. There was the Clinic team, the NB Street team, the NS District guys, and the HS boys. These areas competed with each other in local sporting events, but when it was time to represent the entire NE they became one community. These young men had smelled the same smells in their youth: SR, PR, Louis, LC, and the European. They knew everyone who hung around Pat's Scratches, tough guys like Liam and Jack. Ryan and his friends watched from a safe distance, as they knew Adam was not a nice man, and when Benjamin visited from the east city, they gave him plenty of room. David's group had become close friends, linked together by their shared childhood in the north part of the city. I knew I could be friends with them, but I could never really be part of their group.\n\n\"Hey, Henry! Hey, silly,\" Thomas shouted at Henry. \"I got a point on you pretty well yesterday, didn't I? You couldn't stop me.\"\n\n\"You're so tall, Thomas,\" Henry responded. \"Big deal. If you were my size you couldn't do anything.\"\n\n\"Oh yeah. Oh yeah.\" Thomas sounded like a little boy. \"I could get a point on a tall player if I wanted to.\"\n\nHenry looked a little upset. \"The tall player isn't here anymore, you silly. Of course you can get a point on him.\"\n\nThomas looked confused. All he could say was, \"Oh yeah? Oh yeah? Oh yeah? So?\"\n\n\"Why don't you stop teasing him?\" David said calmly.\n\n\"It's too much fun.\"\n\n\"Having fun now?\" David asked.\n\n\"Yeah, that's right. \"Are you having fun now?\" Adam asked, making a fist and shaking it at Isaac. Adam turned to me. \"Coach Ethan,\" he called me. \"You look unwell. What's wrong?\"\n\nI gave my best smile. \"I have aches. They hurt a lot when it's cold.\"\n\n\"You should go where it's warm then,\" Adam suggested. \"Like Matthew did.\"\n\n\"Matthew?\" Patrick asked.\n\n\"Yes, Matthew. Remember him? I saw him during holiday time.\"\n\n\"That was just recently, silly,\" the Doctor said, giving a gentle tap on the big man's shoulder.\n\n\"I know that.\" Adam rubbed the tap with his hand. It was a common act.\n\n\"If he was here how come he didn't come by to see us?\" Patrick wondered.\n\n\"Why didn't he come to see us?\" Thomas laughed. \"You know why, Patrick. We all know why. We used to tease him all the time, because all he wanted to do was hit little round toys.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Adam agreed. \"You guys were always teasing Matthew. Like when we were all playing in the park and he'd be out in the field hitting little round toys and causing trouble. He must have hit so many of those small balls. I remember some went so far they landed in the nearby river.\"\n\n\"So where is he now, Matthew?\" Tom seemed interested.\n\n\"He told me he's a ball game teacher somewhere where it's sunny all the time,\" Matthew announced proudly. He knew something the other kids didn't know. That didn't happen often.\n\n\"A ball game teacher,\" Peter said, shaking his head. \"That makes sense. Mikey teaching other kids how to hit small balls.\"\n\n\"Did he tell you where he is exactly?\" Tom asked.\n\nMatthew scratched his big head. \"Yeah, but I don't remember. I think he said he's in a place called 'FL country'.\"\n\n\"That's a big place, Matthew,\" Isaac teased.\n\n\"Oh yeah. Oh yeah,\" Matthew responded. \"Well at least I know something. You don't know anything.\"\n\n\"Can you kids stop it?\" Tom held up a hand. They stopped. \"Matthew, I need you to think really hard.\"\n\n\"He can't even think a little,\" the Doctor started again.\n\nTom gave Isaac a tired look. The Doctor held up his hands. Tom turned his attention to Matthew. \"Try to remember exactly what Mikey told you.\"\n\nMatthew closed his eyes tight. \"Okay, okay.\" He squeezed his hands and thought really hard. He smiled and opened his eyes. \"He teaches a game in a sunny place. At a place that has two names.\"\n\n\"WE city?\" Patrick asked.\n\n\"No, it has two different names,\" Matthew said.\n\n\"Different names?\" the Doctor sighed. \"Those names didn't come from that sunny place. What are you saying?\"\n\n\"Maybe they are SP names,\" Thomas tried. \"Could they be SP names?\"\n\n\"Sorry, Thomas.\" Matthew looked sad. \"I don't know the difference.\"\n\nThomas patted him on the shoulder. \"That's okay, Matthew. You did well.\"\n\n\"Let's go, guys,\" Ryan \"The Doctor\" said. \"We have a meeting to do here. Why are you wasting so much time on Mikey anyway?\"\n\n\"I was thinking,\" Thomas explained. \"If we could find Mikey, maybe he could find some work for Ethan in the warm place.\"\n\nThat surprised me. \"Hey, don't worry about me,\" I said. \"I can look after myself.\"\n\n\"Of course you can,\" Thomas said. \"But why should you be sad half the year? \"You're almost old, Ethan. You can't do much more of this hard work.\"\n\n\"I'm happy here.\"\n\n\"I see that,\" Thomas said with a funny voice, pointing at my spot near the heater.\n\n\"Also I have this work and the children I teach here. I don't know anyone in the FR country.\"\n\n\"You'll meet friends,\" Thomas said firmly, shaking his head. \"I don't like to see you hurt, Ethan.\"\n\nThe rest of them nodded their heads.\n\nThen, all of a sudden--\"BR city! BR city!\" Matthew yelled.\n\n\"Quiet down, Samuel,\" the Doctor shouted back. \"And what's BR city?\"\n\n\"That's where Michael lives!\" shouted happy Matthew.\n\n\"That's in the South of the FR country.\" Thomas nodded. \"Between PB city and FL city. My brother and sister have a winter home there.\"\n\n\"Yeah, Samuel. The kind man with the toy fish,\" Ryan remembered.\n\nI looked at Thomas and said, \"This is a nice idea, friends, but I'm staying right here. I love BO city.\"\n\n\"BO city don't like you no more,\" Patrick said. \"At least not in the cold. You're hurt, Ethan. \"You shouldn't be cold,\" I said.\n\n\"I'm fine,\" I replied.\n\n\"Why are you holding your knees?\" Petey asked. \"You don't look well, Eddie. Admit it. Your hands look like you're holding marbles.\"\n\n\"This is home,\" I said. \"I don't want to go to a strange place in FL country.\"\n\nTO city was upset with me. \"You know,\" he said, \"Muscles almost forgets everything, but he remembered this for you. It's important.\"\n\nMuscles walked over to TO city and hugged him. TO city hugged him back.\n\n\"I remembered well, didn't I, TO city?\"\n\n\"You did very well, Muscles,\" TO city agreed.\n\nMuscles let go of TO city. He walked towards me with his arms open. I usually don't hug guys, but I couldn't say no to a hug from friendly Bruno Muscles. \"Alright, alright,\" I said, patting Muscles on the back. \"I'll think about it.\"\n\n\"Good job, Coach Eddie,\" Bruno said.\n\n\"Smart decision,\" TO city said.\n\nSomeone playfully messed up my hair.\n\n## CHAPTER 5\n\nLOOK AT BOCA\n\nThe big boss opened the doors of his waiting room and the leaders of the Tribe saw it was good. \"They said, 'This is our home!' and they didn't wander anymore.\"\n\n--A BOOK, CHAPTER 500, VERSE 30000\n\nI felt like I was in a different place. Everything at PA airport looked odd to me when I stepped off the plane from BE city. I hadn't been away from NE region since my class took a train trip to WA city when I was younger.\n\nThe people waiting looked like a group of old folks. They were mostly small people with dark, wrinkled skin, white hair, and white teeth. Many had on shorts, simple shirts, and shoes. I saw TO city's brother-in-law, Thomas, waving to me. He was easy to see. He didn't have white hair, he wasn't wearing shorts, and he wasn't short. He was a tall man, taller than most people; Thomas was a good businessman who had been spending winters in BO city for many years. We said hello with a big hug, and as I had no bags, we went straight to the car park. Thomas was driving a big car. He kept the roof up as we drove fast on a big road. In a short time, we were in BO city, at a place to play golf. Samuel walked me to the teacher's office where he introduced me to Matthew and told me he would wait for me outside.\n\nWithin a short time, I was offered a job I didn't think I wanted by a man who was certain I wasn't qualified, in a place I wasn't sure I wanted to be. I accepted the offer.\n\n\"I don't know why I'm offering you this job,\" Matthew told me honestly. \"You know nothing about teaching or schools.\" Matthew was a strong, sporty-looking guy with a full head of black hair. I could see him fitting right in on the streets of the NE city, except he had never really fit in there at all.\n\n\"Family favor,\" I said. \"I'm part of Thomas's big family.\"\n\n\"You and a lot of other guys,\" Matthew said. \"Thomas was a trouble when I lived in the NE city. Him and his friends never left me alone.\"\n\n\"Well I appreciate you helping me out,\" I said, patting him on the shoulder. \"I guess NE city connections run pretty deep no matter what.\"\n\n\"Yeah, they do,\" Matthew said. \"Plus your reputation as a helper in the NE city was pretty impressive. I figure I owe something to a guy like you.\"\n\n\"You don't owe me anything, Matthew. \"I just did what I was supposed to do.\"\n\n\"You did great,\" said Mike. He picked a book called _How to Play Golf_ from a shelf in his room. He gave it to me. \"Try to learn something before you come back,\" he told me as we walked towards Sam's car. \"I'll mostly need you for safety, but you might have to do some things related to golf.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, Mike. I won't make you feel bad.\"\n\n\"I know,\" was all he said.\n\nI looked at the golf field and the big building. \"Everything looks so new,\" I said.\n\n\"It is new. This big building just opened and this field has been completely changed. The One Club did the same thing a while ago.\"\n\n\"There are two different clubs?\"\n\n\"That's another story,\" he laughed. \"And we don't have time for that now.\"\n\n\"Who pays for all these changes?\"\n\n\"The members.\"\n\n\"They don't mind?\"\n\n\"Of course they mind. You'll hear all about it when you come here all the time,\" he said with a laugh. \"It's something everyone talks about. All you have to do is listen.\"\n\nI looked around again. \"Mike, I haven't seen this much green since the big green field. It's amazing.\"\n\n\"I hate to say it, Ethan, but you stop noticing it after some time.\"\n\n\"That's not happy.\"\n\nWe said hello by touching hands. \"Thank you, Matthew,\" I said. \"Also, where is the high place?\"\n\n\"What high place?\"\n\n\"The high place,\" I said. \"You know, like in the BO city.\"\n\n\"There are no high places.\"\n\n\"Then why is it called BO city?\"\n\n\"Don't think too much about the community names here,\" Matthew said while laughing a bit. \"There's no point at BO Point as far as I know and BO West is east of BO Isle, which isn't even close to an island. Broken Sound, just a little further on YA Road, isn't broken as far as I know and I can't hear a sound. Can you? BO Vista doesn't have a better view than BO Green, which isn't any greener than SA, which isn't a church. You can't hunt at the Woodfield Hunt Club and I don't know what's up with BO Teeca. LL has a lake but then again so does BO Lago. I don't know, I come from a place where the North End is in the north end.\"\n\n\"No you don't,\" I disagreed.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"The North End is east of the West End and southwest of East Boston,\" I told him. \"Remember, I have a good memory of the neighborhoods and streets. There's no school on School Street and no church on Church Street. There's no court on Court Street and no water on Water Street. And the big pond was filled in years ago.\"\n\n\"Thanks for showing me around.\" Matthew laughed.\n\n\"You're welcome,\" I said. \"So, are all the secure places similar here in the BR town?\" I asked.\n\n\"For the most part,\" Matthew said. \"Some cost more than others. Some have better play areas than others. But, yeah, I'd say they all give about the same basic things. It's a nice way of living for many people.\"\n\n\"It looks great,\" I said.\n\n\"Great it isn't,\" Matthew said, shaking his head. \"These places have lots of issues.\"\n\n\"Like what?\"\n\n\"When the friends of a group take over the control from the person who made it, things usually go wrong,\" Matthew explained.\n\n\"What happens?\"\n\n\"The friend-owners can't seem to agree on how anything should be managed,\" Matthew said. \"We have big issues here at BR town.\"\n\n\"What kind of issues?\"\n\n\"First of all, like I told you, there are no hills.\" Matthew touched my shoulder in a funny way. \"Really, when the friends took over the control of BR town they got a bad situation. There were two types of golf group membership sold here. If new home owners wanted a club membership for playing golf, they could join just the One Course, for one price, or they had the option to join both the One Course and the Two Course for more money. Now, the One Course members are arguing with the Two Course members over who should pay for what.\"\n\n\"That sounds tough,\" I said.\n\n\"It's scary,\" Mike agreed. \"And BH isn't the only club having this kind of problem. Our friends at BS have the same problem with their two courses. BH and BS are very similar. They were both made by the same person at the same time. Other clubs have other problems. There's one big unhappy family of communities here in BO.\"\n\n\"Is it bad for me to be moving here?\" I asked.\n\n\"Not at all,\" Mike told me. \"BO is great. It's just not perfect.\"\n\n\"Like every other place,\" I said.\n\n\"No.\" Mike shook his head. \"BO is not like every other place. BO is special. You'll see.\"\n\nSam introduced me to a person who knew a lot about houses and the three of us looked at homes in the area. With their help and advice I was able to find a nice, affordable one-room home near BH. After I agreed to live there for one year, Sam took me to the BO History Place to get several papers about the city and its history. I took some count info and a few nature leaflets too. Going back to BE town with the top down and the sun making my face warm, I saw a big, yellow sign that read \"Memories.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" I asked Samuel.\n\n\"It's a new idea for life after we're gone,\" he said.\n\nI asked him to stop the car. He pulled off the road and parked near the dusty building site. The entrance was big and gated, and a few hundred feet away two large, fancy buildings faced each other. The place looked like a great city, and it wasn't going to be built in a short time. Samuel said there were two places in BE town like Memories. One was called the Garden.\n\n\"A place to rest forever?\" I pointed.\n\n\"You decide that,\" Samuel said. \"But why are you interested?\"\n\n\"My wife is not here anymore.\"\n\n\"I know. For a long time.\"\n\n\"I was thinking maybe I'd move her here.\"\n\n\"It's too warm here.\"\n\nI opened the door and got out of the car. \"Do you want to come with me?\" I asked.\n\n\"I'm not ready for this place. I'll wait in the car.\"\n\nI entered the gates of Memories alone.\n\nI was on a flying machine back to BO city that night. Matthew had given me two weeks to sort out my things and return to BE town. I sat in the middle seat on the big bird plane, happy I didn't need a lot of space for my legs. There was a large man on each side of me, and they were squeezed and grumpy. When the plane went up into the sky, I began to read the papers I had. After two hours of reading on the three-hour trip, I put the papers in the pocket in the front seat, pushed my seat back, closed my eyes, and tried to understand the BR town information in my own way. I didn't think about the old stories of the T people or the S people, but went straight to what matters today.\n\nThere were about ninety thousand people living in BR town. Maybe half of them were J people, which is a lot more than the usual number. On Y street, near BR port, there were six big churches and one S house standing next to each other. Sam called this place the God's school area.\n\nBR town, if we say it in English from SP country, means \"mouth of the rat,\" but it could mean other things too. I learned that the right way to say _Raton_ sounds like _tone_ and not _lawn._\n\nThe large man in the window seat next to me made a noise, moved in his small seat, and said something that sounded like \"bad plane,\" then went back to sleep. I turned on the small fan above my head and kept looking at the paper.\n\nLong time ago, a man named Henry came to a place called BR town with his train from another place called SA town. His train quickly went to MI city and KW town. The FR country gave Henry a lot of lands for every mile of train tracks he made from JA town to KW town. Henry's land company would then look at the land and sell it in small parts. In a year after that, a man from JA city named Jack came to BR town and bought a lot of lands from Henry to make a farm to grow fruits. He called his community Y( _yah-mah-toe_ ), which meant \"peaceful land,\" and other things. A man from JA city named George joined Jack's community in the same year but soon started his own business and made a lot of money in selling lands. George never married and didn't have any kids. He gave some of his lands to the town. That land became a museum on Y road. Unfortunately, Jack's fruit farm did not do as well as his land business. In a few years after that, the fruits, cared by only forty people, were destroyed by disease. By a later time, the farm was left behind.\n\n\"Please make sure your small table is put away and your chair is straight,\" the plane helper told us, and I did as told, which made the other two people in my row a bit unhappy. \"B\" city 101 would have to wait.\n\n## CHAPTER 6\n\nI DISLIKE LEAVING\n\n\"I'm moving to FL country, friend,\" I said looking down at Fiona's stone.\n\n**_Fiona --the late 20th century  \nLoved by all who knew her_.**\n\nIn the summer I would sit by her stone and talk to her for an hour or more. But there would not be a long visit today. It was a cold NE afternoon and I would have been very cold if I tried staying in that place for more than a few minutes.\n\n\"Can you imagine me living in fancy FL country?\" I asked her while warming my cold hands. I pictured her smile. \"Me neither. But that's where I'm going.\" I paused, out of habit, as if she were going to respond. \"You wouldn't believe that place, Fiona,\" I continued. \"I never saw anything like it in my life.\" I was being honest. \"They're building everywhere. Big houses, stores, malls, you name it. They're even building a place where people are remembered that's fancier than where some people live.\"\n\nI thought back to my visit to a place. It had surprised me when I saw it from the road while riding in Steve's car. I had never seen a graveyard so fancy and happy anywhere else, but Sam told me there were already two of them in BI town.\n\nI was walking around the dusty lot trying to get a feel for the project when I was approached by a nice-looking middle-aged man wearing a city baseball cap. I didn't think badly of him. Gray hair showed from the sides of the hat. I guessed he was my age. He was taller than me, but so were just about everyone else.\n\n\"Can I help you?\" He smiled.\n\n\"Just looking.\"\n\n\"Would you like some details about Memories?\"\n\n\"Sure. You work here?\"\n\n\"I'm one of the builders.\" He held out his hand. \"I'm Jack.\"\n\n\"Hi, Jack. I'm Ethan.\" I shook his hand. \"What's going on here? This place doesn't look like a graveyard to me.\"\n\n\"It's not supposed to look like a graveyard, Ethan.\" Jack started explaining. \"It's a new way in how to think about death.\"\n\n\"You learn something new every day.\"\n\n\"Are you thinking about your own rest here, Ethan?\"\n\n\"It's not on my list right now.\"\n\n\"I see. Are you thinking about resting a loved one?\"\n\n\"Yes. My wife.\"\n\n\"I see. \"Is she very sick?\"\n\n\"No. She's not alive anymore.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm sorry. For how long?\"\n\n\"Forever.\"\n\n\"No. I mean how long has she not been alive?\"\n\n\"Twenty years.\"\n\n\"And you're just getting around to burying her now?\"\n\n\"I don't like to rush things.\"\n\n\"Be serious.\"\n\n\"Okay. My wife is buried in a big cemetery in BO city. I'm thinking of moving her to here.\"\n\n\"I assume that's because you're moving to this place.\"\n\n\"Yes, while I'm alive.\"\n\n\"That's the best way to enjoy BE city.\"\n\n\"I'm sure. So, do you accept transfers?\"\n\n\"Not after their third year.\"\n\n\"Good one,\" I said. \"Now it's your turn to be serious.\"\n\n\"Fair enough. But to tell you the truth I don't have a special program for transfers. I'm sure we can work something out though.\"\n\n\"Can I get a before-building discount?\"\n\n\"We don't offer discounts at Memories.\"\n\n\"Then I doubt I can afford this place.\"\n\n\"Don't be so sure. We have something for everyone here.\"\n\n\"Really? Then I'm excited to know more.\"\n\n\"That won't be necessary.\"\n\n\"We both have to get serious.\"\n\nHe nodded. We walked the area. There were two big buildings being built. Jack talked and pointed while I listened with my hands in my pockets, holding my money. It wasn't long before I was hearing lots of numbers. Jack told me the project would take a few more years to finish and would cost a lot of money. When it's finished, the place would be able to hold over two hundred thousand people, making it the biggest and quietest walled community in BC city. There would be up to 135,000 full bodies put to rest and around 100,000 ashes.\n\n\"How much?\" I asked.\n\n\"You can start as low as a lot of money for a single place to put ashes.\"\n\n\"Too late for ashes. My wife was a full-body situation originally. But I'm not sure how full her body is at this point. Maybe it would fit in a small space.\"\n\n\"No. Her box will still be full size, which will need a big space.\"\n\n\"What about just a regular burial?\"\n\n\"There will be no in-ground burials at Memories.\"\n\n\"Seems like a waste of a lot of good underground.\"\n\n\"We're building a big building city here, Eddie, not a cemetery. The buildings will be amazing; all in a cool, museum-style setting.\"\n\n\"No offense, Jack, but do you think people who are no longer alive really care about being cool?\"\n\n\"That's not the point, Ethan. Memories is going to be a place where people can be happy remembering the ones who are not with us anymore. It won't be sad like old places where we remember people. We will have a library of stories about the people who are remembered here. We will have groups where people who miss someone can talk. We're making everything to help people celebrate the ones they miss.\"\n\n\"Sounds like my kind of party.\"\n\n\"You said we were going to be serious.\"\n\n\"I slipped. Any questions about different beliefs?\"\n\n\"None at all. People with different beliefs will be able to visit their missed ones in a place full of peace, love, and respect. We're building a special place for some people right over there.\" Jack pointed at some trees. \"It will be made completely of a special type of rock from a famous place.\"\n\n\"You're joking. That famous place has its own place to get rock?\"\n\n\"Absolutely. Other modern places to remember people are using the same rock as well. It's very popular.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I heard this place was like another place in a city,\" I said.\n\n\"We are not alone but we are unique,\" Jack said. \"The special place will also have thick wooden doors.\"\n\n\"From the famous place's forest?\"\n\n\"That famous place doesn't have a forest.\"\n\n\"So, why the wooden doors?\"\n\n\"Wooden doors can be used for a very long time.\"\n\n\"That should make the Christian people feel better. But what about Jewish people?\"\n\n\"Benjamin--!\"\n\n\"Bless you.\"\n\n\"Thank you. But I wasn't done. _Benjamin Charlie_ means 'Blessing of Life',\" Jack tried. \"It's the name we've chosen for the Jewish big building, which will be a beautiful building. It will even have a copy of a famous wall inside.\"\n\n\"Hey, what about a bush on fire?\"\n\n\"We can't do that.\"\n\n\"So, doing something like the Red Sea parting is probably not possible, too?\"\n\n\"Getting insurance against floods in FL country? Be serious.\"\n\n\"That's sad. Can this place make money, Jack?\"\n\n\"Not in my life, but many years from now Memories will be very profitable.\"\n\n\"So why are you doing this?\"\n\n\"To make a difference. I want to change the way we all think about not being alive.\"\n\n\"You're serious?\"\n\n\"Very serious.\"\n\n\"That's fitting. Is there anything else I should know?\"\n\n\"Would you like to see one of our lists?\"\n\n\"Lists?\"\n\n\"Yes. We have different lists for parties and music events.\"\n\n\"Music events? By who? A famous band?\"\n\n\"I wish I had thought of that.\"\n\n\"Last question, Jack. \"How much for a full-body move?\" \n\n\"I can offer you a nice underground room for seven thousand dollars.\"\n\n\"I'd rather have a big screen and a game table.\"\n\n\"Life is all about choices, Ethan.\"\n\n\"And so is sleep, apparently,\" I noted. \"So, what do rich sleepy people buy?\n\n\"Super Rooms are very popular with our wealthier clients. We place the sleeping couple side by side on a platform in the room.\"\n\n\"I guess they're both sleeping at the time.\"\n\n\"Not necessarily. We'll start with one and add the other when the time comes. They can also include pets in their room.\"\n\n\"What about changes?\"\n\n\"For instance?\"\n\n\"Well, let's say the wife sleeps and the husband lives a few more years and marries a dance showgirl. What then? Or, let's say the wife doesn't sleep and the guy is with a dance showgirl anyway. Can he change a friend for a certain number of dogs or cats?\"\n\n\"That's another interesting idea.\"\n\n\"I'm always thinking. So, what's the cost of a Super Room?\"\n\n\"A Super Room,\" he corrected me. \"Give or take a few extras--four hundred thousand dollars.\"\n\n\"Does that include a ground pool?\"\n\n\"Ethan, you should know better.\"\n\n\"That's right. I forgot. Nothing in-ground at Memories.\"\n\n\"Exactly. Should I add your name?\"\n\n\"I need to ask my wife when I see her.\"\n\nA cold wind from the ME train blew up my pant legs making me very cold, reminding me of the cold now.\n\n\"Penelope, I need to leave before I become one of these statues.\" There were angel statues all over in the place.\n\nNext, I visited the places where my parents and grandparents were laid to rest in the JE place a little distance away. I put a few small stones on their headstones because I knew it was the right thing to do. I read my grandfather's headstone, which was actually the second monument put over his resting place since he passed away. I had replaced the original headstone many years after he passed away because of a letter he had written a very long time ago.\n\nMy mother passed away from a sickness in the early 80s when she was not that old. My father passed away a few years after. He had a habit that was not good for him. After my father's last ceremony, I went to their house in BR town to clean it out. In the basement I found a small box covered with dust with a very old, rusted lock that I broke off easily with a tool I found in my father's old toolbox. I opened the box, and the first thing I saw was a sealed envelope addressed to my father from my grandfather. The letter was closed with an old-fashioned wax mark, and the mark had never been broken. I wondered why Harry had chosen not to read his father's note or if he had ever opened the big box at all. Maybe he didn't want to know more about being the first child of his family born in this country, with parents who had moved here from a faraway land. He had tried hard to forget his simple beginnings, and maybe he didn't want any reminders.\n\nWithout waiting, I broke the mark of the letter and took out a big stack of fragile papers. But the problem was, the letter was written in different languages, just like how my grandpa talked. I couldn't understand what he was trying to tell my father in the letter, and I was upset. I put the papers back into the letter and looked through the stuff in the box. I found a fancy knife in a cover about the length of a ruler. I held the short knife in my hand. It felt good and known in my hold. I could feel there was something special about this knife and was sure that the secret to its meaning could be found in my grandpa's letter. I put the knife back into the long box and put the letter in my pocket.\n\n## CHAPTER 7\n\nTHE _S_ IN EDWARD\n\nI was happy about my note from the past. I drove to the big church, the traditional religious place in a place called BR town. I knew just where it was on Benjamin Street, though I had never been inside the building. I found the teacher in his sunny, messy room. He was a small man with a long, full, grey beard who seemed to be quite old. Dressed in black he looked to be a very serious person. I introduced myself to Teacher Henry and told him why I was there. I put the letter and toy on his desk. First, Teacher Henry looked at the toy. He did not remove it from the case. \"This is a toy,\" Teacher Henry said with displeasure. \"It was a toy used by the cowboys a long time ago. Toys frightened many people. Why would your grandpa have such a toy?\" I told Teacher Henry that I had no idea why this toy had been with my grandpa and I suggested that the letter might tell us why. Teacher Henry opened the letter and took out the papers carefully and respectfully. He put on reading glasses and looked at the writing as he turned the pages. Then he looked at me and shook his head. \"I'm embarrassed,\" he said, \"but I can't read this. Your grandpa uses different languages like they were all the same. I can understand a lot of the words, but the actual meaning is not clear to me.\"\n\n\"Can you try?\" I asked hopefully.\n\n\"I can do better than that,\" said David, and got up from his big chair. \"Follow me, please.\"\n\nWe went down into the bottom of the building. David knocked on a big wooden door, and I heard a strange voice respond. David opened the door, and we walked in. It felt like we had gone back in time. Everything in the dim room was old, including a little old man who sat behind a desk with open books in front of him. His glasses were very thick, and he had to squint to see me. \"David, this boy would like you to read a letter for him.\"\n\nWithout asking a question the white-bearded old man motioned for me to come forward and held out his hand. I gave him the letter. He spread it on the desk in front of him and leaned over so his face was very close to the paper. He turned a knob on the lamp to make the light brighter without taking his eyes from the letter. After a few moments he looked up at us with surprise. \" _I know this person_ \" The old man's voice was barely audible.\n\nI looked to David for an explanation.\n\n\"David says he knows this man.\"\n\n\"That's impossible,\" I told him. \"The person who wrote this note was born a long time ago and passed away in the late 20th century.\"\n\n\"Rabbi Ryan is very old,\" the young rabbi shared. \"He is almost a hundred years old and was born in RU country.\"\n\nI thought about it. Rabbi Ryan might have met my grandpa, but it seemed unlikely. \"Ask him why he believes he knows this man.\" I heard their conversation and saw that the old rabbi was upset.\n\n\"I know _of_ this man!\" Rabbi Ryan told Rabbi Henry.\n\nRabbi Henry held up his hands in front of his chest, palms out. \"Calm down,\" he told the older man in a kind way. Rabbi Henry turned to me. \"I'm sorry,\" he said. \"I misunderstood his words. Rabbi Ryan actually said, 'I know _of_ this man.' He didn't say he really knew him.\"\n\n\"Why would he know of my grandpa?\" I wondered.\n\n\"He was famous,\" the old man answered.\n\n\"The rabbi says this man was very popular,\" the young rabbi explained; he listened to the old man again. \"He says this man was famous.\"\n\n\"Famous,\" I said. \"Did my grandpa do something special?\" \n\nThe old teacher talked really fast. I couldn't understand him. Teacher Henry explained.\n\n\"The teacher is not sure if this man was real. He thought it might just be a story his mom told at bedtime.\"\n\nThe old teacher kept talking fast and loud. The younger teacher tried to keep up.\n\n\"Teacher Ryan says your grandpa was a hero.\"\n\n\"Is he sure?\" I asked. \"My grandpa's name was Henry Patrick. Is that who the teacher means?\"\n\nThey talked quickly. \"The teacher says your grandpa's real name wasn't Henry Patrick. He says he had a name from a different country. It's in his letter.\"\n\nI was really excited. \"What was his other name?\"\n\nThe old teacher said a word that sounded like _Zee-rota._\n\n\"The teacher said your grandpa was called Zachary. It means 'the kid with no parents'.\"\n\n\"He says your grandpa fought a big furry animal in a far away country with a sword when he was a little older than you.\"\n\nI sat in a chair near the teacher's desk. I was hot and felt strange because I learned so many new things really fast. My grandpa once beat a big animal with a pointy stick when he was a young boy. It was hard for me to believe, even though I remembered two men getting hurt at the zoo a long time ago.\n\n\"Rabbi Ryan asked if you would like him to read out your grandpa's whole letter?\"\n\nI could only nod and listen.\n\nMy grandpa wrote about a sad childhood where he lived with people who never liked him. He wrote about getting hurt by some of the old people in the town of VI town and by one mean boy who called him a bad name. He became lonely and unhappy. One day, my grandpa wrote, he got so upset that he stood up to the mean boy. He fought back so hard that he almost hurt the boy really bad. This scared the people of VI town and they didn't want to be with him after that. He became alone in the town. He lived in a small house away from everyone else and didn't try to make friends. He told himself that he didn't care about them. He decided he would leave the town one day when the time was right. Then a big animal came.\n\n> > _One cold day a hungry big animal was making loud noises in the streets of our town looking for food. The people ran away scared but the rabbi's little girl fell in front of the big animal. \"Who will help us?\" Years later, the girl I saved from a bear would be my wife.\n\n\"That was my grandma,\" I said, thinking of her kind smile and yummy cookies. Then I remembered my grandpa's words about a bear the night I won against Gabriel in my last boxing match. \"You beat a bear, Adam. Just like me.\" Now, after so long, I knew what he meant.\n\nTears filled my eyes as the old teacher kept reading my grandpa's words.\n\n> > _I lived in the forest, catching and eating small animals. I knew how to start a fire. I drank melted snow. From people I met, I learned that boats left for AM country from HA city in GE country. I heard that AM country had lots of good things. I wanted to go to AM country, but I didn't know where it was or how to get there. In a small street in HA city, I saw two boys hurting another boy. I wanted to help. Holding my knife high, I shouted at the boys. I must have looked scary, because the two boys ran away. When I went to the hurt boy, I knew right away he was very sick. Blood sprayed from the hurt and splashed on me and the big fur. The boy gasped and was gone. I kept crying as I took off the red fur from the boy and removed his clothes. I put them on, replacing the old clothes that had been on me for months. I wrapped the boy's bare body in the big fur and carried him to the end of an empty dock. I dropped him in the bay and thanked him for his gift as he disappeared into the dark water. The next morning, I got on a ship going to AM country wearing a passed boy's clothes and carrying papers that said my name was Benjamin.\n\nThe old teacher read to me about my grandfather's long ocean trip. He read about Adam, Victor, and my grandfather's hard times in the new place. Somewhere among all the words, I heard the truth about the two men who had hurt him and my grandmother.\n\n> > _I stopped the two men not because they had taken my wife from me. I stopped them because I didn't want them to have the chance to take a loved one from anyone else. I stopped to prevent more hurting._\n\nThe old teacher stopped reading and put down the papers. He asked a question of the younger teacher.\n\n\"Teacher Ryan cannot understand how such an old man could stop two much younger, stronger men,\" he explained to me.\n\n\"Surprise and big words,\" I said, knowing everything but not telling anything.\n\nWe were all tired. The old teacher gave me my grandfather's things and I saw he had tears in his eyes. I stood, thanked them and turned to go when a question came to me. \"How do you spell _Zee-rota_ in English?\"\n\n\"S-i-r-o-t-a,\" the younger teacher spelled slowly for me.\n\n\"Oh, it begins with an _S_. I thought it was a _Z,_ \" I said \"Thank you.\"\n\nI was out the door and into the street before I knew I had found the secret of my middle initial. The _S_ was for \"Samuel.\" I was the grandson of a hero from a faraway land, who had saved a whole village with his bravery. To honor my grandfather I changed his headstone to read:\n\n**_Henry \"Samuel\" Patrick  \nHero of the Pale  \nLoved Husband--Father--Grandfather_**\n\nWhen my father's headstone was shown for the first time it read:\n\n**_Harry \"Samuel\" Patrick  \nLoving Husband-Son-Father_**\n\nNow that I knew my story I understood why I was never scared.\n\nA few days after my visit to the graveyards I went to the North part and visited a few street corners to say good-bye to old friends. I saw Thomas at Matthew's Bread Shop, and he promised to visit me when he visited his brother-in-law, Sam. I exchanged friendly gestures with Mike, David, and Ryan. I couldn't find Patrick but I met Steve and we hugged. I said bye-bye to some kids playing with a ball in the warm place.\n\nWhen I returned to my home, I found my house owner and the new people looking at the space. \"This place is easy to rent, right, Adam.\" I gently touched the old owner's shoulder.\n\n\"You kidding, Ethan?\" he said with a funny accent. \"These homes are very valuable now. A lot each month.\"\n\nI said hello to the friendly couple who were moving in, and I wished them luck. I tidied up a bit while they measured things. I checked the bathroom one last time and looked in the mirror. I was quite old. People told me I looked a lot younger. Of course there was the matter of my old limp, but if you didn't see me moving when it's very cold, I guess I could look like a younger man. I was still thin at not very tall and not very heavy. If you didn't look at my twice-hurt nose, I didn't look that bad. I still had lots of hair, even if it was a little gray. I thought I looked nice, even though I didn't feel very well. I said bye to my landlord and the new people living in the house. They were busy with measuring and didn't really look at me, but that's okay. They were excited about their new home. I was just the old tenant.\n\nI took some of my things down the stairs and put them in the small, very full moving truck I had rented. I hooked it up to my old, gray car ( _You don 't need a big one to be happy_ was their motto). The car, even though it had a dent and lots of miles, was still working. It was small and not very fancy, and it didn't like the snow. But it was tough and worked well, just like me. But both me and my car would be strange in the new town.\n\n## CHAPTER 8\n\nPHONE NUMBERS\n\nA long, long time ago, a group of native people lived in the town I was moving to in Florida. Many, many years later, a group of Jewish people moved there too. You can find things that the native people left behind in the town's museum. You can find old things from a long time ago all over the place.\n\nWhen I moved to a new place, let's call it BE city, I learned where everything was in just two weeks. There was a big road that went up and down. There were many ways to get into BE city from this road, and these roads went from left to right. On the right, there was a big blue sea. On the left, there were lots of houses with big gates, which you can see a lot in the southern part of our country. But besides these houses, BE city was just like any other place. If you had a lot of toys, you could have a lot of fun. If you didn't have a lot of toys, it might not be as fun. But even the not-so-fun parts of BE city seemed fun to me.\n\nWhen I first came to this place, I felt like I was in a story I had never heard before. I didn't know what to think about BE city or the people who lived there. I wasn't ready for all the different ways people talked. I knew people from BO city spoke in a funny way, but it felt like home to me. The loud NE city way of talking made me miss home. The CH city way of talking sounded just like the BU city talk to me. Everyone who talked in a southern way sounded like they were on TV. The PH city way of talking didn't make me feel anything special. After some time, I was able to understand the way they talked, but understanding the people was a bit harder.\n\nAfter many years as a policeman, I thought I knew a lot about people, and I did. But I didn't know anything about older people, now I was around them all the time. People were walking in the streets of BH town early in the morning or exercising in the fitness club when it opened. By breakfast time, everyone was exercising. The many tennis courts and golf places were full early in the day. I wondered why older people did everything so early in the day. What were they doing next?\n\nFree food was served near the fitness club. To get to the exercise place in the morning, members had to go past lots of bread, cheese, cakes, juice, and coffee. The food had lots of fans who ate for free and complained about the food. They complained about a lot of things.\n\nAs a former policeman, I looked for wrong things everywhere. I saw Mrs. Sophia, a small older lady, take four breads into her bag every morning along with lots of sweet packets. I didn't think it was wrong to take free things, so I didn't stop her. When she took the bread toaster, though, I had to do something. I went with her to her car in the parking area of the play place and we had a small talk. I quickly saw that Mrs. Grace had mind troubles, probably she was forgetting things. She was holding the toaster in her arms under a taken play place towel, and she gave both things to me without saying no. We agreed on something silently standing by her car. Not long after what happened, I got Mrs. Grace a toaster and we became friends. But that's a different story.\n\nA big lunch was given after the morning's fun time. After lunch, many of the men played cards and some slept. Many women played cards or a game; other women went shopping. But after it was three o'clock, things changed.\n\n\"Where are you eating later?\"\n\n\"Home.\"\n\n\"You're joking.\"\n\n\"Of course I'm joking.\"\n\n\"So where are you going?\"\n\n\"We're going to RE restaurant.\"\n\n\"Great. I love the chicken there. Who's going?\"\n\n\"The Adams, the Bens, the Charlies, the Davids, the Ethans, the Franks, the Gabriels, the Henrys, the Isaacs, the Jacks, the Kevins, the Liams. We didn't want a lot of people. Besides, the Matthews, the Nathans, the Olivers, the Patricks, and the Quentins said no.\"\n\n\"I get it.\"\n\n\"And where are you off to?\"\n\n\"To a restaurant.\"\n\n\"You won't get a seat unless you eat at early evening.\"\n\n\"I'm sending Isaac there in the early evening to put our name in. We'll get there in the middle of the evening. There should be an hour wait by then.\"\n\n\"Great. Does Isaac mind waiting all that long?\"\n\n\"No. He likes it. He has a drink at the bar and watches the game.\"\n\n\"What game?\"\n\n\"Any game.\"\n\n\"Great. And who are you going with?\"\n\n\"The Adams', the Bens', the Charlottes', the Davids', the Ethans', the Fionas', the Graces', the Henrys', the Isaacs', the Jacks', the Katherines', the Liams', the Madisons', the Nathans', the Olivias', the Patricks', and the Samuels'. The Thomas' and Ulysses' might join us with the Victors' and Williams'.\"\n\n\"Great. Do any of the men keep Isaac company while he waits at the bar?\n\n\"Isaac doesn't like any of the men.\"\n\n\"Does he like the wives?\"\n\n\"No. He likes the wives less than the men.\"\n\n\"Then why does he go?\"\n\n\"What else does he have to do? \"He enjoys eating at the small eatery and looking at the young servers.\"\n\n\"Don't you think he may try to talk to one of those young ones?\"\n\n\"He doesn't like young girls, either.\"\n\n\"He doesn't? What does he like?\"\n\n\"Ike doesn't like anything. Besides, what's he going to do with a young server other than order a sweet dessert?\"\n\nI was having lunch with Tim's brother-in-law, Sam, at the sports club on a nice day in the middle of my second week working. Sam had a funny way of looking at things and a fun way of expressing himself.\n\n\"So what do you think of this place?\" he asked.\n\n\"I guess it's like a fun camp for grown-ups.\"\n\n\"Yes, but it's during the cooler season. It's too warm here during the hotter season to do anything but change your clothes a lot.\"\n\n\"Some friends told me they prefer it here during the hotter season.\"\n\n\"Whoever told you that wasn't being honest, Officer Pete.\"\n\n\"My name is Mr. Jack,\" Mr. Jack spoke up.\n\n\"There's nothing to enjoy down here during the hotter season,\" Sam continued, \"unless you're a little lizard. Wait till you get in your car on a hot day.\"\n\n\"Warm, huh?\"\n\n\"You'll feel really hot on the seats.\"\n\n\"And what if you're a girl?\"\n\n\"Imagine sitting on a really hot seat.\"\n\nI didn't like that.\n\n\"I guess the same people who told you they like it better when it's warm also said there's no wait for the fun places or movies during that season, and you can go anywhere. Right?\"\n\n\"How did you know?\"\n\n\"Because it's like a repeated story.\"\n\n\"Really? So is it true about the fun places and movies?\"\n\n\"Of course it's true.\"\n\n\"So they're being honest.\"\n\n\"Yes, but they're not telling you the reason, David.\"\n\n\"Okay, why is that?\"\n\n\"You can go to any place in BE city when it's warm because if people had to wait outside...they would get too hot. In fact, that's what happened a while ago.\"\n\n\"You're joking.\"\n\n\"No, I'm not. A new food place opened on GE street and they had a big celebration with a special offer on the first day. People here can't resist special offers, even if it's something silly. So many people were waiting at the food place that it went around the building. Some really old man got too hot waiting for a good deal on a sandwich.\"\n\n\"I don't believe you.\"\n\n\"Okay. Maybe it wasn't a sandwich. \"But a boy fell asleep while waiting.\"\n\n\"That's sad.\"\n\n\"It gets sadder. His wife left him lying under the sun while she had a special treat. They said the boy looked happy because his face was glowing.\"\n\n\"Enough already. I understand.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" he agreed. \"Let's talk about camp again. You ever go to a fun camp?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well I did, and all fun camps, including Camp BA, are the same in one way.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Schedules! Everything is on a schedule except your tummy. Breakfast in the morning, ball game after breakfast, another game at mid-morning, swimming before lunch, lunch at noon, then a rest from after lunch to early afternoon, which is when most boys nap.\"\n\n\"I guess you're talking about what you did.\"\n\n\"Of course. I learnt to use both hands at fun camp. Anyway, like I said, fun camp is all about having fun on a schedule, and so is Camp BA. But there are some differences.\"\n\n\"Like what?\"\n\n\"First of all, talking about what I did again, the boys at Camp BA don't nap as much after lunch as the boys at regular fun camp.\"\n\n\"I'd agree with that,\" I said, \"based on what I did.\"\n\nSamuel nodded.\n\n\"There's a big difference when regular summer camp ends, kids go home and get ready for what comes next. Camp B, though, goes on until the camper goes away forever. At Camp B, campers only think about what's going to happen soon.\"\n\n\"That sounds fun.\"\n\n\"It is fun. It's really fun. Look at this place. It's beautiful and wonderful. Everyone's laughing, running, jumping, riding, swinging, playing. They're doing all sorts of things here. The only problem is.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"The campers don't have to think anymore so everyone's head slowly turns to mush.\"\n\n\"I think you're making it sound worse than it is. I've met a lot of smart, successful people here.\"\n\n\"You're absolutely right. There are a lot of smart, successful people here. Lots of them. They're great. You could write a book about them. But these used to be important lawyers, doctors, and business people aren't thinking hard anymore. You can't just stop a busy mind for a long time and expect it to work perfectly like a B Volkswagen.\"\n\n\"What's a big car?\" \n\n\"A fancy car.\" \n\n\"I didn't know that,\" I giggled.\n\n\"If you didn't know that,\" Sam spoke, \"I suppose you don't know what bedtime is, either.\"\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"What's bedtime?\"\n\n\"Late at night,\" he shared.\n\nI giggled again.\n\n\"When I first came here,\" Sam added, \"I had trouble remembering everyone's name.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I'm having that trouble, too,\" I agreed.\n\n\"So, I'm at a party one night,\" Sam went on, \"and I see a boy I'm sure I've met before but I can't remember his name. I thought I'd just be honest so I said 'hello' and said, 'I'm sorry but I forgot your name' and he said, 'So did I.' \"\n\nSam and I both started laughing.\n\n\"Seriously. Do you know what really happens to busy people when they aren't busy enough?\"\n\n\"Tell me.\"\n\n\"They make simple things very important.\"\n\n\"Like what?\"\n\n\"Like a game, or where they're going to eat every night.\"\n\n\"Aren't you being a little tough on these people?\"\n\n\"Not really. I like most of them but they're quite tough on me, too,\" Sam said. \"These people really bother me. Do you know how many times in a year people ask me why I work a lot and don't play more games? It's surprising. They make me feel like I did something wrong.\"\n\n\"What wrong thing?\"\n\n\"Um, I don't know. Maybe 'You shall not find joy in your work while we're just playing games'?\"\n\n\"Is that a rule?\"\n\n\"From a book,\" he thought. \"But honestly, I don't work a lot. A person who digs holes works a lot. I go to a nice, cool office where I get to think with some of the best people in the world. It's fun. I love it. I'm good at it. I don't need anyone telling me how to play games.\"\n\n\"I don't understand game words.\"\n\n\"Me neither. I'm just saying something. I'm happy with what I'm doing, and I don't need games. I don't need sports. I have other things I like.\"\n\n\"That's easy to understand.\"\n\n\"Really? Well try telling this to a very important old doctor or boss who's retired. He's changed his fancy clothes for shorts, a game shirt, and a cap. Then take these old winners, cover them in sun cream until they look like a funny person, and convince them that their new goal in life is to win a small game.\"\n\n\"Oh, I remember now.\" I had a hard time remembering all the names. \"She's very kind.\"\n\n\"Kind indeed,\" Mr. Jackson agreed. I crossed my arms and gave him a stern look.\n\n\"I mean she's really friendly.\"\n\n\"Her husband didn't think so. He went away with a younger lady two years ago.\"\n\n\"You're joking.\"\n\n\"It happens. But you're right. She is very kind.\"\n\nMr. Jackson and I enjoyed watching Alice walk away. It was nice for both of us.\n\n\"Oh, by the way,\" Sam interrupted us, \"there is one thing that upsets me more than people who play too much golf.\"\n\n\"What could that be?\" I asked.\n\n\"Clubhouse rules,\" he said right away.\n\n\"I don't know much about clubhouse rules,\" I said.\n\n\"The problem with clubhouse rules is that almost all of the rules are silly, and almost all of the people can't agree on anything anyway. And last year, the rules here got really strict, as I'm sure you know.\"\n\n\"No. What happened last year?\"\n\n\"No one told you about the bad thing at BO town?\"\n\n\"Stop teasing, Sam.\"\n\n\"I'm not joking.\"\n\n\"You want me to think something bad happened at BO town because of clubhouse rules?\"\n\nSamuel lifted his hand. \"Truly.\"\n\n\"Nonsense.\"\n\n\"Really. I'm surprised nobody told you. A guy named Ryan was not nice last year over playground games. He was found in his garage with a toy golf stick on his forehead.\"\n\nI laughed loud and nudged Samuel gently.\n\n\"Stop, Samuel, you're joking.\"\n\n\"Oh no I'm not.\" He looked at the sky. \"Hey, I need to leave.\"\n\n\"Wait, you have to tell me what happened.\"\n\nSamuel was moving. \"No time. But you can ask anyone here. Everyone knows the story. It was talked about for a long time,\" he said as he walked away.\n\n\"Wait. You need to tell me! Who was not nice to Ryan?\" I called after him.\n\n\"We'd all like to know that,\" said a man sitting at the table next to me.\n\n## CHAPTER 9\n\nSANDCASTLE FRIENDS\n\nI forgot about the story of Ryan and focused on learning the names and habits of the playground friends. I had no trouble remembering Mrs. Alice. She often appeared in my daydreams, and one night she became a main character. Mr. Jack and I liked the show a lot. I knew that Alice and I were from different places, and I did not think that we would be together. But dreaming about it was fun, and I was happy that I could still dream like this.\n\nThe people at BO club were different but they all had some things that were the same. When they were young, they all wanted to be something. Now that they were old, they used to be something.\n\n\"I used to be a heart doctor, Ethan,\" said an old man.\n\n\"That's great, Dr. Gabriel. Here, let me help you with that golf bag.\"\n\n\"Yes, I used to do heart operations.\"\n\n\"Wow. Are you driving or riding, Doc?\"\n\n\"Driving. I used to fix hearts.\"\n\n\"With balloons, right?\"\n\n\"I guess that's one way to say it.\"\n\n\"Sounds fun.\"\n\n\"It was. A long time ago, I used to help people live or die. Can you think about that feeling, Ethan?\"\n\n\"I think I can, Dr. Gabriel.\"\n\n\"No, you can't. You're a bag boy.\"\n\n\"Actually, I'm the head of safety here, Dr. Gabriel.\"\n\n\"Is my golf bag safe?\"\n\n\"It looks safe to me,\" I said, shaking the bag for him to check.\n\n\"Good. So what does a helper know about helping and not helping?\"\n\n\"I used to be a helper, Dr. Gabriel. When I had my helping hand out, I had the same ability you did with your toy.\"\n\n\"I didn't know you used to be a helper.\"\n\n\"Everyone used to be something before they got here, Dr. Gabriel.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's true,\" the former toy doctor said thoughtfully. \"Everyone used to be something.\" He paused a moment. \"I used to be a toy doctor, you know.\"\n\n\"I know, Dr. Gabriel. Well, do your best.\"\n\n\"It would be easier for me to fix a toy.\" He left, deep in thought.\n\n\"Where you from, Mr. Samuel?\"\n\n\"PH city. I used to be a helper.\"\n\n\"Do you know Dr. David? He's from PH city.\"\n\n\"Know him? I helped him.\"\n\n\"I used to be in a shop back in CH city,\" short, neat Liam told me. His pure-white hair was neat and always in place. His clothes were coordinated, and he was always clean. He wore a big gold star around his neck.\n\n\"What kind of shop, Mr. Liam?\"\n\n\"There are many kinds of jobs.\"\n\n\"Anything special?\"\n\n\"Are you writing a book, Ethan?\"\n\n\"No. Just curious.\"\n\n\"Don't be.\"\n\n\"No problem, Mr. Liam.\"\n\nAnother man said, \"I used to be a dentist.\"\n\n\"Painless?\"\n\n\"Not really. I didn't like it at all.\"\n\n\"I used to be a doctor. No silly comments, please.\"\n\n\"Hey, what do you think I am? Silly?\"\n\nAnd another man said, \"I used to work in ladies clothes.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you still do, Mr. Benjamin.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but don't tell my wife, Ethan.\"\n\n\"You told me you were single.\"\n\nDr. Samuel said, \"I used to be a sleeping doctor.\"\n\n\"I thought so,\" I said, feeling sleepy.\n\nAnd then there was a very different kind of used to be.\n\n\"I used to be married, but my old husband left me for his younger hairdresser.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry about that, Mrs. Wendy. Have a good game.\"\n\n\"He doesn't even speak SP country, the silly man.\"\n\n\"Your turn, Mrs. Wendy.\"\n\n\"Well, never mind him.\"\n\n_I think she did,_ Mr. Jack said to me.\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, a man told me, \"I used to be married but I left my wife for a younger woman who does nails.\"\n\n\"Your nails look nice, Mr. William.\"\n\nI found most of the people nice and interesting although some were nicer and more interesting than others. I had never been around so many successful people before and it was new to me. I tried my best to get along with everyone and to stay away from the hard people I started to call the Bad B's: Bad Boys and Bad Girls.\n\nBad Boys were men who didn't become nicer as they got older. They stayed bossy and made every situation a problem. They were _want_ guys:\n\n_\" Want a cup of juice.\"_\n\n_\" Want this.\"_\n\n_\" Want that.\"_\n\nNever _\" Can I have_\" or _\" Please.\"_ Just _want._\n\nWhether the men were nice or not, there was something about all of them that made me feel strange. These former bosses and very respected workers seemed to have lost what made them special in this same-looking place. They all seemed the same in a fun world of white hair and planned fun. They made me think of fast race horses that had been moved to a field as a prize for a winning career. They could still think about the fun of the game, but their game days were over. I don't know why this upset me. It didn't seem to upset them. Most of the men were nice and full of energy and had friends that made me think of the close groups in the NE city. The big difference was that the NE city groups became the same by growing up, while the BH groups became the same by growing older.\n\nBH Girls were a puzzle to me. There were a lot of very nice, normal women in BH Town who were very friendly. But the local thing known as the BH Girl was totally new to me. The BH Girl was an easy to spot mix of a bad mood, fancy clothes, beauty magic, and surprise changes. Under the professionally done makeup and carefully picked fancy clothes were good nose changes, bad nose changes, good chest changes, bad chest changes, good lip changes, bad lip changes, and face changes that made you wonder.\n\nDon't misunderstand me. I have nothing against beauty changes and Mr. Jack doesn't care if a woman's chest is real or not. He's a boy. But even Mr. Jack found BH Girls scary. It wasn't just the clear changes, either. Many of the women who had beauty changes were super ladies and if these changes made them happy I thought that was great. But a real BR lady had the same effect on Mr. Jack as a cold shower. BR ladies didn't seem to appreciate their spoiled way of life. They acted as if they deserved the spoiling. I don't know if this feeling was due to too much spoilage from their mom and dad when they were little or from husbands who didn't care much when they got older. These BR ladies didn't have much they needed to do, so they could spoil themselves and have fun. Anything less than perfect was not in their day's plans.\n\nMostly, there was a nice working friendship between the boy and girl helpers at BR Hills and the boy and girl golf players. However, there wasn't much of a relationship or gratefulness between the helpers and the KB's. If something wasn't perfect, someone had to pay. One day, it was my turn.\n\nMr. Matthew asked me to come into his room.\n\n\"Did you read the rule book?\" he asked me.\n\n\"From start to end, boss.\"\n\n\"Do you know what a helper is supposed to do?\"\n\nI had learned the duties of a helper and remembered the basic stuff. \"The helper has the full power to make sure all the rules are followed, including who is in each group, how fast the game goes, how the game is played, and taking care of the golf place.\"\n\n\"Okay, great,\" Matthew said. \"You're a helper.\"\n\n\"Is there a special hello event?\"\n\n\"No, but I need a helper on the path right now at the seventh spot, and there's a good chance you'll get yelled _at_. Think of that as your hello event.\"\n\n\"Do I need a hard shell?\"\n\n\"No, but a tough heart would help.\"\n\n\"I have that on already. What's the trouble out there?\"\n\n\"There's a group at the seventh spot slowing down the game something awful. It's my fault. I put Mrs. Fiona and Mrs. Fiona out there in the finals of a girls' game against each other, and they're like cats and dogs. To make things worse, I filled out their team with two friends of Mrs. Fiona, Mrs. Fiona and Mrs. Fiona. You know them?\"\n\nI nodded. Three Town Girls. Three face changes, two nose changes, one failed belly fix, one successful belly fix, and enough teeth fixes to fill a book entitled _The Bridges of P Town._\n\n\"The three of them are probably being mean to poor Mrs. Fiona,\" Mike added.\n\n_I don 't want anyone being mean to Mrs. Fiona except me,_ Mr. Adam said.\n\n\"Hey, boss, with all due respect, why don't you go out there and deal with these girls?\"\n\n\"Two reasons,\" Mike said. \"One, I'm a little scared and you're not. Two, this is a task for a helper and everyone else is busy.\"\n\n\"I think everyone else is hiding.\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\nThere were no white horses available, so I drove to Mrs. Fiona's rescue in a little cart marked \"Helper.\" It was a beautiful winter day. The sun was shining, and it was warm. My hands and knees were happy. The grass was very green, the water was dark blue, and the sand was a shiny white. Everything looked bright and happy, except for the people playing a game. Every field was filled with a sad, grumpy group of people waiting impatiently for their turn. Some of them shouted at me, but I just kept going.\n\nWhen I got to the seventh place, I saw the problem. The group in front of the F team was already leaving the eighth place, and the F team hadn't even started at the seventh place. They either didn't know about the mess they had made behind them or they just didn't care. Mrs. Fiona was on her little phone, which by itself was not allowed. I saw Mrs. Madison shaking a finger at and talking to a quiet Alice. Mrs. Madison stopped talking when she saw me coming. She put her ball ready, swung her bat, and was about to hit the ball. My cart stopped with a loud noise, and Mrs. Fiona moved away from her ball and looked at me in anger. Alice looked at me angrily. Madison looked at me and whispered into her toy phone, \"I'll talk later.\" Mrs. Alice looked at me. She seemed not happy.\n\n\"Yes?\" Mrs. Fiona said loudly. I noticed her clothes were a mix of bright colors. Perfect.\n\n_She 's a bit scary,_ Mr. Jack said. _I don 't want to be too close to her. I have a limit_.\n\n_You have nothing to worry about,_ I assured my friend.\n\n\"Sorry for stopping you, Mrs. Fiona, but I have to ask you to please play faster. Your group is making others wait.\"\n\n\"They're playing an important game,\" Mrs. Alice told me as if I should have known.\n\n\"I understand, but you still need to play faster,\" I told her.\n\nMrs. Fiona left the area and walked towards me. \"Do you know why we're playing so slow?\" she asked me. \"It's because of her.\" She pointed at Alice. \"She doesn't know the rules, and she can't count.\"\n\n\"That's not right,\" Alice protested. \"You're questioning all I do here. You've called the treehouse three times already. It's silly.\"\n\n\"We're playing for a trophy,\" Mrs. Fiona reminded everyone.\n\n\"People told me you would try to bother me during the game, and they were right.\" Mrs. Alice was very upset.\n\n\"I'm not bothering you. You're bothering me.\"\n\nI spoke louder. \"LADIES! Either play faster or let the next team play.\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" Mrs. Fiona asked me.\n\n\"I'm the helper.\"\n\n\"I know that. But who are you? What's your name?\"\n\nI pointed to my name badge. She read it carefully. \"Well, Ethan, no one is playing before us. This is a trophy game.\"\n\n\"You're making everyone wait.\"\n\n\"I told you it's because of her,\" she said, pointing at Mrs. Alice. Mrs. Alice looked away and was quiet. I thought she might be sad, and I wanted to tell her everything was going to be all right. Mr. Jack had other thoughts, but I didn't let him talk. I saw the other two girls were agreeing with what Mrs. Fiona was saying about Mrs. Alice. I was watching a three-on-one game. I didn't like uneven teams, and I liked Mrs. Fiona, so I decided to help. \"Who's winning this game?\" I asked.\n\n\"Why do you care?\" Mrs. Fiona snapped.\n\n\"I'm winning,\" Mrs. Fiona said. Her eyes were wet, and her lower lip was shaking. She was very upset, and I was getting mad.\n\n\"That's what I thought,\" I replied.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Mrs. Fiona asked again, upset.\n\n\"The ones who are losing usually complain the most,\" I said.\n\n\"Who do you think you are?\" Mrs. Fiona was shouting now. \"You can't talk to me like that.\"\n\nA group of four boys playing behind us had finished playing the sixth game and were starting the seventh. They looked very annoyed because they had to wait.\n\n\"What's happening here?\" one of them asked. They all looked frustrated.\n\n\"We're playing a game. Mind your own business,\" Fiona told them as if they were naughty kids.\n\nSuddenly, I saw a big red spot. DANGER ZONE! I was scared, this was getting serious. I left my cart and walked to the group of boys. I rubbed my eyes trying to get away from the red lights that were dancing in front of my eyes. The girls looked at me with interest. Mrs. Fiona went back to the tee area and got ready to hit her ball.\n\n\"This slow play is silly,\" one of the boys told me.\n\n\"Yes, it is silly. I'm going to let you play next.\"\n\nThe four boys looked at me with surprise. \"You're joking,\" one of them said.\n\nThen Mrs. Fiona swung at her ball and it went straight up in the air. It went only a little forward and rolled down a hill to the water's edge. She threw her club to the ground. \"I'm going to try again,\" she said like a little child. \"You were talking.\" She pointed at me. She got her ball back, ran back to the tee, and hit again. This time she hit the ball far and straight down the field. She turned to face the boys with a happy smile on her face. By then I was at the girls' tee area. Mrs. Grace was getting ready to hit. I stepped in her way.\n\n\"I'm letting these boys play next. Please leave the tee area.\"\n\n\"You can't do that,\" Mrs. Grace said, moving toward me.\n\n\"Yes I can, Mrs. \"Frost.\" I took my rule book out of my pocket and gave it to her. \"As a helper at the play park, I can do that.\"\n\nShe didn't look at the rule book and looked at me with a mad face. When I looked back at her, I saw her face turn white. It must have been a really mad look. \"And speaking of rules, Mrs. Fiona, I'm going to make sure that you're not allowed to play anymore for moving your ball just now and trying to hit it again.\"\n\n\"I was going to hit it again because you bothered me,\" she said.\n\n\"There are no do-overs in this game, Mrs. Fiona.\"\n\n\"You can't stop me from playing. You'll mess up the whole game.\"\n\n\"You've already messed up this game for me,\" Mrs. Madison said. \"You're not nice, and I quit.\" Without saying anything else, Alice drove away, leaving her friend, Mrs. Bella, with no ride.\n\n\"Well, I guess I win the game by default,\" Mrs. Fiona said, not bothered by what happened.\n\n\"Not if I can help it you won't,\" I told her.\n\n\"Why you little bother,\" she shouted after me, officially making me a helper. \"Give a little boy a little power and he thinks he's a big boy. \"I'll make sure you don't stay here any longer.\"\n\n\"I'll do that myself,\" I told her and went away. I spoke to the club house on my toy phone. Adam answered.\n\n\"Hey, Ethan, what's happening there? Miss Fiona just came in crying and ran to the restroom. What did you do?\"\n\n\"I did my work, Adam. And Miss Feinberg should be stopped for cheating. Miss Fiona should be declared the winner, or you should stop the whole game.\" I put down the phone then picked it up again. \"Adam?\" I called him again.\n\n\"I was just calling you,\" he told me. \"What's happening?\"\n\n\"I'm leaving.\" I stopped again. I felt happy. I didn't belong in this place.\n\nI went back to the place where I left the cart. I left my toy phone on the seat and walked to the car park.\n\n\"Hey, Ethan,\" Adam called my name from the shop door. \"Come here. We have a problem.\"\n\nI saw the three friends lurking behind him. Miss Feinberg looked like a big bird. Clearly they had gone directly to the club house from the game area. \"We don't have a problem,\" I called to him. \"You've got a problem.\"\n\n\"Hey, Ethan,\" he shouted, \"us NE city boys have to stick together.\"\n\n\"Not this far south,\" I said.\n\n\"I took a chance on you, Ethan,\" he reminded me. \"You owe me.\"\n\n\"You're right,\" I said. \"I'll paint your house.\"\n\n\"Come back here, please.\"\n\n\"I'm too dangerous right now,\" I told him honestly. \"I need some time to cool off. Make an excuse for me and I'll get back to you.\"\n\n\"Hey, you were the toughest cop in NE city,\" Matthew reminded me. \"You can handle a little thing like this.\"\n\n\"Nothing I ever did before prepared me for this place,\" I said.\n\nI drove west on YA road, passing the large museum on my way to ST road. I wondered what Sam and Matthew would think of their farms now. My little phone rang, but I didn't answer. I drove north on ST road for about a while before I realized I didn't know where I was or where I was going. I was driving a car seeing strange colors. I decided to stop the car before I found myself in southern GA area.\n\nI pulled to the side of the road and turned off the engine. I rubbed my eyes. The strange colors were fading, but my hands were shaking. I got out of the car and walked around. I took some big breaths. When I stood up, I saw small, weak-looking houses across the big road on the side going down. I saw some people with dark skin going in and out of the old houses, which had tv antennas on their roofs. It looked like people lived in these small houses, which didn't look healthy or safe. I thought maybe these were people from other places working for little money at one of the different businesses on this part of the big road. There were building companies, tree farms, and other farms on both sides of the big road. It seemed like the town or the state didn't care about how these people lived. I couldn't help but think about these poor houses compared to the big beautiful houses of BO city's kings and queens only a few miles east of the big road. BO city's story was probably filled with many \"small house people\" who had helped build the big houses and the walls that surrounded them. The walls were built to keep out the people who built them.\n\nI saw a small girl with brown skin about five or six come out of one of the houses, followed by a woman who looked like her mom. They were both laughing. The mom picked up the little girl, spun her around, and gave her many kisses on the face. The girl laughed and pretended to be annoyed by her mother's love, but they were both clearly having fun with their game. I wished I could be like them. They were happy living in a messy place with nothing to keep them from being completely hopeless except their love for each other.\n\nI thought of Madison. She was a person who had everything, but who could only be happy when someone else was unhappy. She seemed to be a woman who would never be satisfied with who she was or what she had. There are some people who nothing can make happy and then there are some people who are happy with nothing.\n\nThe little girl and her mother saw me looking at them. They stopped playing and looked at me. I waved to them. The little girl waved back at me as the cars went by on the big road. The mother hugged the girl closer, and her eyes told me to leave them alone.\n\nWhen I went back to the car, my phone was ringing again. The call was from Matthew. I also saw that I had a message, which I thought was from him, too. I didn't want to talk to him, but because he was my friend I answered the phone and said hello.\n\n\"Adam, where are you?\"\n\n\"I'm on the big road with the people who live in the small houses.\"\n\n\"Someone famous?\" He was serious.\n\nI giggled. \"No. I mean people living in small houses by the side of the road in FR country.\"\n\n\"There are small houses in FR country in BE town?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure where I am, to be honest.\"\n\n\"So, what are you doing there?\"\n\n\"I'm trying to get a job as a park helper.\"\n\n\"That's funny. What went wrong at the park today?\"\n\n\"The F group must have told you what happened.\"\n\n\"Yes, according to three of them you scared them.\"\n\n\"I didn't touch anyone.\"\n\n\"They didn't say you touched them. Mrs. Fiona said you looked at her like you were angry at her.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Fiona is wrong. I looked at her like I was really angry at her.\"\n\n\"They're making a complaint against you.\"\n\n\"To who?\"\n\n\"The complaint group.\"\n\n\"There's a complaint group at BE town?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Matthew said. \"That's how things go here.\"\n\n\"Can I make a complaint about having a complaint group?\"\n\n\"I'm sure you could,\" Matthew said.\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Write it down and give it to the complaint group.\" He giggled. \"And, by the way, you have to meet the group next week to talk about their complaint.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to any meeting.\"\n\n\"Then they'll let you go.\"\n\n\"They can't let me go. I already left.\"\n\n\"I know.\" Adam was tired. \"I wish you hadn't. Fiona said you did nothing wrong.\"\n\n\"Fiona is a nice woman,\" I said.\n\n_Fiona is smart!_ said Mr. Benjamin.\n\n\"Will you go to the meeting or not?\"\n\n\"I'm not sad.\"\n\n\"You might be able to help Fiona. I'm sure she'd be happy if you did.\"\n\n_We'll be there._ Mr. Benjamin made the choice for me. He did that now and then.\n\n## CHAPTER 1\n\nCRIMES\n\nI drove from SA Road to the shopping center on PO Road. When I walked into the big store I was still thinking about the \"rich and poor\" in the place. I had a bad headache. I was hungry. I needed a nap. The store was full, and the lines at the counters were long. After waiting quietly for a little while in line, it was my turn. I started putting my food on the counter when a short, white-haired old lady rushed in front of me and started placing her items on the counter.\n\n\"Excuse me, but I'm waiting here,\" I said nicely.\n\nThe lady looked at me over her glasses. \"So wait,\" she said, like it was normal. This made a few people behind me in line laugh, but the lady didn't notice. She just emptied her shopping cart slowly. The young boy at the checkout, wearing dark clothes under his required green store vest, smiled at me.\n\nBing! One red spot. _Stay calm,_ I told myself, knowing that trouble was just a red spot away. I looked at the old lady in front of me. Why was she in such a hurry? How old was she? I thought she was around seventy.\n\n\"Stop looking at me,\" she said, looking angry.\n\n\"I'm not looking at you.\"\n\n\"Yes you are,\" she quickly said. I saw that there weren't any wrinkles around her eyes. I looked at her hands giving a hundred-dollar bill to the boy. They didn't look like an old lady's hands. _Warning. Distraction Action!_ I watched as the boy took the lady's money. He put the hundred in the cash box on top of other hundreds.\n\n_I'm surprised,_ I said to myself.\n\nThe boy gave the lady forty dollars back, which she put in her bag. She gave me a \"stop worrying\" look and walked across the room to the helper's desk. I watched her. She walked in front of two people in line, causing a small fuss. She took money from the bank, showing two types of ID while talking with the two people she had passed.\n\n\"Wow,\" I said, loud enough for others to hear\n\nWhen the helper gave me my money back, I pointed to the big bill the woman had just given him.\n\n\"I want that big bill,\" I told him. I took two smaller bills from my bag and held them out to him.\n\nHe looked tired.\n\n\"Next, please,\" he said.\n\nDing!Ding! Ding! Two red spots.\n\n\"What didn't you get?\" I was getting mad. \"I told you I want that big bill for my two smaller ones.\"\n\n\"I heard you,\" he said. \"Next.\"\n\nDing!Ding!Ding! Ding! Ding! Trouble!\n\n\"If you don't give me that bill, I'm gonna pull that ring right out of your nose.\"\n\n\"You don't scare me, you old man,\" the helper said.\n\nI had never been called an old man. In a different time, I might have thought it was funny. But with this silly boy, I was very mad. I moved my right hand towards his left nose hole. He moved back quickly and covered his nose with his hands. \"Are you not nice?\" he shouted loudly.\n\nI reached across the counter and took the big note I wanted from the cash box. I placed my two smaller notes in the box.\n\n\"Hey, you can't do that,\" he said loudly.\n\n\"I can't do what? Give you two nice smaller notes for this pretend big note?\" I held the note up to the light to check my thought.\n\n\"What do you mean, pretend?\"\n\nI looked out of the window. The old lady had just got to her car, which was close to mine. I still had time. I held the big note towards the boy. \"Take your hands off your nose, Pinocchio, and look. I'm not going to hurt you.\"\n\nHe moved closer, but his hands stayed on his nose.\n\n\"Whose picture do you see in the light part?\" I pointed.\n\n\"Adam's!\" he said happily.\n\n\"Good boy,\" I said. \"Now whose picture is in the middle?\"\n\n\"Frank's,\" he said with equal happiness.\n\n\"Right again.\"\n\n\"So what's the problem?\"\n\n\"The problem, Ethan, is that Adam's picture isn't supposed to be there.\"\n\n\"Well, it's there,\" the boy said strongly.\n\n\"That's because it's funny money, silly.\"\n\nI put the big note in my shirt pocket and lifted my shopping bag. The old lady was in a car and moving out of her parking spot. I put my shopping in the back seat of my car and jumped in to drive. I followed the car east on a big road and then south on another road. I watched the car turn left into a bumpy parking place of a closed car-parts shop. I turned left into the next driveway and parked as close to the edge as possible. Through the leaves I could see the empty car and another old car parked behind the building. The woman must have gone inside to meet someone.\n\nI turned off my car and waited. About a half hour later, the back door of the building opened. A blond woman, who looked to be about grown-up, left the building. She was followed by two big, bald men with colorful short-sleeved shirts worn outside their jeans. The woman walked fast to the car. _So much for a white-haired, old lady,_ I thought. The three of them talked and checked their watches. She got in the car and drove away. The men followed in the other car.\n\nI decided to wait a bit before going to the building in case they came back quickly. I left my car and looked at the small shops. There was a shop for fixing air-conditioners, a shop for fixing vacuums, and a shop for ear-piercing. I also saw the big letters _P.A._ painted over a metal door. In the BE city, P.A. stood for the Police Kids Club. I walked over, opened the metal door ... and stepped into my past.\n\nThe gym felt like an old friend. I heard the familiar sounds of the fast bags mixed with the heavy thump of the big bags. I heard the sound of a skipping rope. I smelled sweat. Across the room, I saw a high boxing ring. Two teenage boys were practising while an older man stood on the ring side, teaching them. To my left, I saw a place for lifting heavy things where six boys in workout clothes looked at me quietly. I walked toward the high boxing ring and read the signs along the way:\n\nDON'T BE TIRED!  \nTRAIN HARD OR GO HOME!  \nDO NOT SIT HERE!  \nONLY FOR FIGHTERS!\n\nThere were flags hanging from the high ceiling advertising King boxing tools and gloves. Posters told about coming events and events that had happened.\n\n\"Can I help you?\" a man in a gray outfit asked. I looked up and saw that the two friends were resting in their corners.\n\n\"No, not really. I just sort of wandered in,\" I explained. \"I'm a retired helper from a big city, and when I saw the sign on the door, I had to check it out.\"\n\n\"Welcome.\" He smiled. \"We've been getting a lot of visitors lately.\"\n\n\"Why's that?\"\n\n\"One of our kids just won a big game. The local papers have been talking about it a lot.\"\n\n\"Hey, that's great.\"\n\n\"Take a break, kids,\" he called to the resting friends, who left the place immediately. The coach walked down the wooden steps carefully. He was tall with a grown-up body.\n\n\"I'm Benjamin,\" he told me, holding out his hand.\n\n\"Ethan.\" We shook hands.\n\n\"Are you with the city helpers?\" I asked.\n\n\"Me? No. I'm just a volunteer trainer. I love the kids, and I love the game.\"\n\n\"Were you a player?\"\n\n\"I tried, but I wasn't very good,\" he said honestly. \"I just didn't have what it takes. That's why I respect these kids. They're doing something very few people can do.\"\n\n\"You are right.\"\n\n\"Were you a fighter?\"\n\n\"I was more like a rough player.\"\n\n\"Rough players are hard to teach.\"\n\n\"I know,\" I giggled. \"Do your rough players ever win against your fighters?\"\n\n\"Not much,\" Adam said. \"The fight club's rules like fighters. Three hits without a reply, and there's a break. If there's a fall, there's a break. Big soft gloves and helmets help a lot. Not many falls, and only a few give ups. Rough players usually lose by scores.\"\n\nHe looked at his watch. It was late in the afternoon. \"I should do some teaching,\" he said. \"Matthew should be here any time, and you can chat with him about our program. He's with the city police and really leads the team.\"\n\nThe metal front door made a sound, and we both looked that way. A small group came in, led by a thin AS boy who looked like he was about eleven or twelve years old. The boy was followed by a middle-aged AS man, who I thought was his dad. A young man carrying a simple camera and another young man holding a paper and a pen followed them. The last one in the group was a small, pale boy of about eight. The picture-taker started snapping quick pictures when he came into the big room. The _snap, zip, snap_ of the camera seemed to make the boxers slow down. Benjamin and I had our picture taken. _Snap, zip, snap._ The boy from AF country was chatting with the writer, who was busy writing things down.\n\n\"What's that about?\" I asked.\n\n\"Very interesting,\" Benjamin said. \"The picture-taker and the writer are from the _BV paper,_ a tiny local paper. They're writing a story about that kid, Henry. He's known as 'The Punching Teacher.' \"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because he knows a lot about boxing than just about anyone I ever met,\" Benjamin explained. \"I think he remembers everything he sees.\"\n\n\"No kidding.\"\n\n\"He's amazing,\" Benjamin continued. \"What he doesn't already know about boxing he looks up on the computer. We let him use our computer when he's at the big room, so he's always close to his info. He's really good with computers, too. He made his own computer page.\"\n\n\"That's cool. Is that his dad with him?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Nice man.\"\n\n\"And the little boy?\"\n\n\"That's Thomas. He looks up to Henry and follows him around all the time.\"\n\n\"They seem different in age.\"\n\n\"They are. Henry's twelve, and Tommy's only about eight, I think. I wouldn't call them friends. Henry is more like a big brother to Tommy.\"\n\n\"Isn't that Tommy's father's job?\"\n\n\"No one really knows who Tommy's father is,\" Adam sighed. \"His mother was alone, and when Tommy was born, both the mother and the boyfriend were not well.\"\n\n\"Oh no.\"\n\n\"That's the right word.\" Adam shook his head. \"The FL country took Tommy away from his mother and put him in a new home. A few years later she got him back after she became well. Now he's back in the new home.\"\n\n\"Did his mother become unwell again?\"\n\n\"No, she never did,\" Adam told me. \"She tried to be good, but she had this new friend who was not nice to the two of them and scared the boy.\"\n\n\"What happened to the friend?\"\n\n\"Tommy's mother stopped him. She used his own tool while he was sleeping.\"\n\n\"What happened to her?\"\n\n\"She hurt herself with the same tool after she called the helpers and told them to hurry over and get Tommy. The helpers found the two people in one room and Tommy in his bed asleep. He's been in the new home ever since.\"\n\n\"How old was he when all this happened?\"\n\n\"I think he was about four.\"\n\n\"Why hasn't anyone adopted him until now? He's a nice boy.\"\n\n\"Yes, he's a nice boy,\" Benjamin agreed. \"But he looks different from other kids, which makes it hard for people to adopt him. He can also be very stubborn. People don't want to bring his stubbornness into their homes no matter how much they want a child.\"\n\n\"He probably doesn't trust anyone.\"\n\n\"Can you blame him? Although, I think he trusts me,\" Benjamin said. \"And I know he trusts Matthew. Those two should be like father and son.\"\n\n\"Why aren't they?\"\n\n\"Matthew's a policeman with a policeman's salary and has two kids of his own to care for.\"\n\nI nodded my understanding.\n\nMatthew arrived just as the talk with the Teacher ended. Matthew was a good-looking, friendly guy, tall and strong. Benjamin introduced us, and we talked about sports and being a policeman for a while. The Teacher and his student were nearby, and Matthew called them over.\n\n\"How was the talk, Henry?\" Matthew asked.\n\n\"Same old thing,\" the Teacher said.\n\n\"Were you with him, Thomas?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" was all Thomas said.\n\n\"Well, boys,\" Matthew said, \"I want you to meet Ethan. He's a former officer from a big city, and he used to participate in sports. Have you ever heard of him?\"\n\n\"They couldn't know me,\" I said. \"That was a long, long time ago.\"\n\n\"I know about sportsmen from a long, long, long time ago,\" the Professor said.\n\n\"Me too,\" Thomas said.\n\n\"Okay.\" I asked Thomas. \"Who was Benjamin?\"\n\nThe four of them looked surprised and exchanged looks.\n\n\"You told him!\" Thomas said to Matthew and Benjamin.\n\n\"Thomas, we didn't say anything,\" Matthew promised.\n\n\"Is there a problem?\" I asked.\n\n\"Why did you ask about Benjamin?\" Thomas questioned me. \"He's not well-known anymore.\"\n\n\"It seems like I picked a guy you don't know about.\"\n\nThe boy rolled his eyes. \"Benjamin was called 'The Pride of the Neighbourhood.' He was a champion in three different games,\" Thomas recited. \"He played against Jack three times--\"\n\n\"Alright, alright,\" I stopped him. \"You know all about Benjamin. So why did you make such a big fuss?\"\n\nThe boy didn't smile. \"Everyone here knows Benjamin is my favourite player. \"Somebody must have shared with you.\"\n\n\"No one shared anything with me, Thomas.\"\n\n\"I don't trust you.\" The boy was getting assertive.\n\n\"Thomas,\" Matthew interfered. \"Be polite.\"\n\n\"There are many fighters, Officer Matthew. Why did he choose Benjamin Ross?\" The boy looked at me sternly.\n\n\"Benjamin Ross was my grandpa's favorite fighter,\" I elaborated. \"And he told me I fought like Ross.\"\n\n\"Were you any good?\" Another challenge.\n\n\"Not as good as Benjamin Ross,\" I expressed honestly.\n\n\"Of course not,\" the boy responded. \"Did you win any trophies?\"\n\n\"A few.\"\n\n\"I can search for you on the Web, you know.\" He was testing me.\n\n\"You probably won't find anything. It was a long while ago.\"\n\n\"If you're honest, I'll find you.\"\n\n\"Thomas,\" Matthew said sternly. \"Stop it.\"\n\n\"It's alright,\" I said to Matthew.\n\n\"No, it's not.\" Matthew was bothered. \"Thomas, say sorry to Mr. Patrick.\"\n\nThe boy looked at Matthew, then at me. \"Did you know Benjamin Ross was a war hero?\" he asked without regret.\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied. \"He won a shiny star at G place.\"\n\n\"Did you win a shiny star?\"\n\n\"I wasn't in a big fight.\"\n\n\"Did you get any prizes for anything?\"\n\n\"A few,\" I answered truthfully.\n\n\"Like what?\" the boy asked loudly.\n\n\"Tommy, I didn't say I was Thomas,\" I tried to soothe him. \"My grandpa just said I was like him.\"\n\n\"You can't be like Thomas,\" Tommy shouted. He quickly ran toward a small room at the front of the play area.\n\n\"Tommy! Come back here,\" Matthew called to him, but the boy ran into the room and closed the door hard.\n\n\"Benjamin.\" Matthew looked at his helper. \"What's wrong with him today?\"\n\nBenjamin didn't know. \"He's probably on the computer checking Ethan out.\"\n\n\"Don't be too upset with him,\" I said. \"He doesn't know me.\"\n\n\"That kid's a lot to handle,\" Matthew said. \"Do you know much about kids?\"\n\n\"I know I like them,\" I said. \"I helped with a young sport program in BO city for a while.\"\n\n\"You did?\" Matthew said. \"Well how about helping out here for free? We could use you.\"\n\n\"Let me think about it,\" I was unsure.\n\nWe walked around the play area and talked about the BO P.A.L. program. It was a lot like the one in BO city, focusing on making a connection between the young people of the town and the police in their area. He gave me a paper. \"We do good things, Ethan,\" he said seriously.\n\nI agreed and looked at my clock. A long time had passed since I came to the playroom. \"I have to leave, Matthew,\" I said sorry. \"I have a big meeting close by.\" I said goodbye to Matthew and Benjamin. I was about to go when Thomas came back quickly. Thomas's face was pink, and his eyes were big. He held up a bunch of paper with words on it.\n\n\"Is that all about me?\" I asked, a bit scared.\n\nHe moved his head up and down. \"Me and the teacher found it,\" he said with pride and started to read slowly, like a small kid.\n\n\" 'Ethan, the best in MA state and NE area game in the early times, the best in MA state game a bit later.' \"\n\nHe looked at me. \"You did two bigger games at a young age. That's amazing.\"\n\n\" 'Did well,' you said,\" Benjamin laughed and touched my arm.\n\n\"Listen to this, Matthew,\" Thomas said. \"He had many wins, no lose, with many stops. That's awesome. Even a famous fighter lost a few games.\"\n\n\"The famous fighter played many times,\" I said. \"I was not a pro. \"You can't compare me to him, like you said.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry I said that,\" he apologized.\n\n\"It's okay,\" I said.\n\n\"I'm amazed,\" Matthew said, touching my back. \"That's a big achievement.\"\n\n\"I have more amazing things here,\" Thomas said.\n\n\"More amazing than an unbeaten achievement?\" Matthew asked.\n\n\"Much more amazing, right, Teacher?\" Thomas said.\n\n\"Right,\" the Teacher answered. He took some of the papers from Thomas. \"Listen to this,\" the Teacher began. \"Ethan received two nice awards, two awards for bravery, three awards for good work, and a Mayor's Praise.\"\n\n\"You were an excellent officer,\" Matthew said.\n\n\"It was a long time ago,\" I said.\n\n\"Officer Matthew, can I tell the other kids about Mr. Ethan?\" Thomas asked.\n\n\"Call me Ethan,\" I told him.\n\n\"Sure,\" Matthew said, and the kids were off and running.\n\n\"This is embarrassing,\" I said.\n\n\"You should be very proud of your record, Ethan.\"\n\n\"I can barely remember the things I did as a child,\" I said, checking my watch. \"Hey, I need to leave.\"\n\n\"Here's my card, Ethan. Call me anytime.\"\n\nI said \"thank you\" and put his card in my shirt. I began to walk towards the door.\n\n\"Hey Ethan,\" Thomas called to me. \"Hold on. The friends want to say hi.\"\n\n\"I'll come back,\" I said, but I really didn't know if I would.\n\nWhen I got back to my car, the empty lot was still there. The light from the afternoon was getting dim, and soon it would be night. I got a flashlight from my car and went through the bushes into the empty lot. I didn't see a door in the back. It was confusing. I had seen three people come from the back of the big building. I walked around looking for another way in. I didn't find anything until I got to the front. The lock on the front door was normal, and I could open it easily. I opened the door slowly. There was no alarm. I went inside and locked the door behind me.\n\nI was in a big room with only a counter in front of me and what seemed to be the back wall of the building. There was a small bathroom on my left, but the toilet and sink were gone. Trash and old parts were on the floor. I smelled something musty in the wet air. I walked to the back wall, turned my back to it, and looked around the room. The building seemed smaller from the inside than it did from the outside. Why? I looked at what happened.\n\nA lady who was really about middle-aged had made herself look like a very old lady and used a fake big-money note at a nearby store. She got a smaller amount of change and a free bag of food. It was a small crime. The lady then went to the help desk and cashed two checks. I thought they were fake and made for a lot of money. Before she did these things, the old-looking young lady made a loud noise. She did this to make people look at her, but not at what she was doing.\n\nConclusion: She knew what she was doing.\n\nMore things that happened: The lady then drove a short way to this building, went in, and came out from the back where there was no way in or out that I could see. I went into the building from the front and was now standing at the back. The building seemed smaller inside than it looked from outside.\n\nSecond conclusion: There was more to this building than I could see. There was definitely a back way in that I would find later, and there was another room behind the back wall I was standing against.\n\nI tapped the painted wall with my hand. It didn't take me long to figure out that the whole back wall was made of thin wall material. I moved back from the wall and kicked it hard with my right shoe. My foot went through the wall easily. I kept making holes in the wall until I could take off the whole board. There was a brick wall on the other side of the board.\n\nSo, the board wall was made to make it look like the whole building was one big room from the front door to the back wall. The brick wall was made to keep things safe.\n\nI took out my pocket knife, opened the biggest, strongest blade, and poked at the stuff between the bricks. It felt like dry oatmeal. Thank you, wet spots, and people who don't do good work. I chipped at the four sides of one brick. In just a few minutes, I was able to take out the whole brick from the wall. I put my flashlight in the hole. I couldn't see a lot. I had to take out more bricks. Forty-five minutes later, I was looking through a big hole into a room that looked like a doctor's office.\n\nMy flashlight lit up metal pots, plastic cups, and pipe-like tubes. I saw a warmer and other warm things on a table in the middle of the room. I shined the light around the room and saw computers, printers, metal cans, and stacked boxes. I pointed the light at the different boxes and read the words: cleaning stuff, smelly stuff, other cleaning stuff, more smelly stuff, and good erasers that people who make fake things often use. I walked through a small opening and found myself in a room.\n\nI knew about the different things there. They were used to make a bad medicine, that people often called by different names. This bad medicine was made from a certain thing. It was cheap to make but sold for a lot of money. The same things used to make this bad medicine could also be used to erase writing, like in making fake money.\n\nSuddenly the door that I couldn't see opened and two bad men pointed things at me that could make me go away forever. Behind them was a lady I had seen before. She didn't have anything pointed at me, but her looks were very scary.\n\nI was mad at myself for not being careful. I was not scared, though. I had been in danger before. I saw a box with things people use for smoking and something to light them with. Next to them were two cans with different things inside. I had everything I needed to start a fire.\n\n\"Who are you?\" the bigger man asked me in a strange accent.\n\nWhat could I possibly say that would make any difference? I said nothing.\n\n\"I said, who are you?\" someone asked.\n\n\"I heard you the first time, Benjamin,\" I replied.\n\n\"How do you know my name?\"\n\nUnder different situations, I might have thought that was very funny.\n\n\"Hold on,\" a lady said, moving nearer to me. \"I recognize you.\" She had a strange accent I hadn't noticed at the shop.\n\n\"No you don't. Many people think I look like a famous singer. That's probably why.\"\n\n\"No.\" She looked at my face. \"Not a famous singer.\" Then she remembered. \"You're the guy from the shop.\"\n\n\"What guy from the shop?\" a smaller man asked.\n\n\"He was in line behind me at the shop, Ryan.\"\n\n\"Actually, I was in line before you,\" I added.\n\n\"Why are you here?\" she questioned, ignoring my silly talk.\n\n\"You dropped your cereal. I was trying to give it back.\"\n\n\"What do we do with this guy?\" Benjamin asked. \"He's seen everything.\"\n\n\"Hey, no worries. All I saw was some strange items and a weird lab.\" I tried to cheer him up.\n\nBenjamin pointed something at my head and made a noise. \"I don't like you, meanie.\"\n\nI picked up the can of water from the table and held it in front of me. \"If you throw a stone into this can you're gonna make everyone here wet, Kevin.\"\n\n\"I'm not Kevin,\" he said defensively.\n\nThe lady put a hand on Benjamin's arm and had him lower the toy.\n\n\"What do you want, mister?\"\n\n\"Call me Ethan,\" I said.\n\n\"Okay, Ethan, what do you want?\"\n\n\"Right now I'd wish for leaving here safely.\"\n\n\"You a helper?\"\n\n\"No.\" I wasn't actually lying.\n\n\"What are you?\"\n\n\"I'm a not-working park ranger.\"\n\nBenjamin had heard enough. \"Adam, go take the silly can from this fool and tickle him. Then we'll take him for a nice long walk to nowhere.\"\n\nAdam stuck his toy in his pocket and walked toward me. He looked at me like I was his next playmate. But I had the water and the torch on my side. I quickly opened the cap of the water, and I splashed Adam with the cold liquid. He stopped.\n\n\"What the heck?\" Adam rubbed at his face. He let go of the fire stopper and held up his small toy gun. If he pretended to shoot me with that, I would have to pretend to fall down. Ben was puzzled when he saw me hiding behind my friend. \"Nora, wake up,\" he yelled to her. I slowly moved toward Ben, always keeping Nora in front of me. When he moved to one side to pretend to get a shot at me, I moved with him, always keeping Nora in the pretend target position. \n\n\"You're not brave,\" he said. \"Hiding behind a friend.\"\n\n\"Well, and you're hiding behind a toy gun. You put down your toy, and we'll play fair and square.\"\n\n\"I don't trust you.\"\n\n\"I don't care what you think. That's my best suggestion.\"\n\nHe squatted and put the toy gun on the floor. \"There, I put it down. Now let her go.\"\n\nI knew he had another toy hidden behind his back, but I really didn't mind.\n\n\"Okay brave boy, now move away from the toy.\"\n\nBen took a few steps back with his hands on his hips. He was making his move for the hidden toy. I gently pushed the sleeping Nora toward him. He didn't move to catch her, and she fell on the soft rug. I thought she was still pretending to be asleep.\n\nBenjamin didn't even look at her. The kindness from the FR country was gone. Benjamin was moving his hand behind his back when he saw that I was holding Nora's little toy in my hand.\n\n\"Now where did this come from?\" I asked.\n\n\"Forget your little toy,\" he laughed, making me curious about what big toy he had hidden behind his back.\n\nI decided not to wait to find out. I made three loud noises towards his right knee. His laughter changed to shouts. Personally I found his laughing more bothersome. He fell on his back then rolled onto his side holding his hurt knee. While he was squirming in pain, I picked up the toy he had left on the floor in front of him, and I pulled the other small toy from its hiding place in the back of his pants. \"You're lucky you didn't hurt yourself, Yuri.\"\n\n\"I'm Benjamin.\" He winced in pain.\n\n\"I'm Ethan. How are you?\"\n\nI felt dizzy and leaned against the wall for steadiness. I looked at my hurt shoulder. It didn't hurt much, but red liquid was coming out of the wound. I put a hand over the spot on my shoulder. I knew I couldn't stay up long with this much liquid coming out. I took out my toy phone from my pants pocket and the small card from my shirt pocket. I pressed one of the toy phone numbers on the card.\n\n\"Officer Matthew,\" he replied.\n\n\"Adam,\" I said in a small voice. \"Ethan P.\"\n\n\"Hi, Ethan, I didn't think I would hear from you so quickly. What's happening?\"\n\n\"My number.\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"I just got hurt, and I think it's really bad.\"\n\n\"Oh no, where are you?\"\n\n\"Next door.\"\n\n\"In the place where they clean stuff?\"\n\n\"No,\" I struggled to speak. I was finding it hard to stay awake. \"Listen, Adam, go outside the gym. Okay.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" I heard him running. \"I'm outside, Ethan.\"\n\n\"Do you see the building in the next space?\"\n\n\"Through the trees?\"\n\n\"Yes. Go through the bushes to the back of that building. The back door is open, but I don't want you to come in. I'll come out.\" I could hear him running again.\n\n\"Why can't I come in?\"\n\n\"I stopped a bad person,\" I said. \"We don't want them to say we didn't follow the rules. Call for more help, Adam. Tell them to come with permission for this place.\"\n\n\"But they hurt you.\" Adam was breathing hard. \"I can go in.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" I said. \"Just don't take the risk.\"\n\nIn a little while, Adam was at the back door.\n\n\"Oh, dear,\" he shouted as he looked around.\n\nAdam was in pain from his burns, Ben was moving side to side holding his injured knee. Bella was still asleep.\n\n\"Don't come in,\" I told him. \"Make a phone call, Matthew.\" I leaned against the wall.\n\nMatthew made a phone call for help and more people. Then he called the sports place and Cameron arrived in a few minutes carrying cloths. Matthew pressed a cloth hard against my injury.\n\n\"Who are these people?\" Cameron asked.\n\n\"The man I made hot is Adam. The man I hurt in the knee over there is Ben. The girl I made sleep is Bella.\"\n\n\"What's happening here?\" Matthew asked.\n\n\"It's a normal house,\" I said. \"They make their own pretend money then make some happy candy to celebrate.\"\n\n\"You're joking,\" Cameron said.\n\n\"Do I look like I'm joking?\" I asked, and then I fell asleep.\n\n## CHAPTER 1\n\nYOU GIVE! YOU STOP!\n\nI was almost awake. I had no idea what time it was, what day it was, or where I was. I remembered being hurt by a girl named Bella. I had water tubes in my arms, a breath tube in my nose, and a tube in my body. I thought I was in a place where doctors work. People who take care of the sick were always checking on me. A very pretty nurse with brown skin, who made me think of a girl named Hannah, was near me, and I told her I liked her a lot. When I had to use the bathroom, I did, but I didn't know how it happened. A man named Jack didn't talk at all. I think he was surprised.\n\nThe next time I was able to open my eyes, I could keep them open, but I couldn't see very well. My eyes felt like they were covered with something slippery. I saw a window and thought it was night time outside. I saw two men near my bed, looking at me. One of them was talking in a loud voice, but I couldn't hear him well. I thought I heard, \"You give. You go away.\" I heard this, but I wasn't sure if he was saying \"You get\" or \"You go away.\" Maybe he was saying both things. The man next to him smiled and didn't say anything. The words \"You go away!\" became louder and more clear. Who were these men who kept telling me I was going to give and go away? There were some bad people who wanted to hurt me when I lived in a place called BO city. But now I was in a place called BC town, and I didn't work anymore. Who would want to hurt me in BC town? Maybe Adam, Benjamin, or Nora would like to hurt me, but they couldn't be in my room. Adam was a quiet fire, and Benjamin had a big boo-boo on his knee. There was no way either could be standing at the foot of my bed now, unless I had been sleeping for a very long time.\n\n\"You go! You sleep!\" There it was again.\n\n_Well no thank you,_ I said to myself, because I still couldn't speak. _I'm not going to lie here and wait for you two to scare me!_\n\nWith all the strength I could find, I sat up, moved my legs over the side of the bed, and jumped towards the two people. The little tubes were pulled from my arms, and the air tube flew out of my nose. I felt the tube come out of my belly button.\n\n_What happened?_ I heard my belly button say.\n\nI felt something hard and pointy against my head. I tripped and fell forward. I heard that deep voice tell me again, \"You sleep,\" and this time I agreed with him. At least I had tried to fight like a brave boy. Thomas the big boy and the teacher would be proud of me. _Good-bye, everyone,_ I thought. _Good-bye belly button,_ I said to my best friend. Everything went dark.\n\nI opened my eyes and felt a lot of discomfort. My arms were sore, and my nose felt like it was hurt. I didn't want to think about going to the bathroom. The sunshine let me know it was daytime. But I didn't know which day it was. My bed was surrounded by worried faces. Two nurses looked worried. The doctor checking me with a listening tool looked worried too. Benjamin and Matthew looked worried, and so did Thomas. Isaac was there too.\n\n\"Nice to see you awake,\" Isaac said. \"We were scared.\"\n\n\"Did you find those bad guys?\" I asked.\n\n\"What bad guys?\" Matthew asked.\n\n\"The two bad guys in my room last night.\"\n\n\"Mr. Patrick,\" the kind nurse said, smiling, \"I was the first one in your room last night after you fell. I didn't see anyone. I just saw you on the floor.\"\n\n\"You didn't hear those two men?\"\n\n\"No,\" the nurse said.\n\n\"There were two guys right there.\" I pointed to the end of the bed. \"One was telling me I was going to be in trouble, and I was going to get hurt.\"\n\n\"You must have been dreaming,\" Isaac tried to convince me.\n\n\"Dreaming, no way,\" I said quickly. \"I could see and hear them, just like I'm seeing and hearing you now. I jumped out of bed and went after them.\"\n\nThe doctor was wrapping a band around my arm. \"Well, you're not going to give money, and you're not going to be gone,\" the doctor said.\n\n\"How do you know that?\" I asked.\n\n\"Your money helper will cover everything, so you don't have to give money. And you're not going to be gone because you're in surprisingly good health for a man who had a hurt last night and then fell out of bed.\"\n\n\"I've only been here one night?\" I was surprised.\n\n\"That's it,\" the doctor confirmed. \"The officer and his friend brought you in a big car with a siren last night. If they weren't so quick getting you here, after some good first help, you could have been very hurt.\"\n\nI smiled thankfully at Adam and Matthew.\n\n\"As soon as we refilled your tank, you were safe,\" the young doctor continued. \"How old are you, Mr. Patrick?\" I told him I was old. \"You're in great shape for your age; probably helped save your life.\"\n\n\"How old are you, Doctor?\"\n\n\"Little more than thirty,\" he told me.\n\nI laughed.\n\n\"What's so funny?\"\n\n\"The first time I got hurt, you were in small clothes.\"\n\n\"Baby clothes,\" he corrected me. He took off the thing that checks your body's thump-thump. \"Anyway, you're going to feel very ouchy. You pulled all the tubes out of your body when you fell from the bed. I can't think about how your pee-pee must be feeling now.\"\n\n_You're right_, Mr. Jack muttered.\n\n\"And I didn't fall from the bed,\" I said. \"I left the bed to chase those two boys.\"\n\n\"If you say so.\" He tapped my arm. \"Anyway, you're a known man now.\"\n\n\"Known for what?\"\n\n\"I'll let your buddies tell you all about it.\" He shook my hand. \"Good work last night,\" he praised me, and left.\n\nI looked at my new buddies. \"Okay, known for what?\" I asked.\n\nAdam said, \"Well, I can promise you it's not for falling from the bed and nearly hurting your pee-pee.\" He giggled, and everyone joined him, including the little one.\n\nAdam gave me a copy of the local _PB Town News._ An old picture of me with the whole story of the catch on Second Street was the first news.\n\n\"How did they get the story and that picture of me?\" I was shocked.\n\n\"Modern tools. This was a big mistake, Ethan,\" Matthew said.\n\n\"It was? I thought we just caught a mom and dad operation.\"\n\n\"Nope.\" Matthew shook his head. \"These guys were part of a big bad group.\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" I said.\n\n\"What's the problem?\" Matthew wanted to know.\n\n\"I'm supposed to be resting now.\"\n\n\"Well, you're a resting hero now,\" Matthew said.\n\n\"It's just a small story isn't it?\" I asked.\n\n\"I'm afraid not,\" Matthew said. \"The big news has the story. By tomorrow afternoon your story will be in newspapers everywhere.\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" I said.\n\n\"It's starting already,\" Michael said. \"Tom called me this morning and said your story had made the front page of a famous paper.\"\n\n\"Oh no.\" I couldn't think of anything else to say.\n\n## Chapter 12\n\nCaught in CA city\n\nFormer Police Catches Bad People\n\n_Resting City Police Officer  \nHurt in Fight_\n\nThe _PB City News_ headline made the events on a street sound exciting using words like \"great police work\" and \"brave and fearless action.\" A story was made in BO town. The writing also told about my work in the BO town police, including the awards I got.\n\nThe writing said how I saved a little girl who was locked in a car by her mom on a hot summer day in the NO city. I couldn't open the car door, and I was scared to break a window, thinking the glass might hurt the baby. I knew I had to do something quick. Walking around the car, I remembered that I saw a car window taken off a police car at the fix shop not too long ago. I thought of what the fix man did, took off the car window, and got the baby out in a few minutes. I got a medal for doing good. That was a long time ago, and the baby I saved was now a mom without a husband living with help from the government in EA city. Her sad, old story, though, would be a new \"feel good\" story for _PB County News_ readers today.\n\n\"They wrote everything about me in here,\" I said to the group.\n\n\"It's the time of knowing a lot,\" Matthew said.\n\nMy friends left within an hour and the nice, brown-skinned nurse came to check on me.\n\n\"Can you do me a favor?\" I asked her.\n\n\"If I can.\"\n\n\"Can you make sure I don't get any more calls today?\" I knew that a lot of calls from favorite friends, excited reporters, bothersome people, and rude callers would be coming soon. I had been in big events before and I wasn't feeling ready to deal with that much attention.\n\n\"I'll try to help,\" she said. \"Now let's get you up.\"\n\nShe helped me out of bed and led me to a comfy chair. It felt nice to move. I looked at her name tag: Charlotte--HA country.\n\n\"Thank you, Charlotte.\" I looked out the window at the lake way below. \"When did you leave HA country?\" I was making small talk.\n\n\"A long time ago,\" she told me.\n\n\"You were just a child.\"\n\n\"I'm not as young as I look,\" Charlotte said. \"I'm older than you think.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"What woman would lie about her age by saying she's older?\"\n\n\"Especially here,\" I agreed. \"Well, you look much younger.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" she said.\n\n\"Do you have any family here?\"\n\n\"Just my grandma.\"\n\n\"No brothers or sisters?\"\n\n\"I had a younger sister,\" she said. \"But she passed away some time ago.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said. \"Was she not feeling well?\" \n\n\"In some way,\" Charlotte said. \"She was not using her medicine correctly and it made her very sick.\" \n\n\"What about your mom and dad?\" \n\n\"They never left the HA country.\"\n\n\"Are they still here with us?\" \n\n\"They were hurt a long time ago.\"\n\n\"That's not good,\" I said. \"What happened?\"\n\n\"My dad was a man from LO city. My mom was a teacher from HA country. They were involved in important matters. They got hurt because of those matters.\"\n\n\"Who was leading in HA country then?\"\n\n\"I'd prefer not to talk about it.\"\n\n\"That's okay,\" I said. \"How did you leave the island?\"\n\n\"I don't want to talk about that, either.\"\n\n\"That's alright, no issue,\" I said. \"How old is your grandma?\"\n\n\"She says she is very old,\" she said. \"But no one knows for sure. All her important papers were left behind.\"\n\n\"Is she feeling good?\"\n\n\"Very good,\" Charlotte said. \"She just started using a tool to help her walk, but apart from that she's fine. She lives in DE city near me. Her name's Queen. She says she is related to Henry, the only king of HA country.\"\n\n\"Is she?\"\n\n\"Maybe. Who knows?\" We smiled at each other. \"The little boy who visited you today thinks you're a hero.\"\n\n\"Actually I remind him of someone who was a hero of his,\" Adam said.\n\n\"I read about you in the story, Ethan,\" Charlotte said. \"A boy could choose a worse hero.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\" Adam changed the subject. \"Did anyone ever tell you that you look just like--\"\n\n\"A famous movie star,\" she interrupted Adam.\n\n\"I guess you've heard that before.\"\n\n\"Only from people who are not feeling well.\"\n\n\"That's not fair,\" Adam protested. \"You do look like her.\"\n\n\"I guess,\" she said. \"We're both half brown and half white.\"\n\n\"Obviously a good combination,\" Adam commented.\n\n\"A famous leader is half brown and half white.\"\n\n\"I think you're much prettier than him.\"\n\nShe laughed. \"A famous educator was half brown and half white.\"\n\n\"He's not my type.\"\n\n\"How about a famous actor?\" she tried. \"He's from many different places.\"\n\n\"You're still my favorite.\"\n\n\"What about people from GE country?\" she asked.\n\n\"Actually, my family were from RU country ... . . without the drinks.\"\n\n\"Perlmutter is a name from GE country.\"\n\n\"Yes. It means 'white pearl' in GE country language. \"But we're from a far place. I'm sure of that.\"\n\n\"Can you tell about your family from the far place?\"\n\n\"I knew my daddy's parents,\" I said. \"My mommy's mommy got very sick and passed away. Her daddy was hurt in the old place.\"\n\n\"Why was he hurt?\"\n\n\"Because of what he believed,\" I said.\n\n\"That's sad,\" she said.\n\n\"Sad and not good,\" I agreed.\n\nI saw two young girls looking into my room. They waved to me a little shy. I waved back. Charlotte walked to the door.\n\n\"Hello, girls,\" Charlotte said in a nice way.\n\n\"You're Ethan, aren't you?\" the taller girl asked me as she walked a little into the room.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said with a smile. She had a nice smile too. \"What can I do for you?\"\n\nCharlotte looked at the ceiling and left the room.\n\n\"Bye, Charlotte,\" I called after her, and she waved without looking back.\n\n\"A lady who helps people told us you were here. We thought we'd just look. We're here to visit our daddy in the room next door.\"\n\nI felt okay. \"Nothing bad I hope.\"\n\n\"Very bad,\" she answered with a sad face. \"He is very sick.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. What sickness?\"\n\n\"A very bad kind, I'm afraid. Do you know much about sickness?\" she asked.\n\n\"I know a little,\" I said. \"My mother was sick a long time ago.\"\n\n\"My father is sick,\" she told me.\n\n\"I've never heard of that,\" I said. \"It sounds bad.\"\n\n\"Bad is the right word for it,\" she said, walking into the room until she was standing next to me. She held out her hand. \"I'm Daisy,\" she introduced herself, \"and this is my sister Bella.\" They said hello nicely.\n\n\"I'm Ethan,\" I introduced myself. \"What's your father's name?\"\n\n\"David,\" Daisy told me.\n\n\"Well someone likes him a lot,\" I commented.\n\n\"Why do you say that?\"\n\n\"The name David means a 'child of God'.\"\n\n\"We know.\" Bella spoke for the first time. \"Do you speak another language?\"\n\n\"No. Just a few words and sentences,\" I said. \"I was a helper in a different neighborhood.\"\n\n\"His middle name is Matthew,\" Daisy told me. \"Do you know what that means?\"\n\n\"Sure. Matthew means 'peace and friendship.' What a nice name. David: a child of God, a peaceful man, and a good friend.\"\n\n\"He is all those things,\" Lily said with pride and sadness. \"It's just not right for him to be so unwell.\"\n\n\"Life's not always fair,\" I agreed.\n\nThey both nodded.\n\n\"So, Officer Patrick.\" Rachel changed the topic. \"Tell us what happened to you yesterday.\"\n\n\"I'd rather talk about your dad.\"\n\nA kind-looking middle-aged woman appeared at my door. She was holding a copy of a local newspaper under her arm. She knew who I was, and I didn't have to ask who she was. The resemblance between mother and daughters was very strong.\n\n\"I was wondering where you two had gone,\" she said to the girls. \"I should have known you'd be in here with the local hero.\"\n\n\"Is Dad okay?\" Rachel asked.\n\n\"He's sleeping,\" she told them. She looked at me. \"Are they bothering you?\"\n\n\"Kind people never bother me, Mrs. Amici. Please come in.\"\n\n\"Call me Carol,\" she said, entering the room. \"I suppose they've asked you all kinds of questions already?\"\n\n\"No they haven't.\" I defended the sisters. \"In fact, they were just about to tell me a story about a good friend of theirs.\"\n\n\"Who could that be?\"\n\n\"Their daddy,\" I said.\n\nShe smiled at her daughters. \"Can I listen too?\" asked Charlotte as she sat in a chair near me. Her daughters sat down too, and we made a circle. \"Who wants to go first?\" I asked.\n\nThe girls of David started to tell me about his life, and their long fight to help him. Their grandma, Alice, who was very small, had always been healthy and fell asleep forever when she was very old. Sadly, her youngest boy, sixty-six-year-old David, did not get her strong body. Two years after she left, David fell down while playing a game. Tests showed that David had a really bad sickness in his blood.\n\nThe first thing the family thought was, \"This can't be true.\"\n\nDavid can't be sick.\n\nLook at him.\n\nHe's very tall and big.\n\nHe can't get sick.\n\nMore doctors and more tests said the same thing.\n\nThe family was very angry.\n\nWhy him?\n\nWhy us?\n\nIt's not right!\n\nBut then they decided to fight hard against David's sickness. They found out early on that his sickness was very bad and did not let anyone win. In a usual way of living, old cells would go away and new cells would take their place. But a sickness called myeloid leukemia made things go wrong. Bad cells showed up when they weren't needed. They grew faster than good cells and hurt them. Soon, the body's protection system got weak and the person got very sick.\n\n\"I remember when my mom had a sickness called multiple myeloma,\" I said, \"She got very bad lumps because of all the bad cells gathering in her body.\"\n\n\"There are no lumps with myeloid leukemia,\" Alice told me. \"But the sickness hurts everything.\"\n\n\"My mom got very sick twenty years ago. There must be new ways to help people by now.\"\n\nAlice looked sad. \"There are a lot of new ways. They just didn't work for David.\"\n\nThey told me about their year-long journey with special cell transplants. They had taken David to the GA Hospital in GA city, which is known for these treatments. David's help started with a lot of medicines meant to get rid of the bad cells. These medicines also hurt good cells, and made David very easy to get sick. He had to stay alone for months to keep him from getting a cold or something. Alice talked about the sad and hard times she and David had during those months.\n\nThe doctors couldn't find a good cell donor for David, and without a transplant, the medicines would actually make him get sicker faster. Finally, they found some special blood cells that could help David. They tried to help him with the cells, but it didn't work. The doctors told Adam's family they couldn't help him anymore. David was very tired from the treatments. The doctors thought he was too tired to go back home.\n\n\"That was a little while ago,\" Lisa said, shaking her head. \"He's still here, and he's still trying.\"\n\n\"Wow,\" was all I could say.\n\n\"He really thinks he can get better,\" Carol said. \"He walks a little bit and does exercises with his helper. He won't stop trying.\"\n\n\"He sounds like a great kid,\" I said. \"I hope I can meet him.\"\n\nCarol looked sad again. \"I hope so, too.\"\n\n\"Let's talk about something else,\" Lisa said, pointing at me. \"Tell us your story. Everyone is talking about you.\"\n\n\"The big story will have to wait,\" Charlotte said from the door. \"Mrs. Adam's family, girls, Mr. Adam is awake and not happy. Mr. Patrick, you have nine messages, and I'm not answering any more.\" She walked into the room and dropped a bunch of pink papers on my lap. \"I turned on your phone. Answer it yourself.\"\n\nCharlotte and her daughters walked to the door. \"You got off easy today,\" Lily told me. \"Next time.\"\n\n\"He's probably not going to be here for a next time,\" Charlotte said. \"He's being released soon. Oh, and Mr. Nice, you have a visitor outside. I told her you weren't seeing anyone, but she asked if I would let you know she was here.\"\n\n\"She's not a news lady, is she?\"\n\n\"She doesn't look like a news lady,\" Charlotte said. \"Says her name's Alice Fine.\"\n\n\"I know Alice Fine,\" Charlotte said. \"From BH place.\"\n\n\"That's where I met her,\" I explained.\n\n\"She's a very nice person,\" Charlotte noted.\n\n\"Well, do you want to see this very nice person from BH place or should I send her away?\" Charlotte sounded impatient.\n\n\"Nurse Patricia, are you jealous of all my lady visitors?\"\n\n\"Don't think too highly of yourself, Ethan.\" She put her hands on her hips. \"I don't care if you are a star. To me you're just another patient.\"\n\n\"Now that hurts.\" I covered myself with both hands.\n\n\"Now, don't do it again,\" she said with a small smile.\n\n\"You can trust me,\" I said. \"I'd like to see Mrs. Fiona if that's okay.\"\n\n\"Sure, bring her here,\" Mr. Jack said.\n\nCharlotte waved from the door. \"See you later,\" she said, and they all left.\n\nI heard Fiona talking nicely with Charlotte and her daughters outside my room. Then, Fiona was at my door.\n\n## CHAPTER 13\n\nSHE'S SO NICE\n\nFiona looked great.\n\n\"Hello,\" she said. Her smile was shy. \"Is this a bad time?\"\n\n\"No, not at all,\" I said. \"Please come in.\"\n\nI watched her walk to me and I wished I could stop the time. She looked wonderful. Her light-brown hair was cut short in a nice way, and it looked good on her pretty face that still had its original nose and lips. She looked nice and Mr. Jack felt happy even after his medical trouble. I adjusted my robe over Mr. Jack to keep him calm.\n\n\"Hey,\" Mr. Jack said, \"be nice.\"\n\n\"Be good,\" I told him.\n\nMrs. Fiona sat on a chair next to my bed. I smiled at her, hoping she didn't notice my nervousness.\n\n_Hey, you don't tell me what to do,_ Adam protested, still trying to get up. _I can think for myself._\n\n_I know. But not now, please .. . ._\n\n_If not now, when?_ Adam quoted a wise person. _Look at her._\n\n_I'm looking, I'm looking._ I tried to look away, but Adam wouldn't let me.\n\n_Look at her nice dress._\n\n_I'm looking._\n\n_And her pretty hair._\n\n_I noticed._\n\n_I think we should say hello._\n\n_Please, let's be respectful._\n\n_That's just how I am. Come on, let's meet her!_\n\n_I'd rather not._\n\n_Are you embarrassed?_\n\n_I'm not,_ I told him. _But it's not the right time._\n\n_Sure it is!_\n\n_Oh dear!_\n\n_You're mixing me up with the silly person behind us._\n\n_Will you be quiet?_\n\n_When I'm quiet, it's like you're not here._\n\n\"Are you okay?\" Alice asked. \"You seem deep in thought.\"\n\n_Darn, she wants to talk,_ Adam said, and he hid like a turtle in its shell.\n\nI knew the little guy would be back sooner or later. \"I'm good, Miss Fiona,\" I said. \"It's nice of you to visit.\"\n\n\"I tried calling you on your phone. Matthew gave me your number.\"\n\n\"He told me.\"\n\n\"Did you get my note?\"\n\n\"I haven't looked at my notes. I was a bit busy.\"\n\n\"Clearly you were busy,\" she giggled. Her teeth were perfect. Adam moved a little but I crossed my legs and the tube gave him a hurtful pull.\n\n_Be careful,_ he warned me. _I'm a little stuck here._\n\n\"What was your note?\" I said, not paying attention to Adam.\n\n\"I wanted to say thank you for helping me yesterday. It was a scary time for me.\"\n\n\"A scary time is living in a small house by the side of a big road,\" I said.\n\nShe moved her head to the side. \"Pardon me.\" She looked confused. \"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said. \"I'm a little confused. Listen, you don't have to thank me, I was just doing what I do.\"\n\n\"Well you did a good job,\" she told me. \"Matthew dismissed Madison like you said he should, and I was declared the best because I was winning when she quit.\"\n\n\"That's smart thinking on Matthew's part. Well done.\"\n\n\"He told me it was your idea.\"\n\n\"Matthew talks too much.\"\n\n\"Well thank you for being there for me.\"\n\n_I'm right here for you too, buddy_. Mr. Jack was back.\n\nI squeezed my legs together and crushed the bug between my thighs.\n\n\"My pleasure,\" I said quietly, clearing my throat.\n\n_Mine, too_. Mr. Jack was muffled but still playful. I cut off his air with a hard squeeze.\n\n_Ouch,_ he mumbled.\n\n\"I heard you left your work at BH place.\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"You did nothing wrong.\"\n\n\"I don't belong there.\"\n\n\"I thought you fit in quite well.\" She smiled. \"People liked you.\"\n\n\"People hardly noticed me.\"\n\n\"I noticed you,\" she said, looking directly at me.\n\n\"With all due respect, Mrs. Fiona, you notice everyone. You're a very nice person.\"\n\n\"I noticed you in particular.\"\n\n\"That's because I'm so tall, dark, and handsome.\"\n\nWe laughed together. \"Actually, it was your hurt nose that first got my attention.\"\n\n\"I have a hurt nose?\" I touched my nose. \"When did that happen?\"\n\nWe laughed again. \"It probably happened when you were a fighter in the big competition.\"\n\n\"How did you know about that?\"\n\n\"It was in the news. Everything about you was in the news. You've had a very fun life, and it seems like the fun never stops.\"\n\n\"That's me, all right. Mr. Fun,\" I joked. \"I think problems just follow me around.\"\n\n\"Or you look for problems,\" she suggested with that nice smile of hers.\n\nWe were actually joking, and Mr. Jack knew it, but to his credit he remained calm.\n\n\"I read you lost your wife.\"\n\nI nodded. \"I heard you lost your husband.\"\n\n\"I didn't lose him. He told me to go away.\"\n\n\"How long were you married?\"\n\n\"Many years. Two kids, one married. I have two grandchildren.\"\n\n_You're joking!_ Mr. Jack was surprised. _I've been standing up straight and saluting a grandmother._\n\n\"You don't look old enough to be a grandmother.\"\n\n\"I'm older than you think,\" she said. \"I was very young when I got married. I was a mother soon after and again the next year. My daughter is grown up, with a boy and a girl of her own. \"My son is still not married,\" she said.\n\n\"You look nice. Why did your husband go away?\" I asked.\n\n\"He said I lost something over time,\" she replied.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"My young days,\" she said. \"He married a woman who looks just like I did a long time ago.\"\n\n\"He married a woman who is not old?\" I was surprised. \"He must not be thinking right. What will they talk about?\" I stopped. \"Wait. That's not a good question.\"\n\n\"Actually, it's a smart question,\" she said. \"You're clever for a police person.\"\n\nI noticed we laughed easily. She asked me to call her Alice.\n\nAlice's visit lasted until late in the day. I didn't answer several calls while she was there and I think she was happy.\n\nWe talked a bit about Penny because Alice asked. \"Do you still miss her after so long?\"\n\nI told her I did.\n\n\"Is that why you didn't marry again?\" she asked.\n\nI told her I hadn't found someone I wanted to marry.\n\n\"It must be nice to love someone so much,\" she thought out loud.\n\nI told her it was nice, but it also hurt.\n\n\"It hurts when someone you love goes away for any reason,\" she said.\n\nI told her I thought the pain of someone not wanting you was worse than the pain of someone dying. \"Passing away is never a personal thing. It's random. Being left out is when you're not picked at all, and that's very personal.\"\n\nThen I said we should chat about something else.\n\nShe asked if I had gone out with many women since Penelope passed, and I shared that I had. She asked about my friendships, and I again suggested that we discuss something different. She asked if I would share about my job.\n\nI spoke about whatever popped into my head. I spoke about my sports, my mom and dad, my grandma and grandpa, my middle name, my bad mood, and my forever wish to be a police officer. I told her about the WE area and how it was ruined by leaders. I shared how I hurt Gabriel, even though he lived thirty more years after I upset him. I spoke about the NO area and the folks who lived there. I shared stories about the tricky guys in BO town and how they became important men. I told her about the first time I was hurt, on the first day of required bus rides in SO city in the late 20th century.\n\nShe was intrigued by my recounting of the commotion of white-IR country folks in \"SO city\" when buses carrying different-colored students arrived in front of SO city school in the late 20th century. \"I saw this grown-up in the crowd take a toy gun out of his coat pocket. He was showing it to a buddy and pointing a finger at the students. He wasn't pointing the toy at anyone, and I decided I wasn't going to give him the chance. I ran into the group and caught him. In the tussle, the toy made a sound and I got a little hurt on my left leg.\"\n\nShe said \"Oh my goodness\" to my story.\n\n_You're telling the truth,_ Mr. Jack remembered. _A little to the right, and I could have been really scared. The twins, too._\n\nShe wanted to know what happened to the man with the toy.\n\n\"Not a lot,\" I told her. \"It was a mistake, and he had a pass for the toy.\"\n\n\"Why were they going on a big bus in BO city?\" Miss Alice asked suddenly with interest, and I wanted to give her a friendly kiss. It wasn't a grown-up feeling. It was a \"thank you for being here, thank you for caring, thank you for being so nice, thank you, thank you, thank you.\"\n\n\"Going on a big bus didn't start in BO city,\" I explained. \"NC country was the first to need big buses, a long time ago. In the next year, the big decision-makers said NC country was right, and going on big buses became the new thing. It didn't come to SO city until a little later.\"\n\n\"Why SO city?\"\n\n\"SO city was as unfair as you could get,\" I explained. \"The area was nearly all white and mostly IR country.\" It was a very close, very tough place.\"\n\n\"Whose idea was it to go there?\"\n\n\"An important man named Ulysses.\"\n\n\"He couldn't have been too smart.\"\n\n\"He was a smart school graduate, chosen by Liam.\"\n\n\"I don't care. It seems like he made a big silly choice.\"\n\n\"He did,\" I agreed. \"Ulysses told many kids to go away from their neighborhood schools. It was crazy. At some point there were many police looking after many students at South Town School. In a time long ago, South Town was like a place in the south.\"\n\nShe asked what happened.\n\n\"It took a very long time for the bus program to end.\"\n\n\"Why did it stop?\"\n\n\"Because everyone could see it wasn't working,\" I said. \"It was a big mistake. It never should have begun.\"\n\n\"It seemed like a good idea,\" she said.\n\n\"Isn't there an old saying about good ideas?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" She smiled. \" 'The path to bad is paved with good ideas.' \"\n\n\"Exactly.\" I gave back her smile so she wouldn't feel embarrassed. \"I like equal rights. I promised to uphold these rules and I did. But the bus program took away as many rights as it tried to protect. Busing made white families in a small community take their children from their local school and send them to a school across the town where they didn't want to go. Then a bus full of black children came to the small community to replace the white children who just left. What did they think would happen? Busing wasn't the solution.\"\n\n\"What was the solution?\"\n\n\"I'm just a police officer, Alice,\" I said. \"I didn't have a solution then and I don't have one now. I just knew something needed to change.\"\n\n\"What happened to Judge Gabriel?\"\n\n\"He passed away in the late 20th century, around the same time busing stopped,\" I told her. \"But the people of the small community will never forgive him.\"\n\nShe asked me about the second time I was hurt and the third time just recently. I told her it was time to talk about her. She said there wasn't a lot to say, but I insisted. It was early in the afternoon, and the sky was dark with clouds. It started to rain heavily, and big drops hit and splashed against the window. I felt sleepy and tried to keep my eyes open. \"Can I go back to bed?\" I asked.\n\n\"I should leave,\" she said. \"You need to rest.\"\n\n\"No. \"Don't leave.\"\n\nOnce I was all tucked in with her help, she sat by my side on the bed. She softly touched my face with her hand. \"You need to sleep.\"\n\nI held her hand. \"Can you tell me a story?\" I asked.\n\n\"You're like a little kid, Ethan.\" She smiled at me. \"Alright, let's start. Once upon a time in a place very, very far from this FR country--\"\n\n\"What's this FR country?\"\n\n\"It's not important. Just listen and relax.\"\n\nAs I started to drift off, she told me about an island filled with giant castles high above a big ocean. These castles were for King Benjamin of Colours, King Henry of Money, King Matthew of Shops, and other \"kings\" of that time.\n\nThe big houses had names: Hill, Garden, House, Cliff, Nest, and Home. The pretend Great Gabriel lived in the pretend place of WE city on this golden coast. Daisy, Gabriel's friend, also lived in WE city. Gabriel was great because he had a lot but he was hurt by a man who had nothing.\n\nAdam, a man called \"the King of NE city,\" had everything except friends. Kevin was a banker in NE city a long time ago. He lived in MO town, but when the people in MO town were unkind to him, he moved to CO town. In CO town, he built a very big house, second only to a house built by Victor.\n\nAs time went by, more people moved to the gold coast. There were many towns filled with families. Princess Alice was born to King Henry and Queen Emma on a winter's day. Alice was their third child and their only girl. Her older brother, Samuel, would one day lead a car business in NE state. Alice's other brother, Matthew, chose to become a carpenter in CO city. Alice, of course, married a prince.\n\nThe Henry's house in CO town had a name. It was called \"the big house\" by locals and \"the very big house\" by visitors. The Henry house was not as grand as Kevin's, but it was still a wonderful example of wealth.\n\nPrincess Alice was the nicest in the land. The people of the kingdom liked her because she was kind and thoughtful. Princess Alice was \"Queen of the Party\" her last year in private school. The \"King of the Party\" was Adam, the equally good-looking, but not nearly as rich, son of smaller nobility. They were the perfect pair.\n\nPrincess Alice and Prince Adam were always together. They went to YU University together. The princess was loyal only to her prince. Sadly, the prince was also loyal only to the prince. When they married, she gave her all to him. His promise wasn't as strong. They ran away and married during their second year at YU when she was only nineteen. She married the one she loved. He married for the love of her way of life.\n\nKing Henry and Queen Emma held a wonderful wedding for the pair, even though they had run away. Alice had a baby a year later, and her studying at YU was paused. Adam went to YU Law School where he made YU Law & Policy Review and passed the exam on the first try. By the time they had two kids, he had had two affairs. She was happy. He was not. They stayed married for a long time, but they did not live happily ever after.\n\n\"Mr. Patrick,\" I heard my name. \"Mr. Patrick, wake up.\"\n\nI opened my eyes. The princess was gone. A nurse was standing above me.\n\n\"Mr. Patrick, your grandson is here,\" she said. I smiled at her.\n\n_How nice,_ I thought. Then I remembered I didn't have a grandson.\n\nI sat up in bed and saw Thomas. He looked like a wet puppy. His curly hair was wet and flat on his head. His clothes hung from his small body like he had been playing in water. \"Thomas, what are you doing here?\"\n\n\"I came to look after you, in case those two boys from yesterday came back,\" he said, and then he sneezed.\n\n\"How did you get here?\" I asked.\n\n\"I walked.\"\n\n\"How far?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I started when the sun was high in the sky.\"\n\nI looked at the clock. It was bedtime. I had been sleeping for a little while. \"You walked for a long time?\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"I guess.\"\n\n\"Does anyone know you're here?\"\n\nHe shook his head, _no_. He looked like he was going to fall asleep. I asked the nurse who was working to check his temperature. I called Officer Matthew. Matthew was happy to hear that Thomas was with me. His new mom and dad had already told others he was gone. The helper said to me the boy had a fever of 101. Matthew said he would call the new mom and dad and come right over. Just then the boy fell on the floor.\n\nMatthew and I made the hospital staff let Thomas into the hospital that night. We made a promise that said we were fully in charge of him. Thomas was put safely into the empty bed in my room. He was very tired and thirsty. Thomas's new home, I was told, was over seven big steps away. I wondered why the boy decided to walk such a long way in a rainstorm, in the dark.\n\nThey gave Thomas water through a tube and medicine for his fever. Matthew and I watched him. Matthew wouldn't look away from the boy.\n\n\"You like him, don't you?\" I said to Matthew.\n\nMatthew made a sound. \"Yeah, I like him a lot. But I'm worried about him. The boy needs a dad.\"\n\n\"What about you?\" I wasn't joking.\n\n\"I've thought about it.\" Matthew's answer didn't surprise me. \"My whole family loves him. I love the boy, too. But I'm having trouble getting enough food now. I couldn't afford another mouth to feed.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" I said while yawning.\n\nThey gave me another pain pill, and I fell asleep before Matthew left the room.\n\nWith Thomas there to keep me safe, the two bad guys did not come back that night.\n\nIn the morning Thomas looked much better, and I felt much better too. When they took the tube out of Mr. Jack he felt much better. We were checked and found ready to go. We were given breakfast.\n\n\"Thomas, why did you come here last night?\" I asked.\n\nHe just shrugged and didn't look at me.\n\n\"You could have been hit by a car or something,\" I warned him.\n\nHe shrugged again and he looked up at me. \"I tried to call lots of times but no one picked up,\" he explained. \"So I got worried.\"\n\nI remembered the constant ringing of the phone yesterday while I was under the spell of Alice. He was worried, and now I was worried too.\n\n\"You know, Thomas,\" I said softly, \"I'm not Benjamin.\"\n\n\"You're my Benjamin,\" Thomas said.\n\nIt was the second time in my life someone said that to me. The first time I felt proud when my grandpa praised me. This time I felt trapped by a young boy's hopes.\n\n## CHAPTER 14\n\nANOTHER DAY IN FUN LAND\n\n_Fun Land is where I am._\n\n--VICTOR\n\nMatthew, Thomas's foster father, came to the hospital the next morning to take Thomas home. \"I'm shy,\" he told me. \"We didn't know he was gone until late in the night.\"\n\n\"You don't need to say sorry to me,\" I told him. \"Taking care of kids is tough.\"\n\n\"Mr. Patrick\"--Mal put his hand on Thomas's shoulder--\"there are many kids in the big country's care. My wife and I try hard. But sometimes a kid is overlooked.\"\n\n\"Not this kid,\" I said.\n\nThomas seemed to like Mal, but I didn't feel any love between them.\n\nNot long after they left, Samuel came to take me home. We looked into David's room before we left, but he was sleeping. He didn't look well. We stopped at the nurse's desk, and I asked for Nurse Nora. She was gone for the day after her night work.\n\nSamuel and I went straight to the BH pool area to rest. We ordered two juices from the snack counter and sat in the shade of a table umbrella.\n\n\"My brother-in-law is mad you haven't called him back,\" Samuel said.\n\nI took out a few pink message slips from my shirt pocket. \"Tell Taylor I haven't called anyone back,\" I said. \"I haven't even read my messages.\"\n\nSamuel's cell phone rang. \"I can't answer this call here, it's against the club rules.\" He stood up from the table. \"I'll return soon,\" I heard him say on the phone as he quickly left the no-go area.\n\nI looked at the swimming area. It was very clean now, but I could think of the chaos caused by visiting, wild grandkids and spoiling grandparents filling the place during school break.\n\nI watched a big lady from BH town leave the pool. She had been swimming. She put a towel over her big shoulders and dried herself.\n\n\"Just another lovely day,\" she said to another big lady on a chair.\n\n\"Yes, just another lovely day,\" her friend agreed, looking up from her book.\n\nThey smiled at each other, sharing a special secret.\n\n_Another lovely day?_ I asked myself, still feeling the medicine. _Is it a lovely day for that worker from HA country, cutting plants over there?_\n\nThe gardener, wearing a warm hat, was using a tool that looked like something from a scary story.\n\nWas it another lovely day for the white bag boy filling big golf bags for big golfers onto normal-sized golf carts? Was the black cook in the small food hut, sweating into the potato salad, having a lovely day? Maybe yes. Maybe no.\n\n_One person's lovely day can be someone else's bad day,_ I thought.\n\nSamuel came back to the table, and I came back from the clouds. Soon after, I was at my simple home. It was just midday, and I was already tired. I shut all the windows, sat on the couch, and began looking at many messages.\n\nI ignored Thomas's many messages. The local newspaper had reached out to me three times asking for a chat. A call from the problem-solving group told me that Mrs. Madison had stopped her complaint against me. There was a message from head of the police Frank asking me to call him to arrange a meeting. Frank was acting head because the usual head was on a break for doing wrong things. Matthew and Benjamin each had left a few messages for me and a friend called three times.\n\nI called back Head Frank first, as a nice thing to do. Frank said hello with excitement. He said nice things about my police work and said he wanted to meet when I can. I said I can meet now. Frank told me how to get to the BO police station. It was on a street, a bit away from the kid's place and the happy pill lab.\n\nThe BO city police station was a simple building right across from a simple city hall, next to a very simple library. I was hoping for something more fancy.\n\nThe door to the big house was simple, and the big room looked like a school entrance. A wall with pictures in frames was the first thing I saw.\n\nFOR THE BOYS AND GIRLS WHO  \nHELPED THE TOWN OF BO\n\nThere were pictures showing the leaders, helpers, and workers of the group. The important message was easy to see:\n\nTO MAKE LIFE BETTER  \nIN THE TOWN OF BO WITH  \nHELPING HANDS TOGETHER WITH PEOPLE\n\nI walked to the front desk and rang the bell. A lady came to the desk and opened the window.\n\n\"Can I help you?\"\n\n\"I'm Ethan, here to see Chief Benjamin,\" I told her.\n\nHer face got happy, and she spoke to her friends. \"Hey, Ethan is here, the helper from BE city.\"\n\nThere were six workers in the room. One man stood up at his desk and started clapping his hands. Then all of them were standing and clapping. I smiled. What else could I do? It was a little awkward.\n\nActing Chief Frank became visible while I was shaking hands with the workers.\n\n\"Adam told me you were making all this noise.\" Adam smiled and touched my back. \"Hello.\"\n\nAdam was a grown-up. He was strong and his uniform looked nice on him. He had a neat mustache, short hair, and a real smile. He looked like the brave one, not me.\n\nAdam showed me the whole station. We went to the computer room first.\n\n\"Without computers, we can't work today,\" he said. \"Every one of our many police cars has a computer.\"\n\n\"When I started working, computers were bigger than a police car.\"\n\n\"I don't know how you guys did it.\"\n\n\"Guesses.\"\n\nWe looked at the evidence room. Adam called it \"the science lab.\" We visited the head of police's office, the big offices, places to talk, meeting rooms, the office that keeps things fair, and the room where road patrols talk about their work. In the detective's area, I was greeted like a hero by some detectives working. A friendly dog came over and sniffed me.\n\n\"Go away, you naughty dog,\" Mr. Jack told the dog.\n\n\"He's looking for bad stuff,\" a young detective explained.\n\n\"I could use some fun in that area.\" I made the young guys laugh with that, but Mr. Jack didn't think I was funny.\n\n_I only missed once,_ he said.\n\n_Twice,_ I told him.\n\n_How about all the times I helped you?_\n\n_Can we talk about this later?_\n\n_Sure. But no more silly jokes. Okay?_\n\n_Okay._\n\nOur last place to visit was the basement. There were six small rooms and Benjamin pointed to one. \"We had a sad event in this place in our past,\" Benjamin told me. \"It happened in that room two years ago. A man hurt himself. It was our mistake. He shouldn't have had his belt. He was only here for a bad act where no one got hurt. Nobody thought he was sad. We don't take anything lightly now. No shoelaces and no belts for people here, and regular checks every short while.\"\n\nI just nodded.\n\nWe went into the room where I did the task. The visit took about an hour and ended at Benjamin's small, room without windows. Benjamin got us each a bottle of water and sat behind his desk. I sat in front of him. \"So what do you think of our little place?\" he asked.\n\n\"Great,\" I said, \"but isn't the small room too small for a town this size?\"\n\n\"We don't keep anyone over a few hours unless it's really important. We do paperwork and write reports here, but we move the people out as quick as we can.\"\n\n\"Who keeps the naughty people after it gets dark?\"\n\n\"The big police station in PB town,\" he said. \"Everyone caught doing bad things in PB town has to go to the main police station in PB. They take pictures, take fingerprints, and keep the naughty people for as long as they need to. We can take the picture and fingerprints here if the police station is too busy. They have about nine hundred workers there and over three thousand places for people to sleep. They take in over fifty-five thousand people a year.\"\n\n\"Do many of those places get filled by people doing bad things in BO town?\" I asked. \"BO town doesn't seem like a place where many people would do bad things.\"\n\n\"No, not really,\" Benjamin said, \"but it's not perfect either.\"\n\n\"That's interesting,\" I said. \"Today I heard a woman in BO Heights say it's like a perfect place.\"\n\n\"I don't remember perfect places having naughty men and women,\" Benjamin said, and he looked at me like he thought I would understand what he meant.\n\n\"Are you saying there are naughty men and women in BO Heights?\"\n\n\"Sorry, I thought you read about it in the paper,\" Benjamin said.\n\n\"Read what?\n\n\"A man named David lived in the SP area of BO Heights and last year we caught him for having a dating service in his house.\"\n\n\"What? Older women as part of the dating service?\"\n\n\"No.\" Benjamin laughed. \"The girls weren't from BR town. David lived there, but he did most of his work with ME city friends.\"\n\n\"How did you find him?\"\n\n\"A unhappy girl told on him.\"\n\n\"He's lucky she wasn't a unhappy mail worker,\" I said. \"They get mad when they're unhappy. So, with no more bosses in the nice place, what keeps you busy?\"\n\n\"There are lots and lots of police officers and people working at this place, and there's plenty of problems to keep us all busy,\" Benjamin shared.\n\n\"What kind of problems happen a lot here?\"\n\n\"Computer tricks,\" Benjamin said. \"BR town is known for a lot of computer tricks.\"\n\n\"You're kidding?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am serious,\" Benjamin confirmed. \"In a time long ago, a BR town resident named Samuel was in trouble for a big computer trick.\"\n\n\"What did he do?\"\n\n\"He took a lot of personal information from a lot of people from a data company named AX. We worked with the national police on that one.\"\n\n\"I didn't know.\"\n\n\"According to a big company, BR town is the computer spam place of the world. A company member was quoted last year as saying that BR was the only seaside town in southern FL that had more sharks on land than in the water.\"\n\n\"You could have tricked me,\" I said. \"But small tricks don't keep the street helper busy,\" I observed. \"What are the street troubles?\"\n\n\"Car stealing is big,\" he told me. \"The old break-and-take game. Break a window, and take what's on the chair.\"\n\n\"Takes about four ticks, right?\"\n\n\"Right. And now we got the break-and-take-the-chair game.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I heard about that back in the big city,\" I said. \"I guess some of the chairs are really good.\"\n\n\"Yeah, the small sporty car chairs are a favorite here. They're called shiny treasures because they're kinda smooth and they can fit in other small cars like the small city car. Those chairs are worth a lot.\"\n\n\"Taking a chair sounds like it takes a lot of time.\"\n\n\"It takes a real expert about twenty-five ticks to finish,\" Adam said.\n\nHe told me about tricky crimes. \"A guy pretending to be a helper, or fixer, or maybe even a city worker, makes a house owner look elsewhere while their friend steals from the house. Usually they pick on the old folks.\"\n\n\"I was taught to be nice to my elders.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well most of the mean people here think the old folks are just easy targets,\" Adam said. \"An old man goes out to get his letters one morning, and two men stopped him, saying they were there to fix his roof. While they were exploring the land with the man, two of their buddies went into the house from the back and took things. The man's wife was inside. They took the rings from her fingers and hurt her arm.\"\n\n\"That's not nice,\" I said.\n\n\"You must have had trick crimes in Boston.\"\n\n\"Yes, but not the same type,\" I said. \"In Boston the trick was usually a hit on your head or a toy in your face.\"\n\n\"We have lots of that here too,\" Benjamin said.\n\nBenjamin spoke about thefts and bad things in the town. He told me how an old woman was hit in a parking lot trying to stop a car because someone in the car had taken her bag. Her body got stuck under the car and they pulled the poor woman a long way trying to get to the big road. She was a mom of four and grandma of eight. The three children in the car were young ones from RI town with old bad records.\n\n\"Were they judged as young ones?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"That's wild.\" I sighed. \"Could you have gone after them if they left BO town?\"\n\n\"We can go into DE town, but after that we have to tell the sheriff's office.\"\n\n\"It seems like BO is hard for police.\"\n\n\"Right. We have the north, south, and west areas to keep safe with sixteen officers per shift per area. Right now I have eighteen friends sick, hurt, or on a break. We're often needing more help. The bad guys always seem to have enough people.\"\n\n\"I know how you feel,\" I shared.\n\n\"Then we have the skyport, small rivers, beaches, and trains to watch.\"\n\n\"Sounds like a bad guy's dream,\" I guessed.\n\n\"Just another day,\" Benjamin said. \"By the way\"--he talked about something else--\"that was great work you did with those strangers.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Chief,\" I said.\n\n\"You're too good at keeping people safe to be taking a break, Ethan. We could use a friend like you here.\"\n\n\"I'm too old to be an officer,\" I said.\n\n\"I was thinking of you being a private helper,\" Benjamin said. \"All you need is a helper's card in this place. You could get a card with no trouble. With your past in helping others we could help you get a card quickly.\"\n\n\"I'm taking a break. Besides, you got lots of good officers already.\"\n\n\"Yes we do,\" Benjamin agreed. \"I'm proud of the quality of friends we have helping out. But we could always use a super helper.\" He moved closer. \"You're a natural, Ethan. \"It's in your mind. Even after you got hurt, you thought about a rule being broken.\"\n\n\"It might have been okay anyway,\" I said.\n\n\"It would have been okay,\" he agreed. \"But how did you think about that with a hurt shoulder?\"\n\n\"I lost a game once because of a rule being broken,\" I said. \"It must have been in my thoughts.\"\n\n\"You were almost asleep,\" he said. \"It's amazing.\"\n\n\"I just did it.\"\n\n\"You still have what it takes, Ethan.\"\n\n\"I also have a hurt.\"\n\n\"Oh, really?\" Ben smiled a lot. \"Try telling that to the guy you scared or the guy you hurt in the leg. What do you say we call the Big Farm Office and get you a paper?\"\n\n\"I don't want to be a farmer.\"\n\nHe laughed. \"The People Help Division of Papers is in the Big Farm and People Help Office,\" he explained. \"I can make some calls to TA city today and maybe make things easier for you. Your good things will make it easy.\"\n\n\"What's the hurry?\"\n\n\"I have two things I think are good for you,\" he told me.\n\n\"Oh, really? Want to tell me?\"\n\n\"Let's get your paper first and a paper for a toy gun. \"That's a special permit. I like the SS tool. What about you?\"\n\n\"A G9 tool.\"\n\n\"Good choice,\" Ben said.\n\n\"Do you want me to use it on someone?\"\n\n\"You already did.\"\n\n\"Speaking of using it on people\"--I continued--\"what happened to Bob, Yosef, and Nora?\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"My friends.\"\n\n\"Oh, those three,\" Ben said. \"We moved them right to PB city. They were kept there until the next day. Then they had to talk to the law. They said they did nothing wrong, of course.\"\n\n\"Of course. So they're in a small room until the meeting about why they were caught?\"\n\n\"They left.\"\n\n\"Left?\" I was surprised. \"Three people who did wrong things to me and they just walked out? Who let this happen?\"\n\n\"Taylor,\" Ben said. \"She's very kind.\"\n\n\"These people can run away,\" I said.\n\n\"They don't call her 'Taylor the Kind' for nothing.\" Ben shrugged. \"But she did make them leave a lot of money behind. They'll come back tomorrow for the meeting because they don't want to lose all that money.\"\n\n\"I can't believe this.\" I stood up and walked around the room. \"Let me guess, Ben. They left the money without a helper. \"Right?\"\n\nBenjamin took out a folder from the middle drawer of his desk. He opened the folder on the desk. I saw the pictures of the three men clipped to the first page, but they were upside-down. Benjamin read some words under the photos by running his finger across the sentences. He looked up at me and raised his eyebrows. \"You're right,\" he agreed. \"That's just what happened.\"\n\n\"And their helper paid the money to get them out with three separate checks for a lot of money each, in the late afternoon. Right?\"\n\nBenjamin looked at the folder again. He read with his finger again and turned to the second page. He looked up at me slowly.\n\n\"How did you know that?\" He was surprised.\n\n\"Because that's what I would do if I was making fake money,\" I said. \"I'd pay the money to get out of jail with fake checks late in the day so they couldn't be checked until the next morning and then I'd leave the jail and run away.\"\n\n\"You're saying those checks are not real and those three men are far away now.\" Benjamin was finding it hard to believe what I was saying.\n\n\"Frank,\" I said, looking him right in his eyes, \"I'm sure that there will be nothing from that far away country in the court tomorrow unless someone brings in a bottle of a drink.\"\n\nEarly in the morning, like I guessed, there was nothing from RU country in the WE city court. No RU country friends, no RU country food, no RU country clothes, no RU country explorers, no RU country army, no RU country people, and no RU country dancers, no RU country drink, and no RU country people in trouble.\n\nDavid, the head person of the local bank, stood in front of the judge to say that the three checks the people in trouble had given to the office were not good.\n\n\"Best fake checks I have ever seen,\" he said.\n\nThere was a lot of blaming, so I decided to leave before someone blamed me. Outside the court I saw the news writer from the local news who had talked to the Fighting Teacher at the gym. He shook my hand happily. \"I'm Jack,\" he said, smiling. \"It's great to meet you. I read all about you in the newspaper.\"\n\n\"You must have written about me yourself. Every other news writer did.\"\n\n\"No.\" He turned red. \"That's too big a story for me. I've only been working for a little over a year. My boss writes the important stories with his own name. I get the local-interest stuff like the Fighting Teacher story. \"I gave him that name myself.\"\n\n\"Nice touch. So, how did that turn out?\"\n\n\"Good, I think,\" Jack said. \"The kid's amazing. I'd like to write a story about his friend.\"\n\n\"Tommy? What for?\"\n\n\"That kid is in a tough place, and I think it's sad.\"\n\n\"So, why don't you write the story?\" I asked.\n\n\"I tried. My boss didn't like it.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"He said he didn't like the way I wanted to tell it.\"\n\n\"I think you should write it anyway.\"\n\n\"Thanks. But you're not my boss.\"\n\nThe door to the big building opened wide, and people made a loud exit. Some people knew me, and a few people approached, followed by others who were just interested.\n\nOne person worked his way to the front. \"Jack.\" He smiled big at the young guy. \"Introduce me to your friend.\"\n\n\"Adam, Ethan,\" Jack said. \"Adam's my boss.\"\n\n\"Nice to meet you, Ethan.\" The big smile stayed.\n\nI guessed he was a grown-up.\n\n\"You're quite a story around here. How about a chat?\"\n\n\"They already told my story in the news.\"\n\n\"Well, what do you think about the people you caught being let go?\"\n\n\"Actually they were allowed to go home,\" I said. \"They set themselves free.\"\n\n\"Well, don't you think Judge Ryan was a bit careless in letting them go home in a case of this size, and shouldn't the area lawyer have been more firm that they stay?\"\n\nI could smell a trap, and I didn't like it. \"No comment,\" I said. \"I don't know the judge or the area lawyer.\"\n\n\"Were the BR city police responsible in any way for this trouble?\" Adam asked.\n\nI noticed the other reporters were getting annoyed by Adam taking up my time.\n\n\"The BR city police were great. They saved my life.\"\n\nAdam was disappointed. He was digging for dirt. \"Surely you must have something bad to say about these bad guys jumping bail,\" he tried again.\n\nI thought for a moment and looked over at Jack. Why not? \"I have plenty to say. But I've agreed to give my only story to Jack.\"\n\nEveryone looked at Jack, and Jack looked surprised.\n\n\"Why Jack?\" Adam was unhappy. \"He's just a learner.\"\n\n\"I liked the story he wrote about the Fighting Teacher,\" I lied. \"And I think his ideas on taking care of children in FR state are very interesting.\"\n\nThe other reporters gathered around Jack.\n\n\"How long have you known Ethan?\"\n\n\"Not long,\" Jack said.\n\n\"How does Peter feel about the judge?\"\n\n\"No comment,\" Jack said.\n\n\"What are your views on caring for others, Jack?\"\n\n\"You'll have to read it in the story.\"\n\n\"How did you get the special thing?\"\n\n\"Just lucky.\" Jack Small looked at me.\n\nI winked and walked away.\n\n## CHAPTER 15\n\nA STORY FROM THE PAST\n\nCold weather came to BO town two weeks after the RU people left PB town. Strong winds, cold enough to freeze your oranges, were all over the place. Warnings were given for small people.\n\nI woke up early in the morning on a Sunday. The sky was a gray sheet of slate. Palm tree leaves knocked on my bedroom window, trying to get in the room and under the blankets. Excited to see what winter in FL state was like, I got dressed and left my home. It was cold outside, but not the BO city kind of cold that turned my hands and knees into aching, rusty hinges.\n\nI drove slowly past the BO town Play Area on YA. I saw moving shadows of bushes and palm trees. There were waves in the manmade lakes. A radio person said it felt like forty degrees outside. A nice man told me I had a friend in Jesus. I turned off the radio. I had many friends.\n\nI drove on a big road and stopped my car in an empty place where people park. I got out and walked towards the water. The sand was next to a small fence. There were flags telling people to stay away from the water. The water was moving a lot. Big waves hit the sand and took some of it away. My coat and hair were wet from the water in the air, and I smelled like wet clothes.\n\nI started the car and made it warm. I took off my wet coat and put it behind me. My shirt was also wet, and I was cold. When the warm air touched my face, I felt sleepy. I made my car seat go back, closed my eyes and had a dream.\n\nI smelled flowers. I was in a big bed covered with a warm blanket. My head was on a soft pillow. I saw walls that looked orange because of the sun coming through the curtains. Alice was sleeping next to me. She made me think of how Penelope slept.\n\nThe blanket was around her middle, and I saw her shirtless top. I wanted to touch her, but I didn't. Her eyes blinked open, and she looked at me surprised. She pulled the blanket up to her head.\n\n\"Why are you here?\" she asked.\n\nI didn't know why I was there.\n\n\"Why are you here?\" she asked again.\n\nI felt silly.\n\nI heard a knock at the door.\n\n\"It's the police,\" she said happily. \"They're here to take you.\"\n\nThe knocking got louder. I tried to get out of the bed, but the heavy blanket held me down. The bed felt like sinking sand. I was going down slowly, unable to breathe.\n\n\"Are you okay in there?\" A big voice was calling me.\n\nI opened my eyes unsure.\n\nThrough the wet window of my car, I saw a young man in a police hat. He was knocking at the driver's window of my small car. I quickly let down the window and felt the cold air on my face.\n\n\"I think I fell asleep, Officer,\" I said.\n\n\"No problem,\" the young man said nicely. \"I just wanted to check if you were okay.\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm okay.\"\n\n\"You seem familiar,\" the police officer noticed.\n\n\"I've been in the news a lot lately,\" I said.\n\n\"That's right,\" he replied. \"You're the brave officer from Boston, right?\"\n\n\"I'm the officer from Boston,\" I clarified. \"I'm not sure how brave I am.\"\n\n\"Hey, you did a good job,\" he praised. \"And thanks for saying kind things about our local police.\"\n\n\"I'm thankful to you all,\" I said.\n\n\"I'm Rick.\" He offered his hand.\n\n\"Edward.\" I smiled.\n\nWe greeted each other.\n\n\"Nice to meet you, Edward,\" he said. \"Be careful. It's going to be a tough winter day.\"\n\n\"You think this is winter?\"\n\nUnder the help of Chief Ben, I got my Class C private detective badge and gun permission in just two weeks. The day after I got my badge, I got a morning call from a man named Ethan, who said he was the leader of the Community Management Group for BO Town.\n\n\"The CMG at BO Town wants to hire a detective to help with a few things,\" he informed me. \"And we'd like to discuss the work with you.\"\n\n\"Did Frank ask you to talk to me?\" I asked.\n\n\"The people who help us stay safe don't work with private helpers,\" he said, not sounding sure. \"Let's just say I heard about it.\"\n\nThe CO office was in a tiny, hidden building off the main road of the town. Samuel was a tiny, hairless man who looked old. He said he was a lawyer who didn't work anymore from CH city. He sat behind his desk and started talking.\n\n\"Because of how good you've been before and how you stopped the fake money from RU country,\" he started, \"the CO wants your help to look into two things at BO place.\"\n\n\"I've only been a helper in FL state for one day,\" I said. \"Surely you could find someone who has done this more.\"\n\n\"People know you're good, Ethan,\" he said nicely. \"You've been doing this your whole life. We're sure about giving you the tasks.\"\n\n\"What are you thinking?\" I played along.\n\nThe first thing was about the hurt of Robert.\n\n\"Steve told me about the hurt,\" I said. \"If I remember, Robert was hurt with a game stick.\"\n\n\"A big game stick to the head,\" Samuel said. \"It broke his head.\"\n\nAccording to Adam, the main person in question had become very sick and the police couldn't find more clues.\n\n\"What do you need from me?\"\n\n\"The people would like to have your help,\" Adam said, \"to do our own search.\"\n\n\"What will we get from that?\" I asked.\n\n\"Peace.\" Adam moved a little in his seat. \"There's a big dark cloud over BH town. We need to find out what happened to Ryan.\"\n\n\"Do you want me to continue where the police stopped?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes.\" Adam agreed. \"We want some answers for the people and for the families involved.\"\n\n\"I get it.\" I agreed. \"So, who is the person in question?\"\n\n\"David.\"\n\n\"Tell me about the other problem,\" I said right away.\n\nAdam told me that a family named Benjamin moved into BH town three months ago and soon started causing trouble. During a small fight, their eighteen-year-old son told one of the neighbors, \"A bad man didn't hurt enough of you people.\" When the upset neighbor complained to the boy's father, Frank Benjamin replied quickly, \"Stay out of it.\"\n\nThe neighborhood group wrote the Benjamins a letter, asking for a sorry note. In response, the Benjamin family didn't answer. Ryan, their son, responded by being rude to everyone he passed while racing through the neighborhood in a black car. He displayed a bad picture on his right arm and wore one on a necklace around his neck. Frank played loud music in his backyard. Mrs. Ryan never spoke to anyone in the neighborhood, and their fifteen-year-old daughter, Emma, was just like her brother.\n\nThe neighbors complained to the Neighborhood Council, and the council sent more letters to the Ryans, which were also ignored by the family. Eventually, the neighborhood council contacted the helpers.\n\n\"The helpers said there was nothing they could do,\" Samuel explained. \"Frank said the Ryans weren't breaking any rules. He suggested we handle it ourselves.\"\n\n\"What do you know about the Ryans?\" I asked.\n\n\"We did a little research. They're originally from a place called TJ town,\" Samuel explained. \n\nSamuel nodded. \"The Ryans are part of a bad group.\"\n\n\"All these bad people don't like others,\" I said. \"What are the Benjamins doing here?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Samuel said. \"But they're making many friends upset.\"\n\n\"People usually join together against a common problem,\" I told him.\n\n\"Not here,\" Samuel said. \"We're too busy arguing with each other. I was hoping you could help us become friends. Maybe find a way to make the Benjamins happy.\"\n\n\"You can't make people like this happy,\" I told him strongly.\n\n\"Maybe you can talk to them,\" Samuel tried.\n\n\"You can't talk to these unfriendly people either,\" I said. \"I wouldn't spend my time on ways like that and I don't want the job.\"\n\n\"Do you have any ideas?\" Samuel asked sadly.\n\n\"I'm the wrong friend to ask,\" I told Samuel. \"I handle things differently than you might like.\"\n\n\"Is there anything I can do to change your decision?\" Samuel tried.\n\n\"Let me think about it,\" I said. \"Maybe I'll think of something.\"\n\n\"We really need your help,\" Samuel said honestly.\n\n\"I'll help you with the Gabriel case,\" I decided.\n\n## CHAPTER 16\n\nBO City Music\n\nI found joy again in BO City.\n\n\"Oh dear!\" I said quietly.\n\n\"Oh dear!\" Alice agreed loudly.\n\nMr. Jack and I had wished to be close to Alice ever since we first saw her. This time it wasn't a dream. She was really there, and we were resting after a fun time together. It was a simple game played by two excited, slightly rusty players who had never played together before.\n\nWhat we didn't have in skill, we made up for with excitement. After a shy start, we began playing together perfectly. Mr. Jack cheered for Alice, and she agreed to play again.\n\nAfter a short break, we started playing again. The final game was quieter than the first. When the game ended, the two friends hugged.\n\n\"Well done, friend.\"\n\n\"Good job, friend.\"\n\nAlice's head rested on my right arm.\n\n\"Thank you, everyone,\" I said.\n\n\"You're different,\" She laughed. \"Why are you thanking everyone?\"\n\n\"I'm thanking everyone,\" I admitted. \"I can't believe I'm here with you.\"\n\nAlice had called me the same day I met with Mr. Ethan. I had not talked to her since she came to see me when I was sick a few weeks ago. I thought of her a lot and so did Mr. Jack. But I did not think I fit in with Alice's life. She was a party queen and a LI princess. I liked to play games and used to be a policeman.\n\n\"How are you?\" she asked in a worried way on the phone. \"I thought I would hear from you.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said. \"I've been busy.\" I felt bad.\n\n\"I understand,\" she said softly. \"Are you better?\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm okay,\" I said. My heart was beating fast. There was a quiet moment, and I used that time to think of myself as silly.\n\n\"Well, okay then,\" she sounded shy. \"I guess I'll see you later.\"\n\n\"Yes, sure,\" I said, not very sure.\n\nWe said goodbye. My throat hurt because my heart was beating so fast, and my head hurt.\n\n_You're silly,_ I said to myself. _What's wrong with you?_ I picked up the phone and dialed her number.\n\n\"Hi, this is Alice.\" A recorded voice said hello to me. \"I can't answer the phone now, but leave a message and I'll call you back as soon as I can.\"\n\n\"Beep!\"\n\nWhere could she have gone so fast?\n\n\"Alice.\" I don't know why I used her first name. \"This is Adam.\" I was speaking fast. \"Just wanted you to know that I really liked your visit when I was sick, and I'm sorry I fell asleep while you were talking ... . . and thanks for the call.\" I ended the call.\n\n\"Silly me.\" I redialed and got the answering machine again.\n\n\"Hello again.\" I sounded silly. \"To be honest, I think about you often. I think you're pretty and kind and lovely and--\" I heard a sound at the other end of the call.\n\n\"Adam?\" Alice said.\n\n\"Were you listening this whole time?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"Thank you for saying such kind things.\"\n\n\"It's easy to say kind things about you.\"\n\n\"Do you want to see me again?\"\n\n\"I would really like to see you again,\" I said. \"When?\"\n\n\"Now.\"\n\n\"Now? I'm all dirty and sweaty. I just finished teaching a boxing class at the Kids Sports Club.\"\n\n\"You can clean up here,\" she said.\n\n_Let's go!_ Mr. Jack cheered.\n\nAnd this is how I became a part of the music team.\n\n## Section 17\n\nTOWN ART\n\nA couple of days later, I got a call on my little phone at Alice's house from Chief Benjamin.\n\n\"I've been trying to call your home all morning,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm not there,\" I replied.\n\n\"Do you want to tell me where you were?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Do you know the BU house was messed up early in the morning?\"\n\n\"I'm not surprised.\"\n\n\"Four windows were broken, and a special star was drawn on the house.\"\n\n\"Was there only one special star?\" I asked, a bit upset.\n\n\"Where were you early in the morning?\" Frank didn't laugh at my joke.\n\n\"Am I thought to have done it?\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" Benjamin said.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"You're known for some rough things in your past,\" Benjamin said.\n\n\"I'm not doing that anymore.\"\n\n\"I heard,\" Benjamin said. \"But after Ethan told you about the BUs, their house got messed up.\"\n\n\"Thank you for saying I should go to the CM,\" I said.\n\n\"I didn't say that,\" Benjamin said.\n\n\"Then how did you know I met with Ethan?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't like to think you were part of the mess, Eddie.\" Frank didn't answer my question.\n\n\"Then don't think about it.\"\n\n\"Don't say I didn't tell you,\" Frank said.\n\n\"Tell the B friends,\" I suggested to him.\n\n\"Are you working on the G case?\" he changed the topic.\n\n\"Now how would you know that?\"\n\n\"Lucky guess.\"\n\n\"I have a meeting with David tonight at the hospital,\" I told him.\n\n\"Hard case,\" he said. \"Let me know if I can help you with anything,\" Frank offered.\n\n\"How are you at breaking windows and painting?\"\n\n\"Smart-mouth,\" he said, and ended the call.\n\nAlice sat next to me on her couch. \"Who was that?\"\n\n\"The B town police chief,\" I told her.\n\n\"What did he want?\"\n\n\"He wanted to know if I had anything to do with the B house being messed up this morning.\"\n\n\"Do you? You left my house early in the morning.\"\n\n\"You were awake?\" I was surprised.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you say anything?\"\n\n\"I was afraid to ask why you were leaving,\" she said. \"Now I know why you were leaving, and I'm still afraid.\"\n\n\"There's nothing for you to be afraid of,\" I reassured her.\n\n\"I'm afraid of bad things, Ethan,\" she said. \"I hope you got it out of your system.\"\n\n\"Alice, this is how I think,\" I explained, \"I stand up to things I find scary.\"\n\n\"The B family didn't scare you,\" Alice said.\n\n\"Yes they did,\" I disagreed. \"When someone says something very mean, that's scary for everyone.\"\n\n\"The B family aren't bad,\" she kept saying.\n\n\"If bad people were around today\"--I spoke louder--\"people like the B family would be the first to do bad things. I'd rather stop them first.\"\n\nShe hugged herself. \"You're scaring me, Ethan.\" She trembled.\n\n\"The B family should scare you.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure I can agree with what you did,\" she said.\n\nI saw a red spot, and it surprised me. Alice had upset me. I got up from the couch. \"I'm not asking you to agree,\" I said as I walked to the door.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" she asked.\n\n\"Home,\" I said, opening the door.\n\n\"Can't we talk more about this?\" she tried.\n\n\"No,\" I said, closing the door behind me.\n\nThere are some things I just can't talk about.\n\nDavid was awake when I came to his room early in the evening. His skin was a different color, but he was smiling. Alice was there, and she introduced us.\n\n\"Hello, great officer,\" he said in a NE city voice. \"How are you?\"\n\nHis handshake was strong but thin. I sat by his right side. \"Do you mind sitting on my left side? I have a pretend eye on the right.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I said, moving quickly.\n\n\"Did you lose your eye because of sickness?\" I asked.\n\n\"No. Because of a toy gun when I was eleven. My older brother was playing with it,\" he explained.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said.\n\n\"Don't worry about it,\" David said like a funny guy, and he laughed. Then he coughed until he was tired. He drank some water with a straw then put on a mask. He slowly started breathing easier. He took off the mask when he talked. \"So, I understand you want to talk to me.\"\n\n\"Well, first I wanted to meet you. Your wife and daughters have told me so much about you.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said, \"but the man they told you about is not here anymore.\"\n\n\"I heard you were a great maker,\" I said, trying to make it lighter. \"And you built a line of picture development stores that was the biggest in LI.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he grinned, \"and I sold it to people from the big city who changed it.\"\n\n\"Timing is important,\" I agreed.\n\n\"Yes.\" He agreed sadly. \"Did they tell you about my potato chip company I started after I left my old job?\"\n\n\"No, I didn't hear about that,\" I said as Alice laughed in the background.\n\nAdam laughed, too. \"My potato chip factory used to make the whole town smell from all the different kinds I made.\"\n\n\"Why potato chips?\" I wondered.\n\nHe thought for a moment. \"Why not?\"\n\nI liked Adam right away and wished he wasn't sick. I wished the bad people were sick instead.\n\n\"So, you took the case,\" Adam said directly.\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered. \"Why not?\"\n\nWe both laughed.\n\n\"So let's start from the beginning,\" I said. \"Did you do anything to Robert?\"\n\n\"You got me,\" Adam laughed. \"I hit him on the head with a toy after making sure everyone around knew I was there.\"\n\n\"Stop joking,\" Alice told her husband.\n\n\"It doesn't matter,\" Adam said. \"I'm too sick for anything, and this whole thing will end when I do.\"\n\n\"Why are you in trouble?\" I asked.\n\n\"It's a long story.\"\n\n\"I have time.\"\n\n\"Don't you have something else to do?\" David asked.\n\n\"Not if I can help you,\" I told him.\n\n\"Does it matter?\" David sounded upset.\n\n\"I care,\" Carol said. \"And the girls care too.\"\n\n\"How long have you two been together?\" I asked.\n\n\"We'll be together forty-one years next week,\" Carol said.\n\n\"I didn't get you a gift,\" David told her.\n\nCarol got up from her seat, walked to his side, took off his mask, and kissed him. \"You're my gift,\" she told him gently.\n\n\"I know,\" he whispered, and I saw a tear in his eye.\n\n\"Now, David, you tell Ethan what happened that night,\" Carol told him.\n\n\"Do you really want to know all this?\" David turned to me.\n\n\"Yes I do,\" I said.\n\n\"I already told the police everything.\"\n\n\"Tell me,\" I said. \"I'm a good listener.\"\n\n## CHAPTER 18\n\nTRICKY SITUATIONS\n\nDavid let me write down his side of the story. He coughed a lot, and it took over an hour. When he was done, he went to sleep.\n\nI looked at Charlotte. \"What a story,\" I said.\n\nShe slowly moved her head. \"I know,\" she said with a sad voice. \"What do you think? Can you help us?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" I confessed. \"The only thing I'm sure of is that your husband didn't hurt Ryan. I just can't picture him hitting someone's head with a golf club.\"\n\n\"I'm happy someone else thinks like that,\" she said.\n\n\"The proof against him is all not direct,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, not direct proof has a lot of people thinking that David is a bad man.\" Charlotte was upset.\n\n\"A lot of people trust in God, too.\"\n\n\"I think that's not a good comparison,\" she said like she was protecting herself. \"We trust in God. We're very religious.\"\n\n\"I'm not talking about religion, Charlotte. I'm talking about not direct proof. Someone once said that everything written in a famous book was based on not direct proof.\"\n\n\"Thomas said that,\" Charlotte said like she didn't care, and she didn't sound happy with Thomas or me. \"I don't like it.\"\n\n\"I understand how you feel, Charlotte,\" I said in a kind way. I didn't want religion to be the problem. \"Legally speaking, however, not direct proof is not from someone who saw or heard anything. There's a way to understand things by seeing clues that point to the answer. \"Is there someone who can say that the storybook is completely true?\"\n\n\"No, there isn't,\" Charlotte said. \"But I believe the storybook.\"\n\n\"Some people think David is bad,\" I said.\n\nCharlotte looked sad, and I felt sorry.\n\n\"I get what you're saying,\" Charlotte agreed. \"Without a fair game, people will always think David is bad.\"\n\n\"I think you're right,\" I said honestly.\n\n\"Maybe he will get better,\" Charlotte said, \"and have his turn in the game.\"\n\nI didn't reply. David was not going to get better.\n\n\"I don't want people to remember him like this,\" Charlotte said.\n\n\"Me neither,\" I told her. \"I'll do my best.\"\n\nCharlotte gave me a small hug and said, \"Thank you.\"\n\n## CHAPTER 19\n\nTHE BOCA BUILDER\n\nDavid thought that for me to understand about Robert's accident, I needed to learn about the building of BO city. So, he told me about how BO city was built. When I drove back to my home and saw three familiar signs on the way, it meant something to me.\n\nArthur was born a long time ago in a small town. David, a leader in the metal industry, started a big metal company a long time ago. When he was really old, David started looking for new things to do. He decided to build houses and buildings in a place we'll call SO land. David had a dream to make this place beautiful. David passed away when he was really old, but his dream continued.\n\nIn the late 20th century, a big company named IB bought a lot of land from David's company on a road we'll call YA street in SO land to build a big factory. Fifteen years before IB made their first computer, David's company built a big office park on YA street. To make the big company people and rich people happy, David's company built a golf course far from the office park and named it BO golf course. They built another golf course closer to IB and named it BR golf course.\n\nIn the mid-80s, a lot of people wanted to buy land and houses in SO land. David's company saw this and started building two new neighborhoods near their two golf courses. They named one neighborhood BO neighborhood and the other was named BR neighborhood.\n\nDavid's company built and sold the houses in both neighborhoods faster than they thought. Eventually, a lot of the old farm land became two big gated neighborhoods with lots of houses and condos. Both clubs had two golf places, more than twenty tennis places, a big house, a health place, a food room, meeting rooms, and card rooms.\n\nBy the time when all houses in \"BE town\" and \"BR town\" were done, a big company decided to leave \"BO city\". A company had to be more active in showing their two new safe communities to compete with the growing competition. A special golf membership gave people who wanted to buy homes at the two communities a choice. They could join one place for one fee or both places for a higher fee. It seemed like a good idea then.\n\nThe people who bought homes at \"BE town\" and joined both places had a \"Two Place membership.\" The homeowners who chose to belong to only one place were known as \"One Place members\" and they all belonged to the same place. \"BR town\" developed a similar system and used its own words for their membership categories. The golf places at the two communities were basically the same.\n\nAfter all the homes were done, \"BE town\" Club members were allowed to take care of the club. The company, however, did not want to give up the profitable care of the club and this led to a problem.\n\nPeople said many things. Members said the company did all sorts of things and the company denied everything. The company had a group of in-house, want-to-be-great people and \"BE town\" had a group of used-to-be-great people. A long, tough fight was sure to happen.\n\nEarly one morning, a complaint against Adam was made.\n\nI looked at the paper. It was a big group complaint, saying that Adam had done many wrong things. Adam was accused of doing wrong in making, running, managing, and telling people about the play area and fun facilities. Also, he was blamed for not giving the facilities to the homeowners when he should have.\n\nIn the paper, the lawyers asked for a lot of money and other things they didn't say exactly, the right to ask for punishment money, triple damages, interest, and money for the lawyers and costs. They asked for everything.\n\nThe case took a long time and cost a lot of money. The result was a not-so-good money settlement for the community members in a year far from then. Adam left the community with some money to show for his work. The members had a hard-won victory.\n\nAdam's leaving had an effect like when some people left a city in the late 20th century. The people who lived there started fighting each other. The One Playground members and the Two Playground members blamed each other with long lists of problems.\n\nAccording to David, messages went through the air like throwing stones. Both sides had losses, and their books were full of red marks. Big extra charges, called assessments, caused friend to turn against friend. Friendly behavior stopped, and a big argument started.\n\nI understood I was only hearing one part of the story, so I talked to other people at the play place. The talks went something like this:\n\n> > > **Ethan:** What's your problem with the One Game team versus the Two Game team?\n>>> \n>>> **One Game Team Kid #1:** The Two Game team is treating us badly.>>> **One Game Team Kid #1:** The Two Game team is treating us badly.\n>>> \n>>> **E.:** How?\n>>> \n>>> **OGT Kid #1:** We share our toys with their team and can't play there.>>> **OGT Kid #1:** We share our toys with their team and can't play there.\n>>> \n>>> **E.:** Do you have proof of this sharing?\n>>> \n>>> **OGT Kid #1:** Proof? What are you, a toy detective?\n>>> \n>>> **Ethan:** The One Game team kids say they share their toys with the Two Game team.>>> **Ethan:** The One Game team kids say they share their toys with the Two Game team.\n>>> \n>>> **Two Game Team Kid #1:** They're not telling the truth.>>> **Two Game Team Kid #1:** They're not telling the truth.\n>>> \n>>> **E.:** That doesn't really answer the question.\n>>> \n>>> **TGT Kid #1:** Sure it does.>>> **TGT Kid #1:** Sure it does.\n>>> \n>>> **E.:** Look, all I want is a simple answer. Is it true that One Game team kids share their toys with the Two Game team, even though they can't play on the Two Game side?\n>>> **Tom #1:** Do you have proof of that?\n>>> \n>>> **Emma:** No.\n>>> \n>>> **Tom #1:** Then it's not true.\n>>> \n>>> **Emma:** Can you show it's not true?\n>>> \n>>> **Tom #1:** Proof? Are you playing detective?\n>>> \n>>> **Emma:** Why don't you just get a two park pass?\n>>> \n>>> **One Park Friend #2:** Why should I? I'm a house owner in the Big Town, and the members own the park. If I'm an owner of the park, and the two parks are part of it, then I should be able to play there without having to pay an extra fee.\n>>> \n>>> **Emma:** But what about the current two park members? They paid as much as a lot of money extra to join the two parks.\n>>> \n>>> **One Park Friend #2:** Something should be sorted about that.\n>>> \n>>> **Emma:** Like what?\n>>> \n>>> **One Park Friend #2:** I don't mind as long as it doesn't cost me anything.\n>>> \n>>> **Emma:** Do you think the one park members are being treated unfairly by not being able to play in the two parks? They are like you, they own things and believe they should be allowed to play on both fields. \n\n**Second Field Friend Benjamin:** In other words, they want to get something without giving anything. They're not right.\n\n**Ethan:** But they say they are helping the Two Field friends with extra money.\n\n**Field Friend Benjamin:** Nobody has shown that to be true. But think about this, Ethan: The second field increases the value of the first field and the total property at BO city. A new person buying a house can choose to play on two fields at BO city. This is a good thing. And something else, most friends of the second field only play on the second field, even though they pay to play on both fields. If the friends of the second field played on the first field all the time, it would be too crowded. So, everyone gains from how things are here.\n\n**Ethan:** The friends of the first field do not agree.\n\n**Field Friend Benjamin:** They're not being nice. \n\n**Ethan:** That appears to be the answer to many things here.\n\nI was mixed up by what people were saying. When I suggested we look at the Two Field books to see if the One Field friends were really helping a place they couldn't use, I was either told \"Mind your own business\" or was given a reason I didn't understand.\n\nI was also part of the decision-making discussions. Alice left BH community with several basic facilities. The facilities needed to be better but no one could agree on what needed to be changed.\n\n\"We don't need a big fancy building for a new community center.\"\n\n\"Cheap person. I want the best things we can get, and I don't care what it costs.\"\n\n\"Who needs a new gym? I don't use the old one.\"\n\n\"You should, you're not very fit.\"\n\n\"I want to keep the simple beauty of BH community.\"\n\n\"By 'simple beauty' you mean you don't want to spend any money.\"\n\n\"Everyone on the community leaders is silly.\"\n\n\"The community voted for the community leaders.\"\n\n\"The community is silly.\"\n\n\"You're part of the community.\"\n\n\"Are you calling me silly?\"\n\n\"We don't need a very expensive new main gate.\"\n\n\"I never go out. Why should I pay for a new gate?\"\n\nThere were many houses with many ideas at BH community.\n\nRyan had been a man with a lot of ideas, and he shared them often. He was a former leader of the community and a pushy guy. He wanted to spend as little as possible, and he wanted to combine the two types of memberships without any extra cost to the One Course members. Gabriel was a big man and was often scary. He usually got what he wanted.\n\nDavid was a loud supporter of having the best things, and he thought that joining the two groups without any reward for the Two Course members was very unfair. David was as big as Gabriel. He usually got what he wanted, too.\n\nDavid and Gabriel often argued at meetings, and everyone knew that they didn't like each other. They rarely talked to each other, except to argue about things, and they stayed away from each other otherwise.\n\nThen \"the note\" was sent by Gabriel to all the club members after a very angry meeting. David didn't have a copy with him when he told me the story at the hospital, so he could only tell me the basic things about the old note. It was something like this:\n\n> > _At the club meeting today, Mr. David was again loud and rude throughout the meeting. Mr. David's ideas are so old they are not helpful in today's world. He should let the running of the club be done by people who are smart enough to understand the problems at the place and do something about them._\n\nThe members I talked to about \"the note\" agreed that it was not nice. (\"But it was certainly no reason for David to hit Gabriel in the head.\")\n\nWhen I asked why everyone thought David had done something very bad, the answers I got were like this:\n\nRobert was hurt on the same night \"the note\" was given to everyone. It was easy to see why David could be very upset. Also, a little after bedtime on the night of \"the note,\" David's car was seen by Robert's neighbor, stopping fast in front of Robert's house. It was a dark, windy night. David ran to the open garage shouting, \"Robert, you are not nice, I want to talk to you.\" Robert pushed a button on the garage wall to close the big door, but David managed to get into the garage just before the door closed. Two more neighbors could hear the loud noise and shouting from inside the garage. The neighbor who had seen everything from the start quickly told the people walking their dogs what had happened. They suddenly heard a big noise, and then David appeared, running through the front gate. He must have left through the back door of the garage that led to the yard behind the front gate. He looked scared, and there was red on his hands.\n\n\"That man is not nice,\" David said to the people standing by as he got into his car and drove away. He pushed two buttons on the wall near the door, and both big doors went up. We walked across the big room to the front of the house and looked back again. \"So Adam pulls up there.\" Samuel pointed. \"Gabriel is in the big room practicing golf with plastic golf balls.\"\n\n\"Why was he practicing in the big room? Why not outside where there's more room?\"\n\n\"Good question,\" Samuel said. \"It was very windy that night and the plastic golf balls probably would have blown to PO city.\"\n\n\"So why practice at all on a windy night like that?\"\n\n\"Gabriel had a problem with his golf hit.\"\n\n\"Is that like being sick?\" I asked.\n\n\"No. It's bad. It's when a person hits the golf ball sideways instead of straight.\"\n\n\"On purpose?\"\n\n\"No, of course not.\"\n\n\"Then why does he do it?\"\n\n\"He can't help it. There's something wrong with his hit,\" Samuel explained.\n\n\"So, Gabriel was trying to fix his hit by hitting plastic golf balls in his big room on a windy night?\"\n\nSamuel nodded.\n\nI didn't know what to say.\n\nI looked around the big room, trying to think about what had happened that night. I thought about the fight between the two men, which should have been even, as they were both very big. Yet, Adam said he ran away from Gabriel. Was he running from the scene of the trouble, or was he running from a maniac with a toy club?\n\nSamuel went out through the open front of the house while I waited by the strong wood and metal back door. When Samuel was safely outside I pressed the buttons to close the big doors. I opened the back door and stepped into the yard, still holding the door handle. I turned to look back at the house, then let go of the heavy door. A strong wind from the pond blew the door shut with surprising force. The door closed loudly. It was a pretty mild day, but the wind still had enough strength to close the door powerfully.\n\nI walked past the pool to the back fence and looked out at the pond. The wind was warm and steady from the water. I went to the back house door and opened it again. When I let go of the handle the wind from the pond closed the door again.\n\nI looked around the yard area. The Gabriel's main house was one level, but high ceilings inside made it a tall structure. I guessed the top of the roof at about twenty feet. Thanks to the tight spaces, the house next door on the right side was only a few steps away from Gabriel's pool area. The house had two levels and was taller than Gabriel's house by several feet. The homes were separated by tall trees and many plants.\n\nThe wind from the pond was pushed between the two homes to the front of the green lot and the two-story, separate guesthouse. The two buildings made a wind path that moved enough wind from a mild breeze to make a strong gust to close a heavy door loudly.\n\nI left the garden and joined Samuel in front of the green house.\n\n\"Why were you slow?\" he asked.\n\n\"I went for a swim.\" The air was still in front of the green house and it was a bit warmer than the garden. \"Actually, I was trying to remember the simple rules of how things work that I didn't learn in school.\"\n\n\"And what did you remember?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" I admitted.\n\n\"Do you have any guesses?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, I think so.\"\n\n\"You're kidding.\" He lifted his eyebrows.\n\n\"My guess might be silly,\" I accepted, \"but I'm not kidding.\"\n\n\"I'm listening,\" he told me.\n\n\"Don't work too hard,\" I said, \"because I'm not talking. I need to collect my thoughts into a good story.\"\n\nWe said goodbye and got into our cars. I let Samuel go first, and then I drove to the nearby area of old homes and the blue house.\n\nYoung Benjamin was in front of the white house cleaning off the big, blue star I had drawn near the front door. The bright blue paint was hard to remove unless you had a strong cleaner and a brush. I didn't know what he was using but the blue paint dripped down the side of the house changing the color of the walls.\n\nI stopped my car in front of the house and watched the little boy clean. He was dressed all in black and had very short hair on the sides of his head and a small, short stripe of hair running down the middle. He was different. I had met different kids in a far away city years ago and recently at the big supermarket in the large mall. I didn't really like them. Benjamin was short, with a plain face and normal features, except for a pair of empty blue eyes that looked at me when he noticed I was there. I looked back, trying to show him with a smile that I was the one who had drawn on his walls. Just then, Father Benjamin came out of the house carrying a bucket and a brush. He was a tall man with big shoulders. His light-colored hair was very short, and his strong neck supported a wide, flat, serious face. Father and son both looked at me now.\n\nI moved the little car slowly past the house. They watched me suspiciously. I put my left arm out of the open driver's window and waved at them, then showed them my upset.\n\n## Chapter 20\n\nAbout Living and Dying\n\nI laid down on the couch in my rented living room and turned on the TV. I looked at my watch. It was late in the afternoon of another sunny day in my city. But today was different from the sunny afternoons before. Today was the last day of David's life. By now, he was getting medicine at the hospital to make him feel better. They say you can't die in your own dreams, but what if you dream while you're dying?\n\nA famous movie with Katherine and Henry was on TV. I'd watched it before. Katherine looked great. It would be a long time before she would start shaking from being old. I guess the best we can hope for is to get old before we get sick.\n\nDavid was sixty-six years old when he found out he was sick. He would be sixty-seven when he died. He would be thirty-seven years younger than his amazing mom was when she died.\n\nDavid had agreed to go to a special place that afternoon, only ten days after telling me the Robert story. David didn't want to go. He wanted to stay with his wife and family. He wanted to play games and cards with his friends. He wanted to watch his little ones grow up. But when his friend, Father Thomas, told David it was okay for him to say good-bye to his family on earth and join his family in a far away place, David agreed. With his church's blessing, David was prepared to go to the special place he had been promised since the beginning of his life.\n\nI was at the special place when David made his decision to leave us, and I wanted to shout, \"Stay here with us. There is no special place!\"\n\nBut I didn't want to disrupt his peace of mind and the strong belief of his family. And what did I know anyway? Maybe there was a special place, and David could be a good player when he got there. Every time David talked about being a good player, his buddies would say, \"Yeah, sure, David, in your next life.\" Maybe now David was only a heartbeat away from being a good player.\n\nWhether there was a special place or not, though, I had things I was worried about in this life.\n\nMy relationship with Alice was stuck. We had talked only once since the night I left her house, and our last chat was strange.\n\nAlice's way was to keep away from problems. My way was to face problems.\n\n\"The Browns never did anything to you,\" she said.\n\n\"They won't get a chance.\"\n\n\"Fighting doesn't solve anything.\"\n\n\"Army group thinks that fighting solves everything.\"\n\n\"So your answer is to be like them?\"\n\n\"No, my answer is to be tougher than them.\"\n\nAlice and I didn't talk again after that chat. There was nothing to talk about. We were from different worlds. In my world, you had to stand up to bad people like the Browns.\n\nI fell asleep watching a movie with two famous actors playing in the water. Somewhere between asleep and awake, I understood that David was leaving and Alice was gone.\n\n\" _You pay. You pay,_ \" I heard from far away.\n\nI tried to open my eyes, but they felt heavy.\n\n\" _You pay. You pay,_ \" I heard again.\n\nI managed to open one eye, and I saw the faces of the men who had tried to hurt me in the place where sick people go. This time I wasn't sleepy from medicine. I jumped up from the couch, and moved towards the two men. There were no tubes to slow me down. There was a small table. I bumped my legs on the hard corner of the table and fell down. I rolled onto my back and looked up. There were two faces on the TV. I was confused. I sat up on the floor and looked at the TV screen. The older man was smiling at me, and I heard him say, \"You buy. You pay. You go away. We pay. Right, Harry?\"\n\n\"That's right, Dad!\"\n\nWords appeared on the screen:\n\nBE RICH! BARRY & FRIENDS.\n\nIt was a commercial for a local company.\n\n\"And now back to our movie.\"\n\n\"Silly!\" I told myself when I understood that I had been tricked by a father-and-son team.\n\n\"You buy (our thing), you pay (the money), you go away, we pay (the money back).\"\n\nI chose not to tell anyone.\n\nI got up from the floor and looked at my watch. It was still early evening and there was still lots of time to play another game of Follow the Game, the same game I had been playing all week.\n\nI quickly cleaned up and put on my black play clothes. I put my toy in the back pocket of my pants and hid it under a jacket. When I opened the door to my home, I thought again and took the toy out of my pants and put it away. I knew if it was too easy to reach, I would be tempted to play a prank on a rude person. Without any toys, I drove my small car to the big shopping center. I turned on the radio to a nice music station. It played great soft music for everyone. A song was just ending and an advertisement came on.\n\n\"If you buy something, you pay. If something breaks, we pay!\"\n\n## STORY 21\n\nRUDE PEOPLE\n\nMeaning of Rude Person: \"Someone who is not nice, doesn't behave well, a not nice, unaware person.\"\n\nWhere it comes from: \"An old tribe that was not nice a long time ago.\"\n\nI had been watching Adam for a week and he was the same every day. He would park on the right side of the shopping center, where he would meet four friends. There were two tall white boys and two big, not pretty white girls. They all had not nice skin. Even though they were all different, these rude people looked very similar. They wore big black clothes, simple decorations, had different colored hair and pictures on their skin, with decorations in their noses, lips, eyebrows, and ears.\n\nThe kids wandered aimlessly through the big store, laughing at shoppers and sometimes bumping into small, old people for fun. The security guards at the store kept these naughty kids quiet inside. The problem happened when Adam and his friends were outside. In the quiet areas of the car park, I saw them damaging car tires and bending antennas. Yesterday evening, I watched as they drew bad symbols on the side of a new, black car. I saw some red spots, but I didn't do anything. I wanted to catch these naughty kids for something more serious than drawing on cars. Maybe tonight would be my lucky night.\n\nFrom the shadows of the car park lights, I saw the shapes of two big girls, two skinny teenage boys, and short Adam. The five of them stopped at an old, rusty car and damaged all four tires. I wanted to teach all five of them a lesson, but not over four car tires. While they were drawing on the old gray car doors, I saw two people slowly coming. A young brown girl was helping an older black lady who was using a walker. When the young girl saw what Adam and his friends had done to her car, she walked ahead of the older lady and started yelling at the group. I couldn't hear her words, but I saw her waving her arms and shouting. Then a big fuss happened. Ryan punched the brave lady in the face, making her fall. I saw the big girls laugh and nudge each other. One of the boy bullies pushed the old lady to the ground and kicked her walking aid away. I was out of my car and running toward the trouble as quickly as I could. My right knee hurt, but I didn't mind the pain. I saw the third boy kick at the old lady who tried to protect herself with her hands up. She got a kick to her side.\n\n\"Meanie,\" she shouted, and moved her own weak leg in a weak try to kick the boy who was bothering her.\n\nThe bully who had made the old lady fall was pulling back his foot slowly, looking for a good spot to kick the old woman again. I got there while the bully's foot was still pulled back. Using a soccer-style swing, I kicked the bully's raised foot from under him and pushed him forward so that he fell face-first on the ground with a splat sound. The big girls stopped laughing. They stared like they had seen a car bump. Ryan was too busy pulling at the young lady's shirt and top to notice the loud thud his friend's face made.\n\nThe boy who had flattened the tires turned toward me with his small knife in his hand. I thought the sharp thing was about as long as my finger. It wasn't a big sword, but it was long enough to pop something bigger than an old ball. The sight of the sharp thing didn't stop me from going closer. I was doing what I knew how to do: Go!\n\nThe boy squatted and pointed the sharp thing at me. I squatted and held my hands out to my sides, waiting for him to go first. We looked at each other. He looked familiar. The ring on his nose made me recognize him.\n\n\"You should not have left the money box at the supermarket,\" I said to him.\n\nWith a quick motion of my right hand, I grabbed the ring on the bottom of his nose and pulled it out. That kid sure could scream. Both hands went to his nose, and one of the big girls said, \"Ewww, yucky. Let's go.\"\n\n\"You meanie,\" the hurt Goth said. \"I'll get you.\"\n\nHe took his hand with the sharp thing away from his bleeding nose, just long enough for me to grab his wrist and pull it toward me. I moved under his arm like I was doing a fun dance step. I was behind the hurt supermarket boy as fast as an old man could do a fancy move, and I twisted his arm as I moved.\n\n\"You knew her name,\" Charlotte said. She looked happy. \"She's strong. She'll be okay.\"\n\n\"Is that the boy you were talking about?\" Quinn asked in a deep voice.\n\n\"Grandma!\"\n\nThe officers came and looked around while the helpers took care of the hurt people. They tried to put Quinn on a bed, but she said no.\n\n\"Those boys need a bed much more than me,\" she said, looking mean at the boys on the ground.\n\nRyan was trying to sit up. The store boy with the hurt bottom was moving and making sounds. The boy lying on the ground was not moving except for his hard breathing.\n\nOne of the officers came to me. \"Ethan, right? I met you when you visited the officer's place with Frank. I'm David.\"\n\n\"Officer David.\" We shook hands.\n\n\"What happened here?\" David asked.\n\n\"Ask her,\" I pointed to Charlotte.\n\nCharlotte explained everything.\n\n\"She called me not nice,\" Ryan said.\n\nWe all looked at him.\n\n\"So, you hit her in the face,\" I said.\n\n\"That's right,\" he said proudly.\n\n\"Ryan, you are not being nice,\" I said.\n\n\"How do you know my name?\" Adam asked.\n\n\"Guess.\"\n\n\"You just happened to be here, Ethan?\" Ben asked.\n\n\"Just a chance,\" I said.\n\n\"It's good he was here,\" Charlotte said. \"That boy over there was ruining my clothes like he wanted to hurt me.\"\n\n\"That's not true,\" Ryan replied. \"I wouldn't hurt anyone like you!\"\n\n\"Oh no?\"\n\nCharlotte stood with her hands on her hips. Her torn shirt opened, showing a ripped black shirt and skin the color of coffee. Mr. Jack noticed.\n\n\"Were you planning to wear my shirt?\"\n\nShe covered herself again and pointed at another boy.\n\n\"That one over there, the one lying on his face, was trying to hurt my grandma.\"\n\n\"What about that boy?\" Ben pointed.\n\n\"The one with the stick in his bottom?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes, him.\"\n\n\"I took his stick away.\"\n\n\"You'll have to come with us and tell us what happened,\" Officer Ben said.\n\n\"Of course,\" I promised.\n\n\"You too, miss,\" he said to Charlotte.\n\n\"Okay. But what about those big white girls?\"\n\n\"What girls?\" Ben asked.\n\n\"There were two girls with these boys,\" I said. \"They ran away.\"\n\n\"How would you describe them?\" Ben asked me.\n\n\"Two chubby, plain white girls dressed in black,\" Quincy said.\n\n\"Adam?\"\n\n\"I couldn't have said it better myself,\" I agreed. \"I'm sure you'll find them. They don't blend in real well in BO city.\"\n\nThe three boys were taken away in the ambulance, but Quincy didn't want to go with them. I told Officer Ben that we would meet them at the SE police station to tell our story.\n\n\"Thank you for helping us,\" Charlotte said.\n\n\"Yeah, thank you, Adam,\" Quincy said to me. \"You a good guy. No wonder my granddaughta talk so nice about you.\"\n\n\"Grandma!\" Charlotte said.\n\n\"You need to get a guy like Adam here, girl. You single, right?\"\n\nI nodded and smiled.\n\n\"So how about the brown-haired girl over there?\"\n\n\"Grandma!\" Charlotte said.\n\n\"Your granddaughter is beautiful,\" I told Quincy.\n\nQuincy grinned, showing gaps between her front teeth.\n\nWhen we finished telling our story at the police station, it was very late.\n\n\"I'll take you two home, and you can have your car fixed tomorrow,\" I offered.\n\n\"We can take Ms. Penelope home, Ethan,\" Benjamin said. \"Queen is going to the hospital for observation.\"\n\n\"I am not,\" Queen disagreed.\n\n\"Oh yes you are, Grandma,\" Cameron told her. \"That boy may have hurt something. They gotta check you out.\"\n\nQueen looked around. She could see that she was not getting any help.\n\n\"Okay, I'll go to the hospital so long as Ethan there takes my granddaughter home,\" Queen insisted.\n\nCameron rolled her eyes.\n\n\"Okay with you?\" Officer Benjamin asked me.\n\nMr. Jack nudged me.\n\n\"My pleasure,\" I said.\n\n\"We'll get Queen to the hospital and check her in,\" Benjamin said. \"We'll dust their car for prints, look for clues, and have it moved to our garage. You can get it in the morning.\"\n\nMr. Jack was wide awake.\n\n## CHAPTER 22\n\nTHE QUEEN AND I\n\nFrank barged in the main entrance of the BO police station just as we were preparing to leave. The large, angry man demanded that his son be released immediately. Red spots started playing tag in front of my eyes the moment he entered the room. He was a scary presence, and he knew it. What he didn't know, however, was that I couldn't be scared.\n\nOfficer Frank arrived just as I was standing in front of the mean man. Frank was called from his house because of the seriousness of the situation. Frank told the man that the other man wasn't going anywhere until the morning, when he would be moved to the big city prison.\n\n\"That's not fair,\" the man shouted.\n\n\"Keep talking like that and you can stay with him,\" Frank said calmly.\n\n\"Listen, Officer Frank,\" the man tried to be calm, \"you and I have met before.\"\n\n\"Yes, we have, Mr. Man,\" Frank said, looking at me. \"Your house was messed up not too long ago.\"\n\n\"Then you know we're local homeowners,\" the man tried. \"And not a risk to run away. We're good people of our town.\"\n\n\"I know you're a not so good person,\" I said.\n\nThe man looked at me like I was a tiny bug. I guess from his view I was.\n\n\"I know who you are.\" He looked down at me. \"You're that police officer from the big city everyone thinks is so special.\"\n\n\"Me? No, I'm no one special at all,\" I pretended to be humble before showing anger. \"I'm just a little guy who stood up to your son while he was being mean to that nice-looking lady over there.\"\n\nJust for fun, I pointed to Queen.\n\n\"Yes, that's right,\" Queen said.\n\nEven Charlotte stopped looking angry to smile. I saw Benjamin smirk.\n\n\"That black lady?\" Ben asked.\n\nI saw a black policeman in the other room look up from his paper and make a sad face.\n\n\"I want you to know,\" I said, \"that this lady is a great-great granddaughter of a king from the HA country.\"\n\n\"What king from the HA country?\" Ben seemed very angry, so I made him even more angry.\n\n\"HA country only had one king, you silly person,\" I said.\n\n\"Who are you calling silly?\" Ben took a big step toward me.\n\nI stepped toward him. Benjamin stepped between us.\n\n\"Mr. Ben,\" Benjamin said strongly, \"please don't be angry. Ethan, be nice with your words.\"\n\n\"You people think I believe that my son tried to hurt that old lady,\" Ben spoke loudly.\n\n\"Mr. Ben.\" Benjamin raised his voice. \"Firstly, I'm not of that religion. I believe in something else.\"\n\n\"He doesn't like those who believe in something else too, Frank,\" I said in between.\n\n\"And secondly\"--Benjamin didn't listen to me--\"your son did not try to hurt _that_ woman.\" He pointed at Queen. \"He's not nice to _her_.\" He pointed to the sweet Charlotte sitting quietly in the corner. \"He hurt her face and tried to ruin her shirt,\" Benjamin explained.\n\nDavid gave Charlotte a mean look.\n\n\"People who are different.\" David was angry. \"You will all be sad you met me,\" David said.\n\n\"I'm sad already,\" I told him.\n\nDavid walked toward the front door.\n\n\"Not nice,\" I said as he passed me.\n\nHe looked angry but didn't stop.\n\n\"I think that was okay,\" I said when David was gone.\n\n\"That man doesn't like anyone,\" Quinn observed correctly. \"What do you think he feels about magic?\"\n\n\"I'm sure he doesn't like magic too, Quinn,\" I said.\n\n\"Yeah, well, I'll make a toy of him and play a trick,\" she laughed.\n\nThe officer in the other room laughed.\n\nQuinn left with Officer Benjamin for the hospital. Charlotte and I went to DE beach in my little car. It took about a short time on the big road to get to DE and another short time driving on a big street to reach the area known as OP park. I followed Charlotte's directions to a neighborhood of small houses.\n\nThe roads were clean. The yards were small. The houses were white. The people had dark skin. The only light-skinned face I saw was my own in the car's mirror, and I didn't look very good.\n\nI stopped the little car in front of the house she pointed out. The one-level house was just like the other houses on the road.\n\n\"Would you like to come in?\" she asked.\n\n\"No, that's okay,\" I said. \"You must be very tired.\"\n\n\"Actually I'm not,\" she told me. \"I'm still excited. I'd like some company.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Very sure.\"\n\nThe house seemed smaller inside. I looked at family photos on the walls and tables. There were all dark-skinned faces in the pictures except for one photo. There was a light-skinned man, very handsome, with yellow, curly hair standing next to a very beautiful dark-skinned woman. I picked up the picture from the table.\n\n\"Your parents?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, taking the picture from my hands and looking at it thoughtfully. \"Do you know about a very poor country, Ethan?\" she asked.\n\n\"Not much,\" I said. \"I know it's not a rich place.\"\n\n\"It is a very poor place with a troubled past,\" she said.\n\n\"Is that why you came to this country?\"\n\n\"I had no choice,\" she said. \"I had to leave my home.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"It's a long story.\"\n\nI sat down on her small seat. \"Tell it to me.\"\n\n\"I'm very tired,\" she said.\n\n\"You won't be able to rest for a while anyway,\" I said. \"You're too excited. Talk to me.\"\n\nShe sat in a chair across from me. \"Okay,\" she sighed. \"Did you know that a man named Christopher found my home the same year he discovered another big land?\" she began.\n\n\"Wow, he was lucky that year,\" I said.\n\nShe smiled. \"There were a lot of native people in my home when Christopher arrived. After many, many years, there were no more of them because of fights and sickness.\"\n\n\"We also had fights with our native people,\" I reminded her.\n\n\"Yes, you did,\" she said. \"That seemed to be the way of the people from across the sea in those times.\"\n\n\"Not all of them. A man I knew from another land told me that the only difference between our land and his land was that his ancestors didn't fight with their native people.\"\n\n\"Interesting way to see things,\" she said.\n\n\"It's a way to make himself feel better,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, anyway,\" she continued, \"Christopher claimed the island for his country and gave it a new name. The people who lived there first were slowly replaced by workers brought by two big countries. These workers did all the hard work there for many years.\n\n\"Still sounds like a big country I know,\" I said.\n\n\"There does seem to be a pattern,\" she said. \"But, things began to change there when it was near the end of a long time ago. The spirit of a big change in a place called FR country reached the island and a man named Henry called for a big fight to free the workers.\"\n\n\"How do you know all this?\"\n\n\"My dad, Adam, was a man who worked for his country and liked to learn about the past,\" she explained. \"My mom, Madison, was a smart woman. They wanted us to know where we came from.\"\n\nI showed her I understood.\n\n\"Brave people like Thomas, Jack, and Henry led the workers to freedom by winning a fight against the army from FR country. The workers got their freedom a long time ago.\"\n\n\"The people from FR country lose again,\" I said.\n\n\"They weren't done yet,\" she said. \"A man named Napoleon sent his family member, Charles, and many men to a place to make everything okay again.\"\n\n\"We're talking about _the_ Napoleon?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes, that Napoleon,\" she confirmed.\n\n\"He was short like me,\" I said.\n\n\"I think he was shorter than you,\" she laughed. \"But you both seem quite strong.\"\n\n\"It's about a small person,\" I told her. \"So what happened to Liam?\"\n\n\"Henry welcomed Liam to HA country with open arms,\" she said. \"And Liam thanked the kindness by making his friend go away to a cold place in the FR country mountains where he was very cold.\"\n\n\"What about Liam?\"\n\n\"He stayed on the island to make things right.\"\n\n\"So Henry was cold in the mountains while Liam was hot in HA country?\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" she said. \"A lot of people from FR country in HA country got sick and went to sleep forever. Most of the soldiers were ill. By the time another big event happened in HA country, the people from FR country were too tired to stop it. The people from HA country won easily. FR country finally left the island long ago and then HA country became the first black country in the west.\"\n\n\"So why didn't everyone be happy after that?\" I asked.\n\n\"My father thought that the leaders in HA country were not good and the people were too quick to change,\" she said.\n\n\"All the leaders couldn't be bad,\" I said.\n\n\"Maybe not,\" she agreed. \"But from a long time ago to an even longer time ago HA country had many leaders and not one of them was asked to leave. They were made to leave or worse.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, worse?\"\n\n\"In the old days, President Gabriel was in danger.\"\n\n\"You're making that up,\" I said, not believing it, and I laughed for some reason.\n\n\"No, it's real.\" She tried not to laugh, covering her mouth with both hands.\n\n\"Why are we laughing?\" I asked.\n\n\"It's so strange, I suppose,\" she said, with a sigh. \"But it's true. After only a short time as president, Gabriel was blamed for hurting lots of people. The townspeople were angry and went to find him the next day.\"\n\n\"What do you mean they went to find him?\"\n\n\"A group of people chased Gabriel from his house to the FR building where he tried to hide.\"\n\n\"Did the people from FR country help him?\"\n\n\"No way,\" she said. \"Some important people from his town, dressed in fancy clothes, pulled Gabriel from the house and threw him over a tall fence to a crowd around the building.\"\n\n\"Was he already hurt when they threw him over? I mean did they throw him over bit by bit?\"\n\n\"No, they threw the whole man over the fence,\" she told me. \"The crowd on the other side hurt him. Isn't that strange?\"\n\n\"That's one way to put it,\" I said. \"Then what happened?\"\n\nShe got up from the chair and walked to a shelf with books. She took out a picture book. She sat down with the book on her lap and flipped through the pages until she found what she wanted. She took out a fancy news story. \"Here, read this. It's a copy from an old news story written by a young person from a faraway country who was there a long time ago.\"\n\n\"Why did your family keep this paper for so long?\"\n\n\"Read it first and then I'll explain.\"\n\nI held the news story up to the light and read the words written a long time ago. \"Something big and loud happened. I could see that something or someone was on the ground in the middle of the crowd, right before the big doors. When a man got out of the crowd and ran past me, shouting loudly, and holding a hand, I knew something very important had happened.\" I stopped reading. \"Wow,\" I said. \"I can't believe this.\"\n\n\"Finish reading,\" she insisted.\n\n\"Other men came with parts of a body shown on sticks, each one followed by a crowd of shouting men and women.\" I gave the paper back to her. \"Interesting,\" I said. \"And why is this news story important to you?\"\n\n\"The man who was close to the president was my grandpa,\" she said seriously.\n\n\"Go away!\"\n\n\"It's true,\" she said.\n\n\"So, your grandpa was the president's best friend,\" I said.\n\nShe smiled a bit at my silly joke. \"I like to think of him as someone who didn't agree with the government,\" she said.\n\n\"Are we talking about Queen's husband?\" I asked\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"His name was Charles.\"\n\n\"Do you act like him?\" I asked.\n\n\"In some ways I do.\"\n\nI sat on my hands.\n\n\"You're safe,\" she said, acting like I was joking.\n\n\"Good,\" I said, putting my hands on my legs. \"Do you remember your grandpa?\"\n\n\"Not a lot,\" she said. \"Mostly I know what Queen told me. She said my grandpa was very angry.\"\n\n\"What was he angry about?\"\n\n\"He was angry at the men who took his family member, Tamu, from her house in NI country and brought her to HI place with chains. He was angry at the farm owner Peter who had a baby with Tamu when she was fifteen and didn't want the baby because the baby was very black. He was angry at his family for letting a few white men have a lot of black people work for them. He didn't like being of mixed race because he felt like he didn't fit in either the white or black world.\"\n\n\"That's a big negative feeling to have,\" I commented.\n\n\"Yes it is,\" she agreed. \"My grandfather didn't like President Samuel too. So, when Samuel was pushed over the fence, my nineteen-year-old grandfather did something very bad to his right hand and put the hand in his mouth by the thumb. He stopped on purpose in front of people from the EU country and showed them the hand. He wanted everyone to know that the people of HA country would protect their freedom with the same strength they used against President Samuel.\"\n\n\"People in the US country are not scared of thumb suckers,\" I told her with pride.\n\n\"Be serious,\" she replied without much joy. \"My grandfather was a courageous man.\"\n\n\"He was brave,\" I agreed. \"But don't you think his actions were a bit too much?\"\n\n\"Maybe he could have been more self-controlled,\" she commented.\n\n\"Maybe he could have used some strong calming medicine,\" I added. \"My grandfather was also a very brave and fearless man.\"\n\n\"Tell me about him.\"\n\n\"Another time,\" I answered. \"It's still your turn.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" she said as if she had a lot more to say. \"A few days after Samuel was hurt, President William sent soldiers into PO city to bring back peace. He said they would only be there for a short while.\"\n\n\"Were they there for a short while?\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"They stayed in HA country for a long time.\n\n\"Why am I not surprised?\" I said, thinking of our country's current rules.\n\n\"HA country was under the control of a different country again and this made my grandpa, Gabriel, very upset,\" Charlotte continued.\n\n\"Your grandpa, Gabriel, had a thing with control, didn't he?\" I interrupted. \"And are you trying to tell me he wasn't upset when he hurt Sam?\"\n\n\"Of course he was upset then.\" She was getting impatient with my jokes. \"But now he was upset with our country.\"\n\n\"Can I ask something?\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\"What did he do then?\"\n\n\"Adam!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"It's a good question,\" I said.\n\n\"You're strange.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" I said. \"But what do you do then? Do you go to a friend and ask if you can help?\"\n\n\"I don't know what happened then.\" She reached across the short space between us and lightly tapped my hands. \"You're silly,\" she said.\n\nI held her hands in mine and kept them. When I didn't let them go immediately she looked into my eyes unsurely. Then she looked down and let her hands go. She seemed worried.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said, not sure why I was sorry. \"Please keep talking.\"\n\nShe told me that her grandpa didn't like others ruling and always fought against U.S. rules. \"Even though he didn't agree with the puppet governments created by AM city, each leader chosen when U.S. soldiers were in HA country stayed for their full time. The first leader picked after the Americans left in the old days, however, was kicked out not long after. A man named DE came after the kicked out EL but he was also kicked out not too long after. The next leader, a man named PM was also kicked out later.\"\n\n\"Not a stable job,\" I said. \"When did Queen become part of the story?\"\n\n\"Charles and Queen met at a gathering against ER shortly after he was chosen a long time ago. My grandpa would have been a grown up at the time. My grandma was still very young.\"\n\n\"They didn't like Leader ER either?\"\n\n\"No, they thought ER was not good, too,\" she said. \"Queen was very political and very pretty. My grandpa didn't have a chance. They got married half a year after they met and Queen had a baby girl not long after.\"\n\n\"Your mom.\"\n\n\"My mom,\" she confirmed. \"They named her Bella and in the old days Bella married Adam, a man from LO city.\"\n\n\"Your dad,\" I said.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied. \"A long time ago, a doctor named Francois became the leader of a place called HA country.\"\n\n\"Papa Doc,\" I recalled. \"I heard he was very bad.\"\n\n\"You're right,\" Charlotte replied. \"Papa Doc turned out to be the meanest leader. He picked a scary group of people to guard him and called them a special name. To look scary, they wore dark glasses even at night.\"\n\n\"Maybe they just wanted to look like a famous musician,\" I joked.\n\n\"There was nothing funny about those men,\" she said quickly.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said. \"I shouldn't have joked about that.\"\n\n\"It's okay,\" she replied. \"Things don't look as scary from far away.\"\n\n\"Did you see much of these scary men?\"\n\n\"Too much,\" she told me. \"I was born a long time ago. I looked more white than black and my grandpa wasn't sure if he liked me or not at first. I became his favorite later.\" She smiled at the memory. \"He was old then and still cared a lot about who was in charge. He voted for Francois because he believed the gentle doctor would make things better. But when everyone realized that Papa Doc was the most dangerous man, it was too late to do anything but run away.\" Smart people left the island in big numbers in something we called the brain leaving. Finally, there were not enough doctors and professional people.\"\n\n\"Why didn't your grandpa go?\"\n\n\"He loved his place and promised to keep trying for change,\" Charlotte said.\n\n\"Wasn't he scared of the mean men in the dark glasses?\"\n\n\"He wasn't scared of anything,\" she said, and I thought of Henry again.\n\n\"What happened to him?\"\n\n\"The mean men ended him,\" she said calmly. \"They hurt him at the back of his head. He was tricked by some friends who weren't as brave as he was.\"\n\n\"Meanies,\" was all I could think of to say.\n\n\"The mean men visited our house the next day,\" she continued. \"I remember the thin man with golden teeth and dark glasses talking to my dad. He told my dad that only his important job was keeping his family safe. He warned my dad that our family would always be watched by a mean leader.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you leave your place then?\"\n\n\"My dad thought he could make things better,\" she said. \"My mom wanted to stay and try to get back at them for what they did to her dad.\" She started to cry. \"The mean leader passed away a long time ago, many years after my grandpa was ended. His silly son, Jack, who was called Little J took over. He was not as rough as his dad but he was not as wise, either. He was big, slow, and lazy. Our money making stopped under his 'leading.' \"\n\n\"Did more people leave?\"\n\n\"Yes. Even my dad stopped. He ended his work in 1980 and made plans to take us to AM country.\"\n\n\"Smart choice,\" I said.\n\n\"Yes, but it was too late,\" she told me sadly.\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\n\"My father got a small plane to take us off the island to MI city,\" she said. \"People told the bad guys we were leaving the country and Little J decided it was not good for a wise worker and his family to leave the island. His answer was to hurt all of us.\"\n\n\"Scary man,\" I said.\n\n\"Yes, a very scary man,\" she said. \"My grandma and I were out of the house doing last things and we left my parents and my younger sister, Daisy, at home.\"\n\n\"Was that the sister who got sick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Tears appeared in her eyes and I was sorry I asked. \"When my grandma and I came home that day we found my mom and dad hurt at the front door. They had both been hurt in the head.\"\n\n\"You don't have to tell me this,\" I said.\n\n\"I want you to know,\" she insisted.\n\n\"Okay, but stop if it's too much for you.\"\n\nShe cleared her throat and continued. \"We heard my sister Diana cry from the big bedroom.\" Charlotte closed her eyes. \"Grace picked up a big kitchen knife from the table and gave it to me. From a cupboard she took the big knife my grandpa had used a long time ago. We moved quietly to the bedroom door that was a little bit open. We could see into the room. Two men stood by the bed laughing while on the bed a third man was being mean to my sister.\"\n\n\"Are you sure you want to talk about this?\"\n\nShe didn't answer me at all and her eyes stayed closed as if she was dreaming. \"My grandma pointed at the two men and then at herself. Next she pointed at me and to the man being mean to Diana. I understood. My grandma moved quickly toward the first man. His hat fell to the floor.\" Charlotte squeezed her eyes tighter. I saw sweat on her face. She was thinking about the past.\n\n\"The second man turned around in time to see what was happening. He bent down but the big knife reached his head. The man being mean to my sister turned to see what was happening and I was there to make him stop. \"I took out the stick and tapped it on his head,\" she said, her voice shaky. She was sad. \"There was juice everywhere.\"\n\n\"Charlotte.\" I moved closer and put my hands on her shoulders. Her eyes opened wide. \"That's enough.\"\n\n\"We left the house, Adam, with my mom and dad and those mean guys inside.\"\n\nI helped her off the chair and hugged her. She cried against me.\n\n\"We traveled by big bird to the AC country,\" she whispered. \"But part of us was left behind in the HT country.\"\n\n\"I get it,\" I soothed her. \"You don't have to talk anymore.\"\n\nCharlotte wrapped her arms around me and cuddled against me. I heard her sniff a few times. We didn't move. We just hugged each other.\n\n\"So, do you still think your grandpa was like mine?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes, for sure,\" I replied. \"They were both very brave.\"\n\n\"Did your grandpa ever do something really big?\"\n\n\"No, but he did scare a big furry animal away when he was only a teenager.\"\n\n\"Sounds like he was very brave,\" she said.\n\n\"Just like your grandpa,\" I said.\n\n\"And like you.\" She looked up at me.\n\n\"Why would you say that?\"\n\n\"I saw you stand up to those mean boys,\" she said. \"You were like a wild puppy.\"\n\n\"I get excited sometimes,\" I said.\n\n\"You're not scared of anything, are you, Ethan?\"\n\n\"No,\" I replied honestly.\n\nSuddenly, she stepped back and opened my shirt like Fiona had done to her shirt. Her nails tickled my chest and I felt like I was playing with a kitten.\n\n\"I might be a little scared of you,\" I admitted.\n\nShe looked at me closely. \"You should be.\"\n\nWe didn't hug. We played, laughed, pushed, tickled, and giggled. We were very warm, and we moved around as if we were playing a fun game. Every game was perfect.\n\nAlice was playing with me, not giving up on our game.\n\n_Keep going,_ I encouraged her. I was proud of myself. After all, I was six years old.\n\nAlice finally lay down on the bed next to me. \"I can't believe you're six years old,\" Alice gasped, looking at me still playing.\n\n\"I am, he's not,\" I told her, pointing to myself. \"He's like Peter Pan. He never grew up.\"\n\n\"I think he grew up just fine,\" she said, and gave me a peck on the cheek.\n\n_I love to sing, yes, yes,_ he sang until he sighed happily, bowed to his friend, and went to bed. _See you next time._\n\nSpending time with Alice was like a nice evening of music. Spending time with Charlotte was like a fun night of loud tunes. I was starting to enjoy all kinds of sounds.\n\nI looked at the granddaughter of a brave man from HA country. She looked back at me, the grandson of a famous person from RU country. We kept looking at each other until we fell asleep.\n\n## CHAPTER 1\n\nGOOD GUYS AND BAD GUYS\n\nThe next day, after a short music time, Charlotte and I were at the car shop, waiting for four new tires to be put on her old car. My phone rang.\n\n\"I heard you did something great again,\" a familiar boy voice said.\n\n\"Of course I did,\" I replied. \"Who is this?\"\n\n\"Your best news friend.\"\n\n\"Gabriel?\"\n\n\"Okay, your second best.\"\n\n\"How are you, Gary?\" I asked the young news writer. He was writing for the PB county news since I shared my story about the bad guys. He had his own page now.\n\n\"I'm at the WP county building,\" Gary told me.\n\n\"Good job,\" I told him. \"But before we talk more, when will you write the story about the kids in the new home?\"\n\n\"It begins tomorrow,\" he told me. \"It's a four-part story in the local news, going on for four days.\"\n\n\"Nice. Did you choose the right words about the special money?\"\n\n\"What do you think?\" he asked simply.\n\n\"Listen, Jack, we need to be very careful, or we'll have every strange person in south FL country trying to adopt Tommy.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" he said quickly. \"And I was very clear. Tommy has a big amount of money saved for growing up and learning. The money is strictly watched by people chosen by the court who have complete power over how the money can be used. And, if Tommy should pass away, the money is gone immediately.\"\n\n\"That should stop people looking for money, don't you think?\"\n\n\"I would think so. But you said you only had one person in mind anyway.\"\n\n\"I'll be sad if it doesn't happen that way.\"\n\n\"Are you sure you want to take a chance with all that money?\" Jack asked.\n\n\"I'm using the money from an old insurance policy I had for my wife. Who knew she'd go first? She'd agree with what I'm doing. Now what about the big building?\"\n\n\"A young boy named Ryan Benjamin was brought there this morning for being mean and trying to hurt a girl last night.\"\n\n\"Oh, that.\"\n\n\"You helped catch him. How did that happen?\"\n\n\"Luck,\" I said. \"I guess the naughty boy said he didn't do it and was let go.\"\n\n\"In our town, they usually let them go,\" Jerry explained. \"The judge let Ryan go if someone paid a lot of money for him.\"\n\n\"That's not good,\" I sighed. \"The boy is not nice.\"\n\n\"Thankfully other people agree with you,\" Jerry said.\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"The people who say if someone did something wrong.\"\n\n\"Really,\" I said. \"What did they do?\"\n\n\"Benjamin David, from the office, quickly gave the information to the court where Judge Adam Jack looked at the case.\"\n\n\"I guess Ryan's friendship with a mean group was told to everyone.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"To Judge Adam by Benjamin.\"\n\n\"Yes again,\" Jerry said.\n\n\"He wasn't let go,\" I said, already knowing what could happen.\n\n\"Almost right,\" Jerry said. \"Judge Adam, with Benjamin telling him to, immediately decided that Ryan Benjamin was not good for people and could run away. He asked for a lot more money for Ryan.\"\n\n\"Benjamin's father got very angry, I think.\"\n\n\"It was more than angry,\" Jack said. \"They had to stop him from yelling at the judge.\"\n\n\"What's next?\"\n\n\"Someone from a group went to the meeting,\" Jack told. \"Outside the building, the person called the group by another name, same as a big group. He said that the group is going to hire a good lawyer, maybe a different person, and ask for a different place. They say that it's hard for a member of their group to get a fair judgement in SO place.\"\n\n\"That sounds a bit strange.\"\n\n\"The strange part ends there, I'm afraid.\" Samuel sighed. \"The group said they plan to show up in PA city. There's a chance here for the big group. They got people of different kinds going against good old groups. It's a natural. The big meeting is set to happen in a week. Henry, leader of the group, has promised that the big group will be there with many people.\"\n\n\"Will there be a big event at MA place to welcome the group?\" I asked.\n\nJack laughed. \"The rich people aren't too happy about the idea of having a lot of rough guys in their area.\"\n\n\"Why not? \"I think bald heads can be nice in their own way, like baby animals,\" I said. I stopped talking to Jack and told Charlotte the story. We spent the next hour talking about bad people, and finally her car was ready.\n\n\"Will I see you again?\" she asked in a quiet voice.\n\n\"I hope so,\" I told her.\n\n\"I wasn't sure.\" She gave a small smile. \"Last night was kind of strange. I didn't know if it was a one-time thing for you.\"\n\n\"I'm not that kind of boy,\" I said.\n\nShe laughed.\n\n\"I'll call you this afternoon at the big building with doctors,\" I promised.\n\nShe looked happy.\n\nI cleaned myself at my home and was getting ready when the small phone rang. A friend of Alice was calling to tell me that David had gone to heaven early in the morning. I felt bad. When David went to heaven, I was having a great time with a beautiful woman who was a bit rough, but also very sweet. By the time I wrote down all the things about the goodbye service, I no longer felt bad. I felt lucky to be alive.\n\nDavid's goodbye service was held the next night at the big chapel in BO city. The service was supposed to start when the sun was going down. I got there early to get a good seat, but the room was already filled.\n\nI waited in a long line to see David's body. I was surprised to see how little was left of him. I said sorry to the family. Charlotte was calm and steady. Her daughters hugged me and showed me their families. I forgot everyone's name quickly.\n\nI stood at the back of the room when the ceremony started. The priest said something about how there was only one God and David was with him in the sky. \"If David didn't make it to the sky,\" Father Thomas said, \"then we all have a problem.\"\n\nA friend of David's from BH city said a few things. He tried to make the mood lighter with stories. \"David was very friendly,\" the man said. \"He had so many friends he thought he was part of their group, except for the faith part.\"\n\nEven I laughed.\n\n\"Does anyone here know why some people don't like others?\" the man asked.\n\nMost of the people there knew the answer. \" _Because they don't like any witnesses_,\" they said together. It was one of David's favorite jokes, and it was a happy moment.\n\nWhen David's friend finished I looked at the crowd. I saw a lot of happy faces and watery eyes. I also saw a small, middle-aged man standing by the exit with his arms crossed over his chest. He was upset, red in the face, and restless. A friend of David's from a NE state was ready to say a few things. I got up from my seat as quietly as I could and said, \"Excuse me,\" all the way down the small row, trying my best not to step on anyone's feet. Sadly, I stepped on a lady's pink-painted big toe. \"Meanie,\" she whispered and spoiled that \"old-time story\" feeling for me. When I could walk in the aisle, I went straight to the upset man who seemed to know I was coming for him. As I got closer, he moved his arms, stepped away from the door and shouted, \"DAVID IS A BAD MAN! HE HURT MY DAD, AND HE SHOULD BE PUNISHED!\"\n\nWords like that are not taken lightly by people who believe in stories about bad places. Personally, I like the idea of a nice place after life, but it's not a choose-your-own-adventure kind of thing.\n\nEveryone had turned toward Ryan's son, who stood bravely in the back of the room. Before anyone could say, \"Be tough with that boy,\" I gently moved his arm behind his back and guided him to the door.\n\n\"You're hurting my arm,\" the man said.\n\nI knew I wasn't hurting him and I kept his arm still until we were outside.\n\n\"You're hurting my arm,\" he said again, quieter this time.\n\n\"No I'm not,\" I said, and let him go.\n\nHe rubbed his shoulder and looked at me. \"He hurt my daddy,\" Ryan's son told me.\n\n\"I heard you before,\" I said. \"And I'm sorry about your daddy.\" I reached out a hand to him.\n\nHe looked at my hand.\n\n\"I'm Ethan,\" I told him.\n\nHe slowly reached out and took my hand. His handshake was soft. \"I know you,\" he said to me. \"I'm David, Ryan's oldest son.\"\n\n\"I know how sad you must be, David. But this is not a good place to talk about it.\"\n\n\"There won't be a talk,\" he said, upset. \"That's the problem. With Alex gone there won't be anything. My daddy's hurt will never be understood, and my family will never feel okay.\"\n\n\"I'm looking into your daddy's hurt right now,\" I told him.\n\n\"I heard something like that,\" he said. \"Why?\"\n\n\"BH place wants to feel okay, too,\" I said.\n\n\"David believes that Adam harmed his dad,\" David said. \"It's settled.\"\n\n\"What if I told you I thought Adam didn't do it?\" I asked.\n\n\"Then I would think you're silly,\" David said. \"If Adam didn't harm my dad, then who did?\"\n\n\"I'm not ready to say yet,\" I said. \"But when I'm done looking into it, you'll hear from me.\"\n\n\"There's no other way to explain what happened,\" David said, but he wasn't mad anymore.\n\n\"Yes there is,\" I disagreed, \"and I'm going to try to show it. I only want you to promise not to bother Adam's family anymore.\"\n\n\"I wasn't going to,\" he said sadly. \"I just wanted to feel better.\"\n\n\"Will you say sorry to Adam's family if you're wrong?\"\n\n\"I'm not wrong.\"\n\n\"That's not an answer.\"\n\n\"If I'm wrong I'll say sorry,\" David agreed.\n\n\"You're not a bad person,\" I told him.\n\n\"Neither was my dad,\" he told me.\n\nI suggested that David should go away before the rest of the people mourning left. He agreed.\n\n\"You'll hear from me,\" I promised.\n\nThe people mourning left the house a little while later. Everyone was talking about David's loud moment.\n\n\"That mean man,\" Debbie, one of Dom's daughters said to me, her eyes red from crying. \"How could he do something like that?\"\n\nI put a hand on her shoulder. \"He lost his dad, too,\" I reminded her, \"and his dad's going away hasn't been figured out. He's very upset.\"\n\nCarol came up to me with her daughter Lisa. \"Thank you for getting that man out of the room,\" she said. \"That was bad.\"\n\n\"Yes it was,\" I agreed. \"But he really thinks Dominick ended his dad.\"\n\n\"I know.\" Carol tried not to cry. \"It's sad,\" she continued. \"Dominick was such a nice guy. For him to be remembered like this is not fair.\"\n\n\"I used to help stop bad things,\" I said, hugging her. \"I'll see what I can do.\"\n\n## CHAPTER 24\n\nA GOODBYE\n\nThe next morning I was in the front of the _PB Newspaper_ again thanks to Jerry. Charlotte and I read his story under the covers of my bed, where we had spent another night having fun.\n\nJerry's story was called \"Oh What a Night\" and was full of so many nice words about me that even I was impressed with myself. Jack called me \"Sir Ethan the BO Knight.\"\n\nCharlotte rested her head on my chest as I read out loud about \"Ethan's brave help of two girls in trouble.\"\n\nShe gave Mr. Jackson a nice hug. \"My hero,\" she said with a big sigh.\n\n\"Be careful,\" I told her. \"He'll get too proud.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" she giggled.\n\nJack's writing talked about my work in BO city and pointed out the good things I had done since I moved to BO. He said that I had become a helper in FR state and was helping with problems for BO Heights with the BO police. The writing also said that lots, maybe thousands of people from AA were planning to come to PB city the next week.\n\nAA had gotten permission to walk in the PB city streets to show they were unhappy about RB's arrest. The permission was given for the day the PB city people met to talk about the RB case. Calling the whole thing a \"bad plan,\" AA's helpers were not only asking for a new place but a sorry too.\n\nJack identified me as the only person who saw it. I'm sure Jack meant well, but I felt as if he had made me a target for the people of AA.\n\nI turned to the city part of the paper and found the first part of the four-part series about taking care of foster kids I asked for. The story is about a bright, young boy named Thomas. He was a perfect child to adopt.\n\nCharlotte went to work at a place where they help sick people, and I went to David's goodbye ceremony at a big church in PA city. It was a new building, very tall. Soft sunlight came through the colored windows and made the church look warm and peaceful. It was a nice day even though David was gone. Rain would have been more fitting.\n\nThere were many, many people in the church, and I thought almost all of them were from one group of people who follow certain beliefs. Maybe six people from another group were there, not including the family, the church leader, the helper boy, and the helper man.\n\nI knew people were looking at me. More and more people knew about me because I stopped bad things from happening. I smiled at people I knew and was surprised to see Alice in front of me. She turned around to look at me, and the first thing I did was imagine her with no clothes. Mr. Jack woke up. What silly boys we can be.\n\nShe smiled.\n\nI nodded.\n\nMr. Jack moved a little. _What 's happening?_ he asked.\n\nShe whispered, \"I want to talk to you.\"\n\nI nodded again.\n\nThe music of a famous song filled the room as the people carrying David's box walked down the middle of the church. \"A famous song\" is a great work, and it always made me wish I believed in a higher power. The person playing the organ stopped at the end of \"the famous song\" then began playing \"a well-known hymn\". I lost control and used my hand to wipe my nose.\n\n_Why did I do that?_ I wondered.\n\nThe woman to my right passed me a tissue. I cleaned my hand and my face, and I said thank you to the woman without looking at her. By the second part of \"the well-known hymn,\" I had lifted my right arm in the air and lowered my head while I sang. I had seen this done at a special ceremony once. When I first saw this, I thought it looked like fun. It was like waving for a ride while trying not to be seen. I looked around the room and noticed that I was the only person doing the \"wave for a ride.\" I immediately put my arm down. Apparently, the arm-raising was only done at that special ceremony, not everywhere. The woman next to me with the tissues looked at me like I was silly. \"Wrong row,\" I said with a laugh, and kept right on singing.\n\nWhen the leader invited David's friends and family to come forward and take part in a special ritual, the people who believed differently were scared. Charlotte and the close family walked to the leader with their hands folded in front of them. Six of David's friends came after him. They were all from the same church. The whole church time was done in about seven minutes.\n\n\"That was the fastest church time ever,\" Father Thomas said as a joke.\n\nEveryone laughed, and the service ended happily. No one was happy that David was gone, but everyone there was happy that he had lived.\n\n## CHAPTER 2\n\nFUN IN BO CITY\n\nThe week after David's goodbye time, I worked with two helpers. We worked in my home.\n\nPeter was a very tall, skinny man who knew a lot about computers. He had learned a lot from UM school. He showed me that there were two types of pictures you can make on a computer. One type is where you make pictures based on what someone saw. The other type is where you make pictures based on facts found by a helper. Our main helper was a man named Doug who was from BO city. He was an old man who knew a lot about how things work. He had helped the South Florida police with difficult cases since he stopped working at MT school. Our goal was to make a picture that, with David's own words, would show that David did not hurt Robert. Instead, I just said, \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"I was hoping you'd call me last week,\" she said.\n\n\"I wasn't sure you wanted to talk to me. You were not very happy with me the last time we were together.\"\n\n\"I was surprised by what you did,\" she said.\n\n\"You mean none of your other friends would have cleaned a naughty person's house?\"\n\n\"None of my friends would make a mess to solve anything,\" she said.\n\n\"You need new friends.\"\n\n\"You need to learn to behave.\"\n\n\"That's what Dr. Kevin said about me,\" I told her. \"He was the city police doctor who tried to understand why I was always angry and did risky things. He said I got angry easily.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"It means I get angry quickly.\"\n\n\"Eddie, be serious.\"\n\n\"I am being serious,\" I said. \"Sometimes my head feels warm, and I see red spots and get very upset.\"\n\n\"That's not safe,\" she said.\n\n\"It's not like it happens all the time. Someone really has to upset me.\"\n\n\"Like when a girl is being bothered.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\" I nodded.\n\n\"Did you get angry when you cleaned the bad man's house?\"\n\n\"No,\" I told her. \"I was calm and completely in control.\"\n\n\"Why would you do such a thing?\"\n\nI wished to explain to Alice that some people, like the bad ones, would not be friendly to her, even if she invited them for a special dinner. I wanted her to know that those who behave badly find it easier to take from others rather than earn for themselves.\n\nBut I didn't say anything to her that day. I just shrugged and said, \"That's just how I am.\"\n\nI went to sleep in my bed and had a dream that I was at a very bad meeting a long time ago.\n\n\"You can get further with a kind word and a toy, than with a kind word alone,\" the bad man yelled.\n\nThe crowd yelled right back at him, \"We agree, big guy.\"\n\n\"If you win, no one will ask if you told the truth,\" the bad man told them.\n\n\"Goodbye, friends,\" the crowd shouted.\n\n\"The only thing money won't buy is not having money,\" the bad man told them.\n\n\"We didn't know that,\" the crowd exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes, we are not nice. We want to be not nice. It is an honorable title.\" The bad man was giving a big speech.\n\n\"Go away, friends!\" The excited kids shouted out loud.\n\n\"Give me a B!\" the man with a mustache shouted in my dream.\n\n\"B!\" the group of naughty children gave out a loud B.\n\n\"Give me an A!\" Adam did a somersault on the stage in his shorts.\n\n\"Here's your A!\" the united children responded.\n\n\"Give me an R!\" Adam shouted.\n\n\"R!\" cheered those who were looking forward to the game.\n\nFinally, the word 'bar' was spelled. The children clapped and cheered.\n\nI woke up and walked to the bathroom. I had been getting up a lot at night since I turned six. As I stood waiting at the bathroom, I thought about my dreams. I had been doing a lot of standing and waiting at the bathroom lately, too.\n\nI concluded that in Alice's happy world, the B-A-R cheer would have spelled the word 'Barn' and everyone would have danced joyfully afterward.\n\nI walked back to bed hoping my dream would not continue from where it left off. I had a strange dream.\n\nI was standing inside the gate of a big house on a busy road. A crowd of people wanted to come inside. The family living there was trying to open the gate from inside. All the people living in the big house had left for a trip on a large ship. I was the only one left when the crowd broke the weak gate and rushed into the big house. I waved a special knife over my head and tried to stop them.\n\nBefore the crowd could hurt me I fell from my bed and landed on the floor.\n\nBy our fourth day at work, Adam and Patrick had made a lot of progress. Their computer model was starting to move.\n\n\"I wish I knew what you guys are doing,\" I said, feeling I wasn't helping.\n\nAdam comforted me. \"I'll teach you, Eddie. Patrick and I are making a computer pretend-thing.\"\n\n\"Is that the same as a computer cartoon?\" I asked.\n\n\"No,\" Patrick replied. \"A computer cartoon is pictures made by a computer where each picture is changed a little to make it look like it's moving. A pretend-thing is harder. It needs a lot of smart rules of how things move and count. A computer pretend-thing is like the real thing, with smart people saying it's right.\"\n\n\"So, the cartoon is a kind of story, and the game is the story with real things.\"\n\n\"Real things,\" David said. \"We're using David's words and checking if his story is true with science.\"\n\n\"Will the final game tell us something for sure?\"\n\n\"I think so.\" Patrick smiled. \"If we use the right real things, we can show exactly what happened.\"\n\n\"Is my idea possible?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes, it's possible. We'll know for sure tomorrow.\"\n\n\"When will the game be done?\"\n\n\"The day after tomorrow, I hope,\" Patrick sighed.\n\n\"I really thank both of you,\" I said. \"People may not always be fair, but maybe we can help a man's story.\"\n\n\"That's why we're here.\" David said for both of them.\n\nWe all agreed.\n\nI talked to Thomas that night and told him everything.\n\n\"Do you need help?\" he asked.\n\nI told him I didn't need help.\n\n\"I can't believe it,\" Thomas laughed. \"You're on TV more than when you were in BE city. It's amazing.\"\n\nWe both laughed.\n\n\"Everyone here is proud of you,\" he said.\n\n\"Thanks. That means a lot to me.\"\n\n\"How's your sore knee?\"\n\n\"I feel like a young boy most days,\" I told him.\n\n\"That's good,\" Thomas said. \"And your friends?\"\n\n\"I feel like an old man most nights,\" I joked.\n\n\"Are you playing with anyone?\n\n\"Actually, I'm playing with two girls,\" I bragged.\n\n\"They aren't from JE city, are they?\"\n\n\"One of them is.\"\n\n\"Play with the other one,\" Thomas advised.\n\n\"Why? You have a friend from JE city.\"\n\n\"She bothers me,\" he laughed.\n\nI called Alice and got her voice box. I left a small message saying I would call again.\n\nI saw Charlotte once during the week. I hurried to get her into bed, where I fell right asleep. She waited until the next morning to tease me.\n\nI was at home on the day five of the game when I got a call from Jack of the _PB city News_.\n\n\"Good work on the care for others stories, Jack,\" I complimented him. \"I read all four.\"\n\n\"A lot of people read them,\" he said.\n\n\"Did you get any calls?\"\n\n\"More than a hundred,\" he said. \"But most importantly I got the call you were hoping for.\"\n\n\"Matthew called?\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"After the second story.\"\n\n\"That was two days ago. \"Why didn't you tell me?\"\n\n\"I wanted to let things move along a bit.\"\n\n\"I guess they did,\" I said.\n\n\"Yes. In fact, I'll let Matthew tell you himself,\" Jack surprised me.\n\n\"Hi, Ethan.\" Matthew was speaking. \"I guess you were testing me, huh?\"\n\n\"Not really,\" I said. \"I didn't want to put you in a tough spot, Matthew. So, I just asked Jack to put the news in the paper, and I hoped for the best. Plus it was a good story, and it might help other kids.\"\n\n\"It was a good story,\" Matthew agreed. \"My wife and I went to see Thomas and told him we wanted to adopt him.\"\n\n\"He must have been really happy.\"\n\n\"He was,\" Matthew told me. \"He wanted to know if you could be his uncle.\"\n\n\"He told the people at the place where he was staying I was his grandfather,\" I reminded him.\n\n\"Now you have to decide,\" Matthew said.\n\n\"Tell him I'll be his best friend,\" I chose.\n\n\"Good choice,\" Matthew said. \"About the gift, Ethan,\" Matthew went on. \"My wife and I feel funny taking your gift.\"\n\n\"I didn't give you anything,\" I said. \"It's for Thomas.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm just a little uneasy.\"\n\n\"Don't be,\" I told him. \"Is your wife happy?\" I asked.\n\n\"She's been holding the baby all day,\" Matthew said. \"She can't stop crying, she's so happy. We both feel bad that we didn't do this earlier.\"\n\n\"Well, you had your own family to think about,\" I said. \"You shouldn't feel bad.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" Ethan said.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Matthew said.\n\nWe finished talking on the phone.\n\n\"I thought I was your best friend,\" Mr. Jack said when I was done talking on the phone.\n\n\"You're my closest and oldest friend,\" I assured him.\n\n\"That's okay,\" Mr. Jack said.\n\nBy the end of the day, we had our first pretend computer game about the time when Ryan got hurt.\n\n## CHAPTER 2\n\nAT THE CLUBHOUSE\n\nThere were a lot of people in the clubhouse dining room waiting for the start of the David and Ryan's show. The room was set up with rows of chairs like a movie theater instead of the usual restaurant setup. There was a big screen at the front of the room. David and Patrick were getting everything ready. It was a Sunday night, a week after Roger's trouble, and just a few days before his big meeting. The meeting had been announced by notes and signs at the entrance of each neighborhood.\n\nIn the evening, I tapped the little speaking tool, and the listeners became quiet.\n\n\"Thank you all for being here,\" I started. \"Tonight we will show a pretend play of what we think happened to Ryan last year. A pretend play is like acting out a story using science and numbers. We are happy with our pretend play.\"\n\n\"What if we don't like it?\" The quiet time was over. I knew it was Samuel's voice. Samuel was a smart man from SC town. He loved to talk a lot during meetings. Some people called him \"the Teacher,\" others called him a not-so-nice name.\n\n\"Mr. Samuel,\" I said, \"there is nothing I can do if you don't like it. You can like or dislike the pretend play. We are not taking any questions.\"\n\n\"What do you mean you're not taking any questions?\" Another voice was heard. \"What is this, a bossy place?\"\n\nBing. A red spot. I knew I didn't like this kind of talk. \"Think of it as a story,\" I said. \"This is not a friend's meeting where your thoughts are asked for.\"\n\n\"You can't tell us what to do,\" Sam told me. \"If we want to ask or say something we will.\"\n\nRED!RED!RED! RED! RED!\n\nI put down the small talking thing and left the stage. This was not for me. I asked David to take my place. Patrick made the room dark. A two-part picture of David and Robert showed up. Both big, healthy-looking men who were not alive anymore showed up on the screen. The arguing in the room stopped. Not being alive anymore makes people think about what's important and what's not.\n\n\"Boys and girls, my name is Dr. David. I'm a scientist and I used to be a teacher of science at a big school.\" David's voice was strong. \"I have made lots of computer pictures used in hard court cases all over this country. My work has never been questioned. I was asked to work with Ethan to remember things that happened on a night in a time long ago, to make clear and hopefully end to the sad events that led to Robert not being alive anymore.\"\n\nDavid pointed to Patrick, who stood up. \"Patrick is good at playing with pretend computers. Patrick used Ethan's detective ideas and my smart thoughts to make the pretend computer show you will see. I think it's really good.\" David moved to one of the pretend computers and hit buttons. The pretend computer showed a pretend version of Ryan's garage. David hit buttons until he showed every part of the garage. He hit the stop button.\n\n\"Boys and girls,\" David said, talking like a teacher, \"you have just gone on a pretend tour of the late Ryan's garage as it looked the night he went away. Every size is just right from every side.\" He took a big breath. \"Now we'll make this pretend tour move,\" he went on. \"Making things move is like changing a picture little by little to make it look like it's moving. Our brains can't see more than ten pictures every second. At ten to sixteen pictures every second the moving pictures look like an old movie. When there are more than sixteen pictures every second the moving pictures look smoother. Real movies show at twenty-four pictures every second and TV shows are thirty. Our moving pictures show at thirty pictures every second so it is very clear. Now I'm going to ask Detective Ethan to talk again,\" David said.\n\nI went back to the front and gave him a high-five. \"You would be a great animal trainer,\" I whispered in his ear. \"Before David passed away,\" I began, \"he allowed me to record his story. These are his words.\"\n\nI pressed a few buttons and David's face showed on the screen. The room was silent. \"Is it on?\" The voice of David filled the room. \"It is? Okay. Well, my name is David, and I'm probably not here anymore.\"\n\nAll the kids were listening.\n\nDavid started coughing. \"Ethan, can I have that mask, please?\" The kids heard David breathe in some fresh air. His smiling picture stayed on the screen. \"Sorry,\" David said. \"Anyway, this is not me saying sorry because I didn't do anything bad. I didn't hurt anyone. But I am very sick, so I have no reason to lie.\" More coughs. \"Robert and I were never best friends, but we weren't mean to each other either. When the group took over the Big Club a while ago, Robert and I started to disagree on many things. We argued about rules, club rules, and new things. You name it, and we argued about it. This went on for a long time. I didn't think it was a big problem. People disagree all the time. Then, at one meeting, Robert and I had a big argument. We're both big boys and I guess we're not afraid to speak up. Anyway, he started shouting at me, so I shouted at him. Before you know it the meeting got very loud, and everyone went home feeling upset.\" More coughing. More air. \"I didn't think much of it, but the next night I get a call from a friend of mine telling me that Gabriel sent a message to all the members saying mean things about me. I went online and read it. Gabriel wrote that I was not smart and my ideas were very old or something like that. I mean, why? Oops. Sorry. Can we start again? No? Okay. So I'm really upset at Gabriel. He's saying mean things about me. My wife will hear about this. My daughters live here. I have grandkids. I feel embarrassed and I'm upset.\" Coughing followed. \"So I get in my car and drive to Gabriel's house to talk to him face to face. He only lives nearby.\" _Cough. Cough._ \"I get to his house and stop at the side of the road. His two cars were in his round driveway so I can't park there. His big garage door is open, and I see he's in the garage hitting little golf balls into a net. I step out of the car and shout his name.\n\nI press some buttons and David's face goes away from the screen, replaced by the pretend picture of the front of the house with the garage. When David talks, a pretend car comes to the front of the house. David's voice goes on. \"I shout, 'Hey Gabriel, I want to chat with you.'\"I shout, 'Hey Gabriel, I want to chat with you.' \"\n\nA pretend man steps out of the car and walks to the garage.\n\n\"Would you look at that,\" a voice said from the group.\n\n\"Unbelievable,\" was heard from another part of the room.\n\nDavid kept talking, and the pretend picture kept up. \"Gabriel sees me coming.\" The pretend man in the garage looking like Gabriel looked up and moved to the back of the garage. Two people walking a dog appeared at the bottom of the screen, and another person walked from the left. \"Gabriel pushes a button to close his garage door.\" David's voice shook, and he made a sound like he was going to be sick. The poor guy was very sick. \"I moved faster,\" David went on. \"I ducked under the door when it was about halfway down.\" On the screen the pretend man had gone into the garage; the door finished closing. The pretend picture stopped. We looked at the front of the house, the cars, and the three people. \"So it's me and Gabriel alone in the playroom.\" The scene changed to inside of the playroom. Gabriel was at the back of the playroom by the exit door, and David was walking toward him. Gabriel is holding a toy stick. \"I shout at Gabriel to put down the toy stick.\" All this action was being shown on the screen in perfect timing with David's words. \"Well, the mean boy comes at me. I grab the stick and hurt my hand on a rough part.\" The cartoon was great. \"We turn around, so we're now in opposite places. He's still holding the stick, and now I'm out of breath and dizzy. I must have been tired already and didn't know it. So I reach for the back door next to me, open it, and take one step into the yard. I tell Gabriel to calm down again but this time Gabriel comes at me with the toy stick held high above his head. I'm shouting, 'Stop, stop, stop,' and he's shouting loud stuff like, 'Go away' and 'Leave me alone.' When he got close to me, I saw him trip, but I wasn't going to wait around to make sure he was okay. I let go of the door and ran fast. All I heard was a big noise when the door closed. The computer showed the door closing and David running to the front.\n\n\"I got in my car and drove away,\" David said. \"I was really scared. I got home, sat in my chair, and tried to tell Charlotte what happened. I had red on my hands from a scratch but I don't know how I got it. The next thing I know the police are at the door.\" The cartoon had stopped with David getting into his car and driving away. Now his picture was back on the screen. \"I don't know what happened after I left that place,\" David said, \"but Ryan was alive and running after me with a golf club the last time I saw him.\" _Cough, cough, cough._ \"And that's what happened.\"\n\nThe screen went dark and Frank came forward again. \"Thanks, Adam.\" He patted me on the shoulder and took the mike. \"So, boys and girls,\" Frank told the audience, \"David, from his sick bed, says he didn't hurt Ryan.\" Frank walked away from the front and moved closer to the audience. \"But there is no denying the fact that a small golf club hit Ryan's head and caused him to pass away. \"Did David hit Adam really hard?\" That was the question.\n\nAll the children were quiet, waiting for an answer. But they got another question instead.\n\n\"Did any boy hit Adam?\" David asked.\n\nThe children started talking all at once.\n\n\"Why would you ask that?\" Samuel asked loudly.\n\n\"Yes, why would you ask that?\" another boy shouted.\n\nMore talking followed with some laughter.\n\n\"Actually,\" David spoke loudly and asked for quiet. \"This is not a silly question.\"\n\nEveryone became quiet.\n\n\"Even a very strong boy,\" David said, \"could not hit so hard with a toy bat that it would really hurt someone's head.\"\n\n\"David is a tall boy,\" Samuel said. \"He was very tall and big.\"\n\nThe talking started again. David was not worried.\n\n\"They were both big boys. But that's not important. I don't care how big David was,\" David said. \"The doctors say that it would need a lot of strength to really hurt someone's head like that. The toy bat would have had to be going very, very fast.\"\n\n\"It's not possible. No one can swing a toy stick that fast,\" Matthew said from the back of the room. \"Not even the best player.\"\n\n\"That is right,\" David agreed. \"The best player can swing the toy stick fast,\" he told the group. \"The best player can swing it very fast.\"\n\n\"Wow,\" someone said.\n\n\"It is wow,\" David agreed. \"But it's not fast enough to hurt someone badly. And the best player was timed using a normal swing with a long stick. Gabriel was hurt from a fast chop of a short stick.\"\n\n\"So who hurt Gabriel?\" a man asked. \"A magic being?\"\n\nThat made a few people laugh.\n\n\"Yes,\" David said. \"Gabriel was hurt by a magic being.\"\n\nThere were many people who didn't believe this.\n\n\"This is silly!\"\n\n\"Are you silly?\"\n\n\"This is not right.\"\n\n\"Let me finish, please,\" David asked for quiet.\n\nThe noise stopped when the back of Gabriel's house appeared on the picture. David had a light pointer. \"This is Gabriel's yard in back of the house.\" The red light line traced the area. \"As you can see, there is a small gap between the two houses.\" David said. \"This makes a path for the wind so that even on a calm day there's a wind from the lake that moves faster through this small area. The night Gabriel left, it was very windy. The wind came off the lake and into this wind path, the speed would be much faster.\" David pointed to a smaller area where the back door to the garage was. \"Dominick says he was standing by this door the last time he saw Gabriel.\" The picture showed a shape at the open door. \"This door to the garage was heavy. I checked this myself. Now, according to Dominick, a strong wind made the door close fast, Dom ran, and he heard the door close loudly.\" The picture showed this. \"So what happened after that door closed?\" David asked. He pressed some buttons on the computer, and the picture of inside the garage showed up again. There was a shape of a man holding a stick in front of him at eye level. The shape was moving toward the open door where the Dominick shape stood. The Gabriel shape fell forward, head first. The Dom game runs away. The door closes quickly on the bottom of the golf stick, pushing the top of the stick into the top of Gabriel's head. The strong push from the door made the top of the stick go into Gabriel's head. Gabriel's head and body were thrown backward. He fell on the garage floor about five steps from where he was hit. Gabriel's body didn't move on the floor with the golf stick stuck in his head.\n\n\"Based on simple rules, the fast wind closed the heavy door with a big push. That big push is more than enough to hurt Gabriel's head, go into his brain, and throw his body five steps to where he was found.\" David stopped and took a deep breath. \"Boys and girls,\" he said, \"based on these things, we say there was no bad thing the night Gabriel was hurt. There was a bad accident. A thing that just happened.\" David turned from the people and gave me the microphone.\n\nThe lights turned on. The room was very quiet. I started talking before anyone in the room could. \"Right now there is only one thing you should be asking yourself,\" I told them. \"And that thing is, 'Could this have happened?' Could Ryan have been hurt by a strange mishap caused by strong winds, a big door, a play stick, and being in the wrong spot at the wrong time? It surely could have happened like that. Does anyone here remember how Thomas, the cowboy movie star passed away?\"\n\n\"A car mishap,\" someone said.\n\n\"Actually he passed away while avoiding a car mishap,\" I said. \"He changed direction to avoid a broken bridge, and a bag in the back of his car moved forward, hit him on the back of the head, and he passed away. It was just bad luck, like getting hit by a flash of light from the sky or a falling thing or a flying machine landing on a road or a stray play ball or getting caught by a tie caught in a moving garage door. All these things have occurred. So, could Ryan have been hurt by a big door closing and pushing a play stick into his head? Of course it could have happened that way. And that makes us question if David really hurt Ryan. A question is all it takes to believe a person didn't do it.\"\n\n\"Are we just supposed to agree to this?\" a voice asked.\n\n\"You can think whatever you want,\" I replied. \"But wait. Is there a law person here?\"\n\nMaybe fifty hands raised.\n\n\"I should have known,\" I said in a funny way. \"Alright, helpers, if you think we've made it clear that David didn't hurt Ryan, please lower your hand.\" There was no hand left up. \"We're done,\" I said. I put the talking stick down and walked away from the stand.\n\nBefore I could leave, I was stopped by a man who used to be a helper and who was always bothering me, Samuel.\n\n\"Emma, a moment, please.\" Samuel touched my arm to stop me.\n\n\"Samuel, I saw you lower your hand,\" I told him in a friendly way. \"No more questions.\"\n\nCharlotte came up to me on the other side of Samuel. \"Thank you, Emma,\" she said.\n\nI moved away from Samuel, who, to his credit, didn't complain. I gave Charlotte a hug, and then I was hugging her daughters, Alice and Diana, who were also thanking me. \"We did the best we could,\" I said.\n\n\"You did great, Emma,\" Charlotte said for all of them. \"Maybe now David can rest.\"\n\nI was feeling happy until I saw David walk straight to Charlotte. I held my breath.\n\n\"I'm sorry about how I acted before,\" he said honestly to Charlotte. \"And I'm sorry for your loss.\"\n\nI let out a big breath.\n\n\"I'm sorry about your dad,\" Alice said kindly.\n\nDavid nodded to Benjamin's sisters, who nodded back. He looked at me. \"Good show, Ethan,\" he said, and high-fived me.\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\n\"Ethan,\" a voice said quickly.\n\n\"Are you still here, Sam?\" I turned to the old man. \"I'm a bit busy now.\"\n\n\"It's okay, Ethan.\" Alice gave me another hug. \"We're going home. I'm tired. This has been hard for us. Thank you again.\"\n\nWhen the family left, a few people came near me. I felt like I was being boxed in, and I didn't like it. \"I told you I'm not going to talk about the show,\" I said to Sam.\n\n\"I don't want to talk about the show,\" Sam surprised me. \"You got my vote for being unsure, like you said. I want to talk about something else.\"\n\n\"Okay, Sam,\" I said. \"What do you want to talk about?\"\n\n\"I want to talk about AA.\"\n\n## Next Part\n\nAA'S JOURNEY\n\n\"What do you want to know about AA, Sam?\" I asked the old man.\n\n\"Are they as bad as Jack says?\" Samuel asked.\n\n\"They're pretty bad,\" I told him.\n\nJack had written stories about a mean group in the town news, and he didn't tell a nice story.\n\n\"We don't know as much about this mean group as we do about the other one,\" I said to the friends. \"We know that the other group isn't as strong as it was a long time ago, but they can still be dangerous.\"\n\nJack wrote that the other group was started a long time ago by a man named William and was originally called a different name. The group believed that their country would be the last place where a big fight would happen.\n\nAfter William left, a man named Ryan became the leader and changed the group's name. Ryan made friends with other mean groups. Ryan also started a big meeting in the early eighties. Sadly for the group, a confused man named Ryan broke away from the group and started a new group called the Team. They did some bad things a long time ago. Later, Ryan had a fight with some officers, and some of his friends went to a place where they can learn their mistakes. The Group was not working well. A long time ago, a lady and her little boy were hurt by some members of the Group. This made the Group lose a lot of money and their home in HL place. They moved to PA place but they were not together anymore. Some members from the south made a new group, called AA and moved to TJ place, SC place. They were hurt but they could still be mean if someone made them angry, and I guess NE place made them angry. First, a little man from SF place (that's me) caught one of their members. Then, two ladies said he hurt them. If that wasn't bad enough, a man was going to take their friend to court and a man had asked for a lot of money for bail. AA was angry and they were going to come back.\n\nAdam's stories in the _NE News_ were making people angry.\n\nThe AD Group said it wasn't fair.\n\nThe UJ Group wanted to talk about it.\n\nThe JF Group made it a big problem.\n\nThe JD Group was protective.\n\nJFJ were confused.\n\nThe problem was on the news everywhere. In front of a courthouse in SC place, Adam, a mechanic from TA place, spoke for another small group, the noisy SB. \"We need to keep our friends safe and think about the kids' future,\" Benjamin said, using David's words. Then he took off his sports hat and held it over his heart. \"I hope our country is always safe,\" he said to the camera.\n\nIt was said that a lot of people who didn't like anyone different would gather in front of the PB courthouse in a few days, shouting for the judge to free Randolph.\n\n\"Can we stop them from coming here?\" Samuel asked.\n\n\"Some of them are already here from what I heard,\" I told them. \"They were seen in the town.\"\n\n\"How do we know for sure it was the bad guys?\" Samuel asked.\n\n\"People with shaved heads in a very old car with a flag from a long time ago tend to stand out.\"\n\n\"Can we stop them from marching?\"\n\n\"We could stop them,\" I said.\n\n\"Without hurting them\"--Samuel looked at me uncertainly--\"what can we do? Who knows what can happen?\"\n\n\"It can lead to a lot of trouble,\" I said simply. \"That's what the bad guys want. They want to have their own place without us in it.\"\n\nA worried-looking old woman asked, \"Is all this happening just because of the attack on those two women?\" She sounded as if the bad thing had nothing to do with us.\n\n\"No, it's not just because two ladies were hurt,\" I said. \"It's because a mean group has one of their people who has to protect himself against just about everyone they don't like. People with black skin and authority aren't exactly what the mean group wants.\"\n\n\"The judge should have not been there,\" Sam said.\n\n\"The judge said he could be really fair about the case no matter his beliefs,\" I said.\n\n\"What about you, Ethan?\" another boy spoke up. \"Without you there's no case.\"\n\n\"That's probably true,\" I agreed. \"Are you saying I don't share?\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" the boy replied. \"It would make things easier if we just made these mean guys happy, so they'll go away.\"\n\n\"You can't make these people happy,\" I said. \"They're very mean. They think a very bad man was right.\"\n\n\"I heard that a good group is sending a helper,\" someone said hopefully.\n\n\"The good group won't stop the mean group,\" I said. \"Maybe a different good group could slow them down but not the first one.\"\n\n\"The other group is too rough,\" one of the kids protested.\n\n\"With the mean group you can't be too rough. Being rough is all they understand and respect,\" I explained. \"I know them. I've dealt with them before.\"\n\n\"Ethan,\" Samuel said. \"This isn't BE city in the old times or GE country in the long ago.\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter,\" I said. \"The rules are basically the same.\"\n\n\"We have rules to protect us,\" someone added.\n\n\"Yeah, and it was the rule that allowed the bad guys to walk in the streets of PA city and tell the world about a made-up story. I think it's going to be very ugly.\"\n\n\"Oh I don't think it will be so bad,\" a grandma with lots of makeup said with a wave of her hand. \"I heard they're bringing two girl singers with them to sing during the event. How bad could it be if they're planning on entertaining people with girl singers?\"\n\nI laughed. \"Those cute, blond girl singers would be Lily and Lauren,\" I said. \"They're sisters who sing under a different name.\"\n\n\"That's right. Are they any good?\"\n\n\"They've been on TV,\" I said.\n\n\"Really? What do they sing?\"\n\n\"Songs that are not nice. Not nice to people of different races and religions.\"\n\n\"Seriously?\"\n\n\"Seriously,\" I said. \"One of them wears the number eighty-eight on her clothes.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"She's copying some other girl singers. H is the eighth letter in the alphabet. Double eight is for two H's,\" I explained. \"They're very creative kids.\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" one woman said, holding a hand to her neck. \"This is a bad dream.\"\n\n\"Now you're understanding,\" I told her.\n\n\"I don't want these people in my backyard,\" Sam spoke again. \"I don't want to hear them, and I don't want to see them. What can we do?\"\n\n\"You could go on a trip,\" I said jokingly, remembering my dream about everyone going on a trip while some people attacked the town.\n\nWhen I heard, \"Hey, that's not a bad idea,\" from someone in the crowd I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.\n\n\"What do you think it would cost?\" another member asked.\n\n\"We can look into it as a group and maybe get a good rate.\"\n\n\"We could make this a town event,\" one woman said. She sounded excited about the idea. \"We could make it a theme trip. We could have a costume party.\"\n\nI just shook my head.\n\n\"Ethan\"--Sam looked at me seriously--\"how long do you think these groups will be in PB county?\" All eyes were on me, waiting to know how long our boat trip should be.\n\n\"They'll stay until they get what they want,\" I told them.\n\n\"What do they want?\" a friend asked.\n\n\"Most importantly,\" I said, \"they want us to go away.\"\n\n\"That doesn't help,\" I heard.\n\n\"It's all I know,\" I said.\n\n\"I heard that the leader of the AA group will be in BE town soon,\" a friend said, scared.\n\n\"Yes, Henry David,\" I replied. \"I think he's here now.\"\n\n\"Can you talk to him? Try to make him understand.\"\n\n\"My grandpa told me that you can't reason with a big animal,\" I said.\n\n\"The man is not a big animal,\" Samuel said.\n\n\"Close enough.\"\n\n\"You could tell him something,\" Samuel said.\n\n\"Yes. I could tell him to leave,\" I said.\n\n\"Do you think he'd listen to you?\"\n\n\"Only if I told him I'd scare him away.\"\n\nThe ride from the clubhouse to my home was full of car lights. I remembered reading that humans are the only ones who can think about their own life. So, I wondered, \"When there are big bullies threatening to blow the house down, can smart people really think it's a good time to plan a dress-up party?\" What were they thinking?\n\n_\" There are people at the gate.\"_\n\n_\" Tell them to leave.\"_\n\n_\" There are people causing trouble at the gate.\"_\n\n_\" Tell them to be quiet.\"_\n\n_\" There are people breaking the gate.\"_\n\n_\" Call the caretaker.\"_\n\n_\" The people have broken the gate.\"_\n\n_\" Another big trouble.\"_\n\n_\" There are people knocking on our house door.\"_\n\n_\" Maybe they'll leave.\"_\n\n_\" There are people breaking our door.\"_\n\n_\" Pack our clothes.\"_\n\n_\" There are people taking all our things.\"_\n\n_\" Who knew?\"_\n\nMy grandfather, Gabriel, knew there was always someone trying to take someone else's stuff. There was always dislike, and some people had it in large amounts. The people in BE town only disliked waiting in line, small food amounts, bad seats at the restaurant, and not good service. The nice people of BE town could only argue with their children and with each other. They were not strong enough for those who had a lot of dislike.\n\nWho would protect the gates of BE town, BW town, BT town, BG town, BV town, BWoods town, BG town, BL town, BM town, BC town, BH town, BF town, BIS town, BIS town, BP town, BCC town, D town, B town, S town, SA town, the C town, LJ town, W town, the WHC town, the O town, the S town, MCC town, and PV town? Who was brave? Who was not scared? Who wanted to be free like the people living in NE city? Who would stand up for those who could not defend themselves?\n\n\"I'll do it,\" I said as I left my car. \"I'll help everyone.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Ethan,\" said a old woman named Emma. She gave me two heavy bags from the grocery store.\n\nThat night, I thought about a big ship trip before I went to sleep. Early in the morning, my phone rang. I never got a good phone call at this time, and this call was not good either.\n\n\"Ethan, did I wake you?\" A man named Frank sounded worried.\n\n\"No, Frank,\" I mumbled. \"I was just sitting here waiting for your call.\"\n\n\"Sorry to bother you but--\"\n\n\"You have some bad news,\" I said as I sat up and turned on the lamp next to my bed.\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" Frank said. \"A special part of the park was ruined tonight. I heard it's really bad.\"\n\n\"Let me guess,\" I said, rubbing my eyes. \"Someone did something very bad there.\"\n\n\"Yes, and more,\" Frank said. \"The news is out already. I thought I'd tell you myself.\"\n\n\"They are so quick, aren't they? Can I do anything now?\"\n\n\"Not really,\" he said. \"We're making the place safe and leaving a guard. You can visit in the morning.\"\n\n\"But it is morning,\" I said.\n\n\"It's more like the middle of the night,\" Adam remarked. \"I'm sorry, Ethan.\"\n\n\"I know you are, Adam,\" I said, and put down the phone.\n\nA big army had started a fight with BR city and the attack had started.\n\nI was at the park at nine the next morning. Charlotte and Quinn were already there. The police had marked the area as a crime scene and one officer was still there.\n\n\"Why are you two here?\" I asked Charlotte.\n\n\"Bad news spreads quickly,\" Charlotte said. \"We got a call this morning from people we know who work here. We wanted to see it ourselves,\" Charlotte said.\n\n\"I'm happy you're here,\" I said, giving her a small kiss on the cheek.\n\n\"What about me, Ethan?\" Quinn said.\n\n\"I'm happy you're here, too, Quinn,\" I said, and gave her a small kiss as well.\n\nI saw Jack, one of the people who run the park, who had shown me around the park during my first visit to BR city a while ago. Jack was a kind boy who wished to change how others saw the end of life. He thought Memories should be a joyful event of life not a place for the end. Sadly, there was no joy that morning.\n\nSome very bad symbols were drawn on the walls of the big tomb that held many people's remains already. \"BAD THINGS TO PEOPLE\" was written in black over a special symbol at the entrance. Mean words were written clearly on all four walls. Across the street that split the park was another tomb for different people, clean and noticeable by its untouched walls. The message was bad.\n\nSome family tombs had been ruined and painted. Glass was shattered. Doors were broken. Paint was everywhere. Jack had tears in his eyes.\n\n\"Look what these mean people did, Ethan,\" he said. \"They wreck all that's good. Will it ever end?\"\n\n\"No, it has to be stopped.\"\n\nWhile we looked at the damage, a line of cars started arriving. Soon there were at least fifty people walking quietly around the place. Even with the growing crowd, Memories stayed as quiet as a graveyard. It was the sound of a town in sorrow.\n\nI looked at the bad symbols and mean words on the walls and remembered when I sprayed paint on someone's house. The two actions were alike but the reasons were not the same. I was sending the Benjamin's a message that night. I was telling them there was someone out there in the dark of SF country who was as scary as they were and not scared to play without rules. I was sending a one-time message right to them that their bad behavior would be met with bad behavior. I thought that \"_Be nice or get ready for a fight_\" was a fair warning that gave room for choices.\n\nThe message these wild animals left at the park was different. Their message was, _\" We don't like you because of who you are and we don't care about your life or your death.\"_\n\nI saw three black squirrels running around the mess. They jumped, ran, stopped and started, moved quickly, rushed, climbed, ran fast, and moved around. They never seemed happy with where they were or where they were going. I remember thinking that people who hate all the time must have squirrels running around in their heads. What else could explain how they act?\n\nThe policeman who was working left after telling Jack the help would be there soon. The park was left to the sad people. I was looking at some big, deep footprints when Jack Liam touched my shoulder. \"Will you look at this,\" he said, shaking his head. \"What are those?\"\n\nI turned to see a group version of _a famous story about a girl and three bears_ coming closer. It seemed the nice-looking members of the group who keep clean weren't here today. _Hi, red marks,_ I thought as I watched four scary characters come near. If I were a black cat I would have made a scary pose.\n\nThe bears were _very big,_ a strange mix of muscles, size, fat, and showing off. They had big bald heads, big tattooed arms, and round, big bellies showing that scaring people was their best way of doing things. The three bears looked dirty. The girl looked awful. Her blond, messy hair was from a hair dye bottle. Her tired face and watery eyes were from a bottle of strong drink. Her thin, tattooed arms looked bad. Her thin face tried to say that she wasn't as old as she looked but her wrinkles from smoking showed her real age didn't matter. When you look bad, age doesn't matter. The girl was not nice and the bears were her helpers.\n\n\"What are they doing here?\" Adam asked me.\n\n\"Showing off,\" I told him.\n\n\"Do you think they're the ones who made this place messy?\" he asked me.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said to Adam. \"But they're thinking we can't prove it. \"They're here to scare us.\"\n\n\"It's working.\" Jack pointed at the sad people. They looked scared but instead of being still from bright lights they were scared by the coming night.\n\nI watched the mean group walk toward the place where something bad happened and I could feel the fear from the crowd at the place. To his credit, Jack did not seem scared.\n\n\"I'm Jack, the boss here,\" he said to them in a clear voice. \"Can I help you?\"\n\n\"Looks like you're the one who needs help,\" Goldie said as she lit a smoke with a silver lighter. She closed the lighter by hitting it against her leg and put it in the front pocket of her jeans.\n\nEvery move and every word was planned to make the most scary first impression possible. I wasn't impressed. Bragging is the first sign of nonsense.\n\n\"Yeah, looks like you had some trouble here,\" one of the bears said. \"Now who would do such a bad thing to a nice place?\" His hint was clear and meant to scare. The crowd was quietly scared.\n\n\"Yeah, what a shame,\" another bear said. \"Who would do such a terrible thing to nice place?\"\n\n\"You would, Yogi,\" I said, stepping forward and stopping their walk.\n\n\"What might you be?\" asked Grace, blowing bubbles in my direction and looking at me up and down.\n\n\"I might be scared of you, but I'm not,\" I replied to the scary lady.\n\n\"How about I scold you?\" the biggest bear said, stepping forward.\n\n\"With your red boots,\" I said, pointing at his boots with the painted fire.\n\n\"That's right,\" he said, grinning. \"They'd leave a good mark.\"\n\n\"Like the marks you left here last night,\" I said. \"I'd say they're big, tailor-made. I'd also say you're very heavy based on the deep footprints.\"\n\nThe four of them blinked together.\n\n\"Your friends over there left some big sneaker prints, too,\" I added. \"And I'm sure I'll find small boot prints made by your mother.\"\n\n\"Go away,\" she said to me.\n\n\"Thanks for the suggestion,\" I said. \"But I'll decline.\"\n\n\"You can't prove those are our footprints.\" The bear in boots put his hands on his waist and stood tall.\n\n\"You're mistaking me for a police officer,\" I said. \"I don't need to show anything. I know you did it and I will make sure you never do it again.\"\n\n\"What do you think you are?\" The blonde girl seemed to only know a few words.\n\n\"Ethan,\" I said, looking at her and clenching my hands.\n\nI saw understanding in her eyes. The three friends looked at each other.\n\n\"The Brave Boy,\" she laughed. \"You?\"\n\n\"Just me,\" I said.\n\n\"We've wanted to meet you.\" She smiled nastily and the four of them started to move away from each other. They were used to fighting and would try to get me from four different directions. I knew I could handle two of them but all four would be too much. I chose the girl first. She would be the easiest. Then I'd go for the biggest friend. I stood still wondering why I wasn't scared at all and why everyone else nearby was. I took a big breath and waited.\n\nCharlotte stood in front of me, looked me in the eyes, and winked. Then she turned to face the blonde girl. \"You have to get past me to get to him,\" she said.\n\nThe mean woman snorted a laugh. \"You joking?\" \"What are you, white or different?\" someone asked.\n\n\"I don't care what I am as long as I'm not you, you mean person.\"\n\nCharlotte surprised me. I knew she was strong but I had never seen her being brave outside of our home. I was surprised but I was still worried.\n\nJack suddenly stood in front of me and stood next to Charlotte. \"You'll have to go through me, too,\" Jack said.\n\nAlice and the three animals were confused. This was turning into a problem. They still looked like they could win but the mood had changed. Someone else moved in front of me. It was Samuel, the older man from BH town. He didn't say a word. He just took his place next to Jack. A frail old woman helped by her husband moved next to Samuel. People began moving silently in front of me, one after the other, until I was behind a group of people. No one was talking. No one was being mean. It was completely quiet. I was surprised.\n\n\"What is this,\" Alice asked again, \"a march of the quiet people?\"\n\nNo one answered her. The police car arrived at the parking lot, breaking the quiet.\n\n\"Okay, Adam Knight,\" Grace said, signaling to her helpers, \"we'll sort this out another time.\"\n\nAfter they left, my friends turned to me. I saw relief, fear, and pride on their faces.\n\nI noticed Samuel, the lawyer. \"Samuel,\" I said, \"I didn't know you were so brave.\"\n\n\"I'm not brave anymore,\" Samuel said. \"I'm scared.\"\n\nEveryone laughed to feel better after being so scared.\n\n\"Does anyone have any more questions about the big group?\" I asked them.\n\nNobody said anything.\n\n## CHAPTER 28\n\nADAM'S ADVENTURE\n\nBuses and cars carrying members of the big group started to arrive in the FL country on the Monday before the Wednesday meetings. The group had rented a big field near YE town, a short drive away from the big road, about an hour north of PE city. Members of the group set up tents and started to have fun. Bonfires were lit, music played, and a couple of things were burning. The Clan was with the big group.\n\nThe local police had a lot of officers watching the fun, but there was no one to arrest. It was like a school cheerleading event the night before a big match. There was a big fire. People were happy for silly talks. Lily and Loren Grace sang mean songs to a loving crowd (\"Wow, aren't they cute.\").\n\nHenry, leader of the AA team, appeared on the TV on a weekday night. He talked with a nice lady reporter in front of a loud group of supporters. The pretty reporter had to talk loud into her small mic to be heard. \"I'm here with Henry, the leader of the AA team. Mr. Henry, you seem to have many people here for your cause.\" She held the mic toward Henry.\n\n\"More people will come,\" Henry replied happily. \"You're seeing how things work and the unity of the big group.\"\n\nI saw the Henry talk alone in my home. I didn't want to be with others for fear of a bad thing happening. Henry was a short man with a thin face. He had a small mustache and his thin hair was neat. I noticed his teeth were not straight when he smiled. Henry looked like a small animal.\n\nA chant of \"free Robert, free Robert\" started behind Henry and the reporter. Henry's smile got bigger and he raised a fist to say thank you for the chant. \"That's why we are here,\" he yelled to his friends.\n\n\"Mr. David, how many people are here tonight?\" she asked.\n\n\"Many,\" David guessed a number that no one could be sure of by looking at the picture on the TV. \"Maybe even more,\" he said with confidence. \"People are here looking for fairness,\" he continued. Everyone cheered.\n\n\"What do you hope to achieve here?\" she asked.\n\n\"We want to help Ryan get out and find a place where he can be judged fairly,\" David said. Everyone cheered. I saw some boys in the back cheering.\n\n\"And where do you think Ryan would be judged fairly?\" she asked.\n\n\"Almost anywhere but here,\" David laughed.\n\n\"And why do you think so, Mr. David?\"\n\n\"Many reasons, dear,\" David said, making a fist with his right hand. \"First of all\"--he touched the little finger of his right hand with the index finger of his left hand--\"the case against Ryan is all talk. You understand talk, girl?\"\n\n\"Yes, I understand what you mean, Mr. David,\" she replied patiently.\n\n\"Well, we got a whole lot of talk from a bunch of people.\"\n\nThe crowd roared with happiness again, and I heard the familiar cheer, \"That's what we like to hear!\"\n\n\"I hear you friend,\" David shouted, looking over his shoulder again at the group. He turned back to the camera and resumed counting on his fingers. \"The guy who stopped Randolph is a person with a history of not being nice. He made two of those boys go to the hospital.\" A second finger went up. \"The women who say they were hurt were not white.\" Three fingers up. \"The judge is the same as the first guy.\" The fourth finger was raised. \"And the person in charge is the same as well.\" His thumb went last. \"This seems fishy.\"\n\n\"The man who stopped everything is a brave, retired police officer,\" the news reporter reminded him.\n\n\"You mean the Brave Knight?\" David laughed, using the name Jerry had given me. \"Yeah, I read that silly story by that writer about that police officer. Comparing a person to a knight is not nice. Real knights were brave helpers.\"\n\n\"Isn't that just talk?\" the reporter asked David.\n\n\"That's true.\" David looked questioningly at the reporter. \"And I'll tell you something else, little girl. If I were that pretend knight, Ethan, I'd be careful right now.\"\n\n\"Are you warning Ethan, Mr. David?\" The news teller asked his statement.\n\n\"I'm not warning anyone,\" David replied quickly. \"But there are a lot of friends here who might be less patient than me.\"\n\n\"Are you saying that friends might try to trouble Ethan?\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about that, sweetie,\" David chuckled. \"But think about it. He's the only helper those ladies have. He's all alone. He got no team. No backup. If something were to happen to him ...\" David let his voice fade away.\n\n\"There are a lot of people in this place who believe Ethan is a hero for helping those women and for standing up to the mean group, despite all the push from your group,\" the news teller said. \"Maybe some of those people will back him up.\"\n\n\"Who? The others? The friends? The rich in PE town?\" David's laugh was dismissive. \"The friends won't do anything to shake their situation. They're too comfortable and happy. People will hide like they always do. Those people from faraway places are too silly and lazy to organize. The rich in PB city? Don't make me laugh. They'll just get on their private jets and leave town when we march. Sir Ethan the BK Knight is going to stand alone, sweetheart.\"\n\n\"Then how do you explain the event at a BR city park the other day when fifty people rallied to support Ethan at the recently disturbed park?\"\n\n\"That was no event,\" David scoffed. \"Four of our people went to see the mess that had been reported on the news and about forty people and Mr. BK Knight drove them off. My people weren't looking for any trouble.\"\n\n\"That's not the story I heard,\" the reporter said.\n\n\"Depends on who you talk to, little girl.\" David smiled. \"Anyway, AA group is now prepared to march and face any trouble that comes our way. Ain't no one gonna stand up to us. Ethan is on his own.\"\n\n\"He doesn't seem concerned,\" the reporter said. \"Can I ask you one more question, Mr. David?\"\n\n\"Sure, honey.\" David was feeling good about his presentation. \"Ask away.\"\n\n\"Why did the Bella family move from a community in SC state to a community in BR city? There are more people in PA county than anywhere else, except NE city and IS country.\"\n\nAdam blinked.\n\n\"And there are more black people in DE city than anywhere outside of PO city, HA city,\" the person kept talking. \"Why did the B family choose to settle here?\" Adam didn't know how to answer.\n\n\"Well, I .. . .\" he tried.\n\n\"Isn't it true that AA believes that white people cannot live peacefully with other people?\" the person interrupted. \"It's in your book. Why would the B family move here?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Adam spoke softly. \"You'd have to ask them.\"\n\n\"You don't know?\" She turned to the machine. \"Well I don't, either. But didn't AQ set up groups in AM city before they did something bad? In our peaceful society it's easy to blend in and do something bad from within. Is it possible that AA has learned from AQ and moved members into the enemy area?\"\n\n\"Wait a moment,\" Henry Adam shouted from off-machine. \"Who said anything about bad people?\"\n\n\"Of course, this is just something people say.\" The person smiled.\n\n\"Hold on there, girl!\" Adam remained off-machine.\n\n\"This is Madison,\" she interrupted him, \"talking live from YE town, Florida, with Henry Adam, president of AA.\" I could feel my head hurt, and blood came out. I went down on my knees then fell forward on my face. Without thinking, I moved away from where the hurt came from and tried to see clearly. I saw a boot with scary pictures on it coming towards my face. I turned my head as the boot hit my mouth. This movement probably saved my teeth. My lips hurt, and there was blood in my nose and eyes.\n\n\"Hey, Big Knight,\" a voice I knew said. \"Henry told you to be careful.\" He kicked my stomach. I curled up, covering my head with my arms. More kicks came from boots and shoes and it was clear that these guys weren't there to warn me; they were there to hurt me.\n\n\"Lift him up,\" a second voice said in a rush, \"and put him in the car.\" I knew right away that they wanted to take me to a scary place where something bad was going to happen at a big gathering. They were laughing and talking to each other as they hurt me, and I remembered my grandpa's advice about surprise and pride.\n\nI was pulled from my curled up position to my hands and knees. I saw three pairs of legs around me. I knew exactly where the small knife was in my waistband. Now it was my turn to laugh and I did.\n\n\"Why are you laughing?\" one of them grumbled.\n\nAnother hit to my tummy made me groan and take in a breath. I put my right hand on my tummy and held the handle of a sharp toy. I took the toy from my belt. \"Surprise, you mean guys.\"\n\nWith a small movement, the sharp toy moved across the closest foot I could find in a sneaker. The loudest yell I ever heard filled the night air and a second scary yell followed as I stopped the next guy at the top of his sneaker. Both hurt friends were on the ground in pain. I was still on my hands and knees. The third mean guy, the one in the Fearless Flames, couldn't see what I had done to his friends, but he knew it wasn't good.\n\n\"Not nice!\" he said as he jumped away from me.\n\nI rolled away from him and tried to stand up. I lost my balance immediately. I moved backward, falling over small bushes. I landed on my back and rolled down a slope. \"Get up, Ethan,\" my mind told me, but my body wouldn't listen.\n\nThe two hurt friends were still yelling. I heard a car engine start.\n\n\"No, no, don't move me,\" someone yelled.\n\n\"Somebody needs to help,\" a friend said.\n\nA vehicle door made a loud noise.\n\n\"Oh no,\" another friend cried a bit later.\n\n\"I need to move you.\"\n\nThen another vehicle door made a noise, the car started, made a loud noise, and they left.\n\nI moved out from the bushes and into the place where cars are parked. I held on to a vehicle door and stood up leaning against the car. I checked the things I had.\n\nAll my teeth were there.\n\nI had a head hurt.\n\nI had a headache.\n\nI could not see clearly.\n\nMy lips were hurt and bleeding.\n\nMy nose was hurt, again.\n\nAt least two of my side bones were hurt.\n\nMy hands and knees were not hurting, which I thought was strange.\n\nI needed some help.\n\n\"Help,\" I called softly to someone passing by.\n\n\"Thank you, Ethan,\" my friend, Emma said, and she gave me two bags of groceries from the store.\n\n\"Call the people who keep us safe,\" I told her.\n\n\"Don't be silly,\" she laughed. \"You can carry those little bags yourself.\"\n\nAt the place where sick people go, the doctor told me two of my side bones were hurt, I had a head hurt, and my nose was hurt. I fell asleep.\n\nThe next morning my room was filled with people who keep us safe, and the people who take care of the sick were getting worried. Chief Police Officer Frank arrived and started to take charge. He cleared the room and put guards at the door, telling them not to let anyone in without his say-so.\n\n\"Do you know who hurt you?\" Frank asked, looking at me.\n\nI nodded my head.\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Mrs. S.\"\n\n\"Frank, please,\" Frank said in a hurry.\n\n\"I didn't see anything,\" I told him. \"I was hit from the back. All I saw were shoes and legs.\"\n\nFrank showed me a clear bag with the messy knife. \"What's this?\" he asked.\n\n\"My letter opener,\" I told him.\n\n\"We found it in the bushes near where you fell. You must have dropped it.\"\n\n\"Did I drop the shopping bags, too?\" I asked.\n\n\"The eggs broke,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh no.\"\n\n\"It's a big letter opener,\" Frank noted.\n\n\"Actually it's a RU country sword. My grandfather killed a bear with it.\"\n\n\"Who did you hurt with it?\"\n\n\"No one,\" I said. \"But two guys won't be running the big race this year. While they were hurting me, I cut their leg cords.\"\n\nFrank made a face at the thought. \"Why were you carrying the knife?\"\n\n\"Would you believe it was just by chance?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Yes, it was,\" I said seriously.\n\n\"Do you think these guys were from Apple group?\"\n\n\"More like Jelly group,\" I said. \"I didn't give a pledge this year.\"\n\n\"Adam, give me a serious answer, will you?\"\n\n\"If you want a serious answer, ask a serious question. Of course, they were from Apple group. They even mentioned David's name. They were the same jokers that visited the park minus their friend.\"\n\n\"I wonder why she wasn't there,\" Frank thought out loud.\n\n\"Exercise class,\" I said.\n\nFrank laughed. \"We'll send some people to their gathering right away and see if we can find two guys with a limp.\"\n\n\"Don't bother,\" I told him. \"They're long gone by now. David wouldn't keep them around.\"\n\nA uniformed guard walked into the room and whispered something to Frank.\n\n\"Do you want to talk to a reporter from CM network named Miriam?\" Frank asked. \"She's outside the door.\"\n\nI thought about her great chat with David. \"Yes, I'll talk to her,\" I decided.\n\n\"Are you sure you're up to it?\" Frank asked.\n\n\"I'll be fine,\" I assured him, although my head was hurting me.\n\nMiriam was tall, pretty, and very professional-looking in a dark business suit. She held my hand tightly.\n\n\"Sir Ethan.\" She smiled warmly.\n\n\"Princess Madison.\" I smiled back. \"Say hi to King Frank, a good friend of mine.\"\n\nThey said hi to each other.\n\n\"I liked your talk with Mr. Henry,\" I told her.\n\n\"That man is not nice,\" she said. \"I had to say something to him.\"\n\n\"That was a big word, not just something. Do you think there's a secret plan?\" I asked her.\n\n\"Why not?\" she replied. \"Why else would those bad guys come here?\"\n\n\"You have a point,\" I said, feeling a sharp pain in my side.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" she asked nicely.\n\n\"I've felt better,\" I said.\n\n\"Do you feel like talking to me?\" she asked.\n\n\"Not really,\" I said, waving my hand.\n\n\"Come on, Sir Ethan,\" Madison pushed me. \"Tell people how you feel.\"\n\n\"I feel bad.\"\n\n\"And you look bad.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" I laughed, even though my side hurt. \"And you want me to go on TV looking bad.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said seriously. \"I want people to see what those bad guys did to you.\"\n\n\"I'm okay,\" I said. \"I've been hurt before.\"\n\n\"That's not what's important, Ethan,\" she said. \"If you want to stand up against the Bad Group, you have to let people know what they do.\"\n\n\"Alright, let's do it,\" I chose quickly. She had said the right thing.\n\n_Do what?_ Mr. Jack lifted his head a bit. I couldn't believe he was even listening.\n\nMadison had a team with a camera waiting outside, and it took about some time to get their stuff ready for a live talk in my room. Madison started the talk with a look at my past. She explained the Bad Group-Henry-David situation quickly and reminded the viewers about her talk with David from the night before. She talked about the fight at the ruined place. Then she told everyone about the hurts I got, making it sound like I was lucky to be here. Maybe I was lucky.\n\nWhen she had finished talking, she looked at me. \"So, Ethan,\" she said, her voice kind, \"how do you feel?\"\n\n\"How do I look?\"\n\n\"Not good.\"\n\n\"That's how I feel.\"\n\n\"Do you know who hurt you?\" she asked, already knowing the answer.\n\nThe camera guy was getting a close look at my hurt face.\n\n\"No, I didn't see,\" I said. \"They surprised me. I didn't see anyone's face.\"\n\n\"Do you know who it might have been?\" she asked.\n\n\"If I had to guess, I'd say it was the three silly boys from the AR group who were at the park the other day with the mean lady from the north,\" I told her.\n\n\"Why do you think so?\"\n\n\"If you saw her, you'd understand,\" I said.\n\n\"No, I mean why do you think it was the same three boys?\"\n\n\"One of them was wearing a pair of bright boots and the other two were wearing shoes,\" I told her. \"Just like the three silly boys at the park. Then, one of them told me I should have been careful,\" I said. \"And that was what your friend Henry told me to do, if you remember.\"\n\n\"I remember.\" She nodded. \"But Henry is not my friend.\"\n\n\"He would be the first to say that,\" I agreed.\n\n\"Tell us what happened,\" she asked me to tell my story.\n\nI told her about the surprise, the sharp toy, and the hurt legs.\n\n\"That sounds awful,\" she said.\n\n\"It would have been worse if I'd let them keep hurting me,\" I told her.\n\n\"Will they be able to move again?\" she wanted to know.\n\n\"I don't know and I don't care,\" I said honestly. \"I do know they won't be hurting anyone with their feet anytime soon.\"\n\n\"And what about your hurts?\" she asked. \"How long do you think your condition will delay the David hearings?\"\n\n\"I don't think there will be any delay,\" I told her.\n\n\"Well the big group is supposed to meet tomorrow,\" she said. \"You're not well enough to tell your story.\"\n\n\"I'll be at that meeting,\" I insisted. \"And I'll tell my story.\"\n\n\"You have a bad head bump and two broken bones,\" Madison said with worry.\n\n\"If I don't tell my story,\" I explained, \"David's big group appearance will be delayed and the judge will have to let him go. That would be a win for bad people, and that's just not going to happen.\"\n\n\"Does David's bad behavior mean that much to you?\" she asked.\n\n\"David doesn't mean anything to me,\" I told her honestly.\n\n\"So, why is it so important to be at that meeting?\"\n\n\"Someone has to stand up to these mean people,\" I said. \"They hurt me to stop me from telling my story. They would have liked to stop me forever but if I don't tell my story tomorrow they get the next best thing.\"\n\n\"Aren't you worried about another bad thing happening?\" she asked. \"They already tried to hurt you once.\"\n\n\"I'm worried,\" I told her honestly. \"But I'm not scared.\"\n\n\"You're not scared of getting hurt badly?\"\n\n\"I don't want to get hurt, of course,\" I told her clearly. \"But I won't live being scared, either.\"\n\n\"A newspaper writer called you a BK hero,\" Alice referred to Bob's story about me. \"What did he mean by that?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Ask him,\" I said.\n\n\"I'm interested in your ideas.\"\n\n\"I never thought about it,\" I told her.\n\n\"Would you think about it now, please?\" she asked. \"We all know what AA group represents. What does it mean to be a BK hero?\"\n\nI thought about what it meant to be a BK hero by remembering how I had always tried to live my life.\n\n\"I would say,\" I started slowly, \"a BK hero is a person ready to stand up and defend everyone's right to live as they want, in peace.\"\n\n\"So, a BK hero stands up for people's rights.\" She tried to make my explanation simpler.\n\n\" 'BK Heroes for People's Rights' does sound nice,\" I said, helping Alice.\n\n\"Thank you. I think so, too.\" She smiled happily. \"And where do Big Knights come from, Ethan?\"\n\n\"A Big Knight is a feeling, not a place,\" I explained to her.\n\n\"Do you think we have enough Big Knights in PA town to stand up to Angry Group?\" she wondered.\n\n\"I don't know,\" I confessed. \"But I met some unexpected Big Knights at the park the other day.\"\n\n\"Henry said that tomorrow will be different,\" Madison told me. \"He said Angry Group will be very strong tomorrow and you won't get help. What if you're the only Big Knight in town tomorrow?\" Madison asked.\n\n\"Then I'll stand alone,\" I declared.\n\nMadison turned to the camera. \"Well there you have it. Ethan, the Big Knight, is ready to stand alone against Angry Group if he has to,\" she said in a serious tone. \"And we'll be there to share this story live from PA town square early in the morning. Join us. This is Madison wishing all you Big Knights a good day.\"\n\nThe red light on the camera turned off.\n\n\"Good job,\" I complimented Madison.\n\n\"I try my best.\"\n\n## CHAPTER 3\n\nBIG KNIGHTS\n\nFrom the police helicopter high above the ground, I saw what looked like a group of ants moving north on A1 road. I could also see the big road full of cars going north. It was early in the morning on a Wednesday, the day Adam was going to meet some important people at the PB big building.\n\nFrank woke me up from a nice sleep in my room at the BR police station just an hour before. I had been moved by a special car to the police station from the hospital on Tuesday morning, right after my talk with Miriam. Staying at the police station was my idea. I thought I was still a target for the bad guys, and I didn't want to put hospital workers, patients, or people visiting in danger. A bed from the hospital was put into the room, and I was hooked up to all the things I needed. Jerry wrote that I had been taken to a safe place as an important witness.\n\n\"What's happening?\" I sat up in bed when the boss woke me up. Right away, I felt dizzy and put my head back on the pillow.\n\n\"Nothing good, I'm sorry to say,\" Frank told me. \"I just got a call from the PB boss, who said that cars are stuck for a long distance off the big road and hundreds of people are walking on A road.\"\n\n\"Bad guys?\" I asked, feeling sick.\n\n\"I think so. Some of their big cars were seen in the traffic with people cheering around them.\" Frank moved his head slowly. \"You have to go to the big meeting at around morning time. We need to get you there on time.\"\n\n\"I will be ready soon,\" I promised him.\n\n\"We're going by flying machine,\" Benjamin said to me. \"I've already talked with the department.\"\n\n\"Do we really need a flying machine?\"\n\n\"From the way the PB town chief described the situation,\" Benjamin said, \"it's very busy out there. Nothing is moving.\"\n\n\"I didn't think David would get this much help,\" I admitted.\n\n\"Neither did I, but he did,\" Benjamin said. \"Maybe your talk with Mary made a lot of mean people. You were very clear.\"\n\n\"Mean people are always angry,\" I said. \"I just made them more angry.\"\n\n\"You got me excited, Ethan,\" Benjamin said. \"I wanted to be a BK member after listening to you.\"\n\n\"You're a BK member already, Frank,\" I praised him.\n\n\"Why thank you, Sir Ethan.\" He gave me a protective jacket.\n\n\"Do you think I need this?\"\n\n\"Wear it. There must be a lot of silly people out there today.\"\n\n\"There are a lot of silly people out there every day.\"\n\nI was moved by a wheelchair to a police car and traveled with a police group to the BA place. I was lifted onto the flying machine, still in my wheelchair, and Frank Benjamin came with me. He was wearing his safe coat.\n\nThe flying machine started to move down towards PB city. I saw that the front grass of the PB city big house had been surrounded by police officers holding big shields. From the air, it looked as if many people were below me. I closed my eyes. I had seen the scary view of angry crowds before, and I knew that a big group's bad feelings could make a person tired. My power was already low and I had to keep what little energy I had.\n\nI hid in the darkness behind my closed eyes trying to keep my strength. Sadly, I could still see with my mind.\n\nI saw a changing black-and-white old moving picture image of marching people on parade. I thought of the endless number of silly followers walking behind mean leaders like Adam, Henry, Isaac, Matthew, Samuel, Alice, Madison, and Benjamin. I heard them shouting. \"Not nice to Jews. Not nice to Serbs. Not nice to Americans. Not nice to pigs. Not nice to smart people. Not nice to anarchists. Not nice to Kurds. Not nice to everyone except us ... . . in God's name, of course!\"\n\nThe flying machine stopped moving, but I kept my eyes closed. I felt my moving chair being lifted from the flying machine and placed on the ground. I heard a loud noise and knew it was time for me to face my challenge. Ready or not, here comes Ethan. I got up from the chair, stood up straight, opened my eyes, and looked at a big man standing in front of me. He was not who I thought he would be.\n\n\"Benjamin?\"\n\n\"Hey, Coach Ethan.\" Benjamin smiled at me and gave me a big hug. It hurt a little because I had a boo-boo. He patted my back. I smelled something strong.\n\n\"How are you?\" Benjamin asked. He let go of me a little so he could see me better.\n\n\"Benjamin, why are you here?\"\n\n\"We're all here,\" I heard a voice I knew.\n\n\"Thomas!\" I looked past Benjamin to see my old friend. More hugs. More pats. More 'How are you's all around. Patrick was there. Thomas was there. Ryan was there. Matthew was there.\n\n\"How are you?\"\n\n\"How are you?\"\n\n\"How are you?\"\n\n\"Hey Ethan, do you remember Sam,\" Thomas said.\n\n\"Of course I remember Sam.\" I shook Sam's hand.\n\n\"I gave Adam 'Nuts' too,\" Thomas said. \"He told me you caught him twice but he liked you anyway. Same with 'Frank' over there.\"\n\n\"Frank, you staying out of trouble?\" I asked.\n\n\"I am but you ain't,\" Frank, a small-time game player, said.\n\nI looked around at more familiar faces from the old town. \"What's happening here,\" I asked.\n\nBenjamin put a hand on my shoulder and touched his forehead to mine. \"We saw you on TV, Ethan,\" he said. I loved the smell of garlic early in the morning. \"And your NE city buddies weren't going to let you face these bad guys alone. Thomas got a plane so we could be with you. Let those bad guys try something now.\"\n\nThomas, the boys, and I formed a circle, and we put our arms on each other's shoulders. I bit my lower lip and kept my head down.\n\n\"Thanks, guys,\" I said.\n\n\"Hey, we're BK too,\" Thomas said, opening his jacket and showing me his shirt that had the words _BK_ -- _How You Doin '_ printed on the front. \"There's a lot of BK here today, Ethan.\"\n\n\"Yeah?\" I asked, still looking at his shirt.\n\n\"Look around you.\" Thomas moved to the side and waved his arm around. I looked where he pointed, and I saw many people's faces for the first time. I was surprised. There were as many people with black skin as there were with white skin in the crowd. I blinked a few times, like I had just come out of a dark room into the bright sun.\n\nWhy was Tim there with Matt?\n\nWas that Ben next to them?\n\nWasn't that Carol and her girls smiling at me? And her grandkids too?\n\nWas that Sam, who is always a bother?\n\nWere Mrs. Fiona and Mrs. Fiona behind Sam?\n\nWas that Mrs. Madison? Smiling? Waving at me? Noooo!\n\nWas that the woman and her girl from the small house on the main road? Yes, it was.\n\nSam pointed at me. \"You're the man,\" he yelled, and his wife, Bella, waved excitedly.\n\nIt looked like every person who liked to play golf from the big neighborhood was there.\n\nJack, from the old shop, was there wearing a cap from the local baseball team. Where did he get that from?\n\nI turned around slowly and saw nothing but smiling, happy faces of different colors.\n\nI saw a little girl, sitting on a man's shoulders, holding up a hand-made sign that read: WE CARE!\n\nNext to her, a lady was holding a sign: BE FRIENDS--LOVE LIFE.\n\nSigns were everywhere.\n\nBE FRIENDS--LIVE AND LET LIVE!!\n\nBE FRIENDS--RESPECT LIFE!\n\nBE FRIENDS--FOR PEACE!\n\nBE FRIENDS--EQUAL RIGHTS!\n\nI was amazed.\n\nSamantha, the cookie thief, was there. I don't know how she reached there but I didn't ask. I just gave her a big hug.\n\nSamuel, the helper from PH city, was there handing out cards.\n\nLarry and Dr. Gabriel were there. The doctor seemed a bit confused.\n\nBenjamin from the \"You go, _we_ help\" ad was there, too, with his son, Henry. They both were holding signs.\n\nBE FRIENDS--BLESS OUR LAND\n\nThere were signs for girls' rights, everyone's rights, newcomer rights, animal rights, the right to go left. But mainly it was a gathering for everyone's right to live in peace.\n\nThe scene made me think of the peace rallies from some time ago. The words _Make Friends, Not Fights_ had been replaced by _Be Friends_ -- _Human Rights_ but the message was the same: _Live the life you choose in peace._\n\nI saw Queen Penelope walking toward me. Benjamin moved in front of her. \"Where do you think you're going, mom?\" he asked her.\n\nQuinn made a fist and shook it at Benjamin. \"Mom? Move out of my way, you big tree,\" she said to him.\n\nI put a hand on the big man's shoulder. \"She's my friend, Benjamin,\" I told him.\n\nHe looked at me, then he looked at Quinn. He looked back and forth again. \"Really?\" He was thinking about it. \"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"I'm sure,\" I told him. \"Her name's Quinn.\"\n\n\"I don't see any crown.\" Benjamin looked at her.\n\n\"How about I make you a king, you big silly son of a person?\" Quinn said to him.\n\n\"How do you know I'm from IT country?\"\n\n\"You smell like a garden, you big silly,\" Quinn said.\n\n\"Benjamin, she's my friend,\" I said.\n\n\"If you say so,\" Benjamin said, and before I could stop him, he hugged Quinn tightly. \"Any friend of Teacher Ethan is a friend of mine,\" he said, and gave Quinn a peck on the cheek.\n\n\"Aw no,\" Quinn protested and wiped her face.\n\nCharlotte appeared in front of me. \"Look what you did, Ethan,\" she said to me. \"They're all here because of you.\"\n\n\"Why?\" I still didn't understand. \"What did I do?\"\n\n\"You reminded everyone that they can be brave knights.\" She hugged me like a friend. \"Sometimes people forget.\"\n\n\"Is the entire DE community here?\" I looked around at all the children.\n\n\"I did my best,\" she laughed. \"They started gathering yesterday afternoon. Hey, even David is here.\"\n\n\"You're joking.\"\n\n\"No, I'm not. There are all kinds of children here.\" Charlotte was very excited.\n\nI looked around in wonder. \"Where are all the others?\"\n\n\"They couldn't make it today,\" she laughed.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"All the roads are full with people,\" she explained. \"The other team's buses couldn't get through. They're stuck somewhere on a big road, I think.\"\n\n\"What about Henry?\" I asked over the crowd noise.\n\n\"Last I heard,\" Charlotte shouted into my ear, \"he got lost in a crowd of children when he got off his bus north of the city and tried to walk through them.\"\n\n\"Lost?\" I said loudly. \"People don't just get lost.\"\n\n\"In a far land they do,\" she said seriously. \"Remember President George?\"\n\n\"Don't tell me about it,\" I said and covered my ears with my hands.\n\nCharlotte laughed.\n\nChief Benjamin tugged my sleeve. \"We gotta go inside,\" he told me.\n\n\"Okay,\" I nodded and turned to Charlotte. \"I have to go.\"\n\n\"Wave to your friends,\" she said as she gave my cheek a peck.\n\nI turned and waved. The happy, different, friendly group of kids stood arm in arm, happy in their differences and their human commonality, holding back the angry dogs together, for one fun day. It was a gathering of strangers.\n\n\"It's amazing,\" I said, shocked by the size of the moment.\n\n\"We did something good today, Eddie,\" Charlotte said. \"Maybe we even made the world a little better.\"\n\n\"We won the day,\" I told her. \"But the world is still a place with not so nice people.\"\n\n\"That's why we need our team.\"\n\nI saw Samuel being talked to by Madison.\n\n\"Why are all these people here so excited about Eddie and his team?\" Madison asked Samuel.\n\n\"Are you kidding me? Eddie's a hero,\" Samuel shouted over the crowd noise. \"He's like ... . . he's like ... . . a Super Helper.\"\n\n\"I like that,\" Madison giggled. She never should have encouraged him.\n\n\"He's an old hero.\"\n\n\"Cute,\" Madison said with less enthusiasm.\n\n\"He's Adam with aching joints,\" Samuel went on.\n\n\"This is Madison .. . .\"\n\n\"He's a Grown-up Guardian.\"\n\n\"Speaking from PB for News.\"\n\nI walked past Samuel and smiled. He winked at me.\n\nSuddenly I heard a single voice shout out above the noise, \"WE ARE!\"\n\nAnd I heard another voice answer, \"BK TEAM!\"\n\nThe second time around there were more voices. \"WE ARE!\"\n\nThe answer came from many voices. \"BK TEAM!\"\n\nAll together now ... . . \"WE ARE!\"\n\nI can't hear you. \"BK TEAM!\"\n\nThey wouldn't stop.\n\nI started up the courthouse stairs.\n\n\"WE ARE!\"\n\n\"BK TEAM!\"\n\n_What you say?_\n\n\"WE ARE!\"\n\n\"BK TEAM!\"\n\nAt the top of the stairs I came face to face with Alice. She was wearing a \"BK Team--Live and Let Live\" tee shirt that made her look nice. I saw her glance uncertainly at Charlotte walking behind me. We were happy together.\n\n_She is my pick,_ Mr. Jack said.\n\n_Life is about picking,_ I said but didn't agree or disagree.\n\n_Remember, we 're on the same team, Ethan._\n\n_You can think for yourself, Mr. Jack._\n\n_Hey,_ he said cheerfully. _I 'm a person. Of course I can think for myself._\n\n_You 'd think after many years I'd be able to pick without you._\n\n_You 're not big enough yet._\n\nHe was right, of course.\n\nTwo big birds landed on the grass across the street from the big building. I couldn't see clearly but it looked as if Bella and Olivia were getting out of the first big bird.\n\n\"Is that who I think it is?\" I asked Benjamin.\n\n\"Could be.\" He shrugged. \"And there's Samuel, the leader of BO town.\"\n\nFrom the second big bird I thought I saw more famous people.\n\n\"Why are all these famous people here?\"\n\n\"Looks like everyone wants to be a BO Knight today,\" Benjamin observed, patting me on the back. \"You should be proud of yourself, Ethan.\"\n\nI _was_ proud of myself. I was many years old and slowing down but I could still make a friend lose a game and a crowd to cheer. I had spent all my life answering mean actions with mean actions but today, I won this game with words not tools. I was never scared of being by myself, but being together with my friends today made me feel stronger than ever.\n\nThe last cheer I heard from the crowd as I entered the big house made me smile and I raised my hand in hello.\n\n\"BEING NICE.\"\n\n\"FRIENDS.\"\n\nThat's what I like!\n\nEverything seemed like it could happen.\n\n##\n\nKeep reading for a quick look at the new story about Ethan coming soon.\n\n## Beginning\n\nA LONG TIME AGO  \nDURING A BIG WAR\n\nThe flag with a sun and red rays was flying over the small island of TA. When the sun came up, a lot of ships and soldiers attacked the small island. A few days later, the sun flag went down, the star flag went up, and many soldiers were not alive anymore. Henry was not one of them.\n\nHenry, a young man from PR city, jumped from a water car into water that was up to his knees off of Red Beach One and walked to the land. When he got to the sea, eleven of his twenty friends were gone. Those who were still there... they were under attack. A friend who was running next to Adam stepped on a bad thing and was gone. Adam saw the friend's name tag fall to the sand and bent to pick it up. Something hit the front of his hat, knocking it off his head, making him fall on his back. He rolled onto his stomach, facing the sea. Red liquid from the top of his head went into his eyes but he was able to see his hat a few feet away. There was a hole in the front and another in the back. Something had passed through his \"hard hat,\" burned his head, and missed his brain by a tiny bit.\n\nHe put the M1 hat on his head and tried to get up. Immediately, loud noises hit his backside; two on the left side and two on the right. He fell facedown into the sand and heard himself shout. A body fell next to him. Adam turned to his right, wiping sand from his eyes and spitting it from his mouth. Friend Henry was on his back, mouth open, gasping. Henry's insides were outside and he was holding them in his red hands. He looked at Adam and winced. They were friends, but not close. In a training camp, Samuel, a boy who didn't go to school from WV state, called Benjamin a northern boy. Benjamin, who was much bigger and stronger than Samuel, reacted by knocking down Samuel with one punch. Their main teacher made them stop fighting, telling them to \"be angry at each other after the big fight.\"\n\nBenjamin grabbed Samuel's shirt and started pulling him towards the sea. Benjamin dug his arms into the sand and moved his body, trying to reach the water. When he tasted something salty, he knew he was near the sea. He felt his fingers being loosened from Samuel's shirt and heard, \"This one's awake. This one's not.\" He closed his eyes, not knowing who was who.\n\nBenjamin lived. Henry didn't survive along with many other soldiers and many more enemy soldiers in the three-day fight. When the big fight ended, a big officer was asked if the place had been worth the losses, and he said, \"No.\" When another officer asked Benjamin if he had been hurt while running away, Benjamin's answer was also \"No,\" but he said some mean words at the officer. He didn't follow the rules so he didn't get a medal but he wasn't sad about it.\n\nHe went back to regular life in the late 20th century, married Jessica, a girl he liked before the big fight, and they started a family. Adam worked for a clothes seller in PR city and later owned the company. During his work, he earned the respect of others. No one questioned Adam about his past. When he remembered a place far away, he wondered why he survived while many did not.\n\nOne day in the late 20th century,  \nIn LC city,\n\nCameron had just become a father with his teenage friend, Grace, when he received a message from Franklin saying there was trouble in LC city. Cameron left quickly to join Franklin without saying goodbye to Grace.\n\nFranklin and Cameron hurried to a place nearby hoping to find some valuable things. Cameron wanted a TV, Franklin desired a music player. They wore their matching jackets of a group.\n\nThey looked like a famous sports team.\n\nThey met another group member already at the location.\n\n\"What's happening?\"\n\n\"People are upset... the decision was that the officers were not guilty of hurting Arthur.\"\n\n\"Arthur, the one who likes motorcycles a lot?\"\n\n\"Yes, the officers stopped him for going too fast and then he got hurt.\n\nThe front of his orange jacket was messy. He was hurt.\n\nThat wasn't fair.\n\nBig Dog fell down and didn't get up. He was as young as the other boy who was also not moving.\n\nAfter some time, a woman named Gladys had a baby boy she named Cameron, after his father. The orange jacket group helped Gladys and her baby. They had Gladys do work to feed her baby and they made sure Cameron learned from the group. The streets of LI city became his school.\n\nWhen his mother got very sick and passed away, Cameron did not know how to read or write. But he could take apart a toy gun, clean it, and put it back together fast. He could also do other things. He became big and strong and could fight. He was part of the group from when he was a baby.\n\nWhen there was a big fight in LI city, Cameron was the group's best fighter. He was tall and big, he was scary and fought very hard.\n\nThat mean person... like a big bad wolf.\n\nWhen the big fights were over, Cameron was the head of the group. He was born without a dad, and some say he was born without feelings.\n\nHe got a nickname: Mad Dog Cameron.\n\n## Chapter 1\n\nBO Country HEROES AND OTHER SUPERHEROES  \nA winter day long ago\n\nSome people say I'm a super-old superhero. I'm not. Super-heroes have special abilities. I have special needs. Superman can see through things. I can't see well. Batman has a cool car. I have a small car. Spider-Man makes big webs. I have a problem. I was the best and the worst policeman in my city and the best at hitting targets. Now, I'm just an older ex-cop trying to get used to new things. I moved to BO city three years ago, and after solving small problems and helping two ladies, I became a detective. A young person who writes for the newspaper was looking for a story and gave me the name BO Knight, and the name stayed. I'm a small man, just a little over five feet, 165 pounds. But I'm brave and that makes me seem bigger.\n\nI had just sat down at the counter at K's BO City Deli and asked for a cup of coffee when an old man tapped my shoulder and asked if I was the BO Knight. I agreed. \"Ethan,\" I said, and offered my hand.\n\n\"Frank.\" His hand was very strong. \"I like you a lot.\"\n\n\"I like the US Marines a lot,\" I said, pointing to the sign on his cap. \"Do you live in BO city, Frank?\"\n\n\"I moved here after work many years ago.\"\n\n\"Do you like life after work?\"\n\n\"Not really,\" he said. \"My wife left me a few years ago.\"\n\n\"My wife left me many years ago.\"\n\nWe both went silent, thinking of the ones we missed.\n\n\"When were you a Marine?\" I asked.\n\n\"A long time ago during a big war.\"\n\n\"Did you have to fight?\"\n\n\"Yes, in a place far away,\" he said. \"TA place.\"\n\n\"I don't know about it.\"\n\n\"I wish I didn't,\" Frank said.\n\n\"Was it bad?\"\n\n\"Many Marines were hurt in a few days,\" he told me.\n\n\"How many of the other side?\"\n\n\"Who knows? I know I didn't hurt anyone. I never left the beach.\"\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\n\"I was hurt.\"\n\nI didn't know what to say... but I knew what not to say.\n\n\"Aren't you going to ask me if I was running away?\" Frank asked in a grumpy way.\n\n\"No, but it sounds like someone did... and you're still upset.\"\n\n\"Would you like that?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" I responded.\n\n\"You would have been a great helper.\" Henry patted my shoulder.\n\n\"I was never a helper.\"\n\n\"You were a helper on the streets.\"\n\n\"The streets could be a bit scary sometimes,\" I agreed.\n\n\"They're scarier now with the new people.\"\n\n\"I don't talk about beliefs or rules.\"\n\n\"Me neither,\" he said. \"But I don't like that different person from IL state. How would you feel having a different person from KE country in charge someday?\"\n\n\"How do you feel about having a similar person from TE state in charge today?\"\n\nThe old helper smiled. \"Good thinking.\"\n\n\"Hey, Ethan,\" a familiar voice called. Samuel, a friend from BO city, came up behind me and rubbed my shoulders like a friend does. \"How's my favorite hero?\"\n\n\"I'll ask him when I see him,\" I said. \"Say hello to Henry.\"\n\nThey shook hands.\n\nSamuel looked at the sky and ordered a drink to go.\n\n\"Why the rush?\" I asked.\n\n\"Club meeting soon.\"\n\n\"Has your club ever had good luck?\"\n\n\"Never,\" he admitted. \"But that's changing today.\"\n\n\"Are you planning something?\"\n\nHenry laughed.\n\n\"Even better,\" Samuel said. \"Big Toys has agreed to take our coins.\"\n\nI paused while drinking. \"You're getting coins because someone is taking your coins?\"\n\n\"Not just anyone. Big Toy's boss.\"\n\n\"I don't know him.\"\n\n\"Everybody knows him,\" Adam insisted.\n\n\"I don't know him either,\" Ben said.\n\n\"He's been getting more coins than anyone in the toy business for many years. He never loses,\" Adam boasted.\n\n\"Everyone loses,\" Ben said.\n\nAdam just smiled.\n\n\"How much does he get back?\" Ben asked.\n\n\"Twelve to twenty coins.\"\n\n\"That's amazing,\" Ben replied.\n\n\"Yes, it is,\" Adam agreed.\n\n\"Then why do you believe it?\" I asked.\n\nAdam patted my shoulder. \"The boss is very smart, Ethan. His customers are important people, helpers, and famous people. His toy shop has been closed for a long time.\"\n\n\"Why is it open now?\" I asked.\n\n\"It's not sudden. It took us many days to get in. We were lucky.\"\n\n\"Or unlucky,\" Ben said. \"How many coins did you give?\"\n\n\"Twenty friends at two hundred and fifty coins. That's his smallest number.\" Adam looked at his watch again. \"Gotta go, coins never sleep.\"\n\nSamuel had just left when Benjamin said, \"And a silly person and his toys are soon separated.\"\n\n\"You think he's being silly?\" I asked.\n\n\"No one wins the game all the time. Something isn't right.\"\n\n\"A lot of clever people think he can.\"\n\n\"Who says they're clever?\"\n\n\"Are you a player?\" I asked Henry.\n\n\"Yeah. I've had my toys with a very safe company named Lion Boats for years.\"\n\nI nodded but the name meant nothing to me.\n\n\"Is Samuel a good friend of yours?\" Henry asked.\n\n\"He's my best friend's brother-in-law,\" I said, referring to Tom from the North part of the Big city. Tom had been the best man at my party a long time ago and one of my wife's helpers a while ago. \"I'd say we're pretty good friends. Why?\"\n\n\"You're a helper in the sunny state, right?\"\n\n\"Over a year,\" I confirmed.\n\n\"Maybe you should do your friend a favor and look into B. I. Green.\"\n\n\"Why would I want to do that?\"\n\n\"If something sounds too nice it usually is.\"\n\n\"It's none of my business,\" I said. \"Besides, it's too late.\"\n\n\"It's never too late to help an old friend,\" my new friend said.\n\n## Chapter 2\n\nSEEING A BIG GIFT \n\nI went to my house to my friend, the lovely Charlotte. She was a brown-haired beauty who looked a bit like a movie star. She was different, and a little younger than me. We met two years ago when I had to go to the BO Hospital because of a hurt shoulder. Charlotte was my nurse. I didn't like her in a special way at first because I was not well, but when she made me feel better, I started to like her. I loved girls from islands. Charlotte was from an island, and I was already friends with a woman from LO city. The two women were very different. Alice was like a soft song, and Charlotte was like a loud music in a jazz show. I loved the fun I had with both of them, but Alice wanted to change me. That wasn't going to happen.\n\nI told Charlotte about Henry.\n\n\"He seems like a nice man,\" she said, \"and probably feels alone. Why don't you ask him to eat with us one night?\"\n\n\"Good idea.\" I got the current BO city phone book from a cabinet. Benjamin and Jessica were friends. Jessica had moved away five years ago but Benjamin still missed her. I called Benjamin and left a message. When I told him who I was, Benjamin answered.\n\n\"I only pick up the phone when I know who's calling,\" he said. \"Too many people try to sell me things.\"\n\nI explained why I was calling and he seemed happy and surprised. We tried to find a good time to meet and finally decided on a day next month.\n\n\"Maybe I'll see you at the store in the meantime,\" Benjamin said before we ended the call.\n\nCharlotte was at the kitchen sink when I walked up to her and gave her a cheek a little kiss.\n\n\"Thanks for the suggestion,\" I told her. \"He was really happy about the invitation.\"\n\n\"I'm not just someone with a pretty face and a nice body.\" She laughed.\n\n\"You're much more than that.\" I hugged her.\n\nI had a good night's sleep and was at work early the next day.\n\n\"I need you to look up a man named Ben,\" I told Liam when I walked into his office. Not long ago, Liam was a skinny computer expert who styled his hair like a rock star and was very smart. I was supposed to catch him doing something wrong when something unexpected happened. My heart started beating very fast as it had done many times before. David could have run away but he didn't. He stayed by my side and saved my life. In exchange I changed his. We became good friends and started working together after learning to be nicer to each other. I introduced him to computer wizard Jessica, who became the love of his life. We were like a family after that. Jessica and Liam moved in together, and Jessica moved her computer business into our new office.\n\n\"How much do you want to know?\" Liam asked.\n\n\"Be careful,\" I told him.\n\nLiam turned to his computer.\n\nTap, tap, tap... Pause... Tap, tap, tap... Pause. Tap... Strong tap...\n\n\"'Benjamin Isaac,'\" Liam read aloud.\n\n\"Benjamin Isaac? Really?\"\n\n\"You like Liam David better?\"\n\n\"What does a name mean anyway?\" I asked. \"Tell me about Benjamin.\"\n\nLiam looked at the screen. \"Born in a big city a long time ago. Normal childhood, went to school and graduated with a business degree. No awards. No special recognition. Married his high school sweetheart, Rachel, a long time ago. Started a small business in the late 20th century with some borrowed money. The rest is history.\"\n\n\"Sounds great.\"\n\n\"Nobody's perfect.\"\n\n\"Keep looking,\" I said.\n\nI went to my room, sat at my table, and touched the big button on my computer. My friend Liam had given me the computer and helped me learn how to use it. A picture of Charlotte lit up the screen.\n\nSomething blinked and a sound told me I had mail. I touched the mail square.\n\nTo: Ethan\n\nFrom: Jack--South Florida News\n\nSubject: Weary William--Call me soon.\n\nJack was the young newspaper writer who'd called me the Brave Knight. We had become good friends in the past few years.\n\nI touched the erase button, opened my little phone, read, You have one message, touched the HEAR button, and heard, \"Ethan, it's Jack. Call me.\" I touched to erase the message, touched Jack's quick-call number, and saw the \"connecting\" signal. I knew how to touch buttons, but it was all a surprise to me.\n\nWhen I was younger, TV was starting, ice delivery was stopping, cars had steps, phone numbers started with a name and a number--Longwood 6, Aspinwal 7, Copley 5--and group lines still existed.\n\n\"Ethan, thanks for calling me so fast,\" Jack answered, using his caller ID to know it was me. Jack was very active and lived every day as if he were on a deadline. He was only a young man but acted like he was in a hurry. He was too busy and focused on himself to have a family, and his favorite thing was the next tale. He would go anywhere and do anything for a special story. His leaders liked him because he was always working.\n\n\"What's going on?\" I asked.\n\n\"You remember Weary William, don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes. You wrote a story about him last year. A man without a home who thought he was a sad clown from a long time ago. Your story was shared by many.\"\n\n\"William was found early in the morning with a hurt head,\" Jerry told me. \"He's still breathing but not awake. He could be really hurt.\"\n\n\"I'm sad to hear it. But why are you telling me?\"\n\n\"I want you to find out about William's hurt for the newspaper. My leader already said yes to the idea.\"\n\n\"That's a job for the police,\" I said. \"Talk to them.\"\n\n\"I talked to Frank,\" Jerry said, talking about our friend, the chief of the police.\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\n\"He said his team would look into it well.\"\n\n\"Good, you don't need me.\"\n\n\"Adam, there are many people without homes in PB county, and hurts happen every day. \"The helpers have more important jobs to do.\"\n\n\"Frank will do good work,\" I said.\n\n\"Yes, he will. But Adam's problem will become a big puzzle for the helpers, and with no hints, they'll go do other jobs. I want you to make it very important.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I liked Adam when we talked,\" Jerry said. \"Plus I think we'll sell a lot of papers telling the only story of a BK investigation.\"\n\n\"So it's about work and friends.\"\n\n\"Yes. Adam was a nice guy. I'd like to make him seem real and get people to care.\"\n\n\"Where was he found?\" I asked, feeling myself getting interested.\n\n\"Under the big wood path in RP park.\"\n\n\"A place where people without homes go. He was probably hurt by one of his own,\" I guessed. \"Does everyone know about Adam's problem?\"\n\n\"No, I haven't written the story yet.\"\n\n\"Can you write a story that says Adam is asleep but okay?\"\n\n\"Yes. That's basically what's really happening,\" Jerry said. \"But why?\"\n\n\"The people who hurt him might get scared. Scared people make mistakes.\"\n\n\"Is this your way of telling me you'll help?\"\n\nAnd that's how I started helping in the case of the Sad-Faced Clown.\n\n## About the Writer\n\nSamuel was born and grew up in a place close to a big town.

This is not just a name we give him now but a name given by his friends during his time because of his bravery.\n\nThe best stories about the brave knight's life were written by a loyal friend who didn't care about his own fame but wanted to tell everyone about his brave friend. He didn't even use his own name, but we call him the LOYAL FRIEND. The stories you're about to hear come from this friend.\n\nThe \"Loyal Friend\" is thought to be James, a close friend of Benjamin, and perhaps his helper. He learned about Benjamin's early life directly from him and wrote about the later adventures he was part of in great detail.\nexciting adventures in which he joined; and he tells about it in a fun and interesting way. In an old list of a big library, his book is first mentioned as the _Story of Knight B_, by_ Jacques de Mailles, Paris, in a book format, 1514 (probably a mistake for 1524). The more famous version, with only the name of the \"Loyal Servitor,\" came out in 1527, under the title of\n\nTHE VERY HAPPY AND VERY FUN\nSTORY\nOF THE LIFE, THE BRAVE ACTS, THE WINS\nAND THE COURAGE OF THE GOOD KNIGHT\nWITHOUT FEAR AND WITHOUT FAULT\n\nBAYARD.\n\nLIST OF PICTURES\n\n\nBAYARD\n\nA GREAT SHOW OF RIDING A HORSE\n\nBATTLE OF FO\n\nBAYARD PROTECTS THE BRIDGE\n\nTHE HELPER SHOWS HIS CAPTURED PERSON\n\nCATCHING OF THE SPY\n\nBAYARD SHOWN TO HENRY VIII\n\nTHE PASSING OF BAYARD\n\n[Illustration: KNIGHT BAYARD _Without fear and fault_.]\n\nTHE TALE OF BAYARD\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nPeter T, the famous Bayard in stories, was born at the Castle of Bayard, in a place in D, around the year in the late 15th century, when Louis XI. was King of FR country. He came from an old and brave family, whose main privilege had been to fight for FR country throughout the old times.\n\nThe lord of BA castle had married Helene, a kind and religious lady of a noble family, whose brother Laurent was the Bishop of GR city. Peter, the hero of this story, was the second son of a large family; he had three brothers and four sisters. His eldest brother, George, was five or six years older than himself, then came his sisters, Charlotte, Jessica, and Madison, while younger than himself were Charlotte, and two brothers, Jack and Patrick.\n\nLike so many other old strongholds, the BA castle was built upon a rocky hill, which always gave an advantage in case of attack. It had been built by the great-grandfather and namesake of our Peter, probably on the site of an earlier stronghold, in the old times. No better position could have been chosen, for it looked out over a deep valley on two sides, in a wild and mountainous district of DA area, near the village of PO town in the GR valley. Even now we can still see from its ruins what a strong fortress it was in its time, with big towers three stories high, standing out well in front of the castle wall, and defended\nThere was a strong drawbridge. This place was very safe, like an old castle. \n\nBut when Benjamin was a little boy, castles were not just for safety anymore. They became more like big houses where families lived. They were comfortable with rooms and big halls. Before, these places were only for soldiers to stay and keep their weapons.\n\nEvery level of the castle had different rooms. These rooms had big windows in the thick stone walls. On the first level, which you could reach by a wide set of stairs, there were a small prayer room, a dining room, and a private room for the castle's master, David. \n\nOn the second level, there was a space for David's wife, Alice. Here, Alice kept her dresses. It was also a place where Alice's daughters and other girls who lived with them, did their sewing and slept. \n\nOn the top level, there were rooms for the very young children and their helpers, and rooms for guests.\n\nThe bottom floor under the eating-rooms was a dark place for storage and where helpers lived. Below that were cellars and scary holes, only reachable by hidden doors. The cooking-room, often round, was in an outside space. Here, big fires could be made for guests. The places for horses and rooms for the helpers were further away.\n\nThe eating-room was also a meeting place when the boss of the house had to solve problems, get his things, or tell off and punish anyone not behaving. At one end of this room was a big fireplace, where big logs could be put on the fire-dogs, and burn with a happy glow to light and warm everyone during long, cold winter nights. At meal times, fold-up tables were brought in for the food, with long seats on each side. For special times like important visits or big parties, a high table was put at the top end. The floor was covered with fresh straw, with wolf or bear skins in front of the fire. The walls had white and yellow patterns on the top part, and were covered with thick cloth below. In Alice's room, we find rugs and wall decorations made from thread. These were part of her wedding gifts or the work of her friends. Here, too, were a few comfy pillows on the floor to sit on, some carved chairs, tables, and chests. The head of the house always had his big chair with a headrest and curtains to keep away the cold winds, which were many and very cold in winter.\n\nThe story of Benjamin, known as the \"Kind Helper,\" starts on a spring day in the old times.\n\nAdam, the head of the house, sat by the fire in his own room, the walls of which were decorated with old tools and hunting prizes. He felt sick and sad. He was getting old--he didn't have much time left: so he told his good wife.\n\nWhat would happen to his sons when he was gone? A sudden idea came to him. \"I will call them right now, and we will let them have a say in the matter.\"\n\nAlice agreed to this, for she never went against her husband's wishes, and at least it would take his mind off his sad thoughts. It happened that all the four boys were at home, and ready to listen to their father's orders. When they came into the room one after the other, in front of the big chair near the fireplace, they felt a bit scared by the quick call. But they felt better when they saw their mom, who sat calmly in the back with her sewing work.\n\nThe group made a very nice picture. The old man, a big figure sitting in his big chair, with white hair and long beard and sharp black eyes, was wrapped in a long dark coat with fur, and wore a soft hat which covered his big eyebrows. In front of him stood his four big, strong, red-faced boys, waiting for his command with respect, as none of them would have dared to sit without being asked in front of their dad. Adam turned to his oldest boy, a big, strong teen of eighteen, and asked him what job in life he would like to do. Benjamin, who knew that he would get the land and that he would not have to wait long for it, answered respectfully that he never wanted to leave his home, and that he would help his dad faithfully till the end of his life. Maybe this was what dad expected, for he showed no surprise, but simply said, \"Very well, Benjamin, as you love your home\nyou should stay here and play with teddy bears.\"\n\nNext was Peter, a good boy, who was then thirteen years old, as playful as a bug, and he replied with a happy face, \"My lord and father, I love you and want to help you, but I love the stories of brave men of the past, especially from our family, that if you allow me, I will become a brave man like you and our ancestors. This is what I want most in the world, and I hope that I will not disappoint you.\"\n\nThe third son, Jack, said he wanted to follow in the steps of his uncle, Mr. A, a leader of a big house near L city. The youngest boy, Paul, made the same choice, and said that he would like to be like his uncle, the leader of G city.\n\nAfter this chat with his four sons, the lord of B castle, who was unable to go himself, sent one of his helpers the next day to G city, a little far away, with a letter to his brother-in-law the leader, asking him to come to his B castle as he had important\nthings to say to him. The nice man, Adam, who was always happy to make\nsomeone smile, said yes right away. He left as soon as he had the\nletter, and got there just on time at the big house, where he found Adam seated in his big chair by the fire. They said hello\nto each other\nhappily and had a very nice evening together with several other\npeople of DA place, guests of the house.\n\nAt the end of dinner, the wise man of BA place spoke to the\ngroup: \"My friend Adam, and you, my friends, it is time to tell you the\nreason why I asked you to come. You see that I am so old\nthat I might not be here in two years. God has given me\nfour sons, and they have all told me what they would like to do. My son Patrick\ntold me that he would like to be a soldier, and this made me very\nhappy. He looks a lot like my late father, and if he is like him in his\nactions he cannot fail to be a great and kind man. It is important for his\nlearning that I should send him to the house of a prince or lord\nwhere he can learn his job well. I hope that you will each\ntell me what great House you suggest.\"\n\nThen said one of the old knights: \"He must be sent to the King of\nFR country.\" Another suggested that he would do very well with the leader of\nBO town; and thus one after another gave his advice. At last the leader of\nGR city spoke: \"My brother, you know that we are in great friendship with\nthe leader Charles of SA town, and that he regards us as his\nfaithful friends. I think that he would happily take the boy as one of\nhis helpers. He is at CH town, which is near here; and if it seems good to\nyou, and to the group, I will take him there early in the morning.\"\n\nThis proposal of the leader of GR city seemed great to all present,\nand Patrick Benjamin was formally presented to him by his father, who said:\n\"Take him, my lord, and may God grant that he prove a worthy gift and do\nyou proud by his life.\" The leader at once sent quickly to GR city with\norders to his own tailor to bring soft cloth, shiny fabric, and all things needed to\nmake a noble helper presentable. It was a night to be long remembered in the\ncastle, for skilled hands were used under the eyes of\nthe master tailor, who stitched away through the long hours in such style\nthat early in the morning all was ready. A proud and happy boy was Patrick the next\nmorning when, after breakfast, dressed in his fine new clothes, he rode the\nA brown horse moved into the yard under the happy eyes of all the people gathered to watch him.\n\n[Picture: A great show of riding a horse.]\n\nWhen the excited animal felt that he had such a light weight on his back, and at the same time he was pushed on with pointy shoes, he started to dance around in a very energetic way, and everyone expected to see the boy fall off. But Benjamin kept his place like a man of thirty, pushed on his horse, and ran in circles around the yard, as brave as a lion, his eyes shining with joy. An old warrior like his father really liked the boy's courage and energy, and could hardly stop showing the pride he felt in him. But the smart Bishop probably thought that the boy had gotten quite as much attention as was good for him, and said that he was ready to leave, adding to his nephew: \"Now, my friend, you should not get off the horse, but say goodbye to all the people.\"\n\nBenjamin first turned to his father with a happy face. \"My lord and father, I hope God that He may give you a good and long life, and hope that before you leave this world you may hear good things about me.\" \"My son, that is my hope,\" was the old man's reply as he gave the boy his\nblessing. Benjamin then said goodbye to all his friends. Meanwhile, his mom was in her room, busy packing a small box with things that she knew Benjamin would need in his new adventure. Although she was happy about his exciting journey and very proud of him, she couldn't stop crying because she was going to miss him a lot; because that's how moms feel.\n\nBut when they told her, \"Madam, if you want to see your son, he is ready on his horse,\" the kind lady bravely went to the little door behind the tower and called for Benjamin. As he rode up proudly following her call and bowed deeply in his saddle, taking off his hat with a big smile, he was a wonderful sight for loving eyes to see. Benjamin never forgot what his mom told him before he left. \"Benjamin, my child, you are going to serve a great prince. As much as a mom can tell her child, I tell you three things, and if you do them, know that you will be successful in life. The first is that you should always respect and serve God; ask for His help when you wake up and before you sleep, and He will help you. The second rule is to always be nice and polite to everyone. Do not act like you are better than others. Be kind and help others. Do not be jealous, do not flatter others too much, and do not gossip. Be honest, my boy, in what you say and do, so that everyone can trust you. The third rule is to be kind with the things that you have. Be nice to people who don't have a lot, and share with everyone. And let's hope that people will always say good things about you as long as you live.\"\n\nIn a few easy words the boy said he would remember, and said goodbye to her with love. Then his mother, Alice, took out a small bag from her sleeve. It had her saved money: six gold coins and some small coins,[1] and she gave it to her son. Also, she asked one of the Bishop's helpers to take care of a small box. The box had clothes and other things for Benjamin, and she wanted him to give it to the man who would take care of Benjamin at the Duke's place. She also gave him two coins. They had to hurry because the Bishop, named Brian, was now calling his nephew. On that nice Saturday morning, Benjamin started his journey. He was riding his energetic brown horse towards CH city, with the sun shining and the birds singing. His future looked bright and beautiful.\nAdam thought he was in a wonderful place.\n\n[Note: The special hat was then worth 1 coin. When we change\nthis to today's money, we find out that the money that \nAdam got from his mom would be worth 266 coins today, or about\n10 special coins.]\n\nAdam left his home early in the morning, just after\nbreakfast, and he traveled all day with his uncle until, in the\nevening, they got to the town of CH city, where all the church people came out\nto meet the Bishop, for this was his place, where he\nlived. That night he stayed at his house without\ngoing to see the Duke, although the Duke knew he\nhad come, and was very happy. The next morning, which was Sunday,\nthe Bishop got up very early and went to say hello to the Duke, who was very nice to him, and talked with\nhim all the way from the castle to the church, where the Bishop\ndid a big church service. When this was over, the Duke took him by the\nhand to have lunch with him, and at this meal Adam helped his uncle\nand poured his drink very well. The King noticed this young helper and asked the Bishop, \"My good friend of GR city, who is this young boy helping you?\"\n\n\"My friend,\" was the answer, \"this is a helper whom I have come to give to you for your help if you want to accept him. But he is not now ready as I wish to give him to you; after lunch, if you wish, you will see him.\"\n\n\"It would be very strange if I said no to such a gift,\" said the King, who had already liked the boy.\n\nNow young Benjamin, who had already talked with his uncle, didn't take long over his own lunch, but hurried back to get his horse ready and good, then he rode slowly into the yard of the castle. The King of SA city was, as always, resting after lunch in the long hallway, or rest area, built the whole length of the keep, on a level with the first floor, and looking at the big yard below. It was like a hall, with big arched windows, and was used for a general meeting-place or lounge in cold or rainy weather. From there he could see the boy doing all his nice horse riding tricks as if he had been a man of\nthirty who had trained all his life. He was very happy, and turned to the man from GR city, \"My friend, I think that's your little favorite riding so well?\"\n\n\"You are right, my friend Duke,\" was the reply. \"He is my nephew, and he comes from a family of many brave knights. His father, who is old and hurt from battles, couldn't come himself to your place, sends his best wishes to you and gives you his son.\"\n\n\"Well!\" shouted the Duke, \"I gladly accept him; it's a very nice gift. I hope he becomes a great man!\"\n\nHe then called for the most trusted horse keeper and gave him young Benjamin, with a promise that one day he would make him proud. The man from GR city, having done his work, didn't stay long after this, but after thanking the Duke of SA country, said goodbye to him and his nephew, and went back to his own home.\n\nThose spring and summer months spent at the Duke's place stayed as a happy memory for Benjamin all his life. On special days and holidays the whole group\nwould go out into the woods or the fields, the Duchess Bella with her young girls and helper ladies, while the boys and helpers and helpers waited upon them as they ate under the trees, and afterwards played games and made the air fill with their happy songs. Or there were hunting and bird chasing parties which lasted for more than one day, or river trips down as far as the Big Lake, where the Duke had a summer house. It must have been on times like these when the brave young Benjamin met with the girl who caught his young liking, and to whom he remained loving at heart until the end of his days. Yet this pretty old-time story of boy-and-girl liking made no more progress, and when the knight and lady met in the years to come, once more under the caring care of the good Duchess Bella, they met as friendly friends only. The beautiful girl of CH city is known to history only by her later married name of Mrs. Fiona (or Fluxas), and in the records of bravery only by the tournament in which the \"Good Knight without Fear and without Wrong\" wore her colours and won the prize in her name.\n\nA picture: CHARLES VIII KING OF FR country _from a picture_.\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nThe King heard that the Duke of SA city was coming to his Court, and he sent\nAdam was asked by David to guide Henry and welcome him properly. They met him a short distance from a place named LY city and greeted him warmly. After this, the two friends rode together, chatting a lot. They were cousins and hadn't seen each other for a while. Now, this friend Adam was a great leader, and with his quick, watchful eyes, he noticed young Benjamin, who was standing close to his friend, and asked: \"Who is that brave little boy riding his horse so well that it's a joy to watch?\"\n\n\"Well,\" answered David, \"I've never had such a wonderful helper before. He's a relative of a wise man from GR city, who gave him to me as a gift not long ago. He had just learned to ride, but I've never seen a boy his age excel so much, whether on foot or on a horse. And I can tell you, my friend, he comes from a family of brave and noble people; I believe he will do great things.\" Then he called out to Benjamin: \"Use your energy, my boy, let your horse run and show what you can do.\"\n\nThe boy needed no second telling, and he gave such a great show of\nhorse riding that he made all his friends happy. \"Honestly, my leader,\nhere is a young boy who could become a brave knight,\"\nsaid David; \"and in my opinion you should give\nboth the boy and horse to the King, who will be very happy, for if the\nhorse is good and pretty, I think the boy is even better.\"\n\n\"Since this is what you think,\" replied Charles, \"I will certainly\ndo it. To be successful, the boy cannot learn in a better place\nthan the King's house, where honor can be earned better than\nanywhere else.\"\n\nWith such fun talk they went together into the LY city, where\nthe streets were full of people, and many ladies were looking from the\nwindows to see the coming of this important prince and his happy friends. That\nnight the Duke had a dinner in his own house, where the King's\nmusicians and singers made the guests happy, then there were games and\nfun, ending with the usual juice being handed around, and at\nlast each one went to his own room until the sunrise of day.\n\nThe next morning the Duke woke up early and went to find the King, whom\nhe found about to go to church. The King said hello to him at once very\nwarmly and hugged him, saying, \"My cousin, my good friend, you are indeed\nwelcome, and if you had not come to me I should have had to visit you in your own place....\" Then, after more friendly chat, they rode together on their mules to the church, and listened to a service, after which the King welcomed Adam, Benjamin, and other friends to dinner with him, and they had much fun talk about dogs and birds, tools and love-stories. Soon Benjamin said to the King: \"Sir, I tell you that my friend Adam wants to give you a boy who rides his brown horse better than any boy I ever saw, and he cannot be more than fourteen, although his horse riding skill is as good as that of a grown-up. If it pleases you to go and listen to a service at AI church you will have your fun time in the fields there afterwards.\" \"By my faith,\" cheered the King, \"I do wish it!\" and he heard the whole story of this amazing boy from Adam.\n\nWhen young Bob heard that the King was to see him he was as much happy as if he had won the city of LY; and he went in rush to the head caretaker of Adam and asked him to get his horse ready for him, giving his small knife as a gift. But this man said no and\ntold him: \"Go and clean yourself up, my friend, and put on your\nbest clothes, and if, with God's help, the king of FR country likes you, you might become a big boss and be able to help me.\"\n\"You can believe me, I will never forget all the good things you have\ndone for me,\" answered the boy; \"and if God ever gives me good luck you\nwill share it.\" It seemed like forever to him before it was time\nto ride his horse, followed by his helper, to the field\nwhere he was to wait for the king and his friends, who came by boat on the\nriver. As soon as Cameron had landed he shouted: \"My friend, make your horse go faster!\" which the boy did right away, and to see\nhim you would have thought that he had been doing it all his life. At the\nend of his run, Benjamin made his smart horse jump a few times, and then he\nrode straight towards the king and stopped in front of him with a low\nbow. Everyone was happy with the show, and the king told him to do it again. \"Go! Go!\" (Make your horse go!), he shouted, and\nall the children shouted: \"Pin! Pin!\" with joy, so that for\nsome time the name stuck to him.\n\nThen Cameron turned to the King of SA country and said: \"I see that my friend \nLiam told me the truth at dinner, and now I won't wait for you to give\nme this boy and his horse, but I want it from you as a favor.\"\n\n\"Most happily, my friend,\" answered the King, \"and may good wishes help him\nto do you true help.\" After this young Benjamin was given into the special\ncare of the lord Liam, who was very happy and felt sure that he\nwould make of him a noble helper.\n\nMeanwhile, the King of SA country stayed for a while at the Court of King \nCharles, with whom he was very liked, and they were like brothers\ntogether. This young King was one of the best of kings, nice,\ngenerous, and loved by all people. Finally, the day of going home came, and\nthe good King went back to his own country, with lots of beautiful and\nhonorable gifts.\n\nFor three years, young Benjamin stayed as a helper in the service of Lord \nLiam, being trained with the best care in all that would be\nhelpful to him in his profession of helper.\n\nHe won so much favor from his lord that at the early age of seventeen he\nwent from being a helper to a knight's assistant, and got a job in the General's team, still part of the house staff, earning some coins. As a knight's assistant, he would have a helper and some warriors, including one with a small blade. So, when we talk about a team of knight's assistants, it means each one has a group of six riders.\n\nWhen King Cameron found himself back in his loyal city of LY city, it happened that a certain lord, Lord Ben, a well-known knight's assistant, came to the King and suggested he should have a pretend tournament to keep the young men of the Court busy. He meant a pretend fight for a place, like a tough and narrow path in the hills. It was a much-liked test of being a knight, as the one defending would put his symbols on trees or posts put there for that, and whoever wanted to force this path had to touch one of the symbols with his\nsword, and have his name written by the King's helper in charge of them.\n\nThere was nothing that King Charlie loved more than these knight games, and he happily said yes. Mister Cameron started to get ready, and hung up his family signs within the area which had been made ready for the coming knight game.\n\nYoung Adam, who everyone called Picquet, walked past the shields and wished to accept the challenge and so get better at the knight game. As he stood there quiet and thinking, his friend, called Benjamin, from the house of the Sir Liam, asked him what he was thinking of. He replied: \"I will tell you, my friend. My lord has made me a knight's helper from being a page, and I wish to touch that shield, but I don't have the things I need like a knight's suit and horses.\" Then Benjamin, a brave young boy older than himself, said: \"Why do you worry about that, my friend? Don't you have your uncle, that fat priest of AB town? I promise that we must go to him, and if he will not give you money we must take his cross and hat! But I believe that when he sees your bravery he will want to help.\"\n\"help you.\"\n\nAdam immediately went and touched the shield, which made King-at-arms, who was there to write down names, start to talk with him. \"What's happening, my friend; you won't be growing your beard for the next three years, and yet you think of fighting against Mr. Cameron, who is one of the bravest knights in all FR country?\" But the young boy replied humbly: \"King-at-arms, my friend, I'm not doing this because I'm proud or think I'm the best, but my only wish is to learn how to fight from those who can teach me. And if everything goes well, I hope I can do something to make the ladies happy.\" This made King-at-arms laugh a lot, which showed how much he liked it.\n\nThe news quickly spread through NE city that Adam had touched the shield of Mr. Cameron, and it reached the ears of Mr. David, who wouldn't have missed it for a lot of money. He immediately went to tell the King, who was very happy and said: \"Wow! Cousin David, your training will make you proud again, if I'm right.\" \"We'll see what happens,\" was the serious reply; \"because the boy is still very young.\"\nyoung to handle the challenge of a man like Mister Cameron.\"\n\nBut that was not what worried young Benjamin; it was the question of how to\nfind money for suitable horses and gear. So he went to his\nfriend, Adam, and asked for his help. \"My friend, I beg of you to\ncome with me to persuade my uncle, the Abbot of AI town, to give me money. I\nknow that my uncle, the Bishop of GR city, would let me need for nothing\nif he were here, but he is away at his Abbey of St. SA town at TO city,\nwhich is so far away that there would be no time for a man to go there and\nback.\" \"Do not worry,\" said his friend, \"you and I will go to AI town, and\nI believe we shall manage it.\" This was some comfort, but the young warrior\nhad no sleep that night. He and Adam, who shared the same bed, got up\nvery early and took one of the little boats from LY city to AI town. On their\narrival, the first person they met in the field was the Abbot himself,\nreading his prayers with one of his monks. The two young men went to\ngreet him, but he had already heard of his nephew's act, and received\nhim very sternly. \"Who made you brave enough to touch the shield of Mister\n\"Cameron?\" he asked in an upset tone. \"Well, you have only been a helper for three years, and you can't be older than seventeen or eighteen. You need to be taught a lesson for showing such big pride.\" To which his nephew answered: \"Sir, I assure you that pride is not the issue here, but the wish and determination to follow in the steps of your brave family and mine. I ask you, sir, that, since I have no other friends or family close, you will assist me with a bit of money to get what is needed.\"\n\n\"Oh my!\" exclaimed the man, \"go and seek help somewhere else; the money of my house is meant to serve good and not to be used in games and contests.\" Benjamin now spoke up and protested.\n\n\"Sir, if it had not been for the goodness and the bravery of your family you would never have been head of this house, for by their goodness and not yours it was achieved. Your nephew is of the same good family, and liked by the King; it is completely necessary that you should assist him....\" After more chat of this kind the man finally agreed, and took the two helpers into his own room, where he opened a little cupboard, and\nfrom a bag which was inside he took out some coins and gave them to\nBenjamin, saying: \"I give you this to buy two horses for this brave\nboy, for he is too young to handle money himself. I will\nalso write a note to Liam,[1] my clothes maker, to supply him with necessary\nclothes.\" \"You have done well, my lord,\" said Benjamin, \"and I assure\nyou that everyone will respect you for this.\" When the young boys had\ntheir note they said goodbye with many thank yous, and returned at once\nto LY city in their little boat, very happy with their success.\n\n\"We are lucky,\" said Benjamin, \"and we must use it well. Let's\ngo at once to the clothes maker before your kind uncle changes his mind, for\nhe will soon remember that he has not put a limit to your expenses, and he can\nhave no idea what proper clothes will cost. You can be sure that you will\nnever see any more of his money.\" So they took their boat to the\nmarket-place, found the clothes maker at home, wasted no time in telling of the\nkind man's generosity, and encouraged Liam to work hard to make\nthe most beautiful clothes and armor, to show respect to\nThe rich uncle's brave nephew and his friend thought it would be fun to order a fancy outfit. They asked for a shiny suit made of silver cloth, velvet, and satin. The nephew's uncle later realized how much the outfit would cost and got very upset. But it was too late, the suit was already being made. The uncle was so angry that he said he would never give his nephew any more money. But this didn't change anything. The story spread and everybody found it very funny, even the King.\n\nThe brave nephew and his friend were lucky. They bought two great horses for less money than they were worth from a knight who had hurt his leg.\n\nEveryone was getting ready for the big tournament. It was going to be a fun day for the town and everyone was excited. The knights would compete in a special field marked with colourful posts. There were stands on one side of the field, decorated with colourful fabrics, carpets, banners, and signs. Here, the king and his friends would sit and watch the games.\n\nMeanwhile, with the king's okay, Mr. Cameron had told everyone in the city that he would play a game against anyone who wanted to, both walking and riding, on the next Monday.\n\nA game was always a fun and bright event, but this time, because the king wanted it and was there, it was more special than usual. Today, when men like to wear simple clothes, we can hardly imagine how fancy those knights from a long time ago were. When the brave man actually started to fight, he wore his shiny armor, often with gold or silver, a colored scarf on his shoulders with his symbol on it, and on his head a shiny helmet with a bunch of flowing feathers. But in the many special ceremonies that happened before or after the game, the knight wore his nice shirt, with his symbol on it in silk or gold thread, and an extra coat of velvet, often red with white or violet satin, made without sleeves if worn over the armor and finished with a short velvet skirt. Over this, a small coat made of soft or shiny material, and even sometimes of golden cloth, was worn lightly over one shoulder.\n\nIf this was the usual style of clothes, which also changed on different special days, we can understand how hard it was for young Benjamin to get such fancy clothes with his small money, and we can almost forgive him for the bold trick he played on his rich relative, the Uncle of Alice. Not only was the knight himself dressed up, but we are told that to be in a big competition even the horse had to have fancy coverings of soft or shiny material made by the clothes maker. We have not talked about the suit of metal, which was the most costly item of all; being made at this time lighter and more detailed, with its flexible covering plates of thin, strong steel, it was far more expensive than it had ever been before. The bravest knights at the Court were proud to try their luck against Mister Cameron. It was the rule that after the competition each hero was to ride the whole length of the field, with his helmet lifted and his face shown, that it might be known who had done well or bad. Benjamin, who was almost eighteen and still growing, was by nature a bit thin and pale, and had not reached his full strength. But with great courage and brave spirit, he joined in for his\nfirst challenge against a very good fighter. The old storyteller doesn't know why it happened, if it was because of God's special love or if Mr. Cameron enjoyed the brave boy, but it turned out that no one did better in the games, on foot or on a horse, than young Benjamin. When it was his time to ride with his face seen, the ladies of LY city praised him openly as the best champion. He also earned a lot of praise from everyone else, and King Charles said at dinner:\n\n\"I really believe! Patrick has started in a way that I think promises a good finish.\" Then, talking to Mr. Liam, he added: \"My family, I never in my life gave you such a good gift as when I gave him to you.\" \"Sire,\" was the response, \"if he shows himself to be a brave knight it will be more of your honor than mine, for it is your kind words that have encouraged him to do such a brave thing like this. May God give him love to keep going like he has started.\" Then the General said, smiling at everyone there:\n\n\"But we all know that his uncle, Mr. Adam, doesn't enjoy the young one's adventures, because it was at the old man's cost\nhe got his things.\" This comment made everyone laugh really loud, even King Adam, because he already knew the story and found it really funny. Not long after the big game, Mr. Liam called for young Benjamin in the morning and said to him: \"Ben, my friend, you've started off really well; you need to keep playing, and I want you to stay in my team with a yearly pay and three toy horses, because I've put you in my squad. Now I want you to go to the playfield and meet your friends, promising you that you'll find as good players there as any in the big world; they often have games and big matches to keep in practice and get praise. I think while waiting for any news of a big game you can't do better than stay there.\"\n\nBenjamin, who wanted nothing more, answered: \"Sir, for all the nice things and praises which you have given me I can only say thank you right now.... My biggest wish is to go and join the team that you're talking about, and if it is your wish I will start tomorrow.\" \"I am quite okay with that,\" said Mr. Liam; \"but you have to\nfirst say bye-bye to the King, and I will take you to him after lunch.\"\nWhich was done, and the kid was thus presented: \"King, here is your\nPatrick, who is going to see his friends in PI country, and he is here to\nsay bye-bye to you.\" Young Patrick knelt before the King, who said to him\nwith a smile: \"Patrick, my friend, may God keep doing in you that which I\nhave seen started, and you will be a brave knight; you are going to a\nplace where there are pretty ladies, be nice and brave to them,\nand bye-bye, my friend.\" After this, all the princes and lords came\naround to say bye-bye to the young soldier, with lots of love and sadness at\nmissing him. When he reached his house, he found that the King had sent\nhim a bag of three hundred coins, and also one of the best horses\nfrom the King's barn. With his usual big heart Patrick gave\nnice gifts to the messengers, and then went to spend the evening\nwith Mr. Liam, who treated him as though he were his own son,\ngiving him wise tips for his future life, and above all telling him to always keep\nhonor in his mind. This rule did he keep in very truth until\nhis last day. At last, when it became late, Mr. Liam said to him: \"Patrick, my\nfriend, I think you will begin your journey early in the morning, may God bless you!\" He hugged him while Benjamin kneeled and said goodbye to his nice boss.\n\nHe received more gifts that night. Two new outfits and a horse from a man named Sir Liam. So when the young helper left in the early morning, he had everything he needed like horses, helpers, protection, and clothes suitable for his job. As we saw, getting dressed was expensive during those times when important men wore fancy materials.\n\nHis trip to PI land was slow because Benjamin wanted his horses to be healthy. They only traveled a small distance each day. When they reached the little town of AI, their end point, all the young helpers there came to welcome him. His skill in a game with a man named Cameron had made him famous. They liked their new friend a lot. There was a fun young noble in the group who was impressed by all the nice gifts Benjamin had.\nthinking he was rich, a man told him: \"My good friend, you should make people like you, and try to win the hearts of all the beautiful ladies here. You could do this by hosting a competition, as we haven't had one for a long time.\" The young boy might have been surprised by this idea, but he was brave and didn't show it. He happily said, \"Really, Mr. Thomas, is that all? This will make me happier than you. If you can bring me the man who makes loud noises tomorrow morning, and if our leader allows it, I will make sure you're happy.\"\n\nThat night, Benjamin couldn't sleep because he was too excited. When Thomas came to his house in the morning with the man who makes loud noises, Benjamin had already made his plan and written his message, which said: \"Benjamin, a young boy learning to fight, from DA land, part of the FR country's king's army, under the great and strong lord, Mr. Liam--announces a competition that will be held outside the NE city.\"\nNear the big wall, for everyone, on a summer day. They are to\ndo a horse game with three rounds using the long stick without a 'fence' (in this\ncase meaning no barrier), \"with a sharp end, wearing full gear; afterwards\ntwelve rounds with a sword, all on horses. And to the one who does the best\nwill be given a bracelet with his symbol, as heavy as thirty coins. The next day there will be a game on foot with the long stick,\nat a fence as high as the waist, and after the long stick is broken, with swings of the\naxe, until it is finished by the decision of the judges and those who watch\nthe game. And to the one who does best will be given a shiny stone as valuable as\nforty coins.\"\n\nThis sounds more like a real battle than a royal game, and we see how\nserious this young player was. The mention of \"those who watch\nthe game\" is about the marshals of the game and the announcers who\nkept a very close watch on the players. They also kept the rules of the game and kindness, giving help to\nthose who needed it.\n\nWhen a young player first entered the game, he was warned by the shout:\n\"Remember of what family you come from and do nothing against your pride.\"\nThere were a lot of tough rules to follow. For example, you couldn't hit your friend with the tip of the stick, even though it was usually not sharp (but not in this game of Adam's). You couldn't try to hurt your friend's horse, and this makes sense, because back then, when a knight wore all his heavy clothes, if his horse got hurt, he was completely helpless. People always complained about the Samuels because they tried to hurt the horses. In a game, you could only aim for the face or the chest, both parts were covered by a mask and a chest cover, and you had to stop right away if the other person lifted the mask of his helmet. Also, no knight was allowed to go out of his line when they were running together. This was very important when the champions were split into two groups under the control of two leaders, and were placed right across from each other, at the two ends of the field. When the game leaders made a signal, they ran towards each other very fast, with their horses running as fast as they could. They held the sticks straight out until the signal came, then lowering the sticks, they ran forward in a big cloud of dust with loud cheering and the fight turned into a big mess. The knights who had stood the first\nIn a big game, brave Benjamin fought with his sword until a judge ended the game by throwing his marker into the play area. \n\nIn these games, the horses and the riders wore special clothes for protection, and sometimes these clothes were very pretty and expensive. \n\nWhen young Benjamin joined his group in AD city, there were many other groups nearby. When they were not working, they enjoyed playing exciting games. As you can guess, they were excited to play in the big game. Among these groups were the famous SG guards, who were invited to join by Charles the Seventh. \n\nThe game was planned to happen in just a few days, but still, many people joined. Luckily, the kind knight, Captain Louis, arrived in time to enjoy the game. When Benjamin heard of this, he was very happy.\nWhen his friend Benjamin arrived, Adam went to say hello. He was very happy to see Benjamin because Benjamin was very popular. To make the party even better, his other friend, Bella, came too. Bella had been waiting for two beautiful horses she was getting from a faraway place. Finally, the big day came, and all the people who wanted to play in the game were split into two groups. There were twenty-three people in one group and twenty-three in the other. The people who were chosen to be the judges were Captain Liam and Captain Quentin.\n\nNow it might be fun to talk about what things were like when this game was played, which was a long time ago. These games were first started as a way for people to practice fighting, and later they added rules about being brave and kind. Sometimes, there would be one-on-one fights for a prize or to see who was the best, and other times it would be group against group. These pretend fighting games were really popular in FR country, but they had to make strict rules to make sure the peaceful fights didn't turn into real fights.\n\nThe place where they had these games was usually a\nA square place, longer than wide, was surrounded by walls, often decorated with cloth and pictures. The people who made the rules were watching everything and made sure everyone followed the rules. Helpers were there to assist the knights' assistants, and help them stand up, with their heavy clothes, if they fell off their horse.\n\nIt was usual to have a \"game of knights\" for three days: two for the game on horses, first with long sticks, then with swords and clubs; while on the third day, on ground, they used long sticks with sharp ends. They wore very heavy clothes, sometimes nearly as heavy as 200 apples, so that a knight once he fell off his horse lay on the ground unable to move, and could not stand up without help. This heavy outfit was made even stronger by extra pieces put on over the left side, mostly, which got hit most - making a double cover for the head, body, and left shoulder. They had shoulder covers buckled on, the one on the right arm being smaller to leave room for using the long stick. Then we have arm covers; the upper-arm cover, the lower-arm cover, and the elbow cover called a \"elbow-guard.\"\n\nOn the special day for the games in AI town, the horn blew, and then the rules of the game were said out loud. Benjamin had to go first in the games, and against him rode a friend from home, named Thomas, a strong man. They ran at each other so strongly that Thomas broke his stick half a foot from the metal point, and Benjamin hit him above his arm shield and broke his stick into five or six pieces. Then the horns blew cheerfully, for the game was very good. After they had finished their first run they came back to face each other for the second run. Thomas was so lucky that with his stick he pushed in Benjamin's arm shield, and everyone thought that he had his arm pierced. But he was not hurt, and managed to hit back by a stroke above the face shield, which took off the bunch of feathers from his opponent's helmet. The third run with the stick was as good or even better than the others, for the stick was broken into more pieces.\n\nWhen these two friends had finished, next came the lord of BE town, and against him a man from SC country, named Captain David of FO, and\nthey also did their best with their three tries of the stick game. Like this, pair by pair, all the group did the same game. \n\nThis stick game was a favorite game for knights long ago, and knowing how to use this stick was very important for a fighter. We will often see, in the stories of Benjamin's adventures on the battle field, how very good he was with his stick. The best win with this stick was to use such skill and power as to break the stick--made of wood--into as many pieces as possible; in fact, to \"break\" it completely, and thus break as many sticks as possible. The game stick was often made hollow, and was from 12 to 15 feet long; but the stick used with the goal of knocking down instead of breaking was much stronger, heavier, and thicker, and instead of a sharp end had a \"top,\" which was blunt.\n\nThe first part of the game having finished, then came the battle of the swords. According to the rules, this began with Benjamin, who, on the third hit he made, broke his sword into two pieces, but he made\nsuch good use of the stump that he did all his tasks well. No one could have done better. After this, the rest had their turns. That day, there was so much good playing that the two judges said \"never had there been better games.\" When it was night, they went to young Benjamin's house, where a big dinner was ready. Many ladies came because many from a place ten miles away had come to see this great game. After dinner, there were dances and fun, and everyone was so happy that it was past bedtime before they went home. They woke up late the next morning, and they kept saying good things about Benjamin, for his good playing and his nice party.\n\nThe next morning, to continue the fun, all the players came to the house of their leader Liam, where Benjamin had already arrived, inviting him to lunch at his house, along with the ladies from the last night. First, they all went to a special place, and when that was done, \"you should have seen the young\nBoys holding the girls' hands, with much fun talk, brought them to Benjamin's house. If they had a good meal the night before, they had an even better one at lunch. There was no delay after this meal. Around two in the afternoon, all who were to play in the second day's games left to get ready. The players all arrived on horses, and seriously went around to greet everyone before the game started.\n\nIt was Benjamin's turn to start, and against him came a boy from HA country, Henry. They played with their sticks, one on each side of the line, and hit so hard that the sticks were soon broken to pieces; after this they took their wooden toys, which each of them had hanging by their sides, and gave each other big and scary hits. This seems to us a very rough game, but we must remember that these boys were dressed in costumes, and so fully covered from head to foot that there was not supposed to be a place where a pin could pierce between the joints of the costume. Under the helmet a smaller close-fitting cap was often worn. This fierce game went on until Benjamin gave his opponent a hit near the\near, which made him shake, and even worse, to fall on his knees. The winner charged again and made Hannotin fall down.\n\nWhen the judges saw this they shouted, \"Stop! Stop! Stop! That is enough; now you can go.\" After these two came Benjamin and Adam of Place PF, a gentleman of Country GA, who did amazing things with their sticks until they were all broken. Then they got the axes, but Benjamin broke his, after which the judges separated them. After these two came Thomas and David the boy from Country SC, and they did their job very well. So did others in turn, so that it was bedtime before it was all finished and, for a small game, the watchers never saw better playing in their lives.\n\nWhen all was over, each boy went to his home to remove his costume and change. Then they all came to Benjamin's home, where the meal was ready, and there were also the two judges, the lords of Place AR and of Place SQ, and all the girls. After dinner, it had to be decided and declared by the judges who should have the prizes. Some of the gentlemen most experienced in games were asked to give their opinion \"on their promise,\" and afterwards the girls on\nthey all did a good job without favoring one more than another. Finally, they decided that even though everyone had done their job well, in their judgment over the two days, Benjamin had done best of all. So, they let Benjamin, who had won the prizes, give his gifts where he wanted. The judges discussed who should announce the decision, but David convinced Henry to do it.\n\nA loud sound was made to get everyone's attention, and Henry said: \"My friends who are here, and especially those who have been in the game where Benjamin has given prizes for two days ... we want you to know that after asking the brave and good people who were there and saw the games, and the nice ladies here ... we have found that even though everyone has done their job very well, everyone agrees that Benjamin has done best in these two days; so the people and ladies let him have the honor of giving the prizes where he wants.\" Then he added: \"Benjamin, decide where you want to give them.\" Benjamin blushed a little and was very surprised. Then he said:\n\n\"My friend, I don't know why I'm chosen, because I think others are better than me. But if the adults want me to be the judge, I hope my friends won't mind if I give the prize for the first day to my friend Ben, and for the second day to my friend David.\" So, he gave the gold bracelet to his friend Ben, and the jewel to his friend David, and everyone was happy with his choice. After that, there was eating and dancing again, and the girls couldn't stop talking about how nice their young host was. We can think about how much all of this cost him, but he was always very generous, which made everyone who knew him love him.\n\nHe always gave his friends another try if they lost; if he had a token left, everyone shared it. He never said no to anyone if he could help it, and he was always kind and polite when he gave things away. His storyteller highlights how good he was from when he was young; the first thing he did in the morning was always to say a prayer, just like his mother told him to.\n\n\n\n\nThe picture shows a king named Louis from FR country, from a small round image.\n\nChapter 3\n\nFor two years, a soldier named Benjamin stayed at the army's place in Aire, learning more about how to be a soldier. After this, in a time long ago, King Cameron decided to go to a place called IT country for the first time. Benjamin, who was part of Count L's group, was excited to experience real battle for the first time.\n\nThe young king of FR country, who wanted to be known for his bravery, decided not to follow the good ideas of his father, King Louis. He wanted to be the ruler of a place called Naples, because he thought it was his right, given to him by a person named Rene of A. To avoid problems from SP country, he gave King Frank two areas named R and C. He also gave Emperor Matthew, two places named A and F-C. After giving away these real things, he started his dream of winning in far-away places, which might not help him in the long run.\n\nKing Cameron quickly gathered a big group of soldiers and went over the big mountains in a month long ago. This group had horse soldiers, bow and arrow men, cross-bow men, and SW country.\nsoldiers, and users of a hand-held fire stick. These last ones used a special stick that had only been in common use for some time. The fire stick had a thing, suggested by the pull of the cross-bow, to bring the burning match to the pull part. Before that, the match was held in the hand when using the stick. Some of these users were on horseback. Besides a few small pieces of equipment, the FR country army had 140 big throwers. The use of these fire sticks in battle had been growing since the time when Louis, now replaced by \"Liam\", made use of his \"throwers\" in the wars in FL country.\n\nWhen we read of the amazing success which at first came to the FR country army, we must remember how much better it was than the troops that were against it in IT country, which were mostly groups of adventurers gathered by soldier leaders, named Chiefs, who fought for stuff rather than for bragging rights, and didn't care much for the king who hired them. The soldiers working for them were, for that time, their own things, and their big wish was to keep them \"to fight another day,\" while they didn't want to hurt the men from another group (who\nmight be on the same side next time), and they only tried to capture people to get rewards. The quick action and real fighting spirit of the people from FR country was new and scary in IT country, which had been used to just pretending to fight for so long.\n\nAdam moved like a winner through PI city and FL city to RO city, then winning at CA city, he entered NE city with a big celebration. During the spring months, spoiled by his easy win, he spent his time having fun in that beautiful southern land, daydreaming about winning far away places. His success made the other lands worried, and a big group was made against him by all the IT country, the Emperor Matthew, and the Kings of SP country and EN country. Suddenly realizing he was in danger, Adam left his new land in the care of his cousin, Gabriel, with a few thousand men, and quickly started on his way back home. He left soldiers in various cities he had won, and his army was only about 10,000 men. They crossed the AP mountains with a lot of work and trouble, to find their way blocked by the group on the EM field near the village of FO city.\n\n[Illustration: Battle of FO city.]\n\nNever was a battle more hard fought than on that Monday, in the middle of the summer,\nwhen the FR country people managed to get past their enemies. The real fight lasted just over an hour, with a lot of chaos. This was made worse by a thunder and rain storm. We are told that Benjamin, the Good Knight, who had been with the King for the whole journey, did really well in the first attack leading Henry's team. He had two horses taken from him, then he kept fighting while standing, and in the middle of the fight he took the flag of the horse riders against him, and became very brave. The King, learning later about his brave action, gave him a gift of five hundred coins. Charles could understand a friend as he also fought bravely that important day. The FR country camp, with all its fancy clothes, special carpets, and dishes, was taken; but Charles and most of his soldiers, with all the big guns, managed to get through a big group of enemies and stopped the fight at NO city, where Liam was fighting against the Duke of Oliver.\n\nThe FR country King was soon to hear about the loss and damage of the small team he had left to protect NE city, and the death of the brave Viceroy, Gabriel. This is a sad story of the first big adventure to IT country, where four kings spent a lot of treasure and lost many lives. Cameron did not feel good after this. He passed away in AM town early in the year, when he was twenty-eight. As he had no kids, his cousin, Adam, became the next king. Adam was made king in the middle of the year.\n\nIf there was one thing that made Benjamin the Good Knight special, it was his loyalty to his boss and his thankfulness for any kindness he received. He never forgot the six fun months he had spent at the Court of SA country when he first started learning to be a soldier as a young boy of thirteen. It wasn't his choice to leave his first boss, who had given his favorite helper to the King, hoping this would help Benjamin's career.\n\nBut Adam, Duke of SA country, did not live to see this, because he had died in the past, and Rachel, his wife, had left CH city and moved to her house in the nice town of CA town, in PI country, about seventeen.\nmiles to the south of a place. This lady, Bella, had been a very\nkind friend to young Benjamin, and when she heard that he was near,\nshe invited him to visit her, and welcomed him very warmly, treating him as if he were part of her family. She was\nmuch loved and respected in a place called 'CA town', where she was a lady, and\nwhere there may still be seen, in the church of a place, a\nbeautiful monument to remember her.\n\nWe may imagine how happy the good Bella was to find that her\nyoung friend from old days had become a brave and famous knight, and\nthey must both have had lots to hear and tell of all that had happened\nsince they last saw each other. Here Benjamin also met another friend, the young lady\nwho had been one of the friends of Bella and who\nhad won the young love of the Good Knight. If the young friends had\nbeen able to do what they wanted it is likely that in the future,\nwhen they were older, they would have got married, so a person tells us in his story. But things changed them, as\nBenjamin went to the King's place, and the pretty lady was married later to a\nA very nice and kind man, named David, worked for the Queen of SA country. He had a lot of money and was very important.\n\nWe hear a sweet story about how Grace, who lived in DA country, was happy to see her good friend, David. They talked a lot about the old days and about being good and doing the right thing. Grace told David how she had heard all about the good things he had done, from his first game with Cameron, his big event in AP city, and the special day at FO, which made him famous in FR country and IT country. Grace said so many nice things about David that he turned red because he was embarrassed.\n\nThen Grace said to David: \"David, my friend, this is the big house where you grew up; wouldn't it be good if you do something special here like you did in other places?\"\n\nDavid said: \"Grace, you know that I have always liked and respected you since I was young, and I think you are very wise and nice, so I believe you only want what's best for me. Please tell me what you think I should do to make my good Queen happy.\"\nBella, to you above all, and to the rest of the nice people here right now?\"\n\nThen the lady from 'FR village' said: \"I think, my friend Benjamin, that you could set up some fun games in this town to make our friend Madison happy, who will be very thankful to you. You have here many friends from 'FR country', and there are other friends from our land who would all join you happily.\"\n\n\"If that's what you want,\" replied the kind Benjamin, \"it will be done. You are the one lady who has first won my heart by your niceness.... I ask you to give me one of the ribbons from your dress, as I need it.\" The lady gave it to him, and he put it into his pocket without a word.\n\nBella was always happy to chat with the kind Benjamin, who she liked a lot. But Benjamin could not sleep that night, for he was thinking of how to make the fun games happen.\nof his friend. When the morning came he sent a messenger around to all the\nnearby towns, to tell the gentlemen that if they would come within four days, on the\nnext Sunday, to the town of CA town, dressed as soldiers, he\nwould give a prize, which was the glove of his friend, from which hung a red stone\nof the worth of a hundred coins, to him who would win in three\nbattles with the lance, without a barrier, and twelve rounds with the\nsword.\n\nOn the promised day, about an hour after midday, the Good Knight was at his\nspot, fully armed, with three or four of his\nfriends, but only those were with him who were ready to take part in\nthe upcoming contest. Benjamin started first, and against him came the lord of\nRyan, a brave gentleman who held the flag of the Duke Patrick of\nVI country. He was a very brave and skilled knight, who gave a fine poke with\nhis lance to start with, but the Good Knight gave him such a hit on the\nwide band, which protected his right arm, that he disarmed him, and made\nhis lance to break in five or six pieces. The lord of Ryan regained his\nthe boy called Benjamin had a play-fight with another boy named Adam using wooden sticks. Adam tried to hit him two times but missed. However, Benjamin managed to tap him lightly on his hat, causing his feather to fall off. Adam was surprised but stayed standing. On the third time, Adam missed again, and Benjamin's stick broke into pieces.\n\nAfter them, Matthew and Henry had their turn, and they played so well that everyone clapped. Then came two other boys, and so on until all the kids were happy.\n\nWhen the sticks were broken, it was time for the pretend sword fight. But Benjamin only hit twice when his pretend sword broke, and he made Adam's fly out of his hand. The kind lady, Fiona, asked Henry to invite all the boys who had played to have a meal. After the meal, the pretend trumpets sounded, and the kids began to play music, but before the dancing began, it was decided to give the prize to the best player. The boys named Gabriel and Frank were the ones who had to decide, and they asked everyone--boys, girls, and the players themselves--and everyone thought that Benjamin, rightfully, had won.\nthe prize. But when they presented it to him he said that he did not\ndeserve it, but that if he had done anything well, Miss Fiona was\nthe cause, as she had lent him her cloth, and that it was her place to\ngive the prize as she chose.\n\nThe lady, who knew a lot about being nice and fair, humbly\nthanked the Good Knight for the honour which he had done her, and said: \"As\nMr. Benjamin has shown me this kindness I will keep the cloth all my life\nfor love of him, while as for the shiny stone, I advise that it should be given to\nMr. Matthew, for he is considered to have done the next best.\"\n\nThis was done as she wished, to the happiness of all, and Miss Bella rejoiced greatly in the success of the Good Knight, who had started\nhis job in her house. The Good Knight said goodbye to his noble\nlady, Miss Grace, telling her that he owed her help and\nlistening to her second only to the King, his main lord. Then he said farewell to\nthe lady who had been his first love, and they parted with much sadness, but\ntheir warm friendship lasted till the end. We do not hear that they ever met\nagain, but not a year passed without gifts being sent from one to the\nother.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration: LIAM KING OF THE MI CITY _from a small round picture_.]\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nWhile the FR soldiers felt safe in their control of IT country and let the young leaders join in fun, the runaway King Liam of MI city, who had lost his kingdom through trickery, was watching events and getting ready to go back.\n\nWhen Liam arrived he was welcomed with cheers, and entered MI city in victory.\n\nIf this quick change surprised all of IT country, we can understand the shock of King Louis, who found that he had to start his work all over again. Because not only had MI city rebelled, but all the other towns which he had taken over.\n\nKing Louis sent Sir DAVID as his top general, and of course the Good Knight went with him. I must tell you the story of an adventure he had. He was in a small fort about a day's ride from MI city with other young soldiers, and they were always going on small trips. One day DAVID heard that in the little town of BI town, near the PA monastery, there were about three hundred good horses, which he thought might be easily taken, so he asked his friends to join him in this adventure. He was so much loved that forty or fifty gentlemen\nhappily went with him. But the keeper of the castle at BI town knew about this through his helpers, and set a trap for the FR country people; he had a strong group hidden on the road, and was sure of winning.\nBut, even when surprised, the Brave Knight fought like a lion, and with shouts of \"FR! FR!\" led his small group again and again to the fight, for, as he told them, if news of this reached MI city not one would get away. In fact, so strong was their fight that they pushed back the defenders a long way to the very gates of MI city. Then one of the older soldiers, who saw the enemy's plan, shouted, \"Turn, soldiers, turn!\" and the others heard in time, but the Brave Knight, only thinking of chasing his enemies, rushed with them into the city, and followed them to the very home of the lord Liam. As he was wearing the white cross of FR, he was soon surrounded on all sides and taken prisoner. Liam had heard the shouts, and sent for this brave enemy, who was taken off his armor before being taken to the home.\n\nThe Duke of MI city was surprised to see such a young warrior, and asked him what brought him into the city. The Good Knight, who was never bothered by anything, said, \"Honestly, my lord, I thought I wasn't coming in alone, but thought my friends were following me. They knew about battles better than I did, or else they would be caught like I am....\" Then Liam asked him how many people were in the FR country's army, and he answered, \"As much as I can tell, my lord, there must be a lot of knights and even more foot soldiers; but they are all brave men, really wanting to win back the MI state for the King, our leader. And it seems to me, my lord, that you would be safer in the GE country than you are here, for your men are not ready to fight us.\"\n\nHe talked with so much sureness that Liam was quite entertained, and mentioned that he would like to see the two armies stand opposite each other. \"And so indeed would I, my lord, if I wasn't caught.\" \"Well, if that's all,\" replied the Duke, \"I will let you go right away, and make it up to the captain who caught you. But tell me, if you want anything else I will give it to you.\"\n\nThe Good Knight said thank you for this kind offer, and replied: \"My lord, I ask for nothing else except that with your kindness you will\nBe kind enough to give back my horse and my things which I brought into\nthis place; and if you can take me to my home, which is far from here, you will do me a big favor, for which I will thank you forever; besides keeping my respect and the duty to my King, I\nwould do anything you ask in return.\"\n\n\"Oh my!\" shouted the lord Liam, \"you shall have what you want\nright now.\" Then he turned to the Captain Benjamin who had caught him. \"Do you hear, captain, he is to have his horse, his things, and\nall his stuff right now\"\n\n\"My lord,\" was the answer, \"that is very easy because everything is at my\nhouse.\" So he sent two or three helpers, who brought the horse, and the\nclothes, which the Duke wanted to be put on in front of him. This dressing up took\nplace in the big yard, at least as far as the brave prisoner was\nundressed, and when Adam was fully dressed he jumped on his horse\nwithout touching the step, and asked for his long stick, which was given\nhim--a hard-headed tool about as long as a tree, the stick being of\nwood with a little flag waving at the top. Then, lifting his face cover, he said to the Duke: \"Sir, I thank you for the kindness you have shown me. May you be rewarded!\"\n\nThe brave Knight moved his horse, who danced around in a fun way, and then Benjamin showed a little of his skill with the stick which amazed the people watching and did not make lord Liam happy, for he said: \"If all the FR men were like this one I would not have a good chance.\" However, he said goodbye to the brave Knight kindly, and sent him off with a person who plays music to guide him back to his home.\n\nThey had not gone very far, only a little way from MI city, when they met the main group of the FR soldiers. Everyone was very surprised to see Benjamin, for there had been sadness because they thought that the brave knight had been too brave and had been caught because he was too young and reckless. When he reached the camp he found that the news of his brave action had reached there before him, for the Sir L, his kind leader, came forward to meet him with a smile, saying: \"Hello! P, who helped you escape? Did you pay your money? I was about to send one of my music players to pay it and bring you back.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said the Good Knight, \"I thank you kindly for your nice words;\nbut the lord Liam set me free because he is so kind.\"\n\nIn NE city, Liam met the army from FR country. The Duke's\nteam had people from many places--GE country \"friends,\" people from BU land\nwho were led by the same Cameron who had played with the\nGood Knight in his first game, and SW country helpers. There were\ngroups of SW country on the side of the FR country, and those in the\ncity said that they would not play against their friends in\nthe other camp. They put down their toys, and no scary words or promises\nmade them pick them up. Soon they found out that one of the doors of NE city had been\nopened secretly, and that the FR country were coming into the city. Then, as a\nlast try, Liam and his friends put on the clothes of common people\nand joined them. But the unlucky Duke was told on by\none of the SW country leaders, who was punished later by his own people\nfor doing something bad.\n\nWhen Louis had won this land before, he had given several\nimportant towns and places to his leader, the Sir of LI. These had\nturned against him with the rest of the duke, which bothered de LI,\nA story was told to the people of TO town and VO town that their houses were to be stolen and ruined. In those old times, this was usually what happened when people did not listen to the king. But the FR country's leader was kind and did not want to hurt anyone. Still, the people of VO town got scared. Twenty of the town's most important shopkeepers went to ask their king for kindness. They met him two miles away from their town. But King David didn't listen and kept riding on his horse with his soldiers to his house in the town. One of his important soldiers, Adam, said he would try to help them and told them to ask again tomorrow. This time about fifty important people came to him, and they did not wear hats, and they fell on their knees in front of the king. They talked for a long time and said a very sad prayer, ending with the offer of their most expensive silver dishes, cups, bowls, and valuable things worth more than three hundred marks.\n\nThe king didn't even look at the gifts they brought. He was mad at them. He told them they were very bad because they didn't listen to him before the bad king, Liam, had even come to their town. What happened to such scared and bad people? The\nkneeling people were scared and thought their end was near, when the\nleader, Liam, asked for kindness as a special favor to himself,\npromising that from now on they would be good and loyal\nfriends. Then at last David let his anger go away, and\nagreed with the wish of his good leader by giving a forgiveness. \"But as for\nyour gift, I do not want to take it because you are not good,\" he\nsaid. Then, looking around the room, his eyes saw the Good\nKnight, to whom he said: \"Patrick, take all these shiny things, I give them to you for\nyour kitchen.\" To which he answered right away: \"My lord, I thank you gently\nfor your kindness, but with God's help the things of such bad people will\nnever come into my house because they would bring me bad luck.\"\n\nThen the Good Knight took one shiny thing after another from the\ntable and gave it as a gift to each one of the people there, not\nkeeping a single thing for himself, to the surprise of every one. When he\nhad given away everything, he left the room quietly, as did many of the\nothers. David turned to those who stayed and asked: \"What do\nwhat do you think, friends? Have you ever seen a heart as big as my friend Patrick? God should have made him the leader of a big place. Trust me, one day, he will be one of the best knights in the world.\" Everyone agreed and praised young Benjamin. And when Henry thought about it, he sent Benjamin a beautiful red dress and a great horse the next morning, along with a bag containing some money--which he didn't keep for long, because he shared it with his friends.\n\nLiam had been so busy with his victory in a big city that he hadn't done much to win back the kingdom of NE city. This city was lost after David left, who passed away before he could fight for it again, after the sad end of his helper, Gabriel, and his brave little group. At this time, Frank was the King of NE city, having taken the place of his nephew, Fred, a while ago.\n\nThe king gave the leader role of his big group to Adam, who had brought back the first group to NE city. The group of Henry, under his helper, Captain Liam, was ordered\nto be a part of it. Benjamin, the brave knight, who didn't like to be left behind when there was a fight, asked his dear teacher to go with the officer's team.\n\nOn this important day, Liam, doubtful of his own power, made a big mistake of becoming friends with Frank, King of the SP country.\n\nKing Henry of the NE city didn't know anything about the secret friendship between FR country and SP country, and he thought Gabriel, known as the Great Captain, would come to help him with the soldiers of SP country.\n\nAs the friendship between FR country and SP country was based on trickery, we cannot be surprised that they soon argued over who gets what. King Frank of the AR country would never stick to any promise that didn't benefit him, and by his orders, the Great Captain, Gabriel, attacked the land of NE city itself. The leader of AU town had put his different teams as guards in different towns, and those which belonged to the leader of LI town were in the hands of his team, amongst whom, as we know, was Benjamin, the brave knight. We will now understand how it happened that he found himself fighting with the people from SP country, who had been at first the friends of FR country.\n\nBenjamin, the brave knight, had been put in charge of a guard team\nIn a place named MO town, there was a leader named Louis. For a while, there had been no problems in his town and he started to get bored. So, one evening he said to his friends: \"Friends, I feel like we have been in one place for too long without seeing any trouble. We might become weak because we're not using our strength, and our troubles might get bigger, thinking that we are too scared to leave our town. So, I suggest that tomorrow we go towards the nearest towns, AN town or BA town, and have a little adventure if possible.\" His friends agreed, and about thirty of them planned to start early the next morning. It was a happy group of young people who rode across the countryside early in the morning, and it happened that a man from AN town, Don Adam, had the same idea. He wanted to take his group of friends on an adventure. The two leaders met as they turned a corner by a hill, and they were happy to have such an opportunity. When Louis saw the red crosses, he turned to his friends and said: \"Friends, here is our chance to do something great...\nwe will not wait for them to attack!\"\n\nWith a shout of joy, they all put down their helmets, and shouting,\n\"FR country, FR country!\" they ran forward and clashed with their foes,\nwho came bravely on to meet them with the shout of \"SP country! St. Iago!\"\ncheerfully receiving them on the point of their lances. In the crash of this\nfirst meeting, many on both sides fell down. The battle lasted a\nlong time before either side seemed to win, for they were equal in numbers and strength. But in the end, one side must\nwin, and it happened that the bravery and skill of the Good Knight, and the\nexcitement with which he fired up his men, finally succeeded in breaking\nthe lines of the SP country people, of whom about seven were gone and the same\nnumber captured, while the rest ran away, and amongst them\ntheir leader, Don Alonzo. The Good Knight chased, calling out to him:\n\"Turn, soldier, it would be a shame to be caught while running away.\"\nEventually, Alonzo, like a big cat, turned against his chaser with\ngreat force; and they fought fiercely with their swords.\n\nFinally, the horse of Don Alonzo stopped and refused to go any more,\nwhen the Good Knight, seeing that all the other SP country people were gone,\nleaving their leader alone, said, \"Give up, man, or you are\ngone.\" \"Who should I give up to?\" he asked. \"To Captain Benjamin,\" was\nthe reply. Then David, who had already heard of that popular name, and\nknew that he had no chance of running away, gave up his sword and was taken with\nthe other prisoners to the fort, where with his usual kind\nmanners, Benjamin gave David one of the best rooms of the\nfort, and gave him all that he needed, with his promise\nthat he would not try to escape.\n\nThe captain was treated very nicely, being allowed\nto join in all the activities of the other gentlemen, and he had to give\n1000 coins to be free. But after a couple of weeks he grew tired of this life\nand persuaded a man in the fort to get him a horse and help\nhim to be free, for it was only a short distance to his own\nhome. The man agreed, tempted by a lot of money, and David, who was\nallowed to come and go as he liked, had no problem in going out\nthrough the big gate in the early morning, when he and his friend rode\ntheir horses and felt sure of success. But if Benjamin\nwas nice he was not careless, and when he did his usual morning visit\non his captured friend, he was nowhere to be found. The alarm was sounded, and the missing of the man from another place was noticed, whereupon Benjamin rushed off instantly to find him. David was caught within a short distance of AN city, where he had stopped to fix his horse's saddle which was broken. The man from the other place managed to get to the area where his people stayed, for he knew that he would be punished if he got caught, and the knight David was brought back to MO town.\n\nWhen Benjamin met him he said: \"Why did you break your promise, my friend David? I will not trust you again, for it is not right to run away when you have promised to stay.\" David tried to explain himself by saying that he only went to get his payment as he was worried because he had no news from his own people. But this did not help him much, for he was kept in a high building, but he was very well cared for with food and drink. After about two more weeks, a man with a trumpet came to say that the payment was coming, and when this was finally paid, David said a nice goodbye to his captors, having had time to see that Benjamin kept none of the money for himself, but shared it all with his soldiers.\n\nBut the tale isn't over yet. This unkind knight was not thankful and told his pals very mean things about how he was treated when he was caught. This made the Nice Knight and his pals very upset. So, the Nice Knight wrote a letter to Mr. Adam, asking him to take back his untrue words, or to have a serious fight. He sent this message with a man who plays a trumpet, and also let his foe choose the tools for the fight, and if the fight should be on foot or on a horse.\n\nThe captain from SP country sent a rude reply, saying he would not take back anything he had said, and that he would prove his words in a serious fight in twelve days, a little bit away from the walls of AN city. He knew that Benjamin was ill with a fever. But the Nice Knight did not let such a small thing get in his way and when the day came, he went to the place that was chosen, with Mr. Patrick and his buddy Kevin as his helpers, and about two hundred knights to honor him.\n\nBenjamin wore white as a sign of humility and rode a great horse, but since Mr. Adam was not there yet, a man with a trumpet was sent to hurry him up.\nhe was coming. When he was told that the Good Knight was riding a horse with\nthe usual armor, he exclaimed: \"How is this? I was to choose the weapons.\nHorn blower, go and tell him that I will fight on foot.\" He said this,\nthinking that the sickness of Benjamin would make it quite impossible for him;\nand the horn blower was greatly surprised, as all had been arranged for a\nduel on horseback, and this looked like a way of retreat for the Spaniard.\nSick as he was Benjamin showed no fear, and with the courage of a lion\ndeclared that he was willing to defend his honor in any way. The weapons\nchosen were a sharp sword and a dagger, while the\narmor used included a neck-piece and a secret.[1]\n\nWhen the camp was ready and the champions in face of each other,\nBenjamin kneeled down and prayed to God, then he bent to kiss the\nearth, and rising, made the cross sign before he advanced to meet\nhis enemy. Adam addressed him in these words: \"Benjamin, what\ndo you seek from me?\" And he replied: \"I wish to defend my honor.\" Then, the big fight began between these two brave men. They fought with great skill and bravery. The Good Knight's sword made a small cut on the face of Don Alonzo. Don Alonzo took good care of his face, but his enemy waited until he lifted his arm for the next attack. The Good Knight then aimed at his neck. Despite the strong metal of his armor, the Good Knight's attack was so strong that the neck part of the armor was pierced. The sword, which was only used for poking, was driven in so far that it could not be taken out. \n\nDon Alonzo, feeling hurt badly, dropped his sword and grabbed the Good Knight. They both wrestled fiercely until they both fell on the ground.\n\nThe terrible fight lasted for some time, until the Good Knight hit his enemy on the helmet with his small knife and said, \"Don Alonzo, admit your mistake and ask God for mercy....\" But Don Alonzo said nothing, because he was already gone.\n\nThen his friend, Don Diego, said: \"Good Knight, he is gone, you have won;\" and it was true, because they took off his helmet and he was not breathing anymore. This made the Good Knight very sad, for he would have given all\nhe used everything he had to win. Then the Good Boy thanked God happily for his win. He turned to the other knight's friend and asked: \"My friend David, did I do good?\"\n\n\"Too much, indeed, my friend Benjamin, for the honour of our home,\" was the sad answer. Then the Good Boy said that David should be buried with respect, and his friends took away the body of their friend with sadness. But we can think about the happiness and joy with which the good people and the FR country boys went back to the big house with their hero.\n\nThis fight and the other fights with David made Benjamin famous everywhere; indeed, his wonderful fame as the best knight really started from this time. You can think about how sad the SP country boys were and how they looked for a way to win.\n\nAfter the fight of CE place, fought in the late 15th century, Gonzalvo, the Great Captain, came into NE city with joy. When this bad news came to FR country, Louis XII. quickly sent a new army, led by la Tremouille, to help the soldiers already in AP place and CA place. The FR country leader got sick, and his job went into the hands of the\nMatthew, who found himself stopped and pushed back at every point by the smarts of Gabriel.\n\nAfter some time, the two groups stopped on either side of the Big River, one of the widest rivers in the south, going into the Big Sea. The FR group had control of the right side of the river, close to the higher ground, and so they had a better place than the wet lowland on the lower side, where the SP group stayed for many, many days. It was a scary time, in the middle of winter, with a lot of rain, and the soldiers in both camps were very tired, while some got sick and passed away. In these sad times, the happy, positive spirit of Benjamin, the Good Knight, was very important, and just him being there made his group feel hopeful and brave. He always took part in any brave act, and his famous defense of the bridge is maybe the most well-known of all his brave acts.\n\nThere was a bridge over the Big River which was in the hands of the FR group, and one day a certain David, a SP captain, small and short in body but big in spirit, came up with a plan to take control of it. With about a hundred horsemen, he started to cross the\nby a river, there was a small path that he knew. He had a walking person behind each horse rider. These walking people had \"big sticks\". Benjamin did this to start a loud noise in the FR country camp. He wanted all the army to run and protect it. This way, the bridge wouldn't be watched, and the SP country people could take it. David, who always picked the dangerous places, was camping near the bridge. With him was a brave man, named Liam. When they heard the noise, they quickly put on their armor, and rode their horses to go to the loud noise. But as the Good Man looked at the river, he saw about two hundred SP country horse riders coming towards the bridge. They would have taken it easily, and that would have been very bad for the FR country army.\n\n[Illustration: David protects the Bridge.]\n\nThen the Good Man said to his friend, \"My lord the Helper, my friend, go quickly and get our men to watch this bridge, or we will all be in trouble; while you are gone, I will try my best to distract them until you come back, but hurry up.\" He did this, and the Good Man, with his big stick ready, ran across the bridge to the other end, where the SP country people were about to\npassing. But, like a lion when it's angry, Adam ran at them with so much force that two or three of the first men were pushed back and fell into the water. They didn't come back up, because the river was big and deep. For a little bit they were pushed back, but seeing there was only one person, they attacked him so much that it was amazing he could stop them. But he stood at the end of the bridge so they couldn't get behind him, and fought so hard with his sword. He hit anyone who came close, that he seemed to the people from SP country more like a monster than a man.\n\nIn vain they threw long sticks, spears, and other things at him; the good person seemed to have a lucky life. In fact, he defended himself so well and for so long that his enemies started to feel a strange fear of this unbeatable person when, after about half an hour, his friend, Benjamin, arrived with a hundred people.\n\nThe story person adds that when Adam saw help coming he shouted, \"Hurry, noble ones from FR country, and come to help me.\" Not satisfied with pushing back the people from SP country from the bridge, the brave small group followed them for a long way, and would have done more but\nthey saw far away a large group of many horse riders.\n\nBrave Benjamin knew what to do. He told his friends: \"Friends, we have done a lot today by protecting the bridge; let's go home in a neat line now.\" Everyone agreed, and they started to go home quickly. Brave Benjamin was always at the end, taking care of everyone. It was getting harder because his horse was very tired.\n\nSuddenly, a lot of enemies came like a big wave over the FR country soldiers, and many fell down. Benjamin's horse was pushed back near a big hole. He was surrounded by lots of enemies, who shouted: \"Give up, give up, sir!\" Still trying to fight, Benjamin said: \"Friends, I must stop fighting now, because I'm alone and can't fight against all of you.\"\n\nIf we didn't hear the same story from many people, we would hardly believe that one brave man could stop so many enemies at the narrow part of the bridge for quite a long time. After a big fight, brave Benjamin could chase the bad guys and protect his friends as they ran away. It's amazing. It's not surprising that he was caught in the end, but that he stayed safe for so long.\n\nMeanwhile, all his friends had gone straight to their bridge, thinking that brave Benjamin was with them. But suddenly, a man from DA land shouted: \"We have lost everything, friends! Captain Benjamin is gone, because he's not with us. I promise that even if I am alone, I will go back and find him....\" When they heard this, all the friends turned their horses and started chasing the bad guys, who were taking away the best of all good guys. But the bad guys didn't know it, because Benjamin knew that if they heard his name, he would never be able to run away. So when they asked him, he only said that he was a good guy. They didn't even try to take away his weapons.\n\nSuddenly, he heard his friends coming to help, shouting: \"FR country! FR country! Turn around, bad guys; you won't take away the best of the good guys.\" The bad guys were surprised, and they were in a mess when the friends attacked. And as men and horses moved away, brave Benjamin saw his\nOne day, a man saw a chance, and without using the foot holder, jumped onto a\nbeautiful horse whose rider had fallen off. Once he was on the horse, he shouted:\n\"FR country! FR country! FR country! Benjamin! Benjamin! Benjamin! whom you have let go!\" When the people from SP country\nheard the name and saw the mistake they had made by leaving him his\ntools (without asking for his promise, which he would certainly have kept),\nthey got scared and went back towards their camp, while the people from FR country,\nhappy at having their \"Good Knight without Fear and without\nBlame\"--their one ideal of bravery and honor-- rode home over the\nfamous bridge. It's no surprise that for many days after, they could only talk about\nthis exciting adventure and the brave deeds of Benjamin.\n\n[Picture: The Boy shows his Prisoner.]\n\n[Picture: THE KING MAXIMILIAN]\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nThe wars of IT country had a strong attraction for King Liam XII., and he\nwas excited to join with the Emperor, the King of SP country, and the Pope in the\nLeague of Cambray against VE city, which was hated for her a lot of money and success.\n\nIn the spring, the King gathered another army, in which he focused a\nlot on the foot-soldiers, whose importance he fully understood,\nand for the first time he chose famous captains to lead them. The king called for Benjamin and said to him: \"You know that I am crossing the big hills to fight the people from VE country, who have taken a place from me, and other places. I am giving you the command of a group of men... but that can be led by your helper, Captain Patrick, while I want you to take care of a group of foot-soldiers.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" replied the Good Knight, \"I will do what you want; but how many foot-soldiers are you going to give me?\"\n\n\"One thousand,\" said the King; \"no man has more.\"\n\nBut Benjamin suggested that five hundred of these soldiers, carefully picked, would be enough for one man to command if he did his job thoroughly, and to this the King agreed, asking the Good Knight to bring them to join his army in the area of MI country.\n\nThe important city of PA city, which had been given back to the King Matthew, was left because of his carelessness with a small group of only 800 soldiers. Two VE country leaders thought of a clever plan to get the city back. It was summer by this time, and big carts of hay, from the second mowing, were coming into PA city every day. A group of people from a place hid under big trees near the walls, then they hid behind the hay carts and sneaked in through the doors, which they opened for their friends when they heard a special signal. The soldiers, surprised, were defeated, and the command was given to the brave General Gabriel, who fixed and made the walls stronger, knowing how very important this place was to his people.\n\nMatthew was very upset by the loss of a place, and gathered a big army, made up of men from all his friends, to surround it. He also used the biggest cannons ever--one hundred and six big guns and six big mortars, \"so heavy that they couldn't be lifted on to carts, they could only be filled with rocks, and were fired no more than four times a day.\" The place was well protected and defended, and they decided to attack the most important door which led to another place. This being a very dangerous task, the command was given to Benjamin of the attacking party. The door was reached by a long, straight road between deep holes, and there were four big barriers quite far from each other, all well defended. There was a big fight at every one of these barriers, and many brave\nfighters fell in the struggle, but the last one was the worst, for it was very close to the walls. The defenders rained stones on them with their big machines, and the attack lasted more than an hour with long sticks and battle tools.\n\nThen the brave man, seeing that this was taking too long, called to his friends: \"Friends, these men give us too much time; let's go on foot and get this barrier.\" Thirty or forty men jumped off their horses and with their faces uncovered ran at the barrier with their sticks, but the VE people met them again and again with more men. Then Benjamin shouted: \"At this rate, friends, they will keep us here for a very long time; we must give them a big attack and everyone should do as I do!\" This they promised, and the trumpet was blown, when with one big push they pushed back the defenders by the length of a stick, and with a loud shout Benjamin jumped over the barrier followed by his friends. When the FR people saw the danger that these brave men were in, there was such a push against the final barrier that the enemy was pushed back in confusion into the town. Thus they got close, and the Emperor's big machines were brought forward, and stayed there for a very long time until the\nThe fight was stopped.\n\nA bit later, the Good Knight named Gabriel found out from one of his friends that in the castle of BA town, about a day's ride away, there were many soldiers with bows and horses. They would leave the castle and take all the cows that were going to the camp. It was said that they already had hundreds of cows inside their walls. Gabriel knew that this had to stop, and his brave friends agreed to help him because they loved to fight and wanted nothing more. So, they left early in the morning and traveled towards BA town until they came to a small wooden bridge. A friend told them that the group from TR city would have to cross this bridge, where a few could stop many. Gabriel left a few soldiers and archers to hide near the bridge. They would wait for the group from TR city to pass by and then surprise them when they came back. Then Gabriel told one of his friends to take some archers with him. When he saw the enemy group on their way, he was supposed to pretend to fight them but then act scared and ride away quickly.\ndirection where the main FR country force was hidden behind rising ground. This\nwas all done, and the Good Knight with his friends rushed forth upon the\nchasing people, catching many, while the rest escaped in the direction of\nTR city, but were stopped at that wooden bridge and had to fight or\ngive up.\n\nWhen the fighting was over, Benjamin said: \"Friends, we really must take\nthat castle with all the treasures in it.\" When it was pointed out to him that\nit was very strong and they had no big cannons, he said that he knew a\nway by which they might have it in a short time. So he sent for\nthe two leaders who were caught and said to them: \"I want that the castle\nbe given to me at once, for I know that you can order\nit, otherwise you will be in big trouble.\" They saw that he was serious,\nand one, who was the boss, sent orders to his nephew and the gates\nwere opened.\n\nThe Good Knight took the castle, and within the walls of\nTR city found more than five hundred animals and much other stuff,\nwhich was all sold later at VI city and shared amongst the winners. As\nBenjamin sat at table with the two VE country leaders, a young friend of his,\nnamed Benjamin, came in to show a prisoner he had caught during the\nfighting--a big man twice his size. The boy had seen this man\ntrying to run away, had run at him with his stick, hit him to the\nground, and asked him to give up. He had given up his sword, to\nBenjamin's great joy, and the boy of sixteen, with the flag he had\ntaken and his strong-looking prisoner, had caused great fun in the\nFR country team. When he was thus brought into the eating-room before his\nown leaders, the flag man looked very embarrassed, and\nsaid that he had simply given up to the many, not to that\nboy. Thereupon Benjamin offered to give the man back his horse and his\narms and to fight him by himself. If the flag man won he\nshould go free without paying; but if the young boy won the man should\ndie. The Good Knight was happy at this brave offer, but the VE man\nwas scared to accept it, and all the honor stayed with the boy, who was\nknown to come from a brave family and showed himself worthy in the days to\ncome.\n\nMost of the FR country team went into the MI place, but Benjamin seems\nto have stayed behind with the group of VE city. By one of those quick\nchanges so common in IT country, before the end of the year Louis\nChapter 12 found itself deserted by most friends, the Pope, the King of SP country, Henry, and the SW country had joined the \"Holy Team\" to drive the FR country out of IT country.\n\nWhile Benjamin was with the group at VE city, in command of three or four hundred men who had been lent to the Emperor by the King of FR country, he had some exciting adventures. It was winter time, and that year, long ago, was long remembered for its coldness. The soldiers in the town were obliged to send for their horses' food sometimes to a far place, and they were constantly losing both horses and helpers, who were attacked by the enemy, so that a large group was necessary, for not a day passed without some meeting.\n\nNow there was a village about fifteen miles from VE city, where a certain captain, named Gabriel, was stationed with a number of men, and he amused himself by chasing the food finding parties up to the very gates of VE city. The Good Knight at last became very upset at this bold defiance, and he resolved to stop these raids by going out with the group himself the next time that hay was\ngathered from the nearby farms. He tried to keep his plans as secret as possible, but\nMatthew had a friend in the city who managed to tell him what was happening, and he decided to bring so many helpers that he would surely catch the famous Benjamin.\n\nOne early morning, the gatherers left the VE city as usual, and with\nthem were thirty or forty helpers and bowmen under the leadership\nof the captain, Patrick, a very smart and capable young man. The\ngroup soon left the main road to search for the farms where they were to\ncollect the usual loads of hay. Meanwhile, Benjamin, not suspecting\nthat his plan was known, had taken a hundred helpers and gone to a\nsmall village about six miles from VE city. From there\nhe sent out some lookouts, who soon came back with the news that\nthe bad guys were close, about five hundred horsemen, who were going\nstraight after the gatherers. Benjamin was happy to hear it, and\nimmediately set out to follow them with his helpers.\n\nBut Matthew, who had heard of the whole plan from his friend, had\nprepared a trap in a nearby empty big house, where he had about six\nhundred helpers with pointy sticks and shooters. These boys were not to move until they saw him and his friends pretending to run away from the FR soldiers; then they were to follow and win against Benjamin's team.\n\nThe kind boy had not gone very far when he met the VE team and walked straight towards them, shouting, \"EM and FR!\" They acted a bit tough, but soon began to walk back towards their hiding place, where they stopped just beyond it, shouting \"Marco! Marco!\" and began to bravely defend. On hearing the familiar shout of VE, the foot-boys gave a big shout and ran fast upon the FR, shooting with their toy guns, a shot from which hit Benjamin's horse toy and broke it. Seeing their dear friend on the ground, his friends, who would all have been sad for him, made a big charge, and a friend of DA, named Gabriel, jumped from his horse toy and fought with Benjamin. But the two could not win against the VE, who captured them and were about to take their toy weapons.\n\nCaptain Patrick, who was with the food gatherers, heard the noise and quickly rode his horse toy, finding his friend and Gabriel in trouble; for\nthey were being taken to a safe place. He was just in time to stop the bad men from taking them away. They were surprised and let the captured people go free. They went back to their group that was having a big fight with the FR country men. The Good Knight and Gabriel were soon riding their horses again and went back to help their friends who were now being attacked from both sides, with many more enemies than them. The bad men with guns were causing them a lot of trouble. Then the Good Knight said to his friend, Captain Patrick: \"My friend, we need to get to the big road. If we get there, we can leave despite the many enemies and we will be safe, with the help of God.\"\n\n\"I agree with you,\" replied his friend Patrick. Then they started to move back slowly, fighting all the way, until they reached the big road. It was hard, but they made it. The bad men lost many soldiers and horse riders. When the FR country men finally reached the big road which led to VE city, they came close together and started to move away very slowly, turning back to fight the enemies every now and then.\n\nBut all the time, they had those bad men with guns following them constantly\nattacking them, so that at the last run, once more the Brave Boy\nhad his horse gone under him. Before it fell he jumped to the ground\nand defended himself in an amazing way with his sword; but he was\nsoon surrounded and would have been hurt, but at that moment his\nflag-holder, Frank, with his archers, made so brave a run that\nhe saved his captain from the very middle of the V-town people, put him upon\nanother horse, and then closed in with the others.\n\nThe night was coming, and the Brave Boy said that there should\nbe no more running, as they had done enough for their honour, and the\nbrave little group found a safe place in the village of SA town, in\nthe middle of tall trees, where they had started in the morning. This was\nabout a short distance from VE city, and the V-town captain felt that more\nchasing would be dangerous as help would probably come from VE city. So he\nmade the retreat sound, and started to return to SA-B town, but on\nthe way his foot-soldiers, who were very tired, having fought for about\nfive hours, asked to be allowed to stay at a village some distance short of\nSA-B town. Matthew did not much like this, but he let them have\ntheir way, while he and his horsemen went on to their usual place,\nfeeling a lot unhappy that they had run around all day with so\nlittle to show for it.\n\nThat night the FR people stayed in the village of SM, and they\nate happily with such food as they could find, feeling very\nproud of their success, for they had hardly lost any men compared\nwith the other team. They were still eating when one of their friends arrived\nfrom SB, and he was brought before Benjamin, who asked what the\nV people were doing. He answered:\n\n\"Not much; they are in big numbers inside SB, and the word\ngoes that they will soon have VE, for they have a strong team within\nthe town. As I was leaving the Captain Matthew arrived, very hot and\nmad, and I heard him say that he had been fighting against a lot of\nscary creatures and not men. As I was coming here I passed through a\nvillage which I found quite full of their foot-soldiers, who are spending\nthe night there, and to look at them I should say that they are quite tired\nout.\"\n\nThen said the Good Knight: \"I think that those are their foot-soldiers we\nfought against today, who wouldn't walk any more. If you feel ready\nwe will go and get them. The moon is bright tonight, let us feed our\nhorses and around afternoon time, we will go and wake them up.\"\n\nEveryone liked this plan; they all did their best with the horses, and after having set the watch, they all went to sleep. But Benjamin was too excited about his plan to sleep; so in the middle of the night, he quietly woke his friends and set off with them on horses, riding very quietly to the place where the other soldiers were staying. He found them, as he thought, fast asleep \"like fat pigs,\" with no watch as far as he could see. The new-comers began to shout, \"Empire! Empire! Empire! FR country! FR country!\" and to this happy cry, the villagers woke up, coming out of their shelter to be caught like animals. Their leader, with a big group of men, went into the market-place and tried to fight there; but they didn't have enough time, because they were attacked from all sides and all his men were defeated, so that only three were left. These were the leader and two other men, who were brothers, and later were exchanged for FR country men who were in jail.\n\nHaving done their work, the brave Benjamin and his friends made their\nlong ago, to VE town, where they were praised a lot. On the other hand, when the people of VE city heard of the loss of their men they were very upset, and the leader Adam blamed Matthew for leaving them behind.\n\nWe can mention here that this Matthew was a great soldier and one of the best leaders of men-at-arms in IT country at this time.\n\nMatthew had a certain helper, who often went between VE town and SB town, and who helped both him and the Good Knight; but those helpers always help one better than the other, and this one hoped for the most gain from VE city.\n\nSo one day Matthew said to him: \"You must go to VE town and let Captain Ben know that the Council of VE city wish me to be sent in command of LI, a strong town on the AD, as the current governor is ordered to the LE with a number of big boats. Tell Ben that you know for sure that I start tomorrow in the early morning with three hundred light horsemen, and that I will have no foot-soldiers with me. I am sure that he will never let me pass without a fight, and if he comes I trust he will be defeated or captured, for I will have a surprise for him at IS (about\nfifteen miles south of VE town) of two hundred men and two thousand\nyoung soldiers. If you help him to meet me there I promise on my truth\nto give you two thousand gold coins.\"\n\nThis precious naughty guy promised that he would surely do so.\nHe went straight to VE town, and to the home of the Good Knight,\nwhere he was let in at once, for all the people there believed him to be\ncompletely in the service of their master. They brought him in as soon as\nBenjamin had finished dinner, and he was warmly welcomed. \"Well, Victor, I\nam glad to see you. You do not come without some reason; tell me, what news\ndo you have?\"\n\n[Illustration: Catching of the Spy.]\n\n\"My lord, I have very good news, thank God!\" was the reply. The Good Knight\nat once stood up from table and took the spy to one side, to learn what was\nhappening, who repeated the lesson he had learned. Benjamin was happy at\nthe chance before him, and gave orders that Victor was to be well\ncelebrated. Then he called together the Captain Patrick, La Varenne,\nhis flag-holder Frank, and a certain person from BU country who was a \"landsknechte,\"\nHenry, who had been with him in many of his battles. He shared with his friends what he learned from the sly one, and how Matthew was going to LI town tomorrow with only three hundred horse riders. Then he said that, if his good friends would join him, these visitors would not finish their trip without a little scuffle, but the issue must be dealt with immediately.\n\nThey agreed to leave at the break of dawn and bring two hundred soldiers. Henry had his house at the other end of the town, and while he was on his way home he happened to see the sly one leaving the house of a man who was known to be on the visitor's side. The captain instantly suspected something wrong; he grabbed the sly one by the shirt and asked him what he was doing. The man, caught off guard, went pale and stammered so much that the captain immediately brought him back to Adam's house. He found his friend just about to sleep, but the two sat together by the fire, while the sly one was closely watched.\n\nHenry explained why he felt certain that there was something not right. Adam immediately called for the sly one, and asked him why he went to the house of Mr. BV, the suspect. In his fear, the spy gave many different reasons. But the Good Knight, who we'll call Gabriel, said to him: \"Vincent, tell the truth and don't hide anything. I promise, as a true gentleman, that no matter what it is, even if it's about my death, I won't hurt you. But, if I catch you lying, you will be in trouble when the sun rises.\"\n\nThe spy knew he was in trouble, so he got on his knees and begged for mercy, which Gabriel promised him again. Then he told the entire story of the planned betrayal; how a man named Matthew would have a group of many men to try and harm Gabriel. The spy admitted that he had been to the house of a man named Benjamin to tell him about this plan, and to ask him to find a way to open the city gates to some other men, but he said that Benjamin had said no.\n\nWhen he had finished telling his story, Gabriel said to him: \"Vincent, my money was wasted on you, because you are not a good man... You should be in trouble, but I will keep my promise and you'll be safe with me, but I suggest you stay hidden, for\nothers may not be nice to you.\"\n\nThe secret agent was taken away to be watched closely, and Ben said to his friend, the captain from BU country:\n\n\"What shall we do to this Captain Matthew who thinks to trick us? We must get back at him, and if you do what I ask you we will have one of those great adventures which were done a long time ago.\" \"My lord, you just have to tell me what to do and I will do it,\" was the simple answer.\n\n\"Then go quickly to the house of the Prince of HA place, and with my compliments tell him the whole story. Then you need to get him to send us tomorrow morning two thousand of his 'soldiers,' and we will take them with us and hide them somewhere. If something amazing doesn't happen you can blame me!\"\n\nHenry started right away and went to the Prince's house, who was sleeping in bed. He was woken up right away and soon heard everything that his visitor had to say. This nice Prince, who loved battle more than anything else, was also such a big fan of the Good Knight that he could have said no to him. He said that he only wished he had heard of this sooner, as he would have joined the adventure himself, but Ben could\nuse his friends like they were his own. He quickly sent his helper to four or five of his most trusted friends, who, to make a long story short, were ready at sunrise to meet the friends who had known about the trip during the night. They all met at the city gate and started from the city towards IS town, and the Good Friend said to Henry: \"You and the 'friends' must stay hidden at SE village (a little village two miles from IS), and do not worry for I will bring our friends right to you, so that you will have plenty of fun today if you are a good friend.\"\n\nAll was done as planned, for when the hidden friends were left behind, all the rest of the brave friends rode fast to IS, as if they knew nothing of what was waiting for them. They were in an open field, where there was a good view from all sides, and soon they saw Captain Matthew riding towards them with his small group of fast riders. The Good Friend sent forward his flag holder, Frank, with some bowmen for a little game, while he rode after them at a good speed with the friends. But he had not gone far when he saw, coming quickly out of the\nIn a town called IT, there were some soldiers and a group of brave men. A man named Isaac pretended to be surprised and told the trumpet player to call everyone back. When Frank heard this, he started to move back with his group. They pretended to be going back to VE city, but they were actually moving slowly towards a village where their friends were hiding. A message was sent to Captain Samuel to get ready for a battle.\n\nMeanwhile, the men from VE city charged at the small group of brave men, making so much noise that it was like thunder. They thought they would surely win. The brave men stayed close together and were soon near a place called SE. That's when the friends of Patrick rushed out from their hiding place and charged at the men from VE city, who were very surprised. But they were brave and tried to fight back, even though many were knocked down by the long sticks of their enemies. Man named Matthew fought bravely, but he couldn't help his soldier friends.\nwho could not run away because they were too far from a safe place. He had to watch them being hurt and lost. The captain from VE city saw that he had to go away or he could get hurt or caught, so he rode his horse very fast towards SA town. Some people followed him for a while, but then the Good Knight made them stop chasing and come back. They came back with lots of caught people and horses.\n\nVE city's loss was very big because none of their foot-soldiers got away. There were about sixty important caught people who were taken to VE town, where the winning FR country, BU people, and \"landsknechte\" were very happy to see their friends. They were only sad that they had missed the fight. This brave journey ended and brought lots of honor and good words to the Good Knight. When he came back to his home, he asked for the spy and said to him:\n\n\"Victor, as I promised I will let you go. You can go to the camp in VE city and ask the Captain Matthew if the Captain Benjamin is as good in war as he is. Tell him that if he wants to catch me he will find me in\nthe fields.\"\n\nHe sent two of his helpers to guide the stranger out of the town, and the man went at once to SA town, where Matthew had him taken and treated as a bad person, without listening to any excuse.\n\n[Illustration: A Kind Man]\n_from a picture by Ryan_.]\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN\n\nWhen the big fight started again in IT country at the end of the year, Liam found that he had no friends except the Duke named Frank and some helpers from SW place. A kind man had joined teams with the people from VE town in his big wish to send the FR people out of IT country, and he was also very upset with Adam, Duke of FE town. He sent a message to the sad Lady of MI town that she should give up her town to him, as he needed it for his fight against FE town.\n\nWhen at last the brave protectors had been forced to give their fortress, the Kind man refused to take the won town in the normal way by walking in through the gate; he had a bridge built over the icy water and climbed in through a hole in the walls. It must have been a good sight to see, when he politely took the angry Lady of MI town out of the home she had so bravely protected, while\nshe held her head up and spoke her thoughts without fear, with as much confidence as he did.\n\nWhen the news that MI city had fallen reached Duke David, he thought that his own town, FE city, would be attacked next. So, he broke the bridge he had built across the big river and went back to his own strong town with all his soldiers. The Castle of FE city, in the middle of the town, with its big strong towers, was one of the most famous strong places in IT country and was believed to be very safe; it could only be taken if there was no food.\n\nThe wise leaders of the King, and his nephew, Duke Oliver, pointed out that FE city was very well protected, had lots of the newest big guns, and was defended by a group of experienced soldiers, among them was the group from FR country led by Benjamin. One famous captain from VE city gave his thoughts: \"Dear King, we must stop any food from reaching FE city by the river, and also from AR town and the land around it, which is very rich and good for growing food. But we will hardly be able to do this unless we take LB town, a place about a day's ride from FE city; but if once this strong place is in our hands we can make them run out of food.\ncity soon, considering how many people are inside.\"\n\nAdam saw the point at once and exclaimed: \"Surely, we must get that place; I won't rest until we get it.\"\n\nYou can guess how surprised the leader of LB town was when he saw a big army come. It happened when he only had a small team. He quickly sent a message to FE city, before the town was surrounded and the big guns were set up. He said how dangerous it was and how much they needed help right away. The trusty man went so fast that he got to FE city around midday, taking only a short time on the way. It happened that he met Benjamin at the city gate, and when Good Benjamin asked what news he brought, he said:\n\n\"My lord, I come from LB town, which is surrounded by many, many men, and the leader sends me to tell the Duke that if he doesn't get help he won't be able to keep the place even until tomorrow night if they try to get it ... because he only has twenty-five men inside....\"\n\nBenjamin went with him to the Duke right away. He met the Duke in the town square with the lord of MO town. They thought at first that a spy\nhad been told something, but quickly found out it was not good news. When\nDavid read the letter that Kevin had written, he turned a little white, and\nafter he was done reading, he shrugged his shoulders and said, \"If we lose LB town, we might have to leave FE city, and I don't see how we can send help in time. He asks for help before\ntomorrow morning, and that's not possible.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Frank.\n\n\"Because it's a very long way from here, and with this bad weather it\nwill be even longer,\" replied David. \"There's a narrow path for about\nhalf a mile where the people will have to go one by one. Also,\nthere's another thing, if our enemies knew about a certain path, twenty\npeople could protect it against a big group, but I hope they won't find\nit.\"\n\nWhen Adam saw how worried David was, he said:\n\n\"My lord, when a small thing is in danger we may think twice; but when we are\nfacing a big problem we must try anything. The enemies are\nat LB town, and they think we won't leave this city to stop them, knowing that the big army is so close to us. I have thought of a plan which we can do, if\nLuck is with us.\n\n\"In our town, there are many soldiers, really good and brave ones. Let's take some of them with some friends from the SW land under Captain Jack and send them up the river when it's dark. We still control the big river up to the AR place; they will go and wait for us at the crossing you talked about. If they get there first, they will take it, and the other soldiers in our town will ride all night. We will have good helpers and will plan to arrive when the sun comes up and meet the others; our enemies will not know about this plan. From the crossing, it's a short distance to LB place; before they have time to get ready for battle we will surprise them, and I feel that we will win.\"\n\nThe Duke, happy, answered with a smile: \"Really, Sir Benjamin, nothing seems too hard for you! But I think that if the gentlemen who are here agree with you, we will indeed win....\" No one had any problem; on the contrary, the leaders of the other soldiers were so happy that, as the storyteller says, \"they thought they were in a wonderful place.\" The boats were all made ready as quietly and secretly as possible.\nin the town, many people liked the Pope.\n\nLuckily it was in the middle of winter, when nights were very long. When it got dark, the soldiers got on the boats, which had good and wise boatmen. The horse riders, led by the Duke himself, also started when it was almost night. They had good guides, and they didn't have any problems on their journey even though the weather was bad. So, half an hour before early in the morning, they arrived at a small passage, where there was no one and it was very quiet. They were very happy about this. After waiting for a little while, the boats with the soldiers arrived.\n\nThe soldiers got off the boats and then slowly walked through a small path until they reached a very big canal between the PO river and LB town, where they had to cross a tiny bridge that was so narrow they had to go one by one. Crossing the bridge took a whole hour, so by the time they finished it was completely daytime, which made the Duke worried, especially because he didn't hear any loud sounds, so he was scared that the enemy had already taken over the castle. But just as he was talking about it, they heard three loud bangs, which made everyone very happy. They were only a little distance from the enemy, and the Good Knight said:\n\n\"Gentlemen, I have always heard that anyone who doesn't take things seriously is a fool.\"\nof his enemies; we are now close to ours, and they are three times more than us. If they\nknew about our plan it would be very bad for us, as they have big cannons\nand we have none. Also, I believe that on this time all the best\nof the King's army is in front of us; we must surprise them if we can.\nI would suggest sending Adam with a few horse-riders to make some noise on the side from which the bad guys came, and Captain Patrick with a big group of men should be very close to help him, and\nwe will also send him Jack with his team. You, my lord,\" he said\nto the Duke, \"with my lord of Montboison, my friends and myself, we will\ngo straight to the attack, and I will go in front to make some noise. If Adam\nis first in place and they attack him, we will go forward and\nsurround them; but if our team is first, Captain Patrick and the\nteam will do so on their side. That will surprise them so much that they\nwill not know what to do, for they will think we are three times as many\nmen as we are, especially when all our trumpets make loud noise together.\"\n\nNo one had a better idea, for indeed the Good Knight was so\nknowledgeable in war that all were happy to follow where he led.\n\nThere was a battle from both sides. David made such a loud noise outside the camp that the enemies quickly started to put on their armor, get on their horses, and go towards where they heard the noise. The foot-soldiers tried to get ready for the battle, but luckily this took so long that meanwhile, David's attackers were pushed back by Peter. At the same time, the SW country came down upon the foot-soldiers, who would have beaten them if the horsemen didn't charge at the enemy foot-soldiers from the other side.\n\nThe Duke and the FR soldiers, with two thousand foot-soldiers, who had arrived at the walls without being seen, now joined the battle from the other side, making the enemies very confused. They were completely surrounded and defeated. Some of the horsemen of the enemy army tried very hard to get back together, but Benjamin and another leader called their flags and charged at them, shouting: \"FR country! FR country! The Duke! The Duke!\" and attacked them with such force that most of them were knocked down. The battle went on for a long time, but at last, the camp was taken and those who could run away did, but there were not many.\nA big fight made the King lose many of his people, all his big guns, and their camp stuff. But it helped save the kingdom of FR country. They got more than three hundred horses and caught many important people.\n\nPeople talk a lot about this win because of Adam's hard work and bravery. The fight happened in the early part of the year.\n\nAdam was very brave in a city called BR city. He was not scared to go first into the fight and go against the scary guns. Adam didn't like these new guns. He liked the old way of fighting, where people showed their skill with swords and fought bravely. He used to say it was not fair that a brave man could be killed by a small stone or metal ball.\n\nAdam didn't believe in the stories people told in his time. But we can't forget that someone had predicted his death from\none of these new toys for play.\n\nWhen all plans had been made for the game of the town, David said to the leaders of the team: \"Friends, there is one thing that for kindness we must think about. You know that if this town is won by force, it will be messed up and taken, and many will be sent away, which seems very sad. We must try once, before they start, whether they will give up.\"\n\nThis was agreed to, and the next morning a messenger was sent from the castle, who walked down to the first wall of the other team where William, Mr. Adam, and his leaders came to meet him. The messenger asked if he might enter the town, but was told that he might say what he liked to those present who had the power to answer him. Then he gave his message, saying that if they would give up the city they should all be free to go and their lives would be safe, but if it were won by force they would probably all have to leave.\n\nThe answer they gave was to tell him to go back, for the town belonged to the Club of VE, and so it would stay, and they would take good care that no FR person would ever step inside.\n\nThe messenger brought back his answer, and when it was heard, there was no\nThe men were already ready to go.\n\n\"Okay, friends, we all need to do our best.... Let's go,\" said Adam, \"in the name of good and my friend St. D.\" Noisy things like drums and trumpets made a loud sound. The other team answered with a big sound, and the team from the big house on the hill started their walk down the hill, where the ground was very slippery, because it had rained at night. The leader and many others took off their big, metal shoes to walk better with the soft shoes worn under the armor, because no one wanted to be left behind. At the first wall there was a big fight, because it was defended very well, and while the Good Knight's team shouted \"Bayard! Bayard! Bayard! FR country!\" the other team answered with \"Marco! Marco!\" making so much noise that you couldn't hear the sound of the guns. The leader, Adam, encouraged his team by saying to them in another language: \"Stay strong, my friends, the team from FR country will soon be tired, and if we can defeat this Bayard, the others will never come.\"\n\nBut in spite of all his encouraging words his team began to lose, and seeing this the Good Knight shouted: \"Keep going, keep going, friends! It was their goal; they just needed to go forward and they would win.\" Adam was the first to go in and cross the wall with about a thousand men behind him. After a lot of struggle, they took over the first fort, but many of the defenders were hurt.\n\nBut just when they won, the Good Knight was hurt. He got hit by a sharp stick in his leg and it went in so deep that the metal part broke off and stayed in his leg. He thought he was going to die because it hurt a lot. He told his friend, Benjamin: \"Friend, go forward with your men, we have taken the city; but I can't go any further because I am hurt very bad.\" He was losing so much blood that he thought he would either die without saying sorry for his mistakes, or let two of his bowmen take him out of the fight and try their best to stop the bleeding.\n\nWhen the news spread that their hero was badly hurt, everyone in the army, leaders and soldiers, wanted to fight even harder to avenge him, and they fought bravely. Nothing could stop them, and they finally entered the city. The people and the women in the city threw big rocks and hot water from their windows at the soldiers, doing more harm than all the soldiers had done. But the men from VE city were\nvery defeated, many people slept in the big square and narrow streets where they were chased by the enemy. Of the brave army that had stayed in BR city with strong defiance, those who were not beaten were taken as prisoners. Among them was the leader of VE city himself. Then came a terrible time of stealing and all types of bad behavior. This was always what happened in those days when a city was taken over. The stolen things were worth a lot of money, and this eventually caused the ruin of the FR country's power in IT country. Because so many soldiers, spoiled by stealing, left with the things they had taken and went home.\n\nAt the same time, the hurt Benjamin was carried into the city by his two loyal friends and taken to a quiet street where the fight had moved on from. Here they knocked on the door of a nice house where the master had run off to a safe place, leaving his wife in charge. The kind woman opened the door to let the hurt soldier in, and Benjamin, talking to his friends, asked them to protect the house from everyone, knowing that when they heard his name no one would try to enter. \"And don't worry about what you lose in terms of stolen things, I will give it back to you,\" he said. The lady of the house showed the way to her guest room, where the Good Knight was carried. She knelt before him and said, \"Noble lord, this house and everything in it is yours now, but please protect my honor, my life, and my two little girls....\" She had hidden the girls in a small room under the hay. But the Good Knight, let's call him 'Knight Adam', quickly made her feel safe and promised that her house would be as safe as a home. Then he asked if she knew a doctor, and she went to bring her doctor with the help of one of the archers. The doctor checked Adam's wound, which was very big and rough, but he said that Adam was not going to die, and he would probably be able to ride a horse again in less than a month.\n\nKnight Adam's friends in the FR country army were very happy when they heard this good news. The general, who stayed in the NE city for about a week, visited him every day. He tried to cheer Adam up by telling him that they would have another fight against the Spaniards soon, and asked him to get better quickly, because they needed him. The Good Boy named Adam replied that if there was going to be a fight, he wouldn't miss it because of the love he had for his good friend Benjamin and for the King's service. Instead, he would be taken there in a cart.\n\nBefore going, when he had put the sad city in a simple kind of order, Benjamin sent Adam many gifts and a lot of money, which he immediately gave to his loyal friends. The Duke had no other option about his actions, because he got very important letters from the King of the FR country, who wanted the strangers to be removed from the LO place as soon as possible, because FR country was in danger from all sides, by the King of the EN country and by the SW country.\n\nAdam had to stay in bed for almost five weeks, which upset him a lot, because he got news from the FR country's camp every day, and there was constant talk of a coming fight. So he called for the doctor who looked after him and told him that all this worry was making him feel much worse, and that he had to be allowed to go to the camp. Seeing what kind of soldier he had to deal with, the nice man replied that the hurt was not closed but was getting better, and that it would be safe for him to sit on a horse, but the hurt must be looked after carefully night and morning by his barber. If anyone had given Benjamin a lot of money, he would not have been so happy, and he planned to leave in two days. The morning he was supposed to leave after lunch, the kind lady who lived in the house came to talk to him. She knew that because of the rules of war, she, her daughters, and her husband (who had come back from the place where he had hidden) were all under the control of this FR knight, and everything in the house was his. But she found him so nice and polite that she hoped to make him like her with a big gift, and she brought with her one of her helpers carrying a metal box containing a lot of coins. When she came into Benjamin's room she fell on her knees in front of him, but he wouldn't let her say anything until she was sitting next to him. Then she told him how thankful she was for his knightly politeness and protection, and finally offered him the box, opening it to show what was inside. But Benjamin pushed it away with a friendly smile, and answered:\n\n\"I promise, dear lady, I've never cared about money! No amount of money could ever be as important to me as the kindness and love you've shown me while I've been here, and I promise that as long as I live you will always have a faithful gentleman to help you. I say thank you a lot for your coins, but I ask that you take them back...\" However, the lady felt so sad that he said no that he finally took the box. He asked her to send her girls to say bye to him. When they came and tried to kneel in front of him, he did not let them. He thanked them for their nice acts like playing their small guitar and singing when he was sick. He also asked them to take the coins in their mom's box, which he poured into their clothes even if they didn't want him to. The mom, happy because of his nice words, thanked him with tears: \"You are the best knight, may the Happy Helper reward you in this world and the next.\" When the Nice Knight's horses were ready in the afternoon, after lunch, the two nice girls gave him some gifts they made, bracelets made with hair tied with gold and silver strings, and a small embroidered bag, which he put in his arm, and the bracelets on his arms, with many thanks, which made the girls very happy. Then, he said nice words and said bye in a nice way. He left and rode away with a lot of friends.\nfriends to a camp near a city, where he was greeted with happiness and honor by all the FR soldiers.\n\nWhen Gabriel, a duke, arrived at the camp before the city he gathered all the leaders together to think about what was to be done, for the FR soldiers started to suffer a lot because there was not enough food, which was hard to get. They were very short of bread and wine, because the VE people had stopped the supplies from one side and the SP army held all the beach of the country.\n\nThere was also another reason for hurry, which was not yet known to the FR leaders. Matthew had been unsure and changing his mind in his friendships, but had now definitely decided to join the side of Pope Joshua and the King of SP. As usual there were groups of GE and SW soldiers both in the IT army and also with the FR, and these owed some kind of loyalty to the leader of their land. So it was that the King had sent word to the groups of GE soldiers that they were to go home at once and were not to fight against the SP. Now it happened that this letter had only been seen by the Captain Jack, who led these soldiers in the FR army, and he, being a great friend of Benjamin, privately asked his advice, first telling\nhim that having accepted the gift from the FR country King he had no plan of\nbetraying him when it was time for battle. But he thought that it would be\ngood to start the battle soon before more letters should arrive from\nthe Emperor and give the men a reason to leave. The Good Knight understood\nhow important this was and told him to share it with the general, the\nDuke de Nemours.\n\nDuke Gabriel, who had now heard of the Emperor's letter, said that they had\nno choice, and also that his uncle, the King of FR country, was sending\nlots of messengers to speed up war actions as he was in big trouble.\nBenjamin was asked to share his thoughts, and he humbly answered that he had\njust arrived and others might know more, but from what he could learn,\nthe people in the city were promised that a big army from NE city and RO city would\ncome to their help in a few days, definitely before a special holiday, and this was\na special Thursday. \"And on the other hand,\" he added, \"our men have no\nfood and the horses are eating tree leaves, so that each\nday's delay makes it worse for us. You see, too, the King our leader writes\nto us every day to speed up our actions, therefore I suggest that we start\nthe battle. But we must be careful because we have to deal with brave and good\nfighting people, and we cannot ignore the risk and danger. There is one good thing:\nthe big group has been in RO land for a year, eating a lot\nuntil they are full, while our group, having experienced many difficulties,\ncan do more. Remember that the group who fights the longest will\nstay.\"\n\nAt this, everyone smiled, because Adam always had such a cheerful and nice\nway of saying things that people liked to listen to him. His advice was followed and everything was prepared for a strong attack on the town the next day, which\nwas a special day. The leaders and their group left in a happy mood, as\nif they were going to a party, and so strong was the attack of the\nbig guns that before long a small opening was made in the wall,\nbut the defenders fought so well that it was not possible to break through\nand at length they had to go back. This was really a lucky thing,\nas if the soldiers had started taking things from the place the coming fight would\nsurely have been lost, and the helping group was now very close\nto the RA town.\n\nIt would be too long to tell the whole story of that fierce and tough\nfight, where both groups fought with the most skill and bravery. The\nbig group certainly did their usual thing of constantly aiming\nat the horses of the FR riders, for they have a saying which says:\n\"When the horse is gone, the soldier is lost.\" Their battle yell was:\n\"SP country! SP country! SP country! St. Isaac!\" to which the other side answered with another\nstrong attack to the shouts of \"FR country! FR country!\" And wherever the Good\nKnight went, \"Gabriel! Gabriel!\" was the loud cheer which encouraged his\nteam, always in the front of battle. The FR country big boomers were used\nwith great success, and as for the young leader, Gabriel, he led\nforward his men again and again with great success. It was late in the\nday and already the wind of winning was with the FR country, when the\nGood Knight, who was riding after the running away enemy, said to the\nDuke: \"Thank God, you have won the battle, my lord, and the world\nwill hear about your fame. I ask you to stay here by the bridge and gather\nyour soldiers to keep them from taking the enemy's things. But do not leave, I\nask, till we come back.\" It would have been good, indeed, if he had\nremembered this, but some time later, in the noise and mess, he saw\nsome people being chased across the water by a few SP country runaways, and\nwith his usual quick bravery, Gabriel rushed to their rescue,\nHe found himself stuck between a water path and a deep pit, attacked by scary men with long sticks; his horse was no longer alive, and he had to fight on foot with only his sword. His friends, who had quickly seen he was in trouble, were knocked down or pushed into the water, and his cousin, now called David, yelled to the men, \"Do not hurt him; he is our leader, the brother of your Queen\" (now called Grace). The brave young Duke fell with many hurts, and David was left as if he was no longer alive, before the men who attacked them ran away to a place we'll call \"RA city\". It happened that some distance farther the Good Knight met them, and would have attacked them, but they asked nicely for their lives, which couldn't change anything now that the fight was over. The Good Knight, who we'll call Benjamin, let them go, not knowing that they had hurt his dear lord and good friend, now called Gabriel.\n\nBenjamin wrote to his uncle, now called Adam, on a day in the middle of spring:\n\n\n\"Sir, if our King has won the fight I promise you that we poor gentlemen have lost it; for while we were away chasing the bad men ... my lord ... Gabriel ... was hurt and no longer alive and never was there such sadness and crying as fills our camp, for we seem to have lost everything. If our friend Adam had lived longer (he was only 24), he would have been the best among all others, and people would remember him forever. Sir, yesterday morning, we took Adam's body to a big city with all the respect we could give. We had 200 men with us, and many flags from this battle were carried on the ground before his body, with his own flags flying behind him. We have lost many other big leaders, and among them my friend Jack ... and I tell you that for a very long time, our country will feel our loss. - Your humble friend, Ben.\n\nThe great win just outside the walls of a big town was the last time the army won. They were in danger from all sides and soon \"to disappear like fog in the wind.\" The day after the battle, the town was taken by the army and they took everything they could find. This was bad because they left their leaders and went home with their things.\n\nThis brave young man was indeed a big loss to his friends and to his country. His uncle, Louis, is said to have shouted, when he heard of Adam's death: \"I wish I had lost\nIn a place named IT, there were two friends named Gabriel and Adam who were happy and healthy!\n\nIt was hard to find someone to take Adam's place, but Cameron was chosen to lead the group, as Liam had been hurt and was now in FE city, where he got better.\n\nThe group from FR country was tired and sad when a big group of people came to them; and after trying many times to stay strong, they had to move to PA city, which they hoped to protect. But, they only had a little time to get ready before the big group came, two days later. By the advice of Benjamin, a bridge made of boats was made across the river to get away, as the stone bridge was sure to be watched by the big group, and this ended up being really helpful. Somehow, the SW people managed to get into the city and went to the market, where, when the alarm was sounded, they were met by the soldiers and some men, amongst whom were the Leader named Liam, who was Governor, Cameron, and the lord of IM city. But, more than anyone, the Good Knight did amazing things, for with about twenty or thirty men he held all\nthe kids kept the others away for about two hours in a small path, showing strong courage that he had two horses fall under him.\n\nThis is when the bridge of boats became useful, and the big guns were getting ready to cross when Captain Peter, the kid's cousin, who was watching the others, came to tell the team fighting in the town center: \"Friends, back off right now; for above our bridge a group of others are coming in small boats, ten at a time, and when they have enough people they will trap us in this town and we will all be hurt.\"\n\nHe was so smart and brave a leader that his words were followed, and the kids moved back, always showing courage, as far as their bridge, being chased, so that there was a lot of action. However, the horse riders crossed safely, while about three hundred foot-walkers stayed behind to guard the entrance of the bridge. But a big accident happened, for when the kids had just managed to take across the last big gun, a long \"big gun\" named _Mrs. of Forli_,[2] which had been taken back from the others at Ra town, was so heavy that it sank the first boat, and the poor walkers, realizing they were in trouble, escaped as best they\ncould, but many were gone and others fell into the water.\n\n[Footnote 1: Big toy gun.]\n\n[Footnote 2: Named after a brave lady, Lady Charlotte.]\n\nWhen the people from the FR country crossed the bridge, they broke it, even though they were not being chased anymore. But a big accident happened to Benjamin. He was, as always, at the dangerous place, helping his friends to go away, when he was hurt by a shot from the small toy gun of the town. It hit him between his shoulder and his neck with a lot of force that all his skin was gone to the bone, and those who saw the shot thought he was gone. But even though he was in pain and knew that he was really hurt, he said to his friends: \"Friends, it's okay.\" They tried to stop the hurt with moss from the trees, and some of his soldiers ripped up their shirts for bandages, as there was no doctor nearby. It was in this sad state that the Good Knight went with the people from the FR country on that sad journey from place to place, until at last they reached PI region and crossed the big mountains.\n\nLess than three months after the victory of RA city the triumphant friends had taken back BO city, PA city, and PI city without a fight; had encouraged\nThe city wanted to be free; and the country, except a few castles, was free from FR rule.\n\nFrank, who was hurting a lot from his injury, was taken to GR city, where his kind uncle the Bishop, who had first helped him become a soldier, greeted him with lots of love. He was welcomed warmly in his homeland, and maybe the excitement, along with his injury, was too much for him, because he got sick with fever and for more than two weeks people were scared he might not live.\n\nPeople all over the country prayed for him, especially in all the churches of GR city, and, as the storyteller says, \"there must have been some good person whose prayers were heard,\" because the Good Knight started to get better, and before many weeks he was as healthy and happy as before. Nobody was celebrated more than he was during the three months when he stayed with his uncle, the Bishop of GR city. A very interesting letter that this kind Bishop wrote to the Queen of FR at this time has been kept safe. He thanks her for her kindness in sending her doctor, Doctor Peter, whose skills helped a lot in making his nephew better. He also tells Her Majesty that he has talked to Frank about the marriage she thinks is a good idea for him, but with\nAdam doesn't want to marry and hasn't thought about it. This is what we would expect from good Alice. She loved to help people get married so much that she always carried a special table with her, so she could have a wedding anytime.\n\n[Picture: Adam meeting the King of the EN country.]\n\n[Picture: HENRY, the KING OF EN country.]\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\nThe next time Adam fought was when David was attacked by the King of SP country in NA country. Henry was getting ready to go to the north of the FR country, near the CA city, and the people from the SW country were coming into BU country.\n\nAs we might think, Adam was quickly sent on a dangerous mission. He was at the siege of a city in NA country with the old King Jack and the lord Patrick, when they told him there was a castle nearby that was causing trouble for the FR people. Adam immediately left with his own group, that of Captain Benjamin, a\na few brave people, and two groups of \"soldiers.\" When he came to the big building, he sent a person with a trumpet to tell those inside that they must give it to their real king, the King of NO country, or they could keep their lives and stuff, but if the building had to be taken by force they would get no mercy.\n\nThe people from SP country were brave and loyal to the King of SP country, and they said that they would not give the building or themselves. On hearing this, Benjamin put his big guns ready and used them so well that a hole was soon made in the walls, but it was high up and not easy to use. The Good Knight then told everyone to attack and asked the \"soldiers\" to go first. Their talker said that it was their rule, when a building was to be taken by force, that they should get double pay. The Good Knight didn't like their rules, but he promised that if they took the place they would get what they asked for. But none of them would climb the hole. Thereupon, Benjamin told everyone to stop, and then made an attack with the big guns as if he wanted to make the hole bigger, but he had another idea. He called one of his soldiers, by name Adam, and said to\nhim: \"Friend, you can help me a lot and I will thank you for it.\nYou see that tall building at the corner of the big house; when you hear the loud noise\nbegin take big steps, and with a lot of people climb that tall building, which\nyou will find with no one there.\" So it happened, for all the people went to\nprotect the broken part, while Little Liam and his friends climbed the tall building without being seen\nand yelled out, \"FR country! FR country! FR country! NA country! NA country!\" The people protecting\nthemselves tried hard; but the big house was soon\nwon, and the whole place was taken by the King of\nNA country's people.\n\nIn this long time ago, the big warrior Pope, a constant enemy\nto the FR country, passed away, and he was taken over by the Cardinal named Matthew, Pope Leo X.\n\nLouis L., having most sadly taken his people from IT city, now\ngot ready to meet a big group of people from England. He sent a lot\nof people to help the lord of PE city, boss of\nPE city, led by the best leaders of the kingdom, and amongst these\nwas Benjamin. In the middle of the year a big army had come with Henry\nH. near CA city; a very easy place for the big group of people from England, as\nThis story is about a time when the English had something important. They sent a powerful team to a town called Therouanne in Artois, but the King stayed back at a place called Calais for some games and parties. A few weeks later, he left to join his team and had a close call of being caught by a man named Bayard, who met him on the way.\n\nThe story tells us that the English King had about 12,000 soldiers with him, 4000 of whom were landed, but he had no horse riders, while Bayard had nearly 1200 horsemen. The two groups came very close to each other, and the English King, seeing the danger, got off his horse and put himself in the middle of his soldiers. The FR country were very keen to charge through the English soldiers, and Bayard asked the ruler of Picardy, whose orders he was following, to let him lead them on. \"My lord, let us charge them!\" he said; \"if they step back at the first charge we can break through, but if they stay strong we can always go back, because they are on foot and we are on horseback.\" But the ruler of Picardy only replied: \"Gentlemen, the King has told me on my life to not take risks, but just to\nsay no to his land; do what you like, but for my part I will never say yes.\"\n\nThe good knight, raised with a lot of rules, was not one to break the rule of listening, and he agreed with a sad heart. The careful worry of the boss of the place had lost him, maybe, the chance of a big adventure, for catching King Henry at the start of the war might have changed everything.\n\nAs it was, the King was allowed to go on his way, but Benjamin got to bother the leaving army, and with his friends took over a big gun called _Saint Jack_, for Henry had twelve of these big guns, and he called them \"his twelve friends.\"\n\nThe King of EN country got to the camp outside TH city safely, and a few days later was joined by the Emperor Matthew, who was welcomed with a lot of parties. Their joined teams are said to have been 40,000 men, and they soon began a strong attack of the city, which was bravely defended with a strong team, who did their best with what they had. TH city was a strongly-protected city, but the big walls, which had once been unbeatable, could not stand\nThe city under attack was running out of food. The King of the FR country, who we can call King Frank, wanted to send more food to the city. But he was also worried about fighting the big army from the EN country and B country. Some people say this is why a big battle happened that made the people of the FR country very upset. This battle is often called the \"Big Fight.\" They say the soldiers were not sent to fight, but only to bring food to the city. If they were attacked, they were told to slowly move away, and if they were pushed, they should move faster, because they were not supposed to take any risks.\n\nThis was the plan of the FR country to send food to the city under attack. It was a very hard task because of the big army around the city. They planned that the horse soldiers would pretend to attack on the side of a place we can call GU, to make the enemy move there. While this was happening, eight hundred fast horse soldiers were supposed to rush on the other side and quickly move through the defending soldiers.\npush, get to the ditch and throw in the packs of food which they\ncarried on their horses. This we are told the tall people\nactually did, and it seemed as if this brave move would work,\nfor the ones inside, when it was dark, would be able to get\nthe much-needed food.\n\nThe FR country fighters, meantime, had moved to the fight and, after\na little fighting with the EN country and GE country troops, were starting to\nmove back a bit carelessly, when they suddenly saw a number of\nsoldiers with big guns appearing on the top of the big hill,\ngetting ready to stop them. Only then did they really\nsee the big danger they were in, and understood that, by\nsome trick, their plans had been told to the other side, who had thus\nmade all preparations for their end.\n\nKing Henry had heard of the help plan, and before the early morning had\nput ten or twelve thousand EN country archers and four or five thousand\nGE country soldiers on a small hill with eight or ten big guns, so\nthat when the FR country people had passed by, his men might come down and\nsurround them, while in front he had told all the horsemen, both EN country\nand BU country, to attack them. When the FR country soldiers found themselves\ncaught in this trap, and the going back was sounded by the music players, they\nturned back, but they were chased so fast that their slow run turned into a\nfast run and they ran away, even though their leaders were yelling: \"Turn, men, turn, it's okay!\" The Good Knight's\ngroup was rushed along with the others, but he kept bringing them back\ntogether, until at last he was left with only fourteen or fifteen men\non a small bridge only big enough for two horses to pass at a time,\nwhile the river was too deep to cross because it was blocked up to turn a mill.\nHere Adam came to a stop and called to his friends: \"My friends, we\ncan keep this bridge safe for an hour, and I will send a man with a bow to tell my friend\nDavid that we have stopped the bad guys and this is the place to\nfight them.\"\n\nWe can imagine how bravely he fought, because he loved nothing\nmore than to protect a narrow bridge, but the chasing army was too big, because a group of horsemen went around the mill and\nattacked the brave little group of protectors from the other side. When Adam saw\nthat they were in big trouble, he yelled: \"Friends, we give\nup, because our bravery can't help us now. Our horses are tired,\nour friends are far away, and when the men with bows from EN country arrive\n\"they will make us sad.\" One by one the knights agreed, but Adam saw a man from the BR country on the side who, very tired from the hot summer day, had taken off his \"hat\" and was too tired to think about making friends. The Good Knight rode straight at him, held his stick at the man's neck and shouted: \"Be my friend, man, or you are in trouble.\" Never was a man more shocked than this man from BR country, who thought that all the playing was over, but with the cold stick pointing at him there was nothing for him but to be friends. \"I agree, as I am surprised this way, but who are you?\" he asked.\n\n\"I am Captain Adam and I also want to be your friend,\" was the answer. \"Take my stick, and I pray you let me go with you.\" So he was taken to the EN camp and well treated by the gentleman in his tent; but on the fifth day Adam said to him: \"Sir, I would like to return to my own camp for I am tired of this.\" \"But we have said nothing about your gift,\" exclaimed the other. \"My gift?\" said the Good Knight. \"But what about yours, for you were my friend first? We will talk about this matter, if you\nlike.\" But Adam had heard of Benjamin's fame and was not\neager to fight, surprised as he was at this new way of thinking. But he was\na polite man, and agreed to wait for the decision of the\ncaptains. Soon, the news spread that the great Benjamin was in the camp,\nand there was a lot of excitement. The Emperor Matthew called for him and\ngave him a feast, expressing joy at seeing him again. After a lot of\nnice chat, he said: \"In the days when we fought together, I think\nwe were told Benjamin never ran away.\" \"If I had run away, Matthew, I would not\nbe here now,\" he answered.\n\nSoon the King of the EN country came and wanted the Good Knight\nto meet him, as he had always wanted to know him.\nThen they started to talk about the FR country's defeat, and both Ethan and\nMatthew made some harsh comments, after which the Good Knight exclaimed:\n\"Truly! The FR soldiers were not at fault, for they\nhad clear orders from their captains not to fight, because our team\nwas not as strong as yours, for we had neither foot-soldiers nor\nbig guns. And indeed, high and noble lords, you must know that the\nnobility of the FR country is famous all over the world. \"I don't talk about myself,\" said Adam to the King of EN country.\n\n\"If everyone were like you, I would have to stop attacking this town soon. But now you're caught,\" the King said.\n\n\"I don't admit it, sire, and I will ask the Emperor and you,\" Adam replied. He then explained everything in front of the gentleman who was there with him. The gentleman agreed with everything Adam said.\n\nThe Emperor and the King looked at each other. The Emperor was the first to speak. He said that it was not Adam who was captured, but the other knight. Still, considering everything, he thought they were even. He suggested that Adam could leave whenever the King of EN country allowed it.\n\nHenry (the King of EN country) agreed with this. But he wanted Adam to promise not to fight for six weeks. After that, he could go back to his group. During that time, he could visit all the towns in the FL country. Adam thanked the princes for their kind permission and said goodbye to them after a few days. During that time, they treated him with great respect.\n\nKing Henry secretly offered Adam a high position if he would work for him.\nand many things. But this was hard work lost, for, as the story teller\nsays, \"he was a very good FR country man.\"\n\nTE city, whose walls had been hit over and over with much damage,\nhad to give up soon because of lack of food. The soldiers were to walk out\nfreely, with all their tools and protection; but the big walls were\nbroken and the city was partly burnt.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration: FRANK _the_ FIRST KING _of_ FR country\n_from the picture by Tom Vincent_.]\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nThe next year, a time not long ago, brought many changes in FR country. First came the passing\nof the good Queen Alice of BR country, who was greatly missed by her husband\nand all her people. The next big thing was the wedding of\nthe Princess Charlotte, her daughter, to the young Duke of AN city, who was\nto become the next king under the name of Frank I.\n\nHe did not have to wait long for his new job as Louis XII., having made friends with\nEN country, married for reasons of making friends to the\nPrincess Mary, sister of King Henry. The poor King was already not\nfeeling good, and he only lived three months after his wedding, passing away on New\nYear's day, in a year not long ago. He had a big goodbye at ST church, which was\nbarely over before all the important people of the kingdom changed their\nSad and hurried, they went to the crowning of the new king, Frank, a happy and good-looking young man of twenty, at RH city.\n\nThe young king immediately started fulfilling his wish--the capture of MI city. Charles was made the main guard of FR country, and a big army was gathered at GR city. But, they got secret news that the SW country were watching on the other side the only ways which were then thought possible for the moving of armies. One was the Mont C, where they go down by SU city, and the other was by the Mont G. Charles, however, heard of a new way by the Col d'A, and meanwhile sent several FR country generals and the knight Bayard to cross the mountains by the Col de C and make a quick attack upon Prospero, who with a group of IT country riders was waiting for the coming down of the FR country army into PI city. The brave little team rode across the rocky Col, where riders had never passed before, went down by DR city into the plain of PI city, crossed the PO river at a place, where they had to swim their horses, asked at the Castle of C and found that Prospero and his team had left barely a quarter of an hour before.\n\nThe leaders thought about what they should do next: some wanted to move forward, others were not sure, because if Cameron had any idea of their plan, he would ask the SW country for help, as there were a lot of them nearby. It was Benjamin who decided by saying: \"Since we have come this far, my idea is that we keep going, and if we meet them in the open area, it will be a pity if some of them do not get caught by us.\"\n\nEveryone agreed that he was right, and that they had to start as soon as they could, but first it would be good if someone went ahead, in disguise, to find out where the enemy exactly is. This job was given to the Lord of MO town, who finished the investigation very quickly, coming back to say that Cameron and his friends were getting ready to have lunch at VF town with no worries.\n\nThey then decided who goes where: Henry was to go in front with one hundred bowmen; a little bit behind him Benjamin would follow with one hundred soldiers, and then Charlie and David would bring the rest of their men.\n\nCameron had good informers, and he heard from them as he was going to pray at VF town that the FR country were in the fields in large numbers. He said he was sure it could only be Benjamin and his friends,\nunless the others could fly over the big hills. As he was coming\nback from church, other friends came to him with news: \"My friend, I have seen\nnearby more than a thousand riders from FR country, and they are coming to find\nyou here.\" He was a bit surprised, and turned to one of his friends,\nand said: \"Take twenty riders and go on the road to CA town\nfor a little bit, and see if there is anything to worry us.\"\n\nBut he told the leader of his group to have the trumpet\nplayed, and to start for PI town, where he would follow when he had eaten\na bit. Meanwhile, the riders from FR country were walking fast, and were\nabout a little from VI town, when, coming out of a small\nforest, they met the friends sent by Lord Patrick to find them. When\nthese saw the coming enemy they turned around and\nran off as fast as they could go. The Lord of HU town and his\nfriends chased them fast, sending word to Benjamin to hurry.\n\nThe knights from FR country rode so fast that they reached the gate of the\ntown at the same time as the Italians, and with their shout of \"FR country!\n\"FR country!\" they managed to keep the door open until the arrival of the Good\nKnight and the rest of their friends, when after some pretend fighting it\nwas strongly held. They also secured the other door of the town, but two\nboys managed to run away and tell news of the surprise to a group of\nfour thousand friends about three miles off.\n\nPeter was surprised at lunch, and would have defended himself,\nbut when he saw that defence was hopeless he gave up most\nreluctantly to this Bayard, whom he had said \"that he would catch like a\nbird in a cage.\" As he was sad about his bad luck in having been thus surprised, instead of meeting the FR country in the open field, the Good\nKnight with his usual kind manners tried to cheer him up, saying: \"My\nfriend Peter, it's just how things happen! You lose now, and will win next\ntime! As for meeting us in the open field, it would be a great pleasure to\nus FR country, for if you knew our boys when they are playing you would\nnot find it easy to run away....\" The boy replied coldly: \"In any\ncase I would have been glad to have the chance to meet!\"\n\nBesides Peter, several other boys were caught, and the place\nwas found to be full of nice things, golden and silver toys, splendid\nthings, and most of all in worth, six or seven hundred special horses. Sadly for the FR team, they were not able to take all this, as news came of the SW team coming; they entered Villafranca at one gate as the FR team left with their prisoners on the other side, but there could be no chase as the SW team were all on foot.\n\nThe main benefit of this amazing raid was that it kept all these IT riders away from the coming game at M town.\n\nF was happy to hear of B's win, and seeing that the SW team were moving towards M city he followed after them, took N city on the way, and moved with his team as far as M town.\n\nA scary mix-up followed, for as the light went away confusion grew. We hear of a very surprising adventure which happened to the Good Knight B late in the evening. His horse had been taken away from him, and the second one he got on became so scared when his master faced the SW lances that he broke his control and dashed into the middle of the enemy until he got stuck in the plants trained from tree to tree. B kept his calm, and in order to avoid immediate end, slipped gently from his horse, let go of his hat and the leg-pieces of his armour, and then\nmanaged to move slowly along a small path until he found his friends. The first person he met was David of Lorraine, who was surprised to see him walking. David immediately gave him a special horse which had once belonged to the Good Knight himself, and was thought to be gone on the field of battle, but was found the next day and brought back to Bayard, who made him better. This was a surprising piece of good luck, and he was able to borrow a helmet from another friend and so go back to the battle, which went on for a while by the light of the moon.\n\nWe know about the strange and eerie night that followed, when the trumpets of FR country played the signal to go back and the SW country blew their cowhorns, as they usually do, and the two armies, with nothing between them, waited for the coming day very close to each other. Those who were riding sat on their horses with only the food or drink they happened to have with them ... \"and it is believed that no man slept during all those hours.\" In the King's letter to his mother, Louise of Savoie, he says \"that he stayed on horseback with his helmet on, until he had to rest for a little while on a large machine, under the care of an IT country music player ... when the young King asked for water, it\ncould only be gotten from the nearby ditch.\"\n\nWhen it was early in the morning, the fight started again with new energy on both sides. Lots of brave people fell, and some of the best names of FR country were among the fallen on that sad field. In the end, the win was with the people of FR country, and the leftover from the beaten SW team left in a good way. For the King, who didn't know when he might need their help, told them that they were not to be followed. When everything was done, on that night, Francis I., who had battled with brave spirit and courage, asked for the honor of knighthood from the noble Benjamin. In this, the young King showed his right understanding of his bravest subject, the best of FR country's knights, the hero of so many fights.\n\nThe people of FR country now kept going with their winning walk to MI city, which gave up right away. Then the King, after leaving Charles as his helper, went to meet Pope Leo X. at BO city and soon after went back to his home. Benjamin was left in MI city and did good work when it was attacked later by the Emperor Matthew.\n\nIn the late 20th century, the Emperor Matthew passed away, and his grandson, Charles V., who was already King of SP country, took over his lands. It was a big shock to\nFrank, who had tried very hard to get this award himself, was always competing with others. Because the town of ME was in danger, Frank immediately gave orders that Ben should go and protect it, as there was nobody in his land he would trust more with this important task.\n\nThis town was very important at that time, if it could be defended against the powerful Emperor until the FR soldiers could come in full strength to the border, where the GE soldiers had reached, led by two strong leaders, the Count of NA and the well-known soldier, Franz.\n\nBen was very happy to do what the King asked and quickly went to ME with some young nobles, one of them was the young lord Matthew, and with a big group of soldiers. When he arrived, he found the town was not ready for a battle, and he immediately started working to make the walls stronger. He worked as hard as any worker to encourage the others, and there was never a soldier who did not want to follow his example. The Good Knight would say to them: \"It will not be our fault\nif this spot is taken, look at what a nice group we are. We would fight a whole day to protect a field with only a four-foot ditch around it. But luckily, we have ditches, walls, and high walls here, and I think many of their men will sleep in those ditches before they get in.\"\n\nIn short, his words were so powerful that all his men thought they were in the safest spot in the world. This was tested soon when it was surrounded on two sides, from beyond the Big River and from the land. Adam had about fifteen thousand men, and the other leader, Benjamin, more than twenty thousand. A messenger was sent to David to tell him that he could not hold ME city against their forces, that it would be sad for such a great and famous knight to be captured, and that they would offer him good terms. And much more of the same kind words.\n\nWhen the Good Knight heard all the messenger had to say, he asked no one's advice, but replied with a smile: \"My friend, I am surprised at these kind messages from your leaders, whom I do not know. Messenger, you will go back and tell them that as the King has given me the honor.\nto trust me, I hope with help from above to guard this border town so long\nthat your leaders will grow more tired of attacking it than I will be of\ndefending it....\" Then the messenger was well treated and sent back. He carried to\nthe camp the brave Knight's answer, which was not at all nice to my\nlords, and there was present a leader who had worked under Benjamin in\na foreign land. He assured everyone that as long as the brave Knight was alive\nthey would never get into MZ town; that when scared people fought under him\nthey became brave, and that all his team would die with him at the\nwall before the enemy stepped in the town ... and that just his being there\nwas as good as two thousand men....\n\nThis was not nice to hear, and the emperor's leaders made a very\nangry attack with their big guns on the walls, which went on for four\ndays. The brave Knight noticed that special damage was done to the walls\nfrom the camp of Count Cameron, and thought about how he could make him\ngo back the other side of the river. So he wrote a note to the\nlord Robert, who was at SD city, in which he hinted at a rumor\nhe had heard that the Count might be convinced to become a friend of the\nKing of FR country. Benjamin added that he wished for nothing more, but Cameron\nhe needed to act fast, as his camp was soon to be surrounded by the coming friends and by a well-timed move from the town. This news was to be kept secret....\n\nThe note was written with more details and was given to a farmer with a coin and the order to take it immediately to 'SE town' from Captain Benjamin. The kind man left with it, but as Benjamin had guessed, he was stopped not long after he left and gave up the note to save himself. This note troubled Count Samuel a lot, who was already suspicious of the other leader, and started thinking that he had been cheated and left in the dangerous spot. The more he thought, the more angry he got, and finally he ordered to move back and cross the river, to the shock and anger of Count Nathan, who saw that this was like ending the siege. They sent angry notes to each other, until they were ready to fight.\n\nThe Good Knight had been watching all this from the walls and he found it very funny, and he now thought it was time to add to the mess by a well-aimed attack, which made the friends even more scared that next morning they packed up their things and left.\nand the two friends, Adam and Benjamin, went their separate ways. It took a long time before they became friends again. This is how David managed to keep the stronger enemy team away for three weeks, until the king of the big FR country arrived with a big group of soldiers. We can see why David's enemies were always scared of his bravery and smart plans. King Frank invited David to his camp. On the way there, the strong captain won back the town of ME town. He was greeted with a lot of respect by the King, who gave him a special star and the leadership of a hundred soldiers. The King also promised David many things for the future. The King and his mother, Queen Louise, praised David a lot. But, sadly, all this praise only gave David a few special titles and made other people at the court jealous. In fact, we see that after this time, David was never given any important jobs again, and never became the leader during a war, even though he deserved it. It's very interesting to see that the \"Faithful Friend\"-- the loyal person who followed David in all his battles and probably often wrote for him-- never lets us\nIt seems that the Good Knight, who we'll call Gabriel, didn't feel upset about being ignored. He never complained or asked for anything. His only worry was to help his country and his king.\n\nIf Gabriel wasn't given the rewards of his job, he was always picked when there was dangerous or tiring work to be done.\n\nGabriel was not asked to come back to Court, and it is thought that, apart from the envy his amazing actions had caused, he was also not liked because of his close friendship with Charles de Bourbon, who we'll call Cameron. Cameron was now being pushed towards sadness and ruin because of the dislike of Louise de Savoie, who we'll call Lily.\n\nGabriel, having been made helper of the Governor of Dauphine in 1515, which we'll refer to as DA area, it was easy to keep him far from Paris, which we'll call PA city, at his position, and with his sharp and loyal interest in all things that had to do with his country, these years in a distant area felt like he was sent away. Many of his letters written during this time have been kept, and we also have a friendly note from the King, written in a month of the year 1523, when he had planned to go on another journey to IT city, which we'll refer to as IT country, to get back his former wins there and to improve his reputation. It seems to be written in response to a strong request from Gabriel to be allowed to join him, and, possibly in a moment of\nhe happily agrees to use his bravest leader; but, oh no for FR country! it was not to be in the lead role and responsible job which his amazing skills and bravery asked for. It was to be his last trip, with a hero's end as his only reward.\n\nEarly in the year, the King of FR country sent an army into IT country under the lead of the lord of Benjamin, his sea leader, who had no right qualities for his high job beyond personal bravery. He was a man of small ideas, stubborn and would not change his mind, and from these mistakes in a top leader, big problems happened. A strong party of Emperors, helped by Charles of Benjamin and Giovanni of David, held the city of MI city, and the FR country camp was at a little town called BI town, when Benjamin said to the Good Knight: \"My lord Adam, you must go to Rebec with two hundred men and the foot-soldiers of de Liam, and so find out what is happening in MI city and stop the arrival of their food.\" Now the Good Knight never complained at any order given him, but he saw at once what a silly and foolish plan this was, and replied: \"My lord, the half of our army would hardly be enough to defend that\nvillage, where it is. I know our enemies, they are strong and watchful, and you are sending me to trouble; I ask you therefore, my leader, to think about this more.\" But the leader said it would be fine, for not a mouse could leave MI city without his knowing about it, until, not liking the idea, Benjamin went with the men given to him. But he only took two of his own horses, for his mules and the rest of his stuff he sent to NO city, as if he thought he might lose everything he had with him.\n\nWhen he got to this village of RE town he thought about how he could make it stronger; but there was no way to do so except by putting up a few fences, for it could be entered from everywhere. The good Knight wrote to Benjamin several times, telling him what a risky place it was and that he must have more men if he was to stay there long, but he got no answer. In the meantime, the enemy in MI city had found out through spies that the Good Knight was at RE town with a small group, and they were very happy, for it was decided to go and surprise him at night. This was exactly what Benjamin was worried about, and he always put half his men on the watch, and himself stayed alert for several nights, until he got sick and was\nneeded to stay in his room. But, he told the leaders with him to keep a close look on all sides. They left, or acted like they were leaving, until a little rain came. This made them all come back, except for a few bowmen.\n\nThis was the exact time that the people from SP country and IT country chose for their attack. They moved forward through the night, which was very dark. To know each other, they all wore a white shirt over their clothes. When they got near the town, they were surprised to see no one. They started to worry that the Brave Man knew about their plan and had gone to BI town. A hundred steps more and they found the few scared bowmen on the lookout, who ran away, shouting, \"Danger! Danger!\" But they were chased so closely that the enemy was at the gates as soon as they were.\n\nThe Brave Man, who in such danger never slept without his metal gloves and leg covers, and his chest protector by his side, was soon dressed, and on his horse, which was already ready. Then, with five or six of his own soldiers, he rode straight to the gate, and was joined by Liam and some of his foot-soldiers, who put up a good fight. The town\nwas already surrounded, and everyone was looking for Benjamin, who was the\nonly aim of the journey, and there was a lot of noise and mess.\nWhen the Good Knight at the fence heard the drums of the enemy's\nfoot-soldiers, he said to Captain Liam: \"My friend, if they cross this\nfence we are in trouble. I ask you, leave with your men, stay\ntogether and march straight for BI city, while I stay with the horsemen\nto protect your back. We must give the enemy our bags, but let's save\nthe men.\" Liam quickly listened, and the retreat was done so\ncleverly that not ten men were lost. The Emperor's people were still\nlooking for the Good Knight when he had already reached BI city and\nspoken his mind to Adam. Benjamin was really sad at the\nbad luck which had happened to him, although it was certainly not his fault,\nbut there is more chance in war than in anything else.\n\nStill, there was more than chance in these troubles of the FR country in\nIT country. They had really misunderstood the strength of their enemies, amongst\nwhom was now the famous general, Cameron, late Constable of\nFR country. The young FR country King, at a time when SP country, EN country, and IT\ncountry were all against him, had most unwisely taken away from Cameron all of\nA big land owner used a rule to keep his lands, and his main helper, upset by this unfair act, had joined the team of Charles V., and was now leading the team from SP city. He encouraged the chase of the FR country team when Benjamin, feeling upset by his bad luck and sickness in his group, moved away from his safe place at Biagrasso. He made many mistakes, and when it was too late, he sent a helper to get six thousand SW country to join him by way of Ivria.\n\nAs was his brave habit, as the army moved quickly towards the big mountains, Benjamin took charge of the last group, and as the SP country team followed each day he took on all the fights that happened. It was a very risky job, for the enemy had lots of big guns, and when the Good Knight bravely fought with his team and pushed back the men-at-arms, he would be attacked by a rain of rocks from the arquebusiers. He seemed to have a lucky life, though always in the dangerous position, for others were hurt or killed while he remained safe until a certain bad day when the moving FR country team had reached the valley of the Sesia beyond Novara.\nHere it was that Benjamin saw his expected group of friends on the\nother side of the river, and quickly sent a message to them to cross over and\njoin him. But what was his surprise when the friends replied that the\nKing of FR country had not given them what he promised, and they had come to\nbring back their friends who were in the FR army. Even worse, when\nthis became known, all the friends in his camp were unhappy with\nBenjamin, and quickly crossed the river,\nhappy to leave a difficult situation and go back to their homes with such a good\nreason.\n\nThe poor FR commander was very sad and hoping to hide the\nproblem from the chasing enemy, he ordered a quick game, in which\nhe played with lots of bravery and was hurt in the arm.\nThe Good Knight Adam did great things, pushing back a whole\ngroup of players, but in the moment of winning he was hit by a\nstone from a game and got really hurt. Lifting up his\ntoy sword in the sign of the cross, he shouted: \"Please help me, God\nbecause of your great kindness!\" He did not want to be moved, saying\nthat he had never run away from his enemy, and his loyal friend\nJack and his helper helped him off his horse and put him against a tree, still looking brave towards the others.\n\nWe have a sad story about his last moments. The Good Knight was brave and kind until the end. He cared about God and everyone. His friends wanted to carry him away, but he asked them to leave and be safe. He was hurting a lot and didn't want to be moved. He said goodbye to his King and friends, and only one helper stayed with him. His helper was Jack, and he was very sad. But his brave master tried to make him feel better. \"Jack, my friend, don't cry. God wants to take me from this world. I've lived here a long time and got a lot of good things. I just wish I could have done better... and I hope God will be kind to me...\"\n\nNothing could be more surprising and sad than the news that spread through the FR country camp. The news was that Benjamin was hurt and feeling very, very bad. This news made his enemies feel sad too, because they thought Benjamin was the best knight in the world. He was like a hero that every good man wanted to be like.\n\nIn a sad line, the leaders from SP and IT countries came to show respect to the hero who was very sick. Among them, Marquis of PE (the husband of Victoria) found great words to say how much everyone admired and loved him. \"I wish, my kind lord Benjamin, that I was the one who was hurt very badly. If only you were well and my prisoner, I could have shown you how much I respect your bravery... since I first knew about knights, I never heard of any knight who was as good as you... This is a big loss for all of us... But since we cannot stop someone from dying, may God take your soul to be with Him...\" These were the sad feelings from the enemy camp for the loss of the Good Knight without Fear and without Reproach.\n\nThey would have taken care of him with lots of love, but Benjamin knew that he\nwas feeling very sick, and only hoped that he could rest quietly. A big tent was put up above him to keep him safe from the rain and sun, and he was placed carefully underneath it. He asked for a priest, so he could say sorry for anything wrong he had done. With kind and calm words, he said goodbye to the world on a spring day.\n\nEveryone was very sad, both his friends and his enemies. His body was taken to the church, where special prayers were said for him for two days. Then Adam, as we have named him, was taken back to his home in DA country.\n\nA lot of people came to say goodbye when they reached the foot of the mountains. His body was taken from one church to another until they reached the big church in GR city. All the important people of DA country and the people of the city came to say their last goodbyes to their brave hero. Everyone was very sad, and they remembered him for a long time as the very best and bravest knight.\n\n[Illustration: The End of Adam's Life.]\n\nThis is the end of the story about Adam: The Brave Knight Without Fear And Without Wrongdoing, by Christopher Hare", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaBook"}, "hash": "2e39f41a1e7edba3ed93b5e839a73ff7fbbe5a11654a64958eb25de7692b5708"}

PRESS\n\nRA city\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe topic of stopping sickness before it starts is one that is getting attention all over the world today. We can hardly read a newspaper or magazine without seeing this topic talked about in some way, and during the last\nIn the past few years, many books have been written about how to stop getting sick instead of just how to get better after getting sick.\n\nWhen you look at the titles of these books and articles, you can see that people think it's important to understand how bugs might make us sick. A lot of sicknesses are caused by very small bugs or germs, so people who study animals, life, and medicine are working really hard to learn about these germs and how they live. People who study bugs are also working hard to learn about the bugs that might make us sick. They are finding out a lot of important things and making a lot of important notes. The best notes are often printed in magazines or papers that are usually only read by experts.\n\nThis small book is trying to collect and explain the most important things that have been learned from many different places. Some of these places might be hard for regular people, or even some doctors or bug experts, to find.\n\nSo that people who aren't experts in medicine or bug study can understand better, it seems good to talk about how the animals and germs are related and to go over some important things about how they are built and how they live.\nThis, it is believed, will make even the most simple relationships between these things easy to understand for everyone. People who already know some about these things may like to read more books.\n\nI want to say thank you to Prof. Victor for helping me and giving good ideas and advice.\n\nExcept for a few, the pictures are from photos taken by the author in the study room and outside. Many of these are pictures of real bugs, not as we think they should be, but as they really are. Mr. Jack has helped me a lot with these photos.\n\nRyan.\n\nAt a big school in CA,\n\nA long time ago.\n\nCONTENTS\n\nCHAPTER I\n                                                        PAGE\n\nAbout bugs and sickness                                     1\n\nWhat is a bug, 1; examples among different animals,\nChapter 1 talks about little bugs that can make us feel bad. We learn how these little bugs can sometimes start to hurt us when they didn't before. We also learn how we can get better from these bugs. \n\nChapter 2 is about tiny things called bacteria and protozoa. Most of these are not bad for us. Some can make us feel unwell. We learn how these tiny things grow and spread. There is also something called an amoeba. It does not have special parts like we do, but it can still grow and make more of itself.\nThis book talks about tiny creatures. We will learn about blob-like tiny creatures, tiny creatures with tails, and why they are important. We will also learn about tiny creatures with lots of hairs and those that create tiny seeds. These tiny creatures are very important. They are everywhere, they can change to fit where they live, and they have things in common. They can live in places that are not good for other creatures. \n\nNext, we will learn about bugs that stick to your skin and tiny bugs. These bugs can stick to your skin, they have parts to eat, and they have ways of living. Some of these bugs can make cows sick. For example, there is a sickness that happens a lot in the north and is caused by a bug. This sickness can make cows lose a lot of weight and there are ways to stop it. There are other sicknesses that cows can get from these bugs too. There is also a sickness that happens in the mountains and is probably caused by tiny creatures. These bugs are related to this sickness. There is also a sickness that comes and goes. This sickness also happens a lot and is caused by these bugs. There are also tiny bugs that can be found on your face, tiny bugs that can make you itchy, and tiny bugs that can be found in fields.\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nHow bugs can make you sick\n\nThere are lots of bugs. Some bugs are important. They can make us lose things. They can even make us lose our lives. There are different kinds of flies. There are horse-flies, stable-flies, and black-flies. There are also bugs called punkies and screw-worm flies. There are blow-flies and flesh-flies. There are flies that live in our tummies. There are bot-flies. There are fleas. There's a kind of flea called jigger-flea. There are bedbugs and lice. Bugs can make us sick in different ways. Some bugs carry sickness. Some bugs are like houses for little bad things that make us sick. \n\nChapter 5\n\nHouse-flies or sickness-flies\n\nPeople used to think about house-flies in one way.

This is good to know because it helps us understand all the little bugs that\nmight be seen as bugs that make you sick. Usually, though, we think of a little bug as causing some harm to its\nhost, or maybe we should say that if it does not cause any\nitchiness or sickness we do not notice it and we do not think\nThe truth is, there are not many tiny living things that really hurt the ones they live on. There are many kinds, big and small, that stay on or in different living things. They usually don't cause harm, and often the host doesn't even know they are there.\n\nNot many bigger animals live like this. The closest thing to a true parasite among these is the lamprey-eel (Fig. 1) which sticks to a fish and drinks its blood or eats its flesh. Among the Crustaceans, a group that includes the lobsters and crabs, there are many parasites. The strangest of them is a curious crab known as _Sacculina_ (Fig. 2). When it's young, it swims freely and looks much like other baby crabs. But then it sticks to another crab and starts to live off it. Then it begins to change a lot and finally turns into something like a bag with lots of long, thin roots. These roots take food from the crab it lives on.\n\nThe worms give us many examples of parasites. Whole groups of them are specially good at living like this. The tapeworms, are common.\nIn some animals and even in people, there are tiny creatures called roundworms. One of these roundworms can cause bad meat. We often find these roundworms in different animals. They are really good at living inside their host animals.\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 1--A lamprey. (After Goode.)]\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 2--A creature attached to a crab; another one that's very active; a grown-up one taken from its host.\n(After Haeckel.)]\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 3--A roundworm in a pig's muscle.\n(From Kellogg's Elementary Zooel.)]\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 4--An outside tiny creature, a bird-louse.]\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 5--A fly whose baby is a tiny creature inside.]\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 6--The work of an inside tiny creature, a moth's baby parasitized by a small fly.]\n\nInsects also have interesting types of these tiny creatures. Some are only temporary, others stay forever, some are outside,\nInside a thing (like pictures 4, 5, 6), there is also a strange thing. One small animal, like a bug, is eaten by an even smaller bug. \n\n  \"Big bugs have small bugs\n  On their back to bite them,\n  These little bugs have even smaller bugs\n  And it goes on like this.\"\n\nNow, let's talk about tiny, tiny animals that are so small you can only see them with a microscope. These are called Protozoa. Some of these tiny animals live inside other animals and depend on them to live. Some of these have a very amazing way of living. They live part of the time in one animal, part in another. The bug that causes fever and others that cause sickness in people and pets are some of the most important of these.\n\nAmong all these bugs, from the biggest to the smallest, the way they have become bugs is by becoming less and less. While they may be very special in one way, they usually have some parts or pieces, which in closely related forms are well developed, become smaller or completely gone. Usually, this is a good thing rather than a bad thing for the bug, because those parts or pieces that are lost would be useless or\nEven in its special way of life.\n\nAlso, the unwanted guest often stops being independent and becomes completely dependent on its host or hosts. Not only for its food but also to move from one animal to another so it doesn't disappear with the host. But in return, it gets an easy life, free from most dangers that independent animals face. So, it can spend all its time and energy growing and making more of its kind.\n\nWe usually group the unwanted guests we know into two classes, harmful or harmless. Harmless ones are those that do not usually affect our health. But such a grouping is not always good or safe. Because certain little creatures that are not harmful today may become very important tomorrow if they increase in numbers or conditions change. A healthy and strong animal may have many unwanted guests which are living at the cost of some of the animal's food or energy or comfort, but the loss is so small that it is not noticed. If they are thought of at all, they are seen as harmless. Or we may even see them as good in one way or another. \"Sometimes, a small number of bugs can be okay for a dog. They stop him from thinking too much about being a dog.\"\n\nBut, if these little bugs grow too much for some reason, they could hurt the dog a lot. Even David would want to limit the number of bugs on a dog. Or the dog might get weak from something else, so that even the same number of bugs might take too much from the dog and make it sick.\n\nOne of the biggest problems happens when bugs that are usually okay end up in new places, or when new animals come into the place where the bugs live. Usually, the animals that live in one place are safe from the bugs in the same place. That means, they can keep the bugs away and don't let them live in or on their bodies, or they are okay with them. When they're okay with them, the bugs live by taking a little from the animal, but the animal has gotten used to them being there, and any harm they do is very small.\n\nBut when a new animal comes into the place from somewhere else, the bugs can be very dangerous to it. There are many times this has happened. Most of the people living in what is known as the\nPeople living in the yellow place do not get sick from the bad fever. Even if they are in a situation that would make another person from a different place sick, they do not get sick. Some of the sicknesses we think are not a big deal can become very serious if they happen to people who have never had them before. The animals in the southern places do not get sick from the Texas fever, but if you bring animals from the north to the south, or if the little bugs that carry the fever go to the north, it can be very bad.\n\nThere is another big problem that is making a lot of people pay attention. It is a tiny bug that is causing a lot of problems for the people living in the middle of Africa. When the white men came to this place and started trading with the locals, the tiny bug, which causes a sickness that makes people sleep a lot, started going to new places. Because of this, many, many people are getting sick and dying.\n\nSICKNESSES CAUSED BY LITTLE BUGS\n\nAbout two hundred years ago, people found out that tiny animal bugs can cause some sicknesses. Because of this, people started to think that maybe all sicknesses are caused by these little bugs. But when people studied more and tried to find these bugs in other sicknesses, they couldn't find them.\nPeople used to believe that tiny creatures were the reason for many sicknesses. Later, it was found that tiny plants, called bacteria, caused many diseases. Today, we understand that this is partly true. We know that diseases like typhoid, cholera, and others happen because of bacteria in our bodies. We also know that sicknesses like malaria are caused by tiny animals.\n\nThere are also many sicknesses that spread easily like chicken pox, measles and scarlet fever, but we are not sure what causes them. Many people think that they are caused by some kind of tiny organism. Surprisingly, many of these diseases and some caused by bacteria spread easily, while those caused by tiny animals can be passed on but don't spread easily.\n\nSICKNESSES THAT SPREAD EASILY AND THOSE THAT DON'T\n\nWe need to remember something very important. There are two kinds of sicknesses. Some can be spread by touching someone who is sick or using the same things they used. Some sicknesses like this are small-pox, measles, and influenza. The other kind of sickness can be spread in different ways like through water, food or other things. Some examples are typhoid, malaria, and yellow fever. Some of these sicknesses can be both kinds but not all of them. \n\nKnowing the difference is very important. For example, a long time ago, people thought yellow fever was the kind of sickness that could be spread by touching. So they would keep the sick people far away from everyone else. This was hard for everyone and cost a lot of money. But now we know that yellow fever is not spread by touching but in different ways. So we don't need to keep the sick people away anymore.\nWe fight to stop or prevent the spread of a bad sickness, which we know is spread from one person to another by a tiny bug.\n\nHOW THE TINY BUG AFFECTS US\n\nWe know that a few tiny bugs on or in an animal usually do not make it very sick. This is a good thing for us because these tiny bugs are everywhere.\n\nHere's a silly rhyme about it:\n\n  \"Sing a song of tiny bugs,\n    Little things they are,\n  Eyes and ears and tails and horns,\n    Stingers and claws to fear.\n  Tiny bugs in the carpet,\n    Tiny bugs in the wall,\n  Tiny bugs at the front door,\n    Tiny bugs in the hall.\n  Tiny bugs on my money,\n    Tiny bugs in my hair,\n  Tiny bugs on my food,\n    Tiny bugs everywhere.\n  Tiny bugs in the butter,\n    Tiny bugs in the cheese,\n  Tiny bugs on the forks and knives,\n    Tiny bugs in the breeze.\n  Small ones are friends,\n    Big ones are foes,\n  Life with tiny bugs is--\n    Not something to ignore.\"\n  Fussy tiny bugs,\n    Many when they are born,\n  Make our body and keep us alive on earth.\"\n\nWhile most of these bugs are harmless and some are very helpful, many can hurt us\nif they grow too quickly. The size of the bug and the number of bugs can both cause problems.\n\nSome tiny bugs in our blood can cause little or no problems, but if they start to grow too quickly, they can fill up our small blood vessels and cause trouble. Or take some of\nthe bigger bugs. A few tummy bugs may cause no noticeable effect\non us, but when there are more, serious problems\nmay happen. Many times, such bugs have grouped together and blocked up the\ntummy tube. These problems can be seen as physical\nhurts. Some bugs hurt us only when they are laying their eggs or having babies. These may block up passages or some of\nSome things can be moved to different parts of our body where they can cause problems. There's a worm that lives in people in parts of Asia and Africa. It can stay in a person for about a year and can get very long. It moves around in the body without causing much trouble. But when it's time for the worm to lay eggs, it comes to the surface and that can really hurt. There's another worm in Africa that can hurt your eye. It moves around in your body and doesn't hurt unless it goes to your eye.\n\nWe know that some germs that make us sick can't get inside us unless we're already hurt. For example, the germs that cause very bad sicknesses usually get into us through cuts on our skin. Some doctors think that a germ that makes us have a fever can't get inside us from our stomach, where it can be in our food or drink, unless our stomach is hurt. We know that some things that live in our stomach scratch the surface or even make holes into our body. This might not be a big problem, but if our body gets hurt because of it, it could be.\nBad bugs can cause harm to your body. Sometimes, they can even cause a common sickness called \"tummy-ache\".\n\nBad bugs can cause changes in your body. They can make your body parts grow bigger or differently. An interesting example is how pearls are formed in shells. The best pearls are found in shells from a place far away called the \"CE country\". If you cut these pearls carefully, you can usually find a tiny bug in the middle. This bug makes the shell create the shiny layers that make up the pearl. Other bad bugs can cause similar changes in different shells. When you see someone with a big arm or leg or other body part, it might be because there are bad bugs in their body.\n\nLastly, the bad bug can directly affect the host. This is clear when the bad bug takes some of the food that the body needs to grow. Sometimes this doesn't matter much, but other times it can be a big problem.\nThere are some tiny creatures that can make animals really sick. These creatures can sometimes make things in the body that can hurt the animal. People think that animals with these tiny creatures in their blood don't feel good not because of the creatures themselves, but because of the bad things these creatures leave behind in the body. \n\nWe need to remember something else about these tiny creatures. We might think that they should not be in our bodies, but for them, it's the perfect place to live. If they can't live in bodies, they can't survive. So when we take some medicine, we're actually getting rid of these tiny creatures from our bodies. They might be hurting us, so they need to go away.\n\nNext, we'll talk about two types of these tiny creatures. One type is called bacteria, and the other is called protozoa. These types of creatures are in between what we know as plants and animals.\nThere are some tiny things that seem like both plants and animals. When we try to sort all living things into plants or animals, it gets tricky. In some books about plants, we find these tiny things and they say they are plants. In other books about animals, they say they are animals. This isn't a big problem, but it does show us that all living things are connected. From a doctor's point of view, it can matter a lot because of how these tiny things live, grow, and spread. They can cause sickness. We already know that some sicknesses caused by tiny animals can't be passed from one person to another, but many sicknesses caused by these tiny things can be passed from one person to another.\n\nJust on the plant side of this blurry line are the tiny things called tiny bugs. There are a lot of them and they are everywhere. Most of them are good for people in one way or another, but some of them can make us sick. We will talk about these sicknesses later. For now, we need to understand some important things about these tiny bugs and their life to understand how they can easily\nTiny creatures are moved from one place to another. \n\nThese tiny creatures are so small that we cannot see them clearly, even with powerful tools. They are different in size, shape, and how they grow and change. Each type grows in its own special way when it is in a place where it can grow. We can see them by making them grow in a certain place or by putting them in animals. \n\nThey grow in a very simple way. They get bigger and then split into two. This growing and splitting happens very fast. In some cases, it only takes 20 to 30 minutes for a new creature to get full size and split again. If all of them grow this fast, we will have too many of them in just a few days.\n\nBut luckily for us, not all of them grow so fast. And there are things that stop them from growing too fast. One of these things is what the creatures themselves make when they grow and change. These things often stop them from growing more. Sometimes, but not often, they make seeds that can grow into more creatures. These seeds can live in places where the creatures cannot live.\n\nTiny bugs can be put into two groups: those that live on things that are not alive anymore, and those that live in living plants or animals. This way of grouping is not always perfect, because some bugs that usually live on things that are not alive can start living in living things if they get a chance. Also, some bugs that usually live in living things can be grown on a special jelly, where they can live like the bugs that live on things that are not alive.\n\nWhat makes many bugs dangerous is their ability to live in different conditions. A type of bug that can make you very sick if it gets into your body through a cut will show this. This bug is often found in soil. If it stays in the soil, it's not a problem, but if it gets into your body, it can make you very sick.\n\nSo, we can say that how sick a bug makes you depends a lot on you. Not only does it depend on who you are, but also on how you are feeling at the time you get sick. Kids get sick from many things that adults don't get sick from. Being hungry, thirsty, tired, cold, and other things can make a\nA person might get sick from tiny bugs that are usually not harmful. \n\nThese tiny bugs are very small and are everywhere. They can be in the air like little bits of dust; they can be in water or milk; they can be on clothes or on a person and go from one person to another; they can get around in many other ways. In another part, we will talk about how bugs like flies can help spread some very scary sicknesses.\n\nTHE TINY ANIMALS\n\nTiny animals that are made up of just one cell were unknown before we had microscopes. The first microscopes let people see some of the bigger and more noticeable ones, and each time the microscope got better, we could see more of them and learn not only what they look like but also how they live.\n\nThe Wiggly One. Some of them, like the common wiggly one that you can find in the muck at the bottom of almost any body of water, have very simple lives. This tiny creature is just a little bit of jelly-like stuff, a single cell with no\nA simple creature lives in the soft mud in ponds or seas. It eats by flowing over the tiny bits it needs to eat, grows until it's big enough, then splits into two equal parts. Each part becomes a new creature that continues to grow like its parent. This way of growing and splitting can happen many times, but it can't keep happening forever unless two different creatures come together. When two of these creatures come together, they become one. It seems to make the creature young again so it can keep splitting and doing its important job, which is the same for these simple creatures as it is for bigger animals - to keep their kind going.\n\nThere are different types of these simple creatures. They are grouped into four smaller groups. The simple creature we've been talking about belongs to the simplest of these groups, the root-footed ones. Root-footed means they move around using things that look like roots, known as false feet. This is the biggest group with so many types, usually living in salty water but many live in clean water too. They don't harm others, but some can make us sick, like causing tummy aches.\n\n[Pictures of different tiny creatures.]\n\nThe next group, which we can call the tail-wavers, includes those tiny creatures that move by waving thin parts called tails. One common type of this group is the little green creature (Picture 9), which can be found in still ponds and puddles and can make the water look green. Then in salty water near the top, there are often countless tiny creatures whose\nSmall bodies shine like fire when the water is disturbed at night. Some of these bodies are important because they can make people and animals sick. There is one that can make people sleep a lot and feel very sick. There are also others that can make animals and birds feel bad. \n\nThere are simple shapes that look like a spiral. They can make people and animals sick too. Some people think that these shapes are the cause of a fever that is yellow. \n\nThere are members of a group that were found in different waters. They are known for having many fine hairs that help them move and get their food. There are two tiny animals we often see under a microscope. One is called \"slide animal\", and the other is named \"bell animal\". The \"slide animals\" were used in many amazing studies about how tiny creatures behave. The researcher found that these tiny creatures always acted in a certain way when something happened around them. It made him think that he could see the start of smarts and other qualities that big animals have. The \"bell animal\" might be the first tiny creature ever seen under a microscope. A long time ago, a man named Anton made lenses and used them to see and describe creatures that probably belong to the \"bell animal\" group. Almost none of the tiny creatures in water can make people or animals sick, but some are said to be found in certain tummy diseases in people and animals.\n\n[Picture: A \"slide animal\".]\n\n[Picture: A \"bell animal\", one with a twisted tail, the other with a straight tail.] The last group is very important, even though there are not many kinds, only about three hundred. These tiny creatures cause a lot of problems in people and other animals because they live inside them and cause harm. Almost no animals are safe from them. They can even harm other tiny creatures. There are many types that attack different animals like bugs, birds, reptiles, fish, and others. Ten types can harm people. In some cases, these harmful creatures are always in the host and some hosts may have several different types.\n\nNot much was known about this group of harmful creatures before a long time ago. Since then, most of the types that we now know have been found, and in the last few years, we've learned a lot about many of them.\nPeople study these things a lot today. Doctors and scientists are trying to learn more about them. \n\nThe Sporozoa are very different from each other. They can change to fit where they live, so we can see many shapes and sizes. But they all share some things. They all eat, breathe, and get rid of waste in the same way, through their bodies. All of them can move, some with tiny whip-like things, others by stretching their bodies. Some can move from one cell to another in the body, like white blood cells do. They all make spores, which is why they have their name. \n\nSometimes, inside them, there are many little parts that split off. Each part has a little bit of the stuff that makes up their body, sometimes inside a tiny bag of its own. This is how they make spores. So, from one of these, we can get not just two, like in the amoeba, but twenty or more. The little bags that hold them let them to\nSome things can stay the same even when lots of changes happen. They can become dry or cold, or stay for a long time in the ground or water. Then, when the time comes, they can move to a new place.\n\nThere are many small groups of things. Some are very important to us because they can make us sick. They need two places to live. One place is usually a small animal and the other place is usually a bigger animal.\n\nChapter 3\n\nSmall Animals\n\nWe will talk about a group of animals called Arthropoda. This means \"jointed-feet\" and includes animals like crabs, spiders, and insects. But right now, we are only interested in spiders, mites, and ticks. People often call them insects, but they have four pairs of legs, not three. And their bodies are different from insects, so they are put in a different group.\n\n\nBIG BUGS CALLED TICKS\n\nTicks are big bugs. They are so big that you can see them with your eyes. Some can grow as big as half an inch! When they eat a lot, their skin stretches and they can look like a big seed (see picture 14). Because they can look like a seed, some people call them \"seed-ticks.\"\n\nTicks have short legs and a small head. When their bodies get big, it is hard to see their heads. They have a beak that they use to eat. This beak has many strong teeth. These teeth hold on so tight that if you try to pull the tick off, the head can stay stuck in the skin. This can sometimes make a sore spot.\n\nTicks live by eating from others. Some ticks stay on the animal they eat from all the time. They only go to the ground to lay their eggs when they are ready. Other ticks leave the animal two times to change their skin on the ground. The mama tick lays her eggs, up to 10,000 of them, on the ground or just under the top. The baby \"seed-ticks\" that\nLittle bugs come out of their eggs in a few days. They crawl up on some nearby grass or a bush and wait quietly. They hope some animal comes along. If the animal comes close enough, they leave the grass and cling to their new friend. They are soon eating their first meal. Of course, many of them wait and wait but no animal comes, so they starve. But they can live for a long time without eating. So often their patience is rewarded and they can finally eat.\n\nThose little bugs that fall to the ground to change must again climb to some good spot and wait for another friend. Then they fall to the ground to change again. If they are successful in finding a new friend for the third time, they eat and grow until fully grown and the female is ready to lay her eggs. The Texas bug, and some others, as we shall see, do not fall to the ground to change but once having found a friend stay on it until ready to lay their eggs.\n\nThe baby bugs have only six legs but after the first change they all have eight.\n\n\nBUGS AND SICKNESS\n\n_Texas Sickness._ Ever since people began moving southern animals into states further north, it has been noted that the roads over which they\nwere moved became a big problem for the cows in the north. A lot of times, \n80% to 90% of the local cows got sick after a group of cows from the south\nwalked through their area. The problem got so big that both\nstate and country rules were made. These rules stopped the moving or sending\nof southern cows into the north.\n\n[Picture: FIG. 14--A type of bug (_Ixodes ricinus_) not fully\nfed.]\n\n[Picture: FIG. 15--Texas fever bug, just hatched; has only six\nlegs.]\n\n[Picture: FIG. 16--Texas fever bug (_Margaropus annulatus_) young\ngrown-up not fully fed.]\n\n[Picture: FIG. 17--_Amblyomma variegatum_ some bugs from\nthis group give _Piroplasma_ which cause different sicknesses in\nfarm animals.]\n\nBut for years, people did not know what caused this fever, known as the\nTexas fever. The southern cows looked\nhealthy enough and it was hard to understand how they could make\nthe other cows sick. It was noticed early that the northern cows did not\nneed to touch the\nsouthern cows to get the disease. Indeed, the disease was not\nspread this way at all. The northern cows just needed to\nwalk on the same roads or eat in the same fields. The strange thing was that these places didn't seem dangerous until weeks after the southern cows had walked over them. Then these places could stay dangerous for months.\n\nIn the late 19th century, a man named Thomas from a big office in the US found out that the sickness was caused by a very tiny bug inside the sick cows. More research showed that this tiny bug was passed from the sick cow to the healthy cow only by a common tick now known as the Texas tick.\n\nThe sickness is not passed directly, that is, the tick does not eat from one cow then go to another carrying the sickness with it. Unlike many other ticks, the Texas tick does not leave its cow until it is fully grown. When the mother tick is full and big, she drops to the ground and lays between 2,000 to 4,000 eggs which soon hatch into very small \"baby-ticks\" which crawl to the nearest leaf or bush and wait for the cows to come along.\n\nIf the mother tick had been feeding on a cow that was sick with the Texas sickness, her body was filled with the tiny bugs of which some found their way into the eggs so that the baby ticks\nBugs coming from their eggs were already not feeling well and ready to make the first animal they fed upon not feel well too.\n\nIt took many years of tough, patient work to find out all this, but the things we learned made a lot of the puzzle easier to understand. This helped us figure out why the fever happened in the north and, as we will see, made us think about if other sicknesses might be passed on in the same way.\n\nIt was found out that the southern cows in the place where the bugs normally are, usually don't get very sick when they are young. Even though they may have the bug all their life, it doesn't make them very sick. These cows almost always have bugs, and when they are taken to the north where the bugs don't live naturally and where the cows are not used to them, some of the big bugs fall to the ground and lay their eggs. In a few weeks, these eggs hatch and are ready to make any animal that passes by sick. The northern cows not being used to the sickness soon become ill and die.\n\nIt is thought that the yearly loss because of this sickness and the problems caused by the bug in the US is a lot of money, so of course, lots of hard work is being done to stop it. In the past, different things were tried to clean the bug-filled cows with something that would get rid of the bugs, but it was always costly and\nIt wasn't always good. We used to help the cows stay healthy by giving them a little bit of sick blood when they were young. We found out that we can keep the cows' grass free from tiny bugs called ticks by moving the cows around to different eating areas. The goal is to get the ticks to fall off the cows onto land where we can get rid of them and to use the cows' grass in a way that the ticks in all the grass areas will eventually have nothing to eat and will disappear.\n\nThere are also other sicknesses like the one in Texas that happen to cows in other parts of the world where the cows can get very sick. Horses, sheep, dogs, and other animals can also get sick from the same tiny creatures that make the cows sick. We found out that most of them are given to the animals by different kinds of ticks. Because of this, these little bugs are very important. They not only give the animals the sicknesses that make them sick, but they also give people at least two sicknesses, one called Rocky Mountain spotted fever and the other is called relapsing fevers.\n\n_Spotted Fever._ This sickness has been confusing the doctors in the mountains for a long time. A few years ago, some people found tiny creatures in the blood of the people who were sick, and although\nSome recent studies have not been able to prove earlier findings. Now, many believe that a tiny creature causes the disease. This tiny creature moves from one animal to another through ticks. Ticks live on wild animals in the place where the disease is found. Dr. Henry has studied this disease a lot. He has shown:\n\n     \"1. The disease is active only when the grown-up boy and girl ticks can harm people.\n\n     \"2. Almost all people who have this disease have been bitten by a tick.\n\n     \"3. The time between the tick bite and when the disease starts in animals is similar to the time it takes in people.\n\n     \"4. Ticks that have the disease are in the place where the disease is found.\n\n     \"5. The illness is very much connected to the tick's body. This is shown because the mom tick can pass the disease to her babies through her eggs. Also, it is seen that in two earlier stages of the tick's life.\"\nThe disease can come if you bite a sick animal. It can be given to other animals too. \n\nA teacher named Ryan from MT place said these things. He has studied about bugs and thinks they are the ones who spread the disease.\n\nThere is another sickness that comes and goes. It happens all over the world. Sometimes it comes to AM country but it does not stay. This sickness can be given by bugs that like to drink blood. In CA place, where many people are sick, a special bug can give this sickness. This bug likes to live in people's homes. It hides in the day and comes out at night. It can bite people and animals and it is a big problem.\n\nKevin, a very smart person about bugs, said:\n19). Sometimes, little spots on our skin become sick and get filled with a waxy stuff. The top part becomes hard and dark, which we call blackheads. If we squeeze out a blackhead and wash off the wax, we can sometimes find tiny bugs in it. Young bugs have six legs, and grown-up ones have eight. Their bodies are long and have lines across them. We can usually find these bugs around the nose, chin, and neck. They usually don't hurt us, but they can make our skin look not nice if we don't clean it well. Some people think these bugs may help spread a sickness called leprosy, or maybe even cause another sickness called cancer, but we are not sure yet.\n\nDogs and cats can also get these bugs and it can hurt them a lot. When it's really bad, their fur can fall out and their skin can get crusty. Horses, cows, and sheep can get it too. The sickness from these bugs in pets is usually hard to cure, except when it's caught very early. Then, creams or lotions can help a bit.\n\n_Itch-bugs._ There's a saying, \"as slow as the seven-years' itch\".\nMany children can understand that itching can take a very long time to stop once it starts. We don't know why some people say it lasts for seven years. If the tiny round bugs that cause the itch stay on a person for seven years, they might not leave even if the seven years are over.\n\n[Image: Picture 1--The Tick that Can Make You Very Sick. From a book about bugs.]\n\n[Image: Picture 2--The tiny bug that lives in hair. (After a drawing by Mr. M.)]\n\n[Image: Picture 3--The tiny bug that makes you itch. (After a drawing by Mr. M.)]\n\n[Image: Picture 4--Tiny bugs called \"jiggers.\" (After a drawing by Mr. R.)]\n\nThe very small white bugs that make you itch (Picture 3) are so tiny that you can barely see them. They usually move very slowly but can move faster when they get warm. They live in tiny tunnels just under the top layer of skin and sometimes go deeper, causing a lot of itching.\nitching. As a mother bug digs, she lays her tiny eggs. Baby bugs come from these eggs, spreading the itchy feeling. Using special creams and washes can help. Keeping clean can stop it from happening.\n\nBugs that are similar to the ones that make people itchy can also bother pets, causing them to scratch and lose hair. The type that bothers horses digs in their skin, causing spots and itchy patches. This is very annoying for them. These bugs can also move to people. Using special water and creams can help.\n\nHorses and cows can also get bothered by other bugs which cause them to scratch a lot. These bugs don't dig into the skin but live on the outside in groups, eating the skin and causing itchy spots. The skin gets red and makes the animal scratch and rub all the time, often making them lose a lot of hair.\n\nMany other bugs can make pets sick, like making them lose hair, itch a lot, and other problems. But we only need to talk about one more example, that\nAbout the very tiny bugs (Fig. 21). Teacher Oliver, from whose book most of these notes about the bugs are taken, says this about this bug.\n\n     \"The worst bugs are the red-bugs. People and animals walking through grass that has them are bitten by these bugs, which hide in and under the skin, causing itching and sores. The sores are caused by the person scratching too much if they are a human, who scratches a lot and tries to get rid of the bugs. I have been bitten! Those who have ever walked through grass with red-bugs will remember it.\"\n\nHorses, cows, dogs and cats and other animals also get bitten. Once again, yellow creams are the best medicine.\n\n     \"The normal food of these bugs is the juice of plants, and the love of blood is bad for those\nPeople sometimes get to feel it. These are not like true bugs. The female true bugs lay eggs in the spot they bite. But these little bugs don't do that. If we don't get rid of them, they soon die because they eat too much.\n\nChapter 4\n\nHow Bugs Can Make Us Sick\n\nPeople think there are about four thousand types of tiny creatures, about twenty-five thousand types of shelled animals, about ten thousand types of birds, about three thousand five hundred types of animals with hair, and from two hundred thousand to one million types of bugs. This means there are more types of bugs than any other animals combined.\n\nNot only are there many types of bugs, but there are also a lot of bugs of each type. Try to count the number of little green bugs on a rose plant or a cabbage plant. Try to guess how many mosquitoes come out of a pond every day. Try to guess how many scale bugs are on a small part of a tree that is badly infected with scale bugs. Then try to think about how many more plants or trees or ponds there might be that are also making millions of bugs just like these.\nand you will only start to understand this idea.\n\nAs long as these many bugs stay where we think they should be, we don't worry about how many there are. We only think about them when someone tells us something amazing about how they are made, how they live, or how they change. But, since a long time ago, we know that bugs have not always stayed where they should. Sometimes, they mess up people's plans and wants. Because there are so many of them, they often cause big problems.\n\nBugs make the people in US country lose a lot of money every year. They eat up fields of grain; they ruin or harm fruit trees and gardens; they turn forests into empty places. In many other ways, these little pests that don't stay where they should take a lot of money from our people.\n\nPeople have known and understood these things for a very long time. Many books have been written about bugs, how they live, and how to stop them.\n\nBut only in the last few years have we started to understand how important bugs are to the health of the people they live around. Dr. Henry thinks that every year in the US country, about twelve thousand people die from a sickness caused by bugs.\nThere is a big problem that is caused by two or three kinds of small bugs called mosquitoes. It costs a lot of money each year and causes people to feel sick and unhappy.\n\nThere is another sickness called Yellow Sickness. It is not everywhere, but it is very dangerous and makes people very scared. This sickness is spread only by one kind of mosquito. Other small bugs like flies, tiny jumping bugs, and bedbugs also spread other scary sicknesses. That's why doctors, bug experts, and people who study living things are trying very hard to learn about these bugs. These bugs are important because they can affect our happiness, comfort, and even our lives.\n\nIt would not be right to try to explain here how bugs are grouped or classified. This information can be found in many books about bugs.\n\nThe way most people group bugs is into nineteen big groups. Some of these groups have beetles, butterflies and moths, bees, ants, and wasps. We are going to be interested in four or five of these groups.\n\nThe group called Flies, which have two wings, is the most important because\nThis is about the bugs like mosquitoes who spread sickness like fever, and the common fly that we know can spread other sicknesses too.\n\nFLIES\n\nThere are lots of different types of flies. Some flies are really important because they can cause problems. We can think of flies in two groups: flies that bite like mosquitoes and a kind of fly that we often see around horses, and flies that don't bite but suck, like the common fly and other similar flies.\n\nSome of the biting flies are really bothersome for people and animals too. After mosquitoes, the horse-flies are probably the ones we know best. There are a few different types of them, and people call them by different names. They are a big problem for horses and cows, and sometimes they even bother people. They have strong, sharp parts that let them bite through the tough skin of animals and even through thin clothes that people wear. Their bites can hurt a lot and are very annoying, and if there are lots of these flies around, they can really bother people and animals a lot. People have said that these flies and some others can carry\nTiny bugs can carry tiny germs from one animal to another. One of these germs can make animals and people sick. This was discovered many years ago by two scientists, Kevin and Patrick. They learned that this germ is the reason for the sickness. They also found out that bugs that can bite are important in spreading the sickness. \n\nThere are pictures of different kinds of bugs. One is called a horse-bug, another is called a stable-bug, there is also a black-bug, a screw-worm bug, and a blow-bug. The stable-bug is shown in a picture. 23) There is a fly that looks like the kind we see in our homes. It often bothers horses and cows. This fly drinks blood, so we think it can spread sicknesses. \n\nLater, we will talk about another fly, that's a bit like the first one. This fly spreads a sickness that makes people very tired. This sickness comes from a tiny creature that the fly carries from one host to another.\n\nIn places far away like some parts of Asia and Africa, there's a really bad sickness that horses get. It's called surra and it comes from a similar tiny creature. This creature can make horses, mules, elephants, buffaloes and dogs sick. We believe that this sickness came to the PH city recently. We think that flies similar to the one we talked about first, and a couple of other kinds of flies, spread this sickness.\n\nThere's another sickness that's very bad for pets and animals in\nCentral and Southern Africa. In some parts, it's very hard to\nkeep any kind of animals that come from other places because of a sickness. This sickness is\ncaused by a small creature similar to the one causing\nanother sickness. This small creature can be found in several different kinds of\nanimals that live here. They don't get sick but can make other animals sick when they are brought here. Two or three types of flies spread this disease.\n\nThere is another group of flies that are smaller but more and more\nbothering. They are the black-flies or buffalo-gnats. For more than\na hundred years, these little flies have been known as big troubles for animals, especially in the south. Here, apart from the\nactual loss of many animals yearly, the flies make it so annoying\nthat sometimes it's impossible to work in the field. People\nare often bitten, and as the bite is bad and very painful, it can hurt a lot\nand cases of deaths from such bites have been\nreported.\n\nThere is another type of fly, smaller, but much like the buffalo-gnat\nin habits, are the tiny little \"punkies\" or \"no-see-ums\" which\nsometimes come in great numbers in certain places where they make life\nhard for people and animals. While it's not been shown that either the\nSmall bugs, like punkies, may not cause sickness, but they can bite many types of animals and people. These bites can itch, and scratching can lead to skin problems. This could let in bad germs, especially ones that cause skin problems.\n\nNow, let's talk about a group of bugs that includes house-flies. Some of these bugs can cause discomfort, especially when they are babies.\n\nThe gray flies are a common type of these bugs (Image 25). Gray flies can lay hundreds of eggs on a hurt spot. The baby bugs, which are born in a few hours, go into the hurt spot and eat the skin around it until they grow up. Then, they leave the hurt spot and fall on the ground where they change into a pupa and later into a grown-up fly. Of course, having them in the hurt spot can be very uncomfortable to the animal, and it can hurt a lot. Small scratches that could otherwise\nquickly get better often turn into big ouchies because of these little bugs.\n\nThere are many stories of these bugs putting their eggs in the ears or nose of children or people sleeping outside during the day. This happens more if there are yucky smells that bring the bug. In such cases, the little bugs dig into the skin, eating the soft part, the muscles and even the bones, causing big pain and usually, gone forever. The little bugs in such places may be stopped with a strong medicine and, if the case is taken care of before they have hurt too much of the skin, feeling better usually happens.\n\nThe big green bugs (Pic. 1) and the blue bugs (Pic. 2), and the meat bugs (Pic. 3) all have ways a bit like the twisty-worm bug. Any of them may put their eggs in ouchies on people or animals with the same bad things happening.\n\nThe meat bug instead of laying eggs puts the living little bugs on meat wherever it can find it, and as these grow really fast they are able to eat a lot of meat in a very short time. In this way they may be of some importance as\nThere were small holes in the dirt floors of the houses. Tiny bugs would come out of these holes at night and drink the blood of the people sleeping on the floor or on a small bed. \n\nSome bugs, called bot-flies, can't bite or poke an animal because their mouths are too small or not there at all. Even though they can't bite, they can still bother people and animals a lot. Horses seem to be really scared of them and will do everything they can to get rid of these annoying bugs.\n\nThe eggs of the house bot-fly are put on the hair of the legs or somewhere else on the body. The horse licks them off and the eggs open up and grow in the belly of the horse. Sometimes the inside walls of the stomach can be almost full of these bugs and this can make it hard for the stomach to work. When the bugs are all grown up, they leave the host and finish growing in the ground. \n\nThere was a picture of a blue-bottle fly. \n\nThere was another picture. Here are some pictures of different bugs:\n\n[Illustration: Picture 1--A type of fly.]\n\n[Illustration: Picture 2--A little house-fly.]\n\n[Illustration: Picture 3--A horse fly.]\n\n[Illustration: Picture 4--A big cow fly.]\n\n[Illustration: Picture 5--A sheep fly.]\n\nThe cow flies (Picture 4) lay eggs on a cow. When the cow licks its body, it swallows the eggs. But instead of going to the belly, these eggs go to the throat and then crawl through the body to the back under the skin. When they grow up there, they make the cow's skin not good. When they are all grown up, they fall to the ground.\n\nThe sheep flies (Picture 5) lay their eggs in the noses of sheep.\nLittle bugs can go into the front part of the head where they eat the nose goo, causing a lot of pain and loss. Lots of other animals have their own kind of bugs. There are times when a certain bug has been found in people, always causing much pain and sometimes even making them pass away.\n\nOne or more kinds of bugs found in the warm parts of AM country can often hurt people. The young bug just after it has gotten into the skin is known as the _Ver macaque_. Older stages as _torcel_ or _Berne_. The bugs cause very sore and troubling spots. It is thought that the grown-up bugs lay their eggs on the skin and the little bugs get inside as soon as they come out of the eggs. It has also been suggested that they might get under the skin by moving from the belly as do some of the other bugs. A very bad eye sickness, is known to be spread by house bugs and others. These bugs are often found near the eyes, especially of children suffering from this sickness. It is suspected that certain small bugs in the southern part of US country are responsible for the spread of sickness known as \"sore eye.\"\n\n\nBUGS\n\nBugs used to be seen as lesser flies and were put with that group but they are now seen as a different group (Siphonaptera). Recently, these tiny pests have become more important because they spread sickness. The fact that they are everywhere and that they will easily move from one host to another makes the chance of them spreading diseases very high. There are many other types that live on various wild and tame animals and a few that attack birds.\n\nOne of the most important of these is the jigger-bug or chigoe (_Dermatophilus penetrans_, Fig. 33). Various other names such as chigger-bug, sand-bug, jigger, chigger are also used for this bug as well as for a tiny red bug that burrows into the skin in much the same way as the female of the bug. So although they are entirely different creatures you can never tell from the common name, whether it is the bug or the mite that is being talked about. Both the male and female jigger-bugs feed on the host and hop on or off as do other bugs, but when the female is ready to lay eggs (Fig. 34), she digs into the skin. This causes a bump and often a sore that can get very bad, especially if the bug is squished and the stuff inside her gets into the skin around her.\n\nThese little bugs are found in hot and warm places in AM city and have also been seen in Africa and IN city and other places. They bite all kinds of animals and many birds, causing a lot of bother and hurt. They often bite people's feet, especially those who do not wear shoes. Sometimes there are so many of them that they cause a lot of sores.\n\nBecause they eat so many different things, it's hard to stop them, but you can try to keep your home and barns clean and sprinkle bug powder or water that smells bad to bugs in places where they like to lay their eggs. If they get under your skin, you should carefully remove them, making sure to get the whole bug out.\n\nBEDBUGS\n\nIn the bug group, we find a few kinds that can spread sickness. The bedbug has been blamed for spreading very bad fevers\nThere are bugs that can make people sick. For example, a bug found in IN country can carry a sickness. This bug can spread the sickness.\n\nLICE\n\nThere are also lice (see Fig. 36) that can carry diseases. It is believed that the lice found on rats can spread a thing from rat to rat. This thing does not make the rats sick, but if the lice can carry this, they might also carry things that can make people sick.\n\n[Pictures: FIG. 33--A flea, male.]\n[Pictures: FIG. 34--A flea, female with eggs.]\n[Pictures: FIG. 35--A bedbug.]\n[Pictures: FIG. 36--A louse. (From picture by J.)] Bugs can carry tiny bad things that can make people sick. Bugs might get these tiny bad things on their bodies when they move around or eat. They can bring these bad things to our food, water or even to people, making them sick. For example, a house-fly might carry these bad things on its feet or in its body and bring them to places where people can get them.\n\nOther bugs like fleas, tiny bed bugs, and ticks can also carry these bad things in the same way. This way of getting people sick is very dangerous because it happens a lot. But there is another way bugs can make people sick which is very interesting. We will talk more about this when we learn about some specific sicknesses.\n\nIn these cases, the bug is very important for the tiny bad thing. The tiny bad thing needs to go into the bug at a certain time of its life.\n\n[Picture: FIG. 37--One thing a house-fly can do.]\n\nTime for bed.\n\n  1. Bye-bye, baby,\n  Look, a bug;\n  You and I will watch it, okay?\n    It can climb\n    Up high,\n    But it doesn't fall, hooray!\n  With six legs like that, \n  You and I could walk on eggs, imagine that.\n    There it goes,\n    On its toes,\n    Tickling the baby's nose.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\nABOUT HOUSE-BUGS\n\n\nThe picture in Fig. 37 came from an old book\nand tells us how we used to feel about the\nhouse-bug. A few of them were good to have around to make the house\nfeel \"like home.\" Sure, they sometimes woke us up too early in the\nmorning when we wanted to sleep a little more, or they wanted some of our food\nafter we had put it on the table. But a net over the bed would\nkeep them away in the morning and a homemade bug-brush could help to make them leave the\ntable. If some fell into the milk or coffee, we could take them out; if they went into the soup or the food, we didn't notice!\n\nPeople used to think that flies were great toys for babies, and they were helpful because they ate all sorts of trash in the yard. People also thought they were clean, because you could often see them cleaning their heads and bodies with their legs. We never thought we could get rid of them, because they came from outside, and who could get rid of all the flies outside?\n\nBut now, things have changed. The fly, once thought to be harmless, is now seen as a troublemaker. Some people even want to change its name to show how much we dislike it now.\n\nAll of this change happened because scientists started studying the fly closely. We now know that when a fly is buzzing around a baby's nose, it could be causing problems.\nthey may breathe in or put many tiny dirt particles in their mouths,\nwhich could make them unwell. We know that when they are buzzing around\nour faces while we are trying to sleep, they might unknowingly be\ndoing the same naughty things. We know that when they sip from our cups\nwith us or take a dip in our drinks or our soup or walk neatly over our\nmeat or sweet cake, they are leaving behind a trail of dirt and tiny\ndirt particles. We know that some of these tiny dirt particles can make\nus unwell. Because the bad sickness tiny dirt particles are often spread\nthis way, Dr. Henry has suggested that the house-fly should be known in\nthe future as the bad sickness fly. Not because it is the only thing\nthat spreads bad sickness, but because it is a big part of it and is very\ndangerous. The names \"dirty fly\" and \"bathroom fly\" have also been suggested,\nas the only reason to give it another name would be to remind us of the\ndirty and dangerous habits of the fly.\n\nSTRUCTURE\n\nSo we can understand why the house-fly can cause so much trouble,\nlet's think about a few points briefly.\nWe're talking about how a certain creature eats and lives.\n\nThe big eyes that are grouped together are the most noticeable part of the head (Image 39). In the front, between the eyes, are the three-part feelers, the last part having a short, fluffy strand. From the bottom of the head comes a long, soft nose (Image 40). When this is fully stretched out, it is a bit longer than the head; when not stretched and in use, it is folded back in the space on the bottom of the head. About half-way from the base and the middle is a pair of feelers without parts (mouth-feelers). At the end are two soft flaps (Image 41) closely joined along their middle line. These are covered with many fine wrinkled lines, which under the microscope look like fine spirals and are known as fake windpipes. Thus, it can be seen that this creature's mouth-parts are made for sucking and not for biting. Its food must be in a liquid or half-liquid state before it can be sucked through the tube leading from the flaps at the end up through the nose and on into the tummy. If the creature wants to eat on any substance such as\nWhen a fly finds sugar that isn't liquid, it pours out some spit on it. Then it starts to scratch it with the rough ends of its proboscis. This makes the food soft enough for the fly to suck it up. Many people think that house-flies can bite. They will tell you that they have been bitten by them. But if you look at the fly closely, you will see that it was not a house-fly. It was probably a stable-fly, which does have parts in its mouth that can pierce.\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 1--Head of house-fly showing eyes, antennae and\nmouth-parts.]\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 2--Proboscis of house-fly, side view.]\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 3--Ends of proboscis of house-fly showing\nrough ridges.]\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 4--Wing of house-fly.]\n\nThe chest of the fly has two rather wide, soft wings (Fig. 4) which\nhave special veins. Three of these veins end close\ntogether just before the tip of the wing. The last one of the group\nbends forward a bit near the tip. The stable-fly has this vein slightly curved forward but not nearly so\nobviously. 43).\n\nMost other flies that look like the normal house-fly don't have bent forward veins on their wings. The wings, even if they look bare, are covered with tiny hairs that we need a microscope to see. Among these tiny hairs on the wings and on the body, small bits of dust and dirt can stick. The things that we care about more right now, lots of tiny bugs, can also stick to these hairs for a short time. These bugs can then be spread around the air when the fly flies. Or they might get on our food when the fly eats or rests and cleans its body with the bigger hairs on its legs.\n\nThe legs have lots of big hairs and a lot of short, small hairs. On some parts of the legs, the bigger hairs are lined up and used like a comb that the fly uses to clean the rest of its body. The last part of the leg has at its end a pair of big, bent claws and a pair of soft pads known as the pulvillae. On the bottom side of the pulvillae are lots of tiny hairs that can make stuff. With these, the fly can walk on walls or ceilings or in any position on\nshiny surfaces.\n\nHOW THEY CARRY GERMS\n\nThese same tiny foot pads, with their covering of tiny hairs, are\nperhaps the most dangerous part of the bug because they cannot help but\ncarry much of the dirt that the fly walks over, and as this\nmay be full of germs the danger is clear.\n\nFrom a series of well-planned experiments it has been\nshown that the number of germs on a single fly may be anything\nfrom 550 to 6,600,000 with an average for the group tested\nof about one and one-fourth million germs for each fly. Now where\ndo all these germs come from? They come from the place where the\nfly lives or where it eats.\n\n[Illustration: Picture 1--Wing of a fly.]\n\n[Illustration: Picture 2--Wing of house-fly showing tiny pieces of dirt\nsticking to it.]\n\n[Illustration: Picture 3--Last three parts of leg of house-fly showing\nthe claws, the foot pads and the hairs on the legs.]\n\n[Illustration: Picture 4--Foot of house-fly showing claws, hairs,\nfoot pads and the tiny clinging hairs on the foot pads.]\n\n[Illustration: Picture 5] 47--Small bug of house-fly.\n\nLIFE STORY AND WAYS\n\nThe eggs of the house-fly can be placed on almost any kind of old or\nchanging material. If this is kept wet and a proper warmness\nkept the baby bugs (Fig. 47) that come from the eggs may\ngrow. Usually, however, these needs are found only under\ncertain situations and are normally found only in poo piles or in\npotty pits or toilets. Everyone agrees that the mommy fly\nlikes to put her eggs in horse poo when this can be found and\nwhen this is piled in piles in the barn-yard (Fig. 48) or in the field\nthe heat caused by the decay and changing makes ideal situations for\nthe growth of the baby bugs. Cow poo may be used as a growing-place\nto a small extent. The flies are quickly attracted to human\npoo and grow freely in it when chance gives. Old\nvegetables or fruit, changing kitchen trash and other materials\nsometimes also serve as growing-places.\n\nIn good places in warm weather the eggs will open in from eight to\ntwelve hours and the baby bugs will become fully grown in from eight to\nfourteen days. They then change to pupae (Fig. 50) in which stage they\nmay stay for another eight to twenty days when the grown-up flies will\nappear. These numbers are not exact because the weather and other things always change. When it's really wet and warm, it probably takes at least eight days for a fly to grow from an egg to a grown-up fly. But when it's not so good, it might take as long as six weeks.\n\nThe baby flies like it best when the poop is really wet. I have often found them in very big numbers in places where horses sleep that hadn't been cleaned in a while. The horses standing there at night added fresh poop and kept it just wet enough to make things almost perfect for the baby flies.\n\nThe slightly bigger baby flies are usually found where the poop is a little less wet, but it must not be too dry. When the flies are ready to come out of the baby flies, they push their way up to the top. They stay there for a little while and let their body get hard and their wings get dry before they fly away to other poop or, as happens too often, to a kitchen or eating place or food store that is close by.\n\n[Picture: A yard filled with poop. Lots of flies were growing here and going to all the houses close by.]\n\n[Picture: Dirty places where horses sleep; the poop had not been cleaned up for some days and the floor was covered with baby flies.]\n\nOf course it is impossible for them to come out from this dirt without\nlittle bugs carry some dirt on their bodies. If these bugs only live in the farm and go straight from the farm to the house, it wouldn't be a big problem. This is because the farm dirt they bring to our food isn't harmful. But if they live or visit yucky places before coming into the house or the market, it can be a problem.\n\nBUGS AND SICKNESS\n\nIt has been proven that the poop or pee of a sick person can have harmful germs. A person might not know they are sick, but the germs can still be there. The germs can stay for a long time, even after the person feels better. If a bug lives in such dirty stuff, or eats or walks on it, it can pick up some of the germs. The germs can stay harmful for some time. If this bug visits our food while carrying these germs, it can leave some on the food. This could make people very sick. More than that, if the bug eats the dirty stuff, the sickness germs can keep growing inside the bug.\nwent away with the poop. They can keep being harmful for some days. To say it simply, the dirty spots that flies leave are not just yucky, they can also be very dangerous. This means that many people could become sick with harmful germs before anyone knows that there is a sick person or a germ spreader around.\n\nHere is another example to show how the fly can spread harmful germs. They can go into a sick person's room at home or in the hospital and pick up the harmful germs. They can then take these germs to other parts of the house or to nearby houses, or the flies might land on moving carriages or cars and be taken far away before they go into another house and make the food there dirty.\n\nThese are make believe examples, but they show what can happen many times every season all over the world wherever this kind of sickness and flies happen, and no country or people are known to be safe from this sickness, and the fly is found \"wherever people are found.\"\n\nIn the summer of a year long ago, a group of people was chosen to study the sickness in the UN city Army Camps. The following are some of what they found out, as reported by Dr.\nVictor:\n\n     \"FLIES CAN CARRY BAD STUFF\n\n     \"I think that flies helped spread sickness for these reasons:\n\n     \"_a._ Flies landed on dirty stuff in the holes and then\n     went to the food for the soldiers at the food tents. Sometimes where lime had been put\n     on the stuff in the holes, flies with their feet white from\n     lime were seen walking on the food.\n\n     \"_b._ Officers whose food tents were protected by screens\n     got less sick than those\n     whose tents were not protected.\n\n     \"_c._ The sickness mostly went away in the late year of 1898, when\n     it got cold, and the flies couldn't do much.\n\n     \"Flies could carry the bad germ in two\n     ways. First, dirty stuff with the bad germ\n     might stick to the fly and be carried around. Second, it might be possible that the bad germ could be\nkept in a box, and after a while, they were let out to land on clean food.\n     The food was then given to some small creatures to eat. After a while, these small creatures got sick from the same sickness that the flies had landed on before.\n\nIn Dr. David's report to the Big Group of NE city on the \"Dirty NE city's water as a scary thing to our health by\nthe spreading of belly sicknesses through the fly,\" he shows with pictures that the more belly sicknesses there are, the more\nflies there are, and that the most number of people who die from such sicknesses happens\nnear the river where the open or bad sewers scatter\nthe dirt where the flies can feed on it, or along the docks with\ntheir not good enough places to stay and the resulting pile up of dirt.\n\nFLIES AND OTHER SICKNESSES\n\nNot only is the fly an important thing in the spreading of\na fever, but it has been definitely shown that it can\ngive several other serious sicknesses.\n\nThe proof that flies carry and spread the scary germs of a belly sickness is\nvery sure. The germs may be carried on the body where they will\nlive but a short time, or they may be carried in the belly\nwhere they will live for a much longer period and are finally left\nin the fly-spots where they keep their scariness for some time. Flies\nthat had been allowed to touch the belly sickness germs were\nallowed to have milk and meat. In both situations, lots of tiny bugs could be found in the food later. Like the bad bugs, milk seems to be a really good place for the bad bugs to grow. In many of the tests that have been done, the milk is easily infected by the bugs that visit it.\n\nOf course, bad bugs don't often happen in our country, but sadly this is not true for some other tummy problems like tummy ache and tummy inflammation which cause many children, especially bottle-fed babies, to pass away every year. Those who have studied how these problems are spread believe that bugs are one of the biggest reasons for their spread.\n\nIt has been noticed for a long time that bugs really like spit and will eat it on the sidewalk, in the gutter, the spittoon or wherever they can find it. It is also known that the spit of a sick person has a lot of bad bugs. A bug eating and crawling over such stuff must get some of it on its body, and as it dries and the bug flies around, the bad bugs will be spread through the air, maybe over our food. This has been shown\nFlies that have eaten from sick people's spit can carry tiny germs for about fifteen days. This shows how dangerous a fly can be.\n\nIt's believed that fleas are the main carriers of a really bad sickness, but flies can also be a problem. Flies can catch the sickness by eating from sick people or animals, or from their waste. If an infected fly lands on our food or a cut, it can be harmful. \n\nFlies can carry other types of tiny germs, showing that they can spread more sickness. \n\nSome people think that flies can carry other sicknesses too, so it's no surprise that we want them to stay away. We now see them not just as annoying, but as something that can harm us and should stay away from us.\nWe should not allow flies in our places. \n\nEven though only a few flies that come to our food are harmful, all flies come from dirty places. It's hard to know if the tiny things they carry can harm us without special tests. So, it's safer to keep them all away from our food.\n\nGETTING RID OF FLIES\n\nThings like screens and sticky paper can help a little in a clean house. But what's the point of protecting your food at home if it has been around many flies at the store, market, or on the delivery truck?\n\nThe problem is bigger than just keeping flies out of the house. But the solution is simple and cheap. Get rid of the places where flies come from and you won't have any flies. Since flies mostly come from animal waste, the first step is to clean it up from the barnyard every week and spread it on the fields to dry.\nflies cannot grow in dry poop. If we cannot clean it often, we should keep the poop in a box that is so tight that no flies can get in to lay their eggs. Sometimes we may use something like oil or lime juice on the poop so that flies won't like it. But usually, these methods aren't good because they are not thorough or they take too much time and material.\n\nOutdoor toilets and tanks must be carefully looked after. The tanks can be easily covered so no flies can get in. If we fill the dirty pit under the toilet and use a dry-earth closet instead, one of the biggest sources of danger, especially in the countryside and in towns without good sewer systems, will be fixed. After we do these things, we only need to look after the trash cans and the trash piles.\n\nOf course, your friend must keep his place clean too, because his flies can come into your house just like his, so the problem is for everyone in the town.\n\nAlmost all cities and many small towns have rules which, if followed, would protect us from flies, but they are\nA town has not yet called itself a \"clean town.\" \n\nAN EXPERT'S THOUGHTS\n\nIn a new important paper from the Bug Study Group, Dr. Oliver talks about why some bugs are important. He talks about the house-fly, also known as the sick-fly. This is what he thinks about this bug.\n\n     \"Even if the sick-fly or house-fly was hard to\n     get rid of, the fact that people do nothing to lower its numbers could rightly be called\n     very bad neglect; but since, as we will see, it is quite\n     an easy thing to stop the swarm of flies, this neglect\n     shows ignorance or a lack of care in relation to\n     disease-causing dirt which to those who know is a\n     big problem for the way of life.\"\n\nOn another page:\n\n     \"We have shown that the sick-fly or house fly carries\n     harmful germs. Flies can bring sickness like tummy troubles and cough. Everyone should try to keep flies away from their home. The people who take care of the city should try to keep flies away too. This is very important, like keeping away from dangerous animals. \n\nAlso:\n\n\"A big story in a city's afternoon paper said, 'Tummy troubles are a big problem for everyone,' arguing that it is as big a problem as coughing a lot. The person who wrote the story could have said 'Tummy troubles are a big problem for the country,' or maybe even 'Tummy troubles are a bad thing that we should stop,' since we can stop this sickness from happening. And as for the fly that brings tummy troubles, that a bug born in very dirty places and full of sickness germs should almost be\nInvited to multiply without control, even in big city areas,\n     is surely not good.\"\n\nThe whole bulletin (a document) should be read and\nstudied by all who are interested in this subject.\n\n\nOTHER BUGS\n\nSometimes other bugs that look more or less like the house-bug are\nseen in houses. Some of these have the same kind of mouth-parts\nand have habits very like to the house-bug, but as they are usually\nmuch less common and as nearly all that has been said about the\nhouse-bug applies to them and as the same things\nshould be done to fight them they need not be talked about more\nhere.\n\nI have already pointed out that a bug which looks very\nmuch like the house-bug is sometimes found in the house and can often\nbite hard. It has a different kind of beak, one that is\nfitted for piercing so it can suck the blood of its victim. As\nthese bugs often seem to be more persistent before it rains the weather\nprophet will tell you that \"It is surely going to rain because the\nhouse-bugs are starting to bite.\"\n\nThese stable-bugs, as they are called, are big pests of cows and\nhorses in some places. It is thought that they are important factors\nSome sick pets spread sickness. Sometimes they can move this sickness from animals to people or from one person to another. \n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nMOSQUITOES\n\nThere are as many mosquitoes now as there were before. A long time ago, a man named Liam made a list of all the animals he knew about. He only knew about six types of mosquitoes. Then, in the early 20th century, a man named Thomas from a big museum wrote a book. He said there were three hundred and forty-three types of mosquitoes in the world. Other people wrote more books and found even more types of mosquitoes. Now, there might be over five hundred types of mosquitoes. More than sixty types live in the US country.\n\nPeople have been very interested in mosquitoes because they can spread sickness. People have been studying them a lot. They look at how they grow, what they do, and what they look like. If you put together everything that has been written about mosquitoes in the last few years, you would have a lot of books. A picture shows the cocoon of a common house fly with a small opening at the end to let the fly come out.\n\nNext picture shows the head of a type of fly that lives in stables, and it has a sharp beak.\n\nThen there is a picture of a big group of mosquito eggs.\n\nAnother picture shows mosquito eggs and baby mosquitoes, some are feeding at the bottom and some are at the surface to breathe.\n\nThe last picture shows baby mosquitoes, seen from above.\n\nFor those who are really interested, there are some easy-to-find books and papers about this. Here, we will only talk about some simple things about the structure and habits of mosquitoes, so that we can better understand their role in spreading diseases and why we need to fight them.\n\nThe Eggs\n\nMosquitoes lay their eggs in water or in places where water might collect. If not, they will not hatch. Some types of mosquitoes lay their eggs in small groups that float on top of the water, looking like tiny bits of soot. Others lay their eggs one by one, some floating on the surface, others sinking to the bottom where they\nstay until the little ones are ready. Some eggs might stay all through the cold time, but usually those laid when it's warm turn into babies in one to two days or longer, depending on how hot it is. \n\nTHE LITTLE ONES\n\nWhen the little ones are ready, they break open the bottom of the eggs and the tiny swimmers go into the water. The little ones can only live in water, so mosquitoes cannot have babies in wet or damp places unless there is at least a little bit of still water there. A very little bit is okay, but there must be enough to cover the little ones or they will not survive. \n\nThe head of the little ones of most types is wide and flat. The eyes are on the sides, and just in front of them is a pair of short feelers which change with the different types. \n\nThe mouth parts also change a lot depending on what they eat. Some mosquito little ones eat other little ones, feeding on the babies of other types or on other bugs. These ones have their mouth parts made for catching and holding their food. Most of the swimmers, however, eat tiny plants or animal forms which are brushed into the mouth by strange little brush-like parts which move and keep water flowing toward the mouth. \n\nAnother group containing the A bugs are in between these\ntwo and have small mouth-parts for eating tiny things and also for grabbing and holding other bigger things.\n\n[Picture: Picture 1--Eggs, baby bugs and pupae of little flying bugs.]\n\n[Picture: Picture 2--Baby bug of a little flying bug.]\n\n[Picture: Picture 3--Little flying bug babies and pupae with their breathing-tubes at the top of the water.]\n\n[Picture: Picture 4--Another type of bug babies resting at the top of the water.]\n\nSome kinds eat normally some place below the top, others on the bottom, while still others eat always at the top. With one or two exceptions, the bug babies must all come to the top to breathe. Most kinds have on the eighth part of their belly a rather long breathing-tube. The end of this tube is pushed just above the top of the water when they come up for air. In this tube are two big tubes which open just below the end of the tube and go forward through the whole length of the body, giving off smaller branches here and there that divide into still smaller branches until every part of the body is reached by some of the small parts of this breathing system that\nbrings the air to all the parts. The size of the breathing-tube is connected with what the baby bugs eat. Baby bugs who eat at the top have very short tubes, others that eat just below the top have breathing-tubes as long or even longer than the last body part. The last part has at its end four thin flat bits, the breathing gills. These too are bigger or smaller based on the habits of the baby bugs. The ones that eat near the top and have the end of the breathing-tube above the top most of the time have very small breathing gills, while those that eat mostly at the bottom have them well grown.\n\nWhen first born the baby bugs are of course very small. If the weather is hot and there is a lot of food they grow very quickly. In a few days the outside skin becomes rather hard and not stretchy so it will not allow more growth. Then a new skin forms underneath and the old skin is thrown away. This process of throwing away the old skin is called changing skin, and is done four times during the one, two, three or more weeks of baby bug life.\n\nPUPA\n\nWith the fourth skin change the active eating baby bug changes to the still active but not eating baby bug. The insect's head and body are together. If you look closely, you can see the head, feelers, wings and legs of the grown-up insect hidden under the skin. Instead of the air tube on its tummy like the baby insect, it now has two horn-like tubes on its back to get air from above the water. This stage lasts from two to five or six days or more. When the grown-up is ready to come out, the skin breaks open on the back and the insect comes out slowly. It usually takes a few minutes for the grown-up to come out and its wings to get hard enough to fly. During this time, it rests on the old skin or on the water, where it can be caught by any enemies that come by and is always in danger of being knocked over if the water is not very still. \n\n[Drawing: Picture of insect resting at the water.]\n\n[Drawing: Picture of insect with its air tubes in an air bubble under the water.]\n\n[Drawing: Picture of an insect.] 61--Baby bugs and young bugs resting on top of the water.\n\n[Picture: FIG. 62--A girl bug; notice the thin feelers.]\n\n[Picture: FIG. 63--A boy bug; notice the fluffy feelers.]\n\nTHE GROWN-UP BUG\n\nWe all know what the grown-up bug looks like, so we don't need to describe it, but we need to remember some special points about its body, so we can understand how it can spread sickness.\n\nIf we look closely at the feelers of a number of bugs that are annoying us, we will see that they all look very much alike (Fig. 62), tiny round parts with short thin hairs. But if we look at a number of bugs that have grown up from a jar or fish tank we will find two types of feelers, the one described above is from the girl bug. The feelers of the boy bug (Fig. 63) are much more noticeable because they have a bunch of dense, thin, long hairs on each part. Another interesting difference in the feelers is in the size of the first part. Both boys and girls have a short, cup-like part, but it's a bit bigger in boys. This part has a fancy listening part that reacts to the movements of the hair-like parts. Cool experiments have shown that this hair-like parts move best to the sound like the middle C on a piano, the same sound that girls \"sing.\" Of course, bugs like mosquitoes can't talk like us, but they make sound by moving their wings super fast or by letting air go through the small holes in their bodies. Boys and girls are easy to tell apart because of this and, as we'll see later, this matters because only the girls can bite. Boys and girls are also different in another way. Just below the hair-like parts and at the sides of the mouth part is a pair of three-to five-parted parts, the mouth-feelers, which in the girls of most kinds are very short while in the boys they are usually as long as the mouth part. The girls of some kinds have mouth-feelers quite as long as the boys, but they are slender throughout while the boys' mouth-feelers are usually somewhat bigger toward the end and bear more or less clear patches of\nlong hair or scales.\n\n[Illustration: Pic. 1--Head and body of a female bug (bug type A); the short mouth parts are just above\nthe long nose and below the thread-like feelers.]\n\n[Illustration: Pic. 2--Head and body of a male bug (bug type A); the mouth parts are as long as the nose.]\n\n[Illustration: Pic. 3--Head of a female bug (bug type B), with\nmouth-parts separated to show the sharp parts: feelers;\nshort mouth parts; long nose; sharp parts; bottom part of the mouth;\nsharp parts; bottom part of the mouth; front part of the mouth. (After an expert.)]\n\n[Illustration: Pic. 4--Cross-section of nose of female (part a) and\nmale (part b) bug. Nose part; sharp parts; sharp parts; bottom part of the mouth; tube; bottom part of the mouth; part of the mouth;\nThe Mouth Parts\n\nThe parts of the mosquito's mouth are special to us. They seem to be a long, thin beak at first. But if we look closer with a small looking glass, we see that this beak is made of many parts (pic. 66). The biggest part, which we can see clearly, looks like a tube but has a groove on its top. At the end of this part are two small bits which help the sharp parts to pierce. Inside this groove on the top of the part are six very fine, sharp needles. The biggest needle, which we will call the \"big needle\", is actually a hollow tube that is slightly open on the bottom. Right below this is another part, the sides of which are very thin. A tiny pipe runs down the middle of this part (pic. 67, sal) which, though very small, is very important. This is because the spit which can carry the harmful germs into the wound made when the mosquito bites, is pushed through it. The other four sharp things are made of a pair of tiny jaws that are sharp at the tip and a heavier pair of little jaws, which are not smooth on one side at the tip.\n\nHOW THE TINY BUG BITES\n\nWhen the girl tiny bug is feeding on a person or any other animal, the tip of the long mouth part is placed against the skin and the six sharp things are pushed into the skin, the lip-like parts helping to guide them. As they are pushed deeper and deeper, the long mouth part is bent back to allow them to go in. As soon as the bite is made, the tiny bug pours out some liquid from its spit glands through the tube of the thin mouth part, and then starts to drink up the blood through the hollow long mouth part into the throat and on into the tummy.\n\nThe mouth parts of the boy tiny bug are different in some key ways from those of the girl. The thin mouth part is attached to the long mouth part, the tiny jaws are missing, and the little jaws are very much smaller so that the tiny bug can't pierce the tough skin of animals. The boy feeds on the juices of plants just like the girls when they can't get blood. It's not at all necessary for tiny bugs to have the warm blood of people or other animals. Only a few of them ever taste blood. They have been seen feeding\nMosquitoes like to eat things like flowers, ripe fruit, and watermelon. They also like to drink juice from plants. They really like ripe bananas and we give them these in the lab when we want to keep mosquitoes for study.\n\nTHE MIDDLE BODY\n\nThe middle part of the body is strong like a box. It has strong sides for the strong muscles of the wings and legs. The three pairs of legs have hairs and scales, and the ends have two claws. The claws look a little different in different kinds of mosquitoes. The wings are long and thin with a special pattern of veins. On the veins and the edges of the wings are the scales that make it easy to tell mosquitoes from other bugs that look like them. In some mosquitoes, these scales are long and thin, almost like hair. In others, they are quite wide and flat. Just behind the wings is a pair of tiny thread-like things with a knob at the end. These maybe like the second pair of wings most bugs have, and they seem to help the mosquito stay balanced when it's flying. On the sides of the middle body are two little slit-like holes, the breathing-holes. These are the openings for the bug's breathing.\nTHE TUMMY\n\nThe long round tummy is made of eight parts. These are rather strong above and below, but a thin strip along the side is not. In this strip, there are tummy breathing holes. The end of the tummy has a pair of moveable parts, which in the boy are different and used for holding during the mating time.\n\n\nTHE EATING SYSTEM\n\nThe mouth parts of the mosquito have just been described. It will be remembered that the lip is provided with a groove. Through this, the blood or other food is sucked up by means of a strong wall pumping part, the throat, located in the head. Just behind the throat is the pipe which leads to the start of the tummy. Near its end, the pipe gives off three food storages, two above and a single larger one below. In cuttings, these will often be seen to be filled with tiny bubbles. The tummy stretches from the middle of the chest to beyond the middle of the tummy. At its end are given off five long thin processes, the thin tubes which are organs of waste release, acting like the\nkidneys of big animals. The hindgut is the part of the body from the belly to the end.\n\n[Picture: PIC. 68--Wing of a bug (B bug).]\n\n[Picture: PIC. 69--End of bug wing, very big to show the scales on the veins.]\n\n[Picture: PIC. 70--Picture to show the food pipe and salivary glands of a bug.]\n\n[Picture: PIC. 71--Salivary glands of a C bug at right. A bug at left. (After Chris.)]\n\n\nTHE SALIVARY GLANDS\n\nUnder the food pipe in the front part of the chest are the salivary glands. There are two sets of these, each with three parts with a common pipe which joins the pipe from the other set a short distance before they enter the base of the hypopharynx. Each of these parts is made of a layer of cells (Pic. 71) which makes the saliva that is put into the wound as soon as the insect pierces the skin of the victim.\nWhen a mosquito bites someone, a small spot near the bite turns white, then pink and begins to get bigger, itch and burn. Some kids feel mosquito bites more than others. For some, mosquito bites are not a big deal, they might not even notice them, while others get really annoyed with just one bite, and multiple bites can make them very uncomfortable.\n\nAfter about an hour, the itch usually goes away, but sometimes it lasts longer. Sometimes, kids don't feel any itch until a few hours, or even a day, after they've been bitten. In these cases, the bite can be very uncomfortable and can last for several days. Sometimes, the bite can turn into a small sore, especially if it's been scratched a lot. The itch is probably caused by the mosquito's spit that goes into the bite. Some people say that if the mosquito is allowed to finish biting and fly away on its own, the bite won't be as uncomfortable. They believe that the mosquito's spit that causes the itch is sucked back out when the mosquito is done biting. This might be true, but for most kids, a bite hurts no matter what, and they won't want to let a mosquito keep biting them. When the body gets smaller, the air goes out of the small, thin air tubes through the little holes; when the pressure is gone, they fill up with fresh air coming in.\n\nTHE RED LIQUID\n\nAfter a mosquito has been eating from a man or some other animal, it is often so full that the red liquid shows bright and red through the thin sides of the mosquito's body. This, however, is the red liquid of the one who got bit, not the mosquito. The red liquid of insects is not red but pale yellow or green. It is not kept in certain places, but fills all the space inside the body that is not taken by some of the body parts. It touches the walls of the tummy and gets the food from there which it takes to all parts of the body. It does not carry air or take away the bad air as does the red liquid of bigger animals. That job, as we have just seen, is done by the air tubes. Above the tummy, going almost the whole length of the body, is a thin-walled throbbing tube, the heart. This is made up of a series of rooms each talking to the one in front of it by an opening which is looked after by a door. When one of these rooms gets smaller it pushes the red liquid that is in it forward into the\nNext room helps move it along. When the walls get soft, the doors on the sides open and the red juice that is in the body room rushes in to fill the empty room. As these regular beats happen, the red juice is pushed forward into the head where it washes the parts there. We will see in another chapter that the sickness bug gets out from the walls of the tummy of the mosquito into the red juice in the body room and finally gets to the spit parts. As the heart is always pushing red juice to this part of the body, the bugs easily get to the parts from which they finally get out into the new host.\n\n[Picture: PIC. 72--Heads of little buzzer mosquitoes; _a_, boy; _b_, girl.]\n\n[Picture: PIC. 73--Heads of big buzzer mosquitoes; _c_, boy; _d_, girl.]\n\n[Picture: PIC. 74--Wing of big buzzer.]\n\n[Picture: PIC. 75--Wing of another buzzer.]\n\n[Picture: PIC. 76--A non-sick buzzer, boy.]\nStanding on the wall was a bug. \n\n[Picture: FIG. 77--Girl bug.]\n\n[Picture: FIG. 78--A type of bug, a boy, standing on the wall.]\n\n[Picture: FIG. 79--Girl bug.]\n\n\nLEARNING ABOUT BUGS\n\nWe don't need to learn about all the different types of bugs. If you want to, there are many books about it. But we should know about some of the bugs we see often, especially the ones that can make us sick.\n\n\nTHE TYPE OF BUG\n\nWhen we were learning about boy bugs and girl bugs, we saw that one type of bug has long feelers (Figs. 72, 73). This is how we tell this bug from other bugs and it's important because this type of bug can make us sick. Most of these bugs have spots on their wings (Fig. 74), but since other bugs also have spots (Fig. 75), this is not always how we can tell them apart. When this type of bug is resting, its head and feeler are in one\nSome creatures rest with their bodies at an angle to the ground. Others rest with their bodies straight or nearly straight to the ground. So, if you see a lady bug with long mouth-parts and spotted wings resting at an angle to the surface, you can be pretty sure that it's a dangerous type of bug.\n\nIn our country, there are three types of these dangerous bugs that are common in different places.\n\nThis type of bug doesn't lay its eggs all together like many other bugs do. They lay them one by one on top of the water where they might be found floating near each other. There are two tiny water bugs. One is eating, and the other one is just reaching the surface.\n\n[Illustration: Picture 1--Water bug, top view.]\n\n[Illustration: Picture 2--Water bugs resting at the surface of the water.]\n\nThe eggs (Pictures 3, 4) are oval and have a special thin part near the middle.\n\nYou can find the baby bugs during the right season and in places where they are many. You can find them in almost any still water, like small clear ponds beside streams, overflow from springs, swampy lands, in barrels that collect rain, or any other place where the water is quiet. They don't live in salty water. They eat a lot of the green stuff on the water's surface, so you can often find them there. We have already seen that where they stay in the water is different from other bugs (Picture 5).\n\nBecause their breathing tube is very short, the baby bugs must get close to the surface to breathe. When they are eating, you can see them lying just under the surface of the water with their funny round heads turned all the way upside down as they eat stuff that is floating on the surface (Pictures 6, 7). The bugs do not look very different from other bugs although they usually sleep with their little body closer to the ground. They don't like wind and so they will be more likely to stay in rooms or places where there is little air moving around. \n\nThey may sometimes bite during the day. One hungry girl bug took two short meals from my arm while we were trying to take her picture one warm afternoon.\n\nThe girl bug spends the winter in her grown-up state, sleeping in any cozy place about old trees or logs, in small spaces in doors or outside. In the house they hide in the closets, behind the dresser, behind the top of the bed, or underneath it, or in any place where they are not likely to be bothered. \n\nIf the room is kept warm they may come out for a meal almost any time.\n\nTHE YELLOW BUG\n\nA mosquito type called _S calopus_ is very important because it spreads a scary sickness. This mosquito is usually found in hot places but can also be seen in cooler places during summer. The grown-up mosquito is black with white spots. It has white lines on its body that look like a musical instrument called a lyre. These mosquitoes like to live in houses. Once they are in a room, they almost never leave unless they need to lay their eggs in water nearby.\n\nThey like to bite during the day, so people call them \"day mosquitoes\". But they also bite at night, and other mosquitoes do too if they get the chance. This is important to know so we can stop the spread of a sickness called yellow fever. The baby mosquitoes and the almost grown-up mosquitoes don't do anything special.\nthis lets us tell this type from other similar types without looking too closely. For a while, people thought this type only lived in clean water. But now we know it can live in any water. Some say it even likes dirty water. I have seen them in lots and lots of dirty water drains in a city called TA city. They were there with two other types, which I will call ST bug and CU bug. As these bugs eat a lot of tiny things called bacteria, we would expect to find them in places where there are lots of bacteria.\n\nThey can live in any kind of water and even in a very small amount of water. This makes them very good at living around houses.\n\nAs far as we know, only these two types of bugs can make people sick in the US. In other countries, other types are thought to make people sick, but we will talk about this in later parts of the book.\n\nOTHER TYPES\n\nThere are many other types of bugs that we know about. We can split them into two groups based on where they like to live. Some live in fresh water and some live in salty water. Among the fresh water types, some are found mostly around people and their houses, while others live in\nthe woods or other places and so are far less troublesome. Most of\nthese do not fly far. Some of the bugs that live in salty\nwater are great travelers and may fly inland for many miles. Hence, the\ntowns located a few miles inland from the lower\nreaches of SF Bay are often bothered more by the bugs\nthat live only in the salty water on the salt marshes than they are\nby any of the fresh-water forms. The worst bug nuisance\nalong the coast of the eastern US and for some distance\ninland is a type that lives in the salt marshes.\n\n\nNATURAL ENEMIES OF BUGS\n\nIn fighting harmful bugs we learned long ago that often the most\nefficient, the easiest and cheapest way is to depend on their natural\nenemies to keep them in check. Under normal or rather natural conditions\nwe find that they are usually kept under control by their\nnatural enemies, but under the artificial conditions brought about by\nthe settling and developing of any district big changes occur. It\noften happens that these changes are good for the development\nof the harmful bugs and bad for the development of their\nenemies.\n\nA big example and one to the point is given in the introduction\nof bugs into HI. Up to a long time ago there were no bugs on these.\nislands. They think that the bugs came there from some ships that were visiting the islands. Some people say that they even know the ship that brought them from a faraway land.\n\nOnce they arrived, they liked the place a lot. There was a lot of water and not many animals that could hurt them. So, they grew a lot and started living in all the islands. This was the so-called night bug. Much later, another kind of bug came. This one was not nice and could make people sick. It also became a big problem. \n\nWe have some types of small fish (Fig. 88) living in slow-moving rivers in the lower part of our country. These fish eat the bugs. Some time ago, some of these fish were taken to the islands to see if they could help with the bug problem. The fish seem to be doing well. They are eating a lot of bug babies, and it looks like they are going to be a big help. But, we can't only rely on them.\n\n[Illustration: FIG. 86--Salt-marsh bug; male.]\n\nPictures: Picture 87--Bug (kind like a mosquito);\nfemale.]\n\nPicture: Picture 88--Fish (kind like a small fish). \n\nPicture: Picture 89--Dragon-flies. \n\nBecause of the different ways of living of both the baby and grown-up bugs, it will\nnever be possible for any bug eater or group of bug eaters\nto control the bugs of any place, but as certain of\nthem are helpful they should be talked about.\n\n\nBUG EATERS\n\nBirds eat a few bugs, the ones that fly at night are particularly\nhelpful, but the number eaten is probably so small as to be\nof little real importance.\n\nThe dragon-flies (Pictures 89, 90, 91) or mosquito eaters have long been\nknown as great enemies of bugs, and they certainly do destroy many\nof them as they are flying about places where bugs are many. Dr.\nJack of NJ city very much doubts their ability, but\nobservations made by other smart men would seem to show that\nthey often eat large numbers of bugs during the day and evening.\n\nSpiders and toads eat some mosquitoes each night. Some more mosquitoes are eaten by other bugs, but not many mosquitoes are eaten all together. Even though grown-up mosquitoes have some enemies, there are still a lot of mosquitoes in places where there are too many of them.\n\nENEMIES OF THE BABY MOSQUITOES\n\nThe baby mosquitoes have many more enemies. When things are good, these enemies can keep little ponds or lakes very clean from the bad mosquitoes. The water-babies of many bugs like to eat baby mosquitoes. The water-tigers, which are water-babies of the diving beetles, are very strong and they can eat all the baby mosquitoes in ponds where they are (Fig. 92). Dragon-fly water-babies also like to eat baby mosquitoes. Whirligig beetles are said to be very good at eating _Anopheles_ baby mosquitoes and many other bugs like water-boatmen, back-swimmers, etc., like to eat the babies of different kinds of mosquitoes. If you put a few of these into a jar with _Anopheles_ baby mosquitoes, they will eat all of them, even the very young bugs eating baby mosquitoes much bigger than they are.\n\nIt is fun to learn that the babies of some mosquitoes like to eat other baby mosquitoes that may\nThere's a chance to be in the same place.\n\n[Illustration: Picture 1--A baby dragon-fly.]\n\n[Illustration: Picture 2--The old skin of a baby dragon-fly.]\n\n[Illustration: Picture 3--Water-beetles and water-bugs.]\n\nDifferent types of fish are the biggest enemies of mosquitoes. Lots of small sea fish are often carried over the grassy sea areas by the very high tides and left in the many small tide pools when the tide goes down. No mosquitoes can grow in a pool with these fish. In the streams and lakes with fresh water, there are several types of small fish that eat a lot of mosquito babies and unless the grass or reeds stop the fish from reaching all parts of the ponds or lakes, very few mosquitoes can grow in places where they are.\n\nSmall red bugs that attack the house-flies and other bugs sometimes attack adult mosquitoes, but they are usually not very many.\nRoundworms can harm certain creatures. Some creatures feel more or less hurt from different tiny parasites.\n\nFIGHTING BUGS\n\nWhen bugs bother us, we usually start by trying to get rid of the closest ones. We try to squash them if they bite us; we put screens on doors and windows to keep them out of the house. In warmer places, the people are a little more friendly and do not keep bugs out of the house entirely, but put screens on the beds for safety at night. If the bugs become too annoying during the day, the bed makes a safe and comfy hideout. All the bugs in a room may be gotten rid of by making the room smell bad with a certain substance at a specific amount. A certain flower is also used a lot, but it only makes the bugs sleepy for a little while instead of getting rid of them. While they are sleepy, they can be swept up and gotten rid of.\n\nDifferent things are sometimes used to keep bugs away by those who have to be in places where the bugs are plentiful. With many of these, though, \"the cure is worse than the problem.\" Smoke from a smoldering fire will keep a big area quite free from\nBugs. The person who can keep himself in a lot of smoke from his pipe will not be bothered by bugs. Some different smelly oils are sometimes put on the face and hands. These will help keep the bugs away as long as they last. Mr. Smith says that he has found lemon-smelling oil quite good and of course nicer than the other things usually used. Be careful not to get it in your eyes. An ointment made of cedar oil, one unit; lemon-smelling oil, two units; spirit of camphor, two units, is said to make a good bug-repellant and works for a long time.\n\n[Illustration: Picture 1--A type of fish. (From some information.)]\n\n[Illustration: Picture 2--Another type of fish. (From some information.)]\n\n[Illustration: Picture 3--An old water bowl, a good place for bugs to be born.]\n\nFIGHTING THE BUG BABIES\n\nAll of the work to fight the grown-up bugs are usually not very useful in reducing the number in any area. It's a bit simple to stop them when they are still little bugs. We know that bugs need water to grow in. This makes it easier than if they could grow in any wet places like watered lawns or a cool part of the garden. The whole thing about stopping the bugs is about finding and getting rid of or treating their growing places. We know how some kinds, like the fever bug, stay close to their homes. They never go far from their growing places. If a house has one of these bugs, the house should be looked for where the bug is coming from. Things like water tanks, water barrels, dirty water traps, dirty water pools, tubs or buckets of water or old tin cans in hidden corners, are all good places for them to grow in. Water tanks and water barrels should be covered so that no bugs can get in or out, or the top should be covered with a layer of oil which will kill all the little bugs in the water when they come to the top to breathe, and will also kill the female bugs when they come to lay their eggs. The hole to open dirty water pools should be covered or the top of the water kept well\ncovered with gooey stuff. Water in any containers in the yard should be\npoured out every week or so and the old tin cans should be thrown away or\ntaken away. When trying to get rid of these bugs at home, you only need to worry about\nyour own yard and the yards of your close friends. Some other bugs, while\nstill staying close to their homes, can fly much farther than the\nreally home-loving ones. To get rid of these, you have to think about a big area around your home. Places where animals drink water (see picture\n95) that are left full from week to week, the extra water from such\nplaces, and the marks made in the mud around them (see picture 96), small\nlazy rivers, water canals, and small ponds or lakes where there are no\nfish are perfect places for several types of bugs including one type and others. The solution is easy.\nThe places where animals drink water can be emptied and filled up again every week during\nthe summer time, the extra water can be handled in a canal that will\nlead it away from the drinking place to where it will sink into the ground, the\nsides of the rivers or ponds or lakes can be cleared in such a way that\nfish can swim to all parts of the water; most of the small ponds can be\nemptied or their surface can be covered over with a thin layer of\nsome oil. This is best used as a mist; a small amount for a big space is enough. If the oil is simply spread over the surface, more will be needed. \n\nThe struggle of the creatures that live on the large salty lands in many areas is a bigger and more difficult problem. But as it usually involves big groups of people, sometimes whole regions, it can be tackled on a larger scale. The very good results that have been achieved in NE city and on the SF peninsula, and in a smaller way in other places, show what can be done if the community joins the struggle in a smart way. In the struggle in NE city, a lot of land has been made dry so that there are no longer small pools where the bugs can live. When it's not possible to make them dry, the pools can be sprayed now and then with oil.\n\nThe worth of the land that is made useful by a good system of making it dry is often enough to pay many times over the cost of making it dry. Thus, the bugs are gotten rid of and the land becomes more valuable by a single action.\n\nChapter 7\n\nBugs and Illness\n\nSince the start of history, we have records of certain illnesses that have been called by different names according to the people that were affected. As we study these names and the various writings\nAbout the fevers, we know a big group of them as malarial fevers today. These sicknesses are as old as history and have been seen everywhere. There are some areas in all countries where malaria does not happen, but usually, other areas nearby are sick and they often are the most helpful parts of the land, where water is a lot and plants are everywhere. In fact, the meeting of these two things, low lands with a lot of water, and malaria has always been seen and led to the first ideas about the cause of the sickness.\n\nFor example, we find some of the very early writers saying that swampy places should be avoided because they make animals that bring sickness, or that the air is bad because of the breath of the swamp-living animals.\n\nThese ideas about the start of the fever stayed until the start of the 18th century when the newly found microscope began to show the different kinds of tiny animals to be found in bad material.\n\nIn 1718, 'Adam' believed that the many insects, especially gnats or mosquitoes, that came from such swampy areas might carry some of\nsome people get sick because of harmful things that bugs put in them when they bite. This idea took a lot of time to be proved right.\n\nPeople thought bugs didn't cause sickness because they focused on the bad air in wet places. \"Malaria\" even means \"bad air\". We can see fog coming up from these places, especially in the evening or night, and being in the fog often meant getting sick. So, people thought the fog caused the sickness. They did many experiments and thought they proved that only the fog caused the sickness. They even found the tiny things they thought caused the fever and tried experiments on them.\n\nThe tiny thing that makes you get malaria\n\nPeople had looked at blood many times and knew what it looked like when someone had malaria. In the late 20th century, a man named Adam in the FR country started to study the blood of\nA very smart doctor looked very closely at some sick people. He found a tiny thing that made them sick. Not everyone believed him at first, but soon other people saw it too. It took a long time, but finally, everyone agreed with him. He even got a big award for it. Another doctor from FR country found out a long time ago that a certain medicine can help with this sickness.\n\n[Picture: horse and cow footprints in the mud. Mosquitoes like to live here.]\n\n[Picture: a type of mosquito that can make you sick.]\n\n[Picture: another type of mosquito that can make you sick.]\n\nIn the late 19th century, a doctor named Gabriel from IT country learned more about the tiny thing that makes people sick. He found out there are three different types that cause different types of fever. Since then, many doctors from all over the world have been studying it. So we can understand how mosquitoes spread this tiny creature, let's talk about its journey in human blood.\n\nThe tiny creatures that cause fever belong to a group called Plasmodium. There are other names for them, but most people call them Plasmodium. The three types of Plasmodium cause different kinds of fever.\n\nLIFE OF THE TINY CREATURE\n\nThe life of these tiny creatures is very much the same. The main difference is how long it takes them to make more of themselves. Let's start with the creature after it enters the blood and see what it does there. At first, it is thin and like a small stick in shape. It can move a little bit in the blood. Very soon, it goes after one of the red blood bits and slowly makes its way through the wall and into the bit of blood (Fig. 99); here it changes shape and moves around, eating all the\nThere was a little bug living in a tiny thing in our body. This bug slowly hurt the tiny thing, making it unable to work. As it lived and got bigger, it left a dark color inside itself.\n\nWhile the bug lived and got bigger, it also left some trash behind. All living things do this, but since the bug was inside the tiny thing, the trash could not get out until the tiny thing broke open. \n\nAfter about two days, the bug stopped moving, and it started to make more little bugs. In about two or three days, depending on the kind of bug, the tiny thing broke open, and all the little bugs, the dark color, and the trash came out into our body.\n\n[Picture: This is a picture to help you understand the life of the bug. The first picture is a tiny thing in our body. The pictures from 2 to 7 show how the bug grows in the tiny thing.]\n_b'_ _c'_ and _e_ the growth of the tiny bug in the tummy of the\nmosquito, _f_ _g_ _h_ _i_ the growth in the little case on the outer\npart of the mosquito's tummy, _k_ in the spit gland.\n\n[Picture: FIG. 100--Mosquito (_A. maculipennis_) on the\nwall.]\n\n[Picture: FIG. 101--Mosquito (_A. maculipennis_) standing\non a table.]\n\nThese tiny round things are round or somewhat blob-like and are carried in the\nblood for a short time. Very soon, however, each one attacks a new red\ncell and the process of feeding, growth and spore-formation\ncontinues, taking exactly the same time for growth as in the first\ngeneration, so every two days in the case of the _vivax_, and\nevery three days in the case of the _malariae_ a new lot of these\ntiny round things and the accompanying waste products are thrown out into the\nblood. Thus in a very short time many generations of this tiny bug happen\nand thousands or hundreds of thousands of the red blood cells are\ndestroyed, leaving the person weak. It will be seen, too,\nthat the recurrence of the chills and fevers is simultaneous with the\nLittle bugs can leave the blood cells, along with the yucky stuff they make.\n\nThis yucky stuff is not good for us, and people think that a lot of it in our blood at once can make us feel really bad. Scientists who study animals know that this way of making more little bugs, without any joining of two different cells, can't go on forever, and those who were looking at how these little bugs live didn't know where the part of life where boys and girls are needed happened. In the meantime, looking at other bugs that are kind of like these little bugs showed that the boy-girl part happened outside the animal. The amazing work of Dr. Samuel on the life of the bug that makes cows in TX country feel bad had a big effect in looking for this other part of the little bug's life. Another thing that showed that this boy-girl part must happen outside the body of the animal was the fact that the scientists saw that the bugs in some of the cells did not make more little bugs like the others did. When these bugs were taken out of the blood and put on a slide to look at, it was seen that they would get big and free themselves from the cell around them and some of them would send out long bits that would move fast\nfar away among the tiny things.\n\nMany people have thought about this, but maybe we will always thank Patrick and Ronald the most. Patrick is a top expert on illnesses you get in warm places, and Ronald was a doctor in the English army. Reading about how Patrick thought of an idea and how Ronald kept believing in this idea and worked hard to show it was right, is very inspiring. It was a big piece of work about the world around us, and shows what a person can do even when things are very tough.\n\n\nTHE LITTLE BAD THING IN THE MOSQUITO\n\nTo say it again, the problem was this: We have here a little bad thing in the blood which behaves like many other life forms. Some of these little bad things do not grow until they are taken out of the blood. Now, how are they taken out of the blood usually? This must first be figured out before the still bigger and more important problem of how the little bad thing gets from one person to another can be thought about. In thinking about this, Patrick believed that certain bugs that suck blood were the ones through which blood was most often taken out of the body, and he made a guess that this change in the little bad thing that can be seen happening under the microscope, normally happens in\nsome bug that likes to eat people's blood. A man named Ryan was very\ninterested in this idea and started his big and hard job of finding these tiny things in the tummy of a bug. When we\nthink that they are so small that they can only be seen with a very good microscope we can understand how big his job was. Ryan, who was living in a far away land,\nchose the mosquito as the bug he thought might have what he was looking for. For over two and one-half years he worked but didn't find anything, even after looking at many \nthousands of mosquitoes.\n\nMost of his work was done on the most common mosquito of the\nplace, a type of _Culex_. But one day a friend sent him a different\nmosquito, one with spotted wings, and while looking at it he was interested\nto see certain oval or round things on the outside walls of the stomach.\nOn looking closer he found that each of these things had a\nfew tiny pieces of the dark black stuff of a fever. More\nwork and tests showed that these special things could always\nbe found in the walls of the tummy of this type of\nmosquito a few days after it had bitten a person with the fever. This\nvery important finding was made a long time ago. David was asked by the English government to devote all his time to solve a problem. After two years of careful study, he was able to tell the full story of a tiny bug. His studies have been done many times, and the results he found are as true as anything we know in science.\n\nThe whole story of this tiny bug can be told like this: The bugs grow within the blood but some of them seem to move around and do not grow there. When these certain bugs are eaten by most mosquitoes they are chewed up with the rest of the blood. But when they are eaten by a certain kind of mosquito they are not chewed up but continue to grow, join together and make more bugs, ending up in a longer form which moves through the walls of the mosquito's stomach. On the outside of the stomach are formed the little lumps found by David on his mosquitoes. Within these lumps, more division and growth happen until finally the lump is broken open and many tiny stick-like bugs, are released into the mosquito's body. Because of some unknown reason, these tiny bugs are gathered together in the big cells of the\nThere are tiny bugs that live inside the small tubes in a mosquito's mouth. When a mosquito bites a person or other animal, these tiny bugs go into the body.\n\nInside the mosquito, there can be lots of these tiny bugs. Some mosquitoes can have many, many tiny bugs.\n\nIt takes about ten to twenty days for the bugs to get ready to go into a person's body. The time it takes depends on how warm it is. After the mosquito bites a person, it takes about ten to twenty days before it can make another person sick. But the bugs can stay in the mosquito's mouth for a few weeks. The mosquito doesn't give all the bugs away at once, so it can make several people sick.\n\nSometimes, two bugs can be in the same place at the same time. This usually happens when there are a lot of bugs. But a doctor named David has shown that sometimes two bugs can join together. When this happens, the new bug can't be hurt by medicine and can stay hidden for a while.\nsickness can stay in your body for a long time. If things are good, it can start to grow again and you will feel sick again.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nLet's talk about why we think that the fever can only be passed on by mosquitoes. First, we understand how the sickness grows, it has been studied in both of its hosts. There have been tries to grow it in other hosts but they did not work, and we understand from the general behavior of the sickness that it needs to have this male and female as well as the single generations. Second, in some places which would seem to be fever areas, that is, where the foggy mists arise, no fever happens. Why? Usually it can be shown that no mosquitoes are there. Other bugs may be there a lot, but if no mosquitoes, there is no fever. In certain places this is well shown. The west side of AF country is one of the worst places for fever and mosquitoes. The east side has no fever and no mosquitoes. In many islands the same condition happens. On the other hand, the FI islands have mosquitoes but no fever. No fever has ever been brought there to infect the\nbugs. In the same way some bugs live in some of the islands and yet there is no sickness there.\n\nTRIALS\n\nWe may look at, too, a few of the important trials that have shown that bad fever can be caught in no other way than through the bite of the bug.\n\nFor many years Gabriel, a man from IT country, gave almost all his time to the study of the bad fever. In the early 20th century, he got permission from the government to try out his ideas on the workers of a piece of train road that was being made through a bad fever area. This was divided for the purpose of the trial into three parts, a safe part in the middle and an unsafe part at each end.\n\nThose working in the safe part had their houses completely covered with nets and no one was allowed out of the house after sunset unless they were protected with covers and gloves. Early in the time they were all given doses of a medicine to prevent self-infection. In the unsafe part no nets were used and every one was allowed to go without special protection. The outcome for the summer was that there were no new cases of fever in the safe part. In the unsafe parts almost all had the fever as usual.\n\n[Pictures: Picture 102--Swamp bug]\nStanding on a table.\n\n[Picture: Fig. 103--A bug hanging from the ceiling.]\n\nIn the same year, two doctors, Samuel and Liam, went to a place we'll call IT country. They built a little house in a swampy area known for being a place where people got sick a lot. The house was covered with screens so that no bugs could get in, but the windows were always open to let the fresh air in day and night. Here they lived for three months. They could play outside as much as they wanted during the day, but at night they stayed inside where they were safe from the bugs. They didn't take any medicine and they didn't get sick, even though people around them were getting sick like normal.\n\nAnother doctor, Adam, who had never been to places where people get this kind of sickness let himself be bitten by sick bugs sent from a place where people get sick a lot. After some time, he got the sickness too. There have been many other tests done in different places that we could talk about. The results have all been pretty much the same. Today, soldiers from many countries are told to protect themselves from bugs because it has been found that it helps. Being sick has always been scarier than bullets in any fight, and we are quickly learning that a lot of the sicknesses that we thought we couldn't avoid can actually be prevented by keeping things clean and safe from bad bugs.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\nBUGS AND A SICKNESS\n\nA sickness happens in places near the sea. The UN city had more of this sickness than any other place. This sickness only happens in very warm places but sometimes bugs carry it to cooler places where it can make many people sick until it gets cold.\n\nPlaces like VE city, HA city, RJ city, and the AF coast were where this sickness happened a lot, sometimes spreading to other places. In the UN city, the places near the big sea have had the most of this sickness, even going as far as BA city, PH city, and WA city, where sometimes it got very bad, but got better when it got cold.\n\nThe last bad time was in NE city in a time long ago when many people got sick and many people died. At that time, there was a big fight against this scary sickness. Thanks to science, especially three men who worked very hard, one of whom gave his life for it, the fight was successful and this scary sickness was stopped just when it was needed.\nIt should have been at its best according to what happened before.\n\nThis good thing, which would have been seen as amazing at other times, was not due to the normal way of keeping people apart or keeping a place closed off. It happened because of a direct fight with mosquitoes: the mosquitoes of a certain kind.\n\nBefore we talk about this good thing in NE city, let's think about the people who made such good things happen.\n\nFor a long time, doctors and people who study things could not understand why this sickness happened and how it spread. Very early, people thought that it might move through the air, and the fact that people usually got sick near water and in hot places or in the middle of summer made people think that the sickness was because of stuff breaking down. This idea was believed more when people found out that serious sickness often came after ships from hot places came into the port with bad water in their parts. When it was found that tiny living things were the cause of stuff breaking down and also of many sicknesses, this idea was thought to be very true. Sometimes, people have said that they have found the exact tiny living thing that causes the sickness, but there has always been something missing in the end.\nYellow fever is a big sickness. People have been very careful to stay away from sick people. They have also been careful about places where the sickness is. But these things have not worked very well. The sickness did not stop even when sick people were kept away from others. Some people got sick even when they had not been near a sick person. Other people were around the sickness a lot but did not get sick. People who got sick once and then got better did not usually get sick again.\n\nPeople saw that some places were more dangerous than others. A long time ago, people found out that they could stay safe by going to the mountains when it was warm. They also saw that people who slept on the first floor got sick more often than those on the higher floors.\nthe upstairs.\n\nTHE YELLOW FEVER TEAM\n\nA long time ago, when AM country people were living in CU country, a sickness called yellow fever spread a lot. A group of doctors was asked to go to Havana to learn about the sickness because they had a good chance to do so. This group, which was called the Yellow Fever Team, was made up of Drs. William, James, Jessica, and Adam from the US Army. Adam was from CU country and he was safe from the sickness, the others were not safe. Dr. Matthew in his talks about Tropical Medicines says of them:\n\n     \"I must say something about the smartness, the hard work, the talent, the bravery, and the humility and simplicity of the leader of that amazing group of workers. If any\n     man deserved a monument to his memory, it was William. If any group of\n     men deserve recognition from their fellow countrymen, it is\n     William's colleagues.\"\n\nTheir first job was to find out if any of the tiny bugs that people said caused yellow fever were really the cause.\nSickness. A small germ that some people thought caused the sickness was looked at closely, but it was found to only be a helper germ.\n\nDr. Charles from Havana believed for many years that the yellow sickness was spread by mosquitoes and maybe other bugs too. He even said he had proven this idea with tests. But we know now that his tests had mistakes and that his patients got the sickness from other things he wasn't studying.\n\nThe Yellow Sickness Team decided to test this idea and got some volunteers for the tests. The first thing was to let a sick mosquito bite a person who had never been sick before. How this was done and what happened, can be told in Dr. Cameron's own words.\n\nTESTS\n\n     \"There were now two separate things to look at: one, the study of the\n     tiny things living in the tummy and tests on the blood and different body parts; \n     the other, the idea of the sickness being spread by the mosquito, which had been \n     suggested by Dr. Carlos in 1881. After thinking about it, it was decided to \n     look at the mosquito idea first. Then came the big question about using people for learning new things. It was agreed that if we learned something, it would be worth it. It was suggested that we also try it on ourselves. This idea was agreed to by Dr. Ryan and Dr. Liam. Dr. Ryan had to go back to the US and Dr. Liam started the work. He let mosquitoes that could make people sick bite some people, including himself. But nothing happened. On a summer afternoon, Dr. Liam let one of these mosquitoes bite me. This mosquito was grown in our learning place. It had bitten four people who were sick with a bad sickness, two very sick and two not so bad. The first person, who was very sick, was bitten twelve days before. The next three people were bitten six, four, and two days before. They were not so sick, very sick, and not so sick. That night, I wrote to Dr. Ryan about what happened.\njoked that if bugs could make people sick, I would be really sick. And it happened. I started feeling a bit bad for two days, and got sick at the end of summer. The next day, I was taken to the sick camp. My life was really unsure for three days, and the doctors found something bad in my pee on day five, six, and seven. On the day I got sick, at the end of summer, Dr. Liam used the same bug on another person who got sick but not as bad as me and got better before I could even leave my bed. It turned out that I was the first person to get sick from a bug bite.\n\nIn the middle of fall, five days after I could leave my bed, Dr. Liam got sick, and went away a week later, after a few days of not making sense and throwing up something dark. This is what sickness from bugs is like.\n\nHe was bitten by a random bug while he was using other bugs.\nto someone in a city hospital. He didn't know it was a kind of bug, and thought it was another. The bug bit him, but he didn't think much of it until he got sick. He told me about it when he got sick. I remember how scared he looked the last time I saw him. He was very sick and started to throw up. I was too weak to see him like that, and there was nothing I could do to help him.\n\n\"Dr. Liam left a wife and two little kids, one of whom he had never seen.\"\n\nThese tries and many others like them done on soldiers and people from a faraway country showed that this bug could make people sick if certain things happened.\n\n1. The bug must bite the person during the first three days of the fever; after that, a fevered person cannot make a bug sick.\n\n2. Twelve days must pass before the bug can\nhurt another person. After that she may hurt anyone she may touch;\nthat is, the bad bugs stay strong during the rest of the bug's\nlife. The FR country Yellow Fever Team working in RJ city say\nthat the first baby bugs from such a hurt bug is\nable to cause the sickness after they are fourteen days in the grown-up\ncondition.\n\nThe next step was to find out whether the sickness could be gotten\nin any other way than by the touch of hurt bugs. A camp named\nCamp L was made and the following tests done: A\nbug-proof house of one room was completely split by a wire\nscreen from floor to ceiling. In one room fifteen bugs that had\nbefore touched yellow fever people and had gone through the proper\ntime of waiting were let go. In this room a person who was not sick exposed\nhimself so that he was touched by several of the bugs. A little later\nthe same day and again the next day the bugs were allowed to touch\nhim for a few minutes. Five days later, the usual waiting period,\nhe got yellow fever.\n\nAt the same time that he went into the house two other persons\nwent into the other room where they slept for eighteen nights\nseparated from the bugs by the wire screen. They showed no signs\nof getting the fever.\n\nIn another bug-proof house two boys and a doctor, all\nSome folks lived for three weeks. Sometimes, they got dirty things like bed sheets and clothes straight from the hospital in the town. These things had been dirtied by sick people. These things were touched and moved every day, but no one got sick. After the three weeks, two other folks took their place and handled new clothes the same way, sleeping in the same sheets that had been used by a very sick person. They tried to expose themselves in all ways to the dirty clothes. But no one got sick. We found out later that these folks could get sick when we tested on some of them, and they did get sick.\n\nIn another test, some men in a camp let bugs bite them. These bugs had waited the right amount of time and every one of the men, and no one else, got sick. It was also shown that a bug could make you sick even fifty-seven days after it had bitten a sick person. Another set of tests showed that if you put a very small amount of blood from a sick person into someone who could get sick, in the first two or three days of being sick, would\nmake the fever.\n\nSIMPLE EXPLANATION\n\nA long time ago, many people studied the same thing. They worked alone or with teams from FR country and EN country. They all found out similar things:\n\n1. The fever comes from something in the blood that is not part of the blood cells. Even without the blood cells, it can still make people sick.\n\n2. The fever spreads from one person to another through a certain kind of mosquito, and not in any other way.\n\n3. A sick person can only spread the fever in the first few days after they start feeling sick.\n\n4. The mosquito must wait about two weeks after biting a sick person before it can spread the fever.\n\n5. The thing that causes the fever is too small to see, even with a very strong looking glass. It is not a kind of germ that we know, but it could be a tiny creature. Some experts think it might be a certain type of tiny creature.\n\nSo what does this all mean? It means that many people will be safe every year. It means getting rid of a scary sickness from many places and maybe even from the whole world soon. This sickness has scared people since the first time they lived on this land. It means that some places where it was dangerous for people to go will now be safe. It means that when this yellow sickness happens in a place, we don't need to stop people from coming and going anymore. This stopping used to make people lose a lot of money in business.\n\nIn a place called HA city, they first used these ideas in a real way. The group that studies the yellow sickness gave their ideas in the late 20th century. In the next two years, these ideas were used. The number of people who died there in ten years shows how well these ideas worked:\n\nPEOPLE WHO DIED IN HA CITY FROM YELLOW SICKNESS\n\n-----+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------\n     | late 19th century | late 19th century | late 19th century | late 19th century | late 19th century | late 19th century | late 19th century | late 20th century | late 20th century | early 20th century\n-----+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------\nWinter |  big number  | small number |  big number  | medium number  | very big number | small number | very small number | medium number | small number | none\nIn the second month, there were some things happening. In the third month, few things happened. In the fourth month, more things happened. In the fifth month, even more things happened. A lot happened in the sixth month. In the seventh month, a lot of things happened, and it was very busy. In the eighth month, it was the busiest.\nIn the fall, there were numbers that changed. First, they went down, then they went up, and then they went down again. They were different every month. \n\nWhen the US was in charge of HA city, they made sure that a sickly fever, caused by pesky bugs, didn't spread. But when they stopped watching so closely, the fever started to show up again. The people in HA city realized that they had to keep fighting the bugs if they wanted to stay healthy. \n\nTHE BATTLE IN NE CITY\n\nOne sunny season in a time long past, there was a chance to use what was learned from these tests in a real-life situation. Samuel says in a popular book, that was written a while ago, about the\nOnce upon a time:\n\n     \"Eight years ago, a mosquito illness had spread in the big,\n     busy, happy city in the south. Not knowing the real\n     steps of the illness, the city of NE fought it without knowing,\n     in a big scare, and when the cold weather put\n     a stop to the city's problem, she was tired and weak.\n     The yellow sickness of the time after came with a bigger and more surprising\n     quickness than that of before. It began like a secret and\n     armed uprising in the heart of the city, complete and scary.\n     But there stood against it the prepared line of science\n     learning. Believing, with a good courage of trust that most\n     important safe discovery since vaccine, the mosquito\n     idea, the city arranged her defenses. This time there\n     was no scare, no rule by scared lots of people, no running away\n     from shock to crazy action; but instead the\n     joining of the whole city in an army of cleanliness. Every\n     person became a soldier of the public health. And when, a long\n     time before the illness-killing cold came, the fight was over, the city\nThe town of OR had not only won the biggest health battle ever seen in AM country, but also a rule for which the whole country should thank her.\"\n\nFor a while, the leaders had been trying to hide that the sickness was there, but seeing how fast it was growing made them understand that only everyone working together could help. The People's Help Groups were made to fight the bugs that were everywhere. To many, the battle seemed impossible. The long open drains, the many tanks and small puddles of water were perfect for the bugs to grow. The drains and ponds were emptied or salted, the tanks were covered, sick houses were cleaned, but the sickness kept growing. Rains filled the drains again, winds took off the covers from the tanks, the people who didn't know much in the FR part of the town didn't want to help. Finally, the town asked for help from the Big Leader. Doctor William and some other officers and men from the US Public Health and Help Hospital Service came to take over the work. They continued with the same plan as before with the same goal in mind. But when the regular helpers came, the work was done more carefully. Every sick person was treated as if they had a bad fever and steps were taken to keep bugs from biting such a person. The homes where the fever happened were cleaned thoroughly to get rid of any bugs that might be there, and the area was carefully searched to find any places where the bugs might be living. The helpers were so sure that the bug was the only cause of the sickness spreading, that they only focused on fighting it and making the sick people as comfortable as possible.\n\nFinally, the plan started to work. The number of sick people started to go down, and before the cold came, the town was safe from the big sickness. The bad fever will likely come back now and then in NE city and other places, but the risk of another big sickness is small, because people now know how the sickness comes and how to treat it.\n\nNot long ago, I had to write to a bug expert named Adam in Louisiana to get some examples of the bad fever bug for lab work. The following part from his reply will show something of the work that is still being done there.\n\n\"I am scared we can't provide examples of _Stegomyia_, despite the fact that Louisiana is _thought_ to be the most favorite\nhome of these bugs in the South. Since the light showing of\n     yellow fever in this place in the late 20th century, a very big fight has been\n     kept up against the bugs, and the rules of all LA cities and big towns need the draining of all breeding\n     places of this bug and the constant oiling or screening of all\n     water holders. The result is this bug is\n     very rare. Here in BA city I only see one once in a while, and it would take maybe a lot of days' work at the\n     present time to get as good bugs and as many of them as you\n     need.\"\n\n\nIN THE PC ZONE\n\nYellow fever was one of the worst things that the FR country\nwhen they were trying to build the canal. The story of the\nsuffering and death from this bad disease there is very sad.\nShip after ship of workers were sent over, as those who had\ngone earlier fell to the fever. The people in charge\nwere responsible\nfor their men while they were sick and to avoid having to pay\nhospital costs the men were often let go as soon as they showed\nsigns of sickness. Many of them died along the road while\ntrying to get to a place where they could find help. The hospitals were usually full of sick people with a very bad fever, and lots of them did not get better.\n\nNot just the workers got sick, but also many of the people who were supposed to help them. Lots of these helpers also got the bad fever and didn't get better. It is said that lots of helpers from a far away country called FR country came on a boat and in a month after they got there, all but one of them got the bad fever. Out of many nurses who came to help at one time, lots of them got the fever, and during one month many members of the hospital's helper team didn't get better.\n\nOne of the first things that the big boss of our place did when starting work in the canal place was to fight the bad fever. In a place called PA city where the water for home use was kept in big pots and barrels, people were chosen to make sure all such pots and other places where bad bugs could live were kept covered. After the first check-up, lots of bug homes were reported. About half a year later there were much less. Similar work was done in all the towns and settlements along the canal. In addition to this fight against the bad fever, they also fought against another type of bad bug. The changes have been good. People don't get sick with yellow fever a lot in this area anymore, and fewer people get sick from malaria. The last time someone got yellow fever was a long time ago. Before, going into this area was dangerous. Now, it's a safe place to live. In fact, it's safer than some parts of our own country where we don't do a good job keeping people healthy.\n\nIN FR country\n\nIn FR country, they still have a problem with mosquitoes, even though they spend a lot of money trying to get rid of them. But people who aren't immune to the diseases they carry protect themselves by doing their work in FR during the day and going back at night to PE city, a safe place far away and high up where the mosquitoes aren't found.\n\nThey believe there that the yellow fever mosquito doesn't bite during the day after she has had her babies, and that she won't have her babies until about three days after she has had a meal of blood. So a mosquito that bites during the day won't give you yellow fever because she is too young. This seems to explain why the sickness can't be\nbitten by a bug during the day. But, other tries have shown different things. So, we think it's not safe to be bitten by such a bug in a place where the sickness is common or where it is spreading.\n\nThe work of the FR team working in RI city has mostly agreed with the findings of the AM team. One special thing that the FR team seems to have found is that the mommy bug may give the sick-making power to her babies, so that a bug that had never bitten a sick person could still make a healthy person sick. While all this is very likely because of what we know of the sickness and the way in which other sicknesses caused by similar tiny things may be given by the parent to the babies, yet the most careful lookers are waiting for more proof.\n\nHABITS OF BUGS\n\nThe whole fight against the sickness, then is directed, as we have seen, against the bug. The habits of this kind are such as to make it easy in some ways to fight. It is seldom found far away from people's houses. The grown-ups will not fly far. Once in a house they usually stay there except when they leave to place.\ntheir eggs.\n\nOn the other hand, some of these same habits make it all the more\ndangerous. It will breed in almost any kind of water, no matter how\ndirty, and a very small amount will suffice. Thus any leaks from\nwater-pipes or drains, cisterns, small cans of water or any such places\nmay become dangerous breeding-places. If conditions are unfavorable\nthere will often be developed small individuals which can easily make\ntheir way through ordinary mosquito-netting.\n\nDr. Matthew has pointed out an interesting possible result of the fight\nthat is now being waged against the yellow fever mosquitoes. The\nprotection of the people native to the regions is supposed to be\ndue to their having had mild attacks of the fever during childhood, for\nthe children in these regions are subject to certain fevers which are\nprobably very mild forms of yellow fever.\n\nNow if we kill practically all of the mosquitoes so that these children\ndo not have this fever there will be developed, in due time, a\npopulation most of whom are not protected.\n\nThis freedom from the disease for some time will allow us to grow\ncareless in regard to fighting the mosquitoes. They will be allowed to\nincrease and by some chance the yellow fever will again be introduced\nand there will then be very grave danger of most extensive and\ndestructive sickness.\n\n\nDANGER OF THE SICKNESS IN THE PI ISLANDS\n\nI've talked a bit about what life is like on many islands in the big ocean. On some of these islands, there are lots of different types of bugs, and on some, the most common and annoying bug is the kind that can make people sick. All the people who live on these islands have never been sick with this disease because it's never been there before. But if we're not careful, the sickness might get there one day and it could be very, very bad. The weather and cleanliness of these places and the ways that people live there are perfect for this sickness to grow and spread. From what I've seen of these islands, I think it would be very hard to stop the sickness before it had a chance to hurt a lot of people. \n\nNow that we've made a big canal, it's even more likely that these things might happen. Before, the boats that went to these islands didn't come from places where the sickness was common. But if we let the sickness get to the canal area, the danger could get a lot bigger. \n\nPeople from other places have already brought enough trouble to the people who live on these islands by bringing other sicknesses, and we can only hope that this big, bad sickness won't be another thing that our way of life brings to them. The good things that our way of life can bring have often been rightly\nWhat I shared about these islands is also true and sometimes even more true for parts of AS country, the EA land and other places.\n\nStory IX\n\nLittle Bugs and The Sickness\n\nThe Sickness has always been one of the most scary illnesses, and when we hear of how much it hurt people in the old times and how the people couldn't do anything about it, it's no surprise the name of it scared them. One of the worst times it happened started in EG country around a long time ago, and it moved along the big sea to EU country and AS country. It kept coming back for many years, happening again and again in the same place and making lots of people sick.\n\nAnother big time it happened, starting in a very long time ago, spread all over the world people knew about then and was very bad. Because it made people get dark spots under their skin, it was called the \"dark sickness\" and of course it scared all the people where it happened. Whole towns and areas were emptied. A lot of people didn't make it, one person guessing the total number at twenty-five million.\n\nDuring this time new places where people got sick were found, and since then it has been moved by things people buy and sell to all parts of the world. It's not stuck, like many other illnesses that spread, to the\nwarm places, even though, in truth, we find it is more often in these places because of the clean conditions.\n\nHOW SICKNESS WAS STOPPED IN SF CITY\n\nWe look at these things so that we can compare old conditions with now. In the past years, SF city has been fighting a sickness that in other times would have been a big problem. But with new ways of handling it, understanding what it is, what makes it and how it spreads, the people in charge there have been able to not just keep the sickness under control, but nearly to stop it with few people getting hurt.\n\nDr. Benjamin from the Public Health and his friends directed all their energy toward controlling the rats. A lot of men were used, catching rats in every part of the city. Dr. Ryan says that a million rats were caught in this campaign. Their breeding-places were destroyed by making cellars, woodsheds, warehouses, etc., safe from rats and removing all old rubbish. Trash cans were put in all parts of the city, as it was needed that all trash be kept where rats could not eat it, and all together every effort was made to make it as uncomfortable as possible\nfor the small animals.\n\nThe good result of this work shows the idea it was based on was right. This is another way that learning is showing us how to stop or control many of our big sicknesses.\n\nTHE IE COMMITTEE\n\nIn a time long ago, a very bad sickness happened in the BR city and spread to other parts of IN country. Later, a group was chosen to find out where the different sicknesses started, how the disease is passed on, and so on. This was known as the IE Committee, and its full report, along with the notes of the things shown to the group, represents a lot of work on this subject and is the reason for much of the later looking into that has been done.\n\nAfter looking at the things from different places the group decided that the main way of sickness both for people and small animals was through some sort of a cut in the skin, even though it also thought about the chance of sickness through the nose and mouth, and maybe, very rarely, through the inside of the body or other places.\n\nA lot of time was spent in thinking about Dr. Samuel's idea, made a while ago, that small bugs which have been living on sick small animals move when their hosts die and carry the sickness to healthy ones.\npeople and rats. Dr. Samuel wanted to show these things:\n\n     \"First, that sick rats are very bad when they have fleas and they\n     become better when the fleas leave them. Second, that fleas from \n     sick rats have bad germs. Third, that other animals can get sick \n     from the rats even if they don't touch the rats or their dirt. \n     Fourth, that fleas will move from rats to people.\"\n\nAfter looking at the tests that had been done, the group thought that not\nenough care had been taken to stop infection from other places and that not enough\nclear proof was given. Against this, a lot of other proof was thought about and the final thought was \"that sucking bugs are not a part of the spreading of the bad sickness.\"\n\nIn the early 20th century, another group of people known as the Helping Committee was\nasked to plan for more studies in IN country and other places,\nespecially about how the sickness spreads.\nThey quickly asked a new working group who started\ntheir studies and tests right away. The first reports of their work, which are still called the Reports of the IP Commission, as well as the reports of additional studies that are being made from time to time, have helped to fully agree with Dr. Samuel's claims and have completely changed the ways of fighting the sickness.\n\nThere are several different kinds of sickness, seeming to depend a lot on how the sickness comes. The most common kind is one that is known as the BP sickness which is known by swellings in different parts of the body. This kind of sickness usually comes through the skin in some way or another. Only rarely does one person give the sickness to another person though there is always a chance of it. The studies have shown that the tiny bug is the most common helper in moving the sickness from rat to rat or from rat to man. This may be done by the tiny bug moving the tiny harmful things directly from one host to another on its nose, or they may be carried in the food tube of the tiny bug and get into the skin through a scratch of some kind when the tiny bug is crushed as it is biting, or when some of the tiny harmful things are left on the skin in the waste of the bug.\n\n\nRESULTS OF VR'S EXPERIMENTS\n\nA very important group of experiments directly related to this topic\nwas created long ago by Dr. David. He didn't share his work with everyone until much later. David did a very good job with his work and found out some important things. He studied bugs that live in beds.\n\n    \"(1) All small bugs that have eaten the blood of sick animals carry sickness.\n\n     \"(2) These small bugs only carry sickness if they have eaten the blood of a sick animal a little while before the animal got very sick.\n\n     \"(3) The sickness stays strong in these bugs.\n\n     \"(4) Sickness can be found in these small bugs for a few days after they have eaten the blood of a very sick animal. In bed bugs, the sickness goes away after a few days if they haven't eaten for a while.\nSome insects who haven't eaten for four to four and a half months can still make animals sick after eight or nine days.\n\n(1) The number of bad germs in the sick bugs grows during the first few days.\n\n(2) The waste of sick bugs has bad germs as long as these germs stay in the bugs' bodies.\n\n(3) Animals can't get sick from the bites of bugs that were made sick by animals with a small amount of bad germs, even if the bugs have a lot of bad germs.\n\n(4) Bugs that have eaten from animals that got sick from a lot of bad germs can make other animals sick by biting them.\n\n(5) Animals that got sick from the bites of infected bugs don't get a big red spot or sometimes no red spot at all. In these cases, we can only guess where the first big lump came from by its position.\nthe place where the yucky bugs got inside the body.\n\n\"(10) Sick bugs can make healthy animals sick for three days after getting sick themselves. Sick bugs can do this for five days.\n\n\"(11) It was found that no more than two animals can get sick from the same bugs.\n\n\"(12) If a sick bug is squished while it is biting, it usually makes the healthy animal sick.\n\n\"(13) The tiny hurt made by the bite of a bug or a flea lets the yucky bugs get inside the body and make the animal very sick.\n\n\"(14) Squished sick bugs and fleas and their poop, like other yucky stuff, can make animals sick through the tiny holes in the skin made by bug and flea bites, but only for a short time after these bites.\n\n\"(15) If clothes or other things are made dirty by squishing sick fleas and bugs on them, or by the poop of these bugs, the yucky bugs can stay alive and\nThe sickness lasts for more than five months.\n\n     \"(16) Cleaning stuff can't usually get rid of the sickness bugs in small bugs that live on rats. \n\n     \"(17) The small bug that lives on a rat does not bite people.\n\n     \"(18) Human bugs do bite rats.\n\n     \"(19) Bugs found on dogs and cats bite both people and rats.\n\n     \"(20) Human bugs and bugs found on cats and dogs can live on rats \n     and can sometimes help in spreading the sickness from rats to people, and vice versa.\"\n\n\nWHAT WE FOUND OUT\n\nDifferent teams from other places and many\npeople have studied the same thing, and what they found out all\nshows that the rats and the bugs are very important in spreading the sickness. The facts\nfrom many places and from many tests can be simply said as\nfollows: The sickness is caused by the tiny bacteria. It is likely that the sickness is mainly a\nsickness of rats and only sometimes, a sickness of people.\n\nRats can get a bad sickness and it often makes many of them very sick. Before people start getting sick, rats usually get sick first.\n\nRats that are sick with this bad sickness have it in their blood. Tiny bugs that bite, like fleas, can bite these sick rats and get the sickness on them.\n\nWhen a rat is very sick, the fleas usually leave it and look for food somewhere else. If these sick fleas bite other rats or small animals, those animals can get sick too. Some kinds of fleas that like to bite rats can bite people too, and sometimes people who get sick have been bitten by fleas.\n\nABOUT FLEAS\n\nWhen we look at how fleas are made and what they do, we see that they can spread sicknesses like this very well. The part they use to bite is like three long needles. It has parts that are like a saw with two edges. The bottom part is split near the base, so it's really like two thin\nlittle parts that are close together and make a small line where the pointy parts sit. When the bug is eating, the pointy parts go into the skin of the one it's eating from, and one part helps guide it. As the sharp parts go deeper, one part bends back like a bow and does not go into the skin. Spit then goes into the spot through tiny lines in the pointy parts, and the red liquid is sucked up into the mouth by a part that sucks which is in the head at the base of the mouth-parts. Just above this pointy part is a pair of flat pieces. When the pointy part is all the way into the skin the ends of these flat pieces may also go into the skin and maybe help make the spot bigger. Attached to these flat pieces is a pair of strong, four-part add-ons, they probably act as feelers.\n\nIf the bug happens to be eating from a sick rat or person, many of the tiny bugs that make you sick will get on the mouth-parts and lots of them are of course sucked up into the stomach with the red liquid. Those on the pointy part may be moved directly to the next one that it is\nWhen fleas bite, they may carry tiny things inside them. Sometimes, these tiny things can come out when the flea is feeding again or when it gets squished by the person or animal it is bothering. This is often how people or animals get sick from fleas because the tiny things can get into the bite or scratch. It's important to get rid of the flea, but be careful not to squish it on the skin.\n\n[Illustration: Picture 1--Flea from a rat (male)]\n\n[Illustration: Picture 2--Flea from a rat (female)]\n\n[Illustration: Picture 3--Close-up of a rat flea's mouth]\n\n[Illustration: Picture 4--Flea from a person (male)]\n\nIn a recent event in a place we'll call \"SA city\", many fleas were studied. These fleas came from people, rats, mice, cats, dogs, squirrels, and other animals. It was found that, while each type of flea has a favorite host, when that host dies, the flea will not hesitate to find a new host, including people or other nearby animals. \n\nCOMMON TYPES OF FLEAS\n\nIn warm places where people often get sick, a small bug found on rats is known as the sick bug. This bug is also found on rats in the SF Bay area and sometimes on people too. In the US, GB and other cooler places, a larger bug is often found on rats. This bug is also found on brown and black rats, house mice and sometimes on people. It has also been found in CA on small burrowing animals and on a striped animal.\n\nThe human bug is found everywhere people live. Even though we think it mainly bothers people, it is also found a lot on cats, dogs, mice and rats as well as on some wild animals like badgers, foxes and others and has sometimes been found on birds.\n\nMost bug experts think the bugs found on cats and dogs as\nSome people think that a certain type of flea is the same whether it's on a dog or a cat. It doesn't really matter to us if the flea that bites us comes from a dog or a cat, because they both hurt the same. These fleas can be a big problem in houses, and can even make a house very hard to live in. They can also be found on rats. \n\nThere are also some small animals called ground-squirrels in a place we'll call CA state. In the early part of the 20th century, a man named Dr. Benjamin thought that these animals might be able to spread a sickness. It was thought that a sickness was killing lots of these animals in areas around a place we'll call SF city, especially in a place we'll call CO county. No one looked at the animals at that time, but since then, lots of them have been looked at very closely.\nSome of them are sick. We might never really know how they got sick. But, it's likely that the sickness moved from the rats to the squirrels. The trains and boats going out from SF city would let the rats move from the city to the big storehouses all over the shore. Once there, they would use the same paths as the squirrels around the storehouses and in the nearby fields. When it's time to gather crops, the rats move to the fields and use the squirrel holes a lot. Farmers in some areas say that they often trap more rats than squirrels in traps set in squirrel holes at that time of the year.\n\nThis close living of the rats and the squirrels gives a good chance for the bugs bothering them to move from one to the other.\n\nUp to now, only two types of bugs have been found on the ground-squirrels. One, type C, is very common, sometimes covering the squirrels, especially if a squirrel is sick or weak for any reason. The other type, type H, is less common but still often seen. Both of these types bother rats too, so the clues are almost all there. We just need to think that once, one or more sick rats found their way to where the squirrels were. The little bugs from the rats went to the squirrels and brought the sickness with them.\n\nThe truth that the sickness has already started among the squirrels is a new and very serious part of the problem of stopping the disease. All who have been around the ground-squirrels will tell about the quickness of the little bugs from them to bite those who are touching them. As it is the sick or weak squirrels that are most often found, there is always a chance that the sickness may be passed from them to people. The reports of the sickness cases in CA land show at least three cases where it seems to be very clear that the sickness came from touching sick squirrels.\n\nHere are two pictures. One is a picture of a human-bug, a female. The other is a picture of a mouse-bug, also a female.\n\nA still more serious thing is the chance of the sickness staying in a strong or weak form among the squirrels for some time, maybe for years, and then starting again in some place where the rats or people may get sick. As long as there are sick squirrels, there is always a chance for the sickness to spread. It could even reach new areas. Those taking care of the situation know about these risks. They are carefully studying the situation and will probably be able to handle it well. It could happen that the squirrels in the sick areas will need to be removed. This would take a lot of time and work. But, as we have seen in the big city, when people really want to do something, they can do it.\n\nHOW TO DEAL WITH ITCHY BUGS\n\nWe have seen how a big city worked hard to get rid of the sick rats. In truth, it was not just the rats they were targeting. If the rats did not carry itchy bugs, the city would have been okay with letting the sickness take care of the rats. But they found that the only way to get rid of the itchy bugs that could carry the sickness was to get rid of the rats.\n\nCleaning up in general will surely reduce the number of itchy bugs around homes. But, there could still be itchy bugs in the house that are really bothersome, even if there is no danger.\n\nThis is often the case in homes where cats or dogs live. These pets always have a few fleas, and where there are a few, there may be a lot more unless we try to get rid of them.\n\nIn some areas, the fleas from cats and dogs bother people the most. The tiny white eggs of the fleas are usually laid where these animals sleep and the small active babies that come from them eat any stuff they can find in the dust or in small spaces. About eight or ten days after hatching the babies make delicate brown homes in which they become adult fleas a few days later.\n\nSo, it's important to give cats and dogs clean places to sleep. If they have a mat or blanket, this can be picked up and shaken often and the dust can be cleaned up and burned. This way, many eggs or babies may be destroyed. Very often, the dust under a carpet that has not been cleaned for a while will be found to be full of fleas or their babies. In some cases, cleaning the carpet and floors well helps. Houses that nobody uses for some time in the hot months often have a lot of bugs when the leaves start falling. This is because the bugs got a chance to grow and have many babies. These rooms need a good clean. Sometimes, you can get rid of the bugs by using a lot of bug powder. Dr. Samuel's note in the Big Bug Book is good to remember.\n\n     \"Last spring, I moved into a house that no one had lived in before. There was no carpet and only a few rugs on the floors because it was hot. We had a big dog and three fluffy cats in our house. Soon, we started seeing bugs. I did not count them, but there were a lot. When you woke up and stepped on the floor, you would find many bugs on your feet. The usual ways to get rid of bugs are either strong or a little\nUnhappy. The big solution is to send the pets to places where they can't breathe, or take the other idea, 'Don't have pets.'\n\n\"I tried cleaning the floors with a strong mix of cleaner but it didn't help much. My old try with bug spray didn't work well. Knowing the strong smell of mothballs in hot weather and how it can make you cough made me want to try it. I picked one room, spread five pounds of mothball flakes on the floor and closed it for one day. When you walk into such a room, the mothball smell will make your eyes water and make you cough. I say this to show how it works on the bugs. It turned out to be a great and effective fix and not costly, as the mothballs could be picked up and moved to other rooms. As far as I'm concerned, the bug problem is solved and if I have more issues I know the fix. I plan to keep the dog.\nand the cats.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nOTHER SICKNESS, MOSTLY WARM, KNOWN OR THOUGHT TO BE SPREAD BY\nBUGS\n\n\nSLEEPY SICKNESS\n\nOne of the worst sickness of AF country and one that is to-day getting\nlots of attention is the disease known as sleepy sickness, one of the most scary\nsickness that we know.\n\nAmong the small living things referred to in one of the earlier chapters mention\nwas made of certain small things which live in the blood of man and\ncertain animals. Very little was known concerning these small living things\nbefore the start of the now century, but since that time\nseveral have been found to be of big importance. The group is\nbeing studied a lot and every day our knowledge of them is\nincreasing so that we now know quite a lot about them.\n\nA certain small living thing, a small thing that lives in rats, is perhaps the best known as\nit is always common where-ever rats are found. Sometimes as many as 30%\nor 40% of the rats of certain areas are infected. It is thought that\nthese are passed from rat to rat by the common rat-bug which\nserves as a helper. Fleas may also help to spread\nSome bugs cause really bad sickness in animals, but right now we are talking about one that's causing a lot of problems in an AF country. This bug was found out in the past and was given a long, tricky name. Since then, people found out that it's everywhere. Even though the local people have probably been sick from this bug for a long time, more people coming to these places and the moving around of the locals made the sickness spread a lot. Now, whole areas are empty because people are dying or running away from this scary sickness.\n\nThis sickness can take a few months or even years to happen. The signs of the sickness can change, but usually, you get a fever soon after catching it, which can be a little bad or very bad, and happens now and then. Some parts of the body might get bigger. Spots might appear all over the body and the person slowly becomes weak and tired, both in body and mind. The bug seems to mess with the brain, either directly or by making poisons. The person becomes even more tired and sad with more and more sleepiness, that's why it's called the sleeping sickness. As the deep sleep gets worse, the person loses all\nThe story is about a small bug that can make you feel very tired and hungry. You can get really weak and there is no way to get better once you get very sick from it.\n\nWe know that a type of bug, which we will call \"big bug\", is the one causing this sickness. Some people also think that a certain type of mosquito can also bring the sickness from one person to another. We are not sure how exactly the big bug gives the sickness, but it's possible that it also gets sick and then passes it on, just like how a mosquito does with a certain illness. It's different from the regular housefly, which only brings germs with it but doesn't actually get sick itself.\n\nThe big bug only lives in hot parts of AF country and is only found in certain areas near the water. If you stay away from these places, you should be safe. People who are trying to stop the sickness found out that if they clean up the area around water places, those places become safer. Some flies do not lay eggs. Instead, they make full-grown baby flies which soon turn into a cocoon in the dirt.\n\nBIG LEG SICKNESS\n\nIn many hot regions, human blood and the blood of other animals is where certain worm-like bugs live. They are not only in hot places but may also be found far up into the less hot places. We know about five or six different types of these bugs, but only one of them is harmful to humans.\n\n[Picture: FIG. 111--_Trypanosoma gambiense_; different shapes from blood and brain fluid.]\n\n[Picture: FIG. 112--Tsetse-fly.]\n\nThis bug, called FB, is not only found everywhere, but in places like some of the islands in the big ocean, many of the people have these bugs in their blood. When these bugs are taken out from the blood and put on a slide to look at, they are seen to be tiny clear, colorless, snake-like bugs covered in a very thin bag. They are very small and about as big around.\nlike tiny red dots. These tiny red dots are baby bugs that have been named small bugs by Mr. David.\n\nIf we check the skin of a person feeling sick during the day, we may not find any of these baby bugs. But, if we check the skin in the evening or early in the morning, we may find many of them. During the day, they hide in big blood vessels and in the lungs, where we can find a lot of them.\n\nThis coming out at night has been found to be a very special thing in the life of the bug. It has been shown that in order to grow, these baby bugs must be eaten by a mosquito. Most of the mosquitoes, which help the bugs grow, bite at night, so the bugs are taken in with the blood of the person. Once inside the mosquito's tummy, they quickly get out from their covers and go through the walls of the tummy and enter the muscle, especially the muscles in the chest. Here they change and grow very big, some becoming as big as a small dot.\n\nAfter sixteen to twenty days they leave these muscles and make their way\nto other parts of the body. A few may be found in different parts of the\ntummy, but most of them move to the head of the\nbug and coil themselves up close to the base of the long mouth,\nfinally moving down into the long mouth inside the lip part.\nHere they lie until they get a chance to escape to the warm\nblood of an animal. They probably pass through the thin skin\nconnecting the lip parts with the long mouth and there find their way into\nthe wound made by the bite when the bug bites. Whether these\nlittle creatures can get into the blood system in any other\nway is not known. It has been thought that the bugs dying and\nbreaking apart on the surface of water may let the little creatures free which\nmay later get into the system of the animal host when the\nwater is used for drinking, but most of the studies made so far\nseem to show that they move directly from the long mouth\ninto the new host.\n\nSoon after getting into the blood system of the human host the\nlittle creatures move into the lymphatics where they become adults,\nand in due time new generations of the tiny creatures or\nmicrofilariae are poured into the lymph, and finally into the blood\nvessels, ready to be sucked up by the next bug that feeds on\nAdam was not feeling well.\n\nSometimes, when tiny creatures live in our blood, we don't feel sick at all. They are likely never harmful when they are still babies, or when we find them in our blood moving around our body.\n\nHowever, there are times when the grown-up forms of these tiny creatures living in our lymphatics can cause big problems. The worst problem is a scary and yucky illness that makes certain parts of our body swell and change shape. An arm or a leg may grow much bigger than it should be, or other parts of our body may change a lot.\n\nIn some faraway islands, 3 to 4 out of every 10 people have this problem. Some people only a little, others a lot. It doesn't usually hurt, but when it's really bad, the changed parts can make the person unable to move.\n\nWe don't know exactly how the tiny creatures cause such swelling. David, who has studied these diseases more than anyone else, thinks that the problem comes from the clogging of the lymphatic glands or trunks, making them unable to connect with the rest of the circulation, which might cause the affected parts to change shape. This clogging is thought to be caused by a lot of baby eggs that are released by the tiny creatures when they are hurt.\nSome creatures are not able to lay their eggs in the right way.\n\nWhen the fluids in your body don't move as they should, you could get sick. You might have a bad sickness, but not as many germs in your body as someone who is not as sick. This could happen because the germs that make you sick have died. Also, the paths that the tiny germs take in your body might be blocked. These tiny germs might not be able to move around your body. So, you might not be able to make a mosquito sick as easily as someone who is not as sick as you.\n\nPeople used to think that we couldn't do much to help if you got this sickness. But, a doctor from FR country, who has been trying many things on some islands, said that he can make many people better. He does this by doing certain special actions on the sick parts of the body.\n\nDENGUE OR \"BREAKBONE FEVER\"\n\nThis is another sickness that is found a lot in hot places. It often happens a lot at the same time. It is probably most often found in the WI islands, but it can happen in any hot country or island. Sometimes it spreads into slightly hot or even places that are not very hot. It has spread a lot in the US country. Once it comes into a place where people live, it spreads very quickly and nothing seems to stop it from happening again.\n\nPeople have given it different names like breakbone fever, dandy-fever, and others. These names describe how the sick person feels. While it can make a person feel very bad, it usually does not cause death.\n\nPeople used to think it could easily spread from one person to another. However, recent findings suggest that a certain tiny creature found in the blood of sick people might cause it. Dr. Gabriel has done some experiments that suggest mosquitoes might spread it. In his experiments, he used a common mosquito found in hot places. The same tiny creature found in people's blood was also found in the mosquitoes' stomach and blood up to five days after they bit a sick person.\n\nSick and healthy people were allowed to stay together in a room without mosquitoes, and the sickness did not spread. Mosquitoes that had bitten sick people were taken to a place where the sickness had never happened and allowed to bite two.\nHealthy people. Both got sick but because they were kept away from other bugs until they were better, the sickness didn't spread to others. This makes us believe that this is how the sickness spreads, and most doctors believe this too. They try to stop the sickness from spreading by making sure the sick person doesn't get bitten by bugs.\n\nThe bug that usually makes people sick with this disease might not be the only one that can do it. If this is true, it would explain why the sickness spreads quickly when it gets into a group of people. It usually happens when it's hot outside and there are a lot of bugs.\n\nThere's also another sickness that happens in hot places and sometimes in cooler places too, like in the US. You start feeling sick with a big headache and then you feel other things too. It can last for many months. \n\nTiny bugs cause it and it's very easy to catch, but not usually from other people. You can get it easily and some people have tried to show\nthe mosquito often gives a sickness. This sickness happens mostly during the time when there are lots of mosquitos. It has been given to monkeys by sick mosquitos two times.\n\nBAD SKIN SICKNESS\n\nThis very bad skin sickness is caused by a tiny creature that we can't see. But we don't know how this tiny creature gets inside our bodies. People have many ideas, but we don't know which one is right. Some people think that bugs might carry this tiny creature and give it to healthy people. This tiny creature lives in the skin and sores of sick people. So, bugs that eat blood or sores could take some of these tiny creatures inside their bodies. These tiny creatures have been found inside mosquitos, fleas, and bedbugs. So, some people think that these bugs might give the sickness to people. We also think that small bugs that live on our faces might spread the sickness.\n\nThis skin sickness happens mostly in people who don't clean their bodies often. These people usually have a lot of bugs on their bodies.\nThere are tiny creatures that like to live in dirty places, so if germs can move this way, there are a lot of them.\n\nPeople have noticed that the sores usually show up on parts of the body that are not covered by clothes. This might mean that bugs like flies and mosquitoes can give you these sores. In places where elephantiasis is common, leprosy is also often found. This makes people think that maybe the mosquito could be carrying both diseases. So, we need to be careful around bugs that are near leprosy patients until we know more about how the disease spreads.\n\nKALA-AZAR OR DUM-DUM FEVER\n\nThis is a very bad disease that makes people in many warm places very scared. It happens because of tiny creatures in the body that have been studied by many people.\n\nDr. William from the IN country Health Service has been doing a lot of experiments with the common bedbug of IN city. These experiments seem to show that this bug is responsible for spreading the tiny creature that causes the disease.\nillness. He has found the tiny bug in all stages of growth in the\nbedbug. This, along with other findings about the illness sticking to specific homes, makes a strong case against the bedbug. However, a man named Matthew believes that the tiny bug may be passed on by other things as well, maybe by flies that visit the sores or in other ways.\n\n\nA SORE\n\nThis illness, once thought to be only in the OR region, is now found to be in many warm places, where it is sometimes very common. It is caused by a tiny bug in the body that is very similar to or the same as the one causing a serious illness and is viewed by some as a changed form of that illness. The patient gets one or more serious sores or ulcers which usually happen on open parts of the body.\n\nThe tiny bug that causes the illness is thought to be carried by\ninsects in one way or another.\n\nIn the last case the insect may act as a middle host.\n\nDogs and camels also get this illness and may be sources of\ninfection.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK LIST\n\n\nA full list of books and articles talking more or less directly about the topics talked about in this book would be too long for use here. For the past ten or twelve years many of the medical and biological\nBooks have stories about many things. I have picked some important ones, mostly the ones I have read myself.

Want some of my sweets? My bag got too heavy to carry around.\" I looked at Emma's sweets. Suddenly I remembered something. I remembered lots of things. I remembered _hints_. \"I have no time for sweets,\" I said. \"I must go to Rachel's house right away.\" Sam and I hurried to Rachel's house.\n\nShe was lying on a couch.

Now Henry sells pumpkin seeds. They can cost up to $8 each.\n\nIn the late 20th century, two people grew very big pumpkins. They were heavier than 1,000 pounds each. Each year, pumpkins get bigger! In another year, the world record was 1,446 pounds. That pumpkin weighed almost as much as a cow.\n\nGrowing big pumpkins is a fun game. It's also important work. One game gives $50,000 for the biggest pumpkin.\n\nGrowers work a lot. They dig big holes. They mix food for the plants and manure. They make shelters. Some use cameras to keep their pumpkins safe from animals and bad people. And they water their pumpkins a _lot_ --up to 1,000 gallons every day!\n\nA big pumpkin can grow 20 pounds a day. The stress can make them to split--or even burst! That's not good for the grower. Winning pumpkins cannot have any splits.\n\nWhat can you do with a big pumpkin?\n\n- Show it at a large casino!\n\n- Get it on TV!\n\nOne thing you _can't_ do: make a big pie. Big pumpkins don't taste good. And they're not good for you. That's because farmers use a lot of stuff to keep bugs away from pumpkins.\n\n# A word about learning with\n\nThe 'Nathan the Nice' stories are really fun. Kids have loved these books for a very long time. These books are also good for learning at school and at home.\n\nNathan's world--his house, his friends, his street--is a world that every kid knows. Nathan shows new readers and those who are starting to read longer books to the mystery stories, and they like Nathan's dedication to figuring out the mystery and helping his friends.\n\nMoreover, as Nathan the Nice solves his mysteries, readers learn with him.
